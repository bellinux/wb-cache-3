5|$|Homologues {{of most of}} {{the bones}} of temnospondyls are also seen in other early tetrapods, aside from a few bones in the skull, such as interfrontals, internasals, and interparietals, that have {{developed}} in some temnospondyl taxa. Most temnospondyls have tabular horns in the backs of their skulls, rounded projections of bone separated {{from the rest of the}} skull by indentations called otic notches; in some temnospondyls, such as Zatrachys, they are pointed and very prominent. Among the most distinguishing features of temnospondyls are the interpterygoid vacuities, two large holes in the back of the palate. Another pair <b>of</b> <b>holes,</b> choanae, are present in front of these vacuities, and connect the nasal passage with the mouth. Temnospondyls often have teeth on their palates, as well as in their jaws. Some of these teeth are so large, they are referred to as tusks. In some temnospondyls, such as Nigerpeton, tusks in the lower jaw pierce the palate and emerge through openings in the top of the skull.|$|E
5|$|The {{cervical}} vertebrae of Apatosaurus {{are less}} elongated and more heavily constructed {{than those of}} Diplodocus, a diplodocid like Apatosaurus, and {{the bones of the}} leg are much stockier despite being longer, implying that Apatosaurus was a more robust animal. The tail was held above the ground during normal locomotion. Apatosaurus had a single claw on each forelimb and three on each hindlimb. The Apatosaurus skull, long thought to be similar to Camarasaurus, is much more similar to that of Diplodocus. Apatosaurus was a generalized browser that likely held its head elevated. To lighten its vertebrae, Apatosaurus had air sacs that made the bones internally full <b>of</b> <b>holes.</b> Like that of other diplodocids, its tail may have been used as a whip to create loud noises.|$|E

5|$|A small {{platform}} {{was added}} to the East Platform in the Early Classic, the surface of the platform possesses a series <b>of</b> <b>holes</b> that may have supported banners. The platform covered a large pit that contained the bodies of seventeen sacrificial victims, including men, women and children, possibly sacrificed during a dedicatory ceremony for the platform itself. In the 4th century AD the first version of Structure 5D-82 was built, {{to the north of the}} East Platform. In the second half of the 4th century six tombs were built in the East Platform. Ceramic offerings in the tombs included effigy vessels representing monkeys and macaws. The high artistic and technical quality of the funerary offerings in these tombs identify the deceased as members of Tikal's elite; they may have been members of a line of the ruling dynasty that lost power among the political upheaval of the late 4th century and included the kings K'inichMuwaanJol and ChakTokIch'aakI. With the entry of Siyaj K'ak' and the establishment of a new political order in the city, the focus of royal funerary rites was shifted from the Mundo Perdido to the North Acropolis.|$|E
5|$|Poole Quay is {{a visitor}} {{attraction}} {{to the south of}} the town centre lined with a mixture of traditional public houses, new bars, redeveloped warehouses, modern apartment blocks and historic listed buildings. Once the busy centre of Poole's maritime industry, all port activities moved to Hamworthy in the 1970s as the Quay became increasingly popular with tourists. The Grade II* listed Customs House on the quay-front was built in 1814 and now functions as a restaurant and bar. Nearby the Grade I listed Town Cellars, a medieval warehouse built in the 15th century on the foundations of a 14th-century stone building, houses a local history centre. Scaplen's Court, another Grade I listed building, also dates from the medieval era. Poole Pottery has been redeveloped into an apartment block. Boats regularly depart from the quay during the summer and provide cruises around the harbour and to Brownsea Island, the River Frome and Swanage. Public artworks along the Quay include Sea Music – a large metal sculpture designed by Sir Anthony Caro, and a life-size bronze sculpture of Robert Baden-Powell created to celebrate the founding of the Scout Movement on Brownsea Island. At the western end of the quay near the mouth <b>of</b> <b>Holes</b> Bay is Poole Bridge. Built in 1927, it is the third bridge to be located on the site since 1834.|$|E
25|$|The score {{achieved}} {{for each}} and every hole of the round or tournament is added to produce the total score, and the player with the lowest score wins in stroke play. Stroke play is the game most commonly played by professional golfers. If there is a tie after the regulation number <b>of</b> <b>holes</b> in a professional tournament, a playoff takes place between all tied players. Playoffs either are sudden death or employ a pre-determined number <b>of</b> <b>holes,</b> anywhere from three to a full 18. In sudden death, a player who scores lower on a hole than all of his opponents wins the match. If at least two players remain tied after such a playoff using a pre-determined number <b>of</b> <b>holes,</b> then play continues in sudden death format, where {{the first player to}} win a hole wins the tournament.|$|E

Hole tilting angle, varying from 1 to 4 degrees, and hole tilting direction to account for anisotropic properties of composite material were investigated. Progressive damage model (PDM) based on Chang-Lessard type criterion with an extension by Olmedo was created, which involved seven failure modes and made material properties be a direct function of predefined field variables. The model was implemented in ABAQUS/Standard using a UMAT subroutine. Good agreement was found when comparing numerical simulation results with experimental outcomes. In addition, the results demonstrate that, with increasing <b>of</b> <b>hole</b> tilting angle, damage is prone to arise and the load path of the composite bolted joints alters with changing <b>of</b> <b>hole</b> tilting direction, which result in severe stress concentration around the edge <b>of</b> <b>hole</b> and joint failure in advance...|$|R
