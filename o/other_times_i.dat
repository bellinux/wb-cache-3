500|$|When {{choosing}} the songs, Gunn revealed he [...] "started {{the process by}} reading the Billboard charts {{for all of the}} top hits of the '70s", downloading [...] "a few hundred" [...] songs that were [...] "semi-familiar — ones you recognize but {{might not be able to}} name off the top of your head" [...] and creating a playlist for all the songs that would fit the film tonally. He added that he [...] "would listen to the playlist on my speakers around the house — sometimes I would be inspired to create a scene around a song, and <b>other</b> <b>times</b> <b>I</b> had a scene that needed music and I would listen through the playlist, visualizing various songs, figuring out which would work the best." [...] Most of the songs were played on set to help [...] "the actors and the camera operators find the perfect groove for the shot", with David Bowie's [...] "Moonage Daydream" [...] the only song chosen and added during post-production. Gunn also said that the opening scenes were designed with [...] "Hooked on a Feeling" [...] in mind; however once Gunn discovered [...] "Come and Get Your Love", the song used in the sequence, Gunn felt it was a [...] "better fit." ...|$|E

2500|$|After the 2009 Reading Festival, Radiohead did {{not perform}} [...] "Creep" [...] again until 2016, when they {{performed}} it several times on tour for their ninth studio album, A Moon Shaped Pool. After a fan spent the majority of a concert shouting for it, the band decided to play it to [...] "see what the reaction is, {{just to see how}} it feels.'" [...] O'Brien said of the song in 2017: [...] "It's nice to play for the right reasons. People like it and want to hear it. We do err towards not playing it because you don't want it to feel like show business. But we started throwing it in last year." [...] In the same interview, Yorke said: [...] "It can be cool sometimes, but <b>other</b> <b>times</b> <b>I</b> want to stop halfway through and be like, 'Nah, this isn't happening.'" [...] Later that year, the band performed the song during the encore of their headline performance at the Glastonbury Festival.|$|E
2500|$|Outhwaite has {{suggested}} that the wardrobe department struggled {{to come up with a}} static identity for Melanie at first; however, this she felt turned out to be a good thing: [...] "What I really liked about it was, when we started looking for costumes , the wardrobe department couldn't quite fit where I was going. I'd wear Army pants and trainers some days and then jeans some other days and then I'd be all suited and booted at <b>other</b> <b>times.</b> <b>I</b> said, 'That's what girls do! That's how I am. Some days I'm in scruffs and some days I'm really dressed up. It would be really nice to have a character who's not so predictable.'" [...] Rosalind Powell, head of the EastEnders wardrobe design team in 2000, said that Mel had [...] "colourful and stylish" [...] wardrobe from retailers such as Kookai and Oasis. Powell added, [...] "Although she's a barmaid, she can still afford to wear nice clothes, she just doesn't have a very big wardrobe." ...|$|E
2500|$|The harsh {{reception}} that Vestiges received, and the mockery {{which was}} made of its evolutionary ideas, has been cited by some historians as a factor leading to Darwin's caution in publishing his own theory of evolution. In a letter to Thomas Henry Huxley in 1854 (five years before his own book on evolution was published but twelve years after its ideas had first been sketched out in an unpublished essay), Darwin expressed sympathy for the (still anonymous) author of Vestiges {{in the face of}} a savage review by Huxley: [...] "I must think that such a book, if it does no other good, spreads the taste for Natural Science. But I am perhaps no fair judge, for I am almost as unorthodox about species as the Vestiges itself, though I hope not quite so unphilosophical." [...] However, later the same year, in a letter to Hooker, Darwin mentioned Vestiges in a more sober tone: [...] "I should have less scruple in troubling you if I had any confidence what my work would turn out. Sometimes I think it will be good, at <b>other</b> <b>times</b> <b>I</b> really feel as much ashamed of myself as the author of the Vestiges ought to be of himself." ...|$|E

2500|$|During the Fragile Tour, Wakeman bought {{four books}} {{at an airport}} bookstall in Richmond, Virginia, {{including}} one about Henry VIII and his six wives titled The Private Life of Henry VIII (1964) by Scottish writer Nancy Brysson Morrison. As he read about Anne Boleyn on the subsequent flight to Chicago, a theme he recorded in November 1971 ran through his mind which he wrote on some hand drawn ledger lines and played during the sound check and the subsequent concert. Said Wakeman, [...] "I had been searching for a style to write in and suddenly I found it in writing music about these six ladies...I would concentrate {{on one of the}} wives and then music just came into my head and I would write it down. Sometimes I was flying, <b>other</b> <b>times</b> <b>I</b> was on stage, or {{just in front of the}} piano at home ... The six wives theme gave me the thread, the link, I needed to give me a reason for putting these pieces of music together." [...] He explains the album's concept further in its liner notes: [...] "The album is based around my interpretations of the musical characteristics of the wives of Henry VIII. Although the style may not always be in keeping with their individual history, it is my personal conception of their characters in relation to keyboard instruments." [...] Wakeman elaborated and wrote the music as if he was doing a surreal painting, [...] "sketches of how I felt about them at the time".|$|E
60|$|<b>Other</b> <b>times</b> <b>I</b> lay on {{the floor}} in the mistress's work-room and slept, she gently using me for a foot-stool, knowing it pleased me, for it was a caress; <b>other</b> <b>times</b> <b>I</b> spent an hour in the nursery, and got well tousled and made happy; <b>other</b> <b>times</b> <b>I</b> watched by the crib there, when the baby was asleep and the nurse out for a few minutes on the baby's affairs; <b>other</b> <b>times</b> <b>I</b> romped and raced through the grounds and the garden with Sadie till we were tired out, then slumbered on the grass in the shade of a tree while she read her book; <b>other</b> <b>times</b> <b>I</b> went visiting among the {{neighbor}} dogs--for there were some most pleasant ones not far away, and one very handsome and courteous and graceful one, a curly-haired Irish setter by the name of Robin Adair, who was a Presbyterian like me, and belonged to the Scotch minister.|$|E

5000|$|The British comedy Dave Allen at Large has {{a sketch}} {{taking place in}} the American West, in which an outlaw loads his {{revolver}} and heads for a saloon just before noon, against the pleas and begging of his woman not to go through with it.
