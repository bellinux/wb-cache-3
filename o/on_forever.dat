5|$|In the sonnet, {{the speaker}} asks {{whether or not}} he should compare his beloved to the summer season, and argues that he should not because the {{comparison}} does not properly express the depths of his emotion. He also states that his beloved will live <b>on</b> <b>forever</b> through the words of the poem. Scholars have found parallels within the poem to Ovid's Tristia and Amores, both of which have love themes. Sonnet 18 is written in the typical Shakespearean sonnet form, having 14 lines of iambic pentameter ending in a rhymed couplet. Detailed exegeses have revealed several double meanings within the poem, giving it a greater depth of interpretation.|$|E
5|$|The Cagneys had run-of-the-play contracts, {{which lasted}} {{as long as}} the play did. Vernon was in the chorus line of the show, and with help from the Actors' Equity Association, Cagney understudied Tracy on the Broadway show, {{providing}} them with a desperately needed steady income. Cagney also established a dance school for professionals, then landed a part in the play Women Go <b>On</b> <b>Forever,</b> directed by John Cromwell, which ran for four months. By the end of the run, Cagney was exhausted from acting and running the dance school.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1930s and early 1940s, Edsel—who was {{president}} of the company—thought Ford had to come to some sort of collective bargaining agreement with the unions because the violence, work disruptions, and bitter stalemates could not go <b>on</b> <b>forever.</b> But Ford, who still had the final veto in the company on a de facto basis even if not an official one, refused to cooperate. For several years, he kept Bennett in charge of talking to the unions that were trying to organize the Ford Motor Company. Sorensen's memoir makes clear that Ford's purpose in putting Bennett in charge was to make sure no agreements were ever reached.|$|E
25|$|Interaction {{of actors}} has no {{specific}} beginning or end. It goes <b>on</b> <b>forever.</b> Since {{it does so}} it has very peculiar properties. Whereas a conversation is mapped (due to a possibility of obtaining a vague kinematic, perhaps picture-frame image, of it, onto Newtonian time, precisely {{because it has a}} beginning and end), an interaction, in general, cannot be treated in this manner. Kinematics are inadequate to deal with life: we need kinetics. Even so as in the minimal case of a strict conversation we cannot construct the truth value, metaphor or analogy of A and B. The A, B differences are generalizations about a coalescence of concepts on the part of A and B; their commonality and coherence is the similarity. The difference (reiterated) is the differentiation of A and B (their agreements to disagree, their incoherences). Truth value in this case meaning the coherence between all of the interacting actors.|$|E

[...] Garson Kanin shared their viewpoint and described Leigh as [...] "a stunner whose ravishing beauty often tended to obscure her staggering achievements as an actress. Great beauties are infrequently great actresses– simply because they don't need to be. Vivien was different; ambitious, persevering, serious, often inspired." ...|$|E
500|$|He {{had built}} a {{reputation}} as an innovative teacher, so when he was cast as the lead in Grand Street Follies of 1928, he was also appointed the choreographer. The show received rave reviews and was followed by Grand Street Follies of 1929. These roles led to a part in George Kelly's Maggie the Magnificent, a play the critics disliked, though they liked Cagney's performance. Cagney saw this role (and Women Go <b>on</b> <b>Forever)</b> as significant because of the talented directors he met. He learned [...] "...what a director was for and what a director could do. They were directors who could play all the parts in the play better than the actors cast for them." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1968, Hans Albert {{coined the}} term [...] "Münchhausen trilemma" [...] to {{describe}} the philosophical problem inherent in having to derive conclusions from premises; those premises have {{to be derived from}} still other premises, and so <b>on</b> <b>forever,</b> leading to an infinite regress interruptible only by circular logic or dogmatism. The problem is named after the similarly paradoxical story in which the Baron saves himself from being drowned in a swamp by pulling on his own hair. The same story also inspired the mathematical term [...] "Munchausen number", coined by Daan van Berkel in 2009 to describe numbers whose digits, when raised to their own powers, can be added together to form the number itself (for example, 3435=33+44+33+55).|$|E
500|$|While Chris O'Donnell reprises {{the role}} of Robin, Val Kilmer decided not to reprise {{the role of}} Batman from Batman Forever. Schumacher {{admitted}} he had difficulty working with Kilmer <b>on</b> <b>Forever.</b> [...] "He sort of quit," [...] Schumacher said, [...] "and we sort of fired him." [...] Kilmer {{said he was not}} aware of the fast track production and was already committed to The Saint (1997). Schumacher originally had a strong interest in casting William Baldwin in Kilmer's place, but George Clooney was cast instead. Schumacher believed Clooney could provide a lighter interpretation of the character than Michael Keaton (in Batman and Batman Returns) and Kilmer. The shooting schedule allowed Clooney to simultaneously work on ER without any scheduling conflicts.|$|E
500|$|Dylan's contemporaries in 1965 {{were both}} startled and {{challenged}} by the single. Paul McCartney remembered going around to John Lennon's house in Weybridge to hear the song. According to McCartney, [...] "It seemed {{to go on and}} <b>on</b> <b>forever.</b> It was just beautiful... He showed all of us {{that it was possible to}} go a little further." [...] Frank Zappa had a more extreme reaction: [...] "When I heard 'Like a Rolling Stone', I wanted to quit the music business, because I felt: 'If this wins and it does what it's supposed to do, I don't need to do anything else...' But it didn't do anything. It sold but nobody responded to it in the way that they should have." [...] Nearly forty years later, in 2003, Elvis Costello commented on the innovative quality of the single. [...] "What a shocking thing to live in a world where there was Manfred Mann and the Supremes and Engelbert Humperdinck and here comes 'Like a Rolling Stone'".|$|E

He knew a lot of kids and introduced them to all the new dances, he put on that song 'More Bounce', and they started pop-locking. And I think from that visual, from seeing that, it was my first introduction into hip-hop. Period. I didn't know nothing about nothing. I hadn't heard [...] "Rapper's Delight" [...] yet. It was the first thing that was really fly to me. They started dancing, and since 'More Bounce' goes <b>on</b> <b>forever,</b> they just got down. I just think that was a rush of adrenaline for me, like a chemical reaction in my brain." ...|$|E
500|$|After ceasing {{internal}} game development, 3D Realms approached noted game developers Gearbox Software {{and asked}} them if they were interested in helping Triptych Games polish the nearly finished PC version and port it to the consoles. Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford, who had worked on an expansion to Duke Nukem 3D and very briefly <b>on</b> <b>Forever</b> before he left to found Gearbox, felt that [...] "Duke can't die" [...] and decided {{that he was going to}} help [...] "in Duke’s time of need." [...] He started providing funding for the game and contacted 2K Games' president to persuade his company that Gearbox and Triptych can complete the development of the game and get it released on all platforms in time. Duke Nukem Forever was originally intended to be a PC exclusive game, however 2K and Gearbox had hired Piranha Games to port the game designed for PC to Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 and added a Multiplayer in order to raise sales.|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. Sophie Bruce of BBC Music, Michael Wood of Los Angeles Times, {{and a writer}} for Rap-Up named the song one of the album's highlights. Quentin B. Huff of PopMatters was positive, writing that the song and [...] "Slow Dance" [...] "tend to provide better matches between the vocals and the music, since the backdrop keeps things simple and the lyrics don’t always fall into slang and unintentional irony". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine wrote that the album's problem is the slow numbers, including [...] "Make Love". Cinquemani said that the song requires a [...] "much more talented vocalist to elevate it above mere filler". Steve Jones of USA Today named it a track to skip, and Glenn Gamboa of Newsday also dismissed the song, writing that it [...] "seems to go <b>on</b> <b>forever,</b> especially following the similarly too-long, too-drawn-out 'Slow Dance". Tracy Garraud of Vibe wrote that its chords [...] "sound more like a Disney princess' cue than a royal highness' arrival and Hilson's fairy-dusted vocals sound more platonic than carnal".|$|E

500|$|The Allman Brothers Band {{performed}} {{its final}} show on October 28, 2014 at the Beacon Theatre. The show was the 238th straight sellout {{for the band}} at the Beacon. The concert consisted of three sets, comprising mostly music from their first five records, with no guest musicians sitting in. [...] "We had a band meeting and decided no guest sit-ins. We're going out with just the band," [...] Allman told reporters. Following the sets, which ran into the early morning hours, the band joined together center stage and took a bow, with Allman recalling the group's first rehearsal 45 years prior: [...] "I was called to come and meet these guys in Jacksonville, Florida, [...] on March 26, 1969. Now, we're gonna do the first song we ever played." [...] Following this, the band performed [...] "Trouble No More" [...] by Muddy Waters.

500|$|American Beauty {{follows a}} {{traditional}} narrative structure, only deviating with the displaced opening scene of Jane and Ricky {{from the middle}} of the story. Although the plot spans one year, the film is narrated by Lester at the moment of his death. Jacqueline Furby says that the plot [...] "occupies no time [...] all time", citing Lester's claim that life did not flash before his eyes, but that it [...] "stretches <b>on</b> <b>forever</b> like an ocean of time". Furby argues that a [...] "rhythm of repetition" [...] forms the core of the film's structure. For example, two scenes have the Burnhams sitting down to an evening meal, shot from the same angle. Each image is broadly similar, with minor differences in object placement and body language that reflect the changed dynamic brought on by Lester's new-found assertiveness. Another example is the pair of scenes in which Jane and Ricky film each other. Ricky films Jane from his bedroom window as she removes her bra, and the image is reversed later for a similarly [...] "voyeuristic and exhibitionist" [...] scene in which Jane films Ricky at a vulnerable moment.|$|E
500|$|Eastwood said he {{has always}} opposed war and is a pragmatic Libertarian rather than a red-meat Republican. Eastwood further {{explained}} his anti-war stance by saying [...] "I was {{a child growing up}} during World War II. That {{was supposed to be the}} one to end all wars. And four years later, I was standing at the draft board being drafted during the Korean conflict, and then after that there was Vietnam, and it goes on and <b>on</b> <b>forever</b> … I just wonder … does this ever stop? And no, it doesn't. So each time we get in these conflicts, it deserves a lot of thought before we go wading in or wading out. Going in or coming out. It needs a better thought process, I think." [...] Furthermore, Eastwood's 2014 movie American Sniper was met with strong critical praise, especially from many Republicans who called it a pro-War on Terror, pro-Republican, and patriotic film; Eastwood responded by saying that such notions represented a [...] "stupid analysis" [...] and that the movie had nothing to do with political parties. Eastwood responded to critics of American Sniper by saying his film was [...] "the biggest anti-war statement any film can make", and that the film depicts [...] "the fact of what [...] does to the family and the people who have to go back into civilian life like Chris Kyle did" [...] and [...] "what it (war) does to the people left behind." ...|$|E
