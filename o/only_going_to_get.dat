[...] Ever since 1931, when he had returned to Lick and Berkley after serving two years as an assistant at Mount Wilson, he had felt strongly that Mount Hamilton required a larger telescope. [...] The astronomers at Lick were proud {{of their ability to}} achieve important results with Lick's small [...] Crossley reflector. [...] Its diminutive size first became apparent in 1908, when Mount Wilson's [...] telescope saw first light. This was accentuated by the opening of the [...] Dominion Astrophysical Observatory in 1917, and Mount Wilson's even larger [...] Hooker telescope in 1919. [...] Mayall was adept at working with the small Crossley, but understood that it could never really stand up to a competing telescope that collected nine times the amount of light. [...] This was <b>only</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> worse when the [...] Hale Telescope was completed at Palomar Observatory. [...] Mayall and other young faculty at Lick thought that the older faculty such as Moore and Wright were too committed to the small telescopes and should have tried harder to obtain a larger reflector.|$|E

Questioning the implications, this article situates “turnaround ” strategies locally, following {{the closure of}} a predominantly minority high school in 2008, in Austin, Texas. The neoliberal reforms, intending to “clean the slate” and privatize school management, constituted “shock therapy. ” The school’s closure also reflected an increasingly punitive approach to state-based sup-port systems. Furthermore, although the state articulated the closure as a benefit to students, the community experienced closure {{as a type of}} social and civic death.

The <b>only</b> way he's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out alive is by relying on his old skills. And he's a master of that. The second fight explodes out of anger, and it's really anger at himself for <b>going</b> back <b>to</b> being a gambling addict. They're character-driven fights.

The song was the last track to be recorded for the album but the session was marred by conflict and drama. After the band had completed the song's instrumental backing track, guitarist and harmony vocalist David Crosby announced that he wasn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> sing on the recording and was instead leaving the studio for the day.

5000|$|Reaction to {{the album}} has been {{generally}} favorable. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 67, based on 6 reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews". Slant Magazine critic Jonathan Keefe awarded the album {{three out of}} five stars and stated that Shout It Out [...] "is the trio's most ambitious project" [...] and that it [...] "includes {{a few moments of}} real inspiration." [...] Allmusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine also rated the album three out of five stars in a more mixed review. Erlewine remarked that, [...] "Hanson are sharp enough to keep things tight... but the music itself is too finely honed." [...] A review from AbsolutePunk surmises that, [...] "Aside from the trio's penchant for maudlin and borderline campy lyrics, there's little about Shout it Out that isn't infectious". The Entertainment Weekly review praised the album, claiming: [...] "Uptempo jams like Waiting for This shimmer with top-shelf songcraft; Motown vet Bob Babbitt even sits in on bass. But sometimes you wish these whiz kids would act their age". QRO said the album [...] "may just be okay, but it's at the highest tier of okay. It's not a great album, but it's not trying to be either; it plays to its audience, and it does it well." [...] Jonathan Keefe from Slant Magazine was, somewhat, favorable in his review, saying:"What's encouraging about the record, though, is that Hanson's instincts are more or less on point. The effervescent brass sections, aggressive rhythm tracks, and AM-radio vibe they've incorporated are all logical and effective additions to their aesthetic. That Hanson has been around for well over a decade now makes it easy to forget that they're still a young band. And the elements that really work on Shout It Out suggest that they're <b>only</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> continue <b>to</b> <b>get</b> better". Connor McKnight from Billboard was largely positive, writing: [...] "Long before the first Jonas Brothers album hit the shelves, another sibling trio reigned supreme. Hanson brothers Isaac, Taylor and Zac may still be widely known for their playful 1997 pop hit, [...] "MMMBop," [...] but the trio's fifth studio album, [...] "Shout It Out," [...] shows that the group continues to expand its musical roots. A colorful set that pays tribute to the funk, soul and R&B musical influences that shapes its sound, [...] "Shout It Out" [...] has a sunnier vibe than the group's 2007 predecessor, [...] "The Walk." [...] "Shout It Out" [...] still breaks into emotional territory with piano ballads like [...] "Use Me Up" [...] (featuring Zac on lead vocals), while Taylor's windy tenor shines on [...] "Carry You There." [...] From the profoundly upbeat single [...] "Thinking 'Bout Something'" [...] to the heartfelt and introspective closer [...] "Me Myself and I," [...] "Shout It Out" [...] is a fun listen that beams with genuine talent and creative artistry".|$|R
