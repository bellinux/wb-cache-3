50|$|Several {{witnesses}} saw Flight 266 {{take off}} and reported seeing sparks emanating from either engine #1 or {{the rear of the}} fuselage, while others claimed an engine was on fire. Salvage operations were conducted to recover the wreckage of the aircraft, along with what remains of the passengers and crew could be located, but not much useful information was gleaned as the cockpit instruments were not recovered. The wreckage was in approximately 930 feet (280 meters) of water and had been severely fragmented, however the relatively small area in which it was spread indicated an extremely steep, nose-down angle at impact. The #2 and #3 engines suffered severe rotational damage from high RPM speeds at impact, but the #1 engine had almost no damage because it had been powered off. No evidence of any fire or heat damage was found on the engines, thus disproving the witnesses' claims. The small portion of the electrical system that was recovered did not provide any relevant information. NTSB investigators could not explain the sparking seen by witnesses on the ground and theorized that it might have been caused by debris being sucked into the engine, a transient compressor stall or an electrical system problem that led to the eventual power failure. They also were unable to explain the engine #1 fire warning {{in the absence of a}} fire, but this may have resulted from electrical system problems or a cracked duct that allowed hot engine air to set off the temperature sensors. Some tests indicated that it was indeed possible for the #2 generator to fail from an overload condition as a result of the <b>operating</b> <b>load</b> being suddenly shifted onto it following the #1 generator's shutdown, and this was maintained as a possible cause of the failure.|$|E

40|$|In {{the process}} of product manufacturing, control of {{assembly}} error will directly affect product operating behavior. When product running, <b>operating</b> <b>loads</b> will lead to change of assembly relation of product parts, affecting product behavior. Based on Jacobian-Torsor method, the Jacobian Torsor tolerance model, considering contribution of <b>operating</b> <b>loads,</b> was extended and corrected, the assembly error (assembly relation change) resulted from <b>operating</b> <b>loads</b> can be calculated. Variation of running behavior with assembly error was divided to three phases: compensation phase, rapid loss phase and total loss phase. Based on changing curve of product behavior, function of behavior loss was constructed to describe behavior loss resulting from assembly error of a part of product. The conception and calculating method of behavior loss index (BLI) are given to reflect behavior changing status of whole product under certain assembly accuracy. Combined with extended Jacobia -Torsor method, the calculated results {{can be used to}} predict product behavior change led by <b>operating</b> <b>loads.</b> The prediction can help to know next measurement adopted in product design phase.

The interconnected two area power system of non-reheat thermal power plants consisting of 2 DOF-PID controller in each area has been considered for design and analysis. Firstly, the proposed approach has been implemented in the aforementioned standard test system and thereafter, the robustness of the system consisting 2 DOF-PID controller optimized by proposed technique has been estimated using the sensitivity analysis for the same. The robustness of the system consisting of 2 DOF-PID controller optimized by proposed scheme is examined by varying the parameters of standard test system, loading conditions during operation, size and location of the disturbances. The performance of the 2 DOF-PID controller optimized by proposed approach has also been compared with recently published approaches in the literature. The simulation {{results show that the}} proposed hGWOPS optimized 2 DOF-PID controller shows far better performance than recently published approaches in the literature in terms of dynamic response.

50|$|Both systems fail {{over time}} through fatigue {{fractures}} if <b>operated</b> repeatedly at <b>loads</b> {{more than a}} small percentage of their tensile breaking strength. Hoists are often designed with internal clutches to limit <b>operating</b> <b>loads</b> below this threshold. Within such limits wire rope rusts from the inside outward while chain links are markedly reduced in cross section through wear on the inner surfaces. Regular lubrication of both tensile systems is recommended to reduce frequency of replacement. High speed lifting, greater than about , requires wire rope wound on a drum, because chain over a pocket wheel generates fatigue-inducing resonance for long lifts.|$|R

The control objective is to enhance the stability and to improve the dynamic response of a single-machine power system operating in different conditions. Simulation results show that this control strategy is very robust, flexible and alternative performance. First a sliding-mode controller with an integral operating switching surface is designed. Then a fuzzy sliding mode controller is investigated in which a simple fuzzy inference mechanism is used to estimate the upper bound of uncertainties, then chattering is reduced. A detailed sensitivity analysis for a one-machine-infinite-bus system reveals that the fuzzy sliding-mode power system stabilizer is quite robust to wide variations in <b>operating</b> <b>load</b> and system parameters.
