The most serious damage would be due to rains rather than winds or storm surge, although distant hurricanes may still create heavy surf, possibly injuring or killing people. Nora caused millions in damage and skirted extreme southeastern California.|$|E

The game itself provided tens <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> of economic impact for the South Florida region, which attracted {{tens of thousands of}} visitors from both Virginia and Kansas. In Kansas, bars and liquor stores benefited from the game, as Jayhawks' fans stocked up on food and alcohol for the game.|$|E

The trade ban resulted in the sudden loss <b>of</b> hundreds <b>of</b> <b>million</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> in hard currency to Amin, mostly from coffee exports to the US, which had been used by Amin to buy arms, luxury goods, and the loyalty of his mercenary army.

5|$|The 1997 Pacific {{hurricane}} season {{was a very}} active {{hurricane season}}. With hundreds of deaths and hundreds <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> in damage, this season {{was one of the}} costliest and deadliest Pacific hurricane seasons. This was due to the exceptionally strong 1997–98 El Niño event. The 1997 Pacific hurricane season officially started on May 15, 1997, in the eastern Pacific, and on June 1, 1997, in the central Pacific, and lasted until November 30, 1997. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when almost all tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean.|$|E
5|$|The Itanium bus {{interfaces}} to {{the rest}} of the system via a chipset. Enterprise server manufacturers differentiate their systems by designing and developing chipsets that interface the processor to memory, interconnections, and peripheral controllers. The chipset is the heart of the system-level architecture for each system design. Development of a chipset costs tens <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> and represents a major commitment to the use of the Itanium. IBM created a chipset in 2003, and Intel in 2002, but neither of them developed chipsets to support newer technologies such as DDR2 or PCI Express.|$|E

5|$|The {{next year}} Madonna and Maverick sued Warner Music Group and its former parent company Time Warner, {{claiming}} that mismanagement {{of resources and}} poor bookkeeping had cost the company millions of dollars. In return, Warner filed a countersuit alleging that Maverick had lost tens <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> on its own. The dispute was resolved when the Maverick shares, owned by Madonna and Ronnie Dashev, were purchased by Warner. Madonna and Dashev's company became a wholly owned subsidiary of Warner Music, but Madonna was still signed to Warner under a separate recording contract.|$|E
5|$|Time {{constraints}} prevented {{many elements}} from {{appearing in the}} final game. One such missing feature was a fatality system by which Spartans or Covenant leaders could inflict massive damage on large groups of units. Pottinger said that the animations, while interesting, did not mesh with the fast-paced combat of Halo Wars and raised balance concerns. Other elements based on Halo fiction did not work in a strategy game. Although more than 100 people worked on the project, which cost tens <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars,</b> a Covenant campaign was never realized {{because of a lack}} of manpower and money.|$|E

Zimbabwe's involvement from 1998 to 2002 {{in the war}} in the Democratic Republic of the Congo drained hundreds <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> from the economy. From 1999–2009, Zimbabwe saw the lowest ever economic growth with an annual GDP decrease of 6.1%.|$|E
