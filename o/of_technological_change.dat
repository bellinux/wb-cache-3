25|$|Technological {{change is}} a {{combination}} of more and of better technology. A 2011 study in the journal Science showed that the peak of the rate of change of the world's capacity to compute information was in 1998, when the world's technological capacity to compute information on general-purpose computers grew at 88% per year. Since then, technological change clearly has slowed. In recent times, every new year allowed humans to carry out roughly 160% of the computations that possibly could have been executed by all existing general-purpose computers in the year before. This still is exponential, but shows the varying nature <b>of</b> <b>technological</b> <b>change.</b>|$|E

Between 1986 and 2007, machines' application-specific capacity to compute information per capita roughly doubled every 14 months; the per capita capacity of the world's general-purpose computers has doubled every 18 months; the global telecommunication capacity per capita doubled every 34 months; and the world's storage capacity per capita doubled every 40 months.|$|E

25|$|Factor endowments also {{influenced}} political institutions. This {{is demonstrated by}} the plantation owning elite using their power to secure long lasting government institutions and pass legislation {{that lead to the}} persistence of inequality society. Engerman and Sokoloff found smallholder economies to be more equitable since they discouraged an elite class from forming, and distributed political power democratically to most land-owning males. These differences in political institutions were also highly influential in the development of schools, as more equitable societies demanded an educated population to make political decisions. Over time these institutional advantages had exponential effects, as colonies with educated and free populations were better suited to take advantage <b>of</b> <b>technological</b> <b>change</b> during the industrial revolution, granting country wide participation into the booming free-market economy.|$|E
25|$|In {{analogy with}} Thomas Kuhn's {{definition}} of a scientific paradigm, Dosi has defined a technological paradigm as the general outlook on the productive problems faced by firms. As such, a technological paradigm is composed by some sort of model of the technology at stake (e.g. the model of a microprocessor) and by the specific technological problems posed by such model (e.g. increasing computational capacity, reducing dimensions, etc.). Therefore, technology is identified as a problem-solving activity in which the problems to be solved are selected by the paradigm itself. In this sense, a technological paradigm entails strong prescriptions on the direction <b>of</b> <b>technological</b> <b>change,</b> that is the direction toward which future technical improvements will converge. Such gradual improvements along the specific lines prescribed by the paradigm are what constitute technological trajectories and progress.|$|E

40|$|The main aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} quantitatively the economic impacts of emissions stabilization scenarios with and without the inclusion <b>of</b> induced <b>technological</b> <b>change</b> (ITC). Improved <b>technological</b> innovations are triggered by increased R&D expenditures that advance energy efficiencies. Model results show that induced <b>technological</b> <b>changes</b> due to increased investment in R&D reduce compliance costs. Although R&D expenditures compete with other investment expenditures, we find that increased R&D expenditures improve energy efficiency which substantially lowers abatement costs. Without the inclusion <b>of</b> induced <b>technological</b> <b>change,</b> emissions targets are primarily reached by declines in production, resulting in overall welfare reductions. With the inclusion <b>of</b> induced <b>technological</b> <b>changes,</b> emissions mitigations can result in fewer production and GDP drawbacks.

25|$|North America {{has been}} {{inhabited}} continuously since approximately 10,000 BC. The earliest inhabitants were nomadic, big-game hunter-gatherers who crossed the Bering land bridge. These first Native Americans relied upon chipped-stone spearheads, rudimentary harpoons, and boats clad in animal hides for {{hunting in the}} Arctic. As they dispersed within the continent, they encountered the varied temperate climates in the Pacific northwest, central plains, Appalachian woodlands, and arid Southwest, where they began to make permanent settlements. The peoples living in the Pacific northwest built wooden houses, used nets and weirs to catch fish, and practiced food preservation to ensure longevity of their food sources, although substantial agriculture was not developed. Peoples living on the plains remained largely nomadic (some practiced agriculture for parts of the year) and became adept leather workers as they hunted buffalo while {{people living in the}} arid southwest built adobe buildings, fired pottery, domesticated cotton, and wove cloth. Tribes in the eastern woodlands and Mississippian Valley developed extensive trade networks, built pyramid-like mounds, and practiced substantial agriculture while the peoples living in the Appalachian Mountains and coastal Atlantic practiced highly sustainable forest agriculture and were expert woodworkers. However, the populations of these peoples were small and their rate <b>of</b> <b>technological</b> <b>change</b> was very low. Indigenous peoples did not domesticate animals for drafting or husbandry, develop writing systems, or create bronze or iron-based tools like their European/Asian counterparts.|$|E

Second, market signals can act by selecting ex post those applications of the affirmed paradigm (i.e. the final products) that best fit the market requests.

In particular, it has been claimed that traditional management accounting techniques are unable to satisfy the users of such techniques in terms of providing them with timely and detailed information. In response to this issue and to overcome the shortcomings of traditional management accounting techniques, activity based-costing (ABC) was introduced in 1980 s. However, despite the claimed benefits of ABC, the level of implementation of ABC is still lower than those of traditional management accounting techniques. Shedding light on this debate, current study first examines the level <b>of</b> association between <b>technological</b> <b>changes</b> in manufacturing practices and the level of implementation of ABC to see whether (or not) implementation <b>of</b> <b>technological</b> <b>changes</b> may lead to the implementation of ABC.
