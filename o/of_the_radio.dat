The fluctuations did not occur simultaneously along all of the observed wavelengths, which Jeremy Goodman of Princeton University explained as being the result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> waves being bent by interstellar plasma in the Milky Way. Such radio scintillations (rapid variations in the radio luminosity of an object) occur only when the source has an apparent diameter of less than 3microarcseconds.|$|E

5|$|In 1947, a {{prominent}} radio source was identified overlapping {{the location of}} M87, and this was labeled Virgo-A.

This jet extended from the core at a position angle of 260° to an angular distance of 20″ with an angular width of 2″. In 1969–70, a strong component <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> emission was found to closely align with the optical source of the jet.|$|E

5|$|Prime Minister Kỳ {{disapproved of}} Chuan's {{approach}} and replaced Chuan with Đính. Prime Minister Kỳ felt Đính's aggressive attitude following the Xá Lợi Pagoda raids in 1963 indicated {{a willingness to}} suppress Buddhist dissidents. Moreover, Đính {{was a native of}} central Vietnam and would have been popular with those who thought along parochial lines. Đính arrived in Huế on 15 April and, after a week, announced that he had restored Saigon's authority over the region. He proclaimed that he had regained control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> stations in Đà Nẵng and Huế from the dissidents, and that he had convinced the mayor of Đà Nẵng to remain loyal to Saigon. Đính announced a deal whereby the Buddhists would have regular air time in return for relinquishing control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> station. This move was interpreted in different ways. Some felt that Đính was attempting to gain favour with the Buddhists in anticipation of Kỳ's fall from power, while Frances FitzGerald felt it was the only sensible government action during the crisis. On 19 April, clashes erupted in Quảng Ngãi between the Buddhists and the VNQDĐ (Vietnamese Nationalist Party), which supported the continuation of the anti-communist war, prompting Đính to forcibly restrain the two groups.|$|E
