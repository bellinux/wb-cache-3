5|$|As is true {{for many}} species <b>of</b> <b>deer,</b> {{especially}} those in mountainous regions, elk migrate into areas of higher altitude in the spring, following the retreating snows, and the opposite direction in the fall. Hunting pressure also impacts migration and movements. During the winter, they favor wooded areas and sheltered valleys for protection from the wind and availability of tree bark to eat. Roosevelt elk are generally non-migratory due to less seasonal variability of food sources.|$|E
5|$|Munro also {{reported}} that, at the time, Rùm was highly forested, with an abundance <b>of</b> <b>deer.</b> Munro {{goes on to}} argue that the best way of slaying the deer would be when they are moving uphill (when gravity is against them), their principle home being in the heights. Contemporary with Munro, substantial stone walls were built in the glens to funnel deer into pens.|$|E
5|$|State Highway 74, usually {{abbreviated}} as SH-74 or OK-74 (or simply Highway 74) is the numbering of {{two different}} highways maintained by the U.S. state of Oklahoma.

5|$|The condor is {{primarily}} a scavenger, feeding on carrion. It prefers large carcasses, such as those <b>of</b> <b>deer</b> or cattle. It reaches sexual maturity at {{five or six years}} of age and nests at elevations of up to , generally on inaccessible rock ledges. One or two eggs are usually laid. It is one of the world's longest-living birds, with a lifespan of over 70 years in some cases.|$|E
5|$|The giraffe {{is one of}} {{only two}} living genera of the family Giraffidae in the order Artiodactyla, the other being the okapi. The family was once much more extensive, with over 10 fossil genera described. Their closest known {{relatives}} are the extinct deer-like climacocerids. They, together with the family Antilocapridae (whose only extant species is the pronghorn), belong to the superfamily Giraffoidea. These animals may have evolved from the extinct family Palaeomerycidae which might also have been the ancestor <b>of</b> <b>deer.</b>|$|E
5|$|The last sub-book of {{the text}} {{discusses}} recreation through horticulture {{and the art of}} creating gardens, painting, perfumery, architecture and the training and breeding of horses, elephants, lavakki (a type of quail), and other wildlife.

Other animals in the state include reptiles such as lizards, cobras, kraits, and gharials. During winter, large numbers of Siberian birds are reported in the sangam and nearby wetlands.|$|E
5|$|Along the routing of M-28, MDOT has {{established}} several roadside parks and rest areas. Two {{of these are}} in Ontonagon County near Ewen and Trout Creek. A park with a picnic area, and a footbridge lies near Tioga Creek in Baraga County east of the US41 junction. In Three Lakes a scenic turnout and a roadside park overlook Lake Michigamme, and along Lake Superior south of Marquette is a tourist information center built as a log cabin. East of the H-01 junction in Au Train is a roadside park that includes Scott Falls. Further east, a year-round rest area {{is located on the}} west end of the Seney Stretch. Three other roadside parks lie east of Harvey in Shelter Bay, on the shores <b>of</b> <b>Deer</b> Lake and west of Newberry.|$|E
5|$|For an {{ecosystem}} to support ticks, it must satisfy two requirements: the population density of host {{species in the}} area must be high enough, and humidity must be high enough for ticks to remain hydrated. Due to their role in transmitting Lyme disease, ixodid ticks, particularly the North American I.scapularis, have been studied using geographic information systems to develop predictive models for ideal tick habitats. According to these studies, certain features of a given microclimate – such as sandy soil, hardwood trees, rivers, and the presence <b>of</b> <b>deer</b> – were determined to be good predictors of dense tick populations.|$|E
40|$|Growing populations <b>of</b> white-tailed <b>deer</b> (Odocoileus virginianus) {{in urban}} areas often {{conflict}} with local human interests and present challenges to natural resource managers.

5|$|Forensics teams {{analyzed}} the DNA <b>of</b> <b>Deer</b> Island Jane to exclude some missing persons and {{in hopes of}} matching it to possible relatives of the girl whose DNA was on record. It was obtained through samples of hair and a tooth. The DNA did not match the profiles stored in databases of known missing persons. Officials stated that they also sent samples to the University of North Texas {{to create a more}} specific profile, a time-consuming process. Mitochondrial DNA from the bones of the child was later developed to compare to possible relatives.|$|E
5|$|Pendants, ear-rings, bangles, discs and combs {{from the}} Neolithic period were found. 400 bone tools, mostly used for hunting, made from antler and long bones <b>of</b> <b>deer</b> and cattle {{were found in}} Chirand and at Burzahom from Period II and Period III. Terracotta figurines {{included}} humped bulls, birds, snakes, and human female figurines. The snake figures are indicative of existence of Naga cult among the Neolithic people. The human female figurines possibly relate to either a mother goddess, a goddess of fertility, or both. Ornaments made from tortoise and ivory were also found. A painted motif of the sacred peepal leaf (Ficus religiosa) was found. A foot stand of large sarcophagus indicates mortuary rites of the Neolithic people.|$|E
5|$|Royal Stag, {{also known}} as Seagram's Royal Stag, is a brand of whisky {{launched}} in 1995.

5|$|Several {{species have}} been reintroduced to the gorge. White-tailed deer were {{imported}} from Michigan and released throughout Pennsylvania to reestablish {{what had once been}} a thriving population. The current population <b>of</b> <b>deer</b> in Pennsylvania are descended from the original stock introduced beginning in 1906, after the lumberman had moved out of the area. The deer population has grown so much that today they exceed their carrying capacity in many areas. River otters were successfully reintroduced in 1983 and now breed in the gorge. Despite the fears of anglers, their diet is only 5percent trout.|$|E
