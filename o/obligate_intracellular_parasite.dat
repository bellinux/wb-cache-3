50|$|Enterocytozoon bieneusi is {{a species}} of the order Microsporidia which infects the {{intestinal}} epithelial cells. It is an <b>obligate</b> <b>intracellular</b> <b>parasite.</b>|$|E
50|$|Completoria is a fungal genus in the {{monotypic}} family Completoriaceae, of {{the order}} Entomophthorales. Completoria is itself monotypic, containing a single species, Completoria complens. The species is rare, known only from greenhouse cultures where it grows as an <b>obligate</b> <b>intracellular</b> <b>parasite</b> of fern gametophytes.|$|E
50|$|Coccidia (Coccidiasina) are a {{subclass}} of microscopic, spore-forming, single-celled <b>obligate</b> <b>intracellular</b> <b>parasites</b> {{belonging to}} the apicomplexan class Conoidasida. As <b>obligate</b> <b>intracellular</b> <b>parasites,</b> they must live and reproduce within an animal cell. Coccidian parasites infect the intestinal tracts of animals, and are {{the largest group of}} apicomplexan protozoa.|$|R
50|$|<b>Obligate</b> <b>intracellular</b> <b>parasites</b> cannot {{reproduce}} {{outside their}} host cell, {{meaning that the}} parasite's reproduction is entirely reliant on intracellular resources.|$|R
50|$|Chlamydia is a genus of {{pathogenic}} {{bacteria that}} are <b>obligate</b> <b>intracellular</b> <b>parasites.</b> Chlamydia infections {{are the most}} common bacterial sexually transmitted diseases in humans and are the leading cause of infectious blindness worldwide.|$|R
50|$|Avipoxviruses {{like all}} viruses is an <b>obligate</b> <b>intracellular</b> <b>parasite.</b> It uses host {{translational}} machinery to replicate its genome. Avipoxviruses only infect birds, particularly wild fowl, {{and in this}} case wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo). Avipoxviruses are not able to complete their replication in non - avian species. Transmission of avipoxvirus occurs through a mosquito vector.|$|E
50|$|Moraxella bovis is a Gram-negative {{rod-shaped}} aerobe. This bacterium is an <b>obligate</b> <b>intracellular</b> <b>parasite</b> of the mucous membranes, and {{can usually}} be isolated from the respiratory tract, vagina, and conjunctiva of healthy animals. Transmission of IBK is through direct contact with mucous membranes and their secretions and indirect contact where flies act as a mechanical vector. Asymptomatic carrier animals can also be source of infection.|$|E
50|$|The team {{started with}} the {{bacterium}} M. genitalium, an <b>obligate</b> <b>intracellular</b> <b>parasite</b> whose genome consists of 482 genes comprising 582,970 base pairs, arranged on one circular chromosome (the smallest genome of any known natural organism that can be grown in free culture). They then systematically removed genes to find a minimal set of 382 genes that can sustain life. This effort was {{also known as the}} Minimal Genome Project.|$|E
50|$|Whether one regards viruses {{as living}} organisms or not, they cannot {{reproduce}} except {{by means of}} resources within living cells, and accordingly, it is convenient and customary to regard them as <b>obligate</b> <b>intracellular</b> <b>parasites.</b>|$|R
25|$|Plant viruses are {{viruses that}} affect plants. Like all other viruses, plant viruses are <b>obligate</b> <b>intracellular</b> <b>parasites</b> {{that do not}} have the {{molecular}} machinery to replicate without a host. Plant viruses are pathogenic to higher plants.|$|R
50|$|Viruses, as <b>obligate</b> <b>intracellular</b> <b>parasites,</b> have {{to involve}} {{specific}} interaction of virus and cellular receptor expressed at the plasma membrane {{in order to}} enter cells. Accumulated evidence supports that viruses enter cells via penetration of specific membrane microdomains, including lipid rafts.|$|R
50|$|It was {{not until}} 1937 that the first {{detailed}} scientific analysis of T. gondii took place using techniques previously developed for analyzing viruses. In 1937 Sabin and Olitsky analyzed T. gondii in laboratory monkeys and mice. Sabin and Olitsky showed that T. gondii was an <b>obligate</b> <b>intracellular</b> <b>parasite</b> and that mice fed T. gondii-contaminated tissue also contracted the infection. Thus Sabin and Olitsky demonstrated T. gondii as a pathogen transmissible between animals.|$|E
5000|$|Encephalitozoon cuniculi is a {{eukaryotic}} organism {{belonging to the}} phylum Microsporidia, in the kingdom Fungi. An <b>obligate</b> <b>intracellular</b> <b>parasite,</b> E. cuniculi occurs in laboratory mice and rabbits, monkeys, dogs, rats, birds, guinea pigs, and other mammals including humans. [...] At various early times it was {{thought it was the}} cause of rabies and polio. This parasite may be transmitted in body exudates or transplacentally. Although damages are minimal, an infection can be fatal, especially in immunocompromised individuals such as AIDS patients.|$|E
50|$|It was {{discovered}} in 1873 by the Norwegian physician Gerhard Armauer Hansen, who was searching for the bacteria in the skin nodules of patients with leprosy. It was the first bacterium {{to be identified as}} causing disease in humans. The organism has never been successfully grown on an artificial cell culture medium. Instead, it has been grown in mouse foot pads and more recently in nine-banded armadillos because they, like humans, are susceptible to leprosy. This {{can be used as a}} diagnostic test for the presence of bacilli in body lesions of suspected leprosy patients. The difficulty in culturing the organism appears to be because it is an <b>obligate</b> <b>intracellular</b> <b>parasite</b> that lacks many necessary genes for independent survival. The complex and unique cell wall that makes members of the Mycobacterium genus difficult to destroy is apparently also the reason for the extremely slow replication rate.|$|E

30|$|Viruses are <b>obligate</b> <b>intracellular</b> <b>parasites</b> and are {{not living}} entities; consequently, they are not {{directly}} involved in nutrient metabolism. Smith and Schindler (2009) demonstrated that increased nitrogen and phosphorus availability enhances the replication rate of aquatic viruses (cyanophage infection in the oceanic Cyanobacterium synechococcus).|$|R
50|$|<b>Obligate</b> <b>intracellular</b> <b>parasites</b> (e.g. Chlamydophila, Ehrlichia, Rickettsia) {{have the}} ability to only grow and {{replicate}} inside other cells. Even these intracellular infections may be asymptomatic, requiring an incubation period. An example of this is Rickettsia which causes typhus. Another causes Rocky Mountain spotted fever.|$|R
50|$|The {{reasons behind}} the {{resistance}} to malaria become clear when given an explanation {{the way in which}} Plasmodium falciparum invades its host. This parasite is an <b>obligate</b> <b>intracellular</b> <b>parasite,</b> which must enter the cells of the host it is invading. The band 3 proteins aggregate on the cell membrane at the site of entry, forming a circular orifice that the parasite squeezes through. These band 3 proteins act as receptors for the parasite. Normally a process much like endocytosis occurs, and the parasite is able to isolate itself from the intracellular proteins that are toxic to it while still being inside an erythrocyte (see figure 2). The increased rigidity of the erythrocyte membrane in SAO is thought to reduce the capacity of the band 3 proteins to cluster together, thereby making it more difficult for the malaria parasite to properly attaching to and enter the cell. The reduced free ATP within the cell has been postulated as a further mechanism behind which SAO creates a hostile environment for Plasmodium falciparum.|$|E

50|$|Phages are <b>obligate</b> <b>intracellular</b> <b>parasites</b> {{meaning that}} they are able to {{reproduce}} only while infecting bacteria. Phages therefore are found only within environments that contain bacteria. Most environments contain bacteria, including our own bodies (called normal flora).

40|$|Leishmania major is an <b>obligate</b> <b>intracellular</b> <b>parasite</b> {{hosted by}} phagocytes, {{including}} dendritic cells (DCs). Lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) a pro-oxidant by-product of phospholipase A 2 activity can modulate the maturation {{and function of}} DCs. However, {{little is known about}} its role in L. major infection. This study examined the effects of LPC and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in BALB/c mouse-derived DC infection by L. major promastigotes, in vitro. Our results showed early divergent effects of LPS and LPC, which lasted up to 24 h. In contrast to LPS, LPC worsened DC infection by reversing the immune balance IL- 10 vs. TNF-α and IL- 6, and inducing a sharp down regulation of CD 40 and iNOsynthase activity. In addition, LPC potentiated xanthine oxidase stress, the production of kynurenine by indoleamine 2, 3 dioxygenase (IDO), and arginase 1 activity in the expense of iNOsynthase. Taken together, our results highlight some biochemical events bypassing the protective Th 1 response. They suggest that LPC could facilitate the proliferation of this <b>obligate</b> <b>intracellular</b> <b>parasite</b> by neutralizing oxidative and nitrosative stresses and sustaining both IDO and arginase 1 activities.

50|$|All Ehrlichia sp. are <b>obligate</b> <b>intracellular</b> <b>parasites</b> {{that are}} {{transmitted}} by ticks to vertebrate animals; Ehrlichia ewingii is specifically transmitted by the North American Tick, Amblyomma americanum. This bacterium then infects granulocytes in canines and humans. Currently, Ehrlichia ewingii cannot be cultivated {{in a number}} of cell lines, meaning that study of this organism is dependent on extraction from arthropod and vertebrate hosts.|$|R
50|$|Viruses {{are known}} to infect both plant cells and animal cells. Since viruses are <b>obligate</b> <b>intracellular</b> <b>parasites</b> they must develop direct methods of transmission, between hosts, in order to survive. The {{mobility}} of animals increases the mechanisms of viral transmission that have evolved, whereas plants remain immobile and thus plant viruses must rely on environmental factors to be transmitted between hosts.|$|R
40|$|The fate of an {{intracellular}} pathogen in mononuclear phagocytes {{appears to}} be an important determinant of the capacity of the pathogen to cause disease. Antibody against the pathogen can markedly alter the intracellular fate of the pathogen in mononuclear phagocytes; such an effect of antibody is reflected in vivo by enhanced resistance to infection of animals that have been passively immunized with hyperimmune serum. Under these conditions, the specific immunity expressed by these animals results from the presence of antibody and not from the presence of antigensensitive leukocytes. For example, antibody inhibited the intracellular multiplication of the <b>obligate</b> <b>intracellular</b> <b>parasite</b> Rickettsia mooseri in cultured human monocytes and rendered the organism susceptible to killing by these monocytes (1); paralleling this in vivo, the same antibody protected passively immunized mice against an otherwise lethal infection from R. mooseri ([1]; and C. L. Wisseman, Jr. Personal communication.). Similarly, human and mouse antitoxoplasma antibody rendered the <b>obligate</b> <b>intracellular</b> <b>parasite</b> Toxoplasma gondii incapable of multiplying in cultured human monocytes (2) and mouse peritoneal macrophages (3), respectively...|$|E

5|$|Each {{species of}} {{pathogen}} has a characteristic spectrum of interactions with its human hosts. Some organisms, such as Staphylococcus or Streptococcus, can cause skin infections, pneumonia, meningitis and even overwhelming sepsis, a systemic inflammatory response producing shock, massive vasodilation and death. Yet these organisms are {{also part of}} the normal human flora and usually exist on the skin or in the nose without causing any disease at all. Other organisms invariably cause disease in humans, such as the Rickettsia, which are <b>obligate</b> <b>intracellular</b> <b>parasites</b> able to grow and reproduce only within the cells of other organisms. One species of Rickettsia causes typhus, while another causes Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Chlamydia, another phylum of <b>obligate</b> <b>intracellular</b> <b>parasites,</b> contains species that can cause pneumonia, or urinary tract infection and may be involved in coronary heart disease. Finally, some species, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cenocepacia, and Mycobacterium avium, are opportunistic pathogens and cause disease mainly in people suffering from immunosuppression or cystic fibrosis.|$|R
