5000|$|Once {{separated}} and purified of any contaminants and impurities, the fuel or lubricant {{can be sold}} without further processing. Smaller molecules such as isobutane and propylene or butylenes can be recombined to meet specific octane requirements by processes such as alkylation, or more commonly, dimerization. The <b>octane</b> <b>grade</b> of gasoline can also be improved by catalytic reforming, which involves removing hydrogen from hydrocarbons producing compounds with higher octane ratings such as aromatics. Intermediate products such as gasoils can even be reprocessed to break a heavy, long-chained oil into a lighter short-chained one, by various forms of cracking such as fluid catalytic cracking, thermal cracking, and hydrocracking. The final step in gasoline production is the blending of fuels with different octane ratings, vapor pressures, and other properties to meet product specifications. Another method for reprocessing and upgrading these intermediate products (residual oils) uses a [...] process to separate usable oil from the waste asphaltene material.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the start}} of the war the Luftwaffe {{standardized}} on 87 octane aviation gasoline, called [...] "B-4", made from leaded hydro-petrol extracted from brown coal. In 1940 an improved fuel, designated [...] "C-2" [...] was introduced having a higher aromatic content of 35-38% and giving performance equivalent to Allied 100 <b>octane</b> <b>grade</b> of that time. C-2 was used in small quantities by aircraft such as the Messerschmitt Bf 109E-4/N and E-7/N and the Messerschmitt Bf 110C when equipped with the DB 601N engine, that entered series production in October 1939. The power was increased by 20% over that of the DB 601A, to 1,260 hp at 6,900 feet (2,100 m) at 1.35 atm boost pressure and 2,400 rpm. By July, nine Bf 110 and three Bf 109 fighter Staffeln (squadrons) were equipped with the new engines, By the end of October around 1,200 DB 601N engines had been delivered. and the number of aircraft equipped with the improved engine gradually increased through the second half of the year. However, due to leaking valves there was relatively high wear on the 601N-engines, which had a life of about 40 hours.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{states do}} not mandate certain {{standard}} gasoline <b>grade</b> <b>octane</b> ratings. In the United States and Canada, octane ratings are in AKI, commonly shown as [...] "(R+M)/2". All states require gas pump to be labeled with the correct octane level and nearly all states do regular testing to make sure gas stations are in compliance. A minimum 87 octane fuel is recommend for most vehicles produced since 1984. Older cars with carburetors could operate with lower octane fuel at higher elevations. Regardless of legality fuel with an octane rating of less than 87 is generally not offered for sale in most states. However 85 and 86 octane gasoline can still commonly be found in several rocky mountain states.|$|R
40|$|Most gas {{stations}} in the Netherlands offer three types of gasoline: Euro (unleaded, low <b>octane</b> <b>grade),</b> Superplus (unleaded, high <b>octane</b> <b>grade),</b> and Super (leaded, high <b>octane</b> <b>grade).</b> Depending {{on the type of}} the car, many car drivers can choose between two or three types of gasoline. According to the oil-companies, many car drivers still fuel leaded gasoline, while their car is appropriate for unleaded gasoline. This led the Transportation and Traffic Research Division of the Dutch Ministry of Transport and Public Works to initiate a study of gasoline choice behaviour among car drivers. The aim of this study is three-fold: A: to gain insight into the knowledge and opinions of car drivers about some aspects related to the choice of gasoline, B: to gain insight into the discrepancy between objective and subjective choice sets (types of gasoline), C: to gain insight into the gasoline choice behaviour of car drivers. A sample of about 700 car drivers were asked to fill out a questionnaire, just after refueling their car. The survey was conducted at 10 {{gas stations}} in the Randstad region of the Netherlands. Five gas stations were located along a national highway, while the other stations were located within the built-up area of some cities. The results of the survey revealed some differences between car drivers refueling along a highway and car drivers refueling within the built - up area. The observed market shares for the three types of gasoline are about 40 % (Euro), 20 % (Superplus), and 40 % (Super). The main reason for choosing a particular type of gasoline is because the chosen type of gasoline is recommended by the car manufacturer or because respondents think it is the best alternative for their car. It should be noted, however, that many respondents are not well informed about the technical possibilities of their car. Fifty percent of the respondents appeared to be unaware of all types of gasoline that are suitable for their car. This is especially the case for Superplus gasoline (unleaded, high <b>octane</b> <b>grade).</b> Many respondents don't know the price of the chosen gasoline exactly, however, most respondents agree about the most (Super) and least (Euro) expensive type of gasoline. Furthermore, according to the majority of the respondents, Euro gasoline causes less damage to the environment than other types of gasoline. About a quarter of the cars is equipped with a catalytic converter. The main motive for buying such a car was to decrease air pollution by traffic. A notable number of respondents has no knowledge about the expected duration of life and the solidity of catalytic converters. A simple choice model was used to get insight into the fuel choice behaviour of car drivers. Based on the observed choice behaviour of 150 respondents, a multinomial logit model was estimated. The model contained two variables describing the types of gasoline: leaded vs unleaded and <b>octane</b> <b>grade</b> (high vs low). The estimated parameters indicate that the car drivers prefer unleaded to leaded gasoline and (to a less extent) low <b>octane</b> <b>grade</b> to high <b>octane</b> <b>grade</b> gasoline. The model performed well, the discrepancy between predicted and observed market shares was small. Unfortunately, it was impossible to determine the role of prices in the process of decision making, because the price variable appeared to be strongly correlated with the leaded/unleaded and <b>octane</b> <b>grade</b> variables. The preference for unleaded gasoline benefits the environment. Hence, gasoline choice behaviour need not be adjusted. However, it is recommended to improve car drivers' knowledge about the possibilities of their car. Still many car drivers select leaded gasoline because they (incorrectly) suppose that there is no suitable alternative...|$|E
40|$|Although {{automobile}} refueling {{represents the}} major source of benzene exposure among the nonsmoking public, few data are available regarding such exposures and the associated uptake of benzene. We repeatedly measured benzene exposure and uptake (via benzene in exhaled breath) among 39 self-service customers using self-administered monitoring, a technique rarely used to obtain measurements from the general public (130 sets of measurements were obtained). Benzene exposures averaged 2. 9 mg/m 3 (SD = 5. 8 mg/m 3; median duration = 3 min) with a range of < 0. 076 – 36 mg/m 3, and postexposure breath levels averaged 160 µg/m 3 (SD = 260 µg/m 3) with a range of < 3. 2 – 1, 400 µg/m 3. Log-transformed exposures and breath levels were significantly correlated (r = 0. 77, p < 0. 0001). We used mixed-effects statistical models to gauge the relative influences of environmental and subject-specific factors on benzene exposure and breath levels and to investigate the importance of various covariates obtained by questionnaire. Model fitting yielded three significant predictors of benzene exposure, namely, fuel <b>octane</b> <b>grade</b> (p = 0. 0011), duration of exposure (p = 0. 0054), and season of the year (p = 0. 032). Likewise, another model yielded three significant predictors of benzene concentration in breath, specifically, benzene exposure (p = 0. 0001), preexposure breath concentration (p = 0. 0008), and duration of exposure (p = 0. 038).
