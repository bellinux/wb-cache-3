5|$|Between 1936–1955 the City of Denver {{used the}} Chicago and North Western Railway between Chicago and Omaha. After 1955 it used the Milwaukee Road. The train's Union Pacific route west of Omaha {{remained}} unchanged for the duration. The train followed the Overland Route from Omaha to Julesburg, where it diverged southwest for Denver. In March 1950 {{it made the}} following stops west of Omaha: Columbus, Grand Island, Kearney, and North Platte in Nebraska and Julesburg in Colorado. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>C</b> it made the following stops west of Chicago, all in Iowa: Cedar Rapids, Ames, Boone, and Council Bluffs. The westbound train departed Chicago's Chicago and North Western Terminal at 5:00 PM and arrived at Denver's Union Station at 8:30 AM the following morning.|$|E
5|$|Amid strong resistance, the Australians {{were made}} to fight {{their way through the}} maze of bunkers, punji stakes and booby traps but they were {{eventually}} able to force a Viet Cong regional force company to withdraw as they continued their advance. The area was heavily seeded with trip wires connected to shells and grenades dangling from branches, one of which blew McFarlane and several of his men off their feet. The defenders subsequently withdrew, with 7th Cu Chi Battalion forced north and 3rd Quyet Thang Battalion to the east. Suspecting they were being drawn into a trap—as one of the American battalions of the brigade had been previously during Operation Hump—the Australians moved into a tightly defended perimeter before dark and waited for the communists to counter-attack. As night fell, movement was detected along a trench <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>C</b> Company perimeter when a squad of Viet Cong attempted to infiltrate the Australian position. Initially believing the movement to be another Australian patrol that had just departed on a clearing patrol, the machine-gunner on sentry duty finally opened fire at the last safe moment, killing one of the infiltrators at point-blank range and wounding a number of others before they withdrew.|$|E

25|$|There {{were two}} designs used <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>C</b> Canal locks: the 1828 {{design and the}} 1830 design. Locks 1-27 (with the {{exception}} of lock 13) are to the older 1828 design, and locks 13 and 28-75 are of the 1830 design.|$|E
25|$|The 1830 design {{eliminated}} {{the use of}} culverts in the masonry, and the upper gate is below the breast wall. The advantage {{here is that the}} lock can fill faster with the wickets being in the gate, but will not swamp a boat in the lock chamber. In the 1830 design locks, the upper and lower gates are both the same height. The majority of locks <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>C</b> canal are to this specification.|$|E
25|$|The loop must both {{begin at}} the anchor on the N side and end at the anchor <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>C</b> side. Each loop must {{therefore}} be tested to see if its last few residues overlap with the C terminal anchor. Very few of these exponential numbers of candidate loops will close the loop. After filtering out loops that don't close, one must then determine which loop has the optimal configuration, as determined by having the lowest energy using some molecular mechanics force field.|$|E

25|$|Mathematically, c and g {{are both}} {{variables}} summarizing positive correlations among different tasks supposing that performance on one task is comparable with performance on other similar tasks. c thus {{is a source}} of variance among groups and can only be considered as a group's standing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>c</b> factor compared to other groups in a given relevant population.

25|$|Positions with doubled pawns {{are usually}} a draw if the {{defending}} king {{can get in}} front of the pawns. If the defending king cannot {{get in front of}} the pawns, the outcome depends on which file the pawns are on and where the defending king is cut off. If the defending king is cut off by more than one file, the pawns win, except if they are rook pawns. If the pawns are <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>c</b> through f file then they win if the opposing king is cut off by one file (or more) on the long side, otherwise they draw.|$|E

25|$|In the 2006 book Steel Drivin' Man: John Henry, the Untold Story of an American Legend, Scott Reynolds Nelson, an {{associate}} {{professor of history at the}} College of William & Mary, contends that the John Henry of the ballad was based on a different real person, the 20-year-old New Jersey-born African-American freeman, John William Henry. Nelson speculates that Henry, like many African Americans might have come to Virginia to work on the clean-up of the battlefields after the Civil War. Arrested and tried for burglary, he was among the many convicts released by the warden to work as leased labor <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>C</b> Railway.|$|E

25|$|In {{the case}} of ODBC, the drivers {{encapsulate}} many functions that {{can be broken down}} into several broad categories. One set of functions is primarily concerned with finding, connecting to and disconnecting from the DBMS that driver talks to. A second set is used to send SQL commands from the ODBC system to the DBMS, converting or interpreting any commands that are not supported internally. For instance, a DBMS that does not support cursors can emulate this functionality in the driver. Finally, another set of commands, mostly used internally, is used to convert data from the DBMS's internal formats to a set of standardized ODBC formats, which are based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>C</b> language formats.|$|E

25|$|At {{the same}} time, over in Virginia, in 1905, {{with the land}} and route secured, {{construction}} got underway on the Tidewater Railway, which as it turned out, went nowhere near its headquarters in Staunton <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>C</b> Instead, it started building an alignment which would match up amazingly well with the Deepwater Railway near Glen Lyn, and run almost parallel to the N & W {{all the way to}} Norfolk. By the time the larger railroads finally realized what was happening, and that Page was involved in both the Deepwater and Tidewater Railways, their new competitor could not be successfully blocked on the basis of right-of-way. The building of another major railroad from the mountains-to-the-sea seemed to have been set in motion. Completion, however, was still far from assured.|$|E
25|$|In 1828, {{construction}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>C</b> Canal commenced and {{was completed}} in 1850. Laborers were. primarily Irish immigrants Throughout the 19th century, agriculture dominated the economy in Montgomery County, with slaves playing a significant role, though {{the vast majority of}} farmers owned 10 slaves or less rather than large plantations. In {{the first half of the}} 19th century, low tobacco prices and worn-out soil caused many tobacco farms to be abandoned. Crop production gradually shifted away from tobacco and toward wheat and corn. Prior to the Civil War, Montgomery County allied itself with other slaveholding counties in southern Maryland and the Eastern Shore. Montgomery County was important in the abolitionist movement, especially among the Quakers in the northern part of the county near Sandy Spring. Josiah Henson grew up as a slave on the Riley farm south of Rockville. He wrote about his experiences in a memoir which became the basis for Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852). A slave cabin where he is believed to have spent time still stands at the end of a driveway off Old Georgetown Road.|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} of the then five-times-a-month dieselized streamliner City of San Francisco in 1936 began the relegation of the Overland to secondary status on the Overland Route. By January, 1955 the train was a shell of its former self carrying only two Chicago–Oakland through cars and ceased operation <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>C</b> altogether on October 30, 1955. While the UP the dropped any Overland designation from its service in 1956, the SP held out for another six years retaining the name San Francisco Overland for trains 27 and 28 between San Francisco and Ogden until that last vestige of the line's original 1899 Overland Limited as a separate named train providing year-round daily service ended on July 16, 1962. On that date the ICC's recent order (Docket #21946) approving of its discontinuation and consolidation with the City of San Francisco went into effect and new Overland Route schedules were instituted. The Overland continued only as titular seasonal summer and holiday service consolidated with the City of San Francisco except when run as an occasional second section if heavy seasonal traffic warranted until January 2, 1964 after which the Overland name disappeared forever from the route. The SP declined to revive the train's name in 1964 amid some controversy.|$|E
