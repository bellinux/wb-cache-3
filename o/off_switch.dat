25|$|Multiple {{states have}} pending body-worn camera {{legislation}} that require its {{law enforcement to}} be equipped with body-worn cameras when the officers are on duty. Some of these states include California, Washington, and Illinois, among others. Body-worn cameras are video recording devices around three inches long that cost between $129-$900. There are different body-worn camera models, but a standard body-worn camera includes an on and <b>off</b> <b>switch</b> that enables the image capturing technology to record and store data in the cloud.|$|E
25|$|There are depletion-mode MOSFET devices, {{which are}} less {{commonly}} used {{than the standard}} enhancement-mode devices already described. These are MOSFET devices that are doped so that a channel exists even with zero voltage from gate to source. To control the channel, a negative voltage {{is applied to the}} gate (for an n-channel device), depleting the channel, which reduces the current flow through the device. In essence, the depletion-mode device is equivalent to a normally closed (on) switch, while the enhancement-mode device is equivalent to a normally open (<b>off)</b> <b>switch.</b> Due to their low noise figure in the RF region, and better gain, these devices are often preferred to bipolars in RF front-ends such as in TV sets. Depletion-mode MOSFET families include BF960 by Siemens and Telefunken, and the BF980 in the 1980s by Philips (later to become NXP Semiconductors), whose derivatives are still used in AGC and RF mixer front-ends.|$|E

25|$|There are {{a variety}} of router styles, some are plunge, some are D handled, some are double knob handled. Different {{manufacturers}} produce the routers for different wood works, as Plunge Routers, Fixed Base Wood Routers, Combo Routers, Variable speed Routers, Laminate Trimmer, CNC Wood Routers. Nowadays, most better quality routers have variable speed controls and will have plunge bases that can also be locked in place so the router can also be used as a fixed base router. Some have a soft-start feature, meaning they build up speed gradually. This feature is particularly desirable for routers with a large cutter. Holding a 3 horse-power router and turning it on without a soft-start is potentially dangerous, due to the torque of the motor. Holding it with two hands is a must. For routers with a toggle type on / <b>off</b> <b>switch</b> it is important to check to verify the switch is in the off position, prior to plugging it in. For safety, larger router cutters can usually only be used in a router that is mounted in a router table, this makes the tool even more versatile and stable.|$|E

40|$|We study cluster cluster {{aggregation}} and fragmentation with a periodically modulated binding rate. Using the Smoluchowski mean field equations, we derive exact {{solutions for}} the cluster size distribution for two time courses of the binding rate i harmonic modulations and ii on <b>off</b> <b>switching</b> of the binding rate with dwell times b and f. In both cases, the asymptotic cluster size distribution is oscillatory in time. The formation of small sized clusters is enhanced compared to a constant binding rate below a critical cluster size sc. There is another critical cluster size sp close to which the size distribution becomes quasistationary. We calculate analytically the dependence of the critical points sc and sp on the relevant system parameters for on <b>off</b> <b>switching</b> of the binding rate.

30|$|Based on some careful {{studies and}} {{extensive}} experiments, recently A. Dixit et al. proposed a packet-level traffic splitting scheme named RPS (Random Packet Spraying) [11] for data center networks. RPS achieves near ideal load balance and network utilization, and causes little packet reordering by exploiting the symmetry of the multi-rooted tree topologies. Noticing that THS’s strategy of powering <b>off</b> <b>switches</b> barely affects the symmetry {{of the network}} since we always choose the leftmost switches. Therefore, after obtaining the required subset and adding FT-redundancy, we directly borrow the packet-level RPS multipath routing scheme to spread all flows equally among multiple different equal cost shortest paths. Then <b>switch</b> <b>off</b> the <b>switches</b> and ports which {{are not involved in}} final subset and update the network topology. The whole THS procedure is depicted in detail in Algorithm 2.|$|R
