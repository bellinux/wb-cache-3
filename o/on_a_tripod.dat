5|$|The {{work was}} carried out in an empty room of Okada's house where their {{business}} was also operated. While other people were present, the work was shared and Anno, Akai and Yamaga worked full-time on the production, the direction was not professional, but Takeada attributed Okada as the producer, with Yamaga directing, Akai doing character animation and Anno as the mecha animator. Takeada also said other individuals were involved and were used to trace cels or paint cels as needed, but still credits Yamaga, Akai and Anno with the production itself. Filming was done by a camera <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>tripod</b> and frames were called out by Anno because the production lacked timing sheets.|$|E
25|$|The term is {{also used}} in Norwegian. Although spelled {{slightly}} differently as mitraljøse, the pronunciation is similar. In Norway, the term nowadays is {{used to refer to}} a machine gun (the MG3, labeled as mitr-3, to be specific) mounted <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>tripod.</b> This is similar to the German term Schweres Maschinengewehr, which refers to a regular machine gun mounted <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>tripod</b> (since the introduction of General purpose machine guns).|$|E
25|$|The scholar Martin Litchfield West {{writes that}} the Pythia shows many traits of shamanistic practices, likely {{inherited}} or influenced from Central Asian practices, {{although there is no}} evidence of any Central Asian association at this time.

25|$|The {{earliest}} butter {{would have}} been from sheep or goat's milk; cattle are not {{thought to have been}} domesticated for another thousand years. An ancient method of butter making, still used today in parts of Africa and the Near East, involves a goat skin half filled with milk, and inflated with air before being sealed. The skin is then hung with ropes <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>tripod</b> of sticks, and rocked until the movement leads to the formation of butter.|$|E
25|$|In many cases, however, these assertions did not apply. On several occasions, the Brazilian ISI process, which {{occurred}} from 1930 {{until the end}} of the 1980s, involved currency devaluation as a means of boosting exports and discouraging imports (thus promoting the consumption of locally manufactured products), as well as the adoption of different exchange rates for importing capital goods and for importing consumer goods. Moreover, government policies toward investment were not always opposed to foreign capital: the Brazilian industrialization process was based <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>tripod</b> which involved governmental, private, and foreign capital, the first being directed to infrastructure and heavy industry, the second to manufacturing consumer goods, and the third, to the production of durable goods (such as automobiles). Volkswagen, Ford, GM, and Mercedes all established production facilities in Brazil in the 1950s and 1960s.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to fulfilling President Kennedy's mandate {{to land a}} man on the Moon {{before the end of the}} 1960s, Apollo 11 was an engineering test of the Apollo system; therefore, Armstrong snapped photos of the LM so engineers would be able to judge its post-landing condition. He removed the TV camera from the MESA and made a panoramic sweep, then mounted it <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>tripod</b> [...] from the LM. The TV camera cable remained partly coiled and presented a tripping hazard throughout the EVA.|$|E

500|$|The social {{networking}} site developed for the pit project is inspired by sites like MySpace and Facebook, which were extremely popular when the episode was first broadcast. Leslie makes a public apology to all female government officials in alphabetical order, starting with Minnesota Republican Rep. Michele Bachmann, Wisconsin Democratic Rep. Tammy Baldwin (Democrat, Wisconsin) and Illinois Democratic Rep. Melissa Bean. On her desk, Leslie has framed photos of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. The apology scene was filmed with the camera <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>tripod,</b> something seldom done in the documentary-style series. An online game of Scrabble is visible {{on the computer screen}} in Ron's office during one scene. It is exactly the same Scrabble game he had been playing with Tom in the previous episode, [...] "The Reporter". While preparing Leslie for her ethics board review, Tom asks if she has ever fantasized about Ron [...] "covered in Powerade". This is a reference to commercials for the sports drink, in which athletes sweat the multi-colored liquid while working out.|$|E
500|$|The video premiered on June 28, 2008 on ABC. It was {{the most}} watched music-related video on YouTube until it was surpassed by Lady Gaga's [...] "Bad Romance" [...] music video in Spring 2010. Todd Martens of The Los Angeles Times was {{disappointed}} with the video's special effects and production values, adding that it looked [...] "as if it were filmed with one camera <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>tripod</b> in a single-bulb basement". However, he complimented how they [...] "show off Miley's universal appeal". Henry Freeland of Paste magazine said, [...] "Cyrus wiggles to and fro, mugging for the camera like her face is fighting gravity and barely winning." [...] A Pop Cultured review from MTV described the video as PG and [...] "Disney approved". The review continued that it was mildly angry, comparing Cyrus to [...] "a watered-down version of Avril Lavigne's kid sister, and Lindsay Lohan's pseudo-rebellious character in Freaky Friday [...] minus the eyeliner". Leigh Holmwood of The Guardian commented, [...] "Miley's new music vid, reminds me, creepily enough, of early Britney." [...] Molly Lambert of the New York Times described Cyrus as the video's [...] "charismatic center" [...] and writes, [...] "When she flashes Nick’s dog tags {{and a picture of}} the two of them together, she seems so vindictive and so embarrassingly vulnerable, just like [...] [...] [...] a 15-year-old suffering her first serious heartbreak, basically." [...] The video received a nomination for MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards, but lost to Tokio Hotel's music video for [...] "Ready, Set, Go!". At the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, the video received a nomination for MTV Video Music Award for Best Editing, but lost to Beyoncé Knowles' music video for [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)".|$|E

2500|$|Attempting {{to focus}} on believability rather than action and gore, Peli chose to shoot the picture with a home video camera. In {{deciding}} on a more raw and stationary format (the camera was almost always sitting <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>tripod</b> or something else) and {{eliminating the need for}} a camera crew, a [...] "higher degree of plausibility" [...] was created for the audience as they were [...] "more invested in the story and the characters". Peli says that the dialogue was [...] "natural" [...] because there was no real script. Instead, the actors were given outlines of the story and situations to improvise, a technique known as [...] "retroscripting" [...] also used in the making of The Blair Witch Project. In casting the movie, Peli auditioned [...] "a few hundred people" [...] before finally meeting Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat. He originally auditioned them individually and later called them back to audition together. Peli was impressed with the chemistry between the actors, saying, [...] "If you saw the [...] footage, you would've thought they had known each other for years." [...] During a guest appearance on The Jay Leno Show on November 3, 2009, Sloat and Featherston explained they each saw the casting call on LACasting. Featherston noted they were originally paid $500 for their work.|$|E
