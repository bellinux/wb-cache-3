5|$|To avoid confusion, present-day {{names of}} <b>opponents</b> <b>are</b> used throughout. Each club's former names (if any) {{are given in}} this list's footnotes.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is played}} from a third person {{perspective}} with the camera at a variable height and capable of rotating 360°, enabling the player to quickly move across the planet's terrain. While the terrain's topology is a torus, the map is locally projected onto a sphere to give {{the illusion of a}} planet. On maps where there is no fog of war, players can see what <b>opponents</b> <b>are</b> doing at any time. Extensive support for 3D acceleration enables the player to view the game in 16-bit or 32-bit colour. The landscape and real-time structure building and follower movement are also shown.|$|E
5|$|With the {{exception}} of Ascension, each installment offers a challenge mode, which yields extra red orbs, secret costumes, and behind-the-scenes videos. Bonus content can also be unlocked by defeating the game's difficulty levels. Battle arenas, which allow players to set difficulty levels and choose their own <b>opponents,</b> <b>are</b> included in God of War II, God of War III, and Ghost of Sparta. A quick-time sex mini-game is also included in each installment except Betrayal and Ascension.|$|E

50|$|During {{the regular}} season, teams only played {{the other teams}} in their division. Each <b>opponent</b> <b>was</b> played twice, once at home and once away, {{for a total of}} 34 matches. Games were {{scheduled}} such that in the first 17 matches, every <b>opponent</b> <b>was</b> played once. In the last 17 matches, the same <b>opponents</b> <b>were</b> played in the same order with the only difference being that the venue changed.|$|R
5|$|Although today our <b>opponents</b> <b>are</b> at the Rhine {{and at the}} Oder, I do {{not believe}} yet {{that there will be}} a coup brought about by the German people. Without {{assistance}} from outside, such a coup is not even to be considered. Only the armed forces would be able to make a conclusive coup. But the prominent officers know, as well as the party officials, that a lost war will sweep them out of power. Therefore, the war continues until the possibility of it continuing any further is brought to an end. The Allies must continue to advance and fight until the German troops have no more ammunition and war material with which to offer resistance.|$|E
5|$|Kyo is an overconfident but well-meaning person, more {{interested}} in enjoying life than taking on responsibilities. He is quick to dismiss subjects that do not interest him and will often carry out his actions with a devil-may-care attitude. He treasures his friends and family, enjoying their presence and particularly dotes on his girlfriend, Yuki. His strong sense of justice and zeal to fight stronger <b>opponents</b> <b>are</b> what he believes drives him {{to carry out his}} destiny. Kyo enters most of The King of Fighters tournaments representing the Japanese team along with teammates Benimaru Nikaido and Goro Daimon. In his fights he uses the clan's martial art style, the , attacking opponents using flames along with several hits. In later series' tournaments he would combine fire with a personal style of kenpō.|$|E
5|$|The {{exact number}} of {{casualties}} is unknown. There are different numbers that each derive from different investigations that used different definitions of what a victim in this case should be. Therefore, the numbers are hardly comparable. On top of that, some results are published infrequently or investigations were ceased with a provisional number. There is also a publicly held controversy between two groups regarding the number of victims. The <b>opponents</b> <b>are</b> the Arbeitsgemeinschaft 13. August and the ZZF. The former's numbers are higher, as they include, according to ZZF's Hans-Hermann Hertle, victims with an unclear or unsure connection to the border regime. After the ZZF published its interim results in August 2006, Alexandra Hildebrandt of the Arbeitsgemeinschaft has accused them of withholding numbers to invoke a more positive picture of East Germany. She argues that the ZZF project was funded {{by a coalition of}} social democrats and leftists.|$|E

50|$|In the 2002 season, the Chiefs' non-divisional, conference <b>opponents</b> <b>were</b> {{primarily}} from the AFC East. The Cleveland Browns were from the AFC North, and the Jacksonville Jaguars were from the AFC South. Their non-conference <b>opponents</b> <b>were</b> from the NFC West.|$|R
50|$|One {{tries to}} {{severely}} damage the opponent {{with all the}} tricks at one's disposal. The <b>opponent</b> <b>is</b> no longer regarded as human. From now on, limited personal loss {{is seen as a}} gain if the damage to the <b>opponent</b> <b>is</b> greater.|$|R
5|$|Holland {{looks at}} the {{earliest}} evidence for Muhammad, Mecca and Islam {{in the first century}} of the Arab Empire, pointing to a lack of evidence in the historical record to support the traditional account. Highlighting that very little Muslim testimony from the 7th century exists, he considers it suspect that 30 years after Muhammad's death, Muawiyah I became leader of the Arab Empire in Jerusalem despite showing little sign of being Muslim, and that no mention of Muhammad or Islam can be found in any of Muawiyah's inscriptions, coins, or documents. Holland proceeds to note that {{with the exception of a}} single ambiguous reference in the Qur'an, there is no mention of Mecca in any datable text for a century after Muhammed's death. He points out that in the Qur'an, the Prophet appears to address farmers and agriculturalists while his <b>opponents</b> <b>are</b> described as keeping cattle and growing olives and vines. This appears to describe an environment foreign to Mecca, where there was no agriculture; thus Holland posits that the location attributed to Mecca in the Qur'an more closely fits a city in the Negev desert, in what is now southern Israel.|$|E
5|$|In July 1996, Firaxis {{began work}} on Alpha Centauri, with Reynolds heading the project. Meier and Reynolds wrote playable {{prototype}} code and Jason Coleman wrote the first lines of the development libraries. Because the development of Gettysburg took up most of Firaxis' time, the designers spent the first year prototyping the basic ideas. By late 1996, the developers were playing games on the prototype, and {{by the middle of}} the next year, they were working on a multiplayer engine. Although Firaxis intended to include multiplayer support in its games, an important goal was to create games with depth and longevity in single-player mode because they believed that the majority of players spend most of their time playing this way. Reynolds felt that smart computer <b>opponents</b> <b>are</b> an integral part of a classic computer game, and considered it a challenge to make them so. Reynolds' previous games omitted internet support because he believed that complex turn-based games with many player options and opportunities for player input are difficult to facilitate online.|$|E

25|$|When Lord's {{is hosting}} a Test match, only members of MCC are {{permitted}} in the pavilion. However, {{for all other}} matches, members of Middlesex and their <b>opponents</b> <b>are</b> also permitted in the pavilion with the option to bring in two guests. This policy has been criticised by some MCC members who complained that the dress code was being flouted on Twenty20 matchdays by members' guests.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in the 1930s, {{opposition}} arose to {{the idea}} of a world government, as advocated by organizations such as the World Federalist Movement (WFM). Those who oppose global governance typically do so on objections that the idea is unfeasible, inevitably oppressive, or simply unnecessary. In general, these <b>opponents</b> <b>are</b> wary of the concentration of power or wealth that such governance might represent. Such reasoning dates back to the founding of the League of Nations and, later, the United Nations.|$|E
25|$|Jokers High Alternate: Similar to Jokers High above, if the Big Joker is led, opponents {{must play}} their highest spade in that trick. If the Big Joker is played during a hand, <b>opponents</b> <b>are</b> not forced {{to play their}} highest spade. This {{variation}} makes bidding more complex, as one cannot count on their highest spade as winning a trick, Big Joker excepted. This variation is commonly played with all 54 cards, using the Kitty dealing variation above.|$|E

25|$|In the Linear Motion Battle System (LMBS), {{the fight}} is played out on a {{two-dimensional}} terrain that usually stretches wider than a single screen width, so the screen can scroll {{to the left and}} to the right, depending on where the characters and <b>opponents</b> <b>are</b> relatively located. LMBS contains a pause menu during battle which lets the player select a spell or item. As in some fighting games, it is possible to assign items or combination moves to specific buttons as shortcuts for quick actions.|$|E
25|$|Penn Jillette {{has stated}} that those being {{interview}}ed know what show the interview is for and its purpose. One episode shows a video crew from the show going into a building to perform an interview, and Jillette points out that {{a member of the}} crew is wearing a Penn & Teller: Bullshit! baseball cap. <b>Opponents</b> <b>are</b> then interviewed and they offer rebuttals to the proponents' arguments. These are usually experts, celebrities, or sometimes speakers from the Center for Inquiry, the James Randi Educational Foundation, or the Cato Institute.|$|E
25|$|Continuous {{reporting}} {{is a point}} of constant debate. Some parties, including analysts and investors, are interested in knowing how a company is doing at a given point in time. They argue that near real-time information would provide them with the ability to take advantage of important business moves as they happen. However, <b>opponents</b> <b>are</b> skeptical of how the raw information can be useful and fear information overload, or that there would be too much irrelevant information out there. Additionally, some companies are fearful that continuously reported financial information would give away important strategic moves and undermine competitive advantage.|$|E

25|$|After {{creating}} a character, the player can compete in tournaments against increasingly tougher opponents {{in any of}} the sports. Playing Quick Play games and Tournament games earns the character Skill Points. These are then used to calculate the difficulty of the CPU opponent for future Quick Play matches. Hence, after completing all tournaments for all the sports in Big Beach Sports, where each game has a preset difficulty, the player can then return to Quick Play and continue to max out Skill Points (999 points) for each of the six sports. In the case of most of the sports, however, the game becomes extremely challenging and the AI <b>opponents</b> <b>are</b> much tougher to beat after reaching 900 skill points.|$|E
25|$|After singing The Star-Spangled Banner, {{while the}} {{opposing}} team is being introduced, members of the student section take out {{a copy of the}} student-run newspaper, The University Daily Kansan, and wave the paper in front of their faces, pretending to be reading it in an effort to show lack of interest in {{the opposing team}}. After the <b>opponents</b> <b>are</b> introduced, a short video is shown, detailing the history and the accomplishments of Kansas basketball. As the Jayhawks are introduced, the students rip up their newspapers and throw the confetti pieces of paper in the air as celebration. Whatever confetti remains is typically thrown in the air after the first basket made by the Jayhawks.|$|E
25|$|The two armies first clashed in mid-July 684 at {{the plain}} of Marj al-Suffar, and the Qays were pushed towards Marj Rahit. Twenty days of skirmishing {{between the two}} camps followed, until the final battle took place on 18 August. The numbers of the two <b>opponents</b> <b>are</b> uncertain: al-Tabari puts Marwan's forces at 6,000, another {{tradition}} at 13,000 and 30,000 for Marwan and al-Dahhak respectively, while Ibn Khayyat inflates the numbers to 30,000 and 60,000 respectively. The traditions agree, however, that the Umayyad forces were considerably outnumbered. Marwan's commanders were Abbas ibn Ziyad, Amr ibn Sa'id al-As and Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad (another tradition has Ubayd Allah commanding the cavalry and Malik ibn Hubayra al-Sakuni the infantry), while only one of al-Dahhak's commanders, Ziyad ibn Amr ibn Mu'awiya al-Uqayli, is known.|$|E
30|$|Note that {{constructive}} {{conflict resolution}} {{is a special}} case of retributive conflict resolution whereby the costs to the <b>opponent</b> <b>are</b> assigned a unit value.
