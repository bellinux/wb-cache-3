5|$|Ostracods, a {{class of}} small {{crustaceans}} that were prevalent in the upper Maastrichtian, left fossil deposits {{in a variety of}} locations.

5|$|From the 4th century {{through to}} the 6th century the use of talud-tablero {{architecture}} became notable in the Mundo Perdido. In the 5th century the talud-tablero form was applied to Structures 5C-51 and 5C-52 at the western limit of the complex, and 6C-24 on the south side. In {{the latter part of}} the 6th century <b>or</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> 7th century a fifth version of the Talud-Tablero Temple 5C-49 was built, with a new stairway and summit shrine.|$|E
5|$|In October 1974 the 7th {{reactivated}} at {{its former}} garrison, Fort Ord.

It trained at Fort Ord, Camp Roberts, Fort Hunter Liggett and Fort Irwin. On 1 October 1985 the division was redesignated as the 7th Infantry Division (Light), organized again as a light infantry division. It was the first US division specially designed as such. The various battalions of the 31st, and 32nd regiments moved from the division, replaced by battalions from other regiments, including battalions from the 21st Infantry Regiment, the 27th Infantry Regiment, and the 9th Infantry Regiment. The 27th and 9th infantry regiments participated in Operation Golden Pheasant in Honduras.|$|E

5|$|Other {{than its}} use in the kulintang ensemble, the agung also had other non-ensemble uses among the Maguindanao and Maranao. The agung {{has been used to}} warn others of {{impending}} danger, announcing the time of day and other important occasions. For instance, long ago the sultan would beat the agung repeatedly to announce the onset of a meeting <b>or</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> fasting month of Ramadhan, the agung would ring either {{at three in the morning}} to indicate the signal to eat (sawl) or at sunset, to mark the end for fasting that day. And supposedly due to the deep, loud sound the agung produces, people believed that it possessed supernatural powers. For instance, during an earthquake, the locals of Maguindanao would strike the agung in a fast, loud rhythm called baru-baru, believing its vibrations would either lessen or even halt the jolt of an earthquake.|$|E
5|$|Pattle was {{provisionally}} {{credited with}} 50 air victories (and two shared), seven (and one shared) probable victories, and four (and two shared) damaged. It {{is likely that}} his total was at least 40 enemy aircraft destroyed a figure which biographer Edgar Baker has compiled through a list of semi-official records and log-books. Baker asserts that the true figure could be higher, owing to the inability of post-war researchers to identify an exact figure, due to the loss or destruction of British records in the retreat from Greece <b>or</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> subsequent occupation.|$|E

After his death, a group of his lands became the basis for the foundation of Cirencester Abbey by King Henry I of England in 1133. Regenbald's brother held land near him in Cirencester. Regenbald had a son named Edward who also held lands in Gloucester.|$|E

5|$|The Arab army {{marched in}} three {{separate}} corps, with Ashinas {{once again in}} front, the caliph in the middle, and Afshin bringing up the rear. Looting the countryside as they advanced, they arrived before Amorium seven days after their departure from Ancyra, and began their siege of the city on 1 August. Theophilos, anxious to prevent the city's fall, left Constantinople for Dorylaion, and from there sent an embassy to Mu'tasim. His envoys, who arrived shortly before <b>or</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> {{first days of the}} siege, offered assurances that the atrocities at Sozopetra had been against the emperor's orders, and further promised to help rebuild the city, to return all Muslim prisoners, and to pay a tribute. The caliph, however, not only refused to parley with the envoys, but detained them in his camp, so that they could observe the siege.|$|E
5|$|The Burgess Shale {{animals were}} {{probably}} killed {{by changes in}} their environment either immediately preceding <b>or</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> mud-slides that buried them. Proposed killing mechanisms include: changes in salinity; poisoning by chemicals such as hydrogen sulfide or methane; changes in the availability of oxygen; and changing consistency of the sea floor. The death event was not necessarily related to the burial, and {{there may have been}} multiple death events between burial events; but only organisms killed immediately before a burial event would stand any chance of being fossilised, instead of rotting or being eaten.|$|E
5|$|The Elves {{view the}} sexual act as {{extremely}} special and intimate, for {{it leads to}} the conception and birth of children. Extra-marital and premarital sex are unthinkable, adultery is also unheard of and fidelity between spouses is absolute. Yet separation during pregnancy <b>or</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> early years of parenthood (caused by war, for example) is so grievous to the couple that they prefer to have children in peaceful times. Living Elves cannot be raped or forced to have sex; before that they will lose the will to endure and go to Mandos.|$|E

5|$|The French {{submarine}} Mariotte (Q74) was {{a submarine}} {{built for the}} French Navy prior to World War I. Intended to accompany the fleet, she was designed for high speed on the surface. Although the navy was unsatisfied with her performance on the surface, the boat had a higher underwater speed than any French submarine before <b>or</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> following 35 years. Mariotte was plagued with engine problems during her construction and the navy spent years fixing the various issues before finally commissioning her five years after beginning construction. During the war, she participated in the Dardanelles Campaign, but had to be scuttled after she became entangled in the cables of a minefield on her first attempt to penetrate the Dardanelles.|$|E

5|$|The Yankees' 1980s demise and {{downfall}} {{continued into}} the early 1990s and was at its frustrating peak in 1994, when they finished with {{the best record in}} the American League in a season that was prematurely halted by the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike, which left New York sports fans disappointed that Mattingly had not played in a postseason despite being poised to do so that year. At that time, he led active players in both games played and at-bats without participating in a postseason game. Throughout October, the news media added to the embarrassment when they often made references to dates that games in the World Series would have been played. That year, the Yankees and Red Sox would have finished the season against each other at Fenway Park. Both managers, Buck Showalter of the Yankees and Butch Hobson of the Red Sox, who made their managerial debuts against each other, were fired as a result of <b>or</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> strike.|$|E

The couple moved with Claire into lodgings at Somers Town, and later, Nelson Square. They maintained their intense programme of reading and writing, and entertained Percy Shelley's friends, such as Thomas Jefferson Hogg and the writer Thomas Love Peacock. Percy Shelley sometimes left home for short periods to dodge creditors. The couple's distraught letters reveal their pain at these separations.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} eleven presidents of Pakistan since the {{introduction}} of the post in 1956. The office was established when Pakistan was declared as a republic with the adoption of the 1956 constitution, and Saad Mirza became the first president of the country. Apart from these eleven, two acting presidents have also been in office for short periods of time. One of them, Wasim Sajjad, served as acting president on two non-consecutive occasions during 1993 and 1997–98. The president may remain in office for a tenure of five years. In the case where a president's term of office is terminated early <b>or</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> absence of the president, the Chairman of the Senate assumes office.|$|E
5|$|Dutch records {{suggest that}} at least 453 civilians died during the battle, either {{as a result of}} Allied bombing on the first day <b>or</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> {{subsequent}} fighting. After the battle, the residents of Arnhem and its surrounding towns and villages were forcibly evicted from their homes, allowing the Germans to turn the north bank of the Rhine into a heavily defended line. Residents were not allowed to return home without a permit and most did not return until after the war. The Dutch homes were then systematically looted, with the spoils being sent to bombing victims in Germany. The Germans continued to fight Allied forces on the plains between Arnhem and Nijmegen, and the bridge that the 1st Airborne had fought so hard for was eventually destroyed by the Allies to deny German forces its use. On 7 October, it was bombed and destroyed by Martin B-26 Marauders of 344th Bomb Group, USAAF. The buildings of Arnhem were heavily shelled by the Allies {{over the next few months}} and suffered further when the city was eventually liberated in April 1945.|$|E
