40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} {{the development of a}} stand-alone microprocessor-based instrument which can classify intelligently the signals from an array of odour-sensitive sensors. Data from the odour sensor array are initially used to train a neural net on a PC using a software program and then sent down an RS- 232 C interface to the artificial neural emulator (ANE). The ANE uses multiplexer and ADC chips to condition the array output, followed by a Motorola 6803 -based digital processing stage that contains in its RAM or ROM, an artificial neural architecture, neuronal weights and an <b>operating</b> <b>instruction</b> set. The processor computes the output of a neural network, classifies this against a knowledge base of odours and displays the result on a two-line LCD display. The ANE has also been fused with an array of four commercial gas sensors (Figaro Engineering Inc., Japan), a temperature IC and a capacitive humidity sensor to produce a stand-alone intelligent odour-sensing system...|$|E

40|$|The {{quality of}} a {{software}} product is determined by its usability; the quality of technical documentation is determined by its comprehensibility. Usability conceptualizes the person using a software product to perform a task; comprehensibility deals with the reader of operating instructions—although they are generally {{one and the same}} person. However, only rarely are the software and technical documentation part of an integrated design. This is all the more surprising in that, on the technical level, the boundary between software and user information is becoming increasingly blurred; one need only think of the hypertext links between software and help systems, or of electronic versions of <b>operating</b> <b>instructions.</b> We make the case for considering user, software, and <b>operating</b> <b>instructions</b> as a single system oriented toward performing a task; the <b>operating</b> <b>instructions</b> therefore are regarded as a subsidiary subsystem of a structure to be described. This is done from a linguistic perspective, with reference to the central category of knowledge available to the user or contained in the software and in the <b>operating</b> <b>instructions</b> and that we approach via an empirical analysis of authentic material (<b>operating</b> <b>instructions</b> as primary data, statements of end users concerning <b>operating</b> <b>instructions).</b> Taking the example of creating software and <b>operating</b> <b>instructions</b> for a computer tomograph, we show how the relevant knowledge elements contribute to the accomplishment of an operating task and discuss the resultant requirements concerning the contents of software and <b>operating</b> <b>instructions,</b> particularly for handling fault and problem situations.

40|$|There is no {{wear and}} no {{friction}} with non-contacting sealing systems. Because of this, {{there is in}} principle no lifetime-limit. However, this does not apply for grease-filled labyrinth seals. To seal against particles, the grease inside the gaps of the seal has to bind pollution particles and the grease-filled gap must be opened. If the surfaces of the grease layers in the gaps are saturated with particles, further particles penetrating the sealing system {{can no longer be}} bound. The seal must then be relubricated. Based on the actual state of the art, this work shows the latest results of experiments to enable designers to unerringly develop non-contacting sealing systems with grease-filled gaps to seal dry particles with reliable function. To that end, a lot of experiments were done to expand existing design guidelines. Additionally, new <b>operating</b> <b>instruction</b> were found to ensure permanent operation.

40|$|Activation of the {{coagulation}} cascade {{resulting in}} alveolar fibrin deposition {{is recognized as}} a hallmark of acute lung injury (ALI). Anticoagulant treatment with recombinant human activated protein C (rhAPC) appears promising, because – like in sepsis – there is a deficiency of protein C in ALI, which is correlated with poor outcome in both syndromes. Recently in Critical Care, Waerhaug and colleagues confirmed the beneficial effects of rhAPC on pulmonary function in ovine endotoxin-induced ALI. Notably, the authors reported no differences in hemorrhage in histologic analyses between rhAPC-treated and untreated animals. However, a recently reported randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial in ALI patients without severe sepsis failed to identify any differences {{in the number of}} ventilator-free days or 60 day-mortality between the rhAPC and placebo group. In addition to (or perhaps because of) the complex pathogenesis, the discrepancy between clinical and experimental results in ALI is another common feature with sepsis. The future challenge will be to transfer our theoretical knowledge adequately into daily clinical practice. Anticoagulant therapy might be a useful tool in the treatment of ALI; however the proper <b>operating</b> <b>instruction</b> remains to be defined...|$|E

40|$|The land supply {{elasticity}} {{with respect}} to the land price (land rent) is a key parameter in determining the land supply impacts of economic shocks and policies and the resulting impacts on food prices and food and nutrition security. For example, Elobeid at al., 2011 shows that halving the area expansion elasticities leads to 15 % lower land expansion in Brazil necessary for 25 % increase in ethanol consumption. However, values for land supply elasticities are rarely available in the literature. Due to lack of reliable time series data on land prices and concerns about the quality of Utilised Agricultural Area data, they are only available estimated for some countries of the world. In this overview we calculate land supply elasticities for several world regions and countries adapting method proposed in the literature and showing available published estimates. A comparison between current and new values of MAGNET land elasticities can be found in Appendix C.

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{describes the}} development of a MOD music player to run on GBA (Game Boy Advance) for Lypson Game Engine. GBA is a basic platform for embedded development, and the stereo system makes it possible to use the platform as a music player. The sound players of the GBA for Lypson Game Engine were designed to play wave files and the size of typical wave files is in the order of megabytes. MOD files are much smaller when compared with wave ones. Therefore, to avoid consuming the resources of the CPU and memory to process and store wave files, the use of MOD files represents a better alternative. The development took C++ as programming language and the development platform used was HAM. The first step was to obtain samples of music, and then control the hardware of GBA to play sound. After that, came the phase of combining it with Lipson Game Engine. These tasks enabled the acquisition of knowledge about the frame of MOD files; learning how to make the GBA play sound and mastering the <b>operating</b> <b>instruction</b> of GBA hardware by the process of development. In addition, it provided a chance to learn about embedded development, which represented a starting point to learn about embedded programming in general. As for the main result, it was achieved by the successful development of the MOD Player, which is now running on the Lypson Game Engine. As the MOD files are of small size, the music player is more efficient when compared with those previously used...|$|E

If possible, provide a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the impacts of the issue on you and the IMO-administered markets. Include the Chapter and Section number of the relevant market rules. Section 12. 3. 1 of Chapter 5 provides a listing of the real-time functions supported by the energy management system (EMS) including the monitoring of the IMO-controlled grid, the scheduling of generation facilities, the monitoring of compliance with dispatch instructions; and dispatch messages. The distinction between the terms dispatch instruction and dispatch message is that a dispatch message is the medium by which a dispatch instruction is given as described in the Participant Technical Reference Manual, Part 6. 2 : Dispatch Information. The definition of dispatch instructions is in respect of a registered facility other than a boundary entity, a physical <b>operating</b> <b>instruction</b> issued by the IMO in the real-time dispatch process, and, in respect of a registered facility that is a boundary entity, the interchange schedule pertaining to that registered facility. However, using the term “dispatch instruction ” and “dispatch message ” in the Market Rules is a potential source of confusion since the distinction between the two terms is not clear within the Market Rules. The Market Rules refer to “dispatch message ” in section 12. 3. 1. 6 and the term is not defined in the Market Rules. The IMO is of the view that the term dispatch message is unnecessary within the Market Rules since the term dispatch message is more appropriately described in the Participant Technical Reference Manual. Given this and the potential confusion from using both terms within the Market Rules, the IMO proposes that the term dispatch message be deleted from the Market Rules...|$|E
