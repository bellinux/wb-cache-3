5|$|A general {{overhaul}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> laws took place through act No. 288/1995 Coll. Under the new act, gun license became shall issue. Also possession and concealed carry of pistols and revolvers became shall issue. The law further introduced mandatory firearms registration.|$|E
5|$|After a near {{accident}} {{at the dinner}} table, Marge begs Homer to get rid <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun.</b> He promises to, but later, Bart and Milhouse {{find it in the}} refrigerator's vegetable crisper. Marge discovers this and berates Homer, then leaves with the children and checks into a motel. That night, Homer hosts an NRA meeting at his house, but the other members kick him out of the association after seeing how recklessly he uses his pistol. Realizing what his behavior has cost him, Homer goes to the motel and tells Marge that he got rid <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun.</b>|$|E
5|$|It is {{generally}} not common for licensed gun owners to commit violent crimes with their guns, and most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> crimes are committed with illegal weapons that are {{beyond the control of}} the law. Annually, police investigate about 500 cases of illegal arming (with or without direct connection to committing other crime).|$|E

5|$|The {{ship was}} fitted with three rudders, and the armored {{pilothouse}} was mounted on top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> turret. The officers' staterooms were built on deck out of light pine, and a hurricane deck was positioned between the turret and the deckhouse, {{between the two}} funnels. The hull was subdivided by three transverse and three longitudinal watertight bulkheads.|$|E
5|$|Versions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> in turret mounts {{were also}} used in the Medium Tank T5 Phase III (T3 barrel, mount T1), in the Medium Tank M2 / M2A1 (M3 barrel, M2A1: mount M19), and in the 37mm Gun Motor Carriage T42 (mount M22).|$|E
5|$|Abramski v. United States, , was a United States Supreme Court case {{in which}} the Court found that making {{arrangements}} for a straw purchase of a gun is in violation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gun</b> Control Act of 1968, and is different from re-selling or gifting a previously purchased gun. In the Abramski case, a former police officer from Virginia took advantage of a local discount to buy a gun for his uncle and later transferred it to Pennsylvania—the uncle's residence—using the appropriate federal procedure. During the purchase, Abramski falsely declared that he is purchasing the gun for himself.|$|E

5|$|Artillery {{powered by}} {{gunpowder}} {{was introduced to}} Europe in the 1320s and spread quickly. Handguns, which were initially unpredictable and inaccurate weapons, were not recorded until the 1380s. Castles were adapted to allow small artillery pieces– averaging between – to fire from towers. These guns were too heavy {{for a man to}} carry and fire, but if he supported the butt end and rested the muzzle on the edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> port he could fire the weapon. The gun ports developed in this period show a unique feature, that of a horizontal timber across the opening. A hook on the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> could be latched over the timber so the gunner did not have to take the full recoil of the weapon. This adaptation is found across Europe, and although the timber rarely survives, there is an intact example at Castle Doornenburg in the Netherlands. Gunports were keyhole shaped, with a circular hole at the bottom for the weapon and a narrow slit on top to allow the gunner to aim.|$|E
5|$|In 1543, Henry VIII allied {{himself with}} Spain {{in a war}} against France. Despite Henry's initial successes, France and Spain made peace in 1544, leaving England exposed to a French invasion, backed by her allies in Scotland. In response, Henry issued an {{instruction}} to improve the country's defences, particularly along the south coast. Dartmouth Castle was reinforced by three new gun batteries, two either side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> tower, and another, Lamberd's Bulwarke, positioned in the south-east corner of the fortalice.|$|E
5|$|In 1902, the Weymouth Corporation {{purchased}} the castle {{for the town}} from the Department of Woods and Forests {{for a total of}} £150. During the Second World War the castle probably housed an anti-aircraft battery as part of the defences created around Portland Harbour. Despite the construction of the Portland breakwaters nearby, the unstable clay cliffs remained vulnerable to erosion; in 1930 the ruins were closed to the public due to safety concerns and the remaining embrasure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> platform collapsed during in the 1950s.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> 42-line field <b>gun</b> M1877 was {{designed}} by Krupp. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> were manufactured in Germany while {{most of them were}} manufactured in the Obuhov factory in Russia. Use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> were limited by lack of equipment needed for indirect fire - the Russian gun-sight used with them was suitable only to direct fire. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> saw use as fortress and coastal artillery for coastal defence which allowed <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> to shoot direct fire for defending harbours and beaches.|$|R
50|$|The 7 {{in shell}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 120-pounder <b>gun</b> weighed 151 lb while <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> itself weighed 16660 lb. <b>The</b> 70-pounder <b>gun</b> weighed 8582 lb and fired a 5.5 in shell that weighed 81 lb. The 7.9 in solid shot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 68-pounder <b>gun</b> weighed {{approximately}} 68 lb while <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> itself weighed 10640 lb. <b>The</b> <b>gun</b> had {{a range of}} 3200 yd at an elevation <b>of</b> 12°. <b>The</b> exact type <b>of</b> 12-pounder gun is not known. All <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> could fire both solid shot and explosive shells.|$|R
5|$|Overlooking Old Grimsby harbour and the {{anchorage}} of St Helen's Pool, the blockhouse {{would have}} housed {{a battery of}} two or three artillery pieces, positioned on a square gun platform on top of a rocky outcrop. An earthwork bank and a stone wall were built to protect it from attack from the beach and the landward sides respectively. A small room to provide living quarters for the garrison was later constructed on the side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> platform.|$|E
5|$|Polling firm Public Policy Polling {{conducted}} {{a poll of}} Giron's district between September 7 and 9, asking likely voters if they supported the recall of Giron, whether they supported various components <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> control bill, whether they approved of the NRA and Governor Hickenlooper, and who {{they would vote for}} in a hypothetical 2014 gubernatorial election between Hickenlooper and Republican Tom Tancredo, as well as various methodological questions. The results found voters supported recalling Giron by 54% to 42%, with 4% undecided.|$|E
5|$|Repairs {{were made}} to the castle between 1610 and 1611 by the captain, Sir George Bampfield, at a cost of £211. A survey in 1623 carried out by Sir Richard Morryson showed the castle to be {{equipped}} with ten iron guns – one culverin, five demi-culverins, two sakers, a minion and a falcon – and garrisoned by its captain, five gunners and three soldiers. It was in a poor condition, and one corner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> platform had been undermined by the sea; Morryson's team estimated the likely costs of repairs to amount to £459.|$|E
60|$|For some {{hundred yards}} in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> <b>the</b> ground {{was covered with}} Russian dead. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{artillery}} horses had fallen, and but two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> had been carried off the field. <b>The</b> loss <b>of</b> <b>the</b> enemy in killed and wounded left upon the ground amounted to nearly 800, and the wounded were all killed as soon as discovered by the infuriated peasants.|$|R
50|$|Inside <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> turret two 15 cm breech loading Wahrendorf guns can be found. These {{could provide}} {{significant}} firepower, enhanced by <b>the</b> rotation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> turret. Ammunition was passed {{up from the}} magazine below through openings besides each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guns.</b> Altogether 16 gunners worked together in this confined space. During battles, one round could be fired by each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> about every 4-6 minutes, because the reloading was a relatively long procedure.|$|R

5|$|Several press {{accounts}} {{reported that}} Timoshenko {{was shot by}} an unlicensed gun that came from Virginia. Previous reports indicated that the gun dealer had previously been indicted for his illegal gun sales, and that all the weapons found in the BMW were illegally obtained. The gun shop in question is now closed, and the dealer has been stripped of his license. Because the gun was used by {{a person with a}} criminal history, and because the NYPD was denied requests to look up the seller <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun,</b> legislators sought {{to make it easier for}} law enforcement to carry out their investigative duties.|$|E
5|$|The M249 is gas {{operated}} and air-cooled. It has a quick-change barrel, allowing the gunner to rapidly replace an overheated or jammed barrel. A folding bipod is attached {{near the front}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun,</b> though an M192 LGM tripod is available. It can be fed from both linked ammunition and STANAG magazines, like those used in the M16 and M4. This allows the SAW gunner to use a rifleman's magazines as an emergency source of ammunition {{in the event that}} he runs out of linked rounds.|$|E
5|$|The long {{sentences}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gun</b> Court and its {{restrictions on}} the rights of the accused have given rise to constitutional challenges, some of which have been appealed to the Privy Council in London. These cases have resulted in some modifications to the court, but have upheld it on the whole. The Gun Court system has also been the target of criticism because of its lengthy delay in hearing cases, and the continuing rise in gun violence since its adoption.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>guns</b> <b>of</b> Battery French {{were removed}} in 1917 for {{potential}} {{service on the}} Western Front; three <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> were sent to France for use on field carriages, but sources indicate that none <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 6-inch <b>gun</b> regiments completed training before the Armistice and thus they did not see combat. <b>The</b> <b>guns</b> were not returned to Fort Kearny.|$|R
