50|$|The {{first known}} mural sextant was {{constructed}} in Ray, Iran, by Abu-Mahmud al-Khujandi in 994. To measure the <b>obliquity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ecliptic,</b> al-Khujandī invented a device that he called al-Fakhri sextant (al-suds al Fakhrī), a reference to his patron, Buwayhid ruler, Fakhr al Dawla (976-997). This instrument was a sixty-degree arc on a wall aligned along a meridian arc (north-south line). Al Khujandi’s instrument was larger than previous instruments; it had a radius of about twenty meters. The main improvement incorporated in al-Fakhri sextants over earlier instruments was bringing the precision of reading to seconds while older instruments could only be read in degrees and minutes. This was confirmed by al-Birūni, al-Marrākushī and al-Kāshī. Al-Khujandī used his device to measure the sun's angle above the horizon at the summer and winter solstices; these two measurements allow computation of the latitude of the sextant's location and the <b>obliquity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ecliptic.</b>|$|R
