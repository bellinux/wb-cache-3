40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to demonstrate a simple Ricardian model of international trade for health care industries of the USA and India. Our motivation is to illustrate that specialization and free trade result in gains from international trade. We will shed some light on the economics of outbound as well as inbound medical tourism. By adopting the model of comparative advantage to the costs of medical surgeries, we will show that trade between <b>our</b> <b>two</b> model <b>countries</b> – India and the USA – is beneficial to both of them. By specializing on the type of surgery they are most efficient in producing, it will enhance the well being of both nations. Numerical examples and graphical presentations help to support our arguments. In addition, we will lift some of the more restrictive assumptions. By including transportation costs, barriers of trade as well as a larger variety of surgical services, the central message of the beneficial effect of specialization still remains, even though the general picture becomes slightly blurred. There is evidence for support of a more multi-polar international system of trade in medical services. medical tourism, Ricardian model, comparative advantage, international trade, gains from trade...|$|R

30|$|Another {{aspect of}} {{specialization}} patterns in C&T-trade {{pertains to the}} distance of C&T-production activities in single countries to the final demand sector. Table  5 reports the corresponding distance levels for <b>our</b> <b>two</b> case study <b>countries</b> in 1995 and 2009. Both countries were ranked as downstream producers in both years and were thus relatively closer in their C&T-production activities to final demand than to intermediate demand for C&T-goods. Surprisingly, compared to Italy, Portugal was always slightly more downstream. As regards the direction of changes between the two years, we further observe that both countries moved into an even more downstream direction, and hence, the distance to final demand decreased. For both countries the downstream movement {{was caused by a}} slump in intermediate demand C&T-outflows which overcompensates the decrease in final demand C&T-outflows. This indicates that they were almost ‘pushed away’ from intermediate demand C&T-production activities.|$|R

30|$|Italy’s {{position}} in the networks was more central compared to Portugal’s in both years, which, however, is not surprising {{due to differences in}} scale between the <b>two</b> <b>countries.</b> In an international comparison, Italy in terms of both in- and outflows of directly embodied C&T-value added ranked among the top 5 in 1995 and its status got even more important. Compared to C&T-value added, in terms of C&T-labor directly embodied in C&T-outflows Italy had a lower status in the network but nevertheless got slightly more central. For C&T-labor directly embodied in C&T-inflows Italy experienced the opposite change and its ranking {{position in}} 1995 was 10 and in 2009 the country ranked 11 th. Portugal was ranked 18 th (16 th) in 1995 and 17 th (14 th) in 2009 with respect to C&T-value added directly embodied in C&T-inflows (-outflows). Portugal could also extend its status in the network in terms of C&T-labor directly embodied in both in- and outflows. Results of centrality positions of <b>our</b> <b>two</b> case study <b>countries</b> relative to other countries show that at least Italy in terms of C&T-value added directly embodied in C&T-outflows was a global player in the respective C&T-TN. On the contrary, even if Portugal’s status increased it was less significant compared to other countries. This, however, does not preclude that it’s C&T-industry was bound to a serious restructuring between the two years.|$|R

30|$|There exist {{multiple}} {{measures in}} network analysis for characterizing {{the structure of}} a network. In general, one can distinguish between local and global measures, where the former describe node-specific characteristics and the latter are used to specify topological characteristics of the whole network. We focus on a node-specific measure, since this allows us analyzing the restructuring from the perspective of <b>our</b> <b>two</b> case study <b>countries.</b> At the same time we do not lose sight of the entire network structure (i.e., the international environment). One class of local measures are centrality measures, 2 which provide information on the status of a single node within a network according to some topological characteristic. In the following we apply strength centrality to the C&T-TNs as explained in more detail in Appendix 2. We decide for this measure, since it constitutes a simple but convenient metric to determine and compare the importance of single countries in the C&T-TNs, according to the overall intensity of C&T-trade linkages they share.|$|R

These documents are unusual both within our country, and internationally, in that they offer a framework for bi-epistemological approaches to both education and social organisation more widely.

30|$|Moreover, crucial {{differences}} between <b>our</b> <b>two</b> case study <b>countries</b> are observed {{with respect to}} the importance of domestic versus international C&T-trade. Overall, for Italy domestic C&T-trade of directly embodied C&T-value added was by far more important in both years than for Portugal. Apart from one exception—intermediate demand outflows—Portugal was much more dependent on the international market. For directly embodied C&T-labor a different scenario prevailed: The domestic market relative to the international market played a much more significant role for Portuguese inflows and also for intermediate demand outflows. With respect to C&T-labor directly embodied in final demand C&T-outflows it was, however, again Italy, which was less open to the international market. As regards intertemporal changes, we observe that overall the importance of the domestic market relative to the international market in terms of C&T-value added and C&T-labor directly embodied in C&T-trade flows increased for C&T-outflows and decreased for C&T-inflows for both countries which gives a first hint that outsourcing activities took place. To sum up, our findings also indicate that the relative importance of the domestic versus the international market for directly embodied C&T-value added and C&T-labor could be a source of different degrees of vulnerability to the restructuring of C&T-trade in the <b>two</b> case study <b>countries.</b>|$|R
