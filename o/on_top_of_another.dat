Above the central niche was {{the image of the}} Holy Trinity. On both sides, above the two other niches on the main altar, were paintings of the allegories of the Finding and Veneration of the True Cross. The rest of the retablos in the transept contained images of saints.|$|E
5|$|According to Geisel's biographers Judith and Neil Morgan, Horton Hatches the Egg {{was born}} in 1940, the day after New Year's, {{when he took a}} break from drawing in his Park Avenue {{apartment}} and went for a walk. When he returned, he noticed that he had left a window open in his studio and that the wind had blown one sketch on transparent paper <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>another,</b> making it look like an elephant was sitting in a tree. This account was based on interviews with Geisel, who had told similar stories about the book's creation to reporters asking about his creative process since as early as 1957. The story had changed with each telling but always involved the fortuitous juxtaposition of drawings of an elephant and a tree.|$|E
5|$|The government's {{contracts}} with the civilian organisations for flying instruction at Mascot and Newcastle were terminated during August 1940, and their aircraft—fifteen Tiger Moths and eight Gipsy Moths—were impressed by the RAAF. Airflite was engaged to provide maintenance. On 18November, an instructor was killed when he fell into a Randwick street from a Tiger Moth performing a slow roll after his safety harness broke; {{neither he nor his}} student, who though badly shaken was able to land the plane, were wearing parachutes. One Tiger Moth landed <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>another</b> on 27December; both planes were badly damaged but no-one was killed.|$|E

25|$|Corsets {{also began}} to be worn about this time. At first they were called pairs of bodies, which refers to a {{stiffened}} decorative bodice worn <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>another</b> bodice stiffened with buckram, reeds, canes, whalebone or other materials. These were not the small-waisted, curved corsets familiar from the Victorian era, but straight-lined stays that flattened the bust.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{distinctive}} traits of Milwaukee's residential areas are the neighborhoods full of so-called Polish flats. These are two-family homes with separate entrances, {{but with the}} units stacked one <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>another</b> instead of side-by-side. This arrangement enables a family of limited means to purchase both a home and a modestly priced rental apartment unit. Since Polish-American immigrants to the area prized land ownership, this solution, which was prominent in their areas of settlement within the city, came {{to be associated with}} them.|$|E
25|$|The chapel of S. Gregory the Illuminator (formerly the Chapel of the Mother of God - St Astvatzatzin), {{built before}} 1177, stands {{high above the}} road, a hundred meters away from the {{entrance}} to the monastery. It is partly hewed in massive solid rock; its composition was, in all probability, largely influenced by the shape of the cave which existed there. The chapel, rectangular in plan and having a horseshoe-shaped apse, is adjoined, from the east and from the northeast, by passages and annexes hewed at various levels and even one <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>another.</b>|$|E

25|$|A 9th-century wreck {{known as}} Tantura B, most likely an Arab trading vessel, was {{discovered}} in shallow water off the Tantura coast. Excavations were conducted from 1994 to 1996 by the Institute for Nautical Archaeology (Texas A University) and the University of Haifa's Center for Maritime Studies {{under the direction of}} Shelley Waschsmann and Yaakov Kahanov. The Tantura B hull was found resting <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>another</b> shipwreck dating to the Roman period. Excavations at Tel Dor in 1986 unearthed an intact purple dye manufacturing installation, based on dye extracted from murex marine snails.|$|E
25|$|Multi-junction cells {{consist of}} {{multiple}} thin films, each essentially a solar cell grown <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>another,</b> typically using metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy. Each layer {{has a different}} band gap energy {{to allow it to}} absorb electromagnetic radiation over a different portion of the spectrum. Multi-junction cells were originally developed for special applications such as satellites and space exploration, but are now used increasingly in terrestrial concentrator photovoltaics (CPV), an emerging technology that uses lenses and curved mirrors to concentrate sunlight onto small, highly efficient multi-junction solar cells. By concentrating sunlight up to a thousand times, High concentrated photovoltaics (HCPV) has the potential to outcompete conventional solar PV in the future.|$|E
25|$|The drought {{become a}} serious problem in late spring. In April, no rain fell in parts of Cornwall and then in June, no rain fell over Devon and Kent. In August no {{precipitation}} was measured in North Wales. This meant that in some places, {{less than half the}} average rainfall was measured from October 1975 to August 1976. For example, in Kew, just 235mm (9.25inches) of rain was measured over that period, which was 43% of the average, meaning the amount of rain that fell was comparable to a semi-arid climate. In Devon and Dorset, some locations received no rainfall for 45 consecutive days through July and August, another United Kingdom record. This was <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>another</b> 3 periods of absolute drought, totalling 58 days with no measurable precipitation.|$|E

25|$|There {{are three}} raised {{tailings}} dam designs, the upstream, downstream and centerline, named {{according to the}} movement of the crest during raising. The specific design used is dependent upon topography, geology, climate, the type of tailings, and cost. An upstream tailings dam consists of trapezoidal embankments being constructed on top but toe to crest of another, moving the crest further upstream. This creates a relatively flat downstream side and a jagged upstream side which is supported by tailings slurry in the impoundment. The downstream design refers to the successive raising of the embankment that positions the fill and crest further downstream. A centerlined dam has sequential embankment dams constructed directly <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>another</b> while fill is placed on the downstream side for support and slurry supports the upstream side.|$|E
500|$|Touring {{subwoofer}} cabinets {{are typically}} designed with features that facilitate moving the enclosure (e.g., wheels, a [...] "towel bar" [...] handle and recessed handles), a protective grill for the speaker (in direct radiating-style cabinets), metal or plastic {{protection for the}} cabinets to protect the finish as the cabinets are being slid one <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>another,</b> and hardware to facilitate stacking the cabinets (e.g., interlocking corners) and for [...] "flying" [...] the cabinets from stage rigging. In the 2000s, many small-to mid-size subwoofers designed for [...] bands' live sound use and DJ applications are [...] "powered subs"; that is, they have an integrated power amplifier. These models typically have a built-in crossover. Some models have a metal-reinforced hole in which a speaker stand can be mounted for full-range cabinets.|$|E
500|$|Stan's new dog Sparky {{follows the}} boys {{to the bus stop}} one morning. Stan {{believes}} Sparky to be the toughest dog in South Park; but, when Sparky suddenly jumps <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>another</b> male dog and begins humping him energetically, Cartman declares that Sparky is homosexual. At football practice for the school's team, the South Park Cows, Stan's Uncle Jimbo and his friend Ned show up and ask Coach Chef whether the boys can beat the betting spread of 70 points for the Cows' game against the Middle Park Cowboys. Impressed by a play from Stan, who is the quarterback and star of the team, Jimbo and Ned go to the bookmaker, where Jimbo bets $500 on the Cows. As a result, everyone else bets all their money on the team, and they threaten Jimbo if the Cows lose. Intimidated, Jimbo and Ned seek a back-up plan and learn that John Stamos' brother Richard will be singing [...] "Lovin' You" [...] at half-time. Consequently, they plan to detonate the mascot for Middle Park, by placing a bomb to explode when Richard Stamos sings the high F note in the song.|$|E
