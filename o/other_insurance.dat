25|$|Outsiders, whether {{individuals}} or <b>other</b> <b>insurance</b> companies, cannot transact business directly with Lloyd's syndicates.

25|$|Reinsurance {{companies}} are insurance companies that sell policies to <b>other</b> <b>insurance</b> companies, {{allowing them to}} reduce their risks and protect themselves from very large losses.

25|$|Lloyd's {{is not an}} {{insurance}} company; it is a market of members. As the oldest continuously active insurance marketplace in the world, Lloyd's has retained some unusual structures and practices that differ from all <b>other</b> <b>insurance</b> providers today.

25|$|The Social Security Organization is {{responsible}} for insuring employed citizens in urban areas and their dependents, {{with the exception of}} government workers. All salaried and wage workers are covered, as are self-employed persons who voluntarily join. It also insures many old-age pensioners. The Medical Service Insurance Organization covers government employees, students, and inhabitants of rural areas. The Imam Khomeinei Relief Foundation insures the poor who are not covered by <b>other</b> <b>insurance</b> schemes, while the Military Personnel Insurance Organization provides health insurance to members of the armed forces.

25|$|Much {{consolidation}} {{occurred in}} the financial services industry since, {{but not at the}} scale some had expected. Retail banks, for example, do not tend to buy insurance underwriters, as they seek to engage in a more profitable business of insurance brokerage by selling products of <b>other</b> <b>insurance</b> companies. Other retail banks were slow to market investments and insurance products and package those products in a convincing way. Brokerage companies had a hard time getting into banking, because {{they do not have a}} large branch and backshop footprint. Banks have recently tended to buy other banks, such as the 2004 Bank of America and Fleet Boston merger, yet they have had less success integrating with investment and insurance companies. Many banks have expanded into investment banking, but have found it hard to package it with their banking services, without resorting to questionable tie-ins which caused scandals at Smith Barney.|$|E

[...] They ended up not filing a claim, thus maintaining a claim-free history for their home. [...] In spite of the claim-free history, State Farm dropped them as customers, and shared information on their water damage with ChoicePoint's CLUE database.

2500|$|The market {{began in}} Lloyd's Coffee House, opened by Edward Lloyd in 1686 on Tower Street in the City of London. This {{establishment}} {{was a popular}} place for sailors, merchants, and ship-owners, and Lloyd catered to them with reliable shipping news. The coffee house soon became recognised as an ideal place for obtaining marine insurance. The shop was also frequented by mariners involved in the slave trade. Historian Eric Williams notes: [...] "Lloyd's, like <b>other</b> <b>insurance</b> companies, insured slaves and slave ships, and was vitally interested in legal decisions as to what constituted 'natural death' and 'perils of the sea'." [...] Lloyd's obtained a monopoly on maritime insurance related to the slave trade and maintained it until the early 19th century.|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, Caritas Christi Health Care, {{which the}} Archdiocese of Boston owned, {{proposed}} contracting with Centene Corporation, a Missouri-based health insurer, to provide certain healthcare services, including abortion and pregnancy termination services, through a jointly-owned venture named Celticare. The {{new director of}} Caritas, Dr. Ralph de la Torre, announced the project {{as part of an}} effort to relieve the hospital system's financial problems while extending services to low income and underserved populations. In order for Caritas to participate in the Massachusetts state program CommonwealthCare, Caritas needed to provide access to mandated services, including some forbidden by Catholic teaching. Torre explained: [...] "When a patient seeks such a procedure, Caritas healthcare professionals will be clear that (a) the hospital does not perform them and (b) the patient must turn to his or her insurer for further guidance. This, in fact, is the practice currently in place in the Caritas system as we work with <b>other</b> <b>insurance</b> companies under state laws that mandate access to procedures not provided within the Caritas system." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{have thought}} it right to submit these not inconsiderable {{proposals}} in general outline to the House of Commons at this early stage, in order that the proposals for Labour Exchanges which we are now putting forward may be properly understood, {{and may not be}} underrated or misjudged. We cannot bring the system of unemployment insurance before Parliament in a legislative form this year for five reasons: We have not now got the time; we have not yet got the money; the finance of such a system has to be adjusted and co-ordinated with the finance of the <b>other</b> <b>insurance</b> schemes upon which the Chancellor of the Exchequer is engaged; the establishment of a system of Labour Exchanges is the necessary forerunner and foundation of a system of insurance; and, lastly, no such novel departure as unemployment insurance could possibly be taken without much further consultation and negotiation with the trade unions and employers specially concerned than the conditions of secrecy under which we have been working have yet allowed. This business of conference and consultation of the fullest character will occupy the winter, when the Board of Trade will confer with all parties affected, so that the greatest measure of agreement may be secured for our proposals when they are next year presented in their final form.|$|E

40|$|A {{shipowner}} has {{to provide}} protection for his seafarers both when the seafarers are travelling {{to and from}} the vessel, and when they are onboard. This protection consists amongst other things of providing for medical help if the seafarer gets ill or injured, repatriation if the seafarer is notified of serious illness or death in the closest family and pay compensation for lost or damaged personal effects that the seafarer is bringing to the vessel. The rules and regulation for the shipowners liability towards the seafarer is found in the Seaman’s Act and in the collective wages agreements that are the working agreements for the seafarer. For Norwegian seafarers the shipowner can get some of his liability covered under the Norwegian Social insurance. For liabilities not covered under <b>other</b> <b>insurances</b> the shipowner can get his liability towards the seafarer covered under his P&I insurance. This thesis will first describe what kind of protection the shipowner is obliged to provide for his seafarers according to the Norwegian legislation and collective wages agreements. Further in the thesis it is discussed where the shipowner can seek coverage for this liability the shipowner has towards the seafarer. Shipowners usually have P&I insurance that will cover his liability towards the crew onboard the vessels. But this insurance will not come into play if there are <b>other</b> <b>insurances</b> or Social Benefit Programs that will cover for the liability that the shipowner has. In the thesis some cases will be looked at {{to see if there is}} to see if there is coverage under mandatory insurances through the collective wages agreements, to see if there is coverage through the Norwegian Social Benefit program or if there can be coverage through <b>other</b> <b>insurances.</b> If not then the rules of Skuld P&I Club will be looked at to see if the shipowner can seek cover for his liability towards the seafarer in the P&I Club...|$|R
40|$|Background: A {{high quality}} of timely {{delivered}} medical appraisals is crucial for social and <b>other</b> <b>insurances</b> to judge possible occupational reintegration measures for patients with medical conditions who are in danger to lose their job. However, {{little is known about}} the satisfaction of staff of insurance companies with medical appraisals that they have commissioned. Our questionnaire survey prospectively included all medical appraisals arriving at Swiss insurances from FEB to APR 2008. We assessed the satisfaction of the commissioner with medical appraisals performed by medical assessors. In addition, we evaluated the contribution of several factors to overall satisfaction. The unit of sample was the medical appraisal. Findings: We analysed 3165 medical appraisals, 2444 (77 %) of them from the public disability insurance, 678 (22 %) from private accident, liability and loss of income insurances and 43 (1 %) from <b>other</b> <b>insurances.</b> Overall satisfaction of staff of insurance companies in Switzerland was high, but satisfaction of the disability insurance with appraisals was generally lower compared to satisfaction of private insurances.
