The bulk of this debt was to be maturing by 2014. In 2008, the company reported a loss of more than $1 billion, on sales of about $253 million.

In the mountainous Peloponnese region, trains manned by drivers being paid as much as $130,000 a year frequently run empty. For {{the better part of a}} decade, Greece has provided sovereign backing to Hellenic Railways, thus allowing it to borrow billions even though the company’s finances are so skewed that it pays three times as much on interest expenses than it collects in revenue. As the debt of state-owned enterprises was not counted toward Greece’s <b>official</b> <b>debt,</b> Greece has been able to use the rail system as a means to support employment while not adding to its <b>official</b> <b>debt</b> number; basically an accounting trick to hide debt.

In 2007 the World Bank declared that the Russian economy had achieved [...] "unprecedented macroeconomic stability". Russia is making progress in meeting its foreign debts obligations. During 2000-01, Russia not only met its external debt services but also made large advance repayments of principal on IMF loans but also built up Central Bank reserves with government budget, trade, and current account surpluses. The FY 2002 Russian Government budget assumes payment of roughly $14 billion in <b>official</b> <b>debt</b> service payments falling due. Large current account surpluses have brought a rapid appreciation of the ruble over the past several years. This has meant that Russia has given back much of the terms-of-trade advantage that it gained when the ruble fell by 60% during the debt crisis. Oil and gas dominate Russian exports, so Russia remains highly dependent upon the price of energy. Loan and deposit rates at or below the inflation rate inhibit the growth of the banking system and make the allocation of capital and risk much less efficient than it would be otherwise.|$|E

40|$|The authors analyze how {{the burden}} of the debt crisis has been shared by various classes of creditors. Given the rising share of <b>official</b> <b>debt</b> in the total debt of {{developing}} countries, official creditors have a growing need to develop a burden-sharing indicator. This paper represents the very first step in this direction. To assess burden-sharing, the unobservable implied prices of <b>official</b> <b>debt</b> need to be estimated. The authors first analyze how, in a seniority-based corporate debt model, information on these implied prices can be recovered by looking at the differential impact of various stocks of debt on the market price. They analyze the validity and drawbacks of this model for the sovereign debt case and conclude that seniority sharing rules are probably not appropriate. They then show that implied prices are still identified under more general sharing rules, which allows them to relax the assumption and still be able to derive relevant inferences. A suitable multicreditor debt valuation model, dependent on the stock of private debt and the debt shares of various creditors, is then derived and estimated.

Between 1980 and 1990 the region’s external debt more than tripled, to US$ 171 billion, while debt service payments and rescheduling rose by more than 150 percent to US$ 20 billion. In addition, the region continues to qualify as severely debt-distressed. During {{the last few years}} the region has benefitted from several new debt initiatives, including a substantial increase in debt cancellation by bilateral creditors and the general application of Toronto terms for debt rescheduling.

40|$|This article {{argues that}} the {{doctrine}} of Odious Debt, which has enjoyed a revival since the U.
