500|$|Despite {{his success}} in {{advancing}} Nixon's career, Chotiner was respected, but was not universally popular among the Vice President's backers. Frank Jorgensen, one of Nixon's first backers in the Voorhis race, said of the attorney, [...] "I knew that Murray was very impatient with people who didn't have the IQ that he had. He had the habit of {{a man like that}} of tramping on them. He'd move ahead. He'd just leave the wreckage behind him, but he would get the job done." [...] Nixon family friend and Whittier College trustee Herman Perry stated, [...] "When Murray develops a little more of the techniques of public relations, I {{will be one of the}} first to recognize it and one of the first to give him credit... The <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not want him to do is be the quarterback and call the plays on the team on which I play." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{a change}} in {{administration}} in Washington, in May 2017 {{it was reported that}} Cindy McCain was under consideration for a prominent role at the U.S. Department of State, possibly focusing on issues related to human trafficking. [...] In June 2017, there were further reports that after extensive recruiting by the chief executive following a recommendation from Ivanka Trump, she had agreed to become an Ambassador-at-Large dealing with matters of human trafficking, refugees, and humanitarian aid. [...] No official announcement has yet been made regarding this. [...] In July 2017 she faced the news that her husband had been diagnosed with a glioblastoma, an aggressive brain tumor. [...] She issued a public statement saying that, [...] "We as a family will face the next hurdle together. <b>One</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> know is he is the toughest person I know. He is my hero and I love him with all my heart." ...|$|E
2500|$|An article which {{appeared}} in The Southeast Missourian discussed that Norton credited Napoleon Hill's philosophy for his success. To quote from the article, [...] "Norton says he's a believer in Napoleon Hill's philosophy, that a person can do anything he puts his mind to. 'So I train for my fights,' he says, 'mentally as well as physically. <b>One</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> is only watch films of the fights in which I've done well or in which my opponent has done poorly.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Stop!" [...] Louise {{interrupted}} sternly. [...] "I am horrified! The <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not {{suspect you}} of, Mr. Strangewey, was a past." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{shook my}} head. Of <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> feel confident, although, {{as regards the}} whole {{of the rest of the}} affair, I was in a {{complete}} maze.|$|R
6000|$|Nasmyth raised {{himself on}} one elbow, and looked hard at her. [...] "Well," [...] he admitted, [...] "there was <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not tell you, though I {{had meant to}} do so sooner or later. You see, {{there was nothing to}} warrant it in the meanwhile." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There's <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> envy Reddy," [...] {{spoke up}} Peter Rabbit, [...] "and {{that is that}} big tail of his. It is a {{wonderful}} tail. I wish I had one like it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We shall see--we shall see," [...] {{returned}} Eve, laughing. Then, looking {{about her}} for a few minutes, she added with a manner in which real and affected vexation were prettily blended, [...] "In <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> confess myself disappointed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] replied Cardatas, curtly. [...] "How should I? But <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> know, {{and that}} is that I shall lie to until morning, and then we can feel our way near to the coast and see what it does mean." ...|$|E
2500|$|RZA is vegan and has {{promoted}} the vegan lifestyle {{on behalf of}} PETA. [...] "I tell you <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> use to like: the fish and chips," [...] he said in 1997. [...] "But I stopped eating fish this year. One day I just felt the death in it." ...|$|R
6000|$|Euphemia {{told me of}} this, laughing, {{and then}} she became {{suddenly}} grave. [...] "Do you know, dear," [...] she said, [...] "Jane said <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not like. She had been quiet for a minute, and then she suddenly remarked, 'William is a lot above me, ma'am, ain't he?'" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I think I {{have worked}} in every {{capacity}} possible in a newsroom," [...] Jellison has said. [...] "The <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not like was editing. It was like be trapped in a cage. I would read stories and knew I could write them better or at least ask the questions that were not be asked." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>One</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> know: Never, on this Earth, was the {{relation}} of man to man long carried on by Cash-payment alone. If, at any time, a philosophy of Laissez-faire, Competition and Supply-and-demand, start up as the exponent of human relations, expect that it will soon end.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{used to love}} to {{hear you}} talk about it," [...] she said, [...] "but, somehow, now it seems so far off. I don't even know that I {{want to be like}} other women. There is only <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> want and that is to keep you." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{looked so}} undaunted that Charlie {{was a little}} nettled and fired his last shot rather recklessly: [...] "Well, <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> know you'll never get a husband {{if you go on}} in this absurd way, and by Jove! you need one {{to take care of you}} and keep the {{property}} together!" ...|$|E

5000|$|Shivers' {{first major}} {{decision}} as the Riders' General Manager was to hire his coach Danny Barrett, {{a man with}} no prior CFL head coaching experience, or head coaching experience at any level. [...] "The <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> right was (hire) Danny Barrett. He's a good young black coach. Most of our guys are young black kids. We've got a head coach our people like to play for", Shivers said.|$|R
6000|$|Ten {{minutes later}} he was {{galloping}} towards Pilgrim's Rest. Before I departed from the death chamber I examined the place carefully to see if I could find any poison or other deadly thing, but without success. <b>One</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> discover, however. Turning the leaf of a blotting-book that was by Marnham's elbow, I came upon {{a sheet of paper}} on which were written these words in his hand, [...] "Greater love hath no man than this--" [...] that was all.|$|R
6000|$|... "No. That couldn't {{have been}} {{anywhere}} around here or I {{certainly would have}} heard about it. But there's <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> know," [...] added the foreman suddenly. [...] "There's a man named Jarley Bangs who owns a ranch {{on the other side}} of the river--a small place next to the one run by Bimbel." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know about}} that. But <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> know, mamma, {{and that is}} that Prince Beaton isn't the F. F. P. for me. How strange you are, mamma! Don't {{you think it would be}} {{perfectly}} disgusting to accept a person you didn't care for, and let him go on and love you and marry you? It's sickening." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'That is a question,' she said, 'that is {{not easy}} to answer, and needs a good deal of consideration.' And she spoke with as much {{deliberation}} as if she were trying to decide whether {{it would be better to}} cover a floor with matting or carpet. 'For <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not believe I would nag him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But I don't {{think that}} is a reason for not trying to do good, even in this very small and {{uncertain}} way. Indeed,' she added, earnestly. 'I have no right to speak, for I have made great mistakes; but I wanted {{to tell you that the}} <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> get published, which was not written conscientiously--as I may say--but only to work out a silly, sentimental fancy, has brought me pain and punishment by the harm I know I did.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{returned}} Polychrome, {{shaking her}} head, [...] "that is <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> cannot <b>do.</b> But <b>I</b> will gladly {{go with you}} and help you search for the place." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{very sorry}} to vex you, father dear, but {{to marry a}} man whom <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not care about is just the <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> can't <b>do,</b> even for your sake." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lawrence," [...] she said, [...] "we are man and woman, not boy and girl. You {{asked me}} to marry you once, and I hesitated, only because of <b>one</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not wish to look into any hidden {{chambers}} of your life. I wish to know nothing, save of the present. What claim has this woman Blanche Phillimore upon you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Carol was furious. [...] "I don't {{pretend that}} Will has no faults. But <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> know: He's as simple-hearted {{about what you}} call 'goings-on' as a babe. And if he ever were such a sad dog as to look at another woman, I {{certainly}} hope he'd have spirit enough to do the tempting, and not be coaxed into it, as in your depressing picture!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'O Berta!' said Cornelia, in a deprecating tone; 'don't object. If there's <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{glory in}} it is a nice {{flare-up}} about my head o' Sundays--of course if the family's not in mourning, I mean.' But, seeing that Ethelberta did not smile, she turned the subject, and added docilely: 'Did you come up {{for me to do}} anything? I will put off finishing my bonnet if I am wanted.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is only <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> can <b>do,</b> but if needful, I will {{devote the}} rest of my life to it--that is, to track down the man who killed my son!" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{was a kind}} of good jack-of-all trades, {{which could}} be very dull indeed except for the <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> have, {{probably}} the thing Diana had seen in Cincinnati: I could move, and if I could incorporate what Balanchine wanted with my movement, it might blossom into something - it could be anything. I think that was interesting to Balanchine. With no image to uphold and no glory in any single area of technique, I never had the debilitating worry that I might lose my strongest point." ...|$|R
6000|$|Captain Stubbs {{shook his}} head gently, and smiled with {{infinite}} patience. [...] "P’raps so," [...] he said modestly. [...] "P’raps so; but there’s <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> can <b>do,</b> and that is, I can read people." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There was {{a letter}} enclosed. I opened the parcel out of doors. There was a fresh breeze blowing at the time. It caught the letter, {{and that was the}} last I saw of it. I had read as far as [...] "Dear Madam". But <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{remember}} about it, and that was that it was sent from some hotel in Cheltenham, and I could remember it if I heard it. Now, then?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What bosh you fellows talk!" [...] Bullen laughed. [...] "There is <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> expect I shall {{learn in}} Russia, {{and that is}} to skate. Fancy six months of regular skating, instead of a miserable three or four days. I shall meet some of you fellows some day at the Round Pond, and there you will be just working away at the outside edge, and I shall be joining in those skating-club figures and flying round and round like a bird." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I beg {{you to be}} seated," [...] {{said the}} Governor, [...] "and let me assure you, that in {{offering}} to send this order to Captain Vince I do {{not in the least}} expect you to take it. But there is <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not understand. Why should the captain have left you in a great rage? Perhaps I have not a right to ask this, {{but it seems to me}} to have some bearing upon his alacrity in setting forth in pursuit of the Revenge." ...|$|E
6000|$|Grant smiled wearily as {{he shook}} his head. [...] "No," [...] he said. [...] "The <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> can't <b>do</b> is to lift my hand against the men I brought here in a private quarrel." ...|$|R
2500|$|Uncharted 2 also {{received}} praise from other developers. [...] producer Gordon Van Dyke stated [...] "Uncharted 2 is an amazing-looking game. But we're reaching {{that level of}} quality. It's {{going to be hard}} for any game to be able to make a claim that they look better... to even be close, to me is quite an honour as a developer. The <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> was, when <b>I</b> looked at their game I was like, damn them! What have they done to the rest of us? I was looking for something where I could say, okay, that we're doing better." ...|$|R
5000|$|Rowan Kaiser, {{writing for}} The A.V. Club, gave a mixed review, criticizing the episode's {{focus on the}} Fitzpatricks while praising the Veronica-Keith dynamic. [...] "While I admire the show's {{willingness}} to provide {{a variety of different}} explanations for what happened, the thing that prevents me from engaging with it fully {{is that most of the}} scenarios, and much of this particular episode, deal with the Fitzpatricks. And to be honest, the show has completely failed at making the Fitzpatricks interesting in any fashion. … <b>One</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> like about this episode was that it had Veronica and Keith working together again." ...|$|R
