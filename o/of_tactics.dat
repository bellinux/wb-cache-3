5|$|With professionalism legalised, Preston flourished. Keen to {{make use}} <b>of</b> <b>tactics,</b> Sudell {{was the first person}} to use a {{blackboard}} to dictate positions and strategy to his players. In 1887, Preston recorded the biggest win in the history of the FA Cup, beating Hyde 26–0 in the first round. The club progressed to the final having amassed a run of 42 consecutive wins in all competitions, but were beaten in the FA Cup Final by West Bromwich Albion.|$|E
5|$|A {{radical change}} <b>of</b> <b>tactics,</b> which {{involved}} {{the introduction of}} a bill to ban British subjects from aiding or participating in the slave trade to the French colonies, was suggested by maritime lawyer James Stephen. It was a shrewd move, since the majority of British ships were now flying American flags and supplying slaves to foreign colonies with whom Britain was at war. A bill was introduced and approved by the cabinet, and Wilberforce and other abolitionists maintained a self-imposed silence, so as not to draw any attention to the effect of the bill. The approach proved successful, and the new Foreign Slave Trade Bill was quickly passed, and received royal assent on 23 May 1806.|$|E

Although he had surrendered his ship, Linois was widely praised for his actions in defending his ship against such heavy odds.|$|E

In his role as USAF Deputy Chief of Staff for Development, Saville helped direct missile work, but soon replaced himself on the GMIORG with Major General Robert M. Lee, commander of TAC.

40|$|Abstract. The article {{presents}} the analysis <b>of</b> the accusation <b>tactics</b> that implement a discrediting {{strategy in the}} U. S. diplomatic discourse. The aim of the article is to study speech acts that shape <b>tactics</b> <b>of</b> accusation in implementing a discrediting strategy. The article offers a classification of markers <b>of</b> the communicative <b>tactics</b> <b>of</b> accusation that implement a discrediting strategy in the public statements of US diplomats, namely V. Nuland, G. Pyatt, S. Power, D. Baer, related to the military conflict in eastern Ukraine. The total number of public speeches that have been analyzed is 97 (from 2013 to 2015). A special attention is drawn to the speech acts and how they implement the <b>tactics</b> <b>of</b> accusation in diplomatic discourse. The author has {{found out that the}} <b>tactics</b> <b>of</b> accusation is basic and the most common <b>tactics</b> <b>of</b> implementing the discrediting strategy in the studied speeches.

5|$|In the South West Pacific, a {{conventional}} strategic bombing campaign {{was out of}} the question, as industrial targets in Japan were well beyond the range of even the largest strategic bombers operating from bases in Australia and New Guinea. Therefore, the primary mission of the Allied bomber force was interdiction of Japanese supply lines, especially the sea lanes. The results of the effort against the Japanese convoy in January were very disappointing; some 416 sorties had been flown with only two ships sunk and three damaged, so clearly, a change <b>of</b> <b>tactics</b> was in order. Group Captain Bill Garing, an RAAF officer on Kenney’s staff with considerable experience in air-sea operations, including a tour of duty in Europe, recommended that Japanese convoys be subjected to simultaneous attack from different altitudes and directions.|$|E
5|$|Johns {{initially}} {{served at}} the United States Military Academy as an instructor in the Department <b>of</b> <b>Tactics</b> but in July 1916 he was posted to the 1st Battalion of Mounted Engineers on the Mexican Border. He served with the Pancho Villa Expedition from November 1916 to February 1917, when the 8th Engineers returned to El Paso, Texas. Johns was promoted to captain in May 1917 and major in May 1918. He commanded the 8th Engineers from April to August 1918. Returning to the United States Military Academy in August 1918, he became an instructor in Drawing from August to December 1918, and in Tactics from November to December 1918. From December 1918 to mid-1919 he was an instructor in Mathematics.|$|E

The dismemberment of the French socialist movement, into many groups and, following the suppression of the 1871 Paris Commune, the execution and exile of many communards to penal colonies, favoured individualist political expression and acts.|$|E

In addition, he used his network to apply pressure to Trotter's supporters in their workplaces (in some cases government and academic positions). In addition, he had other sympathizers secretly infiltrate and report on activist meetings organized by Trotter and others.

5|$|A herbivorous species, Bagheera kiplingi, was {{described}} in 2008, but all other known species are predators, mostly preying on insects and on other spiders, although a few large species also take birds and lizards. It is estimated that the world's 25 million tons of spiders kill 400–800 million tons of prey per year. Spiders use {{a wide range of}} strategies to capture prey: trapping it in sticky webs, lassoing it with sticky bolas, mimicking the prey to avoid detection, or running it down. Most detect prey mainly by sensing vibrations, but the active hunters have acute vision, and hunters of the genus Portia show signs of intelligence in their choice <b>of</b> <b>tactics</b> and ability to develop new ones. Spiders' guts are too narrow to take solids, and they liquefy their food by flooding it with digestive enzymes. They also grind food with the bases of their pedipalps, as arachnids do not have the mandibles that crustaceans and insects have.|$|E
