At that period all the other centres of the Rus' Khaganate faced with destruction, which Constantine Zuckerman associates with Vadim's uprising, as recorded in the East Slavic chronicles.|$|E
25|$|Peirce sought, {{through his}} wide-ranging studies through the decades, formal {{philosophical}} ways to articulate thought's processes, {{and also to}} explain the workings of science. These inextricably entangled questions of a dynamics of inquiry rooted in nature and nurture led him to develop his semiotic with very broadened conceptions of signs and inference, and, as its culmination, a theory of inquiry for the task of saying 'how science works' and devising research methods. This would be logic by the medieval definition taught for centuries: art of arts, science of sciences, having {{the way to the}} principles of all methods. Influences radiate from points <b>on</b> <b>parallel</b> <b>lines</b> of inquiry in Aristotle's work, in such loci as: the basic terminology of psychology in On the Soul; the founding description of sign relations in On Interpretation; and the differentiation of inference into three modes that are commonly translated into English as abduction, deduction, and induction, in the Prior Analytics, as well as inference by analogy (called paradeigma by Aristotle), which Peirce regarded as involving the other three modes.|$|E

60|$|The first gun was fired, on this occasion, {{from the}} Désirée, the leading French ship. It was {{directed}} at the Black Prince, and the shot probably told, as Sir Hotham Ward immediately kept away, evidently {{with a desire to}} escape being raked. The French did the same to keep square with their adversaries, and the four vessels now ran <b>on</b> <b>parallel</b> <b>lines,</b> though going different ways, and a short cable's-length asunder. La Désirée followed up her single gun with each division as it would bear, until her whole broadside was delivered. The Black Prince stood it all without answering, though I could see that she was suffering considerably, more especially aloft. At length Sir Hotham Ward was heard in the affair. He let fly his whole broadside, almost simultaneously; and a spiteful, threatening roar it was. The smoke now began to hide his ship, though la Désirée, by moving towards us, kept ahead of her own sulphurous canopy.|$|E
60|$|Hawkeye was not mistaken; {{for when}} the Hurons found their course was likely to throw them behind their chase, they {{rendered}} it less direct, until, by gradually bearing more and more obliquely, the two canoes were ere long, gliding <b>on</b> <b>parallel</b> <b>lines,</b> within two hundred yards of each other. It now became entirely a trial of speed. So rapid was {{the progress of the}} light vessels, that the lake curled in their front, in miniature waves, and their motion became undulating by its own velocity. It was, perhaps, owing to this circumstance, in addition to the necessity of keeping every hand employed at the paddles, that the Hurons had not immediate recourse to their fire-arms. The exertions of the fugitives were too severe to continue long, and the pursuers had the advantage of numbers. Duncan observed, with uneasiness, that the scout began to look anxiously about him, as if searching for some further means of assisting their flight.|$|E

To-morrow, or, as a matter of fact, to-day, since the dawn was not very far, Sotillo would find out in what way the treasure had gone. A gang of Cargadores had been employed in loading it into a railway truck from the Custom House store-rooms, and running the truck on to the wharf. There would be arrests made, and certainly before noon Sotillo would know in what manner the silver had left Sulaco, and who it was that took it out.|$|E

60|$|The army which Hannibal {{had brought}} {{to the foot of}} this country through which he had to pass, {{amounted}} to 102,000 men, of which 12,000 were cavalry and 90,000 infantry. This force passed the Ebro in three bodies of equal strength. The natives opposed a desperate resistance, but the three columns pressed forward <b>on</b> <b>parallel</b> <b>lines.</b> The towns were besieged and captured, and after two months of desperate fighting Catalonia was subdued, but its conquest cost Hannibal twenty-one thousand men, a fifth of his whole army. Hanno was for the time left here with ten thousand infantry and a thousand cavalry. He was to suppress any fresh rising, to hold the large towns, to form magazines for the army, and to keep open the passes of the Pyrenees. He fixed his headquarters at Burgos. His operations were facilitated by the fact that along the line of the sea coast were a number of Phoenician colonies who were natural allies of the Carthaginians, and aided them in every way in their power. Before advancing through the passes of the Pyrenees Hannibal still further reduced the strength of his force by weeding out all those who had in the conflict among the mountains shown themselves wanting in personal strength or in military qualities. Giving these leave to return home he advanced at the head of fifty thousand picked infantry and nine thousand cavalry.|$|E
