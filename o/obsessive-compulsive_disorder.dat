The present paper summarizes {{the changes in the}} DSM diagnostic criteria between the IV-TR edition and the DSM- 5 edition, and evaluates them critically. A central feature is the revision of the category to which these <b>disorders</b> belong: <b>Obsessive-Compulsive</b> <b>Disorders</b> are no longer considered to be anxiety disorders, but rather now comprise an independent category encompassing a broader spectrum of <b>obsessive-compulsive</b> and related <b>disorders.</b> Minor changes have been made to the description of the criteria, and there is a new emphasis on the clinical assessment of the patient's insight level (good, poor, absent). <b>Obsessive-compulsive</b> <b>disorders</b> associated with tic disorders are classified as a separate subtype. The present paper discusses these changes {{on the basis of the}} available studies and literature, and then looks ahead to the implementation of the new criteria in the everyday clinical setting and in research...|$|R

5|$|In most cases, {{medication}} for tics is not necessary. Education {{is an important}} part of any treatment plan, and explanation and reassurance alone are often sufficient treatment. Many individuals with Tourette's go undiagnosed or never seek medical care. Among those who are seen in specialty clinics, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and <b>obsessive–compulsive</b> <b>disorder</b> (OCD) are present at higher rates. These co-occurring diagnoses often cause more impairment to the individual than the tics; hence, it is important to correctly identify associated conditions and treat them.|$|E

5|$|The first {{clinical}} study of psilocybin {{approved by the}} U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since 1970—led by Francisco Moreno at the University of Arizona {{and supported by the}} Heffter Research Institute and the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies—studied the effects of psilocybin on patients with <b>obsessive–compulsive</b> <b>disorder</b> (OCD). The pilot study found that, when administered by trained professionals in a medical setting, the use of psilocybin was associated with substantial reductions in OCD symptoms in several of the patients. This effect is caused largely by psilocybin's ability to reduce the levels of the 5-HT2A receptor, resulting in decreased responsiveness to serotonin.|$|E
5|$|Non-genetic, environmental, post-infectious, or psychosocial factors—while not causing Tourette's—can {{influence}} its severity.

2500|$|An {{elaborate}} {{classification of}} mental disorders {{was developed in the}} 10th century by Arabian psychologist Najab ud-din Unhammad. His nosology included nine major categories {{of mental disorders}}, with 30 different mental illnesses in total. Some of the categories he described resembled <b>obsessive-compulsive</b> <b>disorders,</b> delusional disorders, degenerative diseases, involutional melancholia, and states of abnormal excitement.

5|$|Psychotic {{symptoms}} may {{be present}} in several other mental disorders, including bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, drug intoxication, and drug-induced psychosis. Delusions ("non-bizarre") are also present in delusional disorder, and social withdrawal in social anxiety disorder, avoidant personality disorder and schizotypal personality disorder. Schizotypal personality disorder has symptoms that are similar but less severe than those of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia occurs along with <b>obsessive-compulsive</b> <b>disorder</b> (OCD) considerably more often than {{could be explained by}} chance, although {{it can be difficult to}} distinguish obsessions that occur in OCD from the delusions of schizophrenia. A few people withdrawing from benzodiazepines experience a severe withdrawal syndrome which may last a long time. It can resemble schizophrenia and be misdiagnosed as such.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{all people}} with Tourette's have comorbid conditions, most Tourette's {{patients}} presenting for clinical care at specialty referral centers may exhibit symptoms of other conditions {{along with their}} motor and phonic tics. Associated conditions include attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADD or ADHD), <b>obsessive–compulsive</b> <b>disorder</b> (OCD), learning disabilities and sleep disorders. Disruptive behaviors, impaired functioning, or cognitive impairment in patients with comorbid Tourette's and ADHD may {{be accounted for by}} the comorbid ADHD, highlighting the importance of identifying and treating comorbid conditions. Disruption from tics is commonly overshadowed by comorbid conditions that present greater interference to the child. Tic disorders in the absence of ADHD {{do not appear to be}} associated with disruptive behavior or functional impairment, while impairment in school, family, or peer relations is greater in patients who have more comorbid conditions and often determines whether therapy is needed.|$|E
5|$|Anxiety {{disorder}} and {{major depressive disorder}} {{are the most common}} conditions seen at the same time; comorbidity of these in persons with AS is estimated at 65%. Reports have associated AS with medical conditions such as aminoaciduria and ligamentous laxity, but these have been case reports or small studies and no factors have been associated with AS across studies. One study of males with AS found an increased rate of epilepsy and a high rate (51%) of nonverbal learning disorder. AS is associated with tics, Tourette syndrome, and bipolar disorder, and the repetitive behaviors of AS have many similarities with the symptoms of <b>obsessive–compulsive</b> <b>disorder</b> and obsessive–compulsive personality disorder. However many of these studies are based on clinical samples or lack standardized measures; nonetheless, comorbid conditions are relatively common.|$|E
