5|$|A lesbian is {{a female}} homosexual: a female who {{experiences}} romantic love or sexual attraction to other females. The term lesbian {{is also used}} to express sexual identity or sexual behavior regardless <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>orientation,</b> or as an adjective to characterize or associate nouns with female homosexuality or same-sex attraction.|$|E
5|$|China before westernization {{was another}} society that {{segregated}} men from women. Historical Chinese culture has not recognized a concept <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>orientation,</b> or a framework to divide people {{based on their}} same-sex or opposite-sex attractions. Although {{there was a significant}} culture surrounding homosexual men, there was none for women. Outside their duties to bear sons to their husbands, women were perceived as having no sexuality at all.|$|E

50|$|Initially, {{members of}} the {{national}} media were well aware <b>of</b> Rogers's <b>sexual</b> <b>orientation,</b> yet it was widely reported that Rogers was not married and left no children.

5|$|In some jurisdictions, asexuals have legal protections. While Brazil bans since 1999 {{whatever}} pathologization or attempted treatment <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>orientation</b> by {{mental health}} professionals through the national ethical code, the U.S. state of New York has labeled asexuals as a protected class. However, asexuality does not typically {{attract the attention of}} the public or major scrutiny; therefore, it has not been the subject of legislation as much as other sexual orientations have.|$|E
5|$|Ryan opposes {{same-sex}} marriage, {{had previously}} supported a constitutional ban on same-sex marriage, opposed {{the repeal of}} the don't ask, don't tell policy, voted against same-sex couples adopting children in Washington D.C., and voted against a bill that would expand federal hate crime laws to cover offenses based on a victim's sexual orientation. Unlike most of his fellow Republicans, Ryan voted in favor of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act in 2007, which would have prohibited employment discrimination on the basis <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>orientation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic is a 2006 graphic memoir by the American {{cartoonist}} Alison Bechdel, {{author of}} the comic strip Dykes to Watch Out For. It chronicles the author's childhood and youth in rural Pennsylvania, United States, focusing on her complex relationship with her father. The book addresses themes <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>orientation,</b> gender roles, suicide, emotional abuse, dysfunctional family life, {{and the role of}} literature in understanding oneself and one's family. Writing and illustrating Fun Home took seven years, in part because of Bechdel's laborious artistic process, which includes photographing herself in poses for each human figure.|$|E

He voted for the Employment Non-Discrimination Act of 2007, which would have prevented employment discrimination on the basis <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>orientation.</b> He voted against the Federal Marriage Amendment, which would have constitutionally outlawed same-sex marriage, in 2004 and 2006, and co-sponsored the Respect for Marriage Act of 2009, which would allow the federal government to recognize same-sex marriages.|$|E
5|$|On January 18, 1977, the Dade County Commission {{approved}} {{a law that}} would outlaw discrimination on the basis <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>orientation</b> in employment, housing, and public services. Commissioner Ruth Shack proposed the bill on December 7, 1976 at the request of a gay lobbying organization, named the Dade County Coalition for the Humanistic Rights of Gays, that was less than a year old. The group was headed by three gay activists: Jack Campbell, an owner of 40gay bathhouses across the United States, political and gay activist Bob Basker, and Bob Kunst, a local publicist and enthusiast of the Human Potential Movement.|$|E
5|$|With {{regard to}} sexual {{orientation}} categories, asexuality may be argued {{as not being}} a meaningful category {{to add to the}} continuum, and instead argued as the lack of a sexual orientation or sexuality. Other arguments propose that asexuality is the denial of one's natural sexuality, and that it is a disorder caused by shame of sexuality, anxiety or sexual abuse, sometimes basing this belief on asexuals who masturbate or occasionally engage in sexual activity simply to please a romantic partner. Within the context <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>orientation</b> identity politics, asexuality may pragmatically fulfill the political function of a sexual orientation identity category.|$|E

5|$|A person's {{experience}} in managing sexuality after the injury relies {{not only on}} physical factors like severity and level of the injury, but on aspects of life circumstances and personality such as sexual experience and attitudes about sex. As well as evaluating physical concerns, clinicians {{must take into account}} factors that affect each patient's situation: gender, age, cultural, and social factors. Aspects of patients' cultural and religious backgrounds, even if unnoticed before the injury caused sexual dysfunction, affect care and treatmentsâ€”particularly when cultural attitudes and assumptions of patients and care providers conflict. Health professionals must be sensitive to issues <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>orientation</b> and gender identity, showing respect and acceptance while communicating, listening, and emotionally supporting. Providers who treat SCI have been found to assume their patients are heterosexual or to exclude LGBTQ patients from their awareness, potentially resulting in substandard care. Academic research on sexuality and disability under-represents LGBTQ perspectives as well.|$|E
5|$|The Sultan of Brunei's {{stake in}} the {{ownership}} of the hotel drew controversy in April 2014 when he initiated {{the first phase of}} a three-phase plan to adapt Brunei's legal system to include aspects of Sharia law implicating his approval of the persecution of homosexuals in the complex legal system there (a two part system involving separate courts and legislation for Islamic and non-Islamic citizens). In protest, a United States national LGBT advocacy organization, the Gill Action Fund, canceled its reservation to hold a conference of major donors at the Beverly Hills Hotel and demanded a refund of its deposit. The hotel management responded by issuing a statement asserting that it does not discriminate on the basis <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>orientation.</b> Fashion designers Brian Atwood and Peter Som subsequently called for wider protests, urging the fashion industry to boycott all of the hotels owned by the Dorchester Collection.|$|E
5|$|The jurist Richard Posner saw Tripp as {{reviving}} psychiatrist Richard von Krafft-Ebing's {{theory that}} masturbation helps to cause homosexuality by fixating a {{boy on the}} male genitals, based on evidence that homosexuals begin masturbating earlier than heterosexuals. Posner criticized the theory {{on the grounds that}} homosexuality and early masturbation could both be effects of whatever factor might be responsible for causing homosexuality. The geneticist Dean Hamer wrote that The Homosexual Matrix was influential and that Tripp provided the clearest articulation of the social learning theory <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>orientation.</b> However, Hamer found the theory itself implausible, and rejected it on numerous grounds, arguing that it is inconsistent with anthropological evidence and human evolutionary history, and fails to explain the existence of homosexuality.|$|E

25|$|The Sell Assessment <b>of</b> <b>Sexual</b> <b>Orientation</b> (SASO) was {{developed}} to address the major concerns with the Kinsey Scale and Klein Sexual Orientation Grid and as such, measures sexual orientation on a continuum, considers various dimensions <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>orientation,</b> and considers homosexuality and heterosexuality separately.
