After Bohemond was released, he was defeated by the Seljuks at the Battle of Harran in 1104; this defeat led to renewed pressure on Antioch from both the Seljuks and the Byzantines. Bohemond left Tancred in control of Antioch and returned in the West, touring Italy and France for reinforcements.

25|$|Because of his {{extensive}} education, according to Anna Komnene, Isaac {{was placed in}} charge of the inquest against the philosopher John Italos in February 1082. Finding him guilty of unorthodox teachings, Isaac sent Italos before an ecclesiastical tribunal. In 1083, he donated precious sacral vestments to the Monastery of Petritzos, founded by the general Gregory Pakourianos. In 1087, on account of the Pecheneg raids into the Balkans, the confiscation of ecclesiastical treasure was repeated. According to John the <b>Oxite,</b> some recalcitrant monks who tried to hide precious vessels were even whipped and imprisoned. Once again Leo of Chalcedon began to denounce these measures, and in late 1087 Isaac, who once again was left in charge of Constantinople in his brother's absence, exiled him to either Sozopolis or Mesembria on the Black Sea coast of Thrace.|$|E
25|$|Isaac was the second-eldest son {{and third}} {{child of the}} domestikos ton scholon John Komnenos and Anna Dalassene. The exact date of his birth is unknown, but was {{probably}} around 1050. According to his niece, the historian-princess Anna Komnene (Alexiad, 77â€“78), he was physically similar to his younger brother, the future emperor Alexios, though paler and his beard less bushy. According to Anna, he enjoyed hunting and war, putting himself {{in the vanguard of}} battles. Anna and other contemporaries like Theophylact of Ohrid underline Isaac's goodness and his capability of befriending people, although Anna also mentions that he was often possessed of a short temper, that could suddenly explode on account of a single word. According to all sources, Isaac was extremely well educated; the Patriarch of Antioch, John the <b>Oxite,</b> records that he was competent in the interpretation of scripture, while Basil of Euchaita credits him with an extensive knowledge of philosophical matters. Only a handful of his writings survive: three treatises on philosophy, directed against the Neoplatonist philosopher Proclus, and a theological compilation against Leo of Chalcedon.|$|E

40|$|The use of {{synthetic}} antioxidants in human consuming products is in disuse due to health toxic related issues. The search for substances to substitute synthetic antioxidants boosts studies {{concerned with the}} findings of sources of natural antioxidants. Thus, the aim of this work was to evaluate the use of comminuted leaves of rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L.) as source of natural antioxidants for the lipid protection of different emulsion compositions using central composite rotary experimental design. The <b>Oxitest</b> analysis (oxidation test reactor) revealed rosemary to be an excellent source of antioxidants for emulsions, even with addition of low quantities, and the gain of induction point tripled. The oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORACFL) results of emulsion obtained separately for the hydrophilic and lipophilic phases showed that the presence of polar compounds was in higher concentration, about 500 more than of non-polar ones. The polar compounds are major responsible for the antioxidant action in the system...|$|R

50|$|Peter of Narbonne was Bishop of Albara south east of Antioch from 1098-1100 {{after the}} Crusaders led by Robert of Normandy {{captured}} the city mostly inhabited by Muslims. Peter was ordained bishop as Peter I of Narbonne by John VII the <b>Oxite,</b> the (Greek) Eastern Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch. The appointment {{was made by}} the Patriarch because there was no Orthodox bishopric already established in Albara now populated by Christians. The new Latin bishop's elevation marked the beginning of a Latin Church resident in the East, greatly encouraged by the Crusaders to see the local Greek ecclesiastics replaced by Latin ones.|$|E

John the <b>Oxite</b> was reinstated as patriarch by Adhemar of Le Puy, the papal legate, who wished to keep good relations with the Byzantines, especially as Bohemond was clearly planning to claim the city for himself. However, the city was now short on food, and Kerbogha's army was still on its way. Kerbogha arrived only two days later, on 5 June. He tried, and failed, to storm the city on 7 June, and by 9 June he had established his own siege around the city.|$|E

Though under Muslim control, the majority of Antioch's inhabitants were Christians.

To prepare for their arrival he imprisoned the Eastern Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch, John the <b>Oxite,</b> turned St Paul's Cathedral into a stable and expelled many leading Christians from the city. Yaghi-Siyan then sent out appeals for help: his request was turned down by Ridwan of Aleppo because of personal animosity, however Yaghi-Siyan was more successful in his approaches to other nobles in the region and Duqaq of Damascus, Toghtekin, Kerbogha, the sultans of Baghdad and Persia, and the emir of Homs all agreed to send reinforcements. Meanwhile, back in Antioch Yaghi-Siyan began stockpiling supplies in anticipation of a siege.|$|E

He was imprisoned by the Turkish governor, Yaghi-Siyan, who {{suspected}} his loyalty. On occasion he was hung from the walls and his feet were hit by iron rods. According to the Historia belli sacri (c. 1131), after the siege the Christian women of the city went to release the imprisoned patriarch, only to find that he could not stand, his legs having been weakened by so long a confinement [...] He was released and re-established as Patriarch when the crusaders captured the city in 1098. The crusaders soon established a Latin bishop in Albara (where there was no Greek bishop established) Peter of Narbonne. Peter was consecrated by John. The Patriarch John coexisted with Peter until John became politically inconvenient for the first Prince of Antioch, Bohemund I. Bohemund accused him of conspiring with the Byzantine Empire, an old enemy of Bohemund and his Norman family, and John was exiled to Constantinople in 1100. The Eastern Orthodox Church was repressed in favour of the Latin Church. under Bernard of Valence, who succeeded Peter of Narbonne and took the position of Patriarch, establishing the line of Latin Patriarchs of Antioch. In Constantinople, John resigned and entered a monastery in Oxia, where he wrote anti-Latin treatises. A new Greek Patriarch was appointed in Constantinople until it was possible to restore them in Antioch later in the 12th century.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{essential}} {{features of}} the Meshless Local Petrov-Galerkin (MLPG) method, and of the Local Boun-dary Integral Equation (LBIE) method, are critically ex-amined from the points {{of view of a}} non-element interpolation of the Â®eld variables, and of the meshless numerical integration of the weak form to generate the stiffness matrix. As truly meshless methods, the MLPG and the LBIE methods hold a great promise in computational mechanics, because these methods do not require a mesh, either to construct the shape functions, or to integrate the Petrov-Galerkin weak form. The characteristics of various meshless interpolations, such as the moving least square, Shepard function, and partition of unity, as candidates for trial and test functions are investigated, and the advan-tages and disadvantages are pointed out. Emphasis is placed on the characteristics of the global forms of the nodal trial and test functions, which are non-zero only over local sub-domains XJtr and X I te, respectively. These nodal trial and test functions are centered at the nodes J and I (which are the centers of the domains XJtr and X I te), respectively, and, in general, vanish at the boundaries oXJtr and <b>oXIte</b> of...|$|E
