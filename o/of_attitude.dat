The pelts {{were used in}} clothing, tiger-skin chuba being worn by singers and participants in horse racing festivals, and had become status symbols. In 2004, international conservation organizations launched successful environmental propaganda campaigns in China against the Tibetan tiger skin trade.

After leaving King Diamond, Michael Denner opened up a recordshop in Copenhagen, until 1988, when he formed the band Lavina (which would later become Zoser Mez), along with former bandmate Hank Shermann. Hank Shermann had formed the hard rock band Fate in 1985, after having left Mercyful Fate.

40|$|The social {{psychology}} literature on attitudes is reviewed. The structure <b>of</b> <b>attitudes</b> is examined {{in terms of}} two conceptual issues: whether attitudes {{are made up of}} one or three components and whether the evaluative aspect <b>of</b> <b>attitudes</b> is unidimensional or bidimensional. The possible functions <b>of</b> <b>attitudes</b> are considered, and the relations between attitudes and higher-order constructs such as values and ideologies are discussed. Numerous characteristics <b>of</b> <b>attitudes</b> are defined, including accessibility, ambivalence, and strength. The processes involved in attitude formation are summarized, and the effects <b>of</b> <b>attitudes</b> on information processing are discussed. Finally, the issue of attitude-behavior consistency is examined, focusing on the conditions under which attitudes predict behavior strongly...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} the applicability of a multicomponent model to understanding the bases <b>of</b> <b>attitudes</b> toward people with disabilities. The 108 students (65 females, 43 males) reported their attitudes toward three groups amputees, people with AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome), and the chronically depressed. They also completed measures of four potential components <b>of</b> <b>attitudes</b> toward the groups: (1) stereotypes, (2) symbolic beliefs, (3) emotions, and (4) attributions of control. Results demonstrated that, although the components accounted for {{a significant proportion of}} the variance in attitudes toward all groups, the pattern <b>of</b> prediction <b>of</b> <b>attitudes</b> differed considerably among groups. Findings indicate that men had less favorable attitudes toward people who are chronically depressed than did women, with perceived control being the sole predictor <b>of</b> men's <b>attitudes</b> toward this group. Results suggest that the elimination <b>of</b> prejudicial <b>attitudes</b> will require a heterogeneous approach since components <b>of</b> <b>attitudes</b> appear to be strongly dependent on the type of disability in question. Discussion focuses on the nature <b>of</b> <b>attitudes</b> toward people with disabilities and on potential means <b>of</b> eliminating prejudicial <b>attitudes.</b> (DB) Reproductions supplied by EDRS are the best that can be made from the original document...|$|R
5|$|Between 1871 and 1874, {{while he}} lectured at the Conservatory, Rimsky-Korsakov {{thoroughly}} grounded himself in Western compositional techniques, {{and came to}} believe in the value of academic training for success as a composer. Once Rimsky-Korsakov had made this turn-around, Tchaikovsky considered him an esteemed colleague, and, if not the best of friends, was at least on friendly terms with him. When the other members of The Five became hostile toward Rimsky-Korsakov for his change <b>of</b> <b>attitude,</b> Tchaikovsky continued to support Rimsky-Korsakov morally, telling him that he fully applauded what Rimsky-Korsakov was doing, and admired both his artistic modesty and his strength of character. Beginning in 1876, Tchaikovsky was a regular visitor to the Rimsky-Korsakov home during his trips to Saint Petersburg. At one point, Tchaikovsky offered to have Rimsky-Korsakov appointed to the directorship of the Moscow Conservatory, but he refused.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1790, Hamilton issued {{another set}} of {{recommendations}} in his Second Report on Public Credit. The report called {{for the establishment of}} a national bank and an excise tax on distilled spirits. Hamilton's proposed national bank would provide credit to fledgling industries, serve as a depository for government funds, and oversee one nationwide currency. In response to Hamilton's proposal, Congress passed the Bank Bill of 1791, establishing the First Bank of the United States. The following year, it passed the Coinage Act of 1792, establishing the United States Mint, and the United States dollar, and regulating the coinage of the United States. Historian Samuel Morison points to Hamilton's Second Report as the event that precipitated Jefferson's change <b>of</b> <b>attitude</b> toward Hamilton and his policies. Jefferson feared that the creation of the national bank would lead to political, economic, and social inequality, with Northern financial interests dominating American society much as aristocrats dominated European society.|$|E

5|$|Despite Governor Catts' change <b>of</b> <b>attitude,</b> white mob action {{frequently}} {{occurred in}} towns throughout north and central Florida and went unchecked by local law enforcement. Extrajudicial violence against black residents was so common that it seldom {{was covered by}} newspapers. In 1920, whites removed four black men from jail, who were suspects accused of raping a white woman in Macclenny, and lynched them. In Ocoee the same year, two black citizens armed themselves {{to go to the}} polls during an election. A confrontation ensued and two white election officials were shot, after which a white mob destroyed Ocoee's black community, causing as many as 30 deaths, and destroying 25 homes, two churches, and a Masonic Lodge. Just weeks before the Rosewood massacre, the Perry Race Riot occurred on 14 and 15 December 1922, in which whites burned Charles Wright at the stake and attacked the black community of Perry, Florida after a white schoolteacher was murdered. On the day following Wright's lynching, whites shot and hanged two more black men in Perry; next they burned the town's black school, Masonic lodge, church, amusement hall, and several families' homes.|$|E

25|$|The {{immediate}} {{cause of the}} accident was the loss of spatial orientation by the crew and chiefly by the Captain who was piloting the aircraft during the landing phase. The plane banked left, overturned and went into a rapid descent. The loss of spatial orientation occurred in the night, while flying in the clouds, with autopilot and autothrottle switched off. Poor CRM and insufficient training for using the Western type <b>of</b> <b>attitude</b> indicators contributed to the accident. The pilots had previously flown Tupolev Tu-134 and Antonov An-24 with a different type <b>of</b> <b>attitude</b> indicator (where the bank angle is shown by the movements of an aircraft symbol, and the indicator's background does not turn left or right).|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} intergenerational {{transmission}} <b>of</b> risk <b>attitudes</b> for three risk domains in Burkina Faso. First, our results shows a strong transmission <b>of</b> <b>attitudes</b> from parents to children. Although, estimates from intergenerational transmission <b>of</b> risk <b>attitudes</b> {{in developing countries}} should not be compared directly with those from developed countries, our results goes {{in the same direction}} as previous literature from Germany. That is risk attitudes are transmitted from; parents to children, local enviorment to children and positive assortative mating of parents strengthens the parents’ transmission <b>of</b> <b>attitudes</b> to her child. Second we analyze three generations <b>of</b> risk <b>attitude</b> transmission. Our results indicates that it exist a transmission <b>of</b> risk <b>attitudes</b> from grandparents to their grandchildren. The strength and significance of this socialization decreases when we control for parents risk attitudes. Third, since there are strong gender roles in Burkina Faso, we test if mothers and fathers transmission <b>of</b> risk <b>attitudes</b> on their daughter is the same as on their son. We find that mother’s transmission <b>of</b> risk <b>attitudes</b> is stronger on their daughters than sons. For fathers the pattern is reverse. However, our findings show that it exist a heterogenity in the transmission <b>of</b> risk <b>attitudes</b> in male and female dominated risk domains.

25|$|Following the {{assassination}} of Gemayel in September 1982, Israel's position in Beirut became untenable and the signing of a peace treaty became increasingly unlikely. Outrage following Israel's role in the Phalangist-perpetrated Sabra and Shatila massacre, of mostly Palestinians and Lebanese Shiites, and Israeli popular disillusionment with the war {{would lead to a}} gradual withdrawal from Beirut to the areas claimed by the self-proclaimed Free Lebanon State in southern Lebanon (later to become the South Lebanon security belt), which was initiated following the 17 May Agreement and Syria's change <b>of</b> <b>attitude</b> towards the PLO. After Israeli forces withdrew from most of Lebanon, the War of the Camps broke out between Lebanese factions, the remains of the PLO and Syria, in which Syria fought its former Palestinian allies. At the same time, Shi'a militant groups began consolidating and waging a low-intensity guerrilla war over the Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon, leading to 15 years of low-scale armed conflict. The Lebanese Civil War would continue until 1990, at which point Syria had established complete dominance over Lebanon.|$|E
25|$|A change <b>of</b> <b>attitude</b> was {{eventually}} signalled by the Papists Act 1778 in {{the reign of}} King George III. Under this Act, an oath was imposed, which besides being a declaration of loyalty to the reigning sovereign, contained an abjuration of Charles Edward Stuart, the Pretender to the British throne, and of certain doctrines attributed to Roman Catholics (doctrines such as those stating that excommunicated princes may lawfully be murdered, that no faith should be kept with heretics, and that the Pope has temporal as well as spiritual jurisdiction in the realm). Those taking this oath were exempted {{from some of the}} provisions of the Popery Act. The section as to taking and prosecuting priests were repealed, as also the penalty of perpetual imprisonment for keeping a school. Catholics were also enabled to inherit and purchase land, nor was a Protestant heir any longer empowered to enter and enjoy the estate of his Catholic kinsman. However, the passing of this act was the occasion of the anti-Catholic Gordon Riots (1780) in which the violence of the mob was especially directed against Lord Mansfield who had balked at various prosecutions under the statutes now repealed. The anti-clerical excesses of the French Revolution and the consequent emigration to England of Catholic priests from France led to a softening of opinion towards Catholics {{on the part of the}} English Anglican establishment, resulting in the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1791 which allowed Catholics to enter the legal profession, relieved them from taking the Oath of Supremacy and granted toleration for their schools and places of worship The repeal of the Penal Laws culminated in the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829.|$|E
