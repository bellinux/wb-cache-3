40|$|As {{a result}} of {{important}} advances in medical imaging, the <b>oral</b> <b>cholecystogram</b> {{is no longer the}} primary test of gall-bladder function and anatomy. Real-time ultrasonography and cholescintigraphy, both highly sensitive and specific tests, are the two major methods for assessing gallbladder pathology. Oral cholecystography, endoscopic retrograde pancreatography, and percutaneous gallbladder puncture serve as supplementary tests. Decisions about which test to use depend on the kind of gallbladder disease that is suspect-ed as well as the estimated likelihood of the disease before the information is obtained from the procedure. Thus, ultra-sonography is the test of choice for chronic cholecystitis, with oral cholecystography reserved for situations in which the diagnosis is uncertain after ultrasonography. When acute cholecystitis is suspected, ultrasonography is also the test of choice in most patients, and cholescintigraphy is used to resolve uncertainty...|$|E
40|$|A 14 {{year old}} girl with multiseptate gall bladder and cystic {{dilatation}} of the biliary tree is presented. This is the 20 th published case report {{of patients with}} multiseptate gall bladder and only the second {{to be associated with}} a choledochal cyst. The cystic spaces of the gall bladder did not communicate with the neck of the gall bladder or the rest of the biliary tree, and this unusual feature has not been previously described. A multiseptate gall bladder with a normal biliary tree commonly causes symptoms suggestive of cholecystitis, although gall stones are seldom present. Diagnosis is confirmed by an <b>oral</b> <b>cholecystogram</b> or ultrasound scan that may show the fine intraluminal septae, and these features should be looked for in patients with biliary symptoms without biliary calculi. Cholecystectomy is curative for the isolated gall bladder anomaly but hepaticojejunostomy may be necessary for an associated choledochal cyst...|$|E
40|$|Twenty-six {{patients}} who had typical symptoms of biliary tract disease, e. g. postprandial right upper quadrant pain, nausea and vomiting, fatty food intolerance and flatulence and who had had two or more normal <b>oral</b> <b>cholecystograms</b> were subjected to cholecytokinin cholescystography. Ten patients showed a normal response to the intravenous administration of cholecystokinin, namely prompt and complete emptying of the gallbladder without producing any adverse reaction or symptoms. Sixteen patients demonstrated either no contraction or incomplete contraction of the gallbladder in response to cholecystokinin; several patients had moderate contraction of the gallbladder accompanied by symptoms of biliary colic. This latter group underwent cholecystectomy and operative cholangiography. Fifteen of the 16 patients are asymptomatic or improved, and only one patient continues to have symptoms. All removed gallbladders had histologic evidence of chronic cholecystitis. It is concluded that in some individuals with continuing symptoms suggesting gallbladder disease but normal <b>oral</b> <b>cholecystograms,</b> cholecystokinin cholecystography may {{be helpful in identifying}} physiologic dysfunction of the gallbladder...|$|R

Extensive research has been carried out to understand the physiological and pathological functions of the biliary system, but the mechanism of the pathogenesis of gallstones and pain production still remain poorly understood. It is believed that the mechanical factors play an essential role in the mechanisms of the gallstone formation and biliary diseases. However, despite the extensive literature in clinical studies, only limited work has been carried out to study the biliary system from the mechanical point of view. In this paper, we discuss the state of art knowledge of the fluid dynamics of bile flow in the biliary tract, the solid mechanics of the gallbladder and bile ducts, recent mathematical and numerical modelling of the system, and finally the future challenges in the area...|$|R
40|$|Clinical {{manifestations of}} primary {{amyloidosis}} can be subtle, {{particularly when the}} gastrointestinal tract is involved. We present two cases that illustrate the diversity of such involvement and the subsequent problems with diagnosis. Gastrointestinal effects of primary systemic amyloidosis are reviewed and clinical pointers towards diagnosis are discussed. In particular these cases illustrate the importance of providing all the clinical details to the pathologist and mentioning amyloidosis as a possible diagnosis. CASE 1 A 47 -year-old lady presented to surgical outpatients with a three month history of diarrhoea, mild steatorrhoea, central abdominal discomfort and 4 kg weight loss. She complained of nausea and fatty food intolerance over the preceding two years: <b>oral</b> <b>cholecystogram</b> at another hospital had revealed a solitary large gallstone. Routine biochemical and haematological tests were normal. Three day faecal fats were elevated at 76. 1 mmol/l (normal<I 8 mmol/ 1). Barium meal, follow through and barium enema were normal. Antigliadin antibody, auto-antibody screen and a gut hormone profile were normal. Incidental proteinuria was documented and later measured at 1 g/ 24 hrs. Sh...|$|E
40|$|The {{removal of}} acalculous and not acutely {{inflamed}} gall-bladder {{in patients with}} typical biliary pain remains a questionable procedure. This {{study was conducted to}} present our experience. In the period 1982 - 90, 1089 cases of calculous and acalculous gallbladder disease were treated in our clinic. In this period, 27 patients were subjected to cholecystectomy because of an acalculous, non inflamed gallbladder which was elongated lying in an abnormal position with a long cystic duct. The mean duration ofsymptoms supportive of cholelithiasis, was 5 years. <b>Oral</b> <b>cholecystogram</b> and ultrasonography led to the diagnosis and other causes ofchronic abdominal pain were excluded. There were 13 lumbar, 9 pelvic and 5 iliac gallbladders, with poor function in 20 of them. During cholecystectomy, the organ was invested by peritoneum and suspended in 7 cases from a mesentery. On pathological examination mild chronic inflammation was reported in 19 cases and minimal changes in 8. The minimum follow up was one year and the maximum 9 years. Complete relief of symptoms was achieved in all the cases. In conclusion, cholecystectomy should be offered in these symptomatic "hanging" gallbladders...|$|E
40|$|Gallium {{has been}} shown to {{accumulate}} in metabolically active tissue including sites of in fection. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evalu ate gallium scanning in cholecystitis. Ten pa tients with cholecystitis were studied using conventional gallium scanning techniques. Five patients with acute cholecystitis showed intense gallium accumulation in the gallbladder area. One of five patients with chronic cholecystitis showed significant accumulation in the galiblad der. The limitations of this method are mainly the need for serial scanning to rule out gallium accumulation in the hepatic flexure of the colon and also the failure to detect consistently a chronically diseased fibrotic gallbladder. We conclude that gallium scanning of the gallblad der is an important adjunctive study in the eval uation of cholecystitis. Gallium accumulation within inflammatory tissue has been well documented (1 â€” 3). Gallium accumu lation in empyema of the gallbladder has also been demonstrated (4). The diagnosis of cholecystitis with or without empyema is often difficult especially in patients with fever but without localizing features and in those with vague symptomatology and equiv ocal radiographic studies. This study indicates a pos sible role for gallium in the evaluation of such pa tients. METHODS Ten cases of suspected gallbladder disease were studied. When possible, <b>oral</b> <b>cholecystogram,</b> intr...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} whether a diurnal variation in cholesterol saturation index is present in gall-bladder bile, samples of bile were taken by nasoduodenal intubation and cholecystokinin infusion at 9 am after the conventional 12 hour fast, and also at 5 pm five hours after a meal containing no cholesterol or phospholipid. In healthy controls saturation index (mean +/- SEM) fell from 1. 02 +/- 0. 08 at 9 am to 0. 86 +/- 0. 08 at 5 pm (n = 8, p less than 0. 05). In untreated cholesterol gall-stone patients saturation index fell from 1. 30 +/- 0. 07 to 1. 04 +/- 0. 07 (n = 8, p less than 0. 05); on chenodeoxycholic acid 15 mg/kg/day it fell from 0. 91 +/- 0. 06 to 0. 78 +/- 0. 07 (n = 16, p less than 0. 01). The degree of diurnal variation was similar in those taking chenodeoxycholic acid at bedtime and in those taking it at mealtimes. The 9 am sample was supersaturated in three non-responders (showing no evidence of gall stone dissolution on <b>oral</b> <b>cholecystogram</b> after at least six months treatment) and in four responders. The 5 pm sample was a better predictor of treatment failure, being supersaturated in all four non-responders but in only one out of the 12 responders (p less than 0. 01) ...|$|E
40|$|Gallstone {{lithotripsy}} (LITHO) {{was performed}} on 52 patients who underwent 107 procedures. Two hundred sixty-seven gallstone patients were screened and 215 (81 %) were excluded. Excessive stone burden and nonvisualization by <b>oral</b> <b>cholecystogram</b> (OCG) were the most common reasons for exclusion. The hospital course of 100 excluded patients who later underwent elective cholecystectomy was evaluated for length of hospital stay (2. 3 days) and total cost of treatment ($ 3685. 00). Successful fragmentation to less than 5 mm was achieved in 43 LITHO patients (83 %). Five LITHO patients (10 %) required conversion to operative management. Complications of LITHO included acute cholecystitis (1 of 52 patients) and biliary colic (17 of 52 patients, or 33 %). Multiple procedures in one patient were common. Costs for LITHO were calculated in two ways: first the individual cost {{for each of the}} 52 candidates; second the cost for successful LITHO was calculated by excluding five patients who required operation as well as five patients (10 %) who are predicted failures of LITHO. Including the preoperative evaluation, treatment, recovery room, and follow-up, the individual LITHO cost for 52 patients was $ 8275. 00. If the same total expenditure is calculated after excluding patients who required operation and those predicted to fail, the cost per 'successful' LITHO procedure was $ 10, 245. The cost of 1 year of bile acid therapy is $ 1949. 00 or $ 2413. 00 per 'successful' procedure. Follow-up costs were $ 1232. 00 per patient or $ 1525. 00 per 'successful' procedure. The added LITHO cost incurred by screening eventual noncandidates was $ 904. 00 per successful procedure. The sum of these individual costs was $ 15, 087. 00 per success, as compared to $ 3685. 00 for cholecystectomy. No allowance was made for cost of stone recurrence. Lithotripsy costs appear to be sufficiently high to render the procedure unlikely to emerge as the treatment of choice...|$|E
