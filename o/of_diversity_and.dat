5|$|After Sesame Streets first season, {{its critics}} forced its {{producers}} and researchers to address more overtly such affective goals as social competence, tolerance <b>of</b> <b>diversity,</b> <b>and</b> nonaggressive ways of resolving conflict. These issues were addressed through interpersonal disputes among its Street characters. During the 1980s, the show incorporated the real-life {{experiences of the}} show's cast and crew, including the death of Will Lee (Mr. Hooper) and the pregnancy of Sonia Manzano (Maria) to address affective concerns. In later seasons, Sesame Street addressed real-life disasters such as the September 11 terrorist attacks and Hurricane Katrina.|$|E
5|$|Bournemouth is {{currently}} host {{to a number}} of festivals. Bournemouth Food and Drink Festival is a ten-day event which combines a market with live cookery demonstrations. The Arts by the Sea Festival is a mix of dance, film, theatre, literature, and music which was launched in 2012 by the local university, the Arts University Bournemouth, and is set to become an annual event. The Bourne Free carnival is held in the town each year during the summer. Initially a gay pride festival, it has become a celebration <b>of</b> <b>diversity</b> <b>and</b> inclusion. Since 2008, Bournemouth has held its own air festival over four days in August. This has featured displays from the Red Arrows as well as appearances from the Yakovlevs, Blades, Team Guinot Wing-Walkers, Battle of Britain Memorial Flight including Lancaster, Hurricane, Spitfire and also the last flying Vulcan. The festival has also seen appearances from modern aircraft such as the Eurofighter Typhoon. The air festival attracts up to a million people over the four-day event.|$|E
5|$|Spokane {{has been}} criticized and {{sometimes}} derided for its lack <b>of</b> <b>diversity</b> <b>and</b> multicultural offerings, but the city has become more diverse in recent decades. People from countries in the former Soviet Union (especially Russians and Ukrainians) form a comparatively large demographic in Spokane and Spokane County, {{the result of a}} large influx of immigrants and their families {{after the collapse of the}} Soviet Union in 1991. According to the 2000 Census, the number of people of Russian or Ukrainian ancestry in Spokane County was reported to be 7,700 (4,900 residing in the city of Spokane), amounting to two percent of the county. Among the fastest-growing demographics in Spokane is the Pacific Islander ethnic group, which is estimated to be the third largest minority group in the county, after the Russian and Ukrainian community and Latinos. Spokane was once home to a sizable Asian community, mostly Japanese, centered in a district called Chinatown from the early days of the city until 1974. As in many western railway towns, the Asian community started off as an encampment for migrant laborers working on the railroads. The Chinatown Asian community thrived until the 1940s, after which its population decreased and became integrated and dispersed, losing its Asian character; urban blight and the preparations leading up to Expo '74 led to Chinatown's eventual demolition.|$|E

Eighteen interviews and an in-depth content analysis of student Facebook pages were used to explore the following questions: 1) How do students describe their posting behaviors and engagement with issues <b>of</b> racial <b>diversity</b> <b>and</b> campus climate on social media? 2) How frequently do students use social media to discuss issues <b>of</b> racial <b>diversity</b> <b>and</b> campus climate in either positive or negative ways? and 3) What does participant posting behavior and engagement with issues <b>of</b> racial <b>diversity</b> <b>and</b> campus climate on social media say about the utility of social media in promoting a positive campus climate?...|$|R

25|$|When Harlan {{began his}} service, the Supreme Court faced a heavy {{workload}} that consisted primarily <b>of</b> <b>diversity</b> <b>and</b> removal cases, {{with only a}} few constitutional issues. Justices also rode circuit in the various federal judicial circuits; though these usually corresponded to the region from which the justice was appointed, due to his junior status, Harlan was assigned the Seventh Circuit based in Chicago. Harlan rode the Seventh Circuit until 1896, when he switched to his home circuit, the Sixth, upon the death of its previous holder, Justice Howell Edmunds Jackson.|$|E
25|$|On 24 July 1773, Porto Alegre {{became the}} capital city of the province, when the {{administration}} of Manuel Sepúlveda, who used the fictitious name or pseudonym José Marcelino de Figueiredo, to hide their identity, officially started. In 1824, immigrants {{from all over the world}} started arriving, especially German, Italian, Spanish, Polish, Jewish, and Lebanese.

25|$|Ranks are {{assigned}} based on subjective dissimilarity, {{and do not}} fully reflect the gradational nature of variation within nature. In most cases, higher taxonomic groupings arise further back in time: not because the rate of diversification was higher in the past, but because each subsequent diversification event results in an increase <b>of</b> <b>diversity</b> <b>and</b> thus increases the taxonomic rank assigned by present-day taxonomists. Furthermore, some groups have many described species {{not because they are}} more diverse than other species, but because they are more easily sampled and studied than other group.|$|E

25|$|Genetic {{diversity}} and population {{structure in the}} American land mass using DNA micro-satellite markers (genotype) sampled from North, Central, and South America have been analyzed against similar data available from other indigenous populations worldwide. The Amerindian populations show a lower genetic diversity than populations from other continental regions. Observed is both a decreasing genetic diversity as geographic distance from the Bering Strait occurs and a decreasing genetic similarity to Siberian populations from Alaska (genetic entry point). Also observed is evidence of a higher level <b>of</b> <b>diversity</b> <b>and</b> lower level of population structure in western South America compared to eastern South America. A relative lack of differentiation between Mesoamerican and Andean populations is a scenario that implies coastal routes were easier than inland routes for migrating peoples (Paleo-Indians) to traverse. The overall pattern that is emerging suggests that the Americas were recently colonized by {{a small number of}} individuals (effective size of about 70), and then they grew by a factor of 10 over 800 – 1000 years. The data also show that there have been genetic exchanges between Asia, the Arctic and Greenland since the initial peopling of the Americas.|$|E

500|$|Gene {{annotations}} {{provide the}} [...] "what", while measurements of species diversity provide the [...] "who". In order to connect community composition and function in metagenomes, sequences must be binned. Binning {{is the process}} of associating a particular sequence with an organism. In similarity-based binning, methods such as BLAST are used to rapidly search for phylogenetic markers or otherwise similar sequences in existing public databases. This approach is implemented in MEGAN. Another tool, PhymmBL, uses interpolated Markov models to assign reads. [...] and AMPHORA are methods based on unique clade-specific markers for estimating organismal relative abundances with improved computational performances. Recent methods, such as , use read coverage landscape of individual reference genomes to minimize false-positive hits and get reliable relative abundances. [...] In composition based binning, methods use intrinsic features of the sequence, such as oligonucleotide frequencies or codon usage bias. Once sequences are binned, it is possible to carry out comparative analysis <b>of</b> <b>diversity</b> <b>and</b> richness.|$|E
