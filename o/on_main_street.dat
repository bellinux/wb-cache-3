50|$|The Courthouse (1829) {{dominates the}} Upper <b>Main</b> <b>Street.</b> However, {{it is not}} {{actually}} <b>on</b> the <b>Main</b> <b>Street</b> itself, being located just off it. The Allied Irish Bank (1835) building (formerly the Royal Bank of Ireland) <b>on</b> Upper <b>Main</b> <b>Street</b> is another notable structure in the town. Like many provincial Irish towns, Letterkenny {{has a number of}} fine buildings housing banks. The Bank of Ireland (1874), designed by Timothy Hevey, is one such structure in the town. Located {{at the edge of the}} Market Square <b>on</b> the <b>Main</b> <b>Street,</b> it was originally constructed for the (now defunct) Hibernian Bank.|$|R

The NY28B designation was eliminated in the mid-1960s and replaced with NY920V, an unsigned reference route. Around the same time, NY287 was realigned onto the bypass that now carries NY365 around the northern fringe of {{the village of}} Prospect, truncating NY920V to its current length.|$|E

5|$|In {{the current}} routing, Bus. US223 follows M-52 (Adrian Highway / Main Street) {{and a former}} route of US223 through downtown. The {{southern}} terminus is at US223 at an intersection with M-52 near the southern city line. The business loop runs concurrently with M-52 north into downtown <b>on</b> <b>Main</b> <b>Street,</b> breaking off and running northwesterly along Church Street. From there Bus. US223 turns westward onto Maumee Street. The route follows Maumee Street to its northern terminus, meeting US223 again northwest of downtown Adrian.|$|E
50|$|Streets can be loosely {{categorized}} as <b>main</b> <b>streets</b> and side <b>streets.</b> <b>Main</b> <b>streets</b> are usually broad {{with a relatively}} high level of activity.

Side streets are quieter, often residential in use and character, and {{may be used for}} vehicular parking.|$|R

5|$|M-211 is a two-lane {{highway that}} starts at M-68 in {{downtown}} Onaway. The trunkline runs north {{out of town}} <b>on</b> <b>Main</b> <b>Street</b> past business and residences. It crosses the North Eastern State Trail and passes the Leo E. Getz County Airport north of town. M-211 enters an area of farmland north of the airport. As it continues north and approaches Onaway State Park, the terrain transitions to forest land. M-211 ends at the intersection with Bonz Beach Highway {{in front of the}} state park gate. All of M-211 is undivided highway.|$|E
5|$|Past the US 301 intersection, {{the route}} officially becomes MD 313A, {{but is still}} signed as MD 313. It heads west through {{farmland}} before turning north and intersecting MD 290 (Chesterville Road). The two routes continue north together into Galena, where the road becomes Main Street. It passes residences before intersecting MD 213 (Main Street) {{in the center of}} town where MD 313 ends, MD 290 turns east on Cross Street, and MD 213 goes northbound <b>on</b> <b>Main</b> <b>Street</b> and southbound by going west on Cross Street.|$|E

5|$|Upon leaving Kennedyville, MD 213 {{continues}} {{back into}} agricultural areas. The route makes a {{turn to the}} east, with an old bypassed segment remaining as unsigned MD 855. MD 213 intersects MD 298 (Browntown Road) and resumes northeast and east again. It intersects unsigned MD 449 (Shallcross Wharf Road), which connects to MD 444 (Kentmore Park Road), which MD 213 intersects a short distance later. From here, the route continues east and northeast through more farmland before heading into a mix of farms and woods. The route enters Galena, where it becomes Cross Street. In the center of town, MD 213 meets MD 290 and MD 313 at the intersection with Main Street. Here, MD 290 and MD 313 continue south <b>on</b> <b>Main</b> <b>Street,</b> MD 290 continues east on Cross Street, and MD 213 makes a left turn to head north <b>on</b> <b>Main</b> <b>Street.</b> Main Street passes residences before leaving Galena, where the road becomes Augustine Herman Highway again. The road continues through a mix of farms and woods before reaching Georgetown, where the route passes some homes before crossing the Sassafras River on a drawbridge near a marina.|$|E
5|$|Altgens {{tried to}} find a good camera angle on the bridge, but uniformed police said it was private {{property}} and turned him away, and he moved to a location within the plaza. He began photographing the motorcade <b>on</b> <b>Main</b> <b>Street</b> as the vehicles approached Houston Street, and got a close-up of the presidential limousine as it turned right onto Houston. He then picked up his equipment bag and ran on the grass toward the south curb along Elm Street, stopping across from the Plaza's north colonnade. Altgens heard a loud noise {{at about the same time}} as his first photograph from that spot (simultaneous to Zapruder film frame 255), but he did not recall having any reaction since he thought the noise came from a firecracker.|$|E
5|$|At this point, NY75 turns northeastward, {{overlapping}} with US62 into {{the nearby town}} of Hamburg along Gowanda State Road. Development along the highway quickly rises in density from a large farm and a pocket of homes {{at the start of the}} concurrency to a series of residential streets across the town line that make up the hamlet of Water Valley. The influx of homes brings US62 and NY75 across the main channel of Eighteenmile Creek and into the village of Hamburg, where the highway changes names to Pierce Avenue. The two routes remain concurrent for three blocks to an intersection with Lake Avenue, where Pierce Avenue becomes Main Street. While US62 continues east into Hamburg's central business district <b>on</b> <b>Main</b> <b>Street,</b> NY75 follows Lake Street northward along the mostly residential western edge of the village.|$|E
