5|$|Umar and {{his senate}} {{identified}} this act as misuse of state treasure, {{though not as}} punishing as to lose one's office, Khalid was already warned not act as alone, he should seek permission from his commander or Caliph for such actions. He immediately {{wrote a letter to}} Abu Ubaidah asking him to bring Khalid in front of the congregation, his turban, and take off his cap. Umar wanted Abu Ubaida to ask Khalid from what funds he gave to Ash'as: from his own pocket or from the state treasury? If he confessed to having used the spoils, he was guilty of misappropriation. If he claimed that he gave from his own pocket, he was guilty of extravagance. In either case he would be dismissed, and Abu Ubaida would take charge of his duties. Abu Ubaida was himself an admirer of Khalid and loved him as his younger brother, and so said that he was not capable <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it.</b> Instead, Bilal ibn Ribah was appointed for this task and called back Khalid from Chalcis to Emessa, where he was charged publicly. Khalid stated that he gave money from his own pocket and thus was declared innocent in that charge. However, when he went to Abu Ubaida, he told him that he had been dismissed on the order of Umar and is required to go back to Medina.|$|E

500|$|In Takumi's {{initial draft}} of the story, the second episode, [...] "Turnabout Sisters", was the first episode of the game. The {{development}} team decided {{that it did not}} work well as something that would ease players into the game, because of its length among other factors. Because of this, Takumi wrote a shorter episode, [...] "The First Turnabout", which was used as the game's first episode.

The third episode was written {{for the sake of the}} character Miles Edgeworth, and the theme of the fourth episode was [...] "rekindling the relationship". In it, Takumi tried to portray an intensively strong friendship between Phoenix and Edgeworth; he did wonder if that was what people got from it, saying that some people interpreted the bond between Phoenix and Edgeworth as [...] an [...] "intensively passionate bond". Because of these two episodes, Takumi considered Edgeworth to in a way be the game's protagonist. The classroom trial in the game's fourth episode was based on real events: when Takumi was in second grade, he had found a 5 yen coin and put it in his pocket; his teacher accused him of stealing it from another student, and made him apologize to her.|$|E
