5|$|The second torpedo struck Bismarck in her stern <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>port</b> side, {{near the}} port rudder shaft. The {{coupling}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>port</b> rudder assembly was badly damaged and the rudder became {{locked in a}} 12° turn to port. The explosion also caused much shock damage. The crew eventually managed to repair the starboard rudder but the port rudder remained jammed. A suggestion to sever the port rudder with explosives was dismissed by Lütjens, as damage to the screws would have left the battleship helpless. At 21:15, Lütjens reported that the ship was unmanoeuvrable.|$|E
5|$|As the {{aircraft}} climbed, No. 1 engine <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>port</b> wing developed a fuel leak. The flight crew responded by {{shutting down the}} engine and feathering its propeller. The flight crew declared an emergency and requested a blind approach to RAF Abingdon. The controller alerted emergency services on the ground. A short time later, cockpit instruments alerted the flight crew to a large loss of fuel from No. 2 fuel tank, the second of four such tanks in the port wing. In an effort to stop the leak, the crew de-activated the fuel cocks and boosters for the No. 2 tank, but left them on for the No. 1 tank. As the Beverley turned on to final approach for RAF Abingdon the crew attempted to increase power from the remaining three Bristol Centaurus engines but No. 2 engine – also <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>port</b> wing – failed to respond and {{the aircraft}} began to lose speed and height.|$|E
5|$|The {{secondary}} armament for Montana and {{her sisters}} was to be 20 /54 cal guns housed in 10 turrets along the island of the battleship; five on the starboard side and five <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>port.</b> These guns, designed specifically for the Montanas, were to be the replacement for the /38 cal secondary gun batteries then in widespread use with the US Navy.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:We {{introduce}} {{a framework for}} adaptive reduction of the degrees of freedom associated with ports in static condensation (SC). We apply this framework to the SC reduced basis (RB) method and thus combine parametric model order reduction for {{the interior of a}} component with model order reduction <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ports</b> in order to rapidly construct an approximate Schur complement linear system of reduced size. <b>The</b> <b>port</b> reduction framework invokes quasi-rigorous a posteriori error bounds for adaptation and allows a combination of empirical functions (snapshot-based) and eigenfunctions for the representation of <b>the</b> solution <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ports...</b>|$|R

Released in 1981, the 2600 port was the first game to use bank switching, a technique developed by Carl Nielsen's group of engineers that increased available ROM space from 4 KB to 8 KB. Brad Stewart, the programmer tasked to work <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>port,</b> used bank switching to complete the game. A port for the Atari 5200, identical to the Atari 8-bit computer version, was in development in 1982, but was not published.|$|E

5|$|During World War I, {{a pair of}} 50-caliber 76-millimeter guns on high-angle mounts were fitted as {{anti-aircraft}} (AA) guns, one gun at the bow and {{the other}} on top of 'X' turret. In 1925 the number of 50-caliber 76-millimeter guns was reduced to 13, all mounted on the turret tops, and six new 40-caliber 76-millimeter guns were installed abreast the aft funnel. Two license-built 2-pounder AA guns were also fitted. In 1926 the rangefinders were upgraded and a fixed aircraft catapult was mounted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>port</b> side of the forecastle for a Macchi M.18 seaplane.|$|E

50|$|Rassvet solved both {{of these}} issues. NASA {{did not need to}} add another payload flight to {{accommodate}} the MLM outfitting equipment, as it could attach the hardware to the exterior of MRM-1. The ISS now had 4 docking <b>ports</b> available <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Russian segment: <b>the</b> aft <b>port</b> of Zvezda, <b>the</b> <b>port</b> of Pirs, later MLM (<b>on</b> <b>the</b> nadir <b>port</b> of Zvezda), <b>the</b> <b>port</b> of MRM-2 (<b>on</b> <b>the</b> zenith <b>port</b> of Zvezda), and <b>the</b> <b>port</b> <b>on</b> MRM-1 (<b>on</b> <b>the</b> nadir <b>port</b> of Zarya).

EF-84E 49-2115 {{was used as a}} FICON test aircraft with a B-36 host. EF-84E 49-1225 and EF-84E 51-634 were test aircraft for the ZELMAL (Zero-length launch, Mat landing) experiments version for point defense, used the booster rocket from MGM-1 Matador cruise missile.|$|E
5|$|For Pellew, {{the victory}} was an {{encouraging}} {{sign of the}} weakness of the Dutch squadron. In October, Captain Peter Rainier seized another Dutch frigate from Batavia harbour itself and the following month Admiral Pellew led a large scale raid <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>port</b> that eliminated most of the Dutch East Indies squadron. Two ships of the line escaped Pellew's attack, but they were old and in a poor state of repair, and so were unable to defend themselves when Pellew discovered and destroyed them at Griessie in 1807.|$|E

On 19August 1942, with air and naval gunfire support, the division's 4th and 6th Infantry Brigades assaulted Dieppe's beaches. The Germans were well prepared and, despite being reinforced, the Canadians sustained heavy losses {{and had to be}} evacuated, with fewer than half their number returning to the United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|In 1977, British Airways and Singapore Airlines {{shared a}} Concorde for flights between London and Singapore International Airport at Paya Lebar via Bahrain. The aircraft, BA's Concorde G-BOAD, was painted in Singapore Airlines livery <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>port</b> side and British Airways livery on the {{starboard}} side. The service was discontinued after three return flights because of noise complaints from the Malaysian government; {{it could only}} be reinstated on a new route bypassing Malaysian airspace in 1979. A dispute with India prevented Concorde from reaching supersonic speeds in Indian airspace, so the route was eventually declared not viable and discontinued in 1980.|$|E

5|$|On U.S. Navy vessels, even-numbered {{compartments}} {{are found}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>port</b> side, but zero {{is reserved for}} compartments that intersect the centerline. That is, the numbers read 6-4-2-0-1-3-5 from port to starboard. In the game of roulette, the number 0 does not count as even or odd, giving the casino an advantage on such bets. Similarly, the parity of zero can affect payoffs in prop bets when the outcome depends on whether some randomized number is odd or even, {{and it turns out}} to be zero.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} end of World War I, the number of 50-caliber 76mm guns was reduced to 13, all mounted on the turret tops, and six new 40-caliber 76-millimeter {{anti-aircraft}} (AA) guns were installed abreast the aft funnel. In addition two license-built 2-pounder AA guns were mounted on the forecastle deck. In 1925–26 the foremast was replaced by a four-legged mast, which was moved forward of the funnels, the rangefinders were upgraded, and the ship was equipped to handle a Macchi M.18 seaplane mounted on the center turret. Around that same time she was equipped with a fixed aircraft catapult <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>port</b> side of the forecastle.|$|E
