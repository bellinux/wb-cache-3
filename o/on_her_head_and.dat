5|$|Bond dispatches Sévérine's {{guards and}} sneaks aboard her boat. After he joins {{her in the}} shower, the two have sex. While {{approaching}} Silva's base on Dead Island, Sévérine becomes more afraid and tells Bond {{that it is not}} too late to retreat. However, they are taken prisoner by the guards, handcuffed and escorted through an abandoned city on the island. She explains to Bond that Silva made the natives believe a leak at the local chemical plant required them to evacuate the island. This allowed him to use it as his base of operations. Sévérine is separated from Bond, and is brutally beaten for her betrayal. After Bond is interrogated by Silva, he is taken to a courtyard, where Sévérine is bound to a statue. Silva places a shot glass of whiskey <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> challenges Bond to shoot it with an antique percussion cap pistol. Bond misses the target, and Silva responds by shooting her in the head.|$|E
5|$|Andrei is {{once again}} at the Andronikov Monastery as famine and war grip the country. He no longer paints and never speaks, and keeps Durochka with him as a fellow {{companion}} in silence. Several refugees discuss the problems in their respective home towns, and one man talks in a broken voice of his escape from Vladimir. He is recognised by a younger monk as the long absent Kirill. He has suffered during his {{time away from the}} monastery and begs the father superior to allow him to return. His wish is granted but he is instructed to copy out the holy scriptures fifteen times in penance. A group of Tatars stops at the monastery while travelling through the region, much to the concern of Andrei and Kirill who experienced their brutality first hand. Durochka is too simple minded to remember what the Tatars did and is fascinated by one of the soldier's shining breastplate. The group taunt and play with her, but the soldier takes a liking to her, putting his horned helmet <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> dressing her as a bride, finally deciding to take her away with him as his eighth, and only Russian, wife. Andrei attempts to stop her from leaving, but she is determined and rides away with the Tatars. Kirill talks to Andrei {{for the first time since}} they both left the monastery, and he assures him that Durochka won't be in any danger, as harming a holy fool is considered bad luck, and she will be let go. Andrei continues his menial work of carrying large hot stones from a fire with tongs to heat water for the monastery, but drops the stone in the snow.|$|E

The students invited Harry and Polly to their annual Quartre Arts Ball, an invitation the couple embraced with enthusiasm. Harry fashioned a necklace of four dead pigeons, sported a red loincloth, and brought along a bag of snakes. Caresse wore a sheer chemise to her waist, a huge turquoise wig <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> nothing else. They both dyed their skin with red ochre. The students cheered Caresse's toplessness, and she was carried around on the shoulders of 10 students.|$|E

She was rescued by a police sergeant and {{was admitted to the}} [...] on Lützowstrasse. As she was without papers and refused to identify herself, she was admitted as Fräulein Unbekannt ("Miss Unknown") to a mental hospital in Dalldorf (now Wittenau, in Reinickendorf), where she remained for the next two years. The unknown patient had scars <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> body and spoke German with an accent described as [...] "Russian" [...] by medical staff.|$|E
500|$|The singer also wore a short dress {{coupled with}} a {{platinum}} bob wig; another version of the dress had a gown attached to it, with Gaga wearing a long wig inspired by Donatella Versace. Before the final performance Gaga wore black latex pants and a top, with a green wig <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> a necklace made of marijuana leaves. Finally, Gaga also wore a seashell bikini top and voluminous wig; the ensemble had been worn by Gaga in previous live performances for the Artpop era. Her dancers wore neon colored outfits with matching head gears and accessories. Gaga also {{had a number of}} unique props, including a Gibson Flying V guitar during [...] "Venus", a plastic chair shaped like a claw and a keytar which was shaped like a sea horse.|$|E
500|$|He also {{developed}} her hair styles for the series, which Roddenberry insisted must be unique and futuristic {{so that the}} viewers could believe they were seeing the future on television. She originally appeared with straight hair in promotion photos, but this was changed to a beehive, which was so solid looking that Bob Justman joked that [...] "You could hit it with a sledgehammer and never make a dent." [...] It was created by weaving two Max Factor wigs into a mesh cone. Whitney described {{the application of the}} wig, saying [...] "they nailed it to my head every morning." [...] It was created by placing a cone <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> then weaving the blonde hair from two separate wigs together resulting in such an unusual look that Whitney said she was unrecognizable without it. In the press, she explained that on the show, Rand would have stuck her head in a machine which would have made up her hair instantly. The wig was later stolen from the Desilu lot after Whitney was no longer on the series; it was never recovered.|$|E

500|$|Miss Rosa {{undertakes}} chemotherapy {{to treat}} her cancer which leaves her bald. Rosenblat did not shave her head for the role because she worried about other roles. She had to wear a silicone [...] "appliance" [...] <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> neck. Each morning on set makeup artist Josh Turri made up the appliance onto her. The process would take approximately three hours and Turri added false beauty marks, eyebrows and small veins to complete Miss Rosa's look. Rosenblat described him as [...] "utterly brilliant and a perfectionist ... so you got this entirely organic sense that I was utterly bald and suffering [...] cancer." [...] While on set fellow actors and crew members incorrectly assumed she had shaved her head. The weather during filming also affected Miss Rosa's costumer. During warm weather crew shielded Rosenblat from the sun with umbrellas because the heat would cause the make up to crack. Other breaches were caused by perspiration and Turri would drain water from underneath the prosthetics prior to repairing it. At {{the end of each}} shoot it took Rosenblat 45 minutes to remove the appliance.|$|E
500|$|Within {{twenty minutes}} of Saldívar's surrender, {{she was taken}} to the {{downtown}} police station in Corpus Christi and placed in an interrogation room with investigators Paul and Ray Rivera. Paul Rivera, who had investigated homicides since 1978, informed Saldívar of her right to an attorney, which she waived. When police investigators surrounded Saldívar's truck, she had cried out, [...] "I can't believe I killed my best friend". Within hours, she was saying the shooting was accidental. Saldívar's bail bond was initially set at $100,000, but District Attorney Carlos Valdez persuaded the presiding judge to raise it to $500,000. When bail was announced, fans asked why the death penalty had not been sought. The Nueces County jail was deluged with death threats and there were public calls for vigilante justice. Some gang members in Texas were reported to have taken up collections to raise the bond for Saldívar so they could kill her when she was released. In prison, she faced more death threats from inmates. The Mexican Mafia, a dominant gang in the Texas penal system, reportedly placed a price <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> spread the word that anyone who committed the crime would be a hero.|$|E
500|$|Fellini was {{a notorious}} perfectionist, {{and this could}} be trying for his cast. At an American Film Institute student seminar, Quinn spoke of Fellini's intransigence over {{selecting}} a box in which Zampanò carries his cigarette butts, scrutinizing over 500 boxes before finding just the right one: [...] "As for me, any of the boxes would have been satisfactory to carry the butts in, but not Federico". Quinn also recalled being particularly proud of a certain scene in which his performance had earned applause from onlookers on the set, only to receive {{a phone call from}} Fellini late that night informing him {{that they would have to}} re-do the entire sequence because Quinn had been too good: [...] "You see, you're supposed to be a bad, a terrible actor, but the people watching applauded you. They should have laughed at you. So in the morning we do it again." [...] As for Masina, Fellini insisted that she re-create the thin-lipped smile he had seen in her childhood photographs. He cut her hair by putting a bowl <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> shearing off anything that wasn't covered up, afterwards plastering what remained with soap to give it a [...] "spiky, untidy look", then [...] "flicked talc into her face to give it the pallor of a kabuki performer." [...] He made her wear a World War I surplus cloak that was so frayed its collar cut into her neck. She complained: [...] "You're so nice and sweet to the others in the cast. Why are you so hard on me?" ...|$|E

A woman named [...] "Alice" [...] answered the ad. The woman was actually Parent. Soon after, McGowan disappeared; on July 19, 1990, her remains were found in a rural canal in St. Lucie County, Florida. She had been mutilated by removing a tattoo <b>on</b> <b>her</b> stomach, <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> hands to hinder the identification of her corpse but a small tattoo was enough to identify her.|$|R
500|$|In 1994, Walton {{described}} her character as, [...] "Very {{much like a}} latter-day Scarlett O'Hara. She is very manipulative and feels she is strongly justified in her actions. Jill is an individual who {{has a lot of}} difficulty in seeing what she truly is." [...] Additionally, she said that once Jill [...] "she gets a plan in her head, nothing will divert her." [...] In 1998, Walton's co-star Jeanne Cooper described Jill as [...] "Wile E. Coyote". Walton conceded that the analogy is true, saying that Jill is in [...] "constant turmoil". She stated: [...] "She gets the anvil dropped <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> falls off the cliff. She cries and then tells everyone her new plan and how she's going to rule the world. Then it's off the cliff again." [...] Walton has said that Jill can be [...] "can be such a shrew" [...] and [...] "gets her happiness where she can, and she certainly is not going to contain her anger. She lets it out, so it does not fester in there. She is on a roller coaster though, I will say that much." [...] In 2009, Walton stated that she had [...] "really missed Jill being bad", but upon the character crashing Katherine's wedding to Patrick Murphy (Michael Fairman), she said that [...] "this is pretty bad". Walton stated in an interview in 2003 that she does like portraying the [...] "dark side" [...] of Jill, but rather her comedic side. She also described Jill as being [...] "so strong" [...] and [...] "such a survivor".|$|E
