Doctors were given the right of <b>opting</b> <b>out</b> of out-of-hours care in 2007, under a controversial pay deal, signed by then-Health Secretary John Reid, which awarded them a 22 percent pay rise in 2006. Brown also stated in the manifesto that the NHS was his top priority.|$|E

He could not accept any theory of two nations, however worded, because it would make of those neither French nor English second-class citizens.|$|E
5|$|The 1959–60 season saw Davidson {{confronted with}} an arduous eight Test {{tour of the}} Indian subcontinent, with three and five Tests against Pakistan and India respectively. Flat and dry pitches unconducive to fast bowling {{combined}} with oppressive heat confronted the players. On the last tour, many of the Australians had fallen ill with food positioning, and Davidson had asked Donald Bradman, the Australian Chairman of Selectors if <b>opting</b> <b>out</b> of the tour was permitted. Bradman turned him down. Davidson was consistent throughout the Pakistan series, taking four wickets {{in each of the}} three Tests, to end with 12 wickets at 24.83. He also batted solidly, with 47 and 39* in the latter two Tests to end with 90runs at 45.00. His contributions helped Australia to a 2–0 series result; it was the first time Pakistan had lost a Test on home soil and the pair of victories were its last in Pakistan for 39years. He had particular success against Imtiaz Ahmed, removing him four times.|$|E

5|$|Throughout his career, James {{has taken}} a unique {{approach}} to his playing contracts, usually opting to sign shorter term deals {{in order to maximize}} his earnings potential and flexibility; for example, in 2006, he and the Cavaliers negotiated a three-year, $60million contract extension instead of the four-year maximum as it allotted him the option of seeking a new contract worth more money as an unrestricted free agent following the 2010 season. This move ultimately allowed James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh to sign with the Heat together. During his second stint in Cleveland, he began <b>opting</b> <b>out</b> and re-signing on new contracts after each season in order to take advantage of higher salaries resulting from the NBA's rising salary cap. In 2016, he signed with the Cavaliers on a three-year deal, becoming the highest-paid player in the league {{for the first time in}} his career.|$|E
5|$|On February 21, 2013, Young {{signed a}} minor league deal with the Washington Nationals and an {{invitation}} to training camp. On March 26, 2013 he was granted his unconditional release by the Nationals after <b>opting</b> <b>out</b> of his contract. He was re-signed by the Nationals on April 4, 2013. He was then assigned to Triple-A Syracuse. He made his season debut on April 23 against Rochester, giving up 6 runs in 4.2 innings. He made 6 additional starts before going {{on the disabled list}} with a neck injury on May 28, 2 days after leaving a start against Columbus after the first inning. He made 2 starts {{at the end of the}} year in the Gulf Coast League and with Short-Season Auburn before the end of the injury-marred season. In 9 total starts, he went 1–2 with a 6.81 ERA, striking out 21 in 37 innings. After experiencing pain in his shoulder and neck, he had surgery to repair what was diagnosed as thoracic outlet syndrome. This condition is a nerve problem that puts pressure on a pitcher's shoulder. On November 19, 2013, Young re-signed with the Nationals on {{a minor league}} deal. He was released on March 25, 2014.|$|E
5|$|With India's older players <b>opting</b> <b>out</b> of {{the inaugural}} World Twenty20, Pathan {{was one of}} several younger players to regain {{national}} selection. India were not expected to do well in a format that favoured stronger fielding sides. In the first match, he scored 20 and took 2/20 in four overs as India tied with Pakistan in the first round, before winning in a bowl-out. He then took 0/16 from two chamatkar as India lost to New Zealand before taking 3/37 in a defeat of England. India needed a win over hosts South Africa to reach the semi-final and Pathan conceded only 16 runs from his four overs, helping to restrict the hosts to 9/116 in pursuit of 154. Pathan then took 2/44, removing Brad Hodge and Andrew Symonds as India managed to defend 188 for a 15-run win to reach the finals. India faced arch-rivals Pakistan in the final. Pathan was declared the Man of the match after bowling a tidy spell and taking 3/16, including the removal of Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik and then the big-hitting Shahid Afridi for a duck in the space of three balls, before later bowling Yasir Arafat.|$|E

The free-entry analysis reveals that fewer firms enter under <b>opt</b> <b>out</b> as competition becomes harsher, and that <b>opt</b> <b>out</b> is the socially preferred default option...|$|R

40|$|In {{evolutionary}} {{game theory}} interactions between individuals are often assumed obligatory. However, in many real-life situations, individuals can decide to <b>opt</b> <b>out</b> of an interaction {{depending on the}} information they have about the opponent. We consider a simple evolutionary game theoretic model to study such a scenario, where at each encounter between two individuals the type of the opponent (cooperator/defector) is known with some probability, and where each individual either accepts or <b>opts</b> <b>out</b> of the interaction. If the type of the opponent is unknown, a trustful individual accepts the interaction, whereas a suspicious individual <b>opts</b> <b>out</b> of the interaction. If {{either of the two}} individuals <b>opt</b> <b>out</b> both individuals remain without an interaction. We show that in the prisoners dilemma optional interactions along with suspicious behaviour facilitates the emergence of trustful cooperation...|$|R
