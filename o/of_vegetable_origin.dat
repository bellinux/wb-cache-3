40|$|Purpose. Modeling the {{dispersion}} {{of the biological}} tissue impedance <b>of</b> <b>vegetable</b> and animal <b>origin</b> using the Fricke equivalent circuit; development of a technique for experimental data processing to determine the approximation coefficients of the {{dispersion of}} the biological tissue impedance for this equivalent circuit; study {{of the features of}} the equivalent circuit at modeling the dispersion of the impedance, resistance, and reactance; the definition of the frequency domain in which using of the equivalent circuit is correct; revealing and generalization of the main regularities of dissipation of biological tissue impedance <b>of</b> <b>vegetable</b> and animal <b>origin.</b> Methodology. The technique is based on the scientific provisions of theoretical electrical engineering – the theory of the electromagnetic field in nonlinear media in modeling the dispersion of the biological tissue impedance. Results. The electric circuit of the Fricke equivalent circuit allows modeling the dependences of the impedance module of biological tissues, active and reactive components of impedance with acceptable accuracy for practical purposes in the frequency domain from 103 to 106 Hz. The equation of impedance of the Fricke equivalent circuit for biological tissues makes it possible to approximate the frequency dependences of the impedance modulus, active and reactive parts of the total resistance only by using the approximation coefficients corresponding to each part. The developed method for determining the values of the approximation coefficients of the impedance equation for the Fricke equivalent circuit for biological tissues allows to determine these values with high accuracy for various biological tissues. It is shown that the frequency dependences of the active component of the total resistance for tissues <b>of</b> <b>vegetable</b> and animal <b>origin</b> are similar. Originality. The developed technique operates with the normalized values of the impedance modulus of the Fricke equivalent circuit, the active and reactive components of the impedance as a function of frequency, which allows a comparative analysis of the dependencies of these parameters of various biological tissues of plant and animal origin. Practical value. The approximate dependences of the absolute impedance modulus, active and reactive components of the impedance allow modeling processes occurring in biological tissues with the passage of a current of different frequency. Dependence of the impedance of biological tissue {{can be applied to the}} design of diagnostic and control equipment to determine the properties of tissues <b>of</b> animal and <b>vegetable</b> <b>origin,</b> including developing more effective medical equipment...|$|R
