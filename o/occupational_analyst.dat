50|$|In 1986, Trapnell became {{chairman}} of Cambridge <b>Occupational</b> <b>Analysts</b> (COA), eventually retiring in 2005. He put enormous effort into establishing the uptake of COA career programmes {{throughout the country}} and in organising training courses and visits to schools in the late eighties and nineties. His combination of scientific insight, wide-ranging interest in the arts, writing skills and personal contacts were of immense value.|$|R

40|$|The US Department of Labor (DOL) {{proposes to}} replace the Dictionary of Occupational Titles (DOT) with the Occupational Information Network (O*NET), an online {{database}} of holistic ratings. We examined the degree of interrater agreement that was present in ratings of 1, 147 “occupational units ” (OUs) on the 52 one-item scales of the O*NET Ability Survey. Interrater rs among raters judging each OU were highly variable, and often quite low (range =-. 46 to. 99, median =. 51), as were rWG indices using locally-derived error terms (medians in the. 50 ’s); standard rWG statistics were much higher (rWG and rWGmax medians =. 81 and. 92), which we attributed to inflation in the rWG error terms caused by raters not using {{the full range of}} scale values. Monte Carlo analyses raised further questions regarding O*NET data quality, given that rWG results computed using simulated raters who made random ratings having zero true agreement (rWG and rWGmax medians =. 64 and. 84) were only modestly lower than the real-rater results used to form the actual O*NET database. We conclude that much more research on O*NET reliability and validity is needed. Although it has been relied upon by job and <b>occupational</b> <b>analysts</b> since 1939 to provide a national standard of occupationa...|$|R
40|$|During the {{downsizing}} of the Defense Department {{resulting from}} the end of the Cold War, the Services have had to turn over many support jobs to Defense Department civilians and private contractors. Many of those civilian government employees, however, have a military reserve commitment and are sometimes deployed as a military member, not as a civilian employee. Contingency and mobilization manpower planners must back-fill vacant civilian positions, and finding these replacements is a very challenging process. The problem is intensified when planners try to satisfy military shortfalls by attempting to link specialties across the uniformed services since each service has its own occupational classification system. The USAF Armstrong Laboratory is currently conducting a research project to link occupations between civilian and military personnel and among military personnel across all the Services. The research is focused on three possible methods: (1) the use of <b>occupational</b> <b>analysts</b> to perform expert analysis of the specialties by reading job text descriptions and making linkages based on expert judgment, (2) the use of existing automated data bases to link each specialty description, and (3) applying the automated approach to a subset of occupations previously chosen by the Service. Once one or several methodologies is selected for validation, a series of analyses will be conducted to rate the reliability of the methodologies and the accuracy of the linkages. This concept paper will discuss the operational problem, the alternative methodologies that can be used to approach it, and the validation of the alternative methodologies...|$|R
