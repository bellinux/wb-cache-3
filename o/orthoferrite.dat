50|$|This {{led to the}} {{possibility}} of making a memory system similar to the moving-domain twistor concept, but using a single block of magnetic material instead of many twistor wires. Starting work extending this concept using <b>orthoferrite,</b> Bobeck noticed an additional interesting effect. With the magnetic tape materials used in twistor, the data had to be stored on relatively large patches known as domains. Attempts to magnetize smaller areas would fail. With <b>orthoferrite,</b> if the patch was written and then a magnetic field was applied to the entire material, the patch would shrink down into a tiny circle, which he called a bubble. These bubbles were much smaller than the domains of normal media like tape, which suggested that very high area densities were possible.|$|E
50|$|An <b>orthoferrite</b> is {{any of a}} {{class of}} {{chemical}} compounds with the formula RFeO (where R is one or more rare-earth elements). Orthoferrites have an orthorhombic crystal structure with a space group Pbnm and most are weakly ferromagnetic.At the Néel temperature TN the subsystem of iron ions orders into a slightly canted antiferromagnetic structure with antiferromagnetic moment G and a weak ferromagnetic moment F. The rare-earth ion subsystem acquires magnetization m due to an interaction with the iron subsystem.The orthoferrites are particularly interesting {{because of the presence}} of an antisymmetric exchange interaction which involves the vector cross product of neighboring spins as opposed to the usual scalar product. In the absence of this interaction, the orthoferrites would be antiferromagnetic. Its presence leads to a small canting of the sublattices, making the orthoferrites “weak” ferromagnets with 4πMs = 100 G. Another interesting feature of these materials is the fact that some of them exhibit a transition as a function of temperature, in which the direction of the antiferromagnetically ordered spins and consequently also of the net magnetization rotates by 90°.|$|E

In this experiment circularly polarized femtosecond laser pulses {{set up a}} strong magnetic field along the wave vector of the radiation through the inverse Faraday effect, thereby exciting non-thermally the spin dynamics of dysprosium <b>orthoferrites.</b> A theoretical study is performed by using a model for <b>orthoferrites</b> based on a general form of free energy whose parameters are extracted from experimental measurements. The magnetization dynamics is described by solving coupled sublattice Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equations whose damping term {{is associated with the}} scattering rate due to magnon-magnon interaction. Due to the inverse Faraday effect and the non-thermal excitation, the effect of the laser is simulated by magnetic field Gaussian pulses with temporal width of the order of hundred femtoseconds. When the field is along the z-axis, a single resonance mode of the magnetization is excited. The amplitude of the magnetization and out-of-phase behavior of the oscillations for fields in z and -z directions are in good agreement with the cited experiment. The analysis of the effect of the temperature shows that magnon-magnon scattering mechanism affects the decay of the oscillations on the picosecond scale. Finally, when the field pulse is along the x-axis, another mode is excited, as observed in experiments.
