It was another disappointing season for Queensland, who were again winless; they lost three matches, hung on for a draw, eight wickets down in another, and the other two fixtures were washed out before the second innings. Tallon scored 204 runs at 22.66 without managing a half-century and made 17 dismissals.|$|E

25|$|American {{football}} {{is an important}} part of many Thanksgiving celebrations in the United States, a tradition that dates to the earliest era of the sport in the late 19th century. Professional football games are often held on Thanksgiving Day; until recently, these were the only games played during the week apart from Sunday or Monday night. The National Football League has played games on Thanksgiving every year since its creation. The Detroit Lions have hosted a game every Thanksgiving Day from 1934 to 1938 and again every year since 1945. In 1966, the Dallas Cowboys, who had been founded six years earlier, adopted the practice of hosting Thanksgiving games. The league added a third game in prime time in 2006, which aired on the NFL Network, then moved to NBC in 2012. The third game has no set site or team, providing an <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> teams in the league to host a Thanksgiving game in the future.|$|E

25|$|On 4 January 1974, Harry Schwarz met and had {{discussions with}} Gatsha (later Mangosuthu) Buthelezi, Chief Executive Councillor {{of the black}} {{homeland}} of KwaZulu. They agreed on a five-point plan for racial peace in South Africa that {{became known as the}} Mahlabatini Declaration of Faith. The declaration's purpose was to provide a blueprint for government of South Africa for racial peace in South Africa. It called for negotiations involving all peoples, in order to draw up constitutional proposals stressing <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> with a Bill of Rights to safeguard these rights. It suggested that the federal concept was the appropriate framework for such changes to take place. It also first affirmed that political change must take place though non-violent means. The concept of a non-discriminatory society had been outlined in the 'Act of Dedication' of 1973 that Schwarz had written, while Leader of the Opposition in the Transvaal. Schwarz had called for the Transvaal and South Africa to adopt and subscribe to the act. While the United Party Transvaal caucus unanimously adopted the initiative, the National Party refused for it to come to debate.

In 2010, the club celebrated its 150th anniversary, and as part of the celebrations performed a set of joint concerts with the Harvard University and University of Virginia Glee Clubs, taking a variety of music including contemporary American songs, folk and Renaissance music. Rardin said [...] "It's a wonderful <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> of us to see, hear and learn from three different ensembles." ...|$|E
500|$|On May 21, 1937, Roosevelt visited Westmoreland Homesteads to {{mark the}} arrival of the community’s final homesteader. Accompanying her on the trip was the wife of Henry Morgenthau, Jr., the president's Secretary of the Treasury. [...] "I am no believer in paternalism. I do not like charities," [...] she had said earlier. But {{cooperative}} communities such as Westmoreland Homesteads, she went on, offered an alternative to [...] "our rather settled ideas" [...] that could [...] "provide equality of <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> and prevent the recurrence of a similar disaster [...] in the future." [...] Residents were so taken by her personal expression of interest in the program that they promptly agreed to rename the community in her honor. (The new town name, Norvelt, was a combination of the last syllables in her names: EleaNOR RooseVELT.) The Norvelt firefighter's hall is also named Roosevelt Hall in honor of her.|$|E
