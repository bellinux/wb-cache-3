5|$|In May 2014, Sinclair {{disclosed}} in an FCC filling {{that it was}} unable to find buyers for the three affected stations, requiring changes to its transaction. In Harrisburg, Sinclair chose to retain WHP-TV, and divest WHTM to Media General. However, in Charleston and Birmingham, the company proposed to shut down stations entirely (rather than selling them to other buyers that would also handle their <b>operational</b> <b>responsibilities)</b> so it could maintain legal duopolies; surrendering the licenses for WCIV and the full-powered repeaters of WBMA-LD (WJSU and WCFT), and moving their ABC programming to Sinclair's existing stations WMMP and WABM respectively – which would shift their existing MyNetworkTV programming to digital subchannels. After nearly a year of delays, Sinclair's deal to acquire Allbritton was approved by the FCC on July 24, 2014.|$|E

The first five meteorologists reported to the Lincoln location, but forecasting responsibilities remained at the Peoria and Springfield offices. By September 1995 the Lincoln office began full-time operations sand picks up the counties from the Peoria and Springfield offices as well as a few from the Saint Louis and Evansville offices.

5|$|Rodriguez again won the AL MVP {{award in}} 2007, as his 54 {{home runs and}} 156 RBIs topped the AL; he scored 143 runs, the highest single-season number by a player since 1985. After {{starting}} the year 21–29, the Yankees rallied to win the AL's wild card berth; {{it was the first}} time in 10 seasons that they did not win the AL East. New York's season ended in the first round of the playoffs; the Indians won the opening two games of the ALDS and finished the series in four games. Manager Torre did not re-sign after the season, and Joe Girardi took his place. Rodriguez, who used an opt-out clause in his contract to become a free agent, stayed with the Yankees by signing for $275million over 10 seasons, an MLB record. The 2008 season was the Yankees' last in which they played at the original Yankee Stadium. The club had sought a new stadium to increase revenues, following the example set by other MLB teams. It was also the first in which Hal and Hank Steinbrenner ran the team as general partners; though George Steinbrenner was still the principal owner on paper, he yielded <b>operational</b> <b>responsibilities</b> during the 2007 offseason. Yankee Stadium was the site of the 2008 All-Star Game, but for the first time in 14 years did not host playoff action. New York ended the year third in the AL East and failed to qualify for the postseason.|$|E

25|$|On May 8, 2017, Sinclair Broadcast Group—owner of MyNetworkTV {{affiliate}} WTVZ-TV (channel 33)—entered into {{an agreement}} to acquire Tribune Media for $3.9 billion, plus the assumption of $2.7 billion in debt held by Tribune, pending regulatory approval by the FCC and the U.S. Department of Justice's Antitrust Division. While WTKR is not in conflict with existing FCC in-market ownership rules and would be acquired by Sinclair in any event, the group is precluded from acquiring WGNT directly as broadcasters are not currently allowed to legally own more than two full-power television stations in a single market (both WGNT and WTVZ-TV rank below the ratings threshold that forbids common ownership {{of two of the}} four highest-rated stations by total day viewership in a single market). As such, the companies may be required to sell either WGNT or WTVZ to another broadcasting group in order to comply with FCC ownership rules and alleviate potential antitrust issues preceding approval of the acquisition; however, a sale of either of the two lower-rated stations to an independent buyer is dependent on later decisions by the FCC regarding local ownership of broadcast television stations and future acts by Congress. Alternatively, Sinclair may opt to either take over the operations of WTKR/WGNT or transfer ownership of and retain <b>operational</b> <b>responsibilities</b> for WTVZ-TV through a local marketing agreement with one of its partner companies.|$|E

Lê Đức Thọ, head of the Central Organizing Commission, said the party had become [...] "a cumbersome and ponderous mechanism, only marginally efficient, marked by ill-defined responsibilities and poorly divided functions." [...] He further stated that confusion within the party over <b>operational</b> <b>responsibilities</b> between the central party leadership, mass organizations and the state, and between higher and lower party echelons had developed into a serious problem, and that a cynical collective mindset within the party had taken hold and manifested itself through corruption, inflexibility and dishonesty.|$|E

That it was far from over was apparent in a series of cables exchanged between the two air vice-marshals in January 1945. Jones sent a signal to Bostock complaining of the latter’s [...] "insubordinate tone" [...] and [...] "repeated attempts to usurp authority of this Headquarters". Bostock replied that as AOC RAAF Command he was [...] "responsible to Commander, Allied Air Forces, and not, repeat not, subordinate to you", and that he would [...] "continue to take the strongest exception to your unwarranted and uninformed interference". Despite such acrimony, the command structure remained unchanged for the rest of the war.|$|E
