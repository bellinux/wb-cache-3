5|$|Cooking oil is flammable, {{and fires}} {{may be caused}} by it igniting at too high a temperature. Further, {{attempts}} to extinguish an <b>oil</b> <b>fire</b> with water cause an extremely dangerous condition, a boilover, as they cause the water to flash into steam due to the high heat of the oil, in turn sending the burning oil in all directions and thus aggravating the fire. This {{is the leading cause of}} house fires in the United Kingdom. Instead, <b>oil</b> <b>fires</b> must be extinguished with a non-water fire extinguisher or by smothering. Other means of extinguishing an <b>oil</b> <b>fire</b> include application of dry powder (e.g., baking soda, salt) or fire fighting foam. Most commercial deep fryers are equipped with automatic fire suppression systems using foam.|$|R
40|$|Cooking <b>oil</b> <b>fires</b> in kitchens are {{difficult}} to extinguish as {{they are easy to}} re-ignite. Such kind of fires are different from the conventional flammable liquid fuel fires and have been classified into a new fire class, i. e. Class F, by some international recognized standard institutions such as National Fire Protection Association. Water mist fire suppression systems are proposed to suppress kitchen fires. In this paper, results in small-scale experiments using cone calorimeter on suppressing cooking <b>oil</b> <b>fires</b> with water mist will be reported. It is observed that good design of the system can suppress peanut <b>oil</b> <b>fire</b> effectively. There might be adverse effects on enhancing the combustion, producing more carbon monoxide and giving out more dark smoke for improper design. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R
