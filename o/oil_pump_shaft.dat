50|$|The 351W {{is often}} {{confused}} with the 351 Cleveland, which is a different engine of identical displacement.The 351 cuin L Windsor featured a 1.3 in (32.5 mm) taller deck height than the 302, allowing a stroke of 3.5 in (88.9 mm). Although very much related in general configuration to the 289-302 and sharing the same bell housing, motor mounts, and other small parts, the 351W had a unique, tall-deck block, larger main bearing caps, thicker, longer connecting rods, and a distinct firing order (1-3-7-2-6-5-4-8 versus the usual 1-5-4-2-6-3-7-8, a means to move the unacceptable 'noise' of the consecutive firing adjacent front cylinders to the more rigid rear part of the engine block all while reducing excessive main bearing load), adding some 25 lb (11 kg) to the engine's dry weight. The distributor is slightly different, so as to accommodate a larger <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> <b>shaft</b> and larger oil pump. Some years had threaded dipstick tubes. It had a unique head which optimized torque over high-rpm breathing, frequently replaced by enthusiasts with aftermarket heads providing better performance. The early 1969 and 1970 heads had larger valves and ports for better performance. The head castings and valve head sizes from 1969 to 1976 were different, notably in passages for air injection and spark plug diameters (1969-1974 18 mm, 1975 and up 14 mm). From 1977 onward, the 351W shared the same head casting as the 302, differing only in bolt hole diameters (7/16 inch for 302, 1/2 inch for 351W). Early blocks (casting ID C9OE-6015-B) had enough metal on bearing saddles 2, 3, and 4 for four-bolt mains, and as with all small-block Fords (SBFs), were superior in strength to most late-model, lightweight castings. Generally, the 1969 to 1974 blocks {{are considered to be}} far superior in strength than the later blocks, making these early units some of the strongest and most desirable in the entire SBF engine family including the 335-series. During the 1980s, a four-barrel version (intake manifold casting ID E6TE-9425-B) was reintroduced for use in light trucks and vans. In 1988, fuel injection replaced the four-barrel carburetor. Roller camshaft/lifters were introduced in this engine in 1994.|$|E
50|$|In , the inline six engines {{underwent}} a major redesign for the EA Falcon and now featured a new {{single overhead cam}} (SOHC) crossflow aluminum head. The camshaft and auxiliary shaft are driven by a 'duplex' chain. The duplex chain drives the distributor and the <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> <b>shafts.</b> The camshaft is supported on the cylinder head by using 'topless' bearings. Bearing liners are not used. The camshaft is held in position using valve spring pressure. Hydraulic lash adjusters mounted on the rocker arms are used to provide zero valve lash. As with all previous and current models, the block is cast iron, but with {{a reduction in the}} cylinder bore to try to reduce emissions.|$|R

5000|$|Near {{the end of}} May 1915, {{while it}} was based at Douai with Feldflieger Abteilung 62, the Fokker factory {{outfitted}} Parschau's aircraft with the first trial version of the Fokker Stangensteuerung synchronizer and a Parabellum MG14 light machine gun, leaving the wing panels in the stock A.III airframe's [...] "shoulder-winged" [...] location while armed and in Parschau's use in May and June 1915. Parschau made several attempts at aerial combat during June 1915, but at this stage the gear proved very unreliable, the Parabellum gun repeatedly jamming in action.

The mid-fuselage wing mount modification was not fitted to the initial batch of five M.5K/MG production prototypes as originally built, with Otto Parschau's second Eindecker, the first M.5K/MG built bearing IdFlieg serial E.1/15 uniquely getting it sometime while in service.

50|$|There is {{a common}} oiling problem with the pre-1992 R32 RB26 motors, as the surface where the {{crankshaft}} meets the <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> was machined too small, eventually leading to <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> failure at high rpm.

40|$|The {{implementation}} of the ASEAN-China Free Trade Agreement (ACFTA) forces the small and medium enterprises {{to have a high}} competition between the manufacturer from China and the ASEAN member countries. One of the competitions occurs on the market of centrifugal pump for fisherman ship. The SME product, made in Tegal, has a lower price but also has a short lifespan. The imported product is now preferred by the fisherman due to its better performance and its longer lifespan. The main problem of the SME pump comes from the excessive wear at the <b>pump</b> <b>shaft,</b> indicated by a collection of deep scratch at two locations in <b>pump</b> <b>shaft.</b> This paper investigates the cause of the excessive wear at the SME <b>pump</b> <b>shaft</b> and compares the quality of the SME and imported shaft by conducting material characterization, mechanical testing, and design evaluations. The chemical composition, hardness property, tensile strength, geometrical analysis and bearing design of the both shaft products are compared. Results show that the SME product uses a higher quality material shaft but ignores the good engineering design in developing the fisherman <b>pump</b> <b>shaft</b> product. The absence of the bearing mounting design on the shaft, the lack of lubricant volume and the low quality of the seals on the SME pump product induce the undesirable wear on the <b>pump</b> <b>shaft.</b> The improvement of the shaft design is required to increase the quality of the SME pump...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: This paper {{presents}} {{the study of}} the impeller wear influence on stress-strain state of a centrifugal <b>pump</b> <b>shaft.</b> In agro-industrial sector, centrifugal pumps are used for watering various agricultural crops. During pumping water, a centrifugal pump impeller is usually a subject to influence of various irreversible physical-and-mechanical and physical-and-chemical processes that can result in a certain reduction in its mass. Materials and Methods: We used a comprehensive approach including the analysis of a sufficient number domestic and foreign publications on the research topic and parametric studies conducted on a laboratory-pumping unit. We had modern vibration-based diagnostic equipment, the mathematical models of loading a <b>pump</b> <b>shaft</b> and a finite-element modeling in APM Win Machine software (Beam module). Results: The comparison of the maximum equivalent dynamic stresses obtained according to the proposed method with existing methods for carrying out the checking strength calculation of a centrifugal <b>pump</b> <b>shaft</b> showed that account of the impeller wear significantly changes picture of stress-strain state shaft. Discussion and Conclusions: The amendments proposed by the author in checking strength calculation of a centrifugal <b>pump</b> <b>shaft</b> will allow estimating its stress-strain state in certain production situations...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{hydraulic}} efficiency, modern automatic transmissions tend to apply electric <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> in their hydraulic system. The electric <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> can support the mechanical <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> for cooling, lubrication, and maintaining the line pressure at low engine speeds. In addition, the start–stop function can be realized {{by means of the}} electric oil pump; thus, the fuel consumption can be further reduced. This article proposes a method of applying two-pump system (one electric <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> and one mechanical <b>oil</b> <b>pump)</b> in automatic transmissions based on the forward driving simulation. A mathematical model for calculating the transmission power loss is developed. The power loss transfers to heat which requires oil flow for cooling and lubrication. A leakage model is developed to calculate the leakage of the hydraulic system. In order to satisfy the flow requirement, a flow-based control strategy for the electric <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> is developed. Simulation results of different driving cycles show that there is a best combination of the size of electric <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> and the size of mechanical <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> with respect to the optimal energy conservation. Besides, the two-pump system can also satisfy the requirement of the start–stop function. This research is extremely valuable for the forward design of a two-pump system in automatic transmissions with respect to energy conservation and start–stop function...|$|R
40|$|In {{addition}} to the adequate lubrication of the moving parts, the oil flow in a hermetic reciprocating compressor has a significant influence on the thermal characteristics of a compressor. The present work {{is concerned with the}} investigation of the <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> system of a reciprocating hermetic compressor used in household refrigeration appliances. The considered <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> system consists of a centrifugal pump immersed in the oil sump of the hermetic compressor and a helical groove machined on the crankshaft. The focus of this work lies on the immersed part of the centrifugal <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> and its interaction with the oil in the oil sump. To analyse the flow in the immersed area of the <b>oil</b> <b>pump,</b> the commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software ANSYS Fluent is used. The free surface of the oil flow is modelled with the volume of fluid (VOF) method. A numerical investigation is used to study the influence of the immersion depth and the <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> design on <b>oil</b> mass flow rate and flow field at the <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> intake.
