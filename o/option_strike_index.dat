50|$|It {{is helpful}} to note that implied {{volatility}} is related to historical volatility, but the two are distinct. Historical volatility is a direct measure of {{the movement of the}} underlying’s price (realized volatility) over recent history (e.g. a trailing 21-day period). Implied volatility, in contrast, is determined by the market price of the derivative contract itself, and not the underlying. Therefore, different derivative contracts on the same underlying have different implied volatilities as a function of their own supply and demand dynamics. For instance, the IBM call <b>option,</b> <b>strike</b> at $100 and expiring in 6 months, may have an implied volatility of 18%, while the put <b>option</b> <b>strike</b> at $105 and expiring in 1 month may have an implied volatility of 21%. At the same time, the historical volatility for IBM for the previous 21 day period might be 17% (all volatilities are expressed in annualized percentage moves).|$|R

40|$|This paper explores a {{coordination}} {{model for}} a three-echelon supply chain including two different manufacturers, one distributer and one retailer via the combined option and back contracts. And one manufacturer provides the high wholesale price with low supply disruption risk {{and the other is}} completely the opposite. This differs from the previous supply chain coordination model. Firstly, supply disruption is added to the three-echelon supply chain. Secondly, considering the coordination of the supply chain, we deploy the combined option and back contracts which are seldom used in the previous study. Furthermore, it is interesting that supply disruption risk and buyback factor do not affect the distributor’s order quantity from the manufacturer who has low product price and unreliable operating ability, while the order quantity increases with the rise of option premium and <b>option</b> <b>strike</b> price. The distributor’s order quantity from the manufacturer, which has high product price and reliable operating ability, increases with the rise of supply disruption risk but decreases when the buyback factor, option premium, and <b>option</b> <b>strike</b> price decrease...|$|R

40|$|From biomechanical {{point of}} view, strike pattern plays an {{important}} role in preventing potential injury risk in running. Traditionally, strike pattern determination was conducted by using 3 D motion analysis system with cameras. However, the procedure is costly and not convenient. With the rapid development of technology, sensors have been applied in sport science field lately. Therefore, this study was designed to determine the algorithm that can identify landing strategies with a wearable sensor. Six healthy male participants were recruited to perform heel and forefoot strike strategies at 7, 10, and 13 [*]km/h speeds. The kinematic data were collected by Vicon 3 D motion analysis system and 2 inertial measurement units (IMU) attached on the dorsal side of both shoes. The data of each foot strike were gathered for pitch angle and <b>strike</b> <b>index</b> analysis. Comparing the <b>strike</b> <b>index</b> from IMU with the pitch angle from Vicon system, our results showed that both signals exhibited highly correlated changes between different strike patterns in the sagittal plane (r= 0. 98).

40|$|This study {{introduced}} a novel but simple method to continuously measure footstrike patterns in runners using inexpensive force sensors. Two force sensing resistors were firmly affixed at the heel and second toe of both insoles {{to collect the}} time signal of foot contact. A total of 109 healthy young adults (42 males and 67 females) were recruited in this study. They ran on an instrumented treadmill at 0 °, + 10 °, and - 10 ° inclinations and attempted rearfoot, midfoot, and forefoot landings using real time visual biofeedback. Intra-step <b>strike</b> <b>index</b> and onset time difference between two force sensors were measured and analyzed with univariate linear regression. We analyzed 25, 655 footfalls and found that onset time difference between two sensors explained 80 - 84 % of variation in the prediction model of <b>strike</b> <b>index</b> (R-squared = 0. 799 - 0. 836, p< 0. 001). However, the time windows to detect footstrike patterns on different surface inclinations were not consistent.
