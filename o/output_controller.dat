Our feedback control loop acts on the speed of all server nodes capable of dynamic voltage scaling (DVS), with QoS (Quality of Service) being the reference setpoint. By changing the speed, we change the position of the p-quantile of the tardiness probability distribution, a variable that enables to measure QoS indirectly. Then, the control variable will be the average tardiness, and the setpoint the tardiness value that will position this p-quantile at 1. 0, value at which a request finishes exactly at the deadline. Doing so will guarantee that the QoS will be statistically p. We test this new Tardiness Quantile Metric (TQM) in a SISO PIDF control loop implemented in a multi-tier cluster.
