We assume 1) agents have complete information and play simultaneously; and 2) given the messages announced by the agents, the planner reacts in an optimal way given her beliefs. This transforms the implementation problem into a signaling game. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for interactive implementation under different restrictions on the planner's out-of-equilibrium beliefs. We compare <b>our</b> <b>resu</b> I ts to standard results on Nash implementaUon. lMany thanks to Eric Maskin for his comments. We are also grateful to semina...|$|E

40|$|Multi-channel optical networks, {{although}} {{common in}} telecommunication applications, {{have only recently}} found application in computer systems. Multi-channel optical networks offer the potential for high performance interconnects for both local computer networks and multiprocessor systems. In addition to providing high bandwidth, multichannel optical networks exhibit the capability for scalable broadcast. The absence of scalable broadcast in conventional networks has governed the choice of memory system configuration for many systems, and has in particular favored cache-coherent non-uniform memory access (CCNUMA) over cache-only memory access (COMA) architecture. This paper examines the choice of memory system architecture {{in the presence of}} high bandwidth and scalable broadcast. Using simulation, we compare the performance of CC-NUMA and COMA memory architectures in a multi-channel optical network multiprocessor system. Seven well-known parallel benchmarks are used in the study. <b>Our</b> <b>resu</b> [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Images {{are usually}} {{transmitted}} across the Internet using a lossless protocol such as TCP/IP. Lossless protocols require retransmission of lost packets, which substantially increases transmission time. We introduce a fast lossy Internet image transmission scheme (FLIIT) for compressed images which uses {{forward error correction}} to eliminate retransmission delays. FLIIT couples an embedded quantization scheme with optimized shielding of important portions of the image. We describe a joint source and channel coding algorithm for images that minimizes the expected distortion resulting both from network packet losses and from inexact quantization of transform coefficients. The algorithm adaptively allocates quantizer resolution bits and redundancy bits to image subbands to control quantization errors and expected packet transmission losses. Our packet loss model incorporates the effects of burst losses using a Markov packet loss model with empirically derived parameters. <b>Our</b> preliminary <b>resu</b> [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Searching for {{solutions}} to constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) is NP-hard in general. Heuristics for variable and value ordering have proven useful in guiding the search towards more fruitful {{areas of the}} search space and hence {{reducing the amount of}} time spent searching {{for solutions}}. Static ordering methods impart an ordering in advance of the search and dynamic ordering methods use information about the state of the search to order values or variables during the search. A wellknown static value ordering heuristic guides the search by ordering values basedon an estimate of the number of solutions to the problem. This paper compares the performance of several such heuristics and shows that they do not give a significant improvement to a random ordering for hard CSPs. We give a dynamic ordering heuristic which decomposesthe CSP into spanning trees and uses Bayesian networks to compute probabilistic approximations based on the current search state. <b>Our</b> empirical <b>resu</b> [...] ...|$|R

40|$|While {{individual}} parallel I/O {{systems can}} incorporate sophisticated techniques and achieve impressive performance in particular situations, researchers as yet have only limited {{understanding of the}} impact of various design decisions or of the techniques required for performance robustness. One remedy is to perform detailed comparative studies of different I/O libraries. In this paper, we describe such a study for the Disk Resident Array and Panda libraries, both designed to support high-performance I/O for arrays. While the two systems have many similarities, their designs and implementations are based on different assumptions and target different applications. We base our study on two I/O structures commonly encountered in scientific applications: the collective read/write of an entire array and the collective read/write of an arbitrary array section.

40|$|Strong {{normalization}} {{results are}} obtained {{for a general}} language for collection types. An induced normal form for sets and bags is then used {{to show that the}} class of functions whose input has height (that is, the maximal depth of nestings of sets/bags/lists in the complex object) at most i and output has height at most o definable in a nested relational query language without powerset operator is independent of the height of intermediate expressions used. Our proof holds regardless of whether the language is used for querying sets, bags, or lists, even in the presence of variant types. Moreover, the normal forms are useful in a general approach to query optimization. Paredaens and Van Gucht proved a similar result for the special case when i = o = 1. Their result is complemented by Hull and Su who demonstrated the failure of independence when powerset operator is present and i = o = 1.

40|$|We have {{measured}} {{the levels of}} zinc in serum (Zn-S) and in hair (Zn-H) in 391 adolescents, in good health, aged between 11 and 14 years. To evaluate the relationship between zinc status and sexual maturation we have analyzed, in the same subjects, the serum concentrations of the following hormones: luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), dehydroepiandrosterone-sulphate (DHA-S), testosterone (T) and estradiol (E 2). No significant relationship between zinc in the biological samples and the hormones measured in all subjects was observed; only in prepuberal females was a positive correlation found between Zn-S and E 2. A significant relationship between Zn-S and LH was observed only for males with short stature or low weight (< 25 th percentile) (r = 0. 359, p = 0. 010; r = 0. 47, P = 0. 008, respectively). When prepuberal males with short stature were considered, a significant association between Zn-S and T appeared (r = 0. 399, P = 0. 006). In females with short stature (< 25 th percentile), partial correlation coefficients {{showed a significant association}} between FSH and zinc in hair (r = 0. 435, P = 0. 004), while in girls with low weight, FSH appeared positively related to zinc in hair (r = 0. 470, P = 0. 003) and negatively related to zinc in serum (r = - 0. 320, p = 0. 050). <b>Our</b> <b>resu</b> 1 ts suggest that zinc {{plays an important role in}} the metabolism of hormones linked to sexual maturation...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{new data}} from palaeomagnetic investigations on the Upper Palaeozoic and Mesozoic geological units from the Siberian platform and the Mongol-Okhotsk suture zone. Within the southern {{portion of the}} Mongol-Okhotsk suture we collected palaeomagnetic samples from the Late Permian Belektuy formation (Borzya region; 50. 7 °N, 116. 9 °E) and the Middle-Late Jurassic Shadaron formation (Unda-Daya; 51. 5 °N, 117. 5 °E). We sampled the Late Permian Alentuy formation (Khilok region; 50. 8 °N, 107. 2 °E), the Early to Middle Jurassic Irkutsk sedimentary basin (ISB; 52. 0 °N, 104. 0 °E), the Late Jurassic Badin formation (Mogzon region; 51. 8 °N, 112. 0 °E), and the Early Cretaceous Gusinoozesk formation (Gusinoc Lake region; 51. 2 °N, 106. 5 °E) additionally in the northern region of the Mongol-Okhotsk suture. Apart {{from the results of}} the ISB and Gusinoozersk formations, which show very large ellipses of confidence and might be the present-day geomagnetic field overprint, <b>our</b> <b>resu</b> lts allow us to constrain the evolution of the Mongol-Okhotsk Ocean palaeomagnetically from the Late Permian to the Middle-Late Jurassic. They confirm that this large Permian ocean closed during the Jurassic, ending up in the late Jurassic or the beginning of the Cretaceous in the eastern end of the suture zone, as suspected on geological grounds. However, although geological data suggest a Middle Jurassic closure of the Mongol-Okhotsk Ocean in the west Trans-Baikal region, our data show evidence of a still large palaeolatitude difference between the Amuria and Siberia blocks. This is interpreted {{as a result of the}} quite fast closure of the ocean after the Middle Jurassic. Finally, our new palaeomagnetic results exhibit very large tectonic rotations around local vertical axes, which we interpret as probably arising both from collision processes and from a left-lateral shear movement along the suture zone, due to the eastward extrusion of Mongolia under the effect of the collision of India into Asia...|$|E

Although {{the current}} [CO 2] in the {{atmosphere}} is generally limiting for C available information suggests that the predicted [CO 2] increase will enhance rates in plants. However, it has been previously (B loom 2010, Stitt Krapp 1999) observed that responsiveness of plants to elevated [CO 2] will me mediated by its interaction with other li miting environmental factors, such as nitrogen availabilit y. According to those studies, N availability might decrease or eliminate {{the positive effect of}} elevated CO 2 on photosynthetic rates and consequently plant growth. The ‘capacity’ to adjust photosynthetic activity with plant C requirements {{has been described as a}} key process co nditioning photosynthetic performance under elevated [CO 2]. From this point of view, the reduction in photos ynthetic rates would be conditioned by a plant’s ability to develop new sin ks, or to expand the storage capacity or rate of existing sinks. According to Bloom et al. (2010), photosynthetic down might be conditioned by nitrate reductase activity and the inhibition of NO nt decline in plant N compounds. Furthermore, accor ding to those authors, the kind of nitrogen form applied to plants has a key role in r esponsiveness of plants to elevated [CO order to test the relevancy of N fertilization form in photosynthetic performance under elevated] conditions, Arabidopsis thaliana (Columbia 0), grown hydroponically were exposed to ambient versus elevated [CO 2] concentrations (380 and 800 ppm respectively). Tw o different N forms were supplied at 0. 75 mM, KNO 3 and NH 4 NO 3. The plants were grown in a growth chamber (Hereaus Vötsch HPS 1500) at 16 / 8 h (d/n) ph otoperiod, 22 / 18 ºC (d/n) thermoperiod, 80 % rH, 200 μmol photons m - 2 s - 1 PPDF, during 8 weeks (prior to flowering). <b>Our</b> <b>resu</b> lts revealed that Arabiopsis responsiveness to N fertili zation form was larger than that to elevated], being the plants fertilized with NH 4 NO 3 and [CO 2] the ones with the largest biomass production and photosynthetic rates. More specifica lly, in NO 3 fed plants exposure to 800 ppm had significant effect in net photosynthesis (A N) and electron transport rate (ETR), but Rubisco maximum carboxylation rate (Vc max) and electron transport rate contributing to RuBP regeneration (J max) had no significative effect. Furthermore, in thos e plants Rubisco and tot soluble protein (TSP) content was depleted by 35 an d 25 % respectively. In the other hand, A, J max such parameters were stimulated in NH 4 NO 3 fed plants. The larger responsiveness of photosynthetic apparatus observed in ammonium nitrate feed plants at 800 ppm was explained by their capacity to maintain con trol Rubisco and TSP content values. Those results remark the crucial influence of N sou rce on photosynthesis and its implications on protein metabolism of Arabidopsis plants grown in elevated CO 2.
