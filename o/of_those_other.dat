25|$|Compared {{to other}} {{important}} {{towns in the}} County of Holland, such as Dordrecht, Leiden, Haarlem, Delft and Alkmaar, Amsterdam is a relatively young city. In {{stark contrast to the}} relative decline <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>other</b> towns, Amsterdam's population grew in the 15th and 16th centuries, mainly due to the rise of the profitable Baltic maritime trade after the Burgundian victory in the Dutch–Hanseatic War.

Todd VanDerWerff [...] of The A.V. Club gave a B-, describing it as [...] "an entertaining hour that never rises to the level <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>other</b> episodes" [...] like [...] "Humbug" [...] and [...] "War of the Coprophages". VanDerWerff argued that [...] "Syzygy" [...] was an attempt by Carter to try and emulate the writing style of Darin Morgan's scripts, without success; he noted [...] "the laughs here are emptier than they were the week before in 'Coprophages'"—and adding that [...] "every time you think the episode has {{figured out a way}} to plant its foot firmly in comedic territory, there's a horribly judged moment of 'drama,' like Mulder's final monologue." [...] Connie Ogle of Popmatters listed Margi and Terri among the best monster-of-the-week characters of the series, describing [...] "Syzygy" [...] as a [...] "hilarious send-up of Heathers".|$|E

Tolmach, {{now president of}} Columbia Pictures and Amy Pascal, co-chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment, said they looked for a director who could give sharp focus to Parker's life. Webb said he [...] "was a little sceptical at first—you feel the presence <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>other</b> movies. But then I was like, 'How could I walk away from this? What an opportunity!'" [...] Webb said in the press release announcing him that, [...] "Sam Raimi's virtuoso rendering of Spider-Man is a humbling precedent to follow and build upon. The first three films are beloved for good reason. But I think the Spider-Man mythology transcends not only generations but directors as well. I am signing on not to 'take over' from Sam. That would be impossible. Not to mention arrogant. I'm here because there's an opportunity for ideas, stories, and histories that will add a new dimension, canvas, and creative voice to Spider-Man." [...] Webb felt Spider-Man {{is different from the}} Harry Potter franchise, which is based on a few novels and [...] "more like James Bond" [...] because [...] "there's so much material in Spider-Man {{that there are so many}} stories to tell and so many characters." [...] He described the film as [...] "not a remake" [...] explaining that [...] "we're not making Sam's movie again. It's a different universe and a different story with different characters." ...|$|E

2500|$|Modern shanties {{were used}} to {{accompany}} work at the patent windlass, {{which was designed to}} raise anchor and was operated by the see-saw like action of pumping hand brakes. The up and down motion of the brake levers lent the action a binary form that was well-suited by many of the same songs used as halyard shanties. And yet, the continuous nature of the task also meant grand choruses were possible. So while halyard shanties and capstan shanties tended to be exclusive of one another, windlass shanties sometimes shared repertoire with each <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>other</b> types.

However, new media may not have overwhelming effects on either <b>of</b> <b>those.</b> <b>Other</b> research is tending toward the idea that new media has reinforcing effect, that rather than completely altering, by increasing involvement, it [...] "imitates the established pattern of political participation" [...] (Nam, 2012). After analyzing the Citizenship Involvement Democracy survey, Nam (2012) found that [...] "the internet plays a dual role in mobilizing political participation by people not normally politically involved, as well as reinforcing existing offline participation." [...] These findings chart a middle ground between some research that optimistically holds new media up to be an extremely effective or extremely ineffective at fostering political participation.|$|E
2500|$|Dasein is a German {{word and}} is {{sometimes}} translated as [...] "being-there" [...] or [...] "being-here" [...] (da combines in its meaning [...] "here" [...] and [...] "there", excluding the spatial-relational distinction {{made by the}} English words; Sein is the infinitive, [...] "to be"). It is the German form of the existential expletive, which, as in most European languages, is expressed idiomatically. Heidegger, after Nietzsche, used the word, but as a gerund synonym for [...] "human being" [...] or [...] "human entity." [...] A Dasein is then a new coinage for a being that is there, in a familiar world, and in a mood. Dasein also has unique capacities for language, intersubjective communication, and detached reasoning. Heidegger {{does not want to}} get tied up with overused and ambiguous words such as [...] "person," [...] "consciousness," [...] "soul," [...] or [...] "spirit," [...] so Dasein is a new way of approaching something all <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>other</b> words point towards, but without the connotations. Dasein is the starting point of Heidegger's ontology. It is typically thought to apply to humans, but it could apply to any being that fulfills the definition's characteristics which he states. What makes a being a Dasein is as follows: Dasein is a being whose being is an issue for itself; every Dasein has an a priori sense of [...] "mineness," [...] or being one's self; Dasein is always thrown into the world, meaning it finds itself within a world, meaning no Dasein has ever been decontextualized. We are all world-bound, submerged, entangled, and engaged with our ontico-ontological surroundings through care, concern, and moods. Dasein has various modes of being-in-the-world, which are the subject of much of Heidegger's analysis in Being and Time. Furthermore, average humans have a pre-ontological (general intuitive sense of being) understanding of being insofar as they understand what things are and that they are e.g. [...] "My dog is brown" [...] or [...] "Today is Sunday." [...] Heidegger believed that this pre-reflective understanding of being, that which determines entities as entities, helps constitute our unique existence as human beings, thus the coinage of [...] "Dasein." ...|$|E
