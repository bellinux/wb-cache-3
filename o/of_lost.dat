5|$|A {{group of}} 17people, {{initially}} considered missing, rode {{out the storm}} on the offshore Mackerel Island. Onshore, officials closed a portion of Highway 1 {{as well as other}} roads in the area. Ahead of the storm, hundreds of residents in older structures and mobile homes, as well as an aborigine village near Onslow, were ordered to evacuate to safer locations. Five iron mines were closed during the storm's passage, forcing the 1,500workers to return home. The disruptions from the cyclone affected about 340,000tonnes <b>of</b> <b>lost</b> production. About 800,000barrels <b>of</b> <b>lost</b> oil production resulted from closed offshore platforms. Oil fields reopened by 14April.|$|E

5|$|All {{but two of}} {{the fifteen}} {{multiplayer}} maps are based on locations explored throughout the God of War series, with eight of those based on locations explored in Ascension; for example, Desert <b>of</b> <b>Lost</b> Souls is from the original God of War, Bog of the Forgotten is from God of War II, and Labyrinth of Daedalus, Forum of Hercules, and Chamber of the Flame are from God of War III. The two original maps are the Coliseum of Persia and the Walls of Troy (which features the Trojan Horse). Every map features special power-ups awarded by the gods for earning points, such as the Boots of Hermes for acceleration and running attacks. Maps also have environmental obstacles or objectives to complete for more points. For example, on the Desert <b>of</b> <b>Lost</b> Souls map, the cyclops Polyphemus may attack nearby players and killing him with the Spear of Olympus will grant bonus points for that team.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the {{characteristics}} of digestive organ cancer mortality and the potential years <b>of</b> life <b>lost</b> in Inner Mongolia, and to provide evidence for the prevention of digestive organ cancers. Methods: Using data from the Death Registry System from 2009 to 2012, we classified male and female cancer deaths according to the International Classification of Disease (10 th revision). The mortality and potential years <b>of</b> life <b>lost</b> were calculated for digestive organ cancers in Inner Mongolia. The average years <b>of</b> life <b>lost</b> was calculated. Results: Digestive organ cancer mortality in Inner Mongolia was higher in men than in women. The potential years <b>of</b> life <b>lost</b> were also much higher in men than in women. Gallbladder cancer, pancreatic cancer, and colorectal, anus, and anal canal cancer were the most prominent contributors to mortality. Esophageal cancer was the most prominent contributor to potential years <b>of</b> life <b>lost,</b> and was the leading cause of average years <b>of</b> life <b>lost</b> in both sexes. Conclusion: Liver cancer and stomach cancer mortality and the potential years <b>of</b> life <b>lost</b> to liver and stomach cancer are demonstrably higher in Inner Mongolia. Although esophageal cancer mortality was not the highest of the digestive organ cancers, the average years <b>of</b> life <b>lost</b> to esophageal was the highest for both sexes, and it should therefore be targeted for prevention...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to calculate average years <b>of</b> life <b>lost</b> due to breast and cervical cancer in Mexico in 2000 and 2010.

Data was disaggregated into five-year age groups and socioeconomic status based on the 2010 marginalization index obtained from the National Population Council. A decrease in average years <b>of</b> life <b>lost</b> due to cervical cancer (37. 4 %) and an increase in average years <b>of</b> life <b>lost</b> due breast cancer (8. 9 %) was observed during the period studied.

40|$|Temperature is an {{important}} determinant of health. A better knowledge of how temperature affects population health is important {{not only to the}} scientific community, but also to the decision-makers who develop and implement early warning systems and intervention strategies to mitigate the health effects of extreme temperatures. The temperature–health relationship is also of growing interest as climate change is projected to shift the overall temperature distribution higher. Previous studies have examined the relative risks of temperature-related mortality, but the absolute measure of years <b>of</b> life <b>lost</b> is also useful as it combines the number of deaths with life expectancy. Here we use years <b>of</b> life <b>lost</b> to provide a novel measure of the impact of temperature on mortality in Brisbane, Australia. We also project the future temperature-related years <b>of</b> life <b>lost</b> attributable to climate change. We show that the association between temperature and years <b>of</b> life <b>lost</b> is U-shaped, with increased years <b>of</b> life <b>lost</b> for cold and hot temperatures.

40|$|Background: Extreme {{temperatures}} {{are associated with}} cardiovascular disease (CVD) deaths. Previous studies have investigated the relative CVD mortality risk of temperature, but this risk is heavily influenced by deaths in frail elderly persons. To better estimate the burden of extreme temperatures we estimated their effects on years <b>of</b> life <b>lost</b> due to CVD. Methods and Results: The data were daily observations on weather and CVD mortality for Brisbane, Australia between 1996 and 2004. We estimated the association between daily mean temperature and years <b>of</b> life <b>lost</b> due to CVD, after adjusting for trend, season, day of the week, and humidity. To examine the non-linear and delayed effects of temperature, a distributed lag non-linear model was used. The model’s residuals were examined to investigate {{if there were any}} added effects due to cold spells and heat waves. The exposure-response curve between temperature and years <b>of</b> life <b>lost</b> was U-shaped, with the lowest years <b>of</b> life <b>lost</b> at 24 °C. The curve had a sharper rise at extremes of heat than of cold. The effect of cold peaked two days after exposure, whereas the greatest effect of heat occurred on the day of exposure. There were significantly added effects of heat waves on years <b>of</b> life <b>lost.</b> Conclusions: Increased years <b>of</b> life <b>lost</b> due to CVD are associated with both cold and hot temperatures. Research on specific interventions is needed to reduce temperature-related years <b>of</b> life <b>lost</b> from CVD deaths. ...|$|R
