5|$|Whereas Linnaeus {{classified}} {{for ease}} <b>of</b> <b>identification,</b> {{the idea of}} the Linnaean taxonomy as translating into a sort of dendrogram of the Animal- and Plant Kingdoms was formulated {{toward the end of the}} 18th century, well before On the Origin of Species was published. Among early works exploring the idea of a transmutation of species were Erasmus Darwin's 1796 Zoönomia and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck's Philosophie Zoologique of 1809. The idea was popularised in the Anglophone world by the speculative but widely read Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, published anonymously by Robert Chambers in 1844.|$|E
5|$|During the 18th century, {{systems of}} plant {{identification}} were developed comparable to dichotomous keys, where unidentified plants are placed into taxonomic groups (e.g. family, genus and species) {{by making a}} series of choices between pairs of characters. The choice and sequence of the characters may be artificial in keys designed purely for identification (diagnostic keys) or {{more closely related to}} the natural or phyletic order of the taxa in synoptic keys. By the 18th century, new plants for study were arriving in Europe in increasing numbers from newly discovered countries and the European colonies worldwide. In 1753 Carl von Linné (Carl Linnaeus) published his Species Plantarum, a hierarchical classification of plant species that remains the reference point for modern botanical nomenclature. This established a standardised binomial or two-part naming scheme where the first name represented the genus and the second identified the species within the genus. For the purposes <b>of</b> <b>identification,</b> Linnaeus's Systema Sexuale classified plants into 24 groups according to the number of their male sexual organs. The 24th group, Cryptogamia, included all plants with concealed reproductive parts, mosses, liverworts, ferns, algae and fungi.|$|E

5|$|Mainstream opinion {{reflects}} the function <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> with a sports team in {{both individual and}} group psychology. There are many benefits associated with sports fandom, both private (increased self-esteem) and public (community solidarity). The activity of viewing sporting events provide shared experiences that reinforce personal and group identification with a team. The name, mascot, cheerleaders, and marching band performances reinforce and become associated with these shared experiences. Daniel Snyder explicitly invokes these associations with family, friends, and an 81-year tradition as being the most important reasons for keeping the Redskins name. When self-esteem becomes bound to {{the players and the}} team, there are many beneficial but also some unfortunate consequences, including denial or rationalization of misbehavior. However, for some, the identity being expressed is one of supremacy, with the defense of native mascots clearly racist.|$|E
5|$|The passive visual {{warnings}} {{are usually}} {{part of the}} design of the vehicle, and involve the use of high contrast patterns. Older ambulances (and those in developing countries) {{are more likely to have}} their pattern painted on, whereas modern ambulances generally carry retro-reflective designs, which reflects light from car headlights or torches. Popular patterns include 'checker board' (alternate coloured squares, sometimes called 'Battenburg', named after a type of cake), chevrons (arrowheads – often pointed towards the front of the vehicle if on the side, or pointing vertically upwards on the rear) or stripes along the side (these were the first type of retro-reflective device introduced, as the original reflective material, invented by 3M, only came in tape form). In addition to retro-reflective markings, some services now have the vehicles painted in a bright (sometimes fluorescent) yellow or orange for maximum visual impact. Fire Department-operated Ambulances are often painted similarly to their apparatuses for ease <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> and the fact that bright red is a very striking color appropriate for this type of vehicle.|$|E
5|$|The {{psilocybin}} {{contents of}} dried herbarium specimens of Psilocybe semilanceata {{in one study}} were shown to decrease with the increasing age of the sample: collections dated 11, 33, or 118 years old contained 0.84%, 0.67%, and 0.014% (all dry weight), respectively. Mature mycelia contain some psilocybin, while young mycelia (recently germinated from spores) lack appreciable amounts. Many species of mushrooms containing psilocybin also contain lesser amounts of the analog compounds baeocystin and norbaeocystin, chemicals thought to be biogenic precursors. Although most species of psilocybin-containing mushrooms bruise blue when handled or damaged due to the oxidization of phenolic compounds, this reaction is not a definitive method <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> or determining a mushroom's potency.|$|E

5|$|The {{adoption}} of Middle Scots by the aristocracy {{has been seen}} as building a shared sense of national solidarity and culture between rulers and ruled, although the fact that north of the Tay Gaelic still dominated may have helped widen the cultural divide between highlands and lowlands. The national literature of Scotland created in the late medieval period employed legend and history {{in the service of the}} crown and nationalism, helping to foster a sense of national identity, at least within its elite audience. The epic poetic history of the Brus and Wallace helped outline a narrative of united struggle against the English enemy. Arthurian literature differed from conventional versions of the legend by treating Arthur as a villain and Mordred, the son of the king of the Picts, as a hero. The origin myth of the Scots, systematised by John of Fordun (c. 1320-c. 1384), traced their beginnings from the Greek prince Gathelus and his Egyptian wife Scota, allowing them to argue superiority over the English, who claimed their descent from the Trojans, who had been defeated by the Greeks. The image of St. Andrew, martyred while bound to an X-shaped cross, first appeared in the Scotland during the reign of William I and was again depicted on seals used during the late thirteenth century; including on one particular example used by the Guardians of Scotland, dated 1286.

30|$|The {{basic idea}} of the {{coverage}} adjustment scheme is to compare the number of estimated positions with the number <b>of</b> registered <b>identifications</b> within the coverage <b>of</b> an <b>identification</b> sensor. If the approximated radius <b>of</b> an <b>identification</b> sensor is accurate enough, {{the number of the}} estimated positions is mostly equivalent to the number <b>of</b> the registered <b>identifications.</b> Otherwise, it means that the approximated coverage differs from the actual coverage. The radius <b>of</b> an <b>identification</b> sensor is adjusted by checking the difference between them. In some cases, the system needs to check the farthest or closet estimated position from the center <b>of</b> an <b>identification</b> sensor. For example, when the number of the estimated positions is equivalent to the number <b>of</b> the registered <b>identifications,</b> the coverage <b>of</b> an <b>identification</b> should be adjust to the farthest estimated position. Then, the problem in the coverage adjustment scheme is to determine how degree the radius is adjusted by at each sampling time. Since the coverage <b>of</b> an <b>identification</b> sensor can vary temporally, the large change of the radius may cause a reverse effect and the association performance may degenerate. Thus, we use the average speed of tracked objects measured by the association system as the degree of the radius adjustment to be unsusceptible to the object dynamics.|$|R
