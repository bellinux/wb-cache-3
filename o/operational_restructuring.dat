The time-sequential Monte Carlo simulation is used to model the chronological characteristics of corresponding reliability network equivalents. A contingency management schema for real time operation considering its coupling with the day-ahead market is proposed. A simplified method is developed in the simulation procedures for improving the computational efficiency. The proposed technique can be used to evaluate customers’ reliabilities considering high penetration of wind power during the power system operation in the deregulated environment.|$|R

30|$|In {{the last}} four decades, {{reliability}} evaluation techniques and reliability management strategies have been well developed and studied. These reliability evaluation techniques are more focused on planning and expansion of conventional power systems. However, the fast development and widely utilization of intermittent and fluctuating wind power generation have brought complexities for securing system balancing and maintaining system and customers’ reliabilities during the operational phase. Moreover, {{in the last two}} decades, power systems have been restructured: electric energy and reserve are traded in different correlated markets. The restructuring of power systems has changed reliability management strategies fundamentally. Some existing and widely used criteria e.g., N- 1 criterion {{may or may not be}} suitable for securing the reliable operation of power systems. In this paper, a new technique for assessing <b>operational</b> reliabilities of <b>restructured</b> power systems with high wind power penetration has been developed, which is based on reliability network equivalents and time-sequential simulation approaches. For reducing computational complexities, a simplified method has been developed and utilized in the simulation procedure.

30|$|In {{the last}} two decades, the wind power {{generation}} has been rapidly and widely developed in many regions and countries for tackling the problems of environmental pollution and sustainability of energy supply. However, the high share of intermittent and fluctuating wind power production has also increased the burden of system operator for securing power system reliability during the operational phase. Moreover, the power system restructuring and deregulation have not only introduced the competition for reducing cost but also changed the strategy of reliability evaluation and management of power systems. The conventional long-term reliability evaluation techniques have been well developed, which have been more focused on planning and expansion rather than operation of power systems.

Premised on an interpretive research paradigm, primary data were collected using semi-structured interviews of four senior managers of RioZim Limited and questionnaires distributed amongst the companyâ€™s middle level managers. Furthermore, secondary data were collected extensively from relevant company documents in companyâ€™s archives and public domain. The research found that RioZimâ€™s viability problems stemmed from internal problems which were exacerbated by macroeconomic environment that prevailed Zimbabwe. The main internal factors were poor financial management, operational inefficiencies at Empress Nickel Refinery and Renco Mine, lack of strategic direction and weak corporate governance across the RioZim group. External {{factors such as the}} unavailability of flexible and cheap sources of capital, non-remission of foreign currency earnings from gold deposits by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe; challenges in supply of key inputs such as matte, electricity, oxygen and water and increasing costs of key inputs such as electricity also contributed to the companyâ€™s decline.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to analyse the ways in which different councils in NSW local government have attempted to improve their strategic and <b>operational</b> capabilities, including <b>restructuring</b> of their organisations in order to facilitate the development of innovative operational methods aimed at more economical and coherent infrastructure management. No unanimity exists in how to reform local government in order to ensure the achievement of these objectives. The legislative frameworks as it exists in NSW has placed greater emphasis on the nature of individual council management itself as a critical aspect of local government reform and attribute substantial weight to the capacity of management at the individual council level to adapt and adjust to changing external expectations. The non-prescriptive approach adopted by NSW state government in this regard has resulted in councils adopting a larger variety of reform routes because of the greater flexibility to experiment with different models. What has been the strategy behind such models? What are the principal factors inspiring different change approaches? What degree of success has been achieved in different cases? Can performance improvement be achieved without radical change or restructuring? If so under what conditions? Taking inspiration from this research theme, this study of reform methodologies attempts to address the following research problem: “Through what processes have local councils in NSW Australia attempted to manage the transition from traditionally bureaucratic organisations to organisations that efficiently and effectively meet the need of their customers, provide democratic governance and supply competitive and value for money services to their respective communities?” This study is based on a multiple case study design in which each council is selected in consideration of its dedicated pursuit of a focussed and identified reform route and on the grounds of that council’s ability to adequately represent the phenomenon being investigated. The suitability for selection as a case study council is also based on the features like balance and variety it may bring with the opportunity to learn of primary importance. The data is collected through the triangulated approaches of personal observation, interviews and document analysis. The process of collection, analysis and coding continues till saturation is reached and the information so obtained is categorised under the headings “content”, “context” and the “process” of the reform path at each case study council in their respective chapters. This is followed by a paragraph on ‘discussion’ which is a narration, largely within case analysis based on seven principal elements pertaining to the reform process considered and analysed in this study. Further discussion of the seven principal elements in the context of local government reforms, along with a cross case analysis, is done in the last two chapters. The answers to the research problem emerging from this analysis suggest that: 1. An accurate analysis of the prevailing situation at a council and a correct estimation of the gap between the existing and target situations within a specified time frame has played a major role in deciding the approach to be followed at that council. This includes the type of organisational model and the reform path. In addition the General Manager’s personal characteristics especially the ability to walk the talk (resembling a missionary torch bearer) along with his/her senior team also plays a pivotal role in choosing the nature of the reform path and the type of organisational structure. Skilful implementation of this strategy has made the General Manager feel confident about being able to apply the necessary controls when required and be able to fine tune the proceedings as and when required. 2. Combination of factors like convergence of the General Manager’s own career objectives with a council’s organisational objectives and possession of a right mix of personal characteristics and leadership abilities will pretty much furnish the embryo of the change approach to be pursued. Once this has been identified and achieved, it is then up to the elected council, the General Manager and his senior management team to get together and give final shape to the change approach. 3. Viewed from this combined perspective of historical functional expectations and also the new challenges, it can be said that case study councils: 1 and 4 (CSC 1 and 4) could achieve their targets of the reform process meritoriously. While the experience at CSC: 4 tells us about the visionary intellect and the competent manner of the application of a large scale frame breaking approach; CSC: 1 is a case of strong, smooth, streamline, simple yet professionally competent pursuance of the reform path. The ripples of the unsettling impact of the manner in which the reforms were applied at CSC: 3, took time to heal; CSC: 2 in much the similar fashion could reach its goals albeit at the second attempt. The excellent planning for the reforms and visions of the General Manager could only see the dilution of the targeted goals due to the difference in the capability, consistency and the type of leadership available to the different divisions at Council: 5. 4. No particular organisational model emerges as a necessary prescription for the desired degree of success.
