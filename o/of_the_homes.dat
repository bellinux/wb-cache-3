5|$|As {{it moved}} ashore, Iris damaged houses and schools {{in dozens of}} villages. In 35villages, the storm {{destroyed}} more than 95% of the buildings. Its small size confined the worst damage largely to Toledo and Stann Creek districts, which are the two southernmost and poorest districts of the country. The percentage of damaged houses was 72% in Toledo district and about 50% in Stann Creek, leaving about 15,000people homeless. In both districts, the storm caused power outages and contaminated water supplies. In the worst-affected areas, poor Mayan people living on farms lost {{much of what they}} owned. At Placencia near the coast, about 80% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>homes</b> were destroyed and many of the remaining buildings had roof damage, with downed power poles in the streets. About 90% of the houses in nearby Seine Bight were destroyed, and where Iris made landfall, over 90% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>homes</b> were destroyed throughout Monkey River Town. The storm damaged several roads and fishing piers in southern Belize. Iris also damaged tourism facilities, including minor impact to the Maya ruins of Belize, and damaged 20% of the hotel rooms in the country, accounting for $37million in losses. The remainder of the country remained generally unaffected during the storm.|$|E
5|$|At {{the request}} of the U.S. Justice Department, {{authorities}} conducted a June 4 raid and confiscated items from two homes in the Netherlands. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>homes</b> belonged to reporter Jaap Amesz, who had previously interviewed Van der Sloot and claimed knowledge of criminal activities by Van der Sloot. Aruban investigators used information gathered from the extortion case to launch a new search at a beach, but no new evidence was found. Dave Holloway returned to Aruba on June 14 to pursue possible new clues.|$|E
5|$|Damage was {{greatest}} {{in the southwest}} portion of the island, especially in the capital city, Roseau, which resembled an air raid target after the storm's passage. Strong winds from Hurricane David destroyed or damaged 80 percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>homes</b> (mostly wood)on the island, leaving 75 {{percent of the population}} homeless, with many others temporarily homeless in the immediate aftermath. In addition, the rainfall turned rivers into torrents, sweeping away everything in their path to the sea. Power lines were completely ripped out, causing the water system to stop as well.|$|E

5|$|Founded in 1844, Willamette University's {{library was}} started {{two years after}} the {{establishment}} of the school. The library grew to a size of 2,500 volumes in 1874. University Hall (now Waller Hall), which was built in 1867, was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>homes</b> of the library in the early years. The library was located {{on the third floor of}} the building. The early name for the institution was the Willamette University Library, which by 1901 was a free, general library with both circulating and reference collections. That year the library collection had grown to 4,686 volumes, along with a total of 2,753 pamphlets.|$|E
5|$|In Antigua and Barbuda, {{there was}} {{considerable}} flooding of major roads and 2,000people were severely affected and were evacuated. About 516 of the people were housed in emergency shelters. Across the island, the storm killed one person, injured 12, left an elderly blind man missing, and destroyed 500houses and a newly built church. In the village of Crab's Hill, 64of the 81houses were ether seriously damaged or destroyed. The hurricane also disrupted 50% of telephone service and 90% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>homes</b> were left without electricity. A wind gust of 102mph (164km/h) was reported by the Antigua and Barbuda Meteorological Service on October20.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the mobile}} homes {{were able to}} be remounted on their foundations, but 18–20 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>homes</b> were unable to be repaired. The overall damage from the event was {{compared}} with the other events in southern California. While the Oceanside shock caused $200,000 in damage, the Palm Springs event caused an estimated $8 million in damage. Damage in from the Chalfant Valley event was estimated at $2.7 million.|$|E

5|$|Prizes {{were awarded}} {{for the best}} structures, the best art posters, and the best cutout books made by {{students}} about Tiny Town. The prizes were available only to vocational-training students and students otherwise involved in the project. Student officials were in charge during the awards at the Springfield convention center. The carpentry of the framing and exterior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>homes</b> was done primarily by the boys. The supervisor of the art department of the participating schools had an interior home-decoration contest to involve the girls, who made draperies, furniture, and floor coverings and beautified the homes' interiors.|$|E
5|$|Starting as {{a fishing}} outpost for European fishermen, St. John's {{consisted}} mostly <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>homes</b> of fishermen, sheds, storage shacks, and wharves constructed out of wood. Like many other {{cities of the}} time, as the Industrial Revolution took hold and new methods and materials for construction were introduced, the landscape changed as the city grew. The Great Fire of 1892 destroyed most of the downtown core, and most residential and other wood-frame buildings date from this period.|$|E
5|$|A quarter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>homes</b> in Cihuatlán, Jalisco, {{were totally}} destroyed, leaving many homeless. In Manzanillo, Colima, 40 {{percent of all}} homes were destroyed, and four ships in the harbor were sunk. Large {{portions}} of Colima and Jalisco were isolated by flooding. Hundreds of people were stranded. Minatitlán, Colima, suffered especially, as 800people out of its population of 1000 were dead or missing, according to a message sent to President Adolfo López Mateos. In Colima, all coconut plantations were blown down {{and thousands of people}} were left out of work. That state's economy was damaged enough that officials thought it would take years to recover.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Peter Wentz <b>Home</b> is {{a two-story}} salt-box {{residence}} {{built on a}} foundation <b>of</b> cobblestone. <b>The</b> exterior cornice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>home</b> boasts crown molding trim, however <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> outward appearance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>home</b> is quite plain.

5|$|Destruction was {{heaviest}} in Belize and totaled $250million (2001USD). Because Iris was compact, {{the damage}} was largely confined to 72% of the houses in the Toledo district and 50% of the houses in the Stann Creek district. The hurricane damaged or destroyed 3,718homes nationwide, and wrecked more than 95% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>homes</b> in 35villages in the poorest parts of the country. Iris left about 15,000people homeless, many receiving assistance {{from the government and}} the local Red Cross chapter. High winds also damaged large swaths of forest and crops, mostly affecting the banana industry. Iris killed 24people in Belize, including 20 who died when a scuba diving boat capsized near Big Creek. The storm also killed eight people and damaged about 2,500homes in neighboring Guatemala, and later dropped heavy rainfall in southern Mexico, where two people died.|$|E

She was principal of Cheltenham Ladies' College from 1907 until 1922. In 1920, she became Justice of the Peace for Cheltenham, {{becoming one of the}} first women magistrates in England. Faithfull started the organisation that is now Lilian Faithfull Homes in Cheltenham, and she spent the last few months of her life in the care of one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>homes,</b> Faithfull House, until her death in 1952.|$|E
5|$|Georgia State Route 279 {{was also}} flooded over {{with more than}} one foot (300mm) of water. The Lamar County Emergency Management Director {{reported}} that several dirt roads in the county were flooded and some were washed out. De Kalb County had many of its streams and creeks surpass flood stage, causing minor damage to businesses and homes. Spalding County also reported 15roads with extensive flooding damage. Fourteen mobile homes in Clayton County were damaged beyond repair by the flooding; 52residents were evacuated. In Riverdale, several homes were flooded, although damage was generally limited to the basements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>homes.</b> In Fayette County, the historic Starrs Mill was inundated, and water rose to the bridge level on McDonough Road. There was also a dam breach on Lake Fowler, causing $300,000dollars (2005USD) in damage.|$|E

5|$|In Bishop, {{intensity}} VI effects included {{broken windows}} and cracked walls in commercial and government buildings. Items fell from store shelves at grocery markets, streets were cracked, and wells had {{changes in the}} flow of water. The damage to the mobile homes in Chalfant was also consistent with intensity VI shaking, with some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>homes</b> moving laterally as much as 18 inches. Also in this classification was damage to pipe supports along a portion of the Los Angeles Aqueduct between the Upper, Middle, and Control Gorge Power Plants southeast of Crowley Lake. Intensity V (Moderate) effects (including cracked windows and broken underground pipes) were present in the Central Valley, Death Valley, and Carson City, Nevada.|$|E
5|$|In Jamaica, {{flooding}} {{was reported}} on {{the east of the}} island, and mudslides occurred on the northeast coast. In Kingston, buildings collapsed and houses had their roofing torn off by the strong winds, which felled trees and lampposts. A shoot-out between police and looters occurred in the parish of Clarendon. Over 1,500 roofs were lost, primarily to the hurricane-force winds. 3,127houses were heavily damaged, 1,582 of which were left totally uninhabitable. Two-thirds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>homes</b> in the southeastern parishes of Clarendon, St. Catherine, and Kingston/St. Andrew sustained significant damages. One man was killed in Clarendon by a collapsing roof, and a 14-year-old girl in Whitehorses, St. Thomas was killed by rock damage to her home. A third Jamaican was killed when he was struck by flying debris {{during the height of the}} storm.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} {{boom of the}} 1970s and early 1980s {{that took place in}} Texas (because of the escalation in oil prices) benefited the Bay Area communities significantly. Industrial operations were expanded including the opening of the U.S. Steel plant in Baytown in 1970, and the Barbours Cut shipping terminal at Morgan's Point in 1977. The Port of Texas City became the third leading port in Texas by tonnage and ninth in the nation. The Barbours Cut terminal, operated by the Port of Houston, became the seventh leading port in the nation. Not all of this development was without controversy, however. In building Barbours Cut, the Port of Houston used its power of eminent domain to evict residents from nearly one third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>homes</b> in Morgan's Point. Still, when the Texas economy declined in the later 1980s, the economic diversity of the area and substantial annual federal investments related to JSC helped the region fare better than most of Greater Houston.|$|E

5|$|The {{strong winds}} from Paka left around 1,500buildings {{destroyed}} {{on the island}}, of which 1,160 were single-family homes. A further 10,000buildings sustained damage to some degree, with 60% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>homes</b> on the island reporting major damage. In all, about 5,000people were left homeless due to the typhoon. Additionally, an estimated 30–40% of the public buildings received major damage. Buildings on the island made of reinforced concrete fared well, as opposed to light metal-frame structures, which {{more often than not}} were destroyed. Large tourist hotels near Hagåtña, on which Guam is dependent, received generally minor damage, such as broken windows and damaged power generators.|$|E
5|$|According to St Petersburg {{psychiatrist}} Vladimir Pshizov, {{a disastrous}} factor for domestic psychiatry {{is that those}} who had committed the crime against humanity were allowed to stay on their positions until they can leave this world in a natural way. Those who retained their positions and influence turned domestic psychiatry from politically motivated one to criminally motivated one because the sphere of interests of this public {{has been reduced to}} making a business of psychopharmacologic drugs and taking possession <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>homes</b> of the ill. In Soviet times, all the heads of departments of psychiatry, all the directors of psychiatric research institutes, all the head doctors of psychiatric hospitals were the CPSU nomenklatura, which they remained so far. The representative of nomenklatura in psychiatry had the scheme of career that is simple and often stereotyped: for one to two years, he run errands as a resident, then joined the party and became a partgrouporg. His junior colleagues (usually non-partisan ones) collected and processed material for his dissertation. Its review of literature, particularly in a research institute for psychiatry, was often written by patients, because only they knew foreign languages, and their party comrades were not up to it, the natural habitat did not stimulate learning a foreign language.|$|E
5|$|During the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) tour of South Africa during 1948–49, {{the first}} under apartheid, the BBC {{commentator}} John Arlott was horrified {{when he saw}} a black man assaulted for no reason. This prompted him to visit several townships where he found black people living in very poor conditions. He contrasted this unfavourably with the luxury <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>homes</b> where he was entertained by white families. Billy Griffith, one of the touring team, accompanied him on one visit to a township, and was similarly appalled, but did not speak out against it. Arlott later condemned apartheid, during a 1950 BBC broadcast, and refused to commentate during future tours to the country. His example was followed by the England batsman and clergyman David Sheppard, who declined to tour South Africa, refused to play the team in 1960, and spoke out publicly against the policies of the South African government despite efforts by the MCC to silence him. Otherwise, there was little protest in England against South African cricket during the 1950s.|$|E
