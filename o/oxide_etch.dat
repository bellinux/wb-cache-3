Its primary use is in etching thin films of silicon dioxide (SiO2) or silicon nitride (Si3N4). It {{is a mixture of}} a buffering agent, such as ammonium fluoride (NH4F), and hydrofluoric acid (HF). Concentrated HF (typically 49% HF in water) etches silicon dioxide too quickly for good process control and also peels photoresist used in lithographic patterning.

50|$|Oxidation and {{impurities}} in {{the metal}} films affect the diffusion reactions by reducing the diffusion rates. Therefore, clean deposition practices and bonding with oxide removal and re-oxidation prevention steps are applied. The oxide layer removal can be realized by various <b>oxide</b> <b>etch</b> chemistry methods. Dry etching processes, i.e. formic acid vapor cleaning, are preferred based on the minimization of the immersion in fluids and the resulting etching of the passivation or the adhesion layer. Using the CMP process, which is especially for Cu and Al required, creates a planarized surface with micro roughness around several nanometer and enables the achievement of void-free diffusion bonds. Further, a surface treatment for organic removal, e.g. UV-ozone exposure, is possible.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{a simple}} microcantilever release process using {{anisotropic}} wet etching is presented. The microcantilever release is {{conducted at the}} final stage of the fabrication of piezoresistive microcantilever sensor. Issues related to microcantilever release such as microscopic roughness and macroscopic roughness has been resolved using simple technique. By utilizing silicon oxide (SiO 2) as the etch stop for the wet etching process, issues related to microscopic roughness can be eliminated. On the other hand, proper etching procedure with constant stirring of the etchant solution of KOH anisotropic etching significantly reduces the notching effect contributed by the macroscopic roughness.

40|$|An electrostatically {{actuated}} silicon membrane {{was designed}} and fabricated utilizing a siliconon- insulator wafer. The SOI wafer contains three layers- a 400 μm thick “handle” layer of silicon followed by a 2 μm thick oxide layer topped with a 20 μm thick “device” layer of silicon. The embedded oxide layer acts as an etch-stop during silicon etching, leaving a thin membrane of consistent thickness on the device side. The device dimensions were chosen to provide acceptable membrane deflection predicted by calculations and Finite Element Analysis. A microfabrication process plan was designed to produce thin membranes appropriate for electrostatic actuation.
