The asymmetrization is achieved by convoluting the angular dispersions of both incident and scattered beams along the vertical axis. A general method for mapping vertical window functions to the horizontal direction is proposed, and the formulas of two types of horizontal window functions mapped from symmetric double vertical Bartlett (triangular) and Gaussian window functions are presented. Both formulas incorporate a single asymmetry parameter connected with the <b>open</b> <b>width</b> of the Soller slits along the vertical direction.

The influence of one discrete crack and multiple crackson energy loss analysis of cavern in hard rock media are carried out.

40|$|Before the {{underground}} {{structures such as}} tunnels are constructed, electrical prospecting is often applied, because of its sensitivity for the water included in the rock mass. However, the relationship between resistivity and the physical property of the rock mass has not quantitatively been clarified. Especially, in the jointed rock mass, {{it is important to}} grasp the influence of the joint on the resistivity. In this paper, two kinds of jointed rock mass model are used. One is the discontinuity model, which is made to change the <b>open</b> <b>width</b> of discontinuity by inserting various number of filter papers. The other is the porous model, in which micro opening cracks are generated inside the rock by heating with the electricity muffle furnace. Using these models, the characteristics of resistivity for the jointed rock mass are examined by comparing with the field data obtained by electrical prospecting. As the result, it is shown the possibility to evaluate the porosity of in-situ rock mass from the relationship between porosity and resistivity of the porous model...|$|R
30|$|In present {{concrete}} construction, {{elastic rubber}} strips in sealing and waterproofing joints of assembling segments have been commonly used. For underground concrete structures, standard design for sealing joints uses Ethylene-Propylene-Diene Monomer (EPDM) polymer rubber strips arranged circumferentially {{on the end}} faces of the segment (Ding et al. 2017). Putty-based composite rubber strips have great viscosity and elasticity, which can compensate {{to a certain degree}} for the adverse effect of the interface defects at joints. To evaluate the waterproofing ability at joints, special attention is directed to the sealant behavior of the EPDM sealing strips. A time-dependent constitutive model is proposed to assess the long-term waterproof ability of EPDM rubber used in segmental joints (Shi et al. 2015). At present, there are few requirements for rubber strips in the design specifications, and there is limited understanding of the relationship between applied forces and waterproofing performance. In addition, precast concrete structures incorporate a groove at the joint interface for the rubber strip positioning (Hu et al. 2009). The type of groove at the joint interface can limit rubber strip lateral deformation, which can increase pressure on the strip and improve waterproofing ability. The various types of grooves offer different degrees of constraint. Therefore, mechanical properties of rubber strips along with groove design at precast concrete structure joints are key elements in waterproof design. The joint <b>open</b> <b>width</b> is also regarded as a key performance indicator, since it is the weakest part of the shield segmental lining (Liao et al. 2008; Zhang et al. 2015). As the weakest and vulnerable point in the segmental lining, joints have been investigated in experiments (Ding et al. 2013; Liu et al. 2015; Kiani et al. 2016), numerical analyses (Ding et al. 2004; Teachavorasinskun and Chub-uppakarn 2010) and case studies (Jun 2011; Basnet and Panthi 2018). Testing apparatus was designed to accurately monitor water leakage pressure of segmental joints under various combinations of opening and offsets (Ding et al. 2017). Molins and Arnau (2011) presented an in situ load test and 3 D numerical simulation on a full-scale segmental lining for the Barcelona metro line. According to a case study in Shanghai, Huang et al. (2017) perceived that longitudinal joints of the metro tunnel have large <b>open</b> <b>widths</b> and lose waterproofing when disrupted by unexpected surcharges.|$|R

The MAL-FSPM combines characteristics of flux-switching permanent-magnet motor and linear motor and can realize the direct driving and limited angular movement. Structure and operation principle of the MAL-FSPM are analyzed. Cogging torque model of the MAL-FSPM is established. The characteristics of cogging torque and torque ripple are investigated for: (1) distance (dend) between left end of rotor and left end of stator is more than two rotor tooth pitch (τp); and (2) dend is less than two rotor tooth pitch. Cogging torque {{is an important component}} of torque ripple and the period ratio of the cogging torque to the back electromotive force (EMF) equals one for the MAL-FSPM before optimization.

40|$|The {{spectra of}} {{ytterbium}} {{have been investigated}} {{above and below the}} first ionization threshold using two different techniques, single photon excitation via synchrotron radiation and multi step resonance ionization spectroscopy. In the synchrotron radiation based experiments, the photoabsorption spectrum in the wavelength region 1200 - 2000 A was recorded in the first order of a 3 meter spectrograph equipped with a 6000 line/mm holographic grating. More than two hundred new levels of YbI are observed, which are interpreted as inner shell transitions 4 f 446 s 2 [...] + 4 f 13 (2 Fs 5 / 2, 7 / 2) nd, ng and doubly excited transitions, 4 f 446 s 2 [...] + 4 f 44 5 d (2 D 3 / 2. 5 / 2) np, nf and 4 f 446 s 2 [...] + 4 f 14 6 p(2 P 1 / 2 3 / 2) ns, nd series. All the observed levels lie above the first ionization threshold which are ordered into Rydberg series converging on to six limits. The interchannel interactions between the overlapped series have been parametrized using multichannel quantum defect theory (MQDT). The laser based stepwise excitation experiments on ytterbium are performed using narrow band <b>width</b> <b>dye</b> lasers pumped by a Nd: YAG laser. The thermionic diode which has a very high gain, high sensitivity and good linearity is used for the ion detection. Four different experiments are employed to investigate the high lying odd and even parity levels. First three experiments are performed to record the principal and inter-combination series. Three colour or three photon spectra are compared with the two color three photon spectra below the first ionization. Moreover, we confirmed the different intermediate levels resulting from the single photon and two photon excitations. It is observed that the relative intensities of levels varies in each experiment, revealing strong influence of perturbers. In the other experiment, we have observed the even parity autoionizing resonances in the range of 70700 - 72000 cm-I using three color four photon excitation technique. More than 40 new levels attributable to the inner shell excitation corresponding to the 4 f 446 s 2 nl Rydberg series are detected.
