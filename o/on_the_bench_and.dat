5|$|Chelsea fielded a full-strength team, which {{lined up}} in a 4–3–3 formation; an attacking three of Didier Drogba, Damien Duff and Arjen Robben. Asier Del Horno was named as left back, which meant William Gallas moved to central defence. Wright-Phillips began the match on the {{substitute}} bench. Arsenal's line up by contrast was relatively inexperienced in midfield – Gilberto Silva was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bench</b> <b>and</b> Mathieu Flamini partnered Cesc Fàbregas in the centre. Up front Dennis Bergkamp started alongside striker Thierry Henry. The team played in a 4–4–2 formation.|$|E
5|$|His {{political}} reputation {{rose with}} his professional plaudits. Hayes declined the Republican nomination for a judgeship in 1856.

The city council elected Hayes as city solicitor to fill the vacancy, and he won a full two-year term from the voters in April 1859 with a larger majority than other Republicans on the ticket.|$|E

5|$|Kahn was {{initially}} {{called for the}} German national team as a late back-up for the 1994 FIFA World Cup; however {{he made his first}} international appearance on 23 June 1995 in a 2–1 victory against Switzerland, two months after recovering from his cruciate ligament injury. Along with Oliver Reck, Kahn was a reserve keeper of the squad, which won the 1996 UEFA European Football Championship in England.

Two years after the 2000 UEFA European Football Championship, in which defending champions Germany made an embarrassing exit in the group stage, Kahn received the squad's captaincy, succeeding the striker Oliver Bierhoff.|$|E

25|$|A {{legislative}} act of 1788 {{provided that the}} court should be entirely separated from the other courts with five judges to be elected by joint vote of both houses of the General Assembly.

He took off his green vest, and the player he substituted put on a red vest. The player in the red vest could take no further part in the game. Teams were limited to a single substitution per game. Players were substituted for tactical reasons or to replace an injured player.|$|E
25|$|In 1817, Blackford was {{appointed}} Chief Justice of the Indiana Supreme Court by Governor Jonathan Jennings to replace Chief Justice John Johnson {{who had died}} after {{less than a year}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bench,</b> <b>and</b> before the court had issued its first decision. Jennings informed Blackford of his decision as the two walked arm-in-arm from Johnson’s grave following his funeral service. Blackford at first refused, saying he was too young and inexperienced. However, there were less than seventy lawyers in the entire state at that time, the majority of which belonged to other factions of the party, or had not lived in the state long enough to qualify for the job. Jennings and Blackford were the only two members of the government who came from New Jersey, increasing Jennings’ sentimental desire to see Blackford appointed. Despite Blackford’s refusal, Jennings appointed him to the court and he was easily confirmed by the state senate to his first seven-year term.|$|E

500|$|The scene between Mark and Leslie at the pit was {{mirrored}} {{in the second}} season finale [...] "Freddy Spaghetti", which aired in May 2010 and was Mark's final appearance as a regular cast member.

Schur said of the scene, [...] "It's great because Leslie and Mark, it was such a disastrous moment last time (at the pit) and he didn't really respect her, and a lot's happened in a year." [...] Goor said of using that setting, [...] "I liked the symmetry of having it play a critical, and opposite role in this finale.

500|$|... "Freddy Spaghetti" [...] was {{the final}} episode to include Paul Schneider in any {{capacity}} after his two seasons as regular cast member as Mark Brendanawicz. Schneider left the series, and though Schur claimed that both the producers and Schneider were interested in having him return for guest appearances in future episodes, Schneider stated {{that he was not}} interested in returning and had never been contacted about it. The final scene between Leslie and Mark in [...] "Freddy Spaghetti", in which the two sit together at Lot 48, mirrors their scenes together in the first season finale, [...] "Rock Show", in which the two shared a kiss while overlooking the lot while it was still a construction pit. Schur said of the scene, [...] "It's great because Leslie and Mark, it was such a disastrous moment last time (at the pit) and he didn't really respect her, and a lot's happened in a year."

500|$|Tolliver {{signed a}} three-year {{contract}} worth about $1 million with the Shreveport Pirates of the Canadian Football League [...] before the 1995 season began. Early in the season, Tolliver got to compete against former teammate David Archer in the San Antonio Texans' CFL debut. He finished the season having thrown for 3,767 yards, 16 touchdowns, and 15 interceptions. After the team folded following a 5–13 season, Tolliver was again without a team. In October 1996, Tolliver rejoined the Falcons as the third-string quarterback, this time sitting behind Bobby Hebert and Browning Nagle. He spent the 1996 season <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bench,</b> <b>and</b> did not take a snap in a game. He was re-signed by Atlanta in April and given a one-year contract worth $325,000.|$|E

500|$|In March 1969, Maryland {{athletic}} director Jim Kehoe called a meeting among 120 players, Ward, his assistants, and a three-man committee. Thirty-one players told Ward {{that they no}} longer wished to play on the team and accused him of using intimidation tactics that included verbal and physical abuse. Ward listened to the player's grievances, but did not respond at the time. Two days later, he resigned as head coach. Later that year, Sports Illustrated interviewed Ward, and he said:"I won't go into all the specifics, but it wasn't the good players who started it. It was the guys who couldn't fight their way out of a paper bag, guys who sat <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bench</b> <b>and</b> couldn't take it and a couple of pip-squeak cub newspaper guys who don't know what football's all about...He gets on the campus newspaper {{and all of a sudden}} he's got power he never thought of having." ...|$|E
500|$|McCall {{was picked}} for England and Scotland under-21 sides {{on the same}} day in 1984, and chose to join the England under-21 squad for their game against Turkey. However he was only picked as a {{substitute}} and the referee blew the final whistle, with McCall waiting to come on. He later told Scottish newspaper Glasgow Herald, [...] "I felt it was a mistake almost from the start. I was put <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bench</b> <b>and</b> they tried to bring me on with a minute to go. But I took my time re-tying my boots and generally warming up and luckily didn't get on, otherwise that would have been that." [...] Since he had not actually played for England, McCall was still eligible for Scotland. He eventually switched allegiances to the latter, for whom he qualified through his father. He made his Scotland debut at under-21 level in March 1988, ironically against England. McCall made one more appearance for Scotland under 21s, against France in 1990.|$|E
