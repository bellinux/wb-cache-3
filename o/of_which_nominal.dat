In real world, many data occurred in a fuzzy and uncertain form. The decision tree must {{able to deal with}} such fuzzy data. This paper presents a tree construction procedure to build a fuzzy decision tree from a collection of fuzzy data by integrating fuzzy set theory and entropy. It proposes a fuzzy decision tree induction method for fuzzy data of which numeric attributes can be represented by fuzzy number, interval value as well as crisp value, <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>nominal</b> attributes are represented by crisp nominal value, and of which class has confidence factor.

40|$|The {{ecosystem}} {{of wetlands}} has precious natural environment {{to be preserved}} in the world. In order to sustain valuable wetlands ecosystems for a long time, {{it is very important}} to frequently monitor the state of wetland ecosystems, to carefully watch the environment, and to earlier warn the environmental change. In this research, using high spatial resolution of color photographs taken with a 35 mm non-metric camera mounted on the cabled balloon flown over the high moor near Akanuma in Kushiro wetland, characteristics of spatial distribution of wetland plant communities are studied in terms of application and interpretation of remote sensing data for wetland environment monitoring using geostatistics, texture analysis, and landscape metrics. Outcomes of this research are summarized as follows. 1. An ultra fine and reliable vegetation map, <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>nominal</b> spatial resolution is 2 cm by 2 cm, with 40 plant community types at the time of the summer in 1998 was originally created, which is covering about 15 ha of the high moor, for the baseline map for ecological studies near Akanuma. 2. The optimal spatial resolution for monitoring vegetation in this area by remote sensing is smaller than a half meter. 3. Concentric spatial distribution of typical wetland plant community groups is clearly distinguished and confirmed in the ultra fine vegetation map through visual interpretation and spatial analysis using GIS application tools...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{elucidate}} Keynes’s Marshallian lineage. I argue that the result of bringing out the Marshallian antecedents of the General Theory highlights Keynes’s failure to achieve the theoretical project he was striving at, namely to demonstrate an involuntary unemployment result in the arising <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>nominal</b> wage rigidity would play no role. In the first part of the paper, I reexamine Marshall’s theory of value. This section’s main conclusion is that no theory of unemployment is to be found in Marshall’s writings. In the second part of the paper, I study the literature spanning from Marshall to Keynes, focusing on Beveridge, Hicks and Pigou, in order to see whether the lacuna present in Marshall’s writings happened to be filled. Documenting the emergence of the notion of frictional unemployment, I come to the conclusion that its arising went along with little theoretical elaboration. The third and last part of the paper is a critical reflection on the General Theory. I start by making the point that Keynes’s theory of effective demand ought to be viewed as an extension of Marshall’s analysis of firms’ short-period production decisions. This enables me to bring out the decisive role played by the wage rigidity assumption in Keynes’s reasoning. I claim that, except for this assumption, the differences between “effective demand à la Marshall” and “effective demand à la Keynes” are minor. I close my analysis of Keynes’s reasoning by showing that no real removal of the nominal rigidity assumption is to be found in Chapter 19 of the General Theory...|$|E

50|$|Cassius Dio {{referred}} {{to all of}} these conflicts as rebellions. Dzino argues that it is therefore unlikely that they involved any conquests. The relations of the Romans with locals in frontier areas involved alliance treaties and treaties with client states, both <b>of</b> <b>which</b> entailed <b>nominal</b> independence. The breaking of these treaties was considered as a rebellion and as something which had to be suppressed. Augustus in his propagandistic writing stated that under Tiberius’ command Rome extended her sphere to Pannonian peoples where the Roman army had never been before and that Augustus extended the boundaries of Illyricum to the banks of the River Danube. However, Suetonius implied that this extension to the banks of this river occurred only after the Batonian War (see below). It is likely that {{in the aftermath of the}} Pannonian war Roman military presence in southern Pannonia increased. Dzino argues that it is likely that the local communities acted as a compact anti-Roman block and that there may have been pro- and anti- Roman factions. Some may have surrendered peacefully and some of them may have been pro-Roman all along. The communities of the region relied on kinship relationships, rather than formal state institutions. This may have led to political competition. Being friendly to the Romans or challenging them could have involved manoeuvres by local elites to strengthen their power-base. Acquiescence or opposition to the Romans could involve often unpredictable contests over political positions locally.|$|R

A total of 41 series for large coastal sharks were examined: 8 series for the large coastal shark complex, 8 for sandbar shark, 7 for blacktip shark, 6 for dusky shark, 4 for the hammerhead shark genus, 4 for bull shark, 2 for tiger shark, 1 for scalloped hammerhead, and 1 for silky shark. Five of the series were subjected to the same Generalized Linear Model (GLM) standardization methodology to adjust for factors that affect relative abundance. The approach used to estimate relative abundance indices was a Generalized Linear Mixed Model that treats separately the proportion of sets with positive catches (i. e., where at least one shark was caught) assuming a binomial error distribution with a logit link function, and the catch rates of sets with positive catches assuming a Poisson error distribution with a log link function.

In up to 8, 110 participants, we performed meta-analyses of GWA and IBC array data for estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), CKD (eGFR 30 mg/g) and interrogated the 250 kb flanking region around 24 SNPs previously identified in European Ancestry renal GWAS analyses. Findings were replicated in up to 4, 358 African Americans. To assess function, individually identified genes were knocked down in zebrafish embryos by morpholino antisense oligonucleotides. Expression of kidney-specific genes was assessed by in situ hybridization, and glomerular filtration was evaluated by dextran clearance. Overall, 23 of 24 previously identified SNPs had direction-consistent associations with eGFR in African Americans, 2 <b>of</b> <b>which</b> achieved <b>nominal</b> significance (UMOD, PIP 5 K 1 B).

In the appropriate context – e. g. a car race in the desert, when Michael’s car is running out of gas – sentence (i) means that Michael is far from all gas stations. By contrast, sentence (ii) only has an existential interpretation, which states that {{there is at least one}} gas station near Michael.
