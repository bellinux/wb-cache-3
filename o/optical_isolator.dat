These time-dependent sinusoidal-shaped structures are engineered to have in-phase mode conversion only in one direction, thus leading to asymmetric optical mode conversion in the silicon waveguide and one-way light transmission with high contrast ratios, confirmed by numerically simulated field maps and calculated transmission at the wavelength of 1550 nm.

50|$|In electronics, an opto-isolator, {{also called}} an optocoupler, photocoupler, or <b>optical</b> <b>isolator,</b> is a {{component}} that transfers electrical signals between two isolated circuits by using light. Opto-isolators prevent high voltages from affecting the system receiving the signal. Commercially available opto-isolators withstand input-to-output voltages up to 10 kV and voltage transients with {{speeds up to}} 10 kV/μs.|$|E
50|$|An optical {{circulator}} {{operates in}} a similar way to an <b>optical</b> <b>isolator,</b> except that the reverse propagating lightwave is directed to a third port for output, instead of being lost. An optical circulator can be used for bidirectional transmission, as a type of branching component that distributes (and isolates) optical power among fibers, based on the direction of the lightwave propagation.|$|E
50|$|In {{response}} to a magnetic field, some materials can have a dielectric tensor that is complex-Hermitian; {{this is called a}} gyro-magnetic or magneto-optic effect. In this case, the principal axes are complex-valued vectors, corresponding to elliptically polarized light, and time-reversal symmetry can be broken. This can be used to design <b>optical</b> <b>isolators,</b> for example.|$|R
50|$|In general, {{magneto-optic}} effects {{break time}} reversal symmetry locally (i.e. when only {{the propagation of}} light, and not {{the source of the}} magnetic field, is considered) as well as Lorentz reciprocity, which is a necessary condition to construct devices such as <b>optical</b> <b>isolators</b> (through which light passes in one direction but not the other).|$|R

50|$|An <b>optical</b> <b>isolator</b> is a two-port passive {{component}} that allows light (in a given wavelength range) {{to pass through}} with low attenuation in one direction, while isolating (providing a high attenuation for) light propagating in the reverse direction.

50|$|Many {{building}} codes require {{the presence of}} speakers in a secure room for emergency announcements. Although speakers are intended for creating sound, the speaker cone also responds to external sound and the coil generates a minute voltage characteristic of that sound. With proper sensing, that voltage {{can be converted to}} speech. Although it is possible to place a speaker masker next to the paging speaker the recommended solution is an <b>optical</b> <b>isolator.</b> It is essentially an audio diode; sound only goes one way.|$|E
50|$|A Faraday rotator {{consists}} of an optical material in a magnetic field. One polarization of the input light is in ferromagnetic resonance with the material which causes its phase velocity {{to be higher than}} that of the orthogonal polarization. This causes the polarization of light to rotate as it propagates through the material. Light propagating in the opposite direction rotates in the opposite direction relative to the light's direction of travel: the rotation of polarization is not reversed by going back through the rotator. This {{can be used to make}} an <b>optical</b> <b>isolator.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Verdet {{constant}} {{for most}} materials is extremely small and is wavelength dependent. It is strongest in substances containing paramagnetic ions such as terbium. The highest Verdet constants in bulk media {{are found in}} terbium doped dense flint glasses or in crystals of terbium gallium garnet (TGG). These materials have excellent transparency properties and high damage thresholds for laser radiation. Atomic vapours, however, can have Verdet constants which are orders of magnitude larger than TGG, but only over a very narrow wavelength range. Alkali vapours can therefore {{be used as an}} <b>optical</b> <b>isolator</b> (in essence, a diode for light), as demonstrated in Durham University's Atomic and Molecular Physics research group.|$|E

50|$|Faraday {{rotation}} is {{an example}} of non-reciprocal optical propagation. Unlike what happens in an optically active medium such as a sugar solution, reflecting a polarized beam back through the same Faraday medium does not undo the polarization change the beam underwent in its forward pass through the medium. This allows Faraday rotators to be used to construct devices such as <b>optical</b> <b>isolators</b> to prevent undesired back propagation of light from disrupting or damaging an optical system.|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} we present {{measurements}} of the switching of the Faraday effect in metal-organic compounds. Faraday rotation is {{the rotation of the}} plane of polarization of linearly polarized light under the influence of a magnetic field in the direction of propagation of the light. It is the magnetic equivalent of circular birefringence and is related to magnetic circular dichroism via the Kramers-Kronig transformation. The Faraday effect is used in <b>optical</b> <b>isolators</b> and magnetic sensors. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|It is {{therefore}} natural that even {{small amounts of}} back-reflections are amplified inside the SLED chip in a similar manner, producing optical power levels of several tens of milliwatts at the back facet, which may destroy the SLED device. SLEDs should be carefully protected against external optical feedback. Even small levels of feedback can reduce the overall emission bandwidth and the output power, or sometimes even lead to parasitic lasing, causing narrow spikes in the emission spectrum. Some devices may even be damaged by optical feedback. Note that the Fresnel reflection from a perpendicularly cleaved fiber end is already well above the level of feedback which can be tolerated. If back reflections cannot be avoided, an <b>optical</b> <b>isolator</b> must be installed directly behind the SLED module. The isolator provides a low insertion loss from the SLED to the fiber and a high insertion loss in the back direction. However, SLEDs from certain component manufacturers are on the market featuring intrinsically safe designs with high robustness against optical back reflections.|$|E
50|$|In {{fiber optics}} and telecommunications, an index-matching {{material}} {{may be used}} in conjunction with pairs of mated connectors or with mechanical splices to reduce signal reflected in the guided mode (known as return loss) (see: Optical fiber connector). Without the use of an index-matching material, Fresnel reflections will occur at the smooth end faces of a fiber unless there is no fiber-air interface or other significant mismatch in refractive index. These reflections may be as high as -14 dB (i.e., 14 dB below the optical power of the incident signal). When the reflected signal returns to the transmitting end, it may be reflected again and return to the receiving end at a level that is (28 plus twice the fiber loss) dB below the direct signal. The reflected signal will also be delayed by twice the delay time introduced by the fiber. The twice-reflected, delayed signal superimposed on the direct signal may noticeably degrade an analog baseband intensity-modulated video signal. Conversely, for digital transmission, the reflected signal will often have no practical effect on the detected signal seen at the decision point of the digital optical receiver except in marginal cases where bit-error ratio is significant. However, certain digital transmitters such as those employing a Distributed Feedback Laser may be affected by back reflection and then fall outside specifications such as Side Mode Suppression Ratio, potentially degrading system bit error ratio, so networking standards intended for DFB lasers may specify a back-reflection tolerance such as -10 dB for transmitters so that they remain within specification even without index matching. This back-reflection tolerance might be achieved using an <b>optical</b> <b>isolator</b> or by way of reduced coupling efficiency.|$|E
5000|$|On November 29, 1963 Dr. Biard, Gary Pittman, Edward L. Bonin, and Jack Kilby filed {{a patent}} titled [...] "Photosensitive Transistor Chopper Using Light Emissive Diode" [...] (U.S. Patent US3304431); the first <b>optical</b> <b>isolator.</b> Within the patent they {{described}} a phototransistor chopper consisting of an LED optically {{coupled with a}} dual emitter, photosensitive, silicon transistor. The arrangement provided a switching function in which the switch was completely electrically isolated from the LED that drove it. The transistor operated in response to light emitted from the LED when forward current bias was generated across the junction of the diode. When emitted light struck {{the surface of the}} transistor, it was absorbed in the regions of both the emitter-base and base-collector junctions causing the transistor to conduct. This photoconductive transistor could be rapidly turned on and off by intensity modulating the LED at a very high frequency using high frequency alternating voltage. Prior to their invention, complete electrical isolation of the switch element in a chopper from the driving source for opening and closing the switch element was not possible, even through use of isolation transformers. Using isolation transformers, which were bulky and expensive, in miniaturized circuits to separate the driving source and the switch element resulted in magnetic pick-up and spike feed-through due to the transformer winding capacitance. Optical isolators were ideal because they're very small and can be mounted to a circuit board. In addition, they offer protection against excessively high voltages, reduce noise levels, and make measurements more accurate. In March 1965, Texas Instruments announced the SNX1304 Optoelectronic Pulse Amplifier, which was conceived and developed by Dr. Biard and Jerry Merryman, the inventor of the first handheld digital calculator. The SNX1304 consisted of a GaAs p-n junction light emitter optically coupled to an integrated silicon photodetector feedback-amplifier circuit. The device is thought to be the first commercial optically coupled integrated circuit.|$|E
