40|$|Examinations {{were carried}} out in order to compare the {{fertility}} of production site 1 (chernozem soils) and production site 2 (mostly consisting of brown forest soils) which depends {{on the level of}} humus supply, using yield data collected from two different <b>crop</b> <b>years.</b> We were interested in the impact of the soil humus content on maize yield in different <b>crop</b> <b>years.</b> The nitrogen supply ability of the soil is taken into consideration along with the humus categories established in accordance with plasticity. The different impact of each category could also be shown statistically. The examinations {{were carried out}} using the country-wide database of the Agrochemical Information and Management System (AIIR) containing around 380 000 entries. On both production sites, but especially on chernozem, there are differences in yield also in terms of different <b>crop</b> <b>years.</b> It is a general tendency that maize yield increases with the increasing humus content of soils. At the same time, it can also be observed that favourable <b>crop</b> <b>years</b> result in yield depression on brown forest soils in the case of especially high humus supply on intensively cultivated agricultural plots (N-P-K> 50 - 50 - 100 kg ha- 1), while the same refers to chernozem soils in unfavourable <b>crop</b> <b>years.</b> The obtained results indicate that high maize yields can be expected even in the case of average humus content in favourable <b>crop</b> <b>years</b> both on chernozem and brown forest soil. However, in the case of unfavourable <b>crop</b> <b>year,</b> higher humus content (good and very good supply level) is expected to result in relatively higher yields. On chernozem soil, the statistically significant yield increasing effect of humus content (resulting in 15 % yield surplus) can be observed until average humus supply in favourable <b>crop</b> <b>years.</b> In unfavourable <b>crop</b> <b>years,</b> yield increases with the increase of humus supply until reaching high supply level, resulting in more than 25 % yield increase in comparison with very weak supply level. Significant yield increase was observed until average humus supply on brown forest soil – similarly to chernozem – in favourable <b>crop</b> <b>years.</b> On average, yield was 23 % higher than those of plots with very weak humus supply. On the contrary, yield increasing effect (12. 4 % altogether) can only be shown in the case of humus content increase ranging from very low to low supply in unfavourable <b>crop</b> <b>years.</b> There was no significant yield increase with the further increase of humus content.

JEL Classification: Q 13 A principal theory of futures markets tells that futures prices for storable commodities should be higher than spot prices by not more than the carrying charges. Carrying charges repre-sent the cost of storage, primarily warehousing and insurance cost plus interest foregone. If the spot price is too low relative to the futures price, a cash-and-carry arbitrage opportunity arises and the trader who engages in arbitrage reaps a riskless profit. Thus, in a normal mar-ket, a futures price spread is limited by arbi-trage to the full cost of carry. However, this theory is not always sup-ported by empirical evidence.

The objectives of this study were to compare use patterns of IR technology in winter wheat with respect to jointed goatgrass density and wheat grain contamination over three <b>crop</b> <b>years</b> in a winter wheat–fallow system and to monitor jointed goatgrass and jointed goatgrass × wheat hybrid populations for resistance to imazamox. The IR treatment resulted in reduced jointed goatgrass density compared to conventional treatments in 5 out of 6 yr. Reductions in jointed goatgrass tiller density resulting from use of imazamox in IR winter wheat were evident in a subsequent <b>crop</b> <b>year</b> at each of two experimental sites. No IR jointed goatgrass plants nor viable jointed goatgrass × wheat hybrid plants were found. In a winter wheat–fallow rotation, IR technology can effectively manage jointed goatgrass populations and reduce jointed goatgrass contamination of grain. Use of the technology every other <b>crop</b> <b>year,</b> or two out of every three <b>crop</b> <b>years,</b> will provide management benefits in subsequent years...|$|R
40|$|Brazil leads {{sugarcane}} world {{production and}} it makes properly information on sugarcane acreage be particularly important for government, traders, and farmers. The aim {{of this paper was}} to use multitemporal images acquired by Thematic Mapper (TM) sensor onboard Landsat- 5 spacecraft to identify and map sugarcane crop area in Porto Xavier municipality, Rio Grande do Sul (RS) State, Brazil. In order to define the most appropriate period to identify sugarcane fields we analyzed six images from October to June during <b>crop</b> <b>year</b> of 2008 / 2009. Sugarcane fields were mapped through a digital classification over the image acquired in early April followed by a careful process of visual interpretation using all six images. To map sugarcane fields in <b>crop</b> <b>years</b> 2006 / 2007 and 2007 / 2008, we used two images acquired in two key periods during sugarcane growing season (from mid January to late April) for each <b>crop</b> <b>year.</b> Results showed that multitemporal TM images are suitable to identify and map sugarcane fields in Porto Xavier-RS provided that at least two cloud free images are available within two key periods (between mid January and late February and early March to early May, respectively), and at least a two months interval from each other, when those fields are better discriminated over the images. By applying the methodology we could find a sugarcane crop area of 911, 966, and 747 hectares for <b>crop</b> <b>years</b> from 2006 / 2007 to 2008 / 2009, respectively. Pages: 299 - 30...|$|R
