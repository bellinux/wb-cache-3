The angle of inclination of the teeth in the slanted-tooth <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seal</b> was chosen to be 65 ? from the normal axis. The seals were tested at an inlet pressure of 70 bar-a (1015 psi-a), pressure ratios of 0. 4, 0. 5, and 0. 6, rotor speeds of 10, 200, 15, 350, and 20, 200 rpm, and a radial clearance of 0. 2 mm (8 mils). The experiments were carried out at zero, medium, and high inlet preswirl ratios. The experimental results show only minute differences in the rotordynamic coefficients between the two seals.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Centrifugal compressors are increasingly required to operate in higher pressure, higher speed, and large fluid density. In these conditions, compressors are susceptible to rotordynamic instabilities. To avoid this situation, <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seals</b> have been modified by (a) using swirl brakes, and (b) using shunt injection. In some cases, <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seals</b> have been replaced entirely by honeycomb seals. In shunt injection, the gas is taken from the diff-user or discharge volute, and injected into an upstream cavity of the <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seal.</b> The injection can be radial or against rotation. Even though <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seals</b> with shunt injection have successfully been used since 1970 s, this thesis contains the first measured rotordynamic data for <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seals</b> with shunt injection. A comparison has been made between <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seals,</b> with and without swirl brakes, <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seal</b> with shunt injection (radial and against rotation), and a honeycomb seal. The leakage comparison demonstrates that the honeycomb seal has the best flow control, and the <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seals</b> with shunt injection the worst. For low and medium running speed, and most conditions, the <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seal</b> with injection against rotation has the best rotordynamic stability followed in order by the honeycomb seal, radial shunt injection, and the <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seal</b> with and without swirl brakes. When running speed increases, the effective damping decreases for the <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seal</b> with injection against rotation. For high speed and high pressure ratio across the seal, the honeycomb seals have better rotordynamic performance. In centrifugal compressors, the selection of the seal should be cautiously analyzed.

The concept {{is based on the}} principle that the incoming waves will run uphill on a structure slope and on their return downhill they will flow into multiple reservoirs at different levels. A turbine with multiple stages is being designed to handle the conversion of the potential energy from the different reservoirs. One critical design element of the so-called Multi Stage Turbine (MST) is the choice of <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seals.</b> The <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seals</b> need to be designed in a way that prevents air from leaking into the suction side of the turbine stages. The company Mechanica AS has suggested a design where the <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seals</b> are pressurized by leading water from above the turbine through orifices to the lower <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seal.</b> A model has been made and the <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seal</b> has been tested. The model does not include the turbine, but only the <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seal</b> with appropriate pressure conditions.

However, {{with the development of}} turbo-machinery toward high performance and huge capacity, gas excitation vibration within the <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seal</b> becomes the main reason threatening safe operating of machinery sets. Recently three dimensional computational fluid dynamic was applied to analyse inside flow in <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seal.</b> These researches, while greatly improve rotordynamic prediction of <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seals,</b> are mostly focused in steady calculation. In fact, rotor inside the seal is whirling in a nonlinear behaviour, which makes the flow unstable.

The Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes equations is solved by a commercial CFD program, FLUENT.
