5|$|Local {{government}} for the town of Reading is principally provided by Reading Borough Council, a single level unitary authority without civil parishes. However some of the town's outer suburbs are in West Berkshire and Wokingham unitary authorities. These outer suburbs belong to civil parishes, in some cases with their own town status. Reading has elected at least one Member of Parliament to every Parliament since 1295. Historically, Reading was represented by the members for the Parliamentary Borough <b>of</b> <b>Reading,</b> <b>and</b> the parliamentary constituencies of Reading, Reading North, and Reading South. Since the 2010 general election, Reading and its surrounding area has been divided between the parliamentary constituencies of Reading East and Reading West. The whole of the town is within the multi-member South East England European constituency.|$|E
5|$|Robin Friday (27 July 1952– 22 December 1990) was an English footballer {{who played}} professionally as a forward for Reading and Cardiff City during {{a career that}} lasted {{four years in the}} mid-1970s. His on-field {{performances}} were regarded as excellent, and he won Reading's player of the year award in both of his full seasons there, as well as being the leading goal scorer. However, his habit of unsettling opponents through physical intimidation contributed to a heavily tarnished disciplinary record, and his personal life was one of heavy smoking, drinking, womanising and drug abuse. Despite his short career, he remains prominent in the memory <b>of</b> <b>Reading</b> <b>and</b> Cardiff supporters, both as a player and a personality. He has been voted Reading's best ever player three times.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} three-component {{model of a}} digi-tal {{investigation}} which comprises: determination of input-output layers, assignment <b>of</b> <b>read</b> <b>and</b> write operations associated with use of forensic tools, <b>and</b> time-stamping <b>of</b> <b>read</b> <b>and</b> write operations.

50|$|A memory model {{allows a}} {{compiler}} to perform many important optimizations. Compiler optimizations like loop fusion move {{statements in the}} program, which can influence the order <b>of</b> <b>read</b> <b>and</b> write operations <b>of</b> potentially shared variables. Changes in the ordering <b>of</b> <b>reads</b> <b>and</b> writes can cause race conditions. Without a memory model, a compiler {{is not allowed to}} apply such optimizations to multi-threaded programs in general, or only in special cases.|$|R
30|$|The input {{workload}} to a CICT is {{a series}} <b>of</b> <b>read</b> <b>and</b> update operations. In case of a real time web application, this input is a random sequence <b>of</b> <b>read</b> <b>and</b> update operations separated with random time gap. As we had to control the input workload, the sub transactions on a data object are modelled using a multithreaded, randomly generated sequence <b>of</b> <b>read</b> <b>and</b> updates. Thus the workload was randomized {{with respect to the}} number <b>of</b> <b>reads</b> <b>and</b> updates and their occurrence. The database design in terms of number of replicas was statically fed to the tuner and varied for observations. The desired value of CI (CIdesired) was fed and varied for different observation sequence. The threshold–time predictor uses the statistical linear regression between the time gap and number of replicas as discussed in 7.2. 4. The time gap padder then pads the minimum time gap between an update <b>and</b> a succeeding <b>read</b> so that it results in correct read. This results in increase in the value of CI at the cost of response time. When CI reaches the user defined value, the time delay is not introduced until the next poll.|$|R
5|$|Tayutama is {{a romance}} visual novel {{in which the}} player assumes the role of Yuri Mito. Its {{gameplay}} mainly consists <b>of</b> <b>reading</b> <b>and</b> progressing through the story's narrative and dialogue. The game's text is accompanied by character sprites, which represent who Yuri is talking to, appearing on top of background artwork. Throughout the game, the player encounters CG artwork at certain points in the story, which {{take the place of}} the regular background art and character sprites. When the game is completed at least once, a gallery of the viewed CGs and played background music is available on the game's title screen. Tayutama follows a branching plot line with nonlinear sequences and multiple endings, where the plot's direction is affected by the player's decisions.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} awaiting Mary Godwin in England was {{fraught with}} complications, {{some of which}} she had not foreseen. Either before or during the journey, she had become pregnant. She and Percy now found themselves penniless, and, to Mary's genuine surprise, her father refused {{to have anything to}} do with her. The couple moved with Claire into lodgings at Somers Town, and later, Nelson Square. They maintained their intense programme <b>of</b> <b>reading</b> <b>and</b> writing, and entertained Percy Shelley's friends, such as Thomas Jefferson Hogg and the writer Thomas Love Peacock. Percy Shelley sometimes left home for short periods to dodge creditors. The couple's distraught letters reveal their pain at these separations.|$|E
