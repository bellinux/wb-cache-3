With {{the widely}} {{application}} of High Level Architecture (HLA) standard that supports interoperability and reusability, correct understanding of time management and advance mechanism in HLA {{has been a}} concerning difficult problem {{in the field of}} distributed simulation. Aiming at the problem, the paper analyzed and compared difference between conservative time advance mechanism and <b>optimistic</b> <b>time</b> advance mechanism. The rollback manager was introduced to implement the <b>optimistic</b> <b>time</b> advance mechanism. The middleware was also applied to deal with the rollback process in simulation model.

40|$|Graduation date: 1966 The {{utilization}} of historical data is suggested as {{an approach to}} solving some of the difficulties involved in the estimating of activity durations in critical path scheduling. The historical data presented show the effects of various weather conditions upon the performance of human labor and mechanical equipment. When combined with climatological data for a particular locality, it becomes possible to use the historical data to estimate the degree of performance by humans and mechanical equipment that {{is most likely to}} be expected during that interval of time. The concept of a probability-performance calendar is developed along with a nomograph for relating the degree of performance to the <b>estimated</b> <b>optimistic</b> <b>time</b> to obtain the most likely <b>time</b> <b>estimate</b> for the activity. Finally, it is shown how the historic data is applied in the critical path analysis by means of comparing the use of the proposed approach to estimating activity durations with the critical path analysis of an actual project...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} two {{approaches}} {{to improving the}} performance of single-processor timed cosimulation. One of the approaches is <b>optimistic</b> <b>timed</b> cosimulation {{and the other is}} non-IPC (interprocess communication) <b>timed</b> cosimulation. The <b>optimistic</b> <b>timed</b> cosimulation algorithm optimistically <b>estimates</b> the <b>time</b> for synchronization between HW simulator and SW simulator and runs simulation through that time point. Because of optimistic estimation, it is possible for a simulator to run beyond the actual synchronization time point. In this case, it rolls back and re-executes the simulation. The proposed optimistic cosimulation algorithm minimizes the frequency of simulator synchronization at a negligible simulation time overhead due to rollback and re-execution. In non-IPC timed cosimulation, since IPC-based synchronization between HW simulator and SW simulator is not required, the synchronization overhead due to IPC is almost eliminated. Experimental results show the efficiency of the [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Although <b>time</b> <b>estimates</b> {{are used}} {{extensively}} for costing purposes, they {{are prone to}} measurement error. In an experimental setting, we research how measurement error in <b>time</b> <b>estimates</b> varies with: (1) the level of aggregation {{in the definition of}} costing system activities (aggregated or disaggregated); (2) task order (the extent to which the activities that require <b>time</b> <b>estimates</b> present themselves systematically or mixed); and (3) when notice is given that <b>time</b> <b>estimates</b> will be required (in advance or after the fact), that is, whether participants know that <b>time</b> <b>estimates</b> will be required before they perform the activities. We also test on response mode (estimates in percentages or absolute time units). The results suggest an important trade-off between the level of aggregation and measurement error: disaggregation of activities leads to higher measurement error. Also, advance notification reduces measurement error, especially in settings with aggregated activities or mixed tasks. Finally, we find a strong overestimation bias when participants provide <b>time</b> <b>estimates</b> in minutes, which may be problematic for Time-Driven Activity-Based Costing that advocates the use of estimates in minutes.

40|$|The {{achievements}} attained in {{accelerating the}} simulation {{of the dynamics}} of complex discrete event systems using parallel or distributed multiprocessing environments are comprehensively presented. While parallel discrete event simulation (DES) governs the evolution of the system over simulated time in an iterative SIMD way, distributed DES tries to spatially decompose the event structure underlying the system, and executes event occurrences in spatial subregions by logical processes (LPs) usually assigned to dierent (physical) processing elements. Synchroniza-tion protocols are necessary in this approach to avoid timing inconsistencies and to guarantee the preservation of event causalities across LPs. Included in the survey are discussions on the sources and levels of parallelism, synchronous vs. asynchronous simulation and principles of LP simulation. In the context of conservative LP simulation (Chandy/Misra/Bryant) deadlock avoidance and deadlock detection/recovery strate-gies, Conservative Time Windows and the Carrier Nullmessage protocol are presented.
