5|$|White {{missed the}} opening <b>of</b> <b>NBA</b> camp on Monday October 1, {{due to a}} desire to have a {{contractual}} plan put in place with the Rockets and the NBA that addressed the league wide mental health policy or lack thereof. After sessions with his own long-time doctor, White requested permission to travel by bus when {{necessary in order to}} limit his flight schedule. The Rockets and White came to an agreement regarding travel, including allowing White travel by personal bus rather than flying (which has been an anxiety trigger in the past for white).

5|$|On July 10, 2015, Stauskas {{was traded}} to the Philadelphia 76ers along with Carl Landry, Jason Thompson, a future first round pick, and the rights to swap first round picks in 2016 and 2017, in {{exchange}} for the rights to Artūras Gudaitis and Luka Mitrović. During the preseason, Stauskas was impaired by a right tibia stress reaction. Although he felt recovered from the stress reaction {{by the beginning of the}} season, he missed the October 28 season opener with back spasms. The 2015–16 76ers team played no players over the age of 24 or with more than 3 years <b>of</b> <b>NBA</b> experience on opening night. Stauskas joined the young team's rotation in October 30 against the Utah Jazz with a 12-point debut performance. Stauskas moved into the starting lineup on November 2 against the Cleveland Cavaliers. He posted a career-high tying 15 points against his idol LeBron James. On November 7, Stauskas posted a career-high 18 points and career-high tying five assists against the Orlando Magic. He tallied at least 12 points in each of his first five games of action for Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|The union {{rejected}} the offer on November 9 {{and asked for}} another bargaining session. The two sides met again as the deadline passed. After two days of negotiation, the owners put forth a revised final offer {{and said that they}} were done bargaining. If accepted by the players, Stern hoped to start a 72-game season in mid December. On November 14, the union {{rejected the}} last offer and dissolved the union. The NBPA was converted into a trade association, enabling the players as individual employees to participate in a class action antitrust lawsuit against the league, calling the lockout an illegal group boycott. Attorney David Boies, who represented the NFL owners in their 2011 lockout, agreed to represent the players and join Keesler, who also represented the players in the NFL lockout. On November 15, one group <b>of</b> <b>NBA</b> players (including Carmelo Anthony, Chauncey Billups, Kawhi Leonard, and Leon Powe) filed an antitrust lawsuit against the NBA in a California federal court, while another (including Anthony Tolliver, Ben Gordon, Caron Butler and Derrick Williams) filed their own suit against the NBA in a Minnesota federal court. November 15 was also the day players were to receive their first paychecks if the season was played.|$|E

5|$|With Phil Jackson's {{contract}} expiring, {{the pending}} departures of Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman looming, {{and being in}} the latter stages of an owner-induced lockout <b>of</b> <b>NBA</b> players, Jordan retired {{for the second time}} on January 13, 1999. On January 19, 2000, Jordan returned to the NBA not as a player, but as part owner and President of Basketball Operations for the Washington Wizards. Jordan's responsibilities with the Wizards were comprehensive. He controlled all aspects of the Wizards' basketball operations, and had the final say in all personnel matters. Opinions of Jordan as a basketball executive were mixed. He managed to purge the team of several highly paid, unpopular players (such as forward Juwan Howard and point guard Rod Strickland), but used the first pick in the 2001 NBA draft to select high schooler Kwame Brown, who did not live up to expectations and was traded away after four seasons.|$|E
