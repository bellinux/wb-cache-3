25|$|While these bands {{moved off}} into heavy metal music, in {{roughly the same}} period a number of {{performers}} emerged who mixed early music and acoustic instruments with soft or hard rock, relying heavily on the network of medieval markets and renaissance fairs. Ritchie Blackmore, having dropped musical clues to his interest in early music throughout his career, took the surprising step of forming the renaissance focused rock band Blackmore's Night with vocalist Candice Night in 1997. Blackmore is usually careful to describe his music as ‘renaissance rock’, which is more accurate as a description of the source of his inspiration, but also distinguishes it from other forms of medieval based music. Other performers who produce medieval electric music include the California-based Avalon Rising and Circulus from England, both of which describe their music, among <b>other</b> <b>things,</b> <b>as</b> medieval folk rock.|$|E
25|$|Calvinists {{broke from}} the Roman Catholic Church in the 16th century. Calvinism differs from Lutherans {{on the real}} {{presence}} of Christ in the Eucharist, theories of worship, {{and the use of}} God's law for believers, among <b>other</b> <b>things.</b> <b>As</b> declared in the Westminster and Second Helvetic confessions, the core doctrines are predestination and election. A basic principle is that they deny the Catholic teaching that humans can achieve salvation through their actions. The protestant part of this reformation was considering that the Bible be interpreted by itself, meaning the parts that are harder to understand are examined in the light of other passages where the Bible is more explicit on the matter. The term Calvinism can be misleading, because the religious tradition which it denotes has always been diverse, {{with a wide range of}} influences rather than a single founder. The movement was first called Calvinism by Lutherans who opposed it referring to French reformer John Calvin, and many within the tradition would prefer to use the word Reformed.|$|E

25|$|The Ireland cricket {{team have}} had huge success {{recently}} {{on the international}} level which has boosted {{the popularity of the}} game in the country. They had earned the reputation of a giant killer after upsetting teams like Pakistan and Bangladesh (2007 Cricket World Cup), and England (2011 Cricket World Cup). Their good performances in major international tournaments meant that Cricket Ireland openly started bidding for Test match status to the International Cricket Council. Nevertheless, one of the main stumbling road blocks for Ireland from getting to play the pinnacle of the game was a lack of a first-class cricket infrastructure at home, amongst <b>other</b> <b>things.</b> <b>As</b> early as August 2011, Cricket Ireland announced plans of a domestic first-class tournament. In January 2012, Cricket Ireland announced the ambitious 'Vision 2020' plan which announced the establishment of a first-class structure by 2015 and achievement of Test status by 2020. It also began work on a cricket academy to find talented players across the country and improving grass-roots cricket in the country. For the first time professional contacts, with central, A, B, and C were established. Plans for Test status were established partly to stem the flow of their star cricketers moving away to England in hope of playing Test cricket such as Ed Joyce, Eoin Morgan and Boyd Rankin. According to Richard Holdsworth in an interview with Setanta Sports, CI are pleased with the strategic progress that had been made as of November 2012. In December 2012, Ireland got a $1.5m boost as increased funding from the ICC to establish elite domestic competitions in the country.|$|E

500|$|Caracalla {{has had a}} {{reputation}} as being among the worst of Roman emperors, a perception that survives even into modern works. The art and linguistics historian John Agnew and the writer Walter Bidwell describe Caracalla as having an evil spirit, referring to the devastation he wrought in Alexandria. The Roman historian David Magie describes Caracalla, in the book Roman Rule in Asia Minor, as brutal and tyrannical and points towards psychopathy as an explanation for his behaviour. Gibbon, author of The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, takes Caracalla's reputation, which he had received for the murder of Geta and subsequent massacre of Geta's supporters, and applies it to Caracalla's provincial tours, suggesting that [...] "every province was by turn the scene of his rapine and cruelty". The historian Clifford Ando supports this description, suggesting that Caracalla's rule as sole emperor is notable [...] "almost exclusively" [...] for his crimes of theft, massacre, and mismanagement. By contrast, this representation is questioned by the historian Shamus Sillar, who cites the construction of roads and reinforcement of fortifications in the western provinces, among <b>other</b> <b>things,</b> <b>as</b> being contradictory to the representation made by Gibbon of cruelty and destruction. The history professors Molefi Asante and Shaza Ismail note that Caracalla is known for the disgraceful nature of his rule, stating that [...] "he rode the horse of power until it nearly died of exhaustion" [...] and that though his rule was short, his life, personality, and acts made him a notable, though likely not beneficial, figure in the Roman Empire.|$|E

2500|$|As {{mentioned}} above, Schopenhauer's {{notion of}} the will comes from the Kantian thing-in-itself, which Kant {{believed to be the}} fundamental reality behind the representation that provided the matter of perception, but lacked form. Kant believed that space, time, causation, and many other similar phenomena belonged properly to the form imposed on the world by the human mind in order to create the representation, and these factors were absent from the thing-in-itself. Schopenhauer pointed out that anything outside of time and space could not be differentiated, so the thing-in-itself must be one and all things that exist, including human beings, must be part of this fundamental unity. [...] Our inner-experience must be a manifestation of the noumenal realm and the will is the inner kernel of every being. [...] All knowledge gained of objects is seen as self-referential, as we recognize the same will in <b>other</b> <b>things</b> <b>as</b> is inside us.|$|E

2500|$|... 1 Kings 16:29 through 22:40 {{contains}} {{the story of}} Ahab's reign. This reign is one which faces opposition from several prophets of Yahweh throughout as well as various consequences because of his marriage to Jezebel, because of his worship of Baal, disobedience to prophetic warnings and words, and {{also because of the}} murder of Naboth. The murder of Naboth (see Jezebel), an act of royal encroachment, stirred up popular resentment just as the new cult aroused the opposition of the Israelite prophets, including Elijah and Micaiah. Indeed, he is referred to, for this and <b>other</b> <b>things,</b> <b>as</b> being [...] "more evil than all the kings before him" [...] (1 Kings 16:30). The followers of Yahweh found their champion in Elijah. His denunciation of the royal dynasty of Israel and his emphatic insistence on the worship of Yahweh and Yahweh alone, illustrated by the contest between Yahweh and Baal on Mount Carmel (1 Kings 18), form the keynote to a period which culminated in the accession of Jehu, an event in which Elijah's chosen disciple Elisha was the leading figure.|$|E
2500|$|Whatever the faults of Maxentius, his {{reputation}} in Rome {{was influenced by}} his contributions to public building. By {{the time of his}} accession in 306 Rome was becoming increasingly irrelevant to the governance of the empire, most emperors choosing to live elsewhere and focusing on defending the fragile boundaries, where they frequently founded new cities. This factor contributed to his ability to seize power. By contrast Maxentius concentrated on restoring the capital, his epithet being conservator urbis suae (preserver of his city). Thus Constantine was perceived amongst <b>other</b> <b>things</b> <b>as</b> the deposer of one of the city's greatest benefactors, and needed to acquire legitimacy. Much controversy has surrounded the patronage of the public works of this period. The German philosopher, Walter Benjamin observed that history is seen {{through the eyes of the}} victor (Über den Begriff der Geschichte VII, 1940), and Constantine and his biographers were no exception. Issuing a damnatio memoriae [...] he set out to systematically erase the memory of Maxentius. Consequently, there remains considerable uncertainty regarding the patronage of early fourth century public buildings, including the Arch of Constantine, which may originally have been an Arch of Maxentius.|$|E
