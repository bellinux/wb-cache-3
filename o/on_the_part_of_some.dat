5|$|The tantra {{practices}} are secretive, subject to speculations and criticism. Scholars variously attribute such criticism to ignorance, misunderstanding or sectarian bias <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> observers, {{as well as}} unscrupulous practices by some Shaktas. These {{are some of the}} reasons many Hindus question the relevance and historicity of Tantra to their tradition.|$|E
5|$|The {{process by}} which an {{organisation}} achieves sufficient prominence that {{it is able to}} exercise naked power can be described as the rule of three phases (Russell 1938:63). According to this rule, what begins as fanaticism <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> crowd eventually produces conquest by means of naked power. Eventually, the acquiescence of the outlying population transforms naked power into traditional power. Finally, once a traditional power has taken hold, it engages in the suppression of dissent by the use of naked power.|$|E

25|$|Petitions {{to secure}} a charter for the college from the state {{legislature}} were denied in 1847 {{for a variety of}} reasons, including anti-Catholicism <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> legislators. The increased rate of immigration from Ireland during the famine years roused resistance from some residents of Massachusetts. Initially, Holy Cross diplomas were signed by the president of Georgetown University. After repeated denials, a charter was finally granted on March 24, 1865, by Governor John Albion Andrew.|$|E

Aston Villa won the inaugural League Cup and, despite an initial lack of enthusiasm <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> other big clubs, the competition became firmly established in the footballing calendar, although it was not until the dawn of the 1970s that all 92 Football League clubs regularly participated in the competition season after season.|$|E
25|$|After 1830, {{abolitionist}} and minister William Lloyd Garrison promoted emancipation, characterizing slaveholding as {{a personal}} sin. He demanded that slaveowners repent and start the process of emancipation. His position increased defensiveness <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> southerners, who noted {{the long history of}} slavery among many cultures. A few abolitionists, such as John Brown, favored the use of armed force to foment uprisings among the slaves, as he did at Harper's Ferry. Most abolitionists tried to raise public support to change laws and to challenge slave laws. Abolitionists were active on the lecture circuit in the North, and often featured escaped slaves in their presentations. The eloquent Frederick Douglass became an important abolitionist leader after escaping from slavery. Harriet Beecher Stowe's novel Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852) was an international bestseller and aroused popular sentiment against slavery. It also provoked the publication of numerous anti-Tom novels by Southerners in the years before the American Civil War.|$|E

25|$|Dr Michael Dixon was {{appointed}} the Foundation's medical director. From 2005 to 2007, FIH received {{a grant from}} the Department of Health to help organise the self-regulation of complementary therapies. There had been concern that with {{a large proportion of the}} public turning to complementary approaches, there were few safeguards in place to ensure that non-statutorily regulated therapists were safe, trained and would act in an appropriate way. FIH worked to bring together the representative bodies of many complementary professions to talk and agree standards. The result was the formation of the Complementary and Natural Healthcare Council (CNHC) which had hoped to register 10,000 practitioners of complementary medicine by the end of 2009 but which by September 2009 had succeeded in enrolling less than a tenth of that number due to lack of interest <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> of their professional associations. The Department of Health is currently continuing to fund the CNHC but future funding will be dependent on substantial progress being made towards the target (which has now been reduced to 2,000). Alternative medicine campaigners argued that the move toward regulation conferred undue respectability on unproven and possibly unsafe CAM approaches.|$|E
25|$|On {{the first}} Friday after the siege, Uthman {{addressed}} the congregation in the mosque. After praising God and blessing and wishing peace on Muhammad, Uthman invited {{the attention of}} the people to the commandment in the Quran requiring the people to obey God, His Apostle, and those in authority among them. He observed that the Muslims had been enjoined to settle all matters by mutual consultation. He said that he had kept the doors of consultation wide open. All the allegations that had been levelled against him had been duly explained by him and shown to be false. He had expressed his readiness to solve the legitimate grievances of the people, if any. He observed that under the circumstances it was uncharitable <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> persons to create disturbances in Mecca. He said that he was not afraid of death, but he did not want the Muslims to be guilty of bloodshed. To him the solidarity of the Muslim community was very dear and in order to prevent dissension among the Muslims he had instructed his supporters to refrain from violence. He wanted the people to be afraid of God and not to indulge in activities subversive of Islam. He pointed out that the foreign powers smarting under their defeat inflicted by the Muslim arms had sponsored some conspiracies to subvert Islam. He warned the people not to play {{in the hands of the}} enemies of Islam. He appealed to the rebels to retire from Madina. He wanted the people of Madina to support the cause of truth and justice and withhold their support from the rebels bent on mischief.|$|E

40|$|Based on an attributional {{model of}} achievement-related behavior, it was {{predicted}} that success <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> a young person and failure <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> an old person, being expected outcomes, would be attributed to stable causes, whereas success <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> an old person and failure <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> a young person, being unexpected outcomes, would be attributed to unstable causes. Using a between-subjects experimental design, subjects were asked to estimate the probability that a young vs an old stimulus person would succeed in college and to judge the causes for his success or failure. Although there occurred no differences as a function of age in expectancy of success or attributions for success, failure <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old stimulus person was attributed more to the stable causes of lack of ability and task difficulty, while failure <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> young stimulus person was attributed more to the unstable cause of lack of effort. The results were discussed in terms of those conditions under which negative stereotypes concerning the competency of the elderly will be considered appropriate and thereby exert an influence on evaluations.
