25|$|A {{relatively}} new avenue {{of research is}} the combination of artificial intelligence and CCBT. It has been proposed to use modern technology to create CCBT that simulates face-to-face therapy. This might be achieved in cognitive behavior therapy for a specific disorder using the comprehensive domain knowledge of CBT. <b>One</b> <b>area</b> <b>where</b> this has been attempted is the specific domain area of social anxiety in those who stutter.|$|E
25|$|Of the country's livestock, sheep {{are by far}} {{the most}} numerous, {{followed}} by goats, cattle, donkeys, horses, water buffalo, and mules. The raising of poultry for eggs and meat is prevalent. <b>One</b> <b>area</b> <b>where</b> production infrastructure has progressed rapidly is the poultry sector. The face of the industry has now been transformed dramatically so that the entire supply chain process can take place domestically.|$|E

25|$|<b>One</b> <b>area</b> <b>where</b> the Clarence City Council {{has been}} {{particularly}} effective is in developing Community Arts events. For many years the Carols by Candlelight festival held annually in Charles Hand Park {{in the heart of}} the city, has continued to draw crowds of upwards of 20,000. Other annual events organised by the council include the City of Clarence Australia Day Festival, the Clarence Jazz Festival, and the Clarence Seafarers Festival - incorporating the Bellerive Regatta.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes the Serbian {{authorities}} {{cooperated with}} the Germans as matter of course, whereas others took individual initiative; some Serbian military commanders rounded-up Gypsies {{so they could be}} concentrated in <b>one</b> <b>area,</b> <b>where</b> they were shot. German occupiers declared Serbia Judenfrei in August 1942. The major concentration camps in Serbia were Sajmište and Banjica but many others like Topovske Supe, Schabatz, and Nisch concentration camps also interned considerable numbers of Jews. Before the war was concluded, upwards of 14,500 Serbian Jews were murdered. Legends about Serbs saving the Jews in World War II are widespread in Serbia, and 132 Serbs have been honored as righteous Gentiles.|$|E
25|$|Despite these problems, one of {{the main}} {{achievements}} of Attlee's government was the maintenance of near full employment. The government maintained most of the wartime controls over the economy, including control over the allocation of materials and manpower, and unemployment rarely rose above 500,000, or 3% of the total workforce. In fact labour shortages proved {{to be more of a}} problem. <b>One</b> <b>area</b> <b>where</b> the government was not quite as successful was in housing, which was also the responsibility of Aneurin Bevan. The government had a target to build 400,000 new houses a year to replace those which had been destroyed in the war, but shortages of materials and manpower meant that less than half this number were built.|$|E

25|$|Today, {{the legal}} system is assumed to contain some earlier law {{influenced}} by the church, and adaptation through methods of reasoning the Irish jurists would have sanctioned. There is dispute, however, as to just how large a role each of these aspects may have played in creating the legal texts. The subject is an important scope for debate. There is, however, <b>one</b> <b>area</b> <b>where</b> scholars have found material that is clearly old. A number of legal terms {{have been shown to}} have originated in the period before the Celtic Languages split up because they are preserved in both Old Irish and in the Welsh legal texts. On the other hand, this is not regarded as unquestionable evidence that the practices described by such terms are unchanged or even have their origins in the same period as do the terms.|$|E
25|$|<b>One</b> <b>area</b> <b>where</b> hypersegregation {{seems to}} have the {{greatest}} effect is in violence experienced by residents. The number of violent crimes in the U.S. in general has fallen. The number of murders in the U.S. fell 9% from the 1980s to the 1990s. Despite this number, the crime rates in the hypersegregated inner-cities of America are rising. As of 1993, young African-American men are eleven {{times more likely to be}} shot to death and nine times more likely to be murdered than their European American peers. Poverty, high unemployment, and broken families, all factors more prevalent in hypersegregated inner-cities, all contribute significantly to the unequal levels of violence experienced by African-Americans. Research has proven that the more segregated the surrounding European American suburban ring is, the rate of violent crime in the inner-city will rise, but, likewise, crime in the outer area will drop.|$|E
25|$|The {{progression}} of the war demonstrated the South's disadvantage in engineering expertise; of the initial 65 cadets who resigned from West Point to accept positions with the Confederate Army, only seven {{were placed in the}} Corps of Engineers. To overcome this obstacle, the Confederate Congress passed legislation that gave a company of engineers to every division in the field; by 1865, they actually had more engineer officers serving in the field of action than the Union Army. The Army Corps of Engineers served as a main function in making the war effort logistically feasible. One of the main projects for the Army Corps of Engineers was constructing railroads and bridges, which Union forces took advantage of because railroads and bridges provided access to resources and industry. <b>One</b> <b>area</b> <b>where</b> the Confederate engineers were able to outperform the Union Army was in the ability to build fortifications that were used both offensively and defensively along with trenches that made them harder to penetrate. This method of building trenches was known as the zigzag pattern.|$|E

25|$|<b>One</b> <b>area</b> <b>where</b> {{data access}} {{is likely to}} be {{difficult}} is flows from the technosphere. The technosphere is more simply defined as the man-made world. Considered by geologists as secondary resources, these resources are in theory 100% recyclable; however, in a practical sense, the primary goal is salvage. For an LCI, these technosphere products (supply chain products) are those that have been produced by man and unfortunately those completing a questionnaire about a process which uses a man-made product as {{a means to an end}} will be unable to specify how much of a given input they use. Typically, they will not have access to data concerning inputs and outputs for previous production processes of the product. The entity undertaking the LCA must then turn to secondary sources if it does not already have that data from its own previous studies. National databases or data sets that come with LCA-practitioner tools, or that can be readily accessed, are the usual sources for that information. Care must then be taken to ensure that the secondary data source properly reflects regional or national conditions.|$|E
500|$|Another {{aspect of}} the game that has {{attracted}} criticism is the reuse of graphical designs from Final Fantasy X. One reviewer at RPGamer commented that [...] "there is little question that the graphics in Final Fantasy X-2 could rival just about any other RPG on the market ... one does not get ... that the graphics have been improved in any significant way since Final Fantasy X", while GameSpot said [...] "X-2 doesn't look that much better than X did two years ago".

500|$|In 1868 Gray had a year's {{leave of}} absence and visited Darwin in Englandthe first time they had met since they started their correspondence.

[...] Darwin {{dedicated}} his 1877 book The Different Forms of Flowers on Plants of the Same Species to Gray [...] "as a small tribute of respect and affection". <b>One</b> <b>area</b> <b>where</b> Darwin and Gray disagreed was Darwin's theory of pangenesis. The Grays traveled to Europe again during 1880–1881, including a final visit to Down House, Darwin's home. He spent a year in Europe this time studying. Darwin died in 1882.|$|E

500|$|In {{his article}} recommending the mod, Alec Meer of Rock, Paper, Shotgun {{speculated that the}} Long War mod {{influenced}} the development of XCOM 2. <b>One</b> <b>area</b> <b>where</b> Long Wars influence was acknowledged was {{in the decision to}} support modding. The development team recognized that Enemy Unknown and Enemy Within were exceptionally difficult to mod, and aimed to make modding more accessible in the sequel. At a panel with XCOM 2 developers, Ryan McFall remarked that [...] "we kind of watched in morbid fascination the Long War crew kind of hacking our game apart" [...] before going on to provide a list of features and assets that would be available to people interested in modding XCOM 2. Jake Solomon pointed to the successes of Long War and mods to games in the Civilization franchise in explaining the decision to support modding.|$|E
