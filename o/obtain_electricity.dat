2500|$|The {{government}} {{refused to}} implement the 1926 recommendations of the Gaeltacht Commission, which included restoring Irish as the language of administration in such areas. As {{the role of the}} state grew, it therefore exerted tremendous pressure on Irish speakers to use English. This was only partly offset by measures which were supposed to support the Irish language. For instance, the state was by far the largest employer. A qualification in Irish was required to apply for state jobs. However, this did not require a high level of fluency, and few public employees were ever required to use Irish in the course of their work. On the other hand, state employees had to have perfect command of English and had to use it constantly. Because most public employees had a poor command of Irish, it was impossible to deal with them in Irish. If an Irish speaker wanted to apply for a grant, <b>obtain</b> <b>electricity,</b> or complain about being over-taxed, they would typically have had to do so in English.

40|$|The {{financial}} costs of <b>obtaining</b> <b>electricity</b> from small wind-energy conversion systems are calculated and {{compared with the}} cost of electricity from traditional utility companies. A 3 kW rated wind electric system for residential use is examined.

Variations in electricity costs as a function of available wind energy, residential consumption patterns and system components and costs are examined. The cost of electricity from small wind-energy conversion systems has considerable variations under differing assumptions or parameters but may, in some cases, be competitive with utility company costs. ...|$|R

5000|$|From the passenger's perspective, monorails {{can have}} some {{advantages}} over trains, buses, and automobiles. As with other grade-separated transit systems, monorails avoid red lights, intersection turns, and traffic jams. [...] Surface-level trains, buses, automobiles, and pedestrians can collide each one with the other, while vehicles on dedicated, grade-separated rights-of-way such as monorails can collide only with other vehicles on the same system, with much fewer opportunities for collision. As with other elevated transit systems, monorail passengers enjoy sunlight and views and by watching for familiar landmarks, they can know better when to get off to reach their destinations. [...] As with other systems, expensive and noisy ventilation systems are not necessary if the cars have traditional windows that can be opened by passengers. (This also eliminates the weight and bulk of ventilation systems.) Monorails can be quieter than diesel buses and trains. They <b>obtain</b> <b>electricity</b> from the track structure, eliminating costly and unsightly overhead power lines and poles. Compared to the elevated train systems of New York, Chicago and elsewhere, a monorail beamway casts a narrow shadow. (See 'Chicago [...] "L"' [...] ) ...|$|E

Three generators (from the USA, Japan and Germany) produce about 30 kilowatts under optimal conditions, which enter the electrical network through a power inverter.|$|R

5000|$|The smelter uses up to 610MW of {{electricity}} which is mostly {{supplied by the}} hydroelectric Manapouri Power Station. The perceived reliability of power from Manapouri {{played a major role}} in the choice of building the aluminium smelter in Southland, with both the power plant and the smelter having been constructed as a joint project. The facility is the largest electricity consumer in New Zealand, and uses approximately one third of the total power of the South Island and 15% of the total power countrywide. The electricity contract with Meridian Energy (and its predecessors) has long been criticised as being secret and effectively a tax-payer funded subsidy (or corporate welfare) for a large transnational corporation. [...] In 2007 New Zealand Aluminium Smelters negotiated a new contract for electricity supply with Meridian Energy for the continuous supply of 572 megawatts for the period 2013 to 2030.
