25|$|The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) {{reported}} that growth for stock and commodities traders was forecast {{to be greater}} than 21% between 2006 and 2016. In that period, stock traders would benefit from trends driven by pensions of baby boomers and their decreased reliance on Social Security. U.S. Treasury bonds would also be traded on a more fluctuating basis. Stock traders just entering the field suffer since few entry-level positions exist. While entry into this career field is very competitive, increased ownership <b>of</b> <b>stocks</b> <b>and</b> mutual funds drive substantial career growth of traders. Banks were also offering more opportunities for people of average means to invest and speculate in stocks. The BLS {{reported that}} stock traders had median annual incomes of $68,500.

2500|$|Scripophily is {{the study}} and {{collection}} <b>of</b> <b>stocks</b> <b>and</b> Bonds. It {{is an area of}} collecting due to both the inherent beauty of some historical documents as well as the interesting historical context of each document.

2500|$|While {{accountants}} often discuss inventory {{in terms}} of goods for sale, organizations - [...] manufacturers, service-providers and not-for-profits - [...] also have inventories (fixtures, furniture, supplies, etc.) {{that they do not}} intend to sell. Manufacturers', distributors', and wholesalers' inventory tends to cluster in warehouses. Retailers' inventory may exist in a warehouse or in a shop or store accessible to customers. Inventories not intended for sale to customers or to clients may be held in any premises an organization uses. [...] Stock ties up cash and, if uncontrolled, it will be impossible to know the actual level <b>of</b> <b>stocks</b> <b>and</b> therefore impossible to control them.|$|E
2500|$|Expenses {{that are}} likely to produce future {{benefits}} must be capitalized. [...] The capitalized costs are then deductible as depreciation (see MACRS) or amortization over the period future benefits are expected. [...] Examples include costs of machinery and equipment and costs of making or building property. [...] IRS tables specify lives of assets by class of asset or industry in which used. [...] When an asset the cost of which was capitalized is sold, exchanged, or abandoned, the proceeds (if any) are reduced by the remaining unrecovered cost to determine gain or loss. [...] The gain or loss may be ordinary (as in the case of inventory) or capital (as in the case <b>of</b> <b>stocks</b> <b>and</b> bonds), or a combination (for some buildings and equipment).|$|E

2500|$|A self-described, [...] "Reagan supply-sider", Kudlow opposes estate taxes, {{as well as}} {{taxes on}} {{dividends}} and capital gains. He also advocates that employees be compelled to make greater contributions to their pension and medical costs, suggesting that these expenses are an undue burden on businesses and defends high executive compensation {{as a manifestation of}} market forces and opposes most forms of government regulation. In general, he describes himself as a supply-side economist, arguing that reducing tax rates will encourage economic growth and ultimately increase tax revenue. He has often argued that economic growth will clear deficits, while acknowledging the limits of growth. He has also advocated wide ownership <b>of</b> <b>stocks</b> <b>and</b> frequently speaks of a broad [...] "investor class" [...] that includes most Americans. He is a harsh critic of corporate corruption that has characterized the Enron and Worldcom scandals.|$|E
2500|$|In 1854 Philadelphia {{increased}} its tax base by expanding its borders {{to include the}} surrounding suburbs, and after the Civil War its population swelled. By 1870 the Centennial Exposition was upcoming, and Philadelphia was rapidly changing. It was suffering from a water crisis because it required more water, {{but there was no}} appropriate method for water purification and the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers were heavily polluted. Philadelphia's typhoid fever rate was {{among the highest in the}} nation, and most well-to-do families drank bottled spring water. The Wharton family's [...] "Bellevue" [...] estate, along with several others nearby that had been annexed into the city, was threatened with condemnation by the city for the construction of a new reservoir to hold potable water. Wharton saw a potential solution to both of these problems. He started purchasing land in southern New Jersey in the 1870s, eventually acquiring [...] in the Pinelands which contained an aquifer replenished by several rivers and lakes. The water from the Pinelands was relatively pure and he planned to export the water to Philadelphia. Wharton suggested that a city-controlled company could develop the necessary water mains and pump, funded by public purchase <b>of</b> <b>stocks</b> <b>and</b> bonds. There was opposition to the plan by others in Philadelphia and in New Jersey, and eventually a law was passed in New Jersey preventing the export of water. The Wharton Bellevue estate was taken by the city, but the planned reservoir was never constructed, because of local politics and also because by 1890 water could be purified by filtration, obviating the need for an extra reservoir. Instead the estate was sold to developers for construction of new housing for the newly organized industry nearby in North Philadelphia.|$|E

Garton, due back in London on the morrow, departed at midday with an ironical smile which left a scar of irritation--healed the moment his loping figure vanished {{round the corner}} of the steep lane.
