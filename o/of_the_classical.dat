5|$|A {{cladistic}} {{study of}} the skeletal and bone morphology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>classical</b> Pelecaniformes and relatives found that the frigatebirds formed a clade with Limnofregata. Birds of the two genera have 15 cervical vertebrae, unlike almost all other Ciconiiformes, Suliformes and Pelecaniformes, which have 17. The age of Limnofregata indicates that these lineages had separated by the Eocene.|$|E
5|$|During the 600 {{years of}} the European Middle Ages from 600 to 1200, the {{tradition}} of herbal lore fell to the monasteries.

5|$|The {{greatest}} drawback <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>classical</b> Fourier {{transformation is}} a rather narrow class of functions (originals) for which it can be effectively computed.

For example, the Fourier transform of such simple functions as polynomials does not exist in the classical sense. The extension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>classical</b> Fourier transformation to distributions considerably enlarged the class of functions that could be transformed and this removed many obstacles.|$|E

5|$|Although {{above the}} horizon and hence visible to the Ancient Greeks, Antlia's stars were too faint to have been {{included}} in any ancient constellations. The stars that now comprise Antlia lay within an area of the sky covered by the ancient constellation Argo Navis, the Ship of the Argonauts, which due to its immense size was split into several smaller constellations by Lacaille in 1763. Ridpath reports that due to their faintness, the stars of Antlia did not make up part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>classical</b> depiction of Argo Navis.|$|E
5|$|Angkor Wat is {{the prime}} example <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>classical</b> style of Khmer architecture—the Angkor Wat style—to which it has given its name.

Most of the visible areas are of sandstone blocks, while laterite was used for the outer wall and for hidden structural parts. The binding agent used to join the blocks is yet to be identified, although natural resins or slaked lime has been suggested.|$|E

5|$|During the Hellenistic period, mythology {{took on the}} {{prestige}} of elite knowledge that marks its possessors as belonging to a certain class. At the same time, the skeptical turn <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Classical</b> age became even more pronounced. Greek mythographer Euhemerus established the tradition of seeking an actual historical basis for mythical beings and events. Although his original work (Sacred Scriptures) is lost, much is known about it from what is recorded by Diodorus and Lactantius.|$|E
5|$|Evolution of the {{adaptive}} immune system occurred in an ancestor of the jawed vertebrates. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>classical</b> molecules of {{the adaptive}} immune system (e.g., immunoglobulins and T-cell receptors) exist only in jawed vertebrates. However, a distinct lymphocyte-derived molecule has been discovered in primitive jawless vertebrates, such as the lamprey and hagfish. These animals possess a large array of molecules called Variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs) that, like the antigen receptors of jawed vertebrates, are produced from {{only a small number}} (one or two) of genes. These molecules are believed to bind pathogenic antigens in a similar way to antibodies, and with the same degree of specificity.|$|E
