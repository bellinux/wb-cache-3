Typically, the patient is misdiagnosed at least once and accordingly receives some treatments that are at best useless; this usually causes further complications, but—as {{the nature of the}} complications often provides valuable new evidence—eventually these help them diagnose the patient correctly. House often tends to arrive at the correct diagnosis seemingly out of the blue, often inspired by a passing remark made by another character. Diagnoses range from relatively common to very rare diseases.|$|E

25|$|At a January 1942 meeting, {{a report}} {{by two of the}} {{consultants}} was analyzed. The report made suggestions as to personnel, exercise, provisions, including food, alcohol and tobacco, ventilation, and sanitation. If <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> members died, it was recommended that their remains be embalmed and cemented. Those at the meeting decided that the Operation Tracer team should have six members: an officer who would serve as leader of the team, two doctors, and three telegraphists. It was proposed that a rehearsal be conducted to evaluate the psychological suitability of the proposed team members. It was suggested that the rehearsal take place in Scotland. At a meeting held the following month, in February 1942, it was recommended that Lieutenant White of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve be interviewed. It was proposed that once the Tracer team was chosen, a second team be organised, and observations posts at other places such as Aden and Malta be considered.|$|E

25|$|Playing a full 82 {{games in}} 2003–04, Smyth tallied 59 points (23 goals and 36 assists) {{to lead the}} Oilers in scoring for the second {{straight}} year. Due to the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Smyth spent the season inactive. As NHL play resumed the next year, he approached career-high totals with 36 goals and 66 points. With several young players emerging on the team's roster, Smyth ranked fourth in team scoring, behind Aleš Hemský, Shawn Horcoff and Jarret Stoll. His 19 power play goals came within <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> record he previously set in his second year with the Oilers. Although Edmonton entered the 2006 playoffs as the eighth and final seed in the Western Conference, Smyth helped the team on a run to the Stanley Cup Finals with 16 points in 24 post-season games. During the second round against the San Jose Sharks, he was hit in the mouth with a puck {{as a result of a}} clearing attempt from defensive teammate Chris Pronger. After losing three teeth and needing stitches, Smyth returned in the third period and went on to set up Shawn Horcoff's game-winning goal in triple-overtime. The win reduced San Jose's series lead to 2–1, helping the Oilers eventually advance to the Conference Finals in six games. After eliminating the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in the third round, the Oilers were ultimately defeated in seven games by the Carolina Hurricanes in the Finals.|$|E
