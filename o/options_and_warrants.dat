Readministration of chemotherapeutic agents by hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) has the rationale of providing higher concentrations of chemotherapeutic agents to hepatic metastases. The present {{study was conducted to}} evaluate the efficacy and safety of HAI of fluorouracil with leucovorin (HAI 5 -FU/LV) {{for patients with}} liver metastases from CRC. Methods: Fourteen patients with liver metastases from CRC who received HAI 5 -FU/LV after failure of systemic chemotherapy containing fluorouracil and leucovorin were identified and their medical records were reviewed. Results: Of 10 patients evaluable for response, one partial response, six stable disease, and three progressive disease were reported. Additionally, the overall response and disease control rates were 7 % and 50 %, respectively. The median time to progression was 4. 3 months (range, 2. 9 to 5. 6), to hepatic progression was 5. 8 months (range, 4. 7 to 6. 9), and to extrahepatic progression was 5. 8 months (range, 2. 3 to 9. 2).

40|$|Traditionally, options {{have been}} the {{preferred}} derivative in Western markets, whereas in Hong Kong and much of Asia, warrants are preferred over options as hedging vehicles. Empirical {{studies have shown that}} the pricing of warrants differs from that of options. These studies examined the value of warrants without determining the underlying process implied by actual warrant prices. Moreover, most research focuses on developed markets like the US or Japan, or on inferring the price of warrants from options prices. This research set out to examine the asset pricing processes underlying exchange-listed options and structured warrants on the Hang Seng Index (HSI). It also aims to examine the effect of warrant-issuers’ credit ratings on pricing differences between HSI Options (HSIO) and HSI Warrants (HSIW). The study addresses several research questions: “Are both continuous and jump components present in the asset pricing processes of HSIO and HSIW?” and “If so, do these components interact over time?”; “Are there differences between the asset pricing processes of HSIO and HSIW?”; “Does the price of HSIW depend on the warrant-issuer?” and “Do issuers’ credit ratings have any effect on the different pricing between HSIO and HSIW?” Hypotheses were developed to investigate these questions. To address the research questions and hypotheses, this study adopts: (a) Carr and Wu’s (2003 b) method of identifying the presence of jump and continuous components in the asset pricing; and (b) Chan and Pinder’s (2000) applied regression analysis test. This test was used to find evidence of different pricing between <b>options</b> <b>and</b> <b>warrants</b> in the Australian market. This research uses data in the Hong Kong market with a sample period from 2009 to 2013. Carr and Wu’s (2003 b) method, was used to create term decay plots for HSIO and HSIW to determine the components in the asset pricing processes of these securities. Then, Chan and Pinder’s (2000) regression analysis method was used to investigate differences in pricing between HSIO and HSIW, and the effect of warrant-issuers’ credit risk on HSIW pricing. To the best of the researcher’s knowledge, this research is the first to determine the process underlying HSIO and HSIW prices by examining the term decay plots of these securities in the Hong Kong market. It contributes to the literature by examining not only a different market but also a different financial product. It therefore extends prior research by enabling the comparison of findings in two different markets and products. Evidence was found (a) of a continuous component and a weak jump component in the asset pricing process of HSIO, broadly consistent with Carr and Wu’s (2003 b) findings for S&P 500 put options on the NYSE, (b) of a purely jump component in the asset pricing process for HSIW, (c) that characteristics of warrantissuers are associated with relative pricing differences between HSIO and HSIW, and (d) that one of these characteristics is the credit risk of the warrant-issuer. Future research could seek to establish a means of investigating further the pricing processes underlying the HSIW. Ideally the methodology would incorporate the role of credit risk, as this study has shown it is a significant factor in HSIW price behaviour. Given the scarcity of literature on structured warrants, this research can help warrantissuers adopt better hedging techniques to reduce risk when issuing warrants. This study potentially assists investors to improve their use of warrants as hedging, arbitraging, investing and speculative vehicles. It is hoped that the findings will expand researchers’ understanding of the components in the asset pricing process of <b>options</b> <b>and</b> <b>warrants.</b> It is also hoped that the thesis will provide insight into the different pricing between <b>options</b> <b>and</b> <b>warrants</b> due to different components in the underlying processes...|$|E

This shows insufficient implementation of the share price drops into options valuation models of options dealers or investors / speculators. Further an impact of unexpected share price behavior was analyzed but no particular pattern has been identified. The impact of the unexpected share price drop (either too high or too low) has ambiguous implications on the options prices.

40|$|Parkinson's {{disease is}} a {{neurodegenerative}} disease that causes the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. The resulting dopamine deficiency in the basal ganglia leads to a movement disorder that is characterized by classical parkinsonian motor symptoms. Parkinson's disease is recognized as the most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's disease. PD ethiopathogenesis remains to be elucidated and has been connected to genetic, environmental and immunologic conditions. The past decade has provided evidence for a significant role {{of the immune system}} in PD pathogenesis, either through inflammation or an autoimmune response. Several autoantibodies directed at antigens associated with PD pathogenesis have been identified in PD patients. This immune activation may be the cause of, rather than a response to, the observed neuronal loss. Parkinsonian motor symptoms include bradykinesia, muscular rigidity and resting tremor. The non-motor features include olfactory dysfunction, cognitive impairment, psychiatric symptoms and autonomic dysfunction. Microscopically, the specific degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and the presence of Lewy bodies, which are brain deposits containing a substantial amount of α-synuclein, have been recognized. The progression of Parkinson's disease is characterized by a worsening of motor features; however, as the disease progresses, there is an emergence of complications related to long-term symptomatic treatment. The available therapies for Parkinson's disease only treat the symptoms of the disease. A major goal of Parkinson's disease research is the development of disease-modifying drugs that slow or stop the neurodegenerative process. Drugs that enhance the intracerebral dopamine concentrations or stimulate dopamine receptors remain the mainstay treatment for motor symptoms.

40|$|We {{propose a}} general {{framework}} {{to assess the}} value of the financial claims issued by the firm, European equity options and warrantsin terms of the stock price. In our framework, the firm's asset is assumed to follow a standard stationary lognormal process with constant volatility. However, it is not the case for equity volatility. The stochastic nature of equity volatility is endogenous, and comes from the impact of a change in {{the value of the}} firm's assets on the financial leverage. In a previous paper we studied the stochastic process for equity volatility, and proposed analytic approximations for different capital structures. In this companion paper we derive analytic approximations for the value of European equity <b>options</b> <b>and</b> <b>warrants</b> for a firm financed by equity, debt and warrants. We first present the basic model, which is an extension of the Black-Scholes model, to value corporate securities either as a function of the stock price, or as a function of the firm's total assets. Since stock prices are observable, then for practical purposes, traders prefer to use the stock as the underlying instrument, we concentrate on valuation models in terms of the stock price. Second, we derive an exact solution for the valuation in terms of the stock price of (i) a European call option on the stock of a levered firm, i. e. a European compound call option on the total assets of the firm, (ii) an equity warrant for an all-equity firm, and (iii) an equity warrant for a firm financed by equity and debt. Unfortunately, to compute these solutions we need to specify the function of the stock price in terms of the firm's assets value. In general we are unable to specify this expression, but we propose tight bounds for the value of these options which can be easily computed as a function of the stock price. Our results provide useful extensions of the Black-Scholes model. corporate finance, financial structure, leverage effect, option pricing, security valuation, stochastic volatility, warrants, numerical methods,...|$|E
