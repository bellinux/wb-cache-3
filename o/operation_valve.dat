40|$|An {{operation}} on the beating heart was planned for a 60 -year-old woman who applied to our clinic with aortic stenosis, three vessel {{coronary artery disease}} and poor left ventricular function. There are reports about beating heart valve surgery perfomed alone or combined with coronary artery bypass operations using continuous retrograde coronary sinus isothermic blood perfusion in patients with poor ventricle. We performed a coronary revascularization process for three-vessel disease on the pump beating heart and aortic valve replacement under cross-clamp using continuous retrograde coronary sinus isothermic blood perfusion in the same session. She was discharged on the sixth postoperative day after an uneventful recovery. She is well and active 24 months after the <b>operation.</b> <b>Valve</b> replacement using the retrograde coronary sinus isothermic blood perfusion technique due to its protective effect on the already borderline myocardial functions in patients with poor ventricles is a useful and clinically successful method...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Paravalvular jets, {{documented}} by intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography, have prompted immediate valve explantation by others, yet {{the significance of}} these jets is unknown. METHODS: Twenty-seven patients had intraoperative transesophageal two-dimensional color Doppler echocardiography, performed to assess the number and area of regurgitant jets after valve replacement, before and after protamine. Patients were grouped by first time versus redo <b>operation,</b> <b>valve</b> position and type. RESULTS: Before protamine, 55 jets were identified (2. 04 +/- 1. 4 per patient) versus 29 jets after (1. 07 +/- 1. 2 per patient, p = 0. 0002). Total jet area improved from 2. 0 +/- 2. 2 cm 2 to 0. 86 +/- 1. 7 cm 2 with protamine (p 0. 6). Furthermore, mitral and mechanical valves each had more jets and overall greater jet area when compared to aortic and tissue valves, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Following valve replacement, multiple jets are detected by intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography. They are more common and larger in the mitral position and with mechanical valves. Improvement occurs with reversal of anticoagulation...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Elsevier via the DOI in this record. Optimisation of the operation of water distribution systems has been an active research field for almost half a century. It has focused mainly on optimal pump operation to minimise pumping costs and optimal water quality management to ensure that standards at customer nodes are met. This paper provides a systematic review by bringing together over two hundred publications from the past three decades, which are relevant to operational optimisation of water distribution systems, particularly optimal pump <b>operation,</b> <b>valve</b> control and system operation for water quality purposes of both urban drinking and regional multiquality water distribution systems. Uniquely, it also contains substantial and thorough information for over one hundred publications in a tabular form, which lists optimisation models inclusive of objectives, constraints, decision variables, solution methodologies used and other details. Research challenges in terms of simulation models, optimisation model formulation, selection of optimisation method and postprocessing needs have also been identified...|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectives: The interrelationships among {{coronary}} and valvular operations, microemboli, and neurobehavioral outcome are unclear. We {{hypothesized that}} adult patients undergoing cardiac <b>valve</b> <b>operations</b> {{would have more}} total emboli delivered to the brain than patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting and that this would associate with worse neurobehavioral outcomes. Methods: One hundred ninety-three patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting and 73 patients undergoing cardiac <b>valve</b> <b>operations</b> were compared. Patients received neurologic, neuro-ophthalmologic, and 11 standardized neurobehavioral tests preoperatively and 5 to 7 days, 1 month, and 6 months postoperatively. Left common carotid Doppler ultrasonographic embolus detection was performed intraoperatively. Repeated measures and logistic regression analyses of outcome were performed. Results: Patients undergoing either coronary or <b>valve</b> <b>operations</b> were well matched by age (61 ± 10 and 59 ± 12 years, respectively), but a significantly greater fraction of patients undergoing <b>valve</b> <b>operations</b> were female, diabetic, or had undergone previous cardiac operations. Neurobehavioral scores of patients undergoing either coronary artery bypass grafting or cardiac <b>valve</b> <b>operations</b> {{did not differ significantly}} at any time. Total embolus counts differed significantly: the median was 105 during coronary artery bypass grafting and 479 during cardiac <b>valve</b> <b>operations</b> (geometric means of 104 and 412, respectively; P =. 0001). Significantly more emboli were detected in the patients undergoing cardiac <b>valve</b> <b>operations</b> after removal of the left ventricular vent and after separation from cardiopulmonary bypass, but comparable numbers of emboli were seen in the 2 groups before cardiopulmonary bypass. In both groups decreased neurobehavioral performance was apparent at 5 to 7 days, with improvement at 1 and 6 months. Increasing numbers of carotid emboli significantly associated with worse performance on the letter cancellation test. There {{were no significant differences between}} patients undergoing <b>valve</b> and coronary <b>operations</b> in neurobehavioral outcomes, strokes, transient ischemic attacks, or deaths. Conclusions: The significantly greater number of emboli in the group of patients undergoing cardiac <b>valve</b> <b>operations</b> is likely the result of the entrainment of intracardiac air. The greater numbers of emboli during cardiac <b>valve</b> <b>operations</b> do not appear associated with a commensurately greater risk of adverse neurologic or neurobehavioral outcome.

40|$|Implantation of cryopreserved human {{donor heart}} valves for either {{congenital}} or acquired cardiac disease has been performed {{since the last}} three decades. Although the clinical outcome is good, long-term valve degeneration resulting in dysfunction has been observed. A specific immunological response of the recipient against the allograft has been proposed {{as one of the}} factors involved in this process. Helper T lymphocytes play an important intermediate role in cellular and humoral immune response. Increasing numbers of circulating donor-specific helper T lymphocytes precursors (HTLp) correlate with graft rejection after organ transplantation. To investigate whether cryopreserved human donor heart valves are able to induce a donor-specific T helper response, we monitored the HTLp frequencies (HTLpf) in peripheral blood samples of 13 patients after valve allograft transplantation by use of a limiting dilution assay followed by an interleukin- 2 bioassay. Prior to transplantation, HTLpf specific for donor and third-party antigens showed individual baseline levels. After allografting, the antidonor frequencies significantly increased in 11 of the 13 patients (P = 0 · 02). This was not found for stimulation with third-party spleen cells (P = 0 · 68), which indicates a donor-specific response. Maximal donor-specific HTLpf were already found at 1 – 2 months after <b>operation.</b> <b>Valve</b> allograft transplantation induces an increase in the numbers of donor-specific HTLp in peripheral blood of the patients. Analogous to organ transplantation, these HTLp may {{play a crucial role in}} events that lead to valve damage. Therefore, monitoring of HTLp in peripheral blood samples might be informative for donor valve degeneration (rejection) and subsequently valve allograft failure...|$|E

40|$|The {{pressure}} relief valve is a basic component in every hydraulic system. Its function is to limit maximal pressure in the system independently of the flow across the valve.

40|$|The water {{distribution}} regulation system of Fukuoka City {{is a system}} in which motor valves are operated by remote control while pressure gauges and flow meters attached to distribution pipes are monitored. One of the main objectives of this system is to regulate pressure in all the network nodes between lower and upper target values. With the ever-increasing complexity of the city-wide distribution pipe network, motor <b>valve</b> <b>operations</b> to regulate pressure and flow came to depend more and more on the experience and skills of operators. For this reason, an improvement of <b>valve</b> <b>operations</b> support should be done based on <b>valve</b> <b>operation</b> planning for flow and pressure regulation and the operation knowledge database which is constructed on the basis of past experience in order to prevent the events of pressure regulation falls outside the required target pressure range and also to reduce the effort of operators.
