50|$|The Crompton Loom {{evolved from}} {{multiple}} acquisitions of patents throughout the 1850s and 1860s. Furbush and Crompton held multiple other patents that improved the “narrow looms”, such as double reverse motion improvements. James Greenhalgh patented the first <b>open-shed</b> loom in 1852, but in 1857 the patent {{was found to}} be too close to William Crompton’s power fancy loom, and therefore the Greenhalgh Loom patent was disallowed. William Crompton’s patent expired the next year, and when it did, Crompton and Furbush purchased the rights to the Greenhalgh Loom, improved it in several ways, and called it the Crompton Loom. This 1857 version of the loom would improve again, however, until it became {{one of the best in}} the world at the Paris Exhibition in 1867, and later would become the standard fancy cotton loom of the United States (around 1870).|$|E
40|$|Twenty one Holstein Friesian and Brown Swiss female calves, at 6 - 12 {{months of}} ages {{were used in}} this study. They were kept in <b>open-shed</b> barn at 10 ?C ambient {{temperature}} and 50 % relative humidity conditions during December. Then, in January the animals were kept in stall barn at 15 ?C ambient temperature and 75 % relative humidity. In each barn, blood samples {{were taken from the}} animals on three consecutive days at the end of both December and January and analyzed for serum sodium, potassium, PCV %, hemoglobin and erythrocyte values. Except for erythrocyte counts, all blood parameters are affected by types of barn, however breed factor was found significant for only erythrocyte count. Serum potassium levels were changed by the age of animals. Some interactions between factors were found to be significant...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Three light sources: Cool-White (C), Vita-Lite (V), and {{tungsten}} (T), each at two intensities (20 or 50 lx), {{were used}} to supplement light to 16 hr in a 24 -hr cycle for geese main-tained in <b>open-shed</b> pens. Two lines of mixed breeds of geese, white and grey, were used and egg production was followed from the 27 th week of age through 6 months of the laying period, A significant increase in egg production was found under the C light illumination. At 20 lx, egg production {{was significantly higher than}} at 50 lx. No difference in egg production was found between the two lines of geese; however, significant interactions were found between light sources, intensities, and geese lines, as exhibited by different patterns of egg production. Light intensity had the greatest effect until peak egg production had been reached; thereafter, egg production was influenced mainly by the light source. (Key words: light quality, light intensity, egg production, geese...|$|E
40|$|Influences of {{pericardium}} and actue myocardial ischemia on pulmonary venous flow (PVF) {{dynamics and}} left atrial (LA) function were studied in 13 anestietized <b>open-shest</b> dogs. PVF velcity {{was measured by}} Dopperl flow probe instataneously with LA diameter, left ventricular (LV) segment lengths in control and ischemic regions using ultrasonic dimension gauges. LA and LV pressures were also measured simultaeously with PVF velocity using Miller's micromanometers. Recordings were made at control state and during actue myocardial ischmia produced by occlusion of the left circumflex coronary artery, with or without pericardium. When the pericardium was opened, the peak velocity of PVF deuring LA contraction (A wave) was increased (28. 9 → 42. 2 cm/sec, p＜ 0. 01) in proportion as LV chamber compliance increaed. Moreover, opening the pericardium, the velocity-time integral of PVF in the systolic phases(S wave) was invreased (12. 6 → 14. 2 cm, p＜ 0. 05), associated with the sift of LA pressure-volume relation to the right. These findings suggested that LV compliance was one of important determinants of the A wave, and {{that the increase in}} the S wace (increase in the reservoir function of LA) by opening the pericardium might be attributed to the increase in LA chamber compliance. After actue myocardial ischemia, PVF I the diastolic phase (D wave) was decreased (12. 3 → 9. 8 cm, p＜ 0. 01), whereas S wace remained unchanged owing to the aufmentation of LA pump function under the myocardial ischemia. In addition, the D wave was significantly correlated with the time constant of LV pressure decline during the isocolumetric relaxation period (r＝- 0. 535, p＜ 0. 01). These results indicate that LV and LA compliances altered by the existence of pericardium play an important role for determining A and S wave on PVF, and also LV diastolic property might be an important determinant of D wave on PVF...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{was to determine whether}} refractoriness to short and long days were involved in the end and onset of the breeding season, respectively, in goats adapted to subtropical latitudes. Ovariectomized does given a subcutaneous implant constantly releasing estradiol- 17 beta (OVX+E) were used in two experiments. Plasma LH concentrations were determined twice weekly. In Experiment 1, the control group remained in an <b>open-shed</b> pen (natural day length and ambient temperature). Two experimental groups were placed in light-proof buildings (with natural temperature variations). One group was exposed to natural simulated increasing days (winter to spring), whereas the other was exposed to a winter solstice photoperiod (10 h of light) from December 21 to April 28. In Experiment 2, the control group remained under natural day length and ambient temperature. One experimental group was exposed to natural simulated decreasing days (summer to autumn), whereas the other group was exposed to a summer solstice photoperiod (14 h of light) from June 21 to October 20. In Experiment 1, the breeding season was not prolonged in does maintained in the winter solstice day length. Mean dates of decrease in LH secretion (end of the breeding season) did not differ significantly between does exposed to natural (February 3 +/- 5 d) or natural simulated photoperiod (January 26 +/- 14 d) and those exposed to constant short days of winter solstice (February 4 +/- 10 d). In Experiment 2, the onset of the breeding season was not delayed in does maintained in the summer solstice day length. Mean dates of increase in LH secretion (onset of the breeding season) did not differ significantly between does exposed to natural (September 7 +/- 8 d) or natural simulated photoperiod (September 18 +/- 10 d) and those exposed to constant long days photoperiod of summer solstice (September 24 +/- 4 d). In goats adapted to a subtropical environment, we concluded that: I) the end of breeding season was due to refractoriness to short days, and not the inhibitory effect of increasing day length; and 2) the onset of the breeding season was due to refractoriness to long days, and not a stimulatory effect of decreasing day length...|$|E
