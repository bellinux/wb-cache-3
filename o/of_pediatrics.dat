5|$|Further {{evidence}} of the scientific consensus includes the rejection of a causal link between thiomersal and autism by multiple national and international scientific and medical bodies including the American Medical Association, the American Academy <b>of</b> <b>Pediatrics,</b> the American College of Medical Toxicology, the Canadian Paediatric Society, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, the Food and Drug Administration, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization, the Public Health Agency of Canada, and the European Medicines Agency.|$|E
5|$|The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization {{state that}} a {{blood lead level}} of 10μg/dL or above is a cause for concern; however, lead may impair {{development}} and have harmful health effects even at lower levels, {{and there is no}} known safe exposure level. Authorities such as the American Academy <b>of</b> <b>Pediatrics</b> define lead poisoning as blood lead levels higher than 10μg/dL.|$|E
5|$|Some experts {{argue that}} exposing {{children}} to television {{at such an}} early age is taking technology too far or that parents are using BabyFirst as a digital babysitter. Parents in-turn refute that argument, claiming that experts have lost touch {{with the realities of}} raising a child. BabyFirst suggests the programming is intended to be watched by parents and their children together in an interactive way. The American Academy <b>of</b> <b>Pediatrics</b> recommends against exposing {{children under the age of}} two to television, while a 2003 study by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that most children under two years of age are already watching TV. According to The Washington Post, very little is known about whether young children watching television has a negative or positive effect on them.|$|E

5|$|The most {{effective}} methods {{are those that}} are long acting and do not require ongoing health care visits. Surgical sterilization, implantable hormones, and intrauterine devices all have first-year failure rates of less than 1%. Hormonal contraceptive pills, patches or vaginal rings, and the lactational amenorrhea method (LAM), if used strictly, can also have first-year (or for LAM, first-6-month) failure rates of less than 1%. With typical use first-year failure rates are considerably high, at 9%, due to incorrect usage. Other methods such as condoms, diaphragms, and spermicides have higher first-year failure rates even with perfect usage. The American Academy <b>of</b> <b>Pediatrics</b> recommends long acting reversible birth control as first line for young people.|$|E
5|$|Thiomersal (also spelled thimerosal, {{especially}} in the United States) is an organomercury compound used as a preservative in vaccines since the 1930s to prevent bacterial and fungal contamination. Following a mandated review of mercury-containing food and drugs in 1999, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Academy <b>of</b> <b>Pediatrics</b> (AAP) asked vaccine makers to remove thiomersal from vaccines {{as quickly as possible}} as a precautionary measure, and it was rapidly phased out of most U.S. and European vaccines. It is still used in all multi-dose vials of flu vaccines in the U.S. In the context of perceived increased autism rates and increased number of vaccines in the childhood vaccination schedule, some parents believed the action to remove thiomersal was an indication that the preservative caused autism.|$|E
5|$|After {{reporting}} {{appearances of}} a tall woman in black who vanishes, and her teacher recommending {{that she was not}} herself, her mother took her to a physician. As a result, only two weeks before her death she was diagnosed with acute lymphatic leukemia and hospitalized at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Lafayette, Louisiana. At the request of her family, she was informed by the hospital chaplain, Joseph Brennan, a newly ordained Catholic priest, {{that she was going to}} die. Though the illness was painful, she remained cheerful, meekly accepted her fate, and offered up her suffering to God. Brennan was deeply impressed by her faith and visited her daily. While dying, Richard prayed for other individuals to be healed or to be converted to Catholicism. The Director <b>of</b> <b>Pediatrics</b> at the hospital, Theresita Crowley, a nun, also witnessed her calm acceptance of suffering and prayers for others. Brennan and Crowley claimed that those for whom Richard prayed recovered from their illnesses or became Catholic. Richard died on 11 August 1959.|$|E
