Chemometric {{evaluation}} of the colour and smoke aroma in <b>oriental</b> <b>tobaccos</b> based on the polyphenol and valeric acid characteristics as influenced by the genotype. Bulg. J. Agric. Sci., 13 : 459 - 466 The influence of polyphenols and valeric acids of Oriental tobacco cultivars on the colour of dry tobacco and the aroma of tobacco smoke was studied by applying a chemometric approach. A group of Djebel basma genotypes and a local cultivar Djebel 576 used as a standard {{were involved in the}} study. To obtain primary data on the polyphenol pattern related to colour estimation high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used, whereas capillary gas chromatography (CGC) was applied to get information on valeric acid content, related to aroma characteristics. Regression models involving the polyphenol data and the isovaleric acid content were used for colour and aroma estimation, respectively. The HPLC data were processed by means of pattern recognition method (PRM) and the similarity indexes (Is, %) between the selection lines, as well as between them and the standard, were calculated. It was established that all cultivars are distinct from the standard in the polyphenol pattern. The data obtained for the <b>Oriental</b> <b>tobaccos</b> studied point that the colour of dry tobacco and the aroma of tobacco smoke are determined by the genotype-specific composition of the polyphenol complex and of the valeric acids, varying in the different cultivars.

40|$|AbstractThe Tobacco Heating System (THS 2. 2), {{which uses}} “heat-not-burn” technology, generates an aerosol from tobacco heated {{to a lower}} {{temperature}} than occurs when smoking a combustible cigarette. The concentrations of harmful and potentially harmful constituents (HPHCs) are significantly lower in THS 2. 2 mainstream aerosol than in smoke produced by combustible cigarettes. Different tobacco types and 43 tobacco blends were investigated {{to determine how the}} blend impacted the overall reductions of HPHCs in the THS 2. 2 mainstream aerosol. The blend composition had minimal effects on the yields of most HPHCs in the aerosol. Blends containing high proportions of nitrogen-rich tobacco, e. g., air-cured, and some <b>Oriental</b> <b>tobaccos,</b> produced higher acetamide, acrylamide, ammonia, and nitrogen oxide yields than did other blends. Most HPHCs were found to be released mainly through the distillation of HPHCs present in the tobacco plug or after being produced in simple thermal reactions. HPHC concentrations in the THS 2. 2 aerosol may therefore be further minimized by limiting the use of flue- and fire-cured tobaccos which may be contaminated by HPHCs during the curing process and carefully selecting nitrogen rich tobaccos with low concentrations of endogenous HPHCs for use in the tobacco plug blend...|$|E

Tobacco leaves had higher photosynthetic rates and many differences among genotypes in the early stage of plant vigorous growth compared with more mature leaves. However, transpiration rates were lower in the younger leaves and greater in the more mature leaves. All the entries had four common bands (B 1, B 3, B 4 and B 6) of the esterase isoenzymes.

40|$|The {{results of}} our {{experiments}} executed to obtain tobacco male sterile lines through interspecific hybridization are summarized. Ten wild species from the genus Nicotiana: N. excelsior (exc), N. amplexicaulis (amp), N. rustica (rus), Nicotianaglauca (gla), N. velutina (vel), N. benthamiana (ben), N. maritima (mar), N. paniculata (pan), N. longiflora (lon) and N. africana (afr) were used as cytoplasmic donors and N. tabacum, cv. HarmanliiskaBasma (HB) as a donor of the nucleus. Genetic effects of cytoplasmic-nuclear interaction of the studied species are discussed. Our results suggested that cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) was expressed when the cytoplasms of the above mentioned wild Nicotiana species were combined with the nucleus of N. tabacum. The 10 sources of CMS obtained in tobacco were characterized by altered flower phenotypes. Flowers are classified into types according the stamen, pistil and corolla modification. All these CMS sources were backcrossed to <b>Oriental</b> <b>tobaccos,</b> cvs. Tekne, Nevrokop B- 12, Kroumovgrad 90 and Djebel 576, to develop corresponding CMS lines. The investigated cytoplasms produced compete male sterility in all those cultivars. The CMS lines preserved flower types, specific for every “sterile” cytoplasm. The extent of male organ modifications varied from apparently normal (but pollenless) stamens in CMS (pan), (afr), some plants of (vel) (mar) through different degrees of malformations (shriveled anther on shortened filaments (lon), pinnate-like anthers on filaments of normal length (amp), petal - (ben), pistil- or stigma-like structures (rus), (gla)) to lack of male reproductive organs in (exc) and in some plants of (vel), (mar), (rus) and (gla). Most of the above mentioned cytoplasms had normal female gametophyte and good seed productivity. Alterations of the pistils were observed in CMS (rus), (exc) and (ben) causing reduction of the seed set.

The high value of exported tobacco and other tobacco products is regularly above 100 million USD (113 million USD for 2006 and 106 million USD for 2007). As a family production with low grade of mechanized labor processes, it provides survival of more than 100 000 residents of Macedonia.

Natural resources for <b>oriental</b> <b>tobacco</b> production are relatively adequate for the most of the countries from Mediterranean region as well as Balkan Peninsula. However, the specific climate and soil conditions in Macedonia have a high comparative value for <b>oriental</b> <b>tobacco.</b> They enabled the tobacco to have definite value above all other crops from Macedonia, especially in areas limited with water resources and soil with low percentage of humus. High level of tobacco production in the previous period has resulted with building of many huge industrial capacities, warehouses for final processing as well as three factories for cigarette production. They have been all build for the great domestic market (for over twenty million people of Former Yugoslav Republic) and partly for export. Nowadays, these capacities insufficiently are used with annual production of over 5, 500 t of cigarettes. Because of inadequate agrarian policy, tobacco production stagnates in the period of long transition and shows a high instability through the years. Therefore, the advantages of Macedonian region remain inadequately used.
