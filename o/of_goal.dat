At their new home, Ipswich {{became one of}} the first clubs to {{implement}} the use <b>of</b> <b>goal</b> nets, in 1890, but the more substantial elements of ground development did not begin until, in 1901, a tobacco processing plant was built along the south edge of the ground.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being the}} better {{team for the}} {{majority}} of the match, Liverpool were unable to beat the Independiente defence, with their shooting in front <b>of</b> <b>goal</b> being the culprit. Both sides questioned some of the referee's decisions. Liverpool believed they should have had two penalties, while Independiente felt that the assistant referee's decisions were questionable. Incidentally, the referee had served half of his two match ban handed out by the Brazilian Football Association.|$|E
5|$|Outside of his {{association}} with the Bruins, Ross also helped to improve the game. He created a style of hockey puck still used today, and advocated an improved style <b>of</b> <b>goal</b> nets, a change that lasted forty years.

5|$|Plymouth Argyle {{came close}} to making their opponents pay for their profligacy in front <b>of</b> <b>goal</b> with Evans lifting a volley over the crossbar. Darlington's captain Andy Crosby was {{proving to be a}} {{formidable}} figure at the heart of his team's defence, but Argyle fashioned another chance to open the scoring just before half-time. A flick on by Evans presented Adrian Littlejohn with the opportunity to redeem his earlier miss, but he dragged his shot wide.|$|E
5|$|The offside {{rule was}} {{introduced}} to Sheffield Rules in 1863. Their version only required {{one member of the}} opposition between a player and the opposing goal to remain on side. Despite this the rule was only used sporadically in actual play. The FA version, which required a player to remain behind the ball at all times, was introduced during the 1865–66 season but was disliked due to the lack <b>of</b> <b>goal</b> scoring opportunities it caused. The one man offside was finally used a regular basis from 1867 until the adoption of FA rules in 1877.|$|E
5|$|Bonass {{spent the}} second half of the 1932–33 season as an amateur with Darlington in the Third Division North. He then {{returned}} to his home town where he turned professional with York City. He played six league matches for each club. In 1934, he joined another Third Division club, Hartlepools United, where he established himself as the regular selection at outside-left and scored at better than a goal every two games in his first season. Less prolific in his second year, he was sold to Chesterfield, newly promoted to the Second Division for 1936–37. Again, he was first choice on the left wing and productive in front <b>of</b> <b>goal</b> during his first season, less so in the next, in which he helped the team reach the fifth round of the 1937–38 FA Cup. In 1938–39, he fell out of favour, and requested a transfer. He joined Queens Park Rangers, but his career was cut short by the outbreak of war.|$|E

5|$|CPAs {{have been}} {{implemented}} {{for the management of}} a plethora of chronic disease states, including diabetes mellitus, asthma, and hypertension. Evidence suggests that CPAs have resulted in beneficial health outcomes for patients involved. It has been shown that pharmacists working with providers under CPAs help deliver higher quality of care in the setting of psychiatry to promote medication adherence, managing venous thromboembolism in outpatient clinics, and in the oncology setting, including the management of antiemetic (anti-vomiting) therapy. Within these settings, CPAs have resulted in improved attainment <b>of</b> <b>goal</b> laboratory values like hemoglobin A1c for diabetics, improved lung function for asthmatics, and improved blood pressure control for people with hypertension.|$|E
5|$|His goals {{also helped}} Darlington reach {{the second round}} proper (last 32) of the 1919–20 FA Cup. Healey scored twice against Bishop Auckland in the fifth {{qualifying}} round, and repeated the feat in the sixth, as well as creating two for Aaron Travis, as Darlington beat Southern League club Norwich City 5–0. In the first round proper, Darlington faced Sheffield Wednesday of the First Division. A damaged shoulder meant Healey was unfit for the scheduled date, but a waterlogged Feethams pitch gave him an extra few days to recover. The match ended goalless; Healey was unusually indecisive in front <b>of</b> <b>goal,</b> and was standing in an offside position when Travis did put {{the ball in the}} net. Although reported doubtful for the replay, he did appear, pressuring goalkeeper Arnold Birch into conceding a corner from which Darlington took the lead– the goal variously attributed to George Stevens or to Healey himself. He missed the second-round tie at Birmingham because his wife was ill; Darlington lost 4–0.|$|E
5|$|Jarvis {{suffered}} hip and groin injuries during pre-season {{training and}} {{was unable to}} take any further part in training until September. He finally made his debut for his new club on 20 October 2007, when he came on as an 88th-minute substitute in a 2–0 home victory over Charlton Athletic. After regaining full fitness, he became a first-choice player at Molineux, making a further 27 appearances during the 2007–08 season. He scored his first goal for the club in a 1–1 draw with Leicester City in December 2007, in a season where the club missed out on a play-off place by virtue <b>of</b> <b>goal</b> difference.|$|E

The goal was timed at 90+2:17'. Solskjær celebrated by sliding on his knees, mimicking Basler's earlier celebration, before quickly being mobbed by the United players, substitutes and coaching staff. Schmeichel, in his own penalty area, cartwheeled with glee.|$|E
5|$|Manchester City had {{the first}} attack of the match, but it came to nothing. Soon Everton began to {{dominate}} the match, with Dean frequently involved in the attacking play. Several Everton attacks came on their left flank. Stein caused Manchester City right-back Sid Cann problems, and Cann was forced to concede a corner kick on several occasions. Just after the half-hour Everton had their first shot on target, when Stein's effort was saved by Langford. Another chance quickly arrived. Stein's cross passed in front <b>of</b> <b>goal,</b> but Dean was unable {{to connect with the}} ball. Two minutes later Manchester City goalkeeper Langford attempted to catch a cross from Britton, but dropped the ball under pressure from Dean. The ball fell into the path of Stein, who put the ball into the empty net to give Everton the lead. At half-time Everton led 1–0.|$|E
5|$|Manchester United {{kicked off}} the match, but within the first two minutes they had conceded a goal. A foul on Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy by United captain Roy Keane {{resulted}} in a Liverpool penalty, which Gary McAllister subsequently scored to give Liverpool a 1–0 lead. Minutes later, Liverpool were awarded a free kick, but McAllister was unable to score, hitting Manchester United's defensive wall. United had their first chance two minutes later, but Van Nistelrooy miscued his shot in front <b>of</b> <b>goal.</b> In the 11th minute, Liverpool's lead was almost extended as United midfielder Nicky Butt almost diverted a cross from Riise into his own goal. Five minutes later, Liverpool did extend their lead; United defender Jaap Stam slipped after Liverpool striker Emile Heskey headed the ball down to Michael Owen, allowing Owen to sidestep Gary Neville and place his shot into the United goal to make the score 2–0. The frustration of the United players was beginning to show and immediately after the goal, Paul Scholes was shown a yellow card for a challenge on Dietmar Hamann.|$|E

He made a goal scoring debut for the club four days later, netting in a 1–1 draw with Rennes. He {{ultimately}} made fourteen appearances and scored twice during his loan spell as Marseille ended the season in fourth. On 30 June 2015, Marseille announced that Ocampos had signed for the club on a permanent deal for a fee believed to be around €7 million. He scored his first goal of the season in a 6–0 victory over Troyes on 23 August. The goal, another bicycle kick from a Romain Alessandrini cross, was later nominated for the Ligue 1 Goal of the Season award, which was ultimately won by Pierrick Capelle of Angers It was his only contribution in front <b>of</b> <b>goal,</b> however, as after the resignation of Bielsa early in the campaign Ocampos struggled to impress under new manager Míchel, and made only 17 appearances throughout the league season.|$|E
5|$|One of Chapman's first {{decisions}} was {{to bring}} in Sunderland striker Charlie Buchan, recognising Arsenal's lack <b>of</b> <b>goal</b> threat. Arsenal finished second in Chapman's first season, a marked improvement on previous seasons, though finished no higher as the 1920s drew to a close. Chapman continued to reshape his team and buy players to fit his desired system. He led Arsenal to their first major trophy, as they beat his former side Huddersfield Town 2–0 in the 1930 FA Cup Final. The team continued to mature and won the 1930–31 First Division title, scoring 127 goals in the process. Chapman won another championship in 1932–33, after Arsenal ended the previous season as league and 1932 FA Cup runners-up.|$|E
5|$|The club {{controversially}} {{rejoined the}} First Division in 1919, despite only finishing sixth in 1914–15, the last season of competitive football before the First World War had intervened — although {{an error in}} the calculation <b>of</b> <b>goal</b> average meant Arsenal had actually finished fifth, an error which was corrected by the Football League in 1975. The First Division was being expanded from 20 teams to 22, and the two new entrants were elected at an AGM of the Football League. On past precedent the two places would {{be given to the}} two clubs that would otherwise have been relegated, namely Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur. Instead one of the extra places was awarded to Chelsea - who had been the victims of a betting controversy - and a ballot was called for the remaining place. The candidates included 20th-placed Tottenham Hotspur and, from the second division, Barnsley (who had finished third); Wolves, (fourth); Birmingham (fifth later amended to sixth); Hull City (seventh); and Nottingham Forest (eighteenth).|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Experimental {{research}} in parapsychology {{may be of}} little value if psi is goal-oriented and the sources of psi focus on certain types <b>of</b> <b>goals.</b> Experimenters and research participants may focus on particular outcomes from a hierarchy <b>of</b> <b>goals</b> that can include wanting successful outcomes for: individual trials, individual subjects, individual experiments, lines of research, personal careers, and the field of parapsychology. There is strong evidence that goal-oriented psi applies on {{the lowest level of}} this hierarchy <b>of</b> <b>goals,</b> the level <b>of</b> individual trials. The normal statistical assumptions of experimental design and analysis and of communication theory do not apply for outcomes that are below the <b>goal</b> <b>of</b> the psi sources on the hierarchy <b>of</b> <b>goals.</b> This fact is intrinsic to the concept of goal-oriented psi and is clearly demonstrated by majority-vote studies, particularly a study that found approximately equal scoring rates on a direct, blind comparison of psi scoring on single-event and majority-vote trials. Goal-oriented psi can be investigated by finding where the normal statistical assumptions stop applying on the hierarchy <b>of</b> <b>goals.</b> If the <b>goal</b> <b>of</b> the psi source is a successful experimental outcome, or higher on the hierarchy <b>of</b> <b>goals,</b> then the assumptions for statistical research break down.

5|$|Ahead of the 2010–11 season, Bostwick {{scored in}} a {{pre-season}} friendly against Hitchin Town, {{and made his}} first league appearance in the club's 2–2 draw with Macclesfield Town, playing the whole match. He scored his first goal {{of the season in}} the club's first ever Football League victory, in a 3–1 win against Stockport County, scoring with a shot from 30yards to double Stevenage's lead just before the interval. In November 2010, Bostwick provided two assists for Stevenage's goals in the club's 3–0 win away at local rivals Barnet. Bostwick scored his second goal of the 2010–11 season in Stevenage's 3–1 FA Cup win over Newcastle United in January 2011. Bostwick picked up a loose pass and rifled a shot that went in off the post from 25yards out to give Stevenage a two-goal lead. A month later, he scored his third goal of the season in a 4–0 win against Cheltenham Town, cutting in from the right and drilling a low shot across the face <b>of</b> <b>goal</b> and past the goalkeeper. Bostwick played a total of 51 matches during the 2010–11 season, scoring three goals. This included three appearances in the 2010–11 League Two play-offs following Stevenage's sixth-placed finish. Following a 3–0 aggregate victory over Accrington Stanley, Stevenage earned promotion to League One after a 1–0 win against Torquay United at Old Trafford on 28 May 2011, with Bostwick playing the whole match.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from his}} career in hockey, Ross was {{interested}} in improving the game. Prior {{to the start of}} the 1927–28 season, the NHL adopted a new style <b>of</b> <b>goal</b> net created by Ross. With the back molded into a B-shape, it was better designed to catch pucks and the net was used until 1984, when a modified version was adopted. He also improved the design of the puck. Ross' design had bevel edges, which prevented it bouncing too much, and used synthetic rubber, rather than the natural rubber previously in vogue. Along with New York Rangers coach Frank Boucher, Ross helped to create the red line, which was introduced to help speed up the game by removing the ability for defenders to pass the puck from the defensive to offensive zone; until 2006 it was against the rules of hockey to make a two line pass. More scoring chances resulted as teams could not simply send the puck down the ice with impunity. In order to help tell the red line and blue lines apart on television, Ross suggested that the red line be striped.|$|E
