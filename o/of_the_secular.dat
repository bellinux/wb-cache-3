5|$|A {{prominent}} {{feature in}} the non-dipolar part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>secular</b> variation is a westward drift {{at a rate of}} about 0.2 degrees per year.

5|$|During Albin's episcopate, the {{incorporation}} of the Céli Dé ("vassal of God") into the cathedral chapter was probably brought near to completion. The Céli Dé were the Scottish monks who formed {{the base of the}} pre-Reform, pre-13th century monastery of Brechin before it was organised into a bishopric in the 12th century. A bull of Pope Innocent IV of 18 February 1250 stated that: These Céli Dé had been proclaimed as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>secular</b> cathedral by an act of Bishop Gregory, Albin's predecessor.|$|E

5|$|Of the {{approximately}} {{two to three}} thousand volumes of Byzantine literature that survive, only 330 consist of secular poetry, history, science and pseudo-science. While the most flourishing period <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>secular</b> literature of Byzantium runs from the 9th to the 12th century, its religious literature (sermons, liturgical books and poetry, theology, devotional treatises, etc.) developed much earlier with Romanos the Melodist being its most prominent representative.|$|E
5|$|Galeazzo Marescotti, {{a member}} of the zelanti, was the first serious {{candidate}} proposed two weeks in to the conclave. He was acceptable to the Spanish, but was opposed by the French because they wanted the new pope who was not strong. Bandino Panciatici was suggested by Pietro Ottoboni, but he was not supported by secular monarchs because he had supported giving benefices to nominees who were independent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>secular</b> authorities. Giacomo Antonio Morigia was acceptable to the secular rulers, but was opposed by the zelanti for lacking governing experience in addition to not being firm or having the energy required. Following the proposal of these candidates, others came up as well, but were quickly rejected.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} design {{plans for the}} station called for a clean utilitarian structure typical of metro stations of that period. Due {{to the efforts of}} the city's chief architect Mykola Zharikov, the design was scrapped in favor of one that resembles an ancient Kievan Rus' temple by Borys Zhezherin, Vadym Zhezherin, and Zharikov himself. Such a design was a particularly risky feat, since Ukraine was a part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>secular</b> Soviet Union {{at the time of the}} station's construction. Vadym Zhezherin and Mykola Zharikov, among the other artists and architects of the station, were bestowed the State Prize of Ukraine in the Field of Architecture for their work in 1991.|$|E

5|$|There was no {{distinct}} Angevin or Plantagenet {{culture that}} would distinguish or set {{them apart from}} their neighbours in this period. Robert of Torigni recorded that Henry built or renovated castles throughout his domain in Normandy, England, Aquitaine, Anjou, Maine and Torraine. However this patronage had no distinctive style except {{in the use of}} circular or octagonal kitchens of the Fontevraud type. Similarly amongst the multiple vernacularsFrench, English and Occitanthere was not a unifying literature. French was the lingua franca <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>secular</b> elite and Latin or the church.|$|E
5|$|Gerard {{also had}} an uneasy {{relationship}} with his cathedral chapter, after attempting to reform his cathedral clergy by forcing them {{to give up their}} wives and concubines and become ordained priests. He wrote to Anselm in 1103 complaining of the intransigence of his clergy and envying Anselm's better relations with Canterbury's chapter, which was composed of monks instead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>secular</b> canons who made up York Minster's chapter. In this correspondence, Gerard complained that some of the York canons refused to be ordained as priests, thereby hoping to avoid taking the vow of celibacy. He also accused them of accepting prebends but refusing to live or work at the cathedral, and of focusing on a narrow legal definition of celibacy without actually being celibate. The canons' argument was that they were only required not to maintain women in their own houses, but they were not forbidden to visit or entertain women in houses belonging to others. It was not only Gerard who complained about the relationship between him and his canons; the latter accused Gerard of impoverishing York by making gifts of lands to others.|$|E

5|$|In 1772, {{then again}} in 1793 and 1795, the two {{dominant}} German states of Prussia and Austria, {{along with the}} Russian Empire, agreed to the Partitions of Poland; dividing among themselves the lands of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. As {{a result of the}} partitions, millions of Polish speaking inhabitants fell under the rule of the two German monarchies. However, the annexed territories though incorporated into the Kingdom of Prussia and the Habsburg Realm, were not legally considered {{as a part of the}} Holy Roman Empire. During the period of the French Revolutionary Wars, along with the arrival of the Napoleonic era and the subsequent final meeting of the Imperial Diet, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>secular</b> Free Imperial Cities were annexed by dynastic territories; the ecclesiastical territories were secularised and annexed. In 1806 the Imperium was dissolved; German states, particularly the Rhineland states, fell under the influence of France. Until 1815, France, Russia, Prussia and the Habsburgs competed for hegemony in the German states during the Napoleonic Wars.|$|E
5|$|Many Lollards {{were still}} about, {{especially}} in London and the Thames Valley, in Essex and Kent, Coventry, Bristol {{and even in}} the North, who would be receptive to the new ideas when they came, who looked for a reform in the lifestyle of the clergy. They emphasised the preaching of the word over the sacrament of the altar, holding the latter to be but a memorial, but they were not party to the actions of the government. Other ideas, critical of the papal supremacy were held, not only by Lollards, but by those who wished to assert the supremacy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>secular</b> state over the church but also by conciliarists such as Thomas More and, initially, Cranmer. Other Roman Catholic reformists, including John Colet, Dean of St Paul's, warned that heretics were not nearly so great a danger to the faith as the wicked and indolent lives of the clergy.|$|E
5|$|The clergy {{was divided}} into two types: the secular clergy, who lived out in the world, and the regular clergy, who lived under a {{religious}} rule and were usually monks. Throughout the period monks remained a very small proportion of the population, usually less than one per cent. Most of the regular clergy were drawn from the nobility, the same social class {{that served as the}} recruiting ground for the upper levels <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>secular</b> clergy. The local parish priests were often drawn from the peasant class. Townsmen were in a somewhat unusual position, as they did not fit into the traditional three-fold division of society into nobles, clergy, and peasants. During the 12th and 13th centuries, the ranks of the townsmen expanded greatly as existing towns grew and new population centres were founded. But throughout the Middle Ages the population of the towns probably never exceeded 10 per cent of the total population.|$|E

5|$|The {{internal}} political development and feudalisation of Bulgaria in the 13th century {{resulted in a}} rising number of serfs, {{as well as an}} increase {{in the power of the}} landed nobility. This, in turn, led to aspirations for more self-rule among the most influential nobles. Many of them established semi-independent fiefdoms that nominally recognized the emperor in Tarnovo and greatly reduced the capacity of the central authorities to deal with external threats. In the second half of the 13th century, the peasantry was losing personal privileges to the benefit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>secular</b> and religious feudal lords, which in turn reduced the peasants' income and opportunities, worsening their lives. In parallel, the inability of Constantine Tikh to terminate the constant Mongol incursions in the north-east of the country shattered the pillars of the state institutions in Dobrudzha and contributed to the outbreak of the uprising and its swift success. The Mongol raids were carried out by the semi-independent chief Nogai Khan, who was more powerful than the legitimate ruler of the Golden Horde, Mengu-Timur (r. 1266–1280), and ruled over the steppes of modern Moldova and Ukraine.|$|E
5|$|It is {{certainly}} obvious that Jocelin {{was one of}} the most respected figures in the kingdom. In this era, the Pope appointed Jocelin Judge-delegate (of the Papacy) more times than any other cleric in the kingdom. As a bishop and an ex-abbot, various bishoprics and monasteries called him in to mediate disputes, as evidenced by his frequent appearance as a witness in dispute settlements, such as the dispute between Arbroath Abbey and the Bishopric of St Andrews, and a dispute between Jedburgh Abbey and Dryburgh Abbey. Jocelin had the respect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>secular</b> elite too. He witnessed 24 royal charters and 40 non-royal charters, including charters issued by David, Earl of Huntingdon (the brother of King William), Donnchadh, Earl of Carrick, and Alan Fitzwalter, High Steward of Scotland. Jocelin had been with King William when he visited the English court in 1186, and again accompanied the king to England when the king travelled to Woodstock near Oxford to marry Ermengarde de Beaumont on 5 September 1186. The marriage was blessed by Bishop Jocelin in their chamber, and it was to Jocelin's escort that King William entrusted her for the journey to Scotland. When a son was born to William and Ermengarde, the future King Alexander II, it was Jocelin who performed the baptism. In April 1194, Jocelin again travelled to England in King William's company when William was visiting King Richard I. Jocelin's intimacy with the king would be the key to earning his patronage, thus making possible the legacy that Jocelin would leave to Glasgow.|$|E
5|$|On {{his return}} from Rome, Dunstan at once regained his {{position}} as virtual prime minister of the kingdom. By his advice Ælfstan {{was appointed to the}} Bishopric of London, and Oswald to that of Worcester. In 963, Æthelwold, the Abbot of Abingdon, was appointed to the See of Winchester. With their aid and with the ready support of King Edgar, Dunstan pushed forward his reforms in the English Church. The monks in his communities were taught to live in a spirit of self-sacrifice, and Dunstan actively enforced the law of celibacy whenever possible. He forbade the practices of simony (selling ecclesiastical offices for money) and ended the custom of clerics appointing relatives to offices under their jurisdiction. Monasteries were built, and in some of the great cathedrals, monks took the place <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>secular</b> canons; in the rest the canons were obliged to live according to rule. The parish priests were compelled to be qualified for their office; they were urged to teach parishioners not only the truths of the Christian faith, but also trades to improve their position. The state saw reforms as well. Good order was maintained throughout the realm and there was respect for the law. Trained bands policed the north, and a navy guarded the shores from Viking raids. There was a level of peace in the kingdom unknown in living memory.|$|E
