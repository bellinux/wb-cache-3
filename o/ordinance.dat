5|$|Humphrey first ran {{for mayor}} of Minneapolis in 1943, losing by only six {{thousand}} votes. He campaigned again in the 1945 election, {{with the support of}} the city's labor leaders, and found support with the city's African-American community by promising to implement a city civil rights commission. He also appealed to the city's middle class by giving talks on civic virtue at area churches. He was elected in 1945 by the largest margin to date. When elected, he immediately proposed a city <b>ordinance</b> that would make racial discrimination by employers subject to a fine. After a long period of discussion, the Minneapolis City Council finally approved the <b>ordinance</b> by a 21 to 3 margin on January 31, 1947. The <b>ordinance</b> created the nation's first Fair Employment Practices <b>Ordinance</b> and established Minneapolis as the nation's leader in imposing fines for employment discrimination, though pressure from the local Urban League would also limit employment opportunities for African Americans during the ordinance's first few years.|$|E

5|$|In 1985, the New York City Health Department {{ordered that}} the city's gay bathhouses be closed. As a result, {{heterosexual}} sex clubs such as Plato's Retreat had {{to shut down}} as well because the city had just passed a gay rights <b>ordinance,</b> and allowing the heterosexual clubs to remain open while closing the gay establishments {{would have been a}} violation of that <b>ordinance.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Olivier Bancoult, {{a native}} Chagossian {{and leader of}} the Chagos Refugees Group, brought a {{judicial}} review claim against the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs for the initial <b>ordinance</b> which led to the Chagossian removal.

5|$|In May 1645, Parliament {{passed an}} <b>ordinance</b> {{allowing}} excommunicants {{to appeal the}} church's sentences to Parliament. Another <b>ordinance</b> on 20October contained a list of sins to which the church would be limited in its power to excommunicate. To {{the majority of the}} divines' dismay, an even more Erastian <b>ordinance</b> was proposed in March 1646. The Assembly published a protest, provoking the Commons to charge it with breach of privilege and to submit nine questions to the divines on the matter. Votes were to be included with the answers, an attempt to force the divines associated with the protest petition to reveal themselves.|$|E

5|$|In a book {{he wrote}} in the 1970s, Audisio argued that the {{decision}} to execute Mussolini taken at the meeting in Dongo of the partisan leaders on 28 April constituted a valid judgment of a tribunal under Article 15 of the CNLAI's <b>ordinance</b> on the Constitution of Courts of War. However, the lack of a judge or a Commissario di Guerra (required by the <b>ordinance</b> to be present) casts doubt on this assertion.|$|E
5|$|On 3 February 2013, the Criminal Law (Amendment) <b>Ordinance,</b> 2013 was {{promulgated by}} President Pranab Mukherjee.

The <b>ordinance</b> {{provides for the}} death penalty in cases of rape. According to Minister of Law and Justice Ashwani Kumar, 90 percent of the suggestions given by the Verma Committee Report were incorporated into the <b>Ordinance.</b> However, critics state that many key suggestions of the commission have been ignored, including the criminalisation of marital rape and trying military personnel accused of sexual offences under criminal law.|$|E
5|$|Once more {{in nearly}} a two to one margin, the gay rights <b>ordinance</b> was {{defeated}} in Eugene. A poll taken after the vote showed that liberal voters who were not gay simply declined {{to show up and}} vote, and those who opposed the <b>ordinance</b> were much more motivated.|$|E

5|$|The {{amendment}} defined pornography as a {{civil rights}} violation against women, and allowed women who claimed harm from pornography to sue the producers and distributors in civil court for damages. The law was passed twice by the Minneapolis city council, but vetoed both times by Mayor Don Fraser, who considered {{the wording of the}} <b>ordinance</b> to be too vague. Another version of the <b>ordinance</b> passed in Indianapolis, Indiana in 1984, but was overturned as unconstitutional under the First Amendment by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in the case American Booksellers v. Hudnut. Dworkin continued to support the civil rights approach in her writing and activism, and supported anti-pornography feminists who organized later campaigns in Cambridge, Massachusetts (1985) and Bellingham, Washington (1988) to pass versions of the <b>ordinance</b> by voter initiative.|$|E

5|$|Dworkin and MacKinnon, however, {{continued}} to discuss civil rights litigation {{as a possible}} approach to combating pornography. In the fall of 1983, MacKinnon secured a one-semester appointment for Dworkin at the University of Minnesota, to teach a course in literature for the Women's Studies program and co-teach (with MacKinnon) an interdepartmental course on pornography, where they hashed out details of a civil rights approach. With encouragement from community activists in south Minneapolis, the Minneapolis city government hired Dworkin and MacKinnon to draft an antipornography civil rights <b>ordinance</b> as {{an amendment to the}} Minneapolis city civil rights <b>ordinance.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2003, {{with colleagues}} Barbara Johnson and Sandy Colvin Roy, Schiff {{developed}} a last-minute plan to restore $2 million in proposed {{cuts to the}} Minneapolis Fire and Police Departments, following a $26 million cut from Local Government Aid by former Governor Tim Pawlenty.

50|$|Saving <b>ordinances</b> {{are those}} <b>ordinances</b> {{that are a}} {{requirement}} for exaltation. Most Latter Day Saints denominations see saving <b>ordinances</b> as necessary, but not sufficient, requirements for salvation.

The baptized person is expected to go on to be obedient to God's commandments and to receive other saving <b>ordinances.</b>|$|R
50|$|Some <b>ordinances</b> are {{performed}} in LDS temples (all <b>ordinances</b> done vicariously {{on behalf of}} deceased persons; endowment and sealings for living persons).

Celestial marriage, or sealing, is also part of the requirement for being exalted.|$|R
50|$|Some <b>ordinances,</b> such as baptism, {{confirmation}} and {{the sacrament}} of the Lord's Supper, {{are similar to those}} practiced by other Christian denominations.
