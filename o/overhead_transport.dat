40|$|Abstract — Wireless ad hoc {{networks}} offer attractive features, including flexibility, self-organization {{and dynamic}} network creation. Due {{to the limited}} bandwidth- and energy-resources in ad hoc networks, minimization of control- and processing overhead is desirable. In this paper we focus on <b>transport</b> <b>overhead</b> reduction by means of header compression techniques. The potential of header compression in ad hoc networks is not fully exploited yet and is mostly based on tag switching approaches or full decoding of the routing information at each node. While the former approach can only be applied to dedicated technologies, the later comes {{with the price of}} large processing and energy overhead. In this paper we advocate a new joint approach where compression is closely coupled with ad hoc routing. To keep the processing overhead low we suggest end-to-end compression. Packet routing can be implemented by using layer III-to-layer II routing mapping. This approach facilitates fast forwarding, since compressed IP headers are not examined at every node.

5000|$|In {{addition}} to the MP4, 3GP and other container formats based on ISO base media file format for file storage, AAC audio data was first packaged in a file for the MPEG-2 standard using Audio Data Interchange Format (ADIF), consisting of a single header followed by the raw AAC audio data blocks. However, if the data is to be streamed within an MPEG-2 transport stream, a self-synchronizing format called an Audio Data Transport Stream (ADTS) is used, consisting {{of a series of}} frames, each frame having a header followed by the AAC audio data. This file and streaming-based format are defined in MPEG-2 Part 7, but are only considered informative by MPEG-4, so an MPEG-4 decoder does not need to support either format. These containers, as well as a raw AAC stream, may bear the [...]aac file extension. MPEG-4 Part 3 also defines its own self-synchronizing format called a Low Overhead Audio Stream (LOAS) that encapsulates not only AAC, but any MPEG-4 audio compression scheme such as TwinVQ and ALS. This format is what was defined for use in DVB transport streams when encoders use either SBR or parametric stereo AAC extensions. However, it is restricted to only a single non-multiplexed AAC stream. This format is also referred to as a Low <b>Overhead</b> Audio <b>Transport</b> Multiplex (LATM), which is just an interleaved multiple stream version of a LOAS.|$|R

30|$|Massive MTC {{will be a}} major {{use case}} in 5 G networks, {{enabling}} the IoT applications which encompasses a plurality of devices, such as sensors, smart meters, and cars. Although the traffic generated by many IoT applications will be comparatively low, it is very bursty, since few small data packets will be generated irregularly from potentially thousands of devices. Consequently, the total traffic demand on the transport network is expected to be insignificant as compared to, e.g., high-definition video streaming. Thus, utilization-agnostic splits such as split A are highly inefficient for such applications due to their constant transport data rate. In addition, a fixed frame format could be seen as a drawback in a packet-based network, as small packets introduce a large <b>overhead.</b> Instead, a <b>transport</b> network supporting flexible frame formats could better deal with the nature of IoT traffic by, e.g., supporting different levels of packet aggregation.|$|R

In literature, the conventional Reed-Solomon FEC (Forward Error Correction) -based scheme and the receiver-initiated NACK (Negative ACKnowledgement) -based mechanism are most famous techniques to achieve reliable transport of multicast in wired networks. While the high computation complexity makes FEC inappropriate for software implementation in resource-limited wireless device. The NACK mechanism in wired networks can not perform well in Ad hoc networks without any change. In this paper, focusing on reliable multicast transport in Ad hoc networks(RMTAH), we propose a new packet redundancy scheme named as PDA (Packet Dispersal Algorithm) to mitigate loss in wireless link and ARM (Active Retransmission Mechanism) for Ad hoc networks to relieve from {{the problem of}} NACK implosion.

In some systems, <b>Overhead</b> Hoist <b>Transport</b> (OHT) vehicles move throughout the facility on a ceiling-mounted track system, delivering wafers to machines and storage locations. To improve efficiency in such systems, this thesis proposes an adaptive dynamic routing approach {{that allows the}} system to self-regulate, reducing steady-state travel times by 4 - 6 % and avoiding excessive congestion and deadlock. Our approach allows vehicles to be rerouted while in progress in response {{to changes in the}} location and severity of congestion as measured by edge traversal time estimates updated via exponential smoothing. Our proposed method is efficient enough to be used in a large system where several routing decisions are made each second.
