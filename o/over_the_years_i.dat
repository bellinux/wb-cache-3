5|$|<b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>I</b> {{have found}} that it is {{difficult}} if not impossible to bring to consciousness of another person the nature of his tacit assumptions when, by some special experiences, I have been made aware of them. This became painfully evident to me in my attempts during the 1950s to convince geneticists that the action of genes had to be and was controlled. It is now equally painful to recognize the fixity of assumptions that many persons hold on the nature of controlling elements in maize and the manners of their operation. One must await the right time for conceptual change.|$|E

We'd had a cool {{relationship in the}} past and I so wanted to do something else, and I wanted to get back into a television show. I had him on the brain for sure but I hadn't called him yet, but I sort of took a leap of faith and set things up with Fox and then called Joss. We went to a four-hour lunch where I just sort of used my womanly wiles. No, we've become such good friends, kind of like brother and sister and kind of like he was my watcher, my handler from when I first moved out to L.A. when I was 17 and I {{was a little bit of}} a wild child.

She also became pregnant, giving birth to a son, and they married in 1994, after living together for several years. Morgan {{had a reputation as}} a womaniser, seducing customers while working as an engineer. He continued this activity after becoming a lorry driver. Following Morgan's conviction, brother Ray Morgan said, [...] "He has had so many affairs <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>I</b> have lost count." [...] He also had a violent temper.

[...] "Close but No Cigar" [...] is a style parody of Cake that {{tells the story of}} a man who breaks up with his seemingly perfect girlfriends due to the most inconsequential of flaws. The song was inspired by an actual friend of Yankovic's who was never satisfied with any of his dates; Yankovic later explained that [...] "the song was inspired by [...] attitude, that nothing could ever be good enough." [...] The final original recorded, [...] "Pancreas", is a song mainly about the biological functions of the aforementioned organ. The song is an imitation of the musical stylings of Brian Wilson, specifically his work found on the 1966 album Pet Sounds, released by the Beach Boys, and their aborted follow-up album, Smile. Yankovic joked that the reason the song was written was because [...] "my pancreas has given so much to me <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>years,</b> <b>I</b> felt like I needed to give something back to it".|$|E

2500|$|My {{encounter}} with many Evangelical Christians who write about other religions has, to some extent, helped shape my life's work. However, <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>I</b> have been mostly {{disappointed with the}} Christian writing in this area. Instead of attempting to understand the teachings of a group, too frequently writers only compared quotes from the group's literature with biblical passages, both often out of context. Then, as I began to visit the groups, I often encountered the anger at the church many members had because of Christian writers who had written supposedly authoritative books but who had distorted members' positions and had condemned them for believing things they had never taught ... I have always thought the church deserved better, and many years ago I committed myself to providing it with the information it needed both to live at peace with its new neighbors and to carry on its missional life {{with a high level}} of integrity.|$|E
2500|$|The {{doctrine}} {{was stated}} again by Clinton in the culminating chapter of Hard Choices, her 2014 memoir {{of her time}} as secretary:... It was {{no coincidence that the}} places where women's lives were most undervalued largely lined up with the parts of the world most plagued by instability, conflict, extremism, and poverty. This was a point lost on many of the men working across Washington's foreign policy establishment, but <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>I</b> came to view it {{as one of the most}} compelling arguments for why standing up for women and girls was not just the right thing to do but also smart and strategic ... the correlation was undeniable, and a growing body of research showed that improving conditions for women helped resolve conflicts and stabilize societies. [...] "Women's issues" [...] had long been relegated to the margins of U.S. foreign policy and international diplomacy, considered at best a nice thing to work on but hardly a necessity. I became convinced that, in fact, this was a cause that cut to the heart of our national security.|$|E

2500|$|Prior to {{recording}} This Addiction, Skiba {{expressed a}} desire to return to the band's punk rock roots: [...] "That's how we started as a band, and <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>I</b> think we evolved into kind of more of a rock band with punk roots." [...] Elaborating on the album's sound in a November 2009 interview, he called it [...] "a rock record but our punk rock upbringing definitely shines through, more so than our last few records. The vibe is similar to our humble beginnings. It's a step forward but I also think it has glimmers of our past in it." [...] He also described the album as more straightforward, with a [...] "less is more" [...] approach that included reducing the number of guitar overdubs, with many of the songs including only one guitar track: [...] "We wanted a record that we could easily play live. For the most part, it's pretty bare bones while still sounding full and big." [...] The album does, however, include some synthesizer as well as a trumpet solo in the style of Neutral Milk Hotel.|$|E

[...] Clinton Kelly said, [...] "When I got the job, I told everyone I knew that we’d probably do 10 episodes, get canceled and I’d go crawling back to my old job in magazine publishing. So, I’m more surprised than anyone that we’ve lasted this long. At first I thought the essence of the show was making snarky remarks about people’s outfits, but as it turns out, 'WNTW' is about taking stock of who you are and communicating that non-verbally {{to the rest of the}} world. That’s incredibly empowering." ...|$|E
2500|$|Years {{passed and}} Richter became a {{successful}} screenwriter. Mac Rauch took Richter {{up on his}} offer and arrived in L.A. Richter proceeded to introduce the writer to producer/director Irwin Winkler who gave Mac Rauch rent money {{for the next six}} months. Over several dinners, Mac Rauch told Richter and his wife about a character named Buckaroo Bandy about whom he was thinking of writing a screenplay. Richter and his wife liked the idea and paid Mac Rauch $1,500 to develop and write it. According to Mac Rauch, his script was inspired by [...] "all those out-and-out, press-the-accelerator-to-the-floor, non-stop kung fu movies of the early '70s". Richter remembers that Mac Rauch wrote several Banzai stories and that he [...] "would get thirty or forty pages into a script, abandon its storyline and write a new one". Mac Rauch recalled, [...] "It's so easy to start something and then—since you're really not as serious about it as you should be—end up writing half of it ... You shove the hundred pages in a drawer and try to forget about it. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>years,</b> <b>I</b> started a dozen Buckaroo scripts that ended that way".|$|E

5000|$|Of all {{the racing}} games that litter game shop shelves, Ridge Racer has {{something}} {{none of the}} others do: Reiko Nagase. The series' CG-model mascot has remained surprisingly popular with even fair-weather fans <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>years.</b> <b>Is</b> it because {{she was one of}} the first polygonal female characters in videogame history? (She predates Lara Croft.) Is it because her silicon skin renders her ageless? Perhaps it's the innocent-but-cheerful look she's always wearing, or her pixieish girl-next-door haircut. Then again, maybe it's just her really long legs that everyone digs. Whatever the case, Ridge Racer is one of the few (if not the only) racing games with character, both figuratively and literally. While Ridge Racer certainly stands on its own merits as a game, Reiko Nagase offers the series a touch of personality and charm that competitors like Gran Turismo and Project Gotham Racing can't claim. —James Mielke, 1UP.com, 2006 ...|$|R
