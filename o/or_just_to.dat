5|$|The {{sea mink}} was first {{described}} in 1903, after its extinction; information regarding its external appearance and habits stem from speculation and from accounts made by fur traders and Native Americans. It may have exhibited behavior {{similar to the}} American mink, in that it probably maintained home ranges, was polygynandrous, and had a similar diet, though more seaward-oriented. It was probably found on the New England coast and the Maritime Provinces, though its range may have stretched further south during the last glacial period. Conversely, its range may have been restricted solely to the New England coast, specifically the Gulf of Maine, <b>or</b> <b>just</b> <b>to</b> nearby islands. Largest of the minks, the sea mink was more desirable to fur traders and became extinct in the late 19th or early 20th century.|$|E

In 1869, businessman Isaac Coffin built the first beach-front cottage to receive paying guests. During those days, people arrived by stage coach and ferry.

25|$|During {{all these}} years MacKillop {{assisted}} Mother Bernard with {{the management of the}} Sisters of St Joseph. She wrote letters of support, advice and encouragement <b>or</b> <b>just</b> <b>to</b> keep in touch. By 1896, MacKillop was back in South Australia, visiting fellow sisters in Port Augusta, Burra, Pekina, Kapunda, Jamestown and Gladstone. That same year, she travelled again to New Zealand, spending several months in Port Chalmers and Arrowtown in Otago. During her time in New Zealand with the Sisters of St Joseph, a school was established in Arrowtown, near Queenstown, South Island. Located in the grounds of St Patrick's Church, the small yellow cottage now known as Mary MacKillop cottage was originally built as a miner's house around 1870. It was bought by the church and incorporated into the church school in 1882 and then in 1897, Sister Mary MacKillop had the cottage and some of the school converted to a convent for the Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart who worked in New Zealand and Australia.|$|E

500|$|The {{hotel was}} also {{influential}} in advancing {{the status of}} women, who were admitted singly without escorts. Boldt's wife, Louise, was influential in evolving {{the idea of the}} grand urban hotel as a social center, particularly in making it appealing to women as a venue for social events, <b>or</b> <b>just</b> <b>to</b> be seen in the Peacock Alley. The combined hotel was the first to do away with a ladies-only parlor and provided women with a place to play billiards and ping-pong. [...] It was the first New York hotel to allocate an entire room for afternoon tea. [...] The teas began in the Waldorf Garden with attendance eventually being so large, both the Empire Room and at times, the Rose Room, had to be opened during the hours of four and six pm to accommodate the number of guests. [...] Men were admitted to the teas only if they were {{in the company of a}} woman.|$|E
500|$|Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly {{wrote that}} Madonna sells the song, due to [...] "the bass gurgles that remind of classic Massive Attack or the {{reference}} to 'Vogue.'" [...] PopMatterss Evan Sawdey enjoyed the sense of dirty fun that permeates [...] "Holy Water", writing that [...] "Madonna sounds very much at home with aggressive sentiments like 'Bitch, get off my pole' and 'Yeezus loves my pussy best', blatantly toying around with religious iconography while having a bit of provocative fun." [...] He also found the [...] "Vogue" [...] sample [...] "a rare case of Madonna acknowledging her own legacy." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine noted that the song is [...] "a welcome bit of percolating electronica". Cinquemani commended {{the inclusion of the}} word [...] "genuflect" [...] in a pop song, but also felt that [...] "Madonna's Catholic baiting [...] like a reflex at this point". The reviewer believed that Madonna deliberately included provocative lyrics in the song, either to bring back her persona Dita Parlo from her 1992 studio album Erotica, <b>or</b> <b>just</b> <b>to</b> make a statement [...] "about women of a certain age unapologetically flexing their libidos".|$|E
500|$|After Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix was released, Nomura {{wanted to}} expand Roxas' {{role in the}} series to explain the events between his birth and his {{disappearance}} from Organization XIII. For Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days, the staff thought that Roxas' role {{as a member of}} the group would be a suitable theme for the plot. Roxas was chosen as the game's protagonist as the staff thought that having a main character besides Sora would help to introduce gamers to the series' first Nintendo DS title. Co-director Tomohiro Hasegawa explained that Roxas' was originally shorter, and the staff decided he should grow taller as the game continued to develop. Nomura wanted to portray Roxas' activities differently from Sora's. In Sora's games, he is on a journey around the world, while Roxas always returns to Organization XIII after each mission. The staff constructed Roxas' interactions with the Disney characters differently from Sora's, as the Organization was meant to be secret in the game's story. Nomura told the writers that he wanted Roxas to learn something from each of his missions <b>or</b> <b>just</b> <b>to</b> have something to think about. Nomura later clarified that Roxas' personality was different from the one portrayed in Kingdom Hearts II, as he does not actively attempt to come into contact with other characters. With Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days, Nomura wanted to reveal why Roxas left Organization XIII. Although Nomura found it a sad story, he considered Zack Fair's ending in [...] to be more tragic. Nomura felt Roxas' last words in the game were also the title's most significant, as he wanted them to connect to Kingdom Hearts IIs first scene, which is actually the same scene. Uchiyama expressed sadness when the game's development ended as he would not play the character for a long time.|$|E

[...] "You transcend, because you're crossing barriers {{that a lot of people}} and even us as musicians don't normally venture to, because we don't think about it.

2500|$|Metromover is a free, {{automated}} {{people mover}} (automated guideway transit) system, similar to an elevated light rail, that operates on three loops totaling [...] of elevated track and 21 {{stations in the}} Central Business District, [...] "Omni", and Brickell. The main Inner Loop opened in 1986, and the Omni (north) and Brickell (south) extensions opened in 1994. The Metromover gained popularity significantly when the 25-cent fare was lifted in 2002. Since then it has been free to ride. Metromover is used heavily by those who live, work, or attend events in downtown, with ridership doubling from 2002 to 2014, {{as well as by}} tourists staying in downtown to get to attractions <b>or</b> <b>just</b> <b>to</b> get a free tour of the downtown cityscape. It is also used by those who commute into the city using Metrorail and Tri-Rail. Metrorail and Metromover are connected at the Government Center and Brickell stations, and even by construction workers commuting to downtown-area projects. Tri-Rail and Metrorail are connected at the Tri-Rail and Metrorail transfer station. Metromover headways vary from about two to five minutes depending on loop and overlap.|$|E
2500|$|Orwell fell {{seriously ill}} in March 1929 and shortly {{afterwards}} had money {{stolen from the}} lodging house. The thief was probably not the young Italian described in Down and Out. In a later account, he said the theft {{was the work of}} a young trollop that he had picked up and brought back with him; it has been submitted that [...] "consideration for his parents' sensibilities would have required the suppression of this misadventure. Whoever reduced Orwell to destitution did him a good turn; his final ten weeks in Paris sowed the seed of his first published book." [...] Whether through necessity <b>or</b> <b>just</b> <b>to</b> collect material, and probably both, he undertook casual work as a dishwasher in restaurants. In August 1929 he sent a copy of [...] "The Spike" [...] to the Adelphi magazine in London, and it was accepted for publication. Orwell left Paris in December 1929 and returned to England, going straight home to his parents' house in Southwold. Later he acted as a private tutor to a handicapped child there and also undertook further tramping expeditions, culminating in a stint working in the Kent hop fields in August and September 1931. After this adventure, he ended up in the Tooley Street kip, which he found so unpleasant that he wrote home for money and moved to more comfortable lodgings.|$|E
