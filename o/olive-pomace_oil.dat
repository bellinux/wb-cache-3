40|$|Different {{classes of}} olive oils and other olive samples (olives, olive paste and olive pomace) {{collected}} during their production were analysed for mineral paraffins {{in the range}} of C- 15 -C- 45. None of the 22 extra virgin olive oils contained mineral paraffins above the detection limit of 1 mg kg(- 1). Also, lampante virgin olive oil from the olive mill showed no detectable amounts, but olive oil from the market contained 6 - 30 mg kg(- 1). This contamination cannot be attributed to the refining step, which, on the contrary, partially removes the more volatile hydrocarbons, but could result from transport. <b>Olive-pomace</b> <b>oils</b> obtained by second centrifugation contained 16 - 14 mg kg(- 1) mineral paraffins, presumably because of contamination during storage Of the pomace. All <b>olive-pomace</b> <b>oils</b> from solvent extraction contained more than 100 mg kg(- 1) mineral paraffins, also mainly from storage. Deposition of particulate matter from the air, vehicle exhaust emissions and direct contamination from the bulldozers used to move the pomace were identified as potential sources...|$|R
40|$|Mineral {{paraffins}} {{are used}} as markers of contamination with mineral oils. Toxic effects are observed in Fisher 344 rats at concentrations of 0. 01 – 20 mg kg 1 bw, {{depending on the type}} of paraffins administered. Concerns arise about possible presence (in contaminated foods) of toxic aromatics and additives and for the ability of mineral paraffins to bioaccumulate also in human tissues. Olives and olive oils generally contain not detectable amounts of mineral paraffins, while all the olive oils analyzed were contaminated (6 – 30 mg kg 1 of mineral paraffins). Contamination levels exceeding 100 mg kg 1 were found in <b>olive-pomace</b> <b>oils.</b> Atmospheric fall-out and incorrect practices of pomace storage have been suggested to be the main sources of contamination. A conclusive proof of the mineral origin of the contamination was provided through hopane analysis...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBiofuels {{intended}} {{to replace the}} fuel from petroleum. They are a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels because they are renewable and less toxic to the environment. This work aims, firstly, to eliminate {{one of the major}} pollutants olive residue and waste vegetable oils such residues have become a double necessity; ecological and economic, transforming them into value-added, namely biodiesel. And, secondly, to contribute to sustainable development by offering a renewable energy source meeting the energy issues of the day as the mastery of greenhouse gas emissions and preservation of non-renewable fossil resources. The use of reclaimed vegetable oil from restaurants, for use as a fuel for road vehicles, has received a lot of attention in recent years. Used vegetable oils contain solids and free fatty acids due to oil breakdown during the frying process. The synthesis of biodiesel by transesterification of vegetable oils was carried out in this study. Two varieties of oils are used in this work, the first type is the waste oils used in frying and the second are <b>olive-pomace</b> <b>oils.</b> Waste oil residue becomes harmful to the environment. To remedy this, recovery becomes a necessity. In this experiment we determine some physicochemical properties of the oils used and biodiesel obtained. At the end of this study, a comparison of our results with the Algerian standard showed that biodiesel has properties of diesel and biodiesel addition improves cetane number and some other parameters...|$|R

40|$|Metrology {{has been}} present in our {{scientific}} knowledge {{for a long}} time, but mostly in physical measurements. Chemical measurement {{can be defined as}} a comparison of a quantity of measurand and relating it to a unit (e. g. mol/kg). When expressing a result of a measurement, the problem of traceability, validation and the measurement uncertainty (MU) evaluation must be challenged. It is well known that MU is a parameter associated with the result of a measurement that characterizes the dispersion of the values that could reasonably be attributed to the measurand. The EEC document 2568 / 91 with its annexes gives the methods of analysis to assess the characteristics of olive <b>oils</b> and <b>olive-pomace</b> <b>oils</b> with given limits. The EC document 1989 / 2003 gives the scheme, the algorithm, the pathway, the decision tree to differentiate between various types of olive oils using the particular determinations based on limits. The major lack of these EC methods is the non-existence of validation parameters, which are crucial in determining the MU (and in accreditation of a laboratory). There are several ways of evaluating (better term than calculating) the MU: with model equation, with use of a certified reference material (CRM) and with participation in a proficiency testing (PT) scheme. MU for a method of analysis is inherent to a laboratory and can serve as a tool for 2 ̆ 7 measuring 2 ̆ 7 the quality of a laboratory. Unfortunately, there are practically no CRM 2 ̆ 7 s in the olive oil testing field. The only way to achieve a usable MU is through participation in PT schemes...|$|R

40|$|In oil-mills, olive-pomace recentrifugation is {{a common}} way to reduce pomace {{moisture}} and, at the same time, to recover the oil therein. According to current rules, the obtained oil is defined as “crude <b>olive-pomace</b> <b>oil.</b> ” The aim of this work is to verify the effect of recentrifugation on specific chemical and molecular parameters of the crude <b>olive-pomace</b> <b>oil,</b> by comparing it with the corresponding virgin olive oil obtained from the same olive lots. In particular, the following were considered: (i) the polar compounds of the oils that include compounds originated from oxidative and hydrolytic degradation, analyzed by high-performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC), and (ii) the profile of DNA microsatellite molecular markers that was analyzed by using the High Resolution Melting (HRM) technique. The obtained results evidenced the significantly higher hydrolytic degradation of crude <b>olive-pomace</b> <b>oil,</b> compared with the corresponding virgin olive oil, but at an extent unlikely able to allow the detection of fraudulent admixtures with virgin olive oils.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} to evaluate the oxidative and hydrolytic degradation of 37 olive-pomace oils marketed in southern Italy and to compare the results with those obtained from 10 deodorised olive-pomace oils representative of large stocks of oil obtained after the ®nal step of re®ning. One {{aim of the research}} was to ascertain the quality characteristics of commercial olivepomace oils; another was to verify whether the legally prescribed addition of virgin olive oil to re®ned pomace oil, so that the ®nal product may be classi®ed commercially as <b>olive-pomace</b> <b>oil,</b> was actually suf®cient to justify upgrading. The analytical methods used were silica gel column chromatography and high-performance size exclusion chromatography. The data obtained showed that the ®nal retail olive-pomace oils had a lower degree of oxidative degradation than the re®ned oils, as indicated by the lower values obtained when summing the proportions of triglyceride oligopolymers and oxidised triglycerides. Conversely, hydrolytic degradation, which was evaluated by determining diglycerides, proved to be the same in the two categories of oil. The proportions of virgin olive oil added are small, as indicated by the statistically indistinguishable values of triglyceride oligopolymers and free fatty acids obtained. The possibility of setting a limit to the amount of triglyceride oligopolymers present in the commercial category of <b>olive-pomace</b> <b>oil</b> has been considered. This limit would ensure standardisation of the level of oxidation and, consequently, of the quality of marketed oils and would enhance differentiation between <b>olive-pomace</b> <b>oil</b> and re®ned <b>olive-pomace</b> <b>oil...</b>|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the classification of olive oils that are mainly distributed in Korea via imports. The fatty acid contents, degree of color, pigments, anti-oxidants, and sterol contents are analyzed on {{the different types of}} olive oil as follows: 10 kinds of extra virgin olive oil, 5 kinds of pure olive oil, and 5 kinds of refined <b>olive-pomace</b> <b>oil.</b> As a result of fatty acid analysis, the majority of oleic acid (C 18 : 1) and palmitic acid (C 16 : 0), and minority of linoleic acid (C 18 : 2) and stearic acid (C 18 : 0) were detected without any significant differences between the grades of olive oils. The UV spectrum is related to the ΔK, and it {{is a part of the}} analysis factor for the purity and degree of degradation of the oil. Extra virgin olive oil had ΔK of almost 0, pure olive oil had 0. 07 ~ 0. 12, and refined <b>olive-pomace</b> <b>oil</b> had 0. 1 ~ 0. 13. These differed from extra virgin oil, and the pure or pomace oil ΔK had a confirmed distinct difference. The color degrees of chlorophyll with a low L * value and (－) a * (green) and carotenoid with (+) b * (yellow) were confirmed to have correlation between extra virgin and other olive oils. To compare chlorophyll and carotenoid as natural pigment in olive oils, 417 nm and the ratio of the absorbance at 480 nm (417 / 480) was calculated at 1. 62 of extra virgin, 1. 85 of pure olive oil, and 3. 32 of refined <b>olive-pomace</b> <b>oil.</b> Therefore, it will be possible to distinguish when the extra virgin or pure olive oil are mixed with <b>olive-pomace</b> <b>oil.</b> The total amount of tocopherol, an anti-oxidant, were 19. 06 in extra virgin, 10. 91 in pure olive oil, and 27. 88 in refined <b>olive-pomace</b> <b>oil.</b> The high content of tocopherol in pomace oil caused recovery of solvent extractio...|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} carried out to evaluate the quality of taralli {{as a function of}} the type of oil used in their dough formulation. To this end, 4 types of oil (extra virgin olive oil, olive oil, <b>olive-pomace</b> <b>oil,</b> and refined palm oil) were utilized to prepare taralli to investigate on the lipid fraction degradation and evaluate the taralli acceptability by consumers. The data obtained pointed out that taralli manufactured with extra virgin olive oil were significantly more appreciated than those made with refined oils due to their visual appearance and odor. Moreover, with respect to the other kinds of oil, the use of extra virgin olive oil led to significantly lower values (P < 0. 05) of specific absorption at 232 and 270 nm (K(232) and K(270), respectively) and of triacylglycerol oligopolymers. It also proved to present a much lower content in oxidized triacylglycerols and diacylglycerols than <b>olive-pomace</b> <b>oil</b> and refined palm oil, respectively. Furthermore, trans fatty acid isomers were absent in taralli made with extra virgin olive oil but were constantly present in those produced with refined oils...|$|E
40|$|In Tuscany, {{approximately}} 83, 000 t/year {{of crude}} olive cake are produced as {{a by-product of}} the olive oil industry. Part of this by-product is currently conveyed from 450 olive mills to two <b>olive-pomace</b> <b>oil</b> extraction plants where crude pomace oil is produced and dried pomace is used as biomass fuel. The energy potential of the olive pomace produced in Tuscany is assessed and made geographically explicit in the present work. Due to differences in the milling processes currently used in Tuscany, olive pomace characteristics vary in terms of humidity and LHV, which are parameters that can largely influence the quality of biomass. Differences in quality of the biomass obtained through each crushing process were determined and energy potential was allocated {{to each of the}} 450 georeferenced oil mills, considering both crushing capacity and type of milling process. Furthermore, qualitative characteristics of the dried pomace produced were identified and energy potential of the biomass was estimated and allocated to the two <b>olive-pomace</b> <b>oil</b> extraction plants according to their actual crushing capacities. In such manner, two alternative utilization scenarios were prospected and their energy potentials, namely, (1) conveying crude olive cake exclusively to the two pomace oil extraction plants located in Tuscany and utilizing the dried pomace as solid fuel, and (2) using the residues at district level, by allocating the pomace produced in all oil mills within the area to a set of selected locations where energy, either for self-consuption or for delivery of heat or electricity, is assumed to be produced...|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to follow the progress of oxidation during the phases of the industrial process of olive-pomace drying and the subsequent step of crude pomace oil extraction with solvent. Silica-gel column chromatography and high-performance size-exclusion chromatography were the analytical techniques utilized to this purpose. The data obtained showed that most of the oxidation occurs during industrial drying of the pomace with a mean increase of 35 % in the oxidized triglycerides while no statistically significant increase was observed for triglyceride oligopolymers. The subsequent extraction of oil with solvent and the removal of the last traces of commercial hexane for the preparation of crude <b>olive-pomace</b> <b>oil</b> did not seem to entail any substantial increase in oxidation. There was a change in the state of oxidation given that there was art increase in triglyceride oligopolymers, which on average reached 0. 32 %, and in secondary oxidation products (mean p-anisidine value = 15. 31).

40|$|An oil {{involved}} in the 'toxic syndrome' and two similar mixtures of oils, one with and the other without added oleoanilides, were studied for their effects on the utilization of protein, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, sodium, potassium and zinc. Forty-eight female Wistar rats initially weighing about 75 g were fed for 28 days on the same semi-synthetic diet containing: virgin olive oil, or a mixture of canbra oil (50 %), refined <b>olive-pomace</b> <b>oil</b> (20 %), grapeseed oil (20 %) and animal fat (10 %), or the same dietary mixture supplemented with either 700 ppm oleoanilides or the alleged toxic oil. Weight, food intake and nutritional balances were monitored. The food intake of the animals fed the toxic oil began to decrease {{at the end of}} the trial, producing a reduction in the amount of nutrients ingested, but no weight loss. This oil also negatively affected the digestion of protein, potassium, sodium and zinc, the mechanism of which, in the case of the first two, appears to be related to the source of the fat. It also decreased metabolic utilization while favouring protein catabolism and the elimination of phosphorus, magnesium and potassium. No substantial modifications were noted in the animals' bones.

40|$|The {{ultimate}} goal of this thesis {{is the study of}} whether olive-mill wastes could possibly offer compounds that have industrial use and whether such compounds may be removed from the wastes with supercritical fluid extraction. In order to ascertain this, the wastes of olive-mills are studied, specifically the solid state olive mill wastes, since the water phase has been studied in another thesis. From the solid state wastes, the olive pomace is the compound of interest, since the olive tree leaves are much less in mass and have already been studied elsewhere. Plenty of compounds {{can be found in the}} olive pomace, that can be used in the industry, with the main product being <b>olive-pomace</b> <b>oil,</b> which adds to the income of olive oil mills and refineries. <b>Olive-pomace</b> <b>oil</b> can be traded as is, but it also contains many compounds useful to the food and pharmaceutical sectors, mainly tocopherols, sterols, fatty acids and squalene. Selective extraction of these compounds is achieved with supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO 2) extraction. This extraction is shown to have certain advantages over the standard solvent extraction, which the industry currently uses, since with small changes in the extraction conditions it is possible to extract selectively different compounds from the pomace oil. It is also cleaner and more environmentally friendly as it avoids the use of organic chemicals and it provides a solution to the diminishing population of sharks, whose liver is the current source for squalene. Supercritical fluid extraction has been researched widely over the past twenty years. It has been mentioned that supercritical fluids show densities that are similar to liquids, while keeping their viscosities in the same level as gases. The most common supercritical fluid is carbon dioxide, which can be found in abundance. CO 2 and its properties are studied in this thesis and the way they change over different extraction conditions is shown, with emphasis on their influence over its dissolving and diffusion capability. Supercritical extraction may be central to this thesis, but it’s not the only chapter of it. All the necessary steps for the accurate study of the phenomenon are presented, from gathering the pomace to quality and quantity control of the compounds of the final extract. Gas and liquid chromatography for such control can be found herein, along with other techniques, used compounds and conditions. With the use of microscopy, the inside of pomace is presented and thus, the choice for mathematical modeling is explained. Various experiments have been done, with emphasis on the applied science, while the theoretical part is formulated with the determination of the mass transfer coefficients necessary for the prediction of the extraction in large scale. Optimization of the extraction is offered, with two goals in mind, one of oil mass production and another of a specific compound enrichment in the extract. Meanwhile it is proved that these two goals cannot be simultaneously achieved. Finally an effort has been made to determine the cost of the industrial use of this technology, and to compare it with the currently used solvent extraction technology. ...|$|E
40|$|Recently {{interest}} has been revived {{in the use}} of plant-derived waste oils as renewable replacements for fossil diesel fuel. <b>Olive-pomace</b> <b>oil</b> (OPO) extracted from alperujo (by-product of processed olives for olive oil extraction), and produced it in considerable quantities throughout the Mediterranean countries, can be used for biodiesel production. A steam treatment of alperujo is being implemented in OPO extraction industry. This steam treatment improves the solid-liquid separation by centrifugation and facilitates the drying for further extraction of OPO. It has been verified that the steam treatment of this by-product also increases the concentration of OPO in the resulting treated solid, a key factor from an economic point of view. In the present work, crude OPO from steam-treated alperujo was found to be good source for producing biodiesel. Oil enrichment, acidity, biodiesel yield and fatty acid methyl ester composition were evaluated and compared with the results of the untreated samples. Yields and some general physicochemical properties of the quality of biodiesel were also compared to those obtained with other oils commonly used in biodiesel production. As for biodiesel yield no differences were observed. A transesterification process which included two steps was used (acid esterification followed by alkali transesterification). The maximum biodiesel yield was obtained using molar ratio methanol/triglycerides 6 : 1 in presence of sodium hydroxide at a concentration of 1 % (w/w), reaction temperature 60 °C and reaction time 80 min. Under these conditions the process gave yields of about 95 %, of the same order as other feedstock using similar production conditions. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia Alimentar - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaThe {{extracted}} {{olive pomace}} (EOP) is {{the waste of}} the <b>olive-pomace</b> <b>oil</b> extraction industry. Currently it is produced in large amounts throughout the entire Mediterranean basin, {{and there are no}} effective upgrade technologies for its valorization. As such, it is mainly used as an inexpensive energy source, either on site, or sold to other industries. As pomace oil extraction is carried out in large centralized facilities, this material is highly geographically concentrated, and already located on an industrial site. Furthermore, its significant polysaccharide content (above 45 %) as quantified in this work, make it an interesting material for the biotechnological valorization within the biorefinery concept. The hemicellulosic content (that accounts for approximately 50 % of all polysaccharides) is particularly relevant and its challenging valorization is studied in this work, by the development of an upgrading strategy targeted to the production of xylitol, a compound with potential applications in the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. For this, the dilute acid hydrolysis pre-treatment was used for the selective recovery of hemicelluloses. The effect of liquid/solid ratio (LSR) was initially studied, which enabled to define one of the lowest LSR described in literature (3) that enable to get highly concentrated pentose-rich hydrolysates and a low usage of process water. The dilute acid hydrolysis was further optimized by using the Doehlert experimental design to study the effects of time (0 to 180 min) and catalyst (H 2 SO 4) concentration (0. 5 to 3. 5 %) at 130 ºC. The combined severity factor (CS) was used to interpret the results and its limitations are highlighted, so that the use of empirical mathematical models was used instead to fine tune the operational conditions, that were established at 3. 5 % H 2 SO 4 and 130 min (CS= 2. 64). Under the optimal conditions it was possible to obtain a hydrolysate containing more than 34 g/L of xylose, one of the highest reported in literature for non-concentrated hydrolysates. Furthermore, glucose was found in relative low amounts (similar to arabinose concentration), rendering this hydrolysate quite interesting for xylose bioconversion. The amounts of potential microbial inhibitors such as aliphatic acids (mainly acetic acid), furans (furfural and hydroxymethylfurfural) and phenolic compounds were high as compared to other hydrolysates. This is a consequence of the high content of extractives (of which soluble phenolic compounds) and the high degree of acetylation of the hemicelluloses and was dealt on the subsequent task, hydrolysate detoxification. The remaining solids have an increased glucan content that can be upgraded into bioethanol, within the integrated biorefinery concept. Hydrolysate detoxification was studied using physico-chemical treatments, specifically neutralization with alkaline agents (NaOH, Ca(OH) 2, CaCO 3), adsorption to activated charcoal, and evaporation. The best method found was the use of charcoal activated with XIV NaOH (patent pending from this work) that allowed to remove 100 % of furfural, 97 % hydroxymethylfurfural and 92 % of phenolic compounds present in the hydrolysate. In order to access polyols production in BAE hydrolysate, six Debaryomyces hansenii yeast strains both from var. hansenii (CCMI 495, CCMI 470, CCMI 493 and 494) and var. fabryi (CCMI 496 and CCMI 941) were cultivated in chemically defined medium, with both glucose and xylose to mimic hydrolysate composition, in order to have some insight on their pentose metabolism. As expected, they have shown a quite different behavior, with strains belonging to var. fabryi showing a better performance than var. hansenii. Nevertheless, two strains were selected, one from each group, for further studies, The selected strains were CCMI 493 and CCMI 941 that displayed a lower biomass yield, a parameter chosen as indicator that they could potentially dissipate an higher Carbon flux into products. The bioconversion assays were carried out with both strains, in hydrolysate based media, but, conversely to CCMI 941, Debaryomyces hansenii CCMI 493 was not able to grow in these media. For CCMI 941 it was shown that the detoxification step is an absolute requirement, since without it, no growth, or xylitol production, were also observed. Simultaneously, the effect of hydrolysate concentration, aeration and supplementation was also studied through the addition to the hydrolysate of yeast extract, peptone, corn steep liquor and a solution of trace elements, vitamins and minerals (TEVM). The higher biomass and polyols productivity were obtained with the supplementation of low-cost salts (TEVM), what constitutes a significant advantage over other hydrolysates described in the literature...|$|E
