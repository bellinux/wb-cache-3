25|$|The {{first of}} Gee’s {{identity}} perspectives {{is what he}} calls “the nature perspective (or N-identities)” (p.101). N-identity represents an identity people cannot control, one that comes from forces of nature. An example {{of this type of}} identity would be male or female. While the person has no control over the sex they were born with, this identity only means something because society and culture say this biological difference is important. Gee explains this idea further by stating, “N-identities must always gain their force as identities through the work of institutions, discourse and dialogue, or affinity groups, that is, the very forces that constitute <b>our</b> <b>other</b> perspectives on identity” (p.102).|$|E

500|$|Eveanescence cover artwork was {{introduced}} on the band's website on August 30, 2011. It is their first album cover {{which does not}} feature Lee.

But I feel like, by now, they know who we are, and I wanted something really different. I didn't feel like {{we had to put}} a photo on the cover, I wanted it to be more mysterious and more about Evanescence itself, not just me." [...] The cover, black with vapor behind the band's name, is a play on the meaning of [...] "evanescence" [...] ("to dissipate like vapor").|$|E
500|$|A Day to Remember {{formed when}} guitarist Tom Denney asked Jeremy McKinnon {{if he would}} like to join the band as a vocalist. The pair hung out with drummer Bobby Scruggs, who later joined the band. During this period, both Denney and Scruggs were already in a band; Denney was in 2 Days 2 Late, while McKinnon played in All for Nothing. The trio wrote a song which McKinnon said [...] "was better than {{everything}} <b>our</b> <b>other</b> bands had come up with". Shortly afterwards the trio decided to form a band which was called End of An Era in its first week of existence. The name was inspired by a movie listing in a TV guide found in Denney's home. One day at rehearsal, a friend of Scruggs showed up with his girlfriend, {{who came up with the}} band's name A Day to Remember.|$|E
500|$|Two {{days before}} the main race and in inclement weather, the Cambridge boat began to sink and was pushed into barges and tugs moored below Beverley Brook.

[...] It was the first Boat Race vessel to sink since the 1951 race. [...] The Light Blues would row in the same boat in which they won the 1962 and 1964 races, while Oxford's craft was manufactured by Swiss firm Stämpfli Racing Boats. [...] Both boats were German-rigged, where the number four and five row on the bow side. [...] The inclement weather continued until the day of the race, with further disruption predicted and the threat of postponement a real one. [...] The race was umpired by the former Cambridge University Boat Club president and rower Alan Burrough who took part in Cambridge's victory in the 1939 race.|$|E

Jessica Walsh of the Reading Eagle felt that the first film was [...] "missing something, since key characters, such as Sandy the Squirrel and Mrs. Puff, make only cameo appearances". Sandie Chen of Common Sense Media wrote that the {{decision}} to relegate characters like Mrs. Puff to small roles [...] "won't go over well with some fans". About.com's Nancy Basille considered this the first movie's biggest flaw and asked, [...] "why didn't they use more of Squidward, Mr. Krabs, Gary, Mrs. Puff and all <b>our</b> <b>other</b> favorite secondary characters?" [...] The novelization of the 2004 movie includes additional scenes starring Mrs. Puff and Squidward that were not in the motion picture.

The band began the first US leg of their tour on October 10 in Oakland, California, and finished it in New York City. Evanescence then played several concerts in the United Kingdom, beginning at London's Hammersmith Apollo on November 4 and finishing the leg on November 13 at the O2 Academy Birmingham. Supported by The Pretty Reckless, Fair to Midland and Rival Sons, the tour's set list included songs from Evanescence's three albums. Lee said, [...] "We're definitely focusing mainly on the new material. We're really excited about that music the most – obviously it's the newest – but of course we'll be playing some from both of <b>our</b> <b>other</b> albums too. I guess I'd say in general, our show's on the heavy-energy side, so we'll be running around singing a lot of fast songs." ...|$|E

Lloyd Percival once called Kennedy the [...] "Billy the Kid" [...] of hockey. Derek Sanderson, considered the best at faceoffs in the late 60s and 70s, related how his father had him watch Kennedy on the TV to learn the skill. In a 1987 interview Kennedy told a reporter, [...] "I went all-out at face-offs. Your centre is your quarterback and <b>our</b> <b>other</b> guys knew exactly what I was trying to do." [...] In the 1970s, GM of the Leafs, Jim Gregory asked Kennedy if he would help the team to improve their face-off performance. Kennedy agreed but with one stipulation. [...] "This can't involve (just) the centermen. It has to involve all five guys," [...] Kennedy told Gregory and coach Roger Neilson. [...] "Everyone {{has to be in}} tune. Everybody has a job to do.

500|$|The {{casting process}} {{continued}} into much of 2010, with the additions of Jeremy Renner, Mark Ruffalo, and Clark Gregg. Ruffalo replaced Edward Norton, whom Marvel declined to have back. [...] "We {{have made the}} decision to not bring Ed Norton back to portray the title role of Bruce Banner in The Avengers," [...] stated Feige. [...] "Our decision is definitely not one based on monetary factors, but instead rooted in the need for an actor who embodies the creativity and collaborative spirit of <b>our</b> <b>other</b> talented cast members. The Avengers demands players who thrive working as part of an ensemble, as evidenced by Robert, Chris H, Chris E, Samuel, Scarlett, and all of our talented casts. We are looking to announce a name actor who fulfills these requirements, and is passionate about the iconic role in the coming weeks." [...] In response, Norton's agent Brian Swardstrom decried Feige's statement, calling it [...] "purposefully misleading" [...] and an [...] "inappropriate attempt to paint our client in a negative light". In October 2014, Norton claimed it was his own decision never to play Hulk again because he [...] "wanted more diversity" [...] with his career, {{and did not want to}} be associated with only one character.|$|E
500|$|Casting Crowns' lead vocalist, Mark Hall, {{commented on}} the lyrical content of the song, stating that: [...] "For believers, in context with <b>our</b> <b>other</b> songs, the {{messages}} are that God wants to use you, He wants you to grow and He wants {{you to have a}} purpose". Hall elaborated that: [...] "There are a trilogy of songs and messages that go together on the album. , “Glorious Day,” and “To Know You.” [...] reminds me to be more intentional about what I do. I {{may not be able to}} get on a plane and fly to China and give out Bibles and preach the gospel, but how can I witness to my co-workers and my friends and my family." [...] The portion of the chorus that says [...] "like voices in the wilderness we're crying out" [...] is a reference to John the Baptist; Hall said that one of his favorite characters in the New Testament was John the Baptist, and commented that [...] "he [...] was so black and white. This is wrong, and this is right. And he was speaking into a grey world, saying black and white things, and it cost him his life". He elaborated on that, commenting that: [...] "Until the whole world hears are the lines and the things that John the Baptist said into a culture that did not want to hear it. And we've got to be in a place in our walk with Jesus that he's filled us to where we step into something that's unpopular and we can speak the truth, but that we can also speak it in love. We've got to live in such a way that I have the purpose that John had".|$|E
500|$|Alcatraz was {{designed}} to hold prisoners who continuously caused trouble at other federal prisons, a [...] "last resort prison" [...] to hold {{the worst of the}} worst criminals who had no hope of rehabilitation. At 9:40 am on August 11, 1934, the first batch of 137 prisoners arrived at Alcatraz, arriving by railroad from the United States Penitentiary in Leavenworth, Kansas to Santa Venetia, California, before being escorted to Alcatraz they were handcuffed in high security coaches and guarded by some 60 FBI special agents, U.S. Marshals, and railway security officials. Some 32 detainees from the original military prison were reported to have been amongst the first inmates. Most of the prisoners were notorious bank robbers and counterfeiters, murderers, or sodomites. Amongst the first inmates were also 14 men from McNeil Island, Washington. On August 22, 43 prisoners arrived from Atlanta Penitentiary and 10 from North Eastern Penitentiary, Lewisburg, Pennsylvania. On September 1, one prisoner arrived from Washington Asylum and Jail and seven from the District of Columbia Reformatory in Virginia, and on September 4, another batch of 103 prisoners arrived by train from Leavenworth. Prisoners continued to arrive, mainly from Leavenworth and Atlanta in 1935 and by June 30, 1935, the penitentiary had a population of 242 prisoners, although some prisoners such as Verrill Rapp had already been transferred from Alcatraz some months earlier. On the first anniversary as a federal penitentiary, on June 30, 1935, the Bureau of Prisons observed that: [...] "The establishment of this institution not only provided a secure place for the detention of the more difficult type of criminal but has had a good effect upon discipline in <b>our</b> <b>other</b> penitentiaries also. No serious disturbance of any kind has been reported during the year." [...] The metal detectors initially caused a problem by overheating and often had to be turned off. After the failure of the Teletouch Corporation to amend the problem, in 1937 their contract was terminated and they were charged over $200 for three new detectors supplied by Federal Laboratories.|$|E
