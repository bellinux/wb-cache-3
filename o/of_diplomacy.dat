5|$|Vahan was {{instructed}} by Heraclius {{not to engage}} in battle until all avenues <b>of</b> <b>diplomacy</b> had been explored.

Before the battle, on Vahan's invitation, Khalid came to negotiate peace, to a similar end. These negotiations delayed the battles for a month.|$|E

The research is based on the analysis of strategic documents <b>of</b> economic <b>diplomacy</b> <b>of</b> SR and official statements of its main representatives. The analytical part of this thesis was preceded by a theoretical section that explained and fixed the meaning of the terms such as Europeanisation and economic diplomacy. This was followed by a short introduction to the economic <b>diplomacy</b> <b>of</b> SR. In the selected documents, the changes in terms <b>of</b> the economic <b>diplomacy</b> <b>of</b> SR were examined on three different levels. Firstly, the exploration of the strategic level <b>of</b> the economic <b>diplomacy</b> was conducted, which elucidated the trends of the development <b>of</b> the economic <b>diplomacy.</b> Subsequently, the tasks <b>of</b> the economic <b>diplomacy</b> were clarified.

Cortés sent his cousin Hernando de Saavedra inland, and he overcame local resistance to bring several well-populated districts under Spanish control. Indigenous leaders travelled from far and wide to pledge allegiance to Cortés, whom they considered to be more fair in his dealings than other Spanish captains. With the application <b>of</b> <b>diplomacy,</b> moderate treatment of the natives, and the judicious application of force, Cortés tightened the Spanish grip over Honduras.|$|E

The foreign relations of the two countries continued to improve during Brezhnev's rule, and in the Soviet Union, where the memory of German brutality during World War II was still remembered, these developments contributed to greatly reducing the animosity the Soviet people felt towards Germany, and Germans in general.|$|E

Nevertheless, as evident during Henry's break with Rome, the monarch worked within established limits, whether legal or financial, that forced him to work closely with both the nobility and parliament (representing the gentry).|$|E

Three provinces were ceded under the 1862 Treaty of Saigon, and a further three in 1867 to form the colony of Cochinchina. During the period, there was debate in the Huế court on the best strategy to regain the territory. One group advocated military means, while another believed in the use <b>of</b> <b>diplomacy</b> in addition to financial and religious concessions. By the time of Tự Đức's death in 1883, the whole of Vietnam was colonised, henceforth incorporated with Laos and Cambodia into French Indochina.|$|E

5|$|Further reviews came in {{this time}} as Defence {{planners}} attempted {{to grapple with the}} questions regarding strategy following the wars <b>of</b> <b>diplomacy</b> of the previous three decades. The emergence of the Defence of Australia doctrine as the foundation upon which Australian defence policy would be based following Paul Dibb's 1986 review of Australia's defence capabilities seemed to provide the Reserves with a definite role. Nevertheless, there remained a reluctance to rebuild the Reserves and despite these major reviews, as late as the 1990s the Army still had not managed to develop a well-structured reserve force, as it had continued to grapple with the competing demands of maintaining large-scale general readiness over developing a 'hard core' of capability within the Reserves that would be able to provide the Army with a nucleus force in times of national emergency.|$|E
5|$|In 1164-65 Manuel's cousin Andronikos, {{the future}} emperor, escaped from captivity in Byzantium and {{fled to the}} court of Yaroslav in Galicia. This situation, holding out the {{alarming}} prospect of Andronikos making a bid for Manuel's throne sponsored by both Galicia and Hungary, spurred the Byzantines into an unprecedented flurry <b>of</b> <b>diplomacy.</b> Manuel pardoned Andronikos and persuaded him to return to Constantinople in 1165. A mission to Kiev, then ruled by Prince Rostislav, resulted in a favourable treaty and a pledge to supply the Empire with auxiliary troops; Yaroslav of Galicia was also persuaded to renounce his Hungarian connections and return fully into the imperial fold. As late as 1200 the princes of Galicia were providing invaluable services against the enemies of the Empire, at that time the Cumans.|$|E
5|$|Manuel Komnenos {{attempted}} {{to draw the}} Russian principalities into his net <b>of</b> <b>diplomacy</b> directed against Hungary, {{and to a lesser}} extent Norman Sicily. This polarised the Russian princes into pro- and anti-Byzantine camps. In the late 1140s three princes were competing for primacy in Russia: prince Iziaslav II of Kiev was related to Géza II of Hungary and was hostile to Byzantium; Prince Yuri Dolgoruki of Suzdal was Manuel's ally (symmachos), and Vladimirko of Galicia is described as Manuel's vassal (hypospondos). Galicia was situated on the northern and northeastern borders of Hungary and, therefore, was of great strategic importance in the Byzantine-Hungarian conflicts. Following the deaths of both Iziaslav and Vladimirko, the situation became reversed; when Yuri of Suzdal, Manuel's ally, took over Kiev and Yaroslav, the new ruler of Galicia, adopted a pro-Hungarian stance.|$|E
