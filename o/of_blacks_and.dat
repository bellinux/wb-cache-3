The standard of living is on the rise, with incomes {{among the highest in}} the Midwest, but median household income among minorities is below that of whites by over $17,000. Regionally, home ownership among minority residents is half that of whites though Asian home ownership has doubled. In 2000, the poverty rate for whites was 4.2%; for blacks it was 26.2%; for Asians, 19.1%; Native Americans, 23.2%; and Hispanics, 18.1%.|$|E

25|$|Generally, racial {{minorities}} have demonstrated {{lower levels of}} access and knowledge ICTs and of owning infrastructure to utilize the connection. The gap between races has been evident for over a decade: in 2000, 50% of Whites {{had access to the}} Internet compared to 43% of Hispanics and 34% of African Americans. As of 2009, 77.3% of Asian Americans, 68% of Whites, 49.4% <b>of</b> <b>Blacks,</b> <b>and</b> 47.9% of Hispanics used broadband at home. Even though the racial gap in Internet connectivity and usage is still evident, it is narrowing, as {{racial minorities}} experience a higher growth rate than majorities.|$|E
25|$|Sears' {{theory of}} {{symbolic}} racism was {{developed during the}} decade of 1970 and further refined. His theory has been developed and used {{in the analysis of}} new forms of racism in the United States that emerged especially after the Civil Rights movements of the 1960s. According to Sears' theory of symbolic racism, a subtle form of racism replaced the Jim Crow or “old-fashioned” racism. Instead of the open prejudice, based on beliefs in the biological inferiority <b>of</b> <b>Blacks</b> <b>and</b> support for formal segregation and discrimination, the symbolic racism is a more abstract set of beliefs comprising a “blend” of primitive anti-Black affect with traditional American moral values.|$|E
25|$|In 1872, the {{population}} of Brazil was 10 million, and 15% were slaves. As a result of widespread manumission (easier in Brazil than in North America), by this time approximately three quarters <b>of</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> mulattoes in Brazil were free. Slavery was not legally ended nationwide until 1888 by the Lei Áurea ("Golden Act"), a legal act promulgated on May 13 by Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil. In fact, it was an institution in decline by this time (since the 1880s the country began to attract European immigrant labor instead). Brazil was the last nation in the Western world to abolish slavery, and by abolition had imported an estimated total of four million slaves from Africa. This was 40% of all slaves shipped to the Americas.|$|E

25|$|Violent {{incidents}} occurred {{throughout the}} Piedmont {{of the state}} as white insurgents struggled to maintain white supremacy {{in the face of}} social changes after the war and granting of citizenship to freedmen by federal constitutional amendments. After former Confederates were allowed to vote again, election campaigns from 1872 on were marked by violent intimidation <b>of</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> Republicans by white Democratic paramilitary groups, known as the Red Shirts. Violent incidents took place in Charleston on King Street in September 6 and in nearby Cainhoy on October 15, both in association with political meetings before the 1876 election. The Cainhoy incident was the only one statewide in which more whites were killed than blacks. The Red Shirts were instrumental in suppressing the black Republican vote in some areas in 1876 and narrowly electing Wade Hampton as governor, and taking back control of the state legislature. Another riot occurred in Charleston the day after the election, when a prominent Republican leader was mistakenly reported killed.|$|E
25|$|The Republican Party in the South {{had been}} {{crippled}} by the disenfranchisement <b>of</b> <b>blacks,</b> <b>and</b> {{the national party}} was unable to relieve their injustices in the South. During the Great Depression and the administration of Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt, some New Deal measures were promoted as intending to aid African Americans {{across the country and}} in the poor rural South, as well as poor whites. In the post-World War II era, Democratic Party presidents and national politicians began to support desegregation and other elements of the Civil Rights Movement, from President Harry S. Truman's desegregating the military, to John F. Kennedy's support for non-violent protests. These efforts culminated in Lyndon B. Johnson's important work in gaining Congressional approval for the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965. Since then, upwards of ninety percent of African Americans in the South {{and the rest of the}} nation have voted for the Democratic Party, including 93 percent for Obama in 2012 and 88 percent for Hillary Clinton in 2016.|$|E
25|$|In December 1931, Salisbury was {{the site}} of a lynching of a black man. Members of a 300-man white mob dragged Matthew Williams, accused of murdering his white {{employer}} and wounded while being captured, from his hospital bed. They threw Williams from a third-floor window to the crowd below, where he was stabbed, tied to a truck and dragged three blocks to the county court house. There they hanged him from a tree, before he had any chance of a trial. The mob paraded his body through the black part of Salisbury for intimidation, and mutilated and burned him. It was the 32nd lynching in Maryland since 1882. No one was prosecuted for Williams' murder, as was typical in lynchings. As of 2007, there was no commemoration of the extrajudicial murder. The Equal Justice Initiative, based in Montgomery, Alabama, published an updated compilation of lynchings in 2015. Director Bryan Stephenson is leading the effort to establish a museum and memorial to these crimes, and encourages counties to establish their own memorials. He believes that the history of slavery and lynchings has influenced the continued over-incarceration <b>of</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> punitive sentencing.|$|E

25|$|The {{outbreak}} {{of war in}} Europe in 1914 reduced European immigration to the United States to a trickle, and the low wage labor supply that filled Northern factories contracted sharply. With U.S. entry into the War on April 16, 1917, the military draft depleted the labor pool even further. Lured by manufacturing jobs {{and the promise of}} a better life in the North, Blacks began a massive migration to Northern industrial centers, and by 1920 over 300,000 had relocated to Detroit, Chicago, St. Louis, and Cleveland. The sudden exodus of their labor pool, and therefore their economic security, sent alarm throughout White communities in the South. Whites in the North reacted with similar consternation over the influx of Blacks into their cities. Southern White anger over increasing race assertiveness <b>of</b> <b>Blacks,</b> <b>and</b> Northern White concerns about Black migration, led to more virulent racism and frequent outbreaks of racial violence. After the War ended on November 11, 1918, the tense atmosphere exploded during the summer of 1919. On April 2, 1917, the United States declared war on Germany, ushering a period of social, racial, and political turbulence.|$|E
25|$|The Great Depression in the United States {{hurt the}} Polish American {{communities}} across the country as heavy industry and mining sharply cut employment. During the prosperous 1920s, the predominantly Polish Hamtramck neighborhood suffered from an economic slowdown in the manufacturing sector of Detroit. The Hamtramck neighborhood was in disrepair, with poor public sanitation, high poverty, rampant tuberculosis, and overcrowding, and {{at the height of the}} Depression in 1932, nearly 50% of all Polish Americans were unemployed. Those who continued to work in the nearby Dodge main plant, where a majority of workers were Polish, faced intolerable conditions, poor wages, and were demanded to speed up production beyond reasonable levels. As the industrial trades Polish Americans worked in became less financially stable, an influx <b>of</b> <b>Blacks</b> <b>and</b> poor southern Whites into Detroit and Hamtramck exacerbated the job market and competed directly with Poles for low-paying jobs. Corporations benefited from the interracial strife and routinely hired Blacks as strikebreakers against the predominantly Polish-American trade unions. The Ford Motor Company used Black strikebreakers in 1939 and 1940 to counter strikes by the United Auto Workers, which had a predominantly Polish-American membership. The mainly Polish UAW membership and pro-Ford Black loyalists fought at the gates of the plant, often in violent clashes. Tensions with blacks in Detroit was heightened by the construction of a federally funded housing project, the Sojourner Truth houses, near the Polish community in 1942. Polish Americans lobbied against the houses, but their political sway was ineffective. Racial tensions finally exploded in the race riot of 1943.|$|E
