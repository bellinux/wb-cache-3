5|$|Kant {{believed}} that the Categorical Imperative provides us with the maxim that {{we ought not to}} lie in any circumstances, even if we are trying to bring about good consequences, such as lying to a murderer to prevent them from finding their intended victim. Kant argued that, because we cannot fully know what the consequences of any action will be, the result might be unexpectedly harmful. Therefore, we ought to act to avoid the known wrong—lying—rather than to avoid a potential wrong. If there are harmful consequences, we are blameless because we acted according to <b>our</b> <b>duty.</b> Driver argues that this might not be a problem if we choose to formulate our maxims differently: the maxim 'I will lie to save an innocent life' can be universalized. However, this new maxim may still treat the murderer as a means to an end, which we have a duty to avoid doing. Thus we may still be required to tell the truth to the murderer in Kant's example.|$|E

40|$|What {{morality}} requires {{of us in}} a {{world of}} poverty and inequality depends both on what <b>our</b> <b>duties</b> are in the abstract, and on {{what we can do to}} help. T. M. Scanlon's contractualism addresses the first question. I suggest that contractualism isolates the moral factors that frame our deliberations about the extent of our obligations in situations of need. To this extent, contractualism clarifies our common-sense understanding of <b>our</b> <b>duties</b> to distant others. The second, empirical question then becomes vital. What we as individuals need to know is how to fulfil <b>our</b> <b>duties</b> to the distant poor. Moral theorists tend to base their prescriptions on simple assumptions about how the rich can help the poor. Yet a survey of the empirical literature shows how urgently we need more information on this topic before we can know what contractualist morality — or any plausible morality — requires of us...|$|R

25|$|The {{good deed}} {{is a key}} {{component}} of the law and promise.

25|$|It is <b>our</b> <b>duty</b> {{to praise}} the Master of all, to exalt the Creator of the Universe, who has not made us like {{the nations of the}} world and has not placed us like the {{families}} of the earth; who has not designed our destiny to be like theirs, nor our lot like that of all their multitude, who worship mist and emptiness and pray to a god who cannot save.|$|E
25|$|If {{people ask}} {{in the name}} of {{religion}} we must help them. The vehicle of this support is a complete boycott of the enemies' goods. Each riyal, dirham …etc. used to buy their goods eventually becomes bullets to be fired at the hearts of brothers and children in Palestine. For this reason, it is an obligation not to help them (the enemies of Islam) by buying their goods. To buy their goods is to support tyranny, oppression and aggression. Buying goods from them will strengthen them; <b>our</b> <b>duty</b> is to make them as weak as we can. Our obligation is to strengthen our resisting brothers in the Sacred Land as much as we can. If we cannot strengthen the brothers, we have a duty to make the enemy weak. If their weakness cannot be achieved except by boycott, we must boycott them.|$|E

40|$|Combatants in war inflict untold devastation. They lay {{waste the}} environment, destroy {{cultural}} heritage, wound, maim, and kill. Most importantly, they kill. These deeds would be, {{in any other}} context, paradigmatically unjust. This thesis asks whether they can be justi-fied. There are two possible approaches: first, deny that killing in war is in fact unjust; sec-ond, argue that the injustice is overridden by weightier moral reasons. In Part I, I reject the view that principles of self-defence can render killing in war just. I argue that the most plausible theories of self-defence are hardest to apply in the cha-otic context of war, while the most practicable theories are least philosophically defensible. Moreover, none of them encompasses the inevitable noncombatant deaths that all wars bring. If killing in war is almost always unjust, perhaps we should advocate pacifism. In Part II, I propose an alternative, arguing that these injustices might be all things con-sidered justified. Combatants have morally important relationships: they have deep personal relationships with friends and family, and comrades-in-arms; if they are citizens of just communities, then that relationship is valuable too. I argue that they have associative duties to protect these relationships against {{the threat posed by}} war, and that these duties may override the injustices they must commit to avert that threat. After defending a conception of associative duties, I support this conclusion with the following argument. As well as <b>our</b> general <b>duties</b> not to harm, we have general <b>duties</b> to protect. <b>Our</b> general <b>duties</b> to protect sometimes override <b>our</b> general <b>duties</b> not to harm, in particular, in cases of justified humanitarian intervention. <b>Our</b> associative <b>duties</b> to protect, however, are stronger than <b>our</b> general <b>duties</b> to protect. If <b>our</b> associative <b>duties</b> to protect are stronger than <b>our</b> general <b>duties</b> to protect, and <b>our</b> general <b>duties</b> to protect can override <b>our</b> general <b>duties</b> not to harm, then <b>our</b> associative <b>duties</b> to protect should also be able to override <b>our</b> general <b>duties</b> not to harm.

In contrast to the Zulu War of 1906 and the outbreak of World War I in 1914, when he recruited volunteers for the Ambulance Corps, this time Gandhi attempted to recruit combatants. In a June 1918 leaflet entitled [...] "Appeal for Enlistment", Gandhi wrote [...] "To bring about such a state of things we should have the ability to defend ourselves, that is, the ability to bear arms and to use them...If we want to learn the use of arms with the greatest possible despatch, it is <b>our</b> <b>duty</b> to enlist ourselves in the army."

500|$|According to {{historian}} Mark McLeod, these postulated {{explanations of}} Định's behaviour are plausible, given the chaos engulfing Vietnam {{at the time}} and the lack of conclusive documentation. However, Định and his supporters asserted their loyalty to the monarch and justified their struggle in his name, {{both before and after the}} signing of the treaty. These declarations show no hint of rejecting Tự Đức's authority nor any reference to a worthier, idealised monarch. Conversely, many of these proclamations display an intense feeling of personal loyalty. A placard that French forces found floating downstream near Định's base in Gò Công asserted: [...] "Gratitude ties us to our king. We will avenge the insults he has received , or we will die for him." [...] One of Định's proclamations to his followers read: [...] "The Emperor does not recognise us, but it is indeed <b>our</b> <b>duty</b> to carry on our struggle.... The Emperor calls us rebels, but in the depth of his heart he cannot help but praise our loyalty. When the day of victory arrives, not only will the Emperor forgive us, he will furthermore grant us all kinds of awards." ...|$|E
500|$|Many Muslims saw the {{cartoons}} {{as a sign}} of lack of education about Islam in Denmark and in the West.

Do not say that this is the task of the ulema (religious scholars)it is the task of all of us." [...] Ana Soage said, [...] "the targeting of a religious symbol like Muhammad, the only prophet that Muslims do not share with Jews and Christians, was perceived as the last in a long list of humiliations and assaults: it is probably not a coincidence that the more violent demonstrations were held in countries like Syria, Iran and Libya, whose relations with the West are tense." [...] Yusuf al-Qaradawi, a prominent Islamic theologian, called for a day of anger from Muslims in response to {{the cartoons}}. He supported calls for a UN resolution that [...] "categorically prohibits affronts to prophetsto the prophets of the Lord and His messengers, to His holy books, and to the religious holy places". He also castigated governments around the world for inaction on the issue, saying, [...] "Your silence over such crimes, which offend the Prophet of Islam and insult his great nation, is what begets violence, generates terrorism, and makes the terrorists say: Our governments are doing nothing, and we must avenge our Prophet ourselves. This is what creates terrorism and begets violence." ...|$|E
500|$|Borussia {{were drawn}} against Slovan Liberec of the Czech Republic in the quarter–finals, {{the first leg}} was drawn 0–0 draw in Prague. The draw was {{significant}} {{because it was the}} first time in the competition, that Liberec had failed to win at home. Dortmund won the second leg 4–0, after goals from Márcio Amoroso on 51 minutes, Jan Koller on 57 minutes, Lars Ricken on 70 minutes, and finally Ewerthon on 89 minutes. Borussia faced stronger opponents in the semi-finals, when they were drawn with the then five times champions of Europe; Milan. Nevertheless, Borussia won the first leg 4–0, after a hat-trick from Márcio Amoroso, and a goal on 63 minutes from Jörg Heinrich. Milan manager Carlo Ancelotti admitted he was not surprised with the result, stating that, [...] "We knew they had quick strikers. I am more surprised by the terrible performance of our team. The problem stemmed from the wings. I had no reason to change the team because Rui Costa has not trained for ten days. It will be very difficult but it is <b>our</b> <b>duty</b> to give it our best and to try and qualify." [...] In the second leg, Milan won 3–1, with Filippo Inzaghi, and Cosmin Contra scoring within 18 minutes. However, Milan did not get their third goal until injury time when Serginho scored a penalty after Inzaghi was adjudged to have been pulled back by Christoph Metzelder. With Milan still needing one goal to force extra time, Lars Ricken scored for Dortmund in the fourth minute of injury time to put the club into their first European final since winning the 1997 Champions League Final.|$|E
