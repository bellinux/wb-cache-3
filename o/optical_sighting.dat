25|$|Given the {{existing}} facilities and the site's strategic importance, {{the site was}} selected for a Maginot ouvrage in 1926. Work began in 1931, abandoning {{some of the older}} work and creating new underground facilities to the Maginot Line standard. A gallery connected the new position to the Séré de Rivières works. Work stopped in July 1935 {{as a result of the}} Stresa Front agreement with Italy, but restarted in 1938 as relations with Italy and Germany deteriorated. The cost of the new work amounted to 10.3 million francs (not including armament). When the position was occupied in 1938, numerous deficiencies in heat, ventilation and <b>optical</b> <b>sighting</b> equipment were uncovered.|$|E

The <b>optical</b> <b>sight</b> can be modified into a wide family of tools for viewing and selecting objects. <b>Optical</b> <b>sight</b> scales well from desktop environments to fully immersive systems...|$|R
50|$|There are two {{different}} day <b>optical</b> <b>sights</b> available for the M200 Intervention. The standard <b>optical</b> <b>sight</b> is the Nightforce NXS 5.5-22x56 variable magnification telescopic sight with a 56 mm objective. The alternative <b>optical</b> <b>sight</b> is the US Optics SN-9. The night vision system is the AN/PVS-14 GEN III Pinnacle monocular, which attaches to the day optic using the Monoloc device. An AN/PEQ-2 infrared laser provides additional lighting in low-light conditions. The device {{is attached to a}} titanium strut.|$|R
25|$|The {{ergonomic}} {{design of the}} controls such as handles, launcher, barrel shape and <b>optical</b> <b>sight,</b> is predefined standard. All controls are easy to handle in all shooting positions (lying, kneeling or standing). After the weapon is fired, the firing mechanism with the attached <b>optical</b> <b>sight</b> is removed and the barrel thrown away, the firing mechanism is reusable. The effective combat range of Panzerfaust 3 is between 15 and 300 metres against moving and 400 and 600 metres against static targets. An <b>optical</b> <b>sight</b> with line pattern fixed to the reusable firing mechanism enables to engage moving or static targets. To ensure night combat capability, a night-vision device or residual light amplifier {{can be set up}} in front of the <b>optical</b> <b>sight.</b>|$|R

50|$|In 2014 the Irish Army began issuing {{upgraded}} Steyr AUG bullpup {{assault rifles}} to its operational units. The modularity of the AUG allowed the Irish AUG A1 model rifles to be modernized without any gunsmithing, by replacing the original A1 housing/receiver group (with 1.5× <b>optical</b> <b>sight)</b> with an A3 housing/receiver group (with MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rail {{on top and}} right side) allowing a modern <b>optical</b> <b>sight</b> to be fitted. The Trijicon ACOG 4× sight {{was selected as the}} new <b>optical</b> <b>sight.</b> The upgraded rifles are called the Steyr AUG Mod 14.|$|R
50|$|The Mk 86 on Aegis-class ships {{controls}} the ship's 5"/54 caliber Mk 45 gun mounts, and can engage {{up to two}} targets at a time. It also uses a Remote <b>Optical</b> <b>Sighting</b> system which uses a TV camera with a telephoto zoom lens mounted on the mast {{and each of the}} illuminating radars.|$|E
50|$|The Post Plotting Instrument, {{or simply}} Post Instrument, was the {{standard}} <b>optical</b> <b>sighting</b> system {{used by the}} UK's Royal Observer Corps (ROC) to determine the location of aircraft. It was used {{during the period from}} the mid-1930s into the early 1950s, {{and was one of the}} main sources of daytime tracking information during World War II.|$|E
50|$|In July 1958, the NIIP {{began the}} design of a new, highly advanced, mobile air-defense system. Eventually {{designated}} the 2k12 Kub (Cube), each battery consisted of a number of similar tracked vehicles, one of which carried a radar with a range of 75 km (47 mi), as well as an <b>optical</b> <b>sighting</b> unit. Several other design bureaus were involved in creating the Kub, all coordinated by Tikhomirov.|$|E

Further {{it can be}} delivered with cleaning kits and soft and heavy-duty transit cases and various maintenance tools.|$|R
50|$|High-voltage {{electro-shock}} {{weapons were}} first {{developed in the}} US in the 1990s. They include electro-shock batons, stun guns, stun shields, dart-firing stun guns, and stun belts. From 1997 to 2000, US companies earned over $13 million exporting stun guns, electro-shock batons and <b>optical</b> <b>sighting</b> devices to Eastern Europe and the Middle East. More than 150 companies worldwide {{are involved in the}} manufacturing or marketing of torture devices, almost half of which are in the US.|$|E
50|$|Ship gun fire-control systems (GFCS) enable {{remote and}} {{automatic}} targeting of guns against surface ships, aircraft, and shore targets, {{with or without}} the aid of radar or <b>optical</b> <b>sighting.</b> Most US ships that are destroyers or larger (but not destroyer escorts or escort carriers) employed GFCS for 5 -inch and larger guns, up to battleships, such as the USS Iowa. Beginning with ships built in the 1960s, GFCSs were integrated with missile fire-control systems and other ship sensors.|$|E

The battleships and cruisers were fully armored against Taffy 3's 5 in (127 mm) projectiles. They together had dozens of larger caliber guns, including the Yamatos 18.1 in guns, which could reach out to 25 mi. Surface gunnery was controlled by <b>optical</b> <b>sighting</b> which fed computer-assisted fire control systems, though they were less sophisticated than the radar-controlled systems on U.S. destroyers.|$|E

5000|$|By {{the start}} of World War I, the 77 mm had become the {{standard}} German weapon, and came mounted on a large traverse that could be easily picked up on a wagon for movement. Krupp 75 mm guns were supplied with an <b>optical</b> <b>sighting</b> system that improved their capabilities. The German Army also adapted a revolving cannon {{that came to be}} known to Allied fliers as the [...] "flaming onion" [...] from the shells in flight. This gun had five barrels that quickly launched a series of 37 mm artillery shells.|$|E
50|$|The ship's 130 mm {{guns are}} the AK-130-MR-184. The system {{includes}} a {{computer control system}} with electronic and television sighting. The gun can be operated in fully automatic mode from the radar control system, under autonomous control using the turret mounted Kondensor <b>optical</b> <b>sighting</b> system and can also be laid manually. Rate of fire is disputed, but various Russian sources credit the weapon with a cyclic rate of 30-40 rounds per minute per barrel, {{in line with the}} French Creusot-Loire 100 mm or the Italian OTO Melara 127 mm/54, but faster than the US Mark 45.|$|E
5000|$|At {{that time}} there was a great debate taking place in Bomber Command over the use of [...] "pathfinders", {{specialized}} aircraft and crews that would find the targets and use flares to mark them for attack. The same technique had first been used during the Blitz by the Germans, notably by the specialist Kampfgeschwader 100, but its effectiveness had been severely curtailed by British jamming efforts. Nevertheless, the concept had enough backing that a small force of Mosquitoes had been organized to operate as a pathfinder force, using normal <b>optical</b> <b>sighting.</b> This proved disappointing in practice, offering only a slight improvement in accuracy.|$|E

50|$|The missile {{is carried}} in a {{rectangular}} launcher box, which is connected to a control box by a 20-meter cable, allowing for a degree of separation from the operator. The missile {{can be set up}} in around 30 seconds by a single man. The transporter/launcher box is pointed toward the expected direction of the enemy and the control box is attached to it using the cable. The manual command to line of sight (MCLOS) control box consists of an <b>optical</b> <b>sighting</b> device and a joystick, which transmits commands to the missile via two thin cables that are trailed behind the missile.|$|E
50|$|Ford Aerospace's entry {{was based}} around the Bofors 40 mm L/70 cannons, twin-mounted {{in the center}} of the turret in a fashion similar to the General Dynamics entry. The {{relatively}} large and boxy turret also mounted separate long-range search and short-range tracking radars on top. The radars were mounted on booms to give them a clear view of the sky, and both had the ability to be folded down to reduce the vehicle's height during travel. The tracking radar was a modified version of the Westinghouse AN/APG-66 from the F-16 Fighting Falcon. Like the GD entry, it also mounted a complete <b>optical</b> <b>sighting</b> and ranging system.|$|E
