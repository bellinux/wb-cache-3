5|$|For a {{brief period}} Orkney emerged from {{prehistory}} and into protohistory. The Greek explorer Pytheas visited Britain sometime between 322 and 285 BC and may have circumnavigated the mainland. In his <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ocean</b> he refers to the most northerly point as Orcas, conceivably a reference to Orkney.|$|E
5|$|Frigatebirds {{remain in}} the air and do not settle <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean.</b> They produce very little oil from their uropygial glands so their {{feathers}} would become sodden if they settled on the surface. In addition, with their long wings relative to body size, they would have great difficulty taking off again.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of war in 1939, Mackay was ranked seventh on the army's seniority list. Following formation of a second infantry division for the Second Australian Imperial Force in 1940, Lieutenant General Sir Thomas Blamey was elevated to command of the newly created I Corps. Mackay was selected to command the 7th Division {{on the advice of}} General Sir Brudenell White but Cabinet, after consulting with Blamey, switched this appointment to the 6th Division. Mackay assumed command on 4 April 1940, receiving the serial number NX363, and sailed from Melbourne for the Middle East <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> liner RMS Strathaird on 15 April.|$|E

She saw action during World War I at the Battle of Heligoland Bight in August 1914, where she badly damaged the British cruiser , and at the Battle of Jutland on 31 May 1916. There, in a chaotic night engagement, Frauenlob {{was hit by a}} torpedo launched by , which caused the ship to capsize and sink with the vast majority of her crew.

5|$|He also {{visited the}} poverty-stricken {{areas of the}} country, and {{undertook}} 16 tours to {{various parts of the}} Empire between 1919 and 1935. On a tour of Canada in 1919, he acquired the Bedingfield ranch, near Pekisko, Alberta, and in 1924, he donated the Prince of Wales Trophy to the National Hockey League. From January to April 1931, he and his brother, Prince George, travelled 18,000 miles on a tour of South America, voyaging out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> liner , and returning via Paris and an Imperial Airways flight from Paris–Le Bourget Airport that landed specially in Windsor Great Park.|$|E
5|$|His {{period in}} command was brief, for on 22 November he, like other brigadier generals, was replaced, and {{returned}} to the 84th Infantry Brigade. The 42nd Division was chosen to participate in the occupation of the Rhineland, occupying the Ahrweiler district. In April 1919, they entrained for Brest and Saint-Nazaire, where they boarded ships to return to the United States. MacArthur traveled <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> liner , which reached New York on 25 April 1919.|$|E

25|$|In addition, many land {{animals have}} adapted to living {{a major part of}} their life <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>oceans.</b> For instance, seabirds are a diverse group of birds that {{have adapted to}} a life mainly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>oceans.</b> They feed <b>on</b> marine animals and spend most of their {{lifetime}} on water, many only going on land for breeding. Other birds that have adapted to oceans as their living space are penguins, seagulls and pelicans.

5|$|Marine mammals are aquatic mammals {{that rely}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> and other marine {{ecosystems}} for their existence. They include {{animals such as}} seals, whales, manatees, sea otters and polar bears. They do not represent a distinct taxon or systematic grouping, but rather have a polyphyletic relation due to convergent evolution, as in {{they do not have}} an immediate common ancestor. They are also unified by their reliance on the marine environment for feeding.|$|E
5|$|Most young {{octopuses}} hatch as paralarvae and are planktonic {{for weeks}} to months, {{depending on the}} species and water temperature. They feed on copepods, arthropod larvae and other zooplankton, eventually settling <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> floor and developing directly into adults with no distinct metamorphoses that are present in other groups of mollusc larvae. Octopus species that produce larger eggs – including the southern blue-ringed, Caribbean reef, California two-spot, Eledone moschata and deep sea octopuses – {{do not have a}} paralarval stage, but hatch as benthic animals similar to the adults.|$|E

5|$|Seamounts provide {{habitats}} and spawning grounds for these larger animals, including numerous fish. Some species, including black oreo (Allocyttus niger) and blackstripe cardinalfish (Apogon nigrofasciatus), {{have been shown}} to occur more often on seamounts than anywhere else <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> floor. Marine mammals, sharks, tuna, and cephalopods all congregate over seamounts to feed, as well as some species of seabirds when the features are particularly shallow.|$|E
5|$|Sorkin {{collaborated with}} Warren Beatty {{on a couple}} of scripts, one of which was Bulworth.

5|$|During {{her career}} Danton {{was sent to}} Great Britain to honor the {{coronation}} of George V, and later served in World War I as an escort for supply ships and troop transports, guarding them from elements of the German Navy. While en route to aid a blockade, she was torpedoed and sunk on 19 March 1917 by a German U-boat, leaving 296 men dead. The location of the wreck remained a mystery until an underwater survey team inadvertently discovered the battleship in December 2007. In February 2009, the wreck was confirmed to be Danton. The ship is in remarkably good shape for her age. Danton rests upright <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> floor, {{and most of the}} original equipment is reported to be intact.|$|E

5|$|Having {{spent the}} winter alone <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean,</b> {{it is unclear}} whether the Atlantic puffin meets its {{previous}} partner offshore or whether they encounter each other when they return to their nest of the previous year. On land, they soon set about improving and clearing out the burrow. Often, one stands outside the entrance while the other excavates, kicking out quantities of soil and grit that showers the partner standing outside. Some birds collect stems and fragments of dry grasses as nesting materials but others do not bother. Sometimes a beakful of materials is taken underground, only to be brought out again and discarded. Apart from nest-building, the other way in which the birds restore their bond is by billing. This is a practice in which the pair approach each other, each wagging its head from side to side, and then rattle their beaks together. This seems to be an important element of their courtship behaviour because it happens repeatedly, and the birds continue to bill, to a lesser extent, throughout the breeding season.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, Baxter {{heard that}} the New South Wales University of Technology {{was looking for a}} {{professor}} of chemical engineering. He applied, and was offered the job. Baxter and his family packed their belongings and sailed to Australia <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> liner Orcades, arriving in Sydney on 16 January 1950. They bought a house in Enfield, where Baxter would reside {{for the rest of his}} life. At the time the university was located in temporary accommodation on the grounds of the Sydney Technical College campus in Ultimo. Baxter became the head of a new School of Chemical Engineering that was created on his arrival, but he initially had only one full-time staff member as most of the instruction was carried out by part-time staff. Although he had no previous teaching experience, he turned out to be a good, well-organised lecturer, and he worked closely with his first postgraduate students, whose research was into fields that Baxter had been involved with in England.|$|E
