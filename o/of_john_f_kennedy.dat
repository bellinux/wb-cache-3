5|$|Current {{practice}} {{involves a}} celebrity turning {{the lights on}} in mid- to late-November, and they remain lit until 6 January (Twelfth Night). The festivities were postponed in 1963 due to the assassination <b>of</b> <b>John</b> <b>F.</b> <b>Kennedy</b> and in 1989 to fit Kylie Minogue's touring commitments. In 2015, the lights were switched on earlier, on Sunday 1 November, resulting in an unusual closure of the street to all traffic.|$|E
5|$|Solidifying his {{reputation}} as a hard-driving and assertive leader, Shoup rose through the senior leadership of the Marine Corps, overhauling fiscal affairs, logistics, and recruit training. He was selected as commandant by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, and later served in the administration <b>of</b> <b>John</b> <b>F.</b> <b>Kennedy.</b> He reformed the Corps, emphasizing combat readiness and fiscal efficiency, against what was perceived as politicking among its officers.|$|E
5|$|Crawford {{published}} her autobiography, A Portrait of Joan, co-written with Jane Kesner Ardmore, in 1962 through Doubleday. Crawford's next book, My Way of Life, {{was published}} in 1971 by Simon & Schuster. Those expecting a racy tell-all were disappointed, although Crawford's meticulous ways were revealed in her advice on grooming, wardrobe, exercise, and even food storage. Upon her death there were found in her apartment photographs <b>of</b> <b>John</b> <b>F.</b> <b>Kennedy,</b> for whom she had reportedly voted in the 1960 presidential election.|$|E

5|$|JFK is a 1991 American conspiracy-thriller film {{directed}} by Oliver Stone. It examines {{the events leading}} to the assassination <b>of</b> <b>John</b> <b>F.</b> <b>Kennedy</b> and alleged cover-up {{through the eyes of}} former New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner). Garrison filed charges against New Orleans businessman Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones) for his alleged participation in a conspiracy to assassinate the President, for which Lee Harvey Oswald (Gary Oldman) was found responsible by the Warren Commission.|$|E
5|$|Bo's {{stint as}} Minister of Commerce {{significantly}} raised his international profile and generated media attention both in China and abroad. Described as good-looking, articulate and open-minded in {{his approach to}} problems, Bo's rise from a municipal official to the central government generated great media fanfare and elevated his status to something of a 'political star.' Bo's political persona was considered {{a departure from the}} generally serious and conservative leadership in Beijing. With his youthful vigour, populism, and purported popularity with female reporters, Bo's political rise had been compared to that <b>of</b> <b>John</b> <b>F.</b> <b>Kennedy.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{assassination}} <b>of</b> <b>John</b> <b>F.</b> <b>Kennedy</b> {{showed the}} need for a clear way for determining presidential disability {{in the context of the}} Cold War. The new President, Lyndon B. Johnson, had once suffered a heart attack and – with the office of Vice President to remain vacant until the next term began on January 20, 1965 – the next two people in the line of succession were the 71-year-old Speaker of the House John McCormack and the 86-year-old Senate President pro tempore Carl Hayden. Senator Birch Bayh succeeded Kefauver as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Constitutional Amendments and set about advocating for a detailed amendment dealing with presidential disability.|$|E

5|$|When {{it came to}} {{personal}} politics, Crawford aligned herself as a Democrat who greatly supported, and admired, the administrations <b>of</b> <b>John</b> <b>F.</b> <b>Kennedy</b> and Franklin Delano Roosevelt. She was once noted as saying: The Democratic party is one that I've always observed. I have struggled greatly in life from the day I was born and I am honored {{to be a part}} of something that focuses on working class citizens and molds them into a proud specimen. Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. Kennedy have done so much in that regard for the two generations they've won over during their career course.|$|E
5|$|While still a major general, Shoup was {{unexpectedly}} {{nominated to}} become Commandant of the Marine Corps by President Dwight D. Eisenhower {{at the behest}} of Secretary of Defense Thomas S. Gates, Jr.. To prepare for this duty he was promoted to lieutenant general on 2 November 1959, and briefly assigned duties as Chief of Staff, Headquarters Marine Corps. He was elevated to general on 1 January 1960, upon assuming the post as the 22nd Commandant of the Marine Corps. He would later serve under the administration <b>of</b> <b>John</b> <b>F.</b> <b>Kennedy</b> from 1961 to 1963, and the administration of Lyndon B. Johnson in 1963.|$|E
5|$|Deighton {{authored}} two television scripts, {{the first}} of which was Long Past Glory in 1963; he also wrote a film script, Oh! What a Lovely War (1969). His long-held interest in cooking—his mother had been a professional chef and instilled a love for cuisine in her son—led to an illustrated cookery column in the Sunday newspaper, The Observer, for two years. The work was collected into two later books, Len Deighton's Action Cookbook and Où est le garlic (both 1965); he subsequently wrote several other cookery books. Deighton has produced several other works of non-fiction, including a study of the assassination <b>of</b> <b>John</b> <b>F.</b> <b>Kennedy,</b> a history of the airship, Second World War military history and a short e-book about James Bond.|$|E

5|$|The {{aircraft}} flying as Korean Air Lines Flight 007 was {{a commercial}} Boeing 747-230B. The jet first flew on January 28, 1972, and was delivered on March 17, 1972, with {{the serial number}} CN20559/186 and registration HL7442 (formerly D-ABYH operated by Condor). The aircraft departed Gate 15 <b>of</b> <b>John</b> <b>F.</b> <b>Kennedy</b> International Airport, New York City on August 30, 1983, bound for Gimpo International Airport in Gangseo District, Seoul, 35 minutes behind its scheduled departure time of 23:50 EDT (03:50 UTC, August 31). The flight was carrying 246 passengers and 23 crew members. After refueling at Anchorage International Airport in Anchorage, Alaska, the aircraft, piloted on this leg of the journey by captain Chun Byung-in, first officer Son Dong-hui and Flight Engineer Kim Eui-dong, departed for Seoul at 04:00 AHDT (13:00UTC) on August 31, 1983.|$|E
5|$|Several {{stations}} {{along the}} line also have provisions for other extensions {{as part of the}} IND Second System. The Roosevelt Avenue station has an additional upper level platform and bellmouth provisions east of the station, which would have gone to a Queens crosstown line to the Rockaways. The 63rd Drive station has similar bellmouths, which would have fed directly into the inactive portion of the Long Island Rail Road's former Rockaway Beach Branch near its former junction with the LIRR Main Line (Whitepot Junction). One stop west, the Woodhaven Boulevard station has provisions to be converted into an express station. East of the Briarwood station, there were additional trackways built for an extension down Van Wyck Boulevard (today the Van Wyck Expressway) to Rockaway Boulevard, near the current site <b>of</b> <b>John</b> <b>F.</b> <b>Kennedy</b> International Airport. None of these proposals were ever funded, and only the Briarwood bellmouths were used for future expansion, while the Rockaway line was connected instead to the IND Fulton Street Line.|$|E
