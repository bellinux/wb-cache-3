40|$|Female stress urinary {{incontinence}} (SUI) is being treated successfully with placement of tension-free vagi-nal tape. 1 The use of synthetic mesh in renal transplant pa-tients is rarely reported. No case of surgical treatment of SUI in a renal transplant patient using transobturator suburethral tape is listed on MEDLINE. The transobturator tape technique is a minimally invasive procedure that avoids the retropubic space by inserting a tension-free syn-thetic mesh underneath {{the middle of the}} urethra between the <b>obturator</b> <b>foramens.</b> 2 DESCRIPTION OF THE CASE A 56 -year-old female presented with stress urinary in-continence for 2 months. She complained about episodes of urinary leaks during coughing or physical exercise re-quiring the use of 1 to 3 pads per day with a severe im-pact on her quality of life. No dysuria, urgency, nocturia, or sensation of postvoid residual urine was reported. She had 3 vaginal deliveries, an appendectomy 40 years pre-viously, and a renal transplantation in left iliac fossa 6 years previously to treat end-stage renal disease due to hypertension.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{describe}} a new sling procedure for treating {{stress urinary incontinence}} (SUI) after radical prostatectomy (RP) and prospectively evaluate its short-term safety and efficacy. METHODS: The sling technique uses specific instruments and a polypropylene mesh with two arms that are passed inside to outside through the <b>obturator</b> <b>foramens,</b> pulled for compressing the bulbar urethra upward, and tied to {{each other across the}} midline. Patients with detrusor overactivity were excluded. Baseline and follow-up evaluations included uroflowmetry and continence and quality of life (QoL) questionnaires. Cure was defined by no pad use and improvement by a number of pads/d 5 pads/d, respectively. The procedure was preceded by an endoscopic urethrotomy in four patients. No perioperative complication was noted; three patients required suprapubic catheterization. At 6 mo, nine (45 %) patients were cured and eight others (40 %) were improved (1 pad/d). QoL was significantly enhanced and 80 % of patients were moderately to completely satisfied with the procedure. Preoperative and postoperative maximum flow rate and postvoid residual values were not statistically different.

40|$|Objectives: To {{describe}} a new, simple surgical technique {{for the treatment}} of female stress urinary incontinence (SUI) and to evaluate its feasibility. Methods: We have developed a novel surgical treatment of SUI, the transobturator inside-out tension-free urethral suspension, which uses specifically designed surgical tools, and in which a synthetic tape is passed from underneath the urethra, through the <b>obturator</b> <b>foramens,</b> towards the thigh folds, without entering the pelvic region {{at any time during the}} procedure. The tape is positioned without tension under the junction between mid and distal urethra. Results: The procedure was carried out in 107 consecutive patients (mean age: 62 years) using the same operative protocol in all case subjects, independently of the patient’s size and weight. Mean operative time was 14 min (range: 7 – 20) in case of isolated SUI treatment. No bladder or urethral injuries and no vascular (hematoma or bleeding) or neurological complications were encountered. Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that our novel transobturator inside-out surgical technique for treating SUI is feasible, accurate, and quick. This technique avoids damage to the urethra and bladder and, therefore, makes cystoscopy not necessary. Further prospective studies are currently ongoing to determine the efficacy of our new surgical approach for treating SUI...|$|R
25|$|The lumbar plexus {{is formed}} lateral to the {{intervertebral}} foramina by the ventral rami {{of the first}} four lumbar spinal nerves (L1-L4), which all pass through psoas major. The larger branches of the plexus exit the muscle to pass sharply downward to reach the abdominal wall and the thigh (under the inguinal ligament); {{with the exception of}} the obturator nerve which pass through the lesser pelvis to reach the medial part of the thigh through the <b>obturator</b> <b>foramen.</b> The nerves of the lumbar plexus pass in front of the hip joint and mainly support the anterior part of the thigh.|$|E
2500|$|The ventral hip muscles {{function}} as lateral rotators and {{play an important}} role in the control of the body's balance. Because they are stronger than the medial rotators, in the normal position of the leg, the apex of the foot is pointing outward to achieve better support. The obturator internus originates on the pelvis on the <b>obturator</b> <b>foramen</b> and its membrane, passes through the lesser sciatic foramen, and is inserted on the trochanteric fossa of the femur. [...] "Bent" [...] over the lesser sciatic notch, which acts as a fulcrum, the muscle forms the strongest lateral rotators of the hip together with the gluteus maximus and quadratus femoris. When sitting with the knees flexed it acts as an abductor. The obturator externus has a parallel course with its origin located on the posterior border of the <b>obturator</b> <b>foramen.</b> It is covered by several muscles and acts as a lateral rotator and a weak adductor. The inferior and superior gemelli represent marginal heads of the obturator internus and assist this muscle. The three muscles have been referred to as the triceps coxae. The quadratus femoris originates at the ischial tuberosity and is inserted onto the intertrochanteric crest between the trochanters.

40|$|A new {{surgical}} technique, the inside-out transobturator tension-free urethral suspension (TVT-Obturator), {{has been}} developed for treatment of women suffering from stress urinary incontinence (SUI). This simple procedure uses specifically designed surgical instruments to allow the accurate passage of a synthetic tape from underneath the urethra, through the <b>obturator</b> <b>foramens,</b> toward the thigh folds, with the tape being positioned without tension under the junction between mid and distal urethra. Cadaver dissection {{studies have demonstrated that}} the anatomical trajectory of the tape in tissues is strictly perineal and consistently coursed away from neighboring neurovascular structures, including the obturator, femoral, and saphenous nerves and vessels, as well as the pudendal nerve. Consequently, as opposed to retropubic sling systems, no perioperative cystoscopy is required because the TVT-O tape does not enter the pelvic region {{at any time during the}} procedure. These anatomical data, which suggest the TVT-O technique is safe, have been corroborated by initial clinical experience. Our feasibility and ongoing efficacy studies have shown that TVT-O is associated with a low incidence of perioperative and postoperative complications. In our current series of more than 500 consecutive patients treated with TVT-O, no injury to the bladder or urethra was encountered and no perineal or obturator hematoma, heavy bleeding, or neurological complication was observed. Medium-term results have suggested that TVT-O is as efficient as retropubic tension-free slings for treatment of female SUI, with +/- 90 % complete cure rates after one-year follow up.

40|$|Introduction and objective: Sling {{procedures}} are currently re-emerging as an attractive {{alternative to the}} artificial urinary sphincter {{for the treatment of}} post-radical prostatectomy (RP) stress urinary incontinence (SUI), given that they are inexpensive, nonmechanical and allow for physiological voiding without significant obstruction. The aim {{of this study was to}} describe a novel transobturator sling procedure for treating post-RP SUI, and to prospectively evaluate its short-term safety and efficacy. Methods: The inside-out transobturator sling technique used specific instruments and a polypropylene mesh with 2 arms that were passed inside to outside through the <b>obturator</b> <b>foramens,</b> pulled for compressing the bulbar urethra upward, and then tied to each other across the midline. Perioperative dual channel urodynamic studies were repeated until tension on both arms of the mesh increased abdominal leak point pressure to approximately 100 cm H 2 O. The two mesh arms were then tied to each other for maintaining bulbar urethra compression. Patients with detrusor overactivity were excluded. Baseline and followup evaluations included uroflowmetry, and continence, quality of life (QoL), and satisfaction questionnaires. Cure was defined by no pad use and improvement by a number of pads/day ≤ 2 and reduced by at least 50 %. Complications were recorded. The video also illustrates anatomic and physiopathologic differences between male and pelvis in relation with transobturator tapes. Results: From April 2006 through February 2007, 20 consecutive patients suffering from post-RP SUI underwent the sling procedure using the same operative protocol. Preoperatively, 3 (15 %), 11 (55 %), and 6 (25 %) patients were using 2, 3 to 5, and more than 5 pads/day, respectively. The procedure was preceded by an endoscopic urethrotomy in 4 patients. No perioperative complication was noted; 3 patients required suprapubic catheterization. At 6 months, 9 (45 %) patients were cured and 8 others (40 %) were improved (1 pad/day).

40|$|Hypothesis / aims {{of study}} The {{aim of this}} study was to prospectively {{evaluate}} the short-term safety and efficacy of the inside-out transobturator sling procedure for treating post-radical prostatectomy (RP) stress urinary incontinence (SUI). Study design, materials and methods The sling technique uses specific instruments and a polypropylene mesh with 2 arms that are passed inside to outside through the <b>obturator</b> <b>foramens,</b> pulled for compressing the bulbar urethra upward, and tied to each other across the midline. Intra-operative urodynamic evaluation is performed to record the urethral pressure profile (UPP) and to measure the abdominal leak point pressure (ALPP) and maximal urethral pressure (MUP) before and after sling tensioning. Urodynamic measurements are repeated until tension on both arms of the mesh increases ALPP to approximately 100 cm H 2 O. In case of associated urethral stenosis, classic endoscopic urethrotomy is performed first. Inclusion criteria were clinically and urodynamically demonstrated SUI, positive bulbar compression test, and signed informed consent. Patients with detrusor overactivity or active urinary infection were excluded. Baseline evaluation included detailed history, physical examination with a bulbar urethra compression test, urine analysis, multichannel urodynamics, administration of self-questionnaires assessing urinary continence (questions 1 through 3 of the urinary section of the UCLA-PCI-SF questionnaire (1)) and quality of life (QoL) (Ditrovie questionnaire (2)), flexible urethrocystoscopy, and urethrocystography. The degree of incontinence was arbitrarily categorized as mild (1 – 2 pads/day), moderate (3 – 5 pads/day) or severe (> 5 pads/day), as previously described (3). Follow-up evaluation at 1, 6, 12 months, and yearly thereafter included physical examination, uroflowmetry with PVR measurement, and administration of the self-questionnaires assessing urinary continence and QoL. All patients were also asked to self-evaluate their satisfaction with the treatment. Cure was defined by no pad use and improvement by a number of pads/day ≤ 2 and reduced by at least 50 %. Peri- and post-operative complications were recorded. Results From April 2006 through March 2009, 95 consecutive patients who fulfilled inclusion and exclusion criteria underwent the sling procedure using the same operative protocol. As of March 2009, 58 patients who consecutively underwent the sling procedure were expected to have a minimum follow-up of 1 year. Mean age of the patients was 67. 6 ± 6. 5 years (range 52 - 79). Mean body mass index was 27. 0 ± 3. 6 (range 21. 3 – 39. 0). Of the 58 patients, 9 (16 %) patients had undergone prior surgery for SUI: bulking agent injection in 5 patients, prior sling implantation in 1 patient and artificial urinary sphincter (AUS) implantation in 4 patients. A previous urethrotomy or urethral dilatation for urethral stenosis had been performed in 8 (14 %) patients and 8 (14 %) patients had had pelvic irradiation. Preoperatively, 14 (24 %), 26 (45 %), and 18 (31 %) patients were using 2 (mild SUI), 3 to 5 (moderate SUI), and > 5 pads/day (severe SUI), respectively. The sling procedure was performed under general and spinal anesthesia in 22 (38 %) and 36 (62 %) patients, respectively, and was preceded by an endoscopic urethrotomy in 5 (9 %) patients. Penile prostheses were implanted concomitantly to the sling in 2 patients. Before sling tensioning, mean MUP and ALPP were 40 ± 21 cm H 2 O (range 5 - 101) and 45 ± 22 cm H 2 O (range 10 - 100). After sling tensioning, mean MUP and ALPP were 89 ± 24 cm H 2 O (range 44 - 141) and 109 ± 26 cm H 2 O (range 60 - 165). Mean increase in MUP and ALPP between post- and pre-tensioning of the sling was 49 ± 29 cm H 2 O (range 1 - 125) and 64 ± 32 cm H 2 O (range 20 - 135), respectively. Mean operative time was 65 ± 18 minutes. No intra-operative complication was noted. Seven (12 %) patients required suprapubic catheterization; normal voiding resumed in all 7 patients except 1 who underwent urinary diversion for complete radiation-induced anastomotic stenosis. Mild perineal hematoma not requiring therapy was observed in 6 patients. Six-month and 1 -year minimum follow-up was available on 54 (93 %) and 56 (96 %) of the 58 patients, respectively (Table 1). Two patients were completely lost to follow-up after the 1 -month visit. At this 1 -month visit, one patient was cured while the other was improved. Table 1.

In addition, SUI cure/improvement rates appeared to be similar at the 6 and 12 months time points. The 3 failures included one patient who had undergone post-RP radiation therapy. This man later developed a complete urethral anastomotic closure and underwent cystectomy with transileal ureterostomy 9 months after the sling procedure. The two other failed patients had a vesico-urethral anastomotic stricture before sling implantation. Both patients were implanted with an AUS after the sling procedure. After cutting the mesh arms laterally to the bulb, the AUS cuff was placed without difficulty around the bulbar urethra. The 4 th failed patient had undergone previous radiation therapy and had a bulbar urethral stenosis. He is now wearing penile collectors. The 5 th patient had a vesico-urethral stenosis that underwent urethrotomy just before the sling implantation. The patient has been offered the placement of an artificial urinary sphincter. Preoperative and postoperative max flow rate and postvoid residual values were not different (Table 2). Overall, QoL was substantially enhanced and 85 % patients were satisfied with the procedure. Table 2. Postoperative evolution of QoL scores and voiding parameters QoL and voiding parameters	Baseline (mean ± SD [range]) 	 6 -month visit (mean ± SD [range]) 	 1 -year visit (mean ± SD [range]) Ditrovie QoL scores (scale from 10 [best] to 50 [worst]) 	 32 ± 7 (17 - 50) 	 16 ± 8 (10 - 40) 	 17 ± 8 (10 - 42) Max flow rate (mL/sec) 	 20 ± 9 (6 - 46) 	 18 ± 9 (6 - 44) 	 17 ± 10 (4 - 51) Post void residual (mL) 	 17 ± 32 (0 - 160) 	 21 ± 51 (0 - 243) 	 6 ± 21 (0 - 87) No sling infection, urethra erosion, persistent pain or neurological complication was observed. No sling was withdrawn or cut. Interpretation of results The inside-out transobturator sling was associated with a minimal risk of intra- and post-operative complications. Postoperative SUI cure/improvement rates were found to remain stable over a 1 -year period. The sling procedure appeared to be efficient at short term even in the group of patients with severe SUI before surgery. The sling procedure does not compromise concomitant penile prostheses or subsequent AUS implantation. Longer follow-up times are required to determine the long-term efficacy of this sling procedure. Concluding message The one-year results of this prospective study suggest that the inside-out transobturator sling is a safe and efficient surgical procedure at short term for the treatment of post-RP SUI.
