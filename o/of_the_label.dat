40|$|Two {{different}} types of wrinkles in beer bottle labels are studied namely wrinkling due to <b>the</b> <b>labeling</b> process and wrinkles due to expansion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> paper as consequence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moisture in <b>the</b> <b>labels.</b> Four problems are considered, namely, <b>the</b> geometry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>labelling</b> process, <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> wrinkles related to physical qualities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> paper, <b>the</b> spreading <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glue and removal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>labels.</b> An optimal speed was found for <b>the</b> <b>labelling</b> process. <b>The</b> group evaluated <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> distance between the glue strips both for wrinkle constraint and removal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>labels.</b> <b>The</b> group also investigated <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> angle between the preferential expansion direction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> paper and the glue strips and showed that the glue strips should be perpendicular to the fibres in the paper...|$|R

This problem is known as map-labeling with uniform circular pairs (MLUCP) and {{has been shown to}} be NP-hard. In this paper, we give an O(n log n) time, O(n) space algorithm that computes a <b>labeling,</b> such that <b>the</b> diameter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> circular <b>labels</b> in an optimum solution is no more than (1 + √ 33) / 4 ≈ 1. 686 times <b>the</b> diameter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>labels</b> computed by our algorithm. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|This thesis {{involves}} <b>the</b> characterisation <b>of</b> Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes when covalently {{linked to}} proteins and {{a study of}} their propensity to monitor conformational variances which these proteins undergo in solution. In <b>the</b> first section <b>of</b> this thesis, <b>the</b> Ru(II) complexes are covalently bound to various synthetic and natural proteins via selected binding sites on the biomolecules, and these protein-bound labels are extensively characterised via the spectroscopic and luminescent properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>labels.</b> Thereafter, these proteinbound labels are employed as spectroscopic probes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conformational changes which the bound proteins undergo in solution via variations in <b>the</b> photophysical properties <b>of</b> these labels found to accompany structural changes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proteins. Although <b>the</b> emission spectra <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>labels</b> are somewhat sensitive to <b>the</b> conformational properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bound protein, the decay lifetimes {{were found to be}} the most sensitive reporter, due to their sensitivity to their local environment. The a-helix to random coil transition of poly-amino acids were thereby probed by changes in <b>the</b> decay lifetimes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>labels.</b> This section also investigates <b>the</b> potential <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decay lifetime <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>labels</b> as a probe <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unfolding process <b>of</b> natural proteins. Investigations into <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> a number of parameters (i. e. label type and position on protein, temperature, chemical denaturants) on <b>the</b> probing potential <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>labels</b> were carried out. The final section involves <b>the</b> <b>labelling</b> <b>of</b> an enzyme with the same Ru(II) complexes. Firstly, <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>labelling</b> on <b>the</b> activity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> enzyme was studied to determine <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> such modification on the natural conformational properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> enzyme. Correlation between <b>the</b> acid-induced loss <b>of</b> activity (i. e denaturation) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> enzyme and changes in <b>the</b> decay lifetimes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>labels</b> were found suggesting <b>the</b> potential application <b>of</b> such fluorescent complexes as probes in real biological matrices without adverse effects on <b>the</b> natural characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system...|$|R
