50|$|In gemology, aventurescence (sometimes called aventurization) is an <b>optical</b> <b>reflectance</b> effect seen {{in certain}} gems. The effect {{amounts to a}} {{metallic}} glitter, arising from minute, preferentially oriented mineral platelets within the material. These platelets are so numerous that they also influence the material's body colour. In aventurine quartz chrome-bearing fuchsite produces a green stone, and various iron oxides produce a red stone.|$|E

Thin films were prepared by spin coating technique. During the influenece of humidity electrical conductivity increases. Sorption and desorption and the changes in electrical properties under the repated humidity exposure were investigated as well. Impedance spectroscopy was used for the studies.

50|$|The {{original}} detection mechanism used in picosecond ultrasonics {{is based}} on the photoelastic effect. The refractive index and extinction coefficient near the surface of the solid are perturbed by the returning strain pulses (within the optical absorption depth of the probe light), resulting in changes in the <b>optical</b> <b>reflectance</b> or transmission. The measured temporal echo shape results from a spatial integral involving both the probe light optical absorption profile and the strain pulse spatial profile (see below).|$|E
5000|$|In gemology, chatoyancy ( [...] ), or chatoyance or cat's eye effect, is an <b>optical</b> <b>reflectance</b> effect seen {{in certain}} gemstones. Coined from the French [...] "œil de chat", meaning [...] "cat's eye", chatoyancy arises {{either from the}} fibrous {{structure}} of a material, as in tiger's eye quartz, or from fibrous inclusions or cavities within the stone, as in cat's eye chrysoberyl. [...] The precipitates that cause chatoyance in chrysoberyl are the mineral rutile, composed mostly of titanium dioxide. Examined samples have yielded no evidence of tubes or fibres. The rutile precipitates all align perpendicularly with respect to cat's eye effect. It is reasoned that the lattice parameter of the rutile matches {{only one of the}} three orthorhombic crystal axes of the chrysoberyl, resulting in preferred alignment along that direction.|$|E

40|$|The {{information}} from spectral reflectance of articular cartilage has {{been related to}} the integrity of the tissue. This study explores more in detail the interrelations between the cartilage composition, structure and mechanical properties, and <b>optical</b> spectral <b>reflectance.</b> Using human osteochondral samples the reflectance spectral images of articular cartilage were captured and analyzed by using CIELAB color space as well as principal component analysis. With both analysis methods statistically significant correlations were observed between the reflectance and histological integrity, as assessed by Mankin scoring, tissue proteoglycan content and dynamic modulus. In thick human cartilage, the reflectance was found to be independent of the cartilage thickness, suggesting negligible influence of the underlying subchondral bone. Based on the present results diagnostically relevant information on cartilage quality can be extracted using <b>optical</b> spectral <b>reflectance</b> measurements. These measurements could be feasible during arthroscopic surgery when more in-depth information of the properties of articular cartilage is needed...|$|R

[...] It is formed from the parent compound of CrO2 by means of one of two processes. The first process for the conversion of CrO2 into CrOOH occurs through a reduction of CrO2 {{in the presence of}} H2O and a reductant (oxalic acid or steel) resulting in the chemical equation of (2CrO2 + H2O → 2CrO(OH) + ½O2). The second process is an oxidation of the chromium ion using a solution as a solvent. Such a reaction is represented by the chemical equation (3CrO2 + 2NaOH → Na2CrO4 + 2CrO(OH)).|$|E
