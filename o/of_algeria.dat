5|$|From the French {{invasion}} on 18 June 1830 {{until its}} independence, Algeria was administratively part of France, and its European population was simply called Algerians or colons (colonists), whereas the Muslim people <b>of</b> <b>Algeria</b> were called Arabs, Muslims or Indigenous.|$|E
5|$|In 1959, the Pieds-Noirs {{numbered}} 1,025,000, {{and accounted}} for 10.4% {{of the total population}} <b>of</b> <b>Algeria,</b> a percentage gradually diminishing since the peak of 15.2% in 1926. However, some areas <b>of</b> <b>Algeria</b> had high concentrations of Pieds-Noirs, such as the regions of Bône (now Annaba), Algiers, and above all the area from Oran to Sidi-Bel-Abbès. Oran had been under European rule since the 17th century, and the population in the Oran metropolitan area was 49.3% European and Jewish in 1959. In the Algiers metropolitan area, Europeans and Jewish people accounted for 35.7% of the population. In the metropolitan area of Bône they accounted for 40.5% of the population. The département of Oran, a rich European-developed agricultural land of 16,520km² (6,378 sq. miles) stretching between the cities of Oran and Sidi-Bel-Abbès, and including them, was the area of highest Pied-Noir density outside of the cities, with the Pieds-Noirs accounting for 33.6% {{of the population of the}} département in 1959.|$|E
5|$|After the French conquest <b>of</b> <b>Algeria,</b> Abdelkader El Djezairi {{declared}} war against France, and requested assistance from Sultan Abd al-Rahman of Morocco. When the Sultan responded favorably, it triggered the Franco-Moroccan War. France sent warships to bombard Tangier on 6 August 1844, destroying {{large parts of}} the city and its defenses. The French then bombarded Essaouira, and occupied the Iles Purpuraires. After the French army defeated the Moroccan cavalry at the Battle of Isly on 14 August 1844, Sultan Abd al-Rahman asked for peace with France, leading to the signing of the Treaty of Tangier on 10 September 1844. Morocco's defeat caused a revolt in Rabat; in Salé, the city's nobility, known as the Sharif, {{sent a letter to the}} Sultan complaining about the lack of weapons and ammunition in the city.|$|E
50|$|By 2013 the American {{historian}} Dr. Niki Gamm {{argued that}} {{the total population of}} Turkish origin remains unclear and that estimates range between 5-10% <b>of</b> <b>Algeria's</b> population <b>of</b> 37 million (accounting to between 1.85 million and 3.7 million) However, by 2015 the Russian government-controlled news agency Sputnik, citing the 2014 Algerian population statistics, reported that there are 760,000 people of full Turkish origin (i.e. 2% <b>of</b> <b>Algeria's</b> population), whilst those of full and partial Turkish origin account to 9.5 million <b>of</b> <b>Algeria's</b> 38 million inhabitants (i.e. 25% <b>of</b> <b>Algeria's</b> population).|$|R
50|$|North American audiences have {{remained}} {{for the most}} part unaware <b>of</b> <b>Algeria's</b> cinematographic experience. Following the nationalization <b>of</b> <b>Algeria's</b> film industry in June 1969, the American Motion Pictures Export Association of America (MPEAA) called for a boycott of all Algerian productions.|$|R

5|$|At the queen's villa in Algiers, Ranavalona was {{provided}} with servants and a French female attendant who kept her under observation and remained present whenever the queen entertained guests in her home. In addition, {{the government of}} France initially provided Ranavalona with an annual allowance of 25,000 francs paid from the budget for the colony of Madagascar and authorized by the colony's Governor General. Nearly all the queen's property had been seized by the colonial authority, although she had been permitted to keep certain personal belongings, including some of her jewelry. Her initial pension allowed such a humble lifestyle that the colonial government <b>of</b> <b>Algeria</b> lobbied unsuccessfully several times on her behalf to obtain an increase for her. Ranavalona also tasked a servant with selling some of her jewelry for cash, but the plan was discovered by the French colonial authorities and the servant was discharged and sent back to Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|Edgar Quinet {{continued}} her {{service in the}} eastern Mediterranean {{after the end of}} the war in 1918. During the culmination of the Greco-Turkish War that immediately followed World War I, Edgar Quinet rescued 1,200 people from the Great Fire of Smyrna in 1922. In 1925, Edgar Quinet was converted into a training ship. The work lasted until 1927, and included the reduction of her armament to ten of her 194mm guns, the removal of two of her funnels, and a reconstruction of her bridge. Then-Captain François Darlan commanded the ship in 1928. In 1929, Edgar Quinet underwent an overhaul; during this modernization she was fitted with equipment to handle floatplanes for reconnaissance purposes. After returning to service, the ship was assigned as a training ship for cadets from the École Navale (Naval Academy). On 4 January 1930, Edgar Quinet ran aground off the coast <b>of</b> <b>Algeria</b> west of Oran and proved to be a total loss. She sank five days later.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s and the 1960s, Paris {{became one}} {{front of the}} Algerian War for independence; in August 1961, the pro-independence FLN {{targeted}} and killed 11 Paris policemen, leading to {{the imposition of a}} curfew on Muslims <b>of</b> <b>Algeria</b> (who, at that time, were French citizens). On 17 October 1961, an unauthorised but peaceful protest demonstration of Algerians against the curfew led to violent confrontations between the police and demonstrators, in which at least 40 people were killed, including some thrown into the Seine. The anti-independence Organisation armée secrète (OAS), for their part, carried out a series of bombings in Paris throughout 1961 and 1962.|$|E

5000|$|... 2008 {{estimates}} of the Turkish community in Algeria range from 600,000 to 2 million. In 1953, Sabri Hizmetli claimed that people of Turkish origin make up 25% <b>of</b> <b>Algeria's</b> population. However, in 2008, the Oxford Business Group gave a more prudent estimate, according to its report, 5% <b>of</b> <b>Algeria's</b> population, accounting to about 1,740,000 people, are of Turkish descent.|$|R

5|$|The 1500m and mile run {{events have}} {{historically}} been {{some of the most}} prestigious track and field events. Swedish rivals Gunder Hägg and Arne Andersson broke each other's 1500m and mile world records {{on a number of occasions}} in the 1940s. The prominence of the distances were maintained by Roger Bannister, who (in 1954) was the first to run the long-elusive four-minute mile, and Jim Ryun's exploits served to popularise interval training. Races between British rivals Sebastian Coe, Steve Ovett and Steve Cram characterised middle-distance running in the 1980s. From the 1990s onwards, North Africans such as Noureddine Morceli <b>of</b> <b>Algeria</b> and Hicham El Guerrouj of Morocco came to dominate the 1500 and mile events.|$|E
5|$|With {{the spread}} of {{decolonization}} in the 1960s, the organization's membership saw an influx of newly independent nations. In 1960 alone, 17 new states joined the UN, 16 of them from Africa. On 25 October 1971, with opposition from the United States, but {{with the support of}} many Third World nations, the mainland, communist People's Republic of China was given the Chinese seat on the Security Council in place of the Republic of China that occupied Taiwan; the vote was widely seen as a sign of waning US influence in the organization. Third World nations organized into the Group of 77 coalition under the leadership <b>of</b> <b>Algeria,</b> which briefly became a dominant power at the UN. In 1975, a bloc comprising the USSR and Third World nations passed a resolution, over strenuous US and Israeli opposition, declaring Zionism to be racism; the resolution was repealed in 1991, shortly {{after the end of the}} Cold War.|$|E
5|$|At 09:30 on 2 May, Oan {{appeared}} at the first-floor window of the embassy to demand access to the telex system, which the police had disabled along with the telephone lines, and threatened to kill Abdul Fazi Ezzati, the cultural attaché. The police refused and Oan pushed Ezzati, who he had been holding at gunpoint at the window, across the room, before demanding to speak to somebody from the BBC who knew Sim Harris. The police, relieved to have a demand to which they could easily agree, produced Tony Crabb, managing director of BBC Television News and Harris's boss. Oan shouted his demands—for safe passage out of the UK, to be negotiated by three ambassadors from Arab countries—to Crabb from the first-floor window, and instructed {{that they should be}} broadcast along with a statement of the hostage-takers' aims by the BBC. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office informally approached the embassies <b>of</b> <b>Algeria,</b> Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Syria and Qatar to ask if their ambassadors would be willing to talk to the hostage-takers. The Jordanian ambassador immediately refused and the other five said they would consult their governments. The BBC broadcast the statement that evening, but in a form unsatisfactory to Oan, who considered it to be truncated and incorrect.|$|E

5|$|MalcolmX {{had already}} visited the United Arab Republic (a {{short-lived}} political union between Egypt and Syria), Sudan, Nigeria, and Ghana in 1959 {{to make arrangements}} for a tour of Africa by Elijah Muhammad. After his journey to Mecca in 1964, he visited Africa a second time. He returned to the United States in late May and flew to Africa again in July. During these visits he met officials, gave interviews, and spoke {{on radio and television}} in Egypt, Ethiopia, Tanganyika, Nigeria, Ghana, Guinea, Sudan, Senegal, Liberia, Algeria, and Morocco. In Cairo, he attended the second meeting of the Organization of African Unity {{as a representative of the}} Organization of Afro-American Unity. By the end of this third visit, he had met with essentially all of Africa's prominent leaders; Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana, Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt, and Ahmed Ben Bella <b>of</b> <b>Algeria</b> had all invited MalcolmX to serve in their governments. After he spoke at the University of Ibadan, the Nigerian Muslim Students Association bestowed on him the honorary Yoruba name Omowale ("the son who has come home"). He later called this his most treasured honor.|$|E
5|$|This effusive {{display of}} respect and remembrance {{on the part of}} Ranavalona's friends was not {{mirrored}} by subsequent actions of the French colonial administration in Madagascar. In June 1925, eight years after the queen's death, the Governor-General <b>of</b> <b>Algeria</b> informed the Governor-General of Madagascar by letter that payments for the maintenance of Ranavalona's tomb were in default. He urged the colonial government in Madagascar to provide funds for the upkeep of the dilapidated tomb, emphasizing that such neglect was unworthy of the queen's memory and the government of France alike. The request was twice refused and the tomb was never refurbished. In November 1938, Ranavalona's remains were exhumed and re-interred in the tomb of Queen Rasoherina at the Rova of Antananarivo in Madagascar. A fire on the night of 6 November 1995 severely damaged the royal tombs and destroyed most of the other buildings at the site. The lamba-wrapped remains of Ranavalona III were the only ones that could be saved from the flames. These have since been re-interred in the royal tombs at Ambohimanga.|$|E

25|$|Following the French capture <b>of</b> <b>Algeria</b> (1833), {{that region}} saw several waves of Catalan-speaking settlers. People from the Spanish Alacant {{province}} settled around Oran, whereas Algiers received immigration from Northern Catalonia and Menorca. Their speech {{was known as}} patuet. By 1911, the number of Catalan speakers was around 100,000. After {{the declaration of independence}} <b>of</b> <b>Algeria</b> in 1962, almost all the Catalan speakers fled to Northern Catalonia (as Pieds-Noirs) or Alacant.|$|E
25|$|The latter {{stresses}} the obtainment {{and protection of}} land and passageways that promise commercial wealth.

Direct control of the political operations of the entirety <b>of</b> <b>Algeria,</b> however, was not. Thus the author stresses domination over only certain points of political influence {{as a means to}} colonization of commercially valuable areas.|$|E
