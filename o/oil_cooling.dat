5|$|In 1992, Caltrans {{released}} the first feasibility study detailing {{the possibility of}} electrifying the railroad between San Francisco and San Jose. The 1992 Feasibility Study proposed replacing the existing diesel-electric locomotives with either a fleet of EMD AEM-7 electric locomotives to move the existing gallery passenger cars or Metro North Budd M-2/M-4 EMUs. The primary benefits of an electrified railway would be improvements in air quality, noise, and acceleration, but would also save on other ancillary costs, such as lubricating <b>oil,</b> <b>cooling</b> water, maintenance, and refueling. Because of the relatively close spacing between stops, the improved acceleration using electric locomotives compared to the existing diesel-electric locomotives would cut transit time between San Francisco and San Jose by up to twelve minutes, and using EMUs would cut the time over the same distance by up to 23 minutes, assuming the use of ten-car trainsets. The 1992 Feasibility Study recommended the use of electric locomotives and 25kV AC overhead lines as the most cost-effective alternative, since the gallery cars, which had been built in 1985, were then relatively new and could be reused.|$|E

5000|$|A minor {{problem was}} the oil hose from {{the lower part of}} the engine to the <b>oil</b> <b>cooler.</b> This was too short since a running engine was moving {{separate}} from the <b>oil</b> <b>cooler.</b> This hose was almost solid being under pressure and in time the <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> would crack. This was solved by connecting the oil hoses for the <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> to and from the engine [...] "up side down" [...] to make the lower hose, now connecting to the top of the <b>oil</b> <b>cooler,</b> longer and movable.|$|R

25|$|Not until 1927 {{were there}} once again plans for {{conversion}} to electric operations. Now, however, high tension alternating current, at a frequency of 16 Hz, {{was to be}} used. This offered, amongst other things, the advantage of requiring only one electrical insertion point, near Visp, which would drastically reduce the costs of electrical systems {{in comparison with the}} original plans. Consideration was also given to adopting completely the SBB current system at 15,000 volts without alteration, but that idea quickly had to be abandoned. In particular, the Rhätische Bahn, which since 1913 had been operating electric traffic at 11,000 volts AC on the Engadine Line, stressed the benefits of using lower voltage than the SBB voltage. Whereas light weight air cooled transformers could be used on the Engadine Line, a heavy <b>oil</b> <b>cooling</b> system would be necessary for 15,000 volt operations, and that would greatly have increased the weight of the VZ locomotives. Additionally, the use of a single phase current system would make problem free through traffic possible in the event of electrification of the Furka Oberalp Bahn. These advantages led to the decision to use a voltage of 11,000 volts also on the Visp-Zermatt-Bahn.|$|E

50|$|The {{reasons for}} this complex system were threefold. One was to {{eliminate}} any extra aerodynamic drag that a protruding <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> would produce, in this case eliminating the extra drag factor by enclosing it within the engine's forward cowling. The second was to warm the air before it flowed to the oil cooler's circular-shaped core to aid warming the oil during starting. Finally, by placing the <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> behind the fan, cooling was provided even while the aircraft was parked. The downside to this design was that the <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> was in an extremely vulnerable location, and the metal ring was increasingly armoured as the war progressed.|$|R

5000|$|... / - The {{sources of}} the main issues with the 6.0L were the {{in-block}} <b>oil</b> <b>cooler,</b> and the EGR <b>cooler</b> materials. The <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> {{is located in the}} valley of the engine block, underneath the cartridge oil filter set up. The sealed outer portion of the <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> is submerged in engine oil, with coolant flowing through the center passages. Over time, the <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> will develop small cracks in the aluminum tubes from the constant heating and cooling of the engine. This situation usually results in oil pushing it's way into the cooling system. The sludge created from the mixture of oil and coolant creates a high pressure environment in the EGR cooler (due to the viscosity change in the coolant), leading to cracking of the EGR cooler's coolant passages. Once the EGR cooler cracks, it begins to leak coolant into the intake system and is then routed into the engine's cylinders to be burnt. The burning of coolant in the cylinders then causes a steam buildup, thus increasing cylinder pressures and the stretching of the head bolts; which leads to head gasket failure. The early EGR coolers (2003-2004.5) were also susceptible to pre-mature failure without <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> issues, also resulting in head gasket failure.|$|R
50|$|<b>Oil</b> <b>cooling</b> is {{commonly}} used to cool high-performance motorcycle engines that are not liquid-cooled. Typically, the cylinder barrel remains air-cooled in the traditional motorcycle fashion, but the cylinder head benefits from additional cooling. As there is already an oil circulation system available for lubrication, this oil is also piped to the cylinder head and used as a liquid coolant. Compared to an oil system used solely for lubrication, <b>oil</b> <b>cooling</b> requires additional oil capacity, a greater flow rate through the oil pump, and an oil cooler (or a larger cooler than normal).|$|E
