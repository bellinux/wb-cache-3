50|$|The inca {{appeared}} on two series of banknotes, one consisting of overprints on earlier notes, {{the other a}} regular issue. The overprinted denominations were 1 real de inca, surcharged <b>on</b> <b>old</b> 1 sol notes, 5 reales de inca, stamped <b>on</b> <b>old</b> 5 soles notes, and 100 centavos de inca (i.e., 1 inca), surcharged <b>on</b> <b>old</b> 100 soles notes. The regular issue of notes was in denominations of 1, 5 and 100 incas. Some of the regular issue 5 and 10 inca notes were later surcharged with their value in soles.|$|R

5|$|On 26 May, while {{rounding}} {{the southern tip}} of Africa, Arniston separated from the convoy in bad weather after her sails were damaged. Without accurate daily longitudinal information from the other ships, Arniston had to rely instead <b>on</b> <b>older,</b> less accurate navigation methods. Navigation via dead reckoning proved particularly difficult as there were strong ocean currents combined with inclement weather that prevented a fix being obtained for several days via celestial navigation.|$|E
5|$|Since 1999, the R142, R142A, R143, R160, and R188 {{cars have}} been placed into service. These cars are collectively known as New Technology Trains (NTTs) due to modern {{innovations}} such as LED and LCD route signs and information screens, as well as recorded train announcements {{and the ability to}} facilitate Communication-Based Train Control (CBTC).

5|$|Although {{commonly}} {{included in}} botany curricula and textbooks, fungi are {{more closely related}} to animals than to plants and are placed with the animals in the monophyletic group of opisthokonts. Analyses using molecular phylogenetics support a monophyletic origin of the Fungi. The taxonomy of the Fungi {{is in a state of}} constant flux, especially due to recent research based on DNA comparisons. These current phylogenetic analyses often overturn classifications based <b>on</b> <b>older</b> and sometimes less discriminative methods based on morphological features and biological species concepts obtained from experimental matings.|$|E
5|$|At Royal Ascot, Duke of Marmalade showed {{improved}} {{form in the}} St. James's Palace Stakes. Michael Kinane {{tried to}} lead all the way on the colt-and was still in front inside the final furlong-before being caught and beaten a neck by Jamie Spencer on his stable companion Excellent Art, with another O'Brien-trained runner, Astronomer Royal in third, and Cockney Rebel in fifth. Two months later, Duke of Marmalade was moved up in distance and took <b>on</b> <b>older</b> horses {{for the first time}} in the International Stakes at York. He ran up to his best form in a highly competitive race to finish fourth behind the Derby winner Authorized, Dylan Thomas and Notnowcato.|$|E
5|$|Election Special is an American {{roots and}} blues rock album of protest songs with music {{characterized}} by upbeat melodies, simple instrumentation, and sparse arrangements. Cooder played {{all of the}} instruments, including bass, guitar, and mandolin, {{with the exception of}} drums by his son Joachim. A deeply political album, it expands on the socio-political musings and current event topics of Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down with forthright, satirical lyrics and song-form vignettes. Cooder's songwriting exhibits liberal and populist sentiments and draws <b>on</b> <b>older</b> musical sources such as broadside ballads and country blues.|$|E

Chimneys fell (especially <b>on</b> <b>older</b> {{homes in the}} {{downtown}} area of Gilroy) and glass was broken, but in Gilroy structural damage afflicted five buildings. A wall was cracked at city hall, and a court room ceiling collapsed. Damaged structural components at a Ford's Department Store forced its closure. In Hollister, a J. C. Penney had a hole and cracks in its ceiling and a parapet collapsed at a law office. At Casa de Fruta, a service station sustained structural damage, as did a fire station at Pacheco Pass.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to inscriptions, chronicles called Vamshavalis were written to provide historical details of dynasties. Writings in Sanskrit included poetry, grammar, lexicon, manuals, rhetoric, commentaries <b>on</b> <b>older</b> works, prose fiction and drama. In Kannada, writings on secular subjects became popular. Some well-known works are Chandombudhi, a prosody, and Karnataka Kadambari, a romance, both written by Nagavarma I, a lexicon called Rannakanda by Ranna (993), {{a book on}} medicine called Karnataka-Kalyanakaraka by Jagaddala Somanatha, the earliest writing on astrology called Jatakatilaka by Sridharacharya (1049), a writing on erotics called Madanakatilaka by Chandraraja, and an encyclopedia called Lokapakara by Chavundaraya II (1025).|$|E
5|$|Japanese {{reviews of}} the title have been {{generally}} positive. Famitsu generally praised several aspects, but found the item management and weapon structures confusing, saying {{that it did not}} live up to the legacy of the Mana series. Reviewing the Vita port, Famitsu praised the game's general ease of play and use of the Mana series, but the button layout was criticized. Kyōsuke Takano of AppGet praised the gameplay and graphics, noting that the game avoided the possible pitfalls of being a mobile game while delivering a strong experience. His one point of reservation was that he would have preferred the game on another platform. 4Gamer.net praised the variety of control options, the feel of gameplay, and the graphics. The writer noted that the game should be played on more advanced mobiles despite recommendations, as the graphics and performance suffered <b>on</b> <b>older</b> smartphone models.|$|E

5|$|Liverpool were unbeaten {{in their}} first ten 1969–70 Football League matches until a 1–0 loss to Manchester United. A sixth-round FA Cup loss at second {{division}} Watford convinced Shankly to move <b>on</b> <b>older</b> players. Bobby Graham had already replaced Hunt as the main striker. St John and Yeats also made their last Liverpool appearances. They exited in the early rounds of the 1969–70 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup and League Cup and finished fifth in the league behind champions Everton.|$|E
5|$|Orme {{then took}} <b>on</b> <b>older</b> {{horses in the}} {{valuable}} Lancashire Plate, where he started the 7/4 favourite. In the last few furlongs Orme challenged the four-year-old Signorina for the lead, and {{as they approached the}} main stand, Martagon challenged the pair. Orme drew level with Signorina, but the filly edged away slightly again and won an exciting race by half a length from Orme, Martagon a head back in third. Orme received £1000 for finishing second.|$|E
5|$|Parish and Shaw did {{not mention}} what time of year the {{tradition}} took place on or its geographical location. They also made no reference to a sack concealing the person carrying the horse. Doel thought it likely that neither Parish or Shaw had ever seen a hooden horse, and that instead their information was based <b>on</b> <b>older</b> written sources. He also thought it noteworthy that they described the tradition using the past tense, indicating that they considered it to be either dead or dying {{at the time of}} writing. However, Maylam believed that the information regarding the decline of the tradition was erroneous, because hoodeners were still active in St. Nicholas-at-Wade during the early twentieth century and various locals living in the area at the time could recall it taking place in the area back to the 1840s.|$|E

5|$|The American Red Cross ran out {{of funds}} while {{responding}} {{to the effects of}} Juan and the mid-Atlantic flooding, following the previous responses to hurricanes Elena and Gloria, as well as flooding in Puerto Rico; this prompted an emergency fundraising appeal. The agency had provided about $8million worth of assistance to families in southern Louisiana. Along the Apalachicola Bay, the series of hurricane strikes severely damaged the local oyster industry, leaving hundreds of oystermen out of work. The high waves caused by Juan prompted the United States Minerals Management Service to recommend increased inspections <b>on</b> <b>older</b> rigs and improve evacuation plans. Hurricane Juan was one in a series of hurricanes that struck Louisiana coast over many years that contributed to the loss of the coastal wetlands.|$|E
5|$|The {{church has}} a nave with a north aisle and vestry, a Perpendicular Gothic west tower, a chancel and a south porch. The nave was rebuilt {{in the late}} 15th or early 16th century to meet a tower of {{approximately}} the same age; it is often dated to 1521, but appears to be built <b>on</b> <b>older</b> foundations. The southern side of the nave contains what are probably thirteenth-century buttresses {{and a pair of}} Perpendicular Gothic windows. The north aisle was originally built in the 13th century, and rebuilt by H.J. Underwood in 1890; the vestry was built in the 17th century and rebuilt in 1846 to designs by Chamberlain, through the generosity of the curate, Alexander Penrose Forbes. The church has been reroofed at least twice, in 1825 and 1897.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Boletus abruptibulbus grow singly or in groups in sand. The species is known {{only from the}} Gulf Coast of the Florida Panhandle, where fruiting occurs <b>on</b> <b>older</b> sand dunes, {{particularly}} {{in areas where the}} habit changes from coastal scrub to oak-pine woods. This latter habitat is characterized by the presence of the tree species Sand Live Oak (Quercus geminata), Myrtle Oak (Q.myrtifolia), and Sand Pine (Pinus clausa). Fruiting occurs from December to March. Boletus abruptibulbus is one of only three North American Boletaceae species that occur in coastal sand dunes; the others are Leccinum arenicola, found in New Brunswick, Canada, and Phylloporus arenicola, described from Oregon.|$|E
