40|$|This {{publication}} {{deals with}} brewing beer by infusion and decoction technologies of mash production in microbreweries. Samples of two microbrewery beers are compared, namely Richard beer (Brno-Žebětín) produced {{in a double}} mash manner appropriate for the Czech brewing type, and beer samples taken at the laboratory microbrewery of Mendel University in Brno (MENDELU), where beer is produced in a simpler and less energy – demanding infusion method. At all the beer samples the basic analytical parameters of real extract, ethanol content, degree of fermentation and the extract of <b>original</b> hopped <b>wort</b> were measured using an automatic beer analyzer. The results {{coming out of the}} automatic beer analyzer are compared with the results of the beer samples analysis performed by liquid chromatography, by which the contents of oligosaccharides, maltose, glycerol and ethanol were measured. Both methods provide a number of analytical results for the comparison of decoction and infusion techniques, and analytical characteristics of both the brewing procedures. Emphasis is placed on statistical data processing and comparison of different types of beer and particular brews between each other, both in terms of production technology as well as beer sampling throughout the year...|$|R

40|$|Two {{mathematical}} {{models were}} developed {{for studying the}} effect of main fermentation temperature (TMF), immobilized cell mass (MIC) and <b>original</b> <b>wort</b> extract (OE) on beer fermentation with alginate-chitosan microcapsules with a liquid core. During the experiments, the investigated parameters were varied {{in order to find}} the optimal conditions for beer fermentation with immobilized cells. The basic beer characteristics, i. e. extract, ethanol, biomass concentration, pH and colour, as well as the concentration of aldehydes and vicinal diketones, were measured. The results suggested that the process parameters represented a powerful tool in controlling the fermentation time. Subsequently, the optimized process parameters were used to produce beer in laboratory batch fermentation. The system productivity was also investigated and the data were used for the development of another mathematical model...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{technology}} of special malts production {{that are designed}} for the beer production. Literature review focuses on the theory of malt production and the posibility of special malts production from cereals such as wheat, oat, rye or corn, that can be subsequently used for beer production. Several kinds of cereals were chosen for the experimental part of the thesis and malts were made from these cereals. The malts {{were used for the}} laboratory preparation of beer in a ratio of 50 % of special malt and 50 % of barley malt. Basic analysis were performed for the cereals and also for prepared malts (TGW, density, glassiness and extract). The brewed beer was analyzed using the FermentoFlash (alcohol content, real and apparent extract, <b>original</b> <b>wort,</b> relative density and osmotic pressure) and pH values were measured too. Finally, sensory analysis were performed. The best evaluated samples were corn and oat beer. Wheat beer got the worst evaluation...|$|E
40|$|The diploma {{thesis is}} divided into two main parts. The first part is a compilation of {{available}} publications devoted to the beer production. This theoretical summary is focused mainly on the wort fermentation and discusses important and commonly used brewing yeast strains of the bottom and top fermentation. Moreover, the metabolism of yeast cells, resources essential to their life cycle and compounds that occur in the final product are described in the thesis. The second part of the thesis is a practical part containing data from the research focused on top-fermenting yeast strains available on the Czech market. The selected top-fermenting yeast strains were used for the wort fermentation created by the unified production technology. Obtained beer samples were subsequently analysed by laboratory techniques as well as by sensory analysis. In conclusion, this thesis compares the amount of the alcohol, true extract and <b>original</b> <b>wort</b> in individual beer samples. Additionally, the amount of residual sugars, and glycerol and ethanol levels in these samples were compared by HPLC analysis...|$|E
40|$|The article {{deals with}} {{production}} of various malts intended for manufacture of special types of beer. The malts {{were used to}} brew samples of beer with alcoholic strength ranging between 8 - 12 % EPM. The above range of <b>original</b> <b>wort</b> content was chosen due to its suitability for sensory evaluation and properties; in stronger types of beer, (more than 12 % EPM), nature of the beverage can be drown by mashy flavour. In the experimental samples, the actual residual extract oscillated between 4. 0 - 6. 5 %. The content of ethanol corresponded {{to the degree of}} fermentation and thereby also to the residual actual extract in balance equilibrium specifying that higher residual extract corresponds to lower content of alcohol by volume. It ranged between 2. 5 - 5. 0 %. The sample 1 contained the highest amount of ethanol by mass (3. 9 %) and the sample 13 showed the lowest one (1. 9 %); alike trend of ethanol content by volume was revealed (5 and 2. 44 %, respectively). The highest content of actual and apparent extract was found in the sample 2 (6. 6 and 5. 2 %, respectively); the sample 13 showed the lowest levels (4. 0 and 3. 1 %, respectively). The <b>original</b> <b>wort</b> extract content averaged 9. 9 % in most of the samples; the sample 1 showed distinctly higher value (12. 6 %) and, on the contrary, the sample 13 demonstrated the lowest one (7. 4 %). The highest relative density was revealed in the sample 2 (1. 02 %) and the lowest one in the sample 13 (1. 01 %). Considering differences in osmotic pressure, the sample 1 exhibited the highest value (1045 mOs) and the sample 13 the lowest one (551 mOs). The highest level of fermentation was found in the sample 19 (61. 7 %), the lowest one was proved in the sample 19 (44. 0 %). Sensory analysis corresponded to originality and characteristics of each sample. The sample of beer made from spring barley was evaluated to be the best one. © 2017 Potravinarstvo Slovak Journal of Food Sciences...|$|E
40|$|Total, {{reducing}} end, {{and free}} neutral monosaccharide {{analyses were performed}} to estimate the arabinoxylan (AX) and arabinogalactan peptide (AGP) contents and AX average degree of polymerization (avDP) and arabinose substitution (avDS) {{of a series of}} commercial beers representing different beer styles. The analytical data were related to standard beer parameters. AX content was lowest in alcohol-free and light beers (0. 49 - 0. 69 g/L) and highest in strong ales (1. 19 - 1. 90 g/L) and German white beers (1. 64 - 1. 78 g/L). AX content generally correlated well with the <b>original</b> <b>wort</b> extract value of the beers. A similar trend was observed for AGP content, with overall values of 0. 07 - 0. 37 g/L. The AX avDS in the different beers was 0. 49 - 0. 66, while the AX avDP varied between 19 and 61, indicating the major fraction of these polysaccharides that ended up in the beers was extensively cleaved and present as arabinoxylo-oligosaccharides. Free xylose, arabinose, galactose, and glucose contents in the beers were 0. 02 - 0. 13, 0. 02 - 0. 11, 0. 01 - 0. 04, and 0. 06 - 15. 8 g/L, respectively.

40|$|The {{immobilization}} of Saccharomyces cerevisiae DSM 70424, Saccharomyces ludwigii DSM 3447 and Saccharomyces rouxii DSM 2531 on brewer’s {{spent grain}} and then ethanol production and sugar consumption of these immobilized yeasts were investigated. The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the abilities of these three immobilized yeasts for producing alcohol for brewing at two temperatures (7 and 12 °C) using two different sugar levels (one at original level supplied in the brewery and one with 2. 5 % (w/v), added glucose to the wort). Increasing both parameters resulted in higher alcohol production by all the yeasts studied. At 7 °C and with <b>original</b> <b>wort</b> density the ethanol content at the end of fermentation was 2. 7 % (v/v) for S. cerevisiae, 1. 7 % for S. ludwigii and 2. 0 % for S. rouxii. After the addition of 2. 5 % (w/v) glucose at the same temperature (7 °C), the alcohol production was increased to 4. 1, 2. 8 and 4. 1 %, respectively. Similar improvements were observed when the fermentation was carried out at 12 °C with/without the addition of glucose to the wort. However, temperature indicated greater influence on S. ludwigii than did on S. rouxii and S. cerevisiae. The immobilization as carried out in this study impacted both S. ludwigii and S. rouxii in a way that they could consume maltose under certain conditions...|$|E
