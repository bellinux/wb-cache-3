30|$|The {{software}} SmartGridFetch {{was implemented}} at a previous student work and continually developed and adjusted {{on the circumstances}} of the current work. It runs on the virtual machine of IM, collects data from energy analyzers over Modbus protocol, and saves them in the Apache Cassandra database. The software is written in Java and consists essentially of two main classes for requesting and receiving data over the Modbus TCP/IP protocol and for saving the values in a database. The software starts a thread pool with several threads for requesting data from energy analyzers. Each thread requests 18 measurements from one device every second. After receiving the response, each thread saves the measurements with a timestamp at database. The settings and device parameter like IP address, device description, measurements to be requested, and further settings can be set over an <b>option</b> <b>class.</b> The measurements were requested over the Modbus Read Holding Register function, so several continuous registers can be read out in one request. The initial SmartGridFetch application only provides requests of continuous register blocks over Modbus TCP/IP and only Siemens PAC 4200 devices. For the current work, we adjust the application, so {{that it is possible to}} request measurements saved at discontinuous register blocks and to support different device types, especially the Janitza devices we use. With these features, the software is more flexible.|$|E

40|$|An {{empirical}} {{examination of}} the pricing and hedging performance of a stochastic volatility (SV) model with closed form solution (Heston 1993) is provided for options on the S&P 500 index in which the unobservable time varying volatility is jointly estimated with the time invariant parameters of the model. Although, out-of-sample, the mean absolute pricing error in the SV model is always lower than in the Black-Scholes model, still substantial mispricings are observed for deep out-of-the-money options. The degree of mispricing in different <b>options</b> <b>classes</b> is related to bid-ask spreads on options and options trading volume after controlling for moneyness and maturity biases. Taking into account the transactions costs (bid-ask spreads) in the options market and using S&P 500 futures to hedge, {{it is found that}} the stochastic volatility model yields lower variance for a minimum variance hedge portfolio than the Black-Scholes model for most <b>classes</b> of <b>options</b> and the differences in variances are statistically significant.
