He had turned into a stranger." [...] Lewis recounted a prison official in Tallahassee describing a similar transformation: [...] "He said, 'He became weird on me.'

500|$|The term [...] "Munchausen by Internet" [...] {{was first}} used in an article {{published}} in the Southern Medical Journal written by Marc Feldman in 2000.

Factitious disorders are described in the [...] (DSM) as psychological disorders involving the production of non-existent physical or psychological ailments to earn sympathy. These illnesses are feigned not for monetary gain or to avoid inconvenient situations, but to attract compassion or to control others. Chronic manifestation of factitious disorder is often called Munchausen syndrome, after a book about the exaggerated accounts of the adventures of Baron Munchausen, a German cavalry officer in the Russian Army, that was written by Rudolf Erich Raspe. When the symptoms of another person, such as a child or an elderly parent, are purposely induced by the caregiver, it is called factitious disorder by proxy, or Munchausen syndrome by proxy.|$|E

2500|$|Joseph Westermeyer, Head <b>of</b> <b>Psychiatry</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Oklahoma, {{states that}} a {{culturally}} bound syndrome {{is defined as}} [...] "certain trance-like disturbances [...] occur with unusual frequencies in certain societies". These syndromes, he says, actually occur {{in a wide variety}} of cultures separated by great distance that have similar symptoms [...] including [...] "fear, anxiety, amnesia, aimless escape, psychophysiological symptoms, social withdrawal, behavioral deviance and nondirected violence". [...] However, these symptoms are not confined to culturally bound syndromes, as others, such as [...] "personality disorder, neurasthenia, crisis/judgment disorders, organic brain syndromes, drug-induced delirium, major depression, mania, schizophreniform and schizophrenia" [...] might constitute the true psychiatric diagnosis." [...] Because of these cross-cultural symptoms, it is argued that these syndromes are not necessarily unique [...] ". and that applying the term ‘culturally bound’ to them hampers science’s ability to explore them on the same level as other psychological problems. Outbreaks of these symptoms are sporadic and epidemic." [...] Some culturally bound syndromes, in addition to grisi siknis, include: ...|$|E
2500|$|Acquired {{situational}} narcissism (ASN) {{is a form}} of narcissism {{that develops}} in late adolescence or adulthood, brought on by wealth, fame and the other trappings of celebrity. It was coined by Robert B. Millman, professor <b>of</b> <b>psychiatry</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Weill Cornell Medical College of Cornell University. ASN differs from conventional narcissism in that it develops after childhood and is triggered and supported by the celebrity-obsessed society. [...] Fans, assistants and tabloid media all play into the idea that the person really is vastly more important than other people, triggering a narcissistic problem that might have been only a tendency, or latent, and helping it to become a full-blown personality disorder. [...] "Millman says that what happens to celebrities is that they get so used to people looking at them that they stop looking back at other people." [...] In its presentation and symptoms, it is indistinguishable from narcissistic personality disorder, differing only in its late onset and its support by large numbers of others. [...] "The lack of social norms, controls, and of people telling them how life really is, also makes these people believe they're invulnerable," [...] so that the person with ASN may suffer from unstable relationships, substance abuse and erratic behaviour. A famous fictional character with ASN is Norma Desmond, the main character of Sunset Boulevard.|$|E
