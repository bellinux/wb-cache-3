The off nominal conditions included aerodynamic uncertainties in extrapolating from wind tunnel derived characteristics to full scale flight characteristics, uncertainties in the estimates of the reaction control system interaction with the orbiter aerodynamics, an error in deriving the angle of attack from onboard instrumentation, the failure {{of two of the}} four reaction control system thrusters on each side, and a lateral center of gravity <b>offset</b> <b>coupled</b> with vehicle and flow asymmetries. With combinations of these off nominal conditions, the flight control system performed satisfactorily. At low hypersonic speeds, a few cases exhibited unacceptable performances when errors in deriving the angle of attack from the onboard instrumentation were modeled.

Results show 36. 8 % of acres are estimated to be below-baseline, suggesting the Maryland performance-based baseline may be ???looser??? than many might think. Regression models isolate the marginal impact on average of seven BMPs, individually adopted, using a sample of 77 below-baseline fields.

40|$|Multi-scale {{modeling}} of {{chemical vapor deposition}} (CVD) is a very broad topic because {{a large number of}} physical processes affect the quality and speed of film deposition. These processes have different length scales associated with them creating the need for a multi-scale model. The three main scales of importance to the {{modeling of}} CVD are the reactor scale, the feature scale, and the atomic scale. The reactor scale ranges from meters to millimeters and is called the reactor scale because it corresponds with the scale of the reactor geometry. The micrometer scale is labeled as the feature scale in this study because this is the scale related to the feature geometries. However, this is also the scale at which grain boundaries and surface quality can be discussed. The final scale of importance to the CVD process is the atomic scale. The focus of this study is on the reactor and feature scales with special focus on the coupling between these two scales. Currently there are two main methods of coupling between the reactor and feature scales. The first method is mainly applied when a modified line of sight feature scale model is used, with coupling occurring through a mass balance performed at the wafer surface. The second method is only applicable to Monte Carlo based feature scale models. Coupling in this second method is accomplished through a mass balance performed at a plane offset from the surface. During this study a means of using an offset plane to couple a continuum based reactor/meso scale model to a modified line of sight feature scale model was developed. This new model is then applied to several test cases and compared with the surface coupling method. In order to facilitate coupling at an offset plane a new feature scale model called the Ballistic Transport with Local Sticking Factors (BTLSF) was developed. The BTLSF model uses a source plane instead of a hemispherical source to calculate the initial deposition flux arriving from the source volume. The advantage of using a source plane is that it can be made to be the same plane as the coupling plane. The presence of only one interface between the feature and reactor/meso scales simplifies coupling. Modifications were also made to the surface coupling method to allow it to model non-uniform patterned features. Comparison of the two coupling methods showed that they produced similar results with a maximum of 4. 6 % percent difference in their effective growth rate maps. However, the shapes of individual effective reactivity functions produced by the <b>offset</b> <b>coupling</b> method are more realistic, without the step functions present in the effective reactivity functions of the surface coupling method. Also the cell size of the continuum based component of the multi-scale model was shown to be limited when the surface coupling method was used. Thanks to the work done in this study researchers using a modified line of sight feature scale model now have a choice of using either a surface or an <b>offset</b> <b>coupling</b> method to link their reactor/meso and feature scales. Furthermore, the comparative study of these two methods in this thesis highlights {{the differences between the two}} methods allowing their selection to be an informed decision...|$|E

40|$|International audience; Trains of spin echoes are {{normally}} modulated by homonuclear scalar couplings. It {{has long been}} known that echo modulations are quenched when the pulse-repetition rates are much larger than the <b>offsets</b> of the <b>coupling</b> partners, because the spin systems behave as if they consisted of magnetically equivalent spins when the offsets are suppressed. This type of quenching of the echo modulations can occur when the radio-frequency (RF) pulses are ideal, that is, when they are perfectly homogeneous, properly calibrated to induce rotations through an angle, pi, and have an RF amplitude, omega(1) =-gammaB(1), that is strong compared to the largest offset, Omega(S) =omega(0 S) -omega(RF), with respect to the carrier frequency. Recently, it was discovered that echo modulations can also be quenched when the RF pulses are nonideal, that is, when they are too weak to bring about an ideal rotation of the magnetization of the coupling partners, so that the effective fields associated with the RF pulses are tilted in the rotating frame. This phenomenon typically occurs when the pulse-repetition rates are much slower than the <b>offset</b> of the <b>coupling</b> partner. Under such conditions, it turns out, however, that for certain offsets, when the phase, Phi(S) (which arises from a free precession of the magnetization of the coupling partner, S, in the pulse interval, 2 tau, and the pulse length, tau(pi)), approaches a multiple of 2 pi, the echo modulations are restored. However, the frequencies of these echo modulations are not simply determined by the homonuclear scalar coupling, J(IS). The Fourier transforms of the echo trains (the so-called "J spectra") reveal surprising multiplet patterns, and the amplitudes of the echo modulations depend on the <b>offsets</b> of the <b>coupling</b> partners. Herein, we present a unified theory, based on an average-Hamiltonian approach, to describe these effects for two-spin systems. Experimental evidence of echo modulations in a system of two spins is presented.

David Curry died in 1917 and left the management of Camp Curry to his widow Jennie, now known as [...] "Mother Curry". She received help from her children, particularly Mary and Mary's husband Donald Tresidder.|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{this study}} are to {{optimize}} the coupling of a low-cost offset paraboloidal dish, which concentrates direct solar irradiance with dual axes tracking component, and the fibre optic bundle (FOB), which transmits concentrated solar energy; to review previous studies on the transmission of concentrated solar energy via optical fibres (TCSEvOF) by classifying according to their purposes; to present a mathematical model for coupling symmetrical paraboloidal dish and FOB, and a modified model for optimum <b>coupling</b> of <b>offset</b> paraboloidal dish proposed in our study, taking into account the parameters of the dish and dispersion effect; to apply the models to symmetrical and offset paraboloidal dish under the same conditions; and to compare the annual output power obtained. Optical efficiency of the whole system was calculated as 68 % in optimum condition, but it was found to be 63 % for the system proposed. Overall system efficiency was found to be 59 %. It was found that offset paraboloidal dish produced much more energy than the symmetrical one does when comparing under the same conditions. The difference of monthly average annual obtainable power was calculated as 0. 82 %. The monthly average annual power gained from the offset paraboloidal dish proposed was computed as 1041. 6 Â kW to per square metre.

5000|$|David and Jennie Curry, {{owners and}} {{operators}} of Curry Village, were schoolteachers {{who arrived in}} Yosemite Valley in 1899. The <b>couple</b> <b>offset</b> some of their vacation costs by giving camping tours, having experimented early on in Yellowstone National Park. For three summers in a row, the Currys led teachers on camping outings to Yellowstone with horse and wagon; arriving in Yosemite with a cook and seven tents. Despite the two-week, round trip travel period from Merced, California, the camp registered 292 guests its first year. The couple brought their three children with them. Foster, Mary and Marjorie (ages four through eleven) all helped out where they were able. The Curry Company came to dominate {{the politics of the}} park for decades. David wrote the Secretary of the Interior, Franklin Lane, in an effort extend the park's tourist season, hoping to expand his business.

40|$|This work {{describes}} {{the development of}} a large Ka Band Slot Array for the Glacier and Land Ice Surface Topography Interferometer (GLISTIN), a proposed spaceborne interferometric synthetic aperture radar for topographic mapping of ice sheets and glaciers. GLISTIN will collect ice topography measurement data over a wide swath with sub-seasonal repeat intervals using a Ka-band digitally beamformed antenna. For technology demonstration purpose a receive array of size 1 x 1 m, consisting of 160 x 160 radiating elements, was developed. The array is divided into 16 sticks, each stick consisting of 160 x 10 radiating elements, whose outputs are combined to produce 16 digital beams. A transmit array stick was also developed. The antenna arrays were designed using Elliott's design equations with the use of an infinite-array mutual-coupling model. A Floquet wave model was used to account for external coupling between radiating slots. Because of the use of uniform amplitude and phase distribution, the infinite array model yielded identical values for all radiating elements but for alternating <b>offsets,</b> and identical <b>coupling</b> elements but for alternating positive and negative tilts. Waveguide-fed slot arrays are finding many applications in radar, remote sensing, and communications applications because of their desirable properties such as low mass, low volume, and ease of design, manufacture, and deployability. Although waveguide-fed slot arrays have been designed, built, and tested in the past, this work represents several advances to the state of the art. The use of the infinite array model for the radiating slots yielded a simple design process for radiating and coupling slots. Method of moments solution to the integral equations for alternating offset radiating slots in an infinite array environment was developed and validated using the commercial finite element code HFSS. For the analysis purpose, a method of moments code was developed for an infinite array of subarrays. Overall the 1 x 1 m array was found to be successful in meeting the objectives of the GLISTIN demonstration antenna, especially with respect to the 0. 042 deg, 1 / 10 th of the beamwidth of each stick, relative beam alignment between sticks...|$|R
