Historically 20–40 percent of the bank's revenue has been from private banking services, one of its higher profit-margin divisions.|$|E

The monastery of Saint Bertin became an important center under its abbot Odbert (986–1007), who created a new style based on Anglo-Saxon and Carolingian forms. The nearby abbey of St. Vaast (Pas-de-Calais) also created a number of important works. In southwestern France a number of manuscripts were produced c. 1000, at the monastery of Saint Martial in Limoges, as well as at Albi, Figeac, and Saint-Sever-de-Rustan in Gascony. In Paris a unique style developed at the abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés. In Normandy a new style arose in 975.

Lille's goalless draw with visiting Paris {{was a case of}} two points dropped against an uninspired opposition and did little to help either side's fortunes, with both clubs leapfrogged by Toulouse, winners over Nantes. Paris Saint-German moved into fourth place as the club from the capital eased past bottom side Le Havre.

Paris Saint-Germain missed out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> to go above Lyon into third as they were narrowly beaten by Rennes. Mateja Kezman's second league goal of the season gave Paris Saint-Germain a narrow win at Le Mans to keep them in contention for a top-three finish.

PSG's ambitions of European football were in the balance after they saw a stubborn Valenciennes side come from behind at the Stade Nungesser. Paris needed to win at home to Monaco to clinch fourth or fifth and a place in Europe next season, but a tepid display from Paul Le Guen's men in a goalless draw left them empty-handed after being tipped as potential title contenders throughout the season.|$|E
