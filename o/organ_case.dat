5|$|Many organs, {{particularly}} those {{built in the}} early 20th century, are contained {{in one or more}} rooms called organ chambers. Because sound does not project from a chamber into the room as clearly as from a freestanding <b>organ</b> <b>case,</b> enchambered organs may sound muffled and distant. For this reason, some modern builders, {{particularly those}} building instruments specializing in polyphony rather than Romantic compositions, avoid this unless the architecture of the room makes it necessary.|$|E
5|$|The bronze lectern {{was given}} to the College in 1654. The black and white marble paving dates from 1677–78. Except for the pews on the west, dating from 1884, the panelling, stalls and screens are all 17th-century, as are the altar and carved communion rails. Behind the altar is Bernard van Orley's The Carrying of the Cross — a companion-piece to this {{painting}} is in the National Gallery of Scotland. The <b>organ</b> <b>case</b> dates from 1716; originally designed by Christopher Schreider for St Mary Abbots Church, Kensington, it was acquired by Oriel in 1884.|$|E

25|$|The Gallery Organ {{is easily}} {{recognised}} from its unusual asymmetric façade – only the central <b>organ</b> <b>case</b> is original, {{the left and}} right wings added by Navaratnam. The action, once electropneumatic, was converted to direct-electric. This caused occasional problems with non-sounding notes and ciphers, resulting from the ingress of dirt into an open building and the general humidity. In the latest rebuilding of the organ, a new tracker action was built to replace the electric action. It is to date, the oldest playable organ in Singapore and is still regularly used for Masses.|$|E

25|$|During the 2013-16 {{restoration}} and {{renovation of the}} Cathedral, the gallery organ was completely dismantled and rebuilt by the organ builders Diego Cera of the Philippines. The organ was dismantled and shipped to the Philippines and revoiced and repaired while the cathedral was closed. The organ was provided with a new console and a new tracker action, while the original <b>organ</b> <b>case</b> was restored and extended. One no longer sees the asymmetrical facade, as all the pipe work was re-organized into the new case. The organ is also playable from a remote console located in the south transept, where the choir is now located. The cherubs and Saint Caecilia statue were not reinstalled after the restoration.|$|E
25|$|The small Church of England parish church, {{adjacent}} to the manor house, is dedicated to All Saints and has a chancel, a nave, a vestry, a south chapel, a bell-cote crowned by a short octagonal spire, and a porch on its west side. Of the original 14th-century church only part of its nave survives, a new chancel having been built about 1480, when the porch and south chapel were added. The present vestry {{was added to the}} east of the chapel in 1775. There are traces of wall paintings and of panels depicting the life of St Katherine, which were described in 1760 before being whitewashed over. The vestry screen may date from the late 15th century, and an oak pulpit is late 17th century. The <b>organ</b> <b>case</b> is richly decorated and looks medieval but is modern. The church was designated as Grade I listed in 1962.|$|E
50|$|Otto Rieger (21 May 1880 - 28 March 1920) {{was the son}} of Otto Rieger (and {{grandson}} of Franz Rieger), and took over the firm after his father's death. Under his superintendence, over 1000 more organs were built. He introduced an art nouveau style for the <b>organ</b> <b>cases,</b> and adopted the ideals of organ design promulgated by Albert Schweitzer.|$|R
50|$|Both <b>organ</b> <b>cases</b> were {{retained}} without alteration. The chancel case - designed by Hippolyte Blanc, {{the architect of}} the church - only needed cleaning, while the north gallery case was restored and repolished. Between them they contain 114 display (visible) pipes. The reconstructed organ has 67 speaking stops, 3 tremulants, 20 couplers and 3 piston couplers, making a total of 93 registers.|$|R

25|$|Gambier-Parry {{designed}} the coped tomb of his father, which is positioned in the churchyard {{east of the}} chancel of the Church of the Holy Innocents. The monument to Thomas Gambier-Parry is Grade II listed. The architect also worked on the sanctuary and chancel arch of All Saints' Church on Oakleigh Road North in Friern Barnet, London. In 1889 he restored the Church of St Margaret in Bagendon, Gloucestershire, now Grade 1 listed. Improvements made to the Grade II* listed Church of St Mary in Bayford, Hertfordshire in 1890 were to his design. Gambier-Parry made design changes to the Grade II* listed Church of St James in Quedgeley, Gloucestershire about 1890. The glass in the chancel east window of Elmore Church in Elmore, Gloucestershire, was dedicated to Sir William Vernon Guise and designed by Gambier-Parry in 1890. He also made improvements to Elmore Court in Elmore, Gloucestershire in the late 19th century. In 1894 to 1895, he restored and enlarged the Grade II* listed St James' Church in Cranham, Gloucestershire. In 1895 he made design changes to St Michael Church in Boulge, Suffolk, {{on behalf of the}} Holmes White family. Gambier-Parry was also responsible for the late 19th century alabaster-work in the sanctuary of the Lady Chapel of St Mary the Virgin, Bathwick. He was the architect of Whitemoor, opposite Amberley Church, {{in the western part of}} the parish of Minchinhampton, Gloucestershire. In 1908 Gambier-Parry {{designed the}} Grade II listed Iveson Manor in Ampney St Peter, Gloucestershire. About 1908, the first vicar of the Grade II* listed St Mary the Virgin, Bourne Street in London selected him to replace the reredos of the high altar. The architect installed an arch fabricated of dark wood and, above the arch, ornamentation in a sunburst design. He also built the <b>organ</b> <b>case</b> and loft for St Mary's Bourne Street, using an English baroque style, with pediments, scrollwork, and finials. The Grade II listed Pytte House of Clyst St George, Devon, was renovated and enlarged by Gambier-Parry in 1911. In the 1930s, he restored St Michael's Church (pictured) at Duntisbourne Rouse in Gloucestershire, at the same time living in the nearby old rectory. The church was Grade I listed in 1958.|$|E
25|$|Though the Early English {{style was}} Christian's {{favourite}} {{he was not}} restricted to it. Many of his original churches and church restorations display beautiful window tracery in other styles of Gothic architecture. An excellent example of his Decorated Gothic work {{can be seen at}} St John's Church, Kenilworth in Warwickshire built in 1851–52, using rough cut red sandstone for the body of the church with ashlar dressings and displaying a fine south-west steeple with a broach spire. Typically the interior is open and spacious with little division between nave and chancel. Other churches by Christian in the Decorated style include the prominently sited Christ Church, Forest Hill (1852–62) in the London Borough of Lewisham, built in Kentish Ragstone with an impressive tower and spire of 1885, and the charming St Paul's Church, Swanley in Kent completed in 1861 with a west tower added 1862–65 which is built of rubble stone with bands of red and yellow brick and topped by shingled pyramidal spire. Christian also worked in the Perpendicular Gothic style providing some very attractive Perpendicular traceried windows for the church of St James the Greater (1883), Oaks-in-Charnwood in Leicestershire, which was built in local granite and has a fine west tower, and also for the church of St Dionis, Parsons Green in the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham, built in red brick with stone dressings in 1884–85, its tower completed after Christian's death in 1896. For the restoration of the ancient Church of St Laurence (1860) in Warkworth, Northumberland, Christian provided a lovely group of chancel east windows in the round-arched Norman style and designed a Neo-Norman <b>organ</b> <b>case</b> for Romsey Abbey in Hampshire in 1858. In 1876–77 he added a Norman style family chapel and vestry to St Andrew's Church near Weston Park in Staffordshire to match the classical work of 1701 a little better than with Gothic. The composition of Minor Canonries (1878–80) that Christian designed as residences for canons of St Paul's Cathedral, London in nearby Amen Court is in the manner of Norman Shaw's Domestic Revival architecture, inspired by original Elizabethan and Jacobean buildings. Here Christian provided a careful design in red brick, beautifully set along the court, with large mullioned and transomed windows; patterned gables and tall chimneys; a tower topped by his usual pyramidal roof and elegant shell hoods over the doors. The court is entered through a pretty gateway, also in red brick, with a Tudor style arch which has an oriel window above on both sides. In a similar Elizabethan style is the bank (1884–86) that Christian designed for Messrs Cox & Co, bankers to the army, in Whitehall, Westminster, though here the building is faced in stone. The former bank is set at the north corner of Craig's Court and has three large gables decorated with a raised grid pattern similar to the work at Amen Court, perhaps alluding to the timber-framed gables of Elizabethan buildings. Below the gables there is an impressively wide expanse of mullioned and transomed windows for each of the upper floors. An extension was added to the corner under a smaller gable in 1900, designed by J. H. Christian. Also in an attractive Shaw style were two large convalescent homes which Christian designed, the first at Folkestone in Kent (1881, chapel added 1888) and the second, the Surrey Convalescent Home at Seaford, East Sussex (1888–91, demolished in the 1960s), both had the usual bold display of heavy mullioned and transomed stone windows, big gables, tall chimneystacks and dormers. Finally, Christian's National Portrait Gallery in London as noted above was designed in a striking Italian Renaissance style.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1840s Sharpe was invited by John Fletcher, his future brother-in-law, {{to build a}} church near Fletcher's home in Little Bolton. [...] Fletcher {{was the owner of}} a coal mine at Ladyshore, Little Lever, {{overlooking}} the River Irwell and the Manchester, Bolton & Bury Canal. [...] He had been using the clay which came up with the coal to make refractory bricks for furnaces, and suggested its use for building the church, as it was much cheaper than stone. Sharpe then designed the first church in England to be built, in whole or in part, from this material (terracotta), StStephen and All Martyrs, Lever Bridge (1842–44). [...] As terracotta is commonly used to make plant pots and the like, Sharpe himself called this church, and its two successors, [...] "the pot churches", a nickname that has stuck. [...] The advantages of terracotta were its cheapness, its sturdiness as a building material, {{and the fact that it}} could be moulded into almost any shape. [...] It could therefore be used for walls, towers, arches, and arcades in a church, for the detailed decoration of capitals and pinnacles, and also, as at StStephen's, for the furnishings, such as the altar, pulpit, font, <b>organ</b> <b>case,</b> and the pew ends. [...] Apart from the foundations and the rubble within the walls, StStephen and All Martyrs was constructed entirely from terracotta. [...] The following year, a second church was built using the same material, Trinity Church, Rusholme, south of Manchester (1845–46), built and paid for by Thomas Carill-Worsley, who lived at nearby Platt Hall. [...] In this case, although the exterior is in terracotta, the interior is of plastered brick. [...] The church was consecrated in June 1846, although at the time work on the spire had not yet started and several other features were incomplete, including the heating, seating, and floor tiling.|$|E
