5|$|On October 26, 2005, {{four months}} after his {{acquittal}} in Birmingham, Scrushy was indicted by {{a federal grand jury}} in Montgomery, Alabama. The indictment included 30 counts of money laundering, extortion, <b>obstruction</b> <b>of</b> <b>justice,</b> racketeering, and bribery of Alabama Governor Don Siegelman. Prosecutors claimed that Scrushy had agreed to pay over $500,000 of Siegelman's debt, which he accumulated during a failed attempt to bring a state lottery to Alabama, in exchange for a seat on the Certificates of Need Review Board. The board serves the state by reviewing hospitals and approving their construction. Although the new charges were filed a month before the previous trial ended, Scrushy's attorney's accused prosecutors of filing charges as retaliation for Scrushy's acquittal. Scrushy and Siegleman pleaded not guilty to all charges, but they were both convicted following a trial that lasted approximately six weeks. Scrushy was convicted of bribery, conspiracy, and mail fraud, while Siegelman was convicted of bribery, conspiracy, mail fraud, and <b>obstruction</b> <b>of</b> <b>justice.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 2007, then Florida lawyer Jack Thompson, who had {{previously}} campaigned against other games from Rockstar, stated {{that he would take}} measures to prevent the sale of Grand Theft Auto IV to minors. On 14 March 2007, Rockstar's parent company Take-Two Interactive filed a lawsuit against Thompson in an attempt to preemptively restrict him from his attempts to declare Rockstar's games as a nuisance. Games declared to be a nuisance are effectively banned for sale, which Take-Two believed would be a violation of First Amendment rights. Thompson responded by filing a countersuit, accusing Take-Two of violating federal RICO statues, committing perjury, <b>obstruction</b> <b>of</b> <b>justice,</b> and conspiring against him with third parties to deprive him of his civil rights.|$|E
5|$|Oliver North and John Poindexter {{were indicted}} on {{multiple}} charges on March 16, 1988. North, indicted on 16 counts, {{was found guilty}} by a jury of three felony counts. The convictions were vacated on appeal {{on the grounds that}} North's Fifth Amendment rights may have been violated by the indirect use of his testimony to Congress, which had been given under a grant of immunity. In 1990, Poindexter was convicted on several felony counts of conspiracy, lying to Congress, <b>obstruction</b> <b>of</b> <b>justice,</b> and altering and destroying documents pertinent to the investigation. His convictions were also overturned on appeal on similar grounds. Arthur L. Liman served as chief counsel for the Senate during the Iran–Contra Scandal.|$|E

5|$|The Senate later acquitted Clinton on both charges. The Senate {{refused to}} meet to hold an {{impeachment}} trial {{before the end of}} the old term, so the trial was held over until the next Congress. Clinton was represented by Washington law firm Williams & Connolly. The Senate finished a twenty-one-day trial on February 12, 1999, with the vote of 55 Not Guilty/45 Guilty on the perjury charge and 50 Not Guilty/50 Guilty on the <b>obstruction</b> <b>of</b> <b>justice</b> charge. Both votes fell short of the Constitutional two-thirds majority requirement to convict and remove an officeholder. The final vote was generally along party lines, with no Democrats voting guilty, and only a handful of Republicans voting not guilty.|$|E
5|$|While the House Judiciary Committee {{hearings}} {{ended in}} a straight party-line vote, there was lively debate on the House floor. The two charges passed in the House (largely with Republican support, but {{with a handful of}} Democratic votes as well) were for perjury and <b>obstruction</b> <b>of</b> <b>justice.</b> The perjury charge arose from Clinton's testimony before a grand jury that had been convened to investigate perjury he may have committed in his sworn deposition during Jones v. Clinton, Paula Jones's sexual harassment lawsuit. The obstruction charge was based on his actions to conceal his relationship with Lewinsky before and after that deposition.|$|E

40|$|The {{proof of}} Wagner's Conjecture by Robertson and Seymour gives a finite {{description}} of any family of graphs which is closed under the minor ordering. This description is a finite set of graphs called the <b>obstructions</b> <b>of</b> the family.

40|$|The rule of Law is the {{cornerstone}} of civilized life and free and fearless justice demands an independent court. The quintessence of contempt jurisprudence is <b>obstruction</b> <b>of</b> or interference with the administration <b>of</b> <b>justice.</b> The key to court's authority is people's confidence in that great institution and what shakes this faith is a blow to democracy. So, independent of royal beginnings, no democracy can be functional if justice is jejune and lacks the power to punish whoever challenges or chokes its authority. On fundamentals, contempt jurisdiction is basic to the rule of law. And be you ever so high the law is above you. The court being the principal instrumentality <b>of</b> law and <b>justice,</b> contempt power wisely understood and rightly used has a democratic basis. This hermeneutic perspective makes contempt power a people's tower all enough to command obedience when justice is at stake and authoritarian contumacy attacks judicial supremacy. In the general interest of the community it is imperative that the authority of the courts should not be imperiled and there should be no unjustifiable entrepreneur in the administration <b>of</b> <b>justice...</b>|$|R
5|$|Arthur Andersen {{was charged}} with and found guilty of <b>obstruction</b> <b>of</b> <b>justice</b> for {{shredding}} the thousands of documents and deleting e-mails and company files that tied the firm to its audit of Enron. Although {{only a small number}} of Arthur Andersen's employees were involved with the scandal, the firm was effectively put out of business; the SEC is not allowed to accept audits from convicted felons. The company surrendered its CPA license on August 31, 2002, and 85,000 employees lost their jobs. The conviction was later overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court due to the jury not being properly instructed on the charge against Andersen. The Supreme Court ruling theoretically left Andersen free to resume operations. However, the damage to the Andersen name has been so great that it has not returned as a viable business even on a limited scale.|$|E
5|$|In November 1998, McCain won {{re-election}} {{to a third}} Senate term; he {{prevailed in}} a landslide over his Democratic opponent, environmental lawyer Ed Ranger. In the February 1999 Senate trial following the impeachment of Bill Clinton, McCain voted to convict the president on both the perjury and <b>obstruction</b> <b>of</b> <b>justice</b> counts, saying Clinton had violated his sworn oath of office. In March 1999, McCain voted to approve the NATO bombing campaign against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, saying that the ongoing genocide of the Kosovo War must be stopped and criticizing past Clinton administration inaction.
