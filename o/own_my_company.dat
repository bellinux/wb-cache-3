60|$|I {{remembered him}} {{perfectly}} now. I remembered, even, {{the occasion of}} my last visit to the cafe. Louis, with upraised hat, seemed as though he would have passed on, but, curiously enough, I felt a desire to continue the conversation. I had not as yet admitted the fact even to myself; but I was bored, weary of my search, weary to death of <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>company</b> and the <b>company</b> of <b>my</b> <b>own</b> acquaintances.

60|$|On {{board the}} English ship they thought me a Spanish adventurer {{who had made}} moneys in the Indies, and I did not undeceive them, since I would be left to <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>company</b> for a while that I might prepare my mind to return to ways of thought and life that it had long forgotten.

5000|$|Each of the Rat Pack's films {{contained}} a numeral in its title. The others were: Ocean's 11 (1960), Robin and the 7 Hoods (1964, with Joey Bishop absent and Bing Crosby replacing Peter Lawford), and 4 for Texas with Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Anita Ekberg and Ursula Andress as the {{four in the}} title, Charles Bronson as a villain, and the Three Stooges as additional comedy relief.

Unfortunately, I 've got no errand, and nobody will trust me with one. I want to care for something, or for some one. And I want to care with a certain ardor; even, if you can believe it, with a certain passion. I can't just now feel ardent and passionate about a hospital or a dormitory.

According to People, Hewitt learned of an {{industry}} ad asking if anyone knew where he was. Some filmmakers, it turned out, thought he would be perfect for a lead role in a movie about drugged-out gay prostitutes in West Hollywood. [...] "It wasn't for me", he says with a laugh.

40|$|Within {{the last}} decade, {{a large number}} of American firms have formalized their objectives, and have begun to plan the {{long-range}} programs necessary to meet corporate goals. As international operations have assumed more importance within the overall scope of these firms' activities, many companies have begun to apply their experience in domestic planning to operations outside the United States. However, just as pediatricians have convinced us that there is more to healing children than treating them as little adults, the blanket application of domestic planning approaches and techniques is not only inadvisable, but unfeasible. I would like to spend my time with you this afternoon considering how international long-range planning is different, and attempt to determine within the context of <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>company's</b> experience, how domestic planning concepts must be modified in an international environment.

40|$|The {{estimated}} $ 65 {{billion a}} year {{that the federal government}} now spends on corporate welfare programs harms U. S. industry in general and Silicon Valley companies in particular. The competitiveness of America's semiconductor firms and other high-technology industries would benefit if corporate subsidies were eliminated altogether and the savings were devoted to reducing corporate income taxes, the capital gains tax, or the personal income tax. Given Congress's reluctance to vote down corporate pork, one strategy for eliminating corporate welfare would be to form an independent commission to identify unnecessary subsidies. That would force Congress to vote yes or no on a package of corporate spending subsidies. More than 50 Silicon Valley CEOs agree with this critical assessment of federal subsidies to industry and have signed a "Declaration of Independence" from corporate welfare. In the statement, which appears in the Appendix of this study, the CEOs urge Congress to end corporate welfare "even if it means funding cuts to <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>company.</b> ...|$|R

In numbers it had increased to nigh eight thousand, and the men were well fed and light of heart. With sturdy close-locked ranks they splashed their way through mud and puddle, with many a rough country joke and many a lusty stave from song or hymn. Sir Gervas rode {{at the head of}} his musqueteers, whose befloured tails hung limp and lank with the water dripping from them. Lockarby's pikemen and <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>company</b> of scythesmen were mostly labourers from the country, who were hardened against all weathers, and plodded patiently along with the rain-drops glistening upon their ruddy faces.

Having previously discovered artists such as Glenn Miller, Artie Shaw, and Woody Herman, Nidorf was impressed by Stafford's voice, and contacted her when he was demobilized in 1944. After she agreed to let him represent her, he encouraged her to reduce her weight and arranged a string of engagements that raised her profile, and confidence.|$|R
