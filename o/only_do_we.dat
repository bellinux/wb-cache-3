500|$|He also denounced Bihari MPs, {{saying they}} were [...] "spitting in the same plate from which they ate" [...] by criticising Mumbaikars and Maharashtrians. He also wrote, [...] "They are trying to add fuel to the fire that has been extinguished, by saying that Mumbaikars have rotten brains". The {{outburst}} was apparently in response to MPs from Bihar who had disrupted {{the proceedings of the}} Lok Sabha in protest against the attacks on North Indians. Bihar chief minister, Nitish Kumar, upset with the remarks, demanded that the Prime Minister and the Centre intervene in the matter immediately. The Saamna editorial prompted at least 16Lok Sabha MPs from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, belonging to the RJD, JD (U), SP and the Congress, to give notice for breach of privilege proceedings against Bal Thackeray. After the matter was raised in the Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee said: [...] "If anybody has made any comment on our members' functioning in the conduct of business in the House, not <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> treat that with the contempt that it deserves, but also any action that may be necessary will be taken according to procedure and well established norms.

[...] When Sonya and Toadie found {{out that they were}} expecting a baby, Claire Crick from All About Soap commented [...] "At last – Sonya and Toadie are having a baby… and we can't think of a soapy couple who deserve such happy news! Not <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> totally love Toadie and Sonya (it's so refreshing seeing a couple who are happy together!), but they're also so clearly desperate to be parents." [...] Crick later praised Sonya for helping Lucas and Vanessa realise their feelings for each other, saying [...] "thank goodness for her meddling ways!" [...] A Newcastle Herald reporter noted that Sonya [...] "has seen more drama than most".|$|E

Reacting to her victory, Love took a shot at the media's perceived obsession with identity politics, joking to her supporters: [...] "Many of the naysayers out there said that Utah would never elect a black, Republican, LDS woman to Congress.

2500|$|In 2009, four {{sales representatives}} for Eli Lilly filed {{separate}} qui tam lawsuits {{against the company}} for illegally marketing the drug Zyprexa for uses not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Eli Lilly pleaded guilty to actively promoting Zyprexa for off-label uses, particularly {{for the treatment of}} dementia in the elderly. The $1.415 billion penalty included an $800 million civil settlement and a $515 million criminal fine. The U.S. Justice Department said the criminal fine of $515 million was the largest ever in a health care case, and the largest criminal fine for an individual corporation ever imposed in a U.S. criminal prosecution of any kind. [...] "That was a blemish for us," [...] John C. Lechleiter, CEO of Lilly, told The New York Times. [...] "We don’t ever want that to happen again. We put measures in place to assure that not <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> have the right intentions in integrity and compliance, but we have systems in place to support that."

2500|$|In August 2011 Ash {{collaborated with}} We Are Scientists {{to release a}} cover of the song [...] "Washington Parks" [...] by British {{songwriter}} Robert Manning, raising money and awareness for Multiple Sclerosis and The MS Society. The song was recorded between London and New York by the two bands and join a project already boasting releases from Ed Hardcourt and Emmy the Great. Chris Cain from We Are Scientists {{said in an interview}} [...] "We actually recorded a single [...] which {{is going to come out}} soon. It won't be too long until it's out and it's for a charity in England called the Multiple Sclerosis Society. It's a cover of a song called [...] "Washington Parks" [...] by I think Happy Monster but it's pretty sweet. The concept of the song is that if you listen to it on headphones or stereo the musicians of Ash are on the left channel and all the We Are Scientists guys are playing it in the right channel. We're playing the same song essentially but in different ways. I'm not playing the same bass line as Mark and Rick isn't playing the same drum pattern as Andy. I think Keith and Tim sing the same thing but in a different sort of harmony. What's interesting especially is that not <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> have a unison feel going on but you can also take off one headphone and hear one band and vice versa." ...|$|E

50|$|One of {{the things}} that made The Spice Trail so watchable was the enthusiasm - the effusiveness - of all involved. No one looked like they'd been kowtowed into it by some executive.

60|$|From {{the time}} when Cuvier's {{wonderful}} researches upon the extinct Mammals of the Paris gypsum first made intercalary types known, and caused them to be recognised as such, {{the number of such}} forms has steadily increased among the higher Mammalia. Not <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> now know numerous intercalary forins of Ungulata, but M. Gaudry's great monograph upon the fossils of Pikermi (which strikes me {{as one of the most}} perfect pieces of palaeontological work I have seen for a long time) shows us, among the Primates, Mesopithecus as an intercalary form between the Semnopitheci and the Macaci; and among the Carnivora, Hyoenictis and Ictitherium as intercalary, or, perhaps, linear types between the Viverridoe and the Hyoenidoe.|$|E
60|$|If, once more, we {{say that}} science is exact prevision, we still fail to {{establish}} the supposed difference. Not <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> find {{that much of what}} we call science is not exact, and that some of it, as physiology, can never become exact; but we find further, that many of the previsions constituting the common stock alike of wise and ignorant, are exact. That an unsupported body will fall; that a lighted candle will go out when immersed in water; that ice will melt when thrown on the fire--these, and many like predictions relating to the familiar properties of things have as high a degree of accuracy as predictions are capable of. It is true that the results predicated are of a very general character; but it is none the less true that they are rigorously correct as far as they go: and this is all that is requisite to fulfil the definition. There is perfect accordance between the anticipated phenomena and the actual ones; and no more than this can be said of the highest achievements of the sciences specially characterised as exact.|$|E
60|$|No great {{movement}} {{of the human mind}} takes place without the concurrent beat of those two wings, the imagination and the understanding. It is by the understanding that we are enabled {{to make the most of}} this world, and to use the collected material of experience in its condensed form of practical wisdom; and it is the imagination which forever beckons toward that other world which is always future, and makes us discontented with this. The one rests upon experience; the other leans forward and listens after the inexperienced, and shapes the features of that future with which it is forever in travail. The imagination might be defined as the common sense of the invisible world, as the understanding is of the visible; and as those are the finest individual characters in which the two moderate and rectify each other, so those are the finest eras where the same may be said of society. In the voyage of life, not <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> depend on the needle, true to its earthly instincts, but upon observation of the fixed stars, those beacons lighted upon the eternal promontories of heaven above the stirs and shiftings of our lower system.|$|E

60|$|The idea of journeying in a canoe struck our fancy quite pleasantly; and we at once {{set about}} {{chartering}} one, if possible. But none could we obtain.

60|$|There is a freshness, a vivacity, a zeal, a sincerity, a {{brightness}} {{of interest in}} his subject, which are perhaps unique in {{the whole history of}} criticism. He flings himself into the task with the perfection of natural abandonment to a joyous and delightful subject. His whole personality is engaged in a work that has all the air of being overflowing pleasure, and his pleasure is contagious. His criticism awakens the imagination of the reader. Not <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> see the picture; we hear Diderot's own voice in ecstasies of praise and storms of boisterous wrath. There is such mass in his criticism; so little of the mincing and niggling of the small virtuoso. In facility of expression, in animation, in fecundity of mood, in fine improvisation, these pieces are truly incomparable. There is such an impetus animi et quædam artis libido. Some of the charm and freedom {{may be due to the}} important circumstance that he was not writing for the public. He was not exposed to the reaction of a large unknown audience upon style; hence the absence of all the stiffness of literary pose. But the positive conditions of such success lay in the resources of Diderot's own character.|$|E
60|$|In {{the matter}} of pictures, I notice, the {{correlation}} has even gone a step farther. Not <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> usually take in the episodes of a painting from left to right, but the painter definitely and deliberately intends us so to take them in. For wherever two or three distinct episodes in succession are represented on a single plane in the same picture--as happens often in early art--they are invariably represented in the precise order of the words on a written or printed page, beginning at the upper left-hand corner, and ending at the lower right-hand angle. I first noticed this curious extension of the common principle in the mediæval frescoes of the Campo Santo at Pisa; and I have since verified it by observations on many other pictures elsewhere, both ancient and modern. The Campo Santo, however, forms an exceptionally good museum of such story-telling frescoes by various painters, as almost every picture consists of several successive episodes. The famous Benozzo Gozzoli, for example, of Noah's Vineyard represents on a single plane all the stages in that earliest drama of intoxication, from the first act of gathering the grapes on the top left, to the scandalised lady, the vergognosa di Pisa, who covers {{her face with her}} hands in shocked horror at the patriarch's disgrace in the lower right-hand corner.|$|E

It is not the fact of knowing Latin, and Greek, and mathematics which benefits a man; but it is the learning of them. It is the discipline to the mind, which is of benefit. The mind is like the body. There is no use in cricket, or in boating, or in hunting, but these things strengthen the body and make it active and healthy, and able to do better everything which it undertakes, and it is exactly {{the same thing with the}} mind; besides, the days are coming when farmers must farm their land with science and intelligence, or they will be left behind in the race. We are being rivalled by the farmers of America. Not <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> have to pay rent, but by the tithes and rates and taxes they put upon us government makes the English farmer pay a heavy tax upon every bushel of corn he produces, while they allow the American corn to come into the market tax-free. This may be all right, but it does not appear fair to me. However, there it is, and we have got to meet it, and if we are to keep our heads above water, it can only be by farming up to the very best lights of the day." ...|$|E

6000|$|There {{is reason}} to think that these titles were {{originally}} proper names. Not <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> see among the Egyptians, where Pharaoh was synonymous with king, and among the Romans, where to be Cæsar meant to be Emperor, that the proper names of the greatest men were transferred to their successors, and so became class names; but in the Scandinavian mythology we may trace a human title of honour up to the proper name of a divine personage. In Anglo-Saxon bealdor, or baldor, means Lord; and Balder {{is the name of the}} favourite of Odin's sons--the gods who with him constitute the Teutonic Pantheon. How these names of honour became general is easily understood. The relatives of the primitive kings--the grandees described by Selden as having names formed on those of the gods, and shown by this to be members of the divine race--necessarily shared in the epithets, such as Lord, descriptive of superhuman relationships and nature. Their ever-multiplying offspring inheriting these, gradually rendered them comparatively common. And then they came to be applied to every man of power: partly from the fact that, in these early days when men conceived divinity simply as a stronger kind of humanity, great persons could be called by divine epithets with but little exaggeration; partly from the fact that the unusually potent were apt to be considered as unrecognised or illegitimate descendants of [...] "the strong, the destroyer, the powerful one;" [...] and partly, also, from compliment and the desire to propitiate.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] resumed I positively, [...] "a poet; for of all writers he has {{the best}} chance for immortality. Others may write from the head, but he writes from the heart, and the heart will always {{understand}} him. He is the faithful portrayer of Nature, whose features are always the same and always interesting. Prose writers are voluminous and unwieldy; their pages crowded with commonplaces, and their thoughts expanded into tediousness. But with the true poet every thing is terse, touching, or brilliant. He gives the choicest thoughts in the choicest language. He illustrates them by everything that he sees most striking in nature and art. He enriches them by pictures of human life, {{such as it is}} passing before him. His writings, therefore, contain the spirit, the aroma, if I may use the phrase, of the age in which he lives. They are caskets which inclose within a small compass the wealth of the language--its family jewels, which are thus transmitted in a portable form to posterity. The setting may occasionally be antiquated, and require now and then to be renewed, {{as in the case of}} Chaucer; but the brilliancy and intrinsic value of the gems continue unaltered. Cast a look back over the long reach of literary history. What vast valleys of dulness, filled with monkish legends and academical controversies! What bogs of theological speculations!

[...] True it is that thorns and thistles, ill-favoured and poisonous plants, well named by botanists [...] "rubbish-plants," [...] mark the track which man has proudly traversed through the earth. Before him lay original Nature in her wild but sublime beauty. Behind him he leaves the desert, a deformed and ruined land; for childish desire of destruction or thoughtless squandering of vegetable treasures has destroyed the character of Nature; and, terrified, man himself flies from the arena of his actions, leaving the impoverished earth to barbarous races or to animals, so long as yet another spot in virgin beauty smiles before him. Here, again, in selfish pursuit of profit, and, consciously or unconsciously, following the abominable principle of the great moral vileness which one man has expressed-- [...] "Apres nous le deluge"--he begins anew the work of destruction. [...] Thus did cultivation, driven out, leave the East, and perhaps the Deserts formerly robbed of their coverings: like the wild hordes of old over beautiful Greece, thus rolls the conquest with fearful rapidity {{from east to west}} through America; and the planter now often leaves the already exhausted land, the eastern climate becomes infertile through the demolition of the forests, to introduce a similar revolution into the far West.' ...|$|E
