5|$|Lexical {{differences}} between dialects are often considerable. This {{is due to}} the earlier cultural practice <b>of</b> <b>imposing</b> taboo on words which had served as names for a deceased person. Since people were often named after everyday objects, many of these have changed their name several times because of taboo rules, causing dialectal vocabulary to diverge further.|$|E
5|$|The {{court also}} ruled that {{evidence}} against Andrew Wilson, regarding other matters {{for which the}} police wanted him, was incorrectly admitted at his trial on murder charges. His case was remanded to the lower court for retrial. Andrew Wilson was convicted at his second trial in June 1988. But, after five days of deliberation, the jury was unable to agree on Wilson's eligibility for the death penalty; ten women were in favor <b>of</b> <b>imposing</b> this sentence and two men opposed it. The following month Andrew Wilson {{was sentenced to life}} imprisonment.|$|E

5|$|The {{revolution}} of May 1810 in Buenos Aires, intended {{to win the}} independence of Argentina from Spain, also had the consequence of emancipating the province of Buenos Aires from Argentina or, rather, <b>of</b> <b>imposing</b> the authority of this province upon the whole nation emancipated from Spain. That day, Spanish power over the Argentine provinces ended and that of Buenos Aires was established.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the commons}} and King Richard II were {{enthusiastic}} about the launch of a crusade to Flanders, {{for political and economic}} reasons: revenues from the English wool staple (that had ceased following the advance of the French) could be resumed; sending the bishop and not the king or his uncles to Flanders would enable John of Gaunt's unpopular plans for a royal crusade to Castille to be abandoned; French forces would be drawn away from the Iberian peninsula; and Anglo-Flemish relations would be strengthened. Another advantage in approving a crusade was that its cost would be borne by the Church and not by means of government levies: ever since the Peasants' Revolt, the government was fearful of the consequences <b>of</b> <b>imposing</b> a tax to pay for a new war against the French.|$|E
5|$|Censors like Martin Quigley and Joseph Breen {{understood}} that:a {{private industry}} code, strictly enforced, {{is more effective}} than government censorship as a means <b>of</b> <b>imposing</b> religious dogma. It is secret, for one thing, operating at the pre-production stage. The audience never knows what has been trimmed, cut, revised, or never written. For another, it is uniform—not subject to hundreds of different licensing standards. Finally and most important, private censorship can be more sweeping in its demands, because it is not bound by constitutional due process or free-expression rules—in general, these apply to only the government—or by the command of church-state separation … {{there is no question that}} American cinema today is far freer than in the heyday of the Code, when Joe Breen's blue pencil and the Legion of Decency's ever-present boycott threat combined to assure that films adhered to Catholic Church doctrine.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1720s, Zahir {{and his brother}} Yusuf, backed by the Bani Saqr, {{captured}} Tiberias and its multazim. Concurrently, Zahir issued a letter to Köprülü Abdullah Pasha, governor of Sidon Eyalet, accusing the multazim of oppression and <b>of</b> <b>imposing</b> illegal taxes on the population. Zahir insisted that if Abdullah Pasha appointed him multazim of Tiberias and Arraba, he would guarantee the timely payment of taxes and rule justly. Abdullah Pasha consented to Zahir's rule and sent him an honorary robe. This {{was the first time}} a Zaydani multazim was directly appointed by the governor of Sidon rather than the semi-autonomous rural chiefs of Mount Lebanon. Zahir made Tiberias his principal base and was joined by his Zaydani kinsmen. He appointed his cousin Muhammad ibn Ali, the multazim of al-Damun, as commander of the family militia.|$|E
5|$|When {{confronted with}} {{inaccuracies}} or inconsistencies, {{those who are}} suspected of perpetrating fabrications may compound the deceit by accusing forum members <b>of</b> <b>imposing</b> greater stresses upon them, exacerbating their conditions, or worsening their depression. Users may employ sockpuppets—separate online identities controlled by the same person—to accuse other forum members of disloyalty and persecution, or support the user who is under suspicion. Feldman's 1998 article in the Western Journal of Medicine notes {{a case in which}} a member of a support group for people with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome created a husband, sister-in-law, and family friend who simultaneously engaged in arguments with and about the original member; when the amount of attention directed toward the original member became inadequate, she claimed the sister-in-law committed suicide in response to the lack of support.|$|E
5|$|France officially annexed Madagascar on January 1, 1896. That August, the French officially {{declared}} Madagascar to {{be their}} colony and exiled Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony to Algiers (in French Algeria) where he died the following year. The queen and much of her administration remained but were afforded no real political power. Shortly after Rainilaiarivony's exile, Ranavalona was approached by a French official who informed her that a new prime minister {{would need to be}} selected. The queen hastily concluded that General Jacques Duchesne, the French general who had successfully led the military campaign against the Merina monarchy, would be a probable choice. Assuming that Malagasy political tradition would be preserved, Ranavalona believed she would be forced to marry whichever man was chosen for the job and worriedly asked if Duchesne was to be her next husband. Surprised, the French official reassured her that France had no intention <b>of</b> <b>imposing</b> a husband on the queen and would never again require her to marry a prime minister. The queen's minister of foreign affairs, Rainitsimbazafy, was nominated to the post of prime minister by mutual consent.|$|E

The short-wavelength approximation {{is used in}} the linear stability analysis, i. e. the length scale <b>of</b> the <b>imposed</b> field is much larger than the wavelength of perturbations. The dispersion relationship is derived and then simplified to give the criteria for the onset of the magnetic instability in three cases <b>of</b> <b>imposed</b> field, namely the axial dependence, the radial dependence and the mixed case. The orientation <b>of</b> rotation, <b>imposed</b> field and imposed current is important for this instability...|$|R

This approach considers nonlinear behaviour of structures and not only is capable of detecting damaged elements but also can address the severity <b>of</b> <b>imposed</b> damages. Proposed algorithm was applied on a 3 -story concrete building. The obtained results confirmed accuracy and robustness of this method...|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to the old town, the city's district of Kazimierz is particularly notable for its many renaissance buildings and picturesque streets, {{as well as the}} historic Jewish quarter located in the north-eastern part of Kazimierz. Kazimierz was founded in the 14th century to the south-east of the city centre and soon became a wealthy, well-populated area where construction <b>of</b> <b>imposing</b> properties became commonplace. Perhaps the most important feature of medieval Kazimierz was the only major, permanent bridge (Pons Regalis) across the northern arm of the Vistula. This natural barrier used to separate Kazimierz from the Old Town for several centuries, while the bridge connected Kraków to the Wieliczka Salt Mine and the lucrative Hungarian trade route. The last structure at this location (at the end of modern Stradom Street) was dismantled in 1880 when the northern arm of the river was filled in with earth and rock, and subsequently built over.|$|E
5|$|Khrushchev {{sought to}} {{reconstruct}} Ukraine, but also desired {{to complete the}} interrupted work <b>of</b> <b>imposing</b> the Soviet system on it, though he hoped that the purges of the 1930s would not recur. As Ukraine was recovered militarily, conscription was imposed, and 750,000men aged between nineteen and fifty were given minimal military training and sent to join the Red Army. Other Ukrainians joined partisan forces, seeking an independent Ukraine. Khrushchev rushed from district to district through Ukraine, urging the depleted labor force to greater efforts. He made a short visit to his birthplace of Kalinovka, finding a starving population, with {{only a third of}} the men who had joined the Red Army having returned. Khrushchev did what he could to assist his hometown. Despite Khrushchev's efforts, in 1945, Ukrainian industry was at only a quarter of pre-war levels, and the harvest actually dropped from that of 1944, when the entire territory of Ukraine had not yet been retaken.|$|E

40|$|Twelve {{severely}} and profoundly {{mentally retarded}} individuals with life-threatening self-injurious behaviors {{were exposed to}} electrical aversion treatment using a remotely controlled device. Long-term effectiveness was assessed for periods ranging from 2 to 47 months for the 12 individuals, respectively. The degree <b>of</b> <b>imposed</b> physical restraint {{was used as the}} major dependent variable. With two individuals, the treatment failed to suppress self-injurious behavior. With seven individuals, however, suppression was nearly complete in that physical restraints were no longer necessary. With three individuals moderate effects were obtained, in that, although a substantial decrease <b>of</b> <b>imposed</b> physical restraint had been achieved, they still needed daily administrations of electrical aversive stimuli. The results are discussed in terms of the practical application of this procedure...|$|R
