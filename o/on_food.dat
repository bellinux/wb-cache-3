5|$|Although the {{facility}} did attract visitors, local residents' support {{failed to reach}} the numbers expected by the founders. Original projections of 300,000 admissions per year were never met. In October 2006, the museum announced plans to turn galleries into conference rooms, remove most of the museum's focus on art, and lay off 28 of its 85 employees (most of whom were security guards for the art gallery). At the time, Copia had $68 million ($ today) in debt. That year the museum also lowered its original adult admission fee of $12.50 to $5. For three months in 2006, the museum admitted guests free of charge, and attendance and revenue increased. The museum also began hosting weddings and renting its space more frequently {{in order to raise}} revenue. In 2007, the museum altered its theme significantly by removing its focus <b>on</b> <b>food</b> and art, and instead focusing solely on wine. It replaced some of its gardens with vineyards, changed its displays to focus more on the history and aspects of wine and viticulture, and decreased the restaurant's and programs' focus <b>on</b> <b>food.</b>|$|E
5|$|As Bonnie {{moved through}} the Bahamas, {{residents}} stocked up <b>on</b> <b>food</b> and water as a precautionary measure; however, no major preparations took place.

Heavy rain fell across a few islands and copious lightning was reported. No known damage or loss of life took place.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{aim of the}} EC Concerted Action PASSCLAIM was {{to develop}} a set of methods and {{procedures}} for assessing the scientific support for function-enhancing and health-related claims for foods and food components. This paper presents a critical review of the existing methods to evaluate the different aspects of physical performance and fitness needed to support claims <b>on</b> <b>foods</b> and food ingredients intended to enhance specific physiological functions. DESIGN AND RESULTS: Based on an inventory of labelling claims on available sport nutrition products, seven physiological functions in the field of physical performance and fitness were identified: 1) strength and power, 2) endurance, energy supply and recovery, 3) hydration/re-hydration, 4) flexibility, 5) tissue growth, 6) free radical scavenger capacity and 7) immune function. For each function the existing methodology was reviewed critically and judged on suitability to generate scientific support for physiological function claims <b>on</b> <b>foods.</b> CONCLUSIONS: A database of methods including advantages and disadvantages of use has been generated for considering the scientific support of claims <b>on</b> <b>foods</b> and food ingredients relating to physical performance and fitness. It will contribute to the formulations of guidelines for assessing the scientific support of enhanced function or reduced disease risk claims <b>on</b> <b>foods.</b> status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|Before the war, the Belgian {{government}} had planned an emergency system of rationing, which was implemented {{on the day}} of the German invasion. The German occupying authority used Belgium's reliance <b>on</b> <b>food</b> imports as a bargaining tool. The amount of food permitted to Belgian citizens was roughly two-thirds of that allowed to comparable German citizens and was amongst the lowest in occupied Europe. On average, scarcity of food led to a loss of five to seven kilograms of weight per Belgian in 1940 alone.|$|E
5|$|Black currawongs {{are very}} common around picnic areas in Tasmania's {{two most popular}} National Parks, Freycinet and Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair, and are often fed by {{tourists}} there. The National Parks Authority tolerated this practice until 1995, when they found the birds were becoming a nuisance and began discouraging people from feeding wildlife. However, the agile currawongs are adept at snatching fragments of food left by picnickers so the birds may only ultimately be discouraged by an (impractical) ban <b>on</b> <b>food</b> in National Parks. Birds also take other items such as soap or cutlery from campsites to examine.|$|E

The cost of his long legal battle was more than $38,000. Sarria tried to enlist the owners of the city's other gay bars to help Stoumen pay his legal bills, but none offered any assistance. The ABC lifted the bar's liquor license in 1963, the night before its annual Halloween party.

5|$|Cicadas are not major {{agricultural}} pests {{but in some}} outbreak years, trees may be overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of females laying their eggs in the shoots. Small trees may wilt and larger trees may lose small branches. Although in general, the feeding activities of the nymphs do little damage, during the year before an outbreak of periodic cicadas, the large nymphs feed heavily and plant growth may suffer. Some species have turned from wild grasses to sugar cane, and this has affected the crop adversely, {{and in a few}} isolated cases, females have oviposited <b>on</b> <b>food</b> crops such as date palms, grape vines, citrus trees, asparagus and cotton.|$|E
