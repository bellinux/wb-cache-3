5|$|The Palais des Sports in the Mahamasina {{neighborhood}} is the country's only indoor performance space built to international standards. It {{was built in}} 1995 by the Government of China; it regularly hosts concerts, dance and <b>other</b> <b>arts</b> performances, expositions and novelty events like monster truck rallies. The city lacks a dedicated classical music performance space, and concerts by international artists are infrequent. Performances of classical, jazz and other foreign musical genres, modern and contemporary dance, theater and <b>other</b> <b>arts</b> occur at cultural arts centers funded by foreign governments or private entities. Among the best-known of these are the Centre Culturel Albert Camus and Alliance française d'Antananarivo, both funded by the French government. the Cercle Germano-Malgache, {{a branch of the}} Goethe-Institut funded by the German government; The American Center is funded by the United States government. Antananarivo has two dedicated cinemas, the Rex and the Ritz, both of which were built in the colonial era. These venues do not show international releases but occasionally screen Malagasy films or are used for private events and religious services.|$|E
