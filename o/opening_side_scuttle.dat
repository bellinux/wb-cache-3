5000|$|A {{porthole}} {{on a ship}} {{may also}} be called a sidescuttle or <b>side</b> <b>scuttle</b> (<b>side</b> hole), as officially termed in the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea. This term {{is used in the}} U.S. Code of Federal Regulations. [...] It is also used in related rules and regulations for the construction of ships. The use of the word [...] "sidescuttle" [...] instead of [...] "porthole" [...] is meant to be broad, including any covered or uncovered hole {{in the side of the}} vessel.|$|R

5000|$|Raises show either four-card {{or longer}} trump support or three-card support with a {{splinter}} in a known, adverse suit. Since the overcaller with the two-suited hand {{probably has a}} short holding in the <b>opening</b> <b>side's</b> trump suit, one expects the adversely held trumps to break unevenly. Thus, the <b>opening</b> <b>side</b> should have either nine or more trumps or good ruffing values in the hand with short trumps.|$|R

50|$|The <b>opening</b> <b>side</b> may {{defend against}} a Michaels cuebid {{or any other}} {{conventional}} two-suited overcall with the Unusual vs. Unusual convention. This defense assigns conventional meanings to a double and to cuebids of the suits shown by the two-suited overcall.|$|R

50|$|The main {{disadvantage}} of the strong-club system is its vulnerability to preemptive bids. Knowing that they rarely can make game against a strong-club opening, experienced opponents {{will compete in}} the bidding with distributional hands, regardless of strength, and rob bidding space from the <b>opening</b> <b>side.</b>|$|R
25|$|A pivot door, {{instead of}} hinges, is {{supported}} on a bearing {{some distance away}} from the edge, {{so that there is}} more or less of a gap on the pivot side as well as the <b>opening</b> <b>side.</b> In some cases the pivot is central, creating two equal openings.|$|R

5000|$|A {{squirrel}} {{is a term}} in debating jargon, {{particularly in}} parliamentary debate, that indicates a definition from the <b>side</b> of the <b>opening</b> speaker that makes it too easy {{for his or her}} side. The first speaker in a debate, who is defending the motion or proposition, generally has to define the terms used in the motion. When this definition is done in an unexpected way, it can favour the <b>opening</b> <b>side,</b> because that side had been able to prepare for the particular interpretation in the preparation time. For example, if the motion read [...] "This House Would dissolve the police", it would be a squirrel to refer to the band The Police instead of the police. Another squirrel in this case, that helps the <b>opening</b> <b>side</b> by making the debate generally easier for them, is to add unreasonable exceptions to the motion. For example, defending [...] "dissolving the police" [...] except in cases where it has to [...] "uphold the law" [...] is rather easy.|$|R

It features a four-blade main rotor and two-blade tail rotor.|$|R
50|$|This {{convention}} is {{an application of}} the Useful Space Principle and where a meaning is assigned to all available bids and therefore no bidding space is wasted. In some auctions there is an advantage to the opening team taking away bidding space from the overcalling team.In other cases the advancer might have no support for the overcall's suit but still {{have to make a}} preference bid, in this case the responder's bid means they can pass with the possibility that the <b>opening</b> <b>side</b> will be playing a three-level contract with a misfit.|$|R

However, episodes leading to WUDC 2008 use a modified form of the British Parliamentary format, with only the first four speakers of the <b>opening</b> <b>sides</b> of the house participating, although speeches still remain at the standard seven minutes. Episodes broadcast {{in the run-up to}} the Asian Universities Debating Championship used a modified Asian Parliamentary format, with five-minute speeches.

A 45-second instrumental portion of the song, titled [...] "A Bit More of You", appears on Extra Texture also, <b>opening</b> <b>side</b> two of the original LP format.

50|$|Although the Shelby Cobra {{concept was}} aimed {{to reflect the}} design of the AC Cobra, the concept is {{dimensionally}} very different from the original. However, the design includes many common external features, such as a large grille <b>opening,</b> <b>side</b> vents, and large wheel arches. In line with Carroll Shelby's designs, the concept has a very minimalist look, which is continued in the interior. The concept omits many features common in modern cars, such as air conditioning and a radio. The placement of the transmission in the rear allowed for the driver and passenger seats to be placed closer together, adding to the compactness of the Cobra.|$|R

50|$|The 2-AT was a high-wing {{conventional}} gear monoplane. The {{original design}} featured an open cockpit for the pilots, {{followed by an}} enclosed cockpit with <b>opening</b> <b>side</b> windows. The aircraft featured wallpaper, padded seats, semi-circular opening windows, and a bathroom. It was the first all-metal aircraft certified in America. It was eventually redesigned to accommodate three engines, becoming the Stout 3-AT trimotor, and again redesigned to become the more well-known Ford Trimotor. The aircraft was under development as a Stout aircraft when Ford bought all controlling interests, creating the Stout Metal Airplane Division of the Ford Motor Company. Development hastened with the infusion of resources from Ford.|$|R
