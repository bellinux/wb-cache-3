Measurements {{were made}} on yields, bean characteristics, {{specific}} leaf area, leaf temperature, leaf nutrient levels, nodal growth, <b>organoleptic</b> <b>quality</b> and photosynthetic response. Brewed coffee samples were analyzed using solid phase microextraction-gas chromatography to capture and analyze brewed coffee volatiles.

In addition, application of kaolin was explored using glass plates and slides to determine coverage and light transmittance. Shading did not appreciably affect <b>organoleptic</b> <b>quality.</b> Furthermore, brewed coffee volatiles were not good predictors of <b>organoleptic</b> <b>quality.</b> However, with few to no misclassifications, the volatiles could accurately predict group membership. Shading resulted in statistically different yields in the macadamia (16 % of sun) and kaolin (199 % of sun) treatments {{in the second year}}, although a negative, linear trend was observed with increased shading. The lack of significant differences in yields between the cloth shaded and sun treatments was likely a result of large yield variation. Bean sizes were generally larger in shaded treatments and only the percentage of defects and broken beans were lower for the kaolin treatment in the second year in Kunia. Kona bean sizes were larger in the sun treatment but no differences were observed in bean characteristics. Kaolin treated plants responded similarly to sun plants for most measurements, although the responses tended to be more extreme when compared to the shade cloth and macadamia treatments. Kaolin treated leaves were 3. 4 °C cooler than sun leaves and photosynthesized 71 % more CO 2 than sun plants. To explore the effects of shade level and type on coffee in Hawai'i, Coffea arabica L. was shaded with varying degrees of black and aluminized shade cloth, macadamia trees, and a novel, spray-on shade composed mostly of kaolin. These treatments were compared to unshaded coffee. Two locations were used in this experiment: Kunia, O'ahu and Kona, Hawai'i.
