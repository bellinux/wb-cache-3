50|$|Charles F. Brannock (May 16, 1903 - November 22, 1992) was the {{inventor}} and manufacturer {{of the familiar}} Brannock Device for measuring <b>overall</b> <b>length,</b> <b>width,</b> and heel-to-ball length of the foot. Brannock, proprietor of the successful Park-Brannock Shoe Store in Syracuse, New York, developed the device in 1925. The instrument was a sales aid, but by ensuring more accurate fittings, the device also helped his customers alleviate or avoid foot problems due to ill-fitting shoes. Brannock also developed specially calibrated devices for the various branches of the military, which issued millions of boots and shoes to servicemen, especially during World War II. Though there were competing measuring devices on the market, the Brannock Device quickly became the industry standard and is still used in shoe stores all over the world.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{introduces}} new revolute and torsional lamina emergent mechanism (LEM) flex-ure {{designs that}} are suited {{for use in}} metals. Previous LEM flexures have been designed for use in highly elastic materials, such as polymers. In extending LEM flexure designs to metals, a LEM flexure design criteria is also introduced. The LEM flexure criteria is based on relative perfor-mance between the LEM flexure and a performance datum which the LEM flexure must improve upon. This performance datum, or benchmark, is a section of lamina that is of the same <b>overall</b> <b>length,</b> <b>width,</b> and thickness as the LEM flexure. An analysis of the revolute and torsional metal LEM flexures, based on the LEM flexure criteria, is performed and both are found to success-fully meet the criteria. A brief comparative performance study is also carried out between a basic crank-slider mechanism to which the revolute and torsional metal LEM flexures have and have not been applied. The revolute and torsional metal LEM flexures are found to improve the crank-slider performance...|$|E
40|$|To {{provide a}} healthy {{environment}} inside buildings, {{there must be}} some exchange of indoor conditioned air with fresh outdoor air. The outdoor air is then mechanically conditioned to a comfortable temperature and humidity. Research suggests human health and productivity increase with the amount of fresh air available in buildings. This conflicts with the desire to reduce building energy use since the conditioning process is energy intensive, especially in warm and humid climates. While sensible heat recovery using a standard heat exchanger is of some value, much of the energy consumption is due to dehumidification of air. More substantial reductions in energy consumption can be obtained by preconditioning the supply air with the previously conditioned exhaust air using a porous polymer membrane heat and moisture exchanger. As membrane technology improves, the convective heat and mass transfer resistances in the airstream can become the dominant resistance in these devices. This requires potentially new flow passage architecture to optimize heat and mass transfer, while maintaining acceptable pressure loss. Thus, the objective {{of this study is to}} develop an analytical model of a counterflow membrane based heat and mass exchanger with different internal flow geometries using the Engineering Equations Solver (EES) platform. The exchanger consists of multiple supply and exhaust air streams flowing in counterflow, separated by a thin membrane layer. The air flow passages are either a bare high aspect rectangular channel, or a high aspect channel with a pin-fin spacer inserted. The model is discretized along the length of the exchanger to more accurately calculate the air and vapor properties along the exchanger. In each segment the model considers the coupled convective heat and mass transfer resistances in each air stream. Heat and mass transfer coefficients are related through the Chilton and Colburn analogy, while representative values for membrane thermal conductivity and effective diffusivity are obtained from the literature. Â Conservation of energy and mass in each segment provides closure to the model. The model is then used to parametrically evaluate the effect of various exchanger dimensions and operating conditions on the dominant heat and mass transfer resistances, sensible and latent effectiveness, and pressure loss of the exchanger. The primary dimensions considered are hydraulic diameter and geometry (i. e., high aspect versus pin filled channels) of the channels, number of channels, membrane thickness and <b>overall</b> <b>length,</b> <b>width</b> and depth of the exchanger. The effect of operating parameters including air flow rate, water diffusivity of the membrane and allowable pressure drop on system performance and dominant transport mechanisms are also explored. ...|$|E

40|$|The lateral {{dimensions}} of CdSe nanoplatelets {{have a strong}} and unique influence on their opto-electronic properties, with sizes that can be tuned from the weak to the strong exciton confinement regime. There are state-of-the-art reports on several nanoplatelet syntheses; however, at present only the thickness is well-controlled. We demonstrate here that we can achieve a control over the aspect ratio and overall nanoplate area by carefully adjusting the reagents that induce the in-plane growth. A variation of the fraction of hydrated Cd(OAc) (2) in a Cd(OAc) (2) /Cd(OAc) (2) center dot 2 H(2) O mixture tailors the nanoplatelet aspect ratio.

5000|$|The {{original}} {{plan for the}} cathedral at Indianapolis was revised, most likely to reduce its construction costs. Modifications to the plan reduced the <b>overall</b> <b>length</b> and <b>width</b> of the cathedral and eliminated its domes and two side chapels.

CtNWs {{were derived from}} acid hydrolysis (3 N HCl, 30 mL/g, 90 min, 104 °C) of chitin at 65 % yield and 86 % CrI. Deacetylation (50 % NaOH, 48 h, 50 °C) of CtNWs generated CsNWs with unchanged nanowhisker morphology and <b>overall</b> <b>length</b> and <b>width</b> dimensions, but a reduced CrI of 54 %. Successful step-wise exchanging the aqueous media with acetone, then D 2 O prevented agglomeration of nanowhiskers and enabled NMR detection of individual nanowhiskers. The crystalline structure of CtNWs and CsNWs provided different chemical environments for the glucosamine hydrogen atom H 2, splitting the NMR signals into 2 peaks (δ 3. 0 and δ 3. 35 ppm) which differed from that reported for soluble chitosan (δ 3. 2 ppm). Besides, 1 H– 13 C HSQC was only possible for CsNWs indicating the NMR phenomenon observed to represent that of the surfaces where the outer layers were highly mobile and less crystalline.

40|$|Dwarf {{embedded}} Fucus {{populations in}} the Northwest Atlantic Ocean are restricted to the upper intertidal zone in sandy salt marsh environments; they lack holdfasts and are from attached parental populations of F. spiralis or F. spiralis x F. vesiculosus hybrids after breakage and entanglement with halophytic marsh grasses. Dwarf forms are dichotomously branched, flat, and have a mean <b>overall</b> <b>length</b> and <b>width</b> of 20. 3 and 1. 3 mm, respectively. Thus, they are longer than Irish (mean 9. 3 mm) and Alaskan (mean 15. 0 mm) populations identified as F cottonii. Reciprocal transplants of different Fucus taxa in a Maine salt marsh confirm that F spiralis can become transformed into dwarf embedded thalli within the high intertidal zone, while the latter can grow into F. s. ecad lutarius within the mid intertidal zone. Thus, vertical transplantation can modify fucoid morphology and result in varying ecads. Microsatellite markers indicate that attached F spiralis and F vesiculosus are genetically distinct, while dwarf forms may arise via hybridization between the two taxa. The ratio of intermediate to species-specific-genotypes decreased with larger thalli.

These factors also determine {{the life of the}} tyres. However, there is no accepted method to measure tyre wear against the factors mentioned above. At present, lifespan of tyres is determined through field tests where the tyres are used in different industries and collecting data on tyre life in terms of running hours. Another method is to use a drum-type apparatus with bonded abrasive paper or abrasive particles between the tyre and the drum. The limitations of these methods include the time requirement and inaccuracies in data to enable accurate analysis of tyre life. As a result, the tyre manufacturers find it difficult to specify the tyre life with adequate degree of certainty to the customers.

Many non-destructive {{models have been}} proposed for leaf area estimation of several plant genotypes, demonstrating that leaf <b>length,</b> leaf <b>width</b> and leaf area are closely correlated. Thus, the objective of our study {{was to develop a}} reliable model for leaf area estimation from linear measurements of leaf dimensions for citrus genotypes. Materials and methods. Leaves of citrus genotypes were harvested, and their dimensions (<b>length,</b> <b>width</b> and area) were measured. Values of leaf area were regressed against <b>length,</b> <b>width,</b> the square of length, the square of width and the product (<b>length</b> × <b>width).</b> The most accurate equations, either linear or second- order polynomial, were regressed again with a new data set; then the most reliable equation was defined. Results and discussion. The first analysis showed that the variables <b>length,</b> <b>width</b> and the square of length gave better results in second-order polynomial equations, while the linear equations were more suitable and accurate when the width and the product (<b>length</b> × <b>width)</b> were used. When these equations were regressed with the new data set, the coefficient of determination (R 2) and the agreement index 'd' were higher for the one that used the variable product (<b>length</b> × <b>width),</b> while the Mean Absolute Percentage Error was lower.
