5|$|A number <b>of</b> <b>protective</b> {{measures}} have been implemented, including site access restrictions, the collection and cold-storage of seed, and the treatment of plants with phosphite. Phosphite boosts the resistance of both infected and uninfected plants, and also acts as a direct fungicide. Aerial spraying of phosphite boosts plant survival and slows the spread of infection, but must be carefully managed {{as studies have shown}} that foliar spraying of phosphite adversely affects root and shoot growth. Direct injection of phosphite into the stem of each tree appears to lack this disadvantage, but is costly to administer and restricted to known plants.|$|E
5|$|An {{expert panel}} of {{engineers}} {{released a report}} outlining concerns regarding the decreased loop ramp radii and a lack <b>of</b> <b>protective</b> guardrail at sharp curves, {{in addition to the}} lack of a concrete median barrier to separate the opposite directions of travel. However, it was also argued that the large grass median was sufficient to prevent cross-over collisions, given that Highway410 has a similar median.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} form <b>of</b> <b>protective</b> mimicry is Müllerian mimicry, {{discovered by}} and {{named after the}} naturalist Fritz Müller. In Müllerian mimicry both model and mimic are aposematic, so mimicry may be mutual, does not necessarily constitute a bluff or deception, and as in the wasps and bees may involve many species in a mimicry ring.|$|E

5|$|Prevention {{measures}} include use <b>of</b> <b>protective</b> {{technology in}} vehicles, such as seat belts and sports or motorcycle helmets, {{as well as}} efforts {{to reduce the number}} of collisions, such as safety education programs and enforcement of traffic laws. Depending on the injury, treatment required may be minimal or may include interventions such as medications, emergency surgery or surgery years later. Physical therapy, speech therapy, recreation therapy, occupational therapy and vision therapy may be employed for rehabilitation. Counseling, supported employment, and community support services may also be useful.|$|E

30|$|While the {{aforementioned}} physiological and biomechanical investigations examine the impact <b>of</b> firefighters’ <b>protective</b> system on their mobility and work efficiency providing quantitative evidence, investigation about firefighters’ input and needs for protective systems {{is also an}} important element in improving the design <b>of</b> their <b>protective</b> system. (Huck 1988) and Akbar-Khanzadeh et al. (1995) claimed that increased wearability and proper usage <b>of</b> the <b>protective</b> clothing system can be achieved only when human factors and user input are included in the design process. The two studies further stated that lack of an understanding of user perception and demand can result in improper or no use <b>of</b> the <b>protective</b> system. Boorady et al. (2013) and Sinden et al. (2013) claimed that firefighters’ perception about the performance of their turnout clothing should be considered to improve the design <b>of</b> their <b>protective</b> system. The two studies suggested that designers should take into account the wearers’ gender specific issues (e.g., body shape and size) and human factors in their job-related tasks and also upheld that female firefighters are more vulnerable to ill-fitting protective clothing.|$|R

5|$|Women {{are more}} prone to UTIs than men because, in females, the urethra is much shorter and closer to the anus.

Additionally, vaginal atrophy that can sometimes occur after menopause is associated with recurrent urinary tract infections.|$|E
5|$|Barkley and {{his wife}} Dorothy took a {{vacation}} after the convention, returning to Kentucky in August 1928 to find that, in his absence, Barkley had been chosen state chairman of Smith's campaign. He campaigned for Smith, but Herbert Hoover won a landslide victory. After the election, Barkley led a coalition of liberal Democrats and Republicans that opposed Hoover's use <b>of</b> <b>protective</b> tariffs, a debate that took particular urgency following the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Barkley opposed the Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act, claiming it would cost Americans both jobs and exports, but Congress approved it, and Hoover signed it on June 17, 1930. When Congress adjourned, Barkley accompanied Sherwood Eddy and fellow senators Burton K. Wheeler and Bronson M. Cutting to the Soviet Union in August 1930. He {{was impressed by the}} industrial development brought about by Joseph Stalin's first five-year plan but did not advocate closer diplomatic ties with the Communist nation, as some of his colleagues did.|$|E
5|$|Batesian mimicry {{is a case}} <b>of</b> <b>protective</b> or {{defensive}} mimicry, {{where the}} mimic does best by avoiding confrontations with the signal receiver. It is a disjunct system, which means that all three parties are from different species. Batesian mimicry stands in contrast to other forms such as aggressive mimicry, where the mimic profits from interactions with the signal receiver. One such case of this is in fireflies, where females of one species mimic the mating signals of another species, deceiving males to come close {{enough for them to}} eat. Mimicry need not involve a predator at all though. Such is the case in dispersal mimicry, where the mimic once again benefits from the encounter. For instance, some fungi have their spores dispersed by insects by smelling like carrion. In protective mimicry, the meeting between mimic and dupe is not such a fortuitous occasion for the mimic, and the signals it mimics tend to lower the probability of such an encounter.|$|E

5|$|Born in Philadelphia to {{a family}} active in Whig {{politics}}, Randall shifted to the Democratic Party after the Whigs' demise. His rise in politics began in the 1850s with election to the Philadelphia Common Council {{and then to the}} Pennsylvania State Senate. Randall served in a Union cavalry unit in the American Civil War before winning a seat in the federal House of Representatives in 1862. He was reelected every two years thereafter until his death. The representative of an industrial region, Randall became known as a staunch defender <b>of</b> <b>protective</b> tariffs designed to assist domestic producers of manufactured goods. While often siding with Republicans on tariff issues, he differed with them in his resistance to Reconstruction and the growth of federal power.|$|E
5|$|From {{his first}} term in Congress, McKinley was a strong {{advocate}} <b>of</b> <b>protective</b> tariffs. The primary purposes of such imposts was not to raise revenue, but to allow American manufacturing to develop by giving it a price advantage in the domestic market over foreign competitors. McKinley biographer Margaret Leech noted that Canton had become prosperous as a center for the manufacture of farm equipment because of protection, and that this may have helped form his political views. McKinley introduced and supported bills that raised protective tariffs, and opposed those that lowered them or imposed tariffs simply to raise revenue. Garfield's election as president in 1880 created a vacancy on the House Ways and Means Committee; McKinley was selected to fill it, placing him on the most powerful committee after only two terms.|$|E
5|$|Personal {{interaction}} with the gods took many forms. People who wanted information or advice consulted oracles, run by temples, {{that were supposed to}} convey gods' answers to questions. Amulets and other images <b>of</b> <b>protective</b> deities were used to ward off the demons that might threaten human well-being or to impart the god's positive characteristics to the wearer. Private rituals invoked the gods' power to accomplish personal goals, from healing sickness to cursing enemies. These practices used heka, the same force of magic that the gods used, which the creator was said to have given to humans so they could fend off misfortune. The performer of a private rite often took on the role of a god in a myth, or even threatened a deity, to involve the gods in accomplishing the goal. Such rituals coexisted with private offerings and prayers, and all three were accepted means of obtaining divine help.|$|E

5|$|Camouflage is an {{important}} defense strategy, which {{involves the use of}} coloration or shape to blend into the surrounding environment. This sort <b>of</b> <b>protective</b> coloration is common and widespread among beetle families, especially those that feed on wood or vegetation, such as many of the leaf beetles (family Chrysomelidae) or weevils. In some of these species, sculpturing or various colored scales or hairs cause the beetle to resemble bird dung or other inedible objects. Many of those that live in sandy environments blend in with the coloration of the substrate. Most phasmids are known for effectively replicating the forms of sticks and leaves, and the bodies of some species (such as O. macklotti and Palophus centaurus) are covered in mossy or lichenous outgrowths that supplement their disguise. Some species have the ability to change color as their surroundings shift (B. scabrinota, T. californica). In a further behavioral adaptation to supplement crypsis, a number of species have been noted to perform a rocking motion where the body is swayed from side to side that is thought to reflect the movement of leaves or twigs swaying in the breeze. Another method by which stick insects avoid predation and resemble twigs is by feigning death (catalepsy), where the insect enters a motionless state that can be maintained for a long period. The nocturnal feeding habits of adults also aids Phasmatodea in remaining concealed from predators.|$|E
5|$|In his {{capacity}} {{as a career}} officer, Taylor had never publicly revealed his political beliefs before 1848 nor voted before that time. He {{thought of himself as}} an independent, believing in a strong and sound banking system for the country, and thought that President Andrew Jackson, a Democrat, should not have allowed the Second Bank of the United States to collapse in 1836. He believed it was impractical to talk about expanding slavery into the western areas of the U.S., as he concluded that neither cotton nor sugar (both were produced in great quantities as a result of slavery) could be easily grown there through a plantation economy. He was also a firm nationalist, and due to his experience of seeing many people die as a result of warfare, he believed that secession was not a good way to resolve national problems. Taylor, although he did not agree with their stand in favor <b>of</b> <b>protective</b> tariffs and expensive internal improvements, aligned himself with Whig Party governing policies: the President should not be able to veto a law, unless that law was against the Constitution; that the office should not interfere with Congress; and that the power of collective decision-making, as well as the Cabinet, should be strong.|$|E
5|$|Mail {{service was}} chaotic during the stampede. Apart {{from the number}} of prospectors, two major {{obstacles}} stood in its way. To begin with, any mail from America to Dawson City was sent to Juneau in South-east Alaska before being sent through Dawson and then down the Yukon to Circle City. From here it was then distributed by the US Post Office back up to Dawson. The huge distances involved resulted in delays of several months and frequently the loss <b>of</b> <b>protective</b> envelopes and their addresses. The second problem was in Dawson itself, which initially lacked a post office and therefore relied on two stores and a saloon to act as informal delivery points. The NWMP were tasked to run the mail system by October 1897, but they were ill-trained to do so. Up to 5,700 letters might arrive in a single shipment, all of which had to be collected in person from the post office. This resulted in huge queues, with claimants lining up outside the office for up to three days. Those who had no time and could afford it would pay others to stand in line for them, preferably a woman since they were allowed to get ahead in line out of politeness. Postage stamps, like paper in general, were scarce and rationed to two per customer. By 1899, trained postal staff took over mail delivery and relieved the NWMP of this task.|$|E
