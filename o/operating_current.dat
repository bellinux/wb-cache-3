40|$|Abstract—Low current applications, like neuromorphic circuits, where <b>operating</b> <b>currents</b> {{can be as}} low as a few nanoamperes or less, {{suffer from}} huge {{transistor}} mismatches, resulting in around or less than 1 -bit precisions. Recently, a neuromorphic programmable-kernel 2 -D convolution chip has been reported where each pixel included two compact calibrated digital-to-analog converters (DACs) of 5 -bit resolution, for currents down to picoamperes. Those DACs were based on MOS ladder structures, which although compact require 3 + 1 unit transistors (is the number of calibration bits). Here, we present a new calibration approach not based on ladders, but on individually calibratable current sources made with MOS transistors of digitally adjustable length, which require only-sized transistors. The scheme includes a translinear circuit-based tuning scheme, which allows us to expand the operating range of the calibrated circuits with graceful precision degradation, over four decades of <b>operating</b> <b>currents.</b> Experimental results are provided for 5 -bit resolution DACs operating at 20 nA using two different translinear tuning schemes. Maximum measured precision is 5. 05 and 7. 15 b, respectively, for the two DAC schemes. Index Terms—Analog, calibration, mismatch, subthreshold. I...|$|R
