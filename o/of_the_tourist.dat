5|$|Early in the series, Hyun-jun and Seung-hee {{encounter}} a young Japanese schoolgirl while in Akita {{by the name}} of Yuki (Karen Miyama). Her family operates one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tourist</b> traps nearby, and she exhibits affection for Hyun-jun and attempts to find herself in his company as much as possible. Later, it is Hyun-jun that needs her, as Yuki and her family help him when he needs them most.|$|E
5|$|Goods-only trains were a rarity, and {{the usual}} {{practice}} was to attach goods wagons to any scheduled passenger services. Whilst the shunting of wagons at intermediate stations no doubt added to the interest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tourist</b> and occasional traveller, it also added marginally to the journey time.|$|E
5|$|The Vallée Blanche Cable Car is {{normally}} used by visitors travelling {{from one or}} other <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tourist</b> centres of Chamonix or Courmayeur and gives views over the glaciated regions of the massif.

5|$|A {{significant}} {{but small}} percentage of people have employment {{in the oil industry}} owing to the proximity of oil rigs on the Cromarty Firth. Other locally significant industries include forestry, tourism and catering. A significant number of people work in larger nearby localities, such as Inverness, Dingwall, Alness and Invergordon, which is why only 14% of households in the zone own no car. 10.4% {{of the population of the}} zone are self-employed, and 28% economically inactive, roughly corresponding with the Highland averages. There are also two hotels and two bars, which soak up much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tourist</b> income that the town generates.|$|E
5|$|Although Disston's {{engineered}} canals aided {{water transport}} and steamboat traffic in Florida, he was ultimately unsuccessful in draining the Kissimmee River floodplain or lowering the surface water around Lake Okeechobee {{and in the}} Everglades. He was forced to sell much of his investments {{at a fraction of}} their original costs. However, his land purchase primed Florida's economy and allowed railroad magnates Henry Flagler and Henry Plant to build rail lines down the east coast of Florida, and another joining the west coast, which directly led to the domination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tourist</b> and citrus industries in Florida. Disston's immediate impact was in the Philadelphia area, where he was active in Republican politics and a philanthropist, but his legacy is often associated with the draining and development of Florida.|$|E

5|$|Ben Nevis is {{becoming}} popular with ski mountaineers and boarders.

5|$|The Town of Hilton Head Island {{incorporated}} as a municipality in 1983 and is {{well known}} for its eco-friendly development. The town's Natural Resources Division enforces the Land Management Ordinance which minimizes the impact of development and governs the style of buildings and how they are situated amongst existing trees. As a result, Hilton Head Island enjoys an unusual amount of tree cover relative to the amount of development. Approximately 70% of the island, including most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tourist</b> areas, is located inside gated communities. However, the town maintains several public beach access points, including one for the exclusive use of town residents, who have approved several multimillion-dollar land-buying bond referendums to control commercial growth.|$|E

5|$|The bulk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tourist</b> {{industry}} is concentrated along the Adriatic Sea coast. Opatija {{was the first}} holiday resort {{since the middle of}} the 19th century. By the 1890s, it {{became one of the most}} significant European health resorts. Later a number of resorts sprang up along the coast and islands, offering services ranging from mass tourism to catering and various niche markets, the most significant being nautical tourism, as there are numerous marinas with more than 16thousand berths, cultural tourism relying on appeal of medieval coastal cities and numerous cultural events taking place during the summer. Inland areas offer mountain resorts, agrotourism and spas. Zagreb is also a significant tourist destination, rivalling major coastal cities and resorts.|$|E
5|$|The {{damage from}} Rosita made a large {{impact on the}} tourist industry. The time of impact {{happened}} just before the Easter and ANZAC Day Holiday period. Easter {{is considered to be}} the beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tourist</b> season, so it is usually expected that there will be an increase of visitors into Broome at this time. Many visitors delayed or cancelled their trips, and some cut short their holiday. Car hire companies that had been booked out for the holiday period had people returning vehicles early.|$|E
5|$|The first {{plans for}} an airport serving Notodden were {{launched}} in 1954 by Reidar Hedwig-Dahl, director <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tourist</b> office. In late 1954 or early 1955, he held a meeting with Ludvig G. Braathen, owner of Braathens SAFE, and representatives for his airline. They saw Notodden as a possible gateway to Telemark and Braathen promised to start flying to an airport serving Notodden, should one be built. At the time, Braathen had started flying to several smaller airports in Norway using a fleet of de Havilland Heron aircraft. Braathen had been traveling around Norway and encouraging municipalities to build regional airports, stating that he wanted more but smaller airports than the central authorities were planning. He succeeded at having similar airports built in Hamar and Røros.|$|E
50|$|Every year, Lloret welcomes 12% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tourists</b> {{who visit}} Catalonia and over 40% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tourists</b> who visit <b>the</b> Costa Brava.

40|$|AbstractThe {{primary purpose}} of graphic map design was to {{determine}} the factors for each types of map that can meet <b>the</b> demand <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tourists</b> who are different in their destination. The graphic map factors enable us to know the target group and type of map they used that provides the accurate information corresponding to their actual need. Methodologically, the simulation viewing questionnaires were used to examine the opinion and need <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tourists</b> whose interest was different with <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> map they used. In case study, the sample included <b>the</b> foreign <b>tourists</b> in Bangkok territory. This paper examined the graphic map design factors that meet <b>the</b> <b>tourist's</b> need. <b>The</b> results are expected to be used as useful guidelines for map design that satisfies <b>the</b> <b>tourists</b> in context <b>of</b> Thai social and cultural environment that can be recognized at international level. It's not only useful to those tourists, but also to general people...|$|R
5|$|All {{significant}} {{stages of}} the history of England are represented within the city, from the Roman Baths (including their significant Celtic presence), to Bath Abbey and the Royal Crescent, to the more recent Thermae Bath Spa. The size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tourist</b> industry is reflected in the almost 300 places of accommodation– including more than 80 hotels, two of which have 'five-star' ratings, over 180 bed and breakfasts– many of which are located in Georgian buildings, and two campsites located on {{the western edge of the}} city. The city also has about 100 restaurants and a similar number of pubs and bars. Several companies offer open top bus tours around the city, as well as tours on foot and on the river. Since the opening of Thermae Bath Spa in 2006, the city has attempted to recapture its historical position as the only town or city in the United Kingdom offering visitors the opportunity to bathe in naturally heated spring waters.|$|E
5|$|The {{labour force}} is 2.45million people, of whom 7.1 per cent are {{employed}} in agriculture, 35.2 per cent {{are employed in}} industry and 57.7 per cent are employed in the services sector. Extraction of metals and minerals, production of chemicals, machinery and vehicle components, petroleum refining and steel are among the major industrial activities. Mining and its related industries employ a total of 120,000 people and generate about five per cent of the country's GDP. Bulgaria is Europe's sixth-largest coal producer. Local deposits of coal, iron, copper and lead are vital for the manufacturing and energy sectors. Almost all top export items of Bulgaria are industrial commodities such as oil products, copper products and pharmaceuticals. Bulgaria is also a net exporter of agricultural and food products, of which two-thirds go to OECD countries. It is the largest global producer of perfumery essential oils such as lavender and rose oil. Agriculture has declined significantly {{in the past two}} decades. Production in 2008 amounted to only 66 per cent of that between 1999 and 2001, while cereal and vegetable yields have dropped by nearly 40 per cent since 1990. Of the services sector, tourism is the most significant contributor to economic growth. In recent years, Bulgaria has emerged as a travelling destination with its inexpensive resorts and beaches outside the reach <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tourist</b> industry. Lonely Planet ranked it among its top 10 destinations for 2011. Most of the visitors are British, Romanian, German and Russian. The capital Sofia, the medieval capital Veliko Tarnovo, coastal resorts Golden Sands and Sunny Beach and winter resorts Bansko, Pamporovo and Borovets are some of the locations most visited by tourists.|$|E
