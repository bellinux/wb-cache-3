2500|$|Harold Gans, {{a former}} Cryptanalyst at the National Security Agency, argued that MBBK's {{hypothesis}} implies a conspiracy between WRR and their co-contributors to fraudulently tune the appellations in advance. Gans {{argues that the}} conspiracy must include Doron Witztum, Eliyahu Rips, and S. Z. Havlin, because all <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>say</b> that Havlin compiled the appellations independently. Gans argues further that such a conspiracy must include the multiple rabbis who have written a letter confirming the accuracy of Havlin's list. Finally, argues Gans, such a conspiracy must also include the multiple participants of the cities experiment conducted by Gans (which includes Gans himself). Gans concludes that [...] "the number of people necessarily involved in [...] will stretch the credulity of any reasonable person." [...] Gans further argued that while [...] "the mathematical issues are difficult for non-mathematicians to comprehend, I can summarize as follows: Professor McKay and his colleagues never claimed to have discovered real codes in those non-Torah texts. Their only “successful” results were obtained by deliberately rigging the experiment {{in such a way}} that the layman wouldn’t recognize the mathematical flaws." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sports {{injuries}} {{are often the}} result of overuse or trauma to {{a part of the}} body. [...] An issue unique to youth athletics is that the participants’ bones are still growing, making them especially at risk for injury. Around 8,000 children are rushed to the emergency room daily because of sports injuries. High school athletes suffer approximately 715,000 injuries annually. In American football, for instance, five times as many catastrophic injuries happen in high school as in college-level competition. Injuries include heat illness and dehydration, concussions, and trauma-related deaths. [...] Heat illnesses are a rising concern in youth athletics. These illnesses include heat syncope, muscle cramps, heat exhaustion, heat stroke and exertional hyponatremia. [...] Each year, high school athletes sustain 300,000 head injuries, of which 90% are concussions. By the start of high school, 53% of athletes will have already suffered a concussion, but fewer than 50% <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>say</b> anything because they are concerned they will be removed from play. Ice hockey, soccer, lacrosse, wrestling and basketball have a high risk of concussion, with football carrying the most risk. A history of concussion in a football player can contribute to sports-related sudden death.|$|E
