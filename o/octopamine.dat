5|$|Numerous other {{abnormalities}} {{have been}} described in hepatic encephalopathy, although their relative contribution to the disease state is uncertain. Loss of glutamate transporter gene expression (especially EAAT 2) {{has been attributed to}} acute liver failure. Benzodiazepine-like compounds have been detected at increased levels as well as abnormalities in the GABA neurotransmission system. An imbalance between aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine, tryptophan and tyrosine) and branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine and valine) has been described; this would lead to the generation of false neurotransmitters (such <b>octopamine</b> and 2-hydroxyphenethylamine). Dysregulation of the serotonin system, too, has been reported. Depletion of zinc and accumulation of manganese may play a role. Inflammation elsewhere in the body may precipitate encephalopathy through the action of cytokines and bacterial lipopolysaccharide on astrocytes.|$|E
25|$|The {{biosynthesis}} of synephrine in Citrus {{species is}} believed to follow the pathway: tyrosine → tyramine → N-methyltyramine → synephrine, involving the enzymes tyrosine decarboxylase in the first step, tyramine N-methyltransferase in the second, and N-methyl-tyramine-β-hydroxylase in the third. This pathway differs from that thought to occur in animals, involving octopamine: tyramine → <b>octopamine</b> → synephrine, where the conversion of tyramine to <b>octopamine</b> is mediated by dopamine-β-hydroxylase, and the conversion of <b>octopamine</b> to synephrine by phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase.|$|E
25|$|In insects, synephrine {{has been}} found to be a very potent agonist at many {{invertebrate}} <b>octopamine</b> receptor preparations, and is even more potent than <b>octopamine</b> at a locust (Schistocerca americana gregaria) nerve-muscle preparation. Synephrine (racemic) is also more potent than <b>octopamine</b> (racemic) at inducing light-emission in the firefly (Photinus species) light organ. Synephrine exhibits similarly high potency in stimulating adenylate cyclase activity and in decreasing clotting time in lobster (Homarus americanus) hematocytes. Racemic synephrine was found to increase cAMP in the abdominal epidermis of the blood-sucking bug, Rhodnius prolixus. Rachinsky reported that synephrine was equipotent with <b>octopamine</b> in stimulating JH (juvenile hormone) release in the corpora allata of honey bee (Apis mellifera), but Woodring and Hoffmann found that synephrine had no effect on the synthesis of JH III, in in vitro preparations from the cricket, Gryllus bimaculatus.|$|E

25|$|In the {{nematode}} C. elegans, artificial {{depletion of}} serotonin or {{the increase of}} <b>octopamine</b> cues behavior typical of a low-food environment: C. elegans becomes more active, and mating and egg-laying are suppressed, while the opposite occurs if serotonin is increased or <b>octopamine</b> is decreased in this animal. Serotonin is necessary for normal nematode male mating behavior, and the inclination to leave food {{to search for a}} mate. The serotonergic signaling used to adapt the worm's behaviour to fast changes in the environment affects insulin-like signaling and the TGF beta signaling pathway, which control long-term adaption.|$|E
25|$|Iprindole {{has been}} shown to be a potent {{inhibitor}} of the aromatic hydroxylation and/or N-dealkylation-mediated metabolism of many substances including, but not limited to <b>octopamine,</b> amphetamine, methamphetamine, fenfluramine, phenelzine, tranylcypromine, trimipramine, and fluoxetine, likely via inactivating cytochrome P450 enzymes. It also inhibits its own metabolism.|$|E
25|$|There are {{multiple}} ways of considering {{the cause of}} directional selection on this set of foraging behaviors in honey bees. A proximate factor {{is one that is}} developmental and influential on behavior within the lifetime of an organism. Neurological and developmental differences lead to directional selection and changes in the set of foraging behaviors between generations of honey bees. Levels of stress as measured by levels of <b>octopamine</b> is one such contributing developmental factor.|$|E
25|$|If {{lobsters}} are {{injected with}} serotonin, they behave like dominant individuals whereas <b>octopamine</b> causes subordinate behavior. A crayfish that is frightened may flip its tail to flee, {{and the effect}} of serotonin on this behavior depends largely on the animal's social status. Serotonin inhibits the fleeing reaction in subordinates, but enhances it in socially dominant or isolated individuals. The reason for this is social experience alters the proportion between serotonin receptors (5-HT receptors) that have opposing effects on the fight-or-flight response. The effect of 5-HT1 receptors predominates in subordinate animals, while 5-HT2 receptors predominates in dominants.|$|E
25|$|Serotonin {{functions}} as a neurotransmitter in the nervous systems of most animals. For example, in the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans, which feeds on bacteria, serotonin is released as a signal in response to positive events, such as finding {{a new source of}} food or in male animals finding a female with which to mate. When a well-fed worm feels bacteria on its cuticle, dopamine is released, which slows it down; if it is starved, serotonin also is released, which slows the animal down further. This mechanism increases the amount of time animals spend in the presence of food. The released serotonin activates the muscles used for feeding, while <b>octopamine</b> suppresses them. Serotonin diffuses to serotonin-sensitive neurons, which control the animal's perception of nutrient availability.|$|E
500|$|It {{had long}} been {{believed}} that arthropods were an exception to this with dopamine being seen as having an adverse effect. Reward was seen to be mediated instead by <b>octopamine,</b> [...] a neurotransmitter closely related to norepinephrine. More recent studies however have shown that dopamine does {{play a part in}} reward learning in fruit flies. Also it has been found that the rewarding effect of <b>octopamine</b> is due to its activating a set of dopaminergic neurons not previously accessed in the research.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{study was}} {{conducted}} concerning an effect by the mothers of the flesh fly population. [...] There is a maternal effect that operates in S. bullata that can prevent pupal diapause when reared under short day conditions. It was determined that certain environmental stressors or chemical treatments on the mother, such as extreme temperature shocks, food deprivation and reducing maternal size, were ineffective in altering the diapause-suppressant. However, there were several chemical agents that proved effective. Gamma-aminobutyric acid, <b>octopamine</b> and pilocarpine all countered the maternal affect and permitted the expression of diapause in the flesh fly progeny. [...] The ability to express diapause is an important consideration for forensic entomologists as diapause allows the pupae to become metabollically [...] "dormant" [...] until environmental conditions improve; this would significantly affect pupal time estimations and subsequent post-mortem interval estimations.|$|E
50|$|One study {{noted that}} <b>octopamine</b> {{might be an}} {{important}} amine that influences the therapeutic effects of inhibitors such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors, especially because a large increase in <b>octopamine</b> levels was observed when animals were treated with this inhibitor. <b>Octopamine</b> was positively identified in the urine samples of mammals such as humans, rats, and rabbits treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Very small amounts of <b>octopamine</b> were also found in certain animal tissues. It was observed that within a rabbit's body, the heart and kidney held the highest concentrations of <b>octopamine.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Octopamine</b> acts as {{the insect}} {{equivalent}} of norepinephrine and has been implicated in regulating aggression in invertebrates, with different effects on different species. Studies have shown that reducing the neurotransmitter <b>octopamine</b> and preventing coding of tyramine beta hydroxylase (an enzyme that converts tyramine to <b>octopamine)</b> decreases aggression in Drosophila without influencing other behaviors.|$|E
50|$|<b>Octopamine</b> {{also plays}} a role in mollusks, though the role of <b>octopamine</b> has been {{examined}} only in the central nervous system of the model organism, the pond snail.|$|E

50|$|In mammals, <b>octopamine</b> may {{mobilize}} {{the release of}} fat from adipocytes (fat cells), {{which has led to}} its promotion on the internet as a slimming aid. However, the released fat is likely to be promptly taken up into other cells, and {{there is no evidence that}} <b>octopamine</b> facilitates weight loss. <b>Octopamine</b> may also increase blood pressure significantly when combined with other stimulants, as in some weight loss supplements.|$|E
50|$|In lobsters, <b>octopamine</b> {{seems to}} direct and {{coordinate}} neurohormones {{to some extent}} in the central nervous system, and {{it was observed that}} injecting <b>octopamine</b> into a lobster and crayfish resulted in limb and abdomen extension.|$|E
5000|$|This enzyme {{belongs to}} the family of lyases, {{specifically}} the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds.

5000|$|If one has had {{repeated}} exposure to tyramine, however, {{there is a}} decreased pressor response; tyramine is degraded to <b>octopamine,</b> which is subsequently packaged in synaptic vesicles with norepinephrine (noradrenaline). Therefore, after repeated tyramine exposure, these vesicles contain an increased amount of <b>octopamine</b> and a relatively reduced amount of norepinephrine. When these vesicles are secreted upon tyramine ingestion, there is a decreased pressor response, as less norepinephrine is secreted into the synapse, and <b>octopamine</b> does not activate alpha or beta adrenergic receptors. :) ...|$|E
5000|$|Norepinephrine {{has been}} {{reported}} to exist {{in a wide variety of}} animal species, including protozoa, placozoa and cnidaria (jellyfish and related species), but not in ctenophores (comb jellies), whose nervous systems differ greatly from those of other animals. [...] It is generally present in deuterostomes (vertebrates, etc.), but in protostomes (arthropods, molluscs, flatworms, nematodes, annelids, etc.) it is replaced by <b>octopamine,</b> a closely related chemical with a closely related synthesis pathway. [...] In insects, <b>octopamine</b> has alerting and activating functions that correspond (at least roughly) with the functions of norepinephrine in vertebrates. It has been argued that <b>octopamine</b> evolved to replace norepinephrine rather than vice versa; however, the nervous system of amphioxus (a primitive chordate) {{has been reported}} to contain <b>octopamine</b> but not norepinephrine, which presents difficulties for that hypothesis.|$|E

50|$|It's {{thought that}} the mode of action of amitraz {{involves}} the interaction with the neuromodulator <b>octopamine.</b> This interaction is probably the reason for increased nervous activity of ticks as a response on amitraz.Usual activation of the receptors may lead {{to changes in the}} concentration of intracellular second messengers such as cyclic nucleotides cyclic AMP (cAMP) and cyclic GMP, inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate and Ca2+. Influencing this signal transduction system can lead to various events depending on the celltype.Since it has been discovered that the <b>octopamine</b> receptor coding gene is expressed on very high rates in the somata of the honeybee brain, it is suggested that it is involved in the processing of sensory inputs, antennal motor outputs and higher-order brain functions.The amitraz-octopamine receptor interaction restrains these normal functions of the <b>octopamine</b> receptor. Therefore, it is efficient as an insect-pesticide.Still, resistance against amitraz can occur. A mutation can lead to a working version of the <b>octopamine</b> receptor but with an altered pesticide target side. This is probably the case for a very resistant Brazilian and Mexican tick strain, which have two nucleotide substitutions on the <b>octopamine</b> receptor coding gene compared with the Australian strains.A closer understanding of these resistance meachnisms would help to develop more rapid and accurate diagnostic tools for detecting resistance and steer development of alternative acaricides.|$|E

50|$|In the 1970s Kravitz's {{laboratory}} {{turned their}} focus back to neurotransmitters. After finding evidence that glutamate {{acts as an}} excitatory transmitter in crustaceans, they found that acetylcholine functions as the lobster sensory transmitter compound. Around this time, the laboratory also began experimenting with the neuroamines serotonin and <b>octopamine.</b> By trying to understand how naturally occurring neuromodulators might act, Margaret Livingstone, {{a graduate student at}} the time, injected serotonin or <b>octopamine</b> into two different lobsters. The results were surprising: the lobster injected with serotonin stood tall and looked just like a dominant animal while the lobster injected with <b>octopamine</b> adopted a lowered posture and looked like a subordinate animal. These lobster injection experiments were the birth of the aggressive behavior studies that are still ongoing in Kravitz's laboratory today.|$|E
