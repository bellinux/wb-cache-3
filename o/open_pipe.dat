5|$|In {{the early}} days, houses were wooden boards fronted by a four-board-high fence which was fronted with a boardwalk. Most {{of the streets}} were dirt roads. Winters were bitterly cold, and teams of horses {{dragging}} V-shaped wooden plows cleared the streets. In {{the center of town}} was the community pump, from which the village would draw water at stipulated hours. Water was pumped from the mine twice a day through a big <b>open</b> <b>pipe.</b> Everyone had to carry water home during pumping time. There was no shutoff valve, so buckets, tubs and barrels were used for water storage. Later, a water tower was built to hold water drawn from a deep well. St. Bernard dogs helped carry the water from the well to the homes. Running water and bathtubs came only after ditches were dug for pipes to provide water from Gilbert around 1916. Kerosene lamps provided the means of lighting until 1916, when power lines were installed. Initially, the only telephone was at the Elba mine office.|$|E

2500|$|Wethey {{asserts that}} [...] "although Greek by descent and Italian by artistic preparation, the artist became so {{immersed}} in the religious environment of Spain that he became the most vital visual representative of Spanish mysticism". The same scholar believes that in El Greco's mature works [...] "the devotional intensity of mood reflects the religious spirit of Roman Catholic Spain {{in the period of}} the Counter-Reformation". El Greco often produces an <b>open</b> <b>pipe</b> between Earth and Heaven in his paintings. The Annunciation is one example of this spiritual conduit being present. The people, clouds, and other objects in many of his paintings open away from a central, empty passageway between the ground and the upper spiritual firmament. This is sometimes a subtle concavity in fabrics that implies a ghostly passageway that leads vertically from the people at the bottom to the angels {{at the top of the}} paintings. In other paintings, this central cylinder of open space is very prominent, providing a distinctive visionary style, due to the deep insights of the pious painter. These paintings imply that El Greco, himself, can see the holy path from common human existence toward a very real Heaven.|$|E
50|$|The end of {{the pipe}} {{opposite}} the mouth may be either open or closed (also known as Gedackt or stopped). A closed pipe sounds an octave lower than an <b>open</b> <b>pipe</b> of the same length. Also, an <b>open</b> <b>pipe</b> produces a tone in which both the even-numbered and the odd-numbered partials are present, while a stopped pipe produces a tone with odd-numbered partials. The tone of a stopped pipe tends to be gentler and sweeter than that of an <b>open</b> <b>pipe,</b> though this is largely {{at the discretion of}} the voicer.|$|E
50|$|The end of {{the pipe}} {{opposite}} the reed or mouth may be either open or closed (also known as stopped).

5000|$|The {{pitch of}} a rank of pipes is denoted {{by a number}} on the stop knob. A stop which speaks at unison pitch, or [...] "native pitch", is known as an 8′ (pronounced [...] "eight-foot") stop. This {{nomenclature}} refers to the approximate length of the longest pipe in a rank of <b>open</b> <b>pipes.</b> In a rank of stopped pipes, the lowest pipe is about 4 feet long, but because it sounds at unison pitch, it {{is also known as}} an 8′ stop.|$|R
5000|$|The {{nomenclature}} of a rank of <b>open</b> <b>pipes</b> (for example an [...] "8 foot" [...] (8 ft) Open diapason) {{refers to}} the length of the longest pipe in the rank. Thus the longest pipe, (C, two octaves below middle C) is 8 ft long. An 8 ft stop sounds at unison pitch, like a piano. In a rank of stopped pipes, the lowest pipe is 4 ft in length but sounds at unison pitch, so it is known as an 8' stop.|$|R

50|$|An-Nuway'imah {{is one of}} the few {{villages in}} the Jordan Valley that has access to spring water. The nearby spring is key to the economy of the village, as it relies on {{agriculture}} as a main source of income and food. The most widely-grown crops are bananas and vegetables. Previously, the water from Wadi Nuway'imah was channeled through <b>open</b> <b>pipes</b> which were vulnerable to contamination and water loss but the American Near East Refugee Aid has undergone a $233,000 project to protect the pipes. Today, the spring channels water to the village through enclosed and buried pipes and is used for multiple purposes.|$|R
50|$|The pitch {{produced}} by an organ pipe is determined in two fundamentally different ways. For a reed pipe it is determined mainly by the mechanical {{properties of the}} reed {{and the length of}} the protruding part. For the flue pipes it is determined by the shape of the air column inside the pipe and whether the column is open at the end.For those pipes the pitch is a function of its length, the wavelength of the sound {{produced by}} an <b>open</b> <b>pipe</b> being approximately twice its length. A pipe half the length of another will sound one octave higher. If the longest pipe, C, is 8 ft in length, the pipe one octave higher will be 4 ft long, and two octaves above (middle C) will be 2 ft long. A closed (stopped) pipe produces a sound one octave lower than an <b>open</b> <b>pipe.</b> For example, the lowest Gedackt / closed C pipe (2 octaves below middle C) will be 4 ft long.|$|E
50|$|The alphorn has no lateral {{openings}} {{and therefore}} gives the pure natural harmonic {{series of the}} <b>open</b> <b>pipe.</b> The notes of the natural harmonic series overlap, but do not exactly correspond, to notes found in the familiar chromatic scale in standard Western equal temperament. Most prominently within the alphorn's range, the 7th and 11th harmonics are particularly noticeable, because they fall between adjacent notes in the chromatic scale.|$|E
