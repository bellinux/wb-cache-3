The main result {{in the first part}} of this paper is a theorem which gives sufficient conditions for the ideal <b>of</b> <b>minors</b> <b>of</b> a matrix to be prime. This theorem is general enough to include interesting examples, such as the ideal <b>of</b> maximal <b>minors</b> <b>of</b> catalecticant matrices and their generalisations discussed in the second part of the paper. The second aim of this paper is to settle a specific problem raised by David Eisenbud and Frank-Olaf Schreyer on the primary decomposition of an ideal <b>of</b> maximal <b>minors.</b> We solve this problem by applying the theorem above together with some ad-hoc techniques. ...|$|R

Pennsylvania prosecutors use this law against adults who have consensual intercourse with 16- and 17-year-olds, and it would count as a misdemeanor offense. In 2005 JoAnne Epps, a former prosecutor and Temple University Beasley School of Law dean of academic affairs, stated that the corruption <b>of</b> <b>minors</b> charge {{is considered to be a}} separate crime from that of statutory rape; she stated that the consideration <b>of</b> whether a <b>minor</b> is consenting to sexual activity is a separate issue from whether someone is corrupting the minor's morals.|$|R

40|$|Legal {{institutions}} {{for the public}} protection <b>of</b> <b>minors</b> are at present regulatedby regulations enacted as civil legislation. This study looks at the reasonswhy this was the case. Catalan legislators continued down the road that Spanish state legislators had travelled beforehand. In fact, by this meansSpanish state legislators sought, and {{to a large extent}} succeeded in, unifying,standardising and including the regulations in this area into commonlaw. This process of "making civil" a task of the government had createddistortions, ranging from some decreases in citizen's guarantees when dealingwith the Government to considerable legal uncertainty. That is why itwould be wise to retrace our steps to make the government's work interms of the protection <b>of</b> <b>minors</b> more administrative. It is the right timeto do so. A process reforming the legislation for public protection of minorsis now under way in Catalonia. First, the Department of Justice is producinga draft law which will approve the second book of the Catalonia CivilCode, which regulates the protection <b>of</b> <b>minors.</b> At the same time, theDepartment of Social Action and Citizenship has begun the process to enacta new Law regulating childhood and adolescence. These legal texts willtherefore regulate the public and private institutions protecting minors anda legal regime will be established for them. The Civil Code should regulatethe legal/private {{institutions for}} the protection <b>of</b> <b>minors,</b> under the jurisdictionof civil legislation (art. 129 of the Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia). However, the legal and public institutions for the protection <b>of</b> <b>minors</b> shouldbe regulated within a governmental framework, as social services and publicprotection <b>of</b> <b>minors</b> (art. 166 <b>of</b> the Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia). Despite this, {{to the extent that the}} private and public institutions for theprotection <b>of</b> <b>minors</b> are interrelated, the two regulations must complementeach other. This is beside the fact that a civil law contains administrative regulations;this is not the problem. The issue is clearly establishing the legalregime of the legal/public institutions for the protection <b>of</b> <b>minors.</b> TheGovernment's work in terms of the public protection <b>of</b> <b>minors</b> must besubject to administrative law, insofar as the Government acts as a publicauthority, i. e. by exercising the prerogatives that the regulation confers onit to satisfy public interests, such as the protection of children...|$|R
