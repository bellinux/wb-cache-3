Goals: The ain is to analyze satisfaction and loyalty with company ePojisteni. cz s. r. o. and propose measures {{that would lead to}} increased satisfaction and loyalty both of the sides - the customer on the one side and company ePojisteni. cz s. r. o. on the other. Methods: Satisfaction and loyalty were measured using the Net Promoter Score. It is a tool that allows rapid measurement of customer loyalty. Question: 'How likely is that you recommend us to your friends?" was sent to 400 respondents. This issue was further extended verbal evaluation. Some shortcomings I sought a solution with the product manager of the company. Results: The company ePojisteni. cz s. r. o. is broker of insurance for czech insurance company. The result of method Net Promoter Score is hopeful. The customers are very contented with this company and they are loyal. In second part of research the customers warm about some shortcomings. On these shortcomings I was looking for a solution with Product manager of the company.

40|$|We compare X-ray and UV spectroscopic {{observations}} of NGC 5548. Both data sets show <b>O</b> VI absorption <b>troughs</b> {{associated with the}} AGN outflow from this galaxy. We find that the robust lower limit on the column density of the <b>O</b> VI X-ray <b>trough</b> is seven {{times larger than the}} column density found in a study of the <b>O</b> VI UV <b>troughs.</b> This discrepancy suggests that column densities inferred for UV troughs of Seyfert outflows are often severely underestimated. We identify the physical limitations of the UV Gaussian modeling as the probable explanation of the O VI column density discrepancy. Specifically, Gaussian modeling cannot account for a velocity dependent covering fraction, and it is a poor representation for absorption associated with a dynamical outflow. Analysis techniques that use a single covering fraction value for each absorption component suffer from similar limitations. We conclude by suggesting ways to improve the UV analysis.

The work discusses {{the development of a}} belt conveyor system for small scale industry. The conveyor is of height 0. 75 m at 0 o angle of inclination, 35 <b>o</b> <b>troughing</b> angle and a surcharge angle of 25 o. It also consists of a belt whose width is 410 mm, length 2. 4 m and a basic length 4. 54 m. The conveyor has an average capacity of 43. 75 tonnes/hr. The evaluation of the conveyor was carried out by conveying 12 packs of bottled water of different weights across a distance of 2 m at a different speeds ranging from of 200 - 400 rpm. Results obtained indicated that the time of conveying the materials increases with increase in weight of the bottled water. The successful completion of this work provides a conveyor system which will aid the movement of material {{from one place to another}} with little or no human intervention. This will help the industry in reducing cost in acquiring labour that will be used in material movement thereby reducing cost of production...|$|R

Terrestrial grabens and {{continental}} rifts {{are compared}} with the Valles Marineris system, in order to define the mechanisms which could be responsible for its geometry and formation. Simple shear/pure shear mechanisms, symmetric/asymmetric grabens and faults, high/low dip angles, block tilting/no block tilt-ing, shouldering or not. lithospheric layering, and amount of sedimentation on chasma floors are discussed. Amounts of stretching on several transverse topographic profiles are then calculated. assuming either block tilting or no block tilting.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the applicability of}} inhomogeneous absorber models {{in the formation of}} AGN outflow absorption-troughs. The models we explore are limited to monotonic gradients of absorbing column densities in front of a finite emission source. Our main finding is that simple power-law and gaussian distributions are hard pressed to fit the Mrk 279 high-quality UV outflow data. An acceptable fit for the <b>O</b> VI <b>troughs</b> can only be obtained by assuming unrealistic optical depth values (upward of 100). The strongest constraints arise from the attempt to fit the Lyman series troughs. In this case it is evident that even allowing for complete freedom of both the power-law exponent and the optical depth as a function of velocity cannot yield an acceptable fit. In contrast, partial covering models do yield good fits for the Lyman series troughs. We conclude that monotonic inhomogeneous absorber models that do not include a sharp edge in the optical depth distribution across the source are not an adequate physical model to explain the trough formation mechanism for the outflow observed in Mrk 279.

40|$|Potassium-argon age dating of {{plutonic}} rocks has confirmed {{the existence of}} two periods of intrusion, uppermost Cretaceous (Campanian) -Paleocene (75 - 58 m. y. ago) and Eocene-earliest Oligocene (46 -$ 5 m. y. ago), in west central Puerto Rico. All of the older ages are confined to the mesozonal Utuado batholith, composed principally of tonalitc, granodiorite, and granite, which was emplaced in Cretaceous volcanogenic rocks of the central igneous subprovince. Eocene emplacement ages were obtained for small quartz diorite and tonalitc stocks, {{many of which are}} porphyritic, intruded into or immediately adjacent <b>o</b> a <b>trough</b> of lower Tertiary volcanogenic rocks that is subparallel to the southwestern margin of the Utuado batholith. Where the Eocene plutons intruded the southwestern margin of the batholith, partial or complete resetting of the ages of the batholithic rocks has occurred. Porphyry copper mineralization is associated with a number of Eocene tonalitc and quartz diorite porphyries in two areas along the southwestern margin of the Utuado batholith.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Solar based {{energy systems}} are now {{becoming}} very popular nowadays. Solar parabolic trough collectors {{are widely used}} for solar heating and solar thermal power plant. One aspect {{that is very important}} is the exact determination of drag force acting on the systems. To calculate drag force, drag coefficient, which is always associated with a particular area, is required. This drag coefficient can be determined by experimentally or by numerical simulation. This study reports on numerical predictions of drag coefficient, velocity and pressure fields in steady flow around a solar parabolic trough collector. Also the wind load acting on the collector is determined for each position of trough. In this paper drag coefficients are evaluated for different pitch angles (0 o to 180 <b>o)</b> of parabolic <b>trough</b> using the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software for wind velocity of 12 m/s. Also for 0 o pitch angle, drag coefficient is calculated varying wind velocity from 8 m/s to 18 m/s. It is found that maximum drag coefficient is 1. 71 at 0 o pitch angle and drag coefficient remains constant for wind velocity range 8 m/s to 18 m/s. The present study has established that commercially available software like can provide a reasonable good solution of complicated flow structures...|$|R
40|$|The Antarctic Peninsula {{comprises}} a thin {{spine of}} mountains and islands presently covered by an ice sheet up to 500 m thick that drains eastward and westward via outlet glaciers (Davies et al. 2012). The peninsula has undergone recent rapid warming, {{resulting in the}} collapse of fringing ice shelves and the retreat, thinning and acceleration of marine-terminating outlet glaciers (e. g. Pritchard & Vaughan 2007). At the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), the ice sheet expanded to the continental shelf break around the peninsula, and was organized into a series of ice streams that drained along cross-shelf bathymetric <b>troughs</b> (<b>Ó</b> Cofaigh et al. 2014). Marguerite Bay is located {{on the west side of}} the Antarctic Peninsula, at about 66 – 70 ° S (Fig. 1). A 12 – 80 km wide and 370 km long trough extends across the bay from the northern terminus of George VI Ice Shelf to the continental shelf edge. Extensive marine-geophysical surveys of the trough reveal a suite of glacial landforms which record past flow of an ice stream which extended to the shelf edge at, or shortly after, the LGM. Subsequent retreat of the ice stream was underway by c. 14 ka ago and proceeded rapidly to the mid-shelf, where it slowed before accelerating once again to the inner shelf at c. 9 ka (Kilfeather et al. 2011) ...|$|R
