25|$|Francia outlawed all opposition, and {{established}} a secret police force. His underground prison {{was known as the}} 'chamber of truth', and most of Paraguay's manufactures were made with prison labour. He abolished flogging, but his implementation of the death penalty was brutal, as he insisted all executions be carried out at a banquillo ("stool") under an <b>orange</b> <b>tree</b> outside his window. So as not to waste bullets, most victims were bayoneted, while their families were not allowed to collect the corpses until they had been lying there all day, {{to make sure they were}} dead.|$|E
25|$|In {{the period}} 1797–1801 Burney wrote three comedies {{that were not}} to be {{published}} in her lifetime: Love and Fashion, A Busy Day and The Woman Hater. The last is partly a reworking of subject-matter from The Witlings, but with the satirical elements toned down and more emphasis placed on reforming her characters' faults. The play, first performed in December 2007 at the <b>Orange</b> <b>Tree</b> Theatre in Richmond, UK, retains one of the central characters, Lady Smatter – an absent-minded but inveterate quoter of poetry, perhaps meant as a comic rendering of a Bluestocking. All the other characters in The Woman Hater differ from those in The Witlings.|$|E
