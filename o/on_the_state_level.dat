25|$|Religion {{was part}} of all levels of Aztec society. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>level,</b> {{religion}} was controlled by the Tlatoani and the high priests governing the main temples in the ceremonial precinct of the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan.

Throughout society, each level had their own rituals and deities and played their part in the larger rituals of the community.

The most spectacular ritual was the New Fire ceremony which took place every 52 years and involved every citizen of the Aztec realm, during this commoners would destroy house utensils, quench all fires and receive new fire from the bonfire on top of Mt. Huixachtlan, lit on the chest of a sacrificed person by the high priests.|$|E
