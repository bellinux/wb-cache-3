5|$|Pressure on {{the part}} of the optic nerve known as the chiasm, which is located above the gland, leads to loss of vision on the outer side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>visual</b> field on both sides, as this {{corresponds}} to areas on the retinas supplied by these parts of the optic nerve; it is encountered in 75% of cases. Visual acuity is reduced in half, and over 60% have a visual field defect. The visual loss depends on which part of the nerve is affected. If the part of the nerve between the eye and the chiasm is compressed, the result is vision loss in one eye. If the part after the chiasm is affected, visual loss on one side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>visual</b> field occurs.|$|E

Roland Joffé and George Miller had planned to direct it, but Joffé dropped out in 1993 and Warner Bros. fired Miller in 1995. Robert Zemeckis was eventually hired to direct, and filming for Contact lasted from September 1996 to February 1997.

5|$|Despite precautions, the {{post-production}} faced significant delays {{owing to}} the digital inter-mediation, increased work-load due to the 3-D and dubbed versions of the film, and delays in the completion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>visual</b> effects.

The delays left only two days for printing the film and sending it to theatres, generating significant anxiety over a possible delay in the release.

5|$|In Northern Europe, Greek mythology {{never took}} the same hold <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>visual</b> arts, but its effect was very obvious on literature. The English {{imagination}} was fired by Greek mythology starting with Chaucer and John Milton and continuing through Shakespeare to Robert Bridges in the 20th century. Racine in France and Goethe in Germany revived Greek drama, reworking the ancient myths. Although during the Enlightenment of the 18th century reaction against Greek myth spread throughout Europe, the myths continued to provide {{an important source of}} raw material for dramatists, including those who wrote the libretti for many of Handel's and Mozart's operas.|$|E
5|$|In terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>visual</b> dimension, {{distinction}} between aggressive mimicry and camouflage {{is not always}} clear.

However, {{it is not easy to}} assess how 'significant' a signal may be for the dupe, and the {{distinction between}} the two can thus be rather fuzzy. Mixed signals may also be employed. Aggressive mimics often have a specific part of the body sending a deceptive signal, with the rest being hidden or camouflaged.|$|E
