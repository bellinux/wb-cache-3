5|$|Acarya Ananda Jha, {{the author}} of the Chinnamasta Tattva, prescribes her worship by {{soldiers}} as she embodies self-control of lust, heroic self-sacrifice for the benefit of others, and fearlessness in the face of death. In a collective prayer to the Mahavidyas in the Shakta Maha-bhagavata Purana, the devotee prays to emulate Chhinnamasta in her generosity to others. <b>Other</b> <b>goals</b> common to worship of all Mahavidyas are: poetic speech, well-being, control of one's foes, removal of obstacles, ability to sway kings, ability to attract others, conquest over other kings, and, finally, moksha (salvation).|$|E
5|$|According to Russell's {{outlook on}} power, {{there are four}} {{conditions}} under which power ought to be pursued with moral conviction. First, it must be pursued only {{as a means to}} some end, and not as an end in itself; moreover, if it is an end in itself, then it must be of comparatively lower value than one's <b>other</b> <b>goals.</b> Second, the ultimate goal must be to help satisfy the desires of others. Third, the means by which one pursues one's goal must not be egregious or malign, such that they outweigh the value of the end; as (for instance) the gassing of children for the sake of future democracy (Russell 1938:201). Fourth, moral doctrines should aim toward truth and honesty, not the manipulation of others (Russell 1938:216–218).|$|E
5|$|Among the company's <b>other</b> <b>goals</b> {{was that}} of helping finance road {{projects}} on Øygarden. The most pressing issue was the section from Kolltveit on Store Sotra to the bridge, part of National Road 555. In 1976, the company issued NOK5 million in an interest-free loan to the project, which was repaid in 1982 and 1983. Similar conditions were imposed for NOK2 million for National Road 561 to Nordra Straumsundet and NOK1.2 million {{for the establishment of}} the Solsvik–Rong Ferry in 1974. The rest of the subsidies were given as grants. The main project was National Road 561, which ran from Kollveit northwards through Øygarden, for which the company paid NOK28.6 million. It paid a further NOK9.3 million for other projects in Sotra and Øygarden, including connections to Turøy and Misje.|$|E

5|$|The {{new regime}} {{was soon to}} {{discover}} that changes don't easily come about by legislative fiat. The part of the constitution that worked adequately was the experiment with indirect democracy. During {{the period in which}} the constitution was in force, the system of primary assemblies that elected delegates who voted for the respective organs of government worked efficiently, and kept the voters engaged. However, exactly because the Republic was a genuine democracy, <b>other</b> <b>goals</b> of the regime were less easy to attain. The elections often put people into office that were very much opposed to the unitary state that was now enshrined in the constitution, and to other innovations that it entailed, or in any case were of a conservative inclination.|$|E

5|$|Ben Arfa {{made his}} league debut {{on the opening}} day of the season in a 4–4 draw with Rennes. He scored his first goal for Les Marseillais in that match. He {{continued}} in form scoring six times in his first 11 matches. However, his reputation for controversy continued to haunt him when he was involved in another dispute, this time with the Cameroon international Modeste M'bami during a warm up session ahead of the club's UEFA Champions League match against Liverpool. The two had to be separated by Ronald Zubar. Controversy arose again following Marseille's 4–2 loss to Le Classique rivals Paris-Saint Germain. He drew the ire of manager Eric Gerets after his refusal to leave the bench to warm up. Ben Arfa later said he was injured much to the chagrin of Gerets, but later apologized for the incident to the media and Gerets himself. Upon his return to the squad, Ben Arfa responded by scoring a goal and providing the assists on both the <b>other</b> <b>goals</b> in a 3–1 victory over Saint-Étienne.|$|E
5|$|Greaves scored {{twice in}} the 1962 FA Charity Shield, as Spurs secured the trophy with a 5–1 win over Ipswich at Portman Road. In the 1962–63 season Greaves scored hat-tricks in {{victories}} over Manchester United, Ipswich Town and Liverpool, as well as four goals in a 9–2 win over Nottingham Forest. Spurs finished the league campaign in second place, six points behind champions Everton. Greaves scored 37 goals in 41 league games, finishing as the division's top scorer. In the European Cup Winners' Cup, Tottenham beat Rangers (Scotland), ŠK Slovan Bratislava (Czechoslovakia) and OFK Beograd (Yugoslavia) to reach the final, where they met Spanish club Atlético Madrid at De Kuip. In {{the first leg of}} the semi-final against Beograd in Belgrade, Greaves was sent off for violent conduct (his first and only red card) after attempting to punch centre-back Blagomir Krivokuća. Greaves served a one match ban and was able to play in the final, where he opened the scoring after an assist from Cliff Jones and later added a fourth in a 5–1 victory (John White and Terry Dyson getting the <b>other</b> <b>goals).</b> In winning the competition, Tottenham Hotspur became the first British team to win a European trophy.|$|E
5|$|Heliade {{progressively}} distanced {{himself from}} the more radical groups, especially after discussions began {{on the issue of}} land reform and the disestablishment of the boyar class. Initially, he accepted the reforms, and, after the matter was debated within Frăţia just before rebellion broke out, he issued a resolution acknowledging this (the document was probably inspired by Nicolae Bălcescu). The compromise also set <b>other</b> <b>goals,</b> including national independence, responsible government, civil rights and equality, universal taxation, a larger Assembly, five-year terms of office for Princes (and their election by the National Assembly), freedom of the press, and decentralization. On June 21, 1848, present in Islaz alongside Tell and the Orthodox priest known as Popa Şapcă, he read out these goals to a cheering crowd, in what was to be the effective start of the uprising (see Proclamation of Islaz). Four days after the Islaz events, the revolution succeeded in toppling Bibescu, whom it replaced with a Provisional Government which immediately attracted Russian hostility. Presided over by Metropolitan Neofit, it included Heliade, who was also Minister of Education, as well as Tell, Ştefan Golescu, Gheorghe Magheru, and, for a short while, the Bucharest merchant Gheorghe Scurti.|$|E

5|$|In August 2012, Bridges {{signed for}} Conference South side Chelmsford City on a free transfer. He made his debut {{for the club}} in a 3–2 home win over Bromley on 25 August.

It took Bridges seven months to open his goalscoring account for the league season, netting on the hour mark in a 6–0 home victory over Farnborough on 18 March 2013, {{a game in which}} he also assisted two <b>other</b> <b>goals.</b> It proved to be his only league goal of the campaign, in a season where Chelmsford would once again make the Conference South play-offs, but ultimately fall short. They lost 2–1 on aggregate in the semi-finals to Salisbury City, with Bridges playing in both games. He made 36 appearances in all competitions during the season, scoring two goals.|$|E
5|$|Nasri {{made his}} club debut on 28 August {{in a league}} fixture away to Tottenham Hotspur. In the match, he {{assisted}} on three goals as Manchester City cruised to a 5–1 win.

On 1 October, he scored his first goal for the club, scoring the third goal in a 4–0 victory and also assisting on two <b>other</b> <b>goals.</b> After nearly two months without a league goal, on 3 December, Nasri scored his second goal for Manchester City, converting a free-kick in a 5–1 win against Norwich City. In the following month, Nasri scored his third goal for the club in a 3–2 win against Tottenham. On 21 March 2012, he scored the game-winning goal in a 2–1 win over Chelsea after receiving a through-ball from teammate Carlos Tevez. On 22 April, he scored in a 2–0 away win against Wolverhampton Wanderers. On 13 May, Nasri won his first Premier League trophy as Manchester City were crowned Premier League champions for the 2011–12 season after defeating Queens Park Rangers 3–2.|$|E
5|$|The {{first season}} {{back in the}} top {{division}} {{proved to be a}} remarkable one for Johnson. Early in the season he scored five goals in a single match, a 6–2 win away to Everton. He continued to score frequently throughout the season, and by March 1929 he had become only the third Manchester City player to score 30 goals in a season, equalling the record previously set by Tommy Browell and Frank Roberts. He surpassed both in his next match, {{and by the end of}} the season he had scored 38 goals in 39 league appearances, a club record which still stands in 2011, 82 years later. His form during 1929 resulted in an England recall, three years after gaining his previous cap. Johnson scored twice in a 6–0 British Home Championship win against Wales. The <b>other</b> <b>goals</b> were scored by George Camsell (who scored a hat trick) and Hugh Adcock.|$|E
50|$|In January 1992 {{he joined}} Billy Ayre's Blackpool on loan. In his three {{games for the}} Seasiders he scored one goal, in a 2-2 draw with Brighton & Hove Albion at Bloomfield Road on 19 September 1992, with Trevor Sinclair scoring the hosts' <b>other</b> <b>goal.</b>|$|R

5|$|A then-record {{crowd of}} 13,500 descended on Seedhill for {{the visit of}} Darlington on 4 April, but the top two teams in the {{division}} could not be separated as the game finished in a 1–1 draw. Nelson remained second in the table going into the Easter period, during which teams played four matches {{in the space of}} five days. The first of these games ended in a 2–1 defeat away at Crewe Alexandra, despite Newnes' first goal since September. John Stevenson then scored his second Nelson goal the following day in a 1–1 draw with Bradford Park Avenue. On 13 April, the team avenged their loss to Crewe with a comprehensive 7–0 victory at Seedhill, their biggest winning margin in the Football League. Joe Eddleston opened the scoring and went on to net his third hat-trick of the season, taking his tally of goals to 25, a total that would never be beaten during Nelson's time in the League. The <b>other</b> <b>goals</b> were added by Laycock, who scored twice, Chadwick and Cameron, who netted his last goal for Nelson. However, the team then took just three out of an available ten points {{at the end of the}} season, ending their hopes of returning to the Second Division. Following a 1–1 draw at Doncaster Rovers, Nelson suffered their first and only home defeat of the season, losing 4–2 to Wrexham. On 21 September the team achieved their final win of the campaign, beating Southport 2–1 thanks to two goals from Laycock. The 1924–25 season ended with consecutive away losses at Durham City and bottom-of-the-league Rotherham County, leaving Nelson with second in the Third Division North on 53 points, ahead of third-placed New Brighton on goal average.|$|E
5|$|The A4 {{motorway}} is {{a significant}} northsouth motorway in the northern Croatia connecting the nation's capital, Zagreb, to the Hungarian M7 motorway at the Goričan border crossing The southern terminus of the A4 motorway at the interchange in Ivanja Reka represents its junction {{with the rest of}} the Croatian motorway network via the A3 motorway. As a part of the road network of Croatia, the motorway is a part of European route E65 and European route E71. The motorway is of major importance to Croatia in terms of the development of its economy, notably tourism, as it represents the shortest and the most comfortable route between Budapest, Hungary and the Adriatic Sea. This particularly applies to tourist resorts on the Istria and Kvarner Gulf islands and to the Port of Rijeka, but it is also true for resorts in the Dalmatia region, served via the A1 motorway. The genuine importance of the motorway as a transit route will be demonstrated upon completion of the proposed expansion of the Port of Rijeka and Rijeka transport node. This expansion is planned to encompass the growth of the Port of Rijeka's cargo handling capacity, improved railroad links and a new Rijeka bypass motorway linking the A6, via a new interchange, to the present routes of the A7 and A8 motorways. The project is, among <b>other</b> <b>goals,</b> aimed to increase traffic along the Croatian part of Pan-European corridor Vb, of which the A4 motorway is a part.|$|E
