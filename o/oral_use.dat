We undertook a pooled analysis of all case–control studies of melanoma in women completed as of July 1994 for which electronic data were available on <b>oral</b> contraceptive <b>use</b> along with other melanoma risk factors such as hair colour, sun sensitivity, family history of melanoma and sun exposure. Using the original data from each investigation (a total of 2391 cases and 3199 controls), we combined the study-specific odds ratios and standard errors to obtain a pooled estimate that incorporates inter-study heterogeneity. Overall, we observed no excess risk associated with <b>oral</b> contraceptive <b>use</b> for 1 year or longer compared to never use or use for less than 1 year (pooled odds ratio (pOR) = 0. 86; 95 % CI= 0. 74 – 1. 01), and {{there was no evidence of}} heterogeneity between studies.

It was the first estrogen ester to be marketed, and has since been followed by many additional esters, for instance estradiol valerate and estradiol cypionate in the 1950s. Ethinylestradiol was synthesized from estradiol by Inhoffen and Hohlweg in 1938 and was introduced for <b>oral</b> <b>use</b> by Schering in the United States under the brand name Estinyl in 1943.

25|$|General Francisco Franco — {{himself a}} Galician from Ferrol — ruled as {{dictator}} {{from the civil}} war {{until his death in}} 1975. Franco's centralizing regime suppressed any official use of the Galician language, including the use of Galician names for newborns, although its everyday <b>oral</b> <b>use</b> was not forbidden. Among the attempts at resistance were small leftist guerrilla groups such as those led by José Castro Veiga ("O Piloto") and Benigno Andrade ("Foucellas"), both of whom were ultimately captured and executed. In the 1960s, ministers such as Manuel Fraga Iribarne introduced some reforms allowing technocrats affiliated with Opus Dei to modernize administration in a way that facilitated capitalist economic development. However, for decades Galicia was largely confined to the role of a supplier of raw materials and energy to the rest of Spain, causing environmental havoc and leading to a wave of migration to Venezuela and to various parts of Europe. Fenosa, the monopolistic supplier of electricity, built hydroelectric dams, flooding many Galician river valleys.|$|E
40|$|Data {{from the}} second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES II) were {{analyzed}} to estimate the prevalence of <b>oral</b> contraceptive <b>use</b> in the United States, 1976 - 80. The overall unadjusted prevalence of <b>oral</b> contraceptive <b>use</b> was 16. 7 per cent for premenopausal females ages 12 - 54 years (19. 2 per cent for ages 15 - 44 years). Approximately 8. 7 million females (95 per cent confidence interval, 6. 9 - 10. 5 million) were oral contraceptive users at the midpoint of NHANES II (March 1978). Comparison to the NHANES I, conducted in 1971 - 74, indicated a stable number of overall oral contraceptive users in the US population during the 1970 s, with shifts in certain age groups: <b>oral</b> contraceptive <b>use</b> increased for females ages 12 - 19 years and decreased for females ages 20 - 49 years.

40|$|Summary In a case control {{study of}} 287 women aged 15 - 24 years with {{malignant}} melanoma and 574 matched controls, findings relating to <b>oral</b> contraceptive <b>use</b> and other hormone use are reported. Ever having <b>used</b> <b>oral</b> contraceptives {{was not associated with}} an increased risk of melanoma (relative risk for ever use of the pill = 1. 0). Women with melanoma were, however, more likely to have taken oral contraceptives {{for long periods of time}} in the past, the relative risk associated with <b>oral</b> contraceptive <b>use</b> for a total duration of 5 years or longer which had begun at least 10 years before the melanoma was diagnosed being 1. 5 (95 % confidence interval 1. 03 to 2. 14) This elevated risk persisted after controlling for the reported hair and skin colour, frequency of moles on the body, place of birth, and measures of sunlight and fluorescent light exposure. Cases were more likely than controls to have used hormones to regulate their periods, hormonal replacement therapy and be given hormone injections to suppress lactation, the respective relative risks being 1. 9, 1. 4 and 1. 4, but none differed significantly from 1. 0. These findings suggest that prolonged <b>oral</b> contraceptive <b>use</b> may, after a lag of 10 years or so, increase the risk of malignant melanoma. A number of recent studies have reported on the relationship between past <b>oral</b> contraceptive <b>use</b> and malignant melanoma (Beral et al., 1977; Ramcharan et al., 1981; Adam et al., 1981; Kay, 1981; Bain et al., 1982; Holly et al., 1983).

40|$|OBJECTIVES: We {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the awareness of and willingness to <b>use</b> <b>oral</b> pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention among HIV-negative partners in HIV-serodiscordant heterosexual couples in Xinjiang, China and determine factors that predict willingness to <b>use</b> <b>oral</b> PrEP. METHODS: Between November 2009 and December 2010, a cross-sectional survey was carried out among 351 HIV-negative partners in HIV-serodiscordant heterosexual couples from three cities in Xinjiang, China. Participants completed a self-administered questionnaire to assess their awareness of and willingness to <b>use</b> <b>oral</b> PrEP. Additionally, blood samples were collected to test for HIV infection. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of willingness to <b>use</b> <b>oral</b> PrEP. RESULTS: Only 10 participants (2. 8 %) reported having heard of PrEP, and only two reported ever using PrEP. However, 297 (84. 6 %) {{reported that they were}} willing to <b>use</b> <b>oral</b> PrEP if it was proven to be both safe and effective. Results of multivariate analysis revealed the following independent predictors of willingness to <b>use</b> <b>oral</b> PrEP: monthly household income (adjusted odds ratio = 2. 78, < 1000 RMB vs. ≥ 1000 RMB, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 36 - 5. 69), perceived likelihood of contracting HIV from HIV-positive partner (adjusted odds ratio = 2. 63, likely vs. unlikely, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 12 - 6. 19), and worrying about being discriminated against by others due to <b>oral</b> PrEP <b>use</b> (adjusted odds ratio = 9. 43, No vs. Yes, 95 % confidence interval: 3. 78 - 23. 50). CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed HIV-negative partners in HIV-serodiscordant heterosexual couples in China had low awareness of oral PrEP but high willingness to <b>use</b> <b>oral</b> PrEP for HIV prevention. Cost of oral PrEP should be taken into consideration in future PrEP prevention strategy. In addition, efforts should be made to reduce stigma attached to <b>oral</b> PrEP <b>use,</b> which may increase its acceptability among potential users...|$|R

40|$|There is some {{indication}} that <b>oral</b> contraceptive <b>use</b> {{may be associated with}} a small increase in risk of invasive breast cancer; however, <b>oral</b> contraceptive <b>use</b> in relation to breast carcinoma in situ (BCIS) has rarely been stu-died. We investigated <b>oral</b> contraceptive <b>use</b> in relation to risk of BCIS in a large population-based case-control study. Female residents of Wisconsin, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire aged 20 to 74 years with a new diagnosis of BCIS (n = 1, 878) were identified from state-wide tumor registries in 1997 to 2001. Age-matched female controls (n = 8, 041) were randomly selected from population lists. Information on <b>oral</b> contraceptive <b>use</b> and other risk factors was collected during structured telephone interviews. Odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confi-dence intervals (95 % CI) were estimated using logistic regression. In multivariate models, ever <b>use</b> of <b>oral</b> contraceptives was associated with a small and margin-ally significant increase in BCIS overall (OR, 1. 11; 95 % CI, 0. 99 - 1. 25) and for ductal carcinoma in situ (OR, 1. 15; 95 % CI, 1. 01 - 1. 31). No strong associations were detected according to age started, duration, time since first or last <b>use,</b> or <b>oral</b> contraceptive <b>use</b> relative to the first full-term pregnancy. The slightly increased risk of BCIS seemed limited to former users (OR, 1. 13; 95 % CI, 1. 00 - 1. 27) and women without a family history of breast cancer (OR, 1. 16; 95 % CI, 1. 01 - 1. 32 for ever versus never use).
