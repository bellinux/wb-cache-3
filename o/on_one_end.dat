5|$|Christians at {{the time}} of Constantine's {{conversion}} made up only 10% of the population. This would rise to 50% {{by the end of the}} fourth century and 90% by the end of the fifth century. Emperor Justinian I (r. 527–565) then brutally mopped up the rest of the pagans, highly literate academics <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> of the scale and illiterate peasants on the other. A conversion so rapid seems to have been rather the result of expediency than of conviction.|$|E

The chained figure is contorted in agony struggling to escape his bonds, while a daemon pulls <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> of the chain. Beside this lunatic is an unconscious or dead gambler, his winnings spread on the floor beside him.|$|E

5|$|There {{have been}} nine {{business}} routes for Interstate75 in the US state of Michigan. Numbered either Business Loop Interstate 75 (BL I-75) or Business Spur Interstate 75 (BS I-75) depending {{if they are}} a full business loop or a business spur, these highways are former routings of I-75's predecessor highways in the state. They were designated as I-75 was completed through the various areas of Michigan. The business loop in Pontiac runs through that city's downtown along a section of Woodward Avenue and a segment of roadway formerly used by M-24. The former Saginaw business loop was once a part of US Highway23 (US23), as was most of the original Bay City business loop. The roadways {{that make up the}} business loops in West Branch and Roscommon were previously part of M-76, I-75's predecessor through that part of the state. In Northern Michigan, the Grayling and Gaylord BL I-75s were part of US27, and the two business routes in St. Ignace and Sault Ste. Marie in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan were part of US2. A tenth business route, a loop through Indian River has been proposed. Each of the business loops connects to I-75 on both ends and runs through their respective cities' downtown areas. The two business spurs only connect to I-75 <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> and run into the appropriate downtown.|$|E

25|$|Adherents rely on pre-Christian, folkloric and ethnographic {{sources to}} a variety of degrees; many follow a spirituality which they accept as being entirely modern, while others attempt to {{reconstruct}} or revive indigenous, ethnic religions as found in historical and folkloric sources as accurately as possible. Academic research has placed the Pagan movement along a spectrum, with Eclecticism <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> and Polytheistic Reconstructionism on the other. Polytheism, animism and pantheism are common features in Pagan theology. Rituals take place in both public and in private domestic settings.|$|E

Tilt-and-roll luggage is pulled and thus eliminates a traveler from directly carrying his or her luggage.
