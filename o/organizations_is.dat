5|$|Scientology is {{represented}} by {{a large number of}} independent associations or Vereine in Germany; their umbrella organisation is the Scientology Kirche Deutschland e.V. Germany's domestic intelligence service, the Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz (BfV, or Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution), estimates that there are 4,000 Scientologists in Germany, down from earlier estimates of 5,000 to 6,000. The Church of Scientology reported around 30,000 members from the mid-1990s onwards; this number remained stable for many years. However more recently Scientology has said it has only 12,000 members. Discrepancies in Scientology membership numbers arise because the Church of Scientology applies more inclusive criteria in establishing its figures, essentially including anyone who has purchased a book or participated in courses, regardless of their subsequent involvement. The number of contractually bound Scientology staff members working in German Scientology <b>organizations</b> <b>is</b> unlikely to exceed a few hundred.|$|E

25|$|James Ferguson {{has argued}} that the main effect of many {{development}} projects carried out by the World Bank and similar <b>organizations</b> <b>is</b> not the alleviation of poverty.

As a result, the projects failed to help the poor, but succeeded in expanding the government bureaucracy.|$|E
