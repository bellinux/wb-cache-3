The case went to a second trial, which ended within days in a mistrial. A third trial on the charge of murdering her husband ended in a hung jury in July 1964. Kinne was released on bond following the third trial and subsequently traveled to Mexico before a scheduled fourth trial could be held in October 1964.|$|E

Using practical suit pieces built by Legacy Effects, ILM mixed live-action shots with digital take-overs and fully digital shots to create the sequence.

5|$|The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment {{applies only}} against the states, {{but it is}} {{otherwise}} textually identical to the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which applies against the federal government; both clauses have been interpreted to encompass identical doctrines <b>of</b> <b>procedural</b> due process and substantive due process. Procedural due process is the guarantee of a fair legal process when the government tries to interfere with a person's protected interests in life, liberty, or property, and substantive due process is the guarantee that the fundamental rights of citizens will not be encroached on by government. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment also incorporates most of the provisions in the Bill of Rights, which were originally applied against only the federal government, and applies them against the states.|$|E

5|$|In the Malaysian case Tan Tek Seng v. Suruhanjaya Perkhidmatan Pendidikan (1996), the {{appellant}} had appealed {{against his}} wrongful dismissal from employment {{on the grounds}} <b>of</b> <b>procedural</b> unfairness. One of the issues brought up was whether an unfair procedure meant {{that he had been}} deprived of his constitutional right to life or liberty protected by Article 5(1) of the Malaysian Constitution, which is identical to Singapore's Article 9(1). Judge of the Court of Appeal Gopal Sri Ram held that the courts should take into consideration the unique characteristics and situation of the country, and must not be blind to the realities of life. He went on to suggest that a liberal approach be adopted to grasp the intention of the framers of the Constitution by giving life a broad and liberal meaning. He opined that such an interpretation would include elements that form the quality of life, namely the right to seek and be engaged in lawful and gainful employment, and the right to live in a reasonably healthy and pollution-free environment. He also noted that life cannot be extinguished or taken away except according to procedure established by law.|$|E

5|$|On 28 May 2009, Yuri Savenko {{wrote to}} the then President of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev an open letter, in which Savenko asked Medvedev {{to submit to the}} State Duma a draft law {{prepared}} by the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia to address the sharp drop in the level of forensic psychiatric examinations, which Savenko attributed to the lack of competition within the sector and its increasing nationalization. The open letter says that the level of the expert reports has dropped {{to such an extent that}} it is often a matter of not only the absence of entire sections of the report, even such as the substantiation of its findings, and not only the gross contradiction of its findings to the descriptive section of the report, but it is often a matter of concrete statements which are so contrary to generally accepted scientific terms that doubts about the disinterestedness of the experts arise. According to the letter, courts, in violation <b>of</b> <b>procedural</b> rules, do not analyze the expert report, its coherence and consistency in all its parts, do not check experts' findings for their accuracy, completeness, and objectivity.|$|E

Applying the principles in the GCHQ case, the High Court of Justice in Northern Ireland held that the Police Association had neither been deprived of a legitimate expectation nor treated unfairly. The Court of Appeal of England and Wales also protected procedural interests by stating that a public authority cannot, without some form of warning, change a long-standing practice that it is aware an individual has acted in the light of and derived a benefit from, in the case of R. v.

25|$|A {{procedural}} {{legitimate expectation}} is created when a representation {{is made by}} a public authority that it will follow a certain procedure before making a decision on the substantive merits of a particular case.

A substantive legitimate expectation is formed where a representation is made by an authority as to the final decision and outcome that the authority will make in a particular case.|$|E
25|$|The patient being {{examined}} or treated is usually awake during catheterization, ideally with only local anaesthesia such as lidocaine and minimal general sedation, throughout the procedure.

40|$|This {{research}} examines procedural modeling in the eld <b>of</b> computer graphics. <b>Procedural</b> modeling automates {{the generation}} of objects by representing models as procedures that provide {{a description of the}} process required to create the model. The problem we solve with this research is the creation <b>of</b> a <b>procedural</b> modeling environment that consists <b>of</b> a <b>procedural</b> modeling language and a set of non-interactive modeling tools. A goal of this research is to provide comparisons between 3 D manual modeling and procedural modeling, which focus on the modeling strategies, tools and model representations used by each modeling paradigm. A procedural modeling language is presented that has the same facilities and features <b>of</b> existing <b>procedural</b> modeling languages. In addition, features such as caching and a pseudorandom number generator is included, demonstrating the advantages <b>of</b> a <b>procedural</b> modeling paradigm. The non-interactive tools created within the procedural modeling framework are selection, extrusion, subdivision, curve shaping and stitching. In order to demonstrate the usefulness <b>of</b> the <b>procedural</b> modeling framework, human and furniture models are created using this procedural modeling environment. Various techniques are presented to generate these objects, and may be used to create a variety of other models. A detailed discussion of each technique is provided. Six experiments are conducted to test the support <b>of</b> the <b>procedural</b> modeling benets provided by this non- interactive modeling environment. The experiments test, namely parameterisation, re-usability, base-shape independence, model complexity, {{the generation of}} reproducible random numbers and caching. We prove that a number of distinct models can be generated from a single procedure through the use parameterisation. Modeling procedures and sub-procedures are re-usable and can be applied to different models. Procedures can be base-shape independent. The level of complexity of a model can be increased by repeatedly applying geometry to the model. The pseudo-random number generator is capable of generating reproducible random numbers. The caching facility reduces the time required to generate a model that uses repetitive geometry...|$|R
