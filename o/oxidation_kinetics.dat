40|$|ABSTRACT Fat {{oxidation}} kinetics: {{effect of}} exercise. During graded exercise, absolute whole body fat oxidation rates increase from low to moderate intensities, and then markedly decline at high intensities, implying an exercise intensity (Fatmax) {{at which the}} fat oxidation rate is maximal (MFO). The main aim of the present work {{was to examine the}} effect of exercise on whole body fat <b>oxidation</b> <b>kinetics.</b> For this purpose, a sinusoidal mathematical model (SIN) has been developped in the first study to provide an accurate description of the shape of fat <b>oxidation</b> <b>kinetics</b> during graded exercise, represented as a function of exercise intensity, and to determine Fatmax and MFO. The SIN model incorporates three independent variables (i. e., dilatation, symmetry, and translation) that correspond to main expected modulations of the basic fat oxidation curve because of factors such as mode of exercise or training status. The results of study 1 showed that the SIN model was a valuable tool to determine Fatmax and MFO, and to precisely characterize and quantify the different shape of fat <b>oxidation</b> <b>kinetics</b> through its three variables. The effectiveness of the SIN model to detect differences in fat <b>oxidation</b> <b>kinetics</b> induced by a specific factor was then confirmed in the second study, which quantitatively described and compared fat <b>oxidation</b> <b>kinetics</b> in two different popular modes of exercise: running and cycling. It was found that the mean fat <b>oxidation</b> <b>kinetics</b> during running was characterized by a greater dilatation and a rightward asymmetry compared with the symmetric parabolic curve in cycling. In the two subsequent studies, the effect of a prior endurance exercise of different intensities and durations on whole body fat <b>oxidation</b> <b>kinetics</b> was examined. Study 3 determined the impact of a 1 -h continuous exercise bout at an exercise intensity corresponding to Fatmax on fat <b>oxidation</b> <b>kinetics</b> during a subsequent graded test, while study 4 investigated the effect of an exercise leading to a more pronounced muscle glycogen depletion. The results of these two latter studies showed that fat oxidation rates, MFO, and Fatmax were enhanced following endurance exercise, but were increased to a greater extent with a more severe mucle glycogen depletion, inducing therefore modifications in the postexercise fat <b>oxidation</b> <b>kinetics</b> (i. e., greater dilatation and rightward asymmetry). In perspective, further studies have been suggested 1) to assess physiological meaning of the three independent variables of the SIN model; and 2) to compare the effect of two different training programs on fat <b>oxidation</b> <b>kinetics</b> in obese subjects...|$|E

Furthermore, the results were compared with reported <b>oxidation</b> <b>kinetics</b> of raw sludge treated under identical experimental conditions. In the assessment, oxidation was considered to proceed in two steps: (1) decomposition of the particulate, or non-filterable, chemical oxygen demand (PCOD); followed by (2) ultimate oxidation and removal of the total, particulate and soluble, COD. The accumulation and removal of soluble COD (SCOD) was determined from the difference between the rates of sludge decomposition and ultimate oxidation. Using results from batch and continuous-flow hydrothermal treatment experiments, the reacting organic ingredients were separated into groups according to the ease or difficulty at which they were decomposed or removed, with Arrhenius-type activation energy levels assigned to the different groups. The analysis confirmed that within the treatment range of 75 % to more than 97 % COD removal, the <b>oxidation</b> <b>kinetics</b> of the digested and raw sludges were nearly identical despite differences in the proportions of their original organic ingredients.
