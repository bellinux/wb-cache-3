About 1889, his family moved to Springville (now South Portsmouth) in Greenup County, Kentucky. There, he attended the public schools, and took a teacher-training course at a local private school.

5|$|Although not rivalling the LSO's {{total of}} more than 200 film score recordings, the LPO has played for a number of soundtracks, {{starting}} in 1936 with Whom the Gods Love. The orchestra played for ten films made during the Second World War, and then did little soundtrack work until the 1970s, with the major exception <b>of</b> <b>Lawrence</b> of Arabia (1962). Later scores have included those for Antony and Cleopatra (1972), Jesus Christ Superstar (1973), The Fly (1986), Dead Ringers (1988), In the Name of the Father (1993), the Lord of the Rings trilogy (2001–03) and most of the music for the three films derived from The Hobbit (2012–14).|$|E
5|$|Francium coprecipitates {{with several}} caesium salts, such as caesium perchlorate, {{which results in}} small amounts of {{francium}} perchlorate. This coprecipitation {{can be used to}} isolate francium, by adapting the radiocaesium coprecipitation method <b>of</b> <b>Lawrence</b> E. Glendenin and Nelson. It will additionally coprecipitate with many other caesium salts, including the iodate, the picrate, the tartrate (also rubidium tartrate), the chloroplatinate, and the silicotungstate. It also coprecipitates with silicotungstic acid, and with perchloric acid, without another alkali metal as a carrier, which provides other methods of separation. Nearly all francium salts are water-soluble.|$|E

Williamson (1930–37). On October 29, 1961, {{in celebration of}} the church's 175th anniversary, the {{congregation}} dedicated a new brick community and religious-education building designed to be architecturally compatible with the 1849 brick church. The new building, which hosted community gatherings, events and Sunday school, was built {{just south of the}} brick church {{at the edge of the}} cemetery (where the old log church was originally located). Walter A. Sigman (1960–65) was pastor when the community building was dedicated.|$|E
5|$|Minneapolis's Oak Street Cinema, a volunteer-run {{repertory}} cinema, ran films {{seven days}} per week until cutbacks in programming {{had to be made}} for financial reasons. A collective of the Oak Street volunteers formed Take-Up Productions, which was established to promote showing films not typically screened in larger movie houses. The organization began with outdoor screenings, starting with Watermelon Man, which was projected against a white brick wall behind a coffee shop, and then began to rent out theaters throughout the Minneapolis–Saint Paul area, including the Riverview, Heights, and Parkway. Some screenings, such as that <b>of</b> <b>Lawrence</b> of Arabia and a series of Alfred Hitchcock films, drew hundreds of viewers.|$|E
5|$|On 7January 1830 Etty's mentor Thomas Lawrence died, {{followed}} on 30July by Etty's mother.

Possibly distracted by the death <b>of</b> <b>Lawrence,</b> Etty only submitted three paintings to the Summer Exhibition that year. One of these, Judith Going Forth, was an addition to Judith, which had been commissioned the previous year by that painting's new owners, the Royal Scottish Academy.|$|E

5|$|The Mongols {{comprehensively}} plundered {{the eastern}} territories of the Kingdom of Hungary, including Transylvania, during both their invasion in 1241 and their withdrawal the following year. The {{consolidation of the}} province was the main task <b>of</b> <b>Lawrence</b> of the Aba clan, who was appointed by Béla IV and held the office for 10 years from 1242. One of his successors, also appointed by Béla IV, banus Ernye of the Ákos clan, was dismissed in 1260 by the king's son, Stephen who had just taken over Transylvania with the title of duke. The duke's action showed emerging tensions between father and son, rather than conflicts between the duke and the banus.|$|E
5|$|H.D. married Aldington in 1913; however, {{their first}} and only child, a daughter, was {{stillborn}} in 1915. Aldington enlisted in the army. The couple became estranged, and Aldington reportedly took a mistress in 1917. H.D. became involved in a close but platonic relationship with D. H. Lawrence. In 1916, her first book, Sea Garden, was published, and she was appointed assistant editor of The Egoist, replacing her husband. In 1918, her brother Gilbert was killed in action, and that March she moved into a cottage in Cornwall with the composer Cecil Gray, a friend <b>of</b> <b>Lawrence.</b> She became pregnant with Gray's child; however, {{by the time she}} realised she was expecting, the relationship had cooled and Gray had returned to live in London. When Aldington returned from active service he was noticeably traumatised, and he and H.D. later separated.|$|E
5|$|In Saw, Jigsaw {{has just}} {{concluded}} the bathroom trap <b>of</b> <b>Lawrence</b> Gordon and Adam Stanheight, {{an incident that}} occurred {{at the end of}} the first film. David Tapp, a police officer who had his throat damaged by Jigsaw's knife and was later shot in the chest by a suspect named Zep Hindle, has been healed and is brought to Whitehurst insane asylum, an abandoned sanitarium with a reputation for medieval tactics and frequent patient abuse. The asylum has many areas, most of which contain a key trap scene for Tapp to solve. A large part of the asylum consists of cells that were at one time used to hold the criminally insane. Jigsaw placed traps all around the asylum to continue his tests of will for Detective Tapp and his apprentice, Amanda Young, who monitors Tapp as the story progresses.|$|E

5|$|In the era before league football, the {{position}} of manager involved many secretarial duties, such as arranging fixtures and the upkeep of the club's ground. Few accounts of the club's off-field affairs in the 1880s survive, and it is unclear who managed the club (then known as West Gorton (St. Marks)) between 1882 and 1884. The club's earliest managers were also players; the first three known managers (Frederick Hopkinson, Edward Kitchen and Walter Chew) all played in West Gorton's first recorded match in 1880. By 1889 the club had moved to Hyde Road and renamed itself Ardwick A.F.C. Under the management <b>of</b> <b>Lawrence</b> Furniss, the club joined the Football League in 1892 as founder members of the Second Division. Furniss became chairman a year later, {{and he and his}} successor as secretary-manager Joshua Parlby were responsible for Ardwick reforming as Manchester City F.C. in 1894.|$|E

About quarter of the way between Nicholville and Lavery's Corner, the fields gave way to forested areas, which themselves ceded to more fields near an intersection with Cady Road. NY195 continued on to Lavery's Corner, where it intersected with a pair of county highways and turned east toward Lawrenceville. On its way to Lawrenceville, the highway met Ferris Road, the last through route along NY195's routing excluding the roadway at its northern terminus. East of Ferris Road, NY195 curved northeast to enter Lawrenceville, where it ended at US11.|$|E
5|$|Teller {{emigrated to}} the United States in the 1930s, and was an early member of the Manhattan Project, charged with {{developing}} the first atomic bomb. During this time he made a serious push to develop the first fusion-based weapons as well, but these were deferred until after World War II. After his controversial testimony in the security clearance hearing of his former Los Alamos Laboratory superior J. Robert Oppenheimer, Teller was ostracized by much of the scientific community. He continued to find support from the U.S. government and military research establishment, particularly for his advocacy for nuclear energy development, a strong nuclear arsenal, and a vigorous nuclear testing program. He was a co-founder <b>of</b> <b>Lawrence</b> Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), and was both its director and associate director for many years.|$|E
