40|$|<b>On</b> <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> <b>afternoon</b> {{visit to}} a local public library, I {{happened}} to pass by the very inviting wing where children’s and young adult books were housed. Prominently displayed {{near the entrance to}} this part of the library was a large, multi-colored poster that announced the literary challenge ‘Read To Win! ’ Directly beneath these twelve- inch-high words were the details outlining what constituted children’s reading success. Youngsters who read ten books during the summer months were honored with a certificate of accomplishment from a local pizza chain and a coupon for one free Pizza Supreme. Those who read twenty books were awarded a similar certificate and three free Supreme pizzas). Finally, those youngsters who read more than thirty books were awarded the certificate, still more Supremes, and a cap emblazoned with the words ‘Champion Reader. ’ This kind of poster, I suspect, might be readily found in any library anywhere these days, and so its familiarity should not have been at all surprising. As it was, however, this announcement took {{on a life of its}} own in my mind, and I found myself feeling slightly disconcerted by what I’d just encountered. I could not help but wonder about this representation of reading’s purpose and power, and about some of the ways this purpose and power is communicated to children and adults alike. How, I more specificall...|$|E
40|$|Mona Simpson writes novels. Her 1987 debut, Anywhere But Here, follows Adele and Ann August, {{a mother}} and {{daughter}} who move from the Midwest to Los Angeles {{in search of a}} less ordinary life. The novel went <b>on</b> to be <b>a</b> national bestseller, winning the Whiting Award in 1986, catapulting the author into the literary spotlight. Simpson followed her first novel’s success with a sequel: The Lost Father, published in 1992. Four years later, Simpson returned with A Regular Guy (1996). That same year Granta named Simpson one of America’s Best Young Novelists. In 2000, Simpson published Off Keck Road, a novel about a small town spinster, a man who has always been in her life, and a young girl, who completes the odd triangle. This work was a finalist for the PEN/Faulkner Award. Her upcoming novel, My Hollywood (Knopf, Spring 2010), depicts the upstairs/downstairs ironies, enmities, and strange affections between a community of immigrant nannies and their employers in contemporary Los Angeles. Presently, Simpson has begun a story about the lives and loves of Diaspora Arabs in Europe, the Gulf, and the United States, and of their more assimilated, half-American cousins. Simpson is also a Professor in the Department of English and plays an active part in organizing the Friends of English and Hammer Museum’s popular “Some Favorite Writers” series. <b>On</b> <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> summer <b>afternoon,</b> I sat down in a Brentwood coffee shop with Simpson to talk about her work and, in particular, The American Cousins...|$|R
40|$|The massive museum, {{a modern}} {{structure}} of grey bricks and white-painted cement, stands a little abruptly, halfway up Xiayun Mountain, in Fangshang County, in western skirts of Beijing. It is the ‘Without the Communist Party, There Would Be No New China Museum’, dedicated entirely to this revolutionary song. <b>On</b> <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> sunny <b>afternoon,</b> when <b>a</b> friend and I descended – or should I say ascended as the mountain, at 2161 meter above sea level, {{is known as}} ‘the roof of Beijing’ – we found ourselves the only visitors. The spacious car park was empty. Yiaotangshang, a quiet mountain village, isn’t on any tourist map. Now it is poised {{to go down in}} history as the birthplace of the most famous revolutionary song in China. The museum complex felt like a mini-‘Red Base’. By the foot of the mountain, three national flags flapped in the chill wind. In the main hall, staves of the song’s music, in gold, glared <b>on</b> <b>a</b> red wall, behind a golden hammer and sickle. As someone who grew up in China and knows the lyrics by heart, I couldn’t help but start to sing aloud, to the amusement of the museum staff. In the revolutionary spirit and against the market economy trend, entrance is free. The museum is made up of three separate parts. Here photos, documents, statues and wax figures enlighten visitors of the song’s history, its composer Cao Huoxing, and the glorious history of Chinese Communist Party. It also houses a 400 square meter stage. To liven things up, there’s even an animated slide show, recounting the story of how Cao composed the song. In October 1943, Cao, a young member of the ‘Iron Blood’ propaganda troupe, was traveling through the village. The troupe had been staging performances in the countryside, to mobilize the masses to join in the revolution and fight against the invading Japanese. In responding to the Nationalists’ claim that “without the Nationalists, there would be no China,” Cao penned and composed the song at a temple in the village where he was staying...|$|R
