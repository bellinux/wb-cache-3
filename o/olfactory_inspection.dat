50|$|Previous {{work has}} shown that a 'worst-case {{exposure}} scenario' can be limited to {{a specific set of}} conditions. Based on the advanced detection methods and pipeline shut-off SOP developed by TransCanada, the risk of a substantive or large release over {{a short period of time}} contaminating groundwater with benzene is unlikely. Detection, shutoff, and remediation procedures would limit the dissolution and transport of benzene. Therefore, the exposure of benzene would be limited to leaks that are below the limit of detection and go unnoticed for extended periods of time. Leak detection is monitored through a SCADA system that assesses pressure and volume flow every 5 seconds. A pinhole leak that releases small quantities that cannot be detected by the SCADA system (<1.5% flow) could accumulate into a substantive spill. Detection of pinhole leaks would come from a visual or <b>olfactory</b> <b>inspection,</b> aerial surveying, or mass-balance inconsistencies. It is assumed that pinhole leaks are discovered within the 14-day inspection interval, however snow cover and location (e.g. remote, deep) could delay detection. Benzene typically makes up 0.1 - 1.0% of oil and will have varying degrees of volatility and dissolution based on environmental factors.|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn primate species, mating {{decisions}} seem to {{be based}} on multiple signal elements with different roles in the signaling of female reproductive status. Whereas some primate signals are relatively well described (e. g., sexual swellings and copulation calls), studies that simultaneously assess visual, auditory, behavioral, and olfactory cues as signals of reproductive state are rarely undertaken. We used data on variation in sexual behaviors and sexual swellings in relation to the fertile period (estimated from the date of swelling detumescence) from a troop of semi-free ranging olive baboons (Papio anubis) to assess how different signals influence patterns of mate choice. Using an objective and quantitative measure of swelling size and color, along with detailed data on sexual behaviors from 13 cycles of nine adult females, we found that fine-scale variation in sexual swelling size, female behavior and copulation call rates could advertise the beginning of the fertile phase whereas swelling color did not. Rates of <b>olfactory</b> <b>inspections</b> by males also increased during the fertile phase, suggesting that olfactory signals were of interest to males and may contain information about ovulation. There was no relationship between female characteristics (age and rank) and the expression of sexual signals, except for proceptive behaviors which increased with female rank. Males displayed more sexual behaviors such as approaches and holding and tended to direct more ejaculatory mounts during the fertile phase. All together, we suggest that whereas all males could have information concerning the timing of ovulation through female proceptive behaviors and swelling size, consorting males may have access to additional signals (olfactory cues). Sexual communication in olive baboons is consistent with a multimodal framework for fertility signaling, potentially allowing males and females to establish different mating strategies. The possible selective pressures leading to multi-modal signaling are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{quantified}} sexual, {{aggressive and}} associated behaviours in captive owl monkeys {{and examined the}} importance of olfactory cues in mediating these behaviours. Animals {{of the same sex}} showed high frequencies of aggressive behaviour but no sexual behaviour. Subordinate animals tended to exhibit lower levels of scent-marking, although individual variability in this behaviour was pronounced. Evidence was obtained which suggested that arching displays (which occur in several Platyrrhine species) primarily subserve an aggressive function. The effects of partial anosmia upon intermale aggression were investigated. Anosmia was induced by placing plugs containing bismuth-iodoform paste, as near as possible to the cribriform plate. Males fought less readily and showed less contact aggression when anosmlc. However, intermale aggression was not abolished and presumably other sensory cues are also involved. Anosmia also had subtle effects on other behaviours, eg, <b>olfactory</b> <b>inspections</b> and proximity. Control experiments indicated that the technique employed produced anosmia to conspecific odours and that its effects were not due simply to discomfort. The effects of partial anosmia upon sexual behaviour of males paired with familiar females were examined. No consistent effects on sexual behaviour were observed. However, the suggestion that ol factory cues {{may play a role in}} sexual attractiveness is not discounted. The ability of owl monkeys living in family groups to discriminate various odour cues was determined. Breeding males showed the greatest response, in terms of sniffing and scent-marking, to conspecific odours, and subcaudal secretion plus urine elicited a greater response than urine alone. It was impossible to demonstrate discrimination of sex or endoctrine status on the basis of odour cues alone. The effect of social factors on responsiveness is discussed. Histological studies confirmed that patent nasopalatine ducts and vomeronasal organ were present in Aotus and some other primate species. External and histological examinations of the cutaneous glandular complexes in Aotus revealed no sexual dimorphism in these glands, though subspecific differences may exist. <p...|$|R
