5|$|During the Long March Zhu and Zhou Enlai {{organized}} certain {{battles in}} tandem. There were few positive effects since {{the real power}} was in the hands <b>of</b> <b>Bo</b> Gu and Otto Braun. In the Zunyi Conference, Zhu supported Mao Zedong’s criticisms <b>of</b> <b>Bo</b> and Braun. After the conference, Zhu cooperated with Mao and Zhou on military affairs. In July 1935 Zhu and Liu Bocheng were with the Fourth Red Army while Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai with the First Red Army. When separation between the two divisions occurred, Zhu was forced by Zhang Guotao, the leader of Fourth Red Army, to go south. The Fourth Red Army barely survived the retreat through Sichuan Province. Arriving in Yan'an, Zhu directed {{the reconstruction of the}} Red Army under the political guidance of Mao.|$|E

On October 16, 2014, the Rangers named Banister their new manager. He signed a three-year contract with an option for a fourth season. Jon Daniels, the Rangers' general manager, indicated that Banister will help the Rangers to incorporate analytics into their baseball decisions.|$|E
5|$|Bo was {{considered}} a likely candidate for promotion to the elite Politburo Standing Committee in 18th Party Congress in 2012.

5|$|Bo's chief ideological rival, former Guangdong party chief Wang Yang, went on {{to become}} Vice-Premier holding the {{portfolios}} of agriculture, commerce, and poverty reduction. Wen Jiabao, who was seen as Bo's foremost critic in the top leadership, suffered significant public embarrassment himself over a New York Times article about his family's vast empire of wealth whose release coincided closely with Bo's dismissal. Huang Qifan, the mayor of Chongqing long seen as an ally <b>of</b> <b>Bo,</b> continued his political career basically unscathed. Wang Lijun was sentenced to fifteen years in prison for defection, corruption, and abuse of power.|$|E

5|$|According The New York Times, the {{eavesdropping}} operations did {{not only}} target local criminals, {{but also the}} communications of top Chinese leaders, {{including those of the}} General Secretary, President Hu Jintao. One source connected to the Chinese leadership said that Bo tried to monitor nearly all central leaders who had visited Chongqing in order to better understand what they thought of him. In August 2011, a phone call between Hu Jintao and anti-corruption official Ma Wen was found to be wiretapped under Bo's orders. The revelations about the eavesdropping operation resulted in intense scrutiny from the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection. It was also said to have sowed distrust and {{played a role in the}} falling out <b>of</b> <b>Bo</b> and his police chief Wang Lijun, who allegedly began to use the same eavesdropping methods against Bo himself. The operations were believed to have contributed to Bo's downfall in 2012.|$|E

5|$|However, Bo's {{campaign}} {{was criticized for}} running roughshod over judicial due process and eroding the rule of law. Individuals targeted in the campaign were arbitrarily detained by the authorities, with an estimated 1,000 being sent to forced labor. Lawyers for the accused were intimidated and harassed, and {{in at least one}} case, sentenced to 18 months in prison. Allegations also surfaced over the use of torture to extract confessions. Moreover, assets seized during the campaign were allegedly redirected to help pay for Bo's popular social housing programs. The Wall Street Journal reported that $11 billion went into government coffers through the campaign. Li Jun, a fugitive businessman, asserted that he became a target <b>of</b> <b>Bo</b> anti-corruption drive {{as a result of a}} land dispute with the government. When he refused government demands to give up the land, he claims that he was abducted and tortured, and that $700 million worth of assets in his business were seized.|$|E
5|$|After {{defeating}} Dong Zhuo, Liu Bei and his sworn brothers Zhang Fei and Guan Yu {{are forced}} to wander the land {{in search of a}} home. Since the people love Liu Bei, Cao Cao sets out to destroy him. In 200 AD, Guan Yu returns to Liu Bei after an escape ("Tales"), making it through many gates to ships on the river. At Ru Nan ("Tales"), Liu Bei is rejoined by Guan Yu and is now followed by Zhao Yun, who saves him from advancing infantry. Cao Cao is defeated, but Liu Bei must continue wandering. In 208 AD, Liu Bei finds talent in a strategist known as Zhuge Liang, who agreed to follow him after Liu Bei visited him three times. Zhuge Liang proves his worth by defeating Cao Cao's army in a series of ambushes at the Battle <b>of</b> <b>Bo</b> Wan Po and Liu Bei successfully manages to flee to Sun Jian in Wu after the Battle of Changban, where Zhao Yun saved his son. Sun Jian agrees to assist Liu Bei in his goal of defeating Cao Cao, and Wu strategist Zhou Yu teams up with Zhuge Liang to execute a fire attack that destroyed Cao Cao's fleet at the Battle of Chi Bi.|$|E

40|$|Results {{from the}} Germplasm Evaluation Program (GPE) at the Roman L. Hruska U. S. Meat Animal Research Center (U. S.

Production <b>of</b> <b>Bos</b> indicus F 1 cross cows (Brahman and Sahiwal sired crosses out of Hereford and Angus dams) was equalled only by F 1 cross cows sired by large size dual purpose breeds (Brown Swiss, Gelbvleh, Simmental, Holstein and Maine Anjou crosses out of Hereford and Angus dams) excelling in milk production and genetic potential for growth. Indications are that the advantages <b>of</b> <b>Bos</b> indicus crosses are associated with greater heterosis found in Bos indicus x Bos taurus crosses than is found in crosses <b>of</b> two <b>Bos</b> taurus breeds. In the GPE program, F 1 cross cows by diverse sire breeds were compared when they were raising terminal three-breed cross calves by bulls <b>of</b> an unrelated <b>Bos</b> taurus breed (e. g., Simmental or Brown Swiss). Thus, progeny <b>of</b> <b>Bos</b> indicus sired F 1 cross cows were 25 % Bos indicus and 75 % Bos taurus compared to progeny <b>of</b> 100 % <b>Bos</b> taurus inheritance for all other F 1 cross cows.

25|$|During the Communists' {{subsequent}} Long March, {{there were}} numerous high-level disputes over the direction that the Communists should take, and on {{the causes of the}} Red Army's defeats. During the power struggles that ensued, Zhou consistently backed Mao Zedong against the interests <b>of</b> <b>Bo</b> Gu and Otto Braun. Bo and Braun were later blamed for the Red Army's defeats, and were eventually removed from their positions of leadership. The Communists eventually succeeded in re-establishing a base in northern Shaanxi on 20 October 1935, arriving with only 8,000–9,000 remaining members.|$|E
25|$|Although Zhou's {{subsequently}} cautious military {{approach was}} distrusted by hardliners, he was again {{appointed to the}} position of vice chairman of the Military Commission.

25|$|While {{the return}} <b>of</b> <b>Bo</b> and Luke was welcomed by ardent and casual viewers alike, {{and as a}} result ratings {{recovered}} slightly, the show never completely regained its former popularity. One of Wopat and Schneider's disputes even before they left was what they considered to be increasingly weak and formulaic scripts and episode plots. With Wopat and Schneider's return, the producers agreed to try a wider scope of storylines. However, although it continued for two more seasons, the show never fully returned to its former glory. As well as what was widely recognized to be increasingly inferior scripts, many cast members decried the miniature car effects newly incorporated to depict increasingly absurd General Lee and patrol car stunts (which had previously been performed with real cars by stunt drivers). The miniature car effects were intended as a budget saving measure (to save the cost of repairing or replacing damaged vehicles) and to help compete visually with KITT from the NBC series Knight Rider. In February 1985, The Dukes of Hazzard ended its run after seven seasons.|$|E

40|$|It {{is shown}} that {{comparison}} {{of the size of}} the Y chromosome between individuals may be made as reliably by computation of measurement relative to the X chromosome as by proportionation relative to the genome in the cell. By either method agreement was found with previous studies: first in placing the Y in the size range, for the cattle karyotype, between autosomes 22 and 26; second by finding the Y in the Charolais breed to be larger than other breeds. The value of the C-band method for recognition of the Y in Bos indicus, in particular, is reaffirmed and acridine orange is used to confirm the hypothesis of pericentric inversion as the basis of the relationship between the Y <b>of</b> <b>Bos</b> indicus and that <b>of</b> <b>Bos</b> taurus.
