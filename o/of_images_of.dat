5|$|In 1980, the Solar Maximum Mission was {{launched}} by NASA. This spacecraft {{was designed to}} observe gamma rays, X-rays and UV radiation from solar flares {{during a time of}} high solar activity and solar luminosity. Just a few months after launch, however, an electronics failure caused the probe to go into standby mode, and it spent the next three years in this inactive state. In 1984 Space Shuttle Challenger mission STS-41C retrieved the satellite and repaired its electronics before re-releasing it into orbit. The Solar Maximum Mission subsequently acquired thousands <b>of</b> <b>images</b> <b>of</b> the solar corona before re-entering Earth's atmosphere in June 1989.|$|E

5|$|In {{line with}} Müller's advice, Jovanović avoided {{creating}} a sentimental work and focused instead on depicting characters and situations he observed {{during his time}} in the Balkans. This differentiates the painting from other Orientalist paintings of the day, which were based on travel accounts rather than first-hand experience. The art historian Lilien Filipovitch-Robinson notes that the grouping of the figures and their interactions with one another are reminiscent <b>of</b> <b>images</b> <b>of</b> the lamentation over the body of Christ. The right half of the scene recedes into shadow while the brightly illuminated left, where the principal figures are located, appears to expand towards the viewer. Jovanović thus directs the viewer's eye from left to right, foreground to background, through the circular pattern of the groupings as well as the diagonal lines of the peasants' swords. In line with Müller's teachings regarding light and colour, Jovanović adds touches of bright red to give warmth and movement to the scene, making it appear as though it is unfolding before the viewer. The brushwork is varied, ranging from the smooth broad strokes that define the solidity of the walls to quick short ones that make it appear like the figures are in motion.|$|E

5|$|The 2006 {{video game}} , {{developed}} by Insomniac Games, published by Sony Computer Entertainment and released for the PlayStation 3 video game console, features combat scenes {{that take place}} within a virtual representation of Manchester Cathedral in England set in an alternate history. It was released on 23 March 2007 in the United Kingdom. The use <b>of</b> <b>images</b> <b>of</b> the cathedral caused controversy {{with the leaders of}} the Church of England, which claimed its depiction to be desecration and copyright infringement, and that it was inappropriate of Sony to allow players to fire guns in a city with a gun problem. They have made several legal threats against Sony. They intended to make several demands of Sony, including an apology, a substantial donation, complete withdrawal of the game or modifying the segment featuring the interior of the cathedral, and financial support of Manchester groups trying to reduce gun crime in the city.|$|E
5|$|At {{a meeting}} with church and cathedral officials, held on 11 June, reporters noted that three people had been shot within {{the city in the}} {{previous}} 72 hours. The attendees produced a letter by the Very Reverend Rogers Govender, on behalf of the Dean and Canons of Manchester Cathedral to Sony. It stated that they were currently seeking the advice of lawyers in the matter, and reserved their legal position in relation to the same. It demanded a substantial donation for the cathedral's work with youth in resisting the culture of gun crime and other forms of violence in our society. It further demanded the immediate withdrawal of the game, and that Sony not re-issue it without removing the section of the game containing the Cathedral interior. Govender described the use <b>of</b> <b>images</b> <b>of</b> the cathedral as virtual desecration. The letter stressed that they were in consultation with their lawyers and urged Sony to contact them so there can be a mutually satisfactory conclusion to the matter. Govender told reporters that the church officials had only been told of the content on 8 June 2007, and, after watching footage of gameplay posted on YouTube, said they were dismayed beyond belief and were shocked to see a place of worship being presented to youths as a place where guns may be fired, and that every year, they invite hundreds of teenagers to see the Cathedral and appreciate it as an alternative to violence. They added that it was a shame to have a game like this undermining such important work. They also sought that Sony apologise unreservedly.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to assess the {{relations}} between partial components <b>of</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> various touristically attractive locations. This research is focused on specific locations in vulnerable areas since the sustainable way of the tourism development concerns them in the highest manner and the touristic pressure on these locations permanently increases. The paper makes effort to extend the usual and nearly traditional understanding <b>of</b> the <b>image</b> in the tourism, which is usually related only to the problems of brand and/or the tourist destination. This is done through a survey realized at 26 selected locations with the aim to obtain 64 completely filled-in questionnaires in each location. Particular statements <b>of</b> respondents concerning the <b>image</b> <b>of</b> the visited location were summarized to the 20 categories. A multidimensional analysis was used to reveal the relations in partial answers. Authors have identified an important number <b>of</b> elements <b>of</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> the tourist attractions. By means of the analysis authors have identified differences between historic attractions and nature attractions. However, authors have identified simultaneously both the natural type <b>of</b> the <b>image</b> <b>of</b> the destination and the culture-historical type <b>of</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> the destination in all studied locations...|$|R
