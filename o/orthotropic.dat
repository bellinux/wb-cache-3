This unorthodox design was {{a direct consequence of}} material rationing by the state– Melnikov was limited to brick and wood, and even these were in short supply. The wooden ceilings have no supporting columns, nor horizontal girders. They were formed by a rectangular grid of flat planks, in a sort of <b>orthotropic</b> deck. The largest room, a 50 square meter workshop on the third floor, is lit with 38 hexagonal windows; equally large living room has a single wide window above the main entrance.|$|E
500|$|There are {{two kinds}} of stems or [...] "cladodes": long plagiotropic, bearing flowers at the ends and falling off after a few years, and long <b>orthotropic,</b> {{primarily}} serving for support and transport and staying on the plant. Plagiotropic stems grow in a star- or crown-like pattern around a central <b>orthotropic</b> stem.|$|E
500|$|The {{technology}} for the bridge was based on recent {{technology for}} pontoon bridges combined with Norwegian offshore technology. Among the technologies initially considered, but later ruled out, was that used in the Homer M. Hadley Memorial Bridge and the Hood Canal Bridge in the United States. Instead, an <b>orthotropic</b> deck was chosen, such as the Bergsøysund Bridge had used. The choice of a box girder bridge and the <b>orthotropic</b> deck were chosen because it gave the lower material use. Conventional pontoon bridges have lateral anchorage systems which fasten the bridge to the seabed. The technique had previously been used down to , but Salhusfjorden is [...] deep, making the method prohibitively expensive. The choice of a cable-stayed section allowed reduced traffic hazards in storms, a reduction in corrosion on the bridge deck, and improved passage of water beneath the bridge in support of wildlife.|$|E
500|$|The {{eventual}} {{solution was}} to add two additional <b>orthotropic</b> cantilever lanes {{either side of the}} bridge, which traffic could run on while the original road deck was replaced. The work was designed by Hyder Consulting and constructed by the descendent company of Cleveland Bridge that had worked on the original project. Reconstruction started in 1999, and was slightly delayed owing to an influx of tourists travelling to Cornwall to watch the Solar eclipse of August 11, 1999, whose line of totality passed through the county. The new deck contained 82 <b>orthotropic</b> panels, each one measuring [...] by [...] and weighing 20 tons. Work was completed in December 2001 at a total cost of £34 million; the two additional lanes were retained to increase the bridge's capacity. The completed construction weighed 25 tons less than the original bridge, and the design capacity is around 1,800 vehicles per day per direction over the main deck.|$|E
500|$|The two bridges are {{connected}} with a [...] long steel viaduct, which runs {{on top of the}} floating bridge, bringing the road from [...] above mean sea level. The viaduct weighs [...] and has a gradient of 5.7 degrees. It consists of spans between , with the roadway also built as an <b>orthotropic</b> deck with [...] thick plates. Overall, the construction of the bridge used [...] of concrete, of which [...] in the pontoons. The bridge was coated with [...] of paint.|$|E
500|$|The {{floating}} {{section is}} a steel {{box girder bridge}} with ten pontoons, which because of the fjord's depth are not laterally anchored. The roadway sits on an <b>orthotropic</b> deck. The pontoons and the cable-stayed bridge are built in concrete, with the main span being supported with 48 cables. The fjord end of the main span {{is supported by a}} [...] deep foundation, where the two bridges meet. From there and for , the roadwall has a 5.7 percent gradient on a viaduct anchored to the pontoon bridge.|$|E
500|$|The roadway lies {{on top of}} an <b>orthotropic</b> deck on a steel box girder, {{which is}} [...] wide, [...] tall and [...] long. The steel box girder weighs , of which [...] is {{high-strength}} low-alloy steel. The girder has an octagonal shape and is made with [...] thick steel plates. They are longitudinally stiffened by trapezoidal stiffeners supported by cross frames at most every [...] Two full bulkheads have been used for every pontoon pilaster, made from welded steel plates [...] thick. External brackets built into the bulkheads transfer the support forces to the pontoons. The girder was built in sections of 21, 36, and 42meters (69, 118, and 138ft), which were subsequently welded together into 11 modules with a skew angle of 1.2 to 1.3 degrees. The girder has a constant cross-section throughout the length, except at the anchoring points to the pontoons. The section from the land anchoring to the first pontoon is subject to the most stress, and is made with steel with a higher yield point. The inside of the girder has two dehumidifiers which ensure that it does not rust. The clearance under the girder is [...]|$|E

2500|$|The Wye Bridge is a [...] long {{cable-stayed}} bridge, which {{crosses the}} border {{marked by the}} River Wye between England and Wales, [...] south of Chepstow. It consists of a single large cable stayed section with two single-leg pylons supporting the bridge deck from {{the centre of the}} roadway. The deck is an <b>orthotropic</b> box girder similar to the Severn Bridge but has a different appearance as it has two sets of cable stays on each of two towers. Originally there was only one set of cable stays but these were replaced during the strengthening works. The Wye Bridge was built by Cleveland Bridge & Engineering Company.|$|E
2500|$|Early {{applications}} of matrix methods {{were applied to}} articulated frameworks with truss, beam and column elements; later and more advanced matrix methods, referred to as [...] "finite element analysis", model an entire structure with one-, two-, and three-dimensional elements {{and can be used}} for articulated systems together with continuous systems such as a pressure vessel, plates, shells, and three-dimensional solids. Commercial computer software for structural analysis typically uses matrix finite-element analysis, which can be further classified into two main approaches: the displacement or stiffness method and the force or flexibility method. The stiffness method is the most popular by far thanks to its ease of implementation as well as of formulation for advanced applications. The finite-element technology is now sophisticated enough to handle just about any system as long as sufficient computing power is available. Its applicability includes, but is not limited to, linear and non-linear analysis, solid and fluid interactions, materials that are isotropic, <b>orthotropic,</b> or anisotropic, and external effects that are static, dynamic, and environmental factors. This, however, does not imply that the computed solution will automatically be reliable because much depends on the model and the reliability of the data input.|$|E
2500|$|The Severn Bridge {{is located}} {{close to the}} former Aust Ferry. The bridge is a {{suspension}} bridge of conventional design, with the deck supported by two main cables slung between two steel towers. In 1966 the cables supporting the bridge deck were spun from [...] of wire. The main cables are each made up of 8,322 individual [...] wires. An unusual feature of the suspension cables carrying the deck {{is that they are}} not vertical, as for most suspension bridges, but rather arranged in a zig-zag fashion, with adjacent mounts closely spaced. The triangulation this offers is an attempt to reduce vibration, as is the prominent use of Stockbridge dampers on the cables. The bridge is [...] long, consisting of a [...] central span between the towers and the two [...] side spans. The towers rise to [...] above mean high water and are of hollow box construction. The deck is an <b>orthotropic</b> steel box girder of aerofoil shape with cantilevered cycle tracks and footway supported from the box. The shape of the bridge was determined by the designers Freeman, Fox and Partners following wind tunnel tests for the Forth Road Bridge, after the original wind tunnel model was accidentally destroyed. The sections of the deck were built at Fairfield-Mabey in Chepstow, and each 132tonne section was then floated down the river before being hoisted into position.|$|E
50|$|An <b>orthotropic</b> bridge or <b>orthotropic</b> deck is {{one whose}} deck {{typically}} comprises a structural steel deck plate stiffened either longitudinally or transversely, or in both directions. This allows the deck both to directly bear vehicular loads and {{to contribute to}} the bridge structure's overall load-bearing behaviour. The <b>orthotropic</b> deck may be integral with or supported on a grid of deck framing members such as floor beams and girders.|$|E
