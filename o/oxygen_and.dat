5|$|Inorganic {{elements}} play critical {{roles in}} metabolism; some are abundant (e.g. sodium and potassium) while others function at minute concentrations. About 99% of a mammal's mass {{is made up}} of the elements carbon, nitrogen, calcium, sodium, chlorine, potassium, hydrogen, phosphorus, <b>oxygen</b> <b>and</b> sulfur. Organic compounds (proteins, lipids and carbohydrates) contain the majority of the carbon and nitrogen; most of the <b>oxygen</b> <b>and</b> hydrogen is present as water.|$|E

40|$|The coupled {{conservation}} of mass equations for <b>oxygen,</b> carbon dioxide <b>and</b> nitrogen are written {{down for a}} lung model consisting of two homogeneous alveolar compartments (with different ventilation-perfusion ratios) and a shunt compartment. As inspired <b>oxygen</b> concentration <b>and</b> <b>oxygen</b> consumption are varied, the flux of <b>oxygen,</b> carbon dioxide <b>and</b> nitrogen across the alveolar membrane in each compartment varies. The result {{of this is that}} the expired ventilation-perfusion ratio for each compartment becomes a function of inspired <b>oxygen</b> concentration <b>and</b> <b>oxygen</b> consumption as well as parameters such as inspired ventilation and alveolar perfusion. Another result is that the "inspired ventilation-perfusion ratio and the "expired ventilation-perfusion ratio differ significantly, under some conditions, for poorly ventilated lung compartments. As a consequence, we need to distinguish between the "inspired ventilation-perfusion distribution, which is independent of inspired <b>oxygen</b> concentration <b>and</b> <b>oxygen</b> consumption, <b>and</b> the "expired ventilation-perfusion distribution, which we now show to be strongly dependent on inspired <b>oxygen</b> concentration <b>and</b> less dependent <b>oxygen</b> consumption. Since the multiple inert gas elimination technique (MIGET) estimates the "expired ventilation-perfusion distribution, it follows that the distribution recovered by MIGET may be strongly dependent on inspired oxygen concentration...|$|R

5|$|Nitrogen gas is an {{industrial}} gas {{produced by the}} fractional distillation of liquid air, or by mechanical means using gaseous air (pressurised reverse osmosis membrane or pressure swing adsorption). Nitrogen gas generators using membranes or pressure swing adsorption (PSA) are typically more cost and energy efficient than bulk delivered nitrogen. Commercial nitrogen is often a byproduct of air-processing for industrial concentration of oxygen for steelmaking and other purposes. When supplied compressed in cylinders it is often called OFN (oxygen-free nitrogen). Commercial-grade nitrogen already contains at most 20ppm <b>oxygen,</b> <b>and</b> specially purified grades containing at most 2ppm <b>oxygen</b> <b>and</b> 10ppm argon are also available.|$|E

5|$|Another {{potential}} problem that arises at {{the interface between}} wheel and axle (or axle and body) is the limited ability of an organism to transfer materials across this interface. If the tissues {{that make up a}} wheel are living, they will need to be supplied with <b>oxygen</b> <b>and</b> nutrients and have wastes removed to sustain metabolism. A typical animal circulatory system, composed of blood vessels, {{would not be able to}} provide transportation across the interface. In the absence of circulation, <b>oxygen</b> <b>and</b> nutrients would need to diffuse across the interface, a process that would be greatly limited by the available partial pressure and surface area, in accordance with Fick's law of diffusion. For large multicellular animals, diffusion would be insufficient. Alternatively, a wheel could be composed of excreted, nonliving material such as keratin, of which hair and nails are composed.|$|E
30|$|As {{can be seen}} in {{the contour}} lots of O vs C in Fig.  4, the first sample (sample A—caustic tower treated with PyGas) {{contains}} a very high amount (dark red zone) of molecules having about 5 – 7 <b>oxygens</b> <b>and</b> 10 – 25 carbons. Similar high concentrations are observed in the contour plot of O vs DBE and correspond to the area of about 5 – 7 <b>oxygens</b> <b>and</b> 0 – 15 DBE. Thus, sample A contains a significant amount of small aromatic/conjugated oxygenates.|$|R

5|$|Argon has {{approximately}} the same solubility in water as <b>oxygen</b> <b>and</b> is 2.5 times more soluble in water than nitrogen. Argon is colorless, odorless, nonflammable and nontoxic as a solid, liquid or gas. Argon is chemically inert under most conditions and forms no confirmed stable compounds at room temperature.|$|E
5|$|At room temperature, {{fluorine}} is a gas of diatomic molecules, {{pale yellow}} when pure (sometimes described as yellow-green). It has a characteristic pungent odor detectable at 20ppb.

5|$|Chlorine is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Cl and atomic number 17. The second-lightest of the halogens, it appears between fluorine and bromine in {{the periodic table}} and its properties are mostly intermediate between them. Chlorine is a yellow-green gas at room temperature.

5|$|Common {{chemical}} theory {{at that time}} held that an acid {{is a compound that}} contains oxygen (remnants of this survive in the German and Dutch names of oxygen: sauerstoff or zuurstof, both translating into English as acid substance), so a number of chemists, including Claude Berthollet, suggested that Scheele's dephlogisticated muriatic acid air must be a combination of <b>oxygen</b> <b>and</b> the yet undiscovered element, muriaticum.|$|E

Most deck decompression chambers are fitted with built in breathing systems (BIBS), which supply an alternative breathing gas to the occupants (usually <b>oxygen),</b> <b>and</b> discharge the exhaled gas outside the chamber, so the chamber gas is not excessively enriched by oxygen, which would cause an unacceptable fire hazard, and require frequent flushing with chamber gas (usually air).|$|E

40|$|Bioavailability {{of oxygen}} for the saline-water {{invertebrate}} Artemia franciscana was studied, since both <b>oxygen</b> concentration <b>and</b> <b>oxygen</b> diffusion rate change with salinity. Total haemoglobin concentration {{and the relative}} contribution of each of three haemoglobins was measured in specimens acclimated to different salinities <b>and</b> <b>oxygen</b> concentrations. Both haemoglobin concentration and contribution were influenced by salinity and the group observed (males, females with and females without eggs). Multiple regression analysis showed that total haemoglobin concentration was better correlated with oxygen concentration than oxygen partial pressure. The relative proportions of haemoglobins 1, 2 and 3 were better correlated with oxygen partial pressure than oxygen concentration. These results {{are related to the}} <b>oxygen</b> carrying capacity <b>and</b> <b>oxygen</b> affinity of the haemolymph. Our results show that oxygen bioavailability in a saline-water environment depends on the response (relative contribution of Hb 1, Hb 2 and Hb 3 or total haemoglobin concentration) that is studied.

5|$|Given that E°(O2/H2O) = +1.229V, {{which is}} less than +1.395V, it would be {{expected}} that chlorine {{should be able to}} oxidise water to <b>oxygen</b> <b>and</b> hydrochloric acid. However, the kinetics of this reaction are unfavorable, and there is also a bubble overpotential effect to consider, so that electrolysis of aqueous chloride solutions evolves chlorine gas and not oxygen gas, a fact that is very useful for the industrial production of chlorine.|$|E
