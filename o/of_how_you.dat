500|$|Vespertine is {{an album}} {{made by a}} {{character}} who's very introvert.(sic) And it's about the universe inside every person. This time around, I {{wanted to make sure}} that the scenery of the songs is not like a mountain or a city or outside, it's inside, so it's very internal. So I guess all three videos are very internal. [...] Sort <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> communicate with the world in a very intimate, personal way.|$|E
500|$|Morello and Cornell {{initially}} disagreed {{over the}} particulars of Cornell quitting the group, with Morello claiming that Cornell did not communicate directly with him about leaving, while Cornell countered: [...] "Tom and I did have communications {{about the fact that}} I was gonna go make a record, and that I was tired of what ended up seeming like political negotiations toward how we were gonna do Audioslave business and getting nowhere with it." [...] He also added that this process of [...] "doing Audioslave business" [...] led him to go solo. Cornell has said that the breakup was not about money, but that he was just not getting along with the other members during their later years. Said Cornell, [...] "Getting along as people is one thing. Getting along as a group of people that can work together in a band situation...We weren't particularly getting along well, no. Bands work in a way where everyone at some point has to have a similar idea <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> do things...Three albums into it, it started to seem like our interests weren't as conjoined anymore." ...|$|E
500|$|Scherzinger {{performed}} [...] "Poison", {{live for}} the first time, on November 28, 2010, during the week eight results show on series seven of The X Factor UK. She wore a red catsuit and long black trenchcoat for the performance. The Sun said [...] "Scherzinger stole the show last night" [...] with her display of [...] "live vocals". The judges gave the performance a standing ovation. On The Xtra Factor following the live performances, Louis Walsh and Simon Cowell praised Scherzinger's performance, respectively calling it [...] "one of the best live guest performances we've ever had" [...] and [...] "if you want an example <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> do it right... its Nicole. It was focus, performance, vocals...". The Daily Mail followed suit, saying [...] "Scherzinger put on a spectacle for her first live performance, complete with pyrotechnic lighting, full-size cage and a stage full of scantily-clad dancers... The former guest judge brought the house down with her energetic routine". Elena Gorgan of Softpedia agreed to say that Scherzinger wowed the [...] "explosive" [...] performance, earning her a standing ovation from the judges and audience. The following day, she reprised the performance on ITV's breakfast show, Daybreak before heading to London's Westfield Shopping Centre where she appeared on live screens to promote sports brand Reebok. She stayed in the UK until December 5, 2010, promoting the single.|$|E

War is the ultimate field of Shadow-activity, where all of its other activities lead you.

[...] But the members now agreed to an arrangement whereby {{each member of the}} LLC would receive an undisclosed sum prior to the transfer of their ownership rights to the Burning Man Project. Marian Goodell, board member and head of communication, addressed concerns about the lack of transparency with this statement: [...] "When you’re {{in the middle of a}} storm, if you’re going to explain all <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> got there, and how you’re going to get out, it often sets more panic among the survivors than if you just sail the boat out of the darkness." ...|$|E

2500|$|GameTrailers also {{reviewed}} it favorably, though {{slightly less}} so, {{giving it a}} 7.6/10, citing issues with the narrative structure, difficulty and minor gameplay bugs, but applauding the multiplayer modes. Eurogamer gave 7/10, stating [...] "All the same, you can't escape the feeling that Rockstar just isn't as good at a pure third-person shooter {{as it is with}} the open worlds of Grand Theft Auto or Red Dead Redemption, and in this linear context it's much harder to put up with its usual missteps in mechanics and difficulty." [...] Edge also gave 7/10, stating [...] "Max Payne 3 might solve the problem <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> manage to reload when carrying more than one gun, but detailing alone can't change {{the fact that this is}} a surprisingly conservative game from Rockstar".|$|E
2500|$|Sondheim also mentored {{a fledgling}} Jonathan Larson, {{attending}} Larson's workshop for his Superbia (a musical version of Nineteen Eighty-Four). In Larson's musical Tick, Tick... Boom!, the phone message is played in which Sondheim apologizes for leaving early, {{says he wants}} to meet him and is impressed with his work. After Larson's death, Sondheim called him one of the few composers [...] "attempting to blend contemporary pop music with theater music, which doesn't work very well; {{he was on his way}} to finding a real synthesis. A good deal of pop music has interesting lyrics, but they are not theater lyrics". A musical-theatre composer [...] "must have a sense of what is theatrical, <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> use music to tell a story, as opposed to writing a song. Jonathan understood that instinctively." ...|$|E
2500|$|Scherzinger's {{television}} and music video impact {{has also been}} acknowledged in pop culture where she is known for her music videos, which often incorporate raunchy outfits and dance breaks. Critics generally favor Scherzinger's intricate choreography. She is considered a sex symbol through her music videos. Simon Cowell praised Scherzinger's performance ability, respectively calling her [...] "one of the best live performers I've ever seen" [...] and [...] "if you want an example <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> do it right... its Nicole. It's focus, performance, vocals...". American recording artist Lady Gaga has been influenced by Scherzinger's role in the Pussycat Dolls saying, [...] "There's something that's very humbling {{about being able to}} work with a powerhouse group like that. Probably the biggest influence they've had on me is making me want to be a better writer." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Badu, the album's closing track, [...] "Out My Mind, Just in Time", is a three-{{movement}} song: [...] "The first {{movement is}} called 'Recovering Undercover Over-lover.' It actually {{sums up the}} whole album, because I'm talking about love and emotion – 'I need you to do this,' 'I {{want you to do}} this,' 'You make me feel like this,' 'Why don't you feel like this?' It's typical <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> feel in relationships. The second movement is called ... 'Easier Said Than Done,' and it's about {{how hard it is to}} change after you've been in a relationship for so long. And then the third movement is called 'But Not This Time,' because even though I've done things a certain way for so long, I won't do that this time". Andy Kellman of AllMusic described the song as being innocently as a piano ballad, before changing into a [...] "psychedelic, slow-motion soul-jazz" [...] song that sees Badu becoming [...] "increasingly fragmentary and tripped-out" [...] before being [...] "renewed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kierkegaard came to {{hope that}} no one would retain their sins even though they have been forgiven. And by the same token that no one who truly {{believed}} in the forgiveness of sin would live their own life as an objection against the existence of forgiveness. He made the point that Cato committed suicide before Caesar had a chance to forgive him. This fear of not finding forgiveness is devastating. Edna H. Hong quoted Kierkegaard in her 1984 book, Forgiveness is a Work As Well As a Grace and Kierkegaard wrote about forgiveness in 1847. [...] In 1954, Samuel Barber set to music Kierkegaard's prayer, [...] "Father in Heaven! Hold not our sins up against us but hold us up against our sins so that the thought of You when it wakens in our soul, and each time it wakens, should not remind us of what we have committed but of what You did forgive, not of how we went astray but <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>You</b> did save us!" ...|$|E
