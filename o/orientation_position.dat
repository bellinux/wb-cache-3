Performing integration on the inertial accelerations (using the original velocity as the initial conditions) using the correct kinematic equations yields the inertial velocities of the system, and integration again (using the original position as the initial condition) yields the inertial position. In our example, if the blindfolded passenger knew how the car was pointed and what its velocity was before he was blindfolded, and if they are able to keep track of both how the car has turned and how it has accelerated and decelerated since, they can accurately know the current <b>orientation,</b> <b>position,</b> and velocity of the car at any time.|$|E
5000|$|After {{the object}} {{which will be}} {{projected}} on is chosen or created, software is used to map {{the corners of the}} video to the surfaces. First, one must choose the images or video to project. Then, place each video on to its designated surface. Alternatively one may choose to map the entire scene in 3D and attempt to project and mask the image back onto its framework. The next step is defined as [...] "masking," [...] which means using opacity templates to actually [...] "mask" [...] the exact shapes and positions of the different elements of the building or space of projection. In 3D Mapping, coordinates need to be defined for where the object is placed in relation to the projector, the XYZ <b>orientation,</b> <b>position,</b> and lens specification of the projector have to result to a determined virtual scene. One such tool to help achieve this end is BLAM! add-on for blender 3D's open source 3D animation suite. Adjustments are commonly needed and made by manually tweaking either the physical or virtual scene for best results. Large projectors with 20,000 lumens or larger are used for large-scale projections such as on city skyscrapers. Otherwise, for smaller productions, a projector with a basic lower lumens will work. A 2200 lumen projector is adequate for projections under indoor light or theatrical lighting in most cases. Video mapping software such as MadMapper, Qlab, Troixatronix's Isadora, FaçadeSignage and VPT 6.0 are all downloadable for use in projects like these, though Adobe Photoshop, Adobe After Effects, Blender Blam!, and other packages can also be used by a creative artist.

This study offered empirical evidence on the relationship among market <b>orientation,</b> <b>positioning,</b> and hotel performance in Ghana’s (luxury) hotel sector. It also reports on the joint effect of market <b>orientation</b> and <b>positioning</b> on hotel performance in the same sector. Design/methodology/approach: Three hypotheses were investigated {{on the relationship between}} market orientation and hotel performance; positioning and hotel performance; and the joint effect of market <b>orientation</b> and <b>positioning</b> on hotel performance. A survey of star rated (luxury) hotels in the capital city of Ghana was used. One hundred and five (105) responses were used in the analysis. Descriptive statistics, exploratory factor analysis and hierarchical regression were used to test the three (3) hypotheses. Findings: All hypotheses were accepted. Market <b>orientation</b> and <b>positioning</b> jointly affect hotel performance, and the study provides hotel managers with suggestions on to enhance their performance via market <b>orientation</b> and <b>positioning.</b> Research limitations/implications: Management perspectives on market <b>orientation,</b> <b>positioning</b> and hotel performance were sought to the exclusion of customers. Future studies may consider using customer perspectives as well. Practical implications: Hotels should consider adopting market oriented positioning strategies to improve on their performance.

40|$|Introduction: Previous canine and {{in silico}} studies {{indicate}} that left ventricular (LV) <b>orientation</b> and <b>position</b> have clinically significant effects on standard ECG elements, which are particularly relevant in an advanced heart failure (HF) population. Our objectives were to investigate the real-world implications of these previous results by describing {{for the first time}} the range of LV <b>orientations</b> and <b>positions</b> in HF patients, identifying clinical predictors of <b>orientation</b> and <b>position,</b> and investigating how thoracic geometry may affect <b>orientation</b> and <b>position.</b> Materials and methods: Cardiac MRIs were used to measure LV <b>orientation</b> angles, LV <b>position,</b> chest dimensions, and the ratio of LV volume to thoracic area (LVTR). Multivariate regression analyses were used to identify significant predictors of <b>orientation</b> and <b>position.</b> Results: The mean frontal plane LV orientation angle was 31  ±  11 ° (range, 0 °– 47 °) and fell within the ranges used in previous studies of orientation effects. Orientation in the transverse plane, the effects of which have not been simulated, averaged 48  ±  10 ° (range, 21 °– 71 °). The ranges of LV positions in the frontal and transverse planes (7. 9 and 5. 6  cm, respectively) are similar to or greater than those used in silico. <b>Orientation</b> and <b>position</b> were weakly correlated with multiple significant predictors, and the relationship between HF progression and LV <b>orientation</b> and <b>position</b> could not be determined. Conclusion: Variation in LV <b>orientation</b> and <b>position</b> in advanced HF patients is large and cannot be readily predicted using the standard clinical variables or additional thoracic geometry measures used in this study. These findings may have significant clinical implications because of the possible effects of <b>orientation</b> and <b>position</b> on key ECG features. New tools and additional studies are needed before LV <b>orientation</b> or <b>position</b> data can be incorporated into clinical ECG interpretation...|$|R

It also gives them the ability to sense their surroundings and look for more suitable locations. In addition, the animals change their <b>orientation</b> <b>position</b> with water flow {{in order to maximize}} their food intake and growth. Both Chlamys rubida and Chlamys hastata exhibit these abilities, despite their morphological and behavioral differences. However, because of their profound distinctions that separate them between species, we suspect that the two groups will exhibit differences in their orientation preference to the current. <b>Orientation</b> <b>position</b> will optimize growth and feeding for these species within their local environment. Our hypothesis on scallops’ orientation was tested in a flume tank. Their angle in respect to the water flow were measured and recorded for comparison. The experiment demonstrated that there was no statistical difference in orientation preference between the two species in a well-lit environment, and that their vision had no considerable influence on their orientation. However, we were able to find a statistical difference in how the two species preferred to orient themselves within a dark environment...|$|E
40|$|AbstractContour {{integration}} {{plays an}} important role in linking local elements into global shape and the binding strength among local elements depends on both <b>orientation</b> and <b>position</b> features. The very high sensitivity reported for detecting the sinusoidal deformation of circular contours may result from the presence and concordance of both <b>orientation</b> and <b>position</b> cues to shape difference. In this study, position and orientation-defined micropatch-sampled radial frequency (MSRF) patterns were employed, which permit the independent assessment of the contributions of local <b>orientation</b> and <b>position</b> features to shape integration. It was demonstrated that, while both local <b>orientation</b> and <b>position</b> features can encode shape deformation, the human visual system is more sensitive to orientation-defined shape difference than to position-defined shape difference. Furthermore, integration of the local orientation feature into shape is more than two times stronger than that of local position, and may involve a global pooling mechanism. Nevertheless, optimal shape discrimination performance requires the analysis of both local <b>orientation</b> and <b>position</b> features...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} relative <b>orientation</b> and <b>position</b> {{detection methods}} for jumping sensor nodes (JSNs) recycling. The methods {{are based on}} motion captures of the JSNs by an RGB-D sensor mounted on a carrier robot and the dynamic cooperation between the carrier and the JSNs. A disc-like label with two different colored sides is mounted {{on the top of}} the JSNs. The RGB-D sensor can detect the motion of the label to calculate the <b>orientations</b> and <b>positions</b> of the JSNs and the carrier relative to each other. After the <b>orientations</b> and <b>positions</b> have been detected, the JSNs jump into a cabin mounted on the carrier in dynamic cooperation with the carrier for recycling. The performances of the proposed methods are tested with a prototype system. The results show that the carrier can detect a JSN from up to 2 m away and sense its relative <b>orientation</b> and <b>position</b> successfully. The errors of the JSN’s <b>orientation</b> and <b>position</b> detections relative to the carrier could be reduced to the values smaller than 1 ° and 1 cm, respectively, by using the dynamic cooperation strategies. The proposed methods in this paper could also be used for other kinds of mobile sensor nodes and multi-robot systems...|$|R

The {{mechanism by which}} the HS 2 enhancer and other functional components of the LCR act over the distance is not clear. We have used reverse transcription-PCR and RNase protection assays to analyze the transcriptional statuses of both the endogenous and the transfected HS 2 enhancer in erythroid K 562 cells. A novel pattern of HS 2 enhancer transcription was observed. The endogenous HS 2 enhancer was transcribed predominantly in the direction toward the downstream globin genes.
