5|$|Lemurs {{and humans}} are both {{primates}}. Ancestral primates had brown eyes, as most primates do today. The genetic basis of blue eyes in humans {{has been studied}} in detail and much is known about it. It {{is not the case}} that one gene locus is responsible, say with brown dominant to blue eye color. However, a single locus is responsible for about 80% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variation.</b> <b>In</b> lemurs, the difference(s) between blue and brown eyes are not completely known, but the same gene locus is not involved.|$|E
5|$|The {{length of}} the trinucleotide repeat {{accounts}} for 60% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> the age symptoms appear and the rate they progress. A longer repeat results in an earlier age of onset and a faster progression of symptoms. Individuals with more than sixty repeats often develop the disease before age 20, while those with fewer than 40 repeats may not ever develop noticeable symptoms. The remaining variation is due to environmental factors and other genes that influence the mechanism of the disease.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Rasmussen {{was part}} of a large multi-institutional {{collaboration}} investigating biodiversity hotspots, which have a prominent role in conservation. The study assessed locations quantitatively for three criteria of bird diversity – species richness, the level of threat, and the number of endemism species. The results demonstrated that hotspots did not show the same geographical distribution for each factor. Only 2.5% of hotspot areas are common to all three aspects of diversity, with over 80% of hotspots registering on only one criterion. Each criterion explained less than 24% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> the other factors, suggesting that even within a single taxonomic class, different mechanisms are responsible for the origin and maintenance of various aspects of diversity. Consequently, the different types of hotspots also vary greatly in their utility as conservation tools.|$|E

5|$|Lead {{exposure}} in children is also correlated with neuropsychiatric {{disorders such as}} {{attention deficit hyperactivity disorder}} and anti-social behaviour. Elevated lead levels in children are correlated with higher scores on aggression and delinquency measures. A correlation has also been found between prenatal and early childhood lead exposure and violent crime in adulthood. Countries with the highest air lead levels have also been found to have the highest murder rates, after adjusting for confounding factors. A May 2000 study by economic consultant Rick Nevin theorizes that lead exposure explains 65% to 90% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> violent crime rates in the US. A 2007 paper by the same author claims to show a strong association between preschool blood lead and subsequent crime rate trends over several decades across nine countries. Lead {{exposure in}} childhood appears to increase school suspensions and juvenile detention among boys. It is believed that the U.S. ban on lead paint in buildings in the late 1970s, as well as the phaseout of leaded gasoline in the 1970s and 1980s, partially helped contribute to the decline of violent crime in the United States since the early 1990s.|$|E

25|$|Because of the {{influential}} {{role that the}} US stock market plays in international finance, a New York University study in late 2014 interprets that in the short run, shocks that affect the willingness to bear risk independently of macroeconomic fundamentals explain most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> the US stock market. In the long run, the US stock market is profoundly affected by shocks that reallocate the rewards of a given level of production between workers and shareholders. Productivity shocks however play a small role in historical stock market fluctuations at all horizons in the US stock market.|$|E

Energy fields with 2 -dimensional variations representing 2 sets of dislocation boundaries lying at equal, but opposite, angles to the moving boundary are considered. The simulations show that the shape and overall migration rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recrystallization front is considerably affected by spatial <b>variations</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> deformation microstructure. It is seen that, depending on characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variations</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> deformation microstructure, highly asymmetrical protrusions and retrusions can develop on the migrating recrystallization front resulting in a migration velocity considerably larger than that expected from standard recrystallization models. It is also seen that, when <b>the</b> wavelength <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variations</b> <b>in</b> a deformation microstructure along the grain boundary is larger than <b>the</b> wavelength <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variations</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> direction <b>of</b> migration, parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boundary show a stop-and-go type of migration, resulting in a lower overall migration rate. These simulations thus reproduce and explain many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> typical features observed in recrystallization experiments.
