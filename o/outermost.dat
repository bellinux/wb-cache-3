5|$|Carpo is the <b>outermost</b> {{prograde}} {{moon and}} {{not part of}} a known family.|$|E
5|$|The heliosphere, the tenuous <b>outermost</b> {{atmosphere}} of the Sun, {{is filled with the}} solar wind plasma. This <b>outermost</b> layer of the Sun is defined to begin at the distance where the flow of the solar wind becomes superalfvénic—that is, where the flow becomes faster than the speed of Alfvén waves, at approximately 20 solar radii (0.1 AU).|$|E
5|$|The <b>outermost</b> primaries—those {{connected}} to the phalanges—are sometimes known as pinions.|$|E
5|$|The <b>outermost</b> —those {{connected}} to the phalanges.|$|E
5|$|The {{wettability}} of {{a surface}} {{is determined by}} the <b>outermost</b> chemical groups of the solid.|$|E
5|$|Whereas {{all other}} group 8 {{elements}} have 2 electrons in the <b>outermost</b> shell, in ruthenium, the <b>outermost</b> shell {{has only one}} electron (the final electron is in a lower shell). This anomaly is observed in the neighboring metals niobium (41), molybdenum (42), and rhodium (45).|$|E
5|$|S/2003 J 2 is the <b>outermost</b> moon of Jupiter, and is {{not part}} of a known family.|$|E
5|$|The flight {{feathers}} {{of the wing}} comprise 10 primaries, the <b>outermost</b> being very small, and 13 secondaries, and there are 12 tail feathers.|$|E
5|$|The <b>outermost</b> {{three of}} the known planets likely formed further away from the star, and {{migrated}} inward.|$|E
5|$|A {{lutetium}} atom has 71 electrons, {{arranged in}} the configuration 4f145d16s2. When entering a chemical reaction, the atom loses its two <b>outermost</b> electrons {{and the single}} 5d-electron. The lutetium atom is the smallest among the lanthanide atoms, due to the lanthanide contraction, {{and as a result}} lutetium has the highest density, melting point, and hardness of the lanthanides.|$|E
5|$|As a simple, visible surface polyhedron, {{the outward}} {{form of the}} final stellation is {{composed}} of 180 triangular faces, which are the <b>outermost</b> triangular regions in the stellation diagram. These join along 270 edges, which in turn meet at 92 vertices, with an Euler characteristic of 2.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius fallax is {{classified}} in the section Plinthogalus of the subgenus Plinthogalus of the genus Lactarius. Species in this section have brown to blackish caps, and a cap cuticle that contains a dissolved brown pigment. The cuticle of most species is of the trichoderm type—where the <b>outermost</b> hyphae emerge roughly parallel, like hairs, perpendicular to the cap surface.|$|E
5|$|Like other groups, {{the members}} of this family show {{patterns}} in their electron configurations, especially the <b>outermost</b> shells, resulting in trends in chemical behavior. However, lawrencium is an exception, since its last electron is transferred to the 7p1/2 subshell due to relativistic effects.|$|E
5|$|Midbody {{there are}} 29–41 rows of dorsal scales. These are {{strongly}} keeled {{except for the}} <b>outermost</b> rows. The ventral scale count is 123–147, the subcaudals 14–38. Females have no more than 24 subcaudals. The anal scale is single.|$|E
5|$|Order Heteronemertea. Comprises about 400 species. The {{majority}} are marine, but three are freshwater. Their body-wall muscles are disposed in four layers, alternately circular and length-wise {{starting from the}} <b>outermost</b> layer. The order includes the strongest swimmers. Two genera have branched proboscises.|$|E
5|$|Rhodium {{belongs to}} group 9 of the {{periodic}} table, but {{the configuration of}} electrons in the <b>outermost</b> shells is atypical for the group. This anomaly is also observed in the neighboring elements, niobium (41), ruthenium (44), and palladium (46).|$|E
5|$|Structure 17 is a {{pyramidal}} base in Plaza 2, to {{the west}} of Structures 15 and 16. It supported two rooms accessed via a double stairway on the northwest side of the temple. The entrance to <b>outermost</b> room once had two columns, although now only the lower portions of the walls and columns remain.|$|E
5|$|The mantle edge secretes a shell (secondarily {{absent in}} a number of taxonomic groups, such as the nudibranchs) that {{consists}} of mainly chitin and conchiolin (a protein hardened with calcium carbonate), except the <b>outermost</b> layer in almost all cases is all conchiolin (see periostracum). Molluscs never use phosphate to construct their hard parts, with the questionable exception of Cobcrephora.|$|E
5|$|The <b>outermost</b> {{layer of}} the body has no cuticle but {{consists}} of a ciliated and glandular epithelium containing rhabdites, which form the mucus in which the cilia glide. Each ciliated cell has many cilia and microvilli. The <b>outermost</b> layer rests on a thickened basement membrane, the dermis. Next to the dermis {{are at least three}} layers of muscles, some circular and some longitudinal. The combinations of muscle types vary between the different classes, but these are not associated with differences in movement. Nemerteans also have dorso-ventral muscles, which flatten the animals, especially in the larger species. Inside the concentric tubes of these layers is mesenchyme, a kind of connective tissue. In pelagic species this tissue is gelatinous and buoyant.|$|E
5|$|The <b>outermost</b> {{zone of the}} {{adrenal cortex}} is the zona glomerulosa. It lies {{immediately}} under the fibrous capsule of the gland. Cells in this layer form oval groups, separated by thin strands of connective tissue from the fibrous capsule of the gland and carry wide capillaries.|$|E
5|$|The {{pedosphere}} is the <b>outermost</b> {{layer of}} Earth's continental surface and {{is composed of}} soil and subject to soil formation processes. The total arable land is 10.9% of the land surface, with 1.3% being permanent cropland. Close to 40% of Earth's land surface is used for cropland and pasture, or an estimated 1.3km2 of cropland and 3.4km2 of pastureland.|$|E
5|$|At 162km, Puck is {{the largest}} of the inner moons of Uranus and the only one imaged by Voyager 2 in any detail. Puck and Mab are the two <b>outermost</b> inner {{satellites}} of Uranus. All inner moons are dark objects; their geometrical albedo is less than 10%. They are composed of water ice contaminated with a dark material—probably radiation-processed organics.|$|E
5|$|Both the Mont Blanc massif, and the Aiguilles Rouges {{range to}} its north, now {{form part of}} the {{external}} zone of the Alps, effectively being the <b>outermost</b> layers of rock. The central granites make up Mont Blanc, the steep slopes of the Drus, the Grandes Jorasses and the Dent du Géant, and at the highest points are topped by schists, which are visible {{in places such as}} Grands Montets and near Mont Blanc's summit.|$|E
5|$|Callisto is the <b>outermost</b> of {{the four}} Galilean moons of Jupiter. It orbits at a {{distance}} of approximately 1880000km (26.3 times the 71492km radius of Jupiter itself). This is significantly larger than the orbital radius1070000kmof the next-closest Galilean satellite, Ganymede. As a result of this relatively distant orbit, Callisto does not participate in the mean-motion resonance—in which the three inner Galilean satellites are locked—and probably never has.|$|E
5|$|Christian and Muslim {{philosophers}} modified Ptolemy's {{system to}} include an unmoved <b>outermost</b> region, the empyrean heaven, which came {{to be identified as}} the dwelling place of God and all the elect. Medieval Christians identified the sphere of stars with the Biblical firmament and sometimes posited an invisible layer of water above the firmament, to accord with Genesis. An outer sphere, inhabited by angels, appeared in some accounts.|$|E
5|$|Haumea's moons are {{unusual in}} a number of ways. They are thought to be part of its {{extended}} collisional family, which formed billions of years ago from icy debris after a large impact disrupted Haumea's ice mantle. Hiʻiaka, the larger, <b>outermost</b> moon, has large amounts of pure water ice on its surface, which is rare among Kuiper belt objects. Namaka, about one tenth the mass, has an orbit with surprising dynamics: it is unusually eccentric and appears to be greatly influenced by the larger satellite.|$|E
5|$|Histological {{analysis}} of the lines of arrested growth within the tibiae from the various ontogenetic stages of Limusaurus indicates that the animal was skeletally mature at six years in age. In older specimens, the <b>outermost</b> lines of arrested growth are very close together (forming {{what is known as}} the external fundamental system), indicating that rapid growth had ceased in these particular individuals.|$|E
5|$|In {{order of}} their {{distance}} from the planet, the irregular moons are Triton, Nereid, Halimede, Sao, Laomedeia, Psamathe, and Neso, a group that includes both prograde and retrograde objects. The five <b>outermost</b> moons {{are similar to the}} irregular moons of other giant planets, and are thought to have been gravitationally captured by Neptune, unlike the regular satellites, which probably formed in situ.|$|E
5|$|Mushrooms {{produce a}} spore prints that is yellow brown (especially in fresh prints) to olive brown. The smooth, {{yellowish}} spores measure 10–14 by 3–5μm, and range in shape from roughly elliptic to cylindric to subfusoid (somewhat spindle-shaped). The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 27.2–35.2 by 9.6–10.4μm. The cellular {{arrangement of the}} cap cuticle is a trichodermium (whereby the <b>outermost</b> hyphae emerge roughly parallel, like hairs, perpendicular {{to the surface of}} the cap) consisting of erect hyphae with a diameter of 3.2–6.4μm.|$|E
5|$|Oberon, also {{designated}} , is the <b>outermost</b> major moon of {{the planet}} Uranus. It is the second-largest and second most massive of the Uranian moons, and the ninth most massive moon in the Solar System. Discovered by William Herschel in 1787, Oberon is named after the mythical king of the fairies who appears as a character in Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. Its orbit lies partially outside Uranus's magnetosphere.|$|E
5|$|Plumes from Enceladus, {{which are}} similar in {{composition}} to comets, {{have been shown to}} be the source of the material in Saturn's E ring. The E ring is the widest and <b>outermost</b> ring of Saturn (except for the tenuous Phoebe ring). It is an extremely wide but diffuse disk of microscopic icy or dusty material distributed between the orbits of Mimas and Titan.|$|E
5|$|TBI {{is usually}} {{classified}} based on severity, anatomical {{features of the}} injury, and the mechanism (the causative forces). Mechanism-related classification divides TBI into closed and penetrating head injury. A closed (also called nonpenetrating, or blunt) injury occurs when the brain is not exposed. A penetrating, or open, head injury occurs when an object pierces the skull and breaches the dura mater, the <b>outermost</b> membrane surrounding the brain.|$|E
5|$|The {{alkali metals}} are a group (column) in the {{periodic}} table consisting of the chemical elements lithium (Li), sodium (Na), potassium (K), rubidium (Rb), caesium (Cs), and francium (Fr). This group lies in the s-block of {{the periodic table}} of elements as all alkali metals have their <b>outermost</b> electron in an s-orbital: this shared electron configuration results in them having very similar characteristic properties. Indeed, the alkali metals provide {{the best example of}} group trends in properties in the periodic table, with elements exhibiting well-characterised homologous behaviour.|$|E
5|$|The cerebrum, brainstem, cerebellum, {{and spinal}} cord {{are covered by}} three {{membranes}} called meninges. The membranes are the tough dura mater; the middle arachnoid mater and the more delicate inner pia mater. Between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater is the subarachnoid space, which contains the cerebrospinal fluid. In the cerebral cortex, close to the basement membrane of the pia mater, is a limiting membrane called the glia limitans; this is the <b>outermost</b> membrane of the cortex.|$|E
5|$|The ionic radii of the {{alkali metals}} are {{much smaller than}} their atomic radii. This is because the <b>outermost</b> {{electron}} of the alkali metals is in a different electron shell than the inner electrons, and thus when it is removed the resulting atom has one fewer electron shell and is smaller. Additionally, the effective nuclear charge has increased, and thus the electrons are attracted more strongly towards the nucleus and the ionic radius decreases.|$|E
5|$|The most basal theropods {{have five}} digits on the hand. Along the avian lineage, however, {{the number of}} digits in the hand decreased; by the {{emergence}} of the group Tetanurae, which includes birds, two digits had disappeared from the hand, leaving three digits. Traditionally, it has been hypothesized that the digits lost were the two <b>outermost</b> digits, i.e. digits IV V), in a process known as Lateral Digit Reduction (LDR).|$|E
