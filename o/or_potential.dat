5|$|A {{conservative}} {{force that}} acts on a closed system has an associated mechanical work that allows energy to convert only between kinetic <b>or</b> <b>potential</b> forms.

The force, therefore, is related directly to the difference in potential energy between two different locations in space, and can {{be considered to be}} an artifact of the potential field {{in the same way that}} the direction and amount of a flow of water can be considered to be an artifact of the contour map of the elevation of an area.|$|E

5|$|British {{journalist}} David Rose {{writes that}} by 1976 the Farm was already {{seen as a}} sink estate, and by 1980 a Department of the Environment report had suggested demolition, although a regeneration project after the 1985 riots led to improvements. Sir Kenneth Newman, Metropolitan Police commissioner from 1982 to 1987, regarded the estate as one of London's symbolic locations, <b>or</b> <b>potential</b> no-go areas, along with Railton Road in Brixton, All Saints Road in Notting Hill, the Notting Hill Carnival, and the Stonebridge Estate in Harlesden. The 1986 Gifford Inquiry into the rioting criticised the police for having adopted this attitude.|$|E

Collectively these six nonmetals are required for all life on Earth. They are further distinguished—in comparison to the halogens (F, Cl, Br, I, At) and noble gases—by their general capacity (<b>or</b> <b>potential)</b> to form allotropes; high atomisation energies; intermediate electron affinities; reactivity combined with low toxicity; ability to form alloys with metals; and the weak or neutral acid-base character of their group hydrides.|$|E

Termites always avoid nestmates infected with Metarhizium anisopliae spores, through vibrational signals released by infected nestmates. Other methods of defence include intense jerking and secretion of fluids from the frontal gland and defecating faeces containing alarm pheromones.|$|E
5|$|The {{two main}} {{constituent}} groups were the Allgemeine SS (General SS) and Waffen-SS (Armed SS). The Allgemeine SS {{was responsible for}} enforcing the racial policy of Nazi Germany and general policing, whereas the Waffen-SS consisted of combat units of troops within Nazi Germany's military. A third component of the SS, the SS-Totenkopfverbände (SS-TV), ran the concentration camps and extermination camps. Additional subdivisions of the SS included the Gestapo and the Sicherheitsdienst (SD) organizations. They were tasked with the detection of actual <b>or</b> <b>potential</b> enemies of the Nazi state, the neutralization of any opposition, policing the German people for their commitment to Nazi ideology, and providing domestic and foreign intelligence.|$|E

5|$|Great Northern Highway {{travels to}} remote areas of Western Australia, {{including}} the Munjina Roadhouse near the Hamersley Ranges, and {{the communities of}} Eighty Mile Beach, Wallal, Sandfire and Mandora, which are located between Broome and Port Hedland. It is the only sealed road between the Northern Territory border and major population centres {{in the north of}} the state. Economically, Great Northern Highway is also a vital link in the resource rich regions of the Wheatbelt, Mid West, Pilbara, and Kimberley. The key industries of mining, agriculture, and pastoral stations are all dependent on the highway as a significant and in some cases only method of transport. Tourism accounts for {{a significant portion of the}} road's traffic, and is a growing part of <b>or</b> <b>potential</b> growth source for the regional economies. The highway provides access to a variety of tourist attractions, including New Norcia, the Yilgarn area, and various national parks, including Karijini. Parts of the highway itself are included in the tourist routes Swan Valley Tourist Drive (Tourist Drive203) in Perth, Chittering Valley Tourist Way (Tourist Drive359) in Bullsbrook, Midlands Tourist Way (Tourist Drive360) from Upper Swan to Walebing, and Geikie–Windjana Tourist Way (Tourist Drive350) from Geikie Gorge National Park to Fitzroy Crossing.|$|E
5|$|Horizontal jumps (long {{jump and}} triple jump) and all throws must be {{initiated}} behind a line. In {{the case of}} horizontal jumps, that line is a straight line perpendicular to the runway. In the case of throws, that line is an arc or a circle. Crossing the line while initiating the attempt invalidates the attempt—it becomes a foul. All landings must occur in a sector. For the jumps, that is a sand filled pit, for throws it is a defined sector. A throw landing on the line {{on the edge of}} sector is a foul (the inside edge of the line is the outside edge of the sector). Assuming a proper attempt, officials measure the distance from the closest landing point back to the line. The measuring tape is carefully straightened to the shortest distance between the point and the line. To accomplish this, the tape must be perfectly perpendicular to the take off line in jumps, or is pulled through the center point of the arc for throws. The officials at the landing end of the tape have the zero, while the officials at the point of initiation measure and record the length. Whenever a record (<b>or</b> <b>potential</b> record) occurs, that measurement is taken (again) with a steel tape, and observed by at least three officials (plus usually the meet referee). Steel tapes are easily bent and damaged, so are not used to measure everyday competitions. For major competitions, each competitor gets three tries. The top competitors (usually 8 or 9 depending on that competition's rules or the number of lanes on the track) gets three more tries. At that level of competition, the order of competitors for those final three attempts are set—so the competitor in first place {{at the end of the}} third round is last, while the last competitor to qualify goes first. Some meets rearrange the competition order again for the final round, so the final attempt is taken by the leader at that point. At other competitions, meet management may choose to limit all competitors to four or three attempts. Whatever the format, all competitors get an equal number of attempts.|$|E
5|$|The {{brain of}} Smilodon had sulcal {{patterns}} similar to modern cats, which suggests an increased {{complexity of the}} regions that control the sense of hearing, sight, and coordination of the limbs. Felid saber-tooths in general had relatively small eyes that were not as forward-facing as those of modern cats, which have good binocular vision to help them move in trees. Smilodon was likely an ambush predator that concealed itself in dense vegetation, as its limb proportions were similar to modern forest dwelling cats, and its short tail would not have helped it balance while running. Unlike its ancestor Megantereon, which was at least partially scansorial and therefore able to climb trees, Smilodon was probably completely terrestrial due to its greater weight and lack of climbing adaptations. The heel bone of Smilodon was fairly long, which suggests {{it was a good}} jumper. Its well-developed flexor and extensor muscles in its forearms probably enabled it to pull down, and securely hold down, large prey. Analysis of the cross-sections of S.fatalis humeri indicated that they were strengthened by cortical thickening {{to such an extent that}} they would have been able to sustain greater loading than those of extant big cats, or of the extinct American lion. The thickening of S.fatalis femurs was within the range of extant felids. Its canines were fragile and could not have bitten into bone; due to the risk of breaking, these cats had to subdue and restrain their prey with their powerful forelimbs before they could use their canine teeth, and likely used quick slashing or stabbing bites rather than the slow, suffocating bites typically used by modern cats. On rare occasion as evidenced by fossils, Smilodon was willing to risk biting into bone with its canines. This may have been focused more towards competition such as other Smilodon <b>or</b> <b>potential</b> threats such as other carnivores than on prey.|$|E
