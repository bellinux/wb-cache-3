40|$|While the {{relation}} between code coverage measures and fault detection is actively studied, only few works have investigated the correlation between measures of coverage and of reliability. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to measuring code coverage, called the <b>operational</b> <b>coverage,</b> {{that takes into account}} how much the program's entities are exercised so to reflect the profile of usage into the measure of coverage. <b>Operational</b> <b>coverage</b> is proposed as (i) an adequacy criterion, i. e., to assess the thoroughness of a black box test suite derived from the operational profile, and as (ii) a selection criterion, i. e., to select test cases for operational profile-based testing. Our empirical evaluation showed that <b>operational</b> <b>coverage</b> is better correlated than traditional coverage with the probability that the next test case derived according to the user's profile will not fail. This result suggests that our approach could provide a good stopping rule for operational profile-based testing. With respect to test case selection, our investigations revealed that <b>operational</b> <b>coverage</b> outperformed the traditional one in terms of test suite size and fault detection capability {{when we look at the}} average results...|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} covrel, {{an adaptive}} software testing approach {{based on the}} combined use of <b>operational</b> profile and <b>coverage</b> spectrum, with {{the ultimate goal of}} improving the delivered reliability of the program under test. Operational profile-based testing is a black-box technique that selects test cases having the largest impact on failure probability in operation; as such, it is considered well suited when reliability is a major concern. Program spectrum is a characterization of a program’s behavior in terms of the code entities (e. g., branches, statements, functions) that are covered as the program executes. The driving idea of covrel is to complement operational profile information with white-box coverage measures based on count spectra, so as to dynamically select the most effective test cases for reliability improvement. In particular, we bias operational profile-based test selection towards those entities covered less frequently. We assess the approach by experiments with 18 versions from 4 subjects commonly used in software testing research, comparing results with traditional <b>operational</b> and <b>coverage</b> testing. Results show that exploiting <b>operational</b> and <b>coverage</b> data in a combined adaptive way actually pays in terms of reliability improvement, with covrel overcoming conventional operational testing in more than 80 % of the cases...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{proposes a}} new {{approach}} for generating selective test sequences from a LOTOS specification. First, based on the functional characteristics and semantic properties of the LOTOS operations, a criterion called <b>operational</b> <b>coverage</b> is developed, whereby, each of the LOTOS operations is assigned a mandatory set of sequences involving the actions in its operands. In general, these action sequences are not executable. A method called SELECTEST is then proposed for generating executable test sequences which satisfy the coverage criterion. SELECTEST first determines the cover for the specified operation from which a set of guides are obtained, each denoted as a possibly nonexecutable rooted path lying {{in the hierarchy of}} the LOTOS specification and passing through the operator. The guides are used to greatly speed up the search for the executable test sequences over the Petri-net representation transformed from the LOTOS specification. The coverage and method have also been generalized to the case of covering a set of LOTOS operations. The application to the Alternating Bit Protocol is included to illustrate the approach...|$|E

UAS are particularly useful in environmental monitoring and management {{because they have the}} capability to provide data at high temporal and spatial resolutions. Moreover, data acquisition costs are lower than those of conventional methods such as extensive ground sampling, manned airplanes, or satellites. Small fixed-wing UAS in particular offer further potential benefits as they extend the <b>operational</b> <b>coverage</b> of the area under study at lower operator risks and accelerate data deployment times. Taking these aspects into account, UAS might be an effective tool to support management of invasive plant based on early detection and regular monitoring.

40|$|This {{internship}} {{report is}} submitted in a partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Business Administration, 2016. Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 87 - 88). Bangladesh, the country of immense potentiality is a developing country located in the Southeast-Asia. Every year {{the size of the}} economy of this country is growing up {{with the help of the}} proper utilization of resources. With GDP growth of about 7. 5 % year-on-year in nine months of 2015 / 2016 fiscal year, the total production of goods and services stands higher than ever. New industries and potential sectors are growing up besides the agricultural industry, which is still the biggest contributor in the national economy of Bangladesh. Moreover, Bangladesh is presently going through the phase of demographic dividend, almost one fourth of the country’s population consist of youth working age population and every year almost 2. 00 million people are joining the labor force. Very exciting scenario indeed! But when the economists of our country are asked about the economic circumstance of Bangladesh, despite the presence of all these above statistics they do not seem to present a very convincing picture regarding the future prospect of this country. Searching for the reason of this depressing vibe reveals that, unlike the general mass the economists’ see-through the facts where they discover superfluous figures, exaggerated numeric and secrecy about the negative statistics of the country. Rather than presenting the truth the government and its affiliated authorities always present a picture which could convince people about their eligibility regarding governance. It is said that, identification of a problem is equal to 50 % of the solution. But, in Bangladesh identification of problem is regarded as weakness and because of that rather than solving a problem from its root concealment of information gets the preference as always. But as an attempt to break that trend and to solve a problem from its very core the topic “Small and Medium Enterprise Financing in Bangladesh: The Means to Battle Unemployment and Poverty” has come into light. In this report attempt has been made to portray an analysis regarding Small and Medium Enterprise financing in Bangladesh and its potentiality. To bring a meaningful insight in the research work a survey was also been conducted within the students of BRAC Business School and the people in my social circle. In addition, the research was conducted by gathering information from the secondary sources e. g. online journals, newspaper articles, research statistics of national and international think-tanks, guidelines of organizations such as ADB, World Bank. After gathering the required data, MS Office and MS excel was used to find out optimum information from the sample and then analysis was done by following the deductive reasoning method to figure out the outcome. In conclusion it is found that, though SME financing is believed as the most potential source of financing in battling unemployment and poverty but it is yet to be the tool for that purpose judging by the present method of financing. So to enhance the performance of SME financing as par its prospective, recommendations are stated at the end to draw the conclusion of the project. Apart from the project work this report also consists of two other sections; organizational overview and description of the job during the attachment of 12 weeks. In the very beginning of the report information regarding the attached institution has been portrayed and in my case it was about IDLC Financing Limited.

Evaluative coverage of these technologies was compared on dimensions found to characterise energy issues (economic, environmental, technological future/political, physical and psychological risks). In addition, comparisons were drawn between coverage in areas 'threatened' with the potential siting of a new nuclear power station and that in 'unaffected' areas. The development stage of the two technologies and the degree of 'factual' as opposed to 'polemical' coverage they attracted were also recorded. In evaluative terms, nuclear power was evaluated overwhelmingly negatively, and alternative positively. Moreover, this pattern showed a degree of consistency irrespective of the dimension of evaluation. The 'threatened' subsample was most negatively disposed towards nuclear power. Polemical coverage was greater for nuclear power than for alternatives and greatest in the 'threatened' sample. The category also contained articles more likely to attract attention because of their greater headline size and length. Whereas most coverage of nuclear power concentrates on preoperational or <b>operational</b> stages <b>coverage</b> of alternatives is more concerned with its formative and planning states. These findings were related to people's attitudes concerning nuclear power, and the growth is antinuclear feeling in particular. ...|$|R

These two data sets have enhanced our observational capability since the launch of 4 to 5 geostationary satellites around the globe and {{the implementation of the}} ASDAR program. A sample is illustrated of recent commercial aircraft wind reports at the 300, 250, and 200 mb surfaces over parts of the Pacific Ocean, North America, and Atlantic Ocean. This data coverage is impressive. The rms difference between these data and those obtained from rawinsonde ascents (colocated) is around + or - 4 m/s. In a recent study of the cloud winds, from geostationary satellites, Johnson (1984) noted almost 15 m/s vector wind differences between estimates from GMS, GOES, and METEOSAT with respect to the rawinsonde observations. These results are illustrated based on the assessment of Johnson (1984). Overall, the commercial aircraft winds are the more accurate of these two observing systems. However, it is apparent that because of the sparcity of airline routes across southern oceans, one has to rely rather heavily on the cloud winds as a primary data source over the tropical southern oceans.

5000|$|Secondly, it is {{necessary}} to create an <b>operational</b> statistical <b>coverage</b> of production itself, which can be used to allocate incomes, activities and transactions in the economy as either belonging to [...] "production", or falling outside [...] "production". Thus, some work produces something in the economic sense, other work does not. In general, national accounts adopt a very wide definition of production; it is defined as any activity of resident [...] "institutional units" [...] (enterprises, public services, households) combining the factors of production (land, labour and capital) to transform inputs into outputs. This includes both market production as well as non-market production, if it recognisably generates an income. The advantage of the wide definition is, that practically all flows of production-related income can be captured (but {{at the same time a}} large amount of unpaid work -housework and voluntary work - is not accounted for). Nevertheless, some incomes are ruled out of production and regarded as transfers of wealth. A transfer is defined basically as a payment made or income received without providing any good, service or asset in return, for example: government benefits. Some forms of interest on loans, some property rents, and most capital gains on financial assets and property are also excluded, they are effectively transfers (flows of income and expenditure which are regarded as unrelated to production and to the value of new output) or intermediate expenditure.|$|R

Some experts, however, consider that longer periods of treatment might be necessary in certain high prevalence and transmission environments based upon past unsuccessful field experience and modelling. Methodology/Principal Findings: To evaluate predictors of success in a LF control program we conducted an ecological study during a pre-existing MDA program. We studied 27 villages in Lihir Island, Papua New Guinea, from two areas with different infection rates before MDA. We undertook surveys to collect information on variables potentially having an influence {{on the outcome of}} the program, including epidemiological (baseline prevalence of infection, immigration rate), entomological (vector density) and <b>operational</b> (treatment <b>coverage,</b> vector control strategies) variables. The success in a village was defined using variables related to the infection (circulating filarial antigenemia prevalence, 1 %) and transmission (antigenemia prevalence, 1 in 1000 children born since start of MDA). 8709 people were involved in the MDA program and average coverage rates were around 70 %. The overall prevalence of filariasis fell from an initial 17. 91 % to 3. 76 % at round 5 (p, 0. 001). Viewed on a village by village basis, 12 / 27 (44 %) villages achieved success. In multivariate analysis, low baseline prevalence was the only factor predicting both success in reducing infection rates (OR 19, 26; CI 95 % 1, 12 to 331, 82) and success in preventing new infections (OR 27, 44; CI 95 % 1, 05 to 719, 6).

It is intended to inform Canadian Geospatial Data Infrastructure (CGDI) stakeholders about the nature and scope of digital geospatial data archiving and preservation and the realities, challenges and good practices of related operational policies. Burgeoning growth of online geospatial applications and the deluge of data, combined with the growing complexity of archiving and preserving digital data, has revealed a significant gap in the <b>operational</b> policy <b>coverage</b> for the Canadian geospatial data infrastructure (CGDI). Currently there is no commonly accepted guidance for CGDI stakeholders wishing or mandated to preserve their geospatial data assets for long-term access and use. More specifically, {{there is little or no}} guidance available to inform operational policy decisions on how to manage, preserve and provide access to a digital geospatial data collection. The preservation of geospatial data over a period of time is especially important when datasets are required to inform modeling applications such as climate change impact predictions, flood forecasts and land use management. Furthermore, data custodians may have both a legal and moral responsibility to implement effective archiving and preservation programs. Based on research and analysis of the Canadian legislative framework and current international practices in digital data archiving and preservation, this primer provides guidance on the factors to be considered and the steps to be taken in planning and implementing a data archiving and preservation program. It describes an approach to establishing a geospatial data archives based on good practices from the literature and Canadian case studies. This primer will provide CGDI stakeholders with information on how to incorporate archiving and preservation considerations into an effective data management process that covers the entire life cycle (DCC, 2013) (LAC, 2006) of their geospatial data assets (i. e., creation and receipt, distribution, use, maintenance, and disposition.

The current study aims to develop {{the process of the}} Val-de-Marne department's SAMU system (SAMU 94) in an efficient manner that meets the population's needs using limited resources. For this purpose, we propose a discrete event simulation (DES) model implemented in the ARENA software to analyze possible changes in the SAMU 94 processes that would lead to enhanced <b>operational</b> efficiency for <b>coverage</b> performance (i. e., the percentage of calls for which the patient wait time before a SAMU 94 rescue team arrives does not exceed a specific target time). Hence, the model enables to test five categories of scenarios that are mainly related to the level of resources used as well as the location of rescue teams throughout the service area. Among other results, we found that repositioning a portion of the existing teams into potential bases increased the 20 -min coverage performance up to 4. 5 % in average. Furthermore, this improvement in coverage can reach 7. 3 % when the whole fleet is relocated based on the multi-period redeployment plan obtained from simulation optimization...|$|R
40|$|Excerpt] A health {{insurance}} exchange is a structured marketplace {{for the sale}} and purchase of {{health insurance}}. “Customers” can include individuals and businesses. The insurance companies (“issuers”) that choose to sell their products through an exchange {{may be required to}} comply with consumer protections, such as offering insurance to every qualified applicant. Exchanges, however, are not issuers; rather, exchanges contract with issuers who will make insurance products available for purchase through exchanges. Essentially, exchanges are designed to bring together buyers and sellers of insurance, with the goal of increasing access to coverage. This rather broad definition allows for a great deal of latitude, and therefore variance, in the number and scope of responsibilities covered in a particular exchange. For example, the role of an exchange may be more or less administrative: facilitating the sale and purchase of health insurance. An administrative-only exchange may function similar to websites that allow individuals to find airline travel options and purchase tickets (e. g., Kayak). Such an approach does not necessarily change or establish standards for the products being sold (whether they are health plans or airline tickets), or limit the types of buyers and sellers participating in the exchange, beyond what already exists in the private market. An example of a minimalist health insurance exchange is the Utah Health Exchange. Essentially, Utah’s exchange is an Internet portal that is “designed to connect consumers to the information they need to make informed health care choices, {{and in the case of}} health insurance, to execute that choice electronically. ” At the other end of the spectrum, an exchange may have multiple functions beyond the role of insurance marketplace. For instance, an exchange may be responsible for implementing regulatory standards, such as requiring standardization of all products offered through it or imposing requirements on exchange participants. An exchange may be responsible for determining eligibility for exchange plans and government-provided subsidies. An example of a more regulatory-oriented exchange is the Health Connector (“Connector”) in Massachusetts. Similar to Utah’s exchange, the Connector provides an online tool to allow consumers and others to find commercial health insurance options available to them. In addition, the Connector also manages a publicly subsidized coverage program for low-income state residents, and offers certificates to exempt individuals from the state’s individual mandate, among other duties. An exchange may occupy a physical location and/or be virtual (i. e., performing its functions on the Internet). It may be governed by a public agency, a private entity, or a hybrid organization. The insurance options offered through an exchange may also vary across insurance markets and plan types. Nonetheless, while the authority and responsibilities of an exchange may vary, its fundamental purpose is to provide a venue where insurance companies may sell their insurance products and purchasers can compare and choose from multiple options available to them. Thus an exchange allows for “one-stop shopping” with respect to health insurance. The exchange concept was included in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA, P. L. 111 - 148, as amended), as a means to increase access to health insurance. While ACA places many restrictions on the design and function of exchanges, the law also leaves many operational decisions to the states. Such flexibility will likely lead to variation in exchange models across the states. For example, a state may decide to operate an exchange by itself, establish an exchange in partnership with the federal government, or leave this work entirely to the federal government. States had to declare whether they will have a state exchange by December 14, 2012. By February 15, 2013, states must declare whether they will operate an exchange in partnership with the federal government. The initial open enrollment period for all exchanges will begin on October 1, 2013, and all exchanges are to be <b>operational</b> and offering <b>coverage</b> on January 1, 2014. This report looks at the requirements for exchanges established in ACA and provides information on the requirements and choices available to states for the establishment, functions, financial responsibilities, and coverage of the ACA exchanges. It also includes a brief discussion of the interactions between exchanges and other provisions in the law...|$|R
40|$|The {{operational}} research model was utilised to enhance communicable disease policy, public health practice and patient management in Mpumalanga Province, South Africa. The value {{and scope of}} this approach for improving malaria, measles, leprosy and cholera control was investigated. Confidential inquiries identified contributory health system related factors in deaths due to malaria and cholera in Mpumalanga Province. A multi-disciplinary medical, laboratory and public health team carefully reviewed the clinical records and special investigations of patient deaths attributed to malaria between 1 January and 30 June 1996. The record review was supplemented by interviews with next-of-kin and confidential reports by health staff to determine the presence of avoidable factors or deviations from minimum acceptable standards of case management that {{may have contributed to}} the deaths. Confidential inquiries were conducted into all suspected cholera deaths between 1998 - 2001. This approach resulted in corrective action to prevent future deaths. Malahapanga, a remote spring in the Kruger National Park, South Africa, has proven a valuable site for original research on the behaviour of Anopheles arabiensis, the most important malaria vector in southern Africa. An evolving {{operational research}} agcnda has defined preferred feeding periods and anatomical feeding sites, biting patterns, including distance from breeding site, and the effect of mechanical barriers and application of topical N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET) to ankles and feet on Anopheles arabiensis feeding. Research findings have directly influenced national malaria prevention guidelines, larviciding around residential camps in nature reserves, and malaria outbreak response in a rural African village. The Mpumalanga Malaria Control Programme traditionally relied on light microscopy of Giemsa-stained thick blood films for malaria diagnosis. A series of operational research studies documented the shortcomings of microscopic diagnosis, the appropriateness and accuracy of rapid malaria card tests and led to the first introduction of card tests for primary diagnosis of malaria in a public health program. The Mpumalanga results highlighted the potential role of rapid tests for "Rolling Back" malaria in selected areas. A resulting national appreciation of the importance of standardised field evaluation of malaria diagnostic tests has led to Mpumalanga being requested to perform routine evaluation of new malaria diagnostic tests prior to introduction through the national purchasing system. The first African sentinel surveillance site for routinely evaluating in vivo efficacy of sulfadoxine-pyrimetbamine(SP) against Plasmodium falciparum by 42 -day follow-up was established in Mpumalanga Province. This followed a successful chloroquine in vivo study during 1997 that led to a change in treatment policy from chloroquine to SP for first-line P. falciparum malaria therapy. In vivo SP studies in 1998 and 2000 in Mpumalanga and in KwaZulu-Natal, a neighbouring province in 2000, confirmed treatment efficacy, provided a more comprehensive understanding of drug resistance evolution, and allowed investigation of the differential resolution of clinical symptoms and peripheral parasitaemia, an initial evaluation of the adequacy of the recommended SP dosage for adults exceeding 60 kilograms, and determination of gametocyte levels at different stages following therapy. The recognised success of the Mpumalanga sentinel surveillance site for influencing treatment policy has resulted in a sentinel surveillance network for epidemiological research into malaria in South Africa. The feasibility of measles elimination in southern Africa was studied in Mpumalanga using an <b>operational</b> research model. <b>Coverage</b> levels, obtained from a comprehensive district-based population survey in 1997, make elimination highly improbable by routine vaccination alone, and a strong negative correlation between routine and campaign coverage supported the complimentary approach of combining routine and supplementary immunisation for measles elimination. Mass immunisation campaigns have dramatically impacted on the measles disease burden, reflected by notified deaths and admissions reviewed during a Mpumalanga hospital register review in April 1999. Analysis of coverage levels achieved during recent inununisation campaigns in South Africa supported the contention that judicious timing of campaigns is essential if high coverage is to be achieved. A simple telephonic survey during March 2001 proved valuable for verifying the availability of appropriate patient management following potential rabies exposures. This rapid survey technique provided valuable information for correcting the official database of rabies vaccine and immunoglobulin availability and resulted in training of provincial pharmaceutical managers on rabies. Rapid telephonic surveys may be appropriate for auditing other health programs, particularly where a means for independently validating responses is readily available. To explore positive and negative attributes of operational research that impact on its value for influencing communicable disease control policy and practice, the grounded theory approach was used with groups of experienced Masters of Public Health students in South Africa and Australia to analyse the series of operational research studies conducted between 1995 and 1999 to refine malaria diagnosis in Mpumalanga Province. A key theme was the extraordinary relevance of local operational research, which takes account of disease epidemiology, available material and human resources, and the local biological, political, soeio-economic and technological environment. It emerged that where research is planned and conducted in equal partnership with control program staff, there is rapid application of research findings for control and decreased resistance from decision-makers. The central role which operational research can play in gathering the evidence necessary for effectively planning communicable disease control programs and bridging the gap between evidence and enhanced policy and practice, is illustrated in this thesis by drawing all a wide range of operational research interventions conducted in Mpumalanga Province, South Africa, between 1995 and 2001...|$|R
