The catalysts have been prepared by dry as well as wet impregnation. The oxidic precursor catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, surface area and pore volume measurements, and temperature-programmed reduction. Catalysts prepared by dry or wet impregnation are essentially the same. At low metal <b>oxide</b> <b>contents</b> the catalysts are of the monolayer type.

A correlation could be established between reducibility of the oxidic monolayer-type catalysts and the activity for thiophene hydrodesulfurization.

Butene hydrogenation activity of the sulfided MoO 3 /SiO 2 and WO 3 /SiO 2 monolayer-type catalysts also correlates with reducibility of the oxidic systems.

40|$|International audienceAdsorption of the {{herbicide}} glyphosate and {{its main}} metabolite AMPA (aminomethylphosphonic acid) was investigated on 17 different agricultural soils. Batch equilibration adsorption data are shown by Freundlich adsorp- tion isotherms. Glyphosate adsorption is clearly affected by equilibration concentrations, but the nonlinear AMPA adsorp- tion isotherms indicate saturation of the adsorption sites with increasing equilibrium concentrations. pHCaCl 2 (i. e. experi- mental pH) is the major parameter governing glyphosate and AMPA adsorption in soils. However, considering pHCaCl 2 values, available phosphate amount, and amorphous iron and aluminium <b>oxide</b> <b>contents</b> by using a nonlinear multiple regression equation, obtains the most accurate and powerful pedotransfer rule for predicting the adsorption constants for these two molecules.

2500|$|The {{addition}} of lead oxide to potash glass also reduces its viscosity, rendering it more fluid than ordinary soda glass above softening temperature (about [...] ), with a working point of [...] The viscosity of glass varies radically with temperature, {{but that of}} lead glass is roughly 100 times {{less than that of}} ordinary soda glasses across working temperature ranges (up to [...] ). From the glassmaker’s perspective, this results in two practical developments. First, lead glass may be worked at a lower temperature, leading to its use in enamelling, and second, clear vessels may be made free from trapped air bubbles with considerably less difficulty than with ordinary glasses, allowing the manufacture of perfectly clear, flawless objects. When tapped, lead crystal makes a ringing sound, unlike ordinary glasses. Consumers still rely on this property to distinguish it from cheaper glasses. Since the potassium ions are bound more tightly in a lead-silica matrix than in a soda-lime glass, the former when struck absorbs more energy. This causes the lead crystal to oscillate, thereby producing its characteristic sound. Lead also increases the solubility of tin, copper, and antimony, leading to its use in colored enamels and glazes. The low viscosity of lead glass melt is the reason for typically high lead <b>oxide</b> <b>content</b> in the glass solders.|$|E

This work was to identify which soil properties are mostly related to LREE bioavailability and what extraction method is the most promising approach for assessing bioavailability of LREEs to wheat under field conditions. A comparison was made between four commonly used extractants (DTPA, EDTA, CaCl 2 and CH 3 COOH), and the results suggested that the LREE concentrations in wheat roots significantly Correlated with soil pH and amorphous Fe <b>oxide</b> <b>contents</b> in soils, but were independent of soil organic matter (SOM), crystalline Fe and Mn <b>oxide</b> <b>contents,</b> and cation exchange capacity (CEC). The contents of LREEs in shoots were independent of any soil properties. Both DTPA- and EDTA-extractable LREEs were significantly correlated to LREE concentrations in wheat roots and shoots. DTPA extractable LREEs were comparable to LREEs in wheat roots, however, the EDTA exetractable LREEs overestimated the LREE accumulation in wheat roots. Neither root nor shoot LREEs showed significant correlation with CH 3 COOH extractable LREEs, suggesting that the CH 3 COOH extraction method was not suitable for predicting LREE bioavailability. CaCl 2 method was unable to estimate the LREE bioavailability due to poor data distribution in correlation analysis. Overall, DTPA extraction method was preferred to other extraction methods for estimating bioavailability of LREEs to wheat. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
