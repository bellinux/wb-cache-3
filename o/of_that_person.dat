25|$|The Open Brethren {{teach that}} baptism plays {{no role in}} salvation, and is {{properly}} performed only after a person professes Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour.

25|$|In 1969's Dune Messiah, a Navigator named Edric takes {{part in a}} {{plot against}} the emperor, Paul Atreides, the other conspirators being the Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, the Tleilaxu Face Dancer Scytale, and Paul's embittered consort, Princess Irulan of House Corrino.

25|$|It {{has been}} found that two {{converging}} bimodal stimuli can produce a perception that is not only different in magnitude {{than the sum of its}} parts, but also quite different in quality. In a classic study labeled the McGurk effect, a person's phoneme production was dubbed with a video <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>person</b> speaking a different phoneme. The end result was the perception of a third, different phoneme. McGurk and MacDonald (1976) explained that phonemes such as ba, da, ka, ta, ga and pa can be divided into four groups, those that can be visually confused, i.e. (da, ga, ka, ta) and (ba and pa), and those that can be audibly confused. Hence, when ba – voice and ga lips are processed together, the visual modality sees ga or da, and the auditory modality hears ba or da, combining to form the percept da.|$|E

25|$|In Redemption Ark, Skade and Clavain {{independently}} encounter technology {{captured by}} the Mademoiselle, that permits the alteration of a ship's inertial mass in order to permit high-g acceleration for interstellar travel. It works by suppressing fluctuations and turmoil in quantum foam that supposedly causes momentum and inertia (similar {{to the concept of}} Higgs Bosons). It is also mentioned in that the technology may have been linked to the alien tower (in Diamond Dogs, Turquoise Days). Skade tries to modify the technology with the help of Exordium to allow faster than light travel, via a state transition from tardyonic to tachyonic, but her efforts are spectacularly unsuccessful, and the technology itself has the side effect of removing individuals caught in the transition bubbles from all recent history, as well as crippling her ship. Only those very close to the area of effect remember a person who is erased or unravelled backwards in time and recorded history indicates a much earlier death <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>person.</b> Because the victims (the deleted and nearby observers) are the only thing that remain from the time line where the victims began, people suddenly panicking and searching for a 'colleague' who died years before (in the new timeframe) can be the only sign of an accident. This happens at least twice in the novels. The Inhibitors make reference to a similar effect erasing entire species from history. As such, neither they nor any other species in the galaxy with the technology to build inertia suppressing drives ever use them to travel faster than light.|$|E
25|$|The ritual {{was usually}} {{conducted}} approximately every 10–12 years for all girls, including infants, within a tharavad {{who had not}} previously {{been the subject of}} it. Higher-ranked groups within the caste, however, would perform the ritual more frequently than this and in consequence the age range at which it occurred was narrower, being roughly between age 10 and 13. This increased frequency would reduce the likelihood of girls from two generations being involved in the same ceremony, which was forbidden. The karnavan organised the elaborate ritual after taking advice from prominent villagers and also from a traditional astrologer, known as a Kaniyan. A pandal was constructed for the ceremony and the girls wore ornaments specifically used only on those occasions, as well as taking a ritual bath in oil. The ornaments were often loaned as only a few villagers would possess them. The person who tied the thali would be transported on an elephant. The higher the rank <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>person</b> then the greater the prestige reflected on to the tharavad, and also vice versa since some people probably would refuse to act as tier in order to disassociate themselves from a group and thereby bolster their claims to be members of a higher group. Although information is far from complete, those who tied the thali for girls of the aristocratic Nair families of Cochin in Central Kerala appear to have been usually Samantans, who were of higher rank, or occasionally the Kshatriyas, who were still higher. The Nambudiri Brahmins of Central Kerala acted in that role for the royal house of Cochin (who were Kshatriyas), but whether they did so for other Kshatriyas is less certain. The Kshatriyas would tie for the Samantans. Having the thali of each girl tied by a different man was more prestigious than having one tier perform the rite for several girls. The thali tying was followed by four days of feasting, and on the fourth day the marriage was dissolved.|$|E

500|$|The second commandment {{prohibits the}} use of God's name in vain. Many ancient {{cultures}} believed that names were sacred; some had prohibitions on when a person's name could be spoken. The Gospel of John relates an incident {{where a group of}} Jews attempted to stone Jesus after he used a sacred name of God to refer to himself. They interpreted his statement as a claim of divinity. [...] Since they did not believe that he was God, they considered this blasphemy, which under Mosaic law carries a death penalty. Kreeft writes that all of the names by which God is known are holy, and thus all of those names are protected by the second commandment. The Catechism states, [...] "Respect for his name is an expression of the respect owed to the mystery of God himself and to the whole sacred reality it evokes." [...] The Catechism also requires respect for the names of people out of respect for the dignity <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>person.</b>|$|E

The series would be centered on Bernthal as Castle, and was described as a stand-alone series, outside of the series leading up to The Defenders. Loeb implied that Marvel Television had not instigated the development of the spin-off and were focusing on making [...] "the best 13 episodes of Daredevil season two" [...] at the time, but did say, [...] "I’m never going to discourage a network from looking at one of our characters and encouraging us to do more....If we are lucky enough that through the writing, through the direction, through the actor that people want to see more <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>person,</b> terrific."
