40|$|Volatile <b>organochlorine</b> <b>compounds</b> {{emitted from}} natural sources can {{participate}} in environmentally relevant processes affecting life on Earth, such as stratospheric ozone destruction and warming of the troposphere. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate if forest bogs contribute to the environmental input of naturally produced volatile <b>organochlorine</b> <b>compounds.</b> The concentrations of four different volatile <b>organochlorine</b> <b>compounds</b> were determined in ambient air, rainwater, surface water, and sub-surface water. For chloroform, up to 10 -times higher concentrations were detected in the surface water compared to the sub-surface water taken at 40 cm depth. As the concentrations of chloroform in rainwater where almost in the same range as the concentrations in the sub-surface water, a formation of chloroform is suggested in the surface water. The results of this study indicate forest bogs as a possible new natural source for the input of volatile organochlorine into the environment...|$|R
40|$|<b>Organochlorine</b> <b>compounds,</b> such as {{polychlorinated biphenyls}} (PCBs), {{pentachlorophenol}} (PCP), p,p'-DDE and Toxaphene, {{have been widely}} used in industry and agriculture for more than fifty years. Although they have served their purpose very effectively and at low cost, many of these compounds have been banned in the United States due to their persistence in the environment and their threat to human health. Their natural resistance to degradation has made <b>organochlorine</b> <b>compounds</b> the target of many studies that have been designed to convert them into less toxic compounds. At present there is not a single, simple method than can completely dechlorinate PCBs, PCP, p,p'-DDE and Toxaphene. The work presented here reports the use of a novel bimetallic system, palladized iron (Pd/Fe), to effect the complete dechlorination of these compounds, at ambient temperature and pressure, in a matter of minutes. The dechlorination reaction occurs {{on the surface of the}} palladized iron, with removal of all the chlorine atoms from the chlorinated compound and yields the completely dechlorinated molecule and chloride ions as reaction products. The chlorinated compound is reductively dechlorinated while the iron particles are oxidized to Fe²⁺ Water is also reduced in the presence of iron, generating hydrogen, which is collected in the palladium lattice. The palladium is therefore necessary to store hydrogen gas; the "Pd·H₂" acts as a powerful reducing agent and is primarily responsible for the rapid and complete dechlorination of the <b>organochlorine</b> <b>compounds.</b> The Pd/Fe bimetallic system is potentially useful for the large scale remediation of groundwater or soil contaminated with <b>organochlorine</b> <b>compounds.</b> Palladized iron is relatively inexpensive and easy to prepare, and it rapidly and completely dechlorinates <b>organochlorine</b> <b>compounds.</b> For these reasons, the Pd/Fe system should be investigated further for applications in the field...|$|R

40|$|Objectives Serum {{levels of}} {{persistent}} <b>organochlorine</b> <b>compounds</b> may be predictive {{of their body}} burden, if adjusted by total serum lipids. Their value may be predicted by three diVerent formulae, requiring only values of serum cholesterol and triglycerides. The study was aimed at: (i) evaluating the validity of these formulae; (ii) evaluating the inXuence of diVerent estimates on serum levels of lipid adjusted persistent <b>organochlorine</b> <b>compounds.</b> Methods We determined the levels of cholesterol, triglycerides and phospholipids by enzymatic assays on serum samples from 121 subjects living in a polluted area of Northern Italy. On the same samples and on an additional set from 69 pregnant women of the same area, we determined also polychlorinated biphenyls, hexachlorobenzene and p,p-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene. In women, analytes were determined also on adipose tissue samples. Results Formulae provided results comparable to those obtained as sum of cholesterol, triglycerides and phospholipids. In women, we found highly signiWcant relationships among lipid adjusted pollutant levels in serum and adipose tissue, independently from the used formula. Conclusions Formulae allow a valid adjustment of <b>organochlorine</b> <b>compounds</b> in serum. The algorithm proposed by Phillips et al. provides some slight advantage over the others, in terms of simplicity of use...|$|R

40|$|Organochlorine {{pesticide}} residues and polychlorinated biphenyls were determined in raw materials, fish feeds and fillets from fish exposed through the productive cycle (14 months) to experimental diets with different percentages of fish oil replacement with vegetable oils. Detectable amounts of <b>organochlorine</b> <b>compounds</b> {{were found in}} raw materials derived from fish sources with none being detected in vegetable ingredients. Fish feeds presented trace concentrations of contaminants at the ng/g level, which varied according to {{the contribution of the}} different resources used in their manufacture. Contaminants did not accumulate during the first 11 months of exposure, and low concentrations of <b>organochlorine</b> <b>compounds</b> were found both at the start {{and at the end of}} this feeding period. Fillets from fish fed the fish oil diet presented the highest concentrations of <b>organochlorine</b> <b>compounds,</b> with these decreasing in proportion to fish oil replacement. Three months of fish oil re-feeding during the finishing phase only produced significant bioaccumulation over the course of the first month. By optimizing fish meal and fish oil replacement with vegetable oils alternative feeds can contribute to significantly reduce the risk of organochlorine uptake by consumers. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Investigation of the Formation of Polychlorodibenzodioxins /-Furans and {{of other}} <b>Organochlorine</b> <b>Compounds</b> in Thermal Industrial Processes Within the EU-project MINIDIP (ENV 4 -CT 97 - 0587) ''Minimization of Dioxins in Thermal and inustrial Processes: Mechanism, Monitoring, Abatement'' {{a series of}} samples from thermal {{industrial}} processes was investigated {{with respect to the}} formation potential of <b>organochlorine</b> <b>compounds,</b> especially of polychlorinated dioxins/furans. The material was obtained from the cement industry, municipal waste incineration, iron ore processing, zinc recycling, stainless steel production and from an electricity plant. The samples were characterized by selected analytical techniques (XRFA, DSC, Total-Organic Chlorine, GC-MS etc.). The formation potential for <b>organochlorine</b> <b>compounds</b> (PCDD/F, PClBz, PClPh, PCB) was determined by a special experimental technique (thermal treatment of the solids in air in the temperature range of 250 - 350 C) and by quantitative analysis of the compounds formed. The investigation of the materials indicated considerable differences in formation: Due to the high temperatures in the process and due to their composition (Cu << 0. 01 %, Cl 0. 5 - 1 %) samples from the cement fabrication showed only low native PCDD/F concentrations and no significant formation rates. Similar is the behaviour of samples from stainless steel production and from an electricity plant. Of great interest was material from the iron ore sintering, especially of fly ash from the electrostatic precipitators. Due to the high chloride content (8 - 32 %), the Cu-concentration (0. 3 %) and the carbon content (2. 9 - 3. 8 %) optimum conditions exist for the formation of PCDD/F and of other <b>organochlorine</b> <b>compounds.</b> (orig.)

50|$|An organochloride, <b>organochlorine</b> <b>compound,</b> chlorocarbon, or {{chlorinated}} hydrocarbon is an organic compound containing {{at least one}} covalently bonded atom of chlorine that {{has an effect on}} the chemical behavior of the molecule.
