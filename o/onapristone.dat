50|$|<b>Onapristone</b> (INN) (developmental code names ZK-89299, ZK-299) is a synthetic, steroidal antiprogestogen with {{additional}} antiglucocorticoid activity which {{was developed by}} Schering and described in 1984 but was never marketed. It is a silent antagonist of the progesterone receptor (PR), {{in contrast to the}} related antiprogestogen mifepristone (which is a weak partial agonist of the receptor). Moreover, compared to mifepristone, <b>onapristone</b> has reduced antiglucocorticoid activity, shows little antiandrogenic activity, and has 10- to 30-fold greater potency as an antiprogestogen. The drug was under development for clinical use, for instance in the treatment of breast cancer and as an endometrial contraceptive, but was discontinued during phase III clinical trials in 1995 due to findings that liver function abnormalities developed in a majority patients.|$|E

40|$|Progesterone {{receptor}} and estrogen receptor {{participate in}} growth and differentiation {{of the different}} rat decidual regions. Steroid hormone receptor antagonists were used to study steroid regulation of decidualization. Here we describe a suppressive interaction between progesterone receptor (<b>onapristone)</b> and estrogen receptor (ICI 182780) antagonists and their relation to a rescue phenomenon with concomitant regulation of Hand 2, Bmp 2 and p-ERK 1 / 2 during the early decidualization steps. Phenotypes of decidua development produced by antagonist treatments were characterized by morphology, proliferation, differentiation, angiogenesis and expression of signaling molecules. We found that suppression of progesterone receptor activity by <b>onapristone</b> treatment resulted in resorption of the implantation sites with concomitant decrease in progesterone and estrogen receptors, PCNA, KI 67 antigen, DESMIN, CCND 3, CX 43, Prl 8 a 2, and signaling players such as transcription factor Hand 2, Bmp 2 mRNAs and p-ERK 1 / 2. Moreover, FGF- 2 and Vegfa increased {{as a consequence of}} <b>onapristone</b> treatment. Implantation sites from antagonist of estrogen receptor treated rats developed all decidual regions, but showed an anomalous blood vessel formation at the mesometrial part of the decidua. The deleterious effect of <b>onapristone</b> was partially counteracted by the impairment of estrogen receptor activity with rescue of expression levels of hormone steroid receptors, proliferation and differentiation markers, and the induction of a probably compensatory increase in signaling molecules Hand 2, Bmp 2 and ERK 1 / 2 activation compared to oil treated controls. This novel drug interaction during decidualization could be applied to pathological endometrial cell proliferation processes to improve therapies using steroid hormone receptor targets.

40|$|Abstract. The {{corpus luteum}} (CL) forms after {{ovulation}} and {{acts as a}} temporary endocrine gland that produces progesterone (P 4), a hormone that is essential for implantation and maintenance of pregnancy in mammals. In pregnant women, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) secreted by the conceptus prevents luteolysis. hCG also increases the survival of cultured human luteinized granulosa cells (hLGCs). To clarify the maintenance mechanism of the human CL, we investigated the effects of hCG and P 4 receptor antagonists, <b>onapristone</b> (OP) and RU 486, on the viability of hLGCs. With the patients’ consent, hLGCs were isolated from follicular aspirates for in vitro fertilization. The cells were cultured with hCG (0. 1, 1...|$|E

40|$|Background: Antiprogestins {{appear to}} be a new {{approach}} for the endocrine therapy of breast cancer. Most breast cancer cells are growth inhibited by TGF-beta. Any change of tu-morcellular TGF-beta secretion could have some impact on tumorcellular growth. We addressed our question to whether the antiprogestin <b>onapristone</b> can induce TGF-beta secretion in breast cancer cells in vitro and whether a possible induc-tion correlates with the antiproliferative effect and the recep-tor status of the cells. Materials and methods: We examined the ER and PR positive breast cancer cell lines MCF 7 and T- 47 D and an ER and PR negative variant T- 47 D/x. Hormone receptor levels were determined by EIA, total (LTGF-beta + active TGF-beta) and active TGF-beta by a radioreceptor assay.

30|$|Mifepristone is {{a potent}} {{glucocorticoid}} receptor (GR) and progesterone receptor (PR) antagonist, {{as well as a}} weak androgen receptor (AR) antagonist (Song et al. 2004). Mifepristone is currently FDA approved for the treatment of hyperglycemia secondary to Cushing’s disease and termination of pregnancy (Spitz and Bardin 1993; Johanssen and Allolio 2007). While a single dose of 200  mg of mifepristone combined with misoprostol is sufficient to terminate pregnancy, studies in Cushing’s Syndrome suggest that higher doses may be required for potent anti-GR effects (Nieman et al. 1985). Animal studies suggest that GR antagonism may be of value in the treatment of a variety of diseases such as glucocorticoid-dependent hypertension, arthritis, glaucoma, psychosis, and addiction, although clinical studies have yet to be reported. Several small single agent studies of mifepristone and another PR antagonist <b>onapristone</b> have been evaluated for advanced breast cancer with disappointing results. However, these studies have been focused on use of these agents as PR antagonists in PR positive disease (Klijn et al. 2000; Romieu et al. 1987; Perrault et al. 1996; Bakker et al. 1990).|$|E
40|$|Glycoconjugate {{expression}} in endometrial epithelium varies in a cycle-dependent manner in many species and is probably {{fundamental to the}} establishment of a receptive uterine envi-ronment for the implanting embryo. We have examined the dis-tribution of N-acetyl galactosamine (GalNAc) -containing se-quences bound by Dolichos biflorus agglutinin (DBA) in the cy-cling endometrium of the human and baboon (Papio anubis). In the human, DBA binding was absent in the proliferative and early secretory phases of the cycle, increasing thereafter both in glands and on the surface epithelium. In contrast, DBA bind-ing in the baboon was maximal in the proliferative phase, di-minishing to almost indistinguishable levels in the late secretory phase. Treatment of early to mid-secretory-phase baboons with the antiprogestin <b>Onapristone</b> caused staining to revert to the proliferative-phase pattern, confirming the importance of pro-gesterone in the decrease in DBA staining. Investigations with other GalNAc-binding lectins indicated that epithelial GalNAc residues were present throughout the cycle. Variation in steroi-daIly dependent 1, 2 fucosyl transferase activity may therefore be responsible for the appearance of the new, DBA-binding, nonreducing terminal structure GalNAceal, 3 (Fuca 1, 2) -GalIR 1, 4 GIcNAcli in the human during the mid-secretory phase and in the baboon during the late proliferative phase...|$|E
40|$|Forskolin (FSK; an {{activator}} of adenylyl cyclase) and cortisol synergistically {{increase the}} concentration of oxytocin receptors (OTRs) in rabbit amnion cells. The aims {{of this study were}} to characterize potential physiological regulators of OTR concentrations acting through adenylyl cyclase and to clarify the mechanisms of potentiation by cAMP and cortisol. Both isoproterenol (ISO) and parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) elevated amnion cell cAMP levels and OTR concentrations. The effects of ISO and PTHrP on OTR were potentiated by cortisol. Cortisol had no effect on the ability of ISO or PTHrP to stimulate adenylyl cyclase activity, and cAMP did not affect the number or affinity of glucocorticoid receptors in whole cells or in cytosol. Adenylyl cyclase activation, however, caused conversion of mifepristone (RU 486) from a glucocorticoid antagonist to agonist. Thus, mifepristone elevated OTR receptor concentrations in the presence of FSK. In contrast, a structurally related glucocorticoid antagonist, <b>onapristone</b> (ZK 98 299), was unaffected by cAMR Because glucocorticoid recep-tors bound to mifepristone are capable of interacting with DNA, whereas onapristone-occupied receptors are not, we conclude that cAMP affects glucocorticoid receptor-DNA interactions, accounting for the synergistic effects of cAMP and cortisol on OTRs...|$|E

Whether characteristics of premature remodeling of the cervix after antiprogestins or ovariectomy {{are similar to}} that at term {{was the focus of}} the present study. Groups of pregnant rats were treated with vehicle, a progesterone receptor antagonist (<b>onapristone</b> or mifepristone), or ovariectomized on day 17 postbreeding. As expected, controls given vehicle delivered at term while rats delivered preterm after progesterone receptor antagonist treatment or ovariectomy. Similar to the cervix before term, the preterm cervix of progesterone receptor antagonist-treated rats was characterized by reduced cell nuclei density, decreased collagen content and structure, as well as a greater presence of macrophages per unit area. Thus, loss of nuclear progesterone receptor-mediated actions promoted structural remodeling of the cervix, increased census of resident macrophages, and preterm birth much like that found in the cervix at term. In contrast to the progesterone receptor antagonist-induced advance in characteristics associated with remodeling, ovariectomy-induced loss of systemic progesterone did not affect hypertrophy, extracellular collagen, or macrophage numbers in the cervix. Thus, the structure and macrophage census in the cervix appear sufficient for premature ripening and birth to occur well before term. With progesterone receptors predominantly localized on cells other than macrophages, the findings suggest that interaction...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to evaluate and elucidated the potential of selective progesterone receptor modulators (SPRMs) to be an effective emergency contraception (EC). The data are extracted from the literature through the MEDLINE database service from 2000 – 2010. The SPRMs are in fact progesterone receptor ligands that could bind to progesterone receptor (PR) and exert antagonistic, agonistic or mixed agonist-antagonistic effects. These SPRMs are mifepristone, <b>onapristone,</b> asoprisnil, ulipristal, proellex among other compounds. Currently developed SPRMs may exert contraceptive effects by inhibiting ovulation and retarding endometrial synchronization. Low-doses of progesterone antagonists retard endometrial maturation without affecting ovulation. Mifepristone being a SPRM is effective for prevention of pregnancy but with prostaglandin acts as an excellent abortifacient; yet could not compete with levonorgestrel as EC. However, a single dose of 30 mg ulipristal acetate, another SPRM with similar effectiveness and side effect profiles as 1. 5 mg levonorgestrel EC, has shown wider ‘window of effect’ by inhibition of the LH peak even if administered at the advanced pre-ovulatory phase, a time when use of levonorgestrel EC is no longer effective. Thus, ulipristal acetate goes one-step ahead of levonorgestrel in the field of emergency contraception treatment. Further studies are needed to explore the potential of other SPRMs to be cutting edge emergency contraceptive drugs...|$|E

Based on its chemical nature, we anticipated that RU- 486 may have potent antioxidant properties. We used the oxidation of LDL as our model system. RU- 486 {{and a similar}} compound, <b>onapristone,</b> at 1 - 5 -microM concentrations, decreased the formation of oxidized LDL. LDL isolated from plasma of subjects who were orally supplemented with RU- 486 was resistant to oxidation, as compared to LDL isolated from control plasma. The antioxidant effect of RU- 486 appears to reside in the dimethylaminophenyl side chain moiety. Reduction of the A-ring of the steroid molecule {{had no effect on}} its antioxidant property. Analogs of RU- 486 which lack the dimethylaminophenyl group, were without antioxidant activity. Levonorgestrel, which lacks the dimethylaminophenyl group failed to inhibit the oxidation of LDL even at 100 -microM levels. In contrast, ethinylestradiol and estradiol which do not possess the dimethylamino group, were able to inhibit the oxidation of LDL by virtue of their phenolic steroid "A" ring. Thus RU- 486, with its long half life, high plasma concentrations, association with lipoproteins, and ability to readily enter the cell may have additional intra- and extra-cellular antioxidant effects...|$|E

A careful evaluation of existing major review papers and recently published articles was carried out focusing on mifepristone, the most widely studied selective progesterone receptor modulator, which was first used for the voluntary interruption of an early gestation. Other selective progesterone receptor modulators, especially those with partial agonist action, have shown little activity during pregnancy in animal models. Besides early and late voluntary interruption of gestation, selective progesterone receptor modulators have been tested in a variety of obstetrical situations: to obtain a ripening of the cervix, for the medical management of early embryonic loss and foetal death, for the induction of labour at term and for the medical treatment of extra-uterine pregnancies.

40|$|A {{distinct}} {{spatial and}} temporal pattern of connexin 26 and connexin 43 (cx 26 and cx 43) expression was observed in the rat endometrium in response to embryo implantation; however, connexin expression was suppressed during the preimplantation period. Pseudopregnant rats did not show connexin mRNA, while artificial decidualization induced by a scratch led to a strong expression of cx 26 and cx 43 in the endometrium of these animals. In order to examine the regulatory effects of ovarian steroid hormones on connexin expression, ovariectomized rats were treated with progesterone (P) and/or estradiol- 171 (E 2). Untreated, ovariectomized animals expressed mRNA for cx 43, but not for cx 26. Endometrial expression of mRNA for both connexins was strongly enhanced by E 2 treatment; immunolabeling revealed protein for cx 26 in the uterine luminal epithelial cells and for cx 43 in the uterine stromal cells. P treatment, either alone or in combination with E, suppressed expression of connexin mRNA. P suppression {{in the presence of}} E 2 was reversible when P was withdrawn. When administered on Days 0 - 2 of pregnancy, the antiprogestin <b>onapristone</b> inhibited the effect of P and gave rise to strong expression of both connexin transcripts. These results demonstrate that expression of cx 26 and cx 43 in the rat uterine endometrium is differentially regulated by E and P during early pregnancy...|$|E
40|$|Acquisition of {{functional}} receptivity by the endometrium {{is assumed to}} be effected by progesterone-dependent expression and repression of several genes during the implantation window in a menstrual cycle. In the present study, we employed differential display (DD) reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR) to identify progesterone-dependent gene/gene fragments that are differentially expressed during the peri-implantation phase in receptive and nonreceptive endometria, obtained from fertile and infertile bonnet monkeys respectively. Receptive endometria were obtained from regularly cycling (n= 5) fertile female bonnet monkeys. Endometrial nonreceptivity was induced by treating bonnet monkeys with either 2 · 5 mg (n= 5) or 5 · 0 mg (n= 5) <b>onapristone</b> (ZK 98 · 299), an antiprogestin, on every third day for one cycle. Ovulation, levels of circulatory hormones (estradiol and progesterone) and menstrual cycle length did not change in treated animals; however, endometrial growth was retarded. DD 2, one of the differentially expressed cDNA fragments, showed higher representation in nonreceptive endometria than in receptive endometria. The DD 2 sequence was found to be homologous to the sequence of the carboxyl terminal region of Rab coupling protein (RCP), a recently discovered protein involved in intracellular vesicular trafficking. To confirm the identity of DD 2 as RCP, RT–PCR studies were carried out with a forward primer deduced from the RCP sequence and a reverse primer from the DD 2 sequence.

40|$|In {{the present}} study we {{examine the effects of}} {{medroxyprogesterone}} acetate (MPA) on the specific antibody secretion to T-dependent antigens. Our results show that the in vivo administration of MPA to mice, 7 or 90 days before immunization with sheep red blood cells (SRBC), significantly enhanced both, primary and secondary antibody responses, without affecting delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH). These effects could be counteracted by the anti-progestin <b>onapristone</b> or ZK 98299 (ZK) suggesting that MPA interacted with progesterone (PRG) receptors to increase B-cell response. To better understand the mechanisms involved in MPA activity we carried out cultures of splenocytes, bone marrow cells or lymph node cells from immunized mice in the presence of MPA, and evaluated the amount of antibody release to supernatants. We found that low doses of MPA (10 − 9 m and 10 − 10 m) significantly enhanced the in vitro production of specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies, an effect that appears to involve the interaction of the progestin with PRG receptors, as judged by the inhibition of MPA effects with ZK (10 − 8 m) or RU 486 (10 − 9 m). These receptors were detected by flow cytometry analysis in a proportion of T lymphocytes. Because MPA did not increase the number of immunoglobulin-secreting cells, our findings suggest that MPA enhanced the capacity of individual cells to produce specific immunoglobulin...|$|E
40|$|Treatment of {{lactating}} rats {{with the}} anti-progestin Mifepristone or <b>Onapristone</b> adversely affects growth of their litters. The present studies aimed to elucidate the underlying mechanism. The treatment did {{not interfere with}} the behavioural interactions between mothers and pups, which are required for normal litter growth. Treatment with the antagonists had a stimulatory action on ovarian oestrogen production. However, ovarian hormones did not play a role in litter growth impairment, as this also occurred with lactating ovariectomized rats. Treatment with anti-progestins did not affect the concentrations of the macronutrients in milk (protein, lactose and lipid), nor did it change the fatty acid composition of lipid. Reduced litter growth was not related to a possible direct effect of exposure of the suckling young to the drugs via the milk. Direct injections into them unequivocally affected adrenal gland and testicular development, but did not affect their body-weight development. Milk secretion, as measured by the milk weight accumulating during 6 or 24 h following sudden removal of litters in advanced lactation, was not impaired by the treatments. However, the ingestion of food and water by dams treated with Mifepristone was significantly below that of control animals. It is concluded that litter growth impairment during treatment of lactating rats with anti-progestin results from the reduction of the intake of food and water by the mother...|$|E

The present studies were designed to determine the P 4 binding characteristics of this protein. Western blot analysis using an antibody that recognizes the P 4 binding site of the nuclear P 4 receptor (C- 262) confirmed that the 60 -kDa protein was localized to the plasma membrane of both granulosa cells and spontaneously immortalized granulosa cells (SIGCs). To determine whether this protein binds P 4, proteins were immunoprecipitated with the C- 262 antibody, electropho-resed, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with a horserad-ish peroxidase-labeled P 4 in {{the presence or absence}} of nonla-beled P 4.

This study was undertaken to determine whether in-traluteal progesterone (P 4) is involved in Fas L–mediated luteal cell death in the bovine corpus luteum (CL) in vitro. Moreover, we studied whether an antagonist of P 4 influences gene expres-sion of the bcl- 2 family and caspase- 3 and the activity of cas-pase- 3 in the bovine CL. Luteal cells obtained from the cows in the midluteal phase of the estrous cycle (Days 8 – 12 of the cycle) were exposed to a specific P 4 antagonist (<b>onapristone</b> [OP], 1024 M) with or without 100 ng/ml Fas L.

A specific inhibitor of cyclooxygenase (PTGS), PTGS 2 (NS- 398), also reduced cell viability, whereas an inhibitor of PTGS 1 (FR 122047) did not affect it. The overall results suggest that PGE 2 and PGF 2 alpha locally play luteoprotective roles in bovine CL by suppressing apoptosis of LSCs. apoptosis, corpus luteum, corpus luteum function, progesterone, prostaglandin...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Estrogen and {{progesterone}} are potent breast mitogens. In {{addition to}} steroid hormones, multiple signaling pathways input to estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) actions via posttranslational events. Protein kinases commonly activated in breast cancers phosphorylate steroid hormone receptors (SRs) and profoundly impact their activities. Methods To {{better understand the}} role of modified PRs in breast cancer, we measured total and phospho-Ser 294 PRs in 209 human breast tumors represented on 2754 individual tissue spots within a tissue microarray and assayed the regulation of this site in human tumor explants cultured ex vivo. To complement this analysis, we assayed PR target gene regulation in T 47 D luminal breast cancer models following treatment with progestin (promegestone; R 5020) and antiprogestins (mifepristone, <b>onapristone,</b> or aglepristone) in conditions under which the receptor is regulated by Lys 388 SUMOylation (K 388 intact) or is SUMO-deficient (via K 388 R mutation to mimic persistent Ser 294 phosphorylation). Selected phospho-PR-driven target genes were validated by qRT-PCR and following RUNX 2 shRNA knockdown in breast cancer cell lines. Primary and secondary mammosphere assays were performed to implicate phospho-Ser 294 PRs, epidermal growth factor signaling, and RUNX 2 in breast cancer stem cell biology. Results Phospho-Ser 294 PR species were abundant in a majority (54 %) of luminal breast tumors, and PR promoter selectivity was exquisitely sensitive to posttranslational modifications. Phospho-PR expression and target gene programs {{were significantly associated with}} invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC). Consistent with our finding that activated phospho-PRs undergo rapid ligand-dependent turnover, unique phospho-PR gene signatures were most prevalent in breast tumors clinically designated as PR-low to PR-null (luminal B) and included gene sets associated with cancer stem cell biology (HER 2, PAX 2, AHR, AR, RUNX). Validation studies demonstrated a requirement for RUNX 2 in the regulation of selected phospho-PR target genes (SLC 37 A 2). In vitro mammosphere formation assays support a role for phospho-Ser 294 -PRs via growth factor (EGF) signaling as well as RUNX 2 as potent drivers of breast cancer stem cell fate. Conclusions We conclude that PR Ser 294 phosphorylation is a common event in breast cancer progression that is required to maintain breast cancer stem cell fate, in part via cooperation with growth factor-initiated signaling pathways and key phospho-PR target genes including SLC 37 A 2 and RUNX 2. Clinical measurement of phosphorylated PRs should be considered a useful marker of breast tumor stem cell potential. Alternatively, unique phospho-PR target gene sets may provide useful tools with which to identify patients likely to respond to selective PR modulators that block PR Ser 294 phosphorylation as part of rational combination (i. e., with antiestrogens) endocrine therapies designed to durably block breast cancer recurrence...|$|E
