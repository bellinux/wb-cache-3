Based on this development, it is timely to systematically review this emerging field of research and, in particular, the field’s contribution to shared knowledge <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>flipped</b> or inverted classroom phenomenon. By conducting a systematic review, our interest has been to explore the focus of the most-cited research and how research <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>flipped</b> or inverted classroom approach and movement as a field of interest is developing within the educational sector.
