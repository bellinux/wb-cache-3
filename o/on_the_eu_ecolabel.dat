Their scopes can range from single villages to worldwide or from single activities to entire destinations; and they may include voluntary codes, awards, accreditation and certification schemes. However, the eco-labels are a controversial topic in tourism as {{the degree to which they}} affect tourists’ planning processes and corporate environmental performance is largely unknown. This chapter mainly addresses the perception issue about the main difficulties and advantages driven by the adoption of the voluntary scheme based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>EU</b> <b>Ecolabel</b> Regulation for the environmental certification of the product group ‘tourist accommodation service’.

40|$|To date, only a {{few studies}} have {{investigated}} the attitude of companies towards the EU Ecolabel. This article intends to provide an updated portrait of what are the main motivations that push companies to use the EU Ecolabel, the benefits that companies perceive as deriving from it and the barriers that companies perceive as hindering uptake. In order to answer to these research questions, we have used the data collected by the empirical survey <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>EU</b> <b>Ecolabel</b> that ran from April to July 2014. Evidence emerging from the survey shows that companies deem that the EU Ecolabel added-value lies in it being a useful “showcase” tool of their eco-innovation efforts, potentially able to close the information gap with the market (made of consumers above all, but also retailers and public procurers) about their products and services’ environmental performance. However, there is evidence throughout the study that, although the EU Ecolabel brings some market rewards, these are fewer than those expected by companies when they first decide to apply for the EU Ecolabel. This is linked to the lack of awareness of the EU Ecolabel by consumers and to the insufficient and inadequate promotion and support granted by public institutions...|$|E

40|$|The {{support of}} <b>the</b> <b>EU</b> <b>Ecolabel</b> has proven very limited among the Danish fashion companies. This project has {{therefore}} decided to explore which actors and factors {{can influence the}} diffusion of <b>the</b> <b>EU</b> <b>Ecolabel</b> in <b>the</b> Danish fashion production. Implicit lies in this {{an exploration of the}} demands that an implementation of <b>the</b> <b>EU</b> <b>Ecolabel</b> criteria put <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Danish fashion companies, and what the reasons are for the lack of support from the industry. The empirical framework in this project is put together by literature studies and qualitative interviews from key actors. The theoretical foundation consists of Frank Geels' theory of socio-technical systems, communication from a system theoretical perspective based on Niklas Luhmann, governance structures of production chains by Gary Gereffi and Jeremy Hall's theory of environmental improvements in product chains. From our study we are able to conclude that the criteria of <b>the</b> <b>EU</b> <b>Ecolabel</b> require a transition of the dominating socio-technical system in <b>the</b> industry, focusing <b>on</b> supportive capacity building. It is concluded that an implementation of <b>the</b> <b>EU</b> <b>Ecolabel</b> is possible but that the fashion companies lack incentive to use the label. A pressure from f(actors) in the socio-technical system, either on landscape or niche level, is essential to increase the diffusion of <b>the</b> <b>EU</b> <b>Ecolabel.</b> Demands <b>on</b> partners, transparency in product chains and access to the necessary capacity are some of the key (f) actors that the study concludes have an influence <b>on</b> <b>the</b> diffusion...|$|R
40|$|Among the {{existing}} voluntary initiatives that a business may implement to contribute {{directly and indirectly}} to the efficient use {{of natural resources and}} to the environmental protection, formal certification schemes concerning products or services are the ones that may guarantee a defined framework for an official recognition of the environmental commitment to continuous and sustainable improvement. The introduction of <b>the</b> <b>EU</b> <b>Ecolabel,</b> aimed to promote products (and, successively, also tourism services) with reduced negative environmental impacts, was intended both to propose to the market a common reference standard for the European State members and to ensure credibility of a voluntary label based on a public recognition scheme among customers and other stakeholders.

40|$|Abstract. Marble is a financially {{important}} and highly versatile material used extensively in construction, decoration and art. The marble industry however is generated with low production efficiency, high waste material generation, high production costs and overall lack of sustainable resources management. A step towards improving the {{energy efficiency and}} environmental performance of the marble sector would be the adoption of ecological schemes that are already into force both at national and international levels. The most commonly used schemes are Environmental Management Systems that are focused <b>on</b> <b>the</b> general environmental performance of the enterprise, such as <b>the</b> <b>EU</b> EMAS (Eco-Management and Audit Scheme) and the international EN ISO 14001 : 2004 standard and ecolabelling schemes, such as <b>the</b> <b>EU</b> <b>Ecolabel,</b> focusing <b>on</b> specific products or services. The present work aims to provide a concise summary of the technical requirements and procedures for obtaining such environmental certificates, assess {{the current state of}} the art in terms of environmental performance of a typical marble plant and enhance the ecological awareness of the sector. A detailed analysis of the technical requirements for achieving EMAS III registration and obtaining <b>the</b> <b>EU</b> <b>Ecolabel</b> for hard floor coverings is presented and the potential for a typical SME marble industry for meeting the above requirements is quantified. Possible measures that may improve the overall environmental impact are proposed. It is further shown that the process of meeting the necessary criteria for obtaining the above certificates will also lead to the adoption of best engineering practices and the production of high added value products...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} ‘environmental consumption’ helps in {{developing}} {{an interest in}} eco-labels. This is a shift away from traditional command and control measures imposed by governments towards market governance which is a self-regulatory new environmental policy instrument, eco-labelling. Taken into consideration of this eco-labels potentiality to attain sustainability, various eco-labelling schemes have been introduced since early 90 ’s. Ecolabels is a voluntary labelling systems for food and consumer products. They are a form of sustainability measurement directed at consumers, intended {{to make it easy}} to take environmental concerns into account when shopping. Some labels quantify pollution or energy consumption by way of index scores or units of measurement; others simply assert compliance with a set of practices or minimum requirements for sustainability or reduction of harm to <b>the</b> environment. <b>The</b> <b>EU</b> <b>Ecolabel</b> is a voluntary product label. It was established in 1992 to encourage businesses to market products and services that meet high standards of environmental performance and quality. The labels are awarded according to environmental criteria set by the member states of <b>the</b> <b>EU</b> with involvement of industry and consumer and environmental NGOs European Commission of Environment. These criteria cover the whole life cycle of a product, from the extraction of raw materials, through manufacture, distribution, use and disposal of the product.

40|$|This {{technical}} report {{is aimed at}} providing a sound base to the revision process of <b>the</b> <b>EU</b> <b>Ecolabel</b> criteria for Soil improvers and Growing Media. Currently, separate sets of <b>EU</b> <b>Ecolabel</b> criteria exist for Soil improvers (Decision 2006 / 799 /EC) and Growing media (Decision 2007 / 64 /EC). The revision process spanned both product groups; thus common criteria for both Soil improvers and Growing media are developed, only distinguishing between technical product characteristics where necessary. Another objective of this revision is addressing the possibility to broaden the current scope to the product mulch, {{as it has been}} identified as a differentiated sub-product within the product group 'soil improvers'. To achieve those objectives, a Preliminary Report was produced together with the first version of this {{technical report}} as a working document. Hence, this document was developed to undergo the stakeholder consultation, which is crucial to come up with criteria adapted to the market reality while being able to select the best environmental performance products available <b>on</b> <b>the</b> market. After an extensive stakeholder's consultation process, this current version of the Technical Report supporting the draft criteria for growing media, soil improvers and mulch, constitutes the support of the criteria set voted positive by the Regulatory Committee.
