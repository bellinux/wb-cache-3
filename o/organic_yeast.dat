40|$|Abstract: The {{effects of}} adding {{different}} sources {{and levels of}} selenium on performance, thyroid function and antioxidant status in stressed broiler chickens were evaluated. Stress was induced by supplementation with 20 mg/kg Corticosterone (CORT) in basal diet. Total 144 Avian broilers were used for 2 weeks from 14 days of age, which were randomly distributed to 6 groups. One of these groups was fed with basal diets and the remaining with basal diet supplemented with CORT. Meanwhile, diets used in CORT groups were supplemented with 0, 0. 1 or 0. 4 mg/kg sodium selenite or yeast selenium, respectively. The results showed that dietary CORT resulted in significant suppression of growth and thyroid function, increase in creatine kinase activity and uric acid concentration in serum, indicating that CORT induced stress of broilers. In addition, the balance between pro-oxidants and antioxidants was disturbed by CORT administration, resulting in oxidative injury in the body. Supplementation of dietary selenium improved feed efficiency, promoted conversion of thyroxine (T 4) to triiodothyronine (T 3), minimized the changes of blood biochemical parameters; furthermore, it elevated antioxidases activities and decreased lipid peroxidation products in stressed broilers. The effects of adding 0. 4 mg/kg selenium were better than 0. 1 mg/kg. Although {{there was no significant}} difference between two selenium sources, it was conclude that high level of inorganic or organic selenium was able to attenuate stress and oxidative injury due to exogenous CORT administration, especially <b>organic</b> <b>yeast</b> selenium...|$|E

Furthermore, the production of hydrolytic extracellular enzymes active at low temperatures allows consumption of available carbon sources. Beyond their ecological importance, interest in psychrophilic yeasts has increased because of their biotechnological potential and industrial uses. Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids have beneficial effects on human health, and antifreeze proteins are attractive for food industries to maintain texture in food preserved at low temperatures. Furthermore, extracellular cold-active enzymes display unusual substrate specificities with higher catalytic efficiency at low temperatures than their mesophilic counterparts, making them attractive for industrial processes requiring high enzymatic activity at low temperatures.

Serum selenium concentrations were measured before intervention. Findings On average 145 different microRNAs out of 172 were detected per sample. In the PCA plots two clusters could be identified indicating significant difference in microRNA expression between the two groups. The pre-treatment expression of the microRNAs did not differ between active treatment and the placebo groups. When comparing the post- treatment microRNAs in the active and the placebo groups, 70 microRNAs exhibited significant differences in expression, also after adjustment for multiple measurements. For the 20 microRNAs with the greatest difference in expression the difference was {{up to more than}} 4 fold and with a P-value that were less than 4. 4 e(- 8). Conclusions Significant differences were found in expression of more than 100 different microRNAs with up to 4 fold differences {{as a result of the}} intervention of selenium and coenzyme Q 10 combined. The changes in microRNA could be a part of mechanisms underlying the clinical effects earlier reported that reduced cardiovascular mortality, gave better cardiac function, and showed less signs of inflammation and oxdative stress following the intervention. However, more research is needed to understand biological mechanisms of the protective effects of selenium and Q 10 supplementation.

40|$|Selenium and {{coenzyme}} Q 10 {{is essential}} for important cellular functions. A low selenium intake is reported from many European countries, and the endogenous coenzyme Q 10 production is decreasing in the body with increasing age. Supplementation with selenium and coenzyme Q 10 in elderly have shown reduced cardiovascular mortality and reduced levels of markers of inflammation. However, microRNA analyses could give important information on the mechanisms behind the clinical effects of supplementation. Out of the 443 healthy elderly participants that were given supplementation with 200 μg Se/day as <b>organic</b> selenium <b>yeast</b> tablets, and 200 mg/day of coenzyme Q 10 capsules, or placebo for 4 years, 25 participants from each group were randomized and evaluated regarding levels of microRNA.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the population dynamics ofnon-Saccharomyces biota during spontaneous fermentation of <b>organic</b> musts. Non-Saccharomyces <b>yeasts</b> were found tobe present {{at high levels}} during all fermentations. A total of 543 yeast colonies were isolated, 190 from Lysine-Medium (LM) agar, 254 from Wallerstein Laboratory Nutrient(WLN) agar and 99 from YPD agar. To estimate yeast population dynamics during spontaneous fermentation a genotypic approach was applied. PCR-RFLP of the ITS 1 - 5. 8 S rDNA-ITS 2 region and sequence determination of theD 1 /D 2 region of the 26 S rRNA gene enabled identificationof the yeast isolates at the species level. Hanseniasporauvarum, Metschnikowia fructicola and Candida zemplinina predominated, while Issatchenkia terricola, Issatchenkiaorientalis and Pichia sp. were identified with a lower frequency. Hanseniaspora uvarum, M. fructicola and C. zemplinina represented 43 %, 31 % and 11 % of the total non-Saccharomyces population isolated, respectively. Someyeast isolates were shown to be closely related toHanseniaspora spp. and Candida spp. {{on the basis of}} the D 1 /D 2 sequences. Based on those results, the coexistenceof different Hanseniaspora and Pichia species in grape musts was supposed, and their complete identification was achieved using additional molecular markers. Moreover,strain typing and differentiation was carried out by RAPD-PCR. High strain polymorphisms were observed in thedifferent species. For some strains, appreciable properties were demonstrated both in vitro by the API-ZYM test and in must. In must microvinification some strains showedgood fermentation performances, low production of acetic acid and a partial capability to degrade malic acid. [ [...] . ...|$|R

Submerged cultivations {{were carried out}} at 30 ºC and 200 rpm in growth media containing 30 g wheat bran/L as main carbon source and either yeast extract, ammonium sulfate, sodium nitrate or urea, as nitrogen sources; in all cases it was used a fixed molar carbon to molar nitrogen concentration of 10. 3. The use of poor nitrogen sources favored the accumulation of xylanase, &# 946;-xylosidase and ferulic acid esterase to a peak concentrations of 44, 880; 640 and 118 U/L, respectively, for sodium nitrate and of 34, 580, 685 and 170 U/L, respectively, for urea. However, the highest &# 946;-glucosidase accumulation of 10, 470 U/L was observed when the rich <b>organic</b> nitrogen source <b>yeast</b> extract was used. The maxima accumulation of filter paper activity, xylanase, &# 946;-xylosidase, ferulic acid esterase and &# 946;-glucosidase by A. awamori 2 B. 361 U 2 / 1 was compared to that produced by Trichoderma reesei Rut-C 30. The level of &# 946;-glucosidase was over 17 -fold higher for the Aspergillus strain, whereas the levels of xylanase and &# 946;-xylosidase were over 2 -fold higher.

40|$|Membrane {{is usually}} subject to fouling by various organic foulants, such as yeast, protein and sodium {{alginate}} during filtration. Backwashing {{is a common}} practice to reduce membrane fouling. It is essential to evaluate the effects of backwashing on fouling in order to optimize operational parameters. In this experiment, poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) membranes were used to filter organic foulants from suspensions in a dead-end stirred cell. Three types of <b>organic</b> foulants including <b>yeast,</b> protein and sodium alginate which were stained with fluorescent dyes before filtration were used with different combinations in the experiments. After filtration, the PVDF membrane was backwashed. Consequently, a stack of images, instrumental data and sample data were captured from the fouling layers on the PVDF membrane surface using confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) and its associated image acquisition software LAS AF. Then, {{the quality of the}} images was enhanced for better visualization and a set of quantitative fouling data were derived by using the software code developed by the project team at Deakin University. This collection contains raw image data of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) membrane’s fouling layer when three types of organic foulants present, which are captured by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and its software, and the instrumental and sample metadata, the processed image data and the geometrical structure properties of the fouling layer. By comparing with the same membrane without backwashing, the efficiency of backwashing was computed. This data collection would be useful to evaluate the backwashing efficiency of PVDF membrane in order to optimize frequency and operational conditions of backwashing by membrane materials researchers and water researchers...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} organic and {{inorganic}} sources of selenium (Se) {{on measures of}} Se status of mares and their foals, Se concentrations of colostrum and milk, and indices of immune function of foals was studied. Twenty late-gestation Standardbred mares {{were randomly assigned to}} one of two groups. All mares received an identical balanced ration, except for the source of supplementary Se: one group received <b>organic</b> Se (Se <b>yeast)</b> and the other group received inorganic Se (sodium selenite), fed to deliver 0. 3 mg/kg supplementary Se based on total ration dry matter. Mares received the experimental diet from 2 months before estimated due date until 1 month after foaling. Source of Se did not affect Se concentrations in maternal plasma, red blood cells, colostrum, or milk. At 1 month of age, foals from mares fed organic Se had higher red blood cell Se concentration than foals from mares fed inorganic Se (P <. 05). Measures of immunity included serum immunoglobulin G concentration, lymphocyte proliferation in response to concanavalin A, and relative cytokine gene expression of stimulated lymphocytes (interferon gamma IFNγ], interleukin IL]- 2, IL- 5, IL- 10, tumor necrosis factor alpha TNFα]) and neutrophils (IL- 1, IL- 6, IL- 8, IL- 12, TNFα). Relative gene expression of IL- 2, TNFα, and IFNγ by foal lymphocytes was associated with the source of Se supplementation provided to the mares. We conclude that the source of dietary Se provided to mares may influence the immune function of foals at 1 month of age through changes in relative gene expression of certain lymphocyte cytokines.

The cells were irregular cocci, 0. 8 - 1. 5 µm in diameter. Growth was observed between 50 and 90 °C (opt. 80 °C), pH 5. 0 and 8. 0 (opt. pH 7. 0), 1 and 7 % (w/v) sea salts (Sigma, opt. 3 %), 1 and 4 % (w/v) NaCl (opt. 3 %) and 0. 1 and 80 MPa (opt. 30 MPa). The minimum doubling time was 66 min at 30 MPa and 80 °C. The isolate was an obligate chemoorganoheterotroph, capable of utilizing complex organic compounds and <b>organic</b> acids including <b>yeast</b> extract, peptone, tryptone, casein, starch, casamino acids, citrate, lactate, acetate, fumarate, propanoate and pyruvate for growth. It was strictly anaerobic and facultatively dependent on elemental sulfur or sulfate as electron acceptors, but did not reduce sulfite, thiosulfate, Fe(III) or nitrate. The presence of elemental sulfur enhanced growth. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 43. 6 ± 1 mol%. 16 S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that the closest relative of the isolated organism was Palaeococcus ferrophilus DMJT (95. 7 % 16 S rRNA gene sequence similarity). On the basis of its physiological properties and phylogenetic analyses, the isolate is considered to represent a novel species, for which the name Palaeococcus pacificus sp. nov. is proposed.
