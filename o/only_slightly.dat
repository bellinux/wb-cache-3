5|$|Mars's average {{distance}} from the Sun is roughly , and its orbital period is 687 (Earth) days. The solar day (or sol) on Mars is <b>only</b> <b>slightly</b> longer than an Earth day: 24 hours, 39 minutes, and 35.244 seconds. A Martian year is equal to 1.8809 Earth years, or 1 year, 320 days, and 18.2 hours.|$|E

5|$|On 2 September 2003, a Cessna {{aircraft}} overshot {{the runway}} {{and landed in}} the sea after an emergency landing caused by loss of power immediately after take-off. Two {{of the people on}} board were uninjured and the third injured <b>only</b> <b>slightly.</b>|$|E

5|$|The basic {{hardware}} requirements to install Windows 10 {{are the same}} as for Windows 8.1 and Windows 8, and <b>only</b> <b>slightly</b> higher than Windows 7. The 64-bit versions require a CPU that supports certain instructions. Devices with low storage capacity must provide a USB flash drive or SD card with sufficient storage for temporary files during upgrades.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} of Shepton Mallet was fairly stable through the 19th {{century and the}} first part of the 20th: in 1801, it was 5,104 and in 1851 <b>only</b> <b>slightly</b> more at 5,117, although by 1901 it had swelled to 5,446, before falling back to 5,260 in 1951. By 2001, it had increased significantly to 8,981.|$|E
5|$|The {{system is}} among the most compact known; the orbits of planets b - f would easily fit inside the orbit of Mercury, with g <b>only</b> <b>slightly</b> outside it. Despite this close packing of the orbits, {{dynamical}} integrations indicate the system {{has the potential to be}} stable on a time scale of billions of years.|$|E

30|$|Different {{experiments}} {{have shown that}} isotopic ratios of food <b>only</b> change <b>slightly</b> during cooking [88 – 92], and that food crust isotope ratios do not change during burial [89], or <b>only</b> change <b>slightly</b> [93]. Stable isotope measurements can therefore be useful for roughly distinguishing different food sources. It is important here not only to measure δ 13 C values, but also δ 15 N values, as “terrestrial” δ 13 C values can {{be the result of}} mixed marine and freshwater resources [61].|$|R
5|$|With the {{presence}} of various orbiters, landers, and rovers, {{it is possible to}} practice astronomy from Mars. Although Mars's moon Phobos appears about one-third the angular diameter of the full moon on Earth, Deimos appears more or less star-like, looking <b>only</b> <b>slightly</b> brighter than Venus does from Earth.|$|E
5|$|A {{promethium}} atom has 61 electrons, {{arranged in}} the configuration 4f56s2. In forming compounds, the atom loses its two outermost electrons {{and one of}} the 4f-electrons, which belongs to an open subshell. The element's atomic radius is the third largest among all the lanthanides but is <b>only</b> <b>slightly</b> greater than those of the neighboring elements. It is the only exception to the general trend of the contraction of the atoms with increase of atomic radius (caused by the lanthanide contraction) that is not caused by the filled (or half-filled) 4f-subshell.|$|E
5|$|Attempting to {{list the}} {{equipment}} available to the DRC's land forces is difficult; most figures are unreliable estimates based on known items delivered in the past. The IISS's Military Balance 2007 and Orbat.com's Concise World Armies 2005 give <b>only</b> <b>slightly</b> differing figures however (the figures below are from the IISS Military Balance 2007). Much of the Army's equipment is non-operational due to insufficient maintenance—in 2002 only 20 percent of the Army's armoured vehicles were estimated as being serviceable.|$|E

5|$|Body adaptations, {{especially}} a paddle-like tail, help banded sea kraits to swim. These adaptations {{are also found}} in more distantly related sea snakes (Hydrophiinae) because of convergent evolution. However, because {{of the differences in}} motion between crawling and swimming, these same adaptations impede the snake's terrestrial motion. On dry land, a banded sea krait can still move, but, on average, at <b>only</b> <b>slightly</b> more than a fifth of its swimming speed. In contrast, most other non-Laticauda sea snakes are virtually stranded on dry land.|$|E
5|$|Boron carbide and cubic {{boron nitride}} powders {{are widely used}} as abrasives. Boron nitride is a {{material}} isoelectronic to carbon. Similar to carbon, it has both hexagonal (soft graphite-like h-BN) and cubic (hard, diamond-like c-BN) forms. h-BN {{is used as a}} high temperature component and lubricant. c-BN, also known under commercial name borazon, is a superior abrasive. Its hardness is <b>only</b> <b>slightly</b> smaller than, but its chemical stability is superior, to that of diamond. Heterodiamond (also called BCN) is another diamond-like boron compound.|$|E
5|$|Calabria was {{designed}} for use in Italy's colonial empire, rather than the earlier vessels intended as fleet scouts. As such, her steel hull was sheathed with wood and then a layer of zinc {{to protect it from}} fouling during lengthy tours in the overseas colonies. Additionally, she was equipped with less powerful though more efficient engines than the earlier cruisers. The ship was otherwise similar to preceding designs like the Regioni class, having a displacement <b>only</b> <b>slightly</b> lower and a nearly identical gun battery.|$|E

5|$|Construction of Evstafi {{began on}} 13 July 1904, {{well before the}} formal keel-laying {{ceremony}} on 23 November 1904. Progress was relatively quick, despite the disruptions caused by the 1905 Revolution, and she was launched on 3 November 1906. Fitting-out, however, was considerably delayed {{by a number of}} changes made as the navy digested the lessons of the Russo-Japanese War and she was not completed until 28 May 1911. Shortly after completion she ran aground off the Romanian port of Constanţa in October 1911, but was <b>only</b> <b>slightly</b> damaged.|$|E
5|$|From Jupiter's surface—or rather, {{from just}} above its cloudtops—Amalthea would appear very bright, shining with a {{magnitude}} of −4.7, {{similar to that}} of Venus from Earth. At only 8 arcminutes across, its disc would be barely discernible. Amalthea's orbital period is <b>only</b> <b>slightly</b> longer than its parent planet's day (about 20% in this case), which means it would cross Jupiter's sky very slowly. The time between moonrise and moonset would be over 29 hours.|$|E
5|$|In summary, {{the main}} {{competencies}} of the Tagora were its spacious cabin (though {{it was not}} class-leading), its comfortable seating, its fuel economy (in 2.2 GLS form) {{and the size of}} its luggage compartment (572 litres). But the fact that a car launched in 1974, the Volvo 244 GLE, could offer better seats, disc brakes all round, better headlights, better ventilation and better handling for <b>only</b> <b>slightly</b> more than Talbot was charging for their car indicated that the Tagora had come to market with a vehicle that was uncompetitive in too many major respects.|$|E
