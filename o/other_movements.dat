Tashkent was photographed at San Francisco {{at some point during the}} war, but most of her <b>other</b> <b>movements</b> are not known. However, in August 1945, Tashkent delivered troops and cargo in support of the Soviet invasions of Japanese-held Manchuria, Korea, Sakhalin, and the Kurile Islands. After the war's end, Tashkent returned to merchant operation with FESCO through 1966, when she was transferred to North Korea for use as a fish processing facility. The former Tashkent was scrapped in 1969.|$|E

Pursuing her de-demonization policy, in October 2011, Marine Le Pen, as new president of the National Front, joined the European Alliance for Freedom (EAF). The EAF is a pan-European sovereigntist platform founded late 2010 that is recognized by the European Parliament. The EAF has individual members linked to the Austrian Freedom Party of Heinz-Christian Strache, the UK Independence Party, and <b>other</b> <b>movements</b> such as the Sweden Democrats, Vlaams Belang (Belgian Flanders), Germany (Bürger in Wut), and Slovakia (Slovak National Party).|$|E
5|$|The women's {{movement}} {{during the}} Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), like <b>other</b> <b>movements</b> in this period, came {{to depend on}} the cult of Mao Zedong. During the Cultural Revolution, the women’s movement was viewed as bourgeois and reactionary since it had originated in the West. The ACWF shutdown in 1968 because it was considered anti-revolutionary. The party argued that the women’s movement needed to be completely immersed in the revolutionary movement instead of harboring its own agenda. The offices of the ACWF were occupied by the army and many of the female cadres who had been involved with the women’s movement were sent to labor camps in the countryside. Women’s work ceased to function until the arrest of the Gang of Four in 1976.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the mid-1980s}} {{and the first}} decade of the 2000s, the {{prevailing}} interpretation of how hadrosaurids processed their food followed the model put forward in 1984 by David B. Weishampel. He proposed that the structure of the skull permitted motion between bones that resulted in backward and forward motion of the lower jaw, and outward bowing of the tooth-bearing bones of the upper jaw when the mouth was closed. The teeth of the upper jaw would grind against the teeth of the lower jaw like rasps, processing plant material trapped between them. Such a motion would parallel the effects of mastication in mammals, although accomplishing the effects in a completely different way. Work in the early 2000s has challenged the Weishampel model. A study published in 2008 by Casey Holliday and Lawrence Witmer found that ornithopods like Edmontosaurus lacked the types of skull joints seen in those modern animals that are known to have kinetic skulls (skulls that permit motion between their constituent bones), such as squamates and birds. They proposed that joints that had been interpreted as permitting movement in dinosaur skulls were actually cartilaginous growth zones. An important piece of evidence for Weishampel's model is the orientation of scratches on the teeth, showing the direction of jaw action. <b>Other</b> <b>movements</b> could produce similar scratches though, such as movement of the bones of the two halves of the lower jaw. Not all models have been scrutinized under present techniques. Vincent Williams and colleagues (2009) published additional work on hadrosaurid tooth microwear. They found four classes of scratches on Edmontosaurus teeth. The most common class was interpreted as resulting from an oblique motion, not a simple up-down or front-back motion, which is consistent with the Weishampel model. This motion is thought to have been the primary motion for grinding food. Two scratch classes were interpreted as resulting from forward or backward movement of the jaws. The other class was variable and probably resulted from opening the jaws. The combination of movements is more complex than had been previously predicted.|$|E

40|$|Many of {{handicapped}} children have difficulties in acquiring the motor abilities, {{and this is}} one of the important problems in educational practice for {{handicapped children}}. There are various aspects such as language, movement, emotion and socialization, which are functionally related with each other in the process of child development. It's important for us to grasp the children's motor development in relation to various other functions. In the previous research, we examined the motor development of mentally retarded children in relation to the development of visual perception. In the present research, we attempted to examine the development of motor functions and ability on the imitative expression of <b>others</b> <b>movement,</b> and this attempt was made to clarify the problems of motor development in mentally retarded children. Tests of abilities on imitative expression of <b>other's</b> <b>movement</b> and motor abilities were given to sixteen mentally retarded children, and Kyoto Child Guidance Clinic Infant Development Test was administered to each subject in order to estimate his developmental age. They ranged at development stages from the 1 dimensional operation to the linear transformation forming. The results indicated that abilities on imitative expression of <b>other's</b> <b>movement</b> advanced with progress on developmental ages, and there was the definite trend in their advances, moreover, there were signifcant correlations between development of motor functions and abilities on imitative expression of <b>other's</b> <b>movement...</b>|$|R
5|$|In 1956, MD32 was {{extended}} east on Guilford Road from US1 to the Howard Anne Arundel county line at Annapolis Junction. The state highway was relocated to its present alignment from Glenelg to Clarksville between 1961 and 1964, bypassing Ten Oaks Road. MD32 was expanded to a four-lane divided highway in West Friendship when its interchange with I-70 was reconstructed as a diamond interchange in 1973. MD32 {{was extended}} east into Anne Arundel County in 1969 when the designation {{was extended to}} {{just east of the}} BaltimoreWashington Parkway on the edge of Fort George G. Meade. The first two sections of what would become the Patuxent Freeway opened in 1972. A short section of divided highway opened from just west of Oakland Mills Road in Guilford to a turnaround just west of Vollmerhausen Road that included MD32's modern interchange with I-95. The other section was a two-lane road from MD175 in Odenton northeast along Sappington Station Road and then east along the current alignments of MD32 and I-97 to MD178 just east of I-97 Exit 5 in Crownsville. The eastern section, which from 1972 to 1977 was one of the three disjoint sections of mainline MD32 between Crownsville and Taneytown, included an interchange with MD3 in Millersville. As of 1978, MD32's interchange with the BaltimoreWashington Parkway was a partial cloverleaf interchange with four ramps {{on the north side of}} MD32due to the state highway closely paralleling the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad's spur to the military baseand a fifth ramp from the northbound Parkway to eastbound MD32. The MD3 interchange included the ramps to and from MD32 in the direction of Fort Meade plus a ramp from westbound MD32 to northbound MD3. All <b>other</b> <b>movements</b> were made via MD178 or Millersville Road.|$|E
5|$|The two routes {{continue}} {{to the southeast}} through business areas, meeting CR 575 and a ramp to the Atlantic City Expressway. CR 575 turns east to follow US 40/US 322. The road enters Egg Harbor Township, and CR 575 splits from US 40/US 322 by turning to the south. The route passes more wooded residential and commercial areas, {{as well as the}} Storybook Land amusement park, before intersecting CR 563. US 40/US 322 forms a concurrency with that route and passes through a business district that includes the Harbor Square shopping center. CR 563 splits from the road by continuing southeast and the Black Horse Pike heads east interchange with the Garden State Parkway. The only direct ramp present is between the Black Horse Pike westbound and the Garden State Parkway northbound; all <b>other</b> <b>movements</b> are provided by CR 563. Past here, US 40/US 322 continues east past more businesses, crossing CR 651 before entering Pleasantville. In Pleasantville, the road crosses US 9, where the name changes to Verona Avenue. Upon crossing CR 585, the Black Horse Pike continues past residences as an undivided road, crossing back into Egg Harbor Township. The road passes more businesses, closely paralleling the Atlantic City Expressway before entering Atlantic City. Here, the name becomes Albany Avenue and it comes to a pair of ramps that provide access to and from the Black Horse Pike eastbound and the Atlantic City Expressway westbound. US 40/US 322 enters marshland, crossing the Great Thorofare onto Great Island before passing over the Beach Thorofare. Past this bridge, the road passes between businesses to the west and the closed Bader Field airport and the abandoned Bernie Robbins Stadium to the east. US 40/US 322 crosses the Inside Thorofare on a drawbridge and continues as a county maintained road to its end at Atlantic Avenue and Pacific Avenue, one block from the boardwalk. Through New Jersey, US 40 serves as a main road connecting Atlantic City with points south along Interstate 95, such as Baltimore and Washington, D.C.|$|E

5000|$|The tic-like {{movements}} and {{swelling of the}} third ventricle associated with bobble-head doll syndrome are {{similar to that of}} <b>other</b> <b>movement</b> disorders caused by diseases of the corpus callosum and aforementioned basal ganglia. Because of the swelling, added pressure is applied to these formations causing their basic functions to be disturbed. Through pneumoencephalographic studies of patients with Parkinson’s, Huntington's, and dystonia musculorum deformans, it was discovered that, along with patients with bobble-head doll syndrome, a statistically significant swelling of the third ventricle existed. Thus, researchers believe that the connection between bobble-head doll syndrome and <b>other</b> <b>movement</b> disorders is that, in both, the movements are not caused by a particular lesion, but rather a hindrance of multiple neuronal structures or pathways. In the case of bobble-head doll syndrome, the disturbance is related to those structures proximal to the third ventricle.
