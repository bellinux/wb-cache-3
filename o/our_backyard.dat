500|$|Marlo Campbell, {{a writer}} for Uptown, said that the play critiques {{masculine}} egotism and Western heroism through the character of Jason. Lana Michelin of the Red Deer Advocate disagreed, stating that Jason never lapses into self-importance. Aaron Krogman, who portrayed Jason and the pimp in the play's premiere, said, [...] "there is a thin line between Jason and the pimp...both characters are struggling with power and how they use it." [...] Waldschmidt stated that the doubling of this role is intended to remind audiences that there are Canadians who are perpetrators of human trafficking and that it [...] "is not just somebody else's problem over there...but that it's us, and it's in our country and in <b>our</b> <b>backyard</b> and in our suburbs". Jason has in this way been considered an everyman. Chris Quandt, who portrayed Jason at the United States premiere, {{said that he and}} his fellow cast members greatly appreciated the fact that Kooman incorporated into the play the facts that taking down one brothel often leaves space for another brothel to be established soon afterwards, and that child sex tourism exists because there is a demand for it.|$|E
500|$|When Madonna {{started work}} on her fourth studio album, Like a Prayer, she was in an {{emotional}} state of mind following her divorce from Sean Penn, her 30th birthday and unfavorable reviews for her acting endeavors. She had certain personal matters on her mind that she thought could be the musical direction of the album. As Madonna considered her alternatives, producers Patrick Leonard and Stephen Bray experimented with instrumental tracks and musical ideas for her consideration. One day, while recording of the title track {{was going on at}} Jonny Yuma Studios, producer Patrick Leonard had to pick up his daughter Jessie from school and, since his wife was out of town, had to bring her back to the studio. Madonna, who was initially angry with Leonard for his late arrival, struck up a rapport with Jessie. She commented: [...] "It was like as if I was my mother and [...] was me. We were playing in <b>our</b> <b>backyard</b> again." [...] Witnessing their connection, Leonard approached Madonna with a song he had written for his daughter, titled [...] "Dear Jessie". Madonna changed some of the lyrics and agreed to record the track for Like a Prayer; it was finished within the next three days.|$|E

He was vice-captain of the Australian Under–17, before scoring a first grade century for the University club in Hobart. [...] "He was always the {{smallest}} one playing cricket," [...] Paine's father John said. [...] "We lived in a fairly quiet street and we lived right next to the beach [...] so they used to play a fair bit of beach cricket. We used to have a cricket pitch in <b>our</b> <b>backyard</b> which was the driveway and the next-door neighbours had a turf wicket which the boys used to roll and mow and do all that sort of stuff. So he had to learn from an early age I suppose to be a bit stronger and a bit more competitive." [...] As a junior, Paine was a talented Australian rules player—considered good enough to make the Australian Football League (AFL)—and his brother Nick, one of four siblings, plays in the Tasmanian Football League with the Clarence Football Club.

50|$|In {{common with}} many of ITV's {{educational}} children's programmes of the era, Allsorts - first screened in January 1986 - was originally intended to run for only one series while ITV's flagship children's series, Rainbow, was off air that year. The first series ran until July, but despite moderate popularity in its first run, Granada decided not to renew the series and instead initially opted in favour of Allsorts predecessor, the pre-school orientated series <b>Our</b> <b>Backyard</b> (which had already been on air since August 1984), largely because the latter could be made more quickly and cheaply. But after failing to attract enough viewers in its third run in late 1986, <b>Our</b> <b>Backyard</b> was cancelled and Allsorts was brought back for a second series in January 1987, and proved so popular with both pre-schoolers and older children that it was subsequently recommissioned for a further seven series before it was eventually dropped in 1995.|$|E

They moved into television when the BBC gave them a regular slot on the children's show Vision On. They moved to Granada TV for the series Daisy, Daisy where they performed black theatre segments and the in-show puppets Wriggle and Splodge, and eventually pitched a new idea for a further series Once Upon a Time, which featured a short black-theatre puppetry sequence accompanying a story with a similar theme. The show ran for several years, first with presenter Peter Davison, later with singer Mark Wynter; it transmuted into Sounds like a Story.

40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. December 2013. Major: Natural Resources Science and Management. Advisor: Gary Johnson. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vii, 88 pages. Trees {{are an integral}} part of the urban landscape, from <b>our</b> <b>backyards</b> to lining <b>our</b> streets. Media outlets cover disease and invasive pest issues in urban forests, but there is little mention regarding infrastructure and planting challenges facing urban foresters. Research has shown urban trees have numerous benefits for society, many of which are not realized until trees have grown to a significant size. However, many trees are removed every year due to their negative impacts on urban infrastructure before their benefits are fully realized. Trunk flares and roots can lift sidewalks, and tree canopies often interfere with buildings or overhead utilities. This study's intent was to create biological growth models for two tree genera that are commonly used as street trees in Minnesota landscapes with the goal of reducing infrastructure damage as a result of conflicts with urban trees. The models will provide urban foresters and urban planners with a practical method for predicting trunk diameter at ground line and crown width in order to improve urban infrastructure planning that involves hardscapes and trees...|$|R
