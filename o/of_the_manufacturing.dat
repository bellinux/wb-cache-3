5|$|By {{the end of}} 1968, the {{prospective}} purchases from the six countries amounted to 1,500 aircraft.

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s, the {{regional}} policy of bringing businesses into disadvantaged areas of Wales through financial incentives had proven very successful in diversifying the industrial economy. This policy, begun in 1934, was enhanced by the construction of industrial estates and improvements in transport communications, most notably the M4 motorway linking south Wales directly to London. It was believed that the foundations for stable economic growth had been firmly established in Wales during this period; but this view was shown to be wildly optimistic after the recession of the early 1980s saw the collapse of much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>manufacturing</b> base that had been built over the preceding forty years.|$|E
5|$|Local weavers {{specialised}} in {{the production}} of kersey, a hardwearing and inexpensive woollen fabric that was often used for military uniforms; by the 16thcentury Halifax and the surrounding Calder Valley was the largest producer of the material in England.

5|$|Redevelopment is {{underway}} {{for some of}} the abandoned industrial facilities, with the abandoned Oliver Corporation buildings being the most recent example of reclaimed property. The city also faced programs with large swaths of vacant housing after the decline <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>manufacturing</b> industry. In 2013, 1,347 homes were vacant or abandoned. However, the city created the Vacant and Abandoned Properties Initiative in February 2013, which aimed to take care of 1,000 vacant or abandoned homes in 1,000 days, either through demolition, repairing, or some other satisfactory means. As of June 2015, 828 homes have been demolished, repaired, or handed off to partners.|$|E
5|$|Specific {{instances}} include removing {{of parts}} from the mould {{immediately after the}} parts are created, as well as applying machine vision systems. A robot grips the part after the ejector pins have been extended to free the part from the mould. It then moves them into either a holding location or directly onto an inspection system. The choice depends upon the type of product, {{as well as the}} general layout <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>manufacturing</b> equipment. Vision systems mounted on robots have greatly enhanced quality control for insert moulded parts. A mobile robot can more precisely determine the placement accuracy of the metal component, and inspect faster than a human can.|$|E

While Clough was in office, around $1billion was spent on expanding and improving the campus. These projects include the construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Manufacturing</b> Related Disciplines Complex, 10th and Home, Tech Square, The Biomedical Complex, the completion and subsequent renovations of several west campus dorms, the Student Center renovation, the expanded 5th Street Bridge, the Georgia Tech Aquatic Center's renovation into the CRC, the new Health Center, the Klaus Advanced Computing Building, the Molecular Science and Engineering Building, and the Nanotechnology Research Center.|$|E

5|$|There {{is a local}} {{perception}} that Shepton Mallet has been in economic decline for some time. Some 350 manufacturing jobs {{were lost in the}} late 1990s and early years of the 21st century. However, the District Council asserts that, despite the loss <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>manufacturing</b> jobs on which Shepton Mallet has been historically dependent, more jobs in distribution, business services and public administration, health, education, quarrying, construction and hi-tech services (from companies such as the ISP Easynet) have been created, thereby creating a more balanced economy. In 2001, there were slightly more jobs in the town than economically active people, resulting in a small in-flow of workers.|$|E
5|$|In 1970, {{the model}} M400 was released, which {{contained}} 35 notes (G–F) and a removable tape frame. It sold over 1,800 units. By the early 1970s, hundreds {{of the instruments}} were assembled and sold by EMI under exclusive licence. Following a financial and trademark dispute through a US distribution agreement, the Mellotron name was acquired by American-based Sound Sales. Streetly-manufactured instruments after 1976 were sold under the name Novatron. The American Mellotron distributor, Sound Sales, produced their own Mellotron model, the 4-Track, in the early 1980s. At the same time Streetly Electronics produced a road-cased version of the 400– the T550 Novatron. By the mid-1980s, both Sound Sales and Streetly Electronics suffered severe financial setbacks, losing their market to synthesizers and solid-state electronic samplers, which rendered the Mellotron essentially extinct. The company folded in 1986, and Les Bradley threw most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>manufacturing</b> equipment into a skip. From 1963 until Streetly's closure, around 2,500 units had been built.|$|E
