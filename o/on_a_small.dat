The Macdonalds were devout Roman Catholics as well as ardent Liberal Party supporters.|$|E

5|$|As {{well as the}} {{television}} show, Live and Kicking launched a music CD, composed of the best music that artists had sung live on the programme. A video game called Live and Kicking: Showmaker was also created, where the user could combine elements of the show {{to create their own}} television production <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> scale. A monthly magazine was also produced, though towards the end of Live & Kickings production, the sales of the magazine dropped significantly, reflecting its loss of viewers.|$|E
5|$|Bad weather {{resulted}} in a decline of anti-shipping operations, and before long the Ju 87 groups began re-deploying to Poland, {{as part of the}} concealed build-up for Operation Barbarossa. By spring 1941, only St.G 1 with 30 Ju 87s remained facing the United Kingdom. Operations <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> scale continued throughout the winter months into March. Targets included ships at sea, the Thames Estuary, the Chatham naval dockyard and Dover and night-bomber sorties made over the Channel. These attacks were resumed the following winter.|$|E
5|$|Boycott's {{regiment}} {{transferred to}} Belfast {{shortly after his}} arrival. Six months later, it was sent to Newry before marching to Dublin, where it remained for a year. In 1852, Boycott married Anne Dunne in StPaul's Church, Arran Quay, Dublin. He was ill between August 1851 and February 1852 and sold his commission the following year, but decided to remain in Ireland. He leased a farm in County Tipperary, where he acted as a landlord <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> scale.|$|E

5|$|Bromine pentafluoride (BrF5) {{was first}} {{synthesised}} in 1930. It is produced {{on a large}} scale by direct reaction of bromine with excess fluorine at temperatures higher than 150°C, and <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> scale by the fluorination of potassium bromide at 25°C. It is a very vigorous fluorinating agent, although chlorine trifluoride is still more violent. Bromine pentafluoride explodes on reaction with water and fluorinates silicates at 450°C.|$|E
5|$|C.maenas is fished <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> {{scale in}} the {{north-east}} Atlantic Ocean, with approximately 1200tonnes being caught annually, mostly in France and the United Kingdom.

5|$|Current Electoral College rules {{effectively}} force {{candidates to}} focus disproportionately <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> percentage of pivotal swing states, while sidelining the rest. A study by FairVote {{reported that the}} 2004 candidates devoted three quarters of their peak season campaign resources to just five states, while the other 45 states received very little attention. The report also stated that 18 states received no candidate visits and no TV advertising. This means that swing state issues receive more attention, while issues important to other states are largely ignored.|$|E

5|$|During the engagement, 12 militiamen {{were killed}} by Band warriors while making a stand <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> hill. The {{remainder}} of the militia fled back to Dixon's Ferry. Citizens erected a monument in 1901 in Stillman Valley, Illinois commemorating the battle. A 2006 article corroborates that militia volunteer Abraham Lincoln {{was present at the}} battleground's burials; sources agree about little else. Investigation continues in the early 21st century about facts of the skirmish.|$|E

The award winner's name, work title, award year and award category are etched <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> plaque on the base or on the plexiglass itself. A small cash stipend is awarded to winners in the Best Novel category. The cost of the awards is met through individual donations and fundraising events.|$|E
5|$|Famine {{is shaped}} by {{generally}} two theories. The first is FAD, Food Availability Decline. This {{is the result of}} a drought, a war, or some other drastic change to the agricultural system. This is the natural cause for famine. The other theory deals primarily with the population’s ability to access or become entitled to food. In this case, food power makes itself known <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> scale, as opposing political forces in Sudan compete for the votes of the people by instigating or encouraging the famine.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{prior to}} the Minoan eruption, {{the walls of the}} caldera formed a nearly {{continuous}} ring of islands with the only entrance lying between Thera and the tiny island of Aspronisi. This cataclysmic eruption was centered <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> island just north of the existing island of Nea Kameni in the centre of the then-existing caldera. The northern part of the caldera was refilled by the volcanic ash and lava, then collapsed again.|$|E
5|$|In 1659, {{shortly before}} the {{restoration}} of the monarchy, the Protector's Council was abolished.

5|$|In 1979 Colalucci {{undertook}} {{a series of}} experiments to discover the right approach {{for the restoration of}} the frescoes of the Sistine Chapel. The investigation began by testing small areas of the wall fresco, Conflict over the Body of Moses by Matteo de Lecce, which had similar physical and chemical attributes to the painting techniques employed on Michelangelo's frescoes. Trials to find the right solvents were continued <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> portion of the Eleazar and Matthan lunette.|$|E

5|$|Lobster {{fishing was}} done <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> scale {{especially}} in Cardigan Bay, but was reserved almost exclusively for export.

Cockle picking still happens in the Gower peninsula, but due to the difficulty in getting licences and reduced yield, villages near the Carmarthen Bay no longer gather them.|$|E
