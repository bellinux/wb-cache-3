40|$|The rocket based {{combined}} cycle (RBCC) powered single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) {{reusable launch vehicle}} {{has the potential to}} significantly reduce the total cost per pound for orbital payload missions. To validate overall system performance, a flight demonstration must be performed. This paper presents an overview of the first phase of a flight demonstration program for the GTX SSTO vehicle concept. Phase 1 will validate the propulsion performance of the vehicle configuration over the supersonic and hypersonic air- breathing portions of the trajectory. The focus and goal of Phase 1 is to demonstrate the integration and performance of the propulsion system flowpath with the vehicle aerodynamics over the air-breathing trajectory. This demonstrator vehicle will have dual mode ramjetkcramjets, which include the inlet, combustor, and nozzle with geometrically scaled aerodynamic surface <b>outer</b> <b>mold</b> <b>lines</b> (OML) defining the forebody, boundary layer diverter, wings, and tail. The primary objective {{of this study is to}} demon- strate propulsion system performance and operability including the ram to scram transition, as well as to validate vehicle aerodynamics and propulsion airframe integration. To minimize overall risk and develop ment cost the effort will incorporate proven materials, use existing turbomachinery in the propellant delivery systems, launch from an existing unmanned remote launch facility, and use basic vehicle recovery techniques to minimize control and landing requirements.

40|$|A {{synoptic}} of programmatic {{and technical}} lessons {{learned in the}} development of aerothermodynamic data bases for the X- 33 and X- 34 programs is presented in general terms and {{from the perspective of the}} NASA Langley Research Center Aerothermodynamics Branch. The format used is that of the "aerothermodynamic chain," the links of which are personnel, facilities, models/test articles, instrumentation, test techniques, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Because the aerodynamic data bases upon which the X- 33 and X- 34 vehicles will fly are almost exclusively from wind tunnel testing, as opposed to CFD, the primary focus of the lessons learned is on ground-based testing. The period corresponding to the development of X- 33 and X- 34 aerothermodynamic data bases was challenging, since a number of other such programs (e. g., X- 38, X- 43) competed for resources at a time of downsizing of personnel, facilities, etc., outsourcing, and role changes as NASA Centers served as subcontractors to industry. The impact of this changing environment is embedded in the lessons learned. From a technical perspective, the relatively long times to design and fabricate metallic force and moment models, delays in delivery of models, and a lack of quality assurance to determine the fidelity of model <b>outer</b> <b>mold</b> <b>lines</b> (OML) prior to wind tunnel testing had a major negative impact on the programs. On the positive side, the application of phosphor thermography to obtain global, quantitative heating distributions on rapidly fabricated ceramic models revolutionized the aerothermodynamic optimization of vehicle OMLs, control surfaces, etc. Vehicle designers were provided with aeroheating information prior to, or in conjunction with, aerodynamic information early in the program, thereby allowing trades to be made with both sets of input; in the past only aerodynamic data were available as input. Programmatically, failure to include transonic aerodynamic wind tunnel tests early in the assessment phase led to delays in the optimization phase, as OMLs required modification to provide adequate transonic aerodynamic performance without sacrificing subsonic and hypersonic performance. Funding schedules for industry, based on technical milestones, also presented challenges to aerothermodynamics seeking optimum flying characteristics across the subsonic to hypersonic speed regimes and minimum aeroheating. This paper is concluded with a brief discussion of enhancements in ground-based testing/CFD capabilities necessary to partially/fully satisfy future requirements...|$|R
40|$|The {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} (CFD) comparisons being presented are compared {{to each other and}} to wind tunnel (WT) data on the baseline TCA. Some of the CFD computations were done prior to the tests and others later. Only force data (CL vs CD) from CFD will be presented as part of this report. The WT data presented comes from the testing of the baseline TCA in the Langley Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel (UPWT), Test Section # 2. There are 2 sets of wind tunnel data being presented: one from test 1671 of model 2 a (flapped wing) and the other from test 1679 of model 2 b (solid wing). Most of the plots show only one run from each of the WT tests per configuration. But many repeat runs were taken during the tests. The WT repeat runs showed an uncertainty in the drag of +/- 0. 5 count. There were times when the uncertainty in drag was better, +/- 0. 25 count. Test 1671 data was of forces and pressures measured from model 2 a. The wing had cutouts for installing various leading and trailing edge flaps at lower Mach numbers. The internal duct of the nacelles are not designed and fabricated as defined in the <b>outer</b> <b>mold</b> <b>lines</b> (OML) iges file. The internal duct was fabricated such that a linear transition occurs from the inlet to exhaust. Whereas, the iges definition has a constant area internal duct that quickly transitions from the inlet to exhaust cross sectional shape. The nacelle internal duct was fabricated, the way described, to save time and money. The variation in the cross sectional area is less than 1 % from the iges definition. The nacelles were also installed with and without fairings. Fairings are defined as the build up of the nacelles on the upper wing surface so that the nacelles poke through the upper surface as defined in the OML iges file. Test 1679 data was of forces measured from model 2 a and 2 b. The wing for model 2 b was a solid wing. The nacelles were built the same way as for model 2 a, except for the nacelle base pressure installation. The nacelles were only tested with the fairings for model 2 a and 2 b during test 1679...|$|R

Raytheon claims the new warhead has the performance of the BLU-109 penetrating bomb, despite being one-quarter of its weight. In December 2016, the Obama administration blocked a transfer of Paveway IV missiles to Saudi Arabia because of concerns about civilian casualties which officials put down to poor targeting.|$|E

Ignition, fuel throttling, and engine operation were wrung out over a range of expected flight conditions. After a delay of two months to modify flight hardware based on ground test findings, the first powered vehicle, FFV1, was launched without incident, propelled to speeds of 5300 ft/s at 63000 ft altitude, roughly Mach 5.5. Over 140 inlet, combustor, and vehicle <b>outer</b> <b>mold</b> <b>line</b> pressure, temperatures, and vehicle accelerations as well as fuel pressure, timing feedback, and power systems monitoring were recorded.

50|$|The White Knight carrier {{airplane}} {{was designed}} around the twin afterburning J-85 engines, which {{were selected for}} their availability and low cost. The aircraft was a completely new independent design. White Knight and SpaceShipOne shared the same forward fuselage <b>outer</b> <b>mold</b> <b>line</b> (OML) to reduce development costs and with the original intent to allow for White Knight {{to act as a}} flying simulator for training SpaceShipOne pilots. White Knight first flew on August 1, 2002. The flight was aborted shortly after takeoff due to a problem with the outboard wing spoilers. These trailing edge spoilers were designed to greatly increase the glide slope so that the White Knight vehicle could act as a flying simulator for training of SpaceShipOne pilots. During the first flight, the mechanical over-center torque was insufficient to maintain the spoilers in the closed position. The spoilers deployed into the free stream and began a limit cycle forcing the pilot (Mike Melvill) to abort. The spoilers were subsequently disabled completely and the desire for a steep glide slope matching SpaceShipOne was abandoned.|$|E
50|$|The first {{surrogate}} vehicle, SPV1, {{was launched}} aboard an unguided Terrier/Improved Orion two-stage solid rocket motor stack from Wallops Island on October 18, 2003, approximately 12 months after program initiation. This had the exact <b>outer</b> <b>mold</b> <b>line</b> of the eventual shrouded scramjet payload and contained full onboard instrumentation and telemetry suites. The vehicle was boosted to approximately 4600 ft/s and 52000 ft altitude, {{where it was}} deployed to free-flight, deployed its shroud at high dynamic pressure, and flew an un-powered trajectory to splashdown. All on-board subsystems worked flawlessly. The boost stage however inserted the payload at lower than desired flight speed, altitude, and flight path angle.The second surrogate vehicle, SPV2 was launched aboard the identical booster stack from Wallops Island on April 16, 2004, approximately {{six months after the}} first launch. After making slight trajectory corrections to account for launch rail effects, higher than anticipated drag, and actual booster performance, the payload was inserted nominally above 5200 ft/s and 61000 ft altitude. The full complement of subsystems were again proven out in flight on this successful flight test. The results of these two flight tests are summarized in a technical paper AIAA-2005-3297, presented at the 13th International Space Planes and Hypersonics Systems and Technologies Conference (see http://www.aiaa.org)in Capua, Italy.|$|E

40|$|After our {{previous}} {{investigation of a}} bronze eight-belled rattle (bronze disk with eight prongs and bells), we investigated bronze bell finials {{with the aim of}} analyzing the bronze casting techniques used in ancient Korea. The finials were allegedly excavated in Jukdongri, Gyeongju and are housed in the Gyeongju National Museum. Eight-belled rattles and bell finials were both made in pairs, but because our research of an eight-belled rattle examined only one of the pair, it could not fully analyze the casting techniques employed to make two identical bronze products in ancient Korea On reflection, we examined both of the pair of finials. The similarities and differences observed between the two finials drew following inferences concerning the casting techniques. 1. The incised patterns on the two finials match each other. This indicates that the pair was cast from two different molds formed from a same model (master form). 2.
