500|$|In a 1992 {{interview}} about Shiloh, Naylor said: [...] "Like a patchwork quilt, a novel {{is made up}} <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> happened to me and things I have heard or read about, all mixed up with imaginings." [...] Naylor's characters are frequently based on herself and her two sons. She penned the novel following an excursion with her husband, Rex, to visit their friends, Frank and Trudy Madden, in West Virginia. Naylor and Rex were strolling along a river when they discovered a dog in the grass following them. Dejected and frightened, the dog was [...] "the saddest, most mistreated-looking beagle I'd ever seen", Naylor later said. Because the dog frequently shuddered and slunk forward on her belly, Naylor suspected she had been abused. On a whim, Naylor whistled and the dog rushed forward, lapping Naylor's face. Tailing them {{until they reached the}} Maddens' house, the beagle remained under a tree, her paws cushioning her head during the drizzly afternoon. Naylor cried during her and her husband's trip home that night.|$|E
500|$|Gaga further {{elaborated}} on {{the inspiration}} behind the song as walking towards the light force {{in her life}} and peering towards the devil in the back, while clutching onto {{the source of the}} light. [...] "I sing about what a holy fool I am, and that although moments in my life are so cruel and relationships can be so cruel I’m still in love with Judas. I still go back again to those evil things," [...] she said. During her interview with Google, Gaga added to the song's meaning as honoring one's inner darkness in order to bring themselves into the light. One has to learn to forgive themselves in order to move on with their life. With Popjustice she clarified that she has a lot <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> haunted her from her past, including her choices, men, drug abuse, being afraid to go back to New York, confronting old romances. Hence [...] "Judas" [...] represented something that was not good for her, something she could not escape. Gaga said: [...] "I keep going {{back and forth between the}} darkness and the light in order to understand who I am." ...|$|E
500|$|The series {{features}} numerous song covers sung onscreen by the characters. Ryan Murphy {{was responsible}} for selecting all of the songs used, and {{has said that he}} strove to maintain a balance between chart hits and show tunes: [...] "I want there to be something for everybody in every episode. That's a tricky mix, but that's very important—the balancing of that." [...] According to Murphy, the song choices are integral to script development, [...] "Each episode has a theme at its core. After I write the script, I will choose songs that help to move the story along." [...] In a 2010 interview with Allison Kugel, Chris Colfer noted that [...] "there have been a couple of times when I have gone to Ryan Murphy (Glee creator) and told him a couple <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> happened to me, and then he writes it into the show. Or he'll ask me what song I would want to sing, in this situation or in that situation. I don’t think any of us directly try to give input on the character or on the storyline, but they definitely steal things from us." [...] For the second season, a shift toward using more Top 40 songs was seen, in an effort to appeal more to the 18–49 demographic.|$|E

2500|$|Baggott got {{the idea}} to write Farewell to Reality and become a science activist when {{watching}} the BBC program What is Reality. In his opinion, the program started out well, but became what he calls [...] "fairy tale physics" [...] when it included interviews with theoretical physicists who talked about such ideas as multiverse, superstring theory, and supersymmetry. These topics, according to Baggott, are fascinating to read about and are an entertaining way to make documentaries, sell books, or spend time at parties, but are [...] "abstracted, theoretical speculation without any kind of empirical foundation" [...] and [...] "not science". Farewell to Reality is Baggott's attempt to counteract the [...] "fuzzy science theory" [...] and advocate for evidence and facts. Baggott states, [...] "When you start asking 'Do {{we live in a}} hologram?' Then you are crossing into metaphysics, and you are heading down the path of allowing all kinds <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> no evidence to back it up, like creationism." ...|$|E
2500|$|The first {{question}} arises {{in the dialogue}} Theaetetus, where Plato identifies thought or opinion with talk or discourse (logos). The second question {{is a result of}} Plato's theory of Forms. Forms are not things in the ordinary sense, nor strictly ideas in the mind, but they correspond to what philosophers later called universals, namely an abstract entity common to each set <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> the same name. In both the Republic and the Sophist, Plato suggests that the necessary connection between the assumptions of a valid argument and its conclusion corresponds to a necessary connection between [...] "forms". The third question is about definition. Many of Plato's dialogues concern the search for a definition of some important concept (justice, truth, the Good), and it is likely that Plato was impressed by the importance of definition in mathematics. What underlies every definition is a Platonic Form, the common nature present in different particular things. Thus, a definition reflects the ultimate object of understanding, and is the foundation of all valid inference. This had a great influence on Plato's student Aristotle, in particular Aristotle's notion of the essence of a thing.|$|E

60|$|These, {{says the}} Hâjî, are mere sounds. He would not assert Verba gignunt verba, but Verba gignunt res, a step further.

5000|$|Prus defines [...] "discovery" [...] as [...] "the {{finding out}} <b>of</b> a <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> existed and exists in nature, but which was {{previously}} unknown to people"; and [...] "invention" [...] as [...] "the making <b>of</b> a <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> not previously existed, and which nature itself cannot make." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Prince, {{they seem}} to be holy words to which I have little right to hearken.

60|$|They {{then read}} again {{in another part}} of the records of the house, where it was showed how willing their Lord was to receive into His favour any, even any, though they in time past had offered great affronts to His person and proceedings.

60|$|He {{stood at}} the window {{watching}} Ferrand start into the world again; then looked back at his own comfortable room, with the number <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> accumulated somehow--the photographs of countless friends, the old arm-chairs, the stock of coloured pipes.

60|$|Mr. Gribble sat in {{his small}} front parlour {{in a state of}} angry amazement. It was half-past six and there was no Mrs. Gribble; worse still, there was no tea.

60|$|In time {{a curious}} thing, not yet {{adequately}} explained, fell out, for {{the extension of}} the franchise in 1867 and now in 1884 resulted in a reversal of the apparent law <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> ruled our political parties through the epoch <b>that</b> Mr. Gladstone <b>has</b> just sketched.
