50|$|During Te Kooti's War, {{in early}} June 1869 Te Kooti and about 150 of his {{supporters}} moved towards Lake Taupo {{in the center of}} the North Island. At <b>Opepe,</b> just short of Taupo, they ran into party of fourteen Militia, who were camped in the abandoned village.Nine of the militia were killed with no loss to Te Kooti. One of the men, who was drying his uniform, escaped completely naked across rough country in mid-winter, and was awarded the New Zealand Medal. A military stockade was built at <b>Opepe</b> in 1869 but closed in 1885. The township thrived for several years in the late 19th century.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ōpepe</b> was a {{settlement}} in New Zealand, a few miles southwest of Taupo. It {{was the scene of}} a skirmish between European militia and Maori rebels on 7 June 1869 in which nine members of the militia were killed.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, General Lundula {{established}} a staff consisting of officers mostly from Orientale and Kasaï. His {{three most important}} commanders were Major Loso (in charge of the military police), Major <b>Opepe,</b> and Colonel Camille Yangara. In order to bolster his army, Lundula increased recruitment efforts among the unemployed youth in Stanleyville and younger members of the Mouvement National Congolais.|$|E
50|$|Today {{there is}} a very small {{cemetery}} on the Napier-Taupo road with five graves maintained by the Ministry for Culture and Heritage. Two of the graves hold the bodies of the nine members of the Bay of Plenty Cavalry who were killed on 7 June 1869 by Te Kooti's advance guard. The other three are the graves of later settlers. New Zealand State Highway 5 passes through <b>Opepe</b> today. Little remains of the settlement.|$|E
50|$|Te Kooti {{turned again}} towards Taupo, {{travelling}} in {{a convoy of}} about 200 people, 50 of them mounted. He seized prisoners and livestock at the settlement of Heruiwi, before launching a daring raid on an encampment of volunteer cavalry at <b>Opepe,</b> 20 km west of Lake Taupo, on 7 June, killing nine soldiers and capturing all their arms and horses. He destroyed the pā of two hapu who had earlier refused to give him refuge or assistance, then arrived on 10 June at Tauranga, {{at the southern end}} of Lake Taupo, occupying the settlement for more than a week before moving to Moerangi, southwest of the lake, taking more prisoners as he travelled.|$|E
40|$|The {{insulation}} or dielectric {{circuit of}} electrical machines constitutes their weakest member, as copperand steel, the other chief constituents can withstand elevated temperatures. It is therefore imperative to qualifyelectrical insulating materials therm ally by determining their insulation class. In this paper, tw elve samplevarieties of Nigerian wood species–Abeza, Afara, Agbagum, Aper, Bomba, Danta, Gameliana, Iroko,Mahogany, Obeche, <b>Opepe,</b> and White wood, were experimented with {{to determine their}} insulationclassification. The samples were cut into definite dimensions and weighed. Each wood species was made intotwo samples; one sample was left in its ordinary state while the other was impregnated with an insulatingvarnish. Both samples w ere subjected to a heat-run in a sealed industrial oven. The insulation resistance of eachsample was measured at regular temperature intervals until the sample burns out. The measured values ofweight, insulation resistance and temperature are shown in tables. Curves were plotted to show the variationof insulation resistance with temperature. From the experiments, eight of the wood species- Danta, Afara,Obeche, Mahogany, <b>Opepe,</b> Abeza, A per and Iroko {{can be used for}} class H insulation while the other fourspecies- Gameliana, Agbagum, Bomba and White wood are suitable for class F insulation...|$|E
40|$|Eleven well-preserved Holocene tephras occur {{interbedded}} with peat in the Kaipo Lagoon bog in Urewera National Park, North Island. They {{are identified}} chiefly by their field appearance, stratigraphy, and ferromagnesian mineralogy. Glass shards from one tephra (Hinemaiaia) were analysed by electron microprobe. The tephras originate from the Taupo, Okataina, and Tongariro Volcanic Centres and, from youngest to oldest, are: Kaharoa Ash, Taupo Pumice, Mapara Tephra, Waimihia Lapilli, Hinemaiaia Tephra, Whakatane Ash, Rotoma Ash, <b>Opepe</b> Tephra, Poronui Tephra, Karapiti Tephra, and Okupata Tephra. Thirteen new radiocarbon ages were obtained on {{six of the}} tephras (old TY 2, years B. P.) : Waimihia, 3, 250 ± 70 (Wk 498), 2, 910 ± 60 (Wk 499), 3, 040 ± 50 (Wk 500); Hinemaiaia and Whakatane, 4, 490 ± 60 (Wk 496), 4, 530 ± 60 (Wk 497); Whakatane, 4, 860 ± 70 (Wk 501); Rotoma, 5, 440 ± 170 (Wk 493), 7, 380 ± 80 (Wk 494), 7, 560 ± 100 (Wk 495) (Wk 493 - 495 are all considered anomalously young); <b>Opepe,</b> 8, 7 lO ± 80 (Wk 492); Poronui, 10, 160 ± 130 (Wk 351), 9, 960 ± 90 (Wk 352), 9, 560 ± 80 (Wk 491). Estimated ages, assuming constant sedimentation rates, for Karapiti Tephra and Okupata Tephra are 10, 100 and 10, 300 years, respectively. Two peat horizons below the Okupata Tephra were dated at (old TY 2) 10, 600 ± 90 years B. P. (Wk 263) and 11, 500 ± 80 years B. P. (Wk 264) and date the initial growth of the Kaipo Lagoon bog. Peat accumulation rates have been slow (average 0. 19 mm/year) but variable. The identification and dating of the tephras at Kaipo extends their known distribution in eastern North Island, and improves their potential usefulness as isochronous stratigraphic marker units...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Ambient {{temperatures}} in tropical countries across the equatorial belt are adversely high. Thus the operating temperatures of electrical machines {{in these countries}} are uncomfortably high even when the machines operate at rated load. Nigeria as a tropical and developing country has {{had to contend with}} this unfavorable thermal condition for electrical machines. Most of the drive motors in N igeria are imported and many of them come with class B insulation. In this paper, eight sample varieties of Nigerian wood species-Mahogany, Obeche, Iroko, Afara, Danta, <b>Opepe,</b> Abeza, and Aper and the two most commonly imported class B insulating materials- Fiber glass and Leatheroid are experimented with to compare their ability to maintain insulation integrity at higher temperatures. Impregnated samples of the eight wood species and samples of leatheroid and fiberglass were subjected to a heat-run in a sealed industrial oven. The insulation resistance of each sample was measured at regular temperature intervals until the sample burns out. Tables show the values of weight, insulation resistance, and temperature. The results show that at the class B limiting temperature of 130 ºC, Leatheroid had an insulation resistance of 6 MS while that of fiberglass was 8 MS. The eight wood samples had insulation resistance above 30 MS. At the higher temperature of 150 ºC, the insulation resistances of Leatheroid and Fiber glass collapsed to 1 MS and 1. 4 MS respectively while that of the wood species was a minimum of 15 MS.

At a much elevated temperature of 170 ºC, both Leatheroid and Fiber glass were burntbut the insulation resistances of the eight wood species were up to 8 MΩ. Thus, the wood species exhibitedhigher insulation integrity at higher temperatures than Leatheroid and Fiberglass. These wood species throughsome careful chemical synthesis could be made more malleable and consequently serve as alternative andcheaper machine insulating materials to the imported Leatheroid and Fiberglass...|$|E
40|$|The {{stratigraphy}} and geomorphology of Lake Maratoto and its surrounds {{were investigated}} {{as part of}} a programme of paleolimnological studies based on sediment cores from lakes in northern North Island. Changes in the lake and catchment were inferred from variations in sediment character, the correlation and timing being determined from distinctive tephra layers in the sediments and by radiocarbon dating. Nineteen new C-l 4 dates, on gyttja or peat, are reported (old T½, years B. P,) : 11 on tephras (Mamaku Ash 6830 ± 90. Wk 227; Rotoma Ash 8370 ± 90, Wk 522; 8350 ± 100, Wk 523; <b>Opepe</b> Tephra 9370 ± 210, Wk 230; Mangamate Tephra 9700 ± 140, Wk 23 l; 10000 ± 120, Wk 232; Waiohau Ash 12 200 ± 230, Wk 233; 12500 ± 190, Wk 234; 12450 ± 200, Wk 5 l 5; 12300 ± 190,Wk 516; RotoruaAsh 13450 ± 120, Wk 511); 5 on the deposition of Hinuera Formation alluvium (16 300 ± 250, Wk 239; 16 900 ± 470, Wk 240; 17050 ± 200, Wk 358; 16200 + 360 - 340, Wk 509; 15 850 ± 130, Wk 510); and 3 on basal peat of the Rukuhia bog (10 250 ± 90, Wk 114; 15200 ± 130, Wk 534; 10600 ± 90, Wk 553). Lake Maratoto originated c. 17 000 years ago when a small valley was dammed by volcanogenic alluvium (Hinuera Formation). From c. 17 000 to c. 14 000 years ago the lake was about 2 m deep with clear water. Marginal peat first developed at c. 15000 years ago, reducing the area of the lake by about one-half by c. 13 000 years ago. Lake area then expanded, possibly because of marginal erosion and/or oxidation of the peat, to its maximum size at the present day. The adjacent Rukuhia peat bog grew rapidly from c. 11 000 years ago and is now 8 m thick immediately {{to the west of the}} lake. As a result of this growth, the lake became dystrophic and deepened (3. 5 m at c. 7000 years ago, 6. 4 m at c. 2000 years ago, and 7. 1 m today). The developmental history suggests that net precipitation increased at c. 15 000 years ago, increased further at c. 11 000 years ago, remaining high to c. 7000 years ago at least, but with a decline at or before c. 2000 years ago. There may have been a distinctly wetter or windier period from c. 10 000 to 9000 years ago. This interpretation is consistent with other reconstructions of postglacial climate in the Southern Hemisphere...|$|E
40|$|Tephras are {{important}} for the NZ-INTIMATE project because they link all three records comprising the composite inter-regional stratotype developed for the New Zealand climate event stratigraphy (NZ-CES). Here we firstly report new calendar ages for 24 widespread marker tephras erupted since 30, 000 calendar (cal.) years ago in New Zealand to help facilitate their use as chronostratigraphic dating tools for the NZ-CES and for other palaeoenvironmental and geological applications. The selected tephras comprise 12 rhyolitic tephras from Taupo, nine rhyolitic tephras from Okataina, one peralkaline rhyolitic tephra from Tuhua, and one andesitic tephra each from Tongariro and Egmont/Taranaki volcanic centres. Age models for the tephras were obtained using three methods: (i) 14 C-based wiggle-match dating of wood from trees killed by volcanic eruptions (these dates published previously); (ii) flexible depositional modelling of a high-resolution 14 C-dated age-depth sequence at Kaipo bog using two Bayesian-based modelling programs, Bacon and OxCal's P_Sequence function, and the IntCal 09 data set (with SH offset correction - 44 ± 17 yr); and (iii) calibration of 14 C ages using OxCal's Tau_Boundary function and the SHCal 04 and IntCal 09 data sets. Our preferred dates or calibrated ages for the 24 tephras are as follows (youngest to oldest, all mid-point or mean ages of 95 % probability ranges) : Kaharoa AD 1314 ± 12; Taupo (Unit Y) AD 232 ± 10; Mapara (Unit X) 2059 ± 118 cal. yr BP; Whakaipo (Unit V) 2800 ± 60 cal. yr BP; Waimihia (Unit S) 3401 ± 108 cal. yr BP; Stent (Unit Q) 4322 ± 112 cal. yr BP; Unit K 5111 ± 210 cal. yr BP; Whakatane 5526 ± 145 cal. yr BP; Tuhua 6577 ± 547 cal. yr BP; Mamaku 7940 ± 257 cal. yr BP; Rotoma 9423 ± 120 cal. yr BP; <b>Opepe</b> (Unit E) 9991 ± 160 cal. yr BP; Poronui (Unit C) 11, 170 ± 115 cal. yr BP; Karapiti (Unit B) 11, 460 ± 172 cal. yr BP; Okupata 11, 767 ± 192 cal. yr BP; Konini (bed b) 11, 880 ± 183 cal. yr BP; Waiohau 14, 009 ± 155 cal. yr BP; Rotorua 15, 635 ± 412 cal. yr BP; Rerewhakaaitu 17, 496 ± 462 cal. yr BP; Okareka 21, 858 ± 290 cal. yr BP; Te Rere 25, 171 ± 964 cal. yr BP; Kawakawa/Oruanui 25, 358 ± 162 cal. yr BP; Poihipi 28, 446 ± 670 cal. yr BP; and Okaia 28, 621 ± 1428 cal. yr BP. Secondly, we have re-dated the start {{and end of the}} Lateglacial cool episode (climate event NZce- 3 in the NZ-CES), previously referred to as the Lateglacial climate reversal, as defined at Kaipo bog in eastern North Island, New Zealand, using both Bacon and OxCal P_Sequence modelling with the IntCal 09 data set. The ca 1200 -yr-long cool episode, indicated by a lithostratigraphic change in the Kaipo peat sequence to grey mud with lowered carbon content, and a high-resolution pollen-derived cooling signal, began 13, 739 ± 125 cal. yr BP and ended 12, 550 ± 140 cal. yr BP (mid-point ages of the 95 % highest posterior density regions, Bacon modelling). The OxCal modelling, generating almost identical ages, confirmed these ages. The Lateglacial cool episode (ca 13. 8 - 12. 6 cal. ka BP) thus overlaps {{a large part of the}} entire Antarctic Cold Reversal chronozone (ca 14. 1 - 12. 4 cal. ka BP or ca 14. 6 - 12. 8 cal. ka BP), and an early part of the Greenland Stadial- 1 (Younger Dryas) chronozone (ca 12. 9 - 11. 7 cal. ka BP). The timing of the Lateglacial cool episode at Kaipo is broadly consistent with the latitudinal patterns in the Antarctic Cold Reversal signal suggested for the New Zealand archipelago from marine and terrestrial records, and with records from southern South America...|$|E
