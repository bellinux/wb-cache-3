Fortunato praised {{the director}} and described the Orions, saying that they [...] "move very slowly, very seductively. I would like to compare us to snakes – we like to slither and creep around, versus a human. So we’re a little sneaky. The three of us are trying to get something accomplished, and each <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>has</b> our target, so to speak, to try to manipulate them to get what we want in the end." ...|$|E
500|$|He {{wandered the}} boulevards alone, and spent what little {{money he had}} on alcohol. A series of {{embarrassing}} encounters with English visitors, or Frenchmen he had known in better days, drowned his spirit. Soon Wilde was sufficiently confined to his hotel to joke, {{on one of his}} final trips outside, [...] "My wallpaper and I are fighting a duel to the death. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>has</b> got to go." [...] On 12 October 1900 he sent a telegram to Ross: [...] "Terribly weak. Please come." [...] His moods fluctuated; Max Beerbohm relates how their mutual friend Reginald 'Reggie' Turner had found Wilde very depressed after a nightmare. [...] "I dreamt that I had died, and was supping with the dead!" [...] "I am sure", Turner replied, [...] "that you must have been the life and soul of the party." [...] Turner was {{one of the very few}} of the old circle who remained with Wilde right to the end, and was at his bedside when he died.|$|E
500|$|However, Trio members never {{claimed to}} be folksingers and were never {{comfortable}} with the label. The liner notes for the group's first album featured a quotation from Dave Guard asserting that [...] "We are not folksingers in the accepted sense of the word." [...] Guard later told journalist Richard Hadlock in Down Beat magazine: [...] "We are not students of folk music; the basic thing for us is honest and worthwhile songs that people can pick up and become involved in." [...] Nick Reynolds added in the same article: [...] "We don't collect old songs {{in the sense that}} the academic cats do... We get new tunes to look over every day. Each <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>has</b> his ears open constantly to new material or old stuff that's good." [...] Bob Shane remarked years later: [...] "To call the Kingston Trio folksingers was kind of stupid in the first place. We never called ourselves folksingers... We did folk-oriented material, but we did it amid all kinds of other stuff. But they didn't know what to call us with our instruments, so Capitol Records called us folksingers and gave us credit for starting this whole boom." ...|$|E
60|$|Strange to say, not <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> been wounded, {{while many}} {{a better man}} close beside <b>us</b> <b>had</b> met his death.|$|R
60|$|If the house, {{and every}} <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> <b>had</b> tumbled {{out into the}} river together, I could hardly have {{received}} a greater shock.|$|R

2500|$|After the Lewinsky scandal broke, Barr was {{the first}} lawmaker in either chamber to call for Clinton's resignation. During debate on the {{impeachment}} resolution on the House floor, Barr argued that Clinton's attempt to interfere with Lewinsky's testimony in the Paula Jones case endangered the Constitution. In doing so, Barr said, Clinton violated what Barr called a [...] "fundamental right" [...] of any American citizen – [...] "the unshakable right each <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>has</b> {{to walk into a}} courtroom and demand the righting of a wrong." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "It's {{horses for}} courses, skipper." [...] I told him. [...] "It's madness {{to go with}} three pace bowlers on that pitch. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>has</b> to be dropped {{if we are to}} stand a chance of winning. I'm loyal to my country, drop me if you like, you can always put {{yourself}} on as a third seamer if need be." [...] Ted discussed the matter with the other selectors and the decision was to ignore my advice, and play Len, Brian and myself. It was a farce. The pitch didn't have a blade of grass on it and I was reduced to bowling off-cutters, but I couldn't pitch them slow enough to have much effect.|$|E
2500|$|In 1938, Attlee {{opposed the}} Munich Agreement, in which Chamberlain {{negotiated}} with Hitler to give Germany the German-speaking parts of Czechoslovakia, the Sudetenland: We all feel relief that war {{has not come}} this time. Every <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>has</b> been passing through days of anxiety; we cannot, however, feel that peace has been established, but that we have nothing but an armistice {{in a state of}} war. We have been unable to go in for care-free rejoicing. We have felt {{that we are in the}} midst of a tragedy. We have felt humiliation. This has not been a victory for reason and humanity. It has been a victory for brute force. At every stage of the proceedings there have been time limits laid down by the owner and ruler of armed force. The terms have not been terms negotiated; they have been terms laid down as ultimata. We have seen to-day a gallant, civilised and democratic people betrayed and handed over to a ruthless despotism. We have seen something more. We have seen the cause of democracy, which is, in our view, the cause of civilisation and humanity, receive a terrible defeat. ... The events of these last few days constitute one of the greatest diplomatic defeats that this country and France have ever sustained. There can be no doubt that it is a tremendous victory for Herr Hitler. Without firing a shot, by the mere display of military force, he has achieved a dominating position in Europe which Germany failed to win after four years of war. He has overturned the balance of power in Europe. He has destroyed the last fortress of democracy in Eastern Europe which stood in the way of his ambition. He has opened his way to the food, the oil and the resources which he requires in order to consolidate his military power, and he has successfully defeated and reduced to impotence the forces that might have stood against the rule of violence.|$|E
6000|$|... "On the whole, I think <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> better go," [...] Charnock {{answered}} with some dryness. [...] "If you don't mind, I'll get off to-morrow." ...|$|R
6000|$|Lucy Coulson sighed. [...] "Harford," [...] she said, {{dropping}} {{her voice a}} trifle, [...] "you must try not to blame me. If <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> been richer--I, at least, can't help remembering." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then {{there must}} be from a hundred to {{a hundred and fifty}} of them,' Charley said. 'I wonder what papa will do! <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> better ride off at once and fetch him.' ...|$|R
60|$|The ledger of the Almighty is {{strictly}} kept, and every <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>has</b> {{the balance of}} his operations paid over {{to him at the}} end of every minute of his existence.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{only thing}} against your plan, Hiram, {{is that which}} you {{yourself}} have confessed," [...] Archie said thoughtfully. [...] "The difficulty of concealing {{the mouth of the}} tunnel after <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>has</b> made his way through it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And I {{am proud}} when the least unselfish nature has from first to last done the most unselfish things. No <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>has</b> ever given {{up so much}} as Tom, and I am sure he will be happy in it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|When <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> written anything, {{he would}} {{read it to}} the other, {{and when he had}} {{finished}} he would say, [...] "Now, {{tell me what you think}} of it--frankly and as a friend." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'If only <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> a pocket,' Peter said, 'we {{could carry}} her in it.' However, they had {{set off in}} such a hurry that there was not a pocket between the four of them.|$|R
60|$|It {{had been}} a prosperous season. Not <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> cause for complaint, nor <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the eighty-five deck {{passengers}} either. All had done well, and all were {{looking forward to a}} rest-off and a good time in Papeete.|$|R
6000|$|... 'What's {{the use of}} worrying? You know I should {{ruin your}} life, and you'd ruin mine, as things are now. You {{remember}} what you said when you were so angry {{that day in the}} Park? <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>has</b> to be broken.|$|E

6000|$|... "It {{has been}} splendid!" [...] Sankey said enthusiastically. [...] "We have {{defeated}} a force twice {{as strong as}} ourselves, have killed or badly wounded eighteen of them, {{and you may be}} sure that of those that got away several must have been hit. Not <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>has</b> a scratch." ...|$|E
60|$|KNOX. Now, dont take on like that, Amelia. You know I {{always give}} in {{to you that you}} were right about religion. But <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> to think <b>of</b> other things, or we'd have starved, we and the child.|$|R
5000|$|In 1981 he and Norwegian Inge Simonsen {{intentionally}} {{crossed the}} finish line together holding hands {{in a time of}} 2:11:48.

6000|$|... "Wonderful," [...] {{the latter}} {{replied with a}} laugh. [...] "A stag came along and every <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> a shot at it, and {{each and every one}} is ready to take oath that he hit it, so that every one is satisfied. Don't you call that luck?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By the Virgin!" [...] exclaimed Fabrizio hotly, [...] "I'll swear your {{conclusions}} were wrong. In all Italy it {{was known}} to no man beyond us six that you were to meet us here, and with my hand upon the Gospels I could swear that not <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>has</b> breathed of it." ...|$|E
60|$|Now Bridge, {{sleeping}} {{the sleep}} of utter exhaustion that the boom of a cannon {{might not have}} disturbed, did that inexplicable thing which every <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>has</b> done a hundred times in our lives. He awakened, with a start, out of a sound sleep, though no disturbing noise had reached his ears.|$|E
60|$|It is only {{in sleep}} that true {{imagination}} ever stirs within us. Awake, we never imagine anything; we merely alter, vary, or transpose. We give another twist to the kaleidoscope {{of the things we}} see around us, and obtain another pattern; but not <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>has</b> ever added one tiniest piece of new glass to the toy.|$|E
6000|$|... "The Archduchess has her," [...] he said, [...] "and if only <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> {{the ghost}} <b>of</b> a legal claim upon the child our {{difficulties}} would end. She is an unscrupulous woman, {{but there are}} things which even she dare not do. What are they doing over there?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{are both}} mighty sore, {{because they had}} to leave Oak Hall in disgrace," [...] said Luke. [...] "Every <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> better keep his eye peeled, for they'll make trouble if they get half a chance." [...] And then the bell rang for dinner and the boys went downstairs.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should think}} not," [...] Matteo said. [...] "I had never dreamt of {{doing more than}} {{recovering}} the Pluto, and when you first talked about that, it seemed almost like madness. I don't think <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> the slightest belief {{in the possibility of}} the thing, when you first proposed it." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{appeared}} to ask herself if she could, {{and then to}} decide in the negative. [...] "If I don't understand you in any way, of course I don't in that. Put it, at any rate," [...] she now rather wearily quavered, [...] "that <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>has</b> as little to gain as the other. I believe you," [...] she repeated. [...] "There!" ...|$|E
6000|$|All {{this came}} out between sobs such that Mrs. Woodford could {{not attempt to}} speak, but she kept her hand on him, and at last she said, when he could hear her: [...] "Every <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>has</b> to fight with an evil spirit, and when we are not on our guard he is but too apt to take {{advantage}} of us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We hail you our saviour!" [...] {{the big man}} declaimed. [...] "Already {{the shadow}} of the gaol was {{creeping}} over us, chilling us to the very marrow. For though we be poor, yet are we all honest folk and not <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>has</b> ever suffered the indignity of prison. Nor is there one of us would survive it. But for you, my friend, it might have happened. What magic did you work?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{mind you}} don't do it again, or I {{shall have to}} take you in hand, which I shall be very sorry to do.

5|$|Pitch darkness. Every now and then, an {{explosion}} in the night. They had orders to fire on any who could not keep up.

6000|$|... "Would that <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> {{travelled}} here before!" [...] El Bakhat said. [...] "If {{we could}} but have continued our journey to-night {{we should be}} safe. Upon the desert one can travel by the stars, but the ground is getting far too broken to cross at night; we should only weary our camels in vain." ...|$|R
