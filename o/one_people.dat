5|$|Cats {{have either}} a mutualistic or {{commensal}} relationship with humans. Two main theories are given about how cats were domesticated. In <b>one,</b> <b>people</b> deliberately tamed cats {{in a process}} of artificial selection as they were useful predators of vermin. This has been criticized as implausible, because the reward for such an effort may have been too little; cats generally do not carry out commands and although they do eat rodents, other species such as ferrets or terriers may be better at controlling these pests. The alternative idea is that cats were simply tolerated by people and gradually diverged from their wild relatives through natural selection, as they adapted to hunting the vermin found around humans in towns and villages.|$|E
5|$|One {{important}} source of language change is contact and resulting diffusion of linguistic traits between languages. Language contact occurs when speakers {{of two or more}} languages or varieties interact on a regular basis. Multilingualism is likely to have been the norm throughout human history and most people in the modern world are multilingual. Before the rise of the concept of the ethno-national state, monolingualism was characteristic mainly of populations inhabiting small islands. But with the ideology that made <b>one</b> <b>people,</b> one state, and one language the most desirable political arrangement, monolingualism started to spread throughout the world. Nonetheless, there are only 250 countries in the world corresponding to some 6000 languages, which means that most countries are multilingual and most languages therefore exist in close contact with other languages.|$|E

25|$|Contrary to the {{negation}} of the diaspora view, {{the acceptance of}} Jewish communities outside Israel was postulated by those, like Simon Rawidowicz (also a Zionist), who viewed the Jews as a culture which had evolved into a new 'worldly' entity that {{had no reason to}} seek an exclusive return, either physical, emotional or spiritual to its indigenous lands, and who believed that the Jews could remain <b>one</b> <b>people</b> even outside Israel.|$|E

25|$|Ethnically, the Havasupai and the Hualapai are <b>one</b> <b>people,</b> {{although}} today, {{they are}} politically separate {{groups as the}} result of U.S. government policy. The Hualapai (Pa'a or Pai) had three subtribes: the Plateau People, Middle Mountain People and Yavapai Fighter. The subtribes were divided into seven bands, which themselves were broken up into thirteen regional bands or local groups. The local groups were composed of several extended family groups, living in small villages: The Havasupai were just the Havasooa Pa'a regional band (or local group) of the Nyav-kapai (“Eastern People”) of the Plateau People subtribe.|$|E

'Cape Muslims' were also classified as 'coloured.' They generally have Indonesian and black ancestry, as many Indonesian slaves had children with African partners. Many Griqua began to self-identify as Coloureds during the apartheid era, because {{of the benefits of}} such classification. For example, Coloureds did not have to carry a dompas (an identity document designed to limit the movements of the non-white populace), while the Griqua, who were seen as an indigenous African group, did.|$|E
25|$|The Etruscan {{language}} is imperfectly deciphered, but bilingual inscriptions found in archaeological excavations at {{the sites of}} Etruscan cities indicate the Phoenicians had trading relations with the Etruscans for centuries. The discovery in 1964 at Pyrgi in Italy of a shrine to Astarte, a popular Phoenician deity, containing three gold tablets with inscriptions in Etruscan and Phoenician, gives tangible proof of the Phoenician presence in the Italian peninsula {{at the end of}} the 6th century BC, long before the rise of Rome. These inscriptions imply a political and commercial alliance between Carthage and the Etruscan ruler of Caere that would corroborate Aristotle's statement that the Etruscans and Carthaginians were so close as to form almost <b>one</b> <b>people.</b> The Etruscan city-states were, at times, both commercial partners of Carthage and military allies.|$|E

25|$|The {{story of}} the Tower of Babel is meant to explain the origin of {{different}} languages. According to the story, which is recorded in , everyone on earth spoke the same language. As people migrated from the east, they settled {{in the land of}} Shinar. People there sought to make bricks and build a city and a tower with its top in the sky, {{to make a name for}} themselves, so that they not be scattered over the world. God came down to look at the city and tower, and remarked that as <b>one</b> <b>people</b> with one language, nothing that they sought would be out of their reach. God went down and confounded their speech, so that they could not understand each other, and scattered them over the face of the earth, and they stopped building the city. Thus the city was called Babel.|$|E
25|$|The Azerbaijanis grew {{increasingly}} suspicious that Shahumyan, {{who was an}} ethnic Armenian, was conspiring with the Dashnaks against them. The units of Savage Division, composed of Caucasian Muslims who {{had served in the}} Imperial Russian Army, disarmed a pro-Bolshevik garrison in Lankaran, and Dagestani insurgents under Imam Najm ul-din Gotsinski drove the Bolsheviks out of Petrovsk, severing Baku's land communications with Bolshevik Russia. The Armistice of Erzincan, followed by the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk signed on 3 March 1918, formalized Russia's exit from World War I. According to Richard G. Hovannisian, a secret annex to the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk obligated the Bolsheviks to demobilize and dissolve ethnic Armenian bands on territories previously under Russian control. At the subsequent Trabzon Peace Conference, the Ottoman delegation called for a unified position of the Sejm before the negotiations could be completed. The Bolsheviks {{grew increasingly}} concerned about the emerging Transcaucasian Federation, and in the given situation, had to choose between Musavat and ARF in the struggle to dominate Transcaucasia's largest city. Thus the Baku Soviet was drawn into the nationalistic struggle between the Azerbaijanis and the Armenians, trying to utilize <b>one</b> <b>people</b> against the other.|$|E
25|$|Marcus Garvey {{encouraged}} African {{people around}} the world to be proud of their race and to see beauty in their own kind. This form of Black nationalism later became known as Garveyism. A central idea to Garveyism was that African people in every part of the world were <b>one</b> <b>people</b> and they would never advance if they did not put aside their cultural and ethnic differences and unite under their own shared history. He was heavily influenced by the earlier works of Booker T. Washington, Martin Delany, and Henry McNeal Turner. Garvey used his own personal magnetism and the understanding of black psychology and the psychology of confrontation to create a movement that challenged bourgeois blacks for the minds and souls of African Americans. Marcus Garvey's return to America had to do with his desire to meet with the man who inspired him most, Booker T. Washington but unfortunately Garvey did not return in time to meet Washington. Despite this, Garvey moved forward with his efforts and two years later, a year after Washington's death, Garvey established a similar organization in America known as the United Negro Improvement Association otherwise known as the UNIA. Garvey's beliefs are articulated in The Philosophy and Opinions of Marcus Garvey as well as Message To The People: The Course of African Philosophy.|$|E

500|$|What {{were known}} as [...] "mourning wars" [...] were also an {{important}} cultural factor in native warfare.

In times of war, natives would capture members of another native group and adopt {{them in order to}} rebuild their society. When new diseases such as smallpox killed large numbers of native people within their communities, survivors were motivated to warfare in order to take captives to rebuild.|$|E

500|$|The modern Welsh {{name for}} {{themselves}} is Cymry, and Cymru is the Welsh name for Wales. These words (both {{of which are}} pronounced [...] ) are descended from the Brythonic word combrogi, meaning [...] "fellow-countrymen". The {{use of the word}} Cymry as a self-designation derives from the location in the post-Roman Era (after the arrival of the Anglo-Saxons) of the Welsh (Brythonic-speaking) people in modern Wales as well as in northern England and southern Scotland ("Yr Hen Ogledd") (...) [...] It emphasised that the Welsh in modern Wales and in the Hen Ogledd were <b>one</b> <b>people,</b> different from other peoples. In particular, the term was not applied to the Cornish or the Breton peoples, who are of similar heritage, culture, and language to the Welsh. The word came into use as a self-description probably before the 7th century.|$|E

Her standing in the polls rose by 11% after a January 1978 interview for World in Action in which she said [...] "the British character has done so much for democracy, for law and done so much throughout the world that if there is any fear that it might be swamped people are going to react and be rather hostile to those coming in", as well as [...] "in many ways [...] add to the richness and variety of this country. The moment the minority threatens to become a big <b>one,</b> <b>people</b> get frightened". In the 1979 general election, the Conservatives attracted voters from the NF, whose support almost collapsed. In a meeting in July 1979 with Foreign Secretary Lord Carrington and Home Secretary William Whitelaw she objected to the number of Asian immigrants, in the context of limiting the total of Vietnamese boat people allowed to settle in the UK to fewer than 10,000.|$|E
