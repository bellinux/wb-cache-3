5|$|Margiris, {{the defender}} of Pilėnai, is often {{suggested}} {{as the most}} likely candidate for the fourth brother.

One of these two brothers must then have been Vainius; the identity of the other still puzzles historians.

Sources mention one son of Margiris, who was captured by the Teutonic Knights soon after his father's suicide in 1336 and did not return.|$|E

This study is aimed to determine variables to be effective on listening skills levels. The study was conducted over totally 157 individuals (47 females) performing mountaineering activities {{in different parts of}} Turkey. Listening Skills Scale which was developed by Cihangir and Çankaya (2012) was used to gather data and frequency distribution, t test and ANOVA variance analysis were employed for statistical evaluation. Differences between the views of the groups were commented by taking the significance level of P: 0. 05 into consideration. It was found from {{the results of the study}} that there is no statistically significant difference between mean scores of the groups for gender, age, family structure and the reason for the preference of mountaineering sports while differences are statistically significant for education level and length of the time spent for sports. High school graduate individuals <b>occupying</b> <b>with</b> sports for 5 to 7 years exhibited lower listening skills than primary school and university graduate people occupying for more and less than 5 to 7 years. High accident risk makes listening important in mountaineering sports. It was suggested that individuals <b>occupying</b> <b>with</b> mountaineering should be told the importance of listening and need for improving listening skills...|$|R
