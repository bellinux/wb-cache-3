40|$|Background Deaths due to {{occupational}} disease and injury place {{a heavy burden}} on society {{in terms of economic}} costs and human suffering. Methods We estimate the annual deaths due to selected diseases for which an occu-pational association is reasonably well established and quantifiable, by calculation of attributable fractions (AFs), with full documentation; the deaths due to occupational injury are then added to derive an estimated number of annual deaths due to occupation. Results Using 1997 US mortality data, the estimated annual burden of <b>occupational</b> <b>disease</b> <b>mortality</b> resulting from selected respiratory diseases, cancers, cardiovascular disease, chronic renal failure, and hepatitis is 49, 000, with a range from 26, 000 to 72, 000. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates there are about 6, 200 work-related injury deaths annually. Adding disease and injury data, we estimate that there are a total of 55, 200 US deaths annually resulting from {{occupational disease}} or injury (range 32, 200 – 78, 200). Conclusions Our estimate is in the range reported by previous investigators, although we have restricted ourselves more than others to only those diseases with well-established occupational etiology, biasing our estimates conservatively. The underlying assumptions and data used to generate the estimates are well documented, so our estimates may be updated as newdata emerges on occupational risks and exposed populations, providing an advantage over previous studies. We estimate that occupational deaths are the 8 th leading cause of death in the US, after diabetes (64, 751) but ahead of suicide (30, 575), and greater than the annual number of motor vehicle deaths per year (43, 501) ...|$|E

Results: The incidence of <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> in the Netherlands ranges from 0. 19 % (diagnosed by an occupational physician, workers) to 1. 6 % (self-reported, diagnosed by a medical doctor, self-employed) to 3. 2 % (self-reported, diagnosed by a medical doctor, employees). In 2013 an estimated 4, 100 people died in the Netherlands as the result of an <b>occupational</b> <b>disease</b> (900 employees and 3, 200 pensioners). The most common self-reported <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> among employees are musculoskeletal disorders (1. 7 %) and mental disorder (1. 4 %). The most common <b>occupational</b> <b>disease</b> diagnosed by <b>occupational</b> physicians is common mental disorders (0. 8 %). The risk of an <b>occupational</b> <b>disease</b> for employees is highest in the healthcare (4. 0 %), industry (3. 7 %) and construction (3. 6 %) sectors.

Targeted {{education}} of occupational physicians (OPs) may improve their rate of reporting <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases.</b> Aim: To study {{the effectiveness of}} an active multifaceted workshop aimed at improving OPs' reporting of <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases.</b> Methods: We undertook a comparative study with 112 OPs in the intervention group and 571 OPs as comparisons. The intervention was a 1 -day workshop. Measurements of <b>occupational</b> <b>disease</b> reporting activity in both groups in 6 -month periods {{before and after the}} intervention were collected via the national registration system. Measurements of OPs' knowledge, self-efficacy and satisfaction were made in the intervention group. Differences between the groups and predictive factors for reporting were subsequently analysed statistically. Results: The percentage of reporting OPs after the intervention was significantly higher in the intervention group compared to the comparison group at 19 versus 11 % (P < 0. 01). No differences were found in the average number of reported <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> per reporting physician after the intervention: 3. 7 (SD 5. 37) versus 3. 4 (SD 4. 56) (not significant). The self-efficacy score was a predictive factor for reporting <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> (P < 0. 05).

Further, the evaluation of a worker´s health condition should take into account his/her exposure outside work. I have selected the topic of the thesis: ``Occurrence of <b>occupational</b> <b>disease</b> in the South Bohemian region `` because I find occupational hygiene the most interesting sphere in the hygienic sector. The objective of my work was to map <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> in the South Bohemian region and to determine the situation in <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> in a selected period.

To test the hypothesis I used a statistical survey using the Student t-test.

40|$|Record linkage {{studies have}} been used for decades to study <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> and <b>mortality.</b> While low {{response}} rates represent an increasing problem in connection with sample surveys, response rates at cen-suses in the Nordic countries are close to 100 %. The linking of census data with data about mortality, emigration and cancer by the unique personal identification numbers, ensures complete information on relevant events. Results from a large census-based Nordic study on cancer incidence by occupation are presented, and advantages and problems related to such type of studies are discussed. In record linkage studies occupational group, socio-economic status or any other characteristic may be used as the exposure indicator. The results of such studies usually must be interpreted in light of established etiologic associa-tions. The two main purposes with record linkage studies are that they may be used as reference material in the general description of cancer incidence and distribution in a population, and that they serve as a basis for generation of hypotheses to be tested in analytical studies with more detailed information. The potential for using death certificate data for the surveillance of occupational hazards was envisioned nearly 150 years ago when the first occupational mor-tality statistics were published for England and Wales in 1855 (Registrar General, 1855). The earliest study of occupational mortality based on the linkage of individual death certificates and census records was done in the United States based on a 4 -month follow-up of a sample of the 1960 census population (Kitagawa & Hauser, 1973). In Norway a similar study based on deaths in 1960 - 64 was pub-lished in 1974 (Tønnesen, 1974), and later a 10 -year follow up of the Swedish 1960 population was pub-lished (Statistiska Centralbyrån, 1982).

40|$|The {{objective}} of my thesis "Occupational diseases in medical personnel and their most common causes" explores the detriments of health {{that result from}} theoretical risk in the medical working environment. These health detriments not only severely impact personal health but also cause economical troubles due to diminished work capabilities. Occupational health services have improved {{as a consequence of}} this impact. Instead of this term, the expression "work healthcare" is now more commonly used. Its main goal is improvement of labour conditions as well as support of employees health. The occurrence of <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> reflects the level of healthcare services available for employees. The National Institute of Public Health in Prague, in conjunction with The Institute of Health Information and Statistics of the Czech Republic, aim to operate within this framework {{to address the issue of}} work healthcare. The {{objective of}} the thesis is to examine the occurrence of <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> in the Czech Republic as well as in the South Bohemia region within a specific time period. Expressed in focused literature, there are two hypotheses related to occupational healthcare: H 1 "The occurrence of <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> has a declining trend" and H 2 "The most common <b>occupational</b> <b>disease</b> in health care in the South Bohemia region is scabies for the years 2002, 2012 and 2013 ". A secondary analysis of data shows the occurrence of <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases,</b> which reflects the employees' level of healthcare. The National register of <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> is available on the official web site of The National Institute of Public Health in Prague, where single year data is available for further examination. Further data is provided by The Centre of occupational Health at The National Institute of Public Health in Prague. A point of discussion is "monitoring knowledgeability of employees in public healthcare regarding prevention against occupational diseases". Another issue is "the instruction of the medical workforce about prevention against occupational diseases". The focus group is the medical workforce of The Hospital of Czech Budweis, a. s. and The Hospital of T. Bati, a. s. in Zlín. The featured questionnaire research had twenty questions, with twelve focused on knowledge of prevention that minimised contraction of associated diseases. The research has discovered that the <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> in the health and social care field has a declining trend. The largest percentage of the population that has had scabies occurred in 2002. 139 cases were reported which was 53 % of all <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> that year. Scabies occurred in 72 cases in the year 2012, which was 55 % of all <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> in that year. In South Moravia, there were 44 cases of <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> in 2002, but only 6 in the year 2012. The statistics of 2012 imply a significant decline. In 2002, the region of Ústí and Labem had the greatest number of <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> cases 42 cases. But no case of <b>occupational</b> <b>disease</b> was found in 2002 in the region of Olomouc and in 2012 in the region of Zlín. This statistical data proves the hypothesis of a declining trend. The most significant occurrence of <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> was found in the nurse population of the South Bohemia region. The most common <b>occupational</b> <b>disease</b> was scabies. Nine cases were recorded which accounted for 30 % of all <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> in 2002, 2012 and 2013 in the South Bohemia region. The most <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> were found in 2002 17 cases. 2012 showed a decline of only 3 cases. In 2013, the occurrence of <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> increased to 10 cases compared to 2012. The hypothesis was statistically confirmed.

Results: In 2014, there were 2351 cases of <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> recorded, i. e., 16. 5 cases per 100 thousand of employees. The most numerous categories comprised infectious or parasitic diseases (borreliosis), pneumoconiosis, voice disorders and hearing loss (in total 79. 7 % of cases). The main causative factors of <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> were as follows: industrial dust containing free silica, tick-transmitted Borrelia spirochete, and the way the work is done, including excessive vocal effort, and noise. The highest incidence per 100 thousand workers were recorded in mining and quarrying (296), manufacturing (24. 9), education (24. 6), agriculture and forestry (24. 2) sectors. Conclusions: Compared with the previous year, there was a slight increase in the number of cases of certified <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> (6. 2 %), primarily due to the increased incidence of Lyme disease. The incidence of voice disorders among teachers continues to vary considerably in individual provinces (0 – 11. 3 / 10 000), reflecting the use of non-uniform diagnostic and certification methods.

40|$|Registries of <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> {{in various}} European {{countries}} differ considerably in criteria for notification and recognition, statistical data provided {{and the legal}} and social security context. Therefore, figures on <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> are not comparable between countries and are often regarded as not reliable even within a country. Still, registries of <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> are an important source for policy on occupational safety and health. To evaluate registries of <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> in European (EU) countries {{for their ability to}} provide appropriate information for preventive policy. Contact persons of national registries for <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> in six countries were sent a questionnaire on the objectives of their registry and on the quality of monitoring time trends and alerting to new risks. An auditor then visited each contact person, discussed the completed questionnaire and sent a draft audit report to the contact person for verification. Two reviewers then established a quality score based on the verified audit report. The results of the audit were sent to each contact person, who was asked to evaluate the usefulness of the audit instrument for future quality improvement of the registry. The objectives of the registries assessed in the six countries were compensation, provision of statistics, prevention and research. The average quality was rated 3. 2 (SD 2. 2) out of 10 for monitoring <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> and 5. 3 (SD 1. 4) out of 10 for alerting to new risks. The main reasons for the low scores were inadequate education and training of physicians and poor participation of notifying physicians. Three of the six contact persons (50 %) agreed that the audit could actually contribute to future quality improvement of the registry in relation to prevention. Registries in EU countries do not adequately monitor existing <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> or adequately alert to newly occurring <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases.</b> There is an urgent need to improve the education and participation of notifying physician...|$|R
