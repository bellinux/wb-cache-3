5|$|Hsu {{described}} the localization {{work as a}} balancing act, and said that continuity and consistency was very important. To avoid situations where a small detail in one game is changed in localization, and then comes back as a major point in a sequel, Hsu avoided changing things unless necessary, such as when something in the original would not be understood by the target audience. <b>One</b> <b>thing</b> <b>the</b> localization team had {{to keep in mind}} was keeping the writing in-character: when substituting a Japanese joke with an English one, they had to consider whether it would be something that the character would say, and not simply that it was funny. They also worked towards having puns and references be appropriate for the dialogue, so that the dialogue still makes sense to players who do not get the reference or pun.|$|E
5|$|Reports of {{the brutal}} {{policies}} of the organization soon {{made their way to}} Phnom Penh and into the population foretelling the violence that was about to consume the nation. There were tales of the forced relocations of entire villages, of the summary execution of any who disobeyed or even asked questions, the forbidding of religious practices, of monks who were defrocked or murdered, and where traditional sexual and marital habits were foresworn. War was <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>the</b> offhand manner in which the Khmer Rouge dealt out death, so contrary to the Khmer character, was quite another. Reports of these atrocities began to surface during the same period in which North Vietnamese troops were withdrawing from the Cambodian battlefields. This was no coincidence. The concentration of the PAVN effort on South Vietnam allowed the Khmer Rouge to apply their doctrine and policies without restraint for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Once {{rebuilding}} began, {{the poor}} rebuilt their basic {{housing in the}} same primitive fashion as before. By contrast, the wealthiest residents, both secular and spiritual, became caught in an almost manic orgy of building. Most members of the nobility had several homes in Sicily. For <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>the</b> Spanish viceroy spent {{six months of the}} year in Palermo and six in Catania, holding court in each city, and hence members of the aristocracy needed a town palazzo in each city. Once the palazzi in devastated Catania were rebuilt in the new fashion, the palazzi in Palermo seemed antiquated by comparison, so they too were eventually rebuilt. Following this, from the middle of the 18th century, villas to retire to in the autumn, essentially status symbols, were built at the fashionable enclave at Bagheria. This pattern was repeated, on a smaller scale, throughout the lesser cities of Sicily, each city providing a more entertaining social life and a magnetic draw for the provincial aristocrat than their country estate. The country estate also did not escape the building mania. Often Baroque wings or new façades were added to ancient castles, or country villas were completely rebuilt. Thus the frenzy of building gained momentum until the increasingly fantastical Baroque architecture demanded by these hedonistic patrons reached its zenith in the mid-18th century.|$|E

25|$|In the {{category}} of differentiable manifolds, fiber bundles arise naturally as submersions of one manifold to another.

25|$|Numerous criticisms {{have been}} made {{regarding}} the use of impact factors. For <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>the</b> impact factor might not be consistently reproduced in an independent audit. There is also a more general debate on the validity of the impact factor as a measure of journal importance and the effect of policies that editors may adopt to boost their impact factor (perhaps to the detriment of readers and writers). Other criticism focuses on the effect of the impact factor on behavior of scholars, editors and other stakeholders. Others have criticized the impact factor more generally on the institutional background of the neoliberal academia, claiming that what is needed is not just its replacement with more sophisticated metrics but a democratic discussion on the social value of research assessment and the growing precariousness of scientific careers.|$|E
25|$|<b>One</b> <b>thing</b> <b>the</b> {{two groups}} did agree on {{was that they}} wanted to {{discourage}} any more miners from coming up the following year. Though obliged to report their earnings, they all intended to report that the diggings were not very good and that more should be known of the country before any discoveries were reported. With the exception of Patrick Kelly and Vital LaForce, who stayed at Fort St. James, the other miners all returned to Quesnel with the news that the venture had only been marginally successful. However, suspicions were raised when the men announced they were returning to Vital Creek for the winter and even more eyebrows were raised when it was discovered that LaForce and Kelly had spent an astounding $2500 at the Fort St. James trading post.|$|E
25|$|In Curonia, the Livonian {{language}} and culture also came under heavy pressure, but here it retained a last foothold on the outermost tip of the Curonian Peninsula. Several factors made sure that in this area, known as Līvõd rānda, the Livonian Coast, Latvian culture {{was too weak to}} assimilate the Livonians. For <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>the</b> society of the Livonians living in this area was exclusively sea-oriented and based on fishing, while that of the Latvians in the interior was exclusively land-oriented and mostly agricultural. This meant there was not a lot of interaction between the two groups. Also, the Livonian Coast was separated from the interior of Curonia by dense forests and impassable marshlands, which made regular interaction even less likely. The people of the Livonian Coast had much closer ties to the inhabitants of the Estonian island of Saaremaa, across the Gulf of Riga to the north. In their isolated fishing villages, these Livonians kept to themselves for centuries. It was not until the 20th century that the outside world intruded on their quiet existence.|$|E

500|$|The mRNA {{does not}} contain all the {{information}} for specifying {{the nature of the}} mature protein. The nascent polypeptide chain released from the ribosome commonly requires additional processing before the final product emerges. For <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>the</b> correct folding process is complex and vitally important. For most proteins it requires other chaperone proteins to control the form of the product. Some proteins then excise internal segments from their own peptide chains, splicing the free ends that border the gap; in such processes the inside [...] "discarded" [...] sections are called inteins. [...] Other proteins must be split into multiple sections without splicing. Some polypeptide chains need to be cross-linked, and others must be attached to cofactors such as haem (heme) before they become functional.|$|E

500|$|While Saw {{received}} mixed reviews, {{a general}} consensus among reviewers was that {{fans of the}} film series would enjoy it. Reviewer for Xbox 360 Achievements Alan Pettit wrote that while he enjoyed the game, {{it was not an}} outstanding title. Pettit commented that the game suffered due to the choice of Zombie Studios as the developer and that the franchise could be successful if a sequel was made with changes in developer and budget. Although he claimed it was repetitive, Pettit mentioned that [...] "If there was only <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>the</b> game did well, I'd say the puzzles that are put before you are excellently constructed, well thought out and best of all, difficult enough that you may not get it on your first attempt."

500|$|Isherwood {{also notes}} that this serves a female audience. [...] "If there are chick flicks and chick lit – {{derogatory}} though some might find those terms to be – Love, Loss, and What I Wore should clearly be classified as chick legit...for the women who can share deeply in the particulars of experience dissected and discussed." [...] The Los Angeles Times notes the light nature of the subject matter: [...] "...isn't out to reclaim female sexuality from centuries of oppression; it wittily celebrates wardrobe malfunctions..." [...] According to Reiner, the show points out that [...] "...if there is <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>the</b> females of the species have in common, it's a deep and abiding love/hate relationship with their wardrobe...this wonderfully witty show illustrates, what one wears to the party is sometimes more memorable than the party itself." [...] He {{also notes that}} the entire performance has meaning as it is [...] "jam-packed and resonant" [...] throughout. Shaw notes that [...] "The cozy humor strikes many women's funny bones with a mighty whack, perhaps because it reaffirms so perfectly their own preoccupations." ...|$|E
500|$|In What's So Amazing About Grace?, Yancey {{discusses}} grace, {{calling it}} [...] "our last best word". The book's thesis is that, although people crave grace {{and it is}} centrally important to the gospel, many local churches ignore grace {{in their quest to}} exterminate immorality. Yancey uses the word [...] "ungrace" [...] to describe actions that fail to demonstrate grace. According to the author, the greatest gift the Christian Church can give the world is grace, but the church sometimes offers ungrace instead. Yancey writes that there are secular analogues to most Christian activities benefiting the world, such as social justice work and community service, but that [...] "grace is theological; it comes from God. It's <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>the</b> church can offer that isn't found anywhere else". He describes his experiences attempting to make grace part of the way he lived and not just part of his theology. Yancey quotes Christian counselor David Seamands: [...] "The two major causes of most emotional problems among Evangelical Christians are these: the failure to understand, receive and live out God's unconditional grace and forgiveness; and the failure to give out that unconditional love, forgiveness, and grace to other people".|$|E

Series writer Gail Simone stated that while the character is [...] "one of the smartest and toughest women in comics... <b>One</b> <b>thing</b> <b>the</b> book is truly about, is that the after-effects of something like PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) or other trauma-related syndromes, can strike even very smart, very intellectually tough people, even soldiers and cops", a subject that is generally overlooked in comic books. She also explained the method of the character's recovery is based upon real life experiences in that [...] "some of the best real world work in the field of mobility rehabilitation is coming from South Africa. People have been talking about this as if it's some sort of mystical thing like returning from the dead, but there are treatments and surgeries that can restore mobility in some cases.

500|$|Presley and his wife, meanwhile, {{had become}} {{increasingly}} distant, barely cohabiting. In 1971, an affair {{he had with}} Joyce Bova resulted—unbeknownst to him—in her pregnancy and an abortion. He often {{raised the possibility of}} her moving into Graceland, saying that he was likely to leave Priscilla. The Presleys separated on February 23, 1972, after Priscilla disclosed her relationship with Mike Stone, a karate instructor Presley had recommended to her. Priscilla relates that when she told him, Presley [...] "grabbed... and forcefully made love to" [...] her, declaring, [...] "This is how a real man makes love to his woman." [...] Five months later, Presley's new girlfriend, Linda Thompson, a songwriter and one-time Memphis beauty queen, moved in with him. Presley and his wife filed for divorce on August 18. Presley became depressed after the break up of his marriage. According to Joe Moscheo of the Imperials, the failure of Presley's marriage [...] "was a blow from which he never recovered." [...] During a press conference in 1972, a reporter asked Presley {{whether or not he was}} satisfied with his image, Presley replied [...] "Well, the human being is <b>one</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>The</b> image is another.

500|$|Reception of [...] "The Food Wife" [...] {{from food}} critics has been mixed. Before the episode aired, Robert Sietsema of The Village Voice disapproved {{of it for}} being outdated. He commented that [...] "this show should have been done, say, {{two or three years}} ago, when food {{blogging}} was hot. By now, many food bloggers of our acquaintance have out-migrated to paying gigs, and the concept of the food blog has been co-opted by every major media outlet, rendering real food blogs – the old-fashioned kind, where someone stood alone in their kitchen cooking things, or wandered the hinterlands seeking out unique deliciousness – nearly obsolete." [...] Sietsema also criticized the scenes showcasing molecular gastronomy because he thought they were out of date, since molecular gastronomy is, [...] "by now, long past its prime". Chris Shott, a food critic for Washington City Papers Young & Hungry column and blog, wrote negatively about the character that owns El Chemistri and is a parody of José Andrés. He commented that [...] "For <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>the</b> character seems far more subdued than the kooky, wild-eyed power drill-wielding cook we saw on Conan recently. The satire here, involving a deconstructed Caesar salad of foams, gels and airs, is more a riff on molecular gastronomy in general than a send-up of Andrés' over-the-top personality." ...|$|E
