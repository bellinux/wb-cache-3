5000|$|Legally, {{the first}} {{cross-border}} regions {{were based on}} agreements {{with varying degrees of}} formality and mostly relied on good will. In 1980, on the initiative of the Council of Europe, the so-called Madrid Convention (<b>Outline</b> <b>Convention</b> on Transfrontier Co-operation) was introduced as a first step towards CBC structures based on public law. The convention has been signed by 20 countries and was more recently updated with two Additional Protocols. It provides a legal framework for completing bi- and multinational agreements for public law CBC among NCGs. Examples for such agreements are the BENELUX Cross-border Convention of 1989 and the German-Dutch cross-border treaty of 1991. The Euroregion Rijn-Waal on the Dutch-German border has been such a cross-national public body since 1993. However, the regulations delivered by such agencies are binding only on the public authorities within the cross-border area concerned and not on civil subjects (Denters et al. 1998).|$|E

The author then discusses the basic rules of functioning of intergovernmental commissions and councils. 2. Main body. The main body of the article consists of discussion about recent cross-border cooperation issues with three chosen neighboring countries of the Republic of Poland: the Federal Republic of Germany, the Republic of Slovakia and Ukraine. Cooperation with the countries mentioned is made through: – the Polish-German Intergovernmental Commission for Regional and Closeborder Cooperation; – the Polish-Slovak Intergovernmental Commission for Cross-border Cooperation; – the Polish-Ukrainian Intergovernmental Council for Interregional Cooperation. All of the bodies mentioned are, from the Polish side, {{under the supervision of the}} Ministry of Interior of the Republic of Poland. 3. Summary.

40|$|The European law of {{cross-border}} cooperation {{is the legal}} product of the interplay of different legal orders, namely the international public legal order (Madrid <b>Outline</b> <b>Convention,</b> following Protocols and international agreements enforcing it), the European Union and the national one. To this extent, the European law of CBC is a dynamic process where {{each of the three}} components plays a role but none is prevailing from a normative point of view. The paper examines the components of this European law of CBC by looking first at the way CBC is currently conceived by the supranational legal drivers (Council of Europe and EU). It emerges that CBC is not more a matter of dealing with the problems of proximity between communities and territories laying on either side of borders, but of putting together genuine projects for CBC area and implementing a real CBC policy. This implies some consequences. First, CBC as a policy tends to involve territorial units enjoying influential political capacity, such as: federal state, legislative regions or at least inter-municipal association. Even national state may have an interest in participating. The second feature is the institutionalization of CBC as a way to promote coordination of policies, even according to a multilevel governance concept, rather than as an instrument to solve specific cross-border problems. However, this conception of CBC and its consequences must be put into relation with the attitude national states have showed towards CBC. By taking into consideration some factors – namely, the type of decentralization, the intergovernmental relations, the ethnic minorities presence, the influence exerted by supranational actors in countries of democratic transition – we will investigate the potential degree of the national states’ acceptability of the common regulatory solution advanced at the supranational level. To this extent, some specific references will be made to the national enforcement process of the EGTC Regulation in order to enlighten and understand why the EGTC application across Europe is likely to vary...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{enlargement}} of the European Union to twenty five (25) member states (2004) resulted in greater inequalities between European regions and subsequent expansions in other countries of south-east Europe may exacerbate these inequalities. These regional disparities in the enlarged EU must be reduced and dealt with an effective cohesion policy, part {{of which is the}} development of cross-border cooperation. According to the European <b>Outline</b> <b>Convention</b> of Madrid (1980), trans-frontier cooperation means any agreed transaction intended to encourage and cultivate the relationships between neighbouring local authorities of two or more parties. Euroregions promote cross-border cooperation between border regions and social partners in areas such as culture, education, tourism and the economy. From a purely economic standpoint, the preservation of natural or “invisible” borders is an obstacle to economic development. Since “invisible barriers” (languages, cultural problems, etc.) are hard to eliminate, the need to turn the boundaries in contact zones is stressed. These areas should be “bridges between states”, “channels for the mutual understanding of peoples”, “prosperity borders” and “cradles of development”. Factors that promote cross-border cooperation is, among others, the tradition and experience in collaboration, adequate common mechanisms by local authorities, the availability of sufficient financial resources, etc. On the contrary, factors that impede this cooperation are legal restrictions, disputes about the responsibility of the various levels of government, the limited experience of local authorities in the implementation of development programs, etc. It is estimated that, regarding the economic situation of regions bordering to candidate countries and the potential consequences of EU enlargement on them, the border areas of Greece and especially continental border areas, are among the least favoured regions, since they are faced with the most difficult situation regarding income, labour market dynamics, infrastructure and human resources. The prefecture of Serres, a border region, according to the predictions of General and Regional Framework for Physical Planning, is indented to become a regional growth pole of the trans- border cooperation. In this paper, {{based on the results of}} empirical research in institutions of Serres, we examine the collaboration of institutions of Serres with their respective Bulgarian ones. More particularly we explore areas of cooperation, opportunities and obstacles, results, and impacts on Serres by the accession of Bulgaria to the EU. The majority of institutions consider Bulgaria's endorsement to the EU as a positive progress for Serres and the extended region. Half or more of the institutions began their collaboration after the Bulgarian accession, aiming mainly to economic-development benefits and the exchange of experience and expertise, in fields of environment, culture, education, employment, entrepreneurship, etc...|$|E

40|$|Background: Although {{ontology}} naming conventions {{have been}} proposed by policy makers, the lack of tool support for testing and enforcing naming practices has hindered widespread compliance. We have developed OntoCheck, a Protégé plugin, which allows testing labels in an ontology on naming inconsistencies. Objective: We report on initial experience in applying the tool in different settings and show that OntoCheck contributes to quality assurance in a test-set of ontologies. Methods: We apply OntoCheck in four different ontology engineering efforts and test {{a variety of different}} ontologies on prevalence of naming issues. For each, we analyze the percentages of class names and labels violating <b>outlined</b> <b>conventions</b> and correlate the check types to the set of OBO Foundry naming conventions. Results: Application of OntoCheck revealed that heterogeneity in class labels is still a common feature, even in release versions of ontologies, and that many of these could be detected and rectified by tool support. Nearly half of the OBO Foundry naming conventions could be assisted by OntoCheck, the remaining fraction relying on more complicated parsing and availability of lexica. Besides requirements drawn from naming conventions themselves, mismatches in string-based ontology alignment algorithms are identified as sanity check on the impact of labelling consistency. Analysing the prevalence of false positive and negative ontology alignment mismatches could prove valuable in deriving new naming conventions and test their effects in cross ontology harmonization efforts. Conclusion: Our results show that typographical and syntactical labelling heterogeneity can be improved by tool support. The application of OntoCheck supports the verification of naming conventions and will ultimately ease string based ontology alignment...|$|R
