The initial reduction of deep-water ventilation is caused by a warming and fresh water-induced stratification of Eastern Mediterranean surface waters.

During S 6 formation <b>oxygen</b> <b>depletions</b> and eutrophication were less severe and more variable than during S 5 formation. Estimated oxygen contents were low dysoxic at middle bathyal to anoxic at lower bathyal depths during the early phase of S 6 formation but never dropped to anoxic values in its late phase. The high benthic ecosystem variability during S 6 formation suggests that water column stratification at deep-water formation sites was in a very unstable mode and susceptible to minor temperature fluctuations at a millennial time-scale...|$|R

Water hyacinth is a free-floating perennial plant that can grow to a height of 3 feet.

The images included low to modrerate solar activity levels. A new model was developed to generate global dayglow images using first principles methods. The mass Spectrometer/incoherent scatter (MSIS- 86) model was used to predict the thermospheric concentrations. The analyses of thermospheric images observed in the 123 to 160 -nm nominal passband show that the spectral composition for observations on the projected earth disk is dominated by O I 130. 4 -nm radiation (85 - 90 %), with concentrations from O I 135. 6 -nm and N 2 Lyman-Birge-Hopefield (LBH) bands of about 5 - 8 % each. The synthetic images reproduce the global features of the observed images rather well. Differences between the model and the data are attributed to real atmospheric effects, such as atomic <b>oxygen</b> <b>depletions</b> which are not well reproduced by the MSIS model when geomagnetic activity is elevated. The absoute values recorded were 38 - 54 % higher than predicted. We attribute this discrepancy to low values of the solar extreme ultraviolet irradiances used in the model. Images obtained in the 136 to 165 -nm nominal passband are a factor of 2. 7 greater than the model. The excess signal observed is most likely due to a long wavelength tail in the instrument sensitivity which allowed Rayleigh scattered sunlight between 180 and 250 nm to be detected.
