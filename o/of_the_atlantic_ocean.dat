5|$|In 1975, {{the first}} {{practical}} solar boat {{was constructed in}} England. By 1995, passenger boats incorporating PV panels began appearing and are now used extensively. In 1996, Kenichi Horie made the first solar-powered crossing of the Pacific Ocean, and the Sun21 catamaran made the first solar-powered crossing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean</b> {{in the winter of}} 2006–2007.

5|$|On August9, 2007, NOAA revised {{its season}} {{estimate}} slightly downwards to 13 to 16named storms of which seven to nine {{were to be}} hurricanes and three to five major hurricanes. However, the agency reaffirmed its prediction of an above-average season, citing warmer-than-normal sea surface temperatures in parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean</b> and Caribbean Sea {{and the likelihood of}} La Niña conditions during the peak of the season.|$|E

5|$|All major {{forecasting}} agencies predicted an above-average season. All {{reduced their}} seasonal predictions in early August, {{but even the}} revised predictions were too high. The lack of activity was primarily caused by an unexpected significant weakening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean</b> thermohaline circulation between winter and spring. This resulted in continuation of the spring weather pattern over the Atlantic Ocean, with strong vertical wind shear, mid-level moisture, and atmospheric stability, which suppressed tropical cyclogenesis.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{its small}} size, Massachusetts {{features}} numerous topographically distinctive regions. The large coastal plain <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean</b> {{in the eastern}} section of the state contains Greater Boston, along {{with most of the}} state's population, as well as the distinctive Cape Cod peninsula. To the west lies the hilly, rural region of Central Massachusetts, and beyond that, the Connecticut River Valley. Along the western border of Western Massachusetts lies the highest elevated part of the state, the Berkshires.|$|E

5|$|In 1494, the {{principal}} maritime powers, Portugal and Spain, signed a treaty which drew a line {{down the middle}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean</b> and allocated all trade routes {{to the east of}} the line to Portugal. That gave Portugal dominance of the only known route to the east—via the Cape of Good Hope and Indian Ocean, which left Spain, and later other countries, to seek a western route to the Pacific. The exploration of the south began as part of the search for such a route.|$|E
5|$|Ocepeia {{lived at}} a time when {{northwest}} Africa was at the intersection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean</b> and the ancient Tethys Ocean, and much of the area was flooded by shallow, warm inland seas. Ocepeia fossils are associated with diverse sharks, birds, and marine reptiles, and a small number of early mammals, including other condylarths and early proboscideans. The early appearance and specialized features of Ocepeia suggest afrotherians originated and diversified within Africa, contrary to theories suggesting a more northern origin.|$|E
5|$|The Atlantic torpedo {{is widely}} {{distributed}} in cool waters {{on both sides}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean.</b> In the east, it is found from northern Scotland to the Gulf of Guinea, including the entire Mediterranean Sea (but not the Black Sea), the Azores, and Madeira, {{as well as from}} Namibia to western South Africa.

In United States waters, it is relatively common off North Carolina and Florida (particularly the Florida Straits) and rarer elsewhere. There are questionable reports of this species off the Pacific coast of Panama.|$|E
5|$|The roughtail {{stingray}} is broadly but discontinuously {{distributed in the}} coastal waters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean.</b> In the western Atlantic, it occurs from the Georges Bank off New England southward to Florida, the Bahamas, and the northeastern Gulf of Mexico; there are also scattered reports from Venezuela to Argentina and on the Barrier reef in Belize. In the eastern Atlantic, it occurs from the southern Bay of Biscay to Angola, including the Mediterranean Sea, Madeira, and the Canary Islands. A single record from Quilon, India was likely a misidentification.|$|E

5|$|Astrid was {{transferred}} to British ownership in 1984 when she was overhauled for the Astrid Trust, a private company limited by guarantee. The restoration was financially supported by Sir Jack Hayward, and also involved Rear Admiral Charles Williams. She was subsequently dedicated on 17 May 1989 by Princess Anne, following which she {{took part in the}} 800th anniversary celebrations of the Lord Mayor of London. Astrid then competed in the 1989 Cutty Sark Tall Ships' Race. She also competed in the 1990 and 1991 Cutty Sark Tall Ships' Races. Astrid made more than 16 crossings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean</b> as a training ship.|$|E
5|$|Despite a {{decrease}} in convection shortly after forming, the large depression remained well organized, with a wind field 575mi (930km) in diameter. On August 22, as it passed 140mi (225km) to south of the Cape Verde islands, deep convection developed over the center of circulation, and early on August 23 the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Debby about 300mi (485km) southwest of Cape Verde. Banding features continued to organize as the system slowly strengthened, and on August 23 Debby attained a peak intensity of 50mph (85km/h) over the open waters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean.</b> Forecasters predicted Debby to continue to intensify to attain hurricane status, while its projected path placed the storm {{in an area of}} warm water temperatures and moderate upper level shear.|$|E
5|$|Signal Hill is a hill which {{overlooks the}} city of St. John's. It is the {{location}} of Cabot Tower which was built in 1897 to commemorate the 400th anniversary of John Cabot's discovery of Newfoundland, and Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee. The first transatlantic wireless transmission was received here by Guglielmo Marconi on 12 December 1901. Today, Signal Hill is a National Historic Site of Canada and remains incredibly popular amongst tourists and locals alike; 97% of all tourists to St. John's visit Signal Hill. Amongst its popular attractions are the Signal Hill Tattoo, showcasing the Royal Newfoundland Regiment of foot, c. 1795, and the North Head Trail which grants an impressive view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean</b> and the surrounding coast.|$|E

5|$|The Atlantic Ocean has a moderating {{effect on}} {{temperature}} in Jersey, as water {{has a much}} greater specific heat capacity than air and tends to heat and cool slowly throughout the year. This has a warming influence on coastal areas in winter and a cooling influence in summer. The highest temperature recorded was 36.0°C (96.8°F) on 9 August 2003, and the lowest temperature recorded was −10.3°C (13.5°F) on 5 January 1894. By comparison, higher temperatures are found in mainland United Kingdom, which achieved 38.5°C (101.3°F) in Faversham, Kent on 10 August 2003. The impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean</b> and coastal winds ensure that Jersey is slightly cooler than the southern and central parts of England during the summer months.|$|E
5|$|The {{influence}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean</b> and the North Atlantic Current {{creates a}} mild oceanic climate. Temperatures are generally cool, averaging 6.5°C (44°F) in January and 15.4°C (60°F) in July at Duntulm on the Trotternish peninsula of Skye. Snow seldom lies {{at sea level}} and frosts are fewer than on the mainland. Winds are a limiting factor for vegetation: a speed of 128km/h (80mph) has been recorded; south-westerlies are the most common. Rainfall is generally high at between 1300 and 2000mm (50–80in) per annum, and the mountains and hills are wetter still. Tiree {{is one of the}} sunniest places in the country and had 300 days of sunshine in 1975. Trotternish typically has 200 hours of bright sunshine in May, the sunniest month.|$|E
5|$|Under the Köppen climate classification, Boston has a humid {{continental}} climate (Köppen Dfa or Dfb) that borders a humid subtropical climate or a temperate oceanic climate (Köppen Cfa or Cfb) with some maritime influence. Despite its climate, the city {{lies at the}} transition between USDA plant hardiness zones 6b (most of the city) and 7a (Downtown, South Boston, and East Boston neighborhoods). Summers are typically warm to hot, rainy, and humid, while winters oscillate between periods of cold rain and snow, with cold temperatures. Spring and fall are usually mild, with varying conditions dependent on wind direction and jet stream positioning. Prevailing wind patterns that blow offshore minimize the influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean.</b>|$|E
