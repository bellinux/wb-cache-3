40|$|The authors {{examine the}} effect of manager {{ethnicity}} on the ethnic composition of employment using nine years of personnel records from a regional grocery store chain in the United States. The workforce studied is composed almost entirely of a white majority and a large Hispanic minority; the authors focus on the role of Hispanic ethnicity. Estimating models with store fixed effects, the authors examine the effects of manager ethnicity <b>on</b> <b>hiring,</b> transfer, and separation patterns. Effects of manager ethnicity are compared across several types of jobs, with significant effects occurring <b>on</b> <b>hiring</b> patterns but not on transfers, and effects occurring on separation patterns in only one atypical case. The authors also find that the effects <b>on</b> <b>hiring</b> occur only in jobs or departments with very few employees...|$|R

40|$|The use of bogus, {{unsolicited}} job applications {{with the}} intention of measuring employment discrimination extends across 30 years and six countries. Preferential treatment of male applicants has been detected in Departments of Psychology in U. S. universities. Such investigations have also detected a relative disinclination to hire homosexuals in Ontario law firms, Turkish workers in Germany, older job applicants in the U. S. A., and the disabled in France. Many of these studies dispatched only a single application to employers; consequently they are a test of 'preferential treatment', rather than discrimination. discrimination, experiments, resumes, <b>hiring,</b> <b>survey,...</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} effects of {{disability}} discrimination laws <b>on</b> <b>hiring</b> of older workers. These laws do not specifically define older disabled workers as a protected class. But the incidence of disabilities rises steeply with age, so older workers may be disproportionately affected by disability discrimination laws. Moreover, the perception that a worker is likely to have a disability in the near future should also rise steeply with age, and that perception may affect older workers adversely. We estimate {{the effects of}} disability discrimination laws <b>on</b> <b>hiring</b> of disabled workers, focusing some attention <b>on</b> <b>hiring</b> of nondisabled older workers. We use state variation in disability discrimination protections, which can strengthen the coverage of these laws by using a broader definition of disability than the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) or applying to smaller firms, or can entail higher costs via larger damages...|$|R
