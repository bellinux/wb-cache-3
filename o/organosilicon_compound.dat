25|$|Silicon in {{its more}} common {{crystalline}} form {{was not prepared}} until 31 years later, by Deville. By electrolyzing a mixture of sodium chloride and aluminium chloride containing approximately 10% silicon, {{he was able to}} obtain a slightly impure allotrope of silicon in 1854. Later, more cost-effective methods have been developed to isolate several allotrope forms, the most recent being silicene in 2010. Meanwhile, research on the chemistry of silicon continued; Friedrich Wöhler discovered the first volatile hydrides of silicon, synthesising trichlorosilane in 1857 and silane itself in 1858, but a detailed investigation of the silanes was only carried out in the early 20th century by Alfred Stock, despite early speculation on the matter dating {{as far back as the}} beginnings of synthetic organic chemistry in the 1830s. Similarly, the first <b>organosilicon</b> <b>compound,</b> tetraethylsilane, was synthesised by Charles Friedel and James Crafts in 1863, but detailed characterisation of organosilicon chemisry was only done in the early 20th century by Frederick Kipping.|$|E
