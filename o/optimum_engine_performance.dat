50|$|Variable Camshaft Timing (VCT) is an {{automobile}} {{variable valve timing}} technology developed by Ford. It allows for more <b>optimum</b> <b>engine</b> <b>performance,</b> reduced emissions, and increased fuel efficiency compared to engines with fixed camshafts. It uses electronically controlled hydraulic valves that direct high pressure engine oil into the camshaft phaser cavity. These oil control solenoids are bolted into the cylinder heads towards {{the front of the}} engine near the camshaft phasers. The powertrain control module (PCM) transmits a signal to the solenoids to move a valve spool that regulates the flow of oil to the phaser cavity. The phaser cavity changes the valve timing by rotating the camshaft slightly from its initial orientation, which results in the camshaft timing being advanced or retarded. The PCM adjusts the camshaft timing depending on factors such as engine load and RPM.|$|E

In order to accurately set the ignition advance for <b>optimum</b> <b>engine</b> <b>performance</b> under all conditions of engine operation, an adaptive closed loop spark advance controller is required. Investigations of visible and infra-red electromagnetic radiation emitted from the combustion flame of four stroke petrol engines have been made. The light emissions were transmitted to light detection equipment {{through the use of a}} quartz glass window assembly or through a combination fibre optic cable and spark plug configuration constructed for light emission analysis. The detection equipment was used to produce either photographic records of the light emissions spectrum or flame light intensity curves as a function of time from photodetector output voltages. The results of these investigations showed that the combustion flame light emissions were strongly influenced by the ignition advance setting and they could be expected to form a suitable input to a spark advance control system. An electronic knock detection system was constructed using the light emissions intensity as the criteria for determining whether knocking combustion was occurring. The system proved capable of resolving the ignition advance to within 2 ° crankangle of the limit for knock. Further testing was completed in order to determine how the combustion product buildup on the inner glass surface would affect the light transmitted to the photo-detectors over a long period of engine operation.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the investigation into}} the potential of improving the performance of Diesel engine through changes in the engine thermal management with the flexibility of integrating the changes from the engine control strategy. Analysis into previous studies in related area has identified low coolant inlet temperature, split cooling system and control of lubricant oil temperature as the features which held such potential. These features are further studied by implementing them on a mass produced Diesel engine in an experimental investigation. Although the engine response on fuel consumption and NOx output for most of the test conditions follow established trends with regard operating temperature, where higher operating temperatures increase NOx output but lowers fuel consumption, there are few unusual responses which can only be accounted by minor change in combustion characteristics. To evaluate the effect of these features, the resulting engine responses from various thermal conditions is compared against those of conventional engine control parameters. It is found that changing the thermal settings can lower the engine fuel consumption much more effectively than changing the settings of engine control parameter but the situation is reversed in the case of NOx output. Further, net improvement offered by the thermal variation is established by integrating the effect of the thermal variation within the flexibility in the fuel injection timing to produce optimised solutions. The optimised solutions indicate that there is a specific set of optimum operating temperature for the cylinder head and engine block every engine speed and load condition. The trend of the required average metal temperature required for <b>optimum</b> <b>engine</b> <b>performance</b> indicate the need for an active controlled engine cooling system in Diesel engine for enhanced performance.

In line with national efforts {{to come up with}} energy sources that are both environmentally friendly and sustainable, this work was carried out to compare performance properties of native crude marula (Sclerocarya birrea) seed oil and petrodiesel fuel on a variable compression engine test rig with automatic data acquisition set up. Parameters such as engine torque, brake power and specific fuel consumption were measured at different loads for the two fuels. The results indicate that engine performance when powered with crude marula oil compares favourable with those for petrodiesel. Optimum numerical values for engine torque, brake power and specific fuel consumption were 28. 2 Nm, 6. 27 W and 0. 34 g/kWh respectively for petrodiesel, and 22. 7 Nm, 6. 6 W, 0. 33 g/kWh respectively for crude marula oil.

40|$|This paper summarises {{the work}} of a 5 -year {{research}} programme into the heat transfer within cavities adjacent to the main annulus of a gas turbine. The work has been a collaboration between several gas turbine manufacturers, also involving a number of universities working together. The principal objective of the study has been to develop and validate computer modelling methods of the cooling flow distribution and heat transfer management, in the environs of multi-stage turbine disc rims and blade fixings, with a view to maintaining component and sub-system integrity, whilst achieving <b>optimum</b> <b>engine</b> <b>performance</b> and minimising emissions. A fully coupled analysis capability has been developed using combinations of commercially available and in-house computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and finite element (FE) thermo-mechanical modelling codes. The main objective of the methodology is to help decide on optimum cooling configurations for disc temperature, stress and life considerations. The new capability also gives us an effective means of validating the method by direct use of disc temperature measurements, where otherwise, additional and difficult to obtain parameters, such as reliable heat flux measurements, would be considered necessary for validation of the use of CFD for convective heat transfer. A two-stage turbine test rig has been developed and improved to provide good quality thermal boundary condition data with which to validate the analysis methods. A cooling flow optimisation study has also been performed to support a re-design of the turbine stator well cavity, to maximise the effectiveness of cooling air supplied to the disc rim region.

40|$|Renewable {{alternatives}} such as biofuels and optimisation of {{the engine}} operating parameters can enhance engine performance and reduce emissions. The temperature {{of the engine}} coolant {{is known to have}} significant influence on engine performance and emissions. Whereas much existing literature describes the effects of coolant temperature in engines using fossil derived fuels, very few studies have investigated these effects when biofuel is used as an alternative fuel. Jatropha oil is a non-edible biofuel which can substitute fossil diesel for compression ignition (CI) engine use. However, due to the high viscosity of Jatropha oil, technique such as transesterification, preheating the oil, mixing with other fuel is recommended for improved combustion and reduced emissions. In this study, Jatropha oil was blended separately with ethanol and butanol, at ratios of 80 : 20 and 70 : 30. The fuel properties of all four blends were measured and compared with diesel and jatropha oil. It was found that the 80 % jatropha oil + 20 % butanol blend was the most suitable alternative, as its properties were closest to that of diesel. A 2 cylinder Yanmar engine was used; the cooling water temperature was varied between 50 °C and 95 °C. In general, it was found that when the temperature of the cooling water was increased, the combustion process enhanced for both diesel and Jatropha-Butanol blend. The CO 2 emissions for both diesel and biofuel blend were observed to increase with temperature. As a result CO, O 2 and lambda values were observed to decrease when cooling water temperature increased. When the engine was operated using diesel, NOX emissions correlated in an opposite manner to smoke opacity; however, when the biofuel blend was used, NOX emissions and smoke opacity correlated in an identical manner. The brake thermal efficiencies were found to increase slightly as the temperature was increased. In contrast, for all fuels, the volumetric efficiency was observed to decrease as the coolant temperature was increased. Brake specific fuel consumption was observed to decrease as the temperature was increased and was higher on average when the biofuel was used, in comparison to diesel. The study concludes that the effects of engine coolant temperature on engine performance and emission characteristics differ between biofuel blend and fossil diesel operation. The coolant temperature needs to be optimised {{depending on the type of}} biofuel for <b>optimum</b> <b>engine</b> <b>performance</b> and reduced emissions...|$|E
