In addition, a vaned diffuser was designed to match this impeller and also to be compatible with an existing 6 : 1 compressor test rig. The mechanical integrity of this design was verified by analysis. Hardware was procured and inspected to insure conformity with design tolerances.

40|$|LectureDirect Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS) is an {{additive}} manufacturing process that utilizes a high-powered laser {{to build up}} a metal part by selectively melting thin layers of metal powder. This process is attractive for the manufacturing of parts with complex geometry such as closed centrifugal compressor impellers. DMLS allows closed impellers to be made in a single piece and eliminates the shroud joint that results from two-piece manufacturing processes. Using a monolithic impeller can allow higher tip speeds with improved fatigue characteristics compared with two-piece and three-piece designs. Prototype parts can be made more economically than investment casting when considering the tooling costs. Manufacturing costs for DMLS parts are marginally higher than for two-piece machined impellers, but qualification efforts for the braze/weld joint at the cover are circumvented. The DMLS process introduces several factors that must be considered in the impeller design to achieve a successful build with the proper strength and surface finish. This paper describes the authors? experience with manufacturing and testing multiple closed impeller designs constructed from Inconel 718, 17 - 4 PH Stainless Steel, and Titanium 6 Al- 4 V. A detailed discussion of design factors and manufacturing experience with a DMLS vendor is included for the various metals. Dimensional, post-test destructive inspection, and material test results are provided showing that the DMLS process can produce an impeller with good dimensional accuracy, surface finish, and material strength. Finally, <b>overspeed</b> <b>test</b> results up to maximum tip speeds of over 1400 ft/s (425 m/s) and aerodynamic performance test results are presented and discussed...|$|E

50|$|Cleaner {{and more}} compact than most {{aircraft}} in its class, the 101 displayed relatively high performance when first flown in 1927. However, it {{was rejected by}} the Air Ministry due to its wood construction, which was seen as out of date. No other buyers could be found and no more aircraft were produced. Continued as a private venture, it first flew at Filton on 8 August 1927, piloted by Cyril Uwins, registered G-EBOW. With the VIA powerplant, Uwins achieved second place in the 1928 King's Cup race at an average speed of 159.9 mph. Subsequently used as a company hack and as a testbed for the 485 hp Bristol Mercury II nine-cylinder radial, it suffered wing centre section failure on 29 November 1929 while being subjected to engine <b>overspeeding</b> <b>tests,</b> the pilot, C. R. L. Shaw, bailing out successfully. This was the last wooden Bristol fighter built.|$|R
40|$|The {{major focus}} for {{continued}} {{development of the}} Numerical Evaluation of Stochastic Structures Under Stress (NESSUS) codes is in support of system testing and certification of advanced propulsion systems. Propulsion system testing has evolved over the years from tests designed to show success, to tests designed to reveal reliability issues before service use. Such test conditions as performance envelope corners, high rotor imbalance, power dwells, and <b>overspeed</b> <b>tests</b> are designed to shake out problems that {{can be associated with}} low and high cycle fatigue, creep, and stress rupture, bearing durability, and the like. Subsystem testing supports system certification by standing as an early evaluation of the same durability and reliability concerns as for the entire system. The NESSUS software system is being further developed to support the definition of rigorous subsystem and system test definition and reliability certification. The principal technical issues are outlined which are related to system reliability, including key technology issues such as failure mode synergism, sequential failure mechanisms, and fault tree definition...|$|R

Strength and fatigue <b>tests,</b> <b>overspeed</b> and field <b>tests</b> as well as metallographic checks were made {{in addition to the}} finite element calculations to optimize the stress under centrifugal forces in an appropriate way for the materials involved.

40|$|The {{investigations}} {{were aimed}} at determining the causal relation between {{the size of a}} formed crack and the amount of acoustic energy emitted during its formation, as well as between the size of the crack and the residual strength of a ceramic-bonded grinding wheel material, i. e. its time to failure under constant load conditions. With regard to the correlation between crack size and acoustic emission the area of the crack was shown to be proportional to the amount of acoustic energy emitted during its formation. The laws of linear-elastic fracture mechanics apply to the subject grinding wheel material. The relationship between acoustic emission and the residual strength, or time to failure, of bend test bars was derived {{on the basis of the}} determined proportionality constants and material parameters. The derived formulae indicate the residual strength level or time to failure to be anticipated, when a certain amount of acoustic energy is emitted during <b>overspeed</b> <b>testing.</b> Experiments i nvolving artificially induced cracks were conducted as a means of verifying the correctness of the theoretically determined correlation. These results demonstrate conclusively that AEA enables the reliable detection of strength-reducing crack formation and hence, that is suitable for use in the testing of grinding wheels. Combining AEA with a proof test yields a new concept for the testing of grinding wheels. The results were obtained on a particular type of grinding wheel that satisfied all preconditions with regard to characterization via unequivocal material constants...|$|R
40|$|Boresonic {{examinations}} of older vintage steam turbine rotor forgings typically {{result in a}} large number of ultrasonic beam signals or “hits ” from inclusions and porosities (lack of ingot consolidation) associated with steel making practices of the late 40 ’s and early 50 ’s. This makes the task of processing and evaluating the data extremely difficult, often leading to very pessimistic estimates of final flaw size after “linkup ” which results in a recommendation to retire the rotor from service. An alternate flaw-tolerance approach to evaluation and processing of a large amount of boresonic data for a 50 ’s vintage LP rotor which was condemned by an OEM, was developed and utilized to justify continued operation of this rotor. Tolerable flaw sizes were calculated for a number of flaw shapes (aspect ratios) and distances from the bore surface {{along the length of the}} rotor. Boresonic data was then screened to identify critical locations in the rotor with potentially rejectable flaws. These locations were further characterized using ASME Code Inservice Inspection techniques employed in the commercial nuclear industry. This technique was used to analyze and disposition all significant ultrasonic and magnetic particle indications. A review of prior metallurgical examination results for near-bore indications was also performed, indicating no evidence of linkup or growth of these small flaws. It was therefore concluded that the rotor could be returned to service as-is for 10 additional years based on a conservatively estimated number of operating cycles and <b>overspeed</b> <b>tests</b> during that period. BACKGROUND The unit is an early 1950 ’s vintage with the LP rotor forging likely made in the late 40 ’s or early 50 ’s. A cross-section of the rotor HP and LP tandem-compound sections is shown in Figure 1. The LP rotor section, to which the flaw tolerance approach was first applied, is the subject of this paper. A brief summary of the inspection history for the LP rotor is given below...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate a potential boost pump overspeed condition which could exist on the Titan/Centaur launch vehicle after main engine shut-off. Preliminary analyses indicated that the acceleration imparted to the unloaded boost pump-turbine assembly, caused by purging residual hydrogen peroxide from the turbine supply lines, {{could result in a}} pump-turbine <b>overspeed.</b> Previous <b>test</b> experience indicated that turbine damage occurs at speeds in excess of 75, 000 rpm. Detailed theoretical analyses, in conjunction with pump tests, were conducted to establish the maximum pump-turbine speed at main engine shut-off. The analyses predicted a maximum speed of 68, 000 rpm. Testing showed the pump-turbine speed to be 66, 700 rpm in the overspeed condition. Inasmuch as both the analysis and <b>tests</b> showed the <b>overspeed</b> to be sufficiently less than the speed at which damage could occur, it was concluded that no corrective action would be required for the launch vehicle...|$|R
40|$|LecturePg. 71 - 86. With {{turbine rotors}} of low shaft {{elasticity}} (large diameter and small bearing span) {{the increase in}} amplitude at the first point of shaft resonance in the speed range is generally slight. Consequently no particular {{attention is paid to}} this point of resonance either at the rotor design stage or during operation of the turbine. However, if a two-cylinder condensing turbine has {{to be replaced by a}} single-cylinder machine of similar high efficiency, it is necessary to have a drum-type rotor of large bearing span and small diameter in the region of the first drum stages, and large diameter in the region of the low-pressure stages. This type of rotor has a markedly higher shaft elasticity compared with the rotors of the two-cylinder machine. A rotor of this type was recently built and put into service. This paper describes the rotor and gives its calculated dynamic characteristics. Since operation in the vicinity of the first resonant speed is of greatest interest the paper describes the test results for the properly balanced condition, and for the artificially heavily unbalanced condition. The shaft vibration values measured during the test-run are compared with the assessment criteria for rotor dynamic performance used at present. In order to obtain valid theoretical statements for even more slender rotors, the shaft elasticity was systematically increased in theoretical calculations (by increasing the bearing span). The effects of the shaft elasticity on the magnitude of the resonant speeds, the maximum vibration amplitudes and the stability limit (oil whip) are described. In its original form, the drum-type rotor studied here has only one output shaft coupling. For even higher turbine powers, however, heavy couplings on both shaft ends are necessary. In order to examine the dynamic behavior of these rotors, the original rotor was fitted with an extra mass at the usually free shaft-end to simulate a second coupling. For this rotor, the same calculations and measurements were carried out in the <b>overspeed</b> <b>testing</b> pit as were for the original rotor. The results are given and discussed. A further point examined with this rotor is whether there is a linear relationship between the dynamic bearing force and the magnitude of the unbalance...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPower {{generation}} in thermal stations typically relies on large steam turbines. The {{corrosion resistant steel}} blades used in the last stage of a typical low pressure rotor set are approximately 1 m long and experience high centrifugal loading during service. They operate in a wet steam environment, at approximately 120  °C while rotating at 3000 rpm, and failure modes are typically either stress corrosion cracking or corrosion fatigue. The blades are retained by a fir tree root which is typically shot-peened to generate compressive residual stresses that resist crack initiation. Finite element (FE) modelling has indicated that, {{in the absence of}} shot-peening, stresses above yield are induced at the fir tree root during operation. To date, no systematic information has been obtained on the level of residual stresses induced in the fir tree by shot-peening and their relaxation, nor are there any guidelines as to the magnitude of residual stresses necessary to ensure integrity of the turbine over a life span of at least twenty years. At least one of these blades has failed in recent years causing a catastrophic failure and severe damage to the turbinegenerator set. This paper will report results from a comprehensive program of residual stress measurements at the shot-peened fir tree roots of service blades, and in specimens that simulate the root, using diffraction data from laboratory and synchrotron X-ray radiation (SXRD). Shot-peening coverage between 75 % and 200 % was used and stresses were measured up to 5 mm into the blades/specimens. Measurements were made in the as-peened condition and after applying cyclic stresses representative of <b>overspeed</b> proof <b>testing</b> and service operation. The results will be used to calibrate FE modelling of residual stresses and as input into fatigue life prediction...|$|R
40|$|Power {{generation}} in thermal stations typically relies on large steam turbines. The {{corrosion resistant steel}} blades used in the last stage of a typical low pressure rotor set are approximately 1 m long and experience high centrifugal loading during service. They operate in a wet steam environment, at approximately 60 °C while rotating at 3000 rpm, and failure modes include high and low cycle fatigue, stress corrosion cracking or corrosion fatigue. The blades are retained by a fir tree root which is normally shot-peened to generate compressive residual stresses that resist crack initiation. Finite element (FE) modelling has indicated that, {{in the absence of}} shot-peening, stresses above yield are induced at the fir tree root during operation. In a shot-peened blade these lead to relaxation of the shot peening residual stresses. To date, no systematic information has been obtained on the level of residual stresses induced in the fir tree by shot-peening and their subsequent relaxation during service loading, nor are there any guidelines as to the magnitude of residual stresses necessary to ensure integrity of the turbine over a life span of at least twenty years.
