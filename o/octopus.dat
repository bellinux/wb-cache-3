5|$|Due to the {{expansion}} of the company's businesses, <b>Octopus</b> Holdings Limited was established in 2005 and <b>Octopus</b> Cards Limited was restructured as its subsidiary. The business of <b>Octopus</b> Cards Limited, being a payment business, is regulated by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, while Octopus' non-payment businesses are not subjected to such regulation and are operated by other subsidiaries of <b>Octopus</b> Holdings Limited that are independent of <b>Octopus</b> Cards Limited. As of 2007, <b>Octopus</b> Holdings Limited was a joint-venture business owned by five transport companies in Hong Kong; 54.4% by the MTR Corporation, 22.1% by the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation, 12.4% by Kowloon Motor Bus, 5% by Citybus, and 3.1% by New World First Bus. Since the Government of Hong Kong owns 76.54% of the MTR Corporation (as of 31 December 2005) and wholly owns the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation, it is the biggest effective shareholder of <b>Octopus</b> Holdings Limited, and thus also the biggest effective shareholder of <b>Octopus</b> Cards Limited.|$|E
5|$|In June 2007, {{a new set}} {{of limited}} edition {{products}} was announced, featuring Mini <b>Octopus</b> cards and Child <b>Octopus</b> Wristbands. The Mini <b>Octopus</b> cards, available in Adult and Elder editions, measure 4.7cm by 3cm (1.85in by 1.18in) and work as regular (anonymous) Adult and Elder, respectively, <b>Octopus</b> cards. The Child <b>Octopus</b> Wristbands are plastic wristbands with a watch-like round face and work as regular Child <b>Octopus</b> cards. The same value-adding abilities and limitations as the aforementioned watches and mobile phone apply.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Octopus</b> card uses {{encryption}} for all airborne {{communication and}} performs mutual authentication between {{the card and}} reader based on the ISO 9798-2 three-pass mutual authentication protocol. In other words, data communications are only established when the card and reader have mutually authenticated based on a shared secret access key. This means that {{the security of the}} <b>Octopus</b> card system would be jeopardized should the access key be exposed. A stolen <b>Octopus</b> card reader could be used with stolen <b>Octopus</b> software, for example, to add value (up to HK$1,000) to any <b>Octopus</b> card without authorization. Nevertheless, as of 2003, the <b>Octopus</b> card and system have never been successfully hacked.|$|E
50|$|The player {{uses the}} Wii Remote {{to control a}} 2x2 cursor over a field of colored <b>octopuses.</b> Pressing the A button causes the <b>octopuses</b> under the cursor to rotate counter-clockwise. Numbered nets are {{scattered}} around the playing field. If the player arranges a number of same-colored <b>octopuses</b> under the net, the <b>octopuses</b> under the net, {{as well as any}} other <b>octopuses</b> of the same color which are connected orthogonally, are removed.|$|R
50|$|Umbrella <b>octopuses</b> (family Opisthoteuthidae) are a {{group of}} pelagic <b>octopuses.</b> Umbrella <b>octopuses</b> are {{characterized}} by a web of skin between the tentacles, causing them to somewhat resemble an opened umbrella when the tentacles are spread.|$|R
5000|$|Chambers 21st Century Dictionary and the Compact Oxford Dictionary list only <b>octopuses,</b> {{although}} the latter notes that octopodes is [...] "still occasionally used"; the British National Corpus has 29 instances of <b>octopuses,</b> 11 of octopi and 4 of octopodes. Merriam-Webster 11th Collegiate Dictionary lists <b>octopuses</b> and octopi, in that order; Webster's New World College Dictionary lists <b>octopuses,</b> octopi and octopodes (in that order).|$|R
5|$|The <b>Octopus</b> {{system was}} {{designed}} by Australia-based company ERG Group (now Vix Technology). The company was selected in 1994 to lead {{the development of the}} <b>Octopus</b> project and was responsible for the building and installation of the components of the <b>Octopus</b> system. Operations, maintenance and development was undertaken by <b>Octopus</b> Cards Limited, and in 2005, it replaced the central transaction clearing house with its own system.|$|E
5|$|Usage of the <b>Octopus</b> {{card was}} {{extended}} to Macau and the Chinese city of Shenzhen in 2006. In collaboration with China UnionPay, <b>Octopus</b> Cards Limited introduced <b>Octopus</b> card usage to two Fairwood restaurants in Shenzhen in August 2006. In 2008, five Café de Coral locations in Shenzhen also started accepting <b>Octopus.</b> Value cannot be reloaded to <b>Octopus</b> cards in Shenzhen, but the Automatic Add Value Service is available to automatically deduct money value from a customer's credit card to reload an <b>Octopus</b> card. The two Fairwood restaurants in Shenzhen that were enabled for <b>Octopus</b> card payments are located at Luohu Commercial City and Shenzhen Railway Station. Shenzhen became the first city outside Hong Kong in which <b>Octopus</b> cards may be accepted as payment. In Macau, the <b>Octopus</b> card was introduced in December 2006 when two Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants in the territory adopted its usage as payment. Similar to its usage in Shenzhen, an <b>Octopus</b> card may not be reloaded in Macau, and the currency exchange rate between the Macanese pataca and the Hong Kong dollar when using an <b>Octopus</b> card is MOP1:HKD1. The two Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants in Macau that adopted the <b>Octopus</b> card for payment are located at the Rua Do Campo and the Sands Casino.|$|E
5|$|Allen has loaned <b>Octopus</b> for {{a number}} of operations. Most notably, <b>Octopus</b> was used in the search for a missing American pilot and two {{officers}} whose plane disappeared off Palau and the study of a rare fish called a coelacanth among many others.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Octopuses</b> {{are some}} of the rarest marine fossils, since most species have no hard {{structures}} apart from a beak. An <b>octopus's</b> corpse cannot usually survive long enough to become fossilized, which is why the discovery of well-preserved <b>octopuses</b> in Lebanon in 2009 was remarkable. Dirk Fuchs of the Freie University Berlin said about these 95-million-year-old fossil <b>octopuses</b> found in Lebanon: ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Octopuses</b> are {{sometimes}} eaten live, {{a practice that}} is controversial due to scientific evidence that <b>octopuses</b> experience pain.|$|R
50|$|The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife (<b>Octopus(es)</b> {{and shell}} diver), {{also known as}} Girl Diver and <b>Octopuses,</b> Diver and Two <b>Octopuses,</b> etc., is a woodblock-printed design by the Japanese artist Hokusai. It is {{included}} in Kinoe no Komatsu (Young Pines), a three-volume book of shunga erotica first published in 1814, and has become Hokusai's most famous shunga design. Playing with themes popular in Japanese art, it depicts a young ama diver entwined sexually {{with a pair of}} <b>octopuses.</b>|$|R
5|$|Ancient {{seafaring}} {{people were}} aware of the <b>octopus,</b> as evidenced by certain artworks and designs. For example, a stone carving found in the archaeological recovery from Bronze Age Minoan Crete at Knossos (1900 – 1100 BC) has a depiction of a fisherman carrying an <b>octopus.</b> The terrifyingly powerful Gorgon of Greek mythology has been thought to have been inspired by the <b>octopus</b> or squid, the <b>octopus</b> itself representing the severed head of Medusa, the beak as the protruding tongue and fangs, and its tentacles as the snakes. The Kraken are legendary sea monsters of giant proportions said to dwell off the coasts of Norway and Greenland, usually portrayed in art as a giant <b>octopus</b> attacking ships. Linnaeus included it in the first edition of his 1735 Systema Naturae. A Hawaiian creation myth says that the present cosmos is the last of a series which arose in stages from the ruins of the previous universe. In this account, the <b>octopus</b> is the lone survivor of the previous, alien universe. The Akkorokamui is a gigantic octopus-like monster from Ainu folklore.|$|E
5|$|Deimatic {{behaviour}} {{is found}} in cephalopods including the common cuttlefish Sepia officinalis, squid such as the Caribbean reef squid (Sepioteuthis sepioidea) and bigfin reef squid (Sepioteuthis lessoniana), octopuses including the common <b>octopus</b> <b>Octopus</b> vulgaris and the Atlantic white-spotted <b>octopus</b> (<b>Octopus</b> macropus), and the paper nautilus (Argonauta argo). Deimatic cephalopod displays involve suddenly creating bold stripes, often reinforced by stretching out the animal's arms, fins or web {{to make it look}} as big and threatening as possible.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority {{granted a}} deposit-taking company license to the operator, {{removing}} previous restrictions that prohibited <b>Octopus</b> from generating more than 15 {{percent of its}} turnover from non-transit-related functions. This allowed the <b>Octopus</b> card to be widely adopted for non-transit-related sales transactions. On 29 June 2003, the <b>Octopus</b> card found another application when the Hong Kong Government started to replace all its 18,000 parking meters with a new <b>Octopus</b> card-operated system. The replacement was completed on 21 November 2004.|$|E
5000|$|In incirrate <b>octopuses</b> {{it is one}} of {{arm pair}} III. Rare {{examples}} of double and bilateral hectocotylization have also been recorded in incirrate <b>octopuses.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>Octopuses</b> {{oriented}} {{towards their}} image in a mirror, {{but there is}} no difference in their behaviour in this condition, compared with a view of other <b>octopuses.</b>|$|R
50|$|And {{while most}} <b>octopuses</b> are cannibalistic, {{and have to}} {{exercise}} extreme caution while mating, these <b>octopuses</b> mate with their ventral sides touching, pressing their beaks and suckers together in an intimate embrace.|$|R
5|$|In 2015, at {{the initial}} stage, card holders of first {{generation}} cardholder may voluntarily replace their cards at <b>Octopus</b> Service Point without charge. In 2017, the final call on card replacement is launched by <b>Octopus</b> company, or first generation card will be unusable by stages starting from 2018 January. Cardholder can replace these cards without charge at MTR or KMB Customer Service Centre, and <b>Octopus</b> Service Point.|$|E
5|$|Initially, <b>Octopus</b> Cards Limited, {{then known}} as Creative Star Limited, was {{restricted}} to having at most 15 percent of <b>Octopus</b> card transactions for non-transport transactions, as it operated under the Hong Kong government's Banking Ordinance. On 20 April 2000, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority authorised the company for deposit-taking, which allowed for 50 percent of <b>Octopus</b> card transactions to be unrelated to transport. HK$416 million (US$53.3 million) is deposited in the <b>Octopus</b> system {{at any given time}} as of 2000.|$|E
5|$|<b>Octopus</b> cards also {{double as}} access control cards in {{buildings}} and for school administrative functions. At certain office buildings, residential buildings, and schools, {{use of an}} <b>Octopus</b> card is required for entry.|$|E
5000|$|Live <b>octopuses</b> are {{eaten in}} several {{countries}} around the world, including the US. [...] Animal welfare groups have objected to this practice {{on the basis that}} <b>octopuses</b> can experience pain. [...] In support of this, since September 2010, <b>octopuses</b> being used for scientific purposes in the EU are protected by EU Directive 2010/63/EU [...] "as there is scientific evidence of their ability to experience pain, suffering, distress and lasting harm." [...] In the UK, this means that <b>octopuses</b> used for scientific purposes must be killed humanely, according to prescribed methods (known as [...] "Schedule 1 methods of euthanasia").|$|R
50|$|Cirrina or Cirrata is a {{suborder}} {{and one of}} the {{two main}} divisions of <b>octopuses.</b> Cirrate <b>octopuses</b> have a small, internal shell and two fins on their head, while their sister suborder Incirrina has neither.|$|R
50|$|Members of {{the genus}} Amphioctopus reside in {{tropical}} and subtropical waters. These <b>octopuses</b> are found primarily in the Pacific and Indian Oceans but representatives {{can also be found}} in the Atlantic. They are characterized by arms that are about two or three times their mantle length with deep lateral webs and very shallow dorsal webs. This genus can be further divided into two subgroups, one group with ocellate <b>octopuses,</b> the other with non-ocellate <b>octopuses.</b>|$|R
5|$|Octopuses {{also have}} an {{excellent}} sense of touch. The octopus's suction cups are equipped with chemoreceptors so the <b>octopus</b> can taste what it touches. <b>Octopus</b> arms do not become tangled or stuck to each other because the sensors recognise <b>octopus</b> skin and prevent self-attachment.|$|E
5|$|Octopuses have a {{relatively}} short life expectancy; some species live {{for as little as}} six months. The giant Pacific <b>octopus,</b> one of the two largest species of <b>octopus,</b> may live for as much as five years. <b>Octopus</b> lifespan is limited by reproduction: males can live for only a few months after mating, and females die shortly after their eggs hatch. <b>Octopus</b> reproductive organs mature due to the hormonal influence of the optic gland but result in the inactivation of their digestive glands, typically causing the <b>octopus</b> to eventually die from starvation. Experimental removal of both optic glands after spawning was found to result in the cessation of broodiness, the resumption of feeding, increased growth, and greatly extended lifespans.|$|E
5|$|The MTR usually charges {{less for}} {{journeys}} made using an <b>Octopus</b> card instead of conventional single-journey tickets. For example, the adult fare {{of a single}} journey from Chai Wan to Tung Chung is HK$25.20 with an <b>Octopus</b> card, and HK$28 with a single journey ticket. Other public transport operators also offer intermittent discounts for using <b>Octopus</b> cards on higher fares and round-trip transits on select routes.|$|E
50|$|In a {{study on}} social learning, common <b>octopuses</b> (observers) were allowed to watch other <b>octopuses</b> (demonstrators) select one of two objects that {{differed}} only in colour. Subsequently, the observers consistently selected the same object as did the demonstrators.|$|R
50|$|Cirrate <b>octopuses</b> {{possess a}} {{well-developed}} internal shell that supports their muscular swimming fins. This {{is in contrast}} to the more familiar, finless, incirrate <b>octopuses,</b> in which the shell remnant is either present as a pair of stylets or absent altogether.|$|R
50|$|<b>Octopuses</b> {{are widely}} {{reported}} {{as examples of}} an invertebrate that exhibits flexibility in tool use. For example, veined <b>octopuses</b> (Amphioctopus marginatus) retrieve discarded coconut shells, manipulate them, transport them some distance, and then re-assemble them {{to use as a}} shelter.|$|R
5|$|The <b>Octopus</b> {{card system}} is owned and {{operated}} by <b>Octopus</b> Cards Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of <b>Octopus</b> Holdings Limited. The company was founded as Creative Star Limited in 1994 to oversee {{the development and implementation of}} the <b>Octopus</b> card system, and was renamed as its current name of <b>Octopus</b> Cards Limited in 2002. Creative Star was formed as a joint-venture company by five major transit companies in Hong Kong—MTR Corporation, Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation, Kowloon Motor Bus, Citybus, and Hongkong and Yaumati Ferry. In January 2001, the shares of Hongkong and Yaumati Ferry in the company was transferred to New World First Bus and New World First Ferry. In the same year, together with MTR Corporation, the company was transformed from its previous non-profit making status to a profit making enterprise.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Octopus</b> {{system was}} quickly adopted by other Creative Star joint venture partners, and KMB {{reported}} that by 2000, most bus journeys were completed using an <b>Octopus</b> card, with few coins used. Boarding a bus in Hong Kong without using the <b>Octopus</b> card requires giving exact change, making it cumbersome compared {{to using the}} <b>Octopus</b> card. By November 1998, 4.6 million cards were issued, and this rose to 9 million by January 2002.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} marine animals possess active {{camouflage}} through {{their ability to}} change colour rapidly. Several bottom-living fish such as the flounder can hide themselves effectively against a variety of backgrounds. Many cephalopods including <b>octopus,</b> cuttlefish, and squid similarly use colour change, in their case both for camouflage and signalling. For example, the big blue <b>octopus,</b> <b>Octopus</b> cyanea, hunts during the day, and can match itself to the colours and textures of its surroundings, both to avoid predators and to enable it to approach prey. It can perfectly resemble a rock or a coral it is hiding beside. When necessary, in order to scare away a potential predator, it can display markings which resemble eyes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Octopuses</b> show {{trade-offs}} {{in their}} motivation {{to avoid being}} stung by sea anemones. <b>Octopuses</b> frequently predate hermit crabs, however, they change their hunting strategy when the crabs place an anemone on their shell as protection. <b>Octopuses</b> attempt various different methods such as using only a single arm, moving below the anemone or blowing jets of water at it. The trade-off is that they attempt to avoid the anemone stings by using methods that are less effective than they would usually use for predating the hermit crab.|$|R
50|$|Octopus' Garden: A room {{dedicated}} to <b>octopuses.</b>|$|R
5|$|Strategies {{to defend}} {{themselves}} against predators include the expulsion of ink, the use of camouflage and threat displays, their ability to jet quickly through the water, {{and their ability to}} hide. All <b>octopuses</b> are venomous, but only the blue-ringed <b>octopuses</b> are known to be deadly to humans.|$|R
