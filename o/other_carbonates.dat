50|$|Once {{the initial}} {{carbonate}} has been produced, {{it may be}} converted to <b>other</b> <b>carbonates</b> by transesterification. A more nucleophilic alcohol will displace a less nucleophilic alcohol. In other words, aliphatic alcohols will displace phenols from aryl carbonates. If the departing alcohol is more volatile, the equilibrium may be driven by distilling that off.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two main}} {{industrial}} ways of preparing carbonate esters: the reaction of an alcohol (or phenol) with phosgene (phosgenation), and the reaction of an alcohol with carbon monoxide and an oxidizer (oxidative carbonylation). <b>Other</b> <b>carbonate</b> esters may subsequently be prepared by transesterification.|$|R
50|$|Sinkholes {{are common}} where the rock below the land surface is {{limestone}} or <b>other</b> <b>carbonate</b> rock, salt beds, {{or in other}} soluble rocks, such as gypsum, that can be dissolved naturally by circulating ground water.

50|$|Caesium {{carbonate}} or cesium carbonate {{is a white}} crystalline solid compound. Caesium carbonate has a high solubility in polar solvents such as water, {{alcohol and}} DMF.

50|$|Like {{most other}} {{sedimentary}} rocks, most limestone {{is composed of}} grains. Most grains in limestone are skeletal fragments of marine organisms such as coral or foraminifera. <b>Other</b> <b>carbonate</b> grains comprising limestones are ooids, peloids, intraclasts, and extraclasts. These organisms secrete shells made of aragonite or calcite, and leave these shells behind when they die.|$|R

5000|$|A calanque ( [...] , [...] "inlet"; calanca, pl. calanche; calanca, pl. calancas) is a narrow, steep-walled inlet that is {{developed}} in limestone, dolomite, or <b>other</b> <b>carbonate</b> strata and found along the Mediterranean coast.

50|$|A {{petrocalcic horizon}} is a {{diagnostic}} horizon in USDA soil taxonomy. They are formed when secondary Calcium Carbonate or <b>other</b> <b>carbonates</b> accumulate in the subsoil {{to the extent}} that the soil becomes cemented into a hardpan. Petrocalcic horizons are similar to a duripan and a petrogypsic horizon in how they affect land-use limitations. They can occur in conjunction with duripans where the conditions are right and there are enough free carbonates in the soil. Calcium Carbonates are found in alkaline soils, which are typical of arid and semiarid climates. A common field test for the presence of carbonates is application of hydrochloric acid to the soil, which indicates by fizzing and bubbling the presence of calcium carbonates.|$|E
50|$|Listwanite (also {{sometimes}} spelled listvenite, listvanite, or listwaenite) {{is unusual}} rock type that forms when ultramafic rocks (most commonly mantle peridotites) are completely carbonated. The pyroxene and olivine minerals found in peridotite commonly alter to form carbonate and serpentine minerals. However, peridotites {{are usually not}} completely carbonated. Rather, they typically contain carbonate veins (primarily magnesite; also calcite, dolomite, and <b>other</b> <b>carbonates).</b> Complete carbonation of peridotite means that every single atom of magnesium and calcium {{as well as some}} of the iron atoms has combined with CO2 to form secondary carbonate minerals such a magnesite and calcite. The silica atoms in listwanite are found in quartz. Thus, liswanites consist of quartz (a rusty red color) and carbonate and also sometimes talc and Cr-muscovite (a mineral known as mariposite/fuchsite).|$|E
50|$|The {{overwhelming}} {{part of the}} Zillertal Alps {{consists of}} the crystalline primary rocks, plutons and metamorphic rock, that {{do not support the}} formation of caves. The only exceptions are pockets of rock capable of karstification such as limestone, dolomite, gypsum and <b>other</b> <b>carbonates.</b> These pockets are generally of quite low thickness, and only allow small caves to be formed. The creation of caves also requires water solubility. The Spannagel Cave has arisen in a large vein of Jurassic calcite marble of the Hochstegen Formation, a marble with over 90% total carbonate content, that runs through the slate mantle of the Western Tauern window. The formation of this extensive cave as a result of geological corrosion (and mixing corrosion) is explained by the tectonics of the region.|$|E
30|$|The {{carbonation}} of Portland cement is {{a naturally}} occurring process during the ageing of a concrete structure; {{it changes the}} {{physical and chemical properties}} of the cement. During the carbonation process CaCO 3 is formed and <b>other</b> <b>carbonate</b> phases are expected to be negligible. The carbonation may also induce corrosion of steel reinforcing bars, due to the reduction of alkalinity, which may cause severe damage to a structure.|$|R
40|$|High-resolution spectroscopic {{measurements}} of the 11 micron continuum emission from NGC 7027 indicate that MgCO 3 is a constituent of the dust in the nebula. <b>Other</b> <b>carbonate</b> compounds may also be present in concentrations approximately 1 order of magnitude below that of MgCO 3.

50|$|Where {{crystals}} such as zircon with uranium and thorium inclusions do not occur, a better, more inclusive, {{model of}} the data must be applied. Uranium-lead dating techniques have also been applied to other minerals such as calcite/aragonite and <b>other</b> <b>carbonate</b> minerals. These types of minerals often produce lower precision ages than igneous and metamorphic minerals traditionally used for age dating, but are {{more common in the}} geologic record.|$|R
50|$|These rocks contain also {{iron oxides}} (usually titaniferous), apatite, {{sometimes}} sphene, augite, and olivine. The hornblende and biotite are brown or greenish-brown, {{and as a}} rule their crystals even when small are very perfect and give the thin section views an easily recognizable character. Green hornblende occurs {{in some of these}} rocks. Augite exists as euhedral crystals of pale green color, often zonal and readily weathering. Olivine in the fresh state is rare; it forms rounded, corroded grains; in many cases it is decomposed to green or colorless hornblende in radiating nests (pilite). The plagioclase occurs as small rectangular crystals; orthoclase may have similar shapes or may be fibrous and grouped in sheaf-like aggregates that are narrow in the middle and spread out towards both ends. As all lamprophyres are prone to alteration by weathering a great abundance of secondary minerals is usually found in them; the principal are calcite and <b>other</b> <b>carbonates,</b> limonite, chlorite, quartz and kaolin.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} Mg++ ion on the {{solubility}} of calcium carbonate was determined using P. K. Weyls 2 ̆ 2 carbonate saturometer. 2 ̆ 2 The amount of calcium carbonate precipitated or dissolved was measured for five series of waters when equilibrated with solid carbonate. It {{was found that}} the effect of Mg++ ion on solubility depend upon the nature of the solid phase: surface area, coprecipitated Mg++, minerology, etc. Pure low area calcite showed an increase in solubility which could be explained by ion-pair formation, while its <b>other</b> <b>carbonates</b> departed from this behavior...|$|E
40|$|Small amounts (1 - 3 wt. %) of endogenic {{siderite}} (FeCO 3) and {{traces of}} pyrite (FeS 2) {{are present in}} a 1 m-long sediment core from Lake Nyos. Thermodynamic modeling shows that the deep waters are supersaturated with respect to siderite and pyrite. No <b>other</b> <b>carbonates</b> {{were found to be}} stable. This rare occurrence of siderite is symptomatic of the build-up of large concentrations of CO 2 and Fe 2 + in the Lake Nyos waters. A search for siderite in the deeper sediments could reveal the existence of previous gas burst events that have occurred at Lake Nyos or in other Cameroon lakes. © 1989.

5000|$|Flowstones are {{composed}} of sheetlike deposits of calcite or <b>other</b> <b>carbonate</b> minerals, formed where water flows down the walls or along the floors of a cave.

50|$|During the Triassic time period, {{modern day}} Israel was {{situated}} on {{the northeast corner of}} the continent which comprised modern day African and Arabian regions as shown in Figure 2. Sand deposits as well as marshy soil accumulated, forming a mainly sedimentary geology. As sea level rose, the Tethys Sea flooded the exposed land giving way to a shallow to deep marine environment. Evidence of this environment is made clear due to the extensive limestone and <b>other</b> <b>carbonate</b> rocks located throughout the region.|$|R
40|$|Strontium carbonates (SrCO 3) microcrystals {{have been}} {{synthesised}} through a modified homogeneous precipitation method, in which urea {{plays an important}} role.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Dimethylcarbonate (DMC) is a {{valuable}} methylating reagent that can replace methyl halides and dimethylsulfate in the methylation {{of a variety of}} nucleophiles.
