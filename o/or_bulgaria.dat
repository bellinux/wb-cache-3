2500|$|Robertson {{suggested}} {{once again}} that Wilson should return to commanding a corps, but Foch thought this a poor use of his talents. Haig’s diary states that Painleve had told Lloyd George Wilson was no longer persona grata with the French government. Wilson returned to London to sound out opinion about resigning and nobody tried to dissuade him. Whilst he was in London Lloyd George asked him to brief the War Cabinet individually then collectively with his advice that Britain try for some military or diplomatic success to drive Turkey <b>or</b> <b>Bulgaria</b> out of the war. On return to France Wilson declined Haig’s offer to command XIII Corps. Wilson then took {{a tour of the}} French line {{all the way down to}} the Swiss frontier, and was concerned that revolution seemed a possibility in France. He attempted to get a final interview with Painleve but left after being kept waiting in a lobby with [...] "a pronounced whore". He had a meeting with Haig, who was encouraged by the recent success at Messines, and agreed with Haig’s plan for a major offensive in Flanders, although he cautioned that it should only continue up until the time of the mud.|$|E
2500|$|As the European Union {{has grown}} from 6 to 28 member states, a clear {{procedure}} for accession of members is set out in TEU article 49. The European Union is only open to a [...] "European" [...] state which respects the principles of [...] "human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, {{the rule of law}} and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities". Countries whose territory is wholly outside the European continent cannot therefore apply. Nor can any country without fully democratic political institutions which ensure standards of [...] "pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men prevail". Article 50 says any member state can withdraw in accord [...] "with its own constitutional requirements", by negotiated [...] "arrangements for its withdrawal, taking account of the framework for its future relationship with the Union". This indicates that the EU is not entitled to demand a withdrawal, and that member states should follow constitutional procedures, for example, through Parliament or a codified constitutional document. Once article 50 is triggered, there is a two-year time limit to complete negotiations, a procedure which would leave a seceding member without any bargaining power in negotiations, because the costs of having no trade treaty would be proportionally greater to the individual state than the remaining EU bloc. Article 7 allows member states to be suspended for a [...] "clear risk of a serious breach" [...] of values in article 2 (for example, democracy, equality, human rights) with a four-fifths vote of the Council of the European Union, and the consent of the Parliament. Within the treaties' framework, sub-groups of member states may make further rules that only apply to those member states who want them. For example, the Schengen Agreements of 1985 and 1990 allow people to move without any passport or ID checks anywhere in the EU, but did not apply to the UK or Ireland. More recently, during the Eurozone crisis, the Treaty Establishing the European Stability Mechanism 2012 and the Treaty on Stability, Co-ordination and Governance 2012 (the [...] "Fiscal Compact") were adopted only for member states who had the Euro (i.e. not Denmark, Sweden, the UK, Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary, Croatia, Romania <b>or</b> <b>Bulgaria).</b> This required, among other things, a pledge to balance the government budget and limit structural deficits to 0.5 per cent of GDP, with fines for non-compliance. The jurisdiction for these rules remains with the Court of Justice.|$|E
60|$|The {{principal}} Allies {{are each}} represented by one chief delegate. The delegates of the United States, Great Britain, France, and Italy {{take part in}} all proceedings; the delegate of Belgium in all proceedings except those attended by the delegates of Japan or the Serb-Croat-Slovene State; the delegate of Japan in all proceedings affecting maritime or specifically Japanese questions; and the delegate of the Serb-Croat-Slovene State when questions relating to Austria, Hungary, <b>or</b> <b>Bulgaria</b> are under consideration. Other allies are to be represented by delegates, without the power to vote, whenever their respective claims and interests are under examination.|$|E

50|$|Old Great <b>Bulgaria</b> <b>or</b> Great <b>Bulgaria</b> (Byzantine Greek: Παλαιά Μεγάλη Βουλγαρία, Palaiá Megálē Voulgaría), {{also often}} {{known by the}} Latin names Magna Bulgaria) and Patria Onoguria ("Onogur land"), was a 7th Century state formed by the Bulgars and Onogurs on the western Pontic Steppe (modern {{southern}} Ukraine and south-west Russia). Great Bulgaria was originally centred on Phanagoria, between the Dniester and lower Volga, (in modern Krasnodar Krai, Russia).|$|R
50|$|In Bulgaria, {{the meal}} {{consists}} of an odd number of lenten dishes {{in compliance with the}} rules of fasting. They are usually the traditional sarma, bob chorba (bean soup), fortune kravai (pastry with a fortune in it; also called bogovitsa, vechernik, kolednik), stuffed peppers, nuts, dried fruit, boiled wheat. The meal is often accompanied with wine <b>or</b> <b>Bulgaria's</b> traditional alcoholic beverage rakia, in the past - olovina (a type of homemade rye beer). The meals used to be put on top of hay, directly on the floor, together with a ploughshare or a coulter.|$|R

5000|$|The {{game has}} drawn some {{criticism}} on its allocation of conquered territory when conquered by multiple allied forces, {{with the engine}} programmed to assign ownership to whichever force arrived first. For example, {{this can lead to}} Romania, Hungary <b>or</b> <b>Bulgaria</b> [...] "conquering" [...] and controlling large swathes of the USSR as allies of Germany, despite only contributing minor forces.|$|E
50|$|Another {{wife was}} a Bulgarian lady, whose name is given by Tatishchev as Adela. Historians have {{disagreed}} as to whether she came from Volga <b>Bulgaria</b> <b>or</b> from <b>Bulgaria</b> on the Danube. According to the Primary Chronicle, both Boris and Gleb were her children. This tradition, however, is viewed by most scholars {{as a product of}} later hagiographical tendency to merge the identity of both saints. Actually, they were of different age and their names point to different cultural traditions. Judging by his Oriental name, Boris could have been Adela's only offspring.|$|R

25|$|The First Bulgarian Empire {{became known}} simply as Bulgaria since its {{recognition}} by the Byzantine Empire in 681. Some historians use the terms Danube Bulgaria, First Bulgarian State, or First Bulgarian Tsardom (Empire). Between 681 and 864 the country was {{also known as the}} Bulgarian Khanate, Danube Bulgarian Khanate, or Danube Bulgar Khanate in order to differentiate it from Volga Bulgaria, which emerged from another Bulgar group. During its early existence, the country was also called the Bulgar state or Bulgar qaghanate. Between 864 and 917/927, the country was known as the Principality of <b>Bulgaria</b> <b>or</b> Knyazhestvo <b>Bulgaria.</b> In English language sources, the country is often known as the Bulgarian Empire.|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "Gastarbeiter" [...] {{lives on}} in Serbian, Bosnian, Croatian, Bulgarian, Macedonian, and Slovene languages, {{generally}} meaning [...] "expatriate" [...] (mostly referring to a second generation from the former Yugoslavia <b>or</b> <b>Bulgaria</b> born or living abroad). The South Slavic spelling reflects the local pronunciation of gastarbajter (in Cyrillic: гастарбаjтер or гастарбайтер). In Belgrade's jargon, it is commonly shortened to gastos (гастос), and in Zagreb's to gastić.|$|E
50|$|The term Military Inter-Allied Commission of Control {{was used}} {{in a series of}} peace {{treaties}} concluded after the First World War (1914 - 1918) between different countries. Each of these treaties was concluded between the Principal Allied and Associated Powers (consisting of the United States of America, the British Empire, France, Italy and Japan) on the one hand, and one of the Central Powers like Germany, Turkey <b>or</b> <b>Bulgaria.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In certain regions, berrypicking {{can be a}} {{large part}} of the economy, and it is {{becoming}} increasingly common for western European countries such as Sweden and Finland to import cheap labor from Thailand <b>or</b> <b>Bulgaria</b> to do the berry picking. This practice has come under scrutiny in the past years because of the low wages and poor living standard for the [...] "berry-pickers", as well as the lack of worker safety.|$|E
5000|$|Baths {{sprang up}} all over the empire. Where natural hot springs existed (as in Bath, England, Băile Herculane, Romania <b>or</b> Serdica, <b>Bulgaria)</b> thermae were built around them.

5000|$|The word [...] "azmak", {{sometimes}} {{used to describe}} a river, means [...] "running wild" [...] in Turkish, in {{a reference to the}} stream's strong, rather than violent, current, especially in winter.
