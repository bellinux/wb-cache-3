40|$|The Middle to Upper Jurassic in the Viking Graben {{area was}} {{deposited}} during an overall transgression. Tectonics, eustasy, sediment supply and sediment source area control facies distribution. The Lower Toarcian {{to the base}} of the Cretaceous consists of seven major regressive-transgressive facies cycles. These regressive-transgressive (R-T) facies cycles are called second order and dominate facies distribution. Two maximum flooding surfaces bound a facies cycle which contains an unconformity internally. The first three cycles occur during a minor rift phase (Rift Phase 1) and the second four during a major rift phase (Rift Phase 2). The regressive phase of the second <b>order</b> <b>cycles</b> appears to correspond to periods of high fault displacement; however, the eustatic effect on these cycles is unclear. Each second <b>order</b> facies <b>cycle</b> is associated with a change in depocenters. Most major seismic discontinuities are tectonic in origin. Shelfal areas and local highs are often eroded during a second order regression and the deposition is shifted to the basin center. During transgression, deposition is more widespread; shallow marine sandstones often develop on the margins of the graben. The paleobathymetric profile created by regional and local tectonics dictates facies types. Maps and seismic profiles of Rift Phase 1 indicate that the relatively simple tectonics led to uniform sediment and facies distribution. During Rift Phase 2, the development of numerous sub-basins creates heterogeneous facies distribution. Fault escarpments prevent progradation into the graben; sediments accumulated on the edge of fault escarpments fail and are redeposited as gravity deposits at the base of the escarpment. The seven second <b>order</b> <b>cycles</b> are subdivided into fourteen minor facies cycles that are called third <b>order</b> <b>cycles.</b> These cycles can be bound by either unconformities forming sequences or maximum flooding surfaces forming regressive-transgressive facies cycles. The cause of third <b>order</b> facies <b>cycles</b> is unclear. Third <b>order</b> <b>cycles</b> are more sensitive to sediment supply. Source area dictates sediment types. Uplift and erosion of Paleozoic and Triassic sandstones yield sand-rich sediments, while erosion of Caledonian schist yields shale-rich sediments...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} the optimal retailer’s replenishment policies considering the customers’ bad debt and delayed payment in the three-stage supply chain with the dominant retailer. The effect of bad debt is analyzed on the interest earned and interest charged to build the models of the retailer’s decision in two cases. By analyzing the model, the retailer’s optimal replenishment time and the optimal order quantity are obtained. Furthermore, analyze the effect of parameters on the retailer’s optimal order policies. Finally, the numerical analysis is presented to demonstrate the conclusions. The results show that the delayed payment offered by the manufacturer becomes large, the retailer's optimal <b>order</b> <b>cycle</b> and the optimal order quantity increases or remains the same; When the delayed payment time offered by the retailer decreases, the retailer's optimal <b>order</b> <b>cycle</b> and the optimal order quantity increases or remains the same. When the fixed ordering cost is reduced, the retailer's optimal <b>order</b> <b>cycle</b> and the optimal order quantity decreases or remains the same.

30|$|In this paper, EPQ {{models for}} non-instantaneous deteriorating items in which holding cost is an {{increasing}} function of the ordering run length are developed. The classical EPQ model is extended by considering a relationship between holding cost and the <b>ordering</b> <b>cycle</b> length. In practical real-life situations, most of the goods would have a period of maintaining quality or preserving original condition, during which (e.g., electronic goods, blood banks, fresh fruits, and so on) no deterioration occurs. Since deterioration does not occur, {{it is assumed that}} holding cost is constant. However, when deterioration starts, extra effort and more capital investment in storehouse equipment is needed to overcome it, therefore, here, it is considered that holding cost is increasing as function of the <b>ordering</b> <b>cycle</b> length. The economic <b>ordering</b> <b>cycle</b> length and the economic ordering quantity are obtained. Two models are developed that consider the cases of with and without shortages in which shortage occurs and in the other one it does not happen. Optimal solutions are derived and convexity of the cost functions is established. Besides, numerical examples are given to test and verify the theoretical results.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Apart from Bouma sequences, {{recurrent}} {{patterns of}} sedimentation can be recognized at two hierarchic levels in turbidite formations {{of the northern}} Apennines. First <b>order</b> <b>cycles</b> (turbidite suites) encompass most of the basin fill, second <b>order</b> <b>cycles</b> (megaseqttenees) occur as organized groups of beds 2 - 70 m thick within the suites. The Marnoso-arenacea (Lower-Upper Miocene) {{is an example of}} a progradational or offlapping suite with thickening and coarsening upward trend. The Laga Formation (Upper Miocene-Lower Pliocene) is characterized by a "transgressive " (retrogradational) or on-lapping trend. Vertical facies changes go eitlier way through the following steps: basin plain ~ outer fan ~ midfan ~ inner fan ~ slope deposits (- ~ = prograding, ~- = re-ceding). Both suites are enclosed by hemipelagie pelites and chaotic deposits, the start of turbidite sedimentation being gradual in the progradational case, and abrupt (large scale erosion) in the reverse one. Second <b>order</b> <b>cycles</b> follow each other or are separated by monotonous (uniform or irregularly bedded) sequences of extremely variable thickness (2 to more than 1, 000 m) composed either of fan (overbank, fringe) or basin plain deposits (with key beds laterall...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} a two-level {{distribution system}} {{consisting of a}} central warehouse (CW) supplying several branch warehouses (BW's), which, in turn, supply normally-distributed customer demands in a periodic-review environment. The CW replenishes system inventory using a base-stock replenishment policy and a predetermined <b>order</b> <b>cycle</b> of H time periods; i. e., every H periods, the CW orders enough from an outside supplier to bring the systemwide inventory position to a certain level (to be determined) based on a given minimum level of customer service. Upon receipt of this order, the CW allocates it entirely to the BW's so as to minimize the expected total units short at the BW's. This simple allocation scheme, may, of course, lead to out-of-balance BW inventories {{towards the end of}} the CW's <b>order</b> <b>cycle.</b> Hence, redistribution during the cycle should be considered. The redistribution treated here is a complete redistribution of all BW inventories one period before the end of the <b>order</b> <b>cycle.</b> Approximate formulas are derived which allow for a comparison of the system-wide inventories appropriate to each of two allocation schemes: (1) the simple allocation scheme only; and (2) the simple allocation scheme with total redistribution one period before the end of the <b>order</b> <b>cycle.</b> Limited computational tests indicate the magnitude of the improvements possible with total redistribution, and the sensitivities of these improvements to model parameters. inventory/production, approximations, multi-echelon, issuing policies, ordering policies, stochastic models...|$|E

40|$|In the {{classical}} {{economic order quantity}} (EOQ) models, a common unrealistic assumption {{is that all the}} items received are of good quality. However, in realistic environment, a received shipment usually contains a fraction of imperfect quality items. These imperfect items may be scrapped, reworked at a cost, or salvaged at a discounted price. While the percentage of imperfect items is random, the optimal <b>ordering</b> <b>cycle</b> is rarely considered in current literatures. This paper revisits the model (Maddah and Jaber, 2008) and extends it by assuming that the <b>ordering</b> <b>cycle</b> is determined by the demand rate, delivery quantity per shipment, and the mathematical expectation of the defective rate. The possibility of stockout or residue in the end of a cycle will be considered, and the loss of stockout and the salvage of the residue are counted into the cost. Besides, we consider consolidating the shipments of imperfect items over multiple deliveries. Thus, an integrated vendor-buyer inventory model for imperfect quality items with equal-size shipment policy is established to derive the optimal <b>ordering</b> <b>cycle,</b> <b>ordering</b> quantity, and number of deliveries. The computational method of the optimal delivery quantity per shipment and number of deliveries is given through theoretical results.

40|$|AbstractTo {{implement}} {{for large}} inventory systems becomes rather cumbersome because each item requires managements of <b>order</b> <b>cycle</b> and quantity. The inventory control problem is greatly simplified {{as only a}} few groups rather than many items {{will have to be}} controlled. This method is the ABC analysis. A. K. Chakaravarty have showed that the optimal groups possess the property of consecutiveness that they are composed of items ordered by the product of their demand rate and holding cost rate (PDHC). The grouping scheme can thus be viewed as a simple process of dividing the items into optimal ranges of the PDHC values. Further the <b>order</b> <b>cycle</b> grouping is shown to be, usually, superior to the order quantity grouping scheme. This paper discusses the analytic properties of the problem of grouping that is modelled as a dynamic programming.
