5|$|Following his {{decision}} not to run for re-election as mayor in 1893, three years later, McCauley sought to be Edmonton's representative in the North-West Territories Legislature. During his term as representative, he worked to upgrade Edmonton's school system, along with upgrading the town's trade industry. He served in this capacity until 1902, when he was defeated. During his time, McCauley kept his focus on his development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>system,</b> introducing a single tax bill intended to give schools boards power to adopt the tax.|$|E
5|$|Tiny Town, in Springfield, Missouri, was {{the first}} city built in {{miniature}} and had over a thousand structures. A smaller village version was completed in 1919, while the larger full version was completed in 1925. It was motivated primarily by a local homebuilding promotion. The project involved 10,000 students from eighteen Springfield public high schools. The superintendent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>system</b> was a key instigator {{of the project and}} used it as a teaching aid to instruct students in government, home-ownership and citizenship.|$|E
5|$|He {{was elected}} the first {{president}} of the Edmonton Board of Trade upon its founding in 1889. He served until 1894. He also played a vital role in the development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>system</b> in Edmonton, involving himself in education-related affairs as early as 1881, and serving on the public school board from 1886–87 and 1889 until 1897. In 1881, he was part of a group that provided funds for the first school teacher in the city. In 1886, with the school board, Cameron was responsible for introducing a fee for the parents of students attending schools in the Edmonton Public School District who did not live within the district, as district residents were taxed for the school's services. He would serve as secretary-treasurer from 1882 to 1884 and later as chairman of the school board from 1890 to 1892 and 1894.|$|E

5|$|Morikawa Kaichirō {{identifies}} the subculture as distinctly Japanese, a product <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>system</b> and society. Japanese schools have a class structure which {{functions as a}} caste system, but clubs are {{an exception to the}} social hierarchy. In these clubs, a student's interests will be recognized and nurtured, catering to the interests of otaku. Secondly, the vertical structure of Japanese society {{identifies the}} value of individuals by their success. Until the late 1980s, unathletic and unattractive males focused on academics, hoping to secure a good job and marry to raise their social standing. Those unable to succeed socially focused instead on their interests, often into adulthood, with their lifestyle centering on those interests, furthering the creation of the otaku subculture.|$|E
5|$|The {{court was}} central to the {{patronage}} and dissemination of Renaissance works and ideas. It was also central to the staging of lavish display that portrayed the political and religious role of the monarchy. The Renaissance led {{to the adoption of}} ideas of imperial monarchy, encouraging the Scottish crown to join the new monarchies by asserting imperial jurisdiction and distinction. The growing emphasis on education in the Middle Ages became part of a humanist and then Protestant programme to extend and reform learning. It resulted in the expansion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>system</b> and the foundation of six university colleges {{by the end of the}} sixteenth century. Relatively large numbers of Scottish scholars studied on the continent or in England and some, such as Hector Boece, John Mair, Andrew Melville and George Buchanan, returned to Scotland to play a major part in developing Scottish intellectual life. Vernacular works in Scots began to emerge in the fifteenth century, while Latin remained a major literary language. With the patronage of James V and James VI, writers included William Stewart, John Bellenden, David Lyndsay, William Fowler and Alexander Montgomerie.|$|E

25|$|Amid the {{continuing}} expansion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>system,</b> the board gave serious consideration to adding a high school. The initial proposal encompassed a spacious building designed for 1,200 students and included an athletic facility with a swimming pool. However, {{the cost of}} more than $6.2 million did not appeal to the public. In response, a modified design was submitted, and construction began in June 1965. The doors to the new high school opened to students in September 1966.|$|E
25|$|Research {{shows that}} {{children}} from lower-income households who get good-quality pre-Kindergarten education {{are more likely}} to graduate from high school, attend college, hold a job and have higher earnings. In 2010, the U.S. ranked 28th out of 38 advanced countries in the share of four-year-olds enrolled in public or private early childhood education. Gains in enrollment stalled after 2010, as did growth in funding, due to budget cuts arising from the Great Recession. Per-pupil spending in state-funded programs declined by 12% after inflation since 2010. The U.S. differs from other countries in that it funds public education primarily through sub-national (state and local) taxes. The quality of funding for public education varies based on the tax base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>system,</b> with significant variation in local taxes and spending per pupil. Better teachers also raise the educational attainment and future earnings of students, but they tend to migrate to higher income school districts. Among developed countries, 70% of 3-year-olds go to preschool, versus 38% in the United States.|$|E

2500|$|The {{predominance}} of Sarmatism and Counter-Reformation and the weak cultural {{development of the}} Commonwealth were {{closely related to the}} lowered, in comparison with the previous period, level of general education.

The number of parish schools and secondary schools increased in the 18th century, with more serious reform commencing in the 1840s. Many secondary education colleges were conducted by religious orders of the Jesuits and Piarists.

2500|$|The German {{preschool}} {{is known}} as a Kindergarten (plural Kindergärten) or Kita, short for Kindertagesstätte (meaning [...] "children's daycare center").

Attending a Kindergarten is neither mandatory nor free of charge, but can be partly or wholly funded, depending on the local authority and the income of the parents.
