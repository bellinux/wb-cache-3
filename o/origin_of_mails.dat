25|$|Little {{is known}} about the <b>origins</b> <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> in Malta, but when the island was part of the Kingdom <b>of</b> Sicily <b>mail</b> was carried privately on ships such as speronaras between Malta and Sicily. From 1530 onwards, the Maltese islands (along with Tripoli) were {{administered}} by the Order of Saint John. The earliest known letter is dated 14 June 1532 which was sent from Grand Master l'Isle Adam to the Bishop of Auxerre in France. The first proper postal service was set up by the Order in 1708, and the service was carried out at the Casa del Commun Tesoro (now the Casino Maltese) in Valletta. The first postal markings on Maltese mail appeared later on in the 18th century, sometime between 1755 and 1791.|$|R

50|$|According to Brussels' government, {{the term}} the mall, {{translated}} from the French le mail, was given by the designers due to the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> the word <b>mail.</b> The etymology <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> refers to the game, <b>mail</b> (a form <b>of</b> croquet) which was played in 16th century France on a raised grassy valley adjoining the Tuileries Palace Gardens. The proximity of Leopold Park to the esplanade, which was originally higher, led the designers to apply the term.|$|R

2500|$|Stamps {{are usually}} rectangular, but triangles or other shapes are {{occasionally}} used. The stamp is affixed to an envelope or other postal cover (e.g., packet, box, mailing cylinder) the customer wishes to send. The item is then processed by the postal system, where a postmark, sometimes {{known as a}} cancellation mark, is usually applied in overlapping manner to stamp and cover. This procedure marks the stamp as used to prevent its reuse. [...] In modern usage, postmarks generally indicate the date and point <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> the <b>mailing.</b> The mailed item is then delivered to the address the customer has applied to the envelope or parcel.|$|R

As public servants, they {{were not allowed to}} leak any {{information}} on what went through them (including the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> the <b>mail).</b> Everything at work was strictly confidential. In the past, there was no bank transfers available thus people often sent money by post using envelopes without using registered mail due to the higher cost incurred. Thus, it is extremely important that postal workers were honest and did not steal any items that went through the mail. To reinforce the importance of confidentiality, the comptroller of the General Post Office would stand at the gallery above the sorting halls to observe all postal workers and ensure none of the letters or mail were opened while being sorted [...]|$|R

5000|$|The <b>origins</b> <b>of</b> {{the word}} <b>mail</b> {{are not fully}} known.

[...] Another theory relates the word to the old French, maillier, meaning to hammer (related to the modern English word, malleable). In modern French, maille refers to a loop or stitch. The Arabic words [...] "burnus", برنوس, a burnoose; a hooded cloak, also a chasuble (worn by Coptic priests) and [...] "barnaza", برنز, to bronze, suggest an Arabic influence for the Carolingian armour known as [...] "byrnie" [...] (see below).|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} improve the quality <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> piece stacking, an {{engineering}} model of an output module has been developed and tested by DETECON and FHG-IML under the master agreement between DETECON and the United States Postal Service in an R and D - project. The <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> the technical approach for this output module was a concept for an Advanced Letter Sorter with a multilevel transporter, that required a horizontal output stacker. One output module has to reach up to four different levels of the transporter so that the vertical space required by the output stacker had to be minimized. Considering the heterogeneous composition <b>of</b> manual letter <b>mail</b> and its differing physical characteristics, a nearly form-locking transfer <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> pieces between transporter carriers and stack was favoured. As a consequence, the transmission had to be effected with minimal friction influences. This paper describes the functional principle, the main components of the output module, and the results and parame ters of several tests...|$|R

25|$|For instance, an {{individual}} {{keeping track of}} the amount <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> they receive each day may notice that they receive an average number of 4 letters per day. If receiving any particular piece <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> does not affect the arrival times of future pieces <b>of</b> <b>mail,</b> i.e., if pieces <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> {{from a wide range of}} sources arrive independently of one another, then a reasonable assumption is that the number <b>of</b> pieces <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> received in a day obeys a Poisson distribution. Other examples that may follow a Poisson include the number of phone calls received by a call center per hour and the number of decay events per second from a radioactive source.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} two threads in {{the history}} <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> art: a networking approach dedicated to open participation and a crafted approach dedicated to the art object. It then follows these two threads across three generations. Mail art is an international phenomenon that evolved over the past sixty odd years due {{to the efforts of}} a dedicated and growing group of individuals. American artist Ray Johnson and the international artistic group operating under the banner of Fluxus are discussed as establishing mail art as a separate form through their creation <b>of</b> the <b>mail</b> art network. The generation that followed Johnson and Fluxus expanded on the free and open ethos <b>of</b> the <b>mail</b> art network, making it a cornerstone <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> art practice and embracing new technology. Finally, this study examines work by contemporary mail artists who have not yet been historicized and who return to a craft approach in the production <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> art. Using Glenn Adamson 2 ̆ 7 s theory of craft, this thesis concludes that craft is an equally pertinent aspect <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> art practice and that, although it is underemphasized in mail art 2 ̆ 7 s first two generations, it is a dominant factor in the production <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> art today...|$|R
