5|$|Construction of {{the hill}} and judge's tower started on 1 July 1980 and was {{completed}} on 1 December 1982. Construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> lift started on 1 October 1982 and was completed on 30 October 1983. The jumps were inaugurated in 1983. After the Olympics, Sarajevo experienced a boom in recreational skiing among locals, including ski jumping.|$|E
5|$|A {{ski flying}} event {{consists}} of several preliminary stages, {{culminating in a}} competition to decide a winner and subsequent order. Within an event there are up to three competitions – individual, and sometimes team – all taking place on separate days. These competitions are contested somewhat differently depending on whether an event is staged as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ski</b> Flying World Championships or Ski Flying World Cup. In both events, a 'training' round takes place on the opening day, {{as well as a}} 'trial' round before each competition; these non-scoring rounds are essentially practice or warm-up sessions, and athlete participation is optional.|$|E
5|$|The {{rules and}} scoring in ski flying are mostly {{the same as}} they are in ski jumping, and events under the {{discipline}} are usually contested as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ski</b> Jumping World Cup season, but the hills (of which there are only five remaining, all in Europe) are constructed to a different standard in order to enable jumps of up to 66% longer in distance. There is also a stronger emphasis on aerodynamics and harnessing the wind, as well as an increased element of danger due to athletes flying much higher and faster than in ski jumping.|$|E
40|$|Flexural and {{torsional}} rigidity are important properties <b>of</b> <b>skis.</b> However, <b>the</b> flexural and {{torsional rigidity}} {{that lead to}} optimal performance remain to be established. In the present study, four pairs of slalom skis that differed in flexural and torsional rigidity were tested by advanced and expert skiers. Using a 10 -item questionnaire, different aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> skis’ performance were rated on a 9 -point scale. For each pair of skis, physical measurements were compared with <b>the</b> ratings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two groups <b>of</b> skiers. Correlations (Spearman) were then determined between (i) different mechanical properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skis</b> (static and dynamic), (ii) subjective assessments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> participants, and (iii) properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skis</b> and <b>the</b> participants’ assessments. The latter showed that expert skiers rate <b>the</b> aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skis</b> more accurately than advanced skiers. Importantly, expert skiers are particularly sensitive to torsion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skis.</b> These results suggest that such highly rated elements should be addressed in future ski designs...|$|R

5|$|In 2004, four {{female athletes}} – Anette Sagen, Helena Olsson Smeby, Line Jahr, and Lindsey Van – {{were invited to}} perform test jumps prior to the men's 2004 Continental Cup event in Vikersund. However, this was {{initially}} blocked by Torbjørn Yggeseth, founder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ski</b> Jumping World Cup {{and a member of}} the FIS technical committee at the time, on the grounds that it was too dangerous to allow women on ski flying hills. Sagen challenged this and eventually won the right to jump from the hill, along with her fellow athletes. Both Sagen and Smeby jumped , which remains the third longest distance for women.|$|E
5|$|Kanthaugen {{has hosted}} FIS Freestyle Skiing World Cup events twice, on 26 to 28 March 1993 and on 3 to 5 March 1995. It also hosted the Norwegian Freestyle Skiing Championships in 1993 and 1996. Lillehammer is {{scheduled}} to host the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics, with Kanthaugen to host freestyle skiing and half-pipe snowboarding. The venue is designated a Norway's national freestyle skiing venue and is the main training ground for the national team. The area around the venue is a popular recreational area for Lillehammer. Since 1995, Lillehammer Olympiapark has rented out toboggans {{for use in the}} hill, including use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> lift.|$|E
5|$|The Malo Polje area of Igman has {{traditionally}} been used for recreational cross-country skiing. During Sarajevo's Olympic bid, the two ski jumps were proposed as separate venues. However, after the games were awarded, the plans changed {{in favor of a}} single venue, which would allow better post-Olympic use. The area plan for the jumps were presented by the Organizing Committee's executive board on 30 April 1979 and was passed by Sarajevo City Council in September 1979. The design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> jump was approved by FIS on 18 October 1979. Work on auxiliary infrastructure started in mid-1979, including a new road from the city to Igman.|$|E

5|$|From 1932 to 1992, Birkebeinerrittet, a mass ski {{marathon}} between Rena and Lillehammer, {{has used}} Stampesletta as a start or goal area, depending on if the race ran from Lillehammer to Rena {{or in the}} opposite direction. Since 1992, the goal area was moved to Birkebeineren Ski Stadium. Birkebeinerrittet, a cycle version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> marathon, has its goal area at Stampesletta. The half-marathon terrain race Birkebeinerløpet uses Stampesletta as its start and goal area. During the 1994 Winter Olympics, Stampesletta was used for medal ceremonies for all non-skating events. The backdrops for the podium was built using ice and snow, with the podium itself being made from ice from the glacier Jostedalsbreen. This contrasted with the surrounding pine elements. Attendance was free, and between 25,000 and 30,000 people attended the medal ceremonies. Lillehammer is scheduled to host the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics. The Stampesletta area {{will be used for}} the opening and closing ceremonies with a spectator capacity of 6,000 to 8,000; existing and new buildings nearby will be used for the Olympic Village.|$|E
5|$|The {{ski jumping}} venue {{took place at}} Ještěd which has two hills that were already to FIS specifications. The normal hill size (HS) was 100m (HS100) while the large hill size was 134m (HS134). Both hills were used for FIS ski jumping World Cup venues with Finnish ski jumper Janne Ahonen holding the record jump of 139m on the HS134 hill in 2004. Modifications were done to the outrun and data was {{gathered}} on the wind flow within the ski jumping area from January to March for 2006 to 2009. At the fall 2007 meeting in Zurich {{during the week of}} 24 September 2007, it was announced by the Organizing Committee that construction was proceeding according to schedule, with completion in mid-December 2007. The test event for Jested took place on 8–9 February 2008. A grandstand of 10,000 spectators was constructed in order to have night time ski jumping the weekend of 9–10 February 2008. The hill suffered a landslide caused by continuous rainfall around the hill during the week of 28 January 2008, but the outrun was not affected by the event, according to Liberec mayor Jiri Kittner. On 1 February, Neumannová stated that the ski jumping events took place as scheduled. The lift to the ski jump that was not working during the FIS World Cup B Nordic combined event in January was fixed. The winners <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> jumping test event at the HS134 hill were Thomas Morgenstern of Austria on 8 February and Anders Jacobsen of Norway on 9 February. An Alpen Cup competition took place on the weekend of 20–21 December 2008 to have final test procedures and infrastructure for the championships. As of 14 January 2009, the main grandstand was complete while the teams worked on proper shaping of the hills for use. The large hill was closed while the normal hill was designated for ski jumper and Nordic combined athlete training. Further construction during the week of 19 January 2009 included spectator stairs {{on the side of the}} hill, mobile containers for the athletes and their service teams; and a spectator catering tent was set up.|$|E

25|$|Colbeck {{offers an}} {{overview}} of the five friction processes of skis on snow. They are the: 1) resistance due to plowing of snow out of the way, 2) deformation of the snow over which the ski is traveling, 3) lubrication <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> with a thin layer of melt water, 4) capillary attraction of water in the snow to the ski bottom, and 5) contamination of the snow with dust and other non-slippery elements. Plowing and deformation pertain to the interaction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ski,</b> as a whole, with the snow and are negligible on a firm surface. Lubrication, capillary attraction and contamination are issues for the ski bottom and the wax that is applied to reduce sliding friction or achieve adequate grip.|$|E
