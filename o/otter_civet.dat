50|$|The large snout {{and long}} facial {{whiskers}} of Hose’s civet {{is similar to}} that of the <b>otter</b> <b>civet</b> (Cynogale bennettii). The <b>otter</b> <b>civet</b> is known to be semiaquatic and has webbed feet; it occurs mainly in lowland rain forest.|$|E
50|$|The <b>otter</b> <b>civet</b> is a nocturnal {{species that}} obtains {{most of its}} food from the water, feeding on fish, crabs and {{freshwater}} mollusks. It can also climb to feed on birds and fruit. Given its rarity and secretive nature {{it is a very}} poorly known species.|$|E
50|$|Favored {{habitats}} include woodland, savanna, mountains, {{and above}} all, tropical rainforest. Due to heavy deforestation, many {{are faced with}} severe loss of habitat; several species are considered vulnerable such as the rare Hose's palm civet, which is endemic to northern Borneo; the <b>otter</b> <b>civet</b> is classified as endangered.|$|E
50|$|Gaurs and Asian {{elephants}} {{can also}} be found. Lowland animals such as these also {{can be found at}} higher altitudes, along with animals specialised for mountain living, such as siamang gibbons, red squirrels, and lesser moon rats. East Malaysia lacks the tigers of the Peninsula, leaving clouded leopards, sunbears and Sunda <b>otter</b> <b>civets</b> as the primary predators. Rhinoceroses and elephants are also found there, along with Bornean orangutans, Mueller's gibbons, macaques, proboscis monkeys, silvered leaf monkeys, langurs and slow lorises.|$|R

50|$|The <b>otter</b> <b>civet</b> {{possesses}} several {{adaptations to}} its habitat, including a broad mouth and webbed feet with naked soles and long claws. Its muzzle is long with numerous long whiskers. It {{is in many}} ways similar to the Hose's palm civet (Diplogale hosei) but has a shorter tail and no whitish underparts.|$|E
50|$|The <b>otter</b> <b>civet</b> (Cynogale bennettii) is a semiaquatic civet {{native to}} Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei. It {{is listed as}} Endangered because of a serious ongoing {{population}} decline, estimated {{to be more than}} 50% over the past three generations (estimated to be 15 years), inferred from direct habitat destruction, and indirect inferred declines due to pollutants.|$|E
50|$|The park {{provides}} habitat to 10 {{species of}} primates, 90 species of mammals and 300 species of birds.

Wild pigs and deers are the most frequently hunted animals by the locals while primates can be hunted incidentally.|$|R
50|$|Otter civets are {{distributed}} in Sumatra, Borneo and peninsular Thailand. Preferred habitat {{appears to be}} lowland primary forest, but they have also been recorded in secondary forest, bamboo and logged forest. The supposed origin of Lowe's <b>otter</b> <b>civet</b> (C. lowei) known only from one holotype found in 1926 in northern Vietnam was not confirmed.They {{are thought to be}} largely confined to peat swamp forests, though there are recent records from lowland dry forest.|$|E

50|$|Conversion of peat swamp {{forests to}} oil palm {{plantations}} {{is a major}} threat. There {{is no evidence that}} the species is specifically hunted, but as a ground-dwelling species it is exposed to snares and other ground-level traps set for other species.Clear-cut logging is one of the major factors contributing to decline in suitable habitat, and even selective logging may sufficiently alter habitat such that it is the species can no longer occupy it; combined, this loss of primary forest may be responsible for the current rarity of the <b>otter</b> <b>civet.</b>|$|E
50|$|There {{are about}} fifteen species of large mammal in the {{sanctuary}} as well as about {{one hundred and fifty}} species of bird. This is the place from which the Indian Government has inaugurated the Snow Leopard Project. This project aims to provide special conservation measures to protect the snow leopard. This endangered predator is threatened by the decline in wild animals on which to prey, by being poaching for its skin and body parts, and by being killed by farmers to protect their livestock. Other mammals found {{in the sanctuary}} include the Asian black bear, the brown bear, the common leopard, the musk deer, the bharal, the Himalayan tahr and the serow. Smaller mammals include the Indian crested porcupine, European <b>otter,</b> goral, <b>civet,</b> hedgehog, Himalayan field rat, Hodgson's giant flying squirrel, wild boar, masked palm civet and Sikkim mountain vole.|$|R
50|$|The pygmy hog, a small wild pig, is {{critically}} endangered, C2a(ii) ver 3.1 as per IUCN listing, and {{is limited to}} about 75 animals in captivity, confined to a very few locations in and around north-western Assam, including the Orang National Park {{where it has been}} introduced. Other mammals reported are the blind Gangetic dolphin, Indian pangolin, hog deer (Axis porcinus), rhesus macaque, Bengal porcupine, Indian fox, small Indian <b>civet,</b> <b>otter,</b> leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis), fishing cat (Felis viverrina) and jungle cat (Felis chaus).|$|R
40|$|A {{survey was}} {{conducted}} during January to December 2006 to assess the status of faunal diversity of Savar Upazila, Dhaka, Bangladesh. A total of 30 species of birds, 24 species of winter birds, 7 species of reptiles, 3 species of amphibians, 15 species of mammalians and 32 species of fishes were recorded. Relative abundance of those species were determined. Of the birds, House Sparrow (Passer domesticus) was abundant while Blyth's Kingfisher (Alcedo hercules), Rock Eagle Owl (Bubo bengalensis), Hooded Pitta (Pitta sordida), Black-headed Oriole (Oriolus xanthornus), White-winged Duck (Cairina seululala) and Duck (Anser indicus) were rare. The relative abundance of winter bird could not be assessed because of their migratory habit. Striped keelback (Amphiesma stolata) and Common Smooth Water Snake (Enhydris enhydris) were very common while Black pond turtle (Geoclyms hamiltonii) and Pond tortoise (Melanochelys trijuga) were recorded as endangered. Common Toad (Bufo melanostictus) were abundant but Bull Frog (Rana tigrina) was rare. Asiatic Wild Dog (Cuon alpinus) and House Mouse (Mus musculus) were abundant while Common <b>Otter,</b> Large Indian <b>Civet,</b> Irrawaddy River Dolphin, Indian Hare were rare. Carpu, Silver carp, Tilapia, Nilotica were abundant while, Freshwater Garfish, One stripe spinyeel and Grey Featherback were rare. Landfilling, deforestation, poaching, industrial effluents and current jal were identified as major threats to the faunal diversity of Savar area. </p...|$|R
50|$|In March 2005, an <b>otter</b> <b>civet</b> was camera trapped {{within an}} Acacia {{plantation}} in central Sarawak during 1,632 trap-nights. Between July 2008 and January 2009, ten otter civets were photographed {{in an area}} of about 112 sqkm sq mi in Sabah's Deramakot Forest Reserve, a lowland tropical rainforest in Borneo ranging in altitude from 60 - 250 m. In May 2009, the presence of otter civets was documented {{for the first time in}} central Kalimantan, where two individuals were photographed in the Sabangau Peat-swamp Forest at an elevation of about 11 m.|$|E
50|$|Viverrids {{are native}} to sub-Saharan Africa, Madagascar, the Iberian Peninsula, {{southern}} China, South and Southeast Asia. Favoured habitats include woodland, savanna, and mountain biomes and, above all, ralleigh court. In consequence, many {{are faced with}} severe loss of habitat; several species are considered vulnerable and the <b>otter</b> <b>civet</b> is classified as endangered. Some species of civet are very rare and elusive and hardly anything is known about them, e.g., the Hose's civet, endemic to the montane forests of northern Borneo, {{is one of the}} world's least known carnivores.|$|E
50|$|Animals {{include a}} herd of the {{critically}} endangered Sumatran elephant. Several hundred elephants from surrounding areas that were being deforested or converted for agriculture were driven into the Padang-Sugihan.Other animals recorded in the park include leopard cat, fishing cat, Malayan sun bear, hairy-nosed otter, small-clawed otter, masked palm civet, <b>otter</b> <b>civet,</b> agile gibbon, southern pig-tailed macaque, crab-eating macaque, silvered leaf monkey, greater mouse deer, lesser mouse deer, wild boar, Bornean bearded pig, sambar deer, and previously the critically endangered Sumatran tiger. The reserve {{is also an important}} wetland for a number of bird species, including Storm's stork, white-winged duck and the great hornbill.|$|E
50|$|The {{wildlife}} of this ecoregion {{consists of}} a large number of forest animals ranging from the world's smallest squirrel, the least pygmy squirrel, to the largest land mammal in Asia, the Asian elephant. It includes the critically endangered Sumatran rhinoceros, the endangered and iconic Bornean orangutan, twelve other species of primate, Bornean bearded pigs and Bornean yellow muntjac deer. The primates of Borneo are: three apes (Bornean orangutan, Müller's Bornean gibbon and Bornean white-bearded gibbon), five langurs, the southern pig-tailed macaque, the long-tailed macaque, Horsfield's tarsier (Tarsius bancanus), the Sunda slow loris (Nycticebus coucang) and the endangered proboscis monkey (Nasalis larvatus). There are no tigers on Borneo; carnivores include the endangered clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa), the sun bear (Elarctos malayanus), the <b>otter</b> <b>civet</b> (Cynogale bennettii), and several other mustelids and viverrids.|$|E
40|$|The {{tropical}} rainforest biodiversity of Sabah, Borneo {{is threatened}} by large-scale agricultural development, logging, and increasing hunting pressures. From 2010 — 2015, an extensive camera-trapping study in the Lower Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary (LKWS) monitored wildlife utilisation of a lowland riparian forest corridor. This effort, culminating in nearly 600, 000 images, was the longest running cameratrapping study in the Sanctuary, and documented 11 small carnivore species over 24, 506 trap nights. The Malay Civet Viverra tangalunga was the most frequently detected species, followed by the Malay Badger Mydaus javanensis and the Common Palm Civet Paradoxurus hermaphroditus. The survey also collected the first photographic record of an <b>Otter</b> <b>Civet</b> Cynogale bennettii in the LKWS, which represents a new locality for this little-known Southeast Asian species. Opportunistic sightings of five additional species, including the Endangered Flat-headed Cat Prionailurus planiceps, increased the total count of small carnivores persisting in the LKWS to 16. Given the highly degraded and fragmented status of the LKWS, this study {{highlights the importance of}} riparian lowland forest fragments in sustaining carnivore diversity, and also emphasizes the importance of continued, long-term monitoring effort...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDue to the {{difficulty}} in obtaining samples, the systematics of the Hemigalinae civets has not been fully resolved. The {{aim of this study}} was to clarify the relationships of the species and the intraspecific diversity within this subfamily, and to explore the environmental factors that might have affected its evolution. Using two mitochondrial and two nuclear markers, we confirmed that the Hemigalinae comprises Owston's civet, the <b>otter</b> <b>civet,</b> Hose's civet and the banded civet, but also the Sulawesi palm civet (formerly included in the Paradoxurinae). Our study showed that the banded and Owston's civets are sister species, and suggested that Hose's civet is sister to these two. Within the banded civet, we observed a high divergence between individuals from the Mentawai Islands and those from Sumatra and Borneo (while the latter two were not strongly divergent), likely due to the deep sea channel between the Mentawai Islands and Sumatra. Unexpectedly, the Sumatran and Peninsular Malaysian individuals were not closely related, despite the fact that these two regions have repeatedly been connected during the last glaciations. No high polymorphism was found within Owston's civet, although three groups were obtained: southern China, northern Vietnam and central Vietnam, which might be related to Pleistocene climatic fluctuations...|$|E
