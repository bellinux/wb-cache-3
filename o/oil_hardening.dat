50|$|The {{cold-work}} {{tool steels}} include the O-series (oil-hardening), the A-series (air-hardening), and the D-series (high carbon-chromium). These are steels used to cut or form {{materials that are}} at low temperatures. This group possesses high hardenability and wear resistance, and average toughness and heat softening resistance. They are used in production of larger parts or parts that require minimal distortion during hardening. The use of oil quenching and air-hardening helps reduce distortion, avoiding the higher stresses caused by the quicker water quenching. More alloying elements are used in these steels, {{as compared to the}} water-hardening class. These alloys increase the steels' hardenability, and thus require a less severe quenching process and as a result are less likely to crack. They have high surface hardness and are often used to make knife blades. The machinability of the <b>oil</b> <b>hardening</b> grades is high but for the high carbon-chromium types is low.|$|E

If properly designed, hard turning can give equivalent results to grinding process {{in terms of}} accuracy and machined surface quality. Wiper inserts are being used in machining operations because of their competence to generate superior machined surface.

This paper investigates performance of wiper inserts in hard turning of <b>oil</b> <b>hardening</b> non-shrinking steel. The <b>oil</b> <b>hardening</b> non-shrinking steel is commonly used material for making measuring instruments and gauges wherein surface roughness is very important aspect. The major emphasis here is given to study and compare performance of wiper insert in terms of surface finish with conventional inserts. Influence of process parameters such as speed, feed, depth of cut and nose radius (for wiper and conventional inserts) on surface roughness is analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and analysis of means (AOM) plots. From the analysis, it can be clearly seen that wiper inserts produce a very good machined surface compared to conventional inserts...|$|E

Finds relevance of an assessment of influence of concentration and viscosity of a thinner – condensate on physical and chemical characteristics of petrowater condensate mixes at various temperatures and the modes of currents. It is well-known the facts that availability of the dispersed water in petrocondensate mix reduces efficiency of operation of pipelines. So, the increase in volume of water and raised viscosity leads to rise in price of transportation by petrowater condensate mix. Besides the high content of the connected water in mix causes intensive education by asfaltqamparafin postponed, increases <b>oil</b> <b>hardening</b> temperature.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to get oneself acquainted with the method of {{spectrum}} evaluation of fatty acids in hardened fats by means of gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. The theoretical part deals with information concerning the types of lipids, their compositions, properties of fatty acids especially in oils and hardened cooking fats and with basic information regarding the methods of <b>oil</b> <b>hardening.</b> This part is concentrated on the evaluation method of fatty acids by means of gas chromatography {{with the use of}} gualitative using the mass spectrometry. The fatty acids were evaluated in some commercially available fats (Albert, Ceres Soft, Iva, Lando, Lira, Omega, Varoma). Palmitic acid (hexadecane acid) was represented in the highest proportion in all fats, it was 36 - 45. 5 %, frequently represented was also oleic acid (cis-octadec- 9 -ane) with its 32. 2 - 39 %. The last of the more frequently represented acids is the linoleic acid (cis, cis-octadeca- 9. 12 -diene) with its 7. 7 % to 10. 5 %. A lower amount of the linoleic acid is contained in the Albert fat, where it is represented with 4. 5 % only. Interesting is the content of acids being typical for milk fat of ruminants, it includes the caprylic acid (octane), capric acid (decane) and lauric acid (dodecane) and the content of trans-acids. The hardened Albert fat has the highest content of trans-acids, they occupy 23. 4 % of the product. On the base of this result it can be deducted that this product has probably a lower quality than other ones. In comparison with other fats, the content of acid typical for milk fakt is higher in the Lando and Iva fats. This results indicate the milk fat was probably added in these products during the production. In the time period of one year no considerable changes in the composition of selected hardened fats were registered, however, from the long termed point-of-view, there is an evident marked alternation in the composition of the Ceres Soft and Omega hardened fats being accompanied with a basic decrease of trans-acids...|$|E

5000|$|Tung oil or China {{wood oil}} is a drying oil {{obtained}} by pressing the seed from the nut of the tung tree (Vernicia fordii).
