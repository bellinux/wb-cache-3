5|$|Architect Carl Frederik Stanley (1769–1805), {{educated in}} Copenhagen, spent some years in Norway {{around the turn}} of the 19th century. He did minor works for wealthy patrons in and around Oslo, but his major {{achievement}} was the renovation of the only seat of higher education in Christiania, the Oslo Katedralskole, completed in 1800. He added a classical portico to the front <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>older</b> structure, and a semi-circular auditorium that was sequestered by Parliament in 1814 as a temporary place to assemble, now preserved at Norsk Folkemuseum as a national monument.|$|E
5|$|Built in the {{vicinity}} <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>older</b> church, the Church of St Demetrius is a crossed-dome stone building.

It was only unearthed {{in the middle of the}} 19th century, when it was dedicated to Saint Demetrius. It was proclaimed a monument of culture of national importance in 1956.|$|E

5|$|Drosera anglica {{was first}} {{described}} by William Hudson in 1778. It has frequently been {{confused with the}} other circumpolar long-leaf Drosera, D. intermedia. This confusion was fueled by the resurfacing <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>older</b> name, D. longifolia (described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753), which was regarded as being too ambiguous in description and had been applied to specimens of both D. anglica and D. intermedia. Herbarium specimens were also a mix of the two species. These points led Martin Cheek to propose D. longifolia for rejection as a species name in 1998. The proposal was accepted and the taxon listed as rejected in 1999.|$|E
5|$|Nittany Furnace, known earlier as Valentine Furnace, was a {{hot blast}} iron furnace located in Spring Township, Centre County, Pennsylvania, United States.

5|$|Trondheim's first station, {{dating from}} 1864, was located at Kalvskinnet. In 1877 the current station {{was built to}} serve the Meråker Line to Sweden—since {{integrated}} into the Nordland Line. At {{the same time a}} connection was built between the two stations, and the central station took over as the main station serving Trondheim. In 1910 construction of a new station for the Dovre Line was started, finishing in 1921. The main station building consists <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>older</b> section in historicism brick, while the annex is in postmodernistic concrete and glass.|$|E

5|$|A gas-station scene {{within the}} episode {{was meant to}} {{establish}} what the brothers and the series are about—bantering, credit card scams, and classic rock; Kripke feared {{that it would be}} cut because it was character-based and did not further the episode's plot. He also did not want the series to feature ballad music typical of The WB network, and forced the use of classic rock for the soundtrack by writing the music into the script. For the episode's villain, Kripke used the well-known urban legend of the vanishing hitchhiker, but combined it with the Mexican legend of La Llorona to give the spirit more motivation and characterization. The ghost was younger in an earlier version of script, and murdered her parents instead of her children; this was revised to allow for the casting <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>older</b> actress.|$|E
5|$|Every {{window in}} the church {{contains}} coloured glass (except the two tiny windows in the chapel of St Padarn). The windows are mostly narrow single lancets, and {{at the ends of}} the transepts and at the west end are arranged one and two. Some are possibly mediaeval, in the same eroded yellow stone as the quoins. The west and south gables have three windows, spaced two below and one above. The north has two only window. There are four lancets to the nave on the north, with three and the porch to the south. The transepts also have single lancet windows east and west. The north transept has a nineteenth century two-light east window with the relieving arch <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>older</b> window well above.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the final}} defeat of Napoleon, the castle was {{disarmed}} and leased to John Manning, a Portland churchman, who converted {{it from a}} fortress into a private house. John's son, Charles Manning, took over the house in 1834 and continued to develop it. Among the Mannings' work was the conversion <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>older</b> house alongside the main castle, which had once housed the master gunner, into a grander property, known today as the Captain's House. In the late 1840s, the Portland Roads were converted into an artificial harbour {{through the construction of}} a breakwater, and new forts were built on the Verne heights and the sea front to protect it, although the structure of the old castle itself was left untouched by the growing complex of forts. Charles died in 1869 and, amid ongoing invasion fears, the War Office took over the castle again for use as accommodation for commissioned officers, including as a house for the adjutant of the Verne Citadel.|$|E

5|$|Historians have {{disagreed}} {{about its}} age, {{and the existence}} <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>older</b> church on the same site. The tower has been dated by its architecture to between 1230 and 1240, but other historians question this date and suggest the tower and {{the body of the}} church both date to the 14thcentury. The porch appears to be a 17thcentury addition. There is a tomb of Margaret deCamois in the nave. It has been suggested that its location there, rather than the chancel as would be expected for the family of the lord of the manor (which her surname suggests she was), may indicate that the church was built on the site of an earlier, smaller, church and the tomb was in the chancel of that church. Local historian Roger Chatterton-Newman disagrees, saying there would be no need for a church on the site any earlier.|$|E
5|$|However, further {{excavations}} {{revealed that}} the 8th-century temple was constructed over the remains <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>older</b> brick temple. According to Thirumoorthy, the garbhagriha or sanctum sanctorum of the brick temple was filled with sand and covered with granite slabs upon which the newer temple was constructed. Sathyamurthy, Superintendent, ASI Chennai Circle, said that the brick temple could be dated to the Sangam period as the shrine faced north unlike modern temples which face either east or west. This proved conclusively that the temple was constructed before the 6th or 7th century AD when the shilpa shastras, the canonical texts of temple architecture, were written. Estimates {{of the age of}} the brick shrine range from 1700 to 2200 years.|$|E
5|$|In {{an early}} draft {{of what would}} later become Shakugan no Shana, Yashichiro Takahashi set the story in a {{different}} dimension and described the main character as having the initial personality of Shana, but the appearance <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>older</b> woman similar to Margery Daw. However, after talking with an editor, Takahashi rewrote the character to have the appearance of a young girl. In doing so, he used Shana's small build to symbolize a story of growth and to emphasize the physical conflict between her and her opponents. Noizi Ito was contacted in early August 2002 to be the illustrator for the series, and she was very excited to work on the project after she read the manuscript for the first novel; {{this was the first time}} Ito drew illustrations for a book.|$|E

5|$|Rates was a {{small town}} during the Middle Ages which {{developed}} around the monastery established by Count Henry in 1100 on the site <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>older</b> temple and gained importance due to the legend of Saint Peter of Rates, first bishop of Braga, becoming a central site in the Portuguese way of Saint James. Of the millenarian monastery, the São Pedro de Rates Church remains {{and is one of}} the oldest and best preserved Romanesque monuments in Portugal and is classified as national monument since 1910. Bordering Rates, Balazar became a Christian pilgrimage destination in the 20th century due to Alexandrina Maria da Costa, died 1955, who gained fame as a Saint, beatified by Pope John Paul II.|$|E
5|$|The Beacon-class gunvessels were a {{class of}} {{composite}} gunboats built for the Royal Navy in the late 1860s.

They were generally deployed overseas to the China, East Indies, West Africa, Pacific, North America and West Indies Stations. In addition to , the ships fought pirates and suppressed the slave trade in East and West Africa. As their engines wore out in the mid-1880s, they were mostly retired and scrapped {{by the end of}} the decade. A few survived into the early 1900s as they were modified for harbour service before being sold or scrapped.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} part of {{the castle}} was its residential tower. This tower may have been built around 1341 on the site <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>older,</b> unfortified house owned by the family on the same site, incorporating {{part of the}} structure into the new, crenellated tower. Alternatively, the central tower may have been built at some point between the late 13th and early 14th centuries, complete with crenellations, {{in which case the}} licence from Edward III served only to allow Manners to extend the perimeter fortifications. By the 1350s, the castle was surrounded by a manor which included mills for corn and fulling, lime kilns and coal mines.|$|E
5|$|The {{two heads}} at Tres Zapotes, with the La Cobata head, are stylistically {{distinct}} from the other known examples. Beatriz de la Fuente views them as a late regional survival <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>older</b> tradition while other scholars argue that they are merely the kind of regional variant to be expected in a frontier settlement. These heads are sculpted with relatively simple headdresses; they have squat, wide proportions and distinctive facial features. The two Tres Zapotes heads are the earliest known stone monuments from the site. The discovery {{of one of the}} Tres Zapotes heads in the nineteenth century led to the first archaeological investigations of Olmec culture, carried out by Matthew Stirling in 1938.|$|E
5|$|The video premiered on October 4, 1994, on MTV. It {{begins with}} showing the {{neighborhood}} of Harlem, with Madonna as a singer in a small jazz club. She simply sits in the club with her band and sings for her small, mostly black and Latino audience. Interspersed throughout the video are scenes {{of people living in}} Harlem, doing their daily chores, including a supporting cast of transvestite prostitutes, a pimp, and a black gang member who shows off the scars on his body. During the intermediate verses, Madonna is shown writhing in the lap <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>older,</b> maternal woman, who symbolically baptizes her by splashing water on her forehead. Near the video's end, Madonna walks through the neighborhood and climbs a set of stairs to have a reunion with her family, a young Latin man and their supposed son. The video ends with Madonna smiling towards the camera while sitting at the nightclub.|$|E
