40|$|Objective— Angiotensin {{peptides}} play {{a central}} role in cardiovascular physiology and pathology. Among these peptides, angiotensin <b>II</b> (<b>Ang</b> <b>II)</b> has been investigated most intensively. However, further angiotensin peptides such as Ang 1 - 7, Ang III, and Ang IV also contribute to vascular regulation, and may elicit additional, different, or even <b>opposite</b> effects <b>to</b> <b>Ang</b> <b>II.</b> Here, we describe a novel Ang II-related, strong vasoconstrictive substance in plasma from healthy humans and end-stage renal failure patients. Methods and Results— Chromatographic purification and structural analysis by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight/time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF/TOF) revealed an angiotensin octapeptide with the sequence Ala-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe, which differs from <b>Ang</b> <b>II</b> in Ala 1 instead of Asp 1. Des[Asp 1]-[Ala 1]-Ang II, in the following named Angiotensin A (Ang A), is most likely generated enzymatically. In the presence of mononuclear leukocytes, <b>Ang</b> <b>II</b> is converted <b>to</b> <b>Ang</b> A by decarboxylation of Asp 1. Ang A has the same affinity to the AT 1 receptor as <b>Ang</b> <b>II,</b> but a higher affinity to the AT 2 receptor. In the isolated perfused rat kidney, Ang A revealed a smaller vasoconstrictive effect than <b>Ang</b> <b>II,</b> which was not modified in the presence of the AT 2 receptor antagonist PD 123319, suggesting a lower intrinsic activity at the AT 1 receptor. <b>Ang</b> <b>II</b> and <b>Ang</b> A concentrations in plasma of healthy subjects and end-stage renal failure patients were determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation mass-analysis, because conventional enzyme immunoassay for <b>Ang</b> <b>II</b> quantification did not distinguish between <b>Ang</b> <b>II</b> and <b>Ang</b> A. In healthy subjects, Ang A concentrations were less than 20 % of the <b>Ang</b> <b>II</b> concentrations, but the ratio Ang A / <b>Ang</b> <b>II</b> was higher in end-stage renal failure patients. Conclusion— Ang A is a novel human strong vasoconstrictive angiotensin-derived peptide, most likely generated by enzymatic transformation through mononuclear leukocyte-derived aspartate decarboxylase. Plasma Ang A concentration is increased in end-stage renal failure. Because of its stronger agonism at the AT 2 receptor, Ang A may modulate the harmful effects of <b>Ang</b> <b>II.</b> In this study, a new angiotensin-peptide of human plasma is described, which is characterized as a strong AT 2 -receptor agonist...|$|R

To determine whether increased circulating <b>ANG</b> <b>II</b> levels {{are responsible for}} the enhanced responsiveness, the adrenal and blood pressure responses <b>to</b> <b>ANG</b> <b>II</b> in human subjects were assessed four times: in balance on a high and a low salt diet and before and after the administration of a converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril). Before enalapril administration, sodium restriction signifi-cantly increased (p< 0. 02) plasma renin activity, <b>ANG</b> <b>II,</b> and aldosterone levels; the aldosterone response <b>to</b> <b>ANG</b> <b>II</b> was enhanced twofold (p< 0. 01); and the blood pressure response <b>to</b> <b>ANG</b> <b>II</b> infusion was reduced significantly (p< 0. 05). Despite a fixed and low plasma <b>ANG</b> <b>II</b> concentration when enalapril was employed, the adrenal response <b>to</b> <b>ANG</b> <b>II</b> on the low salt diet was enhanced to the same degree as that observed before administration of the converting enzyme inhibitor. Conversely, enalapril substantially altered the blood pressure response <b>to</b> <b>ANG</b> <b>II</b> with sodium restriction, com-pletely preventing the reduction in responsiveness. If the subjects were first given enalapril and then sodium intake was restricted, <b>ANG</b> <b>II</b> levels did not change significantly but renal excretion of both sodium and potassium was substantially modified.

40|$|Uric {{acid and}} the state of the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system in humans. BackgroundExperimental hyperuricemia is marked by an {{activated}} intrarenal renin-angiotensin system (RAS). The renal vascular response <b>to</b> exogenous angiotensin <b>II</b> (<b>Ang</b> <b>II)</b> provides an indirect measure of intrarenal RAS activity. We tested the hypothesis that the serum uric acid concentration predicts the renal vascular response <b>to</b> <b>Ang</b> <b>II.</b> MethodsA total of 249 subjects in high sodium balance had the renal plasma flow (RPF) response <b>to</b> <b>Ang</b> <b>II</b> measured. Para-aminohippuric acid (PAH) clearance was used to estimate RPF. Multivariable regression analysis determined if the serum uric acid concentration independently predicts the RPF response <b>to</b> <b>Ang</b> <b>II.</b> Variables considered included age, gender, race, body mass index (BMI), hypertension status, blood pressure, basal RPF, creatinine clearance, serum insulin, serum glucose, serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL), serum triglycerides, and plasma renin activity (PRA). ResultsUric acid concentration negatively correlated with the RPF response <b>to</b> <b>Ang</b> <b>II</b> (r=- 0. 37, P < 0. 001). In univariate analysis, age, BMI, hypertension, triglycerides, and blood pressure were negatively associated, and basal RPF, HDL, and female gender were positively associated with the RPF response <b>to</b> <b>Ang</b> <b>II.</b> In multivariable analysis, serum uric acid concentration independently predicted the RPF response <b>to</b> <b>Ang</b> <b>II</b> (β=- 5. 3, P < 0. 001).

40|$|Abstract—In spontaneously {{hypertensive}} rats (SHR), hypertension {{is mediated}} {{in part by}} an enhanced renovascular response <b>to</b> angiotensin (<b>Ang)</b> <b>II.</b> Pertussis toxin normalizes renovascular responses <b>to</b> <b>Ang</b> <b>II</b> and lowers blood pressure in SHR, suggesting a role for altered Gi signaling in the enhanced renovascular response <b>to</b> <b>Ang</b> <b>II</b> in SHR. <b>To</b> further investigate this hypothesis, we measured reductions in renal blood flow and increases in renovascular resistance in response to intrarenal infusions of <b>Ang</b> <b>II</b> in the presence and absence of coactivation of a 2 -adrenoceptors (ie, receptors selectively coupled to Gi) with UK 14, 304 in adrenalectomized, renal-denervated, captopril-pretreated SHR and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats. In SHR, but not Wistar-Kyoto rats, UK 14, 304 markedly enhanced renovascular responses <b>to</b> <b>Ang</b> <b>II</b> and vasopressin. However, UK 14, 304 did not enhance renovascular responses to methoxamine (a 1 -adrenoceptor agonist) in either strain. In uninephrectomized, normotensive Sprague-Dawley animals and in Sprague-Dawley rats with nongenetic hypertension induced by uninephrectomy, chronic administration of deoxycor-ticosterone acetate, and 1 % saline as drinking water, UK 14, 304 {{had little or no}} effect on renovascular responses <b>to</b> <b>Ang</b> <b>II.</b> In SHR, intrarenal infusions of U 73122, a phospholipase C/D inhibitor, blocked the enhancement of renovascular responses <b>to</b> <b>Ang</b> <b>II</b> by UK 14, 304.

40|$|Results from renal {{transplantation}} experiments {{demonstrate that}} a renal defect {{is responsible for}} the development of hypertension in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR). In addition, studies with inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system have shown that angiotensin <b>II</b> (<b>Ang</b> <b>II)</b> is required for the development and maintenance of hypertension in the SHR. These observations prompted us to propose the hypothesis that hypertension in these rats is due to an enhanced renal responsiveness <b>to</b> <b>Ang</b> <b>II.</b> The {{purpose of the present study}} was to determine whether an enhanced renal responsiveness <b>to</b> <b>Ang</b> <b>II</b> exists in adult (12 - to 14 -week-old) SHR relative to Wistar-Kyoto control rats. To prevent hypertension-induced changes in renal function in SHR, we maintained both strains in the normotensive state from 4 weeks of age with long-term captopril treatment (100 mg/kg per day). Intrarenal <b>Ang</b> <b>II</b> infusions induced a significantly greater decrease in renal blood flow and gloraernlar filtration rate and a significantly greater increase in renal vascular resistance in SHR compared with Wistar-Kyoto rats.

Pioglitazone blunted the systemic response <b>to</b> <b>ANG</b> <b>II</b> and abolished the increased responsiveness <b>to</b> <b>ANG</b> <b>II</b> induced by a HS diet.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the contribution of myocardial tissue angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) <b>to</b> angiotensin <b>II</b> (<b>Ang</b> <b>II)</b> formation in the heart is low compared to non-ACE pathways. However, {{little is known about}} the actual in vivo contribution of these pathways <b>to</b> <b>Ang</b> <b>II</b> formation in the human heart. Accordingly, we developed a method to quantify ACE and non-ACEmediated conversion of angiotensin I (<b>Ang</b> I) <b>to</b> <b>Ang</b> <b>II</b> across the myocardial circulation in human subjects. Using an intracoronary(lC) infusion of 123 |-Ang I before and during an IC infusion of enalaprilat, we measured the fractional conversion of <b>Ang</b> I <b>to</b> <b>Ang</b> <b>II</b> in coronary sinus blood samples by taking the ratio of the labeled <b>Ang</b> <b>II</b> activity <b>to</b> the sum of activity corresponding <b>to</b> labeled <b>Ang</b> I and <b>Ang</b> <b>II</b> after peptide extraction and separation by HPLC (activity ratio method). Results obtained from this method were confirmed by combined HPLC/RIA of both labeled and unlabeled Ang I and <b>Ang</b> <b>II</b> (RIA method). The initial experience has been obtained in orthotopic heart transplant recipients with normal cardiac function and coronary anatomy. After a six minute IC infusion of 123 |Ang I, fractional conversion of <b>Ang</b> I <b>to</b> <b>Ang</b> <b>II</b> was 0. 44 ± 0. 141, and 0. 43 ± 0. 084 (n= 4, mean±SD) as determined, respectively, by the activity ratio and RIA methods.

Single- or pauci-fiber recording of the sinus nerve revealed that the afferent response <b>to</b> <b>Ang</b> <b>II</b> was enhanced in the postnatally hypoxic carotid body. To determine whether the increased sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>Ang</b> <b>II</b> is mediated by changes in the functional expression of <b>Ang</b> <b>II</b> receptors in the carotid body chemoreceptors, cytosolic calcium ([Ca 2 +]i) was measured by spectrofluorimetry in fura- 2 acetoxymethyl ester-loaded type I cells dissociated from carotid bodies. <b>Ang</b> <b>II</b> (25 - 100 nM) concentration-dependently increased [Ca 2 +]i in the type I cells. The proportion of clusters of type I cells responsive <b>to</b> <b>Ang</b> <b>II</b> was higher in the postnatally hypoxic group than in the normoxic control (89 vs 66 %). In addition, the peak [Ca 2 +]i response <b>to</b> <b>Ang</b> <b>II</b> was enhanced 2 - to 3 -fold in the postnatally hypoxic group. The [Ca 2 +]i response <b>to</b> <b>Ang</b> <b>II</b> was abolished by pretreatment with losartan (1 μM), an AT 1 receptor antagonist, but not by PD- 123177 (1 μM), an AT 2 antagonist. Double-labeling immunohistochemistry confirmed that an enhanced immunoreactivity for AT 1 receptor was co-localized to the lobules of type I cells in the hypoxic group. In addition, RT-PCR analysis of subtypes of AT 1 receptors showed an up-regulation of AT 1 a but a down-regulation of AT 1 b receptors, indicating a differential regulation of the expression of AT 1 receptor subtypes by postnatal hypoxia in the carotid body. These data suggest that postnatal hypoxemia is {{associated with an increased}} sensitivity of peripheral chemoreceptors in response <b>to</b> <b>Ang</b> <b>II</b> and an up-regulation of AT 1 a receptor-mediated [Ca 2 +]i activity of the chemoreceptors.

Arterial wall thickening, perivascular fibrosis, and cardiac hypertrophy are significantly diminished in Ets 1 –/– mice compared with control mice in response <b>to</b> <b>Ang</b> <b>II.</b> The induction of 2 known targets of Ets- 1, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p 21 CIP and plasminogen activator inhibitor– 1 (PAI- 1), by <b>Ang</b> <b>II</b> is markedly blunted in the aorta of Ets 1 –/– mice compared with wild-type controls. Expression of p 21 CIP in VSMCs leads to cellular hypertrophy, whereas expression of p 21 CIP in endothelial cells is associated with cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and endothelial dysfunction. PAI- 1 promotes the development of perivascular fibrosis. We have identified monocyte chemoattractant protein– 1 (MCP- 1) as a novel target for Ets- 1. Expression of MCP- 1 is similarly reduced in Ets 1 –/– mice compared with control mice in response <b>to</b> <b>Ang</b> <b>II,</b> which results in significantly diminished recruitment of T cells and macrophages to the vessel wall.

A few studies have demonstrated that 5 -lipoxygenase (5 -LO) derived cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLT) contribute <b>to</b> <b>Ang</b> <b>II</b> evoked tension responses in rat aortic rings. Whether CysLT would contribute <b>to</b> <b>Ang</b> <b>II</b> evoked Ca 2 + mobilization in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRC) and rat aortic smooth muscle cells (ASMC) has not been investigated. In the present study, using primary cultures of NRC and minimally passaged cultures of rat ASMC, an effort was made to address this key issue. The agonists evoked increase in cytosolic free calcium ([Ca 2 +]i) level was determined by fura- 2 fluorescence measurement in NRC and ASMC. Total CysLT levels in the culture medium were determined using an ELISA kit. CysLT 1 /CysLT 2 receptor mRNA levels of NRC and ASMC were quantified by Northern blot analysis. In NRC, the AT 1 but not the AT 2 selective antagonist, attenuated the elevations in [Ca 2 +]i and CysLT levels evoked by <b>Ang</b> <b>II.</b> Vasopressin (AVP) and endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) increased [Ca 2 +]i but not CysLT levels. The 5 -LO inhibitor, AA 861, and the CysLT 1 selective antagonist, MK- 571, reduced the maximal [Ca 2 +]i responses (Emax) <b>to</b> <b>Ang</b> <b>II</b> but not <b>to</b> AVP and ET- 1. While CysLT 1 antagonist reduced the Emax to leukotriene D 4, (LTD 4), the dual CysLT 1 /CysLT 2 antagonist, BAY u 9773, completely blocked the [Ca 2 +]i elevation to both LTD 4 and leukotriene C 4 (LTC 4). Both CysLT 1 and CysLT 2 mRNA were detected in NRC. The inositol 1, 4, 5 triphosphate (InsP 3) antagonist, 2 -aminoethoxyphenyl borate (2 -APB), attenuated the [Ca 2 +]i responses <b>to</b> <b>Ang</b> <b>II</b> and LTD 4. In ASMC, <b>Ang</b> <b>II,</b> ET- 1 and AVP evoked [Ca 2 +]i responses were significantly higher in the cultured ASMC isolated from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) compared to ASMC derived from age-matched normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) strain. Addition of either MK 571 or BAY u 9773, reduced the Emax values <b>to</b> <b>Ang</b> <b>II</b> (but not <b>to</b> ET- 1 and AVP) in both strains. While BAY u 9773 abolished the [Ca 2 +]i responses evoked by both LTD 4 and LTC 4, MK 571, the CysLT 1 antagonist reduced the responses evoked by LTD 4 but not LTC 4. The basal CysLT levels were higher in the ASMC of SHR. <b>Ang</b> <b>II</b> but not ET- 1 and AVP evoked time and concentration dependent increases in CysLT levels in ASMC of both WKY and SHR strains. The AT 1 selective antagonist, losartan, but not the AT 2 antagonist, PD 123319, attenuated the increases in [Ca 2 +]i and CysLT levels evoked by <b>Ang</b> <b>II.</b> The InsP 3 antagonist, attenuated the [Ca 2 +]i responses <b>to</b> <b>Ang</b> <b>II,</b> LTD 4 and LTC 4.

BackgroundChronic treatment of mesangial cells with insulin-like growth factor- 1 (IGF- 1) results in intracellular lipid accumulation. These mesangial cells resemble foam cells. MethodsTo determine whether this phenotype affects cell function, lipid-laden mesangial cells were tested {{for their ability}} to migrate in response to IGF-binding protein- 5 (IGFBP- 5) and to contract in response <b>to</b> angiotensin <b>II</b> (<b>Ang</b> <b>II).</b> IGFBP- 5 binding and subsequent activation of the signal transduction cascade for migration were examined. To confirm that lipid accumulation was responsible for impaired contractility, lipid was removed from lipid-laden mesangial cells and the cells were re-tested for contractile response <b>to</b> <b>Ang</b> <b>II.</b> ResultsIn comparison <b>to</b> control mesangial cells, lipid-laden cells failed to migrate in response to IGFBP- 5. Although cellular binding of IGFBP- 5 was not altered by lipid accumulation, IGFBP- 5 failed to activate cdc 42, a Rho GTPase required for IGFBP- 5 -mediated mesangial cell migration. These data indicate that lipid accumulation within the mesangial cell interferes with the signal transduction response to IGFBP- 5. In addition, mesangial cells treated with IGF- 1 had reduced contraction <b>to</b> <b>Ang</b> <b>II.</b> When lipid accumulation was exaggerated by adding cholesteryl esters to the culture medium, mesangial cells failed to contract in response <b>to</b> <b>Ang</b> <b>II.</b> Following removal of excess lipid from these mesangial cells, the contractile response <b>to</b> <b>Ang</b> <b>II</b> was restored.

Pressor responses <b>to</b> angiotensin <b>II</b> (<b>Ang</b> <b>II),</b> norepinephrine, and va-sopressin were studied in normal conscious rats before and after administration of RU 486. At 20 mg/kg/day, RU 486 significantly blunted pressor responses <b>to</b> <b>Ang</b> <b>II</b> and norepinephrine, whereas those to vasopressin were not greatly affected. At a lower dose, RU 486 did not alter pressor responses; at a higher dose, it augmented them, probably through its agonistic glucocorticoid effect. At 20 mg/kg/day, RU 486 antagonized the enhancing effect of a glucocorticoid agonist on pressor responses <b>to</b> <b>Ang</b> <b>II,</b> norepinephrine, and vasopressin.

Analysis of ZG cell EET production by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry demonstrated an increase in EETs and dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids with <b>Ang</b> <b>II</b> stimulation.

40|$|Women with preeclampsia have {{enhanced}} vascular reactivity <b>to</b> Angiotensin <b>II</b> (<b>Ang</b> <b>II)</b> {{and extensive}} vascular infiltration of neutrophils. The primary mechanism to enhance vessel reactivity is RhoA kinase that phosphorylates MYPT 1 to inhibit myosin light chain (MLC) phosphatase. Therefore, MLCs remain phosphorylated and increase sensitivity to calcium. Neutrophils release {{reactive oxygen species}} (ROS), which can activate this pathway, so we hypothesized that neutrophils would enhance vessel reactivity <b>to</b> <b>Ang</b> <b>II.</b> Omental vessels from normal pregnant women were used to study vascular reactivity. <b>Ang</b> <b>II</b> dose response (0. 001 - 10 µM) was significantly enhanced with perfusion of neutrophils (3 ̆c 2000 /mm 3, activated with IL- 8) or ROS. Addition of superoxide dismutase (SOD) /Catalase to quench ROS or 3 µM Y- 27632, a specific RhoA kinase inhibitor, blocked enhancement. Vascular smooth muscle expression of pMYPT 1 and pMLC in cell culture was significantly increased by neutrophils or ROS. The increase was prevented by Y- 27632. RhoA kinase activity assay showed a 3 -fold increase in RhoA kinase activity in omental vessels treated with ROS. Similarly, ROS also enhanced vessel reactivity to another vasoconstrictor, norepinephrine, via RhoA kinase. In preeclamptic women, increased neutrophil infiltration is associated with increased vascular expression and production of matrix metalloproteinase- 1 (MMP- 1). MMP- 1 activates protease activated receptor- 1 (PAR- 1), which could cause endothelial endothelin- 1 release, so we considered a novel hypothesis that MMP- 1 might cause vasoconstriction and enhance vessel reactivity <b>to</b> <b>Ang</b> <b>II</b> via PAR- 1. Omental vessels perfused with activated MMP- 1 (0. 025 - 25 ng/ml) showed dose-dependent vasoconstriction. Perfusion of activated MMP- 1 (2. 5 ng/ml) significantly enhanced dose response to angiotensin II. MMP- 1 mediated vasoconstriction and enhanced vessel reactivity <b>to</b> <b>Ang</b> <b>II</b> was abolished by co-perfusion of 10 µM SCH- 79797, a specific PAR- 1 blocker, and by 5 µM BQ- 123, a specific endothelin- 1 type A receptor blocker.

Subsequently, renal hemodynamic responses <b>to</b> intravenous angiotensin <b>II</b> (<b>Ang</b> <b>II,</b> 30 – 300 [*]ng/kg/min) were tested under anesthesia, while renal perfusion pressure was held constant.

We examined sex differences in renin-angiotensin system (RAS) function by measuring renal hemodynamic function and circulating plasma components of the RAS at baseline {{and in response to}} graded infusions of <b>Ang</b> <b>II.</b> MethodsWe studied two groups of normal healthy subjects, 24 men and 24 women, mean age 28 ± 1 years, ingesting a controlled sodium and protein diet.

ResultsMean baseline values for mean arterial pressure and aldosterone were lower in women, whereas values for plasma <b>Ang</b> <b>II,</b> GFR, ERPF, and filtration fraction (FF) did not differ. In response <b>to</b> <b>Ang</b> <b>II,</b> both groups exhibited a similar increase in mean arterial pressure and a decline in ERPF.
