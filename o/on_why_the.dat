5|$|A port of {{the game}} for the PlayStation 3 was {{announced}} in April 2009. The port features full voice acting, containing nearly twice as much voice work as the original voice script, which covers previously unvoiced cutscenes in the 360 version. The game also features various new characters, has Flynn as a permanent playable character, and adds a new playable character {{in the form of}} Patty Fleur. Development on the port began in 2008, after the release of the original version. Speaking <b>on</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> port was being developed, a developer who worked on Vampire Rain said that companies like Namco Bandai first developed for the Xbox 360 due to superior funding and development support when compared to Sony, then ported to PS3 with minimal effort so they could recoup development costs and add features that needed to be cut from the original game.|$|E

5|$|There {{was also}} much {{speculation}} {{at the time}} in the Adelaide and Melbourne press <b>on</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> lifeboats had not been launched earlier. Survivor James Fitzgerald pointed out in his recollection that, had the lifeboats been filled to capacity, no one would have survived the severe weather conditions experienced. He also commented that passenger vessels were not required to carry enough lifeboats, concluding that there were insufficient places for all Gothenburgs passengers and crew. It was not until RMS Titanic sank some 37 years later in 1912, that it was made compulsory for all British registered ships to carry sufficient lifeboats for everyone on board.|$|E
5|$|Though these {{measures}} were established to counter {{many of the}} irrationalities in the Soviet economic system, the reform {{did not try to}} change the existing system radically; it instead tried to improve it gradually. Success was ultimately mixed, and Soviet analyses <b>on</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> reform failed to reach its full potential have never given any definitive answers. The key factors are agreed upon, however, with blame being put on the combination of the recentralisation of the economy with the decentralisation of enterprise autonomy, creating several administrative obstacles. Additionally, instead of creating a market which in turn would establish a pricing system, administrators were given the responsibility for overhauling the pricing system themselves. Because of this, the market-like system failed to materialise. To make matters worse, the reform was contradictory at best. In retrospect, however, the Eighth Five-Year Plan as a whole is considered {{to be one of the}} most successful periods for the Soviet economy, and the most successful for consumer production.|$|E

Europe's many natural barriers allowed the development of competing nation-states. Such competition forced the European nations to encourage innovation and avoid technological stagnation.|$|E

This was unusual since the major languages of Pakistan are Punjabi and Urdu.

25|$|Questions {{were raised}} <b>on</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> SS Uganda {{did not come}} to give {{assistance}} when the distress rockets were fired. The captain of the ship, Captain Kilpatrick, stated that he thought the lights were from Troubridge Island Lighthouse, and were not distress signals; as a result, he continue on according to procedure. This excuse was challenged {{by the fact that the}} locals nearby could see and identify the lights as distress signals. Furthermore, one of the survivors stated that the SS Uganda did answer the distress signal by replying with an answering light. This suggests that they knew what it was but did not came to help them.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} {{different}} statements <b>on</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> couple's relationship ended in 1973. Robert Lacey wrote in his 2008 book, Royal: Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, that Charles had met Camilla too early, {{and that he had}} not asked her to wait for him when he went overseas for military duties. Sarah Bradford wrote in her 2007 book, Diana, that a member of the close circle of his great-uncle Lord Mountbatten claimed Mountbatten arranged for Charles to be taken overseas to end the relationship with Camilla to make way for an engagement between his granddaughter, Amanda Knatchbull, and Charles. Some sources suggest the Queen Mother did not approve of the marriage because she wanted Charles to marry one of the Spencer family granddaughters of her close friend, Lady Fermoy. Other sources also suggest Camilla did not want to marry Charles but instead wanted to marry Andrew Parker Bowles since she had an on and off relationship with Parker Bowles that began in the 1960s or that Charles had decided he would not marry until he was thirty years old.|$|E

25|$|Bill Oberst, {{the actor}} playing Sherman, {{states in a}} behind-the-scenes {{featurette}} that while the general {{will always be a}} controversial figure, he hopes that the documentary will shed light <b>on</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> man did what he did. It emphasizes that Sherman was loved by the enslaved blacks whom he freed and that while he did not see himself as fighting to destroy slavery, he nevertheless made a point of treating blacks whom he met with courtesy and respect. (The documentary also shows the reactions of his soldiers as they met blacks along the March. Many had never seen a black person and were surprised to learn that blacks were ordinary people.) The documentary also mentions that Sherman killed far fewer Confederate soldiers and civilians than did Ulysses S. Grant, his friend and fellow general, yet Sherman was the one vilified. The scholars interviewed postulate that the South had need for a scapegoat {{in the wake of the}} Civil War and that Sherman was the easiest target. For his part, Sherman is stated to have seen himself as only doing his duty and that he did not care what people said about him one way or the other.|$|E
25|$|Those {{involved}} {{have different}} opinions <b>on</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> merger with North Melbourne was rejected, despite negotiations being so far advanced and indeed concluded {{on the morning}} of the 4 July. The other AFL club presidents rejected the North Melbourne-Fitzroy merger by a vote of 14–1. It was commonly thought, and claimed by then Richmond president Leon Daphne, that the potential on-field and off-field strength of an all-Victorian merge would create a superteam, particularly considering that North Melbourne was the premier in 1996, and because the merged team had proposed to take a 50-player senior list into the 1997 season. This is compared with the Brisbane Lions bid, which proposed a 44-player senior list for 1997, and did not have the potential off-field strength of an all-Victorian merge. Then North Melbourne CEO Greg Miller has accused the AFL of contriving the two bids in this manner to manufacture a result which would fulfil its strategic direction to strengthen the game in Queensland. Additionally, then North Melbourne vice-president Peter de Rauch believes that his club's decision not to include Fitzroy president Dyson Hore-Lacy on the board of the merged club was a catalyst for the temporary unravelling of negotiations between the clubs, allowing the appointment of the administrator and keeping the Brisbane Bears involved in the merger negotiations.|$|E

500|$|For the Los Angeles {{production}} in 1990, Sellars made revisions to darken the opera {{in the wake}} of the Tiananmen Square protests. [...] The original production had not had an intermission between Acts 2 and 3; one was inserted, and Sellars authorized supertitles, which he had forbidden in Houston. [...] Adams conducted the original cast in the French premiere, at the Maison de la Culture de Bobigny, Paris, on December 14, 1991.

Jose Baldicanas, the nation's Transportation Undersecretary, said the ship was given a permit to sail because the weather was clear when it left for Tacloban. However, Philip Tuazon, administrator of the government's Maritime Industry Authority, ordered the company in court to explain why they should not lose their license for the accident; On October 28, a four-man Senate committee headed by Senator John Osmena blamed the tragedy on the ship's captain, the Coast Guard, and the Philippine Weather Bureau for permitting the Marilyn to sail from Manila. Sulpicio Lines also denied claims from victims of under counting the number of passengers on board.|$|E

500|$|The only {{record of}} {{forensic}} testing {{that has been}} uncovered is an acknowledgement by a forensic biologist of four items being received for testing on 6November 1989: three items of Leigh's clothing, and the blood-stained rock found near her body.

Results from the supposed tests were never made available, nor was information <b>on</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> other items were not sent.

On introducing Ghost Rider, Whedon said that [...] "with Doctor Strange coming out this year, the Marvel [...] Universe is moving into new waters," [...] referring to the exploration of magic. [...] "We felt that this was obviously a great character that we'd love to have on our show that we feel fits with that shift."
