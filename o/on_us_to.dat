500|$|... "Northern Lites" [...] {{was written}} by singer Gruff Rhys about [...] "the weather", and was {{particularly}} inspired by coverage of the [...] "terrifying, worldwide, seven-year phenomenon" [...] of the west Pacific El Niño climate pattern on [...] "weather channels" [...] in 1998. The song's title refers to the Aurora Borealis, a natural light display which can be observed particularly in the polar regions, and usually at night. The band were convinced that they had seen the lights before the track was written but, as no-one else was present, they could not get confirmation that what they had witnessed {{was not simply a}} [...] "Furry fantasy". Rhys has claimed that he would have called the song [...] "Aurora Borealis" [...] but [...] "Latin song titles are out of the question". Although Rhys has said that the song is [...] "about asking Jesus if he decides to seek his revenge <b>on</b> <b>us,</b> <b>to</b> get it over with as soon as possible and blow us away to the Northern Lights" [...] he has also stated that, although some critics have interpreted the track as being about [...] "questioning one's faith", it is really [...] "just a song about the weather".|$|E
500|$|The {{mounting}} {{pressure to}} appeal to a mainstream audience, the quick change of tastes in British rock fans with the decline of the NWOBHM phenomenon and the chance to have a breakthrough in the US market prompted Girlschool to change their music, starting with the album Screaming Blue Murder in 1982. Their sound, following the success of Def Leppard's album Pyromania, became more polished with the introduction of keyboards on Play Dirty and veered toward hard rock and glam metal, losing the raw edge of their early works. [...] "We were signed to an American label (...) there was a certain amount of pressure exerted <b>on</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> sound more American" [...] was McAuliffe explanation, speaking about the tame sound of the album Running Wild. The band appearance also changed to a more feminine and sophisticated style, imitating the successful American glam metal bands of the time and generally following the direction of the market. However, the failed attempt to create a niche for Girlschool in the USA and the rapidly changing record market behaviour made the band change their mind and go back to their original sound, which they retain to this day. Girlschool's members themselves described their music in different ways, from [...] "slapstick rock" [...] to [...] "raucous (...) heavy metal rock 'n' roll", and, even acknowledging the common origin of their music in the NWOBHM, they sometimes found it difficult to associate their songs to a single genre or subgenre of rock music.|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} saw {{the season}} as [...] "two shows"; Wyman noted, [...] "It's <b>on</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> make the mythology over there just as compelling as the mythology here, so we will enjoy both of them. We have our characters going back and forth, there or here, but there's {{a whole set of}} nice characters that you'll become very interested in very quickly. It's interesting because it gives you that gearshift." [...] Wyman later added that parallel universe plot device [...] "really allowed us to explore the characters deeper via their doppelgängers, to illuminate characters we already know. It’s been a real gas for all of us involved in making the show." [...] Historical idiosyncrasies were inserted into the parallel universe, such as a still-living John F. Kennedy, the non-existence of the FBI, and the Back to the Future franchise starring Eric Stoltz rather than Michael J. Fox. The writers loved creating an entire new world, and asked themselves what life would have been like in its most mundane forms, such as within daily routines. Pinkner thought it allowed them to create and explore many [...] "what-if" [...] moments, such as if the September 11 attacks had occurred against the White House instead of the Twin Towers, or if the Statue of Liberty still possessed its shiny copper sheen. [...] "Entrada", the eighth episode, {{was the first of the}} season to divide its time between both universes.|$|E

2500|$|Although The Someloves' Mather was not {{interested}} in touring or even performing live, the other members created Dom Mariani's Orange with the line-up of Mariani, Moon, Italiano and Zupanovich to showcase the album. They also recorded a track, [...] "Christ-masonic", for a various artists' compilation, Rockin' Bethlehem: The Second Coming (1990). In 1998 Mariani described how Orange developed, [...] "The Someloves was a loose studio idea ... I was hanging out to play live again but Darryl wasn't into it ... the record company were also putting the pressure <b>on</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> go on the road ... The album had been well received, so it was a real shame we couldn't go on with it. So it became Orange". Orange performed The Someloves' and some new material but by mid-1991 Orange had also disbanded. In 2006, Half A Cow records issued [...] "Don't Talk About Us: The Real Pop Recordings of the Someloves 1985-89" [...] which collected together every official recording The Someloves made.|$|E

2500|$|For him, [...] "There {{is in fact}} a {{multitude}} of ways to practice philosophy, but out of this multitude, the dominant historiography picks one tradition among others and makes it the truth of philosophy: that is to say the idealist, spiritualist lineage compatible with the Judeo-Christian world view. From that point on, anything that crosses this partial – in both senses of the word – view of things finds itself dismissed. This applies to nearly all non-Western philosophies, Oriental wisdom in particular, but also sensualist, empirical, materialist, nominalist, hedonistic currents and everything that can be put under the heading of [...] "anti-Platonic philosophy"" [...] "His mission is to rehabilitate materialist and sensualist thinking and use it to re-examine our relationship to the world. Approaching philosophy as a reflection of each individual's personal experience, Onfray inquires into the capabilities of the body and its senses and calls <b>on</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> celebrate them through music, painting, and fine cuisine." ...|$|E
