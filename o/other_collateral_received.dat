40|$|The {{striatum}} {{forms the}} main input structure to the Basal Ganglia (BG), a subcortical structure {{involved in the}} selec-tion and reinforcement learning of action sequences. It is 90 % composed of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) which inhibit each <b>other</b> through <b>collaterals,</b> <b>receive</b> excitatory projections from cortex and are the only cells projecting outside the striatum. Because of its inhibitory structure the MSN network is often thought to act selectively, trans-mitting the most active cortical inputs downstream in the BG while suppressing others. However studies show that local MSN network connections are too sparse and weak to perform global selection and their function remains puzzling. Here we suggest that rather than generating a static stimulus dependent activity pattern the MSN net-work is optimized to generate stimulus dependent dyna...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{investigate}} {{the hypothesis that}} the time to washout of radiographic contrast medium trapped distal to an occluded <b>collateral</b> <b>receiving</b> vessel is inversely related to collateral flow, and that this provides an accurate method for characterising coronary collaterals.  METHODS—An intracoronary pressure derived collateral flow index was determined in 54  patients undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary balloon angioplasty (PTCA). The study group was subdivided according to whether the collateral vessels were sufficient (n =  17) or insufficient (n =  37) to prevent ECG signs of myocardial ischaemia during PTCA. Washout collaterometry—an angiographic washout method—was carried out simultaneously; after injection of radiographic contrast medium into the <b>collateral</b> <b>receiving</b> vessel followed immediately by vascular occlusion, the number of heart beats was counted until approximately half the length of the epicardial vessel was cleared of contrast.  RESULTS—The collateral flow index was higher (0. 28  (0. 09) v 0. 12  (0. 07); p <  0. 0001) and the contrast washout time shorter (8. 0  (2. 9) v 17. 5  (6. 7) heart beats; p <  0. 0001) in patients with sufficient versus insufficient collaterals. There was an inverse correlation between contrast washout time and collateral flow index (r =  0. 72, p <  0. 0001). Washout of contrast distal to the occluded vessel within 11  heart beats correctly determined sufficient and insufficient collaterals with 88 % sensitivity and 81 % specificity.  CONCLUSIONS—Washout collaterometry is a new radiographic contrast washout method based on the inverse relation between collateral flow and the time to clearance of radiographic dye injected into the ipsilateral vessel during PTCA. It appears to be an accurate method of characterising coronary collateral vessels.    Keywords: coronary artery disease; collateral circulation; coronary angiograph...|$|R
