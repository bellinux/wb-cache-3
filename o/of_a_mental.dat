5|$|When a {{defensive}} player has {{the ball and}} can end the play by preventing further advance, but fails to do so because <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> mistake (not an error) and a runner subsequently scores, the official scorer must decide whether to credit the batter with a run batted in (RBI). If the runner recognized the mistake after slowing or pausing his advance, an RBI is not credited. If the runner was oblivious to the mistake or runs home without slowing, the batter is credited with an RBI.|$|E
5|$|Many mental states {{seem to be}} {{experienced}} subjectively in different ways by different individuals. And it is characteristic <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> state that it has some experiential quality, e.g. of pain, that it hurts. However, the sensation of pain between two individuals may not be identical, since {{no one has a}} perfect way to measure how much something hurts or of describing exactly how it feels to hurt. Philosophers and scientists therefore ask where these experiences come from. The existence of cerebral events, in and of themselves, cannot explain why they are accompanied by these corresponding qualitative experiences. The puzzle of why many cerebral processes occur with an accompanying experiential aspect in consciousness seems impossible to explain.|$|E

5|$|One {{can solve}} these problems, {{according}} to Fodor, with functionalism, a hypothesis {{which was designed}} to overcome the failings of both dualism and reductionism. What is important is the function <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> state regardless of the physical substrate which implements it. The foundation for this view lies in the principle of the multiple realizability of the mental. Under this view, for example, I and a computer can both instantiate ("realize") the same functional state though we are made of completely different material stuff (see graphic at right). On this basis functionalism can be classified as a form of token materialism.|$|E
5|$|What {{all these}} {{different}} varieties of functionalism share in common is the thesis that mental states are characterized by their causal relations with other mental states and with sensory inputs and behavioral outputs. That is, functionalism abstracts away from {{the details of the}} physical implementation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> state by characterizing it in terms of non-mental functional properties. For example, a kidney is characterized scientifically by its functional role in filtering blood and maintaining certain chemical balances. From this point of view, it does not really matter whether the kidney be made up of organic tissue, plastic nanotubes or silicon chips: it is the role that it plays and its relations to other organs that define it as a kidney.|$|E
5|$|In {{the opinion}} of the Moscow Helsinki Group {{chairwoman}} Lyudmila Alexeyeva, the attribution <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> illness to a prominent figure who came out with a political declaration or action is the most significant factor in the assessment of psychiatry during the 1960–1980s. The practice of forced confinement of political dissidents in psychiatric facilities in the former USSR and Eastern Europe destroyed the credibility of psychiatric practice in these countries. When psychiatric profession is discredited {{in one part of the}} world, psychiatry is discredited throughout the world. Psychiatry lost its professional basis entirely with its abuse to stifle dissidence in the former USSR and in the so-called euthanasia program in Nazi Germany. There is little doubt that the capacity for using psychiatry to enforce social norms and even political interests is immense. Now psychiatry is vulnerable because many of its notions have been questioned, and the sustainable pattern of mental life, of boundaries of mental norm and abnormality has been lost, director of the Moscow Research Institute for Psychiatry Valery Krasnov says, adding that psychiatrists have to seek new reference points to make clinical assessments and new reference points to justify old therapeutical interventions.|$|E

5|$|On Indianapolis' {{first drive}} of the game, {{defensive}} back Chris Harris intercepted a deep, third-down pass from quarterback Peyton Manning {{and returned it}} 6 yards to the Bears' 35-yard line. However, Chicago could not gain a first down on their ensuing possession and {{they were forced to}} punt. After several short runs and passes, Manning beat the Bears' defense with a 53-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Reggie Wayne, cutting the Bears' lead to 7–6. The touchdown occurred because <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> error on the Bears' secondary. Cornerback Charles Tillman passed Reggie Wayne onto safety Danieal Manning. However, Manning chose to follow tight end Ben Utecht over the middle, leaving Wayne all alone. The score remained the same, at 7–6, after punter/holder Hunter Smith fumbled the snap on the point-after-touchdown (PAT) attempt. On the ensuing kickoff, Chicago tight end Gabe Reid fumbled Adam Vinatieri's bouncing kickoff while being tackled by Robert Mathis; Colts linebacker Tyjuan Hagler recovered the loose ball. However, on the next play, Indianapolis gave the ball back when running back Joseph Addai fumbled the handoff and Bears defensive end Mark Anderson recovered it.|$|E
5|$|Pitt {{featured}} in the David Fincher-directed, commercially successful thriller Seven (1995), in which he played a detective {{on the trail of}} a psychopathic serial killer. The role <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> patient in the science fiction film 12 Monkeys earned him the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor and an Academy Award nomination in the same category. He followed it with the role of Heinrich Harrer in the biopic Seven Years in Tibet (1997). Pitt reteamed with Fincher to star in the apocalyptic film Fight Club (1999) in a role that required him learn boxing, taekwondo, and grappling. A critical and commercial success, the film has since developed a cult status. Pitt portrayed Rusty Ryan in the commercially successful heist film series Ocean's Trilogy (2001–07). In 2002, he earned a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for his guest appearance in the sitcom Friends. Also that year, Pitt started a production company, Plan B Entertainment, whose first release was the epic war film Troy (2004), starring Pitt. He played an assassin opposite Angelina Jolie in the commercially successful action comedy Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005).|$|E

25|$|It {{is thought}} that this BPO {{pantomime}} preference is indicative of an undeveloped metarepresentational cognitive capacity, which emerges {{in the second year}} of life and leads to dominant use of IO pantomimes over BPO pantomimes beginning in the third year of life.

Development <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> state lexicon (i.e. language used to describe internal mental states, notably emotions) and some, but not all, components of pretend play are dependent on this capacity for metarepresentational cognition.|$|E

He crashed landed to Earth to participate in the Mortal Kombat tournament, but he, unfortunately, landed within the bounds <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> hospital. He is found by a young female patient named Blue, whom he befriends, and taken in by orderlies. After three months of therapy, his doctor believes that Raiden is still under the delusion that he is the God of Thunder, and constantly vomits a blue substance. He is swiftly lobotomized, but due to his supernatural abilities, recovers from it. He attempts to escape, but is lobotomized once again. Blue finds him and locks the door to the room, and Raiden tells her to stab him. After a tearful goodbye, Blue stabs him, causing him to disintegrate into lightning and smoke. Raiden reappears elsewhere and takes his signature hat from an old Chinese man. David Lee McInnis plays Raiden in the 2013 second series of Mortal Kombat: Legacy.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the relationships between}} public stigma, stigma by association (SBA), psychological distress, perceived closeness, perceived heredity, {{and the type of}} family relationship among family members <b>of</b> people with <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> illness. Method: In this cross-sectional survey, data from 527 family members <b>of</b> people with <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> illness were analyzed. Results: Perceptions of public stigma were found to be positively related to SBA and SBA correlated with greater psychological distress and less perceived closeness. SBA also mediated relationships between perceived public stigma and psychological distress, and between perceived public stigma and perceived closeness. Further, among participants who reported SBA, immediate family members showed lower levels of perceived closeness than extended family members. Also, the perceived heredity of mental illness was associated with perceptions of public stigma and psychological distress. Conclusion: The findings suggest that family members <b>of</b> people with <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> illness could benefit from education on mental illnesses, their treatment, {{and the extent to which}} they are hereditary. Additionally, particular attention should be paid to the psychological needs that arise from being <b>a</b> caregiver <b>of</b> someone with <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> illness...|$|R
