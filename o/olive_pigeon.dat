50|$|The Comoros <b>olive</b> <b>pigeon</b> (Columba pollenii) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Columbidae. It is found in Comoros and Mayotte.|$|E
50|$|The Cameroon <b>olive</b> <b>pigeon</b> (Columba sjostedti) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Columbidae. It is found in Cameroon and {{adjacent}} Nigeria.|$|E
50|$|The African <b>olive</b> <b>pigeon</b> {{builds a}} large stick nest up to 15 m {{high in a}} tree and lays one (rarely two) white eggs. The eggs are {{incubated}} for 17-20 days to hatching, and the chicks fledge in another 20 days.|$|E
50|$|Such an {{experiment}} was conducted, where {{two groups of}} pigeons were reared in separate, although identical aviaries composed of bamboo. Group one had air blown from the south containing olive oil and air from the north containing synthetic turpentine. This was reversed for group two. The pigeons were then released east of the loft; half had a drop of synthetic turpentine added to the bill, while the others were given a drop of <b>olive</b> oil. <b>Pigeons</b> from group one exposed to olive oil flew north, contrary to birds sentient to synthetic turpentine, which flew south. Consistent, but reversed results were found in group two.|$|R
50|$|Many of {{the plant}} species occur only {{in this part of}} Ghana, or in few other localities and part was {{declared}} as a specially protected GSBA (Globally significant Biodiversity area) following a national botanic survey of forest reserves by Ghana Forestry Dept. in the 1990s. The forest reserve contains many birds that are rare elsewhere in Ghana including afep <b>pigeon,</b> <b>olive</b> long-tailed cuckoo, African broadbill, least honeyguide, spotted honeyguide, common bristlebill and blue-headed crested-flycatcher. In a 2006 expedition to survey the reserve, scientists discovered two rare and possibly endangered species of primate in the reserve: Geoffroy's pied colobus (Colobus vellerosus) and the olive colobus (Procolobus verus), as well as 17 rare butterfly species and the critically endangered frog species Conraua derooi. Butterfly species include the Papilio antimachus, which has the widest wingspan {{in the world and the}} Mylothris atewa, which may be globally critically endangered.|$|R
50|$|The {{species of}} the <b>olive</b> <b>pigeon</b> are founded in areas {{including}} Chamico in the northwest, Lagoa Amelia, Zampalma, Nova Ceilão and Bombaim in the central ranges near Formoso Pequeno southwards to the valley of Rio Lo Grande and Xufexufe and Ana Chaves valleys.|$|E
50|$|The {{continued}} {{survival of}} the São Tomé <b>olive</b> <b>pigeon</b> depends upon stopping habitat loss in the remaining lowland rainforest of São Tomé, as does the survival of three other birds: the São Tomé ibis, São Tomé oriole, and São Tomé scops owl.|$|E
50|$|The São Tomé <b>olive</b> <b>pigeon</b> or maroon pigeon (Columba thomensis) is an {{endangered}} species of pigeon which is endemic to the islands of São Tomé and Príncipe {{off the coast of}} west Africa. It was described by José Vicente Barbosa du Bocage in 1888.|$|E
5000|$|Pollen's name is commemorated in the {{specific}} epithets of the Comoros <b>olive</b> <b>pigeon</b> (Columba pollenii [...] ), the Pollen's vanga (Xenopirostris polleni [...] ), the Mayotte chameleon (Furcifer polleni [...] ), and the Madagascar coastal skink (Madascincus polleni [...] ). He died on 7 May 1886 in The Hague, Netherlands.|$|E
50|$|Birds, {{frogs and}} other animals {{dominate}} the bay before the island was inhabited. Around the 19th century, wildlife became less dominant. Wildlife within the bay is not common as the earlier times. Several endangered birds includes the São Tomé <b>olive</b> <b>pigeon</b> are seen and rarely the São Tomé fiscal.|$|E
50|$|The {{settlement}} {{is just around}} a kilometer east of Obo Natural Park. Wildlife remains to be abundant throughout the area today such as the bird species of the São Tomé <b>olive</b> <b>pigeon</b> and the São Tomé fiscal, both are endangered. In recent years, some of the rare animals were partly endangered.|$|E
50|$|In South Africa, {{biological}} control {{is being used}} {{in an attempt to}} manage Solanum mauritianum - the flowerbud weevil Anthonomus santacruzi is being used as a control agent. S. mauritianum is a favoured food plant of the African <b>olive</b> <b>pigeon</b> (Columba arquatrix), the Cape bulbul, the Black-collared barbet, the Red-eyed dove and red-whiskered bulbul.|$|E
50|$|The African <b>olive</b> <b>pigeon</b> or Rameron pigeon (Columba arquatrix) is {{a pigeon}} {{which is a}} {{resident}} breeding bird in much of eastern and southern Africa from Ethiopia to the Cape. Populations also are found in western Angola, southwestern Saudi Arabia and northern Yemen. It is locally common, although sizeable gaps in its distribution occur due to its habitat requirements.|$|E
50|$|The African <b>olive</b> <b>pigeon</b> {{feeds on}} fruit and berries, mainly picked in the canopy, {{but it will}} also descend for fallen fruit and take some insects and caterpillars. In the south of its range, it favours the fruit of a highly {{invasive}} plant, the bugweed, Solanum mauritianum. Birds fly considerable distances from their roosts to feeding areas, and young or nonbreeding birds form flocks.|$|E
50|$|The {{adult male}} African <b>olive</b> <b>pigeon</b> {{is a large}} pigeon at 37 to 42 cm in length and a weight of 300 to 450 g. Its back and wings are maroon, with the {{shoulders}} heavily speckled with white spots. The underparts are maroon with heavy white spotting, and the head is grey with yellow patches around the eye, and a yellow bill. The neck plumage, used in display, is streaked maroon and white, the underwing and undertail are dark grey, and the feet are yellow.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{described}} as locally common {{in parts of}} Grand Comoro, the Comoros <b>olive</b> <b>pigeon</b> is in general a fairly scarce bird with a small total population. The chief threat it faces is the clearance of the forest habitat in which it lives, {{but it is also}} hunted on each of the four islands on which it is found. The population trend is unknown, but the total population is probably fewer than 10,000 individuals, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as [...] "near threatened".|$|E
50|$|Rio Xufexufe is a river {{flowing in}} Lembá District in island of São Tomé, São Tomé and Príncipe. Its {{etymology}} is of Angolan origin (Angolan spelling: Shufeshufe or Shufeshufi) The river flows southward and empties {{into the sea}} between the beaches of Palma and Pipa, it receives the waters from Rio Morango and flows through the settlements of São Miguel and Monte Rosa in front of Ilhéu Gabado. One of the birds founded within the stream include the São Tomé <b>olive</b> <b>pigeon</b> (Columba thomensis). Another individual of the São Tomé fiscal (Lanius newtoni) was sighted in 1990 near {{the source of the}} Rio Xufexufe, and a number of birds have been spotted since then.|$|E
5000|$|Female trees bear their fruit irregularly, {{only every}} few years. The fleshy epimatium of the strobilus (or [...] "cone") covers {{all of the}} seed, and ripens to a yellow colour, when it acquires a soft, jelly-like consistency. The main agents of seed {{dispersal}} are fruit bats, which eat the fleshy covering but discard the hard, woody seed. Many birds feed on the fruits, such as Cape parrot, purple-crested turaco, Knysna turaco, Ross's turaco, African <b>olive</b> <b>pigeon,</b> African green pigeon, and eastern bronze-naped pigeon. [...] Animals that feed on the seeds include colobus monkeys, bushpigs, hornbills, turacos, and rodents. These may not be effective seed dispersal agents, because it appears that seeds that have gone through animal guts do not germinate well.|$|E
5000|$|... 28 bird species, all forest dwellers, are {{endemic to}} ecoregion. Seven species are endemic to Príncipe. The endemic {{subspecies}} of olive ibis on Príncipe, B. o. rothschildi, {{is probably the}} rarest bird in the archipelago. Sixteen species are endemic to São Tomé, with two endemic genera. These include the São Tomé ibis (Bostrychia bocagei), São Tomé <b>olive</b> <b>pigeon</b> (Columba thomensis), São Tomé scops-owl (Otus hartlaubi), São Tomé fiscal (Lanius newtoni), São Tomé shorttail (Amaurocichla bocagii), giant sunbird (Nectarinia thomensis), São Tomé grosbeak (Neospiza concolor) and São Tomé oriole (Oriolus crassirostris). Annobón {{is home to the}} endemic Annobón white-eye (Zosterops griseovirescens) and Annobón paradise-flycatcher, (Terpsiphone smithii). An additional four endemic species inhabit two or more of the islands, including the Príncipe speirops (Speirops leucophoeus) and velvet-mantled drongo (Dicrurus modestus), which inhabit both São Tomé and Príncipe, and the São Tomé bronze-naped pigeon (Columba malherbii) which inhabits both São Tomé and Annobón.|$|E
40|$|There is {{an error}} in the fifth {{sentence}} of the first paragraph of the Results section. The correct sentence is: Pigeons and doves (Columbidae) sampled {{in this study were}} primarily parasitized byHaemoproteus parasites in the subgenus Haemoproteus (unpublished molecular analyses). However, one individual (African <b>olive</b> <b>pigeon)</b> was parasitized by a novelHaemoproteus line-age that was most closely related to the strigiform parasite Haemoproteus syrnii (subgenus Parahaemoproteus). There is {{an error in}} the second sentence of the final paragraph of the Discussion section. The correct sentence is: Of those lineages we identified that have been described (n = 47), 25 have been found only in Africa, 10 in both Africa and the western Palearctic, 5 only in the west...|$|E
