As Bayern Munich had won the 1965–66 DFB-Pokal, Dortmund's only chance <b>of</b> <b>participating</b> in European football the following season was to win the Cup Winners' Cup.|$|E

5|$|The American {{government}} saw {{the evacuation}} {{as an opportunity}} to weaken the communists by providing for and thereby winning the loyalty of the refugees to the anti-communist cause. The United States Operation Mission proposed that aside from helping to evacuate refugees to the south and thereby draining the communist population base, the Americans should provide healthcare, shelter, food and clothing in order to help the anti-communists win the fidelity of their compatriots. Another benefit <b>of</b> <b>participating</b> in the evacuation was that American personnel would be on the ground in North Vietnam, allowing them to gather intelligence on communist activities.|$|E
