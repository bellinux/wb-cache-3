5|$|However, the {{financial}} crisis of 2007–08 ended this period of stability, and, on 16 April 2007, the governor (at that time Mervyn King), was obliged to write the first MPC open letter to the chancellor (Gordon Brown), explaining why the inflation had deviated from the target of 2% per year {{by more than one}} percentage point (3.1%). By February 2013, he had had to write 14 such letters to chancellors. Between October 2008 and March 2009 the base rate was cut six times to an all-time low of 0.5% in order to avoid deflation and spur growth. In March 2009, the MPC launched a programme <b>of</b> <b>quantitative</b> easing, initially injecting £75 billion into the economy. By March 2010, it had also increased the amount of money set aside for quantitative easing to £200 billion, a figure later increased by a further £75 billion in the months following October 2011. The MPC announced two further £50 billion rounds <b>of</b> <b>quantitative</b> easing in February and July 2012, bringing the total to £375 billion whilst simultaneously keeping the base rate at 0.5%. In March 2013, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, called on the MPC to follow its American counterpart (the Federal Reserve Board) in committing itself to keeping interest rates low for a prolonged period of time via appropriate forward guidance, which it did on 7 August.|$|E

5|$|Quantitative {{chemicals}} {{are those that}} are present in high concentration in plants (5 – 40% dry weight) and are equally effective against all specialists and generalist herbivores. Most quantitative metabolites are digestibility reducers that make plant cell walls indigestible to animals. The effects <b>of</b> <b>quantitative</b> metabolites are dosage dependent and the higher these chemicals’ proportion in the herbivore’s diet, the less nutrition the herbivore can gain from ingesting plant tissues. Because they are typically large molecules, these defenses are energetically expensive to produce and maintain, and often take longer to synthesize and transport.|$|E
5|$|The {{ecological}} succession concept, pioneered in the 1900s and 1910s by Henry Chandler Cowles and Frederic Clements, {{was important in}} early plant ecology. Alfred Lotka's predator-prey equations, G. Evelyn Hutchinson's studies of the biogeography and biogeochemical structure of lakes and rivers (limnology) and Charles Elton's studies of animal food chains were pioneers among the succession <b>of</b> <b>quantitative</b> methods that colonized the developing ecological specialties. Ecology became an independent discipline in the 1940s and 1950s after Eugene P. Odum synthesized many of the concepts of ecosystem ecology, placing relationships between groups of organisms (especially material and energy relationships) {{at the center of}} the field.|$|E

Its aim was to publish and publicize the work of what was, by then, a growing number of students and collaborators (this is also the name used to refer to the group of students who developed his sociological program).

5|$|In January 2009 the Chancellor {{announced}} an Asset Purchase Facility (APF), {{to be administered}} by the MPC, aimed at ensuring greater liquidity in financial markets. The committee had already started to cut rates the previous autumn, but the effect of such changes {{can take up to}} two years and rates cannot go below zero. By March 2009, faced with very low levels on inflation and interest rates already at 0.5%, the MPC voted to start the process <b>of</b> <b>quantitative</b> easing (QE) – the injection of money directly into the economy – via the APF. It had the Bank buy government bonds (gilts), along with a smaller amount of high-quality debt issued by private companies. Although non-gilts initially made up a non-negligible part of the APF portfolio, as of May 2015 the entirety of the APF was held as gilts. On 7 August 2013, Governor Mark Carney issued the committee's first forward guidance as a third tool for controlling future inflation.|$|E
5|$|These {{measures}} eventually proved {{insufficient to}} avoid deflation. Having taken over in August 2013, Governor Mark Carney wrote his first open letter in February 2015 {{to explain why}} inflation had fallen below 1% {{for the first time}} in the MPC's history. This was followed by deflation of 0.1% in April 2015, the first month of negative CPI growth since the 1960s, and triggering a second letter. As of February 2015, Carney has written five such letters. Following the UK's vote to leave the European Union in June 2016, the MPC cut the base rate from 0.5% to 0.25%, the first change since March 2009. At the same time, it announced a further round <b>of</b> <b>quantitative</b> easing, valued at £60 billion, bringing the total to £435 billion.|$|E

40|$|A {{contract}} strategy is, {{in broad}} terms, the legal-managerial framework {{adopted by the}} client of a construction project for carrying out that project. There is a view that projects are often procured using inappropriate contract strategies and that the associated financial consequences are significant. Following a review of previous research, {{it was concluded that}} there was scope to develop a decision methodology that utilised quantitative techniques. A prototype model was developed to facilitate the application <b>of</b> the <b>quantitative</b> approach. The model computes probabilistic cost and time measures of a project's performance for each contract strategy that is evaluated. Several industrialists were invited to evaluate the principles <b>of</b> the <b>quantitative</b> approach. From the fourteen industrialists interviewed, six simulated an application <b>of</b> the <b>quantitative</b> approach. Despite initial scepticism, the potential value <b>of</b> the <b>quantitative</b> approach was recognised. The six industrialists who performed example applications <b>of</b> the <b>quantitative</b> approach indicated that, in their view, the approach was workable. In response to the findings of the empirical study, an upgraded version of the model was designed. This version also addressed several intellectual compromises which had been made {{in the development of the}} prototype model. The refined model is applied to two example projects in order to demonstrate the potential utility <b>of</b> the <b>quantitative</b> approach and also to provide guidance on how to apply the model. It is acknowledged that the quantitative approach does not single out the most appropriate contract strategy for any given project. However, it is believed that the quantitative approach is most suited to deal with the decision problem's inherent complexities and is most likely to minimise the risk of irrational contract strategy decisions. It is therefore concluded that an improved understanding of contract strategy selection may result, especially on a personal level, from continued application <b>of</b> the <b>quantitative</b> approach...|$|R
