40|$|Fear <b>of</b> <b>disease</b> {{progression}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} common sources of psychological distress in patients suffering from chronic <b>diseases.</b> Fear <b>of</b> <b>disease</b> progression is a situationspecific and fully discernible (reportable) emotion based on personal experience <b>of</b> a life-threatening <b>disease.</b> This article presents the results of a study of cancer patients’ coping behavior according to the levels <b>of</b> fear <b>of</b> <b>disease</b> progression experienced. The presence of pronounced fear <b>of</b> <b>disease</b> progression reflects a negative cognitive-affective response to one’s expectations for one’s own future; this response is related to a decrease in adaptive capacity. To determine the particular characteristics of coping strategies and coping resources in women with reproductive-system cancers according to the level <b>of</b> fear <b>of</b> <b>disease</b> progression. A total of 177 women with reproductive-system cancers were examined, among them 59 with breast cancer and 118 with gynecological cancers. Women with reproductive-system cancers have varying sets of coping strategies and coping resources according to their level <b>of</b> fear <b>of</b> <b>disease</b> progression. For each of the differentiated groups, specific characteristics of the strategies of coping with difficult life situations are described, along with cognitive self-regulation strategies specific to the illness and to coping resources. The women exhibiting moderate fear <b>of</b> <b>disease</b> progression significantly more often adhered to problem-oriented strategies of coping with difficult life situations and illness and had an internal locus of control regarding treatment. Patients with a low level <b>of</b> fear <b>of</b> <b>disease</b> progression tended to use strategies of positive reinterpretation of difficult life situations and illness; an external locus of control regarding treatment prevailed in this group. Patients found to have a dysfunctional level <b>of</b> fear <b>of</b> <b>disease</b> progression displayed significantly higher rates of using cognitive-regulation strategies focused on negative aspects of illness, as well as strategies for avoiding difficult life situations. Fear <b>of</b> <b>disease</b> progression is a psychological problem in women with reproductive-system cancers.
