40|$|After a brief {{review of}} the protein folding quantum theory and a short {{discussion}} on its experimental evidences the mechanism of glucose transport across membrane is studied from the point of quantum conformational transition. The structural variations among four kinds of conformations of the human glucose transporter GLUT 1 (ligand free occluded, <b>outward</b> open, ligand <b>bound</b> occluded and inward open) are looked as the quantum transition. The comparative studies between mechanisms of uniporter (GLUT 1) and symporter (XylE and GlcP) are given. The transitional rates are calculated from the fundamental theory. The monosaccharide transport kinetics is proposed. The steady state of the transporter is found and its stability is studied. The glucose (xylose) translocation rates in two directions and in different steps are compared. The mean transport time in a cycle is calculated and based on it the comparison of the transport times between GLUT 1,GlcP and XylE can be drawn. The non-Arrhenius temperature dependence of the transition rate and the mean transport time is predicted. It is suggested that the direct measurement of temperature dependence is a useful tool for deeply understanding the transmembrane transport mechanism. Comment: 18 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|One {{approach}} to the numerical solution of a wave equation on an unbounded domain uses a bounded domain surrounded by an absorbing boundary or layer that absorbs waves propagating <b>outward</b> from the <b>bounded</b> domain. A perfectly matched layer (PML) is an unphysical absorbing layer model for linear wave equations that absorbs, almost perfectly, outgoing waves of all non-tangential angles-of-incidence and of all non-zero frequencies. In a recent work [Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering 2003; 192 : 13378 ̆ 51375], the authors presented, inter alia, time-harmonic governing equations of PMLs for anti-plane and for plane-strain motion of (visco-) elastic media. This paper presents (a) corresponding time-domain, displacement-based governing equations of these PMLs and (b) displacement-based nite element implementations of these equations, suitable for direct transient analysis. The nite element implementation of the anti-plane PML {{is found to be}} symmetric, whereas that of the plane-strain PML is not. Numerical results are presented for the anti-plane motion of a semi-innite layer on a rigid base, and for the classical soil 8 ̆ 5 structure interaction problems of a rigid strip-footing on (i) a half-plane, (ii) a layer on a half-plane, and (iii) a layer on a rigid base. These results demonstrate the high accuracy achievable by PML models even with small bounded domains. Copyright 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

40|$|To a student, {{postgraduate}} {{research is}} often characterised {{as a very}} emotional process, more often associated with negative emotion that may hinder successful and speedy completion of the postgraduate degree. The supervisory relationship may impact greatly on the emotion the student experiences. Emotional labour is the induction or suppression of emotion in order to sustain an <b>outward</b> appearance. Being <b>bound</b> in a professional and often subordinate relationship, the student may not be willing, or able to, outwardly display their emotions. Yet, the existence of, and experience of emotional labour on students in a postgraduate supervisory relationship have not been studied to date. The {{purpose of the study}} is to explore the meaning and existence of emotional labour within the postgraduate supervisory relationship from a student’s perspective. By using a qualitative, descriptive approach, in-depth information has been gathered by means of three focus groups. The focus groups consisted of students at different stages of the postgraduate supervisory process. The study resulted in the linking of a student’s perspective of the supervisory process to the emotional labour process. It was found that emotional labour is indeed present in the postgraduate supervisory process, but is dependent on the relationship between the supervisor and the student. Since emotional labour has limitedly been explored in the academic environment, it is believed that supervisors as well as students can benefit from this exploration in this fresh context. This linking of emotional labour to the supervisory process is only the first stage in this research and seeks only to describe the process. Dissertation (MCom) [...] University of Pretoria, 2013.

40|$|A {{submersible}} {{study has}} been conducted in February - March 1978 at the axis of the East Pacific Rise near 21 °N. The expedition CYAMEX, the first submersible program to be conducted on the East Pacific Rise, {{is part of the}} French-American-Mexican project RITA (Rivera - Tamayo), a 3 -year study devoted to detailed geological and geophysical investigations of the East Pacific Rise Crest. On the basis of the 15 dives made by CYANA in the axial area of the Rise, a morphological and tectonic zonation can be established for this moderately-fast spreading center. A narrow, 0. 6 to 1. 2 km wide zone of extrusion (zone 1), dominated by young lava flows, is flanked by a highly fissured and faulted zone of extension (zone 2) with a width of 1 to 2 km. Further out, zone 3 is dominated by <b>outward</b> tilted blocks <b>bounded</b> by inward-facing fault scarps. Active or recent faults extend up to 12 km from the axis of extrusion of the East Pacific Rise.

Massive sulfide deposits, made principally of zinc, copper and iron, were found close to the axis of the Rise.

I especially enjoy'd the last hour or two. A moderate sea-breeze had set in; yet over the city, and the waters adjacent, was a thin haze, concealing nothing, only adding to the beauty.

40|$|Excitatory {{amino acid}} {{transporters}} (EAATs) are secondary active, electrogenic transporters which translocate L-glutamate (glu) against its concentration gradient using the co-transport of 3 Na+, 1 H+, and the counter-transport of 1 K+ ion. In addition, these carriers possess a thermodynamically uncoupled anion channel that fluxes Cl- but is promiscuous with several permeant anionic species. The roles of EAATs are {{to shape the}} spatio-temporal profile of released glu in both the synaptic cleft and extra-synaptic regions as well as maintaining a low ambient extracellular concentration of glu. This transport activity regulates activation of glu receptors and thus regulates excitatory neurotransmission. 	Using a combination of techniques, we were successful in identifying inward oriented transporter conformations which allow transitions to open channels states. This observation was enabled by our development of a novel method to isolate EAAT 1 in the inward facing conformation. While constrained to these conformations, currents with the same macroscopic amplitudes as conducting states mediated by the <b>outward</b> facing, Na+ <b>bound</b> states were observed. The persistence of currents is indicative of a channel gating mechanism that is insensitive to transporter orientation and that the anion channel is open during {{the majority of the}} transport cycle. Additional conducting states allows for a larger contribution of the anion channel function of EAATs to shape cellular function then previously assumed. 	Next we investigated the gating mechanism of the anion channel. We assayed for the ability of Na+ to gate the anion channel in both glial (EAAT 1 and EAAT 2) and neuronal (EAAT 3 and EAAT 4) isoforms. We discovered that the glial isoforms are not gated by Na+ but are leak channels with an open probability and single channel conductance that is insensitive to Na+ concentrations. In contrast, neuronal EAAT isoforms EAAT 3 and EAAT 4 both display Na+ dependent channel activity. This is the first example of a significant functional difference between glial and neuronal transporter isoforms of the solute carrier 1 (SLC 1) family. The research presented here allows for a greater understanding of low open probability channel states and the possible contributions of the EAAT anion channel to the functioning of the nervous system. ...|$|R
