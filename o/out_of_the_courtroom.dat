Through critical discourse analysis, Foucauldian approaches to law, power and sexuality, and feminist legal scholarship, I will analyse whether rape survivors are offered access to justice, adequate treatment during the trials, and support; eminently, I will examine possible relations of power and domination hidden behind these crimes and their prosecution, in and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtrooms...</b>|$|R

40|$|Research {{and data}} on school {{discipline}} practices are clear: millions {{of students are}} being removed from their classrooms each year, mostly in middle and high schools, and overwhelmingly for minor misconduct. When suspended, these students are at a significantly higher risk of falling behind academically, dropping <b>out</b> <b>of</b> school and coming {{into contact with the}} juvenile justice system. A disproportionately large percentage of disciplined students are youth of color, students with disabilities, and youth who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT). There is no question that when students commit serious offenses or pose a threat to school safety they may need to be removed from the campus or arrested. Such incidents, however, are relatively rare, and school typically remains the safest place a young person can be during the day. In schools with high rates of suspension for minor offenses, however, students and teachers often feel they are not safe or supported in their learning environment. Trailblazing student and parent groups, advocacy organizations, researchers, professional associations and school districts have raised <b>the</b> visibility <b>of</b> exclusionary discipline practices across the nation. In response, individual schools, districts, and state education systems have implemented research-based approaches to address student misbehavior that hold youth accountable address victims' needs, and effectively improve both student conduct and adult responses These approaches also help keep students engaged in classrooms and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>courtrooms</b> <b>The</b> federal government has also put a spotlight on these issues. As part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Supportive School Discipline Initiative, the U. S. Departments of Education and Justice issued joint guidance in January 2014 to assist public elementary and secondary schools in meeting their obligations under federal law to administer student discipline without discriminating on <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> race, color or national origin. The School Discipline Consensus Report builds on this foundation and breaks new ground by integrating some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> best thinking and innovative strategies from <b>the</b> fields <b>of</b> education, health law enforcement, and juvenile justice. Leaders in these diverse systems agree that local and state governments must not only help schools reduce <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> students suspended, expelled and arrested, but must also provide conditions for learning wherein all students feel safe, welcome, and supported. <b>The</b> central thesis <b>of</b> this comprehensive report is that achieving these objectives requires <b>the</b> combination <b>of</b> a positive school climate, tiered levels of behavioral interventions, and a partnership between education, police, and court officials that is dedicated to preventing youth arrests or referrals to the juvenile justice system for minor school-based offenses...|$|R

500|$|The prosecution's case rested {{largely on}} the {{testimony}} of two men who had pleaded guilty to participating in the holdup. The prosecution called four witnesses: Avon White and John Rivers (both of whom had already been convicted of the robbery) and the manager and teller of the bank. White and Rivers, although convicted, {{had not yet been}} sentenced for the robbery and were promised that the charges would be dropped in exchange for their testimony. White and Rivers testified that Shakur had guarded one of the doors with a [...]357 magnum pistol and that Sadiki had served as a lookout and drove the getaway truck during the robbery; neither White nor Rivers was cross-examined due to the defense attorney's refusal to participate in the trial. Shakur's aunt and lawyer, Evelyn Williams, was also cited for contempt after walking <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> after many of her attempted motions were denied.

Jones, representing Condon and O'Brien, clashed with the court almost immediately because the accused were handcuffed, saying [...] "It appears to be discreditable to the administration of justice that men whom the law presumes to be innocent should be brought into Court handcuffed together like a couple of hounds." [...] Jones also objected to the presence of a number of soldiers in the courtroom, and when the magistrate refused to order the prisoners' handcuffs to be removed he [...] "marched dramatically" [...] <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> saying [...] "Then {{as a member of the}} Bar I decline to sit in any Court where the police override the Magistrate...

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} representations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> {{trial in}} Hollywood cinema produced between 1934 and 1966. The primary method is close textual analysis, {{which has been}} neglected in previous work on trial sequences in cinema. However, I argue that a rigorous engagement with both <b>the</b> conventions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> trial form and individual films’ use of these conventions requires {{close attention to the}} text. The introductory chapter identifies the dominant conventions, meanings and ideology underpinning Hollywood representations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> trial by looking at <b>the</b> treatment <b>of</b> space, character, procedure and drama in a number of films produced between 1957 and 1962 that serve as a representative sample <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conventions <b>of</b> trial representation in Hollywood cinema. I conclude that <b>the</b> narrative scenario <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> trial tends to dictate a set of formal strategies that respect and affirm the American adversarial trial system. However, I also use this chapter to begin mapping out the ways in which individual films are able to nuance their representation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> trial despite its multitude of fixed components. My subsequent chapters examine how different genres and modes inflect <b>the</b> dominant representations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> trial as I look in detail at trial sequences in, respectively, the social problem film, the woman’s melodrama and film noir. This method involves firstly engaging with existing criticism on each genre and considering how previous definitions and identified conventions, meanings and representational strategies might be said to affect that particular genre’s representations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> trial. My second chapter examines representations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> trial in <b>the</b> social problem film, which I argue cleaves relatively closely to the representational model outlined in my introductory chapter. However, through close readings of two case studies, Dust Be My Destiny and Pinky, I also demonstrate the differences in how both films handle the didacticism and resolution that the trial form offers the social problem film, and identify competing voices in the text that complicate what could be viewed as a solely affirmative depiction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> court system. My third chapter examines representations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> trial in woman’s melodrama, employing as primary case studies Peyton Place and Madame X. My analyses of these films demonstrate how the female-centred melodrama can, to different degrees, challenge <b>the</b> patriarchal structures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> court by emphasising the female protagonist’s viewpoint. My final chapter looks at courtroom trial representations in film noir. I provide close readings of trial sequences in Stranger on the Third Floor and The Lady from Shanghai. Here I argue that noir’s use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> trial exemplifies <b>the</b> genre’s oft-situated difference from conventional forms in Hollywood cinema <b>of</b> <b>the</b> period. Noir trials consistently challenge notions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> adversarial trial system as the correct one for seeking justice...|$|R
2500|$|Guiteau became {{something}} of a media sensation during his entire trial for his bizarre behavior, which included him frequently cursing and insulting the judge, most of the witnesses, the prosecution, and even his defense team, as well as formatting his testimony in epic poems which he recited at length, and soliciting legal advice from random spectators in the audience via passed notes. He dictated an autobiography to the New York Herald, ending it with a personal ad for [...] "a nice Christian lady under 30 years of age".

2500|$|Fawell, under {{pressure}} from prosecutors, became a key witness against Ryan and Warner. He agreed to a plea deal that cut the prison time {{for himself and his}} fiancee, Andrea Coutretsis. Fawell was a controversial witness, not hiding his disdain for prosecutors from the witness stand. According to CBS Chicago political editor Mike Flannery, insiders claimed that Fawell had been [...] "much like a son" [...] to the former governor throughout their careers. At Ryan's trial, Fawell acknowledged that the prosecution had his [...] "head in a vise", and that he found his cooperation with the government against Ryan [...] "the most distasteful thing I've ever done". Nonetheless, he spent several days on the witness stand testifying against Ryan and Warner. Fawell, once a tough-talking political strategist, wept on the witness stand as he acknowledged that his motivation for testifying was to spare Coutretsis a long prison sentence for her role in the conspiracy. The jury was twice sent <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> so that Fawell could wipe tears from his eyes and regain his composure.|$|E

2500|$|Several months later, in February 1924, Judge Thayer {{asked one}} of the {{firearms}} experts for the prosecution, Capt. Charles Van Amburgh, to reinspect Sacco's Colt and determine its condition. With District Attorney Katzmann present, Van Amburgh took the gun from the clerk and started to take it apart. Van Amburgh quickly noticed that the barrel to Sacco's gun was brand new, being still covered in the manufacturer's protective rust preventative. Judge Thayer began private hearings to determine who had tampered with the evidence by switching the barrel on Sacco's gun. During three weeks of hearings, Albert Hamilton and Captain Van Amburgh squared off, challenging each other's authority. [...] Testimony suggested that Sacco's gun had been treated with little care, and frequently disassembled for inspection. [...] New defense attorney William Thompson insisted that no one on his side could have switched the barrels [...] "unless they wanted to run their necks into a noose." [...] Albert Hamilton swore he had only taken the gun apart while being watched by Judge Thayer. [...] Judge Thayer made no finding as to who had switched the [...]32 Colt barrels, but ordered the rusty barrel returned to Sacco's Colt. [...] After the hearing concluded, unannounced to Judge Thayer, Captain Van Amburgh took both Sacco's and Vanzetti's guns, along with the bullets and shells involved in the crime to his home where he kept them until a Boston Globe expose revealed the misappropriation in 1960. [...] Meanwhile, Van Amburgh bolstered his own credentials by writing an article on the case for True Detective Mysteries. [...] The 1935 article charged that prior to the discovery of the gun barrel switch, Albert Hamilton had tried to walk <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> with Sacco's gun but was stopped by Judge Thayer. [...] Although several historians of the case, including Francis Russell, have reported this story as factual, nowhere in transcripts of the private hearing on the gun barrel switch was this incident ever mentioned. [...] The same year the True Detective article was published, a study of ballistics in the case concluded, [...] "what might have been almost indubitable evidence was in fact rendered more than useless by the bungling of the experts." ...|$|E
