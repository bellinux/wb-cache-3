5|$|The mineral {{crocoite}} (lead chromate PbCrO4) {{was used}} as a yellow pigment shortly after its discovery. After a synthesis method became available starting from the more abundant chromite, chrome yellow was, together with cadmium yellow, one of the most used yellow pigments. The pigment does not photodegrade, but it tends to darken due to the formation of chromium(III) oxide. It has a strong color, and was used for school buses in the US and for Postal Service (for example Deutsche Post) in Europe. The use of chrome yellow declined due to environmental and safety concerns and was replaced by organic pigments or alternatives free from lead and chromium. Other pigments based on chromium are, for example, the bright red pigment chrome red, which is a basic lead chromate (PbCrO4·Pb(OH)2). A very important chromate pigment, which was used widely in metal primer formulations, was zinc chromate, now replaced by zinc phosphate. A wash primer was formulated to replace the dangerous practice of pretreating aluminium aircraft bodies with a phosphoric acid solution. This used zinc tetroxychromate dispersed in a solution <b>of</b> <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>butyral.</b> An 8% solution of phosphoric acid in solvent was added just before application. It was found that an easily oxidized alcohol was an essential ingredient. A thin layer of about 10–15µm was applied, which turned from yellow to dark green when it was cured. There is still a question as to the correct mechanism. Chrome green is a mixture of Prussian blue and chrome yellow, while the chrome oxide green is chromium(III) oxide.|$|E

50|$|This {{principle}} generalizes {{to other}} classes of material. Naturally brittle materials, such as glass, are {{not difficult to}} toughen effectively. Most such techniques involve one of two mechanisms: to deflect or absorb {{the tip of a}} propagating crack, or to create carefully controlled residual stresses so that cracks from certain predictable sources will be forced closed. The first principle is used in laminated glass where two sheets of glass are separated by an interlayer <b>of</b> <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>butyral,</b> which as a viscoelastic polymer absorbs the growing crack. The second method is used in toughened glass and pre-stressed concrete. A demonstration of glass toughening is provided by Prince Rupert's Drop. Brittle polymers can be toughened by using metal particles to initiate crazes when a sample is stressed, a good example being high-impact polystyrene or HIPS. The least brittle structural ceramics are silicon carbide (mainly by virtue of its high strength) and transformation-toughened zirconia.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe use {{of window}} glass in {{building}} design {{is becoming increasingly}} popular. Laminated glass has gained popularity as a suitable and practical alternative to monolithic and insulating glass in many design situations. Laminated glass plate performance is influenced by several factors such as glass thickness, glass type, temperature, aspect ratio, load duration, and hardness of the interlayer material. A new higher order finite element model (presented by the first two authors) using 9 -noded quadrilateral elements was applied to investigate laminated glass plates with both different interlayer materials.

Therefore, it is critical to study the damage to windshield glazing so as to promote the protection structure for pedestrians. In this paper, classical plate theory in combination with the Green strain and the von Karman assumption is used to develop constitutive relations to describe the large-deformation behaviour <b>of</b> composite <b>poly(vinyl</b> <b>butyral)</b> (PVB) windshield glazing. Previous test data are used to verify the constitutive relations model. A three-dimensional finite element model describing the impact between the head of a pedestrian and the windshield is constructed to investigate the mechanism underlying the damage to the windshield. Three main crack patterns of composite PVB glazing are proved to exist: a circumferential crack, a spider-web crack, and a plastic crack. Therefore, this paper studies the effect of different impact conditions and windshield structures on the damage to the windshield glazing and on the head injury. The results show that a high speed will cause not only a high initial impact speed but also the equivalent impact weight which can increase both the probability and extent of head injury.
