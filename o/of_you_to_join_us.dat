40|$|Thank you for {{inviting}} me to your beautiful country and to your remarkable project. It is such a pleasure to learn about other projects and to visit other lands. The extraordinary talent that exists within humanity always humbles me. I invite {{all of you to}} visit me in Vancouver Canada one day. I thought I would share a few slides of Vancouver so that you could see where I live. Vancouver is on the westcoast of Canada with the Pacific Ocean to the west and the Rockie Mountains to the north and east. We are a half hour drive from the US border and a 3 hour drive from Seattle Washington. I’ve lived in Vancouver for 15 years and in Canada all of my life. Before coming to the University of British Columbia, I lived & worked in Ontario but my strongest roots are in Alberta where I grew up on a dry land grain farm. Looking at the Canadian map, the province of Newfoundland is roughly the same size of Iceland. Canada and Iceland are similar in a couple of areas: 11 % of Iceland is covered by glacier while 12 % of Canada is covered by water (lakes, rivers, etc.). Iceland {{is one of the most}} geologically active areas on the Earth, as is the Pacific northwest of Canada. Vancouver is beautiful and invite all <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>us</b> for the 2010 winter Olympics. But I should return to the project that we are all focusing on today. Let me begin by summarizing what I think I have learned about your pedagogical project. Project KNOWHOW is a European Union funded Leonardo da Vinci project focused on the practices that take place within the ceramic studio environment. KNOWHOW asserts that studio education is a pedagogical model with creativity at its core. KNOWHOW is an extraordinarily ambitious project linking six partners across four countries and three lan...|$|E

Gore initially defended Clinton, whom he believed to be innocent, stating, [...] "He {{is the president of the}} country! He is my friend [...] I want <b>to</b> ask <b>you</b> now, every single one <b>of</b> <b>you,</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> me in supporting him."

In a field of great candidates, one candidate clearly now stands out, and so I'm asking all <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> in this grassroots movement to elect Howard Dean." [...] Gore's endorsement was highly coveted, and CNN reported that it [...] "could cement Dean's status as the leading Democratic candidate heading into the kickoff contests now just weeks away in Iowa and New Hampshire." ...|$|R

So you see I really do not want more than three <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>join.</b> I think four is the best number, and should be glad if only two besides Brown wished to go with me; {{but at the same}} time if more desire it, of course, as we are all comrades, they would have a right to go." ...|$|R

Clinton was not a part of Gore's campaign, a move also signaled by the choice of Joe Lieberman as a running mate, as Lieberman had been highly critical of Clinton's conduct.|$|R

40|$|Welcome to {{our summer}} 2011 {{edition of the}} ACM-W newsletter. In the last issue, we {{discussed}} how we {{wanted to create a}} newsletter that would appeal to people at every stage in their career — but we needed your help to do this. Thankfully, many <b>of</b> <b>you</b> wanted <b>to</b> <b>join</b> the conversation and add your voice to the newsletter. This is evidenced by ten terrific articles written by members of the community that span everything from high school to undergraduates to 1 st year of graduate school and to mid-career computer scientists. We urge our community to continue to add to the conversations we have started here. Please consider submitting an article proposal for our winter issue with new ideas and perspectives — or challenge some ideas presented here. In addition, in the next newsletter, we will have a special column — “Ask Judy ” where the 2011 ACM-W’s Athena Lecturer, Judy Olson, will answer questions from our community. Dr. Olson has over 40 years of experience in research and industry, thus she can answer any of those sticky questions we are not sure who to ask, but really need an answer for.

60|$|I beseech you, brethren beloved, {{let these}} {{following}} words (wrote in my love <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> and care over you, when our heavenly Father was removing {{me to the}} kingdom of his dear Son), be read in your church-gatherings together. I shall not now, dearly beloved, write unto you about that which is the first, and without which all other things are as nothing {{in the sight of}} God, viz., the keeping the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience; I shall not, I say, write of these things, though the greatest, having spent my labours among <b>you,</b> <b>to</b> root <b>you</b> and build you up in Christ through the grace you have received; and <b>to</b> press <b>you</b> <b>to</b> all manner <b>of</b> holiness in your conversations, that you may be found of the Lord, without spot, and blameless, at His coming. But the things I shall speak <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>of,</b> are about your CHURCH AFFAIRS, which I fear have been little considered by most of you; which things, if not mended aright, and submitted unto, according to the will of God, will by degrees bring you under divisions, distractions, and at last, to confusion of that gospel order and fellowship which now, through grace, you enjoy. Therefore, my brethren, in the first place, I would not have any <b>of</b> <b>you</b> ignorant <b>of</b> this, that every one <b>of</b> <b>you</b> are as much bound now to walk with the church in all love; and in the ordinances of Jesus Christ our Lord, as when I was present among you: neither have any <b>of</b> <b>you</b> liberty <b>to</b> <b>join</b> yourselves <b>to</b> any other society, because your pastor is removed from you; for <b>you</b> were not <b>joined</b> <b>to</b> the ministry, but to Christ, and the church; and this is and was the will of God in Christ to all the churches of the saints, read Acts 2:42; and compare it with Acts 1:14, 15. And I charge you before the Lord, as you will answer it at the coming of our Lord Jesus, that none <b>of</b> <b>you</b> be found guilty herein.|$|R

The scenes are old, the habits are the same We wore last year, before the Spaniards came[A]. Now, if you stay, the blood, that shall be shed From this poor play, be all upon your head. We neither promise you one dance, or show; Then plot, and language, they are wanting too: But you, kind wits, will those light faults excuse, Those are the common frailties of the muse; Which, who observes, he buys his place too dear; For 'tis your {{business}} to be cozened here. These wretched spies of wit must then confess, They take more pains to please themselves the less. Grant us such judges, Phoebus, we request, As still mistake themselves into a jest; Such easy judges, that our poet may Himself admire the fortune of his play; And, arrogantly, as his fellows do, Think he writes well, because he pleases you. This he conceives not hard to bring about, If all <b>of</b> <b>you</b> would <b>join</b> <b>to</b> help him out: Would each man take but what he understands, And leave the rest upon the poet's hands.|$|R
40|$|It is {{that time}} of year again: Time to trade in beach bags for backpacks and ride-all-day passes for student ids. Instead of seeing this as the end of summer though, I prefer to see it as the {{beginning}} of a great opportunity to learn and grow. Perhaps that is just so that I can bear buying pencils and preparing binders, but I think there is some truth to it. For all of the freshmen just getting started, this is your chance to build a strong foundation {{for the rest of your}} studies, and this is also time to enjoy Pitt. Many new friends and discoveries about your path in college await you. Oh, and appreciate those intro or general courses because trust me, it does not get any easier. For all of my fellow seniors, we must do our best to fend off senioritis so that we take advantage of this: our last chance to dodge the real world and focus on bettering ourselves. Also, take this time to enjoy the friends and memories you have made here. I know I will. Of course, I have not forgotten about the juniors and sophomores. For you, this is another chance to shine. Give your best effort this year because along the lines of what someone once told me, the contrary may be true, but I have never regretted doing my best. So, I guess this really is a chance for all of us … a chance to have a great semester. In addition to these thoughts, I would like <b>to</b> offer all <b>of</b> <b>you</b> an invitation <b>to</b> <b>join</b> us in the ACS student affiliate...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the things}} Dr. von Braun instinctively knew {{was that it was}} as nearly {{important}} to explain why we should go into space as to build the machines to take us there. He wrote books and magazine articles, spoke to everyone he could formally and informally, and spent his life to his dying day seeking to educate everyone on the importance of and need for spaceflight. Why should we go? I think there are actually two principle reasons: 1) Because the solar system is filled with cheap, clean energy, and we need to go get it, and, 2) this one may well be even more important, because we need a purpose for ourselves and our country. I think we need an eternal frontier to push up against, our purpose to conquer and settle it. The nice thing about doing that is the solar system is a very rich place, filled with not only mineral wealth but energy, a nearly inexhaustible supply. And if there s one thing this country and this planet desperately needs and is willing to pay for now and forever is energy. The solar system is where it is. We've got to go after it. I believe, then, that Americans have both a self-interest and a patriotic duty to convince ourselves it is time to take another giant step into space. The {{way to do that is}} to do what Dr. von Braun did, cut metal and start flying. Success engenders success. Dr. von Braun s grand dream need never die. NASA can spark a twenty-first-century revolution in transportation and energy that could fundamentally change the way we fly through space, power the world, even care for the sick if we do it right. All those things require cheap and clean energy. It exists in the solar system in a variety of forms. Solar energy is the most obvious form, but there are others, including helium- 3, which may be the perfect fuel for fusion reactors, and also just happens to cover the Moon. I believe we must go after it. We just need to believe in ourselves and our purpose. I call on all <b>of</b> <b>you</b> here today <b>to</b> <b>join</b> together, get things moving again, and get serious about conquering space. If we do, we'll assure the country s prosperity, and the world s survival, too, for centuries. Along the way, maybe we ll finally understand why my old preacher thought St. Peter s comment about looking for new heavens was so important. According to His promise, it s a big challenge, a huge responsibility, to try to fulfill such a promise and prophecy...|$|R
