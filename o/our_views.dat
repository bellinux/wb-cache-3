Individual scholars who were invited to talk to us in Cambridge in that period often felt, understandably, obliged to maintain a distinct opposition. While it is certainly the case that these presentations had occurred before <b>our</b> <b>views</b> had even begun to settle down, and that they were excessively aggressive, they {{played an important role in}} the process of enquiry and reformulation. In particular, the contrasts which were set up by us and by outside scholars allowed the views of the seminar group, and the differences of viewpoint within the group, to be clarified. The opposition highlighted our own opinion but also threw the spotlight on the blind alleys down which there was a danger of straying. Our aggression resulted from the conviction that we were doing something new. This, too, was important. In the initial period there was a clear idea of what was wrong with existing approaches and there was a faith that something else could be done.|$|E

500|$|Although fair {{criticism}} {{has been treated}} as a defence to scandalizing the court in some cases, the Court of Appeal preferred to view it as an element of liability, though it cautioned that [...] "the precise characterisation {{of the concept of}} fair criticism was not fully canvassed before us ... Accordingly, <b>our</b> <b>views</b> on this point must necessarily be taken, to that extent, to be provisional in nature." [...] The Court said that adopting this approach ensures that an alleged contemnor is not disadvantaged with regard to the burden of proof: [...] "If the concept of fair criticism relates to liability, then the evidential burden would be on the party relying on it. The legal burden, on the other hand, would be on the Respondent to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the impugned statement does not constitute fair criticism, and that it presents a real risk of undermining public confidence in the administration of justice. If, however, the concept of fair criticism constitutes a defence, then the legal burden would shift to the alleged contemnor to show on the balance of probabilities that the impugned statement amounts to fair criticism." ...|$|E

Not in the literal sense, but advertisements are reflective of what <b>our</b> <b>views</b> are. In turn, this may open up women who were unsure of their sexuality (even though most lesbians would state that they were lesbians from birth) and let them experiment without the boundaries. As an example, older advertisements from the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s are made up of ideologies of what men wanted, and what they believed to be their ultimate dreams. Those ads supposedly portrayed what women dreamed about, when really this was only because they were being told what to dream about by men. Women were just heterosexual in everyone's eyes, as being lesbian was a major taboo during that time. Lesbians were always in the background, just not front-and-centre. Nowadays, you have postfeminist women who want to be free from labels, experiment sexually, and use fashionable lesbianism in advertising as it does not affect their heterosexual ways. It has become a [...] "fad", or [...] "cool" [...] to be bi-curious, or tri-sexual. This, in turn, may open up other avenues for women who were once shunned upon. Sexuality and gender have been elevated to a privileged position in our cultural discourse, and thus powerful media campaigns only further this cause. It is natural that the [...] "hot lesbian" [...] would be at the forefront because sex always sells, and the [...] "hot lesbian" [...] theme in advertising is what is taking place now.

We hold the common sense view that they have equal status to 'normal' human beings, and a higher status than any non-human animal. We start with an admission, however: we don’t know how to give a fully satisfying theoretical account of the grounds of moral status that explains this view. And in fact, {{not only do we}} not know how to give such an account, but the most satisfying account of moral status that we know (which we call 'the standard account') entails that <b>our</b> <b>view</b> is false. It entails that those with PIDs have a lower status than ordinary human beings and an equal status to non-human animals. Now, in this paper, we do absolutely nothing to try to show where the standard account goes wrong, and we do absolutely nothing to resolve the difficulties we see in developing an alternative account that supports <b>our</b> <b>view.</b> Indeed, we do not give any argument against the standard account or in favour of <b>our</b> own <b>view.</b> Instead, we raise the following question: in order to be justified in continuing to hold <b>our</b> <b>view,</b> are we obliged to give such an account? Our answer will be that we are not. 	In section 1 we emphasise just how common <b>our</b> <b>view</b> is, and how deeply held it is, before outlining the difficulties surrounding giving a theoretical account that justifies it. After introducing the Moorean strategy in section 2, in section 3 we argue that despite these difficulties, {{and despite the fact that}} we do not know how to overcome them, it is not the case that we ought to abandon <b>our</b> <b>view.</b> The Moorean strategy we employ is drawn from a common interpretation of G.
