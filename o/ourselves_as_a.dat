25|$|Yeah sure, we see <b>ourselves</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> metal band, {{but without}} {{boundaries}} and limitations to our sound. We {{do not necessarily}} belong to a certain subgenre within metal. We're just playing dark and heavy music and keeping an open mind to evolve and being true to ourselves. I'm proud to say that I believe KATATONIA sounds like no other band. We have eloquently avoided the gothic metal genre most bands tend to fall in when changing their sound from doom/death metal to something more rocking and melodic. We're leaning towards more of a contemporary alternative sound, free of all cheese and clichés.|$|E

In most bands, the guitarist writes the music and the singer writes the lyrics. We tend to share things out more evenly." [...] He also criticised the attachment of an indie pop label to the band, saying [...] "We're seen as one of the indie bands. But we've always just tried to make pop music.

While the band members themselves had avoided appearing {{at the center of}} their music videos previously, the videos for [...] "Fall Together" [...] and [...] "Lost", both directed by acclaimed music video producer Kris Moyes and shot back-to-back on the island of Milos, Greece, feature them prominently. The band felt that they had become a mostly [...] "faceless" [...] band, and decided that starring in their music videos would help their identity and public image. Mandagi explained, [...] "we just felt a lot of time had passed between album two and this one, and obviously Lorenzo left, so there's been changes. Let's come back and fully solidify our identity as a band, present <b>ourselves</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> solid unit, show our faces."

2500|$|Powell {{wrote an}} article for The Times on 29 June, in which he said: [...] "The Falklands have brought {{to the surface of}} the British mind our latent {{perception}} of <b>ourselves</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> sea animal.... No assault on a landward possession would have evoked the same automatic defiance, tinged with a touch of that self sufficiency which belongs to all nations". The United States' response was [...] "very different but just as deep an instinctual reaction... the United States have an almost neurotic sense of vulnerability... its two coastlines, its two theatres, its two navies are separated by the entire length of the New World... she lives with... the nightmare of having one day to fight a decisive sea battle without the benefit of concentration, the perpetual spectre of naval 'war on two fronts'." [...] Powell added: [...] "The Panama Canal from 1914 onwards could never quite exorcise the spectre.... It was the position of the Falkland Islands in relation to that route which gave and gives them their significance—for the United States above all. The British people have become uneasily aware that their American allies would prefer the Falkland Islands to pass out of Britain's possession into hands which, if not wholly American, might be amenable to American control. In fact, the American struggle to wrest the islands from Britain has only commenced in earnest now that the fighting is over". Powell then said there was [...] "the Hispanic factor": [...] "If we could gather together all the anxieties for the future which in Britain cluster around race relations... and then attribute them, translated into Hispanic terms, to the Americans, we would have something of the phobias which haunt the United States and addressed itself to the aftermath of the Falklands campaign".|$|E

60|$|On {{the other}} hand, the Imperial families, no doubt, {{considered}} that in entertaining us {{they were more}} especially entertaining the people of America than they could by showering attentions on a whole platoon of ministers plenipotentiary and therefore they gave to the event its fullest significance, {{as an expression of}} good will and friendly feeling toward the entire country.
