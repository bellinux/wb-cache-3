25|$|Money value fluctuates over time: $100 {{today has}} a {{different}} value than $100 in five years. This is because one can invest $100 today in an interest-bearing bank account or any <b>other</b> <b>investment,</b> and that money will grow/shrink due to the rate of return. Also, if $100 today allows the purchase of an item, {{it is possible that}} $100 will not be enough to purchase the same item in five years, because of inflation (increase in purchase price).|$|E

The officials touched on various bilateral matters, including the security and educational sectors {{as well as the}} Houthi insurgency in Yemen. Additionally, Al Attiyah reaffirmed his administration's support for the Somali government's reconstruction efforts. He also indicated that the Qatari government would invest in Somalia given the nation's abundant natural resources and <b>other</b> <b>investment</b> opportunities. Omer in turn commended the Qatari leadership for its support of security and stabilization initiatives in Somalia.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{complexity}} for US persons US {{persons were}} already forbidden by the Securities Act of 1933 {{to make investments}} in US Securities at banks which are not certified inside the USA by the Securities and Exchange Commission. This disallows US persons from participating in any product which may contain US investment products. If a financial institution {{is not able to}} segregate non-US investments from <b>other</b> <b>investment</b> products, a bank may place a total ban upon US persons using their investment products. Since non-US institutions located outside the USA cannot acquire sufficient competence of US law, non-US institutions often find no exemption allowing resident US persons to purchase any financial products from their institution.|$|E

25|$|Documents under seal in {{a decade-long}} lawsuit {{concerning}} eToys.com's IPO but obtained by New York Times Wall Street Business columnist Joe Nocera alleged that IPOs managed by Goldman Sachs and <b>other</b> <b>investment</b> bankers involved asking for kickbacks from their institutional clients who made large profits flipping IPOs which Goldman had intentionally undervalued. Depositions {{in the lawsuit}} alleged that clients willingly complied with these demands because they understood it was {{necessary in order to}} participate in future hot issues. Reuters Wall Street correspondent Felix Salmon retracted his earlier, more conciliatory, statements on the subject and said he believed that the depositions show that companies going public and their initial consumer stockholders are both defrauded by this practice, which may be widespread throughout the IPO finance industry. The case is ongoing, and the allegations remain unproven.|$|E

The campaign was designed to raise sufficient funds, $85,000, to avoid pushing back the title from the planned mid-2015 release, and would be aided, if its goal is met, by personal loans and funding from the Indie Fund. The Kickstarter was successful, raising more than $100,000 from nearly 3,700 backers, and through it, several funders shared with the Greens their own photos and stories of their losses of their children at young ages due to incurable or inoperable maladies, which will be included within the game.|$|E

[...] When comparing multipliers across different projects, movie production incentive multipliers tend to be smaller than those for <b>other</b> <b>investment</b> projects (e.g. nuclear power plant, hotels). [...] Revenue from alternate taxes not covered under tax credit policies do not always cover the original cost of the given film tax incentives.|$|E
2500|$|Hedge {{funds are}} made {{available}} only to certain sophisticated or accredited investors and cannot be offered or sold to the general public. As such, they generally avoid direct regulatory oversight, bypass licensing requirements applicable to investment companies, and operate with greater flexibility than mutual funds and <b>other</b> <b>investment</b> funds. However, following the financial crisis of 2007–2008, [...] regulations were passed in the United States and Europe with intentions to increase government oversight of hedge funds and eliminate certain regulatory gaps.|$|E

[...] In {{the years since the}} laws passing, Goldman Sach and <b>other</b> <b>investment</b> banks (Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase) have branched out into ownership {{of a wide variety of}} enterprises including raw materials, such as food products, zinc, copper, tin, nickel and, aluminum.|$|E

[...] Typical career backgrounds vary, but, broadly speaking, venture capitalists come from either an operational or a finance background. [...] Venture capitalists with an operational background (operating partner) tend to be former founders or executives of companies similar to those which the partnership finances or will have served as management consultants. [...] Venture capitalists with finance backgrounds tend to have investment banking or other corporate finance experience.|$|E
2500|$|For an {{investor}} who already holds {{large quantities of}} equities and bonds, investment in hedge funds may provide diversification and reduce the overall portfolio risk. Managers of hedge funds use particular trading strategies and instruments with the specific aim of reducing market risks to produce risk-adjusted returns {{that are consistent with}} investors' desired level of risk. Hedge funds ideally produce returns relatively uncorrelated with market indices. While [...] "hedging" [...] can be a way of reducing the risk of an investment, hedge funds, like all <b>other</b> <b>investment</b> types, are not immune to risk. According to a report by the Hennessee Group, hedge funds were approximately one-third less volatile than the S 500 between 1993 and 2010.|$|E

2500|$|Hedge funds {{share many}} of the same types of risk as <b>other</b> <b>investment</b> classes, {{including}} liquidity risk and manager risk. Liquidity refers to the degree to which an asset can be bought and sold or converted to cash; similar to private equity funds, hedge funds employ a lock-up period during which an investor cannot remove money. Manager risk refers to those risks which arise from the management of funds. As well as specific risks such as style drift, which refers to a fund manager [...] "drifting" [...] away from an area of specific expertise, manager risk factors include valuation risk, capacity risk, concentration risk and leverage risk. Valuation risk refers to the concern that the net asset value of investments may be inaccurate; capacity risk can arise from placing too much money into one particular strategy, which may lead to fund performance deterioration; and concentration risk may arise if a fund has too much exposure to a particular investment, sector, trading strategy, or group of correlated funds. These risks may be managed through defined controls over conflict of interest, restrictions on allocation of funds, and set exposure limits for strategies.|$|E
2500|$|South Korea {{is one of}} the world's {{most highly}} {{developed}} countries and including it with developing countries like the BRICs is not deemed correct. However, commentators such as William Pesek from Bloomberg argue that Korea is [...] "Another 'BRIC' in Global Wall", suggesting that it stands out from the Next Eleven economies with its BRIC-like growth rate, despite its Human Development Index being higher than some of the world's most advanced economies, including France, UK, Austria, Denmark, Finland and Belgium. South Korean workers are the wealthiest among major Asian countries, with a higher income than Japan and the strongest growth rate in the OECD. More importantly, it has a significantly higher Growth Environment Score (Goldman Sachs' way of measuring the long-term sustainability of growth) than all of the BRICs or N-11s. According to the IMF, South Korea's GDP measured by purchasing power parity is already larger than Canada and Spain. In terms of GDP per capita (PPP), South Korea overtook Spain in 2010. According to Citibank, South Korea will continue by overtaking Germany, Britain, Australia and Sweden by 2020, surpassing Canada, Switzerland, Netherlands and Norway by 2030 and taking over the United States by 2040 to become the world's wealthiest major economy. While measuring the South Korean economy by nominal GDP is inaccurate as the South Korean won is artificially kept low to boost exports, IMF predicts South Korea's nominal GDP and GDP per capita will surpass Spain in 2015. Economists from <b>other</b> <b>investment</b> firms argue that even when measured by nominal GDP per capita, South Korea will achieve over $145,000 in 2040, surpassing the United States, suggesting that wealth is more important than size for bond investors, stating that Korea's credit rating will be rated AAA sooner than 2050.|$|E
