5|$|English Mayanist J. Eric S. Thompson cast strong doubts {{upon the}} {{authenticity}} of the Grolier Codex in his 1975 article The Grolier Codex, published in volume 27 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Contributions</b> of the University of California. Thompson argued that the codex was a modern forgery and that the unusual mix of styles in the document was not due to the mixing of cultures but rather due to the hand of a forger. Thompson queried the illustration of all four stations of Venus in the codex, noting that other Mesoamerican codices only illustrated the more spectacular appearance of Venus as morning star. This claim has been refuted more recently, with evidence presented from the Codex Telleriano-Remensis that the god of the morning star also presided over the evening star. The contents of the document have not been copied directly from any of the generally accepted Maya codices, although they do resemble pages 46 to 50 of the Dresden Codex.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> {{this work}} was to propose a {{correction}} for Exponential and Gaussian models due to <b>the</b> different percentages <b>of</b> explanation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>contribution.</b> <b>The</b> procedure consisted in determining <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> a correction called k, based on <b>the</b> percentage <b>of</b> explanation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>contribution</b> that one wants to reach. Correction k was calculated for 95 % and 99. 99 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>contribution,</b> showing {{that it is possible}} to obtain different mathematical expressions for Exponential and Gaussian models. In addition, generalized expressions for these two models were constructed. For better observation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> behavior <b>of</b> models for different values of k, a scenario of spatial dependence was simulated, and from this scenario, the Exponential and Gaussian models were fitted considering the range obtained at 95 % and 99. 99 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>contribution.</b> It was possible to perform the correction, and based on the results, a generalization of Exponential and Gaussian models was constructed. Furthermore, it was possible to visualize {{that it is possible to}} model different spatial dependences, since different percentages <b>of</b> explanation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>contribution</b> can be considered. However, it is noteworthy that <b>the</b> percentage <b>of</b> 99. 99 % <b>of</b> explanation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>contribution</b> is <b>the</b> closest to reality, showing that the correction with k = 9 is the ideal situation for a better approximation to <b>the</b> actual behavior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> phenomenon...|$|R

5|$|The library {{has been}} criticized for not {{including}} much information about the pardons Clinton issued just before leaving office. On January 20, 2001, his last day in office, Clinton pardoned former financier Marc Rich, a fugitive who had been charged with multiple counts of racketeering, wire fraud, income tax evasion, and illegal oil trading. Rich's wife, Denise Eisenberg Rich, was reported to have made three donations totaling nearly $1,000,000 to Clinton's presidential library fund, as well as multiple other contributions to the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton's senate campaign. It was later found that she only made three payments totaling $450,000 to the fundraiser. The Senate Judiciary Committee was investigating the pardon and issued subpoenas for Denise Rich's bank records because she refused to testify before the House Government Reform Committee, in accordance with her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White also launched a criminal investigation into whether the pardon had been a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>contributions.</b> It was later claimed that Rich had donated the funds months before asking for a pardon. Clinton maintained that the pardon had not been bought, but had been based instead on the legal merits of Marc Rich's appeal. During the 2008 U.S. presidential election, Barack Obama referenced the donations during his primary campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton.|$|E

In the 19th century, the free people of color established a relatively large class, especially in New Orleans. Many worked as highly skilled artisans; others became educated; they established businesses and acquired property. Of French and African ancestry, the base of Louisiana Creole people, they chiefly spoke French (developing a Creole French) and practiced Catholicism, while sometimes retaining ties to voodou and African practices.|$|E

An Anglo-Thai Peace Treaty was signed on 1 January 1946, and an Australian–Thai Peace Treaty on 3 April.

25|$|The rest of {{the costs}} of these {{highways}} are borne by general fund receipts, bond issues, designated property taxes, and other taxes. The federal contribution comes overwhelmingly from motor vehicle and fuel taxes (93.5percent in 2007), and it makes up about 60percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>contributions</b> by the states. However, any local government contributions are overwhelmingly from sources besides user fees. The portion of the user fees spent on highways themselves covers about 57percent of their costs, with about one-sixth of the user fees being sent to other programs, including the mass transit systems in large cities. Some large sections of Interstate Highways that were planned or constructed before 1956 are still operated as toll roads. Others have had their construction bonds paid off and they have become toll-free, such as in Connecticut (I‑95), Maryland (I‑95), Virginia (I‑95), and Kentucky (I‑65).|$|E
25|$|Georges Dumézil on {{the other}} hand {{proposed}} the theory of the irreducibility and interdependence of the three aspects (sovereignty, war, fertility) in goddesses that he interprets as an original, irreducible structure as hypothesised in his hypothesis of the trifunctional ideology of the Indoeuropeans. While Dumézil's refusal of seeing a Greek influence in Italic Junos looks difficult to maintain in the light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>contributions</b> of archaeology, his comparative analysis of the divine structure is supported by many scholars, as M. Renard and J. Poucet. His theory purports that while male gods incarnated one single function, there are female goddesses who make up a synthesis of the three functions, as a reflection of the ideal of woman's role in society. Even though such a deity has a peculiar affinity for one function, generally fertility, i. e. the third, she is nevertheless equally competent in each of the three.|$|E
