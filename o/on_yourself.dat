500|$|Throughout {{the early}} 1980s, Hill had {{remained}} a traditionalist, but after her 1986 trip to Europe, she started adopting many sport climbing techniques. For instance, she had resisted hang-dogging (hanging {{on the rope}} at any point during the climb), holding with the philosophy that it was cheating, but after experimenting with it during her ascent of Vandals, she found it a useful way to learn challenging climbs. During the mid-1980s, there was great tension in the climbing community between traditionalists and new sport climbers. There was even a [...] "Great Debate" [...] in 1986 at the American Alpine Club at which a panel of all-star participants—including Hill—were invited to discuss {{the merits of the}} two different styles, especially sport climbing that required the insertion of fixed bolts into the rock. Hill has argued that [...] "the purpose of climbing is to adapt yourself to the rock. You work <b>on</b> <b>yourself</b> to overcome the obstacle of the rock... I believe climbers should leave the rock as unaltered as possible... you have a responsibility not only to put in safe bolts but to put them in logical places—to do the least possible alteration of the rock to establish the best possible experience for others".|$|E
500|$|Rhimes also {{described}} the difficulty she faced in finding an appropriate love {{interest for the}} character of Alex Karev: [...] "We kept meeting with people and it wasn't until we met Elizabeth Reaser and sat down with her, and in two seconds in {{realized that she was}} absolutely the one we'd been looking for." [...] Reaser explained that when she was cast, there were no definite plans for the development of her character, and that only the intrigue of the ferry accident had been explained to her. She also deemed her character [...] "frustrated and scared". As for the make up process, Reaser stated: [...] "The prosthetic changes your outlook <b>on</b> <b>yourself.</b> It can be very disorienting. It's intense." [...] Beers, however, noted that the focus on Ava was mainly due to her inability to express her feelings through facial expressions, only communicating with her eyes and voice. Executive producer Rob Corn stated that his plan for the original arc was about Jane Doe's inner life, struggling {{to get out of the}} situation she is trapped in. He stated that the main characteristics they had been looking for in the actress for the part were strength and vulnerability. He also called Reaser's performance [...] "heart-wrenching and wonderful". Betsy Beers, the show's supervising executive producer, found Izzie to have been marked for life by Denny's death, which matured her [...] "in a very sobering way", but played a major role in making her feel more confident. She also noted the undeniable connection between Izzie and Alex Karev, whose desire to do honorable things has been compared with his [...] "cutting and sarcastic" [...] personality. After Izzie's continuous efforts to change Alex during their relationship in the previous season, Beers announced the possibility of a relationship between the two of them. She also contrasted the female leads on the show with women in film, explaining how the characters on television are shaped in unique ways.|$|E

As Safin was forced to miss the tournament in 2006 because of injury, 2007 was his first Australian Open since he {{captured}} the title in 2005. Safin lost against sixth seed Andy Roddick in his third-round match in a grueling 3-hour match. Roddick commented after the match, [...] "With Marat you know you are going to get an emotional roller-coaster. You just have to try and focus <b>on</b> <b>yourself</b> and I was able to do that tonight.|$|E

2500|$|While Garbage had lyrical {{input from}} all band members, Manson was {{responsible}} for all the lyrics in Version 2.0.. Consequently, it was described by Manson as [...] "more direct and more personal than the first. I was able to verbalize things a little clearer this time—I mean, I'm no Nick Cave, I'm never gonna be Bob Dylan. I do what I can to express myself." [...] The singer [...] "tried to let the darker undercurrents come through to offset some of the pop melodies", adding that [...] "like human beings, songs shouldn't be one-dimensional". The singer declared that the introspective nature of Version 2.0 served to [...] "reassure myself while I'm going crazy" [...] due to her experiences during production, as she was [...] "living by myself in a hotel, and I {{had no one to}} really talk to" [...] and every day coming back by herself really late after working on the studio. Manson added that only [...] "The Trick Is to Keep Breathing" [...] had something that was out of her life, being inspired by her friend Ruthie Trouble. [...] "Medication" [...] came about from a frightful, isolating experience with the US medical system. The song, Manson explained, is [...] "a reflection on past ills in a way ... about taking blame <b>on</b> <b>yourself</b> for things that you had no control of at the time, and finally pushing off and realizing that this was not my fault. It wasn't all my fault. There's a huge relief and release that comes from that".|$|E
2500|$|The {{success of}} [...] "He Stopped Loving Her Today" [...] led CBS Records to renew Jones' {{recording}} contract and sparked {{new interest in}} the singer. He {{was the subject of}} an hour-and-a-quarter-long HBO television special entitled George Jones: With a Little Help from His Friends, which saw him performing songs with Waylon Jennings, Elvis Costello, Tanya Tucker, and Tammy Wynette, among others. Jones continued drinking and using cocaine, appearing at various awards shows to accept honors for [...] "He Stopped Loving Her Today" [...] arguably inebriated, like when he performed [...] "I Was Country When Country Wasn't Cool" [...] with Barbara Mandrell at the 1981 Country Music Association Awards. [...] He was involved in several high-speed car chases with police, which were reported on the national news, and one arrest was filmed by a local TV crew; the video, which is widely available online, offers a glimpse into Jones' alter ego when drinking, as he argues with the police officer and lunges at the camera man. Conversely, when sober, Jones was known to be friendly and down to earth, even shy. [...] In a 1994 article on Jones, Nick Tosches remarked that when he first interviewed the singer in April 1976, [...] "One could readily believe the accounts by those who had known him for years: that he had not changed much at all and that he had been impervious to fame and fortune." [...] In an unusually unguarded self-appraisal in 1981, the singer told Mark Rose of The Village Voice, [...] "I don't show a lot of affection. [...] I have probably been a very unliked person among family, like somebody who was heartless. [...] I saved it all for the songs. [...] I didn't know you were supposed to show that love person to person. [...] I guess I always wanted to, but I didn't know how. [...] The only way I could would be {{to do it in a}} song." [...] Years later he commented to The Christian Broadcasting Network's Scott Ross about himself, [...] "I think you're mad at yourself, I think that you're sayin' to yourself 'You don't deserve this. [...] You don't deserve those fans. [...] You don't deserve makin' this money.' [...] And you're mad at yourself. [...] And you beat up <b>on</b> <b>yourself</b> by drinkin' and losing friends that won't put up with that...It's just one terrible big mess you make out of your life." [...] In 1982, Jones recorded the album A Taste of Yesterday's Wine with Merle Haggard; [...] while Jones, in the wake of his condition, appeared underweight on the album cover, his singing was flawless. [...] His run of hits also continued in the early 1980s, with the singer charting [...] "I'm Not Ready Yet", [...] "Same Ole Me" [...] (backed by the Oak Ridge Boys)", [...] "Still Doin' Time", [...] "Tennessee Whiskey", [...] "We Didn't See a Thing" [...] (a duet with Ray Charles), and [...] "I Always Get Lucky with You", which was Jones' last number one in 1984.|$|E
