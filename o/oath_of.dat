5|$|At his request, Ginsburg {{administered}} Vice President Al Gore's <b>oath</b> <b>of</b> {{office to}} a second term during the second presidential inauguration of Bill Clinton on January 20, 1997. She was the third woman to administer an inaugural <b>oath</b> <b>of</b> office. Ginsburg {{is believed to be}} the first Supreme Court justice to officiate a same sex-wedding, performing the August 31, 2013, ceremony of Kennedy Center President Michael Kaiser and John Roberts, a government economist. Earlier that summer, the Court had bolstered same-sex marriage rights in two separate cases. Ginsburg believed the issue being settled led same-sex couples to ask her to officiate as there was no longer the fear of compromising rulings on the issue.|$|E

5|$|Not all Texans favored secession initially, {{although}} many of the same would later support the Southern cause. Texas's most notable Unionist was the state Governor, Sam Houston.

6000|$|William {{was more}} {{troubled by the}} General Assembly, which refused to take <b>oaths</b> <b>of</b> {{allegiance}} {{to him and his}} wife, and actually appointed a date for an Assembly without his consent. When he gave it, it was on condition that the members should take the <b>oaths</b> <b>of</b> allegiance. They refused: it was the old deadlock, but William at the last moment withdrew from the imposition <b>of</b> <b>oaths</b> <b>of</b> allegiance--moved, it is said, by Mr Carstares, [...] "Cardinal Carstares," [...] who had been privy to the Rye House Plot. Under Queen Anne, however, the conscientious preachers were compelled to take the oaths like mere laymen.|$|R

5|$|The first {{display of}} the new queen's {{authority}} was the formal act of homage of the Lower Austrian Estates to her on 22November 1740. It was an elaborate public event which served as a formal recognition and legitimation of her accession. The <b>oath</b> <b>of</b> fealty to Maria Theresa was taken {{on the same day}} in the Hofburg.|$|E
5|$|The {{religious}} {{houses were}} dissolved in the Reformation, and their lands broken up. The Priory Church of St John remains, as does St John's Gate, traditionally {{regarded as the}} boundary between Smithfield and Clerkenwell. John Houghton (later canonized by Pope Paul VI as St John Houghton), Prior of Charterhouse, went to Thomas Cromwell accompanied by two other local priors seeking an <b>oath</b> <b>of</b> supremacy that would be acceptable to their communities. This resulted in their being flung into the Tower of London, and on 4 May 1535, they were taken to Tyburn and hanged — becoming the first Catholic martyrs of the Reformation. On 29 May, the remaining twenty monks and eighteen lay brothers were forced to swear the <b>oath</b> <b>of</b> allegiance; the ten who refused were taken to Newgate Prison and left to starve.|$|E

Apart from Fadl, Abu'l-Aswar had four more sons—Ashot, Iskandar, Manuchihr, and Marzuban—as well as an unnamed daughter, wife of the Shirvanshah Sallar.|$|E

5|$|After the war, Beauregard was {{reluctant}} to seek amnesty as a former Confederate officer by publicly swearing an <b>oath</b> <b>of</b> loyalty, but both Lee and Johnston counseled him to do so, which he did before the mayor of New Orleans on September 16, 1865. He {{was one of many}} Confederate officers issued a mass pardon by President Andrew Johnson on July 4, 1868. His final privilege as an American citizen, the right to run for public office, was restored when he petitioned the Congress for relief and the bill on his behalf was signed by President Grant on July 24, 1876.|$|E
5|$|Andrew and Frederick II, Duke of Austria, {{signed a}} peace treaty in late 1233. Andrew, who had been widowed, married the 23-year-old Beatrice D'Este on 14 May 1234, even though his sons were sharply opposed to his third marriage. John, Bishop of Bosnia, put Hungary under a new interdict {{in the first half}} of 1234, because Andrew had not {{dismissed}} his non-Christian officials despite his <b>oath</b> <b>of</b> Bereg. Andrew and Archbishop Robert of Esztergom protested against the bishop's act at the Holy See.|$|E
5|$|Around 1210, Theodore {{was invited}} by his {{half-brother}} Michael I Komnenos Doukas to Epirus, where Michael had founded an independent Greek principality. Michael wanted Theodore's aid, as his only son, the future Michael II Komnenos Doukas, was underage and illegitimate, while Michael's other half-brothers {{were considered to}} lack the ability to rule. Laskaris allowed Theodore to leave, but bound him with an <b>oath</b> <b>of</b> allegiance to himself and his heirs. Before going to Epirus, Theodore had married Maria Petraliphaina, {{with whom he had}} four children.|$|E
