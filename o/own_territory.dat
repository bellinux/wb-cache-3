5|$|Because Air Force {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Virginia Tech {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. Tech returned the kickoff to its 25-yard line, where the Hokie offense began the first drive {{of the second half}}. The Tech offense used rushes by Lee Suggs and passes by Bryan Randall to pick up several first downs and drive into Air Force territory. But once on the Falcons' side of the field, Tech proved unable to gain another first down and was even pushed back into its <b>own</b> <b>territory</b> by a penalty. Tech was forced to punt, and Air Force began its first offensive possession of the second half at its 20-yard line after a touchback.|$|E
5|$|Arkansas State got {{the ball}} to start the second half, and {{promptly}} drove down the field relying predominantly on Knighten, who threw six passes and attempted three rushes; ultimately, their drive stalled at the 2-yard line, and Davis kicked an 18-yard field goal to put the Red Wolves atop 13–10. Ball State subsequently faced a fourth down and one (4th and 1) situation, on which they attempted a fake punt – Schmidt was tackled by Brock Barnhill on the play and lost three yards on the rush, and the Cardinals had to relinquish the ball in their <b>own</b> <b>territory.</b> Arkansas State {{took advantage of the}} field position, converting another field goal attempt, this one from 29 yards, to give them a 6-point lead. Once again, Ball State turned the ball over on downs on their ensuing possession, this time doing so at the Arkansas State 32-yard line. This time, Arkansas State failed to take advantage, punting after achieving only one first down. At the end of the quarter, Ball State {{was in the midst of}} a possession around their 25-yard line.|$|E
5|$|As the Belgian forces, {{together}} with their French and British allies, were forced to retreat, Leopold decided that surrendering the army was the only viable course of action. On 24 May, as the government was leaving the country for exile in France, a group of ministers including Pierlot held a final meeting with Leopold at the Kasteel van Wijnendale. They called for him to {{follow the example of}} the Norwegian king, Haakon VII, and join them in exile as a symbol of continued resistance. Leopold refused, believing that as commander, he should surrender alongside his army, provoking real animosity. He also believed that, by leaving for France, the Belgian government would surrender its neutrality and become a puppet government. He also believed that, as a neutral power with no formal treaty of alliance with France or Britain, the Belgian army was not obliged to hold out as long as it possibly could if it incurred huge casualties and had no change of defending its <b>own</b> <b>territory.</b> On 28 May, after a brief attempt to form a new government of sympathetic politicians under Henri De Man and after denouncing Pierlot and his government, Leopold surrendered to the Germans and was made a prisoner of war.|$|E

5|$|Grand Theft Auto clones allow {{players to}} freely explore the game world, which is {{typically}} {{on the scale}} of an entire city. Some games base their level design on real world cities, such as London, New York City, and Los Angeles. Players are usually able to navigate by vehicle or on foot. Some games put greater emphasis on leaping, climbing, and even swimming. Exploring the world is not just necessary to complete objectives, but also to gain valuable items, weapons, and vehicles. Different parts of the game world may be controlled by different enemy factions, who will attempt to stop the player in a variety of ways. However, more recent games in this genre allow players to acquire their <b>own</b> <b>territory.</b> The freedom of navigating a huge game world may be overwhelming or confusing for new players. Game designers {{have come up with a}} variety of navigational aids to solve this problem. A mini-map feature is common, while Saints Row and Grand Theft Auto IV go so far as to offer a GPS service. Games without these navigation tools are sometimes criticized as confusing.|$|E

In the second issue, Lex Luthor discovers that Queen Industries is building a facility {{on the far side}} of Earth's moon as a base for the Justice League, and its construction is under John Jones' supervision. Despite having died after her encounter with Lex Luthor, the League's liaison is Tess Mercer, whose consciousness is revealed to be bonded to her half-brother's mind. Luthor sees this as an opportunity to learn the heroes' secrets before removing Tess from his mind, and creates measures to prevent them from finding out his situations with Tess. Despite his efforts, Tess still manage to send her message to the League of her predicaments with Lex, and they extract her consciousness from him and uploaded it to the Watchtower computer system as a temporary home for her mind.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for Operation Storm, the HV 4th Guards and 7th Guards Brigades were {{pulled back from}} positions facing the VRS that had been established during Operation Summer '95, and were reoriented south towards the Army of the Republic of Serb Krajina (ARSK). The ARSK was protecting the northern approaches to Knin − {{the capital of the}} unrecognised Republic of Serbian Krajina − which Croatia claimed as part of its <b>own</b> <b>territory.</b> As the two brigades turned over the positions north and west of Bosansko Grahovo to the HV 81st Guards Battalion, the HGZ was deployed {{to the rear of the}} battalion, tasked with intervening in case of any VRS attack towards Bosansko Grahovo. On the second day of the operation, 6 August, after Knin was captured by the HV, the HGZ was airlifted from the Livanjsko field to the village of Rovanjska north of Zadar. They then linked up with the 2nd Battalion of the 9th Guards Brigade and advanced east to capture the villages of Muškovac and Kaštel Žegarski. On 8 August, the HGZ participated in an operation against the last significant ARSK pocket in the area of Donji Lapac and Srb, alongside the three guards brigades and special police forces.|$|E

5|$|Many seabirds show {{remarkable}} site fidelity, {{returning to}} the same burrow, nest or site for many years, and they will defend that site from rivals with great vigour. This increases breeding success, provides a place for returning mates to reunite, and reduces the costs of prospecting for a new site. Young adults breeding {{for the first time}} usually return to their natal colony, and often nest close to where they hatched. This tendency, known as philopatry, is so strong that a study of Laysan albatrosses found that the average distance between hatching site and the site where a bird established its <b>own</b> <b>territory</b> was 22m; another study, this time on Cory's shearwaters nesting near Corsica, found that of nine out of 61 male chicks that returned to breed at their natal colony bred in the burrow they were raised in, and two actually bred with their own mother.|$|E
5|$|Maximilian {{attempted}} {{to resolve the}} dispute by bringing a military force to Poland, thereby starting the War of the Polish Succession. After a failed attempt to take Kraków in late 1587, successfully defended by Zamoyski, he retreated to gather more reinforcements but was pursued by the forces loyal to Sigismund. Zamoyski at first wanted to avoid a large battle, as he hoped for more reinforcements and supplies, but, when {{it became apparent that}} Maximilian would be reinforced first, he decided to press an attack. He also received the king's and royal permission to cross the borders and attack Maximilian in Silesia. Zamoyski divided his army into several regiments that were able to march quickly, at approximately 24 kilometers a day. He reformed his army after a week near Częstochowa. In the meantime, on 22 January 1588, Maximilian crossed the border into his <b>own</b> <b>territory,</b> towards Byczyna (Pitschen).|$|E
5|$|Royal {{power in}} Wales was {{unevenly}} applied, {{with the country}} divided between the marcher lords along the borders, royal territories in Pembrokeshire and the more independent native Welsh lords of North Wales. John took a close interest in Wales and knew the country well, visiting every year between 1204 and 1211 and marrying his illegitimate daughter, Joan, to the Welsh prince Llywelyn the Great. The king used the marcher lords and the native Welsh to increase his <b>own</b> <b>territory</b> and power, striking a sequence of increasingly precise deals backed by royal military power with the Welsh rulers. A major royal expedition to enforce these agreements occurred in 1211, after Llywelyn attempted to exploit the instability caused by the removal of William de Braose, through the Welsh uprising of 1211. John's invasion, striking into the Welsh heartlands, was a military success. Llywelyn came to terms that included an expansion of John's power across much of Wales, albeit only temporarily.|$|E

5|$|A {{victory against}} Los Angeles in the twelfth {{week of the}} season {{preserved}} Cleveland's undefeated record. The Dons began the scoring in the first quarter with a 75-yard drive engineered by quarterback Glenn Dobbs. The series ended with a short touchdown run by halfback Walt Clay. The Browns came back to tie the game in the second quarter after a 71-yard drive that features several completions from Graham to Lavelli. Lavelli caught a 49-yard pass from Graham for the score. On the next possession, Los Angeles converted a fourth down deep in their <b>own</b> <b>territory,</b> extending a long drive that ended with another touchdown by Clay. Cleveland again evened the score with under two minutes left in the first half on a touchdown pass to Edgar Jones. The Browns pulled away in the third quarter, when Graham ran a quarterback sneak for a touchdown. Groza later kicked a 36-yard field goal, and an interception by Cliff Lewis set up a run by Tony Adamle for a final touchdown. The final score was 31–14. Graham twisted his knee in the fourth quarter, and Edgar Jones, Parseghian and Bob Gaudio also had injuries.

5|$|Baugh invited some 100 {{players to}} the Titans' first {{training}} camp, which {{opened at the}} University of New Hampshire on July 9, 1960. As NFL teams cut players from their training camps, many were invited to the Titans' or other AFL training camps as the teams sought to fill their 35-man rosters. The franchise's first preseason game took place on August 6, 1960, against the Los Angeles Chargers at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The Titans kicked off to begin the game, and Chargers running back Paul Lowe returned the kick 105yards for a touchdown. New York lost, 27–7. On September 11, 1960, the opening regular season game was played in a heavy downpour, the remains of Hurricane Diana. Water poured off Coogan's Bluff, situated above the Polo Grounds, swamping the field, which had poor drainage. The Titans' offense was less affected by the mud {{than that of the}} visiting Buffalo Bills. The Titans won the game 27–3 before a crowd of 9,607 (5,727paid attendance). The following week New York played another home game, against the Boston Patriots. On the first of many occasions when the team would lose a game after taking a big lead, the Titans were ahead 24–7 in the second half. With the lead reduced to 24–21, the Titans punted from deep in their <b>own</b> <b>territory</b> with seconds left. The punter, Rick Sapienza, fumbled the snap, and the Patriots recovered in the end zone for the victory. The following week, with the Titans playing at the Denver Broncos, New York blocked a punt on the final play to win the game. In their fourth game, New York had a two-point lead when it fumbled with fifteen seconds left against the Dallas Texans. This set off a scramble for the ball, which the Titans recovered as time ran out. Viewers in New York were spared the harrowing ending; in a prelude to the Heidi Game eight years later, the local ABC station had switched to a Walt Disney Davey Crockett special at 6:30p.m. Many viewers called to complain.|$|E
5|$|With a Goodyear blimp overhead, Michigan got {{the ball}} to start the game, and on their first play from scrimmage, they lost three yards when DaQuan Jones made a tackle for a loss {{stopping}} Fitzgerald Toussaint; the loss decimated the drive, which ended in a three-and-out. Penn State's drive was no more successful – after one first down, Christian Hackenberg threw an interception. On Michigan's ensuing drive, however, they were set up on another third down and long, and Penn State's Jordan Lucas picked off Michigan quarterback Devin Gardner's pass, setting Penn State up in the red zone. Penn State capitalized, as Hackenberg threw a 12-yard touchdown pass to senior receiver Brandon Felder. Michigan struck right back, getting two first downs in the running game prior to Gardner throwing a 59-yard touchdown pass to Devin Funchess to tie the game. Penn State {{did not get a}} first down on their next drive and tried to convert fourth down deep in their <b>own</b> <b>territory,</b> but failed, setting Michigan up with excellent field position. Penn State's defense, however, responded, with Glenn Carson sacking Gardner to put Michigan out of field goal range, forcing a punt that Michigan downed around the five yard line. On Michigan's next drive, their kicker Brendan Gibbons made a 47-yard field goal. After Penn State again punted, Michigan embarked on a drive that included a third-and-long conversion, but ultimately ended when Gardner threw an interception to Penn State defensive end Anthony Zettel, who started over Deion Barnes. It took Penn State only one play to capitalize; Hackenberg threw a 20-yard touchdown pass to Jesse James to put Penn State back up 14–10. Penn State struck again later in the quarter, again via a touchdown pass from Hackenberg to Felder. Late in the first half, Penn State defensive end C. J. Olaniyan sacked Gardner for the second time, forcing a fumble, which Penn State recovered, but their drive stalled, and they punted. Penn State held a 21–10 advantage at halftime.|$|E
