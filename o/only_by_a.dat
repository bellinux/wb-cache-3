5|$|Because of {{its great}} depth, {{for a long}} time Davidson Seamount had been preceded <b>only</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> sparse few investigations. Davidson is {{interesting}} to volcanologists because of its unique geology, and to biologists for its unique ecology. In 2002 the NOAA sponsored the first modern in-depth study of the seamount. The team included scientists, educators, and resource managers, with the goal of documenting species, taking geologic samples, and describing the ocean environment. The expedition documented many rare, previously undiscovered species that exist nowhere else, not even on nearby seamounts, including ancient coral gardens that are vulnerable to human activity.|$|E
5|$|Cassini {{observations}} {{provided a}} much {{closer look at}} the crater distribution and size, showing that many of Enceladus' craters are heavily degraded through viscous relaxation and fracturing. Viscous relaxation allows gravity, over geologic time scales, to deform craters and other topographic features formed in water ice, reducing the amount of topography over time. The rate at which this occurs is dependent on the temperature of the ice: warmer ice is easier to deform than colder, stiffer ice. Viscously relaxed craters tend to have domed floors, or are recognized as craters <b>only</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> raised, circular rim. Dunyazad crater {{is a prime example of}} a viscously relaxed crater on Enceladus, with a prominent domed floor.|$|E
5|$|Computer {{architectures}} {{in which}} each element of main memory can be accessed with equal latency and bandwidth are known as uniform memory access (UMA) systems. Typically, {{that can be achieved}} <b>only</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> shared memory system, in which the memory is not physically distributed. A system that does not have this property is known as a non-uniform memory access (NUMA) architecture. Distributed memory systems have non-uniform memory access.|$|E

Hausa is the most widely spoken of the 3 main languages spoken in Nigeria itself (Igbo, Hausa and Yoruba) but unlike the Yorubas and Igbos, the Hausas tend not to travel far outside Nigeria itself.|$|E

5|$|In England, the seventh-century bishop Aldhelm was {{the most}} {{influential}} hermeneutic writer; Latin scholarship declined in the ninth century, and when it revived in the tenth, the hermeneutic style became increasingly influential. Unlike in continental Europe, where it was used <b>only</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> minority of writers, in tenth-century England it became nearly universal. It was the house style of the English Benedictine Reform, the most important intellectual movement in later Anglo-Saxon England. The style fell out of favour after the Norman Conquest, and the twelfth-century chronicler William of Malmesbury described it as disgusting and bombastic. Historians were equally dismissive until the late twentieth century, when scholars such as Michael Lapidge argued {{that it should be}} taken seriously as an important aspect of late Anglo-Saxon culture.|$|E

5|$|In mid-1937, Hearst {{was forced}} by {{bankruptcy}} to sign {{over all of}} his holdings {{to a group of}} trustees called the Conservation Committee. Wyntoon was included, it was estimated the prior year to be worth $300,000. Headed by New York Judge Clarence J. Shearn, the trustees slashed Hearst's costs and halted the smaller side projects at San Simeon and Wyntoon which had kept so many contractors busy. Wyntoon was maintained <b>only</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> skeleton staff paid for by the Hearst Corporation. Hearst never hosted more than 14 guests at Wyntoon after the bankruptcy. From 1938 to 1940, Hearst's art collections were cataloged and sold, including items from Wyntoon. Hearst was made to pay rent out of his allowance when he stayed at any of his properties.|$|E

5|$|She's Done it Again is a 1910 American silent short comedy {{written by}} Lloyd Lonergan and {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company in New Rochelle, New York.

The thief is caught <b>only</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> clever detective. The film was the third release of the Thanhouser company and featured the leading players, Anna Rosemond and Frank H. Crane. The film was met with positive reviews, but is presumed to be lost.|$|E

5|$|Some bathhouses have areas {{designed}} to facilitate impersonal sex. These areasrooms or hallwaysare illuminated <b>only</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> (dim) red exit sign.

Other bathhouses, such as the Continental Baths in New York or the Club Baths in Washington, D.C., have two or more bunkbeds in close proximity, in a public area. This provides a place to have sex for those who could afford only a locker, and facilitated exhibitionism and voyeurism for those so inclined. Baths often have a (porn) TV room or snack bar where patrons can recuperate between orgasms.|$|E
5|$|Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF), {{under the}} command of General Dwight D. Eisenhower, set their sights on the {{occupation}} of the Ruhr, Germany's industrial heartland. General George S. Patton's Third Army was given the task of occupying the French region of Lorraine, while General Courtney Hodges's First Army was ordered to break through the front near Aachen. Hodges had initially hoped to bypass the city itself, believing it to be held <b>only</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> small garrison, which would presumably surrender once isolated.|$|E
5|$|The Langenberg Quarry, where K. langenbergensis {{is known}} from, {{is part of}} the Lower Saxony Basin, which would {{have been part of the}} landmass {{associated}} with the Rhenisch, Bohemian, and London-Brabant Massifs. During the Kimmeridgian, it would have been a shallow marine environment; however, this does not imply that K. langenbergensis was marine, since the animals and plants of the Langenberg Quarry were probably transported allochthonously (albeit <b>only</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> short distance) from the surrounding islands. Brackish and freshwater sediments are also present in the quarry, which implies that there was occasional freshwater influx. Twigs and conifer cones indicate that the araucarian Brachyphyllum was present at the site.|$|E
