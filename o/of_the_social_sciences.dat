5|$|The {{philosophy}} {{of social science}} {{is the study of}} the logic and method <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>sciences,</b> such as sociology, anthropology, and political science. Philosophers of social science are concerned with the differences and similarities between the social and the natural sciences, causal relationships between social phenomena, the possible existence of social laws, and the ontological significance of structure and agency.|$|E
5|$|Queen's University has a {{joint venture}} with McGill University, {{operating}} an academic publishing house known as the McGill-Queen's University Press. It publishes original peer-reviewed and books in all areas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>sciences</b> and humanities. While the press's emphasis is on providing an outlet for Canadian authors and scholarship, the press also publishes authors throughout the world. The press has over 2,800 books in print. The publishing house was known as the McGill University Press in 1963 prior to it amalgamating with Queen's in 1969.|$|E
5|$|Weber's {{thinking}} was {{strongly influenced by}} German idealism and particularly by neo-Kantianism, {{to which he had}} been exposed through Heinrich Rickert, his professorial colleague at the University of Freiburg. Especially important to Weber's work is the neo-Kantian belief that reality is essentially chaotic and incomprehensible, with all rational order deriving from {{the way in which the}} human mind focuses its attention on certain aspects of reality and organises the resulting perceptions. Weber's opinions regarding the methodology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>sciences</b> show parallels with the work of contemporary neo-Kantian philosopher and pioneering sociologist Georg Simmel.|$|E

5|$|Never {{an ivory}} tower academic, Hirst held {{a number of}} {{influential}} appointments {{during the course of}} his career. He {{was a member of the}} Prime Minister's Republic Advisory Committee, the chair of the Commonwealth Civics Education Group, a member of the Film Australia Board, a council member of the National Museum of Australia, and a member of the board of Old Parliament House in Canberra. He wrote the official history of Australia for new citizens and took a prominent part in the history summit convened by Prime Minister John Howard in 2006. Hirst advised the Victorian Government on the school history curriculum and was history adviser to the National Curriculum Authority. He was elected to the Academy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Sciences</b> in Australia in 1986. A committed republican, Hirst was the Convenor of the Republican Movement in Victoria.|$|E
5|$|Philosophies of the {{particular}} sciences range from questions {{about the nature of}} time raised by Einstein's general relativity, to the implications of economics for public policy. A central theme is whether one scientific discipline can be reduced to the terms of another. That is, can chemistry be reduced to physics, or can sociology be reduced to individual psychology? The general questions of philosophy of science also arise with greater specificity in some particular sciences. For instance, the question of the validity of scientific reasoning is seen in a different guise in the foundations of statistics. The question of what counts as science and what should be excluded arises as a life-or-death matter in the philosophy of medicine. Additionally, the philosophies of biology, of psychology, and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>sciences</b> explore whether the scientific studies of human nature can achieve objectivity or are inevitably shaped by values and by social relations.|$|E
5|$|Durkheim's {{period in}} Germany {{resulted}} in the publication of numerous articles on German social science and philosophy; Durkheim was particularly impressed {{by the work of}} Wilhelm Wundt. Durkheim's articles gained recognition in France, and he received a teaching appointment in the University of Bordeaux in 1887, where he was to teach the university's first social science course. His official title was Chargé d'un Cours de Science Sociale et de Pédagogie and thus he taught both pedagogy and sociology (the latter had never been taught in France before). The appointment of the social scientist to the mostly humanistic faculty was an important sign of the change of times, and also the growing importance and recognition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>sciences.</b> From this position Durkheim helped reform the French school system and introduced the study of social science in its curriculum. However, his controversial beliefs that religion and morality could be explained in terms purely of social interaction earned him many critics.|$|E

25|$|In {{the social}} sciences, a {{perceived}} clinical bias exists in agoraphobia research. Branches <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>sciences,</b> especially geography, have increasingly {{become interested in}} what may {{be thought of as a}} spatial phenomenon. One such approach links the development of agoraphobia with modernity. Factors considered contributing to agoraphobia within modernity are the ubiquity of cars and urbanization. These have helped develop the expansion of public space, on one hand, and the contraction of private space on the other, thus creating in the minds of agoraphobic-prone people a tense, unbridgeable gulf between the two.|$|E
25|$|The Impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Sciences</b> team at London School of Economics {{found that}} professors {{in the social}} {{sciences}} had relatively low average h-indices during the initial stage of their professional development. The h-indices, based on Google Scholar data ranged from 2.8 (in law), through 3.4 (in political science), 3.7 (in sociology), 6.5 (in geography) and 7.6 (in economics). On average across the disciplines, a professor {{in the social sciences}} had an h-index about twice that of a lecturer or a senior lecturer, though the difference was the smallest in geography.|$|E
25|$|Rabinow {{has also}} devoted {{a great deal}} of energy to the {{invention}} of new venues, adjacent to the existing university structures, diagnosing the university’s disciplinary organization and career patterns as among the major impediment to 21st century thought. In {{view of the fact that}} the organization and practices <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>sciences</b> and humanities in the U.S. university system have changed little in recent decades, they are unlikely to facilitate the composition of contemporary equipment. Rabinow has called for the creation of venues that are adjacent to, but more flexible than, the university and the existing disciplinary structure. He has played leading roles in the design of two such organizations, the Anthropology of the Contemporary Research Collaboratory (ARC), and the Synthetic Biology Engineering Research Center (SynBERC).|$|E
