5|$|Around 2 {{million tonnes}} <b>of</b> <b>nickel</b> are {{produced}} annually worldwide. The Philippines, Indonesia, Russia, Canada and Australia are the world's largest producers <b>of</b> <b>nickel,</b> {{as reported by}} the US Geological Survey. The largest deposits <b>of</b> <b>nickel</b> in non-Russian Europe are located in Finland and Greece. Identified land-based resources averaging 1% nickel or greater contain at least 130 million tons <b>of</b> <b>nickel.</b> About 60% is in laterites and 40% is in sulfide deposits. In addition, extensive deep-sea resources <b>of</b> <b>nickel</b> are in manganese crusts and nodules covering large areas of the ocean floor, particularly in the Pacific Ocean.|$|E
5|$|Originally, {{the only}} source for nickel was the rare Kupfernickel. Beginning in 1824, nickel was {{obtained}} as a byproduct of cobalt blue production. The first large-scale smelting <b>of</b> <b>nickel</b> began in Norway in 1848 from nickel-rich pyrrhotite. The introduction <b>of</b> <b>nickel</b> in steel production in 1889 increased the demand for nickel, and the nickel deposits of New Caledonia, discovered in 1865, provided most of the world's supply between 1875 and 1915. The discovery of the large deposits in the Sudbury Basin, Canada in 1883, in Norilsk-Talnakh, Russia in 1920, and in the Merensky Reef, South Africa in 1924, made large-scale production <b>of</b> <b>nickel</b> possible.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{physical}} and chemical properties of cobalt and nickel are rather similar, the concentrations of isolated cobalt in diamond are much smaller than those <b>of</b> <b>nickel</b> (parts per billion range).

5000|$|An American adage, [...] "Don't {{take any}} wooden nickels" [...] is {{considered}} a lighthearted reminder to be cautious in one's dealings. This adage, too, precedes the use <b>of</b> wooden <b>nickels</b> as a replacement currency, suggesting that its origins lie not in the genuine monetary value <b>of</b> <b>nickels</b> but rather in their purely commemorative nature.|$|R

5|$|Dietary nickel {{may affect}} human health through infections by nickel-dependent bacteria, {{but it is}} also {{possible}} that nickel is an essential nutrient for bacteria residing in the large intestine, in effect functioning as a prebiotic. The U.S. Institute of Medicine has not confirmed that nickel is an essential nutrient for humans, so neither a Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) nor an Adequate Intake have been established. The Tolerable Upper Intake Level of dietary nickel is 1000µg/day as soluble nickel salts. Dietary intake is estimated at 70 to 100 µg/day, with less than 10% absorbed. What is absorbed is excreted in urine. Relatively large amounts <b>of</b> <b>nickel</b> – comparable to the estimated average ingestion above – leach into food cooked in stainless steel. For example, the amount <b>of</b> <b>nickel</b> leached after 10 cooking cycles into one serving of tomato sauce averages 88µg.|$|E
5|$|Identified {{land-based}} resources {{throughout the}} world averaging 1% nickel or greater comprise at least 130 million tons <b>of</b> <b>nickel</b> (about the double of known reserves). About 60% is in laterites and 40% in sulfide deposits.|$|E
5|$|Nickel is a {{naturally}} magnetostrictive material, meaning that, {{in the presence}} of a magnetic field, the material undergoes a small change in length. The magnetostriction <b>of</b> <b>nickel</b> is on the order of 50ppm and is negative, indicating that it contracts.|$|E

50|$|Most <b>of</b> the world's <b>nickel</b> {{reserves}} are in form <b>of</b> lateritic <b>nickel</b> ore deposits. Historically these {{were also the}} first source of commercially mined nickel.Developments in production technology favored nickel sulphide ores, so that currently most <b>of</b> the <b>nickel</b> which has ever been produced came from nickel sulphide ores.Recently more and more nickel sulphide deposits are being depleted, so new mines are again using nickel laterite.|$|R
50|$|The turn of {{the century}} saw {{unprecedented}} demand for nickels, due to a booming economy and the use <b>of</b> <b>nickels</b> in coin-operated machines. In 1900, Mint Director George E. Roberts called on Congress to grant the Mint a larger appropriation to purchase base metals, allowing for greater production <b>of</b> <b>nickels</b> and cents. The same year, the design was modified slightly, lengthening some of the leaves on the reverse. This change occurred with the introduction of a new hub, from which coining dies were made. Demand for the coins remained heavy; in March 1911, Mehl's Numismatic Monthly reported that the Mint was working twenty-four hours a day to produce cents and nickels, and even so was failing to satisfy demand.|$|R
5|$|Seeking {{alternatives}} to the difficult-to-work copper-nickel alloy, in June 1867 Longacre proposed that the five-cent piece be struck in aluminum. The new Mint director, Henry Linderman, objected to the proposal, stating that the price and supply of aluminum were as yet uncertain, and that the metal was too expensive to use in a minor coin. Numismatic historian Don Taxay, in his history of the United States Mint and its coins, noted that Linderman had proposed legislation increasing the proportion <b>of</b> <b>nickel</b> in the alloy to a third despite having earlier opposed the use <b>of</b> <b>nickel</b> in coins. Taxay suggested that Linderman was most likely influenced by Wharton and the metal's other advocates.|$|E
5|$|The main ores of cobalt are cobaltite, erythrite, glaucodot and skutterudite (see above), {{but most}} cobalt is {{obtained}} {{by reducing the}} cobalt by-products <b>of</b> <b>nickel</b> and copper mining and smelting.|$|E
5|$|The {{major source}} <b>of</b> <b>nickel</b> {{exposure}} is oral consumption, as nickel {{is essential to}} plants. Nickel is found naturally in both food and water, and may be increased by human pollution. For example, nickel-plated faucets may contaminate water and soil; mining and smelting may dump nickel into waste-water; nickel–steel alloy cookware and nickel-pigmented dishes may release nickel into food. The atmosphere may be polluted by nickel ore refining and fossil fuel combustion. Humans may absorb nickel directly from tobacco smoke and skin contact with jewelry, shampoos, detergents, and coins. A less-common form of chronic exposure is through hemodialysis as traces <b>of</b> <b>nickel</b> ions may be absorbed into the plasma from the chelating action of albumin.|$|E

5|$|Use <b>of</b> <b>nickel</b> (as {{a natural}} {{meteoric}} nickel–iron alloy) has been traced {{as far back}} as 3500 BCE. Nickel was first isolated and classified as a chemical element in 1751 by Axel Fredrik Cronstedt, who initially mistook the ore for a copper mineral, in the cobalt mines of Los, Hälsingland, Sweden. The element's name comes from a mischievous sprite of German miner mythology, Nickel (similar to Old Nick), that personified the fact that copper-nickel ores resisted refinement into copper. An economically important source <b>of</b> <b>nickel</b> is the iron ore limonite, which often contains 1–2% nickel. Nickel's other important ore minerals include garnierite, and pentlandite. Major production sites include the Sudbury region in Canada (which is thought to be of meteoric origin), New Caledonia in the Pacific, and Norilsk in Russia.|$|E
5|$|In 2016 a {{breakthrough}} in creating a strong light aluminium steel alloy which might be suitable in applications such as aircraft was announced by researchers at Pohang University of Science and Technology.

The result was a cheap strong light steel alloy—nearly as strong as titanium at 10% of the cost—which is slated for trial production at industrial scale by POSCO, a Korean steelmaker.|$|E
