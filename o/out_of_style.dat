5|$|A well-educated landowning aristocrat, Edwards {{deliberately}} cultivated {{the image}} of the natural leader. Thomas Ford writes that he continued to dress like an 18th-century gentleman long after such fashions had gone <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>style,</b> and that his public speaking was marked by showy eloquence. Edwards consciously positioned himself in the select class of men who dominated Kentucky and, later, Illinois politics. In 1803 in Russellville, Edwards married Elvira Lane, a relative from Maryland.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish {{probably}} obtained spotted horses through {{trade with}} southern Austria and Hungary, where the color pattern {{was known to}} exist. The Conquistadors and Spanish settlers then brought some vividly marked horses to the Americas when they first arrived in the early 16th century. One horse with snowflake patterning was listed with the 16 horses brought to Mexico by Cortez, and additional spotted horses were mentioned by Spanish writers by 1604. Others arrived {{in the western hemisphere}} when spotted horses went <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>style</b> in late 18th-century Europe, and were shipped to Mexico, California and Oregon.|$|E
5|$|The statehouse {{was built}} of blue limestone, two stories high. The {{governor}} and the Supreme Court occupied the lower floor, and the legislature occupied the upper floor, with each house in its own wing. The building {{was the site of}} many great events in its history, including a bier for Abraham Lincoln. The building was popular after its construction but by the 1860s Greek Revival architecture had fallen <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>style,</b> and the building was beginning to become decrepit. The building's limestone foundation began to fail, and many feared a general structural collapse of the building. In 1867 the ceiling in the chambers of the Indiana House of Representative collapsed. A debate was held in 1873 about how to preserve the building but no solution was found. By the time that Governor James Williams was elected to office, the building was about to be condemned. It was finally demolished in 1877.|$|E

5|$|The singers of {{the second}} era of the concerto delle donne were officially ladies-in-waiting of Duchess Margherita Gonzaga d'Este, but were hired {{primarily}} as singers. Peverara's musical abilities prompted the Duke to specifically ask his wife Margherita to bring Peverara from Mantua {{as part of her}} retinue. The new singers played instruments, including the lute, harp, and viol, but focused their energies on developing vocal virtuosity. This skill became highly prized in the mid-sixteenth century, beginning with basses like Brancaccio, {{but by the end of}} the century virtuosic bass singing went <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>style,</b> and higher voices came into vogue. The ladies' musical duties included performing with the duchess' balletto delle donne, a group of female dancers who frequently crossdressed. Despite their upper-class background, the singers would not have been welcomed into the court's inner circle had they not been such skilled performers. D'Arco belonged to the nobility, but a minor family only. Peverara was the daughter of a wealthy merchant, and Molza came from a prominent family of artists.|$|E
25|$|By 1981, {{short hair}} {{had made a}} {{comeback}} for men, {{in reaction to the}} shag and mod haircuts of the mid to late 70s. The sideburns of the 1960s and 1970s saw a massive decline in fashion, and many guys wore regular haircuts and quiffs. Beards went <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>style</b> due to their association with hippies, but moustaches remained common among blue collar men.|$|E
25|$|Almost {{no changes}} {{were made to the}} text, it was {{basically}} a remake of the 5th with very minor updates. All in all, the fourth, fifth, and sixth editions are virtually the same as each other. Rather than revising the main text of the encyclopedia with each edition, Constable chose to add all updates to the supplement. It's probable that the 6th edition only exists because of the need to remove the long s, which had gone <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>style,</b> from the font, which required the whole encyclopedia to be re-typeset.|$|E

25|$|With {{the advent}} of metal eyelets, tight lacing became possible. The {{position}} of the eyelets changed. They were situated across from one another at the back. The front was fastened with a metal busk in front. Corsets were mostly white. The corsets of the 1850s–1860s were shorter than the corsets of the 19th century through 1840s. This was because {{of a change in}} the silhouette of women's fashion. The 1850s and 1860s emphasized the hoopskirt. After the 1860s, when the hoop fell <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>style,</b> the corset became longer to mold the abdomen, exposed by the new lines of the princess or cuirass style.|$|E
25|$|The Gothic Revival period lasted {{longer and}} was more {{thoroughly}} embraced in Canada than in either Britain or the United States, only falling <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>style</b> in the 1930s. The late 19th and early 20th centuries {{was also the}} period when many major Canadian institutions were founded. Throughout Canada {{many of the most}} prominent religious, civic, and scholastic institutions are housed in Gothic Revival style buildings. In the 1960s and 1970s several scholars, most notably Alan Gowans, embraced Canadian Gothic Revival architecture as one of the nation's signature styles and {{as an integral part of}} Canadian nationalism. While largely abandoned in the modernist period, several postmodern architects have embraced Canada's neo-Gothic past.|$|E
500|$|Tap dancing lost {{popularity}} with audiences {{beginning in the}} late 1940s. A number of causes factored into this decline, among them the going <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>style</b> of vaudeville-style variety shows; a new tax that forced many ballrooms to close and thus closed venues to the big bands with whom tap dancers had used to perform; trends in music that favored smaller, more intimate groups of performers; and concomitant increases in interest among audiences in watching formal modern dance and ballet performances. Sims was quoted as having said of the period that [...] "ap didn't die ... It was just neglected." ...|$|E

50|$|Described as a {{historical}} comedy, The Imaginary 20th Century resembles a picaresque, the 16th century Spanish prototype of the modern novel whereby episodic narratives feature shysters and humble survivors in a nearly hopeless world.

500|$|Geisel {{submitted}} his finished manuscript, originally titled A Story No One Can Beat, {{to dozens}} of publishers {{during the winter of}} 1936–37. Publishers posited a variety of criticisms of the book, including that fantasy was not salable, that children's books written in verse were <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>style,</b> and that the book lacked a clear moral message. According to the Morgans, Geisel angrily exclaimed to his wife, [...] "What's wrong with kids having fun reading without being preached at?" [...] She cited the book's cartoon-like drawings and its story, which might be seen to encourage daydreaming and lying to one's parents, as possible reasons for its rejection.|$|E
500|$|Horowitz {{maintains}} that, {{while the}} standing of Tchaikovsky's music has fluctuated among critics, for the public, [...] "it never went <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>style,</b> and his most popular works have yielded iconic sound-bytes , {{such as the}} love theme from Romeo and Juliet." [...] Along with those tunes, Botstein adds, [...] "Tchaikovsky appealed to audiences outside of Russia with an immediacy and directness that were startling even for music, an art form often associated with emotion." [...] Tchaikovsky's melodies, stated with eloquence and matched by his inventive use of harmony and orchestration, have always ensured audience appeal. His popularity is considered secure, with his following in many countries, including Great Britain and the United States, second only to that of Beethoven. His music has also been used frequently in the realms of popular music and film.|$|E

5000|$|The {{original}} late 19th century Shaped-note Gospel Song {{founded the}} stylistic heritage and still lends {{its name to}} today's many different <b>styles</b> <b>of</b> Gospel music. In particular Traditional black gospel developed <b>out</b> <b>of</b> an <b>style</b> fusion between this ″white″ Gospel Song and the African American spiritual for example. Because of this modern understanding of the term Gospel in relation to music, the original Gospel songs today are often mistakenly referred to as hymns.|$|R

500|$|Shortly before Thomas' appointment, York Minster, {{the cathedral}} of the archdiocese, was damaged {{in a fire}} that swept through York on [...] 1069, and which also {{destroyed}} the refectory and dormitory for the canons. Soon after his consecration, Thomas had a new dormitory and refectory built and a new roof put on the cathedral; these {{appear to have been}} temporary measures however, as some time later, probably in about 1075, he ordered {{the construction of a new}} cathedral on a different site. The new building, much larger than the one it replaced, has not survived. It was excavated between 1966 and 1973, showing the plan of the cathedral to be different from most others built in England around that time. It was longer, had no aisles in the nave, and it had a rectangular ring crypt that had been long <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>style</b> in 1075. Because of the way the foundations were laid out, it appears likely that the entire building was planned and built in one design phase, with few modifications. It may have been that Thomas designed his cathedral to be as unlike Canterbury Cathedral as possible, perhaps because of the conflict between York and Canterbury over primacy. William of Malmesbury, a 12th-century writer, states that Thomas finished the cathedral, and this is corroborated by the fact that Thomas was buried in the minster in 1100. Some elements of Thomas' structure are still visible in the crypt of York Minster.|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé {{said that}} Dangerously in Love is lyrically similar to Destiny's Child's albums. But because she {{only had to}} write for herself, Beyoncé {{had the chance to}} compose {{personally}} deeper songs than her previous records with the group. With a theme that is based upon different stages of a romantic relationship, Dangerously in Love contains songs that speak of love and honesty. In addition, Beyoncé admitted that there are songs about love-making. The personal content of the album, however, was not generally attributed to Beyoncé's own experiences—although some were based from hers—instead, the theme kept recurring in her mind. Beyoncé later explained: [...] "I wanted to have an album that everyone could relate to and would listen to as long as I'm alive and even after... Love is something that never goes <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>style.</b> It's something everybody experiences, and if they are not in love, people usually want to feel that..." [...] While some songs merely focus on the [...] "beauty of love", the album also explores another side of love, with songs that [...] "celebrate breakup" [...] and songs that narrate a woman's desire to have a degree of control in a relationship. The album's hidden track, [...] "Daddy", is a tribute to Beyoncé's father, Mathew Knowles, who fronted Destiny's Child as their manager. The song is an account of Beyoncé wanting her future husband and child to possess qualities similar to her father's. Originally, Beyoncé did not intend to include the track in the album, having thought its lyrics would make her appear immature. However, considering it one of the songs that reflected her life at that transitional moment, she instead relegated [...] "Daddy" [...] as the closing track.|$|E
500|$|The film {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} in trade publications. The Moving Picture World remarked that the play itself was not well-known, {{but that the}} plot was depicted adequately enough that it may encourage a re-perusal of the play. There was no fault found by the reviewer who stated, [...] "The characters of Hardcastle, Kate and Marlow are admirably done and seem to correctly interpret the original. The staging and costuming are {{in harmony with the}} play and reproduce the scenery of the time depicted with accuracy. The usefulness of a work of this sort does not end with the presentation of the play itself. There is an educational value which includes the costuming and reproduction of the surroundings of the time. These are so unfamiliar now that they afford not a little addition to the interest and pleasure of such a film. The work has been done so well that the company deserves commendation for undertaking the task. It is not an easy manner to reproduce a play of this character, and when it is well done the company performing it deserves praise." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror disagreed on almost all points, [...] "In numerous details the illusion is dispelled, for the scenery is manifestly not of the eighteenth century. No contemporary of Goldsmith ever rode in such a barouche as appears in this film, nor lived in such a house as Mr. Hardcastle. The final tableau is as artificial as set pieces which have gone <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>style</b> at funerals. With all of its imperfections there is considerable of virile comedy in the film." [...] Though the Mirror reviewer stated that despite the elimination of the Hastings and Constance Neville subplot, the acting is clear enough that audiences do not need prior knowledge of the play to appreciate the film.|$|E
