Not only the benefits and advantages for the employer are enumerated, but also the special challenges and problems that may arise. Particularly {{with regard to the}} prohibition of previous employment. This thesis presents the interests fo employers and companies. The central research question is: What are the possibilities of limitation and there is the prohibition of previous employment unconstitutional? A special attention is given to the contractual formulation examples of limited contracts. It deals exclusively with applicable German and European law. A comparison with previous case-law does not take place in this master thesis...|$|R
40|$|The {{central issue}} {{regarding}} non-regular employees is {{the disparity in}} compensation compared to regular employees. There are three policy choices to resolve this issue: (1) the basic principle of same compensation for same career, (2) the basic principle of same compensation for same work, and (3) the basic principle of prohibiting discriminatory treatment without an <b>objective</b> <b>reason.</b> Of these choices, article 8 of the Part-time Labor Act adopts (1) the basic principle of same compensation for same career, and the Democratic Party of Japan's manifesto (2009) extols the basic principle of same pay for same work (one form of (2) the basic principle of same compensation for same work). A general legal principle based on a particular form (same career or same work) is not applicable to other types of employment systems and creates the problem {{of not being able}} to address the various benefits not directly connected to career or work duties, such as commuting allowance, in-house cafeterias, and health examinations. While France and Germany have adopted (2) the general legal principle of same compensation for same work, their systems, in fact, operate in line with (3) the basic principle of prohibiting discriminatory treatment without an <b>objective</b> <b>reason</b> in order to resolve the issue. With an assumption of diverse and broad benefits for employees and diversified and multi-track human resource systems (wage systems), Japan has also adopted (3) the basic principle of prohibiting discriminatory treatment without an objective reason; responses that incorporate diversity of particular situations for determining <b>objective</b> <b>reason</b> are likely appropriate in terms of theory and practice. In this paper, I clarify in concrete terms the details and nature of this principle (in particular, guidelines for interpreting <b>objective</b> <b>reason</b> and the concrete framework for decisions) while looking at various aspects such as the debate in France and Germany and show how to respond to problems in implementing this principle (low predictability). ...|$|R

25|$|Article 9's {{prohibition}} of arbitrary treatment, {{an extension of}} the rule of law, guards individuals against rules or decisions of the state that have no serious, <b>objective</b> <b>reasons,</b> or that are meaning- and pointless. A decision is arbitrary only if its result is obviously untenable or contrary to the facts, or if it blatantly violates the law or the idea of justice. This rule, which is illimitable, permeates the entire legal system. Applied subsidiarily where other rights are unavailable, it features prominently in Supreme Court jurisprudence, which reviews questions of cantonal law that do not involve rules of federal or constitutional law not de novo, but only for arbitrary application of the law. However, the Court applies a narrow rule of standing to independent claims of arbitrary treatment, which has caused wide scholarly criticism. The rule of good faith requires the state to protect people's vested confidence in state actions, such as in governmental informations, and prohibits the abuse of rights by the state, such as through undue delays.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Yellow-tinted, low plus {{eyeglasses}} {{have been}} advertised as {{a cure for}} computer vision syndrome. In {{the first of two}} studies, the claims of one brand of “digital performance eyewear” areevaluated. Methods: A crossover study of 36 subjects was conducted to examine the difference between low plus (+ 0. 50 D) yellow-tinted computer spectacles and placebo lenses. The two pairs of eyeglasses were in similar frames, and both sets of lenses were made of similar resin with antireflective coating, but the placebo lenses were made without optical power or tint. Measurements of dynamic accommodation and pupil size at 5 Hz, along with subjective symptoms experienced with each type of glasses, were made. Results: Wilcoxon matched pair testing revealed {{a significant difference in the}} symptom of irritation or burning of the eyes. Pupil size was significantly different (p= 0. 001), but differences in the accommodative responses to the two lens types were not significant (p= 0. 56). Conclusions: While some participant symptoms were reduced when using the yellow-tinted, low-plus eyeglasses that we studied, no <b>objective</b> <b>reason</b> was found when accommodation and pupil size were monitored five times per second. A follow-up study that will test tear film, blink rate, and quantified squinting is indicated to discover an <b>objective</b> <b>reason</b> for this preference...|$|R

50|$|The {{discovery}} of Kierkegaard prompted Shestov to realise that his philosophy shared great similarities, {{such as his}} rejection of idealism, and his belief that man can gain ultimate knowledge through ungrounded subjective thought rather than <b>objective</b> <b>reason</b> and verifiability. However, Shestov maintained that Kierkegaard did not pursue this line of thought far enough, and proceeded to continue where he thought the Dane left off. The results of this tendency are seen in his work Kierkegaard and Existential Philosophy: Vox Clamantis in Deserto, published in 1936, a fundamental work of Christian existentialism.|$|R
