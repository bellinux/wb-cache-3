30|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{vibration}} of <b>washing</b> <b>machines</b> is a challenging issue to be considered. The vibration of the <b>washing</b> <b>machine</b> is mainly due to the unbalanced mass of clothes distributed in the washing drum. This occurs most frequently in the spin-drying stage, because the drum spins at a relatively high speed causing the clothes to be pressed against the inner wall of the spin drum, and these can become a large unbalanced mass {{until the end of the}} stage. Particularly, in a front-loaded <b>washing</b> <b>machine</b> (drum-type <b>washing</b> <b>machine),</b> the unbalanced mass of clothes easily occurs and very severe due to the effect of gravity. The vibration of the <b>washing</b> <b>machine</b> is transferred to the floor causing noises, unpleasant feeling for humans, and failure of the machine.|$|R

40|$|The {{manufacturing}} of <b>washing</b> <b>machines</b> {{has lately}} {{been an important}} issue for the appliance industry. Current environmental awareness demands the improvement of machine efficiency and increasing of quality of washing processes. Developing of high efficient and high speed spinning <b>washing</b> <b>machines</b> raises the problem of designing smart suspension systems to control vibration and noise in real time. In the paper a horizontal-axis <b>washing</b> <b>machine</b> is under the study. The machine has a drum with perforated walls. In the water extraction process, the drum starts rotation and this gives rise to significant centrifugal imbalance forces and imbalanced rotation of the laundry mass. This results in vibration and shaking. By elimination of such vibrations {{it will be possible}} to design more silent <b>washing</b> <b>machines</b> for higher <b>wash</b> loads within the same outside dimensions. In the paper the results of modelling of dynamics of <b>washing</b> <b>machine</b> and designing of smart suspension system comprising magnetoreological dampers for semi-active vibration control are presented. The commercial software MSC. ADAMS/View and MATLAB/Simulink have been used for 3 D-modelling of dynamics of <b>washing</b> <b>machine.</b> Both traditional suspension with passive dampers and suspension with magnetoreological dampers are implemented into the developing mathematical models. Identification of passive dampers and magnetoreological dampers dynamics was done based on experimental study. Full scale test rig of <b>washing</b> <b>machine</b> was used for validating the models. The validated model has been used for designing and optimization of smart suspension system with magnetoreological dampers of high speed spinning <b>washing</b> <b>machines.</b> Analysis of the obtained results has proved a big potential of utilization of magnetoreological dampers for developing of semi-active suspension systems for <b>washing</b> <b>machines...</b>|$|R

40|$|A <b>washing</b> <b>machine</b> as {{a product}} is {{familiar}} to almost everyone in all developed countries. This thesis deals with the dynamics of modern <b>washing</b> <b>machines</b> of household type. From technical and scientific point of view a modern <b>washing</b> <b>machine</b> {{is an example of}} electromechanical system with many degrees of freedom, sensors and controller making the machine a mechatronic system. The aim with the work presented in this thesis is to develop mathematical and computational models of a <b>washing</b> <b>machine</b> of modern type to be used in system dynamics analysis and in optimization routines to make improvements in the machine suspension structure. This should be done by changing geometry, changing the passive component parameters or/and incorporate active or semi-active mechanical actuators. The aim is also to evaluate existing and to find new suspension concepts and corresponding control strategies (if applicable) to reduce the vibration output of a <b>washing</b> <b>machine</b> to its surroundings whilst keeping or increasing load capacity. From this point of view experimental validation of the developed models and proposed concepts is one of the important tasks of the project. In the thesis a MBS model of a commercial front loaded <b>washing</b> <b>machine</b> implemented in MSC. Software/Adams is presented and used for analysis of the vibration dynamics. Several test rigs for component and whole-system tests have been developed and are presented. The experimental data obtained are used for validation of developed mathematical and computational models. A methodology for optimization of <b>washing</b> <b>machine</b> vibration dynamics is presented together with results of a structural optimization of some features of a future suspension system. The existence and possibility of utilization of semi-active control for the current suspension system are investigated. A suggested solution has been validated by incorporation into a <b>washing</b> <b>machine</b> suspension system a magnetorheological damper.

The complete model of a <b>washing</b> <b>machine</b> is implemented in the commercial MBS environment Adams/View from MSC. Software. An undesirable impact of <b>washing</b> <b>machine</b> operation on the surroundings is vibration and noise.

The aim of this thesis is to develop mathematical and computational models of a <b>washing</b> <b>machine</b> of modern type and use these models for dynamics analysis and in optimization routines to make improvements of the machine mechanical design. In the thesis a multibody system model of a commercial front loaded <b>washing</b> <b>machine</b> is presented and used for analysis of the vibration dynamics and system design optimization. The model has been built using a theoretical-experimental methodology consisting of integration of multibody system (MBS) formalism, detailed modeling of machine functional components and experimental data based validation. The complete model of a <b>washing</b> <b>machine</b> is implemented in the commercial MBS environment Adams/View from MSC. Software. Several test rigs for experiments on components and the complete <b>washing</b> <b>machine</b> have been developed. Validation of the developed computational models has shown acceptable agreement both with tub kinematics as well as forces transmitted to the hosting structure. In this thesis the vibrations of a <b>washing</b> <b>machine</b> have been channeled into kinematic, dynamic and stability cost functions. The defined kinematic cost function deals with the tub motion and can be used to ensure margins to collision between parts inside the machine or constitute a step in the process if increasing the system capacity. The dynamic cost function measures transmitted vertical forces to the hosting structure, forces which are found cause the most noise and vibration impact on the surroundings. A cost function based on the necessary and sufficient criterion for stability of a <b>washing</b> <b>machine</b> in the sense of walking avoidance is also presented. The introduced cost functions are used for multiobjective optimization of <b>washing</b> <b>machines,</b> and several problems have been formulated and solved by changing suspension geometry and component parameters. To solve multiobjective optimization problems of a <b>washing</b> <b>machine</b> on a set of spinning operational scenarios a multistep approach has been proposed. The approach reduces the number of variables in the considered generic complex multiobjective constrained optimization problem of a <b>washing</b> <b>machine</b> and makes use of engineering knowledge and other requirements on the system, e. g. such as esthetics. The utilization of several vibration control technologies for <b>washing</b> <b>machines,</b> such as a semi-active suspension system, automatic balancing, etc are also investigated.
