40|$|Geodesic active contour (GAC) {{model is}} a common used method for image segmentation. But one {{drawback}} of this model is that it's difficult to control the number of iterations and sometimes may produce over-segmentation results. In this paper, the generalized GVF in the normal direction (GNGVF) is proposed, and an improved GAC model which combines GAC with GNGVF is proposed. When {{the distance between the}} evolution curves produced by successive iterations is smaller than some given threshold, the <b>on-off</b> <b>function</b> will change and different force will affect. The new force can extend the capture range and stop the curve at the boundary stably avoiding over-segmentation. The experimental results show the curve can converge to boundary well...|$|E
40|$|In {{an effort}} to {{increase}} the U. S. energy reserves and lower costs for finding and retrieving oil, the USDOE created a solicitation to encourage industry to focus on means to operate in small diameter well-Microhole. Partially {{in response to this}} solicitation and because Western Well Tool's (WWT) corporate objective to develop small diameter coiled tubing drilling tractor, WWT responded to and was awarded a contract to design, prototype, shop test, and field demonstrate a Microhole Drilling Tractor (MDT). The benefit to the oil industry and the US consumer from the project is that with the MDT's ability to facilitate Coiled Tubing drilled wells to be 1000 - 3000 feet longer horizontally, US brown fields can be more efficiently exploited resulting in fewer wells, less environmental impact, greater and faster oil recovery, and lower drilling costs. Shortly after award of the contract, WWT was approached by a major oil company that strongly indicated that the specified size of a tractor of 3. 0 inches diameter was inappropriate and that immediate applications for a 3. 38 -inch diameter tractor would substantially increase the usefulness of the tool to the oil industry. Based on this along with an understanding with the oil company to use the tractor in multiple field applications, WWT applied for and was granted a no-cost change-of-scope contract amendment to design, manufacture, assemble, shop test and field demonstrate a prototype a 3. 38 inch diameter MDT. Utilizing existing WWT tractor technology and conforming to an industry developed specification for the tool, the Microhole Drilling Tractor was designed. Specific features of the MDT that increase it usefulness are: (1) Operation on differential pressure of the drilling fluid, (2) On-Off Capability, (3) Patented unique gripping elements (4) High strength and flexibility, (5) Compatibility to existing Coiled Tubing drilling equipment and operations. The ability to power the MDT with drilling fluid results in a highly efficient tool that both delivers high level of force for the pressure available and inherently increases downhole reliability because parts are less subject to contamination. The On-Off feature is essential to drilling to allow the Driller to turn off the tractor and pull back while circulating in cleanout runs that keep the hole clean of drilling debris. The gripping elements have wide contact surfaces to the formation to allow high loads without damage to the formation. As part of the development materials evaluations were conducted to verify compatibility with anticipated drilling and well bore fluids. Experiments demonstrated that the materials of the tractor are essentially undamaged by exposure to typical drilling fluids used for horizontal coiled tubing drilling. The design for the MDT was completed, qualified vendors identified, parts procured, received, inspected, and a prototype was assembled. As part of the assembly process, WWT prepared Manufacturing instructions (MI) that detail the assembly process and identify quality assurance inspection points. Subsequent to assembly, functional tests were performed. Functional tests consisted of placing the MDT on jack stands, connecting a high pressure source to the tractor, and verifying On-Off functions, walking motion, and operation over a range of pressures. Next, the Shop Demonstration Test was performed. An existing WWT test fixture was modified to accommodate operation of the 3. 38 inch diameter MDT. The fixture simulated the tension applied to a tractor while walking (pulling) inside 4. 0 inch diameter pipe. The MDT demonstrated: (1) <b>On-off</b> <b>function,</b> (2) Pulling forces proportional to available differential pressure up to 4000 lbs, (3) Walking speeds to 1100 ft/hour. A field Demonstration of the MDT was arranged with a major oil company operating in Alaska. A demonstration well with a Measured Depth of approximately 15, 000 ft was selected; however because of problems with the well drilling was stopped before the planned MDT usage. Alternatively, functional and operational tests were run with the MDT inside 4. 5 inch tubing at depths of 800 - 950 ft. The MDT successfully demonstrated On-Off capability, pulled with up to 1465 lbs force, and verified its capability to transmit torque though it from the Orienter. Forces generated by the tractor were limited due to insufficient differential pressure because of the unloaded downhole motor, which is not typical during drilling conditions. Additionally, the Coefficient of Friction between the MDT grippers and the tubing was much less than the anticipated COF of the sandstone formation. Despite these minor limitations, to summarize the MDT operated as expected. Minor modifications to the MDT are being incorporated to improve gripping capability of the tractor. Additional demonstration wells are being arranged to expand on the project's goals of delivering a fully operational utilitarian tool for use throughout the US to improve reserves...|$|E

40|$|Gene {{regulatory}} networks can {{be described}} by continuous models in which genes are acting directly on each other. Genes are activated or inhibited by transcription factors which are direct gene products. The action of a transcription factor on a gene is modeled as a binary <b>on-off</b> response <b>function</b> around a certain threshold concentration. Different thresholds can regulate the behaviors of genes, so that the combined effect on a gene is generally assumed to obey Boolean-like composition rules. Analyzing the behavior of such network model is a challenging task in mathematical simulation, particularly when at least one variable is close to one of its thresholds, called switching domains. In this paper, we briefly review a particular class model for gene regulation networks, namely, the piece-wise linear model and we present an event-driven method to analyze the motion in switching domains...|$|R

The response of a Gaussian vortex to a weak time-dependent external strain field is studied numerically. The cases of an impulsive strain, an <b>on–off</b> step <b>function,</b> and a continuous random strain are considered. Transfers of enstrophy between mean and azimuthal components are observed, and the results are compared with an analogous passive scalar model and with Kida's elliptical vortex model. A ‘rebound’ phenomenon is seen: after enstrophy is transferred from mean to azimuthal component by the external straining field, there is a subsequent transfer of enstrophy back from the azimuthal component to the mean. Analytical support is given for this phenomenon using Lundgren's asymptotic formulation of the spiral wind-up of vorticity. Finally the decay of the vortex under a continuous random external strain is studied numerically and compared with the passive scalar model. The vorticity distribution decays more slowly than the scalar because of the rebound phenomenon...|$|R
40|$|The term "valve " {{applies to}} a variety of devices for {{controlling}} the flow of liquid. Various valves allow for on-off control, modulation of the flow rate through the system, and prevention of back flow. They can also be used for pressure relief or as a safety device. In general, valves can vary from simple manual on-off devices to sophisticated control equipment which act as metering instruments and deliver predetermined amounts of water to the system.

40|$|AbstractThe spatial tuning {{function}} of the 8 Hz reversal Visual Evoked Potential (VEP) is frequently bimodal. This amplitude ‘notch’ largely disappears with 16 Hz pattern onset–offset (on–off) stimulation. To investigate the effect of temporal frequency on this phenomenon, we tested seven subjects using a range of rates centred on 8 Hz (reversal) and 16 Hz (on–off). With reversal, a deep notch was present at all temporal frequencies. A much shallower notch was evident with on–off. The <b>on–off</b> and reversal <b>functions</b> differed only in their low spatial frequency branches (below 4. 5 c deg− 1) where, as temporal frequency decreased, the reversal response was reduced by 50 %, whilst the on–off responses doubled in amplitude. Thus, although they behave differently with on–off and reversal, multiple spatial frequency mechanisms are evident with both forms of stimulation...|$|R
40|$|A {{feasibility}} study {{to design and}} demonstrate solid-state switchgear composed of circuit breakers and a power transfer switch is described. The switchgear operates on a nominal 270 Vdc circuit and controls power to a load up to 15 A. One circuit breaker may be interconnected to a second to form a power transfer switch. Breaker or switch <b>on-off</b> and transfer <b>functions</b> can be remotely controlled. Automatic overload trip-out is provided through an ultimate current trip and an I squared t trip for transient overcurrents lower than the ultimate current trip level. A number of reclosures with variable time delay between trip-out and reclosure are programmed and controlled by integrated analog and COSMOS logic circuits. A commutation circuit that creates minimal transient disturbances to either source or load was developed to interrupt current flow through the main SCR switching element. ...|$|R

The as-synthesized amorphous purple solid, [Pt(CN) (2) (H(2) dcphen) ] 2 H(2) O (1 P), exhibited vapochromic {{behavior in the}} presence of alcoholic vapors through transformation to a red, crystalline, porous, vapor-adsorbed form, 1 Rvapor. The obtained 1 Rvapor complex released the adsorbed vapors upon heating without collapse of the porous structure. The vaporfree, porous 1 Ropen could detect water or n-hexane vapor, although these vapors could not induce 1 P-to- 1 Rvapor transformation, and 1 Ropen could easily be converted to the initial 1 P by manual grinding. These results indicate that 1 is a new shape-memory material that functions through formation and collapse of the porous framework with an emission change upon vapor-adsorption and grinding; this enables it to exhibit vapor history and <b>ON-OFF</b> switching sensing <b>functions...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{theory of}} the solar/stellar {{activity}} cycles is presented, based on the mean-field concept in magnetohydrodynamics. A new approach to the formulation of the electromotive force {{as well as the}} theory of differential rotation and meridional circulation is described for use in dynamo theory. Activity cycles of dynamos in the overshoot layer (BL-dynamo) and distributed dynamos are compared, with the latter including the influence of meridional flow. The overshoot layer dynamo is able to reproduce the solar cycle periods and the butterfly diagram only if α = 0 in the convection zone. The problems of too many magnetic belts and too short cycle times emerge if the overshoot layer is too thin. The distributed dynamo including meridional flows with a magnetic Reynolds number Rm> ∼ 20 (low magnetic Prandtl number) reproduces the observed butterfly diagram even with a positive dynamo-α in the bulk of the convection zone. The nonlinear feedback of strong magnetic fields on differential rotation in the mean-field conservation law of angular momentum leads to grand minima in the cyclic activity similar to those observed. The 2 D model described here contains the large-scale interactions as well as the small-scale feedback of magnetic fields on differential rotation and induction in terms of a mean-field formulation (Λquenching, α-quenching). Grand minima may also occur if a dynamo occasionally falls below its critical eigenvalue. We expressed this idea by an <b>on-off</b> α <b>function</b> which is non-zero only in a certain range of magnetic fields near the equipartition value. We never found any indication that the dynamo collapses by this effect after it had once been excited.

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{characterize}} the clinical, electrophysiologic, and genetic features in "cone dystrophy with supernormal rod electroretinogram (ERG). " METHODS: Twenty-four cases between 5 and 59 years of age were ascertained. Full-field ERGs, incorporating the international standards, were used to derive intensity-ERG response <b>functions.</b> <b>ON-OFF</b> ERGs were performed. Fundus autofluorescence imaging was performed on 15 subjects. Deoxyribonucleic acid was available in 18 cases and was screened for a mutation in KCNV 2. RESULTS: Photophobia and nyctalopia were common. Autofluorescence was variable but often showed a ring-like area of high density that in middle-aged individuals, usually surrounded by an area of macular retinal pigment epithelial atrophy. Scotopic ERG amplitudes overlapped with the normal range but had characteristic a- and b-wave intensity-response functions; all had a broadened a-wave to the brightest flash. Photopic ERGs were abnormal; there was a delay in some ON and most OFF responses. Mutations in KCNV 2 were detected in 18 cases, including 4 with novel mutations. CONCLUSION: Individuals with mutations in KCNV 2 manifest a wide range of macular and autofluorescence abnormalities. A ring-like area of parafoveal high density autofluorescence is common. ERG amplitudes are variable, but the intensity-ERG response functions and bright flash ERG waveforms are pathognomonic...|$|R
40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at www. blackwell-synergy. comWhat is already known about this subject • Carnitine is essential for fatty acid metabolism, and is obtained from the diet and endogenous synthesis. • Patients with renal failure who are on chronic haemodialysis may require carnitine supplementation. • It is known that carnitine depletion in these patients may take years to develop, and that measurements of plasma carnitine may not be predictive of loss of carnitine from muscle, the main pool of carnitine in the body. What this study adds • This paper adds a quantitative understanding of the time-course {{of the relationship between}} haemodialysis and the plasma concentration of L-carnitine, with particular reference to how the carnitine pools in the body re-equilibrate after a dialysis session. • It also provides insight into the time-course of the depletion of L-carnitine in these patients. Aims Patients requiring chronic haemodialysis may develop a secondary carnitine deficiency through dialytic loss of L-carnitine. A previous report has described the plasma concentrations of L-carnitine in 12 such patients under baseline conditions and after L-carnitine administration (20 [*]mg[*]kg− 1). A three-compartment pharmacokinetic model was developed to describe these data to make inferences about carnitine supplementation in these patients. Methods L-carnitine removal was mediated solely by intermittent haemodialysis, which was incorporated into the model as an experimentally derived dialysis clearance value that was linked to an <b>on-off</b> pulse <b>function.</b> Data were described by a model with a central compartment linked to `fast'- and `slow'-equilibrating peripheral compartments. Results The model adequately described the changing plasma concentrations of endogenous L-carnitine in individual haemodialysis patients. Based on pooled data (mean ± SD; n[*]=[*] 12), the volume of the central compartment was 10. 09 [*]±[*] 0. 72 [*]l and the transfer rate constants {{into and out of the}} slowly equilibrating pool were 0. 100 [*]±[*] 0. 018 [*]h− 1 and 0. 00014 [*]±[*] 0. 00016 [*]h− 1, respectively. The turnover time of L-carnitine in the slow pool (which was assumed to represent muscle) was approximately 300 [*]days. The model was in general agreement with separate data on the measured loss of carnitine from muscle in dialysis patients. Conclusions Haemodialysis causes rapid reductions in plasma L-carnitine concentrations with each dialysis session. Plasma concentrations are restored between sessions by redistribution from peripheral compartments. However, during chronic haemodialysis, the ongoing dialytic loss of L-carnitine may lead to a slow depletion of the compound, contributing to a possible secondary deficiency.
