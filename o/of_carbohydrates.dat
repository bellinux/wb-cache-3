30|$|Previous studies {{reported}} that continuous ingestion <b>of</b> <b>carbohydrate</b> before or during prolonged exercise attenuated elevation of plasma IL- 6 concentration (Nehlsen-Cannarella et al. 1997; Nieman et al. 2005). However, beneficial effect <b>of</b> <b>carbohydrate</b> ingestion was not {{evident in the}} present study. The {{finding is consistent with}} previous studies by Abbey and Rankin (2009) and Sim et al. (2012). Abbey and Rankin (2009) reported that carbohydrate ingestion (1.0  g/kg) before and the middle of 90  min of a simulated soccer game did not influence plasma IL- 6 concentration. Similarly, carbohydrate ingestion (3  ml/kg; 6  % carbohydrate solution) during 90  min of running did not affect exercise-induced IL- 6 response (Sim et al. 2012). The author speculated that the lack of the influence <b>of</b> <b>carbohydrate</b> ingestion on inflammatory response was due to insufficient amount <b>of</b> <b>carbohydrate</b> (a total <b>of</b> 855  ml solution, containing 0.73  g/kg <b>of</b> <b>carbohydrate).</b> However, the volume consumed during exercise session (1.0  g/kg) in the present study {{does not appear to be}} problematic because similar volume <b>of</b> <b>carbohydrate</b> (a total <b>of</b> 1219  ml solution, containing 1.1  g/kg <b>of</b> <b>carbohydrate)</b> revealed previously attenuation of inflammatory response during 90  min of high-intensity intermittent running (Bishop et al. 2002). Therefore, inconsistent outcomes among relevant studies may be attributed to the timing <b>of</b> <b>carbohydrate</b> consumption. In the previous studies that reported beneficial effect <b>of</b> <b>carbohydrate</b> ingestion (Nehlsen-Cannarella et al. 1997; Nieman et al. 2005), the subjects were provided carbohydrate frequently during prolonged exercise (every 15  min). Similarly, Bishop et al. (2002) demonstrated that carbohydrate ingestion during intermittent shuttle running maintained blood glucose concentration and subsequently blunted elevation of IL- 6 concentration when the carbohydrate was supplied every 15  min during the exercise. Considering these results, it is possible that more frequent supplementation <b>of</b> <b>carbohydrate</b> may cause apparent protective effect on elevation of IL- 6 concentration. Furthermore, Mb and CK concentrations (indirect muscle damage markers) did not differ significantly among three trials in the present study, although we expected that carbohydrate ingestion before and during exercise attenuated elevation of muscle damage markers. A plausible reason for lack of the effect may be also lower frequency <b>of</b> <b>carbohydrate</b> ingestion during exercise sessions.|$|R

5|$|It is {{considered}} that overeating {{and lack of}} muscle tone is {{the main cause of}} a beer belly, rather than beer consumption. A 2004 study, however, found a link between binge drinking and a beer belly.

Several diet books quote beer as having an undesirably high glycemic index of 110, the same as maltose; however, the maltose in beer undergoes metabolism by yeast during fermentation so that beer consists mostly of water, hop oils and only trace amounts of sugars, including maltose.|$|E

30|$|Some {{previous}} studies proved that reducing carbohydrates and {{replacing them with}} protein and fat led to reduced amounts of T 3 (Serog et al. 1982; Otten et al. 1980).

Increasing the amount <b>of</b> <b>carbohydrate</b> in this study, however, kept T 3 levels unchanged even though PER was high.

An unknown mechanism in plants may use titanium to stimulate the production <b>of</b> <b>carbohydrates</b> and encourage growth.

The high levels of protein and fibre (which are comparable to values found in meat and vegetables, respectively) suggest that the egg form of P.indusiatus is a good food source. The concentration of several mineral elements, including potassium, sodium, and iron, was also favourable compared to fruits and vegetables, although the mineral composition in the fungus is dependent on their corresponding concentrations in the soil in which they grow.|$|E
5|$|Carbohydrate {{catabolism}} is {{the breakdown}} <b>of</b> <b>carbohydrates</b> into smaller units. Carbohydrates are usually taken into cells {{once they have}} been digested into monosaccharides. Once inside, the major route of breakdown is glycolysis, where sugars such as glucose and fructose are converted into pyruvate and some ATP is generated. Pyruvate is an intermediate in several metabolic pathways, but the majority is converted to acetyl-CoA through aerobic (with oxygen) glycolysis and fed into the citric acid cycle. Although some more ATP is generated in the citric acid cycle, the most important product is NADH, which is made from NAD+ as the acetyl-CoA is oxidized. This oxidation releases carbon dioxide as a waste product. In anaerobic conditions, glycolysis produces lactate, through the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase re-oxidizing NADH to NAD+ for re-use in glycolysis. An alternative route for glucose breakdown is the pentose phosphate pathway, which reduces the coenzyme NADPH and produces pentose sugars such as ribose, the sugar component of nucleic acids.|$|E
5|$|Ecological {{interactions}} can {{be classified}} broadly into a host and an associate relationship. A host is any entity that harbours another that is called the associate. Relationships within a species that are mutually or reciprocally beneficial are called mutualisms. Examples of mutualism include fungus-growing ants employing agricultural symbiosis, bacteria living in the guts of insects and other organisms, the fig wasp and yucca moth pollination complex, lichens with fungi and photosynthetic algae, and corals with photosynthetic algae. If there is a physical connection between host and associate, the relationship is called symbiosis. Approximately 60% of all plants, for example, have a symbiotic relationship with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi living in their roots forming an exchange network <b>of</b> <b>carbohydrates</b> for mineral nutrients.|$|E

Meals were spaced out through the day to aid assimilation. Canned food such as jellied beef tongue was placed into a niche in the core module's table, where it could be warmed in 5–10 minutes.

5|$|Photo{{synthesis}} is {{the synthesis}} <b>of</b> <b>carbohydrates</b> from sunlight {{and carbon dioxide}} (CO2). In plants, cyanobacteria and algae, oxygenic photosynthesis splits water, with oxygen produced as a waste product. This process uses the ATP and NADPH produced by the photosynthetic reaction centres, as described above, to convert CO2 into glycerate 3-phosphate, which can then be converted into glucose. This carbon-fixation reaction is {{carried out by the}} enzyme RuBisCO as part of the Calvin– Benson cycle. Three types of photosynthesis occur in plants, C3 carbon fixation, C4 carbon fixation and CAM photosynthesis. These differ by the route that carbon dioxide takes to the Calvin cycle, with C3 plants fixing CO2 directly, while C4 and CAM photosynthesis incorporate the CO2 into other compounds first, as adaptations to deal with intense sunlight and dry conditions.|$|E
5|$|Suillus salmonicolor {{occurs in}} a {{mycorrhizal}} association with various species of Pinus. This is a mutualistic relationship in which the subterranean fungal mycelia creates a protective sheath around the rootlets of the tree and a network of hyphae (the Hartig net) that penetrates between the tree's epidermal and cortical cells. This association helps the plant absorb water and mineral nutrients; in exchange, the fungus receives a supply <b>of</b> <b>carbohydrates</b> produced by the plant's photosynthesis. Two-, three-, and five-needled pines have all been recorded to associate with S.salmonicolor. In North America, the fungus has been found growing with P.banksiana, P.palustris, P.resinosa, P.rigida, P.strobus and P.taeda.
