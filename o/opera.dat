5|$|Giacomo Meyerbeer (born Jacob Liebmann Beer; 5 September 1791 – 2 May 1864) was a German <b>opera</b> {{composer}} of Jewish birth who {{has been}} described as perhaps the most successful stage composer of the nineteenth century.

Meyerbeer's grand <b>opera</b> style was achieved by his merging of German orchestra style with Italian vocal tradition. These were employed in the context of sensational and melodramatic libretti created by Eugène Scribe and were enhanced by the up-to-date theatre technology of the Paris <b>Opéra.</b> They set a standard which helped to maintain Paris as the <b>opera</b> capital of the nineteenth century.|$|E
