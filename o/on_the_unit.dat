5|$|An early-war Army {{anti-aircraft}} company (Flugabwehr-Kompanie) {{was organized}} in three platoons {{with a total}} of eighteen Sd.Kfz. 10/4s, twelve with guns and six carrying ammunition. When the four-barrel 2 cm Flakvierling 38 was fielded in 1941 each platoon had four Sd.Kfz. 10/4s towing the guns and another for ammunition. Later these companies were reorganized {{with a total of}} eight Sd.Kfz. 10/4s carrying guns, two towing Flakvierlings and three carrying ammunition. These are just examples of some of the Army organizations which differed depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>unit</b> and the period. Sd.Kfz. 10/5s were substituted for 10/4s on a one for one basis. Detailed records do not survive for the Luftwaffe light anti-aircraft units, but they appear to have been organized into batteries of nine or twelve guns.|$|E
5|$|The Viet Cong {{apparently}} suffered light casualties {{with only}} 32 soldiers officially confirmed killed, {{and they did}} not leave a single casualty on the battlefield. In recognition of the 271st Regiment's performance during the Bình Giã campaign, the NLF High Command bestowed the title 'Bình Giã Regiment' <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>unit</b> to honour their achievement. Following the Bình Giã campaign, the Viet Cong went on to occupy Hoài Đức District and the strategic hamlets of Đất Đỏ, Long Thành and Nhơn Trạch along Inter-provincial Road No. 2 and 15. They also expanded the Hát Dịch base area, which was located in Bà Rịa and Bình Thuận Provinces, to protect the important sea transportation routes used by the Vietnam People's Navy to supply Viet Cong units around the regions of the Mekong River.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Operator-valued multivariable Bohr type inequalities are {{obtained}} for: (i) {{a class of}} noncommutative holomorphic functions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> open <b>unit</b> ball of B(H) n, generalizing <b>the</b> analytic functions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> open <b>unit</b> disc; (ii) <b>the</b> noncommutative disc algebra An and the noncommutative analytic Toeplitz algebra F ∞ n; (iii) a class of noncommutative selfadjoint harmonic functions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> open <b>unit</b> ball of B(H) n, generalizing the real-valued harmonic functions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> open <b>unit</b> disc; (iv) <b>the</b> Cuntz-Toeplitz algebra C ∗ (S 1, [...] ., Sn), the reduced (resp. full) group C ∗-algebra C ∗ red(Fn) (resp.

The classical Bohr inequality is {{shown to be a}} consequence of Fejér’s inequality for the coefficients of positive trigonometric polynomials and Haagerup-de la Harpe inequality for nilpotent operators.

25|$|In {{terms of}} {{algebraic}} geometry, the algebraic variety of rational points <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>unit</b> circle is birational to the affine line over the rational numbers.

First Wilson associates a bivector with an ellipse. The product of the bivector with a complex number <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>unit</b> circle is then called an elliptical rotation.

25|$|The bifurcations of a {{hyperbolic}} {{fixed point}} x0 {{of a system}} family Fμ can be characterized by the eigenvalues of the first derivative of the system DF'μ(x0) computed at the bifurcation point.

25|$|In mathematics, the {{dimension}} of an object is an intrinsic property independent of the space in which the object is embedded. For example, a point <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>unit</b> circle in the plane can be specified by two Cartesian coordinates, but a single polar coordinate (the angle) would be sufficient, so the circle is 1-dimensional even though it exists in the 2-dimensional plane. This intrinsic notion of dimension {{is one of the}} chief ways the mathematical notion of dimension differs from its common usages.|$|E
