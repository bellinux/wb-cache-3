5|$|Potbelly {{sculpture}}s from Sin Cabezas are stylistically {{related to}} Olmec sculpture but were reused by later peoples, being found in fill {{dating to the}} Late Classic period. The monuments at Sin Cabezas were headless when they were found and no fragments of the missing heads were evident, suggesting that they had already been damaged when they were re-erected by later <b>occupants</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> site.|$|E

5|$|Concealed shoes {{hidden in}} the fabric of a {{building}} have been discovered in many European countries, as well as {{in other parts of the}} world, since at least the early modern period. Independent researcher Brian Hoggard has observed that the locations in which these shoes are typically found– in chimneys, under floors, above ceilings, around doors and windows, in the roof– suggest that some may have been concealed as magical charms to protect the <b>occupants</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building against evil influences such as demons, ghosts and witches. Others may have been intended to bestow fertility on a female member of the household, or been an offering to a household deity.|$|E
5|$|On {{capturing}} the second-line, {{elements of the}} Liverpool Scottish decided to consolidate the shallow trenches that afforded little protection. The battle had quickly degenerated into a disorganised and chaotic affair, with British battalions losing cohesion and becoming mixed up with each other. An intensive German barrage decimated the <b>occupants</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second-line trenches, while the 10th's temporary commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel E.G. Thin, was wounded by gunfire. The remainder of the Liverpool Scottish continued onto the third-line with portions of the Royal Scots Fusiliers and 1st Northumberland Fusiliers.|$|E
5|$|Since {{at least}} the early modern period it was a common custom to hide objects such as written charms, dried cats, horse skulls, and witch bottles in the {{structure}} of a building, but concealed shoes are by far the most common items discovered. Archaeologist Brian Hoggard has observed that the locations in which these shoes are found suggest that at least some were concealed as magical charms to protect the <b>occupants</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building against evil influences. Such hidden caches of objects are known by archaeologists as spiritual middens.|$|E

50|$|Davis held a pilot's license, {{and died}} in <b>the</b> crash <b>of</b> a small {{single-engine}} aircraft near Milford, Illinois, on 20 November 2006. He was <b>the</b> sole <b>occupant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> craft.|$|R
50|$|From 1963 to 1984 the Health Department was a {{principal}} <b>occupant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Administration Building. Since 1988 {{the building has}} been occupied by Family Services, and {{takes its name from}} this department.|$|R
5|$|The Land Estates Act of 1908 {{was passed}} by the Madras Government in order to protect {{cultivators}} in Zamindaris from exploitation. Under the act, ryots were made permanent <b>occupants</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> land. However, far from protecting the ryots, the legislation proved to be detrimental to the interests of the cultivators in the Oriya-speaking northern districts of the presidency who were the intended beneficiaries, as it tied the cultivator to his land and landlord with the chains of eternal serfdom. In 1933, an amendment to the Act was introduced by the Raja of Bobbili to curb the rights of Zamindars and safeguard the cultivators from exploitation. This act was passed in the legislative council despite strong opposition from the Zamindars.|$|E
5|$|The Playford family {{heritage}} can {{be traced}} back to 1759, when a baby boy was left at the door of a house in Barnby Dun, Yorkshire, England, with a note to christen the child 'Thomas Playford'. The <b>occupants</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house, who were to raise the child, were given instructions to receive money from a bank account for the deed. The child grew up to be a simple farmer in the village, and had a son in 1795 who he christened 'Thomas Playford'. The tradition of naming the firstborn son in the family in this way has continued since.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} the {{explosion}} was debated in the days immediately following the fire. Public speculation led {{to the arrest of}} Crocker and Warren, the <b>occupants</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> warehouse. The Daily-Tribune reported that the explosions could not have occurred without the presence of gunpowder in addition to the saltpeter, and thus they were suspected of possessing gunpowder, which would have led to a murder charge. However, later inquiry released Crocker and Warren of all charges as no evidence of gunpowder was discovered.|$|E

50|$|Every <b>occupant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{position}} has simultaneously held a sinecure office, this being Chancellor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Duchy <b>of</b> Lancaster from Clark to Byrne, Paymaster General from Jowell to Gummer, and First Secretary of State with Green.|$|R
5|$|The next morning, the {{schooner}} Lioness discovered {{one of the}} cutters, {{and after}} saving the <b>occupants</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second boat {{made her way to}} the scene of the disaster. Arriving in the afternoon, she found 40 people still clinging to the rigging. It was reported that of the approximately 643people aboard, only 193 were saved. Captain Edward WC Wright of the 91st Argyllshire Regiment was the most senior army officer to survive; he was awarded a brevet majority for his actions during the ordeal, dated 26 February 1852.|$|E
5|$|The outer {{bands of}} Hurricane Dean {{produced}} heavy rainfall and winds up to 75mph (121km/h) across Antigua and Barbuda. There was no reported {{damage in the}} Leeward Islands or the Virgin Islands since the hurricane turned northward. In the Atlantic, a sailboat bound for Bermuda was caught off guard by the hurricane. The boat, which carried no radio equipment, was spotted by a hurricane hunter plane. The <b>occupants</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boat suffered no injuries. In Bermuda, the hurricanes eastern eyewall produced 81mph (130km/h) sustained winds with gusts up to 113mph (182km/h). Bermuda highest rainfall total from Dean was 2.45in (50.8mm) while parts of the island received 3-5in (76.2–127mm) of rain.|$|E
5|$|Though Brigham fully {{expected}} an all-out attack on Fort Blue Mounds following the incidents, it never came. The only violence that befell the <b>occupants</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fort was that perpetrated {{on those who}} left its confines on June 6 and June 20. Dodge left a detachment at the fort for a time but after the June 20 attack the fort was never again a target during the Black Hawk War. Until {{the end of the}} war, Fort Blue Mounds served primarily as a supply center for the militia as they continued their pursuit of Black Hawk across Wisconsin.|$|E

25|$|A {{doorbell}} is a signaling device {{commonly found}} near a door. It commonly emits a ringing sound to alert <b>the</b> <b>occupant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building to a visitor's presence. The electric doorbell {{was invented by}} Joseph Henry in 1831.|$|R
50|$|Angelokastro is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most {{important}} fortified complexes of Corfu. It was an acropolis which surveyed the region {{all the way}} to the southern Adriatic and presented a formidable strategic vantage point to <b>the</b> <b>occupant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> castle.|$|R
5|$|With these resources, Henry {{erected a}} number of siege engines around the castle; one {{probable}} trebuchet and two mangonels were set up {{to the east of}} the castle; two mangonels were placed on the west side, to attack the keep, and one mangonel on both the north and south sides. Two siege-castles were established to observe the <b>occupants</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> castle. William was confident, however, that either his brother would return and relieve the siege, or that the pope would intervene, and held on despite the artillery attacks. The losses in the royal army began to mount; chronicler Ralph of Coggeshall suggests that seven knights, and over 200 soldiers and labourers were killed as the siege dragged on.|$|E
5|$|A deck {{decompression}} chamber (DDC), or double-lock chamber is a two compartment {{pressure vessel}} for human occupation which has sufficient space in the main chamber for two or more occupants, and a forechamber which can allow a person to be pressurised or decompressed while the main chamber remains under constant pressure. This allows an attendant to be locked in or out during treatment of the <b>occupant(s)</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main chamber. There is usually also a medical lock, which serves a similar function but is much smaller. This is used to transfer medical material, food and specimens {{into and out of}} the main chamber while it is under pressure. Most {{deck decompression chamber}}s are fitted with built in breathing systems (BIBS), which supply an alternative breathig gas to the occupants (usually oxygen), and discharge the exhaled gas outside the chamber, so the chamber gas is not excessively enriched by oxygen, which would cause an unacceptable fire hazard, and require frequent flushing with chamber gas (usually air).|$|E
5|$|One of {{the stated}} {{purposes}} for writing the account was Las Casas's fear of Spain coming under divine punishment and {{his concern for}} {{the souls of the}} native peoples. The account {{was one of the first}} attempts by a Spanish writer of the colonial era to depict the unfair treatment that the indigenous people endured during the early stages of the Spanish conquest of the Greater Antilles, particularly the island of Hispaniola. Las Casas's point of view can be described as being heavily against some of the Spanish methods of colonization, which, as he described them, inflicted great losses on the indigenous <b>occupants</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> islands. His account was largely responsible for the adoption of the New Laws of 1542, which abolished native slavery for the first time in European colonial history and led to the Valladolid debate.|$|E
50|$|Bright became <b>the</b> first <b>occupant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Caroline Donovan Chair of English, {{which was}} {{established}} in 1905. He held the chair {{until his retirement in}} 1925. His successor as Chairman (though not as Donovan Professor) was John Calvin French.|$|R
50|$|Ernst Gustav Gotthelf Marcus (8 June 1893 - 30 June 1968) was a German zoologist, former <b>occupant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chair <b>of</b> zoology at University of São Paulo from 1936 to 1963, {{and co-founder}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Oceanographic Institute <b>of</b> <b>the</b> University <b>of</b> São Paulo.|$|R
50|$|A notable <b>occupant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> convent was Jacoba <b>of</b> Loon-Heinsberg, {{formerly}} <b>the</b> abbess <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Thorn Abbey {{in what is}} now the Netherlands, who withdrew to Bethany in 1455. Her 1468 will {{indicates that}} a printing press was left to the convent.|$|R
5|$|Patricia Jones {{never made}} it to her house that evening, {{according}} to her husband. Walter Jones filed a missing persons report with police the next day and began calling people he thought might have seen his wife. He got a lead when he spoke to friends of Patricia's who carpooled to work with her. The friends told Jones that Patricia had reported receiving a phone call that day from an unnamed woman who wanted to meet with her. She had asked the carpool driver to drop her off at a street corner in Independence, which he had done. The <b>occupants</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> carpool had seen a woman waiting for Jones in another car at the shop but did not recognize her. They nevertheless provided a description of the unknown woman to Jones.|$|E
5|$|Richard Bellingham died on 7 December 1672. He was {{the last}} {{surviving}} signer of the colonial charter, and was buried in Boston's Granary Burying Ground. He was survived by his son Samuel {{from his first marriage}} and his second wife Penelope, who outlived him by 30 years. His landholdings at Winnessimmett became tied up in legal action lasting more than 100 years, and involved court and procedural decisions {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic to resolve. Under the terms of his will, some of his properties in Winnessimmett were set aside for religious uses. His son challenged the will, which was eventually set aside. The litigation continued, carried on by his heirs and succeeding owners and <b>occupants</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> properties, and was finally concluded in 1785. The town of Bellingham, Massachusetts is named in his honor, and a number of features in Chelsea, including a square, a street, and a hill, bear the name Bellingham.|$|E
5|$|The {{intersection}} of 7th Street NW and H Street NW {{is the heart}} of D.C.'s Chinatown neighborhood today, but prior to the 1930s it was populated primarily by German immigrants. Before the American Civil War, 7th Street NW was the city's primary commercial district, the street lined with three-story Federal-style townhouses with shops on the ground floor and residences above. Lincoln conspirator Mary Surratt's boarding house (604 H Street NW) has been substantially renovated through the years (and currently houses a Chinese restaurant), but it may also house Mary Surratt's ghost. From the 1870s onward, <b>occupants</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building have claimed that Surratt's spirit is responsible for the incomprehensible mumbling and whispers, footsteps, muffled sobs, and creaking floorboards which have unnerved them.|$|E
50|$|CQT is <b>the</b> {{principal}} <b>occupant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{building at}} 3 Science Drive 2 (off Lower Kent Ridge Road), Block S15 on <b>the</b> campus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> National University <b>of</b> Singapore. <b>The</b> building is readily accessible by the NUS Internal Bus Service 'A1', 'A2', 'C' or 'D' to CQT.|$|R
50|$|Following Berry's {{death the}} {{property}} was held in trust by his wife, Margaret Berry, and George Miles Challinor, a clerk of Esk, until July 1889 when title to the land was transferred to William Berry's son, Alexander, although Margaret Berry appears to have remained as <b>occupant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house.|$|R
2500|$|The Candy Desk {{has been}} a {{tradition}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States Senate since 1968, whereby a senator who sits at a particular desk near a busy entrance keeps a drawer full of candy for members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body. [...] <b>The</b> current <b>occupant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Candy Desk is Pennsylvania Senator Pat Toomey.|$|R
