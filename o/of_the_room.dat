5|$|It is, however, an {{accurate}} depiction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> {{in the building}} known today as Independence Hall, {{the centerpiece of the}} Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Trumbull visited the room, which was where the Second Continental Congress met, when researching for his painting. At the time it was the Pennsylvania State House.|$|E
5|$|Later, Mulder discovers Harold {{in a room}} {{accessible}} {{from the}} bowling alley. The walls <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> are covered with score sheets, {{including those of the}} victims. Mulder realizes that Harold met each of the murdered women at the bowling alley. Harold lapses into a strange seizure, and from his point of view, sees Angie's ghost standing behind Mulder. He rushes out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and makes his way to the bowling alley, where Angie lies dead from a heart attack. Mulder tells Scully that every person who saw the apparitions was about to die, implying that Harold may be next. Scully, who also saw a victim's ghost, is struck by the implication.|$|E
60|$|It {{was decided}} that the twins should occupy one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> with a double bed. Gif and Spouter took the other double bed, and Fred and Jack went into one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> {{containing}} two single beds.|$|R

A graffito in one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upstairs <b>rooms</b> has allowed <b>the</b> building to be dated to c. 710.|$|R
5|$|Room of Mars: is {{characterized}} by works by Rubens: the allegories representing the Consequences of War (hence the name <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room)</b> and the Four Philosophers (among them Rubens portrayed himself, on the left).

5|$|The McCanns' {{children}} {{slept in}} a bedroom next to the front door, which the McCanns kept locked. The bedroom had one waist-high window with curtains and a metal exterior shutter, the latter controlled by a cord inside the window; the McCanns kept the curtains and shutter closed throughout the holiday. The window overlooked a narrow walkway and residents' car park, which was separated by a low wall from the street. Madeleine {{slept in a}} single bed next to the bedroom door, {{on the opposite side}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> from the window, while the twins were in travel cots in the middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> There was another, empty, single bed underneath the window.|$|E
50|$|Beginning in 1989, some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> older <b>rooms</b> {{were torn}} down and {{construction}} began on two additional three-story buildings. <b>The</b> <b>rooms</b> {{in this building}} contained televisions (which were eventually added to all <b>the</b> <b>rooms.)</b> Telephones were not added to any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> until 1990.|$|R
50|$|Internally <b>the</b> older {{sections}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cottage have lath {{and plaster}} walls and ceilings, timber floors, and some original joinery. <b>The</b> upper parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> walls taper in towards <b>the</b> <b>room</b> as {{they reach the}} ceiling. Chimney breasts are found in two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early <b>rooms,</b> and towards <b>the</b> ceiling these taper outward. Remnants of early wall paper survive in several <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms,</b> and efforts {{have been made by}} the present owners to repaper one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> with a reconstructed paper.|$|R

5|$|A {{fighter pilot}} based at Andrews Air Force Base, Billy Hutchison, claims that {{while in the}} air he spotted Flight 93 on his scope and planned to first fire his {{training}} rounds into the engine and cockpit, and then ram the airplane with his own jet. His account was published in Lynn Spencer's book Touching History. John Farmer, Senior Counsel to the 9/11 commission, pointed out that this account would have been impossible, as Hutchison's Air Andrews Squadron {{was not in the}} air until 10:38, almost 30 minutes after Flight 93 had crashed. When the 9/11 commission asked Hutchison why he gave this false claim he stormed out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and refused to give an answer.|$|E
5|$|A strong {{smell of}} burning {{was present in}} the Lords' {{chambers}} during the afternoon of 16 October, and at 4:00pm two gentlemen tourists visiting to see the Armada tapestries that hung there were unable to view them properly because of the thick smoke. As they approached Black Rod's box in the corner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> they felt heat from the floor coming through their boots. Shortly after 4:00pm Cross and Furlong finished work, put the last few sticks into the furnaces—closing the doors as they did so—and left {{to go to the}} nearby Star and Garter public house.|$|E
5|$|A {{variation}} of this theory by some present-day residents of Kaliningrad (formerly Königsberg), {{is that at}} least parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> {{were found in the}} Königsberg Castle cellars after World War II by the Red Army. The Amber Room was allegedly still in good condition; this was not admitted at the time so the blame could fall upon the Nazis. To preserve this story, access to the ruins of the castle, which was allowed after World War II, was suddenly restricted to all, including historical and archaeological surveys, but the room is said to be in a storehouse near Konigsburg castle.|$|E

5|$|Above is the Great Chamber, an {{impressive}} {{room with a}} barrel ceiling with geometrical plaster decoration featuring John Lyte's arms and those of his wife, Edith Horsey. This ceiling is a rare survival. The wall above the bed displays the royal coat of arms and Tudor roses, signifying Lyte's loyalty to King Henry VIII (whose government Lyte represented in Somerset). The panelling is 17th century, as are the great four poster bed and the tapestries on the walls. Some of the original oak panelling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> {{may have been used}} {{in the construction of the}} canopy of the bed.|$|E
5|$|After Paul {{wakes up}} and {{mentions}} that he argued with Diana, an anonymous caller informs Diana of what Paul said and she begins packing.

Diana tells him that she did not push him, but if she did, he would be in the morgue. She asks him to tell the truth and do the right thing, before leaving through the side entrance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
5|$|Alex convinces Principal Skinner {{to have a}} school-dance {{rather than}} the regular yearly event of apple picking. Skinner agrees, so Alex and Lisa, {{accompanied}} by Sherri, Terri, Janey and Allison visit the mall to purchase party supplies, but the girls detour and begin trying on outfits for the dance, despite Lisa's protests. The group leave the mall, none speaking to each other. Lisa decides not to attend the dance, but changes her mind {{and goes to the}} school to take tickets at the door, but later arrives and discovers the boys and girls are standing on different sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> and explains to Alex that it is like this because they are only children, not adults.|$|E

Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room’s</b> present furnishings, such as the ornate gilded mirror and the matching Victorian window cornices, date to the late 19th century.|$|R

5|$|Back in London Emmeline {{was visited}} by Sylvia, {{who had not}} seen her mother in years. Their {{politics}} were by now very different, and Sylvia was living, unmarried, with an Italian anarchist. Sylvia described a moment of familial affection when they met, followed by a sad distance between them. Emmeline's adopted daughter Mary, however, remembered the meeting differently. According to her version, Emmeline set her teacup down and walked silently out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> leaving Sylvia in tears. Christabel, meanwhile, had become a convert to Adventism and devoted {{much of her time}} to the church. The British press sometimes made light of the varied paths followed by the once indivisible family.|$|E

5|$|Candaules {{depicts a}} scene from the first book of the Histories by Herodotus. Candaules, king of the ancient kingdom of Lydia, {{believed}} his wife Nyssia to be the world's most beautiful woman. He discussed his wife's beauty with his favourite bodyguard Gyges, but felt Gyges was lying when he told him that he agreed about her beauty. Candaules arranged, over the protests of Gyges, for Gyges to hide behind his bedroom door and secretly watch Nyssia undressing without her knowledge. Although he was unhappy at being forced to take part, Gyges reluctantly hid behind the door and watched Nyssia undress. Nyssia noticed Gyges as he slipped out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> afterwards, but remained silent.|$|E
