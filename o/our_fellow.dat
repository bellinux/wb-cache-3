25|$|It is {{not merely}} by the title of example that we cherish the memory of those in heaven; we seek, rather, that by this devotion to the {{exercise}} of fraternal charity the union of the whole Church in the Spirit may be strengthened. Exactly as Christian communion among <b>our</b> <b>fellow</b> pilgrims brings us closer to Christ, so our communion with the saints joins us to Christ.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, {{the issue}} of trade {{unionism}} {{was at the heart}} of the decision to support Solidarity in Poland in their party's literature. Likewise, during the Miner's Strike of 1984–5, the party walked a line between supporting the miners whilst simultaneously suggesting that they wouldn't and couldn't win: It is our job as socialists, then, to stand with <b>our</b> <b>fellow</b> workers in their necessary battles to defend themselves, but to point out at all times that the real victory to be achieved is the abolition of the wages system.|$|E

[...] "Ammunition is evidently failing, {{and it is}} {{impossible}} for <b>our</b> <b>fellows</b> to hold out much longer against such terrible odds.

60|$|The {{first time}} I ever saw them, I saw {{them in that}} way. There {{had been a good}} many changes among <b>our</b> <b>fellows</b> then, and it had turned out that Bob Tarter's father wasn't worth Millions! He wasn't worth anything. Bob had gone for a soldier, and Old Cheeseman had {{purchased}} his discharge. But that's not the carriage. The carriage stopped, and all <b>our</b> <b>fellows</b> stopped {{as soon as it was}} seen.|$|R
25|$|If {{it is so}} {{difficult}} to define terms such as 'psychology' with such precision, why bother? Why not just agree that we all have at least a rough idea of what psychology is, and take {{the rest of the afternoon}} off? After all, if theoretical or empirical work improves our understanding of some aspect of the world or <b>our</b> <b>fellow</b> people, or improves our ability to help people enhance their physical or emotional well being, what difference does it make whether this work is considered a part of psychology, of cognitive science, of behavioral neuroscience, of public health, or what have you? This raises the question of what definitions in general are good for.|$|E
25|$|She {{was also}} chosen as an {{ambassador}} of the 'Alam Sagheer' (Small World) program, along with Titanic actor and producer Billy Zane, dedicated to education without borders. Majida {{said during a}} press conference that the event is evidence that humanity can unite for good and to make peoples lives better anywhere in the world. She also thanked the organizers and hoped peace will spread all over the Arab world. The charity event was held under the patronage of H.H. Sheikh Nahyan bin Mubarak Al Nahyan, who described the festival as one that “celebrates human connections, international dialogue and {{strong support for the}} less fortunate of <b>our</b> <b>fellow</b> global citizens – values that are fundamental to our collective vision for the United Arab Emirates”. The festival took place at Emirates Palace and expected to raise millions for underprivileged children across the globe. The Minister toured with Majida various booths of participating countries and they attended performances for each country including Lebanon.|$|E
25|$|Head first {{showed his}} talent for {{teaching}} {{at the age of}} 21 when he addressed the Stoke Newington Mutual Instruction Society at the Friends Meeting House, Park Street, on the fertilization of plants. Professor H. M. Turnbull writes of Head's devotion to teaching:I had the good fortune when first going to the hospital to meet daily in the mornings on the steam engine underground railway Dr. Henry Head. He told me to buy Gee's little book on percussion, and kindly taught me throughout our journeys about physical signs, much to the annoyance of <b>our</b> <b>fellow</b> travellers; indeed in his characteristic keenness he spoke so loudly that as we walked to the hospital from St. Mary's station {{people on the other side}} of the wide Whitechapel Road would turn to look at us. I was greatly interested in the central nervous system when learning physiology and anatomy, and so I enjoyed greatly my three months as a clerk to him, his sessions in the out-patient department, and his wonderful demonstrations on clinical evenings.... He devoted a great deal of time to teaching. In his rounds of the wards his clerks read the histories and examinations they had written, and he criticized even the English. He did not confine himself to nervous diseases, but took more pains than any other physician for whom I clerked to teach us physical signs and – how to examine patients of all kinds. He was a little too anxious to get exactly correct results when demonstrating to students; thus when he was mapping out areas of anaesthesia or hyperaesthesia the cottonwool, pin, etc., would pass more slowly, and the 'say when' would become a little more rapid and insistent, as the correct boundary was approached.|$|E

500|$|For if our Trade may be taxed, why not our Lands? Why not the Produce of our Lands & {{everything}} we possess or make use of? This we apprehend annihilates our Charter Right to govern & tax ourselves. It strikes at our British privileges, which {{as we have}} never forfeited them, we hold in common with <b>our</b> <b>Fellow</b> Subjects who are Natives of Britain. If Taxes are laid upon us in any shape without our having a legal Representation where they are laid, are we not reduced from the Character of free Subjects to the miserable State of tributary Slaves? ...|$|E
500|$|Amin was {{informed}} of the Soviet decision to intervene in Afghanistan and was initially supportive, but was assassinated. Under the command of the Soviets, Karmal ascended to power. On 27 December 1979 Radio Kabul broadcast Karmal's pre-recorded speech to the Afghan people, saying: [...] "Today the torture machine of Amin has been smashed, his accomplices – the primitive executioners, usurpers and murderers of tens of thousand of <b>our</b> <b>fellow</b> countrymen – fathers, mothers, sisters, brothers, sons and daughters, children and old people..." [...] Karmal was not in Kabul when the speech was broadcast; he was in Bagram, protected by the KGB.|$|E

500|$|Longfellow's new landlady {{had earned}} a {{reputation}} for being eccentric and often wore a turban. In the 1840s, Longfellow wrote about an incident when canker-worms were devastating the elm trees on the property. Mrs. Craigie [...] "would sit by the open window and let them crawl over her white turban. She refused to have the trees protected against them & said, Why, sir, they have as good a right to live as we—they are <b>our</b> <b>fellow</b> worms". The maid at the time, a woman named Miriam, served Longfellow his meals in his room. Longfellow called her [...] "the giantess".|$|E
500|$|Pusztai {{later said}} {{that at the time}} of the {{interview}} he was not sure if he should reveal results from experiments that had not been completed and did not think the programme would be hostile toward genetically modified food. He estimated that the experiments were 99 percent complete when the interview was conducted. He said that the rats in his experiments suffered stunted growth and had suppressed immune systems and that more safety research was required. He also said, [...] "If you gave me the choice now, I wouldn't eat it" [...] and it was [...] "very, very unfair to use <b>our</b> <b>fellow</b> citizens as guinea pigs".|$|E
500|$|After leaving Washington, Diệm {{traveled}} to New York City, and disembarked from the Columbine III at LaGuardia Airport. New York {{had a large}} Irish Catholic population, and Diệm received an even greater reception than in the capital. Diệm was taken in a seven-car motorcade to St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City, where Bishop Joseph Flannelly delayed the mass to await the South Vietnamese president. After leading Diệm {{to a point of}} honor in the cathedral's sanctuary, Bishop Flannelly said [...] "We are delighted and we are proud to have... His Excellency Ngô Đình Diệm. The whole world acclaimed him when this God-fearing anti-communist and courageous statesman saved Vietnam! ... <b>our</b> <b>fellow</b> Catholics join our hearts and souls with you at this altar of God." ...|$|E

60|$|He {{had only}} one friend in the world, and that one was almost as {{powerless}} as he was, for it was only Jane. Jane {{was a sort of}} wardrobe woman to <b>our</b> <b>fellows,</b> and took care of the boxes. She had come at first, I believe, as a kind of apprentice--some of <b>our</b> <b>fellows</b> say from a Charity, but I don't know--and after her time was out, had stopped at so much a year. So little a year, perhaps I ought to say, for it is far more likely. However, she had put some pounds in the Savings' Bank, and she was a very nice young woman. She was not quite pretty; but she had a very frank, honest, bright face, and all <b>our</b> <b>fellows</b> were fond of her. She was uncommonly neat and cheerful, and uncommonly comfortable and kind. And if anything was the matter with a fellow's mother, he always went and showed the letter to Jane.|$|R
500|$|On 28 October 2015, the Ministry of Defence banned a {{large number}} of serving {{soldiers}} from attending a rally in support of Sergeant Blackman, saying that the event was a [...] "political protest". However, lawyers representing the rally organisers stated that was not the case, rather, the event was [...] "a show of support to one of <b>our</b> <b>fellow</b> Royal Marines and not a 'political protest. A related online government petition raised over 100,000 signatures calling for Sergeant Blackman's immediate release stating that the soldier had been condemned for defending his country. Within hours of the MoD's decision Michael Fallon, Minister for Defence, put out a government statement saying that the UK would maintain military operations in Afghanistan for the foreseeable future.|$|E
500|$|Several {{commentators}} have described Disney {{as a cultural}} icon. On his death, journalism professor Ralph S. Izard comments that the values in Disney's films are those [...] "considered valuable in American Christian society", which include [...] "individualism, decency,... love for <b>our</b> <b>fellow</b> man, fair play and toleration". Disney's obituary in The Times calls the films [...] "wholesome, warm-hearted and entertaining... of incomparable artistry and of touching beauty". Journalist Bosley Crowther argues that Disney's [...] "achievement as a creator of entertainment for an almost unlimited public and as a highly ingenious merchandiser of his wares can rightly {{be compared to the}} most successful industrialists in history." [...] Correspondent Alistair Cooke calls Disney a [...] "folk-hero... the Pied Piper of Hollywood", while Gabler considers Disney [...] "reshaped the culture and the American consciousness".

500|$|Wilderness {{protection}} and the conservation movement, led by {{figures such as}} John Muir, founder of the Sierra Club, also began to appear at this time. By {{the turn of the}} century, those in favor of recreational ideals of nature began to clash with conservationists such as Muir. Likewise, critics and natural scientists became skeptical of what they saw as a growing cult of nature, which was thought to wrongly champion sentimentality and aesthetics rather than scientific facts. Sympathy for animals and their survival also became a developing thought in the 19th century, due in part to wide acceptance of theories pertaining to organic evolution. In 1837, Charles Darwin wrote in his diary that [...] "If we choose to let conjecture run wild, then animals, <b>our</b> <b>fellow</b> brethren in pain, disease, death, suffering and famine—our slaves in the most laborious works, our companions in our amusements—they may partake of our origin in one common ancestor—we may be all melted together." ...|$|E

500|$|The sensationalism in {{the press}} that started before the trial {{continued}} throughout the trial, the appeals process, the commutation decision, and beyond. At the time, local papers were the dominant source of information, {{but they were not}} entirely anti-Frank. The Constitution alone assumed Frank's guilt, while both the Georgian and the Journal would later comment about the public hysteria in Atlanta during the trial, each suggesting the need to reexamine the evidence against the defendant. [...] On March 14, 1914, while the extraordinary motion hearing was pending, the Journal called for a new trial, saying that to execute Frank based on the atmosphere both within and outside the courtroom would [...] "amount to judicial murder." [...] Other newspapers in the state followed suit and many ministers spoke from the pulpit supporting a new trial. L. O. Bricker, the pastor of the church attended by Phagan's family, said that based on [...] "the awful tension of public feeling, it was next to impossible for a jury of <b>our</b> <b>fellow</b> human beings to have granted him a fair, fearless and impartial trial." ...|$|E
500|$|Other nationalists {{had high}} hopes for the German {{unification}} movement, and the frustration with lasting German unification after 1850 seemed to set the national movement back. Revolutionaries associated national unification with progress. As Giuseppe Garibaldi wrote to German revolutionary Karl Blind on 10 April 1865, [...] "The progress of humanity seems to {{have come to a}} halt, and you with your superior intelligence will know why. The reason is that the world lacks a nation [...] possesses true leadership. Such leadership, of course, is required not to dominate other peoples but to lead them along the path of duty, to lead them toward the brotherhood of nations where all the barriers erected by egoism will be destroyed." [...] Garibaldi looked to Germany for the [...] "kind of leadership , in the true tradition of medieval chivalry, would devote itself to redressing wrongs, supporting the weak, sacrificing momentary gains and material advantage for the much finer and more satisfying achievement of relieving the suffering of <b>our</b> <b>fellow</b> men. We need a nation courageous enough to give us a lead in this direction. It would rally to its cause all those who are suffering wrong or who aspire to a better life and all those who are now enduring foreign oppression." ...|$|E
