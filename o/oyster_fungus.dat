40|$|The article {{presents}} the results of inoculation of beech and oak stumps with a biological preparation of <b>oyster</b> <b>fungus</b> (Pleurotus ostreatus) mycelium. The inoculum was grown on a sawdust substrate at Warsaw University of Life Sciences Department of Mycology and Forest Phytopathology. The experiment was set up at the Forest Experimental Station in Rogów. Stumps were inoculated: i) immediately after tree felling or ii) at approximately 5 and 12 months after felling. A total of 60 beech stumps and 50 oak stumps were inoculated in the years 2002 - 2004. The infected stumps were then inspected for the presence of the mycelium and fruiting bodies of P. ostreatus. The presence of fruiting bodies of other wood-decaying fungi was also noted. The extent of rotting was determined macroscopically, with the causal agent being confirmed on the basis of isolation and identification of mycelium from fragments of colonized wood obtained from rooted-out stumps. <b>Oyster</b> <b>fungus</b> mycelium was found to colonise beech stumps much more effectively than oak stumps. Stumps inoculated immediately after, or five months after felling were more effectively colonized by the mycelium than those inoculated after one year. Przemysław Szmi...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the IgE-mediated pathogenesis of severe asthma presented by a patient only after handling shiitake (Lentinus edodes) mushrooms (SM). Material and Methods: Skin tests were performed using in-house extracts from mushrooms that the patient usually handled, i. e., shiitake, porcini, <b>oyster</b> and black <b>fungus</b> mushroom varieties. Specific IgE to champignons and various molds were determined. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) immunoblotting was performed to detect IgE-binding components. Four negative controls were included in the study. Results: Skin prick tests performed with in-house mushroom extracts from varieties other than shiitake were completely negative, in contrast to the positive test obtained for shiitake mushrooms. Serum specific IgE levels for common molds and champignons were all negative. SDS-PAGE revealed many protein bands in the four mushroom extracts. Immunoblotting using the patient’s serum showed allergenic bands at about 15 and 24 kDa exclusively for SM that were not shared with negative controls. Another faint band was detectable at approximately 37 kDa for SM and porcini varieties. Conclusions: Here, we present the first European case of SM-induced occupational asthma, a disease more frequently occurring in Asia. Asthma attacks stopped when the patient avoided contact with shiitake mushrooms. No skin reactions and no IgE-binding proteins by immunoblotting were detectable with the other mushrooms tested. The positive skin test with shiitake mushrooms and IgE-binding components in the shiitake extract confirmed the IgE-mediated etiology of the reaction...|$|R
