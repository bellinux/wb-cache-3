Canopus was fitted for sea at Devonport in May 1834, and {{underwent}} further repairs between December 1839 and May 1842. She was prepared for sea again in early 1845, spending time under the command of Fairfax Moresby, before being laid up at Devonport in 1848. She was fitted <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>as</b> a receiving ship between June and October 1862, and served as a tender to , the Devonport guardship. Canopus became a mooring hulk in 1869, with her masts being removed in April 1878. She was finally sold after 89 years service with the Royal Navy in October 1887 to J. Pethick, and was broken up.|$|E

500|$|Southerton's tour report {{refers to}} the crowds' {{reactions}} to the England team, and in particular to the [...] "barracking" [...] of Larwood. This, he says, only once reached unacceptable proportions—during the game against Victoria that took place between {{the fourth and fifth}} Tests. This disturbance was apparently sparked by Chapman's decision to put Larwood on to bowl against Victoria's weakest batsman, Bert Ironmonger. In general, Southerton felt that crowd noise was no worse than that accorded to previous touring teams and that, [...] "objectionable though it may appear to be to us in England, it has grown up with Australian cricket and is recognised by the public <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>as</b> part of their day's enjoyment". Larwood's view was that [...] "it was a bit too thick at times... I got called every name you can imagine, and every four-letter word you can think of was used against me". The Surrey amateur batsman Douglas Jardine, was likewise a target of the crowds, and as a result formed a cordial dislike for Australians—which was fully reciprocated.|$|E
500|$|In late 2011, Yusef {{manages to}} win his former wife back. They later make plans to get married. Nina Wadia {{explains}} why Zainab is willing to forgive Yusef. Wadia said to Inside Soap: [...] "He tells Zainab that {{he was forced to}} start the fire by his family. Yusef goes on to explain that he knew it was wrong the minute he lit the match, and that he ran into the house to save her. And {{by the end of this}} conversation, she finds herself saying to him, 'Let's get married' - regardless! Obviously, it was something I struggled to get my head around. But being burnt in that fire is what they both have in common - and that experience connects them so deeply. She recognises that he made a mistake but also decides that the whole thing was probably her fault, because she walked out on their marriage." [...] Wadia continued: [...] "It doesn't look like Zainab's going to listen. But as Denise leaves, it's clear she's torn about what to do." [...] A short time before their wedding day arrives, Yusef starts to abuse Zainab both physically and mentally. He forbids Zainab to leave the house and later starts using her son, Kamil, to control her. Wadia explains that she wants the storyline to have a positive impact against real-life violence. She told BBC News :"I think the idea behind showing a strong woman like Zainab changing like this is to show that it can happen to even the strongest of women. They can change and they can be manipulated - especially if they're isolated from their friends and family. The manipulator can take advantage, so it's to prove that it can even happen to people like her. To be honest, if even one woman rings that Action Line at the end of the show and there's some difference made to her life, I'll feel like we've done our job," [...] she continued. [...] "It is a serious issue and I'm glad it's being highlighted. I hope that it wakes anyone up - not just women, I know that there are abused men <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>as</b> well. So if it gives anyone the strength to leave a relationship like that, we'll have done our job." [...] The scenes where Yusef refused to let Zainab see Kamil pulled in 8.69m viewers at 7.30pm. BBC Three's repeat of the episode later secured 994k viewers at 10pm.|$|E
2500|$|In Bohm's quantum mechanics, the {{particle}} obeys classical mechanics except that its movement takes {{place under the}} additional influence of its quantum potential. A photon or an electron has a definite trajectory and passes through {{one or the other}} of the two slits and not both, just as it is in the case of a classical particle. The past is determined and stays what it was up to the moment T1 when the experimental configuration for detecting it as a wave was changed to that of detecting a particle at the arrival time T2. At T1, when the experimental set up was changed, [...] Bohm's quantum potential changes as needed, and {{the particle}} moves classically under the new quantum potential till T2 when it is detected as a particle. Thus Bohmian mechanics restores the conventional view of the world and its past.

2500|$|As Finkielsztejn writes – on 6 July 1941 the Jews {{who escaped}} from Wąsosz {{arrived in the}} {{neighboring}} town of Radziłów, {{but the next day}} pogrom broke <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>as</b> well. According to his deposition 1,500 local and refugee Jews were burned there in a barn. However, there's also an early Polish monument on the outskirts of Radziłów which reads, [...] "In August 1941 fascists murdered 800 persons of Jewish descent , 500 of them were burned alive in a barn." [...] The date on the monument is incorrect but historical research confirms that Jews were killed in Radziłów on 7 July how many, and under what circumstances, remains unknown. The pages from Finkielsztejn's paper describing the actual pogrom vanished from the Jewish Historical Institute of Warsaw in the following years. According to the remaining page, the Germans found later, that allegedly only fifteen Jews were left alive in Wąsosz. The Jews stayed in the town until June 1942 under the supervision of German gendarmerie who [...] "behaved properly" [...] (whatever it means); and were used by the Nazis for forced labor purposes. Finkielsztejn insisted that all criminals were Polish, even those who had Russian names, or were driving German tanks, while armed to their teeth by the Gestapo. His paper ends there. In November 1942 the survivors were moved to the Bogusze transit camp and in January 1943 sent to Majdanek or Treblinka extermination camps.|$|E

All men need to look after their health and take advantage of the services and help that is <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> <b>as</b> we all do.

The event offered opportunities for men to have health checks with experienced staff from Action Cancer, and speakers such as Ken Harland (University of Ulster's Centre of Young Men's studies), Peter Mc Donald, a senior child care worker from Giggles Daycare nursery, and local athlete Ronan Murtagh shared their own insight into the choices young men make and the opportunities that are out there for young men today.
