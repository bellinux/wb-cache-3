5|$|In 1939 the {{employees}} at the PRR's Altoona, Pennsylvania, workshops built an <b>operable</b> replica of the locomotive for further exhibition duties, as the Smithsonian desired to keep the original locomotive in a more controlled environment. After being on static display for the next 42 years, the Smithsonian commemorated the locomotive's 150th birthday in 1981 by firing it up, making it the world's oldest surviving <b>operable</b> steam locomotive. Today, the original John Bull is on static display once more in the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C. The replica John Bull is preserved at the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|September 15, 1981: The John Bull {{operates}} in Washington, D.C., on the 150th anniversary {{of its first}} use, becoming the oldest <b>operable</b> steam locomotive (and oldest self-propelled vehicle) in the world.|$|E
5|$|For {{surgical}} cases, {{the odds}} of cure {{vary depending on the}} tumor location and whether the tumor can be completely, or only partially, removed. Distal cholangiocarcinomas (those arising from the common bile duct) are generally treated surgically with a Whipple procedure; long-term survival rates range from 15%–25%, although one series reported a five-year survival of 54% for patients with no involvement of the lymph nodes. Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (those arising from the bile ducts within the liver) are usually treated with partial hepatectomy. Various series have reported survival estimates after surgery ranging from 22%–66%; the outcome may depend on involvement of lymph nodes and completeness of the surgery. Perihilar cholangiocarcinomas (those occurring near where the bile ducts exit the liver) are least likely to be <b>operable.</b> When surgery is possible, they are generally treated with an aggressive approach often including removal of the gallbladder and potentially part of the liver. In patients with <b>operable</b> perihilar tumors, reported 5-year survival rates range from 20%–50%.|$|E
5|$|The GCV {{was to be}} <b>operable</b> {{with the}} current battle command control and {{communications}} suite but would gradually use a more state-of-the-art networked integration system known as the BCT Network. It would provide exportable electrical power, and a battery charging capability for external hardware including vehicles and electronics from the BCT Soldier subsystems. The system {{would be capable of}} integration with unmanned systems and dismounted soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The {{line has}} six steam {{locomotives}} for passenger trains and four diesel locomotives, which are primarily used for shunting and to haul works trains. It is unusual for all steam locomotives to be <b>operable</b> {{at the same}} time, as at least one is normally scheduled for overhaul. The railway also owns 23carriages and vans, including all of the original carriages and the brake van built for the railway.|$|E
5|$|North Korean airpower {{ceased to}} resist UN forces after July 20, except for {{isolated}} engagements. On August 5 and 6 the final airstrikes against {{the remainder of}} North Korean aircraft at the Pyongyang airfields destroyed another 18 combat aircraft and seven more were damaged. By this point the North Korean Air Force was considered to have been destroyed, losing 110 aircraft and only possessing 35, with only 18 <b>operable.</b> Through August and September, the North Koreans could only muster at most 16 sorties a day, most by isolated, single aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) main camera primary {{electronics}} {{failed in}} June 2006, {{and the power}} supply for the backup electronics failed on January 27, 2007. Only the instrument's Solar Blind Channel (SBC) was <b>operable</b> using the side-1 electronics. A new power supply for the wide angle channel was added during SM 4, but quick tests revealed this did not help the high resolution channel. The Wide Field Channel (WFC) was returned to service by STS-125 in May 2009 but the High Resolution Channel (HRC) remains offline.|$|E
5|$|The Army {{wanted the}} vehicle to feature a commander’s weapons station, autocannon, coaxial weapon, and an {{anti-tank}} guided missile system. The weapons suite had to be manually <b>operable</b> when damaged and the commander's weapon station had to incorporate a shield. Additionally, a dismountable anti-armor weapon would be carried on board. The Army also stated that the weapon suite would emphasize modularity, be able to defeat other IFVs, and provide non-lethal capability to enable use in civilian environments.|$|E
5|$|The PRR again {{borrowed}} the locomotive from 1933 to 1934 for the Century of Progress exhibition in Chicago. Unlike its earlier jaunt to Chicago, for this trip, the railroad hauled and displayed it as a static exhibit. While this exhibit was progressing, the Altoona Works were busy again building a replica; {{this time the}} replica was an <b>operable</b> copy of the locomotive. The replica was then operated in 1940 at the New York World's Fair, while the original locomotive and rebuilt tender returned to the Smithsonian.|$|E
5|$|The {{crew was}} ordered to abandon ship after about forty minutes of the {{bombardment}} using the only remaining <b>operable</b> motor lifeboat of the three stowed on board. One officer and four enlisted men were injured, {{but no one was}} killed. The Turks continued their bombardment for five hours until Ben-my-Chree listed to starboard and sank in shallow water. Later in the day, the captain and the chief engineer returned to the wreck to rescue the ship's mascots, a cat and dog which had both survived the attack.|$|E
5|$|The nominal 250 MW solar {{electric}} generating facility generates steam {{in solar}} steam generators, which will expand through a {{steam turbine generator}} to produce electrical power from twin, independently <b>operable</b> solar fields, each feeding a 125 MW power island. The plant should generate 617,000 MWh of power annually, enough power for more than 88,000 households and will prevent the emission of over 430 kilotons of CO2 a year. Pacific Gas & Electric has agreed to a 25-year power purchase agreement.|$|E
5|$|The {{protection}} of infrastructure {{must also be}} considered within emergency preparedness. Critical facilities that need to remain <b>operable</b> should be identified, and all others should be shut down to reduce damage. It is also important to keep ash out of buildings, machinery and lifeline networks (in particular water and wastewater systems,) to prevent some of the damage caused by ash particles. Windows and doors should be closed and shuttered if possible, to prevent ingress of ash into buildings.|$|E
5|$|Communications {{with the}} outside world went through a single Forest Service line until April 1943, when it was {{replaced}} by five Army telephone lines. This was increased to eight in March 1945. There were also three teletypewriters with encoding machines. The first was installed in March 1943, and two more were added in May 1943. One was removed in November 1945. There were telephones in the offices, but none in private residences, as the Army regarded this as a security hazard. There were some public phones in the township for emergencies. Since {{there was no way to}} prevent the lines being tapped, classified information could not be discussed over the phone lines. Initially the phone lines were <b>operable</b> only during business hours until enough WACs arrived to man the switchboard around the clock.|$|E
5|$|Many {{superficial}} inspections {{were performed}} on the locomotive in 1980 and it {{was found to be}} in relatively sound mechanical condition. There wasn't a significant amount of deterioration noted in these early inspections, and when the wheels were jacked off the rails, as they had been 50 years earlier, the axles were found to be freely <b>operable.</b> One morning in January 1980, before the museum opened to the public, museum officials used compressed air to power the cylinders and move the wheels through the connecting rods {{for the first time since}} its last semi-operation. After the compressed air blew some dirt and debris out of the locomotive's exhaust stack, it was soon running smoothly.|$|E
5|$|Plans for an Airbus A320 family {{aircraft}} {{assembly plant}} in Mobile were formally announced by Airbus CEO Fabrice Brégier from the Mobile Convention Center on July 2, 2012. The plans include a $600 million factory at the Brookley Aeroplex for {{the assembly of}} the A319, A320 and A321 aircraft. It was planned to employ up roughly 1,000 full-time workers when fully operational. Construction began with a groundbreaking ceremony on April 8, 2013, with it becoming <b>operable</b> by 2015 and producing up to 50 aircraft per year by 2017. The assembly plant is the company's first factory to be built within the United States. It was announced on February 1, 2013 that Airbus had hired Alabama-based Hoar Construction to oversee construction of the facility.|$|E
5|$|Powered winches {{were used}} on cargo ships {{to speed the}} {{handling}} of heavy loads. One winch was operated {{at each of the}} ship's five cargo holds. During loading operations, the winches were worked hard, requiring steady maintenance to remain <b>operable.</b> Winch brakesa safety feature provided for stopping the load from falling if the winch's main power was lostwere not often used by a skilled winch operator, as the load could be more quickly maneuvered using various power settings than by application of the brakes. Disused brakes sometimes seized up and stopped working. The winches on the SS E. A. Bryan were steam-powered and showed signs of wear, even though the ship was only five months old.|$|E
5|$|Skyscraper {{development}} paused {{during the}} years of the Second World War. Once development began again in the 1950s and 1960s, the skyscraper entered a different phase of development, usually called the international or modern period. Some experimental designs in this style had been built in the U.S. using European architectural concepts in the early 1930s, most notably the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society and McGraw-Hill Buildings. Post-war, their modernist themes were used in a new generation of skyscrapers. These stood alone on individual plots in the fashion of the Rockefeller Centre's RCA building, rather than as part of a row of buildings, forming huge slabs and towers featuring huge glass façades, breaking with earlier skyscraper traditions. Inside, new technologies such as fluorescent lighting and widespread air-conditioning meant that many older architectural features such as light courts and <b>operable</b> windows were unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|XXBomber Command's {{attacks on}} Singapore {{produced}} mixed results. The raids on Singapore Naval Base {{damaged or destroyed}} many workshops and denied the Japanese {{the use of the}} King GeorgeVI Graving Dock between late 1944 and early 1945, and the AdmiraltyIX Dry Dock from February 1945. In addition, workers at the Naval Base did not return to work for some time after each raid, and had to be provided with better pay and rations and additional air-raid shelters. Although the damage inflicted on the Empire Docks area impeded Japanese port operations, the poor condition of the port area also hindered British efforts to rehabilitate Singapore following the war. The attacks on the oil storage tanks on islands near Singapore were less successful, and many were found to still be <b>operable</b> after the Japanese surrender.|$|E
5|$|After her refit was {{completed}} on 18 January 1944, Steinbrinck {{and her sister}} Theodor Riedel spent {{the first half of}} the year laying minefields at the entrance to the Skaggerak and escorting convoys to and from Norway. On 3 May the ship passed through the Kiel Canal en route to Hamburg for a lengthy refit. While in the dockyard, she was struck by a bomb in the diesel generator room on 18 June. Despite the extent of the damage, the dockyard reported that her refit would be completed as scheduled on 20 November. On 4 November another bomb detonated alongside Steinbrinck and caused extensive flooding and shock damage from the explosion. The ship was patched up and towed to Wesermünde for more thorough repairs, but her completion was seriously delayed. By 1 April 1945, only a single engine was <b>operable</b> and the Kriegsmarine made the decision to strip her crew for combat duties ashore after she was moved to Cuxhaven. She was still there in May when the Germans surrendered.|$|E
5|$|Archival {{data of the}} II SS-Panzer Corps {{shows that}} the corps had 294 <b>operable</b> tanks and assault guns {{on the evening of}} 11 July, and 251 on the evening of 13 July. Allowing for the {{possibility}} that some repaired tanks were returned to service on 13 July, these numbers indicate that at least 43 tanks and assault guns became inoperable during this period, which includes all ten Tigers belonging to Totenkopf and one belonging to Leibstandarte. An estimated total of 60–80 tanks and assault guns of the II SS-Panzer Corps were damaged or destroyed in combat on 12 July. By the end of 16 July, the II SS-Panzer Corps had 292 serviceable tanks and assault guns, almost the same number it had {{at the beginning of the}} battle on 12 July. On 12 July, Schlachtgeschwader 1 of the 8th Air Corps and its attached squadron of Stukas reported 11 aircraft damaged, all by Soviet anti-aircraft artillery, of which 6 were total write-offs.|$|E
5|$|In {{boiler room}} No.4, at around 01:20, water began {{flooding}} in from below, possibly {{indicating that the}} bottom of the ship had also been holed by the iceberg. The flow of water soon overwhelmed the pumps and forced the firemen and trimmers to evacuate the forward boiler rooms. Further aft, Chief Engineer William Bell, his engineering colleagues, and a handful of volunteer firemen and greasers stayed behind in the unflooded No.1, 2 and 3 boiler rooms and in the turbine and reciprocating engine rooms. They continued working on the boilers and the electrical generators {{in order to keep the}} ship's lights and pumps <b>operable</b> and to power the radio so that distress signals could be sent. They remained at their posts until the very end, thus ensuring that Titanics electrics functioned until the final minutes of the sinking. None of the ship's 35 engineers and electricians survived. Neither did any of the Titanics five postal clerks, who were last seen struggling to save the mail bags they had rescued from the flooded mail room. They were caught by the rising water somewhere on D deck.|$|E
5|$|In counterattacks {{against the}} KPAF, the UN responded on July 15 with {{an attack on}} Kimpo, {{destroying}} {{two or three of}} the seven Yak-7s there and damaging the runway at the airfield. On July 18, Task Force 77 attacked Pyongyang and Pyongyang East Airfields, destroying 14 North Korean aircraft and damaging 13 more. The next day, Task Force 77 attacked Yonpo and destroyed 15 more North Korean aircraft there, and three more at Sondok. That day near Pyonggang F-80s of the 8th Fighter-Bomber Group destroyed another 14 North Korean fighters and one bomber, and damaging seven others. On July 20, another strike by 14 B-29s destroyed the runways at Pyongyang and Onjong-ni. In the process of these strikes, the UN aircraft also shot down six North Korean aircraft opposing the attacks. By {{the end of the day}} on July 20, only 65 of the KPAF 1st Air Division's original aircraft were intact, and only 34 of them were <b>operable.</b>|$|E
5|$|Stations in Paradip and Bhubaneswar each {{recorded}} sustained {{winds of}} 150km/h (90mph) before their instruments failed. Winds of 175km/h (110mph) were measured in Puri as the cyclone {{passed to the}} north. The strong winds damaged electric lines and uprooted trees over 50years old in Puri and Kendrapada. Downed power lines across the state cut off communications between Odisha {{and the rest of}} the world for over 24hours and caused widespread power outages. According to the Southern Electricity Supply Corporation, damage to the power grid caused by the cyclone totaled ₹330million (US$4.4million). Stalling over land, the Odisha cyclone dropped torrential rainfall, with 24-hour rainfall rates at times exceeding 20cm (7.9in); Paradip documented 53cm (20.9in) over one 24-hour period. Over the course of the storm's passage, total rainfall amounts over 60cm (23.6in) occurred over a large swath of Odisha. The highest recorded rainfall total was documented in Oupada, which measured 95.5cm (37.60in) of rain over a three-day period. Flooding caused by the storm was estimated to have killed approximately 2,000people. The heavy rains flattened thatched huts and damaged roads and other infrastructure. Within the seven worst affected districts, over 70%of homes were destroyed; most of these were thatched homes, though 10–15%of non-thatch roofed homes were also destroyed. Approximately 11,000schools were either significantly damaged or destroyed. All major district roads in the area were either washed out or blocked by felled trees. In Bhubaneswar, 60%of trees were flattened by the winds and rain; aerial surveys revealed that the entire city was submerged by floodwaters. Adjacent areas were nearly stripped of all tree cover. Until 8November, the city remained without power. The inundation induced by the far-reaching storm surge and heavy rain kept Konark submerged in knee-deep water for six days after landfall. Over the course of four days, the excessive rainfall caused the flooding of the Baitarani, Brahmani, Budhabalanga, Kharasua, and Salandi rivers, resulting in 20,005flood embankment breaches and the damaging of 6headworks. Thousands of people suffered chemical burns after the flooding mixed industrial chemicals into bathing ponds. Oswal Chemicals and Fertilisers, which maintained the world's largest diammonium phosphate plant, reported severe damage to the facility. In the five Odishan districts most affected, all electric water pumps were disabled, though hand pumps remained <b>operable.</b>|$|E
