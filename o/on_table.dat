5|$|By this time, cricket {{had been}} {{introduced}} to India, North America and the West Indies but the first definite references occur in the 18th century. In 1709, cricket was played by William Byrd of Westover on his James River estates in Virginia, then a British colony. This is the earliest reference to cricket being played in the New World. There had not been any English colonisation of Australasia or southern Africa, where Test cricket is played now, by 1725. Australia and New Zealand had been partly explored by Abel Tasman in the 1640s but still had only their Aboriginal and Maori inhabitants respectively. The first European settlement in South Africa was founded on Tuesday, 6 April 1652 when the Dutch East India Company established Cape Colony <b>on</b> <b>Table</b> Bay, near present-day Cape Town.|$|E

The top two conference winners, based <b>on</b> <b>table</b> points, receive first-round byes. In {{the first round of}} the finals, the third conference winner is the #3 seed and hosts the wild card team with the worst record, and the best wild card team hosts the second-best wild card team. In the semi-finals, the #2 conference winner hosts the higher surviving seed from the first round, and the #1 conference winner hosts the other first-round winner. The final is hosted by the top remaining seed.|$|E
25|$|Further {{expansion}} of the competition in 2016 to 18 teams, with one extra entry from South Africa and new teams based in Argentina and Japan, saw the playoff bracket expand to eight teams. The teams were split into African and Australasian groups, with the Argentine and Japanese teams joining the African group. Each group in turn was divided into two conferences (Australia, New Zealand, Africa 1, Africa 2). Conference winners received the top four playoff seeds, and were joined by the top three remaining Australasian teams and the top remaining team from the African group <b>on</b> <b>table</b> points, again without regard to conference affiliation. The higher seed still hosted all playoff matches, including the final.|$|E

25|$|And on an {{absolute}} basis, based <b>on</b> <b>Table</b> II.B.1 and IV.C.1 of the 2016 Medicare Trustees report, in 2015 the Medicare Trustees spent 4% less on Medicare Advantage and other Part C beneficiaries per person {{than they did}} per person on Medicare beneficiaries under FFS Medicare. In 2014 the difference in parity on {{an absolute}} basis was 2% less per person on Part C of Medicare based on the Medicare Trustees report in 2015. It appears that after using a formula that was too restrictive in 1997 when Part C was formalized and too generous in 2006 when Medicare +Choice became Medicare Advantage, the Trustees have now found a formula that delivers on the original cost-saving promise of Managed Medicare.|$|E
25|$|By {{elevating}} head-to-head results (rule i) above points difference (rule ii), {{a notable}} difference is created to other sports competitions, in which points difference usually determines rank for teams {{with the same}} number of match points (table points). These rules allowed the winners of Pools A, B and C to be determined by the results of the third pool matches on the weekend of 22 and 23 September. Although other teams could theoretically draw level <b>on</b> <b>table</b> points with South Africa, Australia and New Zealand and exceed their points differences {{at the end of the}} pool stages, head-to-head results by that time ensured these teams could be declared winners of their respective pools, with a match to spare. This also illustrates the fact that the pool tables do not tell the whole story.|$|E
25|$|Table Mountain is {{also home}} to porcupines, mongooses, snakes, lizards, tortoises, and a rare endemic species of {{amphibian}} that is only found <b>on</b> <b>Table</b> Mountain, the Table Mountain ghost frog. The last lion in the area was shot circa 1802. Leopards persisted on the mountains until perhaps the 1920s but are now extinct locally. Two smaller, secretive, nocturnal carnivores, the rooikat (caracal) and the vaalboskat (also called the vaalkat or Southern African wildcat) were once common in the mountains and the mountain slopes. The rooikat continues to be seen on rare occasions by mountaineers but the status of the vaalboskat is uncertain. The mountain cliffs are home to several raptors species, apart from the Verreaux's eagle. They include the jackal buzzard, booted eagle (in summer), African harrier-hawk, peregrine falcon and the rock kestrel. In 2014 three pairs of African fish eagles were believed to be breeding on the Peninsula, but they nest in trees generally as far away from human habitation as is possible on the Peninsula. Their number in 2017 is unknown.|$|E

25|$|European {{colonisation}} {{of southern}} Africa began on Tuesday 6 April 1652 when the Dutch East India Company established a settlement called the Cape Colony <b>on</b> <b>Table</b> Bay, near present-day Cape Town, {{and continued to}} expand into the hinterland through the 17th and 18th centuries. It was founded as a victualling station for the Dutch East Indies trade route but soon acquired an importance of its own due to its good farmland and mineral wealth. There was no significant British interest in South Africa until 1795, when British troops under Sir James Craig seized Cape Colony during the French Revolutionary War, the Netherlands having fallen to Napoleon the same year. After the British seized Cape Colony a second time in 1806 to counteract French {{interests in the region}} {{in the course of the}} Napoleonic Wars, Cape Colony was turned into a permanent British settlement. As in most other parts of the world, British colonization brought in its wake the introduction of the game of cricket, which began to develop rapidly. The first ever recorded cricket match in South Africa took place in 1808, in Cape Town between two service teams for a prize of one thousand rix-dollars.|$|E
500|$|Kinman was {{involved}} with the Wiyot people who lived <b>on</b> <b>Table</b> Bluff, near his farm. The Wiyot continue to live <b>on</b> <b>Table</b> Bluff on a small rancheria or reservation. The key event in Wiyot history was the February 25–26, 1860 Wiyot Massacre on Indian Island, when over one hundred Wiyot were murdered in their sleep. At {{the same time there}} were massacres of the Wiyot at other sites, possibly including Table Bluff. Kinman has not been specifically identified as one of the murderers. Nevertheless, in May 1860 he was elected to represent Bear River at a county-wide meeting ostensibly called to discuss ways to protect white settlers from the Indians. In 1864 he scouted for Captain William Hull's California Volunteers, which according to Kinman, [...] "slaughtered and captured Indians, and at one time they took as many as 160 captives to Fort Humboldt." ...|$|E

(It spent $17,000 a month <b>on</b> <b>table</b> linens). The Washington Post's Phyllis Richman claimed the combination of superb hamburgers with seasonal foods (fresh Alaskan halibut during three weeks, {{corn on the cob}} in the summer, locally grown vegetables and berries) was what drew customers.

The school was opened in 1936 by Adolf Hitler and would use the regular army training methods and used former army officers as instructors to train their potential officers to be combat effective. Because of their backgrounds, some of the cadets required basic training in non-military matters. The cadets were issued books on etiquette that contained instructions <b>on</b> <b>table</b> manners [...] "Cutlery is held only in the fingers and not with the whole hand" [...] and even the correct way to close a letter [...] "Heil Hitler! yours sincerely XXXX". Instruction was also given on Nazi ideology during lectures, {{with a mixture of}} athletics and military field exercises.|$|E
2500|$|Each of {{the main}} {{branches}} of the River Avoca – the Avonmore, the Avonbeg and the Aughrim rivers – have their origins in smaller tributaries, many of which rise in the Wicklow Mountains. The Glenealo, Glendasan and Annamoe rivers meet to form the Avonmore near Laragh. The Annamoe rises near Sally Gap and is joined by Cloghoge Brook between Lough Tay and Lough Dan and by the River Inchavore in Lough Dan. The Avonbeg rises <b>on</b> <b>Table</b> Mountain and the Three Lakes. The Avonmore and Avonbeg rivers join to form the River Avoca at the Meeting of the Waters in the Vale of Avoca, celebrated in the song The Meeting of the Waters by Thomas Moore.
