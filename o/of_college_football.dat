Both teams' defenses were ranked towards the bottom <b>of</b> <b>college</b> <b>football.</b> Consequently, the game was widely expected to be high-scoring.|$|E

5|$|Media {{and fans}} <b>of</b> <b>college</b> <b>football</b> {{consider}} the UT program {{one of the}} great powerhouses of the game because of the school's winning record as well as their previous national championships in 1963, 1969 and 1970. From 1936 to 2004, the team finished the season in the top ten team of the Associated Press Poll 23 times, or one-third of the time. At the start of the 2005 season, the Longhorns were one of the most victorious programs in college football history; they were third in total victories and fourth if measured by winning percentage.|$|E

5|$|While Bobby Dodd was a {{determined}} competitor, he cared deeply {{for those who}} played for him.

As a testament to the character of Bobby Dodd, each year a Division I college coach whose team excels on the field, in the classroom, and in the community is awarded the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award, presented by the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Foundation.|$|E

5|$|Adams {{went on to}} play {{four seasons}} <b>of</b> <b>college</b> <b>football</b> with the Eastern Kentucky Colonels, {{a member of the}} Division I Football Championship Subdivision (then known as Division I-AA). Starting in 33 games, Adams {{received}} several accolades while playing for the Colonels, including being named a Division I-AA third team All-American, a two-time first team All-Conference player, and a second team All-Conference player. In September 2002, he was selected as the Ohio Valley Conference Defensive Player of the Week for his effort in a game against the Florida Atlantic Owls, where he made 5 total tackles and repeatedly pressured the quarterback (including for one sack). Adams continued his successful senior year by recording 81 defensive tackles and five sacks.|$|E
5|$|Among {{defensive}} players, Florida State safety Nick Moody had 12tackles, {{the most}} in the game. Virginia Tech's leading defensive player was safety Eddie Whitley, who had ninetackles and two pass breakups. Tech's Davon Morgan and Jeron Gouveia-Winslow were responsible for the only turnovers in the game; each had one interception. Gouveia-Winslow’s 24-yard interception return for a touchdown was the second such score in an ACC Championship Game. On {{the opposite side of the}} ball, Nigel Bradham's defensive two-point conversion was only the fifth in all <b>of</b> <b>college</b> <b>football</b> during the 2010 season. Florida State received no penalties during the game, and Virginia Tech received only four. The fourpenalties were the fewest in an ACC Championship Game.|$|E
5|$|As it grew {{beyond its}} {{regional}} affiliations in the 1930s, college football garnered increased national attention. Four new bowl games were created: the Orange Bowl, Sugar Bowl, the Sun Bowl in 1935, and the Cotton Bowl in 1937. In lieu {{of an actual}} national championship, these bowl games, along with the earlier Rose Bowl, provided a way to match up teams from distant {{regions of the country}} that did not otherwise play. In 1936, the Associated Press began its weekly poll of prominent sports writers, ranking all of the nation's college football teams. Since there was no national championship game, {{the final version of the}} AP poll was used to determine who was crowned the National Champion <b>of</b> <b>college</b> <b>football.</b>|$|E

5|$|College {{football}} {{maintained a}} tradition of postseason bowl games. Each bowl game {{would be associated with}} a particular conference, and earning a spot in a bowl game was the reward for winning a conference. This arrangement was profitable, but it tended to prevent the two top-ranked teams from meeting in a true national championship game, as they would normally be committed to the bowl games of their respective conferences. Several systems have been used since 1992 to determine a national champion <b>of</b> <b>college</b> <b>football.</b> The first was the Bowl Coalition, in place from 1992 to 1994. This was replaced in 1995 by the Bowl Alliance, which gave way in 1997 to the Bowl Championship Series (BCS). The BCS arrangement proved to be controversial, and was replaced in 2014 by the College Football Playoff (CFP).|$|E
5|$|Junkin played {{four years}} <b>of</b> <b>college</b> <b>football</b> at Duke University. In the 1987 NFL Draft, the Cleveland Browns traded up to select {{him with the}} fifth overall pick.

Junkin was then traded to the Kansas City Chiefs for a fifth-round {{selection}} and played in five more games. After his release from the Chiefs, he did not play another game in the NFL. His failure to establish himself in the NFL has caused him {{to be regarded as}} a draft bust.|$|E
5|$|LSU and Alabama {{first met}} on the field in 1895, and have met {{annually}} since 1964. When former LSU head coach Nick Saban was hired in the same capacity at Alabama, their annual contest became, arguably, an even more heated rivalry than before. At {{the start of the}} 2011 season, Alabama was ranked No.2 and LSU was ranked No.4 in all of the major college polls, and prior to their annual meeting, each team defeated all eight of their opponents, and LSU moved into the No.1 spot after a victory over West Virginia. Statistically, the game matched two of the top defenses in both the SEC and all <b>of</b> <b>college</b> <b>football.</b>|$|E

Before the 2008 season, the Bearcats hoped quarterback Ben Mauk would be allowed to play an unusual sixth year <b>of</b> <b>college</b> <b>football,</b> a possibility created by a year lost to injury and a redshirt year. After Mauk's request was denied by the NCAA, the annual poll of media covering Big East football picked Cincinnati to finish fifth in the eight-team Big East.|$|E
5|$|The {{stay at the}} top was short-lived.

Texas and USC won the rest of their games and faced each other in the National Championship, which Texas won41–38. This was only the 35thmeeting of the twotop-ranked teams in the history <b>of</b> <b>college</b> <b>football,</b> including both regular season and bowl games. The BCS system now ensures that the twotop teams in the BCS rankings face each other annually in a national championship game, but the methodology for ranking the teams remains controversial among fans and sportswriters.|$|E

5|$|On December 10, 1943, SEC {{officials}} met in Nashville in {{an effort}} to bring a full football schedule back for the 1944 season. In order to have enough students eligible to participate on a team, the SEC changed its eligibility restrictions to allow for any civilian to play as long as they had not played four years <b>of</b> <b>college</b> <b>football</b> or professionally. At that time, Alabama along with Tennessee and Vanderbilt indicated they might reform their respective teams and resume conference play for the 1944 season. On January 12, 1944, all SEC members, with the exceptions of Mississippi and Mississippi State, indicated their intent to field football teams the following fall. On May 19, 1944, every SEC school with the exception of Vanderbilt (who fielded an informal team) agreed to play a full conference schedule the following fall.
