5|$|Lincoln Castle is {{bounded by}} a stone curtain wall, with ditches {{on all sides}} except the south. From an early stage, the outer walls which enclose the site were built in stone and they date from before 1115. On the south side the walls are {{interrupted}} by two earthen mounds called mottes. <b>One</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> the south-east corner, and was probably an original feature of William's the Conqueror's castle, while the other occupies the south-west corner. A square tower, the Observatory Tower, stands {{on top of the}} first mound, standing above the outer walls to dominate the city of Lincoln. The second mound is crowned by the 'Lucy Tower', which was probably built in the 12th century and was named after Lucy of Bolingbroke, the Countess of Chester until 1138.|$|E

5|$|On {{occasion}} a Ruisdael changes hands. In 2014, Dunes by the Sea was auctioned at Christie's in New York, and realised a {{price of}} $1,805,000. Of his surviving drawings, 140 in total, the Rijksmuseum, the Teylers Museum in Haarlem, Dresden's Kupferstich-Kabinett, and the Hermitage each hold significant collections. Ruisdael's rare etchings are spread across institutions. No collection holds a print {{of each of the}} thirteen etchings. Of the five unique prints, the British Museum holds two, two are in the Albertina in Vienna, and <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> Amsterdam.|$|E
5|$|Potsherds {{with early}} Tamil writing from the 2nd century BCE {{have been found}} from the north in Poonagari, Kilinochchi District to the south in Tissamaharama. They bore several inscriptions, {{including}} a clan name—vela, a name related to velir from ancient Tamil country. Epigraphic evidence shows people identifying themselves as Damelas or Damedas (the Prakrit word for Tamil people) in Anuradhapura, {{the capital city of}} Rajarata the middle kingdom, and other areas of Sri Lanka as early as the 2nd century BCE. Excavations in the area of Tissamaharama in southern Sri Lanka have unearthed locally issued coins, produced between the 2nd century BCE and the 2nd century CE, some of which carry local Tamil personal names written in early Tamil characters, which suggest that local Tamil merchants were present and actively involved in trade along the southern coast of Sri Lanka by the late classical period. Other ancient inscriptions from the period reference a Tamil merchant, the Tamil householder residing in Ilubharata and a Tamil sailor named Karava. Two of the five ancient inscriptions referring to the Damedas (Tamils) are in Periya Pullyakulam in the Vavuniya District, <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> Seruvavila in Trincomalee District, <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> Kuduvil in Ampara District and <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> Anuradhapura. Mention is made in literary sources of Tamil rulers bringing horses to the island in water craft in the second century BCE, most likely arriving at Kudiramalai. Historical records establish that Tamil kingdoms in modern India were closely involved in the island's affairs from about the 2nd century BCE. Kudiramalai, Kandarodai and Vallipuram served as great northern Tamil capitals and emporiums of trade with these kingdoms and the Romans from the 6th–2nd centuries BCE. The archaeological discoveries in these towns and the Manimekhalai, a historical poem, detail how Nāka-Tivu of Nāka-Nadu on the Jaffna Peninsula was a lucrative international market for pearl and conch trading for the Tamil fishermen.|$|E
5|$|The Stoics {{sought to}} be free of the unruly emotions, which they {{regarded}} as being contrary to nature. The passions or emotions (pathe) are the disturbing element in right judgment. Chrysippus wrote a whole book concerning the therapy of the emotions. The passions are like diseases which depress and crush the soul, thus he sought to eradicate them (apatheia). Wrong judgements turn into passions when they gather an impetus of their own, just as, when one has started running, it is difficult to stop. One cannot hope to eradicate the emotions when <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> the heat of love or anger: this can only be done when one is calm. Therefore, one should prepare in advance, and deal with the emotions in the mind as if they were present. By applying reason to emotions such as greed, pride, or lust, one can understand the harm which they cause.|$|E

The 7th congress <b>was</b> organized <b>in</b> Mexico City <b>in</b> 2003 and <b>was</b> continued with the sessions of 2004 in Lyon, during the 8th Congress of the International Association for Semiotic Studies.

5|$|The {{victims are}} {{informed}} by microcassette recorder that antidotes are hidden throughout the house; <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> the room's safe, and a cryptic clue is provided. Xavier ignores a warning note {{and uses a}} key on the door, which fires a bullet through the peephole and Gus' eye, killing him. They search the house for more antidotes after the room lets them out, with no success: Obi, who is revealed to have helped with the abductions, is forced into a crematory oven to obtain two antidotes inside, but inadvertently activates the trap and is burned to death before the others can save him, destroying the antidotes; In the next room, Xavier throws Amanda into a syringe-filled pit intended for himself, and though {{she is able to}} retrieve the key, he is unable to unlock the steel door behind which the antidote sits before the timer expires and he leaves out of frustration. Throughout the game, they discuss connections between them and determine that each has been jailed before; the sole exception is Daniel, who has nonetheless been arrested before.|$|E
5|$|Tilings with {{translational}} symmetry in {{two independent}} directions {{can be categorized}} by wallpaper groups, of which 17 exist. It has been claimed that all seventeen of these groups are represented in the Alhambra palace in Granada, Spain. Though this is disputed, the variety and sophistication of the Alhambra tilings have surprised modern researchers. Of the three regular tilings two are in the p6m wallpaper group and <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> p4m. Tilings in 2D with translational symmetry in just one direction can be categorized by the seven frieze groups describing the possible frieze patterns. Orbifold notation {{can be used to}} describe wallpaper groups of the Euclidean plane.|$|E
