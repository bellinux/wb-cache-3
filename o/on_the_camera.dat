5|$|Glover {{believes}} Martha influenced Lionel {{to start}} believing that sacrifice {{is necessary to}} make the world a better place. When she leaves at the end of season six, Lionel no longer has that influence. He is constantly battling the dark and light sides of his personality. According to series writer Caroline Dries, the audience never really know his motivations because of this balancing act. Dries said this is embodied when he threatens Lana into marrying Lex, later revealing it was to protect Clark. Glover describes his off-screen relationship with Annette O'Toole the reason Martha and Lionel have such good chemistry. Glover said that when Martha and Lionel are talking to each other it feels as though he and O'Toole are sharing a conversation, and that trust is visualized <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera.</b>|$|E

25|$|Since then, New Zealand {{supporters}} in beige {{have been seen}} at sporting fixtures {{all over the world}} including Rugby Union matches, and the Beige Brigade organise tours to selected major sporting events. The only other overseas Black Caps supporters club is the England-based London New Zealand Cricket Club, notable for their stripped blazers that often appear <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> at Lord's.|$|E
25|$|Thermal {{control is}} {{maintained}} {{through the use}} of radiators, multi-layer insulation, and actively controlled heaters. The spacecraft must provide a benign environment for the instruments and on-board equipment. Two instruments, PFS and OMEGA, have infrared detectors that need to be kept at very low temperatures (about −180°C). The sensors <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> (HRSC) also need to be kept cool. But the rest of the instruments and on-board equipment function best at room temperatures (10–20°C).|$|E
25|$|The invisibility {{effect was}} {{achieved}} by having someone wearing a bright red suit (because it was the farthest opposite of the green of the jungle and {{the blue of the}} sky) the size of the Predator. The red was removed with chroma key techniques, leaving an empty area. The take was then repeated without the actors using a 30% wider lens <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera.</b> When the two takes were combined optically, the jungle from the second take filled in the empty area. Because the second take was filmed with a wider lens, a vague outline of the alien could be seen with the background scenery bending around its shape.|$|E
40|$|An {{overview}} of <b>the</b> Faint Object <b>Camera</b> and its performance {{to date is}} presented. In particular, the detector's efficiency, the spatial uniformity of response, distortion characteristics, detector and sky background, detector linearity, spectrography, and operation are discussed. The effect of the severe spherical aberration of the telescope's primary mirror <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera's</b> point spread function is reviewed, {{as well as the}} impact it has <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera's</b> general performance. <b>The</b> scientific implications of the performance and the spherical aberration are outlined, with emphasis on possible remedies for spherical aberration, hardware remedies, and stellar population studies...|$|R

25|$|There was {{a problem}} facing the crew in the newsroom, however. There was no {{television}} camera in the studio {{at the time as}} the technical crew was working on it. Eventually the camera was retrieved and brought back to the newsroom. Because of the magnitude of the story and the continuous flow of information coming from various sources, time was of the essence and the camera would take at least twenty minutes to become operational under normal circumstances. The decision was made to dispatch Cronkite to the CBS Radio Network booth to report the events and play the audio over the television airwaves while the crew worked <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> {{to see if they could}} get it set up quicker.|$|E
25|$|The next day, at the Simpson house, Marge {{tells the}} {{children}} that the new phone books are here, and they have Bart and Lisa's picture on the front cover. Bart and Lisa come down, only {{to realize that the}} picture on one of the phone books is not the one of the fire on Mt. Springfield; it is actually a photo of baby Bart and Lisa naked on the toilet, causing them to scream in horror. Marge says that the shot was actually in the film <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera,</b> and that since she had taken it, she won the prize for them. Bart and Lisa, after accepting that they will be the laughingstock of the entire town, happily hug their mother. Meanwhile, Barney's confidence and his relationship with Homer are restored, and he looks forward to an alcohol-free future, although he is now addicted to double-tall mocha lattes.|$|E
500|$|... "A Scandal in Belgravia", {{written by}} Steven Moffat and {{directed}} by Paul McGuigan, was first broadcast on 1 January 2012.

500|$|Criticism {{about the}} {{gameplay}} was mixed. Many reviews {{complained that the}} camera was at times frustrating and the Gummi Ship portions were out of place. GameSpot cited [...] "tedious" [...] gameplay and Gummi Ship sections as [...] "pale imitations of the Star Fox series", but stated that the combat was fun, particularly the boss fights. Dengeki Online commented <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> controls, saying that the camera would often run into objects while being rotated by the player. GamePro compared the battle system to [...] "old N64 Zelda games" [...] and had positive comments about Donald and Goofy's artificial intelligence.|$|E
500|$|Starting in 1894, Tesla began {{investigating}} what {{he referred}} to as radiant energy of [...] "invisible" [...] kinds after he had noticed damaged film in his laboratory in previous experiments (later identified as [...] "Roentgen rays" [...] or [...] "X-Rays"). His early experiments were with Crookes tubes, a cold cathode electrical discharge tube. Tesla may have inadvertently captured an X-ray image—predating, by a few weeks, Wilhelm Röntgen's December 1895 announcement {{of the discovery of}} x-rays—when he tried to photograph Mark Twain illuminated by a Geissler tube, an earlier type of gas discharge tube. The only thing captured in the image was the metal locking screw <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> lens.|$|E
500|$|Unlike Pip, the Narissa dragon {{was allowed}} {{to be more of}} a fantasy {{character}} while still looking like a living character and a classic Disney villain. The CG dragon design was loosely based on a traditional Chinese dragon and Susan Sarandon's live-action witch. When filming the scene which sees the transformation of Narissa from a woman into a dragon, a long pole was used to direct the extras eyelines instead of a laser pointer. Set pieces were made to move back and forth in addition to having a computer-controlled lighting setup and a repeatable head <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> that were all synchronized. In the film's final sequence, in which Narissa climbs the Woolworth Building while clutching Robert in her claws, a greenscreen rig was built to hold Patrick Dempsey in order to film his face and movements. The rig was a [...] "puppeteering" [...] approach that involved a robotic arm being controlled by three different floor effects artists.|$|E
50|$|The C was {{replaced}} within {{just a few}} months by the C2, with a geared coupling between the rangefinder and the lens, greatly accelerating focusing and making <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> much more convenient to use. Finally, in 1939 the C3 was introduced, with electrical plugs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> left side for a battery-powered flash, synchronized to the shutter.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{effect of}} the time {{characteristics}} of <b>the</b> Compton <b>camera</b> data acquisition (DAQ) system <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera’s</b> performance has been studied. Methods: The GEANT 4 simulation software was used to simulate radiation transport and interactions with matter. Further investigations were carried out by utilizing straightforward approximations to estimate the charge collection times {{and their relationship to}} finding coincident events, setting thresholds to reject noise, and <b>the</b> resultant impacts <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Compton <b>camera</b> performance. Results: <b>The</b> results show that the time characteristics of <b>the</b> Compton <b>camera</b> DAQ account for about 17 % and 13 % reduction in detection efficiency at 140. 5 keV and 511 keV, respectively, but made no significant difference <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Compton <b>camera</b> resolution. Conclusions: Findings suggest that the detection efficiency of <b>the</b> Compton <b>camera</b> has been overestimated by previous investigators who did not predict count rate losses under clinical conditions...|$|R
500|$|Pete (Pemberton), a new mark, enters, but the prank {{does not}} {{work as well as}} with Tina. Among other problems, Pete swears too much and does not seem {{affected}} by the atmosphere, while cues are missed by the pranksters. Terry is surprised to hear a child's voice during Anne's performance as Madam Talbot, and, backstage, the camera stream is blurry. When [...] "Blue Demon Dwarf" [...] appears, Pete punches him, and the production crew rush in.

Backstage, people wait for the police and ambulance; Terry is worried about his career, Anne wants to get away for some food and Amanda is keen to retrieve props from the corpse, but Pete and Gemma show some remorse. When alone, Terry looks to the camera feed and sees the extra standing in the séance room, and, relieved, runs to see him. Facing away from Terry and speaking in a rasping voice, the figure introduces himself as [...] "Spirit of Little Boy", and talks of a suicide after the embarrassment of wetting himself on television. After speaking to the [...] "boy", Terry believes that he himself is on Scaredy Cam, but no one is watching from backstage. When he touches the figure, the extra collapses, but a child's voice continues to shout. A corpse-like child (Wall) begins to rise from the cot used for Madam Talbot's doll. Backstage, Gemma and a police officer look for Terry. They find him in the séance room; he has wet himself, and insists that he is on Scaredy Cam. The child's face appears <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> feed.|$|E
500|$|In {{the same}} issue in which they {{reviewed}} the game, Next Generation ranked it number 1 on their [...] "Top 100 Games of All Time".

As such, it represents the new high-water mark of both gameplay and graphic sophistication." [...] GameSpot called it one of the 15 most influential games of all time, and rated the Nintendo 64 version a score of 9.4 and the Wii Virtual Console version an 8. Game Informer commented that even a decade later the game still offers hours of entertainment. They also commented <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> system, stating that by present-day standards the camera system [...] "would almost be considered broken". Game Revolution's retrospective review referred to the graphics as [...] "beautiful", but criticized the camera angles, saying [...] "it doesn't work as well as it should". The game placed 6th in Official Nintendo Magazines [...] "100 greatest Nintendo games of all time". In 2009, Game Informer put Super Mario 64 13th on their list of [...] "The Top 200 Games of All Time". Official Nintendo Magazine referred to the game as a [...] "masterpiece of game design", stating that Nintendo was able to take its [...] "number-one 2D franchise and convert it flawlessly into 3D". Michael Grayford of Liquid Entertainment stated he was initially [...] "very turned off" [...] by the openness of the game the first time he played it. Upon playing it later, he was [...] "highly pleased" [...] and stated [...] "each level brought some new unique cool gameplay element and I was never bored". Warren Spector, former lead designer at Ion Storm, stated it was [...] "not possible to squeeze this much gameplay into a single game" [...] and [...] "no game has done a better job of showing goals before they can be attained, allowing players to make a plan and execute on it". He also praised the exploration aspect of the game, commenting that [...] " [...] explore the same spaces several times while revealing something new each time is a revelation".|$|E
