5|$|Both innate and {{adaptive}} immunity {{depend on the}} ability of the immune system to distinguish between self and non-self molecules. In immunology, self molecules are those components of an organism's body that can be distinguished from foreign substances by the immune system.

5|$|Irreversible {{inhibition}} {{is different}} from irreversible enzyme inactivation. Irreversible inhibitors are generally specific for <b>one</b> <b>class</b> of enzyme and do not inactivate all proteins; they do not function by destroying protein structure but by specifically altering the active site of their target. For example, extremes of pH or temperature usually cause denaturation of all protein structure, {{but this is a}} non-specific effect. Similarly, some non-specific chemical treatments destroy protein structure: for example, heating in concentrated hydrochloric acid will hydrolyse the peptide bonds holding proteins together, releasing free amino acids.|$|E

40|$|Research {{on social}} class in higher {{education}} indicates that students with a lower social class background are less integrated in the university setting (Rubin, 2012), have poorer academic outcomes (e. g., Walpole, 2003), and lower expectations of social mobility (Jetten et al., 2008). The novelty of the present research is that students’ social class background was conceptualized {{in terms of a}} collective identity (Ashmore et al., 2004) that may have beneficial consequences. The present research demonstrated that university students’ social class background is a meaningful aspect of the self involving attachment (a sense of belonging to <b>one’s</b> <b>class</b> background), private regard(feeling good about <b>one’s</b> <b>class</b> background), and public regard (perceptions of how much others value <b>one’s</b> <b>class</b> background). On the basis of attachment theory (Mikulincer & Shaver, 2007), it was theorized that students’ attachment to their social class background is a psychological resource that promotes exploration and success, which would be reflected in their greater integration in the university milieu and their greater expectations of upward class mobility via their studies. As expected, in Study 1 (N = 959), working and middle class students’ greater attachment to their class background was associated with greater belonging in the student community as well as with greater expectations of upward mobility. Attachment to <b>one’s</b> <b>class</b> background was distinct from private and public regard for <b>one’s</b> <b>class</b> background, as well as from attachment to parents and friends, and from perceived support from parents. In Studies 2 and 3 (total N = 298), the salience of attachment to and private regard for <b>one’s</b> <b>class</b> background were manipulated. As expected, students in the attachment condition reported greater expectations of mobility relative to students in the private regard condition. The findings are discussed with regards to prior research on social class, the social identity model of identity change, and the origins of attachment to <b>one’s</b> social <b>class</b> background...|$|R

5|$|Genetic {{analysis}} performed since the 1990s has extended {{the understanding of}} the relationship between different organisms. It is now clear the brachiopods do not belong to the Deuterostomata (such as echinoderms and chordates) as was hypothesized earlier, but {{should be included in the}} Protostomia (with mollusks and annelid worms), in a subgroup now called Lophotrochozoa. Although their adult morphology seems rather different, the nucleotid sequence of the 18S rRNA indicates that the horseshoe worms are the closest relatives of the inarticulate brachiopods rather than articulate brachiopods. For now, the weight of evidence is inconclusive as to the exact relations within the inarticulates. Consequently, it has been suggested to included horseshoe worms in the Brachiopoda as a class named Phoronata B.L.Cohen in addition to the Craniata and Lingulata, within the subphylum Linguliformea. The other subphylum Rhynchonelliformea only contains <b>one</b> <b>class,</b> which is subdivided in the orders Rhynchonellida, Terebratulida and Thecideida.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, a {{group of}} {{scientists}} from the CRISM team reported on 9 to 10 different classes of minerals formed in the presence of water. Different types of clays (also called phyllosilicates) were found in many locations. The physilicates identified included aluminum smectite, iron/magnesium smectite, kaolinite, prehnite, and chlorite. Rocks containing carbonate were found around the Isidis basin. Carbonates belong to <b>one</b> <b>class</b> in which life could have developed. Areas around Valles Marineris were found to contain hydrated silica and hydrated sulfates. The researchers identified hydrated sulfates and ferric minerals in Terra Meridiani and in Valles Marineris. Other minerals found on Mars were jarosite, alunite, hematite, opal, and gypsum. Two to five of the mineral classes were formed with the right pH and sufficient water to permit life to grow.|$|E
5|$|Steve Fossett {{was well}} known for his world records and adventures in balloons, sailboats, gliders, and powered aircraft. He was an aviator of {{exceptional}} breadth of experience. He wanted {{to become the first}} person to achieve a solo balloon flight around the world (finally succeeding on his sixth attempt, in 2002, becoming the first person to complete an uninterrupted and unrefueled solo circumnavigation of the world in any kind of aircraft). He set, with co-pilot Terry Delore, 10 of the 21 Glider Open records, including the first 2,000km Out-and-Return, the first 1,500km Triangle and the longest Straight Distance flights. His achievements as a jet pilot in a Cessna Citation X include records for U.S. Transcontinental, Australia Transcontinental, and Round-the-World westbound non-supersonic flights. Prior to Fossett's aviation records, no pilot had held world records in more than <b>one</b> <b>class</b> of aircraft; Fossett held them in four classes.|$|E

5|$|Penrose tilings, {{which use}} two {{different}} quadrilaterals, {{are the best}} known example of tiles that forcibly create non-periodic patterns. They belong to a general class of aperiodic tilings, which use tiles that cannot tessellate periodically. The recursive process of substitution tiling is a method of generating aperiodic tilings. <b>One</b> <b>class</b> that can be generated {{in this way is}} the rep-tiles; these tilings have surprising self-replicating properties. Pinwheel tilings are non-periodic, using a rep-tile construction; the tiles appear in infinitely many orientations. It might be thought that a non-periodic pattern would be entirely without symmetry, but this is not so. Aperiodic tilings, while lacking in translational symmetry, do have symmetries of other types, by infinite repetition of any bounded patch of the tiling and in certain finite groups of rotations or reflections of those patches. A substitution rule, such as can be used to generate some Penrose patterns using assemblies of tiles called rhombs, illustrates scaling symmetry. A Fibonacci word can be used to build an aperiodic tiling, and to study quasicrystals, which are structures with aperiodic order.|$|E
