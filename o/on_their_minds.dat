500|$|Whereas many {{events in}} the war were more bloody for the Israelis, like the {{massacre}} at Kfar Etzion with 150 deaths or {{the one of the}} Mount Scopus with 78, the Battle of Latrun is the event of the war to provoke most rumours, narratives and controversies in Israel. The main reason is that Latrun had still been the mainstay for the road to Jerusalem until the Six-Day War, keeping the Israelis at the margins and having to go round and maintain the town, but struggling to bypass it, which played each day <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>minds.</b> According to Anita Shapira, the primary reason was nothing but people's grievous memories, of David Ben-Gurion and the veterans of the British Armies on one side and former Palmah and Haganah soldiers on the other. In this sphere of influence during the 1970s and in the controversies that continued until the 1980s, the [...] "Strategic Necessity" [...] was said, if it were not done, it would be [...] "Criminal negligence", with a heavy toll on bring in immigrants to the battle, and forging a new founding myth.|$|E

The ARVN {{officers}} had a meeting intended to exile Diệm and Nhu, having promised the Ngô brothers safe passage {{out of the country}} into an [...] "honorable retirement". Not all of the senior officers attended the meeting. General Nguyễn Ngọc Lê strongly lobbied for Diệm's execution. There was no formal vote taken at the meeting, and Lê attracted only minority support. Conein reported that the generals had never indicated that assassination was <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>minds,</b> since an orderly transition of power was a high priority in achieving their ultimate aim of gaining international recognition.|$|E
2500|$|While the {{popularity}} of social networking consistently rises, new uses for the technology are frequently being observed. At the forefront of emerging trends in social networking sites {{is the concept of}} [...] "real-time web" [...] and [...] "location-based". Real-time allows users to contribute contents, which is then broadcast as it is being uploaded—the concept is analogous to live radio and television broadcasts. Twitter set the trend for [...] "real-time" [...] services, wherein users can broadcast to the world what they are doing, or what is <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>minds</b> within a 140-character limit. Facebook followed suit with their [...] "Live Feed" [...] where users' activities are streamed as soon as it happens. While Twitter focuses on words, Clixtr, another real-time service, focuses on group photo sharing wherein users can update their photo streams with photos while at an event. Facebook, however, remains the largest photo sharing site—Facebook application and photo aggregator Pixable estimates that Facebook will have 100 billion photos by Summer 2012. In April, 2012, the image-based social media network Pinterest had become the third largest social network in the United States.|$|E

2500|$|Only around 500 spectators watched Small Heath lose 4–3 to Notts County of the Second Division in a {{friendly}} on a miserably wet day, the small attendance meaning that the home side would have lost money on the arrangement after paying Notts their guarantee. A game of two halves followed at Burnley on Good Friday; playing with the wind, Robertson opened the scoring for the visitors after four minutes and several shots hit the woodwork, but on change of ends Burnley forced the pace and had a goal disallowed before scoring the equaliser. The next day, Sheffield Wednesday took a 3–0 half-time lead playing into the sun and wind. Perhaps with the approaching FA Cup Final <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>minds,</b> they took it easy in the second half, but a weakened Small Heath team, with Fountain, Jones and Pratt replacing Hands, Haddon and Lester, were still unable to score. The Sheffield Independent picked out Leake at centre half as playing excellently, and the full-backs Oliver and Pratt as [...] "safe, but not too speedy". On Easter Monday, a goalless draw at West Bromwich Albion, thanks largely to Joe Fall and his defence, kept Small Heath out of the bottom two places with two games left to play.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the real}} world, Kazuto discovers that 300 SAO players, {{including}} Asuna, remain trapped in their NerveGear. As {{he goes to}} the hospital to see Asuna, he meets Shouzou Yuuki, Asuna's father, who is asked by an associate of his, Nobuyuki Sugou, to make a decision, which Sugou later reveals to be his marriage with Asuna, angering Kazuto. Several months later, he is informed by Agil, another SAO survivor, that a figure similar to Asuna was spotted on [...] "The World Tree" [...] in another VRMMORPG cyberspace called Alfheim Online (ALO). Assisted in-game by his cousin Suguha [...] "Leafa" [...] Kirigaya and Yui, a navigation pixie (originally an AI from SAO), he quickly learns that the trapped players in ALO are part of a plan conceived by Sugou to perform illegal experiments <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>minds.</b> The goal is to create the perfect mind-control for financial gain and to subjugate Asuna, whom he intends to marry in the real world, to assume control of her family's corporation. Kirito eventually stops the experiment and rescues the remaining 300 SAO players, foiling Sugou's plans. Before leaving ALO to see Asuna, Kayaba, who has uploaded his mind to the Internet using an experimental and destructively high-power version of NerveGear at the cost of his life, entrusts Kirito with The Seed – a package program designed to create virtual worlds. Kazuto eventually reunites with Asuna in the real world and The Seed is released onto the Internet, reviving the VRMMORPG industry.|$|E
2500|$|A {{cross-sectional}} {{study was conducted}} in Regina, Saskatchewan in February 2009 at 3 different grocery stores located in 3 different regions that had the same median income before taxes of around $30,000. [...] Of the 211 respondents to the study, most were women who purchased most of the food for their household. When asked how they decide what food to buy, the most important factors were price, nutritional value, and need. When looking at the nutritional facts, however, they indicated that they looked at the ingredients, and neglected {{to pay attention to the}} amount of trans fat. This means that trans fat is not <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>minds</b> unless they are specifically told of it. When asked if they ever heard about trans fat, 98% said, [...] "Yes." [...] However, only 27% said that it was unhealthy. Also, 79% said that they only knew a little about trans fats, and could have been more educated. Respondents aged 41–60 were more likely to view trans fat as a major health concern, compared to ages 18–40. When asked if they would stop buying their favorite snacks if they knew it contained trans fat, most said they would continue purchasing it, especially the younger respondents. Also, of the respondents that called trans fat a major concern, 56% of them still wouldn't change their diet to non-trans fat snacks. This is because taste and food gratification take precedence over perceived risk to health. [...] "The consumption of trans fats and the associated increased risk of CHD is a public health concern regardless of age and socioeconomic status".|$|E
