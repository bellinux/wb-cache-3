Consequently, the hypothesis of a single nationwide business cycle governing labor market dynamics corresponds to a single dynamic factor. Such a finding would also relate to recent literature on US employment data where the importance of a single nationwide cycle is stressed (Hamilton and Owyang 2009).|$|R

50|$|This {{ability to}} {{selectively}} control power factor can be exploited for {{power factor correction}} of the power system to which the motor is connected. Since most power systems of any significant size have a net lagging power factor, the presence of overexcited synchronous motors moves the system's net power factor closer to unity, improving efficiency. Such power-factor correction is usually {{a side effect of}} motors already present in the system to provide mechanical work, although motors can be run without mechanical load simply to provide power-factor correction. In large industrial plants such as factories the interaction between synchronous motors and <b>other,</b> <b>lagging,</b> loads may be an explicit consideration in the plant's electrical design.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a forecasting technique which attempts {{to combine the}} advantages of both time series analysis and multiple regression. In this two-stage technique, an exponentially smoothed moving average model is used to forecast values of the dependent variable and/or selected independent variables as desired. These forecasts, along with data for <b>other</b> (<b>lagged)</b> independent variables, are then used as inputs to a multiple regression program. The observations are selected sequentially by the regression model so that each equation is based only upon data {{which would have been}} available {{at the time of the}} forecast, and the coefficiets of the equation are updated as new information becomes available. The final section of the paper describes a successful application of the two-stage model to a demand deposit forecasting problem. ...|$|R

Secondly, as discussed in the literature review section, the results obtained from this course of research may not have reflected a number of other important and salient features that entrepreneurships and entrepreneurs are hypothetically possessing such as entrepreneurial creativity, effects of information asymmetry, and spatial differences and heterogeneity among groups of different socioeconomic status. This limitation will certainly require further data sampling effort and perhaps more modeling work involving hierarchical data analysis.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Ultrabroadband (UBB) is {{becoming}} increasingly an important techno-economic and policy issue. New advances and greater convergence of wireline and wireless technologies allow for faster communications and more applications which require higher speeds of transmission. Many countries perform relatively well (Japan and Korea) but <b>others</b> <b>lag.</b> Economists, business analysts, policy makers and other stakeholders are interested in knowing the driving forces for UBB deployment and the new applications. Many models are used to forecast the rate of deployment and explain the factors for its widespread acceptance. A review of the recent literature reveals that demand and cost factors affect positively the deployment of broadband (BB) and other related emerging technologies such as UBB. The empirical studies which use the diffusion models to forecast broadband penetration demonstrate that the forecasting capacity of these models is relatively robust...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between trust and household adaptation strategies for a sample of respondents in a Mexican agrarian community. In particular, we analyze how levels of personalized, generalized, and institutionalized trust shape the adaptation strategies of smallholders, and find that households characterized by low levels of generalized and institutionalized trust {{are less likely to}} be involved in a diversified livelihood strategy. Instead, they tend to continue with the traditional activity of maize production. In contrast, high levels of personalized trust are associated with a livelihood strategy that focuses on cattle breeding and pasture growing. We argue that trust explains why some people more readily ‘catch up’ with opportunities created by an expanding market, while <b>others</b> <b>lag</b> behind in poverty. This paper thus seeks to contribute to the debate on the role of trust in economic actions and decision-making processes of smallholders...|$|R
