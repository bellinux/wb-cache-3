5|$|Along the way, Rolling Thunder also fell prey to {{the same}} {{dysfunctional}} managerial attitude as did the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>military</b> effort in Southeast Asia.

5|$|The {{onset of}} World War II caused a massive {{upheaval}} in people's lives as military mobilization engaged millions of men. Women were also {{accepted into the}} military in the U.S. Women's Army Corps (WACs) and U.S. Navy's Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service (WAVES). Unlike processes to screen out male homosexuals, which had been in place since the creation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>military,</b> there were no methods to identify or screen for lesbians; they were put into place gradually during World War II. Despite common attitudes regarding women's traditional roles in the 1930s, independent and masculine women were directly recruited by {{the military in the}} 1940s, and frailty discouraged.|$|E

5|$|Barrel Roll {{was one of}} {{the most}} closely held secrets and one of the most unknown {{components}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>military</b> commitment in Southeast Asia. Due to the ostensible neutrality of Laos, guaranteed by the Geneva Conference of 1954 and 1962, both the U.S. and North Vietnam strove to maintain the secrecy of their operations and only slowly escalated military actions there. As much as both parties would have liked to have publicized their enemy's own alleged violation of the accords, both had more to gain by keeping their own roles quiet. Regardless, by the end of the conflict in 1975, Laos emerged from nine years of war just as devastated as any of the other Asian participants in the Vietnam War.|$|E
5|$|The communists {{moved out}} to take the Plain of Jars again in 1967. Laotian {{victories}} were {{few and far between}} {{and by the end of}} the year the situation had become critical, even with the support provided by the American and Laotian Air Forces. PAVN, having a complete understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>military</b> system, began to attack TACAN facilities. U.S. intelligence indicated that between December 1967 and August 1968, the combined strength of PAVN and Pathet Lao forces increased from about 51,000 to over 110,000. The PAVN contingent comprised an estimated 34,000 combat troops, 6,000 advisors, and 18,000 support troops. On 6 December Lima Site 44 was overrun and on the 25th PAVN forces captured Lima Site 61, the site of a mobile facility. All of these attacks were part of a coordinated effort to reduce the ability of the Americans to strike the communist logistical system during the Tet Offensive.|$|E

Most of the South Vietnamese helicopters were dumped into the ocean to make room on the decks for more aircraft. South Vietnamese fighters and other small planes also landed on American carriers.|$|E

25|$|The United States {{expedition}} to Korea in 1871, {{also known as}} Sinmiyangyo (Western Disturbance of the Year Sinmi year), was the first American military action in Korea. It took place predominantly on and around the Korean island of Ganghwa. The reason for the presence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>military</b> expeditionary force in Korea was to support an American diplomatic delegation sent to establish trade and diplomatic relations with Korea and to ascertain {{the fate of the}} General Sherman merchant ship. The isolationist nature of the Joseon Dynasty government and the assertiveness of the Americans led to an armed conflict between the two parties. Eventually, the United States failed to secure its objectives.|$|E
25|$|Like {{the rest}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>military</b> establishment, the Air Force {{was in no}} way {{prepared}} for battle at the western rim of the Pacific. Yet despite these limitations, the Air Force responded quickly and effectively, proving in many ways the utility of airpower in modern war. With virtually no warning, the Air Force injected itself into the war in the first critical week. It transported troops and equipment from Japan to Korea, evacuated American nationals, provided significant intelligence through aerial reconnaissance, and most importantly helped to slow the North Korean advance so that the United Nations forces could construct a defensive position on the peninsula.|$|E

25|$|As {{the role}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>military</b> grew larger, commissaries {{began to spread}} around the world. The first {{overseas}} stores opened in Cuba, the Philippines and in China between 1898 and 1904. They were soon followed by commissaries in Panama and Puerto Rico. Eventually, all the services adopted the Army's concept of commissary sales stores and tailored the concept to their own needs. The Navy and Marine Corps opened their first commissaries in 1909 and 1910, and the Air Force inherited its stores from the Army Air Forces in 1947 and 1948. By the mid-1970s, each of the services ran its own commissary agency, with differing procedures and systems: the Army Troop Support Agency (TSA), the Navy Resale System Support Office (NAVRESSO), the Commissary Section of the Marine Corps Services Command, and the Air Force Commissary Service (AFCOMS).|$|E
25|$|Despite the low {{priority}} accorded to Guam, some minor steps were also taken by other command to improve Guam's defenses before war broke out. A contract for minor {{improvements to the}} military facilities on Guam was issued in April 1941, and work began the next month. The Guam Insular Force Guard, which was a locally manned milita force responsible for protecting the naval base, was also slightly expanded in May. On 17 October the dependents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>military</b> personnel on the island were evacuated to the United States by the transport , followed by more than 1000 construction workers. On 23 October 1941 the US Navy's General Board provided Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox with a report on Guam's defenses which recommended against reinforcing the island due to the difficulties of defending it {{and the need to}} allocate resources to other priorities. The report argued in favor of continuing to improve Guam's harbour and seaplane facilities, however.|$|E
25|$|The Fall of France in June 1940 shocked American opinion, and isolationist {{sentiment}} declined. In July 1940, Roosevelt appointed two interventionist Republican leaders, Henry L. Stimson and Frank Knox, as Secretaries of War and the Navy, respectively. Both parties gave {{support to}} {{his plans for}} a rapid build-up <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>military,</b> but the isolationists warned that Roosevelt would get the nation into an unnecessary war with Germany. In July 1940, a group of Congressmen introduced {{a bill that would}} authorize the nation's first peacetime draft, and {{with the support of the}} Roosevelt administration the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940 passed in September. The size of the army would increase from 189,000 men at the end of 1939 to 1.4 million men in mid-1941. In September 1940, Roosevelt openly defied the Neutrality Acts by reaching the Destroyers for Bases Agreement, which, in exchange for military base rights in the British Caribbean Islands, gave 50 WWI American destroyers to Britain.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>military's</b> {{strategic}} and tactical decisions made {{during this period}} would color the conduct and nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conflict for <b>the</b> duration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> commitment. Classical <b>military</b> logic demanded that the U.S. attack <b>the</b> locus <b>of</b> PAVN/NLF in <b>the</b> North. If that country could not be invaded, then the enemy's logistical system in Laos and Cambodia should be cut by ground forces, isolating the southern battlefield. However, political considerations limited U.S. military actions, mainly because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> memory <b>of</b> communist reactions during the Korean War. Ever present in <b>the</b> minds <b>of</b> diplomats, military officers, and politicians was <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> a spiraling escalation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conflict into a superpower confrontation and <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> a nuclear exchange. Therefore, {{there would be no}} invasion <b>of</b> North Vietnam, <b>the</b> [...] "neutrality" [...] of Laos and Cambodia would be respected, and Rolling Thunder would not resemble <b>the</b> bombing <b>of</b> Germany and Japan during the Second World War.|$|R

25|$|The {{group has}} claimed {{responsibility}} for over 6,000 attacks in Iraq including the October 10, 2006 attack on Camp Falcon, the assassination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>military</b> commander in Najaf, the May 6, 2006 downing of a British Lynx helicopter and the October 3, 2007 attack on the Polish ambassador. Their most known attack however, is the January 20, 2007 Karbala provincial headquarters raid where they infiltrated the U.S. Army's offices at Karbala, killed one soldier, then abducted and killed four more American soldiers. After the raid, the U.S. military launched a crackdown on the group and the raid's mastermind Azhar al-Dulaimi was killed in Baghdad, {{while much of the}} group's leadership including the brothers Qais and Laith al-Khazali and Lebanese Hezbollah member Ali Musa Daqduq who was Khazali's advisor was in charge of their relations with Hezbollah. After these arrests in 2007, Akram al-Kabi, who had been the military commander of the Mahdi Army until May 2007, led the organisation. In May 2007, the group kidnapped British IT expert Peter Moore and his four bodyguards. They demanded the release of all their fighters being imprisoned by the Iraqi authorities and US military in return for his release. His four bodyguards were killed, but Moore himself was released when the group's leader Qais al-Khazali was released in January 2010. Prior to Qazali's release, security forces had already released over 100 of the group's members including Laith al-Khazali. In 2008 many of the groups fighters and leaders fled to Iran after the Iraqi Army was allowed to re-take control of Sadr City and the Mahdi Army was disbanded. Here most fighters were re-trained in new tactics. It resulted in a major lull in the group's activity from May to July 2008.|$|E
