From around 1935 the toy figures produced under the brand Elastolin, some of which show motifs from before 1918 with updated uniforms, began to include a signal corps soldier with a pigeon transport dog.

5000|$|On the Irish Albums Chart, Classic debuted {{at number}} 48 after its first week <b>of</b> <b>release.</b> In its second {{week on the}} chart, the album moved up ten {{positions}} to number 38.

40|$|Abstract This study {{examines}} the sustained <b>release</b> behav-iour <b>of</b> both water-soluble (acetaminophen, caffeine, theo-phylline and salicylic acid) and water insoluble (indomethacin) drugs from tamarind seed polysaccharide isolated from tamarind kernel powder. It further investi-gates {{the effect of}} incorporation of diluents like microcrys-talline cellulose and lactose on <b>release</b> <b>of</b> caffeine and partial cross-linking of the polysaccharide on <b>release</b> <b>of</b> acetaminophen. Applying exponential equation, the mech-anism <b>of</b> <b>release</b> <b>of</b> soluble drugs {{was found to be}} anoma-lous. The insoluble drug showed near case II or zero order release mechanism. The rate <b>of</b> <b>release</b> was in the decreas-ing order of caffeine, acetaminophen, theophylline, sali-cylic acid and indomethacin. An increase in <b>release</b> kinetics <b>of</b> drug was observed on blending with diluents. However, the rate <b>of</b> <b>release</b> varied with type and amount of blend in the matrix. The mechanism <b>of</b> <b>release</b> due to effect of dilu-ents was found to be anomalous. The rate <b>of</b> <b>release</b> <b>of</b> drug decreased on partial cross-linking and the mechanism <b>of</b> <b>release</b> was found to be super case II...|$|R
5|$|Nelson {{featured}} {{arrangements of}} acoustic guitar, accompanied by piano, played by his sister, Bobbie, as well complementary arrangements of drums, harmonica and mandolin. The sparsely instrumented acoustic arrangements caused Columbia directors {{to doubt the}} wisdom <b>of</b> <b>releasing</b> the album as presented, feeling it was under-produced {{and no more than}} a demo. However, Nelson had complete creative control, and it was released without any further modifications.|$|E
5|$|Oxidative {{phosphorylation}} (or OXPHOS in short) is {{the metabolic}} pathway in which cells use enzymes to oxidize nutrients, thereby releasing energy {{which is used}} to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP). In most eukaryotes, this takes place inside mitochondria. Almost all aerobic organisms carry out oxidative phosphorylation. This pathway is probably so pervasive because it is a highly efficient way <b>of</b> <b>releasing</b> energy, compared to alternative fermentation processes such as anaerobic glycolysis.|$|E

5|$|The shootdown {{happened}} {{at a very}} tense time in U.S.–Soviet relations during the Cold War.

Six hours after the plane was downed, the South Korean government issued an announcement that the plane had merely been forced to land abruptly by the Soviets, and that all passengers and crew were safe.|$|E

30|$|Of {{the control}} {{variables}} only three are consistent across all four models: Having {{a higher proportion}} of newbies means a lower number <b>of</b> <b>releases.</b> A better past track record (higher median number <b>of</b> <b>releases</b> for the past recordings of the musicians on the session) means a higher number <b>of</b> <b>releases</b> to the target session. The overall number <b>of</b> <b>releases</b> decreases as years advance – indicating either a long-range censoring, or a general decline in the level of success for the average jazz session over time.|$|R

Sony Computer Entertainment Europe commissioned SCE Cambridge Studio to develop a launch title for the PlayStation Portable. Due to time constraints, the Cambridge studio was given only a year to develop the game, thus they decided to remake the original MediEvil. The game was met with mixed reviews upon release, with critics mainly praising the game's humor, voice talent and graphics but was criticized for lack of innovation and cumbersome camera controls.|$|E
5|$|Duke Nukem Forever {{was officially}} {{announced}} on April 28, 1997, {{with the intention}} <b>of</b> <b>releasing</b> the game no later than mid-1998. Barely {{a year after the}} release of Duke Nukem 3D, the game's graphics and its game engine, the Build engine, were antiquated. Id Software's new Quake II engine was far superior to Build, so Broussard decided to license it. The price spent for the licensing rights was steep—estimates were as high as $500,000—but Broussard reasoned that it would save time used to write a game engine from scratch. Broussard and Miller were flush with cash from the sales of Duke Nukem 3D and other games, so they decided to fund Duke Nukem Forever themselves, turning marketing and publishing rights over to GT Interactive.|$|E

It received generally positive reviews from critics, who complimented its topical protest songs and Cooder's musicianship. The album peaked at number 164 on the Billboard 200 chart in the US, but charted significantly higher in other countries. Cooder did not tour in promotion of the album, citing a lost interest in both playing large concert venues and the commercial aspect <b>of</b> <b>releasing</b> records.|$|E

Although it was Newman's deputy André Lamy who in some cases drew the monolingual Newman's attention to the controversial nature of French language productions, it was Lamy himself who later permitted the release of some of these same films after he succeeded Newman as Government Film Commissioner.|$|E
