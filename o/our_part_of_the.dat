[...] They attended The Bolles School, in Jacksonville, Florida, together. [...] There they were roommates for two years, swim team teammates, and became best friends. [...] Qupty's father, commenting on the friendship and teamwork between his Christian Arab Israeli son and his son's Jewish Israeli roommate/teammate, said: [...] "Just to see them together after the race jumping and hugging each other; they were so happy. I was looking at them through my tears. Coming from <b>our</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world, you don't see that." [...] The younger Qupty observed that [...] "people were amazed all the time" [...] that he – a Palestinian – and a Jew could coexist, and Shapira Bar-Or said: [...] "It shows how simple the situation is. If I can live with a Palestinian guy, I'm sure in our country we can live with a couple millions of Palestinians and Israelis together." ...|$|E

She had one of those {{exquisite}} rose skins frequent in <b>our</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country, and beautiful until the little veins begin to break at about forty; now, flushed with the cold, it was a riot of lovely delicate pinks like many carnations. She and Joe had reached some sort of reconciliation, or at least he was too far gone in love to remember last night; but I saw that though she laughed a lot she wasn't really paying any attention to him or any of them. She wanted them to go, so that there'd be a message from the kitchen, but I knew that the message wasn't coming—that she was safe. There was talk of the Pump and Slipper dance at New Haven and of the Princeton Prom, and then, in various moods, we four left and separated quickly outside. I walked home with a certain depression of spirit and lay for an hour in a hot bath thinking that vacation was all over for me now that she was gone; feeling, even more deeply than I had yesterday, that she was out of my life." ...|$|E
