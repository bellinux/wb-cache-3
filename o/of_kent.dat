5|$|By {{the time}} the Roman Empire {{recalled}} its legions from the province of Britannia in 410, parts of the island had already been settled by pagan Germanic tribes who, later in the century, appear to have taken control <b>of</b> <b>Kent</b> and other coastal regions. In the late 6th century Pope Gregory sent a group of missionaries to Kent to convert Æthelberht, King <b>of</b> <b>Kent,</b> whose wife, Bertha <b>of</b> <b>Kent,</b> was a Frankish princess and practising Christian. Augustine was the prior of Gregory's own monastery in Rome and Gregory prepared {{the way for the}} mission by soliciting aid from the Frankish rulers along Augustine's route.|$|E
5|$|Edwin and Eadbald <b>of</b> <b>Kent</b> were allies at this time, and Edwin {{arranged}} to marry Eadbald's sister Æthelburg. Bede notes that Eadbald {{would agree to}} marry his sister to Edwin only if he converted to Christianity. The marriage of Eadbald's Merovingian mother Bertha had resulted in the conversion <b>of</b> <b>Kent</b> and Æthelburg's {{would do the same}} in Northumbria.|$|E

5|$|The see of Canterbury was vacant for {{two years}} after the death of Theodore before Berhtwald was elected to the office on 1 July 692. The long vacancy {{resulted}} from the disturbed conditions in the kingdom <b>of</b> <b>Kent</b> at the time, as various kings fought for control. The succession to the kingdom was disputed between rival claimants Oswine and Wihtred, and various outside kings, including Caedwalla and Swaefheard raided and plundered Kent. Eventually, Wihtred secured the throne, around 691 or early 692, as Bede names Wihtred as King <b>of</b> <b>Kent,</b> along with Swaefheard, at the time of Berhtwald's election. Swaerfheard, however, is not named as king <b>of</b> <b>Kent</b> after this date.|$|E

5|$|After his {{accession}} Cædwalla {{returned to}} Sussex {{and won the}} territory again, and also conquered the Isle of Wight, engaging in genocide, extinguishing the ruling dynasty there, and forcing {{the population of the}} island at sword point to renounce their pagan beliefs for Christianity. He gained control of Surrey and the kingdom <b>of</b> <b>Kent,</b> and in 686 he installed his brother, Mul, as king <b>of</b> <b>Kent.</b> Mul was burned in a Kentish revolt a year later, and Cædwalla returned, possibly ruling Kent directly for a period.|$|E

5|$|Edmund of Woodstock, 1st Earl <b>of</b> <b>Kent</b> (5 August 1301 – 19 March 1330) was {{the sixth}} son of Edward I of England, {{and a younger}} {{half-brother}} of Edward II. Edward I had intended to make substantial grants of land to Edmund, but when the king died in 1307, Edward II failed {{to follow through on}} his father's intentions, much due to his favouritism towards Piers Gaveston. Edmund still remained loyal to his brother, and in 1321 he was created Earl <b>of</b> <b>Kent.</b> He played an important part in Edward's administration, acting both as diplomat and military commander, and in 1321–22 helped suppress a rebellion against the king.|$|E

5|$|If Offa did {{not gain}} the {{advantage}} in Wessex until defeating Cynewulf in 779, {{it may be}} that his successes south of the river were a necessary prerequisite to his interventions in the southeast. In this view, Egbert of Kent's death in about 784 and Cynewulf's death in 786 were the events that allowed Offa to gain control <b>of</b> <b>Kent</b> and bring Beorhtric into his sphere of influence. This version of events also assumes that Offa did not have control <b>of</b> <b>Kent</b> after 764–65, as some historians believe.|$|E
