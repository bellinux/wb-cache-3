His studies often had particular significance {{in the field of}} evolution; he believed the anatomical structures of fossil and extant species should exhibit relationships. His work charted the evolution from the early fishes through the various branches to birds and mammals, with numerous papers and two major works: <b>Our</b> <b>Face</b> from Fish to Man in 1929 and Evolution Emerging in 1951.|$|E

[...] Beck's and Palin's speeches praised George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and Martin Luther King Jr., as well as American war veterans. Beck called for Americans to unite despite political or religious disagreements, with 240clergy from different races and religions – belonging to the ecumenical ministerial group, the Black Robe Regiment – joining the events' speakers on stage before its closing statements.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the subject}} of his religion, Hawke {{previously}} wrote, while attending the 1952 World Christian Youth Conference in India, that [...] "there were all these poverty stricken kids at the gate of this palatial place where we were feeding <b>our</b> <b>face</b> and I just had this struck by this enormous sense of irrelevance of religion to the needs of people". He subsequently abandoned his Christian beliefs. By the time he entered politics he was a self-described agnostic. Hawke told Andrew Denton in 2008 that his father's Christian faith had continued to influence his outlook, saying [...] "My father said if you believe in the fatherhood of God you must necessarily believe in the brotherhood of man, it follows necessarily, and even though I left the church and was not religious, that truth remained with me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pat Bolland, in his February 3 {{interview}} with Candice Malcolm, acknowledged that both Sun News {{and the government}} [...] "had {{a little bit of}} egg on <b>our</b> <b>face</b> ," [...] but both he and fellow Roundtable host Alex Pierson asserted they were personally not privy to CIC's actions or the actual citizenship status of the participants when they presented the event to viewers. Sun News management would claim no advance knowledge as well, with spokesperson Luc Lavoie stating that [...] "our viewers were deceived by a well-meaning [...] bureaucrat who made a poor decision", and cited, by name, a Sun News producer (who left the network a month after the event) for her role in the incident. However, the explanations of both Kenney's office and Sun News were called into question in June 2012, when a new Canadian Press report revealed that they both were in fact privy to the presence of the civil servants on the Roundtable broadcast, and that Sun was [...] "given the choice" [...] to use them on-air. Kenney, in response to the new CP report, backtracked on his earlier blame of CIC bureaucrats, claiming in House of Commons that [...] "at every citizenship ceremony Canadians are invited to reaffirm, including public servants", and that the Sun News incident [...] "was perfectly normal and legitimate".|$|E

It is the universe which has resulted from the death of individuals. And to this universe alone belongs the quality of infinity: to the universe of death. Living individuals have no infinity save in this relation to the total death-substance and death-being, the summed-up cosmos.|$|E
