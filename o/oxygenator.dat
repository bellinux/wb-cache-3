50|$|Statistics and {{conclusions}} from more studies are available here. Clearly, heparin-coated blood <b>oxygenators</b> exhibit some advantages over non-coated <b>oxygenators.</b> Some hospitals use heparin-coated <b>oxygenators</b> {{for the large}} majority of their cases requiring cardiopulmonary bypass. It is unclear whether most surgeons actually reduce the amount of systemic heparin used when their patients are being perfused with heparin-coated <b>oxygenators.</b> Ultimately, each surgeon makes this decision based upon the needs of individual patient.|$|R

40|$|The thrombogenicity of {{membrane}} <b>oxygenators</b> {{as well as}} clotting parameters profiles, using standard human clotting tests, {{was analyzed}} in calves and pigs during 6 h perfusion.

50|$|The {{history of}} the <b>oxygenator,</b> or {{artificial}} lung, dates back to 1885, with the first demonstration of a disc <b>oxygenator,</b> on which blood was exposed to the atmosphere on rotating discs by Von Frey and Gruber. These pioneers noted the dangers of blood streaming, foaming and clotting. In the 1920s and 30s, research into developing extracorporeal oxygenation continued. Working independently, Brukhonenko in the USSR and John Heysham Gibbon in the USA demonstrated the feasibility of extracorporeal oxygenation. Brukhonenko used excised dog lungs while Gibbon used a direct contact drum type <b>oxygenator,</b> perfusing cats for up to 25 minutes in the 1930s.|$|E

30|$|Theoretically, small <b>oxygenators</b> may be {{preferable}} as the blood velocity is suggested {{to be higher}} in these devices compared with larger <b>oxygenators,</b> {{and the results of}} previous computational fluid dynamic studies have demonstrated that low velocity regions qualitatively matched regions with a high incidence of thrombotic deposition [21, 22]. In this regard, lower blood flow rates also contribute to a low blood velocity within the membrane lung increasing the likelihood of clotting. This, in turn, would require more aggressive anticoagulation with a consequent increased bleeding risk. However, a high pressure drop over the membrane lung, which increases with decreasing membrane lung size, is associated with increased hemolysis [23, 24].|$|R
40|$|Blood gas {{exchange}} across synthetic membranes is primarily used in blood <b>oxygenators</b> for short-term (1 - 3 hours) cardiopulmonary bypass procedures. Long term applications (6 hours - i 4 days) of membrane <b>oxygenators</b> include treatment of acute respiratory failure or acute liver failure. There are {{several types of}} membranes used in these devices: (1) microporous membranes which have high gas permeabilities but have problems of pore wetting if employed in long-term therapies and (2) homogeneous membranes, e. g. silicone rubber which have lower permeability characteristics but are non-wettable and (3) composite membranes which a very thin homogeneous membrane is mechanically supported by a micro porous layer.

50|$|Open-heart surgery {{developed}} rapidly {{beginning in}} the 1950s, and many methods were developed for oxygenating blood outside the body. A bubble <b>oxygenator</b> was introduced in 1950 by Clark, Gollan, and Gupta. The method faced initial skepticism but in 1956 the University of Minnesota's De-Wall-Lillehei bubble <b>oxygenator</b> was demonstrated to be relatively simple, inexpensive, and easy to operate.|$|E
50|$|The early {{artificial}} lungs used relatively impermeable polyethylene or Teflon homogeneous membranes, {{and it was}} {{not until}} more highly permeable silicone rubber membranes were introduced in the 1960s (and as hollow fibres in 1971) that the membrane <b>oxygenator</b> became commercially successful. The introduction of microporous hollow fibres with very low resistance to mass transfer revolutionized the design of membrane modules, as the limiting factor to <b>oxygenator</b> performance became the blood resistance. Current designs of <b>oxygenator</b> typically use an extraluminal flow regime, where the blood flows outside the gas filled hollow fibers, for short term life support, while only the homogeneous membranes are approved for long term use.|$|E
50|$|Heparin coating is {{reported}} to result in similar characteristics to the native endothelium.

Dideco Lilliput™ <b>oxygenators</b> were used for infants up to 15  kg and D- 905 (Dideco, Markham, Ontario) <b>oxygenators</b> for those > 15  kg.

40|$|New {{generation}} <b>oxygenators</b> with integrated {{arterial line}} filters have been marketed {{to improve the}} efficacy of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Differences in designs, materials, coating surfaces, pore size of arterial filter, and static prime exist between the <b>oxygenators.</b> Despite abundant preclinical data, literature lacks clinical studies. From September 2010 to March 2011, 80 consecutive patients were randomized to CPB using Terumo Capiox FX 25 (40 patients, Group-T) or Sorin Synthesis (40 patients, Group-S) <b>oxygenators.</b> Pressure drop and gas exchange efficacy were registered during CPB. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), white blood cells (WBCs), fluid balance, activated clotting time, international normalized ratio (INR), {{activated partial thromboplastin time}} (aPTT), fibrinogen, platelets (PLTs), serum albumin, and total proteins were measured perioperatively at different timepoints. Clinical outcome was recorded. Repeated measure analysis of variance and nonparametric statistics assessed between-groups and during time differences. The two groups showed similar baseline and intraoperative variables. No differences were recorded in pressure drop and gas exchange (group-P and group*time-P = N. S. for all) during CPB. Despite similar fluid balance (P = N. S. for static/dynamic priming and ΔVolume administered intraoperatively), Group-T showed higher hs-CRP (group-P = 0. 034), aPTT (group-P = 0. 0001), and INR (group-P= 0. 05), with lower serum albumin (group-P = 0. 014), total proteins (group-P = 0. 0001), fibrinogen (group-P = 0. 041), and PLTs (group-P = 0. 021). Group-T also showed higher postoperative bleeding (group-P = 0. 009) and need for transfusions (P = 0. 008 for packed red cells and P = 0. 0001 for fresh frozen plasma and total transfused volumes). However, clinical outcome was comparable (P = N. S. for all clinical endpoints). Both <b>oxygenators</b> proved effective and resulted in comparable clinical outcomes. However, Sorin Synthesis seems to reduce inflammation and better preserve the coagulative cascade and serum proteins, resulting in lower transfusions and post-CPB inflammatory response...|$|R

40|$|Various {{types of}} heparin coating {{techniques}} {{are applied to}} blood-contacting surfaces of membrane <b>oxygenators</b> to improve biocompatibility of the cardiopulmonary bypass system and circulatory assist device.
