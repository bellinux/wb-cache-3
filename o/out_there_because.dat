500|$|Virginia Tech quarterback Marcus Vick was {{considered}} the key player for the Virginia Tech offense heading into the Gator Bowl. The younger brother of first-overall NFL Draft pick Michael Vick—who also played for Tech—Marcus {{led the league in}} passing efficiency (141.6rating), completed 166 of 268passes (60.3percent) for 2,190yards and 15touchdowns, with ten interceptions. On the ground, he ran for 370yards and six touchdowns. Prior to the Gator Bowl, he pledged that he would return for another season at Virginia Tech before entering the NFL draft. [...] "The NFL is tough. It's the real deal. You've got to be ready for it. You just don't want to rush into just throwing yourself <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>because</b> of the money or anything like that. You've got to really be prepared for it", he said.|$|E

The song was {{selective}} in its release only being sold as an album bonus track in United Kingdom and Ireland, and was dubbed [...] "Kesha edit" [...] or [...] "Dirty Picture, Pt. 2". The song {{is similar to}} the original recording of the song with the only noticeable change being that Kesha now sings the song's first verse. While being interviewed by Digital Spy Cruz explained how the cover initially came about and his view on the cover, [...] "she asked me if she could do a version of the song where she sang the first verse and I thought that was a really cool idea. I really like both versions, and it's good that there are these two different versions <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> <b>because</b> fans of me get more of me on mine and [...] fans get more of her on hers." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "My first {{interview}} with the manager was curious. He did not ask me to sit down after my twenty-mile walk that morning. He was commonplace in complexion, in features, in manners, and in voice. He was of middle size and of ordinary build. His eyes, of the usual blue, were perhaps remarkably cold, and he certainly could make his glance fall on one {{as trenchant and heavy}} as an axe. But even at these times the rest of his person seemed to disclaim the intention. Otherwise there was only an indefinable, faint expression of his lips, something stealthy--a smile--not a smile--I remember it, but I can't explain. It was unconscious, this smile was, though just after he had said something it got intensified for an instant. It came {{at the end of his}} speeches like a seal applied on the words to make the meaning of the commonest phrase appear absolutely inscrutable. He was a common trader, from his youth up employed in these parts--nothing more. He was obeyed, yet he inspired neither love nor fear, nor even respect. He inspired uneasiness. That was it! Uneasiness. Not a definite mistrust--just uneasiness--nothing more. You have no idea how effective such a... a... faculty can be. He had no genius for organizing, for initiative, or for order even. That was evident in such things as the deplorable state of the station. He had no learning, and no intelligence. His position had come to him--why? Perhaps because he was never ill... He had served three terms of three years <b>out</b> <b>there...</b> <b>Because</b> triumphant health in the general rout of constitutions is a kind of power in itself. When he went home on leave he rioted on a large scale--pompously. Jack ashore--with a difference--in externals only. This one could gather from his casual talk. He originated nothing, he could keep the routine going--that's all. But he was great. He was great by this little thing that it was impossible to tell what could control such a man. He never gave that secret away. Perhaps there was nothing within him. Such a suspicion made one pause--for out there there were no external checks. Once when various tropical diseases had laid low almost every 'agent' in the station, he was heard to say, 'Men who come out here should have no entrails.' He sealed the utterance with that smile of his, as though it had been a door opening into a darkness he had in his keeping. You fancied you had seen things--but the seal was on. When annoyed at meal-times by the constant quarrels of the white men about precedence, he ordered an immense round table to be made, for which a special house had to be built. This was the station's mess-room. Where he sat was the first place--the rest were nowhere. One felt this to be his unalterable conviction. He was neither civil nor uncivil. He was quiet. He allowed his 'boy'--an overfed young negro from the coast--to treat the white men, under his very eyes, with provoking insolence.|$|E

60|$|She did neither, but {{she remembered}} the scene, and gave the Professor her heartiest respect, for she knew it cost him an effort to speak <b>out</b> then and <b>there,</b> <b>because</b> his {{conscience}} would not let him be silent.

We can't have those <b>out</b> <b>there.</b> <b>Because</b> if they're out there they're just going to get {{circulated}} around to the wrong people. Those guns should not be in the public's hands.

5000|$|The band {{decided that}} they had {{gone as far as}} they could go musically with Spiritual Machines. Looking to reinvigorate {{themselves}} and change directions musically, they sought a more stripped down sound as opposed to the multiple layers and textures of their previous albums. It was this idea of simplifying that inspired the title of Gravity. Raine discussed the transition in a 2002 interview. “’Spiritual Machines’ was so <b>out</b> <b>there</b> in talking about the future and trying to perceive man turning into machine, it was very heavy. With this record...it kind of felt like we were being pulled back down to earth, hence the title. It’s such a simple life <b>out</b> <b>there</b> and <b>because</b> of that the album was just based around living day to day rather than looking too far ahead. In that sense ‘Gravity’ is pretty much the opposite of ‘Spiritual Machines’. None of our other albums had been concept records, so it was the right time for us to get away from that whole philosophy. Because of that ‘Gravity’ is probably the most basic album we’ve made since our first.” ...|$|R

I was talking to Richard Tyson about it, saying, ‘You know, I’m just gonna pull it off the market.’ But he said, ‘Leave it <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> <b>because</b> you never know—they might come around,’ so we decided to see what the director and his people can do to get it back up. They spent all their money, and they didn’t have a completion bond—so I hear, anyway." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{producers}} {{revealed that}} the season {{will be based on}} the comic book stories Batman: The Long Halloween and Batman: Year One. According to executive producer John Stephens, the season won't consist of [...] "direct adaptations", but [...] "loose interpretations" [...] of the comic book series. Ben McKenzie explained that the structure for the season would be [...] "the beginning is more Long Halloween, our version of that, and the end is more Year One." [...] According to Stephens, the show will handle a horror-oriented direction on the season: [...] "At {{the very beginning of the}} season, Penguin has solidified his control upon Gotham like never before. Where he's kind of unionized crime. And Scarecrow comes in to basically reintroduce fear into Gotham and to remind people that the dark is still scary <b>out</b> <b>there.</b> And we're really going to fashion, especially Episode 2, almost a horror movie episode where we really get to see Scarecrow. I think he's like purely terrifying. Imagine, rather than the other versions of Scarecrow <b>out</b> <b>there</b> — <b>because</b> <b>there</b> are a lot of different versions — what if you just really tell Scarecrow as a horror movie? Because he could be scary as hell." ...|$|R
500|$|One of {{the songs}} they worked together, [...] "It's You", {{was said to be}} one of the album's centerpiece, with Malik commenting: [...] "I just felt like I needed to put myself <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> just <b>because</b> it was a form of therapy for me and it did help me get through some shit. If I can help someone else at that time, that’s cool." [...] Dan Hyman from [...] Pitchfork Media stated that the song shared {{similarities}} with Ocean’s [...] "Bad Religion", with Ho mentioning that after hearing the song live and Zayn's fans noting similarities between both songs, he found them similar with the organ. [...] "It's You" [...] premiered during Zane Lowe's Beats One Radio on 25 February 2016, and a day later, 26 February 2016, it was released as the first promotional single from Zayn's debut solo studio album Mind of Mine (2016), along with the pre-order of the album on the iTunes Store.|$|R
5000|$|Harrison and {{his second}} wife Olivia {{restored}} the gardens. Until his death in November 2001, he loved tending to them personally − an activity that a visiting Rolling Stone journalist in 1987 deemed a [...] "decidedly un-rock-star-ish pastime" [...] − and among the groundskeepers were his older brothers Peter and Harry. George's son Dhani would later recall for the Scorsese documentary: [...] "He'd garden at night-time until midnight. He'd be <b>out</b> <b>there</b> squinting <b>because</b> he could see, at midnight, the moonlight and shadows, and that {{was his way of}} not seeing the weeds or imperfections that would plague him during the day ..." [...] Talking of the tranquility he felt at Friar Park, Harrison once said: [...] "Sometimes I feel like I'm actually on the wrong planet, and it's great when I'm in my garden. But the minute I go out the gate I think: 'What the hell am I doing here?'" ...|$|R
