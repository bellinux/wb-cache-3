5|$|Clay {{attempts}} to romance Rain Turner, a gorgeous young woman auditioning {{for a role}} in his new film, leading her on {{with the promise of}} being cast, all the while knowing she is too old for the part. His narration reveals he has done this with a number {{of men and women in}} the past, and yet <b>often</b> <b>comes</b> out of the relationship hurt and damaged himself. Over the course of their relationship, he is stalked by unknown persons driving a Jeep and is frequently reminded by various individuals of the grisly murder of a young producer whom he knew. Clay disinterestedly watches a snuff film of the murder—later attributed to Rip—on his iPhone.|$|E

5|$|Social Worker: Every {{patient is}} {{assigned}} {{a social worker}} who visits {{at the time of}} admission to hospice. The social worker function can vary from providing superficial support to patients and families to intensive crisis-oriented counseling. Additionally, with a terminal illness <b>often</b> <b>comes</b> more complicated financial stressors; the social worker can be instrumental in connecting the patient and family with community resources including services such as Meals on Wheels. Lastly, if a patient is unable to be cared for at home, the social worker will work to find a safer place for the patient to receive hospice care.|$|E

5|$|The {{director}} {{of the film is}} not known, but two possibles exist. Barry O'Neil was the stage name of Thomas J. McCarthy, who would direct many important Thanhouser pictures, including its first two-reeler, Romeo and Juliet. Lloyd B. Carleton was the stage name of Carleton B. Little, a director who would stay with the Thanhouser Company until moving to the Biograph Company by the summer of 1910. The confusion between the directing credits stems from the industry practice of not crediting the film directors, even in studio news releases. Q. David Bowers says that the attribution of these early directors <b>often</b> <b>comes</b> from a collection of contemporary publications or interviews.|$|E
5|$|The player {{assumes the}} role of Riki Naoe, the protagonist of Little Busters!. He is seen as weak due to his girlish {{appearance}} and physical build but is very straightforward and has more common sense than most of his friends. He {{is a member of}} a group of friends called the Little Busters, which originally consisted of four members, but expanded to five with Riki during his childhood. The leader of the Little Busters is Kyousuke Natsume, who is the eldest member. He <b>often</b> <b>comes</b> up with absurd ideas, but almost always follows up with a reasonable explanation along with it.|$|E
5|$|The Knight on c6 {{is safer}} than on g6, and is well-placed {{as part of}} a general {{strategy}} to control the central dark squares. It can go to d4 while the other Knight can go to c5 via a6 or d7. After 6.Nf3 Bc5 White has difficulties castling short, because the plan to exchange the dark-squared bishops with Bd3/Qe2/Be3 can be met by Bg4/Nd4 to muddy the waters. As Lalic points out:White can no longer castle kingside and will usually have to go the other way. However, this is rather slow and gives Black time to try to undermine the white centre. To this end Bc8–g4 <b>often</b> <b>comes</b> in handy, in order to pin the white knight on f3 against the white queen. Note that Black should wait until his opponent has wasted a tempo with Qe2.|$|E

5|$|When Garth Ennis {{took over}} writing, he {{included}} his trademark representation {{of racism and}} religious fanaticism, as well his depictions of the Falklands War. The most controversial writer, Brian Azzarello, tackled issues such as Neo-Nazism, prison rape and homosexuality. During Warren Ellis' run, he included American school shootings in a one-shot issue {{which led to a}} major controversy. In his run, Peter Milligan managed to put punk ideology in the series, with the protagonist trying to reacquire his former punk self, while also characterizing the Conservative government as a demon infestation with the punk subculture fighting against this supposed subversion and abuse. As such, much of Hellblazer's horror <b>often</b> <b>comes</b> in the crisis and controversies of its time. Being set in the UK, many famous British personalities have appeared or made cameos such as Sid Vicious, Margaret Thatcher, Aleister Crowley and Alan Moore.|$|E

25|$|As {{in other}} Ethiopian Semitic {{languages}} very common use of relative clauses is in cleft sentences. The main verb of the corresponding unclefted sentence {{is replaced by}} a relative clause and copula, and the relative clause <b>often</b> <b>comes</b> last in the sentence.|$|E
25|$|In bacchiacs the word-accent quite <b>often</b> <b>comes</b> {{after the}} short {{syllable}} (ecástor sin' ómni: u – – u – –), rather than before it, as {{it tends to}} with cretics (máximā cópiā: – u – – u –); some editors, therefore, mark these elements as an ictus.|$|E
25|$|Statistics rarely give {{a simple}} Yes/No type {{answer to the}} {{question}} under analysis. Interpretation <b>often</b> <b>comes</b> down to the level of statistical significance applied to the numbers and often refers to the probability of a value accurately rejecting the null hypothesis (sometimes referred to as the p-value).|$|E

25|$|Animal skin {{coloration}} <b>often</b> <b>comes</b> {{about through}} specialized cells called chromatophores, which {{animals such as}} the octopus and chameleon can control to vary the animal's color. Many conditions affect the levels or nature of pigments in plant, animal, some protista, or fungus cells. For instance, the disorder called albinism affects the level of melanin production in animals.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin A {{deficiencies}} generally {{occur as}} a result of fat-soluble vitamins deficiencies. This <b>often</b> <b>comes</b> after intestinal bypass procedures such as jejunoileal bypass (no longer performed) or biliopancreatic diversion/duodenal switch procedures. In these procedures, fat absorption is markedly impaired. There is also the possibility of a vitamin A deficiency with use of the weight-loss medication orlistat (marketed as Xenical and Alli).|$|E

25|$|To a non-mathematician it <b>often</b> <b>comes</b> as a {{surprise}} {{that it is impossible}} to define explicitly all the terms which are used. This is not a superficial problem but lies at the root of all knowledge; it is necessary to begin somewhere, and to make progress one must clearly state those elements and relations which are undefined and those properties which are taken for granted.|$|E
25|$|Barone patriarch Frank is a fiery proletarian {{prone to}} insults and merciless put downs {{directed}} at {{any and all}} targets. Largely an absentee father when the boys were growing up, Frank buries his feelings and rarely gives in to sentiment. As the series progresses, however, several episodes demonstrate that the senior Barone loves his family immensely. Unlike everyone else, Frank has no problem comically criticizing Marie and <b>often</b> <b>comes</b> to Debra's defense following Marie's comments.|$|E
25|$|Once {{political}} {{boundaries and}} military {{lines have been}} breached, pacification of the region is the final, and arguably the most important, goal of the invading force. After {{the defeat of the}} regular military, or when one is lacking, continued opposition to an invasion <b>often</b> <b>comes</b> from civilian or paramilitary resistance movements. Complete pacification of an occupied country can be difficult, and usually impossible, but popular support is vital to the success of any invasion.|$|E
