5|$|A storm system {{moved to}} the {{northern}} and central Great Plains region during the day, as strong winds helped push a moist air mass northward ahead of the system. Thunderstorms developed during the afternoon ahead of a cold front from southeast South Dakota into central Kansas. Strong winds along with instability in the atmosphere created favorable conditions for supercell development {{with the potential to}} produce strong tornadoes. At approximately 6:35 pm CDT (2335 UTC) a tornado hit the Little Sioux Scout Ranch in Little Sioux, Iowa, killing four Boy Scouts after a chimney collapsed <b>on</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> injuring 48others. The camp received a tornado warning 12minutes before it struck. There were 93campers and 25staff members at the camp. The campers were between 13and 18 years old and were attending a leadership training camp. The tornado was rated EF3on the Enhanced Fujita Scale.|$|E

Homer destroys the scarecrow, and the crows see Homer as their leader, following him everywhere and doing his bidding. But when the crows try to carry Maggie, Homer turns <b>on</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> they attack his eyes. He is prescribed medicinal marijuana.|$|E
5|$|As Mulder and Scully investigate, they {{discover}} a Malaysian orderly is illicitly giving the patients an herbal drug made of mushrooms he {{cultures in the}} building's basement. The drug cures their Alzheimer's, but also allows them to see the spirits {{of people who have}} died in the nursing home and channel them into existence. In this state, the spirits assault and murder the orderlies that have looked down <b>on</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> treated them poorly while they were patients. When a patient overdoses on the drug, the spirits once again attack Charters, trapping her and Mulder in the bathroom, which begins flooding.|$|E

With the remaining two gangs by their side, the Sole Survivor will have to eliminate the rogue gang. Their actions ultimately decide who controls Nuka-World. In an alternate scenario, they are also given the option of ending raider influence by assassinating the leaders of each gang and their lieutenants, thereby returning control of Nuka-World to the traders who originally {{used it as a}} hub of commerce.|$|E

5|$|Favret {{points out}} that Wollstonecraft's Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark is quite {{different}} from the despondent and plaintive love letters she actually sent to Imlay; the travel narrative much more closely resembles the personal journal in which she recorded her thoughts regarding the people she encountered and the places she visited. While her letters to Imlay contain long passages focused almost exclusively on herself, the Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark offers social commentary and sympathizes with the victims of disaster and injustice. To Imlay, Wollstonecraft represents herself as laid low by doubts, but to the world she depicts herself as overcoming all of these fears. She ruminates <b>on</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> transforms them into the basis of a letter akin to the open political letter popular during the last quarter of the eighteenth century, using her personal experience as the foundation for a discussion of national political reform.|$|E
5|$|For most of 1650, a Venetian {{fleet of}} 41 vessels {{maintained}} the blockade of the Dardanelles, prohibiting Haideragazade Mehmed Pasha from sailing for Crete. He was replaced {{late in the}} year by Hozamzade Ali Pasha, governor of Rhodes, who used a clever ploy to get through the blockade: waiting until winter, when the Venetians withdrew their forces, he assembled a small number of ships and embarked several thousand troops with many provisions <b>on</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> sailed unmolested to Crete.|$|E
5|$|In John, Mary {{is alone}} at first, but Peter and the beloved disciple {{come and see}} the tomb as well. Jesus then appears to Mary at the tomb. He later appears to the disciples, {{breathes}} <b>on</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> gives them the power to forgive and retain sins. In a second visit to disciples, he proves to a doubting disciple ("Doubting Thomas") that he is flesh and blood. The disciples return to Galilee, where Jesus makes another appearance. He performs a miracle known as the catch of 153 fish at the Sea of Galilee, after which Jesus encourages Peter to serve his followers.|$|E

5|$|In many of {{the legends}} of the Cascade Mountains, there are thunderbirds that live <b>on</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> Adams is no exception. This {{particular}} thunderbird was named Enumtla and he terrorized {{the inhabitants of the}} land. Speelyi, the Klickitat coyote god, came along one day and they implored him to do something. Speelyi transformed himself into a feather and waited. It did not take long for Enumtla to see the feather and investigate. Being suspicious, he thundered at the feather with no effect. He paused and suddenly the magic feather let loose a terrific volley of thunder and lightning and stunned Enumtla. Speelyi then managed to overpower Enumtla and decreed that the thunderbird could no longer terrify the people, could only thunder on hot days, and could not destroy with lightning.|$|E
5|$|Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) argue whether ghosts {{are real}} after she {{claims to have}} seen one at a pub where she used to work. Meanwhile, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) dresses up as Sarah Kerrigan from StarCraft, but Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) takes off his wings as they had knives <b>on</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> Dwight {{is not allowed to}} bring in weapons. Bert recognizes what his costume is {{supposed}} to be and the two bond over playing StarCraft all day, ignoring everyone else. Dwight also makes Bert pretend to fire Toby, for taking away his weapons, on the grounds that he is the CEO's son.|$|E
5|$|Later in Acts, Peter preached {{the gospel}} to the {{household}} of Cornelius the Centurion, a gentile. While he preached, the Holy Spirit {{fell on the}} gentiles, {{and they began to}} speak in tongues. The Jewish believers with Peter were amazed, and the household was water baptized. While the apostle Paul was in Ephesus, he found disciples there and discovered {{that they did not know}} of the existence of the Holy Spirit and had only received John the Baptist’s baptism. After baptizing them in Jesus’ name, Paul laid his hands <b>on</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> they began to speak in tongues and prophesy.|$|E

5|$|Like {{previous}} {{games in}} the Mana series, Heroes of Mana features a top-down perspective, in which the player characters navigate the terrain and fight off hostile creatures and enemies. Unlike prior {{games in the}} series, which are typically action role-playing games, Heroes is a real-time strategy game (RTS), in which the player controls up to 25 units in battles on fixed maps. Units are controlled via the Nintendo DS touch screen, selected by tapping <b>on</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> sent to destinations or to attack by tapping on their target. The game world is divided into an isometric grid, with one unit allowed per space. The Nintendo DS's second screen shows {{a map of the}} current mission, including which parts of the map can currently be seen by the player's units and which parts are covered by fog of war. Individual units and enemies are shown on the map in the visible areas.|$|E
5|$|Looking to do {{a family}} film, Johnny Depp visited the Walt Disney Studios in 2001 {{when he heard}} of plans to adapt the Pirates of the Caribbean ride into a film. Depp was excited by the {{possibility}} of reviving an old Hollywood genre, and found the script met his quirky sensibilities: the crew of the Black Pearl were not in search of treasure but trying to return it to lift a curse <b>on</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> the traditional mutiny had already occurred. Depp was cast on June 10, 2002. Producer Jerry Bruckheimer felt Depp would give the film an edge that could draw teenage and adult audiences despite Disney's reputation for soft children's fare.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a {{motorcyclist}} fires {{shots at}} the moving car of Lewis and Falsone; the two narrowly avoid injury and the motorcyclist escapes. Almost immediately afterward, Lewis and Falsone are called to investigate {{the shooting death of}} a woman on a nearby street. At the scene they find Stivers (Toni Lewis), who was speaking to the woman when she was shot; police later conclude Stivers was the real target. While Munch and Kellerman are leaving the hotel, somebody opens fire <b>on</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> shoots Kellerman in the arm. Falsone suggests the shooter is targeting the detectives {{who were involved in the}} previous fatal shooting of drug dealer Luther Mahoney. Kellerman becomes angry when Falsone questions the report of Mahoney's death, which indicates Kellerman shot Mahoney to save Lewis; Falsone said autopsy reports indicate Mahoney was beaten badly.|$|E

5|$|On 5 August, Pash {{received}} a secret message from Washington, D.C., {{reporting that the}} French physicist Frédéric Joliot-Curie had been sighted at his holiday home at L'Arcouest in Brittany. Joliot-Curie {{was at the top}} of Alsos's wanted list, so Pash and CIC Special Agent Gerry Beatson set out to investigate in the wake of the advancing U.S. Third Army. They searched the University of Rennes and found some documents there on 9 August. On 11 August they reached the homes of Joliot-Curie, Francis Perrin, and Pierre Auger in the L'Arcouest area. Joliot-Curie was not home, but German snipers fired <b>on</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> they had to wait until 12 August before they could search the house.|$|E
5|$|Pudús have various {{methods of}} obtaining the foliage they need. Their small stature and {{cautious}} nature create obstacles in attaining food. They stop often while searching for food {{to stand on}} their hind legs and smell the wind, detecting food scents. Females and fawns peel bark from saplings using their teeth, but mature males may use their spikelike antlers. The deer may use their front legs to press down on saplings until they snap or become low enough to the ground so they can reach the leaves. Forced to stand on their hind legs due to their small size, the deer climb branches and tree stumps to reach higher foliage. They bend bamboo shoots horizontally in order to walk <b>on</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> eat from higher branches.|$|E
5|$|Rushing to Fiore's house, Mulder and Scully find Michelle using telekinetic {{powers to}} try to kill Fiore. They prevent her from doing so, and Fiore confesses that he, Felder and Barbala had stolen a large sum of money, {{intending}} to keep it safe for ten years before claiming it. Morris learned of their plan and threatened to report <b>on</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> was consequently killed to silence him. However, Fiore maintains that {{he never wanted to}} see Morris dead and only wanted to take care of Anita after his death. Michelle uses her powers to destroy the fish-tank, but spares Fiore after hearing pleas from Anita not to hurt him. Later, Fiore pleads guilty to charges of murder and grand larceny, whilst Michelle seemingly recovers and goes on to become a normal little girl.|$|E
