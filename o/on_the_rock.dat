Harmonix released a video response to the leak the next day, officially denying the rumored setlist, while once again showing the setlist {{in the background and}} confirming additional songs. The full setlist was formally announced on August 25 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rock</b> Band website.|$|E
5|$|General Ludwig Kübler's XLIX Corps would {{conduct the}} actual attack <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rock.</b> The assault forces would {{comprise}} the Infantry Regiment Großdeutschland, the 98th Regiment of the 1st Mountain Division, 26 medium and heavy artillery battalions, three observation battalions, three engineer battalions, two smoke battalions, a detachment of 150 Brandenburgers, {{and up to}} 150 miniature remote controlled demolition vehicles (Goliaths), packed with high explosives.|$|E
5|$|St Leonard's Tower {{is located}} {{on the edge of the}} village of West Malling, on a {{sandstone}} promontory, overlooking a valley leading down to the river River Medway. The base of the tower rests directly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rock,</b> levelled up with masonry to form a plinth. The tower was probably originally surrounded by service buildings, possibly within a walled enclosure, part of which may survive in the stone wall running from the castle to the north-east.|$|E

5|$|An ugly reef is this of the Dhu Heartach; no {{pleasant}} {{assemblage of}} shelves, and pools, and creeks, about which a child might {{play for a}} whole summer without weariness, like the Bell Rock or the Skerryvore, but one oval nodule of black-trap, sparsely bedabbled with an inconspicuous fucus, and alive in every crevice with a dingy insect between a slater and a bug. No other life was there but of sea-birds, and of the sea itself, that here ran like a mill-race, and growled about the outer reef for ever, and ever and again, in the calmest weather, roared and spouted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rock</b> itself.|$|E
5|$|Beeston {{was built}} by Ranulf de Blondeville, 6th Earl of Chester, as an impregnable stronghold and a symbol of power. The siting of the castle's outer bailey walls was chosen to take {{advantage}} of the fortifications remaining from the earlier Iron Age rampart. In medieval documents the castle is described as Castellum de Rupe, the Castle <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rock.</b> It is one of three major castles built by Ranulph in the 1220s, shortly after his return from the Fifth Crusade. The others are Bolingbroke in Lincolnshire, and Chartley, Staffordshire, both of which share similar architectural features with Beeston; in particular the design of the towers.|$|E
5|$|Daybreaker debuted {{at number}} one on the UK Rock & Metal Albums Chart and at number 42 on the UK Album Charts for selling 3,208 copies.

The next week, the album fell to number 12 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rock</b> & Metal, then to number 33, and it left the chart the {{following}} week. The album debuted on the US Top Heatseekers chart at number 28, selling 1,200 copies in its first week. In Belgium, the album charted at number 182, and in Germany at number 93.|$|E
50|$|Tanstein Castle {{is located}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> two westernmost <b>rock</b> {{outcrops}} of <b>the</b> Dahn castle cluster. Both were originally linked by a bridge. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>rocks</b> today are modern parapet walls {{that have been}} rather arbitrarily added and do not give any real idea of the old castle buildings. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> western <b>rock</b> outcrop there were apparently domestic-like buildings, that were built against <b>the</b> <b>rocks.</b> This is evinced by putlock holes and other marks <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rocks</b> {{as well as a}} large cistern, in which water from the roofs was gathered and stored.|$|R

5|$|Initial {{work began}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rock</b> on 7 August 1838. Stevenson and 21 workmen arrived {{on board the}} sailing vessel Pharos and began to unload the barrack, whose massive legs were set into holes blasted out of the rock. After only two days the site had to be {{abandoned}} as a storm swept in from the Atlantic. It was a further six days before they could resume the punishing schedule of 16 hours a day work between 4am and 8pm. Fearing sea sickness, many of the man preferred to attempt {{to sleep on the}} damp rocks than on the ever-rolling Pharos.|$|E

5|$|Research in the 1960s by Eliécer Silva Celis <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rock</b> art of Sáchica showed phytomorphic designs, masked human figures, {{singular}} and concentric rings, triangulated heads, {{and faces}} where {{the eyes and}} noses were drawn, but the mouths absent. The majority of the petrographs found here are abstract figures. The colours red, black and white dominate the rock paintings in Sáchica. The black has been analysed also at El Infiernito and is though {{to refer to a}} pre-Muisca origin. Radial structures drawn on the heads of the anthropomorphic petrographs are interpreted as feathers. Feathers were precious objects for the Muisca and used by the xeques and caciques during the El Dorado ritual in Lake Guatavita.|$|E

5|$|The Muslim {{presence}} in Gibraltar began on 27 April 711 when the Berber general Tariq ibn-Ziyad led the initial incursion into Iberia {{in advance of}} the main Moorish force under the command of Musa ibn Nusayr, Umayyad governor of Ifriqiya. Gibraltar was named after Tariq, who was traditionally said to have landed on the shores of the Rock of Gibraltar, though it seems more likely that he landed somewhere nearby. Muslim sources claimed that Tariq established some kind of fortification <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rock,</b> but no evidence has been found and it is not considered credible. It was not until 1160 that a first fortified settlement was built there.|$|E
5|$|The {{final season}} {{of work in}} 1843 was spent in fitting out the interior.

The light, which had eight lenses revolving around a four wick lamp with pyramidal lenses above and reflecting prisms below each one, was constructed by John Milne of Edinburgh. The machinery was ready by the beginning of 1844, but it was seven weeks before a landing could be undertaken <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rock.</b> The lamp was finally lit on 1 February and it shone without interruption for the next 110years.|$|E

On 6 April 1944 the first group of 1,367repatriates arrived <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rock</b> directly from the United Kingdom and on 28 May, the first repatriation party left Madeira, and by the end of 1944 only 520non-priority evacuees remained on the island.|$|E
5|$|These Nishidhis {{detail the}} names, dates, the {{duration}} of the vow, and other austerities performed by the person who observed the vow. The earliest Nishidhis (6th to 8th century) mostly have an inscription <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rock</b> without any symbols. This style continued until the 10th century when footprints were added alongside the inscription. After the 11th century, Nishidhis are inscribed on slabs or pillars with panels and symbols. These slabs or pillars were frequently erected in mandapas (pillared pavilions), near basadi (temples), or sometimes as an inscription on the door frame or pillars of the temple.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{arrival in}} the Sweetwater valley, the trail {{encounters}} {{one of the most}} important landmarks on the trail, Independence Rock. Independence Rock was named because settlers tried to reach it by July 4 (Independence Day in the United States) in order to help ensure that they will be at their destinations in California or Oregon before the winter snows come. Many of the travelers left their names <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rock,</b> either carved or painted on with axle grease. It is estimated that more than 50,000 signatures were inscribed on Independence Rock. Other notable landmarks along the Sweetwater valley include Split Rock, Devil's Gate and Martin's Cove, where, in November 1856, the Martin Handcart Company was stranded by heavy snow until a rescue party from Salt Lake City arrived.|$|E
