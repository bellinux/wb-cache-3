5|$|In {{his first}} season of Italian football, Milan failed to win a trophy, and Blomqvist often sat on the bench. He nearly decided against going to Old Trafford {{because he did not}} want a repeat <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>season.</b> The {{defending}} champions had an equally disappointing season, finishing 11th in Serie A and failing to qualify for European football. Blomqvist was subsequently sold to Serie A runners up Parma in the summer of 1997. Blomqvist enjoyed more regular football, although the club finished 6th in the league and missed out on the knockout stages of the Champions League.

5|$|Season eight was {{received}} well by critics but was less warmly received by fans, {{many of whom}} were unhappy that Duchovny reduced his role and that Patrick took over as co-lead alongside Anderson. Ratings for the season were initially strong, but it eventually averaged a total of 13.53 million viewers, down from the seventh season's 14.2 million.

5|$|Aside from a {{tropical}} disturbance in August, the season began later than usual, the fourth consecutive season to do so. At {{the time it}} had the 4th latest start on record for the first named storm. Only about 20% of seasons have their first storm form after the middle of December, and the first named storm <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>season,</b> Ando, did not become {{a tropical}} storm until early January. However, January was active with three tropical cyclones, two of which became intense tropical cyclones, due to the active phase of the Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO). February returned to a period of inactivity, and generally there was minimal convection across the basin due to unusually dry air. This was spread by a powerful and persistent ridge that extended eastward from Madagascar, {{as well as an}} inactive phase of the MJO. Drought conditions occurred on Réunion {{due to the lack of}} rainfall. After three weeks of no tropical cyclones developing worldwide, an event unseen since 1995, the tropics became active again in early April.|$|E

5|$|In 1898, {{he moved}} to Second Division Grimsby Town. Though now playing in the {{professional}} Football League, Chapman was still an amateur at this stage and obtained {{a job with a}} firm of local solicitors to earn his way. Grimsby started the season poorly – they were {{near the bottom of the}} division by Christmas and were beaten 7–0 by Preston North End in the FA Cup, but rallied to finish tenth at the end of the 1898–99 season. By this time Chapman had been dropped from the team, having been unsuccessfully moved to centre forward, an unfamiliar position for him. He was released by Grimsby and drifted down into non-league football with a brief spell at Swindon Town, playing three games and scoring twice, but had to leave the club as he was unable to find a job in the area. He moved on to see out the season with Sheppey United, who finished bottom of the Southern League in 1899–1900. Chapman finished as United's top scorer but was injured at the end <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>season,</b> and still unable to find a job. Disheartened, he returned to his home town and turned out for Worksop Town of the Midland League in 1900–01, while resuming his studies, this time at Old Firth College in Sheffield.|$|E
5|$|Later in August, Tropical Storm Debra {{produced}} widespread effects, though {{damage was}} also relatively minor. Hurricane Ella became the northernmost Category4 hurricane while located at 38°N, and lashed the East Coast of the United States and Atlantic Canada with gusty winds and rip currents. Hurricanes Flossie and Kendra {{as well as}} Tropical Storms Hope, Irma, and Juliet caused minimal land impacts as a tropical cyclone. However, the precursor to Hurricane Kendra caused flooding in Puerto Rico. Hurricane Greta brought strong winds, high tides, and flooding to Central America, particularly Belize and Honduras. Greta resulted in about $25million in damage and at least five fatalities. Overall, the storms <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>season</b> collectively caused $191million in damage and 42fatalities. Hurricane Greta crossed into the eastern pacific and was renamed Olivia.|$|E
5|$|Of the season's four {{tropical}} cyclones, two reached hurricane status. One {{of these}} two strengthened into a major hurricanes, which are Category3 or higher on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. The strongest cyclone of the season, the third hurricane, peaked at Category3 strength, with maximum sustained winds of 120mph (195km/h). Rough seas produced by this storm sunk a ship {{in the vicinity of}} the Lesser Antilles, drowning 10people. The final tropical cyclone was first observed in the southwestern Caribbean Sea on October31. Peaking as a strong Category1 hurricane, it headed westward and made landfall in Nicaragua, before being last noted over Central America on November1. The storm produced only minor damage in Nicaragua. Collectively, the tropical cyclones <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>season</b> resulted in at least $1million in damage and 14confirmed fatalities.|$|E

5|$|On 1 March, Cyclone Erica formed {{offshore}} Queensland {{and strengthened}} {{as it moved}} in a parabolic path, before leaving the Australian region on 12 March. Erica caused only minor damage in Queensland. Cyclone Craig originated offshore Northern Territory on 8 March. The system subsequently struck the territory and eventually made another landfall in Queensland on 12 March, after crossing the Gulf of Carpentaria. Impact from Craig was generally minor. Cyclone Inigo formed on 30 March and caused severe impact in Indonesia, especially in Flores, Sumba, and West Timor. Inigo later deepened into the most intense tropical cyclone on record in the Australian region, tied with Cyclone Gwenda in 1999. Inigo weakened significantly before striking Western Australia on 8 April and dissipating shortly thereafter. The final system, Tropical Cyclone Epi developed east of Papua New Guinea on 5 June and dissipated on the following day. Overall, the tropical cyclones <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>season</b> caused 60deaths and about $12million (2003USD) in damage.|$|E
5|$|The Main Stand of Edgeley Park, {{which in}} 1935 {{was made of}} wood, burned down in a fire, {{destroying}} all of Stockport County's records before 1935. Besides having to rebuild a significant section of the ground, the club had to piece together historical information. The current Main Stand, was built a year later in 1936 and officially opened by Charles Sutcliffe, then President of the Football League. In 1936–37 County won the Third Division North, gaining 60 points and 23 wins. Towards the end <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>season,</b> Stockport had a ten-game unbeaten run that included seven victories before a last-day title decider against Lincoln City {{in which more than}} 27,000 fans watched.

Later that month, Tropical Storm Dorothy caused severe flooding in Martinique, which left up to 51deaths and $34million in damage. One death occurred in Mexico {{as a result of}} Hurricane Ella after a house collapsed. In October, Tropical Depression Fifteen brought a devastating flood to Puerto Rico. At least 22fatalities and $65.5million in damage occurred. Collectively, the storms <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>season</b> left at least $1.03billion in damage and 115deaths.|$|E
