Although {{numbers are}} {{difficult}} to ascertain, {{it is widely believed}} that individuals in wealthy nations unlawfully evade tax through not declaring gains made by offshore vehicles that they own.

5000|$|Whether a {{financial}} centre {{is to be}} characterized as [...] "offshore" [...] {{is a question of}} degree. Indeed, the IMF Working Paper cited above notes that its definition of an <b>offshore</b> <b>centre</b> would include the United Kingdom and the United States, which are ordinarily counted as [...] "onshore" [...] because of their large populations and inclusion in international organisations such as the G20 and OECD.|$|R
5000|$|The term <b>offshore</b> {{financial}} <b>centre</b> is {{a relatively}} modern neologism, first coined in the 1980s. [...] Although the terms are not synonymous, many leading <b>offshore</b> finance <b>centres</b> are regarded as [...] "tax havens", {{and the lack of}} precise definition often leads to confusion between the concepts. In Tolley's International Initiatives Affecting Financial Havens the glossary of terms defines an [...] "offshore financial centre" [...] in forthright terms as [...] "a politically correct term for {{what used to be called}} a tax haven." [...] However, this is qualified by adding [...] "The use of this term makes the important point that a jurisdiction may provide specific facilities for <b>offshore</b> financial <b>centres</b> without being in any general sense a tax haven." ...|$|R

50|$|<b>Offshore</b> <b>centres</b> {{benefit from}} a low burden of regulation. An {{extremely}} high proportion of hedge funds (which characteristically employ high risk investment strategies) who register offshore are presumed {{to be driven by}} lighter regulatory requirements rather than perceived tax benefits.

5000|$|Recently, {{several studies}} have {{examined}} the impact of offshore financial centres on the world economy more broadly, finding the high degree of competition between banks in such jurisdictions to increase liquidity in nearby onshore markets.

5000|$|In 2000 the FATF began {{a policy}} of {{assessing}} the cooperation of all countries in programmes against money laundering. Considerable tightening up of both regulation and implementation was noted by the FATF over subsequent years (see generally FATF Blacklist).

50|$|Low-tax {{financial}} centres {{are becoming increasingly}} important as conduits for investment into emerging markets. For instance, 44% of foreign direct investment (FDI) into India came through Mauritius last year, while over two thirds of FDI into Brazil came through <b>offshore</b> <b>centres.</b> Blanco & Rogers find {{a positive correlation between}} proximity to an offshore centre and investment for least developed countries (LDCs); a $1 increase in FDI to an offshore centre translates to an average increase of $0.07 in FDI for nearby developing countries.|$|E
50|$|<b>Offshore</b> <b>centres</b> act as {{conduits}} {{for global}} trade and ease international capital flows. International joint ventures are often structured as companies in an offshore jurisdiction when neither {{party in the}} venture party wishes to form the company in the other party's home jurisdiction {{in order to avoid}} paying taxes there. Although most offshore financial centres still charge little or no tax, the increasing sophistication of onshore tax codes has meant that there is often little tax benefit relative to the cost of moving a transaction structure offshore.|$|E
5000|$|Although most <b>offshore</b> {{financial}} <b>centres</b> originally rose {{to prominence}} by facilitating structures which helped to minimise exposure to tax, tax avoidance {{has played a}} decreasing role {{in the success of}} <b>offshore</b> financial <b>centres</b> in recent years. Most professional practitioners in offshore jurisdictions refer to themselves as [...] "tax neutral" [...] since, whatever tax burdens the proposed transaction or structure will have in its primary operating market, having the structure based in an offshore jurisdiction will not create any additional tax burdens.|$|R
