50|$|Interpretation {{is related}} to perceiving the things.

There may be different interpretations to same work by art by different people owing to their different perceptions or aims. All such interpretations are termed as 'aesthetic interpretations'.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{identity}} in the world <b>of</b> <b>art</b> is relevant from many perspectives. This paper aims at discussing the identity <b>of</b> the <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>art.</b> The discussion is built in three steps: the problem of identification <b>of</b> an object as <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>art,</b> the problem <b>of</b> the relevant properties <b>of</b> a <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>art</b> {{and the question of}} the author <b>of</b> the <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>art</b> as decisive (or not) for the identification <b>of</b> a <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>art.</b> These issues are raised with the evolution of artistic practice and art theory in the last century. The appearing of the “ready-made” destabilized the firm identity <b>of</b> a <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>art</b> and now we have to decide what the difference is between a <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>art</b> and its perceptually identical pair. Traditionally relevant perceptual features lost their importance in conceptual art, so we have to decide what relevant properties belong, even today, to <b>works</b> <b>of</b> <b>art.</b> Finally, the practice of appropriation in postmodern art challenges the notion of the artist and of the meaning of genuine creation...|$|R
