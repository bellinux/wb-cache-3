This has motivated several researchers to propose estimators and tests concerning the co-efficient <b>of</b> <b>variation</b> <b>of</b> normal distribution(s). While proposing a class of estimators for the co-efficient <b>of</b> <b>variation</b> <b>of</b> a finite population, Tripathi et al., (2002) suggested that the estimator <b>of</b> co-efficient <b>of</b> <b>variation</b> <b>of</b> a finite population {{can also be used}} as an estimator of C.

5|$|Different {{traditions and}} genres of poetry {{tend to use}} {{different}} meters, ranging from the Shakespearean iambic pentameter and the Homeric dactylic hexameter to the anapestic tetrameter used in many nursery rhymes. However, a number <b>of</b> <b>variations</b> to the established meter are common, both to provide emphasis or attention to a given foot or line and to avoid boring repetition. For example, the stress in a foot may be inverted, a caesura (or pause) may be added (sometimes {{in place of a}} foot or stress), or the final foot in a line may be given a feminine ending to soften it or be replaced by a spondee to emphasize it and create a hard stop. Some patterns (such as iambic pentameter) tend to be fairly regular, while other patterns, such as dactylic hexameter, tend to be highly irregular. Regularity can vary between language. In addition, different patterns often develop distinctively in different languages, so that, for example, iambic tetrameter in Russian will generally reflect a regularity in the use of accents to reinforce the meter, which does not occur, or occurs to a much lesser extent, in English.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{illustrates}} {{the design of}} a nonlinear filter for edge-enhancing smoothing of multiplicative noise using a morphology-based filter structure. This filter is called the Minimum Coefficient <b>of</b> <b>Variation</b> (MCV) filter. The coefficient <b>of</b> <b>variation</b> is the ratio of the standard deviation of a random process to its mean. For an image corrupted only by stationary multiplicative noise, the coefficient <b>of</b> <b>variation</b> is theoretically constant at every point. Estimates of the coefficient <b>of</b> <b>variation</b> indicate whether a region is approximately constant beneath the multiplicative noise or whether it contains significant image features. Regions containing edges or other image features yield higher estimates of the coefficient <b>of</b> <b>variation</b> than areas that are roughly constant.

5|$|I. Allegro. The opening is dramatic, with a fully voiced forte C minor chord. The voice-leading of {{this passage}} {{outlines}} a chromatic ascent to A-flat – {{this will be}} the first instance of a remarkable degree of chromaticism in the sonata as a whole. The most salient feature of the first theme is the sudden modulatory digression to A-flat major, established by a rushing downward scale initiated by the final achievement of this key in the ascending voice of the minor theme. The exposition shifts from the tonic to the relative major (E-flat major), touching midway upon its parallel minor (E-flat minor), all in accordance with Classical practice. This second theme, a hymn-like E-flat major melody in four-part harmony, greatly contrasts with the first, though its melodic contour is prefigured in the sudden A-flat major departure. Both themes progress somewhat in the style <b>of</b> <b>variations,</b> and are structured with irregular phrase lengths. The development section is highly chromatic, and is texturally and melodically distinct from the exposition. The recapitulation is once again traditional, staying in the tonic and stressing subdominant tonalities (D-flat, the lowered second degree – in the first theme). The coda returns to the material of the development section, but with stable tonality, dying out in a dark series of cadences in low register.|$|E
5|$|Studies <b>of</b> <b>variations</b> in {{mitochondrial}} DNA indicate {{low levels}} of genetic divergence among bog turtle colonies. This is unusual in species such as the bog turtle, which have fragmented distributions and exist in small isolated groups (fewer than 50 individuals in bog turtle colonies). These conditions limit gene flow, typically leading to divergence between isolated groups. Data indicate that the bog turtle suffered dramatic reductions in numbers – a population bottleneck – as colonies were forced south {{in the face of}} glaciation. Receding glaciers led to the relatively recent post-Pleistocene expansion, as the bog turtles moved back into their former northern range. This recent colonization from a relatively limited southern population may account for the reduction of genetic diversity. The northern and southern populations are at present genetically isolated, likely as a consequence of farming and habitat destruction in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley during the American Civil War.|$|E

The use of ultrasonography has allowed a number <b>of</b> <b>variations</b> to be shown at this level; when no contact is made with the popliteal vein it might be seen to drain in the GSV, at a variable level; or, it may merge with the Giacomini vein and drain in the GSV at the superior 1/3 of the thigh. It can also but rarely, drain in the vein of the semimembranosus (thigh muscle) (shown below). Usually though, it connects with a perforator vein at its middle 1/3.
