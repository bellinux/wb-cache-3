5|$|Hagenbeck's modern zoo {{techniques}} proved effective, and Edinburgh quickly {{gained a}} reputation for its good animal conditions. 1934 saw the births in captivity <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sea</b> lion and beaver, and in 1936 a baby chimpanzee followed. A litter of wolves was born in 1938, and soon afterwards the first orangutan to be born in Britain.|$|E
5|$|Similarities between Assipatle's {{defeat of}} the monster and other dragon-slayer tales, {{including}} Herakles' destruction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sea</b> monster to save Hesione, have been noted by several authors.

50|$|Developed by Nicola Sabbatini, {{the machine}} was an {{effective}} way to give the appearance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> wave-filled <b>sea.</b> It was used to great effect through the following centuries.

5|$|In the whaleboat, Melville had, like De Long, ridden out {{the storm}} by means <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sea</b> anchor. The boat's course was far {{to the south of}} De Long's; they finally reached land at one of the main mouths of the Lena, and were able to {{navigate}} upriver. Within a few days they encountered a native fishing camp, and by September 25 had reached the settlement of Arrhu. Chipp's cutter never reached land; overwhelmed by the storm, it presumably foundered, with the loss of all eight on board.|$|E
5|$|The clip {{opens with}} a shot <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sea,</b> and Stan laying on a rock {{with a pair of}} white boots {{designed}} with her name on them. Subsequently, she is seen dancing in a place sprayed with graffiti and sporting an orange swimsuit paired with a bright blue jacket. Next, while a few males are playing basketball in front of her, she is portrayed watching and interacting with them while wearing a khaki jacket with denim short shorts, a white vest top and white shoes. After the singer and the others further walk through their surrounding and perform to the track, the visual ends with Stan leaning on a wall from the beginning.|$|E
5|$|The {{replacement}} of the Fleet Air Arm's Sea King fleet commenced faster than initially planned following the loss <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Sea</b> King during a humanitarian aid mission in Indonesia in April 2005, resulting in nine deaths. Investigators uncovered serious faults in {{the condition of the}} Sea King's mechanical flight control system, resulting from maintenance deficiencies. In May 2007, the six remaining Sea Kings were grounded for two months following the discovery of a number of missing parts.|$|E

5|$|A {{significant}} portion of the game is spent sailing between islands on Link's boat, the King of Red Lions. The boat's sail is driven by wind that blows across the game world in one of eight directions; a tailwind behind the boat will give it top speed, while sailing against the wind is difficult. The Great Sea features different enemies and obstacles than appear on land. Some items serve new purposes on the King of Red Lions; for instance, the grappling hook serves as a crane for recovering sunken treasure. Link explores the sea with the help <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sea</b> chart, which can be updated with information on each square and island. Through the game, Link acquires additional charts pointing the way to treasure chests and significant locations. On land, dungeons feature similar maps.|$|E
5|$|At {{the scale}} of living cells, foam {{patterns}} are common; radiolarians, sponge spicules, silicoflagellate exoskeletons and the calcite skeleton <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sea</b> urchin, Cidaris rugosa, all resemble mineral casts of Plateau foam boundaries. The skeleton of the Radiolarian, Aulonia hexagona, a beautiful marine form drawn by Ernst Haeckel, {{looks as if it}} is a sphere composed wholly of hexagons, but this is mathematically impossible. The Euler characteristic states that for any convex polyhedron, the number of faces plus the number of vertices (corners) equals the number of edges plus two. A result of this formula is that any closed polyhedron of hexagons has to include exactly 12 pentagons, like a soccer ball, Buckminster Fuller geodesic dome, or fullerene molecule. This can be visualised by noting that a mesh of hexagons is flat like a sheet of chicken wire, but each pentagon that is added forces the mesh to bend (there are fewer corners, so the mesh is pulled in).|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} known {{for more than a century}} that {{consumption}} of raw or insufficiently cooked shellfish can be associated with infectious diseases. These are caused either by bacteria naturally present in the sea such as Vibrio spp. or by viruses and bacteria from sewage effluent that sometimes contaminates coastal waters. As filter feeders, bivalves pass large quantities of water through their gills, filtering out the organic particles, including the microbial pathogens. These are retained in the animals' tissues and become concentrated in their liver-like digestive glands. Another possible source of contamination occurs when bivalves contain marine biotoxins as a result of ingesting numerous dinoflagellates. These microalgae are not associated with sewage but occur unpredictably as algal blooms. Large areas <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sea</b> or lake may change colour as a result of the proliferation of millions of single-cell algae, and this condition is known as a red tide.|$|E

5|$|Mersea Fort, {{also known}} as Cudmore Grove Blockhouse, was an {{artillery}} fort established by Henry VIII on the East Mersea coast in 1543. It formed part of the King's Device programme to protect against invasion from France and the Holy Roman Empire, and defended the River Colne {{that led to the}} town of Colchester. It was triangular in shape, with earthwork walls and three bastions to hold artillery. It was demobilised in 1552, but was brought back into use several times over the next century and saw service during the Second English Civil War of 1648. The fort hosted an admiralty court to oversea the local oyster trade, until the dilapidation of the site forced the court to move to the Moot Hall in Colchester {{in the middle of the}} 18th century. A new gun battery was built at the fort during the Napoleonic Wars, but the fortification then fell into decline and was extensively damaged by the construction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sea</b> wall along the coast. The remains of the earthworks were excavated by archaeologists between 2002 and 2003.|$|E
5|$|When {{his brother}} and {{sister-in-law}} were forced to move for business reasons, he bought his own house at 328 Mickle Street (now 330 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard). First {{taken care of by}} tenants, he was completely bedridden for {{most of his time in}} Mickle Street. During this time, he began socializing with Mary Oakes Davis—the widow <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sea</b> captain. She was a neighbor, boarding with a family in Bridge Avenue just a few blocks from Mickle Street. She moved in with Whitman on February 24, 1885, to serve as his housekeeper in exchange for free rent. She brought with her a cat, a dog, two turtledoves, a canary, and other assorted animals. During this time, Whitman produced further editions of Leaves of Grass in 1876, 1881, and 1889.|$|E
