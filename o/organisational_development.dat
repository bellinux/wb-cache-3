In order to do this, the <b>organisational</b> design, <b>development</b> and change management practitioner {{must be able to}} manage customers, competition, change, relationships and processes. There is a need to understand the impacts of successful <b>organisational</b> design, <b>development</b> and change management implementations as they influence the success of an organisation. The aim {{of this study is to}} explore practitioners’ knowledge and experiences of <b>organisational</b> design, <b>development</b> and change management implementation. The objectives included explorations of practitioners’ experiences working on <b>organisational</b> design, <b>development</b> and change management implementations. The study is qualitative, exploratory research. Data was collected by means of face-to-face interviews guided by a semi structured interview schedule. Participants’ were practitioners working in the field of <b>organisational</b> design, <b>development</b> and change management. The study used non-probability (non-random) purposive, snowball sampling. The data was analysed using thematic content analysis to identify themes and sub themes in the data. The findings indicate what <b>organisational</b> design, <b>development</b> and change management involves, what the benefits are and the successes and challenges practitioners have encountered during implementation. The macroeconomic environment in which organisations operate is ever changing and in order to keep up, organisations need to call on experienced practitioners to assist in managing the change. The implications of the results will assist the industry as well as organisations to understand the value <b>organisational</b> design, <b>development</b> and change management implementations in enabling business strategies and driving organizations to achieve its business objective thus promoting and growing the discipline and practice. These insights will also contribute to the discipline and the availability of such data will assist future practitioners to be more effective in their roles...|$|R

40|$|<b>Organisational</b> policy <b>development</b> {{is vital}} for the {{effective}} business operations. Polices are developed and applied to specific areas or applications within the organisation; such that they are sited within an organisational context. Evidence suggests {{that the development of}} policies for general employment conditions, (for example, electronic mail usage), tends to be highly structured and provide little flexibility for their implementation. Standard <b>organisational</b> policy <b>development</b> is about applying a set of rules in the workplace. However, when implementing social media in an organisation, the standard policy development processes are not effective in allowing organisations to benefit from the available social media tools. Social media tools have the advantages of offering the organisation flexibility and rapid dispersion of information within the online environment. Hence, <b>organisational</b> policy <b>development</b> for social media usage needs to take these characteristics into account. There is a perceived gap concerning the development of policies for social media usage, as traditional <b>organisational</b> policy <b>development</b> enforces structure and rules that are at odds with the ways social media tools work in the organisation. To fill this gap, we have proposed the Social Media and Organisation Policy (SOMEOP) framework, created to allow organisations to build policies that take specific social media advantages or issues into consideration.

40|$|Employees are {{increasingly}} concerned of managing their own career {{and are thus}} becoming less loyal. However, to stay competitive organisations need to retain their best talents. The present study {{examined the relationship between}} <b>organisational</b> support for <b>development</b> and intentions to turnover, as well as affective commitment. Previous research has indicated inconsistent results between employee development and turnover, suggesting that <b>organisational</b> support for <b>development</b> might increase or decrease intentions to turnover. In addition, studies have implied that it is required to include mediating factors to explain the relationship. The relationship between <b>organisational</b> support for <b>development</b> and intention to turnover was assumed to be mediated by employability and moderated by perceived career opportunities. Psychological contract breach and career success were tested as mediators in the relationship between <b>organisational</b> support for <b>development</b> and affective commitment. The hypotheses were investigated in a sample of 961 managerial and non-managerial employees in an engineering company in Norway. A moderated mediation model and multiple mediation model were applied to analyse the data. Results indicated that <b>organisational</b> support for <b>development</b> is essential in promoting intentions to stay and affective commitment. A partial moderated mediation of perceived career opportunities (moderator) and employability (mediator) was established. Unexpectedly, perceived career opportunities increased intentions to turnover. Career success and psychological contract breach partially mediated the relationship between <b>organisational</b> support for <b>development</b> and <b>organisational</b> commitment. These results contribute to enhance knowledge about how <b>organisational</b> support for <b>development</b> improve retention and should be considered an important strategy in the organisation’s retention management...|$|R

40|$|Abstract <b>Organisational</b> {{capacity}} <b>development</b> in {{an international}} Non-Government Organisation (NG 0) is a complex process of change going beyond accomplishing technical skills. NGOs are important actors in global efforts for development and humanitarian interventions, yet their internal operations are inadequately understood. The study aimed to generate contextualised understanding of the organisational outcomes of combining development and humanitarian sexual and reproductive health and rights practice {{in an international}} NGO. The exploration is a grounded case study built on a cross-disciplinary approach which begins with a personal journey to better understand and manage NGO capacity development and change. The data, comprising predominantly of 129 interviews, observations and hundreds of documents was gathered during 36 months of fieldwork, explored the implementation of of a humanitarian project as it was conceptualised, housed and implemented by a development NGO. The original focus was on <b>organisational</b> capacity <b>development</b> and change; seeking {{to understand how the}} organisation dealt with integrating the new humanitarian practice. However the research based on the unique insight gained from the in-depth study revealed much about the inner operations and negotiation processes within NGOs. The findings indicate a need for refining and contextualising our understanding of <b>organisational</b> capacity <b>development</b> and <b>organisational</b> change in <b>development</b> NGOs. This research contributes to building an appreciation of the political aspects of development work and humanitarian interventions that takes into account the ability of the organisation to commit, engage and create internal legitimacy for the new practice...|$|R
