Nellie is an 0-4-0 saddle tank industrial locomotive 1435, {{one of two}} built by Hudswell Clarke in Leeds in 1922 for the Esholt sewage works. When the works were being built, she carried excavated material, and thereafter coal and construction material, then coal and other materials until 1970 when she was loaned to the Yorkshire Dales Railway Society at Skipton. Her size is ca.23 x 8 x 11ft, and she weighs 28 tons. The boiler works at 160psi, and she carries 700 gallons in the saddle water tank. The cylinders are 40-inch diameter 20-inch stroke operated by Stephenson's <b>open</b> <b>link</b> valve gear. A British Railways Crane Wagon is on display outside near the museum gates.|$|E

To offset this risk, plans were announced to mobilize teams to reclaim Highway 340 that in parts was under up to a meter of water.|$|E

After the Sea Defence Project is finished, the lagoon has regained economic significance. The lagoon was dredged and an <b>open</b> <b>link</b> was created with the ocean to enable shrimps to swim into the lagoon.

The {{article is based on}} a study focusing on informal carers of people with health and/or social problems. The objectives were to gain knowledge of informal carers’ responsibilities and tasks, burdens and strain, as well as their collaboration with the Health Care Services. Information about the study was disseminated through Facebook and various web sites in autumn 2011, with an <b>Open</b> <b>Link</b> to a questionnaire.   94 women and 14 men participated in the study, 47. 3 % of whom had a third level education and about 80 % had been informal carers for over six years. The majority of respondents were informal carers of people suffering from mental illness, alcohol or drug abuse. Most of the respondents reported that collaboration with the health services was of major importance.   The main focus of this article is {{the possibilities}} and challenges involved in using <b>Open</b> <b>Link</b> in terms of the sample and credibility of the data. </p...|$|E

This <b>open</b> <b>link</b> was distributed via relevant listservs (e.g., physics modeling, Arizona State University science faculty). Individuals were encouraged to share the link with other instructors in their discipline. Finally, snowball sampling was used to identify additional respondents. During the survey, the respondents were asked from whom they had learned about SCALE-UP and whom they told about SCALE-UP, including a contact person in their department.

The proposed simulation model can be said to be mathematically exact, thus this approach enables the essential investigation for control algorithms of biped locomotion. This approach has advantages in the less cost compared with the experimental demonstration. Second, the autonomous walking control with hier archical structure has been proposed in which three dimensional inverted pendulum model is considered as the motion of gravity center, and the tip position of non-support leg are controlled autonomously. Both of references can be simultaneously transformed to the joint space reference, then they are accurately realized by the robust-servo controller. Third, the proposed walking control is investigated by the proposed simulation method, and the stable walking motion is conformed...|$|E
