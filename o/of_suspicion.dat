5|$|After {{the end of}} the campaign, Galland {{claimed to}} be {{suffering}} from rheumatism and therefore unfit for flying in open-cockpit aircraft, such as the Hs 123. He tactfully suggested a transfer to a single-engine aircraft type with a closed cockpit would improve his condition. His request was accepted on medical grounds. Galland was removed from his post as a direct ground support pilot. Galland never explained whether open cockpits had caused the complaint or some other cause; given his performance with eye specialists, a certain amount <b>of</b> <b>suspicion</b> is reasonable. He was transferred to Jagdgeschwader 27 (JG 27â€”Fighter Wing 27) on 10 February 1940 as the adjutant, restricting him from flying.|$|E

5|$|Carl Probyn {{witnessed}} the abduction of his stepdaughter from {{within sight of}} their home. He saw two people in a mid-sized gray carpossibly a Mercury Monarchmake a U-turn at the school bus stop where Dugard was waiting, and a woman forcing Dugard into the car. Probyn gave chase on a bicycle, {{but was unable to}} overtake the vehicle. Some of Dugard's classmates were also witnesses to the abduction. Initial suspects included Probyn and Slayton, though they did not know each other and Slayton had only had a brief relationship with Terry in 1979, not knowing he had a child. When Dugard was rescued, Slayton expressed an interest in meeting his daughter and taking a paternity test. Dugard refused. Probyn took and passed several polygraph tests, and Slayton was also quickly cleared <b>of</b> <b>suspicion.</b>|$|E
5|$|He {{also said}} that the {{situation}} had been looked at in the wrong way by police, members of parliament and the security services; rather than asking if Profumo had committed adultery they should have asked if his conduct had led ordinary people to believe he committed adultery. His analogy was with divorce law; a man does not need to have committed adultery for his wife to have grounds to divorce him, but rather she simply has to believe that he has committed adultery. This is because such a belief would destroy the trust and confidence within the relationship. This brought criticism from several government ministers including Sir John Hobson, the Attorney-General for England and Wales, saying that it would mean condemning a man on the basis <b>of</b> <b>suspicion</b> rather than evidence.|$|E
5|$|The Department of Justice started {{keeping a}} list of {{organizations}} that it deemed subversive beginning in 1942. This list was first made public in 1948, when it included 78 items. At its longest, it comprised 154 organizations, 110 of them identified as Communist. In {{the context of a}} loyalty review, membership in a listed organization was meant to raise a question, but not to be considered proof of disloyalty. One of the most common causes <b>of</b> <b>suspicion</b> was membership in the Washington Bookshop Association, a left-leaning organization that offered lectures on literature, classical music concerts and discounts on books.|$|E

5|$|Due to a miscommunication, the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia (MPDC) {{failed to}} follow its own search {{parameters}} in Rock Creek Park, leaving Levy's body to decompose for a year. Furthermore, the MPDC had been informed, and soon dismissed, that Ingmar Guandique, already arrested for attacking women in Rock Creek Park, had confessed to attacking Levy. The MPDC instead put {{much of its}} focus on the revelation that Levy {{was having an affair}} with Congressman Gary Condit, a married Democrat then serving his fifth term representing California's 18th congressional district, and a senior member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Condit had an overwhelming alibi (he was in meetings with the Vice President), was never named as a suspect by police and was eventually cleared of any involvement in the disappearance. However, due to the cloud <b>of</b> <b>suspicion</b> raised by the intense media focus on the missing intern and the later revelation of the affair, Condit lost his bid for re-election in 2002.|$|E
5|$|In November, Elizabeth Kloepfer, {{having read}} that young women were now disappearing in towns {{surrounding}} Salt Lake City, called King County police a second time. Detective Randy Hergesheimer of the Major Crimes division interviewed her in detail. By then, Bundy had risen considerably on the King County hierarchy <b>of</b> <b>suspicion,</b> but the Lake Sammamish witness considered most reliable by detectives failed to identify {{him from a}} photo lineup. In December, Kloepfer called the Salt Lake County Sheriff's Office and repeated her suspicions. Bundy's name was added to their list of suspects, {{but at that time}} no credible evidence linked him to the Utah crimes. In January 1975 Bundy returned to Seattle after his final exams and spent a week with Kloepfer, who did not tell him that she had reported him to police on three separate occasions. She made plans to visit him in Salt Lake City in August.|$|E
5|$|The Song {{judicial}} system retained {{most of the}} legal code of the earlier Tang dynasty, the basis of traditional Chinese law up until the modern era. Roving sheriffs maintained {{law and order in}} the municipal jurisdictions and occasionally ventured into the countryside. Official magistrates overseeing court cases were not only expected to be well-versed in written law but also to promote morality in society. Magistrates such as the famed Bao Qingtian (999â€“1062) embodied the upright, moral judge who upheld justice and never {{failed to live up to}} his principles. Song judges specified the guilty person or party in a criminal act and meted out punishments accordingly, often in the form of caning. A guilty individual or parties brought to court for a criminal or civil offense were not viewed as wholly innocent until proven otherwise, while even accusers were viewed with a high level <b>of</b> <b>suspicion</b> by the judge. Due to costly court expenses and immediate jailing of those accused of criminal offences, people in the Song preferred to settle disputes and quarrels privately, without the court's interference.|$|E

5|$|The gold {{standard}} test for biliary obstruction is still {{endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography}} (ERCP). This {{involves the use of}} endoscopy (passing a tube through the mouth into the esophagus, stomach and thence to the duodenum) to pass a small cannula into the bile duct. At that point, radiocontrast is injected to opacify the duct, and X-rays are taken to get a visual impression of the biliary system. On the endoscopic image of the ampulla, one can sometimes see a protuberant ampulla from an impacted gallstone in the common bile duct or the frank extrusion of pus from the common bile duct orifice. On the X-ray images (known as cholangiograms), gallstones are visible as non-opacified areas in the contour of the duct. For diagnostic purposes, ERCP has now generally been replaced by MRCP. ERCP is only used first-line in critically ill patients in whom delay for diagnostic tests is not acceptable; however, if the index <b>of</b> <b>suspicion</b> for cholangitis is high, an ERCP is typically done to achieve drainage of the obstructed common bile duct.|$|E
5|$|Although the Russians {{were quick}} {{to come to the}} aid of the British, the Anglo-Russian {{relationship}} was fraught with an underlying sense of distrust rooted in a long-standing history of competition. Just decades before the mutiny of 1915, Russia and Britain were already locked in imperialist rivalry. Spurred by the last tsar's Asiatic Mission and his visit to South East Asia as part of his world tour of 1891, the Russian government appointed its first ethnic-Russian Consul, V. Vyvodtsev, to Singapore as early as 1890. The Russian presence in Southeast Asia during the last quarter of the 19th century was meant not only to safeguard its economic and strategic position in China but also to carefully observe the designs and advances of its imperialist rivals in the region, foremost among them being the British empire. Anglo-Russian relationship took a turn for the worst during the latter half of the 19th century when both Britain and Russia were locked in competition for Afghanistan and Persia as well as when Britain halted Russian advancement into the Balkans and Turkey. Britainâ€™s alignment with Japan as ally worsened Anglo-Russian relationship with the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese war of 1904-05. This history <b>of</b> <b>suspicion</b> and rivalry explains why Rospopov sent a secret telegram on 21 February expressing his reservations at placing the Orel and its accompanying men and guns under the command of the British military in Singapore. Eventually the French admiral was able to assuage the fears of Rospopov and assured him that Russian aid at this point would serve as a good means to strengthen Anglo-Russian relation. When the mutiny was finally quelled, the Russian captain Vinokurov reportedly remarked to the British Governor to Singapore that the Russian assistance in suppressing the mutiny â€˜â€™would unite the two countries better than any treatyâ€™â€™.|$|E
5|$|On July 19, after a 21 at-bat hitless streak, Bonds hit 2 home runs, numbers 752 and 753, {{against the}} Chicago Cubs. He went 3â€“3 with 2 home runs, 6 RBIs, and {{a walk on}} that day. The {{struggling}} last place Giants still lost the game, 9â€“8. On July 27, Bonds hit home run 754 against Florida Marlins pitcher Rick VandenHurk. Bonds was then walked his next 4 at-bats in the game, but a 2-run shot helped the Giants win the game 12â€“10. It {{marked the first time}} since he had hit #747 that Bonds had homered in a game the Giants won. On August 4, Bonds hit a 382foot(116m) home run against Clay Hensley of the San Diego Padres for home run number 755, tying Hank Aaron's all-time record. Bonds greeted his son, Nikolai, with an extended bear hug after crossing home plate. Bonds greeted his teammates and then his wife, Liz Watson, and daughter Aisha Lynn behind the backstop. Hensley was the 445th different pitcher to give up a home run to Bonds. Ironically, given the cloud <b>of</b> <b>suspicion</b> that surrounded Bonds, the tying home run was hit off a pitcher who had been suspended by baseball in 2005 for steroid use. He was walked in his next at bat and eventually scored on a fielder's choice.|$|E
