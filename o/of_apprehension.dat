5|$|The {{house on}} Hadley Common was a citadel of riotous insolvency—not just at Christmas but every weekend. There {{was a great}} sense of {{in-depth}} back-up, a cellar, a barrel of malt whisky, a walk-in larder: proof against snowstorm or shutdown. I think it was that Christmas morning , that all four Amises, with breakfast trays on their laps, watched Journey to the Centre of the Earth—then the visit to the pub, then the day-long, the week-long lunch. And with Kingsley the hub of all humour and high spirits, like an engine of comedy... I felt so secure in that house—and, clearly, so insecure elsewhere—that I always experienced a caress <b>of</b> <b>apprehension</b> as I climbed into the car on Sunday night, any Sunday night, and headed back to the motorway and Monday, to the flat or the flatlet, the street, the job, the tramp dread, the outside world.|$|E
5|$|Three {{weeks after}} Cao Qin's failed uprising, the Mongol leader Bolai, {{who had been}} staging raids into {{northern}} China, sent an embassy into China to request formal tribute relations and {{to serve as a}} vassal to the Ming. News of this rebellion reached the Joseon court of Korea by September 9, while the Korean official in charge of the report perhaps embellished the level of gore and violence by stating that tens of thousands had died and the three days of pouring rain following the rebellion flooded even the Forbidden City with streams of blood and rain. A native rebellion would not threaten the capital city again until the fall of Beijing to the army of Li Zicheng in 1644, marking the end of the dynasty and, shortly after, the beginning of Manchu conquest. Until the conquest of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, Chinese officials continued to show a large degree <b>of</b> <b>apprehension</b> over Mongols in military service to the Ming, and still favored relocation schemes. However, Cao's rebellion marked the last event when Ming Mongols were of great importance to court affairs; although many Mongol officers retained hereditary titles of noble lineage, the nobility within the military command structure declined as a whole while men from more humble origins eventually displaced them.|$|E

25|$|Shyness (also called diffidence) is {{the feeling}} <b>of</b> <b>apprehension,</b> lack of comfort, or awkwardness {{especially}} {{when a person is}} around other people. This commonly occurs in new situations or with unfamiliar people. Shyness can be a characteristic of people who have low self-esteem. Stronger forms of shyness are usually referred to as social anxiety or social phobia.|$|E
25|$|Gary Becker, for example, {{acknowledged}} {{that many people}} operate under a high moral and ethical constraint but considered that criminals rationally see {{that the benefits of}} their crime outweigh the cost such as the probability <b>of</b> <b>apprehension,</b> conviction, punishment, as well as their current set of opportunities. From the public policy perspective, since the cost of increasing the fine is marginal to that of the cost of increasing surveillance, one can conclude that the best policy is to maximize the fine and minimize surveillance.|$|E
25|$|This term {{refers to}} signs that {{represent}} by resemblance, such as portraits and some paintings though {{they can also}} be natural or mathematical. Iconicity is independent of actual connection, even if it occurs because of actual connection. An icon is or embodies a possibility, insofar as its object need not actually exist. A photograph is regarded as an icon because of its resemblance to its object, but is regarded as an index (with icon attached) because of its actual connection to its object. Likewise, with a portrait painted from life. An icon's resemblance is objective and independent of interpretation, but is relative to some mode <b>of</b> <b>apprehension</b> such as sight. An icon need not be sensory; anything can serve as an icon, for example a streamlined argument (itself a complex symbol) is often used as an icon for an argument (another symbol) bristling with particulars.|$|E

25|$|The {{attempt to}} render the laws of reason or thought impersonal by professing to find them {{in the sphere of}} {{spontaneous}} apperception, and above reflective necessity, is unsuccessful. Cause, substance, time, space, are given us as realized in a particular form. In no single act of affirmation of cause or substance, much less in such a primitive act, do we affirm the universality of their application. There may be particular instances or cases of these laws, but we could never get the laws themselves in their universality, far less absolute impersonality. No amount of individual instances of the application of any of them by us would give it a true universality. The only sure test we have of their universality in our experience is the test of their reflective necessity. We thus after all fall back on reflection as our ground for their universal application; mere spontaneity <b>of</b> <b>apprehension</b> is futile; their universality is grounded in their necessity, not their necessity in their universality. How far and in what sense this ground of necessity renders them personal are of course questions still to be solved.|$|E
25|$|Xenocrates {{recognized}} three {{grades of}} cognition, each appropriated to {{a region of}} its own: knowledge, sensation, and opinion. He referred knowledge (episteme) to that essence which {{is the object of}} pure thought, and is not included in the phenomenal world; sensation (aisthesis) to that which passes into the world of phenomena; opinion (doxa) to that essence which is at once the object of sensuous perception, and, mathematically, of pure reason - the essence of heaven or the stars; so that he conceived of doxa in a higher sense, and endeavoured, more definitely than Plato, to exhibit mathematics as mediating between knowledge and sensuous perception. All three modes <b>of</b> <b>apprehension</b> partake of truth; but in what manner scientific perception (epistemonike aisthesis) did so, we unfortunately do not learn. Even here Xenocrates's preference for symbolic modes of sensualising or denoting appears: he connected the above three stages of knowledge with the three Fates: Atropos, Clotho, and Lachesis. We know nothing further about the mode in which Xenocrates carried out his dialectic, as it is probable that what was peculiar to Aristotelian logic did not remain unnoticed in it, for it can hardly be doubted that the division of the existent into the absolutely existent, and the relatively existent, attributed to Xenocrates, was opposed to the Aristotelian table of categories.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} studies {{of the effects of}} synephrine in humans, most of them {{focusing}} on its cardio-vascular properties, have been performed since its introduction as a synthetic drug around 1930. The paper by Stockton and co-workers is representative, describing the effects of racemic synephrine in humans with particular attention to differences resulting from different routes of administration. Thus, it was shown by these investigators that intramuscular injections (average effective dose = 200mg) of the drug produced an increase in systolic blood pressure and pulse rate, without affecting the diastolic pressure. The blood pressure increase reached a maximum (~25mmHg) in 5 minutes following the injection, then gradually returned to normal over the course of 1 hour. Doses of drug greater than 200mg caused side-effects such as heart palpitations, headache, sweating, and feelings <b>of</b> <b>apprehension.</b> When given intravenously, doses of 25–50mg sufficed to produce a mean maximum increase in the blood pressure of 29mmHg in 2 minutes, and a return to baseline within 30 minutes. Respiration was generally not affected during these experiments. Subcutaneous administration of synephrine in doses ≤ 200mg had no effects on blood pressure or pulse rate. Oral doses of 500–1500mg of the drug did not affect blood pressure or respiration, but pulse rate was increased by ~12%, and the highest doses caused nausea and vomiting.|$|E

500|$|One black {{motorist}} {{observed in}} the early 1940s that while black travelers felt free in the mornings, by the early afternoon a [...] "small cloud" [...] had appeared. By the late afternoon, [...] "it casts a shadow <b>of</b> <b>apprehension</b> on our hearts and sours us a little. 'Where,' it asks us, 'will you stay tonight?'". They often had to spend hours in the evening trying to find somewhere to stay, sometimes resorting to sleeping in haylofts or in their own cars if they could not find anywhere. One alternative, if it was available, was to arrange in advance to sleep at the homes of black friends in towns or cities along their route. However, this meant detours and an abandonment of the spontaneity that for many was a key attraction of motoring.|$|E
500|$|Retrospectively, the film's {{critical}} standing has improved. Roger Ebert's correspondent Michael Mirasol {{felt that}} Strange Days had some obvious weaknesses, including a dialogue {{that is too}} polished for its setting, but nevertheless judged its [...] "devotion to its characters, its remarkable use of POVs to create its consistent atmosphere <b>of</b> <b>apprehension</b> and excitement, and most of all, its fearlessness." [...] In 2009, Drew Morton of the Pajiba website considered Strange Days an [...] "extremely underappreciated film" [...] and [...] "the best piece of cyberpunk to grace celluloid since Ridley Scott's Blade Runner." [...] Strange Days also garnered a small cult following, who felt that the film has been overlooked by a casual mass audience and misguided critics. Overall, the film has a 63% [...] "fresh" [...] rating from 41 critics on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes.|$|E
500|$|The game's {{levels are}} fairly linear {{in nature and}} {{incorporate}} several horror elements, {{the most prominent of}} which is darkness. This design choice is not only intended to foster feelings <b>of</b> <b>apprehension</b> and fear within the player, but also to create a more threatening game environment in which the player is less likely to see attacking enemies. This aspect is further enhanced {{by the fact that the}} player must choose between holding a weapon and holding the flashlight (until the BFG editions released in 2012 made the [...] "duct tape mod" [...] a standard feature), forcing the player to choose between being able to see and having a readied weapon upon entering a room, which consequently leads to a more deliberate pace for the player. In addition, the levels are regularly strewn with corpses, dismembered body parts and blood, sometimes used in conjunction with the game's lighting to disorient the player.|$|E

500|$|Bellman was a skilful and {{entertaining}} performer of his songs, accompanying {{himself on the}} cittern, putting on different voices, and imitating the sounds made by a crowd of people. He is unusual, even unique, among major poets in {{that almost all of}} his work was [...] "conceived to music". His achievement has been compared to Shakespeare, Beethoven, Mozart, and Hogarth. Bellman, however, was no great playwright, nor a major classical composer. His biographer, Paul Britten Austin, suggests that the comparison with Hogarth is closer to the mark. Bellman had a gift for using elegant classical references in comic contrast to the sordid realities of drinking and prostitution. The way he does this, at once regretting and celebrating these excesses in song, achieves something of what Hogarth achieved in engravings and paint. The art historian Axel Romdahl describes Bellman's sensibility {{as if he had been}} a painter: [...] "An unusual swiftness <b>of</b> <b>apprehension,</b> both optical and aural, must have distinguished him." [...] Britten Austin agrees with this, noting that [...] "When [...] words and music have faded into silence it is the visual image which remains." [...] Jan Sjåvik comments in the Historical Dictionary of Scandinavian Literature and Theater that [...] "Bellman's achievement consists in taking this humble and unrecognized literary form [...] and raising it to a genre that became impossible to ignore, while in the process creating songs and characters that have become an indispensable part of Sweden's literary and cultural heritage." ...|$|E
500|$|Wright found casting of {{the film}} to be {{difficult}} because he was very particular about [...] "the types of people [...] wanted to work with". While interviewing to direct, he insisted that the actors match {{the ages of the}} characters in the novel. Wright specifically cast actors that had rapport on and off screen, and insisted that they partake in three weeks of rehearsal in improvisation workshops. Wright also had to balance who he thought was best for each role with what the producers wanted – mainly a big name attraction. Though Wright had not initially pictured someone as attractive as English actress Keira Knightley for the lead role of Elizabeth Bennet, he cast her after realising that the actress [...] "is really a tomboy [...] has a lively mind and a great sense of humour". Knightley at the time was known for Bend It Like Beckham and the Pirates of the Caribbean film series. She had been an Austen fan since age 7, but initially feared taking the role out <b>of</b> <b>apprehension</b> that she would be doing [...] "an absolute copy of Jennifer Ehle's performance", which she deeply admired. Knightley believed Elizabeth is [...] "what you aspire to be: she's funny, she's witty and intelligent. She's a fully rounded and very much loved character." [...] For the period, the actress studied etiquette, history and dancing but ran into trouble when she acquired a short haircut while preparing for her role in the bounty hunter film Domino.|$|E

40|$|Accounting {{is about}} {{measuring}} and communicating. Accounting bodies and employers have expressed opinions, {{which have been}} supported by research results, advocating that greater {{emphasis is placed on}} the development of communication skills throughout the education and training of accountants. Consequently, an increasing number of accounting programmes now include communication skills as educational objectives or learning outcomes, and have integrated activities into the curriculum specifically to develop these skills. It is important to recognise that certain factors can severely restrict the development of communication skills; a major factor is communication apprehension. Research suggests that the existence of high levels <b>of</b> communication <b>apprehension</b> will make efforts to improve communication skills ineffective. Previous research findings indicate that accounting students have high levels <b>of</b> communication <b>apprehension.</b> This paper compares and contrasts the levels and profiles <b>of</b> communication <b>apprehension</b> exhibited by accounting students at the (UK University) and those at the (ESP University). The levels <b>of</b> communication <b>apprehension</b> are also compared with those of students from other disciplines at the same institutions. The results confirm the high levels <b>of</b> communication <b>apprehension</b> in European accounting students.
