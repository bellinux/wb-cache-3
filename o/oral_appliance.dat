25|$|In other craniofacial syndromes, the {{abnormal}} feature {{may actually}} improve the airway, but its correction may put the {{person at risk}} for obstructive sleep apnea after surgery when it is modified.

50|$|An <b>oral</b> <b>appliance,</b> often {{referred}} to as a mandibular advancement splint, is a custom-made mouthpiece that shifts the lower jaw forward and opens the bite slightly, opening up the airway.

40|$|Background/Aim. Obstructive {{sleep apnea}} (OSA) {{is one of}} the most {{prevalent}} sleep disorders. It is recognized as a serious risk factor for car and workplace accidents due to daytime sleepiness, and factor for coronary heart diseases and stroke. The aim of this study was to examine the effectiveness of <b>oral</b> <b>appliances</b> for mandibular advance in treating mild to moderate OSA. Methods. A total of 15 patients were included in this study, all diagnosed with mild or moderate OSA. <b>Oral</b> <b>appliances</b> were custom made for each patient in protrusive position at 50 % of maximum mandibular advancement. The patients were given instructions not to sleep on their backs and avoid alcohol consumption during the study as these are the factors that can contribute to symptoms progression. Results. Complete and partial treatment success was achieve in 14 of the patients. Apnea-hypopnea index values were significantly lower (p < 0. 05) at the end of a 6 -month observation period compared to those at the treatment beginning. A great improvement in symptoms was observed, with daytime sleepiness index values significantly reduced already within the first month of the treatment. Conclusion. Treatment of obstructive sleep apnea with <b>oral</b> <b>appliances</b> has proven successful. Patients were comfortable using <b>oral</b> <b>appliances</b> and were ready to wear them for prolonged period of time. Use of <b>oral</b> <b>appliances</b> is very common in the world and should not be discarded.

5000|$|One {{treatment}} for obstructive hypopnea is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). CPAP is a treatment {{in which the}} patient wears a mask over the nose and/or mouth. An air blower forces air through the upper airway. The air pressure is adjusted {{so that it is}} just enough to maintain the oxygen saturation levels in the blood. Another treatment is sometimes a custom fitted <b>oral</b> <b>appliance.</b> The American Academy of Sleep Medicine's protocol for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) recommends oral appliances for those who prefer them to CPAP and have mild to moderate sleep apnea or those that do not respond to/cannot wear a CPAP. Severe cases of OSA may be treated with an <b>oral</b> <b>appliance</b> if the patient has had a trial run with a CPAP. Oral Appliances should be custom made by a dentist with training in dental sleep medicine. [...] Mild obstructive hypopnea can often be treated by losing weight or by avoiding sleeping on one's back. Also quitting smoking, and avoiding alcohol, sedatives and hypnotics (soporifics) before sleep can be quite effective. Surgery is generally a last resort in hypopnea treatment, but is a site-specific option for the upper airway. Depending on the cause of obstruction, surgery may focus on the soft palate, the uvula, tonsils, adenoids or the tongue. There are also more complex surgeries that are performed with the adjustment of other bone structures - the mouth, nose and facial bones.|$|E

50|$|About 35-50% {{of humans}} possess C. albicans {{as part of}} their normal oral microbiota. With more {{sensitive}} detection techniques, this figure is reported to rise to 90%. This candidal carrier state is not considered a disease, since there are no lesions or symptoms of any kind. Oral carriage of Candida is pre-requisite for the development of oral candidiasis. For Candida species to colonize and survive as a normal component of the oral microbiota, the organisms must be capable of adhering to the epithelial surface of the mucous membrane lining the mouth. This adhesion involves adhesins (e.g., hyphal wall protein 1), and extracellular polymeric materials (e.g., mannoprotein). Therefore, strains of Candida with more adhesion capability have more pathogenic potential than other strains. The prevalence of Candida carriage varies with geographic location, and many other factors. Higher carriage is reported during the summer months, in females, in hospitalized individuals, in persons with blood group O and in non-secretors of blood group antigens in saliva. Increased rates of Candida carriage are also found in people who eat a diet high in carbohydrates, people who wear dentures, people with xerostomia (dry mouth), in people taking broad spectrum antibiotics, smokers, and in immunocompromised individuals (e.g., due to HIV/AIDS, diabetes, cancer, Down syndrome or malnutrition). Age also influences oral carriage, with the lowest levels occurring in newborns, increasing dramatically in infants, and then decreasing again in adults. Investigations have quantified oral carriage of Candida albicans at 300-500 colony forming units in healthy persons. More Candida is detected in the early morning and the late afternoon. The greatest quantity of Candida species are harbored on the posterior dorsal tongue, followed by the palatal and the buccal mucosae. Mucosa covered by an <b>oral</b> <b>appliance</b> such as a denture harbors significantly more candida species than uncovered mucosa.|$|E

50|$|Some {{treatments}} involve lifestyle changes, such as avoiding {{alcohol or}} muscle relaxants, losing weight, and quitting smoking.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess variations in the occurrence of temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) and the risk of developing pain and function impairment of the temporomandibular complex in obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) patients treated with either an <b>oral</b> <b>appliance</b> (mandibular advancement device) or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in a 2 -year follow-up study.

Fifty-one patients were randomized to <b>oral</b> <b>appliance</b> therapy and 52 patients to CPAP therapy. TMDs (diagnosed according to the Axis I Research Diagnostic Criteria for TMD), pain intensity and disability and mandibular function impairment were recorded at baseline, after 2 months, 1 year and 2 years of therapy. Only in the initial period of treatment the occurrence of pain-related TMDs was considerably higher (24 %) in the <b>oral</b> <b>appliance</b> group compared to CPAP (6 %). <b>Oral</b> <b>appliance</b> therapy furthermore resulted in more temporomandibular pain compared to CPAP (odds ratio 2. 33, 95 % confidence interval (1. 22 - 4. 43)).
