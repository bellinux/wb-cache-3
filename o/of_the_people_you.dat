Sorry {{to have to be}} so blunt, but the country is in mortal danger from our present {{government}} and our liberty is already near dead because of this government. If you are too stupid to turn things around with your vote, there are people out here like me who are willing to turn things around with guns, force and violence. We hope our method does not become necessary.|$|E
500|$|On April 21, 2009, The Greencards {{released}} {{their fourth}} studio album, Fascination. Warner describes the album as [...] "their most focused" [...] work. On their previous albums, the three band members had individually put forward {{ideas for the}} music, until enough cohered into the finished work. For Fascination, he says they put aside their individual pride to create a stronger work. The years of touring experience The Greencards have accumulated since their earliest work has helped them, as well. Referring to when they formed the band, he said, [...] "We just played in Austin. We just wrote probably anything, which was the only stuff we knew, which {{was more of a}} traditional thing. But since then, we've had five or six years of touring, all of the experiences, all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>you</b> meet. We've been so fortunate to play at all of these festivals which have a really eclectic form of music styles." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1982, Blair was {{selected}} as the Labour Party candidate for the safe Conservative seat of Beaconsfield, where there was a forthcoming by-election. Although Blair lost the Beaconsfield by-election and Labour's share of the vote fell by 10 percentage points, he acquired a profile within the party. In contrast to his later centrism, Blair made it clear in a letter he wrote to Labour leader Michael Foot in July 1982 (published in [...] 2006) that he had [...] "come to Socialism through Marxism" [...] and considered himself on the left. Like Tony Benn, Blair believed that [...] "Labour right" [...] was bankrupt: [...] "Socialism ultimately must appeal to the better minds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people.</b> <b>You</b> cannot do that if you are tainted overmuch with a pragmatic period in power." [...] Yet, he saw the hard left as no better, saying: ...|$|E
