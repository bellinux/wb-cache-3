5|$|It is {{recommended}} that those with the syndrome {{who are capable of}} having children seek genetic counseling before deciding to have children. As the syndrome presents frequently as a forme fruste (incomplete, <b>or</b> <b>unusual</b> form) variant, an examination of all family members must be undertaken. As an autosomal dominant trait there is a fifty percent chance with each child that they will also be born with the syndrome. Although fully penetrant, since the syndrome has variable expressivity, one generation may have a mild expression of the syndrome, while the next may be profoundly affected.|$|E

5|$|The {{cause of}} Smart's eclipse may be traced {{in part to}} a {{prejudice}} of the age, one which was founded in reason but developed in fear. There was one inescapable fact which hampered any clear perception of Smart's work—he had been confined for madness. It was easier to use a difficult allusion <b>or</b> <b>unusual</b> image as evidence of madness than to interpret it. What could cause a fundamentally rational group of people to react so irrationally? To some degree, it was the fear of 'enthusiasm'.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of certain chemical substances—such as ethanol or pesticides or defensive toxic biochemicals produced by plants—to a bee's environment {{can cause the}} bee to display abnormal <b>or</b> <b>unusual</b> behavior and disorientation. In sufficient quantities, such chemicals can poison and even kill the bee. The effects of alcohol on bees have long been recognized. For example, John Cumming described the effect in an 1864 publication on beekeeping.|$|E
5|$|Whether {{horses were}} trained to pull chariots, to be ridden as light or heavy cavalry, or to carry the {{armoured}} knight, much training was required to overcome the horse's natural instinct to flee from noise, the smell of blood, and the confusion of combat. They also learned to accept any sudden <b>or</b> <b>unusual</b> movements of humans while using a weapon or avoiding one. Horses used in close combat may have been taught, or at least permitted, to kick, strike, and even bite, thus becoming weapons themselves for the warriors they carried.|$|E

50|$|Frequent {{themes in}} This is True include absurd {{governmental}} actions <b>or</b> policies, <b>unusual</b> <b>or</b> badly phrased newspaper headlines, and injuries and deaths due to outrageous negligence (similar to the Darwin Awards).

5|$|In 1969, Fitzgerald {{received}} a safety award {{for eight years}} of operation without a time-off worker injury. The vessel ran aground in 1969, and she collided with SS Hochelaga in 1970. Later that same year, she struck {{the wall of a}} lock, an accident repeated in 1973 and 1974. During 1974, she lost her original bow anchor in the Detroit River. None of these mishaps, however, were considered serious <b>or</b> <b>unusual.</b> Freshwater ships were built to last more than half a century, and Fitzgerald should still have had a long career ahead of her when she sank.|$|E
5|$|Potter's small format {{books have}} been {{translated}} into nearly thirty languages including Greek and Russian. The Tale of Timmy Tiptoes {{was published in the}} Initial Teaching Alphabet in 1966 and in Dutch as Het Verhaal van Timmie Tuimelaar in 1968 under licence to Uitgeverij Ploegsma, Amsterdam. The tale was published in Spanish by Grange Books in 1997, and a German Thesaurus edition intended for German ESL and English GSL students in 2009. The Thesaurus edition was printed in English with translations of difficult <b>or</b> <b>unusual</b> words and expressions located in footnotes. In 1986, MacDonald observed that the Potter books had become a traditional part of childhood in both English-speaking lands and those in which the books had been translated.|$|E
5|$|Abnormalities in {{the normal}} sinus rhythm of the heart can prevent the heart from {{effectively}} pumping blood, and are generally identified by ECG. These cardiac arrhythmias can cause an abnormal but regular heart rhythm, such as a rapid heart rate (tachycardia, classified as arising from above the ventricles or from the ventricles) or a slow heart rate (bradycardia); or may result in irregular rhythms. Tachycardia is generally defined as a heart rate faster than 100 beats per minute, and bradycardia as a heart rate slower than 60. Asystole is the cessation of heart rhythm. A random and varying rhythm is classified as atrial or ventricular fibrillation depending if the electrical activity originates in the atria or the ventricles. Abnormal conduction can cause a delay <b>or</b> <b>unusual</b> order of contraction of the heart muscle. This can {{be a result of}} a disease process, such as heart block, or congenital, such as Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.|$|E

50|$|However, {{opposed to}} the {{homeland}} one can free himself off, the home understood as in house is {{a necessary part of}} human existence. It gives a person the mental ability to process information as it divides the sphere of existence into habit <b>or</b> home and <b>unusual</b> <b>or</b> new information. The habitual environment is a prerequisite to recognize the unusual which comes into one’s home. Flusser refers in this regard to Hegel’s dialectic analysis between home and the <b>unusual</b> <b>or</b> generally speaking of consciousness.|$|R

5|$|In December 1689, Parliament passed one of {{the most}} {{important}} constitutional documents in English history, the Bill of Rights. This measure—which restated and confirmed many provisions of the earlier Declaration of Right—established restrictions on the royal prerogative; it declared, among other things, that the Sovereign could not suspend laws passed by Parliament, levy taxes without parliamentary consent, infringe the right to petition, raise a standing army during peacetime without parliamentary consent, deny the right to bear arms to Protestant subjects, unduly interfere with parliamentary elections, punish members of either House of Parliament for anything said during debates, require excessive bail, or inflict cruel <b>or</b> <b>unusual</b> punishments. The Bill of Rights also confirmed the succession to the throne. Following the death of either William III or Mary II, the other was to continue to reign. Next in the line of succession would be any children of the couple, to be followed by Mary's sister Anne and her children. Last in the line of succession stood any children William III might have had from any subsequent marriage.|$|E
5|$|In Vedic literature, Mitra and Varuna {{are portrayed}} as icons of affection and {{intimate}} friendship between males (the Sanskrit word mitra means “friend” or “companion”). They are depicted riding a shark or crocodile together while bearing tridents, ropes, conch shells and water pots. Sometimes they are portrayed seated side-by-side on a golden chariot drawn by seven swans. Ancient Brahmana texts furthermore associate Mitra and Varuna with the two lunar phases and same-sex relations: “Mitra and Varuna, on the other hand, are the two half-moons: the waxing one is Varuna and the waning one is Mitra. During the new-moon night these two meet {{and when they are}} thus together they are pleased with a cake offering. Verily, all are pleased and all is obtained by any person knowing this. On that same night, Mitra implants his seed in Varuna and when the moon later wanes, that waning is produced from his seed.” (Shatapatha Brahmana 2.4.4.19) Varuna is similarly said to implant his seed in Mitra on the full-moon night for the purpose of securing its future waxing. In Hinduism, the new- and full-moon nights are discouraged times for procreation and consequently often associated with citrarata <b>or</b> <b>unusual</b> types of intercourse.|$|E

25|$|Clogging or bioclogging of geotextiles, geonets, geopipe and/or geocomposites is a {{challenging}} design for certain soil types <b>or</b> <b>unusual</b> situations.

25|$|The {{recollection}} of dreams is extremely unreliable, {{though it is}} a skill that can be trained. Dreams can usually be recalled if a person is awakened while dreaming. Women tend to have more frequent dream recall than men. Dreams that are difficult to recall may be characterized by relatively little affect, and factors such as salience, arousal, and interference play a role in dream recall. Often, a dream may be recalled upon viewing or hearing a random trigger or stimulus. The salience hypothesis proposes that dream content that is salient, that is, novel, intense, <b>or</b> <b>unusual,</b> is more easily remembered. There is considerable evidence that vivid, intense, <b>or</b> <b>unusual</b> dream content is more frequently recalled. A dream journal can be used to assist dream recall, for personal interest or psychotherapy purposes.|$|E
