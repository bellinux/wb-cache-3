5|$|A {{declaration}} is a pronouncement {{by a court}} {{stating the}} legal position between the parties to an action, based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> that have been presented to the court. Before 1 May 2011, {{it was not possible}} to apply for prerogative orders and declarations in the same set of legal proceedings. Following that date, changes to Order 53 of the Rules of Court permitted an application for a declaration to be made together with an application for one or more prerogative orders. However, the application for a declaration cannot be made unless the court grants leave for the prerogative orders to be applied for.|$|E
5|$|<b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> of Lines International, {{the judge}} {{held that the}} policy {{satisfied}} all four conditions and that {{the adoption of the}} guidelines was valid. On the fourth consideration relating to fettering of discretion, the judge found that the PSA and STPB had not rigidly enforced the guidelines as they had made it clear at the meeting attended by the plaintiff that they would consider representations from cruise operators, and, in fact, a number of such concessions were made. Hence, the guidelines had been flexibly applied and the PSA had not fettered its discretion by rigidly adhering to a policy. The Lines International conditions were approved by the Court of Appeal in JD Ltd. v. Comptroller of Income Tax (2005).|$|E

5|$|Once it {{has been}} decided that the gift has failed, the courts {{consider}} whether the gift may be applied cy-près. The gift must show charitable intention; that the settlor intended not just a gift to a particular (failed) purpose or organisation, but a more general charitable intention. This is something decided <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> of each individual case, but some general principles are in place; external evidence is admissible to override any prima facie interpretation that a gift is for non-charitable purposes, as in Re Satterthwaite's Will Trusts, and charitable intention {{can be found in}} cases where a non-existent charity is the recipient of the settlor's gift, as in Re Harwood.|$|E
5|$|The High Court {{agreed with}} the {{plaintiff}} that since the PSA had authority {{to decide how to}} allocate berths, it was also entrusted with the duty to exercise that discretion after taking various key factors into consideration, and would have acted unlawfully if it had abrogated its responsibility by taking orders from other public authorities such as the Gambling Suppression Branch or the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board unless it was under a statutory duty to do so. However, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> of the case, the decision to deny berths to the plaintiff's cruise ship had been taken by the PSA alone.|$|E
5|$|The {{case was}} again appealed, {{this time to}} the House of Lords, where it was heard by Lord Templeman, Lord Goff, Lord Jauncey, Lord Lowry and Lord Woolf.

Goff first addressed the Court of Appeal's use of Ballard v Tomlinson, stating that the decision there as based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> of the case, and did not establish either a rule that there was a right to clear water, nor that there was strict liability attached to that right.|$|E

5|$|To {{cope with}} the ongoing war situation, Charles had {{introduced}} martial law to large swathes of the country; he extended this during 1626 and 1627, as the financial constraints imposed by Parliament began to cut into pay, leading to soldiers rioting. Under {{the law of the}} time, martial law was declared by the local military commander, at which point a group of Commissioners would be empowered to decide <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> of offences, before passing the case to the commander, who would pass judgment. In practice, things worked completely differently. In Dover, the forces were commanded by Lord Conway, who declared martial law. Not only were commissioners authorised to decide <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts,</b> they were also permitted to authorise summary judgments, including the execution of people they deemed to be guilty. In addition, the commissioners were given the power not only to resolve billeting disputes between soldiers and civilians, but to order civilians to provide quarters for the troops. A later declaration of martial law in Portsmouth extended the commission's remit yet again, allowing for civilians to be tried under martial law and, if necessary, sentenced to death. Even this did not solve the problems, as soldiers would often wander outside the jurisdiction of the commissioners; to deal with this, February 1627 saw a Provost Marshal introduced to each county, bringing the entire nation under martial law.|$|E
5|$|Trusts {{where the}} {{doctrine}} is applicable {{are divided into}} two groups; those with subsequent failure, where the trust's purpose has failed after it came into operation, and initial failure, where the trust's purposes are immediately invalid. Subsequent failure cases simply require the redirection of the funds to the nearest possible purpose, {{since there is no}} question of allowing the settlor's next of kin to inherit the money. Initial failure cases, however, require not just a decision on whether the purpose has failed, but also on whether the funds should be subject to cy-près or returned to the estate in a resulting trust. This is decided based on the charitable intention of the settlor, something determined <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> of each individual case.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the judge}} noted that whether a {{discretionary}} power {{is subject to}} any precedent fact depends {{on the construction of}} the legislation creating the power, and that it is open to Parliament to express its intention in plain and unequivocal words to take a discretion conferred on a public authority out of the precedent fact category, thus excluding judicial review of the discretion even if the liberty of a person affected by the exercise of the discretion is implicated. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> of the case, the discretion conferred on the President and the Minister for Home Affairs by sections 8 and 10 of the Internal Security Act to detain without trial persons believed to threaten national security, to suspend detentions and to revoke such suspensions, was held to fall outside the precedent fact category. Consequently, the Court could not go beyond determining if the detention decisions violated administrative law rules relating to illegality, irrationality or procedural impropriety.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to prerogative orders, the equitable remedy of a declaration {{can be employed}} to control an excess of legal authority. A declaration is a pronouncement by a court stating the legal position between the parties to an action, based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> that have been presented to the court. In contrast to the prerogative orders which are termed public law remedies, the declaration is called a private law remedy as it was originally developed in court cases between private parties. Only the High Court may grant declarations in judicial review cases; although the Subordinate Courts are generally empowered by the Subordinate Courts Act to grant declarations, a District Court exercises no judicial review jurisdiction over acts or decisions of persons or authorities, and a Magistrate's Court cannot deal with any action {{in which there is}} no claim for any sum of money.|$|E
5|$|In the High Court case of Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs (1989), the {{plaintiff}} {{argued that the}} 1989 amendments to the Constitution had violated the basic features of the Constitution by breaching the principle of separation of powers by usurping judicial power, and contravening the rule of law. The Court rejected {{the application of the}} basic features doctrine owing to the differences in the making of the Singapore Constitution and the Indian Constitution, {{and the fact that the}} framers of the Singapore Constitution had not expressly provided for limitations to be placed on Parliament's power of amendment. The Court also held that, in any case, there had been no violation of the Constitution's basic features <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> of the case. On appeal, the Court of Appeal determined the case on other grounds, and thus found it unnecessary to decide conclusively if the basic features doctrine applies in Singapore.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{remedies}} {{that may}} be sought by an applicant for {{judicial review is a}} declaration, which is a pronouncement by a court stating the legal position between the parties to an action, based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> that have been presented to the court. The Singapore courts have not yet directly addressed the issue of the standing required to apply for a declaration in an administrative law case, but it is possible they may adopt the test laid down in constitutional law cases. In Tan Eng Hong v. Attorney-General (2012), the Court of Appeal held that three elements must exist for a person have standing to bring a constitutional challenge: (1) he or she must have a real interest in bringing the case, (2) there must be a real controversy between the parties to the case, and (3) a personal right possessed by the applicant must have been violated.|$|E

5|$|The {{applicant}} then {{appealed to}} the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal construed section 8B(1) {{in accordance with the}} clear legislative intention expressed through the plain wording of the provision. It held that the provision reinstates the legal position laid down in Lee Mau Seng as the law governing judicial review of decisions made or acts done pursuant to the executive's powers under the ISA. In order to determine the law on judicial review of the exercise of executive discretion under the ISA, it is necessary to ascertain the exact decision laid down in Lee Mau Seng. However, the Court declined to opine whether the Lee Mau Seng decision meant that a detention order cannot be challenged on the basis that it was made for reasons completely outside the scope of the ISA. This was because <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> of the case it had not been established that the applicant was re-detained for reasons not contemplated by section 8(1) of the ISA and completely unrelated to national security. Notably, the Court did not decide whether section 8B(2) of the ISA precludes it from reviewing a detention order shown to have been made for purposes other than national security, or whether the 1989 amendments to the ISA are outside the scope of the legislative power conferred on Parliament by the amended Article 149 of the Constitution.|$|E
5|$|The {{key idea}} is that under certain {{circumstances}} where a representation has been made by a public authority to an individual who {{would be affected by}} a decision by the authority, the individual expects to be heard before the decision is made. To deny the right to be heard amounts to unfairness. The court will thus be inclined to quash a decision if there has been unfairness and reliance by the individual on the representation to his detriment. This is demonstrated in the 1983 House of Lords decision Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service (the GCHQ case). This case involved the trade unions of employees of the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), a government signals and intelligence department, who argued that they had an expectation to be consulted before the Minister took the decision to deny them the right to join trade unions. The Minister argued that it had been necessary to take that step as the trade unions were conducting strikes that crippled GCHQ operations and threatened the national security of the United Kingdom. The Court established that in the past the trade unions had been consulted on employment-related matters, even though it was not a rule. However, their Lordships clearly recognized that an individual can have a legitimate expectation to be consulted before a decision is taken when it is proven that this is the practice. Such a representation can {{come in the form of}} a clear and unambiguous promise to hear the individual or an established practice to consult those affected before taking the decision. Nonetheless, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> of the case, their Lordships agreed that they could not review the Minister's decision even though there was an enforceable legitimate expectation as the decision had been made on national security grounds.|$|E
