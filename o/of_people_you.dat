2500|$|Family First's preferencing {{agreement}} with the Coalition in the 2004 federal election led Barnaby Joyce, the National senate candidate for Queensland, to publicly slam the party {{the day before the}} election, calling them [...] "the lunatic Right", and stating that [...] "these are not the sort <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>you</b> do preference deals with". Joyce's comments came in response to a pamphlet published by one of the party's Victorian Senate candidates, Danny Nalliah who in his capacity as a church pastor had criticised other religions and homosexuality.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2004, Nalliah {{campaigned for}} {{a seat in the}} Australian Senate as a {{candidate}} of the Family First Party. He was slotted second on the party's Victorian Senate list but failed to be elected. Nevertheless, his candidacy caused considerable controversy when National Party Senate candidate Barnaby Joyce launched a heavily publicised attack on Family First and his own party's preference deal with them the day before the election. Joyce highlighted a quote from one of Nalliah's brochures that asked parishioners to pray that God would pull down [...] "Satan's strongholds", which included brothels, gambling places, bottle shops, mosques and temples (including Freemason, Buddhist and Hindu temples). Joyce used Nalliah's derogatory statements about minority groups to describe Family First as [...] "not the sort <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>you</b> do preference deals with." ...|$|E

2500|$|Liu Yao and {{his forces}} reached Pengze County (彭澤縣; east of present-day Hukou County, Jiangxi) and garrisoned there. At the time, Zhou Shu (周術), the {{previous}} Administrator of Yuzhang Commandery, {{had died of}} illness so his office was vacant. Liu Biao, the Governor of Jing Province, supported Zhuge Xuan (諸葛玄) {{to be the new}} Administrator, but that became a problem because the Han imperial court had appointed Zhu Hao to succeed Zhou Shu. Liu Yao sent a subordinate, Ze Rong, to lead troops to attack Zhuge Xuan and help Zhu Hao. Xu Shao cautioned Liu Yao, [...] "Ze Rong doesn't care about how others see him. Zhu Wenming (Zhu Hao) is too trusting <b>of</b> <b>people.</b> <b>You</b> should warn him to be wary (of Ze Rong)." [...] After driving Zhuge Xuan away, as Xu Shao foresaw, Ze Rong killed Zhu Hao and took control of Yuzhang Commandery.|$|E
