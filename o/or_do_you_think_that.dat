6000|$|She {{leaned back}} {{again in the}} chair and let her hands rest quietly in her lap. [...] "Would you have {{preferred}} me to remain outside, in the yacht, in the near neighbourhood of these wild men who captured you? <b>Or</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> they, too, were got up to carry on a farce?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Sir," [...] said Mr. Crawley, very irate at this {{appeal to}} his wife, and {{speaking}} in a loud voice, [...] "do you misdoubt my word; <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> if I were minded to be false to you, that I should be corrected in my falsehood by the firmer faith of my wife?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{you think}} I'll take it now?" [...] {{said the old}} man passionately. [...] "Do you think that your charity will bring back my dead wife, the three years of my lost life, the love and respect of my children? <b>Or</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> your own wife and children, who deserted you in your wealth, will come back to you in your poverty? No! Let the mine stay, with its curse, where it is--I'll have none of it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are difficult. Why not fling {{yourself}} into {{the tide of}} joy here, instead of shivering on the brink in the blast of that east wind which you do not even find regenerative? Why not forget our inferiority, since you cannot forgive it? <b>Or</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> by being continually reminded of it we can become as those Bostonians are? Can we reduce ourselves, by repenting, from four millions to less than one, and by narrowing our phylacteries achieve the unlimited Bostonian verticality, and go as deep and as high?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bobby," [...] said Old Mother Nature sternly, [...] "why don't you own up {{that you}} went over there to try to steal eggs? <b>Or</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> might catch a tender young Chicken? Where were you night before last?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you despise me?" [...] demanded Leslie in a fierce, low tone. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I'm wicked--unwomanly? <b>Or</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I'm {{just plain}} fool?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> {{say to a}} {{match between}} your fingers? <b>Or</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> a pair of bracelets of living fire would answer better, to begin with?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'To hint a wish, sir!' {{returned}} the debtor, proud and mean by turns, and selfish at all times. 'I am her father, am I not? Why should I hint, and beat about the bush? Do you suppose, like her mother's friends and my enemies--a curse upon them all!--that {{there is anything}} in what she has done for me but duty, sir, but duty? <b>Or</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> my having been unfortunate is a sufficient reason why our relative positions should be changed, and that she should command and I should obey? Hint a wish, too! Perhaps you think, because you see me in this place and scarcely able to leave this chair without assistance, that I am some broken-spirited dependent creature, without the courage or power to do what I may think best for my own child. Still the power to hint a wish! I hope so!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... [Answer {{to reason}} third.] What then? Do {{you think that}} the walking in the order of the churches of old, as to matter of outward worship, is {{sufficient}} to clear you of your sins at the judgment-day? <b>or,</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> God will be contented with a little bodily subjection to that which shall vanish and fade like a flower, when the Lord shall come from Heaven in flaming fire, with His mighty angels (2 Thess 1:7,8). Alas, alas, how will such professors as these are fall before the judgment-seat of Christ! Then such a question as this, [...] "Friend, how camest thou in hither, not having a wedding garment?" [...] will make them be speechless, and fall down into everlasting burnings, thousands on a heap; for you must know that it is not then your crying, Lord, Lord, that will stand you in stead; not your saying, We have ate and drank in Thy presence, that will keep you from standing on the left hand of Christ. It is the principle as well as the practice that shall be inquired into at that day.|$|E
6000|$|A {{few more}} questions--addressed more {{particularly}} to veteran observers than to {{those to whom}} the world is new and strange. Have you observed any alteration {{in the manner of}} men toward women? If so, is it in the direction of greater rudeness or of more ceremonious respect? And again, if so, has not the change, in point of time, been coincident with the genesis and development of woman's [...] "emancipation" [...] and her triumphal entry into the field of [...] "affairs"? Are you really desirous that the change go further? <b>Or</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> when women are armed with the ballot they will compel a return of the old régime of deference and delicate consideration--extorting by their power the tribute once voluntarily paid to their weakness? Is there any known way by which women can at once be our political equals and our social superiors, our competitors in the sharp and bitter struggle for glory, gain or bread, and the objects of our unselfish and undiminished devotion? The present predicts the future; of the foreshadow of the coming event all sensitive female hearts feel the chill. For whatever advantages, real or illusory, some women enjoy under this régime of partial [...] "emancipation" [...] all women pay. Of the coin in which payment is made the shouldering shouters of the sex have not a groat and can bear the situation with impunity. They have either passed the age of masculine attention or were born without the means to its accroachment. Dwelling in the open bog, they can afford to defy eviction.|$|E
6000|$|Anthea {{looked at}} him with a sparkle in her eyes. [...] "Pshaw!" [...] she said. [...] "Are you going to {{masquerade}} always, <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I am quite without intelligence?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you suppose}} I {{could get them}} to get any?" [...] {{questioned}} Tomlinson. [...] "Would it be all right to telephone down to the office, <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> {{it would be better}} to ring?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Cruel, heartless Hurons!" [...] exclaimed {{the still}} indignant Hetty--"Would you burn {{a man and}} a Christian, as you would burn a log of wood! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> never read your Bibles? <b>Or</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> God will forget such things?" ...|$|R
60|$|My Lords, I {{am really}} ashamed to mention so scandalous a thing; {{but let us}} put a case: let us suppose that we had accused Mr. Hastings of instigating the Rajah of Berar to fall upon {{some of the country}} powers, and that the {{evidence}} we produced at your bar to prove it was, that an officer had taken two nudjeeves, who declared they were instigated by Mr. Hastings to go into the service of that Rajah: could you bear such a thing? would you suffer such evidence to be produced? <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> we should have so little regard for our own reputation as to venture to produce such evidence before you? Again, we have charged Mr. Hastings with committing several acts of violence against the Begums. Let us suppose our proof to be, that two persons who never appeared before nor since, that two grenadiers in English uniforms, (which would be a great deal stronger than the case of the nudjeeves, because they have no particular uniform belonging to them,) that two English grenadiers, I say, had been taken prisoners in some action and let go again, who said that Mr. Hastings had instigated them to make war upon the Begums: would your Lordships suffer such evidence to be produced before you? No. And yet two of the first women in India are to be stripped of all they have in the world upon no better evidence than that which you would utterly reject. You would not disgrace the British peerage, you would not disgrace this court of justice, you would not disgrace human reason itself, by confiscating, on such evidence, the meanest property of the meanest wretch. You would not subject to the smallest fine for the smallest delinquency, upon such evidence. I will venture to say, that, in an action of assault and battery, or in an action for the smallest sum, such evidence would be scouted as odious and contemptible, even supposing that a perfect reliance might be placed upon its truth. And yet {{this is the sort of}} evidence upon which the property, the dignity, and the rank of some of the first persons in Asia are to be destroyed,--by which a British guaranty, and the honor and dignity of the crown of Great Britain, and of the Parliament itself, which sent out this man, are to be forfeited.|$|E
5000|$|Melissa Etheridge, one of {{the three}} panelists at the forum, asked Gov. Bill Richardson, [...] "Do you think {{homosexuality}} is a choice or is it biological?" [...] Richardson responded, [...] "It's a choice." [...] Etheridge restated the question: [...] "Do you think a homosexual is born that way, <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> around seventh grade we go, 'Oh, I want to be gay'?" [...] Richardson replied, [...] "Well, I'm not a scientist." ...|$|E

I {{have a question for}} you: Why don’t you approve the mandate of the United Nations to investigate MH17 as the precondition to restore the trust that you have mentioned in your speech. As well as: Why don’t you ratify the Rome Statute while acknowledging the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court as the precondition for this international dialogue that you have mentioned in your speech. <b>Or</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> you are going to avoid the international justice for the war crimes and crimes against humanity?

5000|$|On April 26, 2006, Viswanathan {{appeared}} on NBC's The Today Show with Katie Couric. Viswanathan maintained her innocence, saying that {{any and all}} similarities were [...] "completely unconscious and unintentional" [...] and that she must have [...] "internalized McCafferty's words," [...] never deliberately meaning to [...] "take any." [...] She maintained, [...] "as I was writing, I genuinely believed that every single word I wrote was my own. I was so surprised and horrified when I found these similarities, when I heard about them over this weekend." [...] Asked about the plot similarities between Opal Mehta and McCafferty's novels, Viswanathan told Couric, “I wrote about what I knew, my personal experiences. I’m an Indian-American girl who got good grades, from New Jersey, who {{wanted to go to}} an Ivy League school, and I drew upon my own experiences, upon quirks of the people around me and my culture, to create my character Opal Mehta.” Viswanathan stated her intention to put an acknowledgement to McCafferty in the foreword of future printings of Opal Mehta, and said of McCafferty [...] "I hope that she can forgive me for whatever distress I’ve caused her." [...] Couric then asked, [...] "Do you think that's realistic ... given all the controversy surrounding James Frey and his book ... <b>Or</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> ... they can forgive and forget?" [...] Viswanathan responded, [...] "I mean, that's what I'd hope that people can do. I hope that people who know me will believe that I'm telling the truth, that I've never been anything less than honest in my entire life, that I'm so horribly sorry for this mistake. But that's all it was, a completely unintentional mistake." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{definition}} of the CDC for molecular epidemiology is: “the various techniques derived from immunology, bio-chemistry, and genetics for typing or subtyping pathogens”.

It is clear from the research being conducted at CDC that their {{definition of}} molecular epidemiology is an inclusive one.
