In June 2004, McDonald's customers received Kim Possible memorabilia ranging from action figures to spy gear and accessories with their purchase <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Happy</b> Meal.

60|$|Well, {{all this}} world of ours may seem a slum to the people <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>happier</b> age.

5|$|Because of the disappointing {{box office}} {{performances}} of The Hunchback of Notre Dame and Hercules, Disney restricted its marketing campaign for Mulan spending $30 million on promotional advertisements compared {{to more than}} $60 million for Hercules the year before. Instead of the lavish media event premieres of Pocahontas in Central Park and the electric light parade on Fifth Avenue for Hercules, Disney opted to premiere the film at the Hollywood Bowl complete with Chinese lanterns and fortune cookies. Two days before the general release, McDonald's launched its promotional campaign by including one of eight toys free with the purchase <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Happy</b> Meal. The promotion also included Szechuan sauce for its Chicken McNuggets, which would be referenced in a 2017 episode of the Adult Swim series Rick and Morty and subsequently brought back by McDonald's as a promotional item related to that show.|$|E
5|$|In 1898, Krøyer started Chez Moi, {{a series}} of watercolours of Marie and their {{daughter}} Vibeke in the family homes in Copenhagen and Skagen in a style inspired by the Art Nouveau approach adopted by Carl Larsson whom Krøyer probably met during his time in Paris. Larsson had started painting in watercolours while {{a member of the}} Grez-sur-Loing artists' colony in France. On returning to Sweden, he had begun {{a series of}} pictures of family life with his wife and children in Sundborn in the mid-1890s, publishing it as Ett hem (A home) in 1899. Krøyer's paintings display no signs of disturbance or frustration but leave an impression <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> family environment, no doubt in accordance with Krøyer's own desires. He exhibited the three from Skagen in 1889 at Den Frie – the exhibition of the artists' association that had been formed in 1891 with Krøyer's support – under the collective title Fra mit Skagenshjem (From my Skagen Home).|$|E

Shelby reaches out to Rachel, Puck and Quinn. She lets Puck see Beth, but rejects Quinn's desire to do likewise due to Quinn's bad-girl attitude, appearance and behavior. Cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch), {{who is running for}} Congress, convinces Quinn to feature in an anti-arts video for her campaign. In it, Quinn confronts Will and blames him for her transformation into a bad girl, but Will reprimands her, reminds her of how the glee club and its members have always supported her in the past and tells her to grow up. After seeing a picture <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> Beth and Puck, Quinn breaks down. She resumes her normal appearance, and Will and the New Directions welcome her back into the club. Puck tells Quinn he is proud of her, but Quinn reveals she is only pretending to behave in order to take Beth back from Shelby, and intends to pursue full custody.|$|E

He was the most photographed American of the 19th Century, self-consciously using photography to advance his political views. He never smiled, specifically so as not to play into the racist caricature <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> slave.

25|$|In both Catholic and Protestant traditions, Joseph is {{regarded}} as the patron saint of workers and is associated with various feast days. However, protestants in general reject the veneration and invocation of the Saints.. Pope Pius IX declared him to be both the patron and the protector of the Catholic Church, in addition to his patronages of the sick and <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> death, due to the belief that he died in the presence of Jesus and Mary.

25|$|A {{number of}} {{versions}} of the Ramakien epic {{were lost in the}} destruction of Ayutthaya in 1767. Three versions currently exist. One of these was prepared under the supervision (and partly written by) King Rama I. His son, Rama II, rewrote some parts for khon drama. The main differences from the original are an extended role for the monkey god Hanuman and the addition <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> ending. Many of popular poems among the Thai nobles are also based on Indian stories. One of the most famous is Anirut Kham Chan which is based on an ancient Indian story of Prince Anirudha.|$|E

25|$|During the {{serialization}} of Angel Sanctuary, she mistakenly {{titled the}} Gehenna story arc as the Yetzirah arc, and {{was unable to}} correct it as several chapters had already appeared under the title; she corrected it for the tankōban release. As the manga takes place in July 1999, Yuki expressed a goal to complete the series by then. For the conclusion, she originally had planned to use a tragic ending, but decided against it in favor <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> one, because she thought that it would be too upsetting for the fans to read after twenty volumes.

25|$|She co-starred with Woody Allen in the 1991 film Scenes from a Mall, {{again for}} Paul Mazursky. In the film, Allen's {{character}} reveals to his author wife Deborah, played by Midler, after years <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> marriage, {{that he has}} had an affair, resulting in her request for divorce. The movie performed poorly, and received a mixed reception by critics. Midler fared somewhat better with her other 1991 project For the Boys, on which she reteamed with The Rose director Mark Rydell. A historical musical drama, it tells the story of 1940s actress and singer Dixie Leonard, played by Midler, who teams up with Eddie Sparks, a famous performer to entertain American troops. While the film received a mixed reception from critics, Midler earned rave review for her portrayal. The following year she was awarded her second Golden Globe and received her second Academy Award nomination for Best Actress.|$|E
25|$|Philo {{wrote that}} God {{instructed}} the Israelites to offer unleavened bread and bitter herbs {{together with the}} Passover sacrifice because unleavened bread signified great haste and speed, while bitter herbs signified the life of bitterness and struggle that the Israelites endured as slaves. Philo also taught that the deeper meaning was that leavened and fermented foods rose, while unleavened foods remained low, and each of these states symbolized types of the soul. Leavening symbolized the haughty soul swollen with arrogance, while the unleavened symbolized the unchangeable and prudent soul choosing the middle way rather than extremes. The bitter herbs manifested a psychic migration from passion to impassivity and from wickedness to virtue. For, Philo taught, those who naturally and genuinely repented became bitter toward their former way of life, lamenting {{the time that they}} had given over to the seductive and deceitful mistress of desire, being deceived by desire when they ought to have renewed themselves and advanced in the contemplation of wisdom toward the goal <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> and immortal life. And so, those who desired repentance ate the unleavened bread with bitter herbs; they first ate bitterness over their old and unendurable life, and then ate the opposite of boastful arrogance in meditation on humility. For, Philo concluded, the memory of former sins caused fear, and by restraining sin through recollection, brought profit to the mind.|$|E

25|$|Dominic's {{health was}} {{steadily}} deteriorating, but {{he spent most}} of his time with his friends, talking with them, and encouraging those who were experiencing troubles. He also helped at the school infirmary whenever his companions were admitted. On the recommendation of doctors, Dominic was sent home to recover from his ill health, but a few days later Bosco found him back at the Oratory. Despite his affection for Dominic, and his wish to allow Dominic to remain at the Oratory, John Bosco decided to follow the recommendation of the doctors, especially since Dominic had developed a severe cough and he wrote to Dominic's father, fixing the date of his departure on March 1, 1857. Though Dominic said that he wanted to spend his last days at the Oratory, he accepted this decision and spent the evening before his departure at John Bosco's side, discussing spiritual matters. (Bosco recorded a part of this conversation in his biography of Dominic). On the morning of his departure, Don Bosco notes that Dominic made the Exercise <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Happy</b> Death with great zeal, even saying that this would be his final such devotion. He said his farewell to John Bosco, asking as a keepsake that Bosco add his name to the list of those who would participate in the Plenary Indulgence that John Bosco had received from the Pope, to which John Bosco readily agreed. He then took leave of his friends with great affection, which surprised them, for his illness was not considered by many of his companions to be serious.|$|E

She also wrote that Yuki's inclusion <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> ending felt surprising compared {{to the rest of the}} story. Reviewing [...] "Camelot Garden", she enjoyed it less than Grand Guignol Orchestra, and wrote that the short story contained an implicit reference to Lewis Carroll's children's novel Through the Looking Glass (1871) and its character, the ever-sleeping Red King.|$|E
