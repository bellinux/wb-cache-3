40|$|The {{concept of}} using {{beam-shaping}} techniques to reduce sidelobe levels {{at the expense}} of efficiency is introduced and analyzed with respect to the potential for improving <b>orbit-spectrum</b> <b>utilization.</b> Emphasis is placed on a simple method: improving the antenna patterns used in satellite systems, for both the satellite antennas and the ground station antennas. Only broadcasting applications are considered. The discussion includes how the antenna envelope can be improved, how this improvement can be interpreted in terms of orbit spectrum utilization efficiency, and whether this improved envelope is actually realizable and feasible. It is noted that the magnitude of the improvement with a better spacecraft antenna increases rapidly as the coverage area decreases...|$|E
