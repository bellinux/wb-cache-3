2500|$|Their {{numerous}} studio albums {{were generally}} collections of new songs {{that they had}} first played in concert. The band was also famous for its extended musical jams, which featured both individual improvisations as well as distinctive [...] "group-mind" [...] improvisations during which each of the band members improvised individually while simultaneously blending together as a cohesive musical unit. Musically, this may be illustrated in that the band not only improvised within the form of songs, {{but also with the}} form. The Grateful Dead have often been described as having never played the same song the same way twice. The cohesive listening abilities of each band member made for a transcendence <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> [...] "free form" [...] and improvisation. Their concert sets often blended songs, one into the next (a segue).|$|E

2500|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} {{less than six}} months after Gibson's 2006 DUI incident, where the director made antisemitic comments to police after being stopped on suspicion of drunk driving; the incident garnered Gibson much negative publicity and magnified concerns some had over alleged antisemitism in his previous film, The Passion of the Christ. [...] Several key film critics alluded to the incident in their reviews of Apocalypto: In his positive review, The New York Times A. O. Scott commented: [...] "say what you will about him – about his problem with booze or his problem with Jews – he is a serious filmmaker." [...] The Boston Globe review came to a similar conclusion, noting that [...] "Gibson may be a lunatic, but he's our lunatic, and while I wouldn't wish him {{behind the wheel of a}} car after happy hour or at a B'nai Brith function anytime, behind a camera is another matter." [...] In a negative review, Salon.com noted [...] "People are curious about this movie because <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> extra-textual reasons, because its director is an erratic and charismatic Hollywood figure who would have totally marginalized himself by now if he didn't possess a crude gift for crafting violent pop entertainment." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fifth, {{the game}} system is richly {{detailed}} and demanding {{of the players}} in terms <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> [...] "situational awareness", particularly in directionality and proximity. Every ship/unit must maintain a definite [...] "facing" [...] (heading on the game map's hexagonal grid) {{which can only be}} changed sixty degrees or less at a time under strict rules (turn modes and the [...] "sideslip" [...] move). There are more drastic movement options available (Warp Tactical Maneuvering and the High Energy Turn or HET) but they are limited by restrictions and risks of mishap (such as the always-dreaded Breakdown penalty). Adding complexity {{is the fact that the}} defensive shields of starships are spread around their six hex sides, most usually in an uneven pattern with the front (or number one) shield having most of the ship's shield boxes. Each hexside around the ship towards its rear usually has fewer boxes for absorbing damage before incoming weapons fire begins scoring [...] "internal hits" [...] on the starship proper. Furthermore, all weapons (except drones) have a prescribed arc of fire and each type of weapon (except the drone) has its own peculiar [...] "bands" [...] of effectiveness within which its hit probabilities and damage ratings vary. This last feature of the game system is particularly stark with its provision for [...] "overloaded" [...] torpedo weapons, in which hit probabilities for targets at ranges greater than 8 dwindle to zero (overloaded torpedoes burn out past this range) and the damage scored becomes decisive (overloaded torpedoes score double damage, except for Hydran torpedoes and the ISC plasmatic pulsars which score half-again damage).|$|E
