500|$|Several of {{the lines}} in the episode proved {{difficult}} for both fans and cast members to embrace. Fans did not readily accept that The Smoking Man was Mulder's father. Davis, who portrayed The Smoking Man, noted that fans {{did not believe the}} revelation because [...] "part of the mystique <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> everybody had their own idea of what was going on." [...] The dialogue in the episode proved difficult for Anderson to present believably. She was troubled that her character was arguing against the existence of extraterrestrials, when in the previous episode her character had encountered an alien shipwreck. When she talked to Carter, she said that she did not [...] "know if [...] do this anymore" [...] because her character was arguing against information that had been confirmed in the first two parts of the episode. Carter explained that there must be conflict between Mulder and Scully for the show's [...] "believer versus skeptic" [...] dynamic to work properly.|$|E
500|$|The two {{original}} songs sung by New Directions {{were rated}} from excellent to abysmal. Benigno gave each song a [...] "B+"; {{he called the}} duet, [...] "Pretending", [...] "lovely". The nicest thing Kubicek wrote <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{it sounded as if}} the lyrics had been [...] "written by a lovesick teenage boy", and he called [...] "Light Up the World" [...] a [...] "trainwreck". Berk was even harsher: [...] "When the show has carte blanche access to every amazing song in the history of popular music, there's something terribly humiliating about watching the kids sing this shit tune as their finale, and do so with such desperate conviction." [...] Gonzalez gave [...] "Light Up the World" [...] a [...] "B+", but said it sounded a [...] "bit too much" [...] like [...] "Loser Like Me", and while Benigno thought it had a better melody than [...] "Loser" [...] and also made [...] "much better use of the Gleeks as a whole", he criticized the chorus for its similarity to [...] "Let It Rock" [...] by Kevin Rudolf. Semigran said it was an [...] "uplifting, if not rather lackluster pop song", yet Hankinson called it his favorite number in the episode.|$|E
500|$|The episode also {{explores the}} idea that Reyes made a deal that {{involved}} becoming the Ghost Rider, {{and now he has}} [...] "this thing in" [...] him that wants to murder people which Reyes is [...] "ambivalent" [...] about. Bell said that this is the main aspect of their version that grounds him in [...] "a sadness ... and a weight", particularly when interacting with his brother Gabe. In terms of the season's overarching plot, Bell said it was important to tell Reyes' origin story in the episode, rather than earlier or later, because it also reveals the [...] "truth about Eli, and they're very connected." [...] He also drew comparison to the Marvel Netflix television series which often wait to tell the origin story of their heroes later in the season, using flashbacks, saying, [...] "It kind of helps {{to know more about the}} character, and be emotionally invested in the character, before you then go back and show what turned them into this person. And so part <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> if you just began with a guy and showed the origin right away, I don't know if it would have been as compelling, I don't know if it would have been as emotional as I think it is. Bell noted that the series always shows Reyes' transformations into Ghost Rider as painful, but when that is shown happening for the first time in this episode [...] "he screams in pain like a lunatic".|$|E

2500|$|With {{both sides}} having good batsmen and weak bowling attacks an {{exceptional}} number of runs were made, especially by Australia {{in the last}} two Tests when they fielded seven specialist batsmen and an all rounder. A record eleven batsmen averaged over 40 in the series and the teams exceeded 500 in an innings three times between them, 400 another four times and England made their highest score in Australia since 1928–29.

2500|$|Introduced on Whitsunday 1549, after {{considerable}} {{debate and}} revision in Parliament—but {{there is no}} evidence that it was ever submitted to either Convocation—it was said to have pleased neither reformers nor their opponents, indeed the Catholic Bishop Gardiner could say <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> it [...] "was patient of a catholic interpretation". It was clearly unpopular in the parishes of Devon and Cornwall where, along with severe social problems, its introduction was one of the causes of the [...] "commotions", or rebellions in the summer of that year, partly because many Cornish people lacked sufficient English to understand it ,. [...] Particularly unpopular was the banning of processions and the sending out of commissioners to enforce the new requirements. There was widespread opposition to the introduction of regular congregational Communion, partly because the extra costs of bread and wine that would fall on the parish; but mainly out of an intense resistance to undertaking in regular worship, a religious practice previously associated with marriage or illness.|$|E

2500|$|By 1985, {{there was}} a {{considerable}} amount of conflicts between band members. Lead singer Joey Ramone {{went so far as to}} withdraw from the writing process despite being a vital part of it on previous records. Joey recalled, [...] "I'd had it with the Ramones. 'Mental Hell' is about that. Part of it came from breaking up with [...] Angela. The other part <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> I had really had it with the band." [...] In later interviews, however, Joey stated that it was not the conflict that made him stop writing, but rather he had [...] "ideas on the backburner." [...] Bassist Dee Dee Ramone said lead guitarist Johnny Ramone was the reason for much of the stress, supposedly not wanting to do songs Joey would write for multiple reasons. Dee Dee related: [...] "Joey will present a great tune and Johnny won't do it because it's this or it's that. 'I'm not going to play minor chords. I'm not going to play lead. I'm not going to come to England.' For God's sake! That's why Joey gotta do his solo album." ...|$|E
2500|$|Panikkar {{says that}} for Nairs the real marriage, {{as opposed to a}} {{symbolic}} one, was sambandham, a word that comes from Sanskrit and translates as [...] "good and close union". The Nair woman had sambandham relationships with Brahmins and Kshatriyas, as well as other Nairs. He is of the opinion that the system existed principally to facilitate the wedding of Nair women to Nambudiri Brahmins. In the Malabar region, only the eldest male member of a Brahmin family was usually allowed to marry within their caste. There were some circumstances in which a younger male was permitted to do so, these being with the consent of the elder son or when he was incapable of marriage. This system was designed to protect their traditions of patrilineality and primogeniture. A consequence <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the younger sons were allowed to marry women from the highest subdivisions of the Nair caste. The Nair women could marry the man who had tied their thali, provided that he was not otherwise restricted by the rules that women were not permitted to marry a man from a lower caste or subdivision, nor to marry anyone in the direct matrilineal line of descent (however far back that may be) or close relatives in the patrilineal line, nor a man less than two years her senior.|$|E

This writer states that at Antioch, near Daphne, {{he met with}} ambassadors from the Indians, who were sent to Augustus Caesar. It appeared from the letter that several persons were mentioned in it, but three only survived, whom he says he saw. The rest had died chiefly in consequence {{of the length of}} the journey. The letter was written in Greek upon a skin; the import <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> Porus was the writer, that although he was sovereign of six hundred kings, yet that he highly esteemed the friendship of Cæsar; {{that he was willing to}} allow him a passage through his country, in whatever part he pleased, and to assist him in any undertaking that was just. Eight naked servants, with girdles round their waists, and fragrant with perfumes, presented the gifts which were brought. The presents were a Hermes (i. e. a man) born without arms, whom I have seen, large snakes, a serpent ten cubits in length, a river tortoise of three cubits in length, and a partridge larger than a vulture. They were accompanied by the person, it is said, who burnt himself to death at Athens. This is the practice with persons in distress, who seek escape from existing calamities, and with others in prosperous circumstances, as was the case with this man. For as everything hitherto had succeeded with him, he thought it necessary to depart, lest some unexpected calamity should happen to him by continuing to live; with a smile, therefore, naked, anointed, and with the girdle round his waist, he leaped upon the pyre.
