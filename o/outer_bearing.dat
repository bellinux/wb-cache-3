60|$|She {{passed out}} and he {{followed}} her. Mr and Mrs Boffin had the curiosity softly to raise a window and look after them as they went down the long street. They walked arm-in-arm, showily enough, but without appearing to interchange a syllable. It might have been fanciful to suppose that under their <b>outer</b> <b>bearing</b> there was something of the shamed air of two cheats who were linked together by concealed handcuffs; but, not so, to suppose that they were haggardly weary of one another, of themselves, and of all this world. In turning the street corner they might have turned out of this world, for anything Mr and Mrs Boffin ever saw {{of them to the}} contrary; for, they set eyes on the Lammles never more.|$|E
5000|$|On 28 January 2002, a wheel {{detached}} from the starboard side of the undercarriage at an aircraft owned by Tyrolean Airways while taxiing before takeoff from Frankfurt Airport. The missing wheel was detected by visual inspection of the aircraft after landing in Salzburg Airport, and the wheel was later recovered. A probable cause was a displaced <b>outer</b> <b>bearing</b> grease seal, causing overheating.|$|E
50|$|During the Second World War, {{a part of}} the Messerschmitt-Company {{was moved}} into the village. From August 1944 to April 1945 was on the site of today's company Dechentreiter the <b>outer</b> <b>bearing</b> Asbach-BÃ¤umenheim. The {{approximately}} 500 concentration camp inmates had to perform forced labor in the production of armaments. While a bomb attack on 19 March 1945, an unknown number of concentration camp prisoners died. There is a memorial stone which reminds of the victims.|$|E
50|$|The ensuing {{investigation}} cited corrosion {{from water}} buildup due to inadequate drainage as a cause. During road mending some 10 years before, the highway drains had been deliberately blocked {{and the crew}} failed to unblock them when the road work was completed. Rainwater leaked down through the pin bearings, causing them to rust. The <b>outer</b> <b>bearings</b> were fracture-critical and non-redundant, a design flaw of this particular type of structure. The bearings were difficult to inspect close-up, although traces of rust could be seen near the affected bearings.|$|R

When he became the Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, his Saxon arms were his British arms inverted, as follows: the ducal arms of Saxony charged with an inescutcheon of the royal arms of the United Kingdom differenced with a label argent of three points, the <b>outer</b> points <b>bearing</b> anchors azure, and the inner a cross gules.|$|R
50|$|Roller {{bearings}} require one-piece {{races for}} both inner and <b>outer</b> <b>bearing</b> tracks. Although split races are possible, they are expensive {{and difficult to}} fit. A simpler means of fitting roller bearings is to enlarge {{the diameter of the}} bearing, so that it becomes larger than the entire crankshaft web. Assembly is now done by putting the outer race of the bearing over the crankshaft axially from one end, rather than by assembling two pieces radially.|$|E
50|$|The orbital wheel was {{designed}} in 1990 by Dominique Mottas of the French Osmos company {{in an attempt}} {{to reduce the number of}} moving parts by removing the center shaft and hub of the wheel and relying upon a circular rim inserted inside the wheel to support it instead. The orbital wheel was created by using two circular bearings inserted inside of each other. The inner bearing provides steering, support, and attachment to the frame. The <b>outer</b> <b>bearing</b> consists of a tire with a brake ring also fixed in. Some of the advantages seen by this design are more accurate steering, less weight, and enhanced braking.|$|E
50|$|The main {{components}} of a VMCM are its two orthogonal cosine response propeller sensors, that directly measure the components of horizontal velocity parallel to their axes. The orientation of the instrument with respect to magnetic north is sensed with a flux-gate compass, which permits to evaluate the direction of flux, providing {{the angle of the}} Y axis with respect to the magnetic North.A microprocessor rotates the X-Y coordinates in the conventional East-West and North-South components of velocity. This is done once each sample interval and, {{at the end of the}} record interval, the conventional components of velocity are averaged and the averages are stored on a cassette magnetic tape. Other components of the system are a bearing retainer, an end cap, an <b>outer</b> <b>bearing</b> race, a ball retainer and bearing balls, an encoder and an epoxy or Noryl plastic disk with four magnets, pressure window, an aluminum disk, two magnetodiodes mounted asymmetrically on a printed circuit ring, a hub, and a shaft with inner races machined in it. The function of the magnetodiodes is detecting the rotation of the propeller sensors.|$|E

40|$|Compressor pistons {{moved by}} {{eccentric}} shaft need no lubricants. Compressor has shaft, middle section is eccentric {{in relation to}} end sections. Driven by brushless dc motor, shaft turns inner races of set of four cam bearings. Outer cam-bearing races in turn actuate four pistons spaced equally apart, around and along shaft. Each <b>outer</b> <b>bearing</b> race held in position by pressure exerted on it by piston. Because no frictional motion between piston and <b>outer</b> <b>bearing</b> race, lubricant between them unnecessary. Cam bearings themselves contain potted internal lubricant.

40|$|Equations for {{the flow}} rate, load capacity, and {{friction}} torque for a conical hydrostatic bearing were developed. These equations were solved by a digital computer program to determine bearing configurations for minimum friction torque. Design curves are presented that show optimal bearing dimensions for minimum friction torque {{as a function}} of dimensionless flow rate for a range of dimensionless load capacity. Results are shown for both laminar and turbulent flow conditions. The results indicate that hydrostatic pocket friction is {{a significant portion of the}} total friction torque. However, the bearing dimensions for a minimum friction design are affected very little by inclusion of pocket friction in the analysis. For laminar flow the values of the outer-land radius ratio X 3 and <b>outer</b> <b>bearing</b> radius ratio X 4 did not change significantly with increasing friction factor. For turbulent flow, the <b>outer</b> <b>bearing</b> radius ratio X 4 did not change with increasing friction factor; therefore the value determined for X 4 in the laminar flow case is valid for all turbulent flows...|$|E
