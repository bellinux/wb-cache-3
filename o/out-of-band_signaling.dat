50|$|<b>Out-of-band</b> <b>signaling</b> is {{telecommunication}} signaling on {{a dedicated}} channel separate from that used for the telephone call. <b>Out-of-band</b> <b>signaling</b> has been used since Signaling System No. 6 (SS6) {{was introduced in the}} 1970s, and also in Signalling System No. 7 (SS7) in 1980 which became the standard for signaling among exchanges ever since.|$|E
50|$|Some digital trunks, such as SS7, use <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signaling</b> to {{indicate}} termination of a call.|$|E

5000|$|A {{band-pass filter}} (BPF) to reduce image response. This removes any signals {{at the image}} frequency, which would {{otherwise}} interfere with the desired signal. It also prevents strong <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signals</b> from saturating the input stages.|$|R
50|$|How {{the user}} {{activates}} this feature {{depends on their}} phone system — generally it is either in-band-signaling DTMF sequence such as the *57 Vertical service code or a special button attached to their phone generating an out-of-band signal. For analogue services, many exchanges will interpret DTMF sequences to activate POTS. Digital services, such as ISDN or GSM, enable the CPE to activate MCI via <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signaling.</b> Often with PABXs with analogue phone connections, the PABX will interpret the DTMF and then activate the <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signaling.</b>|$|E
50|$|Most analog {{telephone}} adapters for Internet-based telecommunications (VoIP) recognize and translate DTMF tones but ignore dial pulses, an issue which also exists for some PBX systems. Like cellular handsets, telephones designed for voice-over-IP use <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signaling</b> {{to send the}} dialed number.|$|E
50|$|The {{international}} standard for telephone signaling utilizes dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) signaling, more {{commonly known as}} touch-tone dialing. It replaced the older and slower pulse dial system. The push-button format is also used for all cell phones, but with <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signaling</b> of the dialed number.|$|E
50|$|Modern prepay {{mobile phone}} {{solutions}} use an <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signalling</b> called the Intelligent Network {{to monitor the}} credit {{without the need for}} hairpinning trunks. These are developed as international standards which allow prepay use of a phone all over the world.|$|R
50|$|Exceptions are one {{widely used}} scheme for solving this problem. An error {{condition}} {{is not considered}} a return value of the function at all; normal control flow is disrupted and explicit handling of the error takes place automatically. They are an example of <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signalling.</b>|$|R
50|$|Selective tuning is {{the process}} by which the radio {{frequency}} (RF) of the television channel is selected by a receiver from within a band of transmitted RF signals. The tuner usually performs the function of frequency-agile selection, along with rejection of unwanted <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signals.</b>|$|R
50|$|Mobile {{telephones}} and most voice-over-IP systems use <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signaling</b> {{and do not}} send any digits until the entire number has been keyed by the user. Many VoIP systems {{are based on the}} Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), which uses a form of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) for addressing, instead of digits alone.|$|E
50|$|In the 1970s and 80s some trunks were {{modified}} {{to filter out}} SF tone arriving from a caller. Later in the 20th century, long-distance companies adopted the <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signaling</b> system Signaling System 7. This system separated the voice and signaling channels, {{making it impossible to}} generate these signals from an ordinary phone line.|$|E
50|$|In telecommunications, in-band {{signaling}} is the sending of control information {{within the same}} band or channel used for voice or video. This {{is in contrast to}} <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signaling</b> which is sent over a different channel, or even over a separate network. In-band signals may often be heard by telephony participants, while out-of-band signals are inaccessible to the user.|$|E
30|$|Using {{an active}} {{component}} and a spreading code correlation algorithm, our high sensitivity wake-up radio provides good rejection of out-of-band and in-band interference {{and reduces the}} false alarm rate to reduce power consumption and latency. As for other wake-up radios that use passive components, such as diode rectifiers, they detect <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signals,</b> increasing their false wake-up packets, power consumption and latency.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Microring {{resonators}} side {{coupled to}} signal waveguides provide compact, narrow band, and large free spectral range photonic channel dropping wavelength switch. Wavelength switch with improved passband characteristics and larger <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signal</b> rejection are realized through the coupling of rings. The {{analysis of these}} devices is demonstrated by the novel method of coupling. The response of switch comprised of different coupling gap may be written down by attenuation ratio...|$|R
50|$|CAS {{potentially}} {{results in}} lower available bandwidth for the payload. For example, in the PSTN {{the use of}} <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signaling</b> within a fixed bandwidth reduces a 64 kbit/s DS0 to 56 kbit/s. Because of this, and the inherent security benefits of separating the control lines from the payload, telephone systems introduced since the 1960s rely more on common-channel signaling (CCS).|$|E
5000|$|The {{development}} of digital switching equipment and <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signaling</b> prevented {{the use of}} blue boxes. The [...] "blue box" [...] terminology has therefore been recycled for other purposes. The hacking community evolved into other endeavors and there currently exists a commercially published hacking magazine, titled 2600, {{a reference to the}} 2600 Hz tone that was once central to so much of telephone hacking.|$|E
50|$|As {{a method}} of in-band signaling, DTMF tones were also used by cable {{television}} broadcasters to indicate the start and stop times of local insertion points during station breaks {{for the benefit of}} cable companies. Until better, <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signaling</b> equipment was developed in the 1990s, fast, unacknowledged, and loud DTMF tone sequences could be heard during the commercial breaks of cable channels in the United States and elsewhere.|$|E
50|$|It is {{possible}} to also get a bad picture if the signal strength of the TV transmitter is too high. An attenuator inserted in the antenna lead-in wire may be used if the television receiver displays signs of overload in the RF front end. Strong <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signals</b> may also affect television reception and may require band-pass filters to reduce {{the level of the}} undesired signal at the receiver.|$|R
50|$|The PHY {{layer is}} {{responsible}} for detecting the other SATA/device on a cable, and link initialization. During the link-initialization process, the PHY {{is responsible for}} locally generating special <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signals</b> by switching the transmitter between electrical-idle and specific 10b-characters in a defined pattern, negotiating a mutually supported signalling rate (1.5, 3.0, or 6.0 Gbit/s), and finally synchronizing to the far-end device's PHY-layer data stream. During this time, no data is sent from the link-layer.|$|R

50|$|Channel-associated {{signaling}} (CAS), {{also known}} as per-trunk signaling (PTS), {{is a form of}} digital communication signaling. As with most telecommunication signaling methods, it uses routing information to direct the payload of voice or data to its destination. With CAS signaling, this routing information is encoded and transmitted in the same channel as the payload itself. This information can be transmitted in the same band (in-band signaling) or a separate band (<b>out-of-band</b> <b>signaling)</b> to the payload.|$|E

Until <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signaling</b> equipment was developed in the 1990s, fast, unacknowledged DTMF tone sequences could be heard during the commercial breaks of cable channels in the United States and elsewhere. Previously, terrestrial television stations used DTMF tones to control remote transmitters.|$|E
5000|$|E0 (standardized as ITU G.703) is the European {{equivalent}} of the North American DS0 for carrying [...] However, there are some subtle differences in implementation. Voice signals are encoded for carriage over E0 according to ITU G.711. Note that when a T-carrier system is used as in North America, robbed bit signaling can mean that a DS0 channel carried over that system is not an error-free bit-stream. The <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signaling</b> used in the European E-carrier system avoids this.|$|E
5000|$|Software {{flow control}} is a method of flow control used in {{computer}} data links, especially RS-232 serial. It uses special codes, transmitted in-band, over the primary communications channel. These codes are generally called XOFF and XON (from [...] "transmit off" [...] and [...] "transmit on", respectively). Thus, [...] "software flow control" [...] is sometimes called [...] "XON/XOFF flow control". This {{is in contrast to}} flow control via dedicated <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signals</b> — [...] "hardware flow control" [...] — such as RS-232 RTS/CTS.|$|R
50|$|Typically a {{spectrum}} analyzer {{is used to}} measure the emission levels of the DUT across a wide band of frequencies (frequency domain). Specialized spectrum analyzers for EMC testing are available, called EMI test receivers or EMI analyzers. These incorporate bandwidths and detectors as specified by international EMC standards. EMI receivers along with specified transducers can often be used for both conducted and radiated emissions. Pre-selector filters may also be used to reduce the effect of strong <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signals</b> on the front-end of the receiver.|$|R
30|$|Overall, the {{achievable}} {{interference rejection}} ratios are well {{in line with}} demands derived in Section 5. From 16 -QAM signal point of view, the demanded rejection (see Figure 7) is fulfilled with selective STF up to the relative blocker power of 20 dB. At this point, the full-band power to the 16 -QAM signal power ratio can be approximated to be 23 dB, neglecting the minor effect of other <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signals</b> than the two mirror-frequency blockers. At this point, the achieved interference rejection ratio of 15 dB fulfills the demand of 13 dB with 3 -bit quantization (see Figure 7).|$|R
5000|$|The {{class of}} {{vulnerabilities}} Draper and others discovered {{was limited to}} call-routing switches that employed in-band signaling, whereas newer equipment relies almost exclusively on <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signaling,</b> the use of separate circuits to transmit voice and signals. Though they no longer serve a practical use, the Cap'n Crunch whistles did become valued collector's items. Some hackers sometimes go by the handle [...] "Captain Crunch" [...] even today; 2600: The Hacker Quarterly is named after this whistle frequency.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the driving}} factors in {{developing}} clock networks was the broadcast industry. Television, in particular, operates on a very strict schedule, where each second of airtime is planned {{ahead of time and}} must be executed precisely. A central clock system allows a television station's master control and production personnel to work within that schedule. A clock network synchronized to the standard UTC time also allows different television facilities to coordinate their activities without complicated <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signaling.</b> It also provides accurate timing to equipment in stations that are becoming increasingly automated.|$|E
50|$|SS5 {{and earlier}} systems used in-band signaling, {{in which the}} call-setup {{information}} was sent by playing special multi-frequency tones into the telephone lines, known as bearer channels. As the bearer channel was directly accessible by users, it was exploited with devices such as the blue box, which played the tones required for call control and routing. As a remedy, SS6 and SS7 implemented <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signaling,</b> carried in a separate signaling channel, thus keeping the speech path separate. SS6 and SS7 {{are referred to as}} common-channel signaling (CCS) protocols, or Common Channel Interoffice Signalling (CCIS) systems.|$|E
