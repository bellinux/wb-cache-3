5|$|In {{the spring}} of that year, Bush's disapproval ratings reached the highest ever {{recorded}} for any president in the 70-year history of the Gallup poll, with 69percent of those polled in April 2008 disapproving of the job Bush was doing as president and 28percent approving—although the majority (66percent) <b>of</b> <b>Republicans</b> still approved of his job performance.|$|E
5|$|Lamont won {{the primary}} with 51.79 {{percent of the}} vote as opposed to Lieberman's 48.21 percent; it was the only Senate race in 2006 where an {{incumbent}} lost re-nomination. In his concession speech, Lieberman announced that he would stand by his prior statements that he'd run as an independent if he lost the Democratic primary. Lieberman won the general election with approximately 50 {{percent of the vote}}; exit polls showed that Lieberman won the vote of 33 percent of Democrats, 54 percent of independents, and 70 percent <b>of</b> <b>Republicans.</b>|$|E
5|$|Specific {{elements}} were popular {{across the political}} spectrum, while others, such as the mandate to purchase insurance, were widely disliked. In a 2012 poll 44% supported the law, with 56% against. By party affiliation, 75% of Democrats, 27% of Independents and 14% <b>of</b> <b>Republicans</b> favored the law overall. 82% favored banning insurance companies from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, 61% favored allowing children to stay on their parents' insurance until age 26, 72% supported requiring companies with more than 50 employees to provide insurance for their employees, and 39% supported the individual mandate to own insurance or pay a penalty. By party affiliation, 19% <b>of</b> <b>Republicans,</b> 27% of Independents, and 59% of Democrats favored the mandate. Other polls showed additional provisions receiving majority support, including the creation of insurance exchanges, pooling small businesses and the uninsured with other consumers so that more people {{can take advantage of}} large group pricing benefits and providing subsidies to individuals and families to make health insurance more affordable.|$|E
25|$|A Pew Research Center poll {{released}} in March 2014 found 54% of Americans favor same-sex marriage, 39% oppose, and 7% don't know. It also researched support for same-sex marriage among Republican leaning {{voters in the}} United States. 61% <b>of</b> <b>Republican</b> leaning voters aged 18–29 support allowing same-sex couples to marry, while only 27% <b>of</b> <b>Republican</b> leaning voters over 50 years of age are supportive. 52% <b>of</b> <b>Republican</b> voters aged 18–50 support same-sex marriage.|$|R
5000|$|Freedom's Watch also {{purchased}} advertisements {{during the}} 2008 election cycle in support <b>of</b> <b>Republican</b> congressional candidates. For example, the group purchased $550,000 in advertising in the Mississippi 1st district special election in support <b>of</b> <b>Republican</b> candidate Greg Davis. [...] The group also ran ads in support <b>of</b> <b>Republican</b> candidates {{in two other}} special elections to fill vacant house seats in Illinois and Louisiana. All three Republicans were subsequently defeated by their Democratic challengers in historically Republican districts.|$|R
50|$|In the CBS News / New York Times poll {{conducted}} June 24-28, 2011, 67% <b>of</b> <b>Republican</b> voters approve <b>of</b> {{the plan to}} withdraw all U.S. troops {{by the end of}} summer 2012, and 75% <b>of</b> <b>Republican</b> voters want at least one-third of U.S. troops withdrawn by the end of summer 2012: the plurality 41% <b>of</b> <b>Republican</b> voters want more than one-third of U.S. troops withdrawn in this timeframe, 34% want about a third, while 18% thought it should be less than one-third.|$|R
5|$|The United Nations Security Council {{brokered}} the Renville Agreement in {{an attempt}} to rectify the collapsed Linggarjati Agreement. The agreement was ratified in January 1948 and recognised a cease-fire along the so-called 'Van Mook line'; an artificial line which connected the most advanced Dutch positions. Many Republican positions, however, were still held behind the Dutch lines. The agreement also required referenda to be held on the political future of the Dutch held areas. The apparent reasonableness <b>of</b> <b>Republicans</b> garnered much important American goodwill.|$|E
5|$|According to a MinnPost poll, Minnesotans {{blamed the}} Republican {{legislature}} {{more for the}} shutdown. Overall, 42% said Republicans in the legislature were more responsible, 21% said the DFL governor was more responsible, and 22% volunteered an answer that they were equally to blame. As expected, partisans blamed the other party more; only 10% <b>of</b> <b>Republicans</b> blamed the legislature more, and only 2% of DFLers blamed Dayton more. Following the shutdown, DFL Representative Phyllis Kahn authored a continuing appropriations bill that would prevent government shutdowns {{in the event of}} disagreements between the governor and legislature, as she had done in several past sessions. The House commissioned a policy brief from its research department, published in December 2011, that looked into what such a bill would require. The brief noted that such ideas had been considered before, including after the 2005 shutdown, and had been abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{majority}} of those advocating a name change are Democrats, {{there is no indication that}} the issue is of any real significance in electoral decisions given that Native Americans are such a small percentage of the electorate and are not likely to influence the outcome of any election. There are only eight states where Natives make up greater than 2 percent of the population: Alaska, Arizona, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Wyoming. However, polls show a definite political difference in the opinion of the general public, with only 58% of Democrats opposing a name change versus 89% <b>of</b> <b>Republicans.</b> Statements by political figures have generally been expressions of personal opinion rather than recommendations for government action. There have also been non-binding resolutions advocating name change proposed in New Jersey and passed in Minneapolis, New York State and California.|$|E

5|$|Hanna, {{a wealthy}} industrialist, had {{successfully}} managed McKinley's 1896 presidential campaign. The Ohio Republican Party was bitterly {{divided between the}} faction led by McKinley, Hanna and Sherman, and one led by Ohio's other senator, Joseph B. Foraker. Bushnell was a Foraker ally, {{and it was only}} under pressure from McKinley and others that he agreed to appoint Hanna to fill Sherman's Senate seat. After Hanna gained the appointment, Republican legislators kept their majority in the November 1897 election, apparently ensuring Hanna's election once the new body met in January 1898. However, before the legislative session, the Democrats allied with a number <b>of</b> <b>Republicans,</b> mostly from the Foraker faction, hoping {{to take control of the}} legislature and defeat Hanna.|$|E
5|$|In June 2014, WKMS {{reported}} that Bevin had remained politically {{active in the}} aftermath of his defeat by McConnell, and an email to his followers calling on Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear, a Democrat, to denounce new carbon regulations issued by the EPA fueled speculation that Bevin would seek the Republican gubernatorial nomination in 2015. The station also cited an anonymous source that said Bevin would campaign for Rand Paul's Senate seat in 2016 if Paul's expected presidential bid kept him from running for re-election. An August 2014 survey by Public Policy Polling showed that 25% <b>of</b> <b>Republicans</b> wanted Bevin to be the party's gubernatorial nominee, ahead of declared candidates James Comer (20%) and Hal Heiner (18%).|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} years of the American Civil War and the Reconstruction Era that followed, Congress {{repeatedly}} debated the rights of the millions of black former slaves. By 1869, amendments had been passed to abolish slavery and provide citizenship and equal protection under the laws, but the election of Ulysses S. Grant to the presidency in 1868 convinced a majority <b>of</b> <b>Republicans</b> that protecting the franchise of black male voters was important for the party's future. On February 26, 1869, after rejecting more sweeping versions of a suffrage amendment, Congress proposed a compromise amendment banning franchise restrictions on the basis of race, color, or previous servitude. After surviving a difficult ratification fight, the amendment was certified as duly ratified and part of the Constitution on March 30, 1870.|$|E

5|$|Most of the monarchies in Europe are {{constitutional}} monarchies, {{which means}} that the monarch does not influence the politics of the state: either the monarch is legally prohibited from doing so, or the monarch does not utilize the political powers vested in the office by convention. The exceptions are Liechtenstein and Monaco, which are usually considered semi-constitutional monarchies due to the large influence the princes still have on politics, and the Vatican City, which is a theocratic absolute elective monarchy. There is currently no major campaign to abolish the monarchy (see monarchism and republicanism) in any of the twelve states, although there is a significant minority <b>of</b> <b>republicans</b> in many of them (e.g. the political organisation Republic in the United Kingdom). Currently seven of the twelve monarchies are members of the European Union: Belgium, Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Polls {{consistently}} {{indicated a}} tight {{race for the}} November general election. Negative ads from both sides dominated the campaign, with Obama's proclaiming that Romney shipped jobs overseas while at Bain Capital and kept money in offshore tax havens and Swiss bank accounts. A related issue dealt with Romney's purported responsibility for actions at Bain Capital after taking the Olympics post. Romney faced demands from Democrats to release additional years of his tax returns, an action a number <b>of</b> <b>Republicans</b> also felt would be wise; after being adamant {{that he would not}} do that, he released summaries of them in late September. During May and June, the Obama campaign spent heavily and was able to paint a negative image of Romney in voters' minds before the Romney campaign could construct a positive one.|$|E
5|$|The Second Republic was {{a source}} of hope to the poorest in Spanish society and a threat to the richest, but had broad support from all {{segments}} of society. Niceto Alcalá-Zamora was the first prime minister of the Republic. The wealthier landowners and the middle class accepted the Republic {{because of the lack of}} any suitable alternative. Elections to a constituent Cortes in June 1931 returned a large majority <b>of</b> <b>Republicans</b> and Socialists, with the PSOE gaining 116 seats and Lerroux's Radical Party 94. Lerroux became foreign minister. The government was controlled by a Republican–Socialist coalition, whose members had differing objectives. Some more conservative members believed that the removal of the monarchy was enough by itself, but the Socialists and leftist Republicans demanded much wider reforms.|$|E

5|$|The Senate later acquitted Clinton on both charges. The Senate {{refused to}} meet to hold an {{impeachment}} trial {{before the end of}} the old term, so the trial was held over until the next Congress. Clinton was represented by Washington law firm Williams & Connolly. The Senate finished a twenty-one-day trial on February 12, 1999, with the vote of 55 Not Guilty/45 Guilty on the perjury charge and 50 Not Guilty/50 Guilty on the obstruction of justice charge. Both votes fell short of the Constitutional two-thirds majority requirement to convict and remove an officeholder. The final vote was generally along party lines, with no Democrats voting guilty, and only a handful <b>of</b> <b>Republicans</b> voting not guilty.|$|E
5|$|The {{war effort}} {{was the source}} of {{continued}} disparagement of Lincoln, and dominated his time and attention. From the start, it was clear that bipartisan support would be essential to success in the war effort, and any manner of compromise alienated factions {{on both sides of the}} aisle, such as the appointment <b>of</b> <b>Republicans</b> and Democrats to command positions in the Union Army. Copperheads criticized Lincoln for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue. Conversely, the Radical Republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery. On August 6, 1861, Lincoln signed the Confiscation Act that authorized judiciary proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the Confederate war effort. In practice, the law had little effect, but it did signal political support for abolishing slavery in the Confederacy.|$|E
5|$|There {{were four}} Saxbe fixes for appointees of presidents prior to Barack Obama. The first two rollbacks {{concerned}} appointees <b>of</b> <b>Republicans</b> William Howard Taft and Richard Nixon, {{and the last}} two were implemented for appointees of Democrats Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton. Congress approved two more in the weeks preceding Obama's presidency in preparation for his designated Cabinet nominees. Since the 1980s, Saxbe fixes have only been temporary, extending to {{the conclusion of the}} term for which the sitting member of Congress was elected. The Clause has received relatively little scholarly or judicial attention; the sparse extant debate centers on whether the reduction of salary satisfies the Ineligibility Clause, or whether affected members of Congress are ineligible for appointment in spite of the reduction.|$|E
