5|$|Following a {{tradition}} which started with Userkaf, {{the founder of}} the Fifth Dynasty, Menkauhor built a temple to the sun god Ra. He was the last pharaoh to do so. His successors, Djedkare Isesi and Unas, abandoned this practice as the cult of Ra declined at the expense of that of Osiris.

5|$|During {{the decay}} of plutonium, three types of {{radiation}} are released—alpha, beta, and gamma. Alpha, beta, and gamma radiation are all forms of ionizing radiation. Either acute or longer-term exposure carries a danger of serious health outcomes including radiation sickness, genetic damage, cancer, and death. The danger increases {{with the amount of}} exposure. Alpha radiation can travel <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> distance and cannot travel through the outer, dead layer of human skin. Beta radiation can penetrate human skin, but cannot go {{all the way through the}} body. Gamma radiation can go all the way through the body.|$|E

Instead, by virtue of managing the opposing campaign, Clements became the leader of a Democratic faction that opposed Chandler for the next three decades.|$|E

Debuting in January 1961, The Avengers became an international success, although in later years its premise differed somewhat from Newman's initial set-up, veering into more humorous territory rather than remaining a gritty thriller.|$|E
