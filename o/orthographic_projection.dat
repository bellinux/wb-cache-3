[...] He noted that the temple's measurements given in the Bible are mathematical problems, related to solutions for [...] and the volume of a hemisphere, , and in a larger sense that they were references {{to the size of}} the Earth and man's place and proportion to it.|$|E

2500|$|The Gall–Peters {{projection}} {{was first}} described in 1855 by clergyman James Gall, who presented {{it along with}} two other projections at the Glasgow meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science (the BA). He gave it the name [...] "orthographic" [...] and formally published his work in 1885 in the Scottish Geographical Magazine. The projection is suggestive of the <b>Orthographic</b> <b>projection</b> in that distances between parallels of the Gall–Peters are a constant multiple of the distances between the parallels of the orthographic. That constant is √2.|$|E
2500|$|In 1967 Arno Peters, a German filmmaker, {{devised a}} map {{projection}} identical to Gall's <b>orthographic</b> <b>projection</b> and presented it in 1973 as a [...] "new invention". He promoted it as a superior {{alternative to the}} Mercator projection, which was suited to navigation but also used commonly in world maps. The Mercator projection increasingly inflates the sizes of regions according to their distance from the equator. This inflation results, for example, in a representation of Greenland that is larger than Africa, which has a geographic area 14 times greater than Greenland's. Since much of the technologically underdeveloped world lies near the equator, these countries appear smaller on a Mercator and therefore, according to Peters, seem less significant. On Peters's projection, by contrast, areas of equal size on the globe are also equally sized on the map. By using his [...] "new" [...] projection, Peters argued that poorer, less powerful nations could be restored to their rightful proportions. This reasoning has been picked up by many educational and religious bodies, leading to adoption of the Gall–Peters projection among some socially concerned groups, including Oxfam, National Council of Churches, New Internationalist magazine, and the Mennonite Central Committee. However, Peters's choice of 45°N/S for the standard parallels means that the regions displayed with highest accuracy include Europe and the US, and not the tropics.|$|E

In particular, we analyse {{the similarities between the}} processes associated with perspective and <b>orthographic</b> <b>projections.</b> Based on a series of psychophysical experiments using white noise stimuli presented in perspective projection, we suggest that the visual system may characterize the spatial-frequency spectrum by the average peak frequency (APF), which is the same characteristic as that used in <b>orthographic</b> <b>projections.</b> We demonstrate that normalization of the APF yields an estimate of depth in perspective projection. Our previous studies suggest that the APF is used in <b>orthographic</b> <b>projections,</b> where the output of the normalization process represents a linear approximation of surface slant.
