A total of 229people– just 4.6% of attempted escapees, representing less than one in twenty– made it across the fence.

5|$|Off the pitch, Miller privately {{decided that}} he would not honour his Rawtenstall contract. He {{secretly}} accepted an offer to relocate to Sydney to work as a liquor salesman and play cricket. Back in a good frame of mind for the Fourth Test in Adelaide, Miller took one wicket in each innings, but he shone with the bat. After England had made 460, Miller came in at 3/207, and was 23 not out by the close of the second day. He hit the first ball of the next day for six, and accumulated 67 runs in the opening 71 minutes, to reach his maiden Test century. The Englishmen utilised leg theory to prevent easy scoring, but as the tail began to be dismissed, Miller accelerated, launching drives into the crowd, despite the presence of four men <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence.</b> Miller ended unbeaten on 141 but the match petered out into a high-scoring draw. Before the last Test, Miller played for Victoria against England, taking 4/65.|$|E
5|$|The {{last big}} match {{of the season}} was a one-off at Lord's between England and Dominions, a {{combined}} team of players from the British Commonwealth. Miller managed 26 in the Dominions' first innings of 307, {{before coming to the}} crease at 2/60 in the second innings with England still leading by 80 runs. Miller settled in quickly, hitting his second ball through the covers for four and moved to 49 in 49 minutes. He brought up his half-century by lifting Hollies straight back into the crowd. Three balls later, he hit another ball to the same point. At stumps, he was 61 not out with Dominions at 3/145. The next morning, his partner Martin Donnelly was dismissed and replaced by Dominions captain Learie Constantine. Miller then began his attack, hitting the dual leg spin pairing of Hollies and Wright to all parts of the ground. At one point, all the fielders except for the wicketkeeper and the bowler were <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence.</b>|$|E

5|$|On {{the first}} {{ball of the}} third morning, Miller hooked {{the ball into the}} crowd, landing {{just in front of the}} governor's VIP box to move to 39. He quickly {{accumulated}} another 61 runs in 71 minutes to reach his maiden Test century. Miller and Johnson added a further 79 runs in the morning, of which the latter contributed only 17 before being dismissed for 52, such was Miller's rate of scoring. Miller did not play more expansively after reaching triple figures, as three wickets fell at the other end for 24 runs and the Englishmen, particularly Yardley, utilised leg theory to stifle the scoring. As the English bowlers continued to regularly take tail-end wickets, Miller accelerated again, launching drives into the crowd as England stationed four men <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> waiting in vain to catch one of his lofted strokes. Miller ended unbeaten on 141 from 198 balls as Australia took a first innings lead, but the match petered into a high-scoring draw. In the second innings, Miller and Lindwall unsuccessfully tried to attack Hutton and Washbrook with bouncers as the English openers registered a century partnership. Miller took Bedser's wicket to end with 1/34 from 11 overs as England reached 8/340 before declaring. Miller was not required to bat after Australia were set 314 runs to win in 195 minutes; they reached 1/215 when time ran out.|$|E

25|$|Australia {{started the}} day slowly as the Indian pace pair of R. P. Singh and Sharma bowled accurately. After a short rain delay, the Australians began {{to seize the}} {{initiative}} and soon wiped out their first innings deficit. Approaching lunch, Jaques was out to Kumble after a lofted sweep went to the fielder <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence.</b> Ponting came to the crease but was caught at silly point off the first ball he faced from Harbhajan, sparking major celebrations among the Indians, including two half-commando rolls from Harbhajan. After lunch, Hayden and Hussey rebuilt Australia's innings with the former scoring another hundred. Ponting acted as his runner due to an injury he collected while batting. Hayden was eventually dismissed by Kumble for 123 while attempting a reverse sweep. The very next ball Kumble claimed Clarke for a golden duck. Clarke stood his ground as he was caught at slip off the glove, and only walked after the umpire had given him out. On a hat trick, Kumble hit Symonds on the pads sparking a loud appeal which was turned down. Symonds and Hussey saw Australia to stumps with a healthy lead.|$|E

The wicket-keeper-captain Colin Hossack won the toss and batted, but the Queensland Country XI were all out for 165 Wilfred Brown (24) and Malcolm Campbell (40) adding 65 for the first wicket, but then they lost 7 wickets for 19 runs until John Page (31) and Hossack (25) added 39 for the eighth-wicket. David Larter took 3/39 and Ray Illingworth 3/46. By the end of the first day the MCC were 258/3 with Peter Parfitt hitting 98 in 72 minutes, winning prizes for the fastest 50 in the match and the first six to be hit. Ted Dexter, the main draw in the side, played carefully so as to be in for the Saturday, but was caught <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> for 2. Tom Graveney made 118, David Sheppard 67, Ray Illingworth 58 and Dexter declared on 423/9 the next day. David Allen (5/57) bowled out the locals for 138 for an innings win, even though Brown made 47, having batted for 7 hours in three innings against the MCC and being hit for 21 runs off an over by the Darling Downs batsman Don Bickel, who was awarded a trophy for his 44 in 38 minutes.|$|E
