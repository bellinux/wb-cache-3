50|$|The Dadiwan culture (ca. 7900-7200 BP) was a Neolithic culture located {{primarily}} in the eastern portion of Gansu and Shaanxi provinces in modern China. The culture {{takes its name from}} the deepest cultural layer found during the original excavation of the type site at Dadiwan. The remains of millet, pigs and dogs have been found in sites associated with the culture, which is itself defined by a thin-walled, cord-marked ceramic tradition sometimes referred to as Laoguantai. The site has continued to produce new information about the Dadiwan culture, for example, recent biogeochemical analyses reveal that dogs living at Dadiwan from 7900-4900 calBP likely consumed C4 carbon fixation plants throughout the year. Because all other wild animals (like deer and bear) found at the site only consumed C3 plants, it suggests that the natural year-round vegetation was dominated by C3 plants. The only way that dog bones would contain strong C4 signals was if they consumed a rare plant year-round. A likely candidate for this is millet (a C4 grass); and because millet only grows in the summer, the only way that dogs could eat it year round is if humans were feeding it to them. Therefore, this represents some of the earliest evidence for agricultural production (cultivation, harvesting, and storing of seed crops) in East Asia. The Dadiwan culture shares a variety <b>of</b> <b>common</b> features, in <b>pottery,</b> architecture, and economy, with the Cishan and Peiligang cultures of eastern China.|$|R

2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} first World War, an {{opportunity}} arose to revive the high-quality work of antiquity, driven as much by Hewett's curiosity about the potters of the past as anything else. He made the acquaintance of a potter at San Ildefonso Pueblo named Maria Martinez -- a name that would become a watchword in Native American art. Hewett set Maria and her husband Julian, at that point proficient artisans in a polychrome style <b>of</b> <b>pottery</b> <b>common</b> at San Ildefonso, the task of trying to reproduce the colors and textures seen in the ancestral work of Frijoles Canyon and its vicinity. Almost serendipitously, the Martinezes developed a [...] "black-on-black" [...] style that not only evoked the ancient work but also produced pieces attractive to the modern collector. Hewett, {{in conjunction with the}} eccentric entrepreneurs and philanthropists Vera von Blumenthal and Rose Dougan, detected in this pottery a commercial opportunity that the puebleños would go on to develop into a major and economically significant cottage industry in the region. The Santa Fe Indian Market, probably the world's leading exposition for Native American art, has an economic impact on northern New Mexico estimated at nearly $20,000,000 annually. San Ildefonso (and Santa Clara) black-on-black pottery, some of it by descendants of Maria and Julian Martinez, features prominently to this day among the [...] "Best of Show" [...] award winners at the Market, as well as more pedestrian but still high-quality work that has far transcended the tourist trinkets that were being produced in the pueblos {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century.|$|R
50|$|<b>Common</b> <b>pottery</b> item include large {{pots and}} casseroles used for cooking {{traditional}} {{dishes such as}} rice and mole poblano. These pieces are glazed on the interior, with the outside decorated with black and or pastillaje (small bits of clay rolled into designs). Most of the pottery {{is made in the}} city of Puebla, especially in the Barrio de la Luz neighborhood. This kind of pottery-making remains a viable occupation because of the creativity and organization of the artisans who work principally to make large size cooking utensils. Production can be highly specialized among artisans, with those dedicated to different aspects of the process such as molding and firing. The making of these utensils survives because traditional rural cooking techniques still survive {{in many parts of the}} state, where meals are prepared in clay pots over wood fires, especially for major festivities and celebrations.|$|R

Between 1988 and 1990 a shipwreck tentatively dated to the 5 th century B. C. was excavated off the coast of Israel at Ma'agan Michael by Dr. Elisha Linder of the Center for Maritime Studies. This study presents one category of material from the Ma'agan Michael shipwreck: the pottery. The goal of this analysis is to provide an indication of the ship's date, origin, and route, as well as insights into shipboard life and the utilization of shipboard space. The majority of wares are personal items for shipboard use such as bowls, jars, jugs, lamps, and a cooking pot. Transport amphoras of the basket handle and "Persian" storage jar types are represented only in small numbers. The pottery can be dated from approximately 425 to 400 B. C. The distribution of ceramics throughout the ship suggests two main storage areas: one in the ship's stern for the storage of food preparation and cooking vessels and one just forward of the mast step associated with the ship's water jar. A number <b>of</b> vessels are <b>common</b> types known from Persian period strata along the Levantine coast although many vessels, especially the jugs, have good Cypriot parallels. Attic and East Greek(?) wares are represented by only a few examples. The predominance <b>of</b> Cypriot <b>pottery</b> <b>common</b> to the southern coast from Amathus to Kition suggests a west-east route from Cyprus to any number of Phoenician settlements along the coast of Syria-Palestine...|$|R

50|$|In 1983, G. Möbes {{published}} {{a number of}} new finds from Thuringia. In Großbrembach in Sömmerda a nearly square complex with rounded corners measuring 10.8 x 10.4 metres contains two crouching inhumations lying on their right sides and oriented south-north. The grave ditch was described as partially flat, partially trough shaped. Bright bands in the soil filling seem to indicate the inflow of water. Unetice stone packed graves around it indicate that the flat barrow must have remained well known. A similar complex was investigated in 1974 at Sommerberg near Großfahner in the proximity of Erfurt. It was a 19/17 x 15.5/14.5 metre trapezoid containing a 2.3 metre wide grave. The west side was overlapped by a small burial hut of the Corded Ware culture with several skeletons. This Corded Ware grave in the centre also shows that the main tomb must have remained well known even 1000 years after its construction.

40|$|The ceramic {{assemblage}} {{from previous}} excavations at Crystal River (8 CI 1), a Woodland period mound center on Florida’s west-central coast, exhibits variation in temper and surface treatments indicative of distinct pottery traditions and, perhaps, social groups. I analyzed ceramics from recent, better controlled excavations at Crystal River and the neighboring and partially contemporaneous site of Roberts Island (8 CI 41), using the theoretical framework of communities of practice to evaluate this claim. Analysis suggests {{that while some}} degree of diversity in paste was maintained through all four phases, there was greater homogeneity of paste, {{as well as more}} mixing of paste categories, during Phases 2 and 3. The former was an interval marked by intensive settlement at Crystal River, and the dominance of limestone tempered pottery suggests the emergence <b>of</b> a <b>common,</b> locally-based <b>pottery</b> making tradition. A switch to sand as a tempering agent in Phase 3 probably reflects greater dispersal of settlement, and specifically a shift to the occupation of coastal islands. Trends in surface treatments may also appear to reflect changes in settlement, although the pattern here is less straightforward owing to broader trends in ceramic decoration. The vast majority of pottery in each phase is plain, but plain pottery is particularly dominant (and the diversity of surface treatments correspondingly low) during the peak in settlement in Phase 2. As with temper, this may suggest that pottery making practices converged, as initially disparate groups lived together in closer proximity, perhaps creating a common social identity. As settlement became more dispersed in Phase 3, pottery making traditions again became more diverse. This perhaps reflects increased isolation of households, although it no doubt also stems from a regional trend toward more variety in ceramic decoration. In Phase 4, plain pottery again became dominant, a trend typical of the terminal Late Woodland. In general, the analysis suggests that temper and surface treatment track changes in settlement, and thus might be reasonably inferred to also track the extent to which potters shared pottery making practices, and perhaps social identities. Communities of practice thus provides a useful framework for understanding how social identities are expressed through technological and stylistic practices...|$|R
