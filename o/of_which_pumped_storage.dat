50|$|The {{main source}} of Australia's {{electricity}} generation is coal. In 2003, coal-fired power plants generated 77.2% of the country's total electricity production, followed by natural gas (13.8%), hydropower (7.0%), oil (1.0%), biomass (0.6%) and solar and wind combined (0.3%). in 2008-09, a total of 261 terawatt hours of electricity (including off-grid electricity) was generated in Australia. Coal-fired plants also constitute a majority <b>of</b> generating capacity <b>which</b> in 2008-9 was 29,407 MW. The total generating capacity from all sources in 2008-9 was approximately 51 GW with an average capacity utilisation of 52 per cent. In 2008-9 a total of 143.2 TWh of electricity was produced from black coal and 56.9 TWh from brown coal. Over the 10 years from 1998-99 to 2008-09, Australia's electricity use increased at an average rate of 2.5 per cent a year Since 2009 Australia's energy usage has decreased by 4.3% Depending {{on the price of}} coal at the power station, the long run marginal cost of coal based electricity at the power stations in eastern Australia is between 7 and 8 cents per kWh, which is around $79 per MWh. In 2003, coal-fired plants produced 58.4% of the total capacity, followed by hydropower (19.1%, <b>of</b> <b>which</b> 17% is <b>pumped</b> <b>storage),</b> natural gas (13.5%), liquid/gas fossil fuel-switching plants (5.4%), oil products (2.9%), wind power (0.4%), biomass (0.2%) and solar (0.1%).|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel micropump <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>pumping</b> mechanism {{is based upon}} magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) principles. MHD {{is the study of}} flow of electrically conducting liquids in electric and magnetic fields. Lorentz force is the pumping source of conductive, aqueous solutions in the MHD micropump. Conducting fluid in the microchannel of the MHD micropump is driven by Lorentz force in the direction perpendicular to both magnetic and electric fields. The performance of the micropump is obtained by measuring the pressure head difference and flow rate as the applied voltage changes from 10 to 60 VDC at 0. 19 and 0. 44 Tesla (T). The pressure head difference is 18 mm at 38 mA and the flow rate is 63 μl/min at 1. 8 mA when the inside diameter of inlet/outlet tube is 2 mm and the magnetic flux density is 0. 44 T. Bubble generation by the electrolysis of the conducting liquid can be observed. The performance of the MHD micropump obtained theoretically in single phase is compared with the experimental results. close 19621...|$|R
