40|$|To {{investigate}} the in vivo effects of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and perioperative hemodilution on human skeletal muscle <b>oxygen</b> <b>delivery</b> and metabolism {{and to determine}} the dilution state at which these effects arise. We conducted this observational study in adult patients undergoing CPB surgery. Microcirculatory data were obtained by near-infrared spectroscopy from the brachioradial muscle in 20 consecutive patients undergoing hemodilution for CPB. Outcome variables included tissue oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin concentration ([HbO(2) ], [HHb]), oxygen content, blood flow, <b>oxygen</b> <b>delivery,</b> and <b>oxygen</b> consumption. Although CPB left tissue blood flow and <b>oxygen</b> <b>delivery</b> unchanged, both microcirculatory variables correlated significantly and inversely with hematocrit (Hct) (r = - 0. 39, p < 0. 001; r = - 0. 50, p < 0. 001). CPB also left muscle oxygen consumption (mVO(2)) unchanged and this variable correlated with the tissue hemoglobin concentration and tissue <b>oxygen</b> <b>delivery</b> (r = 0. 40, p = 0. 001; r = 0. 35, p = 0. 005).

40|$|Objective: {{oxygen supply}} {{dependency}} at normal or high <b>oxygen</b> <b>delivery</b> rate has been increasingly proposed as a hallmark and {{a risk factor}} in critical illnesses. We hypothesized that as fas as an adequate <b>oxygen</b> <b>delivery</b> is provided, <b>oxygen</b> consumption, when determined by indirect calorimetry, is not dependent on <b>oxygen</b> <b>delivery</b> in critically ill patients whereas calculated oxygen consumption is associated with artefactual correlation of <b>oxygen</b> consumption and <b>delivery.</b> Design: <b>oxygen</b> <b>delivery,</b> <b>oxygen</b> consumption and their relationship were analyzed prospectively. Metabolic data gained from both measured and calculated methods were obtained simultaneously before and after volume loading. Setting: the study was completed {{in the intensive care}} unit as part of the management protocol of the patients. Patients: 32 consecutive patients entered the study and were divided into 3 groups according to a clinical condition known to favour oxygen supply dependency: sepsis syndrome, adult respiratory distress syndrome and acute primary liver failure. Intervention: the rise in <b>oxygen</b> <b>delivery</b> was obtained by colloid infusion (oxygen flux test) performed in hemodynamically and metabolically stable patients. All were mechanically ventilated. No change in therapy was allowed during the test. Measurements and results: oxygen consumption was simultaneously evaluated by calculation (Fick Principle) and direct measurement using indirect calorimetry. <b>Oxygen</b> <b>delivery</b> was derived from the cardiac output (thermodilution) and arterial content of oxygen. Oxygen supply dependency was considered while observing an increase in <b>oxygen</b> <b>delivery</b> greater than 45 ml/min. m(2).

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the minimal <b>oxygen</b> <b>delivery</b> and pump flow that can maintain systemic oxygen uptake during normothermic (37 degrees C) pulsatile and non-pulsatile cardiopulmonary bypass in dogs. METHODS: Eighteen anaesthetized dogs {{were randomly assigned}} to receive either non-pulsatile (Group C; n = 9) or pulsatile bypass flow (Group P; n = 9). <b>Oxygen</b> <b>delivery</b> was reduced by a progressive decrease in pump flow, while arterial oxygen content was maintained constant. In each animal, critical <b>oxygen</b> <b>delivery</b> was determined from plots of oxygen uptake vs. <b>oxygen</b> <b>delivery</b> and from plots of blood lactate vs. <b>oxygen</b> <b>delivery</b> using a least sum of squares technique. Critical pump flow was determined from plots of lactate vs. pump flow. RESULTS: At the critical point, <b>oxygen</b> <b>delivery</b> obtained from <b>oxygen</b> uptake was 7. 7 +/- 1. 1 mL min(- 1) kg(- 1) in Group C and 6. 8 +/- 1. 8 mL min(- 1) kg(- 1) in Group P (n. s.). These values were similar to those obtained from lactate measurements (Group C: 7. 8 +/- 1. 6 mL min(- 1) kg(- 1); Group P: 7. 6 +/- 2. 0 mL min(- 1) kg(- 1)).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is associated with reduced <b>oxygen</b> <b>delivery</b> to muscles. Patients with CFS according to CDC (Center for Disease Control) criteria (nfl 20) were compared with normal sedentary subjects (nfl 12). Muscle <b>oxygen</b> <b>delivery</b> was measured as the rate of post-exercise and post-ischaemia oxygen-haem resaturation. Oxygen-haem resaturation was measured in the medial gastrocnemius muscle using continuous-wavelength near-IR spectroscopy. Phosphocreatine resynthesis was measured simultaneously using 31 P magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The time constant of <b>oxygen</b> <b>delivery</b> was significantly reduced in CFS patients after exercise (46. 5 ‡ 16 s; mean‡S. D.) compared with that in controls (29. 4 ‡ 6. 9 s). The time constant of <b>oxygen</b> <b>delivery</b> was also reduced (20. 0 ‡ 12 s) compared with controls (12. 0 ‡ 2. 8 s) after cuff ischaemia. Oxidative metabolism was also reduced by 20 % in CFS patients, and a significant correlation was found between oxidative metabolism and recovery of <b>oxygen</b> <b>delivery.</b> In conclusion, <b>oxygen</b> <b>delivery</b> was reduced in CFS patients compared with that in sedentary controls. This result is consistent with previous studies showing abnormal autonomic control of blood flow. Reduced oxidative delivery in CFS patients could be specifically related to CFS, or could be a non-specific effect of reduced activity levels in these patients.

Results: As the compression to ventilation ratio was increased from zero to 50 or more, both <b>oxygen</b> <b>delivery</b> and the combination of <b>oxygen</b> <b>delivery</b> with blood flow increased to maximum values and then gradually declined.

Hypercholesterolemic (HC) New Zealand white rabbits developed {{mild to moderate}} coronary vascular disease in 4 months when serum cholesterol levels were maintained at 1500 [...] 2000 mg/dl. Resting left ventricular levels of creatine phosphate, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and the cellular energy charge were unaltered after 2 months of diet but were decreased after 4 and 6 months. Tissue lactate and the lactate/pyruvate ratio were increased after 4 months, suggesting mild tissue ischemia. The regional blood flow rate was measured in rabbits given pentobarbital after 6 months of diet using labeled microspheres, and the response to stress was tested after 5 minutes of hypoxic ventilation (5 % O 2 /N 2). The percentage of cardiac output to subendocardium (endo) and subepicardium (epi) in HC rabbits and that in control animals were similar at rest, but unlike that of control animals, the endo perfusion did not increase significantly in HC animals during hypoxic stress. Baseline regional left ventricular <b>oxygen</b> <b>deliveries</b> were similar between groups, but the baseline endo/epi <b>oxygen</b> <b>delivery</b> ratio was reduced in HC rabbits.

Investigation and testing the feasibility of using an automated system for <b>oxygen</b> <b>delivery</b> was reported in Behbahani and Ali (2012), Lellouche and LHer (2012), Cirio and Nava (2011). These studies were based on using a commercial Pulse Oximeter and a developed automated computerized system that adjusts the oxygen flow based on a Pulse-Oximetry signal. In this work, we designed the Oxygen Reader Subsystem instead of using a commercial one for the following reasons: (1) To have control over processing the raw data with the aim to develop more robust algorithms that can provide higher reading accuracy for patients oxygen saturation and heart rate, even with patients movements and other external artifacts. (2) To customize our Oxygen Reader Subsystem to a wearable earlobe Pulse Oximeter with higher level of comfort and ease of use.

At a critical level of <b>oxygen</b> <b>delivery,</b> <b>oxygen</b> consumption becomes limited by <b>oxygen</b> <b>delivery,</b> and this coincides with {{a sharp increase in}} lactate levels.

This has been confirmed in an experimental study of cardiac tamponade by Zhang et al.

The technique is applied to a mouse model of porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE) induced lung emphysema in order to investigate how structural changes affect lung function. Nine-week-old female C 57 BL 6 mice were instilled with saline or PPE at days 0 and 7. At day 19, <b>oxygen</b> <b>delivery,</b> <b>oxygen</b> uptake, and lung density were quantified from T 1 and proton-density measurements obtained via oxygen-enhanced {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (OE-MRI) using an ultrashort echo-time imaging sequence. Subsequently, the lungs were sectioned for histological observation. Blood-gas analyses and pulmonary functional tests via FlexiVent were performed in separate cohorts. PPE-challenged mice had reduced density when assessed via MRI, consistent with the parenchyma loss observed in the histology sections, and an increased lung compliance was detected via FlexiVent. The oxygenation levels, as assessed via the blood-gas analysis, showed no difference between PPE-challenged animals and control. This finding was mirrored in the global MRI assessments of <b>oxygen</b> <b>delivery</b> and uptake, where the changes in relaxation time indices were matched between the groups. The heterogeneity of the same parameters however, were increased in PPE-challenged animals. When the oxygenation status was investigated in regions of varying density, a reduced oxygen-uptake was found in low-density regions of PPE-challenged mice. In high-density regions the uptake was {{higher than that of}} regions of corresponding density in control animals. The <b>oxygen</b> <b>delivery</b> was proportional to the oxygen uptake in both groups. The proposed method allowed for the regional assessment of the relationship between lung density and two aspects of lung function, the <b>oxygen</b> <b>delivery</b> and uptake. When compared to global indices of lung function, an increased sensitivity for detecting heterogeneous lung disorders was found. This indicated that the technique has potential for early detection of lung dysfunction-before global changes occur...|$|R

40|$|Background-Combining {{bilateral}} {{pulmonary artery}} banding with arterial duct stenting, the hybrid approach achieves stage 1 palliation for hypoplastic left heart syndrome with different flow characteristics than those after the surgical Norwood procedures. Accordingly, we used computational modeling to assess {{some of these}} differences, including influence on systemic and cerebral <b>oxygen</b> <b>deliveries.</b> Methods and Results-A 3 -dimensional computational model of hybrid palliation {{was developed by the}} finite volume method, along with models of the Norwood operation with a modified Blalock-Tausig or right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery shunt. Hybrid circulation was modeled with a 7 -mm ductal stent and bilateral pulmonary artery banding to a 2 -mm diameter. A 3. 5 -mm conduit was used in the Blalock-Tausig shunt model, whereas a 5 -mm conduit was used in the right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery shunt model. Coupled to all the models was an identical hydraulic network that described the entire circulatory system based on pre-stage 2 hemodynamics. This clinically validated multiscale approach predicts flow dynamics, as well as global cardiac output, mixed venous oxygen saturation, and systemic and cerebral <b>oxygen</b> <b>delivery.</b> Compared with either of the Norwood models, the hybrid palliation had higher pulmonary-to-systemic flow ratio and lower cardiac output. Total systemic <b>oxygen</b> <b>delivery</b> was markedly reduced in the hybrid palliation (Blalock-Tausig shunt 591, right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery shunt 640, and hybrid 475 mL. min(- 1). m(- 2)). Cerebral <b>oxygen</b> <b>delivery</b> was similarly lower in the hybrid palliation. Conclusions-These computational results suggest that the hybrid approach may provide inferior systemic and cerebral <b>oxygen</b> <b>deliveries</b> compared with either of the 2 surgical Norwood procedures before stage 2 palliation...|$|R
40|$|Perinatal {{inflammation}} {{is associated}} with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes, which may be partly due {{to changes in the}} cerebral oxygen delivery/consumption relationship. We aimed to determine the critical <b>oxygen</b> <b>delivery</b> threshold of the brain of preterm, ventilated lambs and to determine whether the critical threshold is affected by exposure to inflammation in utero. Pregnant ewes received intra-amniotic injection of lipopolysaccharide or saline at 125 or 127 days of gestation. Pulmonary and systemic flow probes and catheters were surgically positioned in the fetus immediately before delivery at 129 days of gestation. After delivery, lambs were ventilated for 90 min using a positive end-expiratory pressure recruitment strategy. Cardio-respiratory variables and blood gases were measured regularly. Systemic and cerebral <b>oxygen</b> <b>delivery,</b> consumption (Fick), and extraction were calculated, and the relationship between cerebral delivery and consumption analyzed. Linear regression was used to define the transition or "critical" oxygen threshold as {{the point at which the}} slope of the oxygen delivery/consumption curve changed to be > 10 °. Four subgroups were defined according to the calculated critical threshold. A total of 150 measurements were recorded in 18 lambs. Fetal cerebral oxygen consumption was increased by antenatal lipopolysaccharide (P < 0. 05). The postnatal critical oxygen threshold was 3. 6 ml·kg⁻¹·min⁻¹, corresponding to cerebral oxygen consumption of 0. 73 ml·kg⁻¹·min⁻¹. High <b>oxygen</b> <b>delivery</b> and consumption were associated with increased pulmonary and carotid blood flow and systemic extraction compared with low <b>oxygen</b> <b>delivery</b> and consumption. No postnatal effect of antenatal inflammation was observed. Inflammation in utero increases fetal, but not postnatal, cerebral oxygen consumption. Adverse alterations to pulmonary blood flow can result in reduced cerebral blood flow, <b>oxygen</b> <b>delivery,</b> and consumption. Regardless of exposure to inflammation, there is a consistent postnatal relationship between cerebral <b>oxygen</b> <b>delivery</b> and consumption. C. C. Andersen, J. J. Pillow, A. W. Gill, B. J.
