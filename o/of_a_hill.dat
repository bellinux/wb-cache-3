5|$|European pioneer {{farmers in}} the prairies of North America, {{where there is no}} wood for construction, often made their first home in a dug-out cave in the side <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>hill</b> or ravine, with a {{covering}} over the entrance. When they had time, they would build a sod house. The farmer would use a plow to cut the sod into bricks , which were then piled up to form the walls.|$|E
5|$|On lap 22, Zorzi {{pulled off}} to {{the left side of the}} main straight, just after the brow <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>hill</b> and a bridge over the track. He was having {{problems}} with his fuel metering unit, and fuel was pumping directly onto the engine, which then caught fire. Zorzi did not immediately get out of his car as he could not disconnect the oxygen pipe from his helmet.|$|E

5|$|The British {{attacked}} {{the position of}} the 3rd Continentals, and an engagement ensued. Both sides kept up constant fire, the Americans breaking the British lines several times. However, after 17 volleys, the British numbers began to overwhelm the Americans, and Glover ordered a withdrawal to another stone wall on the crest <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>hill</b> while the next regiment in line, the 26th Continentals, engaged the British.|$|E
5|$|The {{effort to}} {{construct}} a hill passenger railway system throughout the mountainous regions of India commenced in 1878 with the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway project. Franklin Prestage of the Eastern Bengal Railway initiated plans for the building <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>hill</b> tramway parallel to the hill cart road between Siliguri and Darjeeling. By 1881, the line was completed up to Darjeeling.|$|E

5|$|Tigranes' {{army was}} {{positioned}} {{on the east}} {{bank of the river}} while Lucullus, who had left a rear guard to continue the siege of the city, met the Armenian army on the river's west bank. The Armenian army was formed of three sections. Two of Tigranes' vassal kings led the left and right flanks, while Tigranes led his cataphracts in the center. The rest of his army stood in front <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>hill,</b> a position Lucullus soon exploited.|$|E
5|$|After {{making a}} recovery, Kizirian and the Marine units took {{the capital city}} of NaHa and were {{preparing}} for another assault. Kizirian's unit had fought its way to the crest <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>hill</b> and dug in. Kizirian was standing watch at the company command post inside an Okinawa burial ground. When replacements joined the company, many Japanese soldiers harassed the lines by infiltrating the positions of the more inexperienced soldiers. Kizirian ordered that flares should be fired at irregular intervals to would illuminate the scene and distract the enemy. The idea proved successful and the newly arrived Marines soon had the situation under control.|$|E
5|$|During the American Revolution, {{the road}} was an {{important}} artery over which the British and the colonists fought. In January 1777, the colonists brought a cannon to the top <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>hill</b> and fired at the British. The hill, now inside Woodlawn Cemetery, was locally called Gun Hill afterwards. The road was known as Kingsbridge Road (part of the original Boston Post Road) until 1875, when it was renamed Gun Hill Road. It did not originally extend east of White Plains Road but was extended by segments to the Hutchinson River, by 1938.|$|E

5|$|Heavy {{rainfall}} {{from the}} typhoon breached a flood-retaining wall at Camp Fuji, a training facility for the United States Marine Corps near Yokosuka. Marines inside the camp weathered the storm inside huts {{situated at the}} base <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>hill</b> which housed a fuel farm. The breach led to hoses being dislodged from two rubber storage bladders, releasing large quantities of fuel. The fuel flowed {{down the hill and}} was ignited by a heater used to warm one of the huts. The resultant fire killed 13 Marines, injured 68, and caused moderate damage to the facility. The facility's barracks were destroyed, along with fifteen huts and several other structures. The barracks were rebuilt, and a memorial was established for those who lost their lives in the fire.|$|E
5|$|In his book, German Architecture in China, Warner Torsten {{writes of}} the cathedral: According to residents] the cathedral {{is far too}} large for the scale of Qingdao. Its {{position}} on top <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>hill</b> makes this even more evident. Perhaps {{the idea was to}} produce a powerful building to hold its own with the Protestant Church, which for 20 years had been the largest religious building in Qingdao, or perhaps the intention was to outstrip the 46metre-high towers of the Franciscan church in Jinan. The towers of the cathedral in Qingdao were higher than all the other churches in the major cities of Northern China– Tianjin, Beijing, Dalian, or Jinan. They dominate the silhouette of Qingdao; they are particularly impressive from a ship entering the harbour.|$|E
5|$|On 3 February the Allied army {{encountered}} the main Argentine force commanded by Rosas himself. On paper, {{the two sides}} were well-matched. The Allies included 20,000 Argentines, 2,000 Uruguayans, 4,000 Brazilian elite troops totalling 26,000 men and 45 cannon (16,000 cavalrymen, 9,000 infantrymen and 1,000 artillerymen). On the Argentine side, Rosas had 15,000 cavalrymen, 10,000 infantrymen and 1,000 artillerymen, totalling 26,000 men and 60 cannon. Rosas {{had been able to}} select the best positions for his army, choosing the high ground on the slopes <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>hill</b> at Caseros, which lay {{on the other side of}} the Morón creek. His headquarters were in a mansion at the top of Caseros.|$|E

5|$|Skanderbeg {{expected}} a reaction so {{he moved with}} 15,000 of his own men to defeat Ali Pasha's army. The two met in the Plain of Torvioll where they camped opposite of each other. The following day, 29 June, Ali {{came out of his}} camp and saw that Skanderbeg had positioned his forces at the bottom <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>hill.</b> Expecting a quick victory, Ali ordered all of his forces down the hill to attack and defeat Skanderbeg's army. Skanderbeg expected such a maneuver and had prepared his own stratagem. Once the opposing forces were engaged and the necessary positioning was achieved, Skanderbeg ordered his forces hidden in the forests behind the Turkish army to strike their rear. The result was devastating for the Ottomans, whose entire army was routed and its commander nearly killed.|$|E
5|$|The Federal Government {{required}} that all cemeteries and burial grounds be moved. This included the Harvey tomb, {{and it was}} no easy task. In 1962 contractor Harald Mathis of Springdale took nine days to raze the 40-ton tomb and one to move it. The first attempt broke a flatbed truck. Another contractor from Huntsville with a stronger truck then had to be called in. A new road was laid to the new site of Harvey's tomb. The tomb was placed on the crest <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>hill</b> donated by Harvey's longtime friends and neighbors Mr. and Mrs. Kenneth Doescher. Today, the tomb sits on private property visible from the Monte Ne boat launch on Beaver Lake. Relocation of the aging tomb put pressure on it, causing it to crack.|$|E
5|$|The {{flanking}} party {{consisted of}} Knowlton's Rangers, {{which had been}} reinforced by three companies of riflemen, in total about 200 men. As they approached, an officer accidentally misdirected the men, and the firing broke out on the British flank, not their rear. The British troops, realizing that they had almost been surrounded, retreated to a field, {{where there was a}} fence. The Americans soon pursued and, during the attack, Knowlton was killed. Despite this, the American troops pushed on; driving the British troops beyond the fence to the top <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>hill.</b> When they reached the hill, the British forces received reinforcements; including some artillery. For two hours, the British troops held their ground {{at the top of the}} hill until the Americans once again forced them to retreat, into a buckwheat field where Barnard College now stands.|$|E

5|$|The name Crewkerne {{is thought}} to be derived from Cruc-aera; from the British cruc - a spur <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>hill,</b> and the Old English aera - a house, {{especially}} a storehouse. The town was known as Crocern, or Cruaern in the 899 will of Alfred the Great when he left it to his younger son Æthelweard, and by 1066 the manor was held by Edith Swanneck mistress of King Harold. After the Norman conquest it was held by William the Conqueror and the church estate was given to the Abbaye-aux-Hommes in Caen, Normandy. In the Domesday Survey of 1086 it was described as a royal manor.|$|E
5|$|The son of Leslie Keith Davidson and Hilda Aileen Clifton, Davidson {{grew up in}} Lisarow, New South Wales (NSW) {{near the}} city of Gosford on the NSW Central Coast.

By the age of nine, he was playing in the second {{division}} of the Gosford grade competition. Throughout his high school years, he represented Northern High Schools in the state combined public schools' competition where he played against his future Test captain Richie Benaud, who captained City High Schools. During his teenage years, Davidson kept fit by working on the family property, chopping wood and carrying farm produce.|$|E
5|$|A {{possible}} {{legend of}} Prince Vladimir was recorded by Branislav Nušić in the 19th {{century in the}} city of Korçë, southeastern Albania, close to Macedonia. Ruins on top <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>hill</b> above Korçë were said to be remains of the court of a Latin (Catholic) king, whose kingdom neighbored the state of an Orthodox emperor. The king asked the hand of the emperor's daughter, who agreed to become his wife only if he built an Orthodox church. He did so, and she married him, but on the first night of marriage she killed him. She then became a nun, and the king's body was taken somewhere—he was not buried near his court. Macedonian Slavs inhabiting Saint Achillius Island in the Small Prespa Lake in Greece told of an emperor named Mirče. He lived on their island, where he was killed by a cousin of his out of jealousy, and his body was taken via Ohrid to Albania.|$|E
