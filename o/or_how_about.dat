5000|$|The {{book was}} also criticized by Sheri Berman, who argues that Robin mischaracterizes right-wing {{populism}}, arguing that [...] "Taking right-wing populism seriously means accepting {{that those who}} support it believe what they say and have agency, rather than viewing them as being used or manipulated {{in the service of}} the elites. Robin clearly does not believe these things. He tries to explain his views of populism using a variety of odd and even nonsensical terms. For example, he says one way to understand populism is as 'democratic feudalism', which means [...] "giving real, not imaginary, power to the members of the lower orders to wield over people beneath them" [...] (emphasis added). Well, who then is 'giving' power to the lower orders? And why are they doing so if not {{in the service of the}}ir (the givers or elites) goals? <b>Or</b> <b>how</b> <b>about</b> 'upside-down populism', which means [...] "getting the lower orders to identify with the higher orders" [...] (emphasis added). Again, the use of the passive tense is instructive: as we all know, it is used in order to avoid identifying the real protagonist of a particular action." [...] Berman also argued that [...] "Robin repeatedly characterizes conservative leaders and thinkers as manipulative, repressive, [...] "enlivened" [...] by violence, and committed to the oppression of the [...] "subordinate classes" [...] or [...] "lower orders". He dismisses conservatives' own characterizations of their views and motives, arguing that to give credence to factors such as a commitment to limited government or individual freedom would be to be tricked into missing the [...] "more elemental force" [...] at work, which is [...] "the opposition to the liberation of men and women from the fetters of their superiors.".|$|E

5000|$|The posters {{were also}} covertly feminist, {{sometimes}} shockingly so, even to Bush, {{a child of}} the 70s. From the first ('Mona Freeman, wants to be a top notch freelance illustrator') to the last ('Heidi Hafner ... Her goal: a flight instructor's rating'), they focused on women's ambitions, and in the 1940s or the 70s or 2000s, that's a rare rose to find clamped in the teeth of mass advertising. Yet there it was, and there it more or less firmly remained, probably because the contest was structured during World War II, when more than three million women were offered paying work for the first time, and were thus riding the subways, not to mention operating them, in much greater numbers than before. The posters were at their most radical during the war years, and equally reflect women's later return to the home. Miss Subways' journey tracks a clear underground parallel to the prescribed roles of her sisters' above: While the civilian women of World War II may have been crucial to the work force, the purpose of housewives, as Betty Friedan puts it, 'is to buy more things for the house.'From the exhilarating peak of December 1942's Marguerite McAuliffe, 'whose aim is to be a doctor as good as her dad,' and November 1943's Cecile Woodley, whose 'main interests are her job and the Navy ... enthusiastically O.K.'s skiing, Mozart and Katharine Hepburn,' we slide submissively toward Irene Scheidt, June 1950, whose 'fondest hope is a trip to Bermuda.' Then up we go again to Eleanor Nash, November 1960, 'young, beautiful, and expert with a rifle.'... What I waited for each new month was: What did she do? What were her goals?

Adopting any one of these proposals would certainly have far-reaching effects on our future, but what about our past?

This is not (just) a book about how to treat your donors, or how to beat the drum of {{partnership}} so that others will march to your tempo. Nor does it stop at examining opportunities for funding from the public and corporate sectors. How about mobilising donations and legacies, in part through the Internet, and searching out the philanthropic funds in even the poorest country? <b>Or</b> <b>how</b> <b>about</b> a debt-swap which converts a government s debt in hard currency into local funds?

Discovered a nest of sparrows in your hanging flower basket? <b>Or</b> <b>how</b> <b>about</b> {{woke up one morning}} to discover deer have nibbled on your flower garden, reducing your blossoms to stems? If so, you're not alone. The paths of humans and wildlife cross all the time, and it is the aim of this handbook to make sure those paths cross as peacefully as possible. Andrea Dawn Lopez, a former manager at Wildlife Rescue and Rehabilitation, Inc., in San Antonio, Texas, has distilled her knowledge of dealing with wildlife in When Raccoons Fall through Your Ceiling. She tackles a wide variety of situations that occur when human and non-human worlds clash. Have you found a baby bird on your porch? Is a snake taking up residence in your garage? Or perhaps woodpeckers are drumming against your house? Lopez offers advice on how to deal humanely with each situation with tips on relocation, repelling, and when to call in the experts (for when the bears are rattling your trash cans). Wildlife rehabilitators and state wildlife officers across the world spend many hours answering questions on the phone, teaching in classrooms, and going to people's homes to try and show them about how to better co-habit with wild animals. When Raccoons Fall through Your Ceiling is a practical handbook to codify for the general public how to deal with wildlife-related problems and concerns. It will be of interest to wildlife rehabilitation centers, state wildlife agencies, veterinarians, and those fortunate enough to live in an area enhanced by wild birds, reptiles, and mammals...|$|E

40|$|Todays evil {{often comes}} in the form of ransomware, keyloggers, or spyware, against which AntiVirus {{applications}} are usually an end users only means of protection. But current security apps not only scan for malware, they also aid end users by detecting malicious URLs, scams or phishing attacks. Generally, security apps appear so self-evidently useful that institutions such as online-banking providers even require users to install anti-virus programs. In this talk, however, we show that the installation of security applications, at least in the context of smartphones, can sometimes open the phone to a number of attack vectors, making the system more instead of less vulnerable to attacks. In a recent research we conducted on Android security apps from renowned vendors such as Kaspersky, McAfee, Androhelm, Eset, Malwarebytes or Avira. When conducting a study of the apps security features (Antivirus and Privacy Protection, Device Protection, Secure Web Browsing, etc.) it came as a shock to us that every inspected application contained critical vulnerabilities, and that in the end no single of the promoted security features proved to be sufficiently secure. In a simple case, we would have been able to harm the app vendors business model by upgrading a trial version into a premium one at no charge. In other instances, attackers would be able to harm the end user by completely disabling the malware-scanning engine remotely. <b>Or</b> <b>how</b> <b>about</b> accessing confidential data by exploiting broken SSL communication, broken self-developed advanced crypto implementations or through SQL-injections? Yes, we can. On top, we were able to bypass the secure browsing protection and abuse it for code execution. The most alarming findings, however, were security applications that we were able to actually turn into a remote access trojan (RAT) or into ransomware. In light of all those findings, one must seriously question whether the advice to install a security app onto ones smartphone is a wise one. In this talk, we will not only explain our findings in detail but also propose possible security fixes...|$|E
40|$|The cinema, {{the movie}} theater, {{possesses}} {{a type of}} unique appeal, and a specific feeling it evokes in many people. There's just something about the cinema {{that is difficult to}} put into words. Is the appeal in the way it makes us feel? Is it about the spectacular content, the motion pictures? Or is it the big screen and the comfy seats? <b>Or</b> <b>how</b> <b>about</b> the people you get to spend time with there? Or is the secret just the pure entertainment the cinema offers? Nowadays, the cinema not only has to compete over people's interest in the content they offer, or in the technology and great spaces they have, it also has to compete over people's valuable time in the world of unlimited options for leisure and entertainment. Cinema {{has to be able to}} offer something extraordinary to make the experience count, to be able to maintain that 'certain feeling' there is about cinema. Thus, this study seeks to explore, identify, and describe the elements of consumers' cinema experience, and aims to find out what an ideal movie-going experience could be like based on consumers' subjective experiences. The study at hand extends the existing literature and research by approaching the practice of cinema-going from a wider perspective by shedding light on the overall practice of attending cinema - a process and series of events extending far outside the cinema auditorium walls, which has received surprisingly little attention in existing academic research. This study is qualitative and interpretive in nature, and uses a visual research method of autodriven photo-elicitation (PEI) for conducting the empirical part of the thesis, and for gathering data for further analysis and findings. In PEIs, researchers use photographs as interview stimuli. In autodriven PEIs, research participants take their own photographs which then will be used as interview stimuli. Data for this study was collected through five autodriven photo-elicitation research visits to cinema, and 10 individual in-depth interviews, which were based on the photographs taken by each participant during their cinema visits. Eight thematic categories emerged from the data based on photograph-based in-depth interviews, and were noticed to somewhat follow the categories of 7 Ps of service marketing (Bitner & Booms, 1981). They are as follows: 1. Product related elements 2. Price related elements 3. Place related elements 4. Promotion related elements 5. Process related elements 6. Physical evidence related elements 7. People related elements, and finally the eighth additional category 8. Person related elements of consumer cinema experience. The main findings, contributions, conclusions, and implications of this study are finally gathered in The Consumer Cinema Experience Framework. Managers in the film and cinema industry can benefit from the framework when planning, developing, and making decisions on cinema and film related matters. Thus, some competitive advantage can be gained, as cinema experience can be designed to meet the wants and needs of the experience hungry, quality conscious, and socially active audience...|$|E
