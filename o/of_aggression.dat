Violent communication was represented by the carnivorous Jackal as a symbol <b>of</b> <b>aggression</b> and especially dominance. The herbivorous Giraffe on the other hand, represented his NVC strategy. The Giraffe was chosen as symbol for NVC as its long neck is supposed to show the clear-sighted speaker, being aware of his fellow speakers' reactions; and because the Giraffe has a large heart, representing the compassionate side of NVC. In his courses he tended to use these animals {{in order to make}} the differences in communication clearer to the audience.|$|E

A second issue was the Columbia administration's failure to resign its institutional membership in the Pentagon's weapons research think-tank, the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA). Students barricaded themselves inside Low Library, Hamilton Hall, and several other university buildings during the protests, and New York City police were called onto the campus to arrest or forcibly remove the students.|$|E

40|$|Sibling {{aggression}} {{is a common}} form <b>of</b> intra-familial <b>aggression,</b> yet has been largely neglected by research. Using an inclusive measure <b>of</b> sibling <b>aggression,</b> this study investigated, firstly, prevalence <b>of</b> sibling <b>aggression</b> and associations with family and household characteristics, and secondly, the relationship between sibling aggression and peer bullying. Participants were 4, 237 adolescents from Wave 1 of Understanding Society. Four types <b>of</b> sibling <b>aggression</b> were measured: physical, verbal, stealing and teasing, and combined into composite measures of victimization and perpetration. Regression analysis identified associations with demographic characteristics, family and sibling composition, parent–child relationships and socioeconomic status and explored the link between sibling aggression and involvement in peer bullying. Using a broad definition, sibling aggression {{was found to be}} widespread, with 46 % of all participants being victimized and 36 % perpetrating aggression. Household and family characteristics, including a large family size, male siblings, and financial difficulties were associated with greater rates <b>of</b> sibling <b>aggression.</b> Parenting behavior showed the strongest relationship: harsh parenting increased the risk <b>of</b> sibling <b>aggression</b> while positive parenting protected against it. Sibling aggression was also homotypically related to involvement in peer bullying. Victimization by siblings significantly increased the odds of being a victim of peer bullying, and perpetrators <b>of</b> sibling <b>aggression</b> {{were more likely to be}} both peer bullies and bully-victims. Considering the adverse effects <b>of</b> sibling <b>aggression</b> on physical and mental health, the study provides pointers for efforts to reduce the risk <b>of</b> sibling <b>aggression.</b> Furthermore, the link with peer bullying suggests that school anti-bullying efforts should also take account of children's sibling relationships...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} the real and pretend aggression exhibited by 20 middle-class children in a full-day kindergarten. A qualitative analysis was used to discover the sequence of aggressive episodes and how children executed aggressive acts within the episodes. Boys displayed the majority of aggressive behaviors, but only a small group of boys consistently participated in both real and pretend <b>aggression.</b> In episodes <b>of</b> pretend <b>aggression,</b> the aggressor was most likely to shoot, threaten, hit, or blow up a person, object, or imaginary character. In contrast, the aggressor was most likely to grab, taunt, name-call, push, or throw in episodes <b>of</b> real <b>aggression.</b> In both types of aggressive episodes, the target frequently provided the aggressor with information, but the target was also likely to move away from the aggressor or leave the play area in episodes <b>of</b> real <b>aggression.</b> Teachers intervened in more episodes <b>of</b> real <b>aggression</b> than in episodes <b>of</b> pretend <b>aggression.</b> In both pretend and real aggression, teachers intervened by providing directions, asking questions, and stating rules. Finally, the children were more likely to stay together than separate after an episode <b>of</b> pretend <b>aggression,</b> but they were just as likely to separate as they were to stay together in episodes <b>of</b> real <b>aggression...</b>|$|R
40|$|Research {{has found}} that dating {{violence}} is a predictor of marital violence; however, research has been unclear about what predicts dating violence. Past research has been inconclusive. Furthermore, very few studies focus on gender differences in risk factors. This study examines a variety of risk factors {{for male and female}} perpetrators of dating violence in college dating relationships. Eight risk factors were used in this study: witnessing parental violence, experiencing childhood violence, problems with alcohol, length of relationship, relationship satisfaction, anger management skills, partner’s use <b>of</b> physical <b>aggression,</b> and partner’s use <b>of</b> psychological <b>aggression.</b> Correlations and multiple regressions were run for each gender. The study found that for males, partner’s use <b>of</b> physical <b>aggression,</b> low anger management skills and high relationship satisfaction were the strongest variables associated with male’s use <b>of</b> physical <b>aggression</b> against a dating partner. For the females, partner’s use <b>of</b> physical <b>aggression,</b> followed by partner’s use <b>of</b> psychological <b>aggression</b> were the most significant variables.

5|$|The trial got {{underway}} on 20 November 1945. Lacking evidence confirming Bormann's death, the International Military Tribunal tried him in absentia, as permitted {{under article}} 12 of their charter. He {{was charged with}} three counts: conspiracy to wage a war <b>of</b> <b>aggression,</b> war crimes, and crimes against humanity. His prosecution was assigned to Lieutenant Thomas F. Lambert Jr. and his defence to Dr. Friedrich Bergold. The prosecution stated that Bormann participated in planning and co-signed {{virtually all of the}} antisemitic legislation put forward by the regime. Bergold unsuccessfully proposed that the court could not convict Bormann because he was already dead. Due to the shadowy nature of Bormann's activities, Bergold was unable to refute the prosecution's assertions as to the extent of his involvement in decision making. Bormann was convicted of war crimes and crimes against humanity and acquitted of conspiracy to wage a war <b>of</b> <b>aggression.</b> On 15 October 1946 he was sentenced to death by hanging, with the provision that if he were later found alive, any new facts brought to light at that time could be taken into consideration to reduce the sentence or overturn it.|$|E

40|$|Some plumage {{patterns}} in birds, such as irregularities of feathers, are potential amplifi ers {{because they can}} reveal damage by conspecifi cs and therefore social status.

As predicted, manipulated birds were displaced by controls from safe feeders, and performed a lower number <b>of</b> <b>aggressions</b> and with lower success, although they did not receive more aggressions as expected from the fact that effi cient agonistic displays can avoid the occurrence <b>of</b> overt <b>aggressions.</b> Thus, our manipulation changed the social status of birds by converting individuals with manipulated cheeks into subordinates.

5|$|Alternate {{theories}} of self-defence, inspired by Ahimsa, build principles similar to {{theories of}} just war. Aikido, pioneered in Japan, illustrates one such principles of self-defence. Morihei Ueshiba, {{the founder of}} Aikido, described his inspiration as Ahimsa. According to this interpretation of Ahimsa in self-defence, one must not assume {{that the world is}} free <b>of</b> <b>aggression.</b> One must presume that some people will, out of ignorance, error or fear, attack other persons or intrude into their space, physically or verbally. The aim of self-defence, suggested Ueshiba, must be to neutralise the aggression of the attacker, and avoid the conflict. The best defence is one where the victim is protected, as well as the attacker is respected and not injured if possible. Under Ahimsa and Aikido, there are no enemies, and appropriate self-defence focuses on neutralising the immaturity, assumptions and aggressive strivings of the attacker.|$|E

Measures <b>of</b> relational <b>aggression</b> include the Young Adult Social Behavior Survey and the Relational <b>Aggression</b> Measure. Measures <b>of</b> body image include (a) The Body Esteem Scale, (b) Multidimensional Body-Self Relations Questionnaire-Appearance Scales, and (c) The Sociocultural Attitudes Toward Appearance Scale- 3. Measures of other possible predictors <b>of</b> relational <b>aggression</b> include Appearance-based Rejection Sensitivity (social anxiety), Rosenburg Self-esteem Scale (general self-esteem), Body Mass Index, and The Crowne-Marlow Social Desirability Scale (social desirability bias).
