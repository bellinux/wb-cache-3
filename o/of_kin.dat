5|$|The group {{petitioned the}} United States Department of Veterans Affairs for a marker for Kealoha but the Department denied the request {{because there was}} no next <b>of</b> <b>kin</b> to approve the request. A 2009 policy change enacted in 2012 {{required}} that only next <b>of</b> <b>kin</b> could request VA memorials. After the request's denial, Honor Life Memorials, a local monument maker, donated a granite marker for Kealoha.|$|E
5|$|Experiments {{confirming}} the role <b>of</b> <b>kin</b> selection in worker policing demonstrate {{the effects of}} multiple matings, {{which can lead to}} lower average relatedness between workers. Queens of the social wasp Dolichovespula saxonica mate singly or multiply. Researchers who study these wasps have observed a strong positive correlation between worker relatedness and male production. After controlling for the absolute number of eggs laid, these scientists conclude that the queen's multiple matings favor mutual worker policing.|$|E
30|$|We {{study the}} pattern of genetic relatednesses within the {{available}} generations of the extended families by constructing the network <b>of</b> <b>kins</b> as described in Methods (Section  3). The fact that birth cohorts of the individuals in the network <b>of</b> <b>kins</b> are restricted so that around 80 % of the links appear {{in the span of}} last 20 years and 50 % within the last 10  years of the period of investigation, allows us to call this a network <b>of</b> horizontal <b>kin</b> ties (see Additional file 4).|$|R

5|$|In February 1995, SINTEF {{handed over}} a report {{ordered by the}} {{commission}} which revealed several absent safety procedures in Widerøe. The report {{was based on a}} recommendation by the International Civil Aviation Organization to take into consideration the organizational structure the aircraft operate within when investigating aviation accidents. In June, parliamentarian Magnus Stangeland criticized the commission for working too slow, stating that the victims and next <b>of</b> <b>kin</b> needed answers to why the accident happened. The lack of cooperation between the police and the commission was the main source of the delays. Similar delays had occurred after Partnair Flight 394 in 1989, which had resulted in the statute of limitations having come into effect by the time the report was published. A temporary report was presented to the survivors and next <b>of</b> <b>kin</b> on 20 March 1996; the report laid the responsibility for the accident on the airline. The final report was published on 10 July 1996 and laid the responsibility for the accident on the company and its operating routines. The report contained 26 recommendations for improvements for the company. The Norwegian Prosecuting Authority decided in September 1997 not to charge Widerøe for the accident.|$|E

5|$|Such {{cooperation}} within {{species may}} have evolved {{through the process}} <b>of</b> <b>kin</b> selection, which is where one organism acts to help raise a relative's offspring. This activity is selected for because if the helping individual contains alleles which promote the helping activity, {{it is likely that}} its kin will also contain these alleles and thus those alleles will be passed on. Other processes that may promote cooperation include group selection, where cooperation provides benefits to a group of organisms.|$|E

5|$|The {{measures}} of taxation in {{the reign of}} Augustus were determined by population census, with fixed quotas for each province. Citizens of Rome and Italy paid indirect taxes, while direct taxes were exacted from the provinces. Indirect taxes included a 4% tax {{on the price of}} slaves, a 1% tax on goods sold at auction, and a 5% tax on the inheritance of estates valued at over 100,000 sesterces by persons other than the next <b>of</b> <b>kin.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Royal Warrant, {{was silent}} {{on whether the}} VC could be awarded posthumously. From 1857 until 1897, 18 recipients were gazetted after their deaths but only 12 of the next <b>of</b> <b>kin</b> received the actual medal. In the other six cases there was a memorandum stating {{that they would have}} been recommended for the VC had they survived. By 1899, the precedent had been established that the VC could be awarded posthumously if the recommendation for the award was submitted prior to the recipient’s death from wounds. Two such awards were granted during the Second Boer War, the well known award to Frederick Roberts, the son of Lord Roberts VC and to Francis Parsons. In 1900 and 1901, three memoranda were issued for Herman Albrecht, Robert Digby-Jones and David Younger stating they would have been recommended for the VC had they survived. In a partial reversal of policy restricted to the Second Boer War, it was announced in the London Gazette on 8 August 1902, that the next <b>of</b> <b>kin</b> of the three soldiers mentioned in memoranda would be sent medals. In the same gazette, the first three posthumous awards were gazetted to Alfred Atkinson, John Barry and Gustavus Coulson. In 1907, the posthumous policy was reversed and medals were sent to the next <b>of</b> <b>kin</b> of the remaining six officers and men. Although the Victoria Cross warrant was not amended to specifically include posthumous awards until 1920, one quarter of all awards for the First World War were posthumous.|$|E

5|$|Until 1907, it was policy not {{to award}} the VC posthumously. Between 1857 and 1901, nine notices were {{published}} in the London Gazette for soldiers who would have been awarded the VC had they survived. In a partial reversal of policy in 1902, medals were sent to the next <b>of</b> <b>kin</b> of the three mentioned for the Boer War {{and at the same time}} the first three official posthumous awards, again for the Boer War, were gazetted. In 1907, the posthumous policy was completely reversed and medals were sent to the next <b>of</b> <b>kin</b> of the remaining six officers and men. As a result of the change of policy, one quarter of all awards for the First World War were posthumous but it was only in the general revision of the warrant issued in 1920 that a clause was inserted to explicitly allow posthumous awards.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{a bronze}} {{memorial}} plaque, inscribed {{with the name}} of the deceased alongside Britannia and a lion, and a scroll, sent to the next <b>of</b> <b>kin</b> of those had died {{in the service of the}} British Empire. Honour rolls in Canada were very popular, particularly immediately after the end of the war, although the decision on which names to include on them proved contentious: should accidental deaths, for example, be included? Where it was impractical to inscribe names in churches, usually due to the number of casualties and available space, books of names were often recorded instead.|$|E
5|$|IWGC war cemeteries {{featured}} {{grass and}} flowers within a walled area, intended to resemble an English garden; almost all were constructed around a War Stone and a Cross of Sacrifice, described {{in more detail}} below. The style varied slightly by architect and location, but typically the cemeteries followed classical influences in buildings and monuments, sometimes adapted slightly to appeal to the style of a particular Dominion. The buildings at the cemeteries were important symbolically and formed a key part of these designs. The graves proved controversial: initially they were marked by wooden crosses but, after some argument, it was agreed to replace these with Portland stone markers; the original wooden memorials were in some cases returned to the soldier's next <b>of</b> <b>kin.</b> Each marker was identical in shape and individualised only through the inscription of the name, regiment, date of death, a religious symbol and a short text agreed by the next <b>of</b> <b>kin.</b> Public debate ensued about these graves throughout the 1920s. British officials were concerned about families erecting their own memorials on the sites and detracting from the appearance of the cemeteries; critics complained about the secular nature of the memorials, the limited options for families to individualise the graves and the excessive role of the IWGC in determining how the soldiers were buried.|$|E

5|$|The press had an {{aggressive}} {{coverage of the}} accident. Several major press organizations attended the memorial service, and newspapers published close-up pictures of crying next <b>of</b> <b>kin</b> on their front pages. The Norwegian Press Complaints Commission, a committee appointed by the newspapers themselves, acquitted Dagbladet after a complaint for their aggressive image use. However, the accident coverage started an internal debate among journalists about their coverage of major accidents. The conclusion was that private sorrow {{was not to be}} covered in the media and since the media has had a strict self-enforcement of such a policy.|$|E
5|$|A land tax, {{aimed at}} {{breaking}} up big estates and give wider scope for small-scale farming, was also introduced, while {{coverage of the}} Arbitration system was extended to agricultural workers, domestics, and federal public servants. In addition, {{the age at which}} women became entitled to the old-age pension was lowered from sixty-five to sixty. The introduction of the maternity allowance was a major reform, because it enabled more births to be attended by doctors, thus leading to reductions in infant mortality rates. Compulsory preference to trade unionists in federal employment was also introduced, while the Seaman's Compensation Act of 1911 and the Navigation Act of 1912 were enacted to improve conditions for those working at sea, together with compensatory arrangements for seamen and next <b>of</b> <b>kin.</b> Eligibility for pensions was also widened. From December 1912 onwards, naturalised residents no longer had to wait three years to be eligible for a pension. That same year, the value of a pensioner's home was excluded from consideration when assessing the value of their property.|$|E
5|$|AFIS {{made several}} {{attempts}} {{to call up}} the aircraft. It {{received a call from}} a resident close to Torghatten which said they had heard aircraft noise followed by a crash. Brønnøysund Fire Department and an ambulance helicopter with a doctor was dispatched to Torghatten. The rescue work was made difficult by low clouds, small fires and explosions. The terrain was difficult and the lack of daylight made assisting the situation difficult. A helicopter with medical personnel and the airport direct arrived at 21:25, while a meeting place for the next <b>of</b> <b>kin</b> was established at the airport. At 23:30 the police stated that there was no hope of finding survivors and the scene changed from a search to an investigation scene.

30|$|We {{construct}} the network <b>of</b> <b>kins</b> or the kin {{network in the}} following way. A node in the network <b>of</b> <b>kins</b> represents a firstborn offspring resulting from a parental union belonging to the network of families. Thus, a node in the network of families having links to two different families results {{into a pair of}} nodes in the network <b>of</b> <b>kins</b> that are linked via kinship. For example, in a case when two sisters from a given family marrying into two different families, the two firstborns become linked as first cousins (see Additional file 1). Assuming that all families are distinct in terms of the genetic material that is inherited by its members, we only include those kinship relations where the sets of families of the two individuals do not completely overlap. Thus, kinships such as the parent-offspring relationship are excluded from this study. A more general description <b>of</b> a <b>kin</b> network would require the inclusion of all the types of kinship [25]. To characterize the kin network we use the information on the assumed genetic relatedness or coefficient of relationship (r) that is attributed to each type of kinship. The coefficient of relationship is defined as the probability that two individuals share an allele due to having descended from a common ancestor, such that r= 100 % for identical twins, and r= 0 for unrelated individuals [26, 27]. With our approach and the limits on the number of available generations, the types of kinship entering the study are, half-siblings (r= 25 %), first-cousins (r= 12.5 %), half-aunt/uncle-nephew/niece (r= 12.5 %), first-cousins-once-removed (r= 6.25 %), half-first-cousins (r= 6.25 %), second-cousins (r= 3.125 %), and half-second-cousins (r= 1.5625 %).|$|R
