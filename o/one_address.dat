25|$|Hans Grans was retried in January 1926. He {{was charged}} with aiding and abetting Haarmann in the murders of victims Adolf Hannappel and Fritz Wittig. Although Grans had stated in <b>one</b> <b>address</b> to the judge at his second trial that he {{expected}} to be acquitted, on 19 January, he {{was found guilty of}} aiding and abetting Haarmann in both cases and sentenced to two concurrent 12-year sentences. After serving his 12-year sentence, Hans Grans continued to live in Hanover until his death in 1975.|$|E
25|$|In the {{previous}} 52 years, only <b>one</b> <b>address</b> to the Oireachtas (parliament) had taken place, by Éamon de Valera in 1966, on the fiftieth {{anniversary of the}} Easter Rising. Robinson delivered two such Addresses. She was also invited to chair a committee to review {{the workings of the}} United Nations, but declined when asked to by the Irish government, who feared that her involvement might make it difficult for it to oppose the proposals that would result. Controversially, on one trip to Belfast she met with the local MP, Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn Féin.|$|E
25|$|All locally {{registered}} electors (British, Irish, Commonwealth and European Union citizens) {{who were}} aged 18 or over on Thursday 2 May 2013 {{were entitled to}} vote in the local elections. Those who were temporarily away from their ordinary address (for example, away working, on holiday, in student accommodation or in hospital) were also entitled {{to vote in the}} local elections, although those who had moved abroad and registered as overseas electors cannot vote in the local elections. It is possible to register to vote at more than <b>one</b> <b>address</b> (such as a university student who had a term-time address and lives at home during holidays) at the discretion of the local Electoral Register Office, but it remains an offence to vote more than once in the same local government election.|$|E

25|$|On {{the morning}} of 4 June, police made twelve arrests {{following}} raids in flats in the Barking area of east London, {{where one of the}} attackers lived; controlled explosions were carried out during the raids. Those held included five males aged between 27 and 55, arrested at <b>one</b> <b>address</b> in Barking, and six females aged between 19 and 60, arrested at a separate Barking address. One of the arrested males was subsequently released without charge. Four properties were being searched, including two in Newham in addition to the two in Barking. Further raids and arrests were made at properties in Newham and Barking early on {{the morning of}} 5 June. On 6 June, a man was arrested in Barking, and another in Ilford the following day. By 16 June, all those arrested had been released without charge.|$|E

60|$|The sermon was an {{hour and}} a quarter long.

But he was doubtless borne on by his zeal to do much in a good cause; and, as we have reason to think, by the attentive, though vague, curiosity of the Indians.|$|E
60|$|My dearest Fanny,--It {{seems to}} me that you have drunk so much England, which cheers and inebriates, as to have {{forgotten}} your Italian friends. Here have I been waiting with my load of gratitude, till my shoulders ache under it, not knowing to what address to carry it! Sarianna sent me <b>one</b> <b>address</b> of your London lodgings, with the satisfactory addition that you were about to move immediately. You really might have written to me before, unkindest and falsest of Fannies! Or else (understand) you should not have sent me those graceful and suggestive drawings, for which only now I am able to thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. It was very kind of you to let me have them.|$|E

Kneeling and bowing, {{and what was it}} Miss Mergle used to talk about? Of course!--ladies with long trains walking about backward. Everybody walked about backward at court, he knew, when not actually on their knees. Perhaps, though, some people regular stood up to the King! Talked to him, just as one might talk to Buggins, say. Cheek of course! Dukes, it might be, did that--by permission? Millionnaires?...|$|E
60|$|Then Clementina {{opened her}} letter. It {{was in a}} woman's hand, and the writer made haste to explain at the {{beginning}} that she was George W. Hinkle's sister, {{and that she was}} writing for him; for though he was now out of danger, he was still very weak, and they had all been anxious about him. A month before, he had been hurt in a railroad collision, and had come home from the West, where the accident happened, suffering mainly from shock, as his doctor thought; he had taken to his bed at once, and had not risen from it since. He had been out of his head a great part of the time, and had been forbidden everything that could distress or excite him. His sister said that she was writing for him now as soon as he had seen Clementina's letter; it had been forwarded from <b>one</b> <b>address</b> to another, and had at last found him there at his home in Ohio. He wished to say that he would come out for Clementina {{as soon as he was}} allowed to undertake the journey, and in the meantime she must let him know constantly where she was. The letter closed with a few words of love in his own handwriting.|$|E
