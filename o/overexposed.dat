5|$|By 1 March, over {{two-thirds of}} BuzzFeed users polled responded that {{the dress was}} white and gold. Some people have {{suggested}} that the dress changes colours on its own. Media outlets noted that the photo was <b>overexposed</b> and had poor white balance, causing its colours to be washed out, giving rise to the perception by some that the dress is white and gold rather than its actual colours.|$|E
5000|$|Avoid <b>overexposing</b> {{highlights}} (e.g. specular reflections {{and bright}} sky behind dark objects).|$|R
50|$|More {{than two}} {{exposures}} can be combined, with {{care not to}} <b>overexpose</b> the film.|$|R
5000|$|Another example occurs where a camera's shutter is miscalibrated and {{consistently}} <b>overexposes</b> or underexposes the film; similarly, a light meter may be inaccurate. One may adjust the EI rating accordingly {{in order to}} compensate for these defects {{and consistently}} produce correctly exposed negatives.|$|R
5|$|In mid-2011, Maroon 5 {{started working}} on their fourth studio album. One {{of the members of}} the band, James Valentine spoke to Billboard and {{revealed}} their plans to release their fourth studio album in early 2012. On March 22, 2012, the band posted a video on YouTube featuring numerous scenes from the band in the studio, recording the album. On June 26, 2012, the album was released under the title <b>Overexposed.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to imitate the {{conventions}} of silent cinema in its infancy, the staging and acting of the film are exaggerated and artificial. The equipment used by Acevedo had limitations, causing the indoor scenes to be underexposed and the outdoor scenes to be <b>overexposed.</b> The Pathé camera did not allow camera movement, had imprecise definition, and dark rendering. The Kodak Ektachrome lacked a large depth of field, producing a flat image, and required good lighting to operate effectively. Overhead shots are most commonly used, with some medium shots and {{a small number of}} large shots.|$|E
5|$|Born {{and raised}} in Los Angeles, California, Levine began his musical career in 1994, when he co-founded the {{alternative}} rock band Kara's Flowers, {{of which he was}} the lead vocalist and guitarist. The band split up after their only album, The Fourth World (released in 1997), which did not gain popularity. In 2001, the group was reformed – with guitarist James Valentine joining the line-up – and began a new musical chapter, changing their name to Maroon 5. In 2002, the band released their first album, Songs About Jane, which went multi-platinum in the US. Since then, they have released five more albums: It Won't Be Soon Before Long (2007), Hands All Over (2010), <b>Overexposed</b> (2012), V (2014) and Red Pill Blues (2017). As part of Maroon 5, Levine has received three Grammy Awards, two Billboard Music Awards, two American Music Awards, an MTV Video Music Award and a World Music Award.|$|E
50|$|Another {{challenge}} for bluescreen or greenscreen is proper camera exposure. Underexposing or <b>overexposing</b> a colored backdrop {{can lead to}} poor saturation levels. In the case of video cameras, underexposed images can contain high amounts of noise, as well. The background must be bright enough to allow the camera to create a bright and saturated image.|$|R
50|$|Depending on the {{distance}} to the subject, using the full power of the flash may greatly <b>overexpose</b> the subject especially at close range. Certain cameras allow the level of flash to be manually adjusted e.g. 1/3, 1/2, or 1/8 power, so that both the foreground and background are correctly exposed, or allow an automatic flash exposure compensation.|$|R
50|$|AEC {{devices are}} {{susceptible}} to operator error (usually due to mispositioned anatomy or having the incorrect AEC chamber selected). Prosthetic devices such as total hip hardware can also cause the selected ionization chamber to <b>overexpose</b> the image receptor. This {{is due to the}} absorption of the x-ray beam into the metal of the hardware as opposed to exposing the ionization chamber.|$|R
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} over five weeks, {{on the outskirts of}} Dallas, Texas. The film was produced on a budget of only USD$7,000, and a skeleton crew of five. Carruth acted as writer, director, producer, cinematographer, editor, and music composer. He also stars in the film as Aaron, and many of the other characters are played by his friends and family. The small budget required conservative use of the Super 16mm filmstock: the carefully limited number of takes resulted in an extremely low shooting ratio of 2:1. Every shot in the film was meticulously storyboarded on 35mm stills. Carruth created a distinctive flat, <b>overexposed</b> look for the film by using fluorescent lighting, non-neutral color temperatures, high-speed film stock, and filters.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} of labor for shooting the starship models was decided early on by effects cameramen Peter Daulton and Pat Sweeney. There was {{an equal amount of}} work if one crew did all the Enterprise shots and another did the Bird of Prey, Klingon cruiser and Excelsior shots, so the cameramen flipped to decide who worked on which models. Old and new techniques were applied to shooting the models. To make sure the vessels were seamlessly inserted into star fields in post-production, the crew filmed second passes in <b>overexposed</b> yellow light, which reduced light spillage onto the bluescreen backdrop. The yellow overcast was removed by filtration in the optical process, with the result being a clean edge around the ships.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of the Jovian rings was inferred from observations of the planetary radiation belts by Pioneer 11 spacecraft in 1975. In 1979 the Voyager 1 spacecraft obtained a single <b>overexposed</b> image of the ring system. More extensive imaging was conducted by Voyager 2 in the same year, which allowed rough determination of the ring’s structure. The superior quality of the images obtained by the Galileo orbiter between 1995 and 2003 greatly extended the existing knowledge about the Jovian rings. Ground-based observation of the rings by the Keck telescope in 1997 and 2002 and the HST in 1999 revealed the rich structure visible in back-scattered light. Images transmitted by the New Horizons spacecraft in February–March 2007 allowed observation of the fine structure in the main ring for the first time. In 2000, the Cassini spacecraft en route to Saturn conducted extensive observations of the Jovian ring system. Future missions to the Jovian system will provide additional information about the rings.|$|E
30|$|The {{user can}} assign higher weights to various areas of {{interest}} such that the desired amount of back-light compensation is achieved and good perception of objects of interest is ensured. Hence, if a certain object enters the area of interest, this is detected and the video-level control <b>overexposes</b> the image so that object details become visible. However, there are two principal disadvantages of this approach.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Strickland Falls in Tasmania, Australia, taken using {{a neutral}} density filter. ND filters reduce light {{of all colors}} or {{wavelengths}} equally, allowing an increase in aperture and decrease in shutter speed without <b>overexposing</b> the image. To create the motion blur seen here, the shutter must be kept open for a relatively long time, making it necessary {{to reduce the amount}} of light coming through the lens.|$|R
40|$|Television camera {{selectively}} attenuates bright {{areas in}} scene without affecting dim areas. Camera views scenes containing extremes {{of light and}} dark without <b>overexposing</b> light areas and underexposing dark ones. Camera uses liquid-crystal light valve for selective attenuation. Feedback cathoderay tube locally alters reflection characteristics of liquid-crystal light valve. Results in point-to-point optoelectronic automatic gain control to enable viewing of both dark and very bright areas within scene...|$|R
5|$|The outdoor {{scene in}} which Xander sees Buffy in the sandbox was {{intentionally}} <b>overexposed,</b> intensifying the foreground and blowing out the background, making the sky look white; flash frames were also used in the shot of Buffy in the desert. Whedon allowed some shots to last far longer than is common in a television episode; this cinematic technique allowed the images to take on meaning. Highly stylized lighting is used throughout Xander's dream. In the university hallway the scene is lit with green and orange gels, while the almost shot-for-shot re-creation of the Apocalypse Now section is lit with carefully controlled spotlights which allow the background to fall out to black. Whedon cites The Limey as an inspiration for the unnaturally colored university sequence, and had the scene from Apocalypse Now playing on tape during filming to ensure as close a match as possible for that sequence. When Xander is driving the ice cream truck with Anya, the backgrounds outside the car intentionally look fake, to {{give a sense of}} stillness where there should be motion. Whedon originally wanted to use rear-screen projection for the driving scene, but had to utilize greenscreen instead, as rear-screen projection would be difficult to set up on their stages. Some special effects shots came about by accident; in his commentary Whedon explains that when Buffy smeared the mud all over her face, it looked as though she was giving herself a facial. He therefore dissolved the shot into a negative image, creating intense colors that made the shot more interesting.|$|E
5|$|WALL-E was {{the most}} complex Pixar {{production}} since Monsters, Inc. because {{of the world and}} the history that had to be conveyed. Whereas most Pixar films have up to 75,000 storyboards, WALL-E required 125,000. Production designer Ralph Eggleston wanted the lighting of the first act on Earth to be romantic, and that of the second act on the Axiom to be cold and sterile. During the third act, the romantic lighting is slowly introduced into the Axiom environment. Pixar studied Chernobyl and the city of Sofia to create the ruined world; art director Anthony Christov was from Bulgaria and recalled Sofia used to have problems storing its garbage. Eggleston bleached out the whites on Earth to make WALL-E feel vulnerable. The <b>overexposed</b> light makes the location look more vast. Because of the haziness, the cubes making up the towers of garbage had to be large, otherwise they would have lost shape (in turn, this helped save rendering time). The dull tans of Earth subtly become soft pinks and blues when EVE arrives. When WALL-E shows EVE all his collected items, all the lights he has collected light up to give an inviting atmosphere, like a Christmas tree. Eggleston tried to avoid the colors yellow and green so WALL-E—who was made yellow to emulate a tractor—would not blend into the deserted Earth, and to make the plant more prominent.|$|E
25|$|In most urban environments, {{the amount}} of {{naturally}} occurring suitable insect food is insufficient. They should remain outdoors where {{they are able to}} regulate their own body temperatures using sunlight (like most reptiles, they die if deprived of, or <b>overexposed</b> to the sun).|$|E
50|$|Old video {{technology}} {{only had}} a 5 stop exposure dynamic range. Modern HD video cameras have up to 14 stops. The exposure range is therefore less of an issue than before, although {{there is still a}} popular belief that video is considerably worse than film in the shoulder of the gamma curve, where whites blow out in video, while film tends to <b>overexpose</b> more evenly and gracefully.|$|R
5000|$|It {{is worth}} noting that the {{photographer}} may carefully <b>overexpose</b> or underexpose the photograph to eliminate [...] "insignificant" [...] or [...] "unwanted" [...] detail; to make, for example, a white altar cloth appear immaculately clean, or to emulate the heavy, pitiless shadows of film noir. However, it is technically much easier to discard recorded information during post processing than to try to 're-create' unrecorded information.|$|R
50|$|In 1859 Louis Antoine Debrauz de Saldapenna orchestrated in Paris, as the {{personal}} {{representative of the}} Austrian Archduke Ferdinand Maximilan, the Lombardo-Venetian Count Castellani's proceedings against Egypt, which were also supported by Édouard Drouyn de Lhuys As a result, Castellani succeeded in extracting the then enormous sum of 700,000 francs as compensation for damages allegedly caused by <b>overexposing</b> valuable Chinese silk worms to the sun during transport between Suez and Cairo.|$|R
25|$|On {{the right}} is a 1/10-second {{exposure}} showing an <b>overexposed</b> full moon. The Moon is seen through thin vaporous clouds, which glow with a bright disk surrounded by an illuminated red ring. A longer exposure would show more faint colors beyond the outside red ring.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 1950s, {{professional}} wrestling {{had lost its}} high ratings, and producers, realizing that they had <b>overexposed</b> it, soon dropped most wrestling shows from their lineups. The remaining televised wrestling promoters had small, local syndicated shows, which network producers placed as late-night fillers rather than signature programming. Promoters used localized television as a weapon for eliminating the competition by purchasing airtime from rival territories, effectively putting them out of business.|$|E
25|$|The age {{at which}} puberty begins varies between individuals; usually, puberty begins between 10 and 13 years of age. The {{age at which}} puberty begins is {{affected}} by both genetic factors and by environmental factors such as nutritional state and social circumstances. An example of social circumstances is the Vandenbergh effect; a juvenile female who has significant interaction with adult males will enter puberty earlier than juvenile females who are not socially <b>overexposed</b> to adult males.|$|E
50|$|Shonal Rawat {{has acted}} in Hindi comedy serial Aaj Ke Shriman Shrimati {{as a film}} actress Aishwarya Sen.She is all set to host Sony TV's comedy-based reality show Champion Chaalbaaz No.1. As the channel heads took a {{combined}} decision of not <b>overexposing</b> Mona Singh to the reality show scenario, keeping in mind the to-be-launched reality show, The Extreme Makeover, Shonal Rawat now takes over the anchoring responsibilities of Champion Chaalbaaz No. 1.|$|R
50|$|The 3D Color Matrix Metering II {{tends to}} <b>overexpose</b> minor {{parts of the}} image (e.g. sky or bright back-lights) if it detects faces near the image center that are darker (e.g. in shadow) than these minor parts. This feature is {{sometimes}} surprising due to reliable scene recognition and face detection (including side-view of faces) of the new high-resolution sensor, {{even if there are}} only strangers (in the dark) near the image center.|$|R
50|$|A {{derivative}} of contrast masking is unsharp masking, an unusual {{term for a}} process intended to increase the apparent sharpness (acutance) of an image. Unsharp masking uses a blurred form of the image to increase contrast along regions of moderate contrast difference. Around edges, the blur region causes highlights to <b>overexpose</b> and shadows to underexpose. Taken to an extreme, the edges become overly visible and detract from {{the quality of the}} image—this is referred to as halation.|$|R
25|$|Riis's {{first team}} soon {{tired of the}} late hours, and Riis had to find other help. Both his assistants were lazy and one was dishonest, selling plates for which Riis had paid. Riis sued him in court successfully. Nagle {{suggested}} that Riis should become self-sufficient, so in January 1888 Riis paid $25 for a 4×5 box camera, plateholders, a tripod and equipment for developing and printing. He took the equipment to the potter's field cemetery on Hart Island to practice, making two exposures. The result was seriously <b>overexposed</b> but successful.|$|E
25|$|Living Things debuted {{at number}} one on the Billboard 200, selling 223,000 copies, beating out Maroon 5's <b>Overexposed</b> by 1,000 sales, {{according}} to Nielsen SoundScan, and fell to number 5 on its second week on chart selling 64,000 copies. The album has reached the top spot in seventeen countries becoming their best charting album so far and has been certified Gold in Australia for shipments of at least 35,000 copies, and also attained Gold certification in Switzerland. It also debuted at number one in UK Albums Chart, selling 41,000 copies beating out Maroon 5's album once again. In Canada, the album also debuted at number one selling at least 20,000 copies. As of June 2014, the album has sold 681,000 copies in the United States.|$|E
25|$|This ident {{remained}} with the station {{until the end}} of its existence with some modifications, firstly the jingle was altered to nine notes on a guitar a few years later, and then the background was revealed to be blue in 1969 with the introduction of colour (blue was the background colour of the ident as used in black and white, being shot with black background and white star would have given too much contrast and <b>overexposed</b> the camera). This ident with blue background colour was maintained after the introduction of colour transmissions because this still provided a good contrast on black and white TV sets. This ident, occasionally supplemented by a subsequent caption stating 'The Station that serves the South', lasted until the company went off air in 1982.|$|E
5000|$|The {{purpose of}} an {{exposure}} meter is {{to estimate the}} subject's mid-tone luminance and indicate the camera exposure settings required to record this as a mid-tone. In order to do this it {{has to make a}} number of assumptions which, under certain circumstances, will be wrong. If the exposure setting indicated by an exposure meter is taken as the [...] "reference" [...] exposure, the photographer may wish to deliberately <b>overexpose</b> or underexpose in order to compensate for known or anticipated metering inaccuracies.|$|R
50|$|Several of {{the critics}} also argue that, due to the {{increased}} degree of involvement of the civilian population, that this policy <b>overexposes</b> civilians {{to the dangers of}} the conflict, becoming potential targets for any abuses committed both by the illegal armed groups and the government's security forces. From this point of view, the resulting polarization caused by the long-term application of the policy would also be considered an obstacle to the achievement of a negotiated solution of the conflict with FARC and ELN guerrillas.|$|R
50|$|Combination {{printing}} {{was popular}} in the mid-19th century due to {{the limitations of the}} negative's light sensitivity and camera technology. For example, the long exposures required at the time to create an image would properly expose the main subject, such as a building, but would completely <b>overexpose</b> the sky. The sky would then lack detail, usually appearing as solid white. Hippolyte Bayard, a French photographer, was the first to suggest combining two separate negatives, one of the subject matter and one of a properly exposed negative of clouds, to create a balanced photograph.|$|R
