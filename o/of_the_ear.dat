5|$|Anomalies and malformations of the pinna are common. These {{anomalies}} include chromosome syndromes such as ring 18. Children {{may also}} present cases of abnormal ear canals and low ear implantation. In rare cases no pinna is formed (atresia), or is extremely small (microtia). Small pinnae can develop when the auricular hillocks do not develop properly. The ear canal can fail to develop {{if it does}} not channelise properly or if there is an obstruction. Reconstructive surgery to treat hearing loss is considered as an option for children older than five, with a cosmetic surgical procedure to reduce the size or change the shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> is called an otoplasty. The initial medical intervention is aimed at assessing the baby's hearing and the condition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> canal, as well as the middle and inner ear. Depending on the results of tests, reconstruction of the outer ear is done in stages, with planning for any possible repairs of the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ear.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cocker Spaniels {{and other}} dogs that have long, {{pendulous}} ears are more predisposed to ear problems {{than some other}} breeds. The fold <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> can prevent air from entering, and it also creates a warm, moist environment where organisms can grow. Otitis externa is an inflammation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> canal which {{can be caused by}} a variety of factors including parasites, microorganisms, foreign bodies, tumors, and underlying dermatological disease. Ear mites can cause otitis externa; ticks and fleas can also live in dogs' ear canals.|$|E

5|$|Providing balance, {{when moving}} or stationary, {{is also a}} central {{function}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ear.</b> The ear facilitates two types of balance: static balance, which allows a person to feel the effects of gravity, and dynamic balance, which allows a person to sense acceleration.|$|E

5|$|The {{face and}} the upper lips are reddish to pink, not dark brown to black as in M.mystacinus. Although most of the face is hairy, {{the area around the}} eyes is bare. The {{nostrils}} are heart-shaped, and their back end is broad, as in M.brandtii, not narrow as in M.mystacinus. Several glands are present on the muzzle, most prominently in reproductively active males. The ears are brown and are lighter on the inside than the outside. There is a notch at the edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ear,</b> and the pointed tragus (a projection inside the ear that is present in some bats) extends up to this notch; the tragus is longer, extending beyond the notch, in both M.brandtii and M.mystacinus. The base of the inner side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> is white; it is much darker in M.mystacinus. The feet and the thumbs are very small. The small size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ear,</b> tragus, feet, and thumb distinguishes M.alcathoe from the slightly larger M.mystacinus and M.brandtii, but the feet are relatively larger than in M.mystacinus.|$|E

5|$|The {{outer ear}} is the {{external}} portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> and includes the fleshy visible pinna (also called the auricle), the ear canal, {{and the outer}} layer of the eardrum (also called the tympanic membrane).|$|E
5|$|The ear may be {{affected}} by disease, including infection and traumatic damage. Diseases <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> may lead to hearing loss, tinnitus and balance disorders such as vertigo, although many of these conditions may also {{be affected}} by damage to the brain or neural pathways leading from the ear.|$|E
5|$|The {{outer ear}} is {{supplied}} {{by a number}} of arteries. The posterior auricular artery provides the majority of the blood supply. The anterior auricular arteries provide some supply to the outer rim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> and scalp behind it. The posterior auricular artery is a direct branch of the external carotid artery, and the anterior auricular arteries are branches from the superficial temporal artery. The occipital artery also plays a role.|$|E

5|$|After implantation, {{around the}} second to third week the {{developing}} embryo consists of three layers: endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm. The first part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> to develop is the inner ear, which begins to form from the ectoderm around the 22nd day of the embryo’s development. Specifically, the inner ear derives from two thickenings called otic placodes {{on either side of}} the head. Each otic placode recedes below the ectoderm, forms an otic pit and then an otic vesicle. This entire mass will eventually become surrounded by mesenchyme to form the bony labyrinth.|$|E
5|$|Each sensory system {{begins with}} {{specialized}} receptor cells, such as light-receptive neurons in the retina of the eye, or vibration-sensitive neurons in the cochlea <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ear.</b> The axons of sensory receptor cells travel into {{the spinal cord}} or brain, where they transmit their signals to a first-order sensory nucleus dedicated to one specific sensory modality. This primary sensory nucleus sends information to higher-order sensory areas that are dedicated to the same modality. Eventually, via a way-station in the thalamus, the signals are sent to the cerebral cortex, where they are processed to extract the relevant features, and integrated with signals coming from other sensory systems.|$|E
5|$|The {{brain was}} {{slightly}} sigmoidal (S-shaped), without much {{expansion of the}} cerebral hemispheres, more like a crocodile than a bird. This {{is in keeping with}} the overall conservatism of non-coelurosaurian theropod brains. Acrocanthosaurus had large and bulbous olfactory bulbs, indicating a good sense of smell. Reconstructing the semicircular canals <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ear,</b> which control balance, shows that the head was held at a 25° angle below horizontal. This was determined by orienting the endocast so that the lateral semicircular canal was parallel to the ground, as it usually is when an animal is in an alert posture.|$|E

5|$|The {{internal}} structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ear,</b> which has {{large numbers of}} auditory neurons, gives an improved ability to detect low-frequency sounds at a distance, which could include rustling made by prey moving in vegetation. The tawny owl's hearing is ten times better than a human's, and it can hunt using this sense {{alone in the dark}} of a woodland on an overcast night, but the patter of raindrops makes it difficult to detect faint sounds, and prolonged wet weather can lead to starvation if the owl cannot hunt effectively.|$|E
5|$|The pinna {{consists}} of the curving outer rim called the helix, the inner curved rim called the antihelix, and opens into the ear canal. The tragus protrudes and partially obscures the ear canal, as does the facing antitragus. The hollow region in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> canal is called the concha. The ear canal stretches for about 1inch (2.5cm). The {{first part of the}} canal is surrounded by cartilage, while the second part near the eardrum is surrounded by bone. This bony part is known as the auditory bulla and is formed by the tympanic part of the temporal bone. The skin surrounding the ear canal contains ceruminous and sebaceous glands that produce protective ear wax. The ear canal ends at the external surface of the eardrum.|$|E
5|$|Two sets {{of muscles}} are {{associated}} with the outer ear: the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles. In some mammals, these muscles can adjust the direction of the pinna. In humans, these muscles have little or no effect. The ear muscles are supplied by the facial nerve, which also supplies sensation to the skin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> itself, {{as well as to the}} external ear cavity. The great auricular nerve, auricular nerve, auriculotemporal nerve, and lesser and greater occipital nerves of the cervical plexus all supply sensation to parts of the outer ear and the surrounding skin.|$|E

5|$|Without treatment, {{episodes of}} acute gout may develop into chronic gout with {{destruction}} of joint surfaces, joint deformity and painless tophi. These tophi occur in 30% {{of those who}} are untreated for five years, often in the helix <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ear,</b> over the olecranon processes, or on the Achilles tendons. With aggressive treatment, they may dissolve. Kidney stones also frequently complicate gout, affecting between 10 and 40% of people and occur due to low urine pH promoting the precipitation of uric acid. Other forms of chronic kidney dysfunction may occur.|$|E
5|$|A {{medium-sized}} gray bat, Myotis escalerai {{is similar}} to Myotis nattereri. The fur is long and soft; with a brown tone on the back, and the brighter underparts approaching white. The feet are dark gray. Much of the face is pink, and the muzzle is pointed, with long hairs on the upper lip resembling a moustache. The long ears are brown to gray. The tragus, a projection {{on the inner side}} of the outer ear, is long and reaches to the middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> and colored gray to yellow, becoming darker from the base towards the tip. According to several authors, it differs from M.nattereri in showing a distinct fringe of hairs on the tail membrane, but bat specialist A.M. Hutson writes that this feature does not distinguish the two species. In addition, the presence of an S-shaped spur on the uropatagium (membrane between the hind legs), which approaches the middle of the membrane, is a distinctive feature of this species. With its broad wings, low flight, and rapid wingbeats, the species is capable of precise, agile flight.|$|E
5|$|After {{passing the}} {{required}} examinations, Negus proceeded in 1909 {{to the next}} stage of his basic medical education at the nearby King's College Hospital, at that time located on Portugal Street between the Strand and Lincoln's Inn Fields. Three more years of study led to the attainment in 1912 of the MRCS and LRCP (Membership of the Royal College of Surgeons and Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians, known as the 'conjoint diploma'), marking his formal qualification to practice medicine. In the final year of these studies, Negus was an usher at the funeral service for Lord Lister at Westminster Abbey. Another connection with Lister's generation came when Negus worked as surgical dresser and house surgeon under Sir William Watson Cheyne, who had himself been house surgeon to Lister. The postgraduate stages of Negus's training involved specialisation in diseases <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ear,</b> nose and throat, a direction influenced and guided by the otorhinolaryngologist St Clair Thomson (1857–1943). In the years following his qualification in 1912, Negus worked at King's College Hospital, and had started further clinical training at the Hospital for Diseases of the Throat in Golden Square, Soho, but this was interrupted by the outbreak of the First World War.|$|E
