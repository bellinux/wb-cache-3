50|$|Film is a {{vital part}} of our culture - {{sometimes}} window, sometimes mirror; sometimes clear, simple and stark; sometimes subtle, complex and mysterious.As a medium of art and entertainment, film has roots in both the past and Present, and the insights of contemporary audience. We are cinephiles from the South Puget Sound area, interested in expanding our engagement with film and in developing <b>our</b> <b>insights</b> into filmmaking and filmmakers. We have therefore joined together, forming the Olympia Film Society, to extend and share our understanding and enjoyment of the cinematic arts. Our mission is to enhance film appreciation within the community by promoting alternative films and by aiding and encouraging the development of allied arts.|$|E
5000|$|According to Jim A. Kuypers, a {{dual purpose}} for {{performing}} criticism should be primarily to enhance our appreciation and understanding. 'We wish to enhance both {{our own and}} others' understanding of the rhetorical act; we wish to share <b>our</b> <b>insights</b> with others, and to enhance their appreciation of the rhetorical act. These are not hollow goals, but quality of life issues. By improving understanding and appreciation, the critic can offer new and potentially exciting ways for others to see the world. Through understanding we also produce knowledge about human communication; in theory this should help us to better govern our interactions with others.' Criticism is a humanizing activity in that it explores and highlights qualities that make us human." ...|$|E

The inaccessibility of the website coincides with the campaigning period of the bitterly contested 2011 Sarawak elections and may be a distributed Denial of service attack. Nonetheless, the station continued their daily one-hour broadcast on shortwave from 1000 UTC - 1100 UTC. Radio Free Sarawak's sister site, Sarawak Report has also been subject to a massive cyber attack although effort is being made to get both the websites back into operation.
