40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} service design cases by <b>online</b> <b>service</b> companies and suggests framework to understand service design of them. Background: Recently, exploratory service design cases by <b>online</b> <b>service</b> companies such as Google, Apple, and NHN has been developed. <b>Service</b> design and <b>online</b> <b>service</b> experience design has been booming among user experience professionals but these two areas are not clearly defined. It is interesting to study the definition and key factors of <b>service</b> design and <b>online</b> <b>service</b> experience design. Moreover, investigating service design cases by <b>online</b> <b>service</b> companies is needed. Method: Due to diversification of service design cases by <b>online</b> <b>service</b> companies, this study has reviewed online resources and literatures about top 5 <b>online</b> <b>service</b> companies in USA and Korea. Furthermore, this study used expert interview who worked for service design at NHN. To understand the attributes of service design cases, this study developed 3 types of service design classifications scheme such as service design as extension of <b>online</b> <b>service,</b> space design and event service design. Finally, this study suggested a new framework for service design cases. Results: This study investigated service design cases by <b>online</b> <b>service</b> companies and suggests key issues and frameworks to uncover <b>service</b> design for <b>online</b> <b>service.</b> Conclusion: Service design cases for <b>online</b> <b>service</b> was analyzed by 2 * 2 matrix(extension, enrichment*product, service) to explain characteristics and attributes.

40|$|Purpose The Internet {{has changed}} the way {{services}} are delivered and has created new forms of customer-firm interactions. Whilst <b>online</b> <b>service</b> failures remain inevitable, the Internet offers opportunities for delivering efficient service recovery through the online channel. Notwithstanding, research evidence on how firms can deliver <b>online</b> <b>service</b> recovery remains scarce. This study investigates the impact of two <b>online</b> <b>service</b> recovery strategies - online information and technology-mediated communication - on customer satisfaction, switching and word-of-mouth intentions. Design/methodology/approach A scenario-based experiment is employed. Data are analysed using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings Online information and technology-mediated interactions {{can be used as}} <b>online</b> <b>service</b> recovery strategies. When fair, <b>online</b> <b>service</b> recovery can restore customer satisfaction, lower switching and enhance positive word-of-mouth. Interactional justice delivered through technology-mediated communication is a strong predictor of satisfaction with <b>online</b> <b>service</b> recovery. Yet, customers in subscription services show greater expectations of <b>online</b> <b>service</b> recovery than those in non-subscription services. Research limitations/implications Further research could examine the impact of <b>online</b> <b>service</b> recovery on relational constructs, such as trust. Since customers participate in the online recovery process, future research could investigate the role of customers as co-creators of <b>online</b> <b>service</b> recovery. Practical implications Service managers should design online recovery strategies that meet customer need for interactional justice, for example, bespoke emails, and virtual chat communications showing genuine customer care.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to explore the impact of <b>online</b> <b>service</b> quality on the level of customer delight and on the development of customer relationships. Design/methodology/approach – A self-complete survey was used to collect data from a convenience sample of 200 Australian respondents who use online banking. Factor analysis and structural equation modelling were used to test the proposed model of relationships. Findings – <b>Online</b> <b>service</b> quality has no impact on customer delight, e-trust or the development of stronger relationships with customers. It does have a relationship to e-loyalty. However, the “efficiency” dimension of <b>online</b> <b>service</b> quality is related to e-trust and also indirectly to relationship strength through e-trust. The “personal need” and “site organization” dimensions of <b>online</b> <b>service</b> quality are related to e-loyalty, with “personal needs” exhibiting the strongest impact. Customer delight has no relationship to <b>online</b> <b>service</b> quality, nor e-trust, relationship strength or e-loyalty. Research limitations/implications – Generalizability is the main issue. Further research is required to confirm results and examine the identified lack of association between customer delight and e-loyalty. Further exploration of all scales is recommended. <b>Online</b> <b>service</b> quality is not a sufficient method for retaining customers through relationship building and does not result in delighting customers. Practical implications – <b>Online</b> <b>service</b> quality is not enough to develop strong relationships with bank customers. Banks can achieve customer loyalty through attending to their personal needs in online situations as well as providing a well organized site. Alternatively, if banks wish to develop strong relationships with customers, they must provide user-friendly and efficient websites while also developing trust in the website. Relationship building and e-loyalty appears to represent different things to different customers. Therefore, <b>online</b> <b>service</b> quality alone is not a sufficient means of building strong relationships and retaining customers. Originality/value – Results provide important insights into the impact of <b>online</b> <b>service</b> quality on relationship building with customers. Also <b>online</b> <b>service</b> quality for banks appears different to other previously researched retail settings and has different associated outcomes. 24 page(s...|$|R

5|$|Unlike {{the usual}} product {{development}} cycle, which grows a concept into a final product, {{most of the}} development work in Rare Replay was in converging 30 games across six platforms onto one disc. The engineering challenge lay in the quantity of games and platforms being emulated rather than the emulation effort itself. Rare worked in close collaboration with Microsoft, who were secretly developing the Xbox One's backward-compatibility features, which Rare ultimately used in Rare Replay. The Microsoft team helped prepare Rare's nine Xbox 360 games for the release. Their discontinued <b>online</b> <b>services</b> were not restored for the compilation. On Rare Replay design, lead designer Paul Collins added that the Snapshot challenges were built to encourage players to sample all of the games, and that the rewind feature was to help all players finish the games without quitting in frustration. The compilation's opening musical number was a compromise from the original vision: a musical history of the company's oeuvre, as told through small musical introductions to each Snapshot. The final opening was intended to evoke players' memories of Rare properties, and includes several Easter eggs.|$|E
5|$|The Kinect, a motion-sensing {{input device}} made by Microsoft and {{designed}} as a video game controller, was first introduced in November 2010, and was upgraded for the 2013 release of the eighth-generation Xbox One video game console. Kinect's capabilities were revealed in May 2013. The new Kinect uses an ultra-wide 1080p camera, which can function in the dark due to an infrared sensor. It employs higher-end processing power and new software, can distinguish between fine movements (such as a thumb movements), and can determine a user's heart rate by looking at his/her face. Microsoft filed a patent application in 2011 that suggests that the corporation may use the Kinect camera system to monitor the behavior of television viewers {{as part of a}} plan to make the viewing experience more interactive.

Among these were other staff changes: Komoto was reassigned to become lead game designer, Akihiko Yoshida became lead scenario concept artist, Hiroshi Takai was appointed as lead artist, and Akihiko Matsui became lead combat system designer. Yoshida's main priority was to make the game a playable experience after the poor launch and subsequent reaction. Through subsequent patches to the game, multiple graphical and gameplay improvements were made: among the most notable were the addition of a job system, personal chocobos, a revamped battle system, greater customization options for gear, and multiple new dungeons and bosses. Yoshida also introduced the official Final Fantasy XIV forums in order to obtain player feedback and suggestions, and stated that interacting with and growing closer to the community would be a high priority.
