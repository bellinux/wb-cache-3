5|$|A Passover Seder is {{a ritual}} meal held by Jews {{on the first}} two nights of the Passover holiday (first night only in Israel). The Seder is {{traditionally}} conducted in the home by the family and their invited guests, although it may also be held by any group of Jews, such as members of a synagogue, condominium complex, student group, army base, etc. At the Seder, participants read the Haggadah, a ritual text recounting the liberation of the Israelites from slavery in ancient Egypt. The reading is accompanied by visual aids {{in the form of the}} symbolic foods on the Passover Seder Plate. A festive meal is part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ritual.</b> While religious Jewish law places certain restrictions on a non-Jew eating at a Seder, non-traditional Jews often invite non-Jews to their Seders, and non-Jews also conduct Seders of their own.|$|E

5|$|A {{similar story}} was {{published}} about Catherine Babington, first in her obituary, in Shelby, North Carolina, in 1886, {{then in a}} short book by her son outlining her masonic career. Hailed as the only female mason in the United States, {{she is said to}} have obtained the secrets at the age of 16 by hiding in her uncles' lodge room in Princess, Kentucky. Having lost her father at an early age, she spent much of her childhood at her grandfather's house, where she became a favourite of her uncles. They attended a lodge in an unused chapel above Catherine's school-room, which she often helped them clean. As a teenager, Catherine Sweet (Babington being her married name) attended lodge meetings for a year, hiding in the old pulpit, finally being discovered when one of her uncles returned unexpectedly for a rifle he had left in the ante-room. Being questioned by the lodge, it was discovered that she had committed much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ritual</b> to memory, and was, like Anderson, made a mason to swear her to secrecy, but in this instance not admitted to membership of the lodge. The sole source of the story is her son, and much of the detail remains unconfirmed. There is no account or recollection of such a lodge room in or around Princess.|$|E
5|$|Practicing correct sexual {{practices}} was one method of perfecting the body's internal spirits. The Celestial Masters believed that semen is {{the embodiment of}} qi. If someone ejaculated too often, their life would be shortened. In fact, the Xiang'er indicates that people should not even have sex {{for the purposes of}} reproduction. The Celestial Masters frowned upon the practice of heqi (also known as 'The Union of the Breaths') of not ejaculating during sex in order to 'nourish the brain', and advocated non-ejaculation simply as a way to avoid losing qi. In addition, the Celestial Masters thought that the method of stealing a woman's qi to replenish the man's own qi was completely wrong, and should not be practiced. Despite their opposition to 'heqi' and reproductive sex, there is the possibility that the Celestial Masters supported sex for purposes other than reproduction, and a Celestial Master text from around the 5th century describes an elaborate sexual ritual.See Kalinowski(1985) for a full description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ritual.</b>|$|E

The fatwa also allowed the omission of the prayersnormally performed an obligatory five times a day at prescribed timeswhen they were prevented from doing so, and instructed them to make up the missed prayers at night instead. It also provided instructions for performing the ritual dry ablution (tayammum) when ritually pure water was not available, to replace the ritual ablution (wudu) that is ordinarily required before performing the salat. When tayammum was not possible, even making slight pointing motions with hands or face toward clean earth, stone, or tree was acceptable.|$|E

40|$|A common {{endeavor}} in <b>the</b> field <b>of</b> menstruation {{studies has}} been to examine <b>the</b> positive/negative dichotomy <b>of</b> menstruation <b>rituals,</b> <b>the</b> embodiment <b>of</b> purity/pollution by women and the oppression/empowerment duality often accorded to women 2 ̆ 7 s experience vis-à-vis <b>the</b> <b>rituals.</b> By bypassing this binary allotment and understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rituals,</b> this qualitative study investigates how menstruation rituals serve {{as a case study}} for a deeper understanding of women 2 ̆ 7 s agency in patriarchal societies and <b>the</b> changing role <b>of</b> patriarchy in traditional cultures in contemporary times. The research draws upon 62 in-depth interviews among Hindu women of Nepalese origin in Bhutan, India, Nepal, the U. K., and the U.

By using various typifications of ritual performance as ports of analysis, my study trails the following issues surrounding menstruation: women 2 ̆ 7 s perception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rituals</b> within a religious context and <b>the</b> adaptive modalities <b>of</b> religiosity they undertake to make meaning of their religious selves; women 2 ̆ 7 s impression of their menstruating, ritualized bodies as agentic selves; and <b>the</b> transference <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rituals</b> and their meanings from one generation to another and one geographical space to the next...|$|R

5|$|The most {{important}} religious rite for Heathens is called blót, which constitutes a ritual in which offerings are {{provided to the}} gods. Blót typically takes place outdoors, and usually consists of an offering of mead, which is contained within a bowl. The gods are invoked and requests expressed for their aid, as the priest uses a sprig or branch of an evergreen tree to sprinkle mead onto both statues of the deities and the assembled participants. This procedure might be scripted or largely improvised. Finally, the bowl of mead is poured onto a fire, or onto the earth, as a final libation to the gods. Sometimes, a communal meal is held afterward; in some groups this is incorporated as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ritual</b> itself. In other instances, the blót is simpler and less ritualized; in this case, it can involve a practitioner setting some food aside, sometimes without words, for either gods or wights. Some Heathens perform such rituals on a daily basis, although for others it is a more occasional performance. Aside from honoring deities, communal blóts {{also serve as a}} form of group bonding.|$|E
5|$|The {{festivals and}} daily rituals do not adhere to {{standard}} Hindu Agamic or Buddhist rituals. It follows what Paul Younger calls as ancient Vedda traditions of worship. Although since the medieval period Hindus, Buddhists and even Muslims {{have tried to}} co-opt the temple, deity and its worship as their own, the rituals maintained by the native priests are still intact. The main festival known in Sinhalese as Esela Perehera. It is celebrated during the months of July and August. About 45 days before the festival begins, the priests go into the forest and find two forked branches of a sacred tree. The branches are then immersed in the local river and kept at the shrines dedicated to Kataragama deviyo and Vali. When the main festival begins, the Yantra representing the deity is retrieved from its storage location, paraded through a street {{on top of an}} elephant, and carried to the Valli shrine. After two hours it is returned. On {{the last day of the}} festival the Yantra is left overnight at the Valli shrine and brought back to the main shrine. The priests conduct the rituals in silence, covering their mouths with white cloth. Associated with the main festival is fire walking arranged by a master <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ritual.</b> Hundreds of devotees participate in fire walking, yet others participate in ecstatic dance forms called Kavadi and body piercing. Many of the pilgrims exhibit signs of being possessed.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the inter-relation between <b>the</b> masks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Egungun and Gelede cults with the function and structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rituals</b> will be explored. Tribal masks {{serve as a}} means <b>of</b> symbolizing <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> social control in <b>the</b> <b>ritual</b> context. Social control refers not only to direct control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> society's behavior (eg. police) but to indirect control as well. This indirect regulation of behavior is done by means of rituals which get people to commit and reaffirm themselves to Yoruba values and common beliefs. These <b>rituals</b> provide <b>the</b> milieu in which social criticism and control of deviant behavior can take place. Among <b>the</b> multiple functions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rituals,</b> <b>the</b> author focuses upon {{the means by which}} they regulate social control and by which they enable <b>the</b> expression <b>of</b> common cultural and social values. Taking all this into account, a mask used in a ritual context appears to be <b>the</b> physical manifestation <b>of</b> man expressing his criticism of behavior that violates societal norms. The author shows how masks symbolize <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> social control {{and that there is a}} dynamic interaction between art and society...|$|R
