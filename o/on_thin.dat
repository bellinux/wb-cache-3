5|$|A.viridimontanum is {{difficult}} to distinguish from its parent species in the field. It can generally be separated from A.pedatum by {{the shape of the}} ultimate segments (the smallest divisions of the leaf), and by its habitat <b>on</b> <b>thin,</b> exposed serpentine soils rather than in rich woodlands. It more closely resembles A.aleuticum; however, the stalks of the ultimate segments and the false indusia are longer and the spores larger.|$|E
5|$|Adiantum viridimontanum largely reproduces asexually by {{branching}} {{rather than}} sexually through spores. While wind-blown spores {{can result in}} sexual reproduction for the species, most spores probably fall within a relatively short radius of the plant. In addition, reproduction through spore dispersal requires the spore to land in suitable conditions for generating a gametophyte, typically in bright sunlight <b>on</b> <b>thin</b> serpentine soils. These requirements allow A.viridimontanum to colonize recently disturbed sites on ultramafic outcrops, where bedrock has been exposed and competing plants have been removed. The populations appear stable, with the long life of individuals compensating for low recruitment rates.|$|E

30|$|Thinning {{increased}} (P = 0.001) 10 -hr TL fuels. Burning decreased 1 -hr TL fuels (P = 0.003), 10 -hr TL fuels (P = 0.003), 1000 +-hr TL Sound (P = 0.033), {{forest floor}} depth (P= 0.005), and forest floor mass (P = 0.006). There were interactions between thinning and burning for 1 -hr TL fuels (P = 0.006), 10 -hr TL fuels (P = 0.003), and fuelbed depth. The fuel mass interactions <b>on</b> <b>thinned</b> units occurred because of substantial fuel consumption <b>on</b> <b>thinned</b> units that were burned, {{likely due to}} more continuous and higher fuel loads after thinning. The interaction with fuelbed depth is due to large increases <b>on</b> <b>thinned</b> units, compared to almost no increase on those that were thinned and burned.|$|R
5|$|The company DuPont {{and many}} {{industrial}} historians dispute {{a link between}} nylon and hemp. They argue {{that the reason for}} developing nylon was to produce a fiber that could compete with silk and rayon in, for example, thin stockings for women. Silk was much more expensive than hemp and imported largely from Japan. There was more money in a substitute for silk. DuPont focused early <b>on</b> <b>thin</b> stockings for women. As a commercial product, nylon was a revolution in textiles. Strong and water-resistant, it was possible to make very thin fibers from cheap raw materials. The first sales in 1938 in New York of nylon stockings created a line with 4000 middle class women. For years to come, nylon demand was greater than DuPont could produce. And the DuPont Group was very big; it could move on if nylon had not become a success.|$|E
5|$|The formula {{was enacted}} as law {{to limit the}} weight-to-length ratio of a {{commercial}} motor vehicle (CMV). The formula is necessary to prevent the concentrated weight on a truck's axle from producing stress on bridge members (possibly causing a bridge collapse). In simplified form, this is analogous to a person walking <b>on</b> <b>thin</b> ice. When standing upright, a person's weight is concentrated {{at the bottom of}} their feet, funneling all of their weight into a small area. When lying down, a person's weight is distributed over a much larger area. This difference in weight distribution would allow a person to cross an area of ice while crawling that might otherwise collapse under their body weight while standing up. For an overweight truck to comply with the formula, more axles must be added, the distance between axles must be increased, or weight must be removed.|$|E

Using this design, Crewe demonstrated the ability to image atoms using annular dark-field imaging. Crewe and coworkers at the University of Chicago developed the cold field electron emission source and built a STEM able to visualize single heavy atoms <b>on</b> <b>thin</b> carbon substrates.
