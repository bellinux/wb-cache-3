5|$|A {{supernova}} is a cataclysmic {{explosion of}} a star. Within the Milky Way galaxy, supernova explosions occur on average once every 40 years. During {{the history of}} the Earth, multiple such events have likely occurred within a distance of 100 light years. Explosions inside this distance can contaminate the planet with radioisotopes and possibly impact the biosphere. Gamma rays emitted by a supernova react with nitrogen in the atmosphere, producing nitrous oxides. These molecules cause a depletion of the ozone layer that protects the surface from ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. An increase in UV-B radiation of only 10–30% is sufficient to cause a significant impact to life; particularly to the phytoplankton that form the base of the oceanic food chain. A supernova explosion at a distance of 26light years will reduce the <b>ozone</b> <b>column</b> density by half. On average, a supernova explosion occurs within 32light years once every few hundred million years, resulting in a depletion of the ozone layer lasting several centuries. Over the next two billion years, there will be about 20 supernova explosions and one gamma ray burst that will {{have a significant impact on}} the planet's biosphere.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Atmospheric ozone attenuates {{ultraviolet}} radiation reaching the Earth’s surface. Since UV-B radiation {{is considered the}} principal factor of causing the skin cancers, cataracts and some immunological disorders, determination of total <b>ozone</b> <b>column</b> has become everyday practice. In Serbia and Montenegro, such determinations are not being done. Satellite data for the entire globe are accessible. Objective: The objective of our work was to collect and analyze data for the territory of Serbia and Montenegro, because ozone is an important parameter {{for the study of}} effects and protection from UV radiation. METHODS Data collected during TOMS (Total Ozone Measuring Spectrometer) experiment are presented for grid whose elements are 1 ° latitude by 1. 25 ° longitude. Grid elements in which the territory of Serbia and Montenegro comprises more than 50 % of the element area were taken to represent the territory of Serbia and Montenegro. Eleven grid elements were selected and average monthly values for 272 months in the period from 1978 until 2004 were collected. Data for the period between 1993 and 1996 were unavailable. Results: Mean values of total <b>ozone</b> <b>column</b> and mean monthly values of eleven grid elements differed very little. Differences were smaller than magnitudes of random error. Average annual values of total <b>ozone</b> <b>column</b> above the territory of Serbia and Montenegro were in the range from 316 Dobson units (DU) in 2002 to 347 DU in 1981. Annual cyclic changes of total <b>ozone</b> <b>column</b> showed spring maxima and autumn minima. Maximal recorded monthly value was 421 DU in March 1987 and minimal monthly value was 271 DU in October 2001. There was a trend of decreasing total <b>ozone</b> <b>column</b> values in the period between 1979 and 1992 at the rate of approximately 4. 5 % per decade. Conclusion: Mean total <b>ozone</b> <b>column</b> value above the territory of Serbia and Montenegro can represent total <b>ozone</b> <b>column</b> for the whole territory. Annual cycles with spring maxima and autumn minima are in accordance with oscillations observed for middle northern latitudes. The trend showing 4. 5 % decrease per decade in the period between 1979 and 1992 corresponds well to trends calculated for comparable locations...|$|E

40|$|Tropospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>columns</b> are {{retrieved}} {{using the}} convective cloud differential (CCD) method from GOME_ 2 /MetOp-A as operational products within the O 3 M-SAF project. This algorithm is also adapted to other sensors like GOME/ERS- 2 or SCIAMACHY/Envisat. The data from these three European satellites are combined {{with data from}} OMI/AURA to a 21 years time series. Based on this time series trends in tropical tropospheric ozone can be determined. However, the CCD method {{is limited to the}} tropics, therefore a different approach is developed to extend the tropospheric ozone data to mid latitudes. Comparable to the OMI-MLS approach a GOME_ 2 -MLS approach was tested, and showed promising results. Besides the CCD results a description of the GOME_ 2 -MLS algorithm as well as a comparison with the well established CCD method and the OMI-MLS product will be presented. Ozone sondes are the standard tool for validating tropospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>columns,</b> here only a short comparison might be given...|$|R

The UK Chemistry and Aerosols (UKCA) {{model is}} a new aerosol-chemistry model coupled to the Met Office Unified Model capable of {{simulating}} composition and cli-mate from the troposphere to the mesosphere. Here we in-troduce the model and assess its performance with a particu-lar focus on the stratosphere. A 20 -year perpetual year- 2000 simulation forms {{the basis of our}} analysis. We assess basic and derived dynamical and chemical model fields and com-pare to ERA- 40 reanalyses and satellite climatologies. Polar temperatures and the lifetime of the southern polar vortex are well captured, indicating that the model is suitable for assessing the ozone hole. Ozone and long-lived tracers com-pare favourably to observations. Chemical-dynamical cou-pling, as evidenced by the anticorrelation between winter-spring northern polar <b>ozone</b> <b>columns</b> and the strength of the polar jet, is also well captured. Remaining problems relate to a warm bias at the tropical tropopause, slow ascent in the tropical pipe with implications for the lifetimes of long-lived species, and a general overestimation of <b>ozone</b> <b>columns</b> in middle and high latitudes. ...|$|R
