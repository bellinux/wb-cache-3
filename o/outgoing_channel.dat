40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a deadlock-free routing in {{irregular}} networks using prefix routing. Prefix routing {{is a special}} type of routing with a compact routing table associated with each node (processor). Basically, each <b>outgoing</b> <b>channel</b> of a node is assigned a special label and an <b>outgoing</b> <b>channel</b> is selected if its label is a prefix of the label of the destination node. Node and channel labeling in an irregular network is done through constructing a spanning tree. The routing process follows a two-phase process of going up and then down along the spanning tree, with a possible cross channel (shortcut) between two branches of the tree between two phases. We show that the proposed routing scheme is deadlock- and livelock- free. Possible extensions are also discussed.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} hyperfine interactions on ultracold molecular collisions in magnetic fields, using ^{ 24 }Mg(^ 1 S) + ^{ 14 }NH(^ 3 Sigma^-) as a prototype system. We explore the energy and magnetic field dependence of the cross sections, comparing the results with previous calculations that neglected hyperfine interactions (Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 183201 (2009)). The main effect of hyperfine interactions for spin relaxation cross sections is that the kinetic energy release of the dominant <b>outgoing</b> <b>channels</b> does not reduce to zero at low fields. This results in reduced centrifugal suppression on the cross sections and increased inelastic cross sections at low energy and low field. We also analyze state-to-state cross sections, for various initial states, and show that hyperfine interactions introduce additional mechanisms for spin relaxation. In particular, there are hyperfine-mediated collisions to <b>outgoing</b> <b>channels</b> that are not centrifugally suppressed. However, for Mg+NH these unsuppressed channels make only small contributions to the total cross sections. We consider the implications of our results for sympathetic cooling of NH by Mg and conclude that the ratio of elastic to inelastic cross sections remains high enough for sympathetic cooling to proceed.

Symmetry properties of the quantum graph as well as its spectral statistics depend on the particular choice of permutation matrices, also called connectivity matrices, and can now be easily controlled. The method may find applications in the study of quantum random walks networks and may also prove to be useful in analysing universality in spectral statistics. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A deadlock-free {{multicast}} scheme called prefix multicasting in irregular networks (i. e., networks with irregular topology) is studied. In prefix routing, {{a compact}} routing table {{is associated with}} each node (processor). Basically, each <b>outgoing</b> <b>channel</b> of a node is assigned a special label and an <b>outgoing</b> <b>channel</b> is selected if its label is a prefix of the label of the destination node. Node and channel labelling in an irregular network {{is based on a}} pre-defined spanning tree {{which may or may not}} be minimum. The routing process follows a two-phase process of going up and then down along the spanning tree, with a possible cross channel between two branches of the tree between two phases. It is shown that the proposed routing scheme is deadlock- and livelock-free. The approach is extended to multicasting in which the multicast packet is first forwarded up the tree to the longest common prefix (LCP) of destinations in the multicast. The packet is then treated as a multi-head worm that can split at branches of the spanning tree as the packet is sent down the tree...|$|E

It also enables the two end nodes to estimate the two effective channels between themselves (i.e., the link from one end node through the relay to the other end node and the same link but in the opposite direction). Most importantly, it enables the two end nodes to cancel their self-interference.|$|R

In this work we show that both methods are fully equivalent, and the full information contained in the three-body wave function is actually preserved in the discrete spectrum.

Closed-form expressions are obtained for the two important cases of exponentially distributed burst sizes and deterministic burst sizes. The performance of asynchronous optical buers shows the same characteristics as that of synchronous optical buers: a reduction in throughput due to the creation of voids on the <b>outgoing</b> <b>channel</b> and a burst loss probability that is strongly in uenced by the choice of ber delay line granularity.

30|$|The {{ability of}} peers to share {{channels}} is implemented {{on the basis}} of available uplink bandwidth using time-dependent coefficients. Constraints are taken into account in the VoD service framework in which P 2 P VoD streaming could saturate the available uplink bandwidth of each peer. Audio and video encoded bit-streams consume significant network resources (primarily bandwidth); the most commonly encountered issues related to multimedia transmission and streaming applications are an unreliable internet connection and heterogeneous bandwidth among various end users [36]. When the network bandwidth fluctuates, the coded bit-rate does not necessarily match the real bandwidth. Hence, scalable video coding (SVC) techniques are often used to provide real-time quality adaptation for streaming systems. Hence, we assume that the number of peers and the quality of video delivered to the audience-peers is constrained by the <b>outgoing</b> <b>channel</b> (uplink bandwidth) capacity of sharing peers.|$|E
