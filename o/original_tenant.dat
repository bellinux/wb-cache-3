5|$|The US$1 million ($ million today) {{project was}} {{initiated}} by Pittsburgh Pirates' owner Barney Dreyfuss, {{with the goal}} of replacing his franchise's then-current home, Exposition Park. The stadium was made of concrete and steel (one of the first of its kind) in order to increase its lifespan. The Pirates opened Forbes Field on June 30, 1909, against the Chicago Cubs, and would play the final game that was also against the Cubs on June 28, 1970. The field itself featured a large playing surface, with the batting cage placed in the deepest part of center field during games. Seating was altered multiple times throughout the stadium's life; at times fans were permitted to sit on the grass in the outfield during overflow crowds. The Pirates won three World Series while at Forbes Field and the other <b>original</b> <b>tenant,</b> the Pittsburgh Panthers football team had five undefeated seasons before moving in 1924.|$|E
25|$|Estates in land {{could be}} alienated (that is, their title could be {{transferred}} to others) in two ways. Substitution meant that the purchaser would take the estate with the same tenures and held from the same lord as the <b>original</b> <b>tenant.</b> Subinfeudation meant that the <b>original</b> <b>tenant</b> continued to hold an estate, but that a new estate would be created held of the <b>original</b> <b>tenant</b> and subsidiary to the original estate.|$|E

25|$|Pennsylvania Station {{is named}} for the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR), its builder and <b>original</b> <b>tenant,</b> and shares its name with several {{stations}} in other cities. The current facility is the substantially remodeled underground remnant of a significantly more ornate station building designed by McKim, Mead, and White and completed in 1910. The original Pennsylvania Station was considered a masterpiece of the Beaux-Arts style, but was demolished in 1963. The station was moved fully underground, beneath the newly constructed Pennsylvania Plaza complex and Madison Square Garden arena completed in 1968.|$|E

25|$|The <b>original</b> <b>tenant</b> of {{the oval}} was the North Melbourne Cricket Club. The cricket club first started playing at the ground in 1868. The cricket club began to share the oval with the {{football}} club in 1882, with the football club using the oval in winter, and the cricket club using the oval in the summer. Historically this arrangement has been difficult and the North Melbourne cricket and football clubs have not got along. In 2007, the cricket club moved its First and Second XIs playing base to J. J. Holland Park in neighbouring Kensington, but its Third and Fourth XIs remained at Arden Street; the club left Arden Street altogether in 2010, playing and training nomadically at Holland Park, Albert Park and Royal Park {{for a couple of}} years before moving permanently to the outer north-western suburb of Greenvale in 2013.|$|E
25|$|Jack Brod, the {{building}}'s longest-lasting <b>original</b> <b>tenant,</b> co-established the Empire Diamond Corporation {{with his}} father in the building in mid-1931 and rented space in the building until he died in 2008. Brod later recalled that there were only about 20 tenants {{at the time of}} opening, including him, and that Al Smith was the only real tenant in the space above his seventh-floor offices. Generally, during the early 1930s, it was rare for an entity to rent more than a single office in the building, despite Smith's and Raskob's aggressive marketing efforts in the newspapers and to anyone they knew. The building's lights were continuously left on, even in the unrented spaces, to give the impression of occupancy. This was exacerbated by competition from the Rockefeller Center as well as from buildings on 42nd Street, which, when combined with the Empire State Building, provided excessive space in a slow market.|$|E
25|$|Presented {{as having}} sparse and more old {{fashioned}} furnishings, the Old House {{is presented as}} being occupied in the upper story only, consisting of a main room used as the kitchen, bedroom and for washing, with the only other rooms being an adjoining second bedroom and an overhanging toilet. The main bed is an oak box bed dating to 1712, obtained from Star House in Baldersdale in 1962. Originally a defensive house in its own right, the lower level of the Old House is an undercroft, or vaulted basement chamber, with 1.5 metre thick walls - in times of attack the <b>original</b> <b>tenant</b> family would have retreated here with their valuables, although in its later use as the farm managers house, it is now presented as a storage and work room, housing a large wooden cheese press. More children would have slept in the attic of the Old House (not accessible as a display).|$|E

2500|$|Irven [...] "Jack" [...] Brod (November 29, 1909 [...] January 6, 2008) was an American {{businessman}} and innovator. He was the President of Empire Diamond and Gold Buying Service, currently a successful New York City-based jewellery business, which he established {{with his father}} in the Empire State Building two months after its opening in 1931. Brod was a tenant of the Empire State Building for around seventy-seven years, and was the last remaining <b>original</b> <b>tenant</b> {{at the time of}} his death.|$|E
2500|$|After MIT's move to Cambridge in 1916, the {{original}} Rogers and Walker buildings were eventually torn down in 1939 {{to make way}} for the New England Mutual Life Insurance Company building. Their sibling structure, the Natural History Society building, has survived to the present day by hosting a succession of retail stores after its <b>original</b> <b>tenant</b> moved to the current location of the Museum of Science Boston in 1951. The city block that originally contained the Engineering Annexes is now the site where the John Hancock Tower stands. [...] Thus, very few physical traces from MIT when it was [...] "Boston Tech" [...] remain in place in their original locations.|$|E

2500|$|The Department of the Navy was the <b>original</b> <b>tenant</b> of the Forrestal Building. [...] This {{changed in}} 1977 after the {{creation}} of the Department of Energy (DOE). [...] The new agency began operations on October 1, 1977. [...] A large number of federal agencies, bureaus, and other organizations were brought together into a single cabinet-level department. [...] These included large agencies such as the Federal Energy Administration (which collected data on energy resources and energy use), the Energy Research and Development Administration (which oversaw the development and testing of the nation's nuclear weapons), the Federal Power Commission (which regulated hydroelectric projects, interstate electric utilities, and the natural gas industry), and programs of various other agencies.|$|E
2500|$|Known as a {{skillful}} businessman, Welk had investments {{in real estate}} and music publishing. He was the general partner in a commercial real estate development at 100 Wilshire Boulevard in Santa Monica, California. The 21-story white tower, located on the bluffs overlooking Santa Monica Bay at Ocean Avenue, is the tallest building in Santa Monica. It was a joint venture with the engineering firm Daniel, Mann, Johnson & Mendenhall. Its largest <b>original</b> <b>tenant</b> was GTE, now Verizon. Welk also owned the adjacent 16-story luxury apartment building at 1221 Ocean Avenue, The [...] "Lawrence Welk Champagne Towers", and Welk made his personal residence in the complex. He built the adjacent 11-story Wilshire Palisades office building at 1299 Ocean Avenue, at Arizona Street.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 21st century, downtown Silver Spring began to see the results of redevelopment. Several city blocks near City Place Mall were completely reconstructed to accommodate a new outdoor shopping plaza called [...] "Downtown Silver Spring." [...] New shops included national retail chains such as Whole Foods Market, a 20-screen Regal Theatres, Men's Wearhouse, Ann Taylor Loft, DSW Shoe Warehouse, Office Depot, and the now-closed Pier 1 Imports, as well as many restaurants, including Panera Bread, Red Lobster, Cold Stone Creamery, Fuddruckers, Potbelly Sandwich Works, Nando's Peri-Peri, and Chick-fil-a. A Borders book store was a popular spot until it closed when the chain went out of business; it was replaced by H. In addition to these chains, Downtown Silver Spring is home {{to a wide variety of}} family-owned restaurants representing its vast ethnic diversity. As downtown Silver Spring revived, its 160-year history was celebrated in a PBS documentary entitled Silver Spring: Story of an American Suburb, released in 2002. In 2003, Discovery Communications completed the construction of its headquarters and relocated to downtown Silver Spring from nearby Bethesda. The same year also brought the reopening of the Silver Theatre, as AFI Silver, under the auspices of the American Film Institute. Development continues with the opening of new office buildings, condos, stores, and restaurants. In 2015-16, the long-struggling City Place Mall underwent a complete renovation, had its name changed to Ellsworth Place, and brought in new tenants, including TJ Maxx, Ross Dress for Less (a re-opening <b>original</b> <b>tenant),</b> Michaels, Forever 21, and Dave & Buster's. The restoration of the old B Passenger Station was undertaken between 2000 and 2002, as recorded in the documentary film [...] In 2005 Downtown Silver Spring was awarded the Rudy Bruner Award for Urban Excellence silver medal.|$|E

6000|$|Beyond {{the town}} {{they were brought}} by their guide to a walled garden, and halted at a gateway. Beyond this could be seen a fair white house set in the {{foreground}} of the vineyards that rose in terraces up the hillside until they were lost from sight in the lowering veils of mist. Carved on the granite lintel of that gateway, the lieutenant beheld the inscription, [...] "BARTHOLOMEU BEARSLEY, 1744," [...] and knew himself at his destination, {{at the gates of}} the son or grandson--he knew not which, nor cared--of the <b>original</b> <b>tenant</b> of that wine farm.|$|E

40|$|Describes {{the impact}} of the English Landlord and Tenant (Covenants) Act 1995, {{reforming}} liability in the context of new leases, extending the 'touching and concerning' requirement so all covenants 'run with the land' (with some exceptions), and abolishing the enduring liability of the <b>original</b> <b>tenants</b> and landlords. Explains that landlords will have more freedom to prescribe in advance the circumstances in which they consent to an assignment, referring also to changes in default notices requiring an 'early warning' to defaulters, and overriding leases, with a remedy for former tenants. Expects future leases to be shorter as landlords realize they cannot hold <b>original</b> <b>tenants</b> liable any more...|$|R
