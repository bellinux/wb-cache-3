5|$|Some of the {{locomotives}} had additional embellishments. No. 34050 Royal Observer Corps {{was presented}} with an ROC long-service medal in July 1961. The ceremony took place at Waterloo station, and included Commandant ROC Air Commodore Wight-Boycott. The cab side was given {{a representation of the}} medal and its ribbon, which was displayed until the engine was withdrawn from service and scrapped in the late 1960s. The original nameplate and crest were recovered and displayed in the entrance hall of ROC Headquarters at RAF Bentley Priory until 1996 when they were transferred to the RAF Museum at Hendon. Another locomotive that featured a second crest was 34067 Tangmere, which was given the airfield's crest for the cab side, as it did not feature <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>nameplate</b> crest.|$|E
500|$|A {{new design}} of {{nameplate}} was created, featuring a circular {{plate with a}} smaller circle in the centre. The inner circle carried the colours of the shipping company on a stylised flag, on an air force blue background. [...] Around the outer circle {{was the name of}} the locomotive, picked out in gilt lettering. [...] A horizontal rectangular plate was attached to either side of the circular nameplate, with [...] "Merchant Navy Class" [...] in gilt lettering. [...] This acted as a class plate, as indicated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>nameplate</b> photograph, above left.|$|E
500|$|Designer Nomura {{said that}} he wanted Tidus' {{clothing}} and accessories to suggest {{a relationship with the}} sea. Tidus' clothing has a distinctive blue motif; his blitzball team logo, based on a fish hook, is an amalgam of the letters [...] "J" [...] and [...] "T" [...] (the first letters of Tidus' name and that of his father, Jecht). Because a player can change Tidus' name, the character is not referred to by name in audible dialogue; however, a character in Dream Zanarkand uses Tidus' name in a dialogue box. The only other in-game appearance of his name is [...] "Tidu" [...] in Spiran script <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>nameplate</b> of an Auroch locker in the Luca stadium. Before Final Fantasy Xs release, Tidus was known to the media as Tida. In early 2001, PlayOnline changed the character's name to [...] "Tidus". Because his name is never spoken in Final Fantasy X, its intended pronunciation has been debated. Interviews with James Arnold Taylor and spoken dialogue in the English versions of Dissidia Final Fantasy, Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy, and Kingdom Hearts (with cameo appearances by the character) indicate that it is pronounced [...] (...) in the English version of Kingdom Hearts II, Tidus' name is pronounced [...] (...) [...] According to Taylor, it was pronounced (...) during the localization of Final Fantasy X because the narrator of an early English trailer pronounced it that way.|$|E
5000|$|... 5305, {{restored}} to original LMS livery was steamed again in 1976. In 1984, 5305 was named Alderman A E Draper by the Mayor of Hedon, Bill Tong. A.E. Draper was twice Mayor of Hedon and the Hedon {{coat of arms}} is <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>nameplates.</b> However, for reasons of authenticity, the engine does not always carry these nameplates.|$|R
2500|$|The San Diego Chargers {{introduced}} some {{relatively minor}} uniform alterations. The most noticeable {{change is the}} switch to [...] "self-color" [...] collars (where the collars match the jersey body) from the previous contrasting color [...] "neck roll" [...] collar design. There were also some changes to <b>the</b> colors used <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>nameplates</b> {{as well as some}} changes to the socks. The pants and helmets remain unchanged.|$|R
50|$|Despite these efforts, CNC {{closed the}} Enterprise-Sun in September 1995, reassigning its {{staff to the}} Middlesex News and the new weeklies. Today the daily newspapers' names survive <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>nameplates</b> of weeklies {{published}} from CNC's Marlborough office, but most Marlborough and Hudson crime and political news appears first in The MetroWest Daily News, which shares an office and some staff with the weeklies, and publishes a separate edition for the Marlborough area.|$|R

50|$|In 2008 it {{was sold}} to the Dartmouth Steam Railway. The {{locomotive}} was then painted in lined GWR Brunswick Green livery. On 1 August 2008 it was named Hercules, <b>the</b> <b>nameplates</b> being located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> smokebox. <b>The</b> <b>nameplates</b> are historically inauthentic for this locomotive.|$|R
50|$|Over its {{production}} life, the chassis and underpinnings of the Ranger {{would be used}} for various compact Ford trucks, most commonly as sport-utility vehicles. During the 1990s and 2000s, Mazda adopted a badge-engineered version of Ranger, taking <b>on</b> <b>the</b> B-Series <b>nameplate</b> (<b>the</b> reverse of the Ford Courier produced by Mazda).|$|R
5000|$|The L-Series was {{produced}} in the Kentucky Truck Plant near Louisville, Kentucky, which {{gave rise to the}} nickname [...] "Louisville Line" [...] trucks; as part of a 1996 redesign, part of the model line officially took <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Louisville <b>nameplate.</b>|$|R
50|$|The badge appears <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>nameplate</b> of the LNER Peppercorn Class A1 60163 Tornado steam {{locomotive}} that was named by HRH The Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall on 19 February 2009.|$|E

50|$|While {{the basic}} shape {{remained}} the same, the bodies increased with size over time. The C22 and C220 models {{were aimed at}} amateurs and had fewer features, but were also lighter than the C33 and C330 models. Two models were made with Mamiyaflex <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>nameplate</b> attached to the viewfinder.|$|E
5000|$|A {{machine is}} {{designed}} to operate at some particular condition, often stated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> device's <b>nameplate.</b> For example, a pump {{is designed to}} deliver its nominal pressure and flow while operating at its nominal speed and power. Actual operating conditions may vary.|$|R
50|$|This station (formerly named L'Assomption, a name still seen <b>on</b> <b>the</b> station's <b>nameplates)</b> {{is named}} for boul. de l'Assomption, so named in 1951 to commemorate Pope Pius XII's {{confirmation}} of the dogma of the Assumption of Mary in his 1950 apostolic constitution Munificentissimus Deus.|$|R
2500|$|Riyad Mansour, {{the head}} of the Palestinian UN {{observer}} mission, then wrote a letter requesting <b>the</b> name change <b>on</b> 12 December. <b>On</b> 17 December, <b>the</b> UN head of official protocol, Yeocheol Yoon, replied that the request is accepted, and that henceforth the designation of [...] "State of Palestine" [...] shall be used by the Secretariat in all official United Nations documents and the title of the Palestinian mission.

50|$|City {{construction}} permit {{records show that}} Mendelson spent hundreds of thousands on renovations, not including amenities such as new furniture or improvements that didn't require permits. Mendelson said he invested millions in the hotel. The results showed, notably in the hotel's dining room and ballrooms. Preservation organizations gave awards to Mendelson. The hotel further bolstered its image in 1988 by taking <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>nameplate</b> of the Radisson Hotel chain.|$|E
5000|$|After {{that final}} disaster, the {{audience}} discovers {{the reason for}} the catapult's [...] "artificial intelligence."

[...] The Road Runner <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>nameplate</b> gives the audience a [...] "Beep-Beep" [...] and then zooms off.|$|E
50|$|The Williamsport Sun-Gazette {{was founded}} in 1801 as the Lycoming Gazette. At {{the time of the}} newspaper's conception, there were only 131 {{residents}} in the town of Williamsport, Pennsylvania. The newspaper was started in a building in what is now the vicinity of Penn Street and Washington Boulevard. The Gazette name has been <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>nameplate</b> and masthead of a newspaper in Williamsport continuously since that time. The Sun-Gazette is the oldest continuously operating enterprise in the West Branch Valley.|$|E
5000|$|To show {{compliance}} {{with these new}} efficiency standards, motors must be tested {{in accordance with the}} newly adopted IEC 60034-2-1 testing protocol. This procedure provides test results that are largely compatible with those obtained by the North American IEEE 112B and CSA 390 test methods. The new standard also requires that the motor efficiency class and nominal motor efficiency be labeled <b>on</b> <b>the</b> motor <b>nameplate</b> and given in product literature and motor catalogues in the following format: ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to improve the control quality of the DC drive system based <b>on</b> Arduino platform. <b>The</b> <b>nameplate</b> DC motor data are useful to provide the DC motor parameters. The cascade control loops provides good dynamic performances for the DC drive system. By using an adequate electric generator, the DC motor is loaded appropriately. Compared to the conventional control methods, in order to improve the load torque disturbances, this paper introduces feedforward load control loop. The simulation and experimental results are shown in this paper...|$|R
5000|$|The minimum design metal {{temperature}} (MDMT) {{is one of}} {{the design}} conditions for pressure vessels engineering calculations, design and manufacturing according to the ASME Boilers and Pressure Vessels Code. Each pressure vessel that conforms to the ASME code has its own MDMT, and this temperature is stamped <b>on</b> <b>the</b> vessel <b>nameplate.</b> <b>The</b> precise definition can sometimes be a little elaborate, but in simple terms the MDMT is a temperature arbitrarily selected by the user of the vessel according to the type of fluid and the temperature range the vessel is going to handle. The so-called arbitrary MDMT must be lower than or equal to the CET (which is an environmental or [...] "process" [...] property, see below) and must be higher than or equal to the (MDMT)M (which is a material property).|$|R

5000|$|Since then, Wapner has stated, [...] "She is {{a disgrace}} to the profession. She does things I don't think a judge should do. She tells people to shut up. She's rude. She's arrogant. She demeans people. If she does this on purpose, then that's even worse. Judges need to observe certain {{standards}} of conduct. She just doesn't do it and I resent that. The public is apt to gain the impression that this is how actual judges conduct themselves. It says judge <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>nameplate</b> {{on the bench and}} she's wearing a robe." ...|$|E
50|$|The School lent {{its name}} to the thirty third steam {{locomotive}} (Engine 932) in the Southern Railway's Class V of which there were 40. This Class was also known as the Schools Class because all 40 of the class were named after prominent English public schools. Blundell's, as it was called, was built in 1934. The locomotive bearing the School's name was withdrawn from service in January 1961. In 2009 Hornby produced a model of this particular Schools class locomotive. As the product photograph shows, while the name of this locomotive has been variously quoted as Blundells or Blundell's the apostrophe does actually appear <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>nameplate.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The Ford Reflex (or REFL3X, as spelled <b>on</b> <b>the</b> vehicle <b>nameplate)</b> is {{a concept}} car {{introduced}} at the 2006 North American International Auto Show that, according to Ford, [...] "proves small cars can be bold and American". It is a technological showcase that includes solar panel-powered headlights, integrated child seat, baby cam with a monitor mounted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dash, inflatable rear safety belts, and an interior quieted by ground rubber taken from Nike athletic shoe outsoles. A production version of the Reflex design {{has not yet been}} announced. It features an advanced diesel-electric hybrid engine with new-generation lithium ion batteries that help deliver up to 65 mpg of diesel fuel, and can accelerate the vehicle from 0 to 60 mi/h km/h in 7 seconds.|$|R

50|$|Katakura applied hiragana {{transcription}} {{when she}} got married and changed her family name to Katakura. A fortune teller advised Katakura {{that there were no}} problem to apply kanji to both her first and maiden name, or Motoko Aratani. However, the combination of both her first name and married name in kanji did not show good omen. Based on that advice, she transcribed her first name in kana rather than in kanji. On the first day at the National Museum of Ethnology as a professor, it was not quite comfortable for her to find her name inscribed in kanji only <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>nameplate</b> to her office, as she confessed in her essay.|$|E
50|$|SpinRite was {{originally}} written as {{a hard drive}} interleave tool. At the time SpinRite was designed, hard drives often had a defect list printed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>nameplate,</b> listing known bad sectors discovered at the factory. In changing the drive's interleave, SpinRite needed {{to be able to}} remap these physical defects into different logical sectors. SpinRite therefore gained its data recovery and testing capabilities as a side-effect of its original purpose. Gibson states that today, drive interleave is no longer an issue, but the data recovery features of the tool proved to be so useful that it evolved into the data recovery tool that it is today.|$|E
