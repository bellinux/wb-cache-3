5|$|Lead and tin: high density; {{extremely}} close dimensional accuracy; used for special forms of corrosion resistance. Such alloys {{are not used}} in foodservice applications for public health reasons. Type metal, an alloy of lead, tin and antimony (with sometimes traces of copper) is used for casting hand-set type in letterpress printing and hot foil blocking. Traditionally cast in hand jerk moulds now predominantly die cast after the industrialisation of the type foundries. Around 1900 the slug casting machines came onto the market and added further automation, with sometimes dozens of casting machines at <b>one</b> <b>newspaper</b> office.|$|E
5|$|Promoted {{to flight}} lieutenant, from July 1935 to November 1937 Balmer was {{assigned}} to No.1 Flying Training School, Point Cook, as an instructor.

On 15August 1938, Balmer was forced to crash land an Avro Anson near Whitfield, Victoria, after its wings iced up—one of a series of accidents that befell the type following its introduction to Australian service. By mid-1939 he was instructing on Hawker Demon biplane fighters with No.3 Squadron at RAAF Station Richmond, New South Wales.|$|E

When the reporters arrive at the coast, they are disappointed {{at the lack of}} damage, which is confined to loose boards along the boardwalk.

5|$|The added {{height of}} the spire allowed the Chrysler Building to surpass 40 Wall Street as the tallest {{building}} {{in the world and}} the Eiffel Tower as the tallest structure. The Chrysler Building was thus the first man-made structure to be taller than , and as <b>one</b> <b>newspaper</b> noted, the tower was also taller than the highest points of five states. The new Chrysler Building, appraised at $14 million, was also exempt from city taxes as per an 1859 law that gave tax exemptions to sites owned by the Cooper Union. Although the city had attempted to repeal the tax exemption, Cooper Union opposed that measure, and because the Chrysler Building retains the tax exemption, it has paid Cooper Union for the use of their land since opening.|$|E
5|$|On {{its first}} landfall, the {{tropical}} storm buffeted the eastern-central Philippines with damaging winds gusting up to 160km/h (100mph), heavy rainfall, and rough seas. At least 20 provinces experienced adverse or dangerous weather, {{with the worst}} conditions concentrated over the islands of Samar and Masbate. While structural and crop damages were limited, local infrastructure and transportation suffered the greatest. Nepartak's winds caused complete power outages on Samar, Masbate, and nearby Marinduque, affecting their entire collective population of nearly four million individuals. Many schools were closed. The storm forced the cancellation of nearly two dozen domestic flights {{to and from the}} region, and at least 120 ferries and other vessels sought shelter in ports around the Manila, Bicol, and Visayas regions. On those ships were more than 5,000 people who became stranded until safe passage could be made. By November 15, five deaths had been confirmed in the Philippines, four the result of electrocutions from downed powerlines. Immediately following the disaster, then-President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo made assisting the stranded passengers in coastal ports a priority. According to the PAGASA in its post-storm report, a total of 13 people lost their lives, 5 others remained unaccounted for, and 11 sustained injuries. <b>One</b> <b>newspaper</b> reported that a motorized craft in the Tañon Strait capsized {{at the height of the}} storm, forcing the rescue of 11 people. Another source also describes the sinking of a boat with at least 13 survivors and one fatality. It is not clear whether these accounts cover the same incident.|$|E
