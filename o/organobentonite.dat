In this work, we evaluated the ability of two bentonites (SWy- 2 and SAz- 1) exchanged with four natural organic cations containing diverse functional groups (L-carnitine, L-cysteine ethyl ester, L-cystine dimethyl ester, and thiamine) as adsorbents of pesticides varying in their chemical structures (simazine, hexazinone, triadimefon, alachlor, carbaryl, and imazethapyr). For comparison purposes, the adsorptive properties of two >classical> <b>organobentonites,</b> hexadecyltrimethylammonium- and phenyltrimethylammonium- exchanged bentonites, were also determined.

40|$|Abstract — The overall {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to study the combined influence of pressure and temperature on the complex viscous behaviour of two oil-based drilling fluids. The oil-based fluids were formulated by dispersing selected <b>organobentonites</b> in mineral oil, using a high-shear mixer, at room temperature. Drilling fluid viscous flow characterization was performed with a controlled-stress rheometer, using both conventional coaxial cylinder and non-conventional geometries for High Pressure/High Temperature (HPHT) measurements.

Yildiz et al.[51] reported the removal of HQ and benzoic acid on synthesized <b>organobentonites</b> (ODTMA-B, HDTMA-B). Zhu et al.[134] and Smith and Grum[135] indicated that the magnitude and mechanism of sorption are functions of the cation-exchange capacity of the clay, the molecular structure of the exchanged organic cation, the extent of cation exchange, and the molecular structure of the solute. Sorption may take place either by partition or by adsorption depending mainly on the characteristics of the exchanged organic cation and the molecular structure of the solute. Adsorption of the large cationic surfactant molecule, CTAB, greatly modifies the nature of the clay surface which may exhibit both hydrophilic and hydrophobic as well as electrostatic properties and van der Waals interaction between the -R group of the surfactant and adsorbate[136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142], and it is also observed that the percentage adsorption increases from 81.5 % to approximately 100 % as the initial adsorbate concentration is reduced from the initial concentration of 88 mg/l. This observed increase in the percentage adsorption is due to the availability of larger sorbent surface sites for a relatively smaller amount of C at lower Co[58].|$|R

Since the d(001) values of the OB samples are between 1. 94 and 3. 36 nm, the pseudotrilayer or paraffin-type alkylammonium configuration located between the 2 : 1 layers of smectites is dominant. The bending and stretching type FTIR bands of the smectite surface and alkylammonium cations (AACs) are evidence {{of the formation of}} the OPN in the OBs. The DTA and TGA curves show that the thermal degradation of the intercalated AACs is completed between 250 and 550 ◦C as H 2 O, CO 2, and charcoal are formed. The number of C atoms in the AACs used during the preparation of the OBs is between 30 and 42, according to EA. Oxidation of charcoal to CO 2 takes place between 550 and 800 ◦C. In the same temperature range, smectite is dehydroxylated to release H 2 O. Decrystallization of smectite occurs near 1000 ◦C by an exothermic reaction and without any mass loss.

Clays are good adsorbents for pesticides. Due to their small size, expansive properties reactive surfaces and modification or “tunning” ability (Hermosin & Cornejo, 1992; Socias-Viciana et al., 1998; Cruz-Guzmán et al., 2005; Gámiz et al., 2015) and thus they have been proposed for water treatment (Beall 2003). In this work we assay and propose clays as adsorbent component in a filter to remove pesticides from water. The modified clays were prepared from a low value clay (CTI, smectite content, 30 %) located in Bailén (Jaen, Spain) by saturation with Fe 3 + (CTI-FE) and hexadecyltrimethyllammonium (CTI-HDTMA). A commercial organo-clay, Cloisite 10 A (Clo, from BKG) was also used for comparison. The pesticides tested re those used in olive crops, as terbuthylazine, tebuconazole and MCPA (Hermosin et a l., 2013). The clays were granulated to pellets with carnauba wax (car) as binder through a ram extruder. Powder clay and car were mixed (30 % wt car) at 90 ºC. Anthracite (Antra 170, AstralPool) was mixed at rate of 40 % with the clay pellets as filtering bed in the tank with artificially contaminated water, Antracite helps to avoid clay swelling and to increase the bed porosity and improve the conditions of the water flow. Experiment set-up has a minimum flow of 30 ml/min to obtain pressures of 1 bar. The adsorption tests were carried out using a solution containing the three pesticides at initial concentration of 1 ppm in 40 liters of water. The adsorption kinetics was measured at selected times (15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 6 h, 8 h, 24 h). This work reveals that the pelletization process did not affect significantly the pesticide sorption capacity of clays (37 - 96 %) and the pellets were not altered in terms of size showing an excellent water resistance {{at the end of the}} experiment. We obtained a high adsorption of the three pesticides tested for the cases of the commercial clay (Clo 10) and for CTI-HDTMA, removing from 40 - 100 % of pesticide from water after 24 h of treatment in the filter system. In contrast, the CTI-Fe sample did not perform as a good adsorbent, removing only between 15 - 42 % of the herbicides from water after 24 h of treatment in the filter. CTI-HDTMA reveals as a very promising adsorbent derived from a low cost material to be used in filter systems for removing pesticides from contaminated waters.

40|$|Modification and {{characterization}} of bentonite from location Bogovina, Serbia {{was performed in}} order to obtain material applicable in wastewater purification. The < 75 μm bentonite fraction was used in <b>organobentonite</b> synthesis while the < 2 μm bentonite fraction, obtained by hydroseparation was used in pillaring procedure. Organo-modification of bentonite was performed with (1 -hexadecyl) trimethylammonium bromide (HDTMA-Br). Pillared bentonite was obtained using standard procedure. Al 3 + and Fe 3 + ions were incorporated in pillars in 4 : 1 ratio and applied as catalyst in catalytic wet peroxide oxidation. Differences in structure of starting and modified bentonites were established by XRD analysis and nitrogen physisorption on - 196 °C. The (001) smectite peak around 2 θ = 6 ° shifts during the modification process. The Na-exchange process lowered d 001 from 1. 53 nm (2 θ = 5. 78 °) for starting clay to 1. 28 nm (2 θ = 6. 92 °), but the clay retained its swelling properties. The pillaring process increased and fixed the basal spacing to 1. 74 nm. Intercalation of HDTMA ions into smectite structure increased d 001 to 2. 00 nm for <b>organobentonite.</b> Specific surface area, SBET, was affected by particle size and type of modification. The samples with finer bentonite fraction had higher SBET due to increased smectite content. Na-exchanged bentonite samples had higher SBET value than starting clay samples of same granulation. Organomodification caused dramatic decrease in SBET value, while the pillaring process lead to an increase of SBET value. Adsorptive and catalytic purification of wastewaters containing dyes was tested using Acid Yellow 99 as a model dye. Na-exchanged bentonite had greater adsorption affinity for dye adsorption than raw bentonite owing to higher SBET. By organomodification this affinity was enhanced more than 70 times due to transition of bentonite surface from hydrophilic to organophilic. Al,Fe pillared bentonite was proven to be efficient in catalytic wet peroxide oxidation of Acid Yellow 99 dye at room temperature...|$|E
40|$|Bentonite {{modified}} {{with short}} chain cationic surfactant {{might be the}} basis of a new approach to removing organic pollutants from water. The treatment process involves dispersing bentonite to the contaminated water and then adding a small cationic surfactant so as to result in flocs which are agglomerates of <b>organobentonite</b> and bound organic pollutants. The flocs are then removed from the solution by sedimentation. Experimental results indicate that BTMA-bentonite displays a high affinity for phenol, possibly because phenol molecules interact favorably with the benzene ring in BTMA ion through increased p 2 p type interactions. Under appropriate operating conditions, 90 % phenol removal and nearly 100 % bentonite recovery could be achieved by the adsorption–flocculation process using BTMA-bentonite. Additionally, the insensitivity of the process to the changing ionic strength of the solution and rapid adsorption kinetics made adsorption–flocculation with BTMA-bentonite attractive for continuous treatment of large volumes of industrial wastewater. The bentonite may function as a recyclable surfactant support for the adsorption and subsequen...|$|E
30|$|An alkyl {{ammonium}} cation with long-chain (CTA+) {{was used}} to widen the gallery spacing between platelets of the Bent, so that PAAs could be grafted into the modified clay. To prepare the CTA–Bent, 20  g natural Bent clay was mixed with 300  mL distilled water and 6  mL of HCl 0.01  M and the mixture was heated to 70  °C. The HCl was added into the clay suspension because acidic environment facilitates the distribution of quaternary ammonium cations inside the gallery spacing of the clays (Shirsath et al. 2011). Then, CTA solution (0.05  mol L− 1) was dispersed into the acidic Bent suspension. The amount of surfactant added was equal to 200  % of the clay CEC. The dispersion was subsequently stirred vigorously for 12  h at 70  °C. The <b>organobentonite</b> was washed repeatedly using hot water until a negative bromide test was obtained with 0.01  M of AgNO 3. The final precipitate was dried in an oven at 80  °C for 24  h followed by grinding and sieving through a 0.05 -mm sieve.|$|E
40|$|In this {{comparative}} study, {{the influence}} of the organophilisation process on the properties of resulting <b>organobentonite</b> fillers and their capability to improve the mechanical properties of clay/polymer nanocomposites were investigated. The organobentonites were obtained by activation with the use of two organic quaternary ammonium salts (QAS) with alkyl chains of significantly different lengths. The organophilisation resulted in an increase in the interlayer space of clays, which was confirmed by XRD analysis. The obtained organofillers were used to produce nanoclay/epoxy resin composites and the effects of alkyl chain length on the resulting properties of composites were compared based on the examination of mechanical behaviour and morphology, and a composite filled with the non organophilised bentonite was used as a reference material. It was demonstrated that the organophilisation process using distearyldimethyl ammonium chloride salt with a longer alkyl chain (C 18 -C 20) created a more superior conditions for the compatibility of nanofiller with a polymer matrix, resulting in a 25 % increase in the bending strength of the epoxy composite material filled with 3 %wt of the organophilised bentonite, comparing to neat epoxy...|$|E
40|$|Organoclays are {{increasingly}} being used to remediate both contaminated soils and waste water. The present study was attempted to elucidate the structural evolution of bentonite based organoclays prepared from a commercially available, low-cost alkyl ammonium surfactant Arquad® 2 HT- 75. XRD, FTIR, SEM and zeta potential measurement were used to characterise the organoclays. In particular, the relationship between surface charge characteristics of the organoclays {{and their ability to}} remediate organic contaminants such as phenol and p-nitrophenol was investigated. The investigation revealed that the arrangement and conformation of surfactant molecules in the bentonite became more regular, ordered and solid-like as of Arquad® 2 HT- 75 loading increased. This also {{led to the formation of}} a positive zeta potential on the surface of organobentonites prepared with 3. 57 : 1 and 4. 75 : 1 surfactant–clay (w/w) ratio. The zeta potential values decreased with increasing pH of the suspension. The adsorption data of phenol and p-nitrophenol were best fitted to Freundlich isotherm model. The adsorption was controlled by multiple mechanisms of partitioning, physico-sorption and chemisorption. The outcomes of this study are useful for the synthesis of low cost <b>organobentonite</b> adsorbents for the remediation of ionisable organic contaminants such as phenol and p-nitrophenol from waste water. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed to}} develop technology and processes to further beneficiate two southern African bentonites for applications in polymer/clay nanotechnology. The bentonites were from the Koppies mine in South Africa, and the Boane mine in Mozambique. The work was divided into two parts: (i) preparation of organomodified nanoparticulate smectite clays, and (ii) preparation of their poly(ethylene-co-vinylacetate) nanocomposites. Nanoparticulate organobentonites were prepared using purified bentonites. The conventional organomodification process uses a very low concentration of bentonites at 80 oC. In this study, a novel method was developed: concentrated slurries of naturally occurring Ca-bentonite partially activated with soda ash {{in the presence of}} a proprietary dispersant were contacted at ambient temperature with quaternary ammonium surfactants. A known amount of bentonite dispersion was placed in a planetary mixer before the mixture. Likewise, a known amount of surfactant, up to 50 % excess, based on the estimated cation exchange capacity (CEC) of the bentonites, was added while mixing the dispersion. The surfactants added were either in solution or in powdered form. The intercalated bentonite was recovered by centrifugation and washed repeatedly with water until halide ions could not be detected using a 1 M silver nitrate solution. The solids were dried at ambient temperature and humidity, and then crushed and milled into a fine powder using a mortar and pestle. Several instrumental techniques were used to characterise and examine the properties of the bentonite samples before and after organic treatment. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) results were consistent with: (i) paraffin-type extended chain intercalation; and (ii) interdigitated monolayer intercalation of the C 12 and C 14 single-chain alkyl surfactants and bilayer intercalation of the single-chain C 16 surfactant and the surfactants with double alkyl chains. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy analysis of the <b>organobentonite</b> powders confirmed disordered chain conformations. XRD also detected significant amounts of cristobalite in the samples of Boane bentonite (from Mozambique). This impurity could not be removed cost-effectively. The onset decomposition temperature ofthe present organobentonites was around 200 ºC, which is within the typical range of polymer/organoclay processing temperatures. The thermal stability of the organobentonites was independent of both the number of alkyl chain substituents and their length, and also independent of the degree of clay intercalation. SURFACTANT INTERCALATED KOPPIES AND BOANE BENTONITES FOR POLYMER NANOTECHNOLOGY ii Poly(ethylene-co-vinylacetate) nanocomposites were prepared with South African Koppies bentonite, organomodified with single-chain C 12 (and polar 2 -hydroxyethyl side chain) and double-chains C 18 alkyl ammonium cationic surfactants. The later surfactant was intercalated both below and above the clay CEC. Nanocomposites were prepared by twin-screw melt compounding. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) indicated the presence of mixed nanoand micron-sized clay morphologies. XRD studies revealed that the crystallinity of the particles improved and that the d-spacing values increased on incorporation of the modified bentonites in the polymer matrix. It is postulated that, rather than indicating polymer co-intercalation, this was caused by further intercalation of either excess surfactants or surfactant residues that were released by shear delamination of the clays during compounding. Improved mechanical properties were realised, especially when using the bentonite containing the longer double-chains surfactant intercalated at levels in excess of the CEC of the clay. The nanocomposites showed improved tensile modulus and elongation at break values at the expense of a reduction in impact strength, while tensile strength was about the same as for the neat polymer.

40|$|The {{volatile}} organic compound (VOCs) can cause great damage to the environment by emission into the atmosphere. By the exchange of organic cations for inorganic cations in the surfaces, the clay minerals can be converted into organo-clays. The mineral surfaces of resulting orgno-clays become hydrophobe, capable of effectively removing organic pollutants. Because of their natural and unique sorption powers, the organo-clays have been investigated {{for a wide variety}} of environmental applications. The VOCs sorption behaviors of organobentonites are much more complex than those of common adsorbents. Therefore, there would be practically useful to explain the relative contributions of the sorption mechanisms, between adsorbents and VOCs, via linear solvation energy relationships (LSER). The aims of the study is to establish a LSER predictive equation, and also to discuss the sorption mechanisms of VOCs with organobentonites. The reactivity descriptors calculated by molecular model, and were based on the density functional theory (DFT) combined with the hard-soft acid-base (HSAB) principle. Calculated parameters will carry on the multi-regression analysis with sorption constant (log Kc). The chemical reaction of organic molecule divided into non-specific effect and specific effect two major parts. Non-specific effect is solvation interaction. Specific effect divided into global and local two parts, and both they subdivided into charge controlled and orbital controlled two parts. The result of multi-regression analysis indicated that the sorption reactions of organobentonites with VOCs are mainly effected by several parameters. these parameters include the polar surface area (PSA) in salvation interaction, the hardness (η) in molecular global interaction, the maximum positive charge (ρ+max(H)) and maximum electrostatic potential (Vmax(H)) in the local charge controlled interaction, and the maximum nucleophilic condensed local softness (s+max) in the local frontier controlled interaction. The sorption mechanism of <b>organobentonite</b> (HDTMA-bentonite) with the {{volatile organic}} compounds mainly are partition (hydrophobe), the Van der Waals force, and the hydrogen bond. Negative charges in the mineral interlayer would infect the sorption of organic compounds. Finally the optimum prediction equation was obtained. Although the square of correlation coefficient (R 2) is lower, the equation can analyse the reaction mechanism by electrons redistribution in molecule structure. 揮發性有機化合物(VOCs) 散逸至大氣會對環境造成很大的危害，而黏土礦物可藉由有機陽離子交換黏土礦物表面的無機陽離子，轉變為表面具有疏水性的有機黏粒，能有效移除有機污染物的能力。天然而如此獨特的吸附能力，使得有機黏粒在環境應用方面被廣泛研究。有機膨土對揮發性有機物的吸附行為比一般吸附劑複雜許多，以線性溶合能量關係(LSER) 來說明吸附劑與揮發性有機物的吸附機制的相對貢獻是有益的。 研究以密度泛函理論(DFT) 結合軟硬酸鹼(HSAB) 為理論基礎，由分子模型計算所得的描述參數，與吸附常數作迴歸分析，建立有機膨土對VOCs的LSER預測模式，並探討其吸附機制。有機分子的化學反應分為非特異性影響與特異性影響來討論。非特異性為溶合化反應(solvation) 。特異性分為整體性(global) 與局域性(local) ，又再細分為電荷控制與軌域控制兩個部分。 複因子迴歸分析顯示影響吸附反應的主要參數包含溶劑化作用參數中的極性表面積(PSA) 、分子整體性參數中的硬度(η) 、局域性電荷控制參數中的最正及最負電荷(電勢) 原子，及局域性軌域控制參數中的局域性親電性軟度(s-max) 。而有機黏粒(HDTMA-膨土) 吸附揮發性有機分子的機制，主要是以分配作用(疏水性) 、凡得瓦力及氫鍵等較弱作用力為主。而層間的負電荷仍影響對有機分子的吸附。最後得到的最佳預測方程式，雖然預測性較低，但可以由分子內局域電荷的變化來解釋反應機制，也可以快速的了解複雜系統中的反應機制及解釋反應現象，甚至可用來作為實驗預測，使化學不再只是純粹的實驗科學。目錄 摘要	I Abstract	II 圖目錄	VI 表目錄	VII 第一章 緒論	 1 1 - 1 	研究動機	 1 1 - 2 研究目的	 1 第二章	背景簡介與文獻回顧	 3 2 - 1 揮發性有機物 (Volatile Organic Compounds, VOCs) 	 3 2 - 2 黏土礦物-膨土	 3 2 - 3 界面活性劑 (surfactant) 	 4 2 - 4 黏粒之修飾	 5 2 - 5 有機黏粒 (Organo-clay) 	 5 2 - 6 吸附行為	 11 2 - 6 - 1 物理吸附	 11 2 - 6 - 2 化學吸附	 12 2 - 6 - 3 吸附平衡常數（equilibrium adsorption coefficient）	 12 2 - 7 線性溶合能量關係方程式	 13 2 - 8 計算化學 (Computational chemistry) 	 16 2 - 9 從頭算方法 (Ab initio methods) 	 17 2 - 9 - 1 Hartree-Fock方程式	 17 2 - 9 - 2 HFR方程	 18 2 - 9 - 3 RHF方程	 19 2 - 9 - 4 UHF方程	 19 2 - 9 - 5 密度泛函理論 (Density functional theory) 	 20 2 - 10 計算軟體	 21 2 - 11 軟硬酸鹼理論（Hard-Soft-Acid-Base theory）	 22 2 - 12 密度泛函理論與軟硬酸鹼(HSAB) 結合	 23 2 - 13 福井函數 (fukui function) 	 24 第三章 計算方法	 26 3 - 1 分子結構計算	 26 3 - 2 得失電子計算	 29 第四章 結果與討論	 31 4 - 1 建立以密度泛函為基礎的線性自由能關係	 31 4 - 1 - 1 溶劑化作用參數 (solvation parameter) 	 32 4 - 1 - 2 整體性參數 (global parameter) 	 32 4 - 1 - 3 局域性參數 (local paratemer) 	 33 4 - 2 以HF法計算之參數進行線性溶合能量關係的複因子迴歸結果	 40 4 - 2 - 1 單一參數迴歸	 40 4 - 2 - 2 二參數迴歸	 42 4 - 2 - 3 三參數迴歸	 53 4 - 2 - 4 四參數迴歸	 58 4 - 3 以DFT法計算之參數進行線性溶合能量關係的複因子迴歸結果	 61 4 - 3 - 1 單一參數迴歸	 61 4 - 3 - 2 二參數迴歸	 62 4 - 3 - 3 三參數迴歸	 75 4 - 3 - 4 四參數迴歸	 80 4 - 4 最佳線性溶合能量關係方程式	 83 第五章 結論	 86 參考文獻	 8...|$|E
