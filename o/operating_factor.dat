40|$|Hoteliers’ {{efforts to}} improve the {{environmental}} sustainability of their operations would be promoted by having a consistent industry-wide measure for benchmarking current operations and tracking the effect of environmental sustainability initiatives. This type of measure can also assist external stakeholders, such as the hotel guests and regulatory entities, to gauge hotels’ environmental sustainability efforts. This report presents the results of an exploratory study that develops such a measure, using resource consumption records of 984 U. S. hotels over a period of eight years. The measure is based on an analysis of resource consumption–related expenses found in these hotels’ year-end operating statements, for electricity, water and sewer, maintenance other expenses, and laundry, linen, and supplies for both the rooms and for food and beverage services. Using a multivariate data analysis technique called exploratory factor analysis, the measure developed in the study consists of two parts: an <b>operating</b> <b>factor</b> that comprises large weights from electricity, water and sewer, and maintenance expenses, and a behavioral factor, which is largely driven by laundry, linen, and supplies for both rooms and F 2 ̆ 6 B operations. In general, costs found in the <b>operating</b> <b>factor</b> are under management control, but the costs in the behavioral factor are subject to guests’ activities. By normalizing the average of each of these two factors at zero, hotels that score above zero on each factor are spending more than other hotels, and those with a score below zero are more efficient than others. These factors can be compared according to various hotel characteristics, such as chain segment, the involvement of a third-party professional management company in the operating structure, location (both in terms of the degree of urbanization and climate zone), and whether the hotel offers F 2 ̆ 6 B service.

40|$|A {{successful}} career in {{football is the}} result of the appropriate interaction between different aspects of an individual’s life, since the various areas and phases of one’s life depend on each other. An endogenous causal relationship exists throughout a person’s entire history (Mayer, 1990). In particular, their family, work and sports career must be tuned to each other. The transition from the initial stages of education (compulsory schooling) to vocational training, which coincides with the beginning of the selection for the national youth teams, is a particularly critical phase (Wylleman, Theeboom, & Lavallee, 2004). In order to do justice to the overall life situation of a young sports talent during this transition phase, we have adopted a holistic perspective and follow Bergman, Magnusson and El-Khouri (2003) in using a person-oriented and systemic approach. In doing so, our main focus lies on the person-environment system. This overall system is made up of various subsystems, consisting of several <b>operating</b> <b>factors</b> which interact with one another. The different levels to which these <b>operating</b> <b>factors</b> are expressed lead to observable patterns, which can be summarised in the form of types. Particularly promising types can therefore be identified and the developmental process can be described. Former players on the Swiss U 16 to U 21 national football teams, born between 1981 and 1987 (n= 159), were interviewed concerning their careers, and the <b>operating</b> <b>factors</b> school/vocational training, family support and sports environment were examined.

This study was performed to detect NDM- 1 in Enterobacteriaceae and to determine the clonal relatedness of NDM- 1 producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from patients admitted in a tertiary care centre. Materials and Methods: A total of 111 clinically significant Enterobacteriaceae isolates, resistant to cephalosporin subclass III were screened for carbapenemase production by the modified Hodge test. Minimum inhibitory concentration to imipenem and meropenem was determined and interpreted according to Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute 2011 criteria. Presence of bla NDM- 1 was detected by polymerase chain reaction. To ascertain clonal relatedness, random amplification of polymorphic deoxyribonucleic acid (RAPD) was carried out for representative NDM- 1 producers. Results : bla NDM- 1 was detected in 64 study isolates, of which 27 were susceptible to carbapenems. RAPD revealed a high degree of clonal diversity among NDM- 1 producers except for a small clustering of isolates in the neonatal intensive care unit. Conclusion: There is extensive clonal diversity among the NDM- 1 producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae. Hence, antibiotic selection pressure rather than horizontal transfer is probably an important <b>operating</b> <b>factor</b> for the emergence of NDM- 1.

40|$|Background. The Marilao, Meycauayan and Obando river system (MMORS), in the Philippines {{is home to}} many {{precious}} metals refineries, where local artisanal gold smelting industries use silver to draw gold out of used jewelry. Copper recovers the silver. The copper-rich wastewater contributes to local pollution. Alternative methods for silver recovery include electrolytic recovery: removal of silver ions from solution, and conversion of the ions into metallic silver. Objectives. Explore operation and scale-up for the electrolytic recovery of silver for small-to-medium-scale used gold smelting plants. Methods. Effects of current and time were investigated in a laboratory scale, magnetically-stirred electrolysis reactor, using a sintered platinum anode and a stainless steel cathode. Silver recovery (the removal of silver ions from solution) was evaluated {{at different levels of}} constant operating current, and data was used to determine charge dose as the scale up and <b>operating</b> <b>factor.</b> Charge dose was then used to obtain the operating conditions on a pilot scale (100 L) system. A preliminary pilot test assessed silver recovery performance. Results. Higher silver removal rates were noted at higher operating currents. Electrodeposition at 9 amperes showed 98. 7 % silver recovery after 30 mins. The charge dose for silver electrodeposition was 1. 23 coulombs/mg silver ions removed, while the average electrolysis energy requirement was about 0. 59 kilowatt hours/kg of silver removed. Conclusions. Preliminary comparisons on a 100 -liter scale, showed the electrolytic process had a higher silver removal (~ 90 %) compared to copper displacement (~ 65 %).

40|$|Smallholder tree {{cultivation}} {{and management}} {{is a common}} form of land-use in high potential areas of Kenya. Some practices, such as the planting of trees on field boundaries are strongly rooted in customary notions of land and tree tenure. Others, such as the planting of black wattle (Acacia mearnsii) woodlots, are more recent innovations, introduced to produce commodities for domestic and export markets. This thesis explores the historic, cultural, and economic dimensions of tree growing in Kenya, using archival and ethnographic data, land-use surveys, and results from a survey of 123 households in the upper coffee/lower tea zone of Murang'a District. The household survey was designed to explore the hypothesis that tree growing complements formal employment as a strategy for overcoming poorly <b>operating</b> <b>factor</b> markets and helps to ease land-use constraints imposed by labour migration. Tree planting is favored because of its low capital and recurrent costs and when farmers are unable to plant other more resource-intensive crops. The survey focused on households which currently maintain a black wattle woodlot and on households which operate parcels which were used for growing black wattle in 1967, but which have since been cleared and are being used for growing something else. The survey showed that woodlot growing households operate larger parcels, are older, support fewer residents, and have more non-resident relatives than other households in the survey. Woodlot growing parcels are also at a lower altitude and are more steeply sloping than other parcels. Patterns of resource allocation suggest that woodlot growing households are more risk averse. Logistic regression (logit) modeling explored causal relationships, suggesting woodlots are indeed {{more likely to be}} established as households age and as labour becomes scarce, and that woodlot clearance takes place when labour is more available to cultivate the holding. </p...|$|E

The modelling approach requires continuous regressors and an independent response factor. The demand as an <b>operating</b> <b>factor</b> is considered as independent response factor in relation to the continuous regressors. The method validation is made along several longitudinal case studies to cover local, global and international industrial operations. The examined operational scope is from continuous operations to one-off production. Concerning scheduling, these examined demand driven, industrial operations are considered as open and dynamic, flow shop or job-shop operations. The examined managerial scope is from local work management to global industrial operations management. The theoretical framework of this study is based on operations management, productivity and controllability engineering. The strategical target is to improve productivity. The operational target setting is based on linear goal programming, streamlined demand driven material flow and specified operating factors according to this study, Forrester effect diagnostics and replenishment models. The engineering of strategical target into exact operational schedule as a task target is hard to accomplish, because of the combinatorial dynamic job-shop problem.

It is the removal efficiency of colloidal particles in the pH range of 4 – 7 {{that leads to the}} formation of amorphous hydroxide precipitates and other aluminum hydroxo complexes with hydroxide ions and polymeric species (Bayramoglu et al. 2004). It has been shown that pH is {{an important}} factor in EC and its variation is usually caused by the solubility of metal hydroxides. The pH of the effluent increases for acidic influent after electro-coagulation and decreases for alkaline influent. The hydroxy radicals which may be produced as a result of dissociation of water under certain electrochemical reactions are known to be one of the most reactive aqueous radical species and these radicals have the ability to oxidize almost all of the organic compounds because of their high affinity value of 136  kcal (Chen and Hung 2007). In fact, hydroxyl radical is an extremely potent oxidizing agent with a short half-life, and is able to oxidize organic compound by hydrogen abstraction reaction, by redox reaction and/or by electrophilic addition to pi systems resulting in a cascade of free radical reactions leading to oxidative degradation of pollutants (Oturan 2000). However, electrolysis using Al electrodes leads to the formation of ionic complexes, and formation of hydroxyl radical, to the best of our knowledge, has not been demonstrated. The Al 3 + ions on hydrolysis generated the aqueous complex Al (H 2 O) 6 3 +, which was predominant at pH <  4. Between pH 5 and 6; the predominant hydrolysis products were Al(OH) 2 + [...] and Al(OH) 2 + [...] between pH 5.2 and 8.8, the solid Al(OH) 3 was more prevalent and above pH 9, the soluble species Al(OH) 4 were the predominant and were the only species present above the pH 10 (Gomes et al. 2007).|$|E
40|$|The {{conceptual}} {{design of the}} early warning based roll instability enhancement system is realized through systematic investigations on static and dynamic roll behavior of the vehicles, identification of indicators for the onset of instability, and reliability analysis. The relative and absolute roll instability criteria are initially derived from the rollover mechanics of different heavy vehicle combinations. The relative roll instability conditions are evaluated under steady cornering maneuvers through development and analysis of static roll plane models. The sensitivity of the static rollover threshold (SRT) measure to variations in design and operating factors of the vehicle and suspension configurations is evaluated and the conditions of relative rollover for different vehicle configurations are identified. A constant velocity three-dimensional model is derived for relative roll instability analysis of articulated vehicles under dynamic directional maneuvers. Dynamic rollover threshold of articulated heavy vehicles is proposed {{on the basis of}} effective lateral acceleration (ELA) and relative rollover criterion. The absolute roll instability of heavy vehicles is further investigated using energy approach to derive the absolute rollover limits. A number of potential rollover indicators are identified and evaluated for a five-axle tractor semi-trailer combination using the constant velocity three-dimensional vehicle model in terms of their reliability and early warning capability for driver's actions. The effectiveness of proposed indicators for the open-loop roll stability enhancement is investigated through development and analysis of a comprehensive vehicle model, incorporating braking dynamics. Time delays due to driver's reaction and the transportation lag of the braking system are characterized by a variable referred to as reaction delay. The rollover indicators are investigated for their effectiveness for open- loop roll stability control in various cornering and evasive maneuvers, road conditions, braking efforts, and reaction delays. The study revealed that the RSF is the most reliable indicator, irrespective of the vehicle configurations, while its measurability is relatively poor.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the United States’ {{dependence}} on crude-oil negatively affects its economy, safety, and environment. To alleviate these negative consequences, a more economical and environmentally-friendly source of fuel, such as biomass, should be explored. The conversion of biomass to bio-oils involves the pyrolysis of biomass at about 500 °C, thus requiring a great deal of heat. This heat source could be the excess waste heat from a coal gasifier. As such, this report specifies the design of an industrial plant that produces bio-oils from biomass by using the waste heat from a coal gasifier. It is designed to produce 2. 24 × 108 kg/yr of bio-oil that can be sold at $ 0. 79 /kg. This plant involves coal and biomass solids handling, a coal gasification reactor, a biomass pyrolysis reactor, and a series of separation units to remove waste products from the syngas and isolate the bio-oil. The syngas contains methane, hydrogen, and carbon monoxide and is sold as a by-product credit. The plant is expected to run on feeds of 1. 5 x 1011 kg/yr of coal and 5. 4 x 108 kg/yr of raw biomass. The coal gasification reactor was sized based on the heating duty of steam at 273000 kJ/s and the biomass pyrolysis reactor was sized based on a heating duty of 7026 kJ/s. The plant’s <b>operating</b> <b>factor</b> (POF) is 0. 9 at 7884 hrs/yr running 24 hrs/day and 328. 5 days/yr. The total bare module equipment cost, including all pumps, heat exchangers, grinders, separators, absorber, and reactors is $ 93 million. The total capital investment of the plant is $ 173 million. The DCFRR and NRR are 12. 59 % and 20 % respectively. Given that selling price of bio-oil ($ 0. 79 /kg) associated with this plant is about six times more expensive that the average cost of bio-oil ($ 0. 13 /kg), it is not recommended that a Class – 1 Estimate be conducted. Before a Class – 1 Estimate can be conducted, the unnecessary costs associated with this proposed plant must be addressed and reduced.

40|$|The savings {{associated}} with operations optimization of power generation and cogeneration facilities are large, and readily justify the {{hardware and software}} costs required for implementation of Energy Management Optimization Systems (EMOS). The objective of such systems is to minimize the total energy operating costs for specified power and steam load profiles, including the purchase of external power and/or steam, {{and the use of}} internal self-generation equipment. The EMOS may require online operation using current measurements (e. g. flow, powers, temperatures, etc.), and calculating optimum energy purchase and equipment dispatch within time periods consistent with changing ambients, loads and/or purchase energy price conditions. The automatic recognition of changes in equipment status and system operating configuration may be required. The EMOS may also consider the electrical distribution system to minimize losses, and to ensure that tbe optimum thermal power dispatch may be reliably delivered to the loads under tbe existing distribution configuration within electrical equipment operating limits. Automatic generation dispatch may also be required. A system which incorporates the requirements of the above specification and more, has been designed, installed and is operational at a large industrial cogeneration facility. A description of the specifics of this entire system is beyond tbe scope of this paper, however, a discussion of selected system features will be given. This application involves the simultaneous optimization of energy supply for in-plant power and process steam from many highly integrated system components. Cogeneration plants, as shown in Figure 1, are generally characterized by multiple sources of energy, various types of prime movers (e. g. boilers, waste heat recovery, steam and gas turbines, etc.), and varying requirements for process heat and electrical power, particularly if bulk power is being purchased, or dispatched to a utility grid {{as in the case of}} Independent Power Producers. In addition, the operating characteristics of tbe equipment and loads are continuously changing due to outage of equipment, changes in process steam and electrical demands, ambient conditions and performance deterioration. The ability to coordinate and optimize the simultaneous operation of the various components to meet all the energy requirements at minimum cost is a formidable task. In addition to the thermal optimization of boilers, gas turbines, and various types of condensing and autoextraction steam turbines, the system also considers the electrical distribution system, where changing bus configurations, power and voltage control impose additional constraints and limits which are solved in the optimum dispatch. The application incorporates automatic closed loop control of many process set points with a sophisticated system of permissives and automatic generation control features. Since a high on-line <b>operating</b> <b>factor</b> is essential, many design features are incorporated for signal validation and malfunction identification, and to make the system robust to instrument failure and drift. The system can be used as an on-line or off-line supervisory program. For on line implementation, closed loop response, fail safe operation and interfacing with process control systems are key closed loop implementation considerations. The system involves the interaction of several modules. The following will describe selected modules and how they interface to satisfy existing loads at minimum cost...|$|E
40|$|This {{project is}} a {{proposal}} to marry a coal gasification process to a biomass pyrolysis. Coal is pyrolized to produce syngas and {{a large amount of}} heat. The syngas is treated and fed to a Fischer-Tropsch process. The excess heat produces steam that is used to pyrolize biomass. The biomass produces char, gas, and vapor. The char and gas are recovered, and the vapor is condensed to produce bio-oil. The proposed plant has a capacity of 1100 tons of biomass (550 dry tons) per day. I assumed an <b>operating</b> <b>factor</b> of 0. 9 The plant could be operational within five years, with approximately three years of construction and a year operating at lowered capacity. However, significant research is needed to confirm and optimize certain aspects of the process. The process has some sections at high temperatures and moderately high pressures. Certain units will be constructed of special materials to withstand the temperatures. Safety features will also be installed which will prevent temperatures from elevating beyond normal operating levels. A strong basic solution is also used to strip CO 2 from process gases. These units will be constructed of stainless steel for structural integrity. Finally, highly combustible products are used in the process. Safe storage of these materials and strict fire safety provisions will be established to minimize the risks of fire or explosion. Safety considerations affected the capital cost of the plant because of the special materials required for safe construction. The process does not have many environmental concerns. The gases produced by gasification and pyrolysis are collected as a byproduct to be used in a Fischer-Tropsch process. The disposal of liquid and solid waste is more of a concern. Solid slag can be disposed of in a landfill. Some liquid waste contains slag and ash and can be filtered. Other liquid waste has bio-oil contamination which is more expensive to remove. I made the assumption that this waste stream would need secondary treatment, which is fairly expensive and is a large contribution to the overall costs. The total capital cost of the plant is around $ 30 million. For a chemical plant, this is not very large. The capital cost has a very minor effect on the production costs. To run the equipment, the plant will employ 45 process engineers, with 5 shifts of 9 operators. Bio-oil can be produced for $ 1. 77 per kilogram. Estimates for bio-oil produced from an unmarried process are hard to find, and have not been scaled to a current value. They range from $ 0. 09 to $ 0. 50 per kilogram. The large disparity between my price and the literature values is mostly due to the high cost of disposing water contaminated with bio-oil. I recommend proceeding with research on ways to lower the operating costs. Specifically, if water contaminated with bio-oil can be disposed of with primary treatment rather than secondary treatment, the cost of production is lowered by $ 1. 47 per kilogram, to $ 0. 30 per kilogram. Lowering waste treatment costs will make the plant highly competitive with unmarried designs. Further research should also be conducted into other process parameters, such as the effectiveness of NaOH stripping, a novel technique I used to lower treatment costs...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1978 The {{capacity}} expansion {{investment decisions}} on the provision of municipal sewerage are the central aspects of this analysis. The purpose is to present a methodology, utilizing a dynamic demand and supply model of sewerage, for recommending a set of values for the investment and pricing decision variables. The outcome of the investment decisions is an economically efficient time sequence of capacity expansions. The pricing decisions involves a departure from an economically efficient set of user charges, i. e. from marginal cost pricing. The model consists of a cost function, i. e. amount of capacity and variable <b>operating</b> <b>factors</b> used per period times price; a set of production process equations transforming influent to effluent water quality standards; {{and a set of}} factors affecting influent, cost, and production. The factors taken into consideration are: Economies of size in capacity expansion costs, technological change, inflation, deterioration of capacity and economic life of capacity, discounting to present value, time horizon of model, changes in effluent water quality standards, and changes in the flow of influent due to an increase in users, price elasticity of the flow of influent and changes in water consumptive habits, formation of substitutes through technological change, as well as rainstorm drainage and infiltration. It is the investment decisions on timing of capacity expansions and mix of capacity types in each expansion which are of concern. These investment decisions must be considered simultaneously with those on economic amortization of capacity expansion costs and economic life of capacity, as well as use of, variable <b>operating</b> <b>factors</b> in the production process. Furthermore consideration for pricing in terms of user charges is given. By simultaneously solving a set of necessary marginal conditions associated with the investment decision variables and use of variable <b>operating</b> <b>factors,</b> the timing of capacity expansions and mix of capacity types in each expansion may be derived. With the existence of several capacity types, several variable <b>operating</b> <b>factors,</b> numerous feasible times for a capacity expansion, and a set of complex equations representing the production process; the use of a simulation analysis is imperative. Formulation of a simulation model should be {{on the basis of the}} equations developed in this analysis. Though the values of the decision variables resulting from a Simulation analysis may not be optimal, i. e. minimize present value cost subject to a production output constraint, the present value cost for a set of feasible time sequence of capacity expansions may be compared under various influent, cost, and production conditions...|$|R
