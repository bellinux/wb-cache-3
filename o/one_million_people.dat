The Slavs were very familiar with the water environment and used it as natural defense.|$|E

5|$|Mumbai {{suffers from}} the same major {{urbanisation}} problems seen in many fast growing cities in developing countries: widespread poverty and unemployment, poor public health and poor civic and educational standards for a large section of the population.

Many of them live {{in close proximity to}} bus or train stations although suburban residents spend significant time travelling southward to the main commercial district.

5|$|Over 300,000 {{people took}} part and raised $3.5 {{million in the}} first Terry Fox Run. Schools across Canada were urged to join the second run, held on September 19, 1982.

The Terry Fox Run is the world's largest one-day fundraiser for cancer research, and over $600 million has been raised in his name. The 30th Terry Fox Run was held September 19, 2010.|$|E
5|$|PD is {{the second}} most common {{neurodegenerative}} disorder after Alzheimer's disease and affects approximately seven million people globally and <b>one</b> <b>million</b> <b>people</b> in the United States. The proportion in a population at a given time is about 0.3% in industrialized countries. PD is more common in the elderly and rates rise from 1% in those over 60 years of age to 4% of the population over 80. The mean age of onset is around 60 years, although 5–10% of cases, classified as young onset PD, begin between the ages of 20 and 50. PD may be less prevalent in those of African and Asian ancestry, although this finding is disputed. Some studies have proposed that it is more common in men than women, but others failed to detect any differences between the two sexes. The number of new cases per year of PD is between 8 and 18 per 100,000 person–years.|$|E
