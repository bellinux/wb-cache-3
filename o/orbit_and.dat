5|$|A second instrument, Doppler <b>Orbit</b> <b>and</b> Radio Positioning Integration by Satellite, or DORIS, {{is used to}} {{calculate}} precisely the spacecraft's orbit.

5|$|Additionally {{a family}} of {{derivative}} launch vehicles was proposed {{in order to take}} an advantage of economies of scale, further reducing launch costs. These derivatives include a Reusable First Stage in a class of small and medium size launch vehicles like Vega and Arianespace Soyuz, the Super-Heavy Lift Launcher capable of lifting nearly 70 tonnes to the <b>orbit,</b> <b>and</b> a Two-Stage-To-Orbit system operating a dedicated reusable orbiter.|$|E

40|$|The bifurcations of heteroclinic loop {{with one}} nonhyperbolic {{equilibrium}} and one hyperbolic saddle are considered, where the nonhyperbolic equilibrium {{is supposed to}} undergo a transcritical bifurcation; moreover, the heteroclinic loop has an <b>orbit</b> flip <b>and</b> an inclination flip. When the nonhyperbolic equilibrium does not undergo a transcritical bifurcation, we establish the coexistence and noncoexistence of the periodic <b>orbits</b> <b>and</b> homoclinic <b>orbits.</b> While the nonhyperbolic equilibrium undergoes the transcritical bifurcation, we obtain the noncoexistence of the periodic <b>orbits</b> <b>and</b> homoclinic <b>orbits</b> <b>and</b> the existence {{of two or three}} heteroclinic orbits...|$|R

5|$|Although the Sun {{dominates the}} system by mass, it {{accounts}} for only about 2% of the angular momentum. The planets, dominated by Jupiter, account {{for most of the}} rest of the angular momentum due to the combination of their mass, <b>orbit,</b> <b>and</b> distance from the Sun, with a possibly significant contribution from comets.|$|E

5|$|Ecliptic {{coordinates}} are {{convenient for}} specifying positions of Solar System objects, {{as most of}} the planets' orbits have small inclinations to the ecliptic, and therefore always appear relatively close to it on the sky. Because Earth's <b>orbit,</b> <b>and</b> hence the ecliptic, moves very little, it is a relatively fixed reference with respect to the stars.|$|E
5000|$|The {{difference}} between <b>orbits</b> <b>and</b> attainable sets is that, whereas for attainable sets only forward-in-time motions are allowed, both {{forward and backward}} motions are permitted for orbits.

5|$|In 1978, the {{discovery}} of Pluto's moon Charon allowed the measurement of Pluto's mass for the first time: roughly 0.2% that of Earth, and far too small {{to account for the}} discrepancies in the orbit of Uranus. Subsequent searches for an alternative Planet X, notably by Robert Sutton Harrington, failed. In 1992, Myles Standish used data from Voyager 2s flyby of Neptune in 1989, which had revised the estimates of Neptune's mass downward by 0.5%—an amount comparable to the mass of Mars—to recalculate its gravitational effect on Uranus. With the new figures added in, the discrepancies, and with them the need for a Planet X, vanished. Today, the majority of scientists agree that Planet X, as Lowell defined it, does not exist. Lowell had made a prediction of Planet X's <b>orbit</b> <b>and</b> position in 1915 that was fairly close to Pluto's actual <b>orbit</b> <b>and</b> its position at that time; Ernest W. Brown concluded soon after Pluto's discovery that this was a coincidence, a view still held today.|$|E
40|$|The {{theme of}} this thesis is a study of a ring of {{polynomial}} mappings; in particular a study of polynomial <b>orbits</b> <b>and</b> its cycles. The aim is an enlargement of the already known results from polynomial <b>orbits</b> problems <b>and</b> its cycles by our own results {{in the area of}} polynomial <b>orbits</b> <b>and</b> cycles in finite commutative algebraic structures investigation and in this way to give an integral survey of this problems. This thesis includes a summarizing of the most important records in the polynomial mappings problems, its <b>orbits</b> <b>and</b> cycles, furthermore our own results in the problems of polynomial <b>orbits</b> <b>and</b> cycles in finite commutative algebraic structures study and applications of these results at concrete important fields and rings. The summarizing of the most important records contains firstly a description of the set of all possible polynomial cycle lengths in algebraically closed fields, integral domains and rings of algebraic integers.

5|$|While the comet's dust tail roughly {{followed}} {{the path of}} the comet's <b>orbit</b> <b>and</b> the gas tail pointed almost directly away from the Sun, the sodium tail appeared to lie between the two.

5|$|A {{limitation}} of the radial velocity method used to detect 47 Ursae Majoris b is that only a lower limit on the planet's mass can be obtained. Preliminary astrometric measurements made by the Hipparcos satellite suggest the planet's orbit is inclined at an angle of 63.1° to {{the plane of the}} sky, which would imply a true mass 12% greater than the lower limit determined by radial velocity measurements. However, subsequent investigation of the data reduction techniques used suggests that the Hipparcos measurements are not precise enough to adequately characterise the orbits of substellar companions, and the true inclination of the <b>orbit</b> (<b>and</b> hence the true mass) are regarded as unknown.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the extreme}} trans-Neptunian objects are two high {{perihelion}} objects: Sedna and 2012 VP113. Sedna and 2012 VP113 are distant detached objects with perihelia greater than 70 AU. Their high perihelia keep {{them at a}} sufficient distance to avoid significant gravitational perturbations from Neptune. Previous explanations for the high perihelion of Sedna include a close encounter with an unknown planet on a distant <b>orbit</b> <b>and</b> a distant encounter with a random star {{or a member of}} the Sun's birth cluster that passed near the Solar System.|$|E
