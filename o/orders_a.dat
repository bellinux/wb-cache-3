After the mob subsides, SpongeBob is welcomed as a Krusty Krab employee, much to Squidward's dismay. After Mr. Krabs leaves, Patrick <b>orders</b> <b>a</b> Krabby Patty and is hurled from the establishment upon a mostly-unseen, and audibly manic, reprise of SpongeBob's cooking feat.|$|E

As he leaves to repair it the room transforms around him, leading him to a brightly lit chamber where he unknowingly activates the city-sized ancient Autobot Metroplex. The Titan destroys two Decepticon Warp Cannons but is shot point-blank by the third and presumed dead. Then, Starscream and the Combaticons ambush and capture Optimus soon after and bring him before Megatron. As Megatron prepares to execute Optimus, Metroplex arrives and pummels him into the ground.

5|$|The away team scans Armus' energy field, {{finding that}} when Armus engulfs {{the shuttle and}} speaks to Troi, expressing his remorse and pity, the field disrupting their {{transporter}} signals is weakened which could allow them to beam Troi and the pilot out of the shuttle. After Armus toys with Troi by completely engulfing Commander Riker (Jonathan Frakes), Captain Picard beams down to speak to Armus directly, sending {{the rest of the}} away team to the ship. Picard engages Armus in a heated discussion to discover its motive, which is to seek revenge on those that abandoned it on Vagra II. Armus is riled to a point where the energy field is dissipated enough, allowing for Picard, Troi and the pilot to be safely beamed back to the Enterprise. After destroying the shuttlecraft from orbit, Picard <b>orders</b> <b>a</b> quarantine on Vagra II.|$|E
5|$|The next day, {{the corpse}} of a shapeshifter is found, {{shot in the head}} with its data disc—encoded {{information}} regarding its mission—missing.

Meanwhile, Counselor Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) uses hypnosis on both Worf and Crusher, finding that both recall being invaded by some entity during their blackouts. The ship suddenly drops again out of warp, and as Picard investigates the readouts at a bridge console, the strange energy transfers into him. The bridge crew becomes suspicious of Picard's actions after noting that all Enterprise systems are back to normal and that Picard has ordered them to return to the cloud.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} other CMF units {{operated}} M3 Grant medium tanks in the immediate post–war period, including the 8th/13th Victorian Mounted Rifles (8th/13th VMR) and the 4th/19th Prince of Wales's Light Horse (4th/19th PWLH), before converting to Centurions. Meanwhile, {{the last of the}} Matildas were withdrawn from service with the CMF in 1955. Later, in 1956 the 1st Royal New South Wales Lancers merged with the 15th Northern River Lancers to form the 1st/15th Royal New South Wales Lancers (1st/15th RNSWL), which was also equipped with a small number of Centurion tanks. The CMF armoured units were rationalised in 1957 and consequently the change to the pentropic structure in the 1960s mostly resulted in a change in role only, with the 4th/19th PWLH changing from an armoured unit to a reconnaissance regiment. However, the two CMF armoured brigade headquarters were disbanded. Following additional <b>orders,</b> <b>a</b> total of 127 Centurions had been acquired by 1961, including 117 tanks, four bridgelayers and six Armoured Recovery Vehicles.|$|E
