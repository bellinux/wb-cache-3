5|$|<b>One-piece,</b> {{machined}} from a nitrogen-hardened nickel-chrome {{molybdenum steel}} forging. Statically and dynamically balanced. Seven main bearings and six throws.|$|E
5|$|Corporate Flight Duty Uniform– a {{dark blue}} version of the <b>one-piece</b> flight suit made of Nomex material. This is worn by CAP flight {{personnel}} only.|$|E
5|$|Some moulds allow {{previously}} {{moulded parts}} to be reinserted {{to allow a}} new plastic layer to form around the first part. This {{is often referred to}} as overmoulding. This system can allow for production of <b>one-piece</b> tires and wheels.|$|E
5|$|Flight Duty Uniform– green Nomex <b>one-piece</b> CWU 27/P flight suit worn by United States Air Force flight crews, styled in {{a manner}} similar to Air Mobility Command flight crews, but with CAP insignia. This is worn by CAP flight {{personnel}} only.|$|E
5|$|The JBL D44000 Paragon is {{an iconic}} <b>one-piece</b> stereo {{loudspeaker}} created by JBL that {{was introduced in}} 1957 and discontinued in 1983; its production run was the longest of any JBL speaker. At its launch, the Paragon was the most expensive domestic loudspeaker on the market.|$|E
5|$|The barrel was of <b>one-piece</b> forged construction, with uniform rifling (12 grooves, {{right-hand}} twist, one turn in 25 calibers). The breech end of {{the barrel}} was screwed into a breech ring. The breech mechanism was of vertical sliding-block type. The barrel was fitted with a hydrospring recoil system.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, Australian swimmer and {{performer}} Annette Kellerman {{was arrested}} on a Boston beach for wearing form-fitting sleeveless <b>one-piece</b> knitted swimming tights that covered her from neck to toe, a costume she adopted from England, although it became accepted swimsuit attire for women in parts of Europe by 1910. In 1913, designer Carl Jantzen made the first functional two-piece swimwear. Inspired {{by the introduction of}} females into Olympic swimming he designed a close-fitting costume with shorts for the bottom and short sleeves for the top.|$|E
5|$|Injection {{moulding}} is used {{to create}} many things such as wire spools, packaging, bottle caps, automotive parts and components, gameboys, pocket combs, some musical instruments (and parts of them), <b>one-piece</b> chairs and small tables, storage containers, mechanical parts (including gears), and most other plastic products available today. Injection moulding {{is the most common}} modern method of manufacturing plastic parts; it is ideal for producing high volumes of the same object.|$|E
5|$|Launched in 1987 {{priced at}} £350, Artemiz is the {{flagship}} tonearm whose design {{was also a}} break from established conventions. The arm and headshell is a <b>one-piece</b> construction; the large-gauge aluminium tube interference-fitted at one end into a massive yoke that is the bearing. The tube is flat {{at the other end}} to provide for mounting the cartridge. The arm is finished in a matt resonant paint. Unusually, there is no finger lift for cueing but the arm is fitted with a conventional lever-operated lift/lower assembly.|$|E
5|$|The flaps {{are mounted}} by steel sliders and rollers, {{attached}} to brackets {{on the rear}} spar. The trapezoidal ailerons are near the wingtips. The fuselage of the Su-25 has an ellipsoidal section and is of semi-monocoque, stressed-skin construction, arranged as a longitudinal load-bearing framework of longerons, beams and stringers, with a transverse load-bearing assembly of frames. The <b>one-piece</b> horizontal tailplane {{is attached to the}} load-bearing frame at two mounting points.|$|E
5|$|Around {{this time}} he adopted his famous style of dressing, {{consisting}} of a knee-length <b>one-piece</b> Kafni robe and a cloth cap. Ramgir Bua, a devotee, testified that Sai Baba was dressed like an athlete and sported 'long hair flowing down {{to the end of}} his spine' when he arrived in Shirdi, and that he never had his head shaved. It was only after Baba forfeited a wrestling match with one Mohiddin Tamboli that he took up the kafni and cloth cap, articles of typical Sufi clothing. This attire contributed to Baba's identification as a Muslim fakir and was a reason for initial indifference and hostility against him in a predominantly Hindu village.|$|E
5|$|By {{that year}} the bikini made up nearly 20% of {{swimsuit}} sales, {{more than any}} other model in the US. As skin cancer awareness grew and a simpler aesthetic defined fashion in the 1990s, sales of the skimpy bikini decreased dramatically. The new swimwear code was epitomized by surf star Malia Jones, who appeared on the June 1997 cover of Shape Magazine wearing a halter top two-piece for rough water. After the 90s, however, the bikini came back again. US market research company NPD Group reported that sales of two-piece swimsuits nationwide jumped 80% in two years. On one hand the <b>one-piece</b> made a big comeback in the 1980s and early 1990s, on the other bikinis became briefer with the string bikini in the 1970s and 80s.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of the {{abutment}} {{material or}} technique, {{an impression of}} the abutment is then taken and a crown secured to the abutment with dental cement. Another variation on abutment/crown model is when the crown and abutment are one piece and the lag-screw traverses both to secure the <b>one-piece</b> structure to the internal thread on the implant. There {{does not appear to}} be any benefit, in terms of success, for cement versus screw-retained prosthetics, although the latter is believed to be easier to maintain (and change when the prosthetic fractures) and the former offers high esthetic performance.|$|E
5|$|Rochambeau {{completed}} her refit on 18 May 1868 and was briefly {{under the command}} of Captain (Capitaine de vaisseau) Jules-François-Émile Krantz (a future Minister of Marine) before being decommissioned on 1 August and placed in reserve. She was refitted from August to December and had her forward hull armor plates replaced by a <b>one-piece</b> cast iron ram. Still in reserve in 1869, Rochambeau was modified with an additional 240 mm pivot gun mounted over the forward end of the casemate and the pine planking underneath the guns in the casemate was replaced by oak.|$|E
5|$|The Flapper awoke {{from her}} {{lethargy}} of sub-deb-ism, bobbed her hair, {{put on her}} choicest pair of earrings {{and a great deal}} of audacity and rouge and went into the battle. She flirted because it was fun to flirt and wore a <b>one-piece</b> bathing suit because she had a good figure... she was conscious that the things she did were the things she had always wanted to do. Mothers disapproved of their sons taking the Flapper to dances, to teas, to swim and most of all to heart.|$|E
5|$|Since 1958, the Cup has {{undergone}} several minor alterations. The original collar and bowl were too brittle, and were replaced in 1963 and 1969, respectively. The modern <b>one-piece</b> Cup design {{was introduced in}} 1958, when the old barrel was replaced with a five-band barrel, each of which could contain 13 winning teams. Although the bands were originally designed to fill up during the Cup's centennial year, {{the names of the}} 1965 Montreal Canadiens were engraved over a larger area than allotted and thus there are 12 teams on that band instead of 13. When the bands were all filled in 1991, the top band of the large barrel was preserved in the Hockey Hall of Fame, and a new blank band was added to the bottom so the Stanley Cup would not grow further.|$|E
5|$|The {{locomotives}} were {{equipped with}} the unusual 6ft 2 in (1.88 m) Bulleid Firth Brown (BFB) driving wheels which were lighter, yet stronger than the spoked equivalent. These proved to be successful and were later used on other Bulleid classes. The leading bogie was based upon that of the SR Lord Nelson class, although it had a 6ft 3 in (1.90 m) wheelbase as opposed to Maunsell's 7ft 6 in (2.28 m) design, and featured 3ft 1 in (0.94 m) BFB wheels. A long coupled driving wheelbase was incorporated into the design, to keep the locomotives within the lineal loading of the Southern Railway's narrower bridges. The supporting rear trailing truck was a <b>one-piece</b> steel casting that gave the smoothest of rides; the design was utilised in the future BR Standard Class 7.|$|E
5|$|To further aid {{athletes in}} gliding as aerodynamically as possible, they wear a <b>one-piece</b> fabric {{bodysuit}} {{more similar to}} a wingsuit than a ski suit. It is composed of five layers and is both loose-fitting and porous enough to allow up to 52litres of air to enter and 40litres to pass through. This generates yet more lift, but the amount of slack is stringently regulated by the FIS so as to not allow for excessive bagginess and thereby reducing its wingsuit-, sail- or parachute-like properties. In the early 2000s, bodysuits had reached exceptionally baggy proportions, resulting in humorous comparisons to flying squirrels. A ban on these baggy suits came into effect soon after, and today the level of slack for bodysuits is measured by FIS scrutineers before and after each jump: if the amount is exceeded, that athlete is disqualified due to an 'equipment violation'.|$|E
5|$|The {{video was}} filmed from 31 August to 1 September 2009 in various {{locations}} in Los Angeles, directed by Bryan Barber. The clip starts with Alexandra {{dressed in a}} <b>one-piece</b> black leather suit, as her car has broken down in a bad part of town. It then cuts to Flo Rida who sings the opening lines of the song. Next, Burke performs various dance moves in deserted streets while being followed by several men. The video then shows Alexandra entering a bar in a mirrored silver dress, which {{has been compared to}} Janet Jackson around the janet. era, where she is mobbed by more of these men. She then performs more dance routines, before a fight ensues between the men in the bar over Alexandra and Flo Rida performs his part in the song. During his rap, there are scenes where Alexandra backflips off a bar table, and pushes two men powerfully over a bar and through a door. The video then shows Alexandra dancing with more men in a deserted parking lot.|$|E
5|$|The {{script for}} Part 3 called for Jason {{to wear a}} mask to cover his face, having worn a bag over his head in Part 2; what no one {{knew at the time}} was that the mask chosen would become a {{trademark}} for the character, and one instantly recognizable in popular culture in the years to come. During production, Steve Miner called for a lighting check. None of the effects crew wanted to apply any make-up for the light check, so they decided to just throw a mask on Brooker. The film's 3D effects supervisor, Martin Jay Sadoff, was a hockey fan, and had a bag of hockey gear with him on the set. He pulled out a Detroit Red Wings goaltender mask for the test. Miner loved the mask, but it was too small. Using a substance called VacuForm, Doug White enlarged the mask and created a new mold to work with. After White finished the molds, Terry Ballard placed red triangles on the mask to give it a unique appearance. Holes were punched into the mask and the markings were altered, making it different from Sadoff's mask. There were two prosthetic face masks created for Richard Brooker to wear underneath the hockey mask. One mask was composed of approximately 11 different appliances and took about six hours to apply to Brooker's face; this mask was used for scenes where the hockey mask was removed. In the scenes where the hockey mask is over the face, a simple head mask was created. This <b>one-piece</b> mask would slip on over Brooker's head, exposing his face but not the rest of his head.|$|E

25|$|Although footed, <b>one-piece</b> {{garments}} in {{a variety}} of fabrics and styles are used in many countries as infant sleepwear, the specific range of styles with which the term blanket sleeper is usually associated, the term itself, and the phenomenon of children older than infancy wearing footed, <b>one-piece</b> sleeping garments, are all largely unique to North America.|$|E

25|$|According to FIVB rules, female {{beach volleyball}} players {{have the option}} of playing in shorts or a <b>one-piece</b> swimsuit. Most players, however, prefer the two-piece bikini.|$|E
25|$|On tilled soil a <b>one-piece</b> roller has the {{disadvantage}} that when turning corners the outer {{end of the}} roller has to rotate much faster than the inner end, forcing one or both ends to skid. A <b>one-piece</b> roller turned on soft ground will skid up a heap of soil at the outer radius, leaving heaps, which is counter-productive. Rollers are often made {{in two or three}} sections to reduce this problem, and the Cambridge roller overcomes it altogether by mounting many small segments onto one axle so that they can each rotate at local ground-speed.|$|E
25|$|Finally, many children's {{bikes and}} older, or less-expensive bikes have <b>one-piece</b> ("Ashtabula") cranks {{where the two}} cranks and bottom bracket spindle are forged as one piece of steel (see {{photograph}} above).|$|E
