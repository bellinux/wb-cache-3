5|$|Each {{solution}} of Einstein's equation encompasses {{the whole history}} of a universe— it is not just some snapshot <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>things</b> are, but a whole, possibly matter-filled, spacetime. It describes the state of matter and geometry everywhere and at every moment in that particular universe. Due to its general covariance, Einstein's theory is not sufficient by itself to determine the time evolution of the metric tensor. It must be combined with a coordinate condition, which is analogous to gauge fixing in other field theories.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of '4 Minutes', Tim had a vision from the {{beginning}} <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>things</b> should go, especially sonically... When I opened up the session of '4 Minutes', {{there was so much}} going on that I knew right away that the hard part would be {{to make sure that the}} vocals would cut through and were right in the pocket. Beginning with working on the vocals was the only way to achieve this. After that I formed all the other parts around the vocals. The other challenge was to make sure that everything in the track sounded clear and that you could hear every instrument, every syllable, every breath. Also, I do almost always work linear in time on a track. It's easier, because when you're done, you're done. So I keep working on section after section, until I get to the end of the track and then I know the whole mix is pretty close.|$|E
5|$|Production {{began in}} late 2003 at Barrandov Studios in Prague, Czech Republic, {{where most of}} the filming took place. Production {{designer}} Richard Bridgland was in charge of sets, props and vehicles, based on early concept art Anderson had created to give a broad direction <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>things</b> would look. 25 to 30 life-sized sets were constructed at Barrandov Studios, many of which were interiors of the pyramid. The pyramid's carvings, sculptures, and hieroglyphs were influenced by Egyptian, Cambodian, and Aztec civilisations, while the regular shifting of the pyramid's rooms was meant to evoke a sense of claustrophobia similar to the original Alien film. According to Anderson, if he was to build the sets in Los Angeles they would have cost $20 million. However, in Prague they cost $2 million, an important factor when the film's budget was less than $50 million.|$|E

Leto described the film as [...] "a really special, DIY project." [...] He explained, [...] "We all shared a part of our lives that we've never shared on-screen before, a very intimate and personal part of our lives.

500|$|The {{lack of a}} {{permanent}} saving mechanic and permanence of death were criticized. Marchiafava, while normally a fan of permadeath in games, found it problematic in Don't Starve because, unlike other games such as The Binding of Isaac and Spelunky, Don't Starve is much longer and so death felt like more of a loss. Meunier noted that the novelty and thrills of each new run wear off somewhat [...] "when you're stuck tackling the same menial tasks {{over and over again}} to regain lost ground." [...] Sliva expressed disappointment at being given [...] "nearly no recognition from Don't Starve itself" [...] upon being killed by a frog, and reported being bored for roughly 30 minutes at the overly familiar starts of later playthroughs. Brown thought similarly, also calling the early game in particular [...] "a bit dull." [...] Saldana, however, reasoned that [...] "you at least gain some knowledge <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>things</b> work" [...] and would thus make incremental, enjoyable progress.|$|E

500|$|Scott-Heron's {{characteristic}} {{sound on}} the album {{is rooted in the}} blues, jazz, and soul music. He referred to his mellow fusion of style as [...] "bluesology, the science <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>things</b> feel." [...] Scott-Heron's and Jackson's compositions for Winter in America incorporate elements of African music, heavy percussion, and chants. They also feature scene-setting, spoken word intros and mystical interludes, which were influenced by the free jazz stylings of contemporary artists such as Pharoah Sanders and Abdullah Ibrahim. Jackson wrote arrangements that tended to be more straight-ahead material, incorporating classic jazz bridges in his compositions. Scott-Heron, as the main lyricist and vocalist, exhibited more pop sensibilities with his compositions and created indelible hooks that were influenced by the black popular music of the time. By combining their distinct approaches to composing, Scott-Heron and Jackson produced a multicultural, diffused sound that evoked the afrobeat and world music style of artists such as Fela Kuti during the African music scene's popularity.|$|E
500|$|American author Jennifer Roberson {{was known}} for writing fantasy novels before she moved into {{historical}} fiction, a genre new to her. She noted, [...] "One thing I'd always wanted to try–another ‘someday’ dream– was a big, sprawling, mainstream historical epic." [...] She proposed to her literary agent that she write a reinterpretation of the Robin Hood legend {{from the perspective of}} Maid Marian. Roberson understood that her rendition was not a [...] "recounting" [...] of the original story, because [...] "there is none"; rather, Lady of the Forest was [...] "purely [...] own concoction." [...] Describing the novel as a prequel, the author explained, [...] "I wanted very much to write the story of how the legend came to be; the tale of how seven very different people from a rigidly stratified social structure came to join together to fight the inequities of medieval England. To me, the key was logic—I interwove historical fact with the fantasy of the classic legend, and developed my own interpretation <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>things</b> came to be. I wanted to come to know all of these people; to climb inside their heads and learn what motivated them to do what they did." ...|$|E

In regard to this, Townsend stated on HeavyBlogIsHeavy.com: [...] "The Peavey situation was intense and a real eye opener in terms <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>things</b> REALLY work in the business side of endorsements, and I can’t say I really enjoyed it, but we got the guitar out and everyone is nice to each other so all good... I really like that V. However, I decided to use other guitars for other stuff as well, a Sadowsky Tele set, a Framus hollowbody group of guitars, and the V’s. No one is entirely happy with that decision, but I find it difficult to not be straight up with folks about what I want to play and do and have typically pissed people off as a result... The bottom line though is I like what I like and it is important to the music to be accurate with tones and vibe. The guitars I actually play, I really like, regardless of brand." ...|$|E

2500|$|The album's {{music is}} rooted in the blues and jazz influences, which Scott-Heron {{referred}} to as [...] "bluesology, the science <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>things</b> feel." [...] It is characterized by mellow instrumentation, jazzy vocals and free jazz arrangements, which Scott-Heron would revisit with Brian Jackson on their collaboration album Winter in America (1974). The album features Gil Scott-Heron exercising his singing abilities in contrast to his previous work with poetry. It also contains more conventional song structures than the loose, spoken-word feel of Small Talk.|$|E

2500|$|Heidegger's idea of aletheia, or {{disclosure}} (Erschlossenheit), was {{an attempt}} to make sense <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>things</b> in the world appear to human beings as part of an opening in intelligibility, as [...] "unclosedness" [...] or [...] "unconcealedness". (This is Heidegger's usual reading of aletheia as Unverborgenheit, [...] "unconcealment.") It is closely related to the notion of world disclosure, the way in which things get their sense as part of a holistically structured, pre-interpreted background of meaning. Initially, Heidegger wanted aletheia to stand for a re-interpreted definition of truth. However, he later corrected the association of aletheia with truth.|$|E

This was the only half-way bright spot in an otherwise difficult period.

However, Capitol declined to release The Blurred Crusade in North America and demanded that they write more radio-friendly material, as exemplified by their stable-mates Little River Band, which horrified the band. After another recording session, five new songs were offered to Capitol but the label was still unimpressed and dropped the band. The five songs were later released in Australia as the EP [...] Sing-Songs, which reached the Top100 Albums Chart in December. Meanwhile, their manager, Michael Chugg, arranged a U.K. tour supporting the hugely successful pop group Duran Duran, but after eight gigs The Church pulled out, feeling that the audiences were unsympathetic. Chugg later recalled, [...] "They were hard work. All four of them were strong-willed and had their own ideas <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>things</b> should be." [...] The band also toured Scandinavia and Europe in 1982, and both of their albums were released there to critical acclaim.|$|E
2500|$|Protagoras is {{credited}} with the philosophy of relativism, which he discusses in his work, Truth (also known as Refutations). Although knowledge of his work is limited, discussion of Protagoras' relativism is based {{on one of his}} most famous statements: [...] "Man is the measure of all things: {{of the things that are}}, that they are, of the things that are not, that they are not." [...] By this, Protagoras meant that each individual is the measure <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>things</b> are perceived by that individual. Therefore, things are, or are not, true according to how the individual perceives them. For example, Person X may believe that the weather is cold, whereas Person Y may believe that the weather is hot. According to the philosophy of Protagoras, there is no absolute evaluation of the nature of a temperature because the evaluation will be relative to who is perceiving it. Therefore, to Person X, the weather is cold, whereas to Person Y, the weather is hot. This philosophy implies that there are no absolute [...] "truths". The truth, according to Protagoras, is relative, and differs according to each individual.|$|E
