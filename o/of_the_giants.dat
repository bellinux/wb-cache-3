He threw his first career complete game shutout on September 14, 2010 also against San Francisco and finished {{the season with a}} record of 13–10 and a 2.91 ERA in 32 starts, pitching 204 innings and recording 212 strikeouts.|$|E

5|$|McGinnity {{purchased}} the Newark Indians of the Class-A Eastern League (EL) for $50,000 ($ in current dollar terms) in 1909 from Frank J. Farrell. The press reported that McGinnity would operate {{the team as}} a farm team <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Giants,</b> though he denied these reports. When McGinnity could not retain manager Harry Wolverton, he stepped in as player-manager for the Indians. That season, he had a 29–16 record. His 422 innings pitched and 11 shutouts set EL single-season records. He also won both games of doubleheaders on August 27, 1909, and July 23, 1912.|$|E
5|$|Sánchez began 2009 as {{a starter}} but {{was moved to the}} bullpen during the season. He was {{returned}} to the rotation on July 10 because of an injury to fellow starter Randy Johnson, however, and he threw a no-hitter against the San Diego Padres that day. In 2010, Sánchez struck out 200 batters {{for the first time and}} was a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Giants</b> team that won the World Series. In 2011 he married a Dominican model name Audris Rijo. He was traded to the Kansas City Royals in 2012, who traded him to the Colorado Rockies after he struggled in the first half of the season. He began 2013 with the Pittsburgh Pirates.|$|E
5|$|The Giants were dealt {{their first}} loss {{at the hands}} of the Philadelphia Eagles on November 25 by a score of 31-13, {{dropping}} their record to 10–1. The Eagles broke open a close game by scoring two touchdowns in 22 seconds in the fourth quarter. The game was marked by several scuffles, and after the game some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Giants</b> players complained of the tactics used by the Eagles. The Eagles amassed 179 rushing yards and 405 total yards, and punted the ball just twice. Eagles quarterback Randall Cunningham rushed for 66yards while completing 17 of 31 passes for 229yards, two touchdowns and no interceptions. Taylor, who recorded three sacks and seven tackles in the Giants' season-opening victory over the Eagles, was held to one tackle in the loss.|$|E

5|$|With the Orioles {{reportedly}} {{in significant}} debt, part-owner John Mahon purchased {{shares of the}} team from star players Joe Kelley and John McGraw, who had resigned from the team and signed with the New York Giants of the NL, becoming the majority shareholder. On July 17, 1902, he sold {{his interest in the}} Orioles to Andrew Freedman, principal owner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Giants,</b> and John T. Brush, principal owner of the Cincinnati Reds, also of the NL. That day, Freedman and Brush released Bresnahan, Kelley, Joe McGinnity, Jack Cronin, Cy Seymour, and Dan McGann from their contracts. Brush then signed Kelley and Seymour to the Reds, while Freedman signed McGinnity, Bresnahan, Cronin, Gilbert, and McGann, joining McGraw, his new player-manager, on the Giants.|$|E
5|$|Although the Giants were {{successful}} {{on the field}} in their initial seasons, they struggled financially. A key event in franchise history occurred in the 11th game <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Giants</b> inaugural season. The Chicago Bears, led by star running back Red Grange, came to town attracting a then pro football record 73,000 fans, and giving the Giants a much needed financial influx. The following year, Grange and his agent formed a rival league and stationed a competing team, led by Grange, in New York. Though the Giants lost $50,000 that season, the rival league folded and was subsumed into the NFL. After these initial struggles, the Giants financial status stabilized, and they {{led the league in}} attendance several times in the 1930s and 1940s. By the early 1960s, the Giants had firmly established themselves as one of the league's biggest attractions. However, rather than continue to receive their higher share of the league television revenue, the Mara sons pushed for equal sharing of revenue {{for the benefit of the}} entire league. Revenue sharing is still practiced in the NFL today, and is credited with strengthening the league.|$|E
5|$|However, the Orioles {{struggled}} with debt. Joe Kelley, star player for the Orioles and son-in-law of part-owner John Mahon, {{reported that the}} team owed as much as $12,000 ($ in current dollar terms). Unable to afford that debt, Mahon purchased shares of the team from Kelley and John McGraw. With this, Mahon became the majority shareholder, owning 201 of the team's 400 shares. On July 17, 1902, Mahon sold {{his interest in the}} Orioles to Andrew Freedman, principal owner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Giants,</b> and John T. Brush, principal owner of the Cincinnati Reds, also of the NL. That day, Freedman released McGann, McGraw, Cy Seymour, Roger Bresnahan, Joe Kelley, Joe McGinnity, and Jack Cronin from their contracts with Orioles. Freedman signed McGann, Bresnahan, McGinnity and Cronin to the Giants, joining McGraw, who had signed with the Giants ten days earlier. Brush signed Seymour and Kelley to the Reds.|$|E

5|$|The 1987 {{season was}} a {{disappointment}} for the Giants. They lost their first two {{games of the season}} before the 1987 NFL Players Strike. As opposed to the players strike five years previous, NFL owners made a decision to go forward with replacement players. Unlike other teams such as the Washington Redskins and Houston Oilers, who made specific and elaborate plans to deal with the replacement games, the Giants made no plans. This resulted in the Giants losing all three replacement games, putting their record at 0–5 before the strike was over and the regular players returned. Though the Giants went a respectable 6–4 over their final 10 games, they were out of the playoffs at 6–9. A particular disappointment was the running game, which due to injuries to the offensive line (including tackle Karl Nelson missing the entire season due to Hodgkin's disease) struggled all season. Standouts included tight end Mark Bavaro, who led the team in catches with 55, and three <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Giants</b> linebackers making the Pro Bowl—Taylor, Carl Banks (who was voted the team's MVP by the players), and Carson.|$|E
5|$|The Giants scored {{first for}} the second {{consecutive}} game, as Orlando Cepeda singled with one out in the second inning and scored on a double by Felipe Alou against Dodgers' starter Don Drysdale. The Giants then extended their lead {{in the top of the}} sixth inning. Alou struck out to open the inning but Tom Haller then walked and advanced to third base on a double by José Pagán. Giants' starter Jack Sanford then reached based on a throwing error by Drysdale, which also allowed Haller to score and advanced Pagán to third base. Chuck Hiller and Jim Davenport followed this with successive singles which scored Pagán and Sanford respectively. This made the score 4–0 in favor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Giants</b> with Hiller on second and Sanford on first, still with only one out in the inning. Ed Roebuck entered in relief of Drysdale, inducing an out at second base on a groundball by Willie Mays, to leave runners at the corners with two outs. Willie McCovey singled, allowing Hiller to score and make the game 5–0; Cepeda was then retired to end the inning.|$|E
5|$|The Mets {{were tied}} with the Cubs and Giants in the wild-card race as {{late in the}} season as September 25 at 88–72. However, the Mets lost their {{remaining}} two games and finished their season one game back of the Cubs and Giants who ended tied at 89–73. This record was also the best non-division-winning record and as such a tie-breaker was necessary to determine the wild-card winner. A coin flip on September 14 gave the Cubs' home field advantage, setting Wrigley Field as the location for the game. In the event of a three-way tie the Cubs were presented with the choice to either host two home games or receive a bye and play the winner of a Mets-Giants game on the road because they had the best combined record against the Mets and Giants. Cubs' general manager Ed Lynch decided on the second option, though the choice was moot as the Mets fell out of the race. The Cubs' Steve Trachsel and Mark Gardner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Giants</b> were slated to start the tie-breaker on the September 28.|$|E
