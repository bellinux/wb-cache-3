40|$|Background: Coronary {{artery disease}} (CAD) affects {{both men and}} women. Cardiovascular {{biomarkers}} have been suggested to relate to CAD severity, but data on sex-specificity is scarce. Therefore, we investigated the association of established biomarkers with the severity of CAD in stable patients undergoing coronary angiography in a sex-specific manner. Methods: We studied stable patients undergoing coronary angiography and measured CAD severity by <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> and biomarker levels (N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT pro-BNP), high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP), cystatin C (CysC), myeloperoxidase (MPO), high-sensitivity troponin I (hsTnI) and von Willebrand factor (VWF)). We tested for sex differences in SYNergy between percutaneous coronary intervention with TAXUS (TM) and cardiac surgery (<b>SYNTAX)</b> <b>scores</b> and biomarker levels using multivariable ANCOVA. We investigated the association of biomarker levels with <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> in a multivariable linear regression with interaction terms for sex. Results: We analysed data on 460 men and 175 women. <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>scores</b> were significantly lower in women (9. 99 points vs. 11. 88 points). Univariably, hsCRP and hsTnI levels {{were significantly associated with}} <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>scores</b> (both beta 2. 5).

Objective: We sought to 1) validate and compare {{the performance of the}} <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>Score</b> 1 and 2 for predicting major cardiovascular events at 4 years in patients who underwent unprotected left main angioplasty and 2) evaluate the long-term outcome according to the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> 2 -recommended revascularization strategy. Methods: We retrospectively studied 132 patients from a single-centre registry who underwent unprotected left main angioplasty between March 1999 and December 2010. Discrimination and calibration of both models were assessed by ROC curve analysis, calibration curves and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test. Results: Total event rate was 26. 5 % at 4 years. The AUC for the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>Score</b> 1 and <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>Score</b> 2 for percutaneous coronary intervention, was 0. 61 (95 % CI: 0. 49 - 0. 73) and 0. 67 (95 % CI: 0. 57 - 0. 78), respectively. Despite a good overall adjustment for both models, the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>Score</b> 2 tended to underpredict risk. In the 47 patients (36 %) who should have undergone surgery according to the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>Score</b> 2, event rate was numerically higher (30 % vs. 25 %; p= 0. 54), and for those with a higher difference between the two <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>Score</b> 2 scores (Percutaneous coronary intervention vs. Coronary artery by-pass graft risk estimation greater than 5. 7 %), event rate was almost double (40 % vs. 22 %; p= 0. 2).

Suitable biology marker to predict the severity of CAD and to have a treatment decision for revascularization by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or bypass surgery, is still unknown. Which biology marker can be a predictor for higher <b>Syntax</b> <b>score</b> remains unknown as well.

The area under the curve of GDF- 15 (0. 912, 95 % confidence interval 0. 894 to 0. 944) was significantly greater compared to high-sensitivity C reactive protein and <b>syntax</b> <b>score.</b> In conclusion, in patients with NSTEACS, levels of GDF- 15 at admission were correlated with the <b>syntax</b> <b>score</b> and independently associated with an increased risk of MACE during 2 -year follow-up.

40|$|ObjectiveThe SYNergy between {{percutaneous}} {{intervention with}} TAXus drug eluting stents and cardiac surgery (<b>SYNTAX)</b> <b>Score</b> {{is a tool}} for risk stratification of patients according {{to the complexity of}} coronary lesions developed during the SYNTAX trial. We examined the influence of the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>Score</b> on the incidence of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events. MethodsAll patients with de novo left main or 3 -vessel disease undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting from January 2005 to December 2008 at our institution (Hospital Clínico San Carlos, Madrid, Spain) were retrospectively assessed, and their <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>Score</b> was calculated. The influence of the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>Score</b> on postprocedural and follow-up mortality and combined major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (including death, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, and repeat revascularization) was identified by multivariate analysis. Balancing score analysis was performed to eliminate the effect of potential confounders. ResultsA total of 716 patients were enrolled. Mean <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>Score</b> was 34. 5 (standard deviation, 6. 7; range,  11. 5 – 76). Three groups of patients were identified according to the score terciles: low (≤ 33), intermediate (33 – 37), and high (> 37). These terciles scores differed greatly from those reported by the SYNTAX trial investigators. The multivariate analysis identified that the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>Score</b> was associated with follow-up mortality (hazard ratio =  1. 046, P = . 015) and combined early and follow-up major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (odds ratio =  1. 079, P < . 001; and hazard ratio =  1. 034, P = . 026, respectively). Balancing score-adjusted analyses demonstrated that the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>Score</b> was independently associated with early and late major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (odds ratio =  1. 65, P < . 001; and hazard ratio =  1. 034, P = . 027, respectively). ConclusionsSYNTAX Score was remarkably high among patients undergoing surgical off-pump myocardial revascularization at our institution. In this subset of patients, a higher <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>Score</b> was associated with a higher incidence of in-hospital and follow-up major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events after coronary artery bypass grafting, but not with early or late mortality...|$|R

Methods: <b>Syntax</b> <b>score</b> was calculated and compared for 91 consecutive patients underwent MSCTA and Invasive coronary angiography (ICA). Results: MSCTA for the diagnosis of > 50 % stenosis per coronary artery showed that MSCTA had a specificity, sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value and accuracy of 92. 2 % (217 / 235), 97. 1 % (125 / 129), 98. 2 % (217 / 221), and 94. 3 % (364 / 386) respectively. Agreement between modalities was high with a kappa of 0. 74. There was {{a positive correlation between}} MSCTA and ICA <b>Syntax</b> <b>scores</b> (r =  0. 73, p =  0. 000). The mean <b>Syntax</b> <b>score</b> was 15. 8  ±  7. 16 for ICA versus 16. 3  ±  7. 6 for MSCTA (Kappa of Cohen 0. 66, p =  0. 000). The Bland–Altman plot revealed that the estimated bias was 1. 9  ±  3. 4 and the most bias occurred with a higher <b>syntax</b> <b>score.</b> Lesions per patient were more identified with MSCTA than ICA (2. 5  ±  1. 4 vs. 1. 9  ±  1. 1, p <  0. 001), with a good level of agreement (kappa =  0. 65). <b>Syntax</b> <b>score</b> per lesion was similar {{with a high level of}} agreement (6. 3  ±  5. 8 vs. 6. 0  ±  4. 8, kappa =  0. 74, p <  0. 001). Calcified lesions were identified to a similar extent (28 vs. 26 cases) with a fair level of agreement (kappa =  0. 42). Lesions identified with both techniques showed a higher level of agreement than the total score (6. 5  ±  4. 8 for MSCTA vs. 6. 9  ±  6. 3 for ICA, p <  0. 05), kappa =  0. 76.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundChronic {{kidney disease}} (CKD) is highly {{prevalent}} with significant {{morbidity and mortality}} rates among patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). The Synergy between Percutaneous Coronary Intervention with TAXUS and Cardiac Surgery (<b>SYNTAX</b> <b>Score)</b> predicts the outcomes of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. Our aim was to evaluate the correlation between CKD and severity of coronary artery stenosis by calculating <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>Scores</b> in non diabetic CKD patients. Patients and methodsSYNTAX Score was calculated for 180 non diabetic patients with CKD scheduled for coronary angiography. Serum creatinine, estimated Glomelular Filteration Rate (e-GFR) and 24 -h proteinuria prior to Invasive Coronary Angiography (ICA) were assessed in all patients. Patients {{were divided into two}} groups according to their e-GFR, group 1 with e-GFR ⩾ 15 to < 30 ml/min per 1. 73 m 2 and group 2 with e-GFR ⩾ 30 to < 60 ml/min per 1. 73 m 2. ResultsCoronary arteries lesions complexity increased progressively with decreasing kidney function as there was significant negative correlation between e-GFR and <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>Score</b> (r=− 0. 5, P= 0. 0004) and significant positive correlation between 24 -h proteinuria and <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>Score</b> (r= 0. 6, p= 0. 0001).

40|$|ABSTRACTBACKGROUNDThe <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> was {{developed}} as an angiographic tool to grade {{the complexity of}} coronary artery disease in patients with three-vessel and/or left main disease. We evaluated its role in predicting clinical outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in non-selected patients, treated in the daily clinical practice of a reference center. METHODSAnalysis of patients undergoing PCI from March to September 2009 and followed-up for up to 12 months. Patients were divided in tertiles according to the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score.</b> The primary endpoint included major adverse cardiac events (MACE) – death, non-fatal acute myocardial infarction and target-vessel revascularization. The ability of the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> in predicting MACE was assessed by the ROC (Receiver Operator Characteristic) curve. RESULTSTwo hundred and thirty-four patients with a mean <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> of 11. 6 ± 6. 2 points were included. Tertile I had a <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> ≤ 9 (average 5. 9); tertile II, > 9 and≤ 13 (average 10. 8); and tertile III, > 13 (average 18. 3). In the clinical follow-up of 7. 2 ± 4. 9 months, the incidence of MACE was greater in tertile III when compared to tertiles I and II (2. 5 % vs. 6. 4 % vs. 14. 1 %; P= 0. 0075). The ROC curve showed an area under the curve of 0. 667 (P= 0. 012) indicating a moderate ability to anticipate the occurrence of MACE in this population. CONCLUSIONSThe <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> proved to be useful in predicting the occurrence of MACE after PCI in real world patients...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Coronary {{artery disease}} (CAD) {{is a global}} problem with {{increasing}} incidence in Asia. Prior studies reported inter-ethnic differences in the prevalence of CAD rather than the severity of CAD. The angiographic "synergy between percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with taxus and cardiac surgery" (<b>SYNTAX)</b> <b>score</b> quantifies CAD severity and predicts outcomes. We studied CAD severity and all-cause mortality in four globally populous ethnic groups: Caucasians, Chinese, Indians and Malays. METHODS: We quantified <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>scores</b> of 1, 000 multi-ethnic patients undergoing PCI in two tertiary hospitals in the Netherlands (Caucasians) and Singapore (Chinese, Indians and Malays). Within each ethnicity we studied 150 patients with stable CAD and 100 with ST-elevated myocardial infarction (STEMI). We made inter-ethnic comparisons of <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>scores</b> and all-cause mortality. RESULTS: Despite having a younger age (mean age Indians: 56. 8 and Malays: 57. 7 vs. Caucasians: 63. 7 years), multivariable adjusted <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>scores</b> were significantly higher in Indians and Malays than Caucasians with stable CAD: 13. 4 [11. 9 - 14. 9] and 13. 4 [12. 0 - 14. 8] vs. 9. 4 [8. 1 - 10. 8], p< 0. 001. Among STEMI patients, <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>scores</b> were highest in Chinese and Malays: 17. 7 [15. 9 - 19. 5] and 18. 8 [17. 1 - 20. 6] vs. 15. 5 [13. 5 - 17. 4] and 12. 7 [10. 9 - 14. 6] in Indians and Caucasians, p< 0. 001. Over a median follow-up of 709 days, 67 deaths (stable CAD: 37, STEMI: 30) occurred. Among STEMI patients, the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> independently predicted all-cause mortality: HR 2. 5 [1. 7 - 3. 8], p< 0. 001 for every 10 -point increase. All-cause mortality was higher in Indian and Malay STEMI patients than Caucasians, independent of <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> (adjusted HR 7. 2 [1. 5 - 34. 7], p= 0. 01 and 5. 8 [1. 2 - 27. 2], p= 0. 02). CONCLUSION: Among stable CAD and STEMI patients requiring PCI, CAD is more severe in Indians and Malays than in Caucasians, despite having a younger age. Moreover, Indian and Malay STEMI patients had a greater adjusted risk of all-cause mortality than Caucasians, independent of <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score...</b>|$|R
40|$|Aims To {{investigate}} {{the ability of}} <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> and Clinical <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> (CSS) to predict very long-term outcomes in an all-comers population receiving drug-eluting stents. Methods and results The <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> was retrospectively calculated in 848 patients enrolled in the SIRolimus-eluting stent compared with pacliTAXel-Eluting Stent for coronary revascularization (SIRTAX) trial. The CSS was calculated using age, and baseline left ventricular ejection fraction and creatinine clearance. A stratified post hoc comparison was performed for all-cause mortality, cardiac death, myocardial infarction (MI), ischaemia-driven target lesion revascularization (TLR), definite stent thrombosis, and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) at 1 - and 5 -year follow-up. Tertiles for <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> and CSS were defined as SSLOW ≤ 7, 7 14 and CSSLOW ≤ 8. 0, 8. 0 17. 0, respectively. Major adverse cardiac events rates were significantly higher in SSHIGH compared with SSLOW at 1 - and 5 -year follow-up, which was also seen at 5 years for all-cause mortality, cardiac death, MI, and TLR. Stratifying outcomes across CSS tertiles confirmed and augmented these results. Within CSSHIGH, 5 -year MACE increased with use of paclitaxel- compared with sirolimus-eluting stents (34. 7 vs. 21. 3 %, P= 0. 008). <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> and CSS were independent predictors of 5 -year MACE; CSS was an independent predictor for 5 -year mortality. Areas-under-the-curve for <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> and CSS for 5 -year MACE were 0. 61 (0. 56 - 0. 65) and 0. 62 (0. 57 - 0. 67), for 5 -year all-cause mortality 0. 58 (0. 51 - 0. 65) and 0. 66 (0. 59 - 0. 73) and for 5 -year cardiac death 0. 63 (0. 54 - 0. 72) and 0. 72 (0. 63 - 0. 81), respectively. Conclusion <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> and {{to a greater extent}} CSS were able to stratify risk for very long-term adverse clinical outcomes in an all-comers population receiving drug-eluting stents.
