5|$|The Ministries of Japan (行政機関) {{consist of}} eleven {{ministries}} and the Cabinet Office. Each ministry {{is headed by}} a Minister of State, which are mainly senior legislators, and are appointed from among the members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cabinet</b> by the Prime Minister. The Cabinet Office, formally headed by the Prime Minister, is an agency that handles the day-to-day affairs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cabinet.</b> The ministries are the most influential part of the daily-exercised executive power, and since few ministers serve {{for more than a}} year or so necessary to grab hold of the organisation, most of its power lies within the senior bureaucrats.|$|E

5|$|The {{interior}} of the machine was very complicated and designed to mislead those who observed it. When opened on the left, the front doors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabinet</b> exposed a number of gears and cogs similar to clockwork. The section was designed so that if the back doors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabinet</b> were open {{at the same time}} one could see through the machine. The other side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabinet</b> did not house machinery; instead it contained a red cushion and some removable parts, as well as brass structures. This area was also designed to provide a clear line of vision through the machine. Underneath the robes of the Ottoman model, two other doors were hidden. These also exposed clockwork machinery and provided a similarly unobstructed view through the machine. The design allowed the presenter of the machine to open every available door to the public, to maintain the illusion.|$|E

5|$|Singapore's Elected Presidency {{scheme was}} {{created as a}} {{constitutional}} safeguard for the nation's future to prevent irresponsible governance. Being directly elected by the people gives the President legitimacy and moral authority {{to serve as a}} check on the executive's powers. The President's two main responsibilities are the protection of Singapore's past reserves and the preservation of the integrity of the public service. However, the President's role is custodial and ceremonial – he does not exercise executive powers. In fact, the President is generally required to act in accordance with the advice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cabinet,</b> or of a Minister acting under the general authority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cabinet,</b> in the exercise of his functions under the Constitution or any other written law, unless the contrary is expressly provided for.|$|E
5|$|The Constitution {{defines the}} Government of Singapore as the President and the Cabinet of Singapore. The {{executive}} authority of Singapore is vested in the President and is exercisable by him {{or by the}} Cabinet of Singapore or any Minister authorized by the Cabinet. However, the President normally plays a nominal and largely ceremonial role {{in the executive branch}} of government. Although the President acts in his personal discretion in the exercise of certain functions as a check on the Cabinet and Parliament of Singapore, he is otherwise required to act in accordance with the advice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cabinet</b> or of a Minister acting under the general authority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cabinet.</b> It is the Cabinet that has the general direction and control of the Government. As Singapore follows the Westminster system of government, the legislative agenda of Parliament is determined by the Cabinet. At the start of each new Parliamentary session, the President gives an address prepared by the Cabinet that outlines what the Cabinet intends to achieve in the session.|$|E
5|$|The McMahon {{government}} had consisted of 27ministers, twelve of whom comprised the Cabinet. In {{the run-up to}} the election, the Labor caucus had decided that should the party take power, all 27ministers were to be Cabinet members. Intense canvassing took place amongst ALP parliamentarians as the duumvirate did its work, and on 18 December the caucus elected the Cabinet. The results were generally acceptable to Whitlam, and within three hours, he had announced the portfolios <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cabinet</b> members. To give himself greater control over the Cabinet, in January 1973 Whitlam established five Cabinet committees (with the members appointed by himself, not the caucus) and took full control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cabinet</b> agenda.|$|E
