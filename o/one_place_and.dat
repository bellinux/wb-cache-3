5|$|On 3 February 2000, Smith was {{appointed}} manager of Oxford {{for the second}} time in his career, with the club 21st in the Second Division. He re-signed striker Nigel Jemson from Ayr United, and kept Oxford in the division as they ended 1999–2000 in 20th place, <b>one</b> <b>place</b> <b>and</b> one point above the relegation zone. He signed a one-year contract extension in the summer of 2000, but fell out with chairman Firoz Kassam. He later admitted that the signings he made on a limited budget, which included Ian McGuckin, Andy Scott and Rob Quinn, were not good enough. Smith resigned on 2 October 2000 after a terrible start to 2000–01, a season which ended in Oxford being relegated in last place. He continued to work as a scout for the club under David Kemp and then Mark Wright.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{returning}} to the UK he joined Bobby Gould's First Division Coventry City on a one-year £300 a week contract. He was made captain, and though Coventry enjoyed a good first half to the 1983–84 season they faltered badly {{in the second half}} of the season and finished just <b>one</b> <b>place</b> <b>and</b> two points above the relegation zone after beating Norwich City on the final day of the season. Midway through the campaign Gould had promised him a new two-year contract, but following the poor end to the season he instead opted to release Allardyce.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, in 1980, {{geologist}} Walter Alvarez and his father, Nobel Prize-winning scientist Luis Walter Alvarez, put forth his hypothesis {{that a large}} extraterrestrial body had struck Earth. In 1981, unaware of Penfield's discovery, University of Arizona graduate student Alan R. Hildebrand and faculty adviser William V. Boynton published a draft Earth-impact theory and sought a candidate crater. Their evidence included greenish-brown clay with surplus iridium containing shocked quartz grains and small weathered glass beads that looked to be tektites. Thick, jumbled deposits of coarse rock fragments were also present, {{thought to have been}} scoured from <b>one</b> <b>place</b> <b>and</b> deposited elsewhere by a megatsunami resulting from an Earth impact. Such deposits occur in many locations but seem concentrated in the Caribbean basin at the K–Pg boundary. So when Haitian professor Florentine Morás discovered what he thought to be evidence of an ancient volcano on Haiti, Hildebrand suggested it could be a telltale feature of a nearby impact. Tests on samples retrieved from the K–Pg boundary revealed more tektite glass, formed only in the heat of asteroid impacts and high-yield nuclear detonations.|$|E
5|$|Oxford {{began the}} next season with a new manager and a new stadium, with the {{relocation}} to the Kassam Stadium completed {{after six years of}} speculation. Former Liverpool and England defender Mark Wright was given the manager's job, but resigned in late November, after being accused of making racist remarks to referee Joe Ross. Wright's successor, Ian Atkins, was unable to make an immediate impact and Oxford finished in 21st position in the league, at the time their lowest-ever league position. United missed out on the play-off places the following season, by <b>one</b> <b>place</b> <b>and</b> one point. Fifteen wins {{at the start of the}} 2003–04 season saw Oxford top of the table at the end of January. However, Ian Atkins was sacked in March after agreeing to take charge at rivals Bristol Rovers. His replacement, Graham Rix, could only manage a ninth-place finish at the end of the season, and was sacked the following November. Oxford replaced him with Argentine Ramón Díaz, who managed the team to a mid-table finish. Diaz and his team of assistants left the club at the beginning of May 2005, after being banned from the ground by the chairman following failed negotiations. During his time at the club, Diaz brought in a number of South American players including his own sons, and Juan Pablo Raponi. Ex-England midfielder and former West Bromwich Albion manager Brian Talbot signed a two-year contract to replace Rix. Talbot found little success and was sacked in March 2006, with the club in 22nd place. He was replaced by youth team coach Darren Patterson.|$|E

5|$|Ship {{services}} in Nordhordland started in 1866, and in 1923 {{the first car}} was purchased. A car ferry service between Isdalstø in Lindås and Steinestø in Åsane on the mainland was established on 7 July 1936. A plan was launched whereby all traffic from Nordhordland would be collected in <b>one</b> <b>place</b> <b>and</b> transported across Salhusfjorden to Åsane. By moving the ferry quay from Isdalstø to Knarvik, {{the length of the}} ferry service could be reduced. However, the fares would be kept the same and the extra revenue used to finance a bridge from Flatøy to Lindås. This allowed the Alversund Bridge to open in 1958, and the ferry service from Flatøy and Meland to move to Knarvik. The proposal to cross Salhusfjorden was launched during the planning of the Alversund Bridge. Cost estimates were made based on the Golden Gate Bridge in the United States, but it proved too expensive for a suspension bridge crossing between Frekhaug and Salhus.|$|E

25|$|When {{agriculture}} {{was first}} developed, simple hand-held digging sticks and hoes {{were used in}} highly fertile areas, such as {{the banks of the}} Nile where the annual flood rejuvenates the soil, to create drills (furrows) to plant seeds in. Digging sticks, hoes, and mattocks were not invented in any <b>one</b> <b>place,</b> <b>and</b> hoe-cultivation must have been common everywhere agriculture was practiced. Hoe-farming is the traditional tillage method in tropical or sub-tropical regions, which are characterised by stony soils, steep slope gradients, predominant root crops, and coarse grains grown at wide distances apart. While hoe-agriculture is best suited to these regions, it is used in some fashion everywhere. Instead of hoeing, some cultures use pigs to trample the soil and grub the earth.|$|E
25|$|The 2009–10 {{season began}} with the club losing their opening two home games, {{including}} a 1–6 home defeat {{at the hands of}} Arsenal and after a long period of speculation, defender Joleon Lescott was sold to Manchester City for £22 million. The club qualified for the group stages of the Europa League, but continued to perform poorly in the league. League results improved in December 2009, but Everton were knocked out of Europe over two legs by Sporting CP. At the end of March, they set a club record in the Premier League with seven consecutive home wins, which included victories over title chasers Chelsea and Manchester United. Everton finished the season in eighth place, just <b>one</b> <b>place</b> <b>and</b> two points adrift of neighbours Liverpool and a place in the UEFA Europa League for the following season. It was only the second out of six seasons where the Toffees failed to achieve European qualification.|$|E
25|$|The Army and the Navy are {{regionally}} organized, with central, national {{headquarters in}} Mexico City and subordinate, regional headquarters. Historically, this {{has proven to}} be effective, as the military's main deployments have been domestic. Troops are stationed throughout the country to serve as a continuing presence of authority and to allow for an immediate critical response. Dispersion by regional military zones has facilitated local recruitment of non-commissioned officers (Army sergeants, Navy petty officers) and enlisted men and women, allowing them to be stationed near family during their military service, an important cultural consideration. On the other hand, mobility is expected of commissioned officers, moving from assignment to assignment and to the military center, in Mexico City, giving them much experience, and, historically, preventing any senior officer from remaining too long in <b>one</b> <b>place</b> <b>and</b> developing a personal power base through local allegiances, and so becoming too powerful as a warlord.|$|E
