The organic matter and nutrients are the two main elements that make the spreading {{of this kind of}} waste on land as a fertilizer or an <b>organic</b> <b>soil</b> <b>improver</b> suitable. However the sewage sludge tends to contain heavy metals and poorly biodegradable trace organic compounds as well as potentially pathogenic organisms due to its waste water treatment process origin.

Biological production is obtained by using organic fertilizers or products deriving from organic waste after their composting or anaerobic fermentation for biogas production and / or soil improver by means of oxalor technology. In OXALOR technology, the organic substrate undergoes physical and chemical tra nsformation with the formation o a stable humified end product.

Soils are an environment likely to be exposed to manmade nanoparticles due to the practice of applying sewage sludge as a fertiliser or as an <b>organic</b> <b>soil</b> <b>improver.</b> However, understanding on the interactions between soil properties, nanoparticles and the organisms that live within soil is lacking, especially with regards to soil bacterial communities. We studied the effects of nanoparticulate, non-nanoparticulate and ionic zinc (in the form of zinc chloride) on the composition of bacterial communities in soil with a modified pH range (from pH 4. 5 to pH 7. 2). We observed strong pH dependent effects on the interaction between bacterial communities and all forms of zinc, with the largest changes in bacterial community composition occurring in soils with low and medium pH levels (pH 4. 8 and 5. 9). The high pH soil (pH 7. 2) was less susceptible to the effects of zinc exposure. At the highest doses of zinc (2500 mg/kg dw soil) both nano and non-nano particulate zinc applications elicited a similar response in the soil bacterial community, and this differed significantly to the ionic zinc salt treatment. The results highlight the importance of considering soil pH in nanotoxicology studies, although further work is needed to determine the exact mechanisms controlling the toxicity and fate and interactions of nanoparticles with soil microbial communities...|$|E
40|$|In Portugal, where soils have a {{very low}} topsoil organic matter content, the use of sewage sludge (SS) as <b>organic</b> <b>soil</b> <b>improvers</b> seems an {{attractive}} option, because it would enable organic matter, N, P, K and other nutrients to be recycled. However, the risk of this practice must be properly assessed. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the potential risk of the use of dewatered and composted SS as soil amendments. For this purpose, SS from two different wastewater treatment plants (SS 1 and SS 2), and a compost produced from SS and agricultural wastes (AWSSC), were characterized for their total metal concentrations, organic contaminants and indicator pathogens, and used in a pot experiment with three application rates, 6, 12 and 24 ton dry matter/ha, cultivated with a hybrid variety of sorghum and Sudan grass (Sorghum bicolor × Sorghum sudanense var. Rocket). SS 1 and AWSSC met the legal requirements to be applied to soils, but SS 2 had a high content of pathogens, which compromised its use. Both dewatered SS had a marked beneficial effect on plant production and on soil nutritional characteristics, more pronounced than in the case of AWSSC application, without a significant increase in total and in mobile metals concentration in soils. Bioaccumulation factors for metals in plants were low, and their concentrations in the aboveground plant material were lower than the maximum tolerable level for cattle, used as a risk indicator of metal entry into the human food chain. However, it will be necessary, in future studies, to evaluate the potential risk of the observed increase in the mobilisable content of Cu and Zn in soil, as a consequence of the application of these organic materials. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht...|$|R

The restriction of P fertilization also implies a restricted application of <b>organic</b> fertilizers and <b>soil</b> <b>improvers</b> as sources of carbon. Our objective was to compare organic fertilizers in their ability to increase the <b>soil</b> <b>organic</b> carbon level, and their influence on P leaching. Three long-term field trials were conducted where fertilization with compost, farmyard manure, digestates, cattle slurry and mineral fertilizers was compared, to determine soil P availability, <b>soil</b> <b>organic</b> carbon level and the soil P content. Soil samples of the tillage layer (0 - 30 cm) were used in a leaching experiment in controlled unsaturated conditions. This experiment revealed differences in susceptibility to P leaching between the fertilizer types. We observed that compost based on green waste materials is a better option than cattle farmyard manure to increase the <b>soil</b> <b>organic</b> carbon level, without further increasing P losses in soils with highly elevated P levels. Although farmyard manure has a potential to increase the <b>soil</b> <b>organic</b> carbon level comparable to that of compost, the use of farmyard manure stimulates increased soil P availability and P leaching. The solid fraction of mechanically separated digestate also stimulated increases in soil P availability and P leaching.

40|$|One of the {{key issues}} in {{developing}} Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) {{is represented by the}} optimal utilisation of fertilisers and herbicidal to reduce the impact of Nitrates in soils and the environment. In traditional agriculture practises, these substances were provided to the soils through the use of chemical products (inorganic/organic fertilizers, soil improvers/conditioners, etc.), usually associated to several major environmental problems, such as: water pollution and contamination, fertilizer dependency, soil acidification, trace mineral depletion, over-fertilization, high energy consumption, contribution to climate change, impacts on mycorrhizas, lack of long-term sustainability, etc. For this reason, the agricultural market is more and more interested in the utilisation of <b>organic</b> fertilisers and <b>soil</b> <b>improvers.</b> Among <b>organic</b> fertilizers, there is an emerging interest for the digestate, a sub-product resulting from anaerobic digestion (AD) processes. Several studies confirm the high properties of digestate if used as <b>organic</b> fertilizer and <b>soil</b> improver/conditioner. Digestate, in fact, is somehow similar to compost: AD converts a major part of organic nitrogen to ammonia, which is then directly available to plants as nitrogen. In this paper, new analytical tools, based on HyperSpectral Imaging (HSI) sensing devices, and related detection architectures, is presented and discussed in order to define and apply simple to use, reliable, robust and low cost strategies finalised to define and implement innovative smart detection engines for digestate characterization and monitoring. This approach is finalized to utilize this “waste product” as a valuable <b>organic</b> fertilizer and <b>soil</b> conditioner, in a reduced impact and an “ad hoc” soil fertilisation perspective.

In this project Khorezm Sugar Company, operations in the factory and environmental problems in it have been studied. Impacts of defecation lime were described. The waste causes a lot of environmental and economical problems in the region. As it is dry and consists of particles with small size,defecat is easy spread able with the wind. It swells to nearest areas and could have impact on biodiversity as well as on health of people. Different modern methods of handling the defecation lime in Europe and Asian countries and new methods that are not in practice in large scales yet, were also described. These methods, such as: use of defecation lime as a <b>soil</b> <b>improver,</b> as a fertilizer, as an additive in greenhouse soil mixture, as a sorbent to treat waste water, as a micro filler incement production and foam concrete production and as a mineral additive in animal feeding. Advantages and disadvantages of these methods were examined. As an example the British Sugar and the Lime X division of the company were described. They obtain the same type of waste from sugar production. And use defecationlime as a <b>soil</b> <b>improver</b> to stabilize <b>soil</b> pH, to add <b>organic</b> matters to <b>soil</b> and improve soilstructure. The defecation lime is sold by 3 brands in the company, like: LimeX 45, LimeX 70 and LimeX Super 70 M. What they are doing and how they treat are described. As the main treatment method in the other sugar manufacturing companies, use of defecat as a <b>soil</b> <b>improver</b> was studied deeply. Therefore, soil characters of Uzbekistan have also been described. The fertilizer need in the country, especially in Khorezm region andcrops need for organic matters were overviewed.

The aim of present work is to produce a classification of the <b>organic</b> <b>soils,</b> based on measurable soil properties and to then relate the characteristic <b>organic</b> <b>soil</b> properties to environmental factors. The relationship between <b>organic</b> <b>soil</b> characteristics and environmental factors will enable predictive mapping of the occurrence and organic content of <b>organic</b> <b>soils</b> in Tasmania. Tasmanian <b>organic</b> <b>soils</b> were sampled across 127 sites yielding a total of 1159 soil pits. Soil and environmental characteristics were recorded for each soil pit. Unsupervised clustering of the soil characteristics from each soil pit distinguished 23 <b>organic</b> <b>soil</b> groups. A classification key for identifying the 23 clusters was produced using the <b>soil</b> characteristics, <b>soil</b> <b>organic</b> carbon, humification, <b>soil</b> total nitrogen and <b>organic</b> <b>soil</b> depth. Dominant environmental factors influencing the 23 clusters were found, through vector analysis, smooth plate spline contouring and multinomial log-linear modelling to be: vegetation, burn frequency, topography, geology, altitude and climate. In order to predict the location and occurrence of the soils and soil characteristics produced through unsupervised clustering, the dominant environmental factors were subsequently used to provide cluster centroids for a supervised clustering. The resulting 41 soil groups {{were found to be}} distinguishable in terms of vegetation type, geology, topography and microtopography. The supervised clusters were found to perform better than the available vegetation classifications in predicting the unsupervised clusters. <b>Organic</b> <b>soil</b> carbon, bulk density and depth were used to model <b>organic</b> <b>soil</b> carbon stocks in Tasmania and provide a geographic context for the supervised and unsupervised soil clusters. Stepwise regression of <b>soil</b> <b>organic</b> carbon, showed slope as the dominant predictor across <b>organic</b> <b>soil</b> producing vegetation types.

The research involved five samples from Tanzania and one from South Africa, which was included for comparison purposes. The results show that not all samples are vermiculites, some are hydrobiotites. Analysis shows {{that none of them}} contain hazardous accessory minerals. The samples have high cation exchange capacities (CEC) and, thus, they are suitable as <b>soil</b> <b>improvers</b> with ability to retain plant nutrients form leaching. Some have elevated concentrations of Cr and Ni, but the metals are insignificantly plant-available and do not inhibit the uptake of essential plant nutrients. Heating vermiculites above 600 °C should be avoided as it reduces the CEC by more than 90 %, and makes some of the exfoliated products strongly alkaline and, thus, unfavourable for crop production. The Tanzanian vermiculites can retain plant-available water, but their ability is less than vermiculite from South Africa. The P in the vermiculites is extractable and extractability increases on heating to 200 - 400 °C. Application of vermiculites to the soil significantly enhanced the retention and fertilization of P. Nitrogen and K were less retained. Maize vegetative growth, dry matter yield, and nutrient uptake were significantly enhanced by amending the soil with vermiculites. Pre-heated vermiculite at 600 °C performed better than unheated vermiculite and inhibited the fixation of the applied K and N. Thus, the Tanzanian vermiculites are suitable for use as <b>soil</b> <b>improvers</b> for crop production.
