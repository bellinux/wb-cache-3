5|$|Lord Kelvin {{invented the}} heat pump in 1852, and Heinrich Zoelly had {{patented}} {{the idea of}} using it to draw heat from the ground in 1912. But {{it was not until the}} late 1940s that the geothermal heat pump was successfully implemented. The earliest one was probably Robert C. Webber's home-made 2.2kW direct-exchange system, but sources disagree as to the exact timeline of his invention. J. Donald Kroeker designed the first commercial geothermal heat pump to heat the Commonwealth Building (Portland, Oregon) and demonstrated it in 1946. Professor Carl Nielsen of Ohio State University built the first residential <b>open</b> <b>loop</b> version in his home in 1948. The technology became popular in Sweden as a result of the 1973 oil crisis, and has been growing slowly in worldwide acceptance since then. The 1979 development of polybutylene pipe greatly augmented the heat pump’s economic viability.|$|E
5|$|The Electra {{communications}} package is a UHF software-defined radio (SDR) {{that provides a}} flexible platform for evolving relay capabilities. It is designed to communicate with other spacecraft as they approach, land, and operate on Mars. In addition to protocol controlled inter-spacecraft data links of 1kbit/s to 2Mbit/s, Electra also provides Doppler data collection, <b>open</b> <b>loop</b> recording and a highly accurate timing service based on a 5e13USO. Doppler information for approaching vehicles {{can be used for}} final descent targeting or descent and landing trajectory recreation. Doppler information on landed vehicles will also enable scientists to accurately determine the surface location of Mars landers and rovers. The two MER spacecraft currently on Mars utilize an earlier generation UHF relay radio providing similar functions through the Mars Odyssey orbiter. The Electra radio has proven its functionality by relaying information to and from the MER spacecraft, Phoenix Mars lander and Curiosity rover.|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} a new technique to generate scattering amplitudes at one loop.

As demonstrated with non-trivial applications, the open-loop approach will permit to obtain precise predictions for a very wide range of collider processes.

Also known as 'dominant pole compensation' because it introduces a pole that masks (dominates) the effects of other poles into the <b>open</b> <b>loop</b> frequency response; in a 741 op amp this pole can be as low as 10Hz (where it causes a −3dB loss of <b>open</b> <b>loop</b> voltage gain).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a planar biochip consisting of electromagnetically coupled, symmetric, square <b>open</b> <b>loops</b> for the multiparameter microwave characterization of deionized water, a phosphate-buffered saline solution, and a fructose-deionized water solution. The characterization additionally includes the probing of an ultralow glucose concentration {{in a very}} small volume of human sera and in solutions of d-glucose powder and deionized water. The interaction between the coupled electromagnetic field and the aqueous solution sample translates into a predictable relationship between the electrical characteristics of the biochip (magnitude and phase of S-parameters, attenuation, phase constant, group delay, characteristic impedance, and effective complex permittivity) and the physical properties of the solution. Owing to the microfabrication technology used for fabricating the proposed microbiochip, it is possible to develop robust, compact square <b>open</b> <b>loops</b> with a microsized coupling gap that characterizes a very small volume (1 μL) of the sample. Additionally, the biochip’s impedance peaks at its resonances were modeled using glucose-level-dependent coupling capacitance between folded square <b>open</b> <b>loops</b> and mutual inductance between center-loaded T-shaped stubs. These peaks linearly shifted in frequencies and markedly varied in impedance. Consequently, a physiologically relevant amount of glucose (50 – 400 mg/dL) with a high sensitivity (up to 2. 036 Ω/(mg·dL− 1)) and an ultralow detection limit (up to 4. 8 nmol/L) was linearly detected...|$|R

25|$|Most single, dual and quad op-amps {{available}} have {{a standardized}} pin-out which permits one type to {{be substituted for}} another without wiring changes.

25|$|Non-zero output {{impedance}}: Low {{output impedance}} {{is important for}} low-impedance loads; for these loads, the voltage drop across the output impedance effectively reduces the <b>open</b> <b>loop</b> gain. In configurations with a voltage-sensing negative feedback, the output impedance of the amplifier is effectively lowered; thus, in linear applications, op-amp circuits usually exhibit a very low output impedance.|$|E
25|$|Electronic {{feedback}} loops {{are used}} to control the output of electronic devices, such as amplifiers. A feedback loop is created when all or some {{portion of the output}} is fed back to the input. A device is said to be operating <b>open</b> <b>loop</b> if no output feedback is being employed and closed loop if feedback is being used.|$|E

25|$|In semi-open {{or closed}} loops (i.e. value chains, {{whenever}} a global finality can be settled) IoT will often be considered and studied {{as a complex}} system due to the huge number of different links, interactions between autonomous actors, and its capacity to integrate new actors. At the overall stage (full <b>open</b> <b>loop)</b> it will likely {{be seen as a}} chaotic environment (since systems always have finality).|$|E
25|$|The {{control system}} {{performance}} {{can be improved}} by combining the feedback (or closed-loop) control of a PID controller with feed-forward (or open-loop) control. Knowledge about the system (such as the desired acceleration and inertia) can be fed forward and combined with the PID output to improve the overall system performance. The feed-forward value alone can often provide the major portion of the controller output. The PID controller primarily has to compensate whatever difference or error remains between the setpoint (SP) and the system response to the <b>open</b> <b>loop</b> control. Since the feed-forward output is not affected by the process feedback, it can never cause the control system to oscillate, thus improving the system response without affecting stability. Feed forward can {{be based on the}} setpoint and on extra measured disturbances. Setpoint weighting is a simple form of feed forward.|$|E

For super positions of three plane waves, the vortices are straight, parallel lines.

In 2008, Rieth Village at Merry Lea Environmental Learning Center of Goshen College became the first platinum-rated LEED building in Indiana. In the spring of 2013, the college took the further step of purchasing 100 percent of its electricity from renewable sources through the procurement of renewable energy credits. A computerized building temperature regulation system, motion light sensors for indoor and outdoor lighting and <b>open</b> <b>loop</b> ground-source heat pumps further reduce energy consumption on campus. The campus has also converted nearly 20 percent of its lawn space to native plants and prairie restoration. Goshen College students and staff have developed a food composting system, planted a community garden, built a solar hot water collection system and continued to reduce energy consumption campus-wide. In 2014, the college earned a silver rating from the Sustainability Tracking, Assessment and Rating System (STARS) report for its sustainability efforts. Through an aggressive energy reduction program and efficiency upgrades, Goshen College has reduced electric consumption by 25 percent and gas consumption by 23 percent since 2007.|$|E

"In {{contrast}} to block diagram and two-port {{approaches to the}} feedback network analysis problem, signal flow methods mandate no a priori assumptions as to the unilateral or bilateral properties of the <b>open</b> <b>loop</b> and feedback subcircuits.
