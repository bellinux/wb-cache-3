Backlit <b>orange</b> <b>panels</b> and an abstract tile pattern resembling a barcode at platform level distinguish the station from others in the system. The TTC built its first underground streetcar loop at this station circling an exceptionally spacious waiting area for connections to surface routes. Buskers often take advantage of the acoustics caused by the station's open architecture. Wilson is the one other station on the line which, due to its complexity, the TTC chose to design themselves.|$|R

5000|$|Taxicabs in Oman {{are usually}} with <b>Orange</b> <b>panels</b> and mostly models of Toyota or Nissan. The Number plate will be Red in colour & start with K, KA, KB ( [...] for saloon [...] ) and KK ( [...] for vans) They {{do not have}} any meters installed. Fare is {{generally}} decided by bargaining with the driver, though most commuters have a good idea of what can be considered a reasonable price. The rider may choose to have the taxi [...] "shared", or [...] "engaged." [...] In an engaged taxi, the driver will not take any more passenger (as opposed to a shared taxi). Usually drivers charge much more to have the taxi engaged, sometimes as much as 8-10 times the price of a shared taxi. In a shared taxi, the driver will usually get more people who need to go along the same way. Due to low costs of fuel and fairly high purchasing power parity in Oman, taxicabs are extremely cheap when compared {{to other parts of the}} world, even in the engaged mode.|$|R
5000|$|Other {{department}} stores appeared to rival Au Bon March√©: au Louvre in 1865; the Bazar de l'Hotel de Ville (BHV) in 1866, Au Printemps in 1865; La Samaritaine in 1870, and Galeries Lafayette in 1895.Between 1903 and 1907 the architect Frantz Jourdain created {{the interior and}} facades of the new building of La Samaritaine. He commissioned the decorative artist Eugene Grasset to create the huge inscription {{of the name of}} the store, against a floral background. He used an abundance of enameled tiles and a brightly colored interior and exterior, using yellow and <b>orange</b> <b>panels</b> to contrast with the vertical blue columns, which ended in a Gothic-inspired top story. The rectangular metal framework of the exterior was entirely covered and brightened with floral designs. The original 1907 structure had two towers with domes and spires, like a Chateau of the Loire; these were demolished when the store was enlarged toward the Seine in the 1920s. In the 1930s the architect Henri Sauvage updated the facade and replaced many Art Nouveau features with art deco elements.|$|R

500|$|At dawn on September 5 the North Koreans attacked. The {{engineers}} repulsed {{this attack}} but suffered some casualties. North Korean fire destroyed Vandygriff's radio, {{forcing him to}} use runners to communicate with Kennedy's command post. Ammunition was running low and three US C-47 Skytrain aircraft came over the area to make an airdrop. Kennedy put out <b>orange</b> identification <b>panels,</b> but the North Koreans put out similar panels. The planes circled, and finally dropped their bundles of ammunition and food on the North Korean positions. Immediately after the airdrops, two F-51 Mustang fighter planes came over and attacked D Company. The North Korean panels had misled both the cargo and fighter planes. The fighters dropped two napalm tanks within D Company's perimeter, but none there were injured. The planes then strafed right through the 2nd Platoon position, but again caused no casualties. Soon after this aerial attack, North Korean troops attacked the positions, and PPSh-41 [...] "burp gun" [...] fire wounded Kennedy in the leg and ankle.|$|R
50|$|The Ghia was {{the luxury}} model.

25|$|Since 1869 Sainsbury's used various fascias {{using the}} title 'J Sainsbury'. This was {{replaced}} in 1999 by simply: 'Sainsbury's'. The flagship store in Greenwich, South London, first trialled the new look, {{leading to the}} term 'Greenwich Blue', which was {{used to describe the}} signature colour of new identity. After its success most stores were refurbished with dark blue walls, bright <b>orange</b> wall <b>panels</b> and grey shelving, as well as new checkouts. Individual counters also had different, brightly coloured panels behind them. Gradually the format was rolled out across the entire Sainsbury's estate. The 'Greenwich Blue' look has been phased out and new stores now have a fresher look. Six years later another programme of refurbishment began, with the introduction of the new 'Try Something New Today' slogan. The entailed cream coloured shelving and checkouts, and a new aubergine-coloured staff uniform for all colleagues. Old external signage bearing the 'J Sainsbury' name was still to be found in use as recently as summer 2011 in Swindon, Ashbourne in Derbyshire and Blackheath, West Midlands.|$|R
50|$|The other {{aircraft}} {{involved in}} the accident was a Douglas C-47A Skytrain serial number CBK-28, belonging to the Turkish Air Force. The aircraft was built in 1944; {{at the time of}} the accident the aircraft had 2340 flight hours. The crew consisted of two pilots, (an instructor and a trainee), as well as a radio operator. The pilot-in command and instructor was 33 years old, was a pilot since May 1955 and had a total of 1,452 hours flying time on the C-47. The pilot in training was 22 years old and had a pilot's license since July 1962; he had 36 hours flying time on the C-47. On the day of the accident, CBK-28 was carrying out a training flight, which departed from Etimesgut Air Base. The trainee was sitting on left and wearing blue spectacles with an <b>orange</b> plexiglass <b>panel</b> in front of him on the left side of the windshield to prevent seeing outside as part of instrument training. The supervising instructor was on the right.|$|R
5000|$|The {{official}} state colors, colonial blue and buff, are {{designated by the}} Textile Color Card Association of the United States, Inc., New York, as [...] "arno blue" [...] (Cable No. 10663), and [...] "golden beige" [...] (Cable No. 10781) respectively; the color shades having been determined by Colorimetric Specifications of the National Bureau of Standards, United States Department of Commerce, in Test No. 2, 1/140565, dated November 18, 1954, which is on file with the Delaware Public Archives, Dover, Delaware. The colors of the coat of arms and {{other elements of the}} state flag shall be the following: Husbandman, trousers of gray brown, shirt of red, hat and hilling hoe of brown; rifleman, suit of green, binding, bag and leggings of buff, hat of brown, powder flask and feather of gray; shield, frame of shaded yellow, top <b>panel</b> of <b>orange,</b> center <b>panel</b> of blue, lower panel of white, ox of red brown, grass and corn of green, wheat and branches underfoot of yellow, heraldic wreath to be blue and silver (twisted); ship under full sail to have a dark hull and white sails; date, December 7, 1787, to be white; cord and tassels to be blue and gold.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} years, before {{the move to}} RAF Manston, the No. 1 AEF fleet was painted in an overall silver {{fuselage}} livery with distinctive yellow bands on the wings and the rear fuselage section which then evolved into an overall silver scheme with fluorescent <b>orange</b> dayglow <b>panels</b> (which faded quickly). This scheme further evolved into an overall grey fuselage with dayglow panels on the outer wings, fuselage and engine cowls of the then RAF Training Command. A local modification was approved to stick the last digit (in dayglow) of the aircraft serial number to {{the nose of the}} aircraft just below the spinner to aid [...] "front on" [...] early identification when on the ground. By the mid 70's the fleet was then painted in the red, white and grey [...] "Raspberry Ripple" [...] colour scheme of Training Command, with their [...] "flashing" [...] black and white props, which the aircraft retained until their retirement. In the final years at RAF Manston the aircraft sported the [...] "grey elephant on green shield" [...] emblem just forward of the front cockpit {{on both sides of the}} fuselage. At this time the aircraft also carried a tail identification number in orange dayglow which usually consisted of the last digit of the aircraft serial number or if that was ambiguous, the second to last digit was used.|$|R
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the testimony panels, the veterans also held open discussions on related subjects such as [...] "What We Are Doing to Vietnam", [...] "What We Are Doing to Ourselves", violations of international law, Prisoners of War, racism in the military, and also press censorship. Dr. Bert Pfeiffer of the University of Montana presented the first public testimony about the potential toxicity and health effects of the chemical Agent <b>Orange.</b> A special <b>panel</b> of psychiatrists was convened, {{many of whom had}} served in Vietnam, to discuss the impact of the war on American society. Midway through the hearings, the organizers insisted that no one make statements on behalf of the Vietnam veterans except for vets. It was presumed by reporters that this was to separate the participation of veterans from that of people like Mark Lane.|$|R
5000|$|The Convertriple was {{the basis}} for the 1975 [...] "Hang 10" [...] option. It was aimed at surfers in an attempt by Dodge {{marketers}} to better determine consumer preferences in a declining performance market. Hang ten is a surfing expression for balancing {{at the end of a}} surfboard with ten toes over the nose of the board while riding the wave. Available only in eggshell white exterior with a factory-installed sunroof, the car's fold-down rear seat permitted the loading of a surfboard through the trunk. The Hang 10 option continued the surfing theme with various colored stripe material accenting the white vinyl seats and door <b>panels.</b> <b>Orange</b> shag carpet covered the back of the fold-down rear seat while the dash and center console had orange accents. Red and blue exterior stripes started at the quarter panels with a wave-riding surfer graphic. A surfboard design ran down the center of the hood. Between the taillights, the stripe pattern fattened into surfboard-shaped letters that spelled out [...] "Hang 10".|$|R
5000|$|Based on the 75 ft M1, {{the early}} H-series cars {{improved}} on the design, notably by enlarging the operator's cab {{and using a}} single-handle controller. Revisions {{were made to the}} designs, and each production model in the H-series improved on the last. The H5s were the first subway cars in the TTC fleet to use [...] "chopper controls" [...] and were also the first cars with regenerative braking and air-conditioning systems. They had a brighter and more modern passenger interior. Black vinyl seats were replaced by red fabric seats. Individual seats replaced the padded bench seats used on previous models. The interior colour scheme consisted of red floors, cream walls, yellow doors and panels, and brown simulated wood grain panels. The H6s replaced the original red G-class cars and were used almost exclusively on the Bloor-Danforth line, with no further H-Series orders made. The H6s were similar to the H5s, but had light brown floors, and <b>orange</b> doors and <b>panels.</b> A prototype T-series car was built by UTDC in 1990-1991, and evaluated by the TTC. By the time the TTC was ready to order new cars in 1992, UTDC had been sold to Bombardier. Bombardier added new technology such as AC propulsion to a platform based on the predecessor H-cars.|$|R
500|$|Following the {{introduction}} of the Toronto Rocket subway trains on the Yonge‚ÄìUniversity‚ÄìSpadina and Sheppard lines, all of the T-1 series trains were transferred to the Bloor‚ÄìDanforth line where they replaced the remaining H-4 and H-6 series subway trains. The T-1s are now the only trains operating on the line. The remaining H-4 trains were retired from revenue service throughout the fall of 2011, and the last cars were decommissioned on January 27, 2012. They were the last version of TTC trains that were not equipped with air-conditioning systems (but instead used ceiling fans); they were also the last of which to be outfitted with larger orange upholstered bench seating and were mainly used on weekdays, most often during rush hour several years before their retirement. [...] The H-4s also had a similar interior design based from the H-2 subway cars. [...] The H-6 series trains (which had bright <b>orange</b> doors and <b>panels,</b> individual seats, along with light brown floors, cream walls and brown simulated wood grain panels) were retired from service between 2013 and 2014; the final run for the last H-6 series train took place on June 20, 2014. In the summer of 2016, a few TR trains were used on Line 2 because of an air conditioning malfunction in numerous individual T1 cars, combined with a hotter than average summer.|$|R
