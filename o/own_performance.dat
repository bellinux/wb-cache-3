5|$|Due to {{his ability}} to {{translate}} what is a complicated treatise into an easily readable and understandable prose for a beginner, Khoo's Sun Tzu series were well received and continue to grow in scope and depth in later years. He additionally manages to add realism by injecting real-life situations culled from his 15 years in management, that provoke much thought and encourage readers to assess their <b>own</b> <b>performance,</b> and take positive measures to become more effective in their workplace and interpersonal relationships.|$|E
5|$|Gaga grew up {{listening}} to artists such as the Beatles, Stevie Wonder, Queen, Bruce Springsteen, Pink Floyd, Mariah Carey, The Grateful Dead, Led Zeppelin, Whitney Houston, Elton John, Blondie, and Garbage, who have all influenced her music. Gaga's musical inspiration varies from dance-pop singers like Madonna and Michael Jackson to glam rock artists like David Bowie and Freddie Mercury, as well as the theatrics of the pop artist Andy Warhol and her <b>own</b> <b>performance</b> roots in musical theater. The singer has been compared to Madonna, who has said that she sees herself reflected in Gaga. Gaga says that she wants to revolutionize pop music like Madonna. Gaga has also cited heavy metal bands as an influence, including Iron Maiden and Black Sabbath. She credits Beyoncé as a key inspiration to pursue a musical career.|$|E
5|$|Once he {{was back}} in Egypt, Hargest was {{critical}} of Freyberg's conduct of the fighting on Crete in a meeting with General Archibald Wavell, commander of the Allied forces in the Middle East. He expressed similar views in a meeting with the New Zealand Prime Minister, Peter Fraser, who was in Egypt at the time on a visit to the New Zealand forces. He also voiced concern over what he considered to be a lack of consultation by Freyberg with his senior commanders. He was able to resolve his differences with Freyberg and in later correspondence with Fraser expressed his satisfaction with the way Freyberg dealt with his subordinates. Hargest's <b>own</b> <b>performance</b> on Crete escaped official scrutiny and he was awarded a bar to his DSO. He was also awarded the Greek War Cross for his services in the military campaigns in Greece and Crete.|$|E

5|$|Production {{began the}} {{following}} April, with Kurosawa in high spirits. Shooting lasted from June 1979 through March 1980 and was plagued with problems, {{not the least}} of which was the firing of the original lead actor, Shintaro Katsu—creator of the very popular Zatoichi character—due to an incident in which the actor insisted, against the director's wishes, on videotaping his <b>own</b> <b>performance.</b> (He was replaced by Tatsuya Nakadai, in his first of two consecutive leading roles in a Kurosawa movie.) The film was completed only a few weeks behind schedule and opened in Tokyo in April 1980. It quickly became a massive hit in Japan. The film was also a critical and box office success abroad, winning the coveted Palme d'Or at the 1980 Cannes Film Festival in May, though some critics, then and now, have faulted the film for its alleged coldness. Kurosawa spent much of the rest of the year in Europe and America promoting Kagemusha, collecting awards and accolades, and exhibiting as art the drawings he had made to serve as storyboards for the film.|$|E
5|$|Upon the {{commencement}} of the Second World War in September 1939, Hargest attempted to join the Second New Zealand Expeditionary Force being raised for service. His application was initially declined for health reasons, but after intervention by Peter Fraser, the acting Prime Minister of New Zealand, he was accepted and appointed commander of the 5th Infantry Brigade, part of the 2nd New Zealand Division. He led his brigade during the Battle of Greece in April 1941 after an initial period performing garrison duty in England. During the Battle of Crete he displayed poor judgement in the positioning his forces around the vital Maleme airfield and in controlling their movements once the battle commenced. The loss of the airfield allowed the Germans to gain a foothold {{on the island and}} the Allied forces eventually were evacuated from Crete. Despite his <b>own</b> <b>performance</b> during the battle, he received a bar to the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) that he had been awarded in the First World War. The fighting now shifting to North Africa, Hargest led his brigade during Operation Crusader in November 1941 but was captured by German forces. Held in a prisoner of war camp in Italy, he eventually escaped and was able to make his return to England in late 1943. He earned a second bar to his DSO for his efforts. He served as an observer with the British 50th Infantry Division for the Normandy landings in June 1944 and was killed by artillery just over two months later.|$|E

25|$|However, Pavarotti lip-synched his <b>own</b> <b>performance</b> because Leone Magiera, {{the maestro}} who {{conducted}} the aria, felt the cold weather {{made it difficult for}} Pavarotti, who was in pain from cancer treatment, to perform live.|$|E

25|$|If 1952 {{was a good}} {{season for}} Gimblett, {{then it was a}} poor one for his team. After several years in which the side had defied {{predictions}} and finished mid-table in the County Championship, Somerset fell to bottom place in 1952, and stayed there for four years. But Gimblett's <b>own</b> <b>performance</b> drew one of the game's accolades: in the 1953 edition of Wisden, he was named one of the Five Cricketers of the Year, alongside Tom Graveney, David Sheppard, Stuart Surridge and Fred Trueman.|$|E
25|$|Performers at {{previous}} Olympic {{opening ceremonies}} had occasionally synched to recordings of their <b>own</b> <b>performance,</b> {{such as the}} tenor Luciano Pavarotti at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, due to his pancreatic cancer. Then nine-year-old Eleonora Benetti also lip-synched to a previous recording of the Italian National Anthem. The Sydney Symphony Orchestra appeared to perform at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, but the music spectators heard was entirely pre-recorded, {{with some of the}} music pre-recorded by the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra.|$|E
60|$|There {{are many}} other Faults equal to these, as where Authors, through overmuch Timerity, or too great Opinion of their <b>own</b> <b>Performances,</b> permit their Writings to pass with egregious Errors; and I take it to be equally pernicious for a Man to be too diffident of his <b>own</b> <b>Performances,</b> {{as it is to}} be presuming: There are {{likewise}} some Gentlemen, who (by a lazy Disposition, or through over much Haste, an impatience in dispatch to gain an early Reputation) commit Blunders almost to their immediate Ruin; but many of these Errors are commonly excus'd in an Author by a condescending Printer, who is oblig'd to take the Errata upon himself.|$|R

25|$|Tung's {{reputation}} suffered {{further damage}} when Hu Jintao {{gave him a}} humiliating public dressing-down for poor governance in December 2004.

Tung himself denied it was a dressing-down, and insisted that he retained the central government's support, although he {{and the rest of}} the government were asked to examine their past inadequacies. Hu's words, however, were thinly veiled criticism. Nevertheless, in his January 2005 Policy Address, Tung gave a rather critical verdict on his <b>own</b> <b>performance.</b>|$|E
25|$|Finance {{should also}} be {{providing}} the information, analysis and advice to enable the organizations’ service managers to operate effectively. This goes beyond the traditional preoccupation with budgets – how much have we spent so far, {{how much do we}} have left to spend? It is about helping the organization to better understand its <b>own</b> <b>performance.</b> That means making the connections and understanding the relationships between given inputs – the resources brought to bear – and the outputs and outcomes that they achieve. It is also about understanding and actively managing risks within the organization and its activities.|$|E
