40|$|This {{report is}} built on a large primary data set for {{operational}} energy consumption and carbon footprint, collected from telecom operators in different countries, and complemented by publicly available data from other operators. The {{purpose of the study}} is to estimate the current magnitude and trends for the electricity consumption and <b>operational</b> <b>carbon</b> emissions of telecom operators globally, and the primary data was collected {{with the support of the}} Global e-Sustainability Initiative (GeSI) and the European Telecommunications Network Operators' Association (ETNO). In this report, the electricity consumption and <b>operational</b> <b>carbon</b> emissions of telecom operators are investigated, to calculate the ICT network (i. e. fixed and mobile telecom networks) operations´ share of the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector impact globally,  historically (2010 and 2013) as well as currently (2015). The study covers the ICT networks, defined as fixed and mobile telcom networks, and related operator activities, but excludes enterprise networks, data centers and end-user equipment. The study draws from a similar study of ICT in Sweden 2015 [1] and uses measured and collected data. End-user equipment is outside the scope of this study. Several other studies in the past predicted that the ICT sector, in particular the ICT networks, would increase its electricity consumption and <b>operational</b> <b>carbon</b> emissions in line with the growth in data traffic which was discussed in the previous study [1]. In the present study telecom operator data representing approximately 15 % of the global fixed subscriptions, 40 % of global mobile subscriptions and more than 35 countries in all regions except Oceania have been collected as input data. This represents a significant statistical foundation for further assessments and for extrapolation to the overall ICT networks. Approximately data for 10 % of the global fixed and mobile subscriptions have been collected directly from operators, the remaining dataset is based on publicly reported data by some of the world’s largest telecom operators.   The keyfindings of this study are: The total annual operational electricity consumption of the overall ICT networks globally is estimated to 242 TWh for 2015 including both grid (215 TWh) and on-site generated electricity (27 TWh). The total corresponds to 1. 15 % of the total electricity grid supply. The total annual <b>operational</b> <b>carbon</b> emissions of the ICT networks are estimated to 169 Mtonnes CO 2 e for 2015. This corresponds to 0. 53 % of the global carbon emissions related to energy (about 32 Gtonnes), or 0. 34 % of all carbon emissions (about 50 Gtonnes). Between 2010 and 2015 the electricity consumption of the ICT networks grew by 31 % from a level of 185 TWh which corresponded to 0. 97 % of the total electricity grid supply. During the same period the <b>operational</b> <b>carbon</b> emissions grew by 17 %. This could be compared to the increase in number of subscriptions from 6. 7 B to 9. 0 B during the same period. Per subscription, the average annual operational electricity consumption, including on-site generation, has decreased slightly from 27. 6 kWh to 27 kWh per subscription between 2010 and 2015. For the <b>operational</b> <b>carbon</b> emissions, the emissions per user have reduced from 21, 5 kg CO 2 e to 19 kg CO 2 e.   The annual emissions per subscriber of 19 kg CO 2 e corresponds to driving about 100 km on the highway including the fuel supply chain emissions. Seen in the light of earlier estimates this study shows a result which is 24 % lower than the <b>operational</b> <b>carbon</b> emissions estimated by the Smarter 2020 report for 2020. The result shows an approximately linear increase trend in annual electricity consumption and <b>operational</b> <b>carbon</b> emission. The fixed and broadband part is almost unchanged over time, so the increase is mainly associated with the expansion of mobile networks. Still the data traffic increase is in magnitude many times higher compared to the electricity consumption and <b>operational</b> <b>carbon</b> emission increase and the impact per subscription is actually decreasing in most cases. To understand the total ICT sector´s electricity consumption and <b>operational</b> <b>carbon</b> emissions, including all user equipment and the full life cycle, further studies are needed. However, this study brings a unique data set and insights regarding one of the key components – the operations of the network part of ICT.    QC 20180125 </p...|$|E
40|$|Climate {{change is}} one of the {{greatest}} environmental threats facing our civilization today. In the UK, carbon related to buildings amount to around half of the total greenhouse gas emissions. It is essential that we are able to accurately count carbon which is now increasingly being used as a metric of building environmental performance and energy efficiency. Following the rule that only measurable is manageable, quantifying carbon will serve as a basis for building environmental management and improvement. The aim of this paper is thus to review the concept of whole-life carbon in buildings and the different carbon estimating tools available. The research revealed that the total (whole-life) carbon emissions associated with a building from cradle-to-grave can be categorised into embodied and <b>operational</b> <b>carbon.</b> Whilst there are now formalised methods for measuring <b>operational</b> <b>carbon</b> due to its significance in whole-life carbon, there is still less emphasis on embodied carbon counting despite the rising need and importance.

40|$|There is {{potential}} to reduce both operational and embodied {{greenhouse gas emission}} from buildings. To date the {{focus has been on}} reducing the operational element, although given the urgency of carbon reductions, it may be more beneficial to consider upfront embodied carbon reductions.

It examines the relationship between embodied carbon (Ec) and <b>operational</b> <b>carbon</b> (Oc), the proportions of Ec from the structural and non-structural elements, carbon benchmarking of the structure, the value of ‘cradle to site’ or ‘cradle to grave’ assessments and the significance of the timing of emissions during the life of the building. The case study indicates that Ec was dominant for the building and that the structure was responsible {{for more than half of}} the Ec. Weighting of future emissions appears to be an important factor to consider. The PAS 2050 reduction factors had only a modest effect but weighting to allow for future decarbonisation of the national grid energy supply had a large effect.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{development}} of a tool used for the life cycle assessment of residential buildings located in three different European towns: Brussels (Belgium), Coimbra (Portugal) and Luleå (Sweden). The basic tool focuses on the structure and the materials of the buildings and permits the evaluation of the Embodied energy, Embodied carbon and yearly energy consumption. For that purpose, a different set of original data is taken into account for each location, in which the monthly temperatures, energy mix, heating and cooling systems are defined. The energy consumption, being for heating space or water, for cooling or for lighting is transformed into CO 2 emissions to deduce the <b>Operational</b> <b>carbon</b> as well. The influence of the energy mix can therefore be assessed in the basic tool. As a matter of fact, the heating and cooling systems habitually used in the three countries are also of great importance. The District Heating system, is, for instance, incorporated in the basic tool. The presence of solar water heater or photovoltaic panels is also strongly influencing the <b>operational</b> <b>carbon.</b> After a short literature review on building LCA and the description of the basic tool, the software Pleiades + Comfie combined with Equer is used to achieve the complete LCA for one building using two different load bearing frames.

40|$|We {{present an}} power systems {{optimisation}} model for national-scale power supply capacity expansion considering endogenous technology cost reduction (ESO-XEL). The mixed-integer linear program minimises total system cost while complying with <b>operational</b> constraints, <b>carbon</b> emission targets, and ancillary service requirements.

The consideration of cost learning effects moves optimal investment timings to earlier planning years and influences the competitiveness of technologies.

40|$|Buildings emit {{two types}} of carbon (and {{greenhouse}} gases) namely <b>Operational</b> <b>Carbon</b> (OC) and Embodied Carbon (EC). <b>Operational</b> <b>carbon</b> is regulated in the UK as it contributed up to 70 - 80 % of total emissions. On the other hand, EC started gaining attention {{with the rise of}} zero carbon buildings and {{due to the fact that}} the EC is unregulated at present. However, estimating EC is not completely standardised and there is room for improvement. EC can be controlled only by vigilant building designs. Studying building closely will provide better understanding of the carbon significant elements and enable designers to make informed decisions. Accordingly, a case study of an office building located in London in the UK is selected for the study. Capital cost (CC) and EC estimates were prepared using detailed cost plan of the building. Then, the building elements were classified as per NRM 1 (New Rules of Measurement 1) element classification and the most carbon and cost significant elements were identified in the case study building. Not all of the identified carbon significant elements are identified as cost significant but Substructure, Frame and Services are identified as both carbon and cost critical elements while Stairs and Ramps, Internal Doors and Fittings, Furnishings and Equipment were identified to be the least carbon and cost significant elements. Findings of the case study building inform designers about the elements that has a vast reduction potential and worth investing their time on experimenting.

40|$|Quantifying a {{detailed}} inventory of carbon emissions {{attributed to a}} retail building is of vital importance to minimize (or offset) their environmental impact. However, quantifying {{the environmental impact of}} a commercial building's operation has attracted great controversy regarding both the carbon fields considered within the building's operational boundaries and the different responsibility levels among participants. This paper details a robust framework on how businesses operating under UK policy can measure the <b>operational</b> <b>carbon</b> performance attributed to their buildings. Furthermore, the paper investigates how the quantified emissions can be offset in order to reach net zero carbon operational performance. The analysis is structured in three levels and its applicability is showcased through an industry-sourced example of a supermarket building. The first level aims to classify building emissions according to their sources namely electricity consumption, on-site fuel burning, water supply, transport operations and waste management & disposal. The developed carbon fields' analysis technique treats a commercial building as an on-going energy consuming system where different operations (e. g. transport activities) contribute to the building's commercial use as well as to its <b>operational</b> <b>carbon</b> footprint. In the second level, the study compares a food store's carbon footprint across different supply and operation scenarios in order to analyse how each sector can influence emissions. In the third stage, the research details the carbon off-setting achieved by installing a bioenergy combined heat and power (CHP) unit in its premises and thus achieving net zero carbon performance. Results illustrate the environmental benefits for different CHP capacity solutions. These results show how urban cogeneration plants can de-carbonise UK buildings. However, the UK carbon accounting framework is still evolving and therefore is constantly subject to regulatory changes. Consequently, business stakeholders need to be periodically updated with carbon regulation if they wish to design, manage and sustain zero carbon buildings...|$|E

As the most prevalent structural material, the embodied carbon of concrete is of paramount interest. Previous direct or indirect analyses of embodied carbon in concrete have treated it either as an elemental material with a value of single embodied carbon, or calculated embodied carbon for a limited range of reinforced concrete mix designs, or returned only values for plain concrete. In this paper, the results are presented from a preliminary study into the embodied carbon of reinforced concrete as a function of: concrete strength grade; steel strength; mix design; cement replacement; and structural form. Findings are expressed both in terms of ECraw (kgCO 2 /kg reinforced concrete) and ECf (kgCO 2 per unit of structural performance). They suggest that there is a wide range of ECraw (0 · 06 − 0 · 47) and that ECf is minimised by using C 50 concrete.

40|$|Analysis {{of lower}} carbon power systems {{has tended to}} focus on the <b>operational</b> <b>carbon</b> dioxide (CO 2) {{emissions}} from power stations. However, to achieve the large cuts required it is necessary to understand the whole-life contribution of all sectors of the electricity industry. Here, a preliminary assessment of the life cycle carbon emissions of the transmission network in Great Britain is presented. Using a 40 -year period and assuming a static generation mix it shows that the carbon equivalent emissions (or global warming potential) of the transmission network are around 11 Â gCO 2 -eq/kWh of electricity transmitted and that almost 19 times more energy is transmitted by the network than is used in its construction and operation. Operational emissions account for 96 % of this with transmission losses alone totalling 85 % and sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6) emissions featuring significantly. However, the CO 2 embodied within the raw materials of the network infrastructure itself represents a modest 3 %. Transmission investment decisions informed by whole-life cycle carbon assessments of network design could balance higher financial and carbon 'capital' costs of larger conductors with lower transmission losses and CO 2 emissions over the network lifetime. This will, however, necessitate new regulatory approaches to properly incentivise transmission companies. Carbon footprint Life cycle Transmission networks...|$|E
