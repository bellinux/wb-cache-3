40|$|Japanese {{encephalitis}} (JE), once a {{major public}} health problem in South Korea, has declined since the 1980 s, {{as a result of}} improved living conditions, a mosquito eradication program, and a national JE vaccination program, which includes annual booster vaccine for all children < 15 years of age. Increased immunity has greatly reduced illness and death; however, vaccine adverse effects are increasing, and a National Compensation Program for Vaccine Injury was begun in 1995.

40|$|Visceral {{leishmaniasis}} {{caused by}} the protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani complex is a potentially fatal disease if left untreated. Few treatment options exist and are toxic, costly and ineffective against resistant strains. Thus a safe and efficacious vaccine to combat this disease is needed. Previously, we reported that intraperitoneal administration of leishmanial antigens (LAg) entrapped in liposomes conferred protection to BALB/c mice against L. donovani challenge infection. However, this vaccine failed to protect mice when administered subcutaneously. We therefore evaluated whether formulation of LAg in combination with two commonly used human-compatible adjuvants, alum and saponin, could improve <b>the</b> protective efficacy <b>of</b> subcutaneously administered LAg, to a level comparable to that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intraperitoneal liposomal <b>vaccinatio...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: Realizing that {{influenza}} is {{an important}} health problem and that vaccination rates continue to be low, our primary survey goal was to find factors that affect patient compliance with the influenza immunization program at the Swedish Family Medicine Clinic in Seattle, Washington. Methods: Five hundred nineteen high-risk patients from a total clinic population of 4926 were mailed a questionnaire that asked about their influenza immunization history, their assessment of their influenza risk, and their reasons for obtaining or not obtaining the influenza vaccination. Results: The survey results revealed several important issues about this group: many patients {{were not aware of}} their increased risk for influenza; reminder letters were helpful, especially for older patients; younger high-risk patients were less likely to comply with immunization recommendations than older patients; and patients who were noncompliant with immunization recommendations in previous years would likely continue to be noncompliant. Conclusions: To improve influenza immunization rates, the following interventions are recommended: (1) reminder letters should be sent to patients at appropriate times to explain their risk factors, (2) younger high-risk patients should receive intensive education about <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> influenza immunization and why they are considered to be at increased risk, and (3) high-risk patients who have failed to obtain <b>the</b> <b>vaccinatio...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background. Hepatitis A {{vaccination}} {{is effective}} in preventing disease. However, <b>the</b> duration <b>of</b> protection after vaccination is unknown. Methods. We enrolled persons who responded to a 3 -dose primary series of hepatitis A vaccine. For adults, the first dosewas 720 ELISAunits (EU) of hepatitis A vaccine, readministered at 1 and 12 months after the first vaccination (hereafter, “ 0 - 1 - 12 months”); for children aged 3 – 6 years, the first dose was 360 EU, readministered according to 1 of 3 vaccination schedules: 1 and 2 months after the first vaccination (“ 0 - 1 - 2 months”), 1 and 6 months after the first vaccination (“ 0 - 1 - 6 months”), or 1 and 12 months after vaccination (“ 0 - 1 - 12 months”). Specimens collected 1 month and 1 – 10 years after vaccination were tested for antibody to hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) by ELISA. Long-term antibody persistence was estimated by using <b>the</b> observed rate <b>of</b> decline in geometric mean concentration (GMC). Results. A total of 144 children and 128 adults were enrolled. Children vaccinated at 0 - 1 - 2 months had a signif-icantly lower GMC of antibody than children vaccinated at 0 - 1 - 12 months, but this difference was statistically signif-icant only through 4 years of follow-up. All 67 children tested at 10 years and 25 (96 %) of 26 adults tested at 8 – 9 years had detectable anti-HAV. <b>The</b> estimated duration <b>of</b> antibody persistence was 21 – 27 years, depending on the vacci-nation schedule.
