Moreover, legislators condemned it as a luxury project that would benefit only the few wealthy enough to own cars; the Nazi Party was against public spending on highways for this reason, as were the Communists and the Reichsbahn, the German national railroad, which feared highways would take some of its freight business. Even the association of German car manufacturers did not support highway projects; they were concerned that long-distance driving would <b>overtax</b> their vehicles.|$|E
2500|$|Ibn Khaldun {{writes that}} civilizations have lifespans like individuals, {{and that every}} state will {{eventually}} fall because sedentary luxuries distract them, and eventually government begins to <b>overtax</b> citizens and begin injustice against property rights, and [...] "injustice ruins civilization."

Machiavelli has a similar notion of sedentary lifestyles, ozio, that corrupts the state, and argues that periodic wars rejuvenate a republic.|$|E

The sun shone upon her, glinting on the little head with its tangle of bright hair and the small, oval face with its pallor, and dark-blue eyes underlined by dark-blue circles. She looked at him and he looked at her. In that exchange of glances he imagined each saw the other in some different guise. It seemed impossible to Venters that this frail girl could be Oldring's Masked Rider. It flashed over him that he had made a mistake which presently she would explain.|$|E
