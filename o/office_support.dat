Also, analysts point out that Uribe is seen as a charismatic 24-hour workaholic and a promoter of personal and administrative austerity, which some interpret as a role model for other Colombians and politicians.|$|E

The smaller company was led by Tony Moraco, who beforehand was leading SAIC’s Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance group, and the bigger one was led by John P. Jumper. The split has allowed both companies to pursue more business, which it could not pursue as a single company due to conflicts of interest. In February 2013, it was announced that the smaller spin-off company would get the name [...] "Science Applications International Corporation" [...] and stay in the current headquarters, while the larger company would change its name to Leidos, (created by clipping the word kaleidoscope) and would move its headquarters to Reston.|$|E
