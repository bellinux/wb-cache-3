500|$|Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film 3 out of 4 stars, praising it as [...] "a skillfully {{assembled}} 130minutes at the movies, with actors {{capable of doing}} absurd things with straight faces, and action sequences that toy idly with the laws of physics", while Richard Corliss of Time considered it [...] "maybe the first great film of the post-human era". The New York Times said it deftly combined action and humor, stating [...] "The <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> won't be watching the screen is when your eyes have squeezed shut because you're laughing so hard." [...] The Telegraph appreciated the presence of Johnson and Diesel together, calling it a [...] "cosmic event", and added that director Lin had revitalized the series, saying [...] "the start and finish here, defying every imaginable law of physics, are series highs." [...] Empire also heaped praise on Johnson, saying [...] "How to re-ignite an ageing franchise? Drop [...] on it. The best thing, by far, in Fast Five ... Dwayne Johnson hulks through the movie leaving testosterone trails in his wake." [...] However, Empire took {{the view that the}} film itself was [...] "not, by any normal criteria, a good film", arguing that it was too long, although conceding that the action scenes, in particular the final car chase, made the film [...] "the most entertaining in the series." [...] Anna Smith of Time Out London also commented that the film was too long and criticized the simplistic characters and dialog, but she called the film [...] "slick" [...] and stated that these criticisms could be overlooked because [...] "it doesn't take itself too seriously." [...] Variety focused on the roles of Johnson and Diesel, lamenting the current lack of 1980s-style [...] "brawny" [...] leading men and of the [...] "manly men" [...] typical of the 1950s and 1960s, and calling their pairing [...] "a welcome injection of tough-guy vigor". Variety commented that, based on Fast Five, a [...] "sixth entry could be something worth waiting for". The New Yorker called the action scenes [...] "spectacular", praising director Lin by saying his [...] "direction and the sharp editing never confuse or lose momentum", but also found the film too long and criticized the dialog, labeling it [...] "subpar [...] Ocean's Eleven-style banter". [...] On the characters, The New Yorker considered Walker and Diesel [...] "serviceable", but singled out Johnson for praise for bringing a [...] "hip, comic knowingness to his role ... his enjoyment is infectious and keeps the movie speeding along." ...|$|E

After the race, Bowyer said he was [...] "sitting there seventh with 20 laps to go reeling them in thinking this was our day, and then a debris caution forces a restart (referencing the proceeding debris caution)." [...] He added that restarts are realistically [...] "the <b>only</b> <b>times</b> <b>you</b> can pass, so everyone was racing hard, and I got into the wall. It killed our day.” ...|$|R

If only the police and the army have guns, the government's going to do what they want. If people have guns, then we have a means to fight.".|$|E

5000|$|Why is Dillinger such {{an amazing}} bucker?

50|$|Furthermore, a suspensive potestative {{negative}} condition could {{be impossible to}} realise before {{the death of the}} person. For example: I will give you £10 unless you remarry.

This issue is resolved by the application of the cautio Muciana (attributed to Mucius Scaevola) which turned the suspensive, negative and potestative condition into a resolutive, affirmative and potestative one.|$|R

50|$|Sonsorolese has 5 vowels which are; /o/, /e/, /a/, /u/, and /i/. The vowels {{that are}} in the front for frontness are /i/, /e/, and /a/. The back frontness vowels are /u/ and /o/. As for the height of the vowels, /i/ and /u/ is high, /e/ and /o/ is mid, and /a/ is low. There are many {{exceptions}} to the vowel usage depending on where the vowel is placed and the consonants used before and after the vowel. The vowel /i/ sometimes is drawn back in frontness, which produces a different sound. /E/ is considered as a chiefly vowel and is rare. The <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> will see the vowel used is when it is in the body of a word. The vowel /a/ developed a velar fricative that involves either a /x/ or /y/ in front of the vowel. /O/ is mostly used in diphthongs and a variety of French influenced words. And lastly the vowel /u/ is to lip-round the word that is being pronounced.|$|E

The last one is a riding hall from the time of romanticism, which was built in 1830. It is the second largest riding hall in Central Europe, right after the Viennese riding hall.
