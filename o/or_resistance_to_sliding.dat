Moreover, the influence of bracket slot surface roughness on friction was estimated. MethodsConventional, active and passive self-ligating brackets were coupled with 0. 016 in. × 0. 022 in. stainless steel or nickel-titanium archwires at 0 ° or 5 ° of tipping for evaluating maximum <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>sliding.</b> An optical 3 -dimensional micro coordinate system was used to assess roughness characteristics of slot surface. <b>Resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>sliding</b> data was subjected to Kruskal–Wallis, Mann–Whitney and Student's t-test (α= 0. 05). Spearman correlation was performed to statistical dependence evaluation. ResultsStatistically significant higher <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>sliding</b> is observed in conventional brackets comparing to self-ligating brackets. No statistically significant differences were found between passive and active types and between archwire alloys at 0 ° angulations. At 5 °, stainless steel showed statistically significant higher <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>sliding.</b> No statistically significant differences were found between 0 ° and 5 ° of bracket tipping. The correlation between surface roughness and <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>sliding</b> was not statistically significant. ConclusionsSelf-ligating brackets appear to have an advantage regarding low frictional forces comparing to conventional brackets. Slight bracket angulations or tooth tipping may not have a significant influence on <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>sliding</b> although different alloys may exhibit dissimilar frictional behavior. It remains unclear if developing smooth slot surfaces should be a concern for manufacturers...|$|R
40|$|Friction, binding and {{notching}} are {{the factors}} that contribute <b>to</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>sliding</b> during orthodontic tooth movement. However, most attempts at reducing <b>resistance</b> aim only <b>to</b> reduce the archwire/ligature friction. In this study, a novel bracket with a unique design aimed to reduce all three components of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>sliding.</b> Four types of brackets (passive and active self-ligating, traditionally ligated and the novel bracket, (n= 5, each) were tested at 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 ᵒ of tip on a 0. 019 x 0. 025 ”archwire. The <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>sliding</b> values were recorded. At 0 ᵒ, the passive self-ligating and novel bracket showed reduced <b>resistance</b> when compared <b>to</b> the traditionally ligated bracket (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). At the other angles of tip, no differences were observed among the brackets. These {{data suggest that the}} novel bracket could potentially decrease the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>sliding</b> during orthodontic treatment and further studies are indicated to test the improved bracket design...|$|R
30|$|Several {{studies have}} also been carried out to {{elucidate}} the causes and effects of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>sliding</b> in the passive configuration. Wire alloy, bracket material, surface modification, and roughness have been investigated[2, 12, 18 – 27], revealing that as the angle between the bracket and the archwire increases, the clearance between the archwire and the bracket slot is reduced. In this situation, binding occurs and in turn influences <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>sliding,</b> creating an active configuration[15, 28]. The active configuration itself, however, has received considerably less attention.|$|R
40|$|Statement of the Problem: Frictional {{forces are}} {{considered}} as important counter-force to orthodontic tooth movement. It is claimed that self-ligating brackets reduce the frictional forces. Purpose: The {{aim of this}} study was <b>to</b> compare the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>sliding</b> in metallic and clear Damon brackets with the conventional brackets in a wet condition. Materials and Method: The samples included 4 types of brackets; metallic and clear Damon brackets and metallic and clear conventional brackets (10 brackets in each group). In this study, stainless steel wires sized 0. 019 × 0. 025 were employed and the operator’s saliva was used to simulate the conditions of oral cavity.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} if the type of ligation influences the frictional resistance between stainless steel wire and brackets when the wire is subjected to repeated vertical displacements. Methods: Eight different types of ligation were used to secure a length of stainless steel wire in three stainless steel twin brackets. The wire was subjected to repeated vertical displacements in a simulated extraction space. Eighty per cent of the minimum force required to overcome static friction (F-m) between the wire and brackets {{was applied to the}} wire for eight minutes and any sliding measured. Results: Frictional <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>sliding</b> was least when stainless steel ligatures twisted in a figure 8 pattern until taut then untwisted one quarter turn were used, and greatest when elastomeric modules in a figure 8 pattern (EM 8) were used. The F-m difference between fully engaged standard and Super Slick elastomeric modules was significantly different (p = 0. 007). The frictional <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>sliding</b> fell when the wire was secured with either of these two methods and subjected to vertical displacement loads. There {{was no significant difference in}} the rate of wire movement between these modules. Conclusion: Repeated vertical displacement reduced the frictional <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>sliding</b> for all methods of ligation except EM 8. The stainless steel twist ligatures demonstrated the lowest frictional <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>sliding.</b> Nathawut Sirisaowaluk, Olena Kravchuk and Christopher T. C. Ho[URL]...|$|R

Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study is to compare, in vitro, the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>sliding</b> {{generated}} by conventional, active self-ligating and passive self-ligating brackets with stainless steel and nickel-titanium wires and to evaluate the effect of binding upon <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>sliding</b> In addition <b>to</b> this, the influence of bracket´s slot surface characteristics on measured friction was estimated. Materials and Methods: The following 0, 022 inch slot brackets were essayed: Damon® Q™, Prodigy SL™ (Sybron Dental Specialties Ormco™, Orange, California, USA), Smart-Clip™SL 3, Victory Series™ (3 M Unitek Orthodontic Products, Monrovia, California, USA), Morelli® Roth Standard and Morelli® Roth SLI (Morelli Ortodontia, Sorocaba, São Paulo, Brazil). These brackets were coupled with either 0. 016 x 0. 022 inch stainless steel (Dentaurum GmbH, Ispringen, Germany) or nickel-titanium (DM Ceosa, Madrid, Spain) archwires. Alicona InfiniteFocus® optical 3 -dimensional micro coordinate system (Alicona Imaging GmbH, Grambach/Graz, Austria) and Alicona IFM version 3. 5. 1. 5 software (Alicona Imaging GmbH, Grambach/Graz, Austria) were used for assessing roughness average, root mean square and mean peak to valley height of roughness profile of slot surface. For Damon brackets, a slot profile analysis was executed in order to evaluate the contact areas between bracket and archwire Results: Statistically significant higher <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>sliding</b> is observed in conventional brackets comparing to passive and active self-ligating brackets. No statistically significant differences were found between passive and active self-ligating brackets and between archwire materials in 0 degrees angulations. For 5 degrees angulations, stainless steel showed statistically significant higher <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>sliding.</b> No statistically significant differences in <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>sliding</b> were found between 0 and 5 degrees of bracket tipping. Higher values of roughness average and root mean square were correlated with friction forces lower than 3 N while lower roughness values were associated with higher frictional forces. In Damon brackets, the embossed numbers in the slot are not likely to contact with the archwire since they are approximately 5. 5 μm lower than the lateral boxes. Conclusion: Self-ligating brackets are helpful for obtaining low frictional forces. When coupled with a small rectangular archwire, slight bracket angulations or tooth tipping may not influence <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>sliding.</b> However, different alloys reveal dissimilar frictional behavior when angulations are present.

Materials and methods: All brackets had a 0. 022 inch slot and the orthodontic wire alloys were of 0. 019 × 0. 025 inch dimension. All the tests were performed on the Lloyd universal testing machine.

This systematic review aims to give an overview of studies evaluating the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>sliding</b> in orthodontics {{in relation to the}} impact of related parameters such as material properties, ligation force, etc. Search Method: An unlimited electronic search was performed in three data bases (PubMed, Web of Science and Grey Literature Report), including all studies published until the 26 th of March 2015. In addition, a manual search was performed of all reference lists to detect any study that could have been missed by the electronic search. Selection criteria: Studies that addressed a measurable correlation between friction or RS and other parameters were selected and reviewed. Results: The electronic search resulted in a list of 1420 non-duplicate studies. In addition, 9 more were selected by manual search. Only 245 studies were considered eligible after applying the selection criteria.

Also, <b>to</b> establish if there is reduced <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>sliding</b> using the extraoral tube (EOT) on molar bands opposed to the straight wire tube when using a TPA or Nance- palatal arch with rotated molars Materials and method: A custom made experimental apparatus approximating the transpalatal arch, allowing for 1 -degree incremental changes to molar rotation was designed. A 0. 019 x 0. 025 ” stainless steel archwire was displaced through the molar tubes to determine the effect of molar rotation on <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>sliding,</b> determined as work. Unilateral and bilateral palatal rotations were evaluated as well as comparison of the extraoral and straight wire tube. Results: The work required to achieve a constant archwire displacement was significantly increased for bilaterally, palatally rotated molars compared with a unilateral rotation (p< 0. 05 for displacement of both 0. 5 and 0. 1 mm). Pearson correlation analysis identified a significant association between extent of molar rotation and difference in work between unilateral and bilateral rotated molars (p-value 0. 002 and 0. 01 for displacement of 0. 5 and 0. 1 mm respectively). Placement of the archwire in the extraoral tube significantly reduced the work required for a fixed displacement compared with the straight wire tube. The magnitude of the effect was greatest for bilateral palatal rotated molars and was highly significant (p < 0. 001 for 0. 5 mm). Conclusion: The relationship between work and molar rotation was found to be non-linear, with an exponential increase in work with increasing palatal rotations. Bilaterally, palatally rotated molars resulted in a significantly increased amount of work for all amounts of displacement of the archwire compared with a unilateral rotation.

40|$|As {{a simple}} {{theoretical}} {{model of a}} cell adhering to a biological interface, we consider a rigid cylinder moving in a viscous shear flow near a wall. Adhesion forces arise through intermolecular bonds between receptors on the cell and their ligands on the wall, which form flexible tethers that can stretch and tilt as {{the base of the}} cell moves past the wall; binding kinetics is assumed to follow a standard model for slip bonds. By introducing a finite <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> bond tilting, we use our model to explore the territory between previous theoretical models that allow for either zero <b>or</b> infinite <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> bond rotation. A microscale calculation (for two parallel sliding plates) reveals a nonlinear force–speed relation arising from bond formation, tilting and breakage. Two distinct types of macroscale cell motion are then predicted: either bonds adhere strongly and the cell rolls (or tank treads) over the wall without slipping, or the cell moves near its free-stream speed with bonds providing weak frictional <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>sliding.</b> The model predicts bistability between these two states, implying that at critical shear rates the system can switch abruptly between rolling and free sliding, and suggesting that sliding friction arising through bond tilting may play a significant dynamical role in some cell-adhesion applications...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} if American Orthodontics 2 ̆ 7 (AO) new, experimental ligature demonstrates less friction in vitro {{when compared to}} four other ligatures on the market. Methods: Four brackets were mounted on a custom metal fixture allowing an 0. 018 -in stainless steel wire attached to an opposite fixture with one bracket to be passively centered in the bracket slot. The wire was ligated to the bracket using one of five types of ligatures including the low friction test ligatures (AO), conventional ligatures (AO), Sili–TiesTM, Silicone Infused Ties (GAC), Synergy® Low-Friction Ligatures (RMO), and SuperSlick ligatures (TP Orthodontics). <b>Resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>sliding</b> was measured over a 7 mm sliding distance using a universal testing machine (Instron) with a 50 Newton load cell and a crosshead speed of 5 mm/min. The initial <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>sliding</b> (static) {{was determined by the}} peak force needed to initiate movement and the kinetic <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>sliding</b> was taken as the force at 5 mm of wire/bracket sliding. Fifteen unique tests were run for each ligature group in both dry and wet (saliva soaked for 24 hours with one drop prior to testing) conditions. Results: In the dry state, the SuperSlick ligature demonstrated more static friction than all of the other ligatures, while SuperSlick and Sili–Ties demonstrated more kinetic friction than the AO conventional, AO experimental and Synergy ligatures. In the wet condition, SuperSlick and the AO experimental ligature demonstrated the least static friction, followed by the AO conventional and Sili–Ties. The most static friction was observed with the Synergy ligatures. In the wet condition, the SuperSlick, AO experimental and AO conventional exhibited less kinetic friction than the Sili-Ties and Synergy ligatures. Conclusions: AO 2 ̆ 7 s experimental ligature exhibits less friction in the wet state than conventional ligatures, Sili–Ties and Synergy and is comparable to the SuperSlick ligature. These preliminary results suggest that the AO experimental ligature and the SuperSlick ligature create less friction, but direct conclusions regarding in vivo performance cannot be made and randomized controlled clinical trials are needed to {{determine if}} these ligatures have clinical significance in treatment efficiency...|$|R
