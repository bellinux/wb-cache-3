5|$|The Brazilian {{constitution}} of 1988 {{called for a}} general vote on {{the restoration of the}} monarchy, which was held in 1993. The royalists went to the polls divided, with the press indicating there were actually two princes aspiring to the Brazilian throne (Dom Luiz de Orleans e Bragança and Dom João Henrique); this created some confusion among the voters. Voting tickets further divided the electorate by placing <b>one</b> <b>box</b> for a presidential republic on the ballot and four for a monarchy. Additional anti-monarchial sentiment was generated by several aggressive television commercials claiming that a vote for monarchy would be a vote for the return of slavery for blacks and a loss of Brazil's recent return to democracy after decades of military dictatorship. This result was a loss for the monarchists at the polls.|$|E
