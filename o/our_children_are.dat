2500|$|President Obama {{nominated}} Arne Duncan on December 16, 2008 {{to be his}} Secretary of Education. In {{a prepared}} statement Obama praised Duncan's skills stating [...] "For Arne, school reform isn’t just a theory in a book – it’s {{the cause of his}} life. And the results aren’t just about test scores or statistics, but about whether <b>our</b> <b>children</b> <b>are</b> developing the skills they need to compete with any worker in the world for any job." ...|$|E
2500|$|They {{shared a}} concern about recent {{developments}} in children's literature and society's attitudes towards children. They felt that older children's literature had been moving closer to adult literature, and that the book had taken them [...] "further than [...] ever been taken before" [...] towards that end. They {{felt it necessary to}} address [...] "meaningful violence" [...] and [...] "the strongest of human passions" [...] in the novel, because these were [...] "the preoccupations with which <b>our</b> <b>children</b> <b>are,</b> we know, at the moment filled." ...|$|E
5000|$|Forest for <b>Our</b> <b>Children</b> <b>was</b> the Trust's first Community-owned WildSpace project.

Based near the Trust's headquarters in Lawshall, Forest for <b>Our</b> <b>Children</b> <b>is</b> 9 hectares of land made up of 2 woods in the parish. Crooked Wood was planted in 1993 and Golden Wood between 1994 and 2010.|$|R

2500|$|Also in Sister Outsider is [...] "The Transformation of Silence into Language and Action.*" [...] Lorde {{discusses}} {{the importance of}} speaking, even when afraid because one's silence will not protect them from being marginalized and oppressed. [...] Many people fear {{to speak the truth}} because of how it may cause pain, however, one ought to put fear into perspective when deliberating whether to speak or not. [...] Lorde emphasizes that [...] "the transformation of silence into language and action is a self-revelation, and that always seems fraught with danger." [...] People are afraid of others' reactions for speaking, but mostly for demanding visibility, which is essential to live. [...] Lorde adds, [...] "We can sit in our corners mute forever while our sisters and ourselves are wasted, while <b>our</b> <b>children</b> <b>are</b> distorted and destroyed, while our earth is poisoned; we can sit in our safe corners mute as bottles, and we will still be no less afraid." [...] People are taught to respect their fear of speaking more than silence, but ultimately, the silence will choke us anyway, so we might as well speak the truth.|$|E

60|$|My refusal led those sons of dogs {{to attempt}} to frighten my wife with threats of unmentionable horrors unless she {{delivered}} up the papers I had secreted. She and <b>our</b> <b>children</b> <b>were</b> threatened with perpetual imprisonment on bread and water if she persisted in refusing to surrender them. But she held out against all threats, and remained firm even under the oily persecution to the same end of Philip's confessor, Frey Diego. Finally, I was notified that, in view of her stubbornness and my own, she and <b>our</b> <b>children</b> <b>were</b> cast into prison, and that there they would remain until I saw fit to become submissive to the royal will.|$|R

6000|$|That is {{just the}} case. The new Territories are the newly made bed to which <b>our</b> <b>children</b> <b>are</b> to go, and it lies with the nation to say whether they shall have snakes mixed up with them or not.

60|$|Mrs. Macallan's {{house in}} London offered us ample accommodation. We gladly availed {{ourselves}} of her proposal, when she {{invited us to}} stay with her until <b>our</b> <b>child</b> <b>was</b> born, and <b>our</b> plans for the future were arranged.|$|R
6000|$|... “That’s all right,” Clay rejoined, {{dropping}} {{his hand on}} the other’s arm in a friendly manner. “We certainly can’t afford to quarrel, and I don’t know that it’s unfortunate <b>our</b> <b>children</b> <b>are</b> more fastidious than we are. Anyway, we don’t want them to find us out. I’d feel mean if my son disowned me.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The children," [...] said Mrs. Kenton, {{wishing to}} be {{justified}} further, [...] "think {{she ought to}} have had a chaperon. I didn't think of that; it isn't the custom at home; but Lottie was very saucy about it, and I had to send Boyne to bed. I don't think <b>our</b> <b>children</b> <b>are</b> very much comfort to us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So we have {{no reason}} to regret the past, cousin, and on that score you have no cause for grief.

6000|$|... "Well may I be shaken," [...] I replied, [...] "happy as I <b>am.</b> <b>Our</b> <b>child</b> <b>is</b> dead, and {{the present}} hour is dark and ominous. Well may I tremble! but, I am happy, mine own Idris, most happy." ...|$|R
5000|$|Any {{person who}} is not working through God is always selfish. If anybody claims, [...] "I love somebody," [...] and does not have this love {{connected}} from God, then it is not real love. It cannot be. It is impossible. ...The mind has only selfish love, selfish connections, selfish feelings—and no real love at all. That is how all the people at every level (in this world) are operating. However, the love we have for <b>our</b> <b>children</b> <b>is</b> not mental love. The love we have for <b>our</b> <b>children</b> <b>is</b> an arrangement of nature from God. But once the <b>children</b> <b>are</b> grown up, then that special system of love that was arranged by God is taken away, and again we have only the system of selfish exchange.|$|R

6000|$|He {{thought in}} silence for a time, oddly {{regardless}} of her. [...] "But if it was not you," [...] he said, staring at the fireplace with knitted brows, [...] "if I did not love you.... Thank God, I love you, dear! Thank God, <b>our</b> <b>children</b> <b>are</b> love children! I want to live--to my finger-tips, but if I didn't love you--oh! love you! then I think now--I'd be glad--I'd be glad, I think, to cheat life of her victory." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sacrifice"! said Mrs. Ferguson. [...] "How can we? <b>Our</b> <b>children</b> <b>are</b> our new life. We live in them a {{thousand}} times more than we could in ourselves. No, I think a mother that doesn't {{take care of her}} own baby misses the greatest happiness a woman can know. A baby isn't a mere animal; and it is a great and solemn thing to see the coming of an immortal soul into it from day to day. My very happiest hours have been spent with my babies in my arms." ...|$|E
5|$|Save <b>Our</b> <b>Children</b> <b>was</b> {{the first}} {{organized}} {{opposition to the}} gay rights movement, whose beginnings were traced to the Stonewall riots in 1969. The defeat of the ordinance encouraged groups in other cities to attempt to overturn similar laws. In the next year voters in St. Paul, Minnesota, Wichita, Kansas, and Eugene, Oregon overturned ordinances in those cities, sharing {{many of the same}} campaign strategies that were used in Miami. Save <b>Our</b> <b>Children</b> <b>was</b> also involved in Seattle, Washington, where they were unsuccessful, and heavily influenced Proposition 6—a proposed state law in California that would have made the firing of openly gay public school employees mandatory—that was rejected by California voters in 1978.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Unhurt, Eustacie! <b>Our</b> <b>child</b> <b>is</b> unhurt!' Berenger said, with an agonized {{endeavour}} to be calm; but for {{the moment}} her instinct was so entirely absorbed in examining into the soundness of her child's limbs, that she neither saw nor hear anything else.|$|R
40|$|THEY {{say that}} each <b>child</b> <b>is</b> {{born on a}} white sheet of paper [...] . it is how we colour the paper that shapes the child's character.

6000|$|Maria turned very red: she {{had said}} not more than she meant, but more than she meant to say. [...] "My dear Colonel, how hot we are! how angry you Indian gentlemen become with us poor women! Your boy is much older than mine. He lives with artists, {{with all sorts of}} {{eccentric}} people. <b>Our</b> <b>children</b> <b>are</b> bred on quite a different plan.

I told you, before, the views I had regarding the boys: but it was most kind of you to think of them--most generous and kind." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Our</b> <b>children</b> <b>are</b> {{being led}} to ruin by this system. They will become dons and think in Greek. The {{victim of the}} craze stops at nothing. He puns in Latin.

Think, I beg of you, paterfamilias, and you, mater ditto, what your {{feelings}} would be were you to find Henry or Archibald Cuthbert correcting proofs of The Agamemnon, and inventing 'nasty ones' for Mr Sidgwick! Very well then. Be warned.|$|E
60|$|You {{know how}} {{pleasing}} in our eyes {{the actions of}} <b>our</b> <b>children</b> <b>are,</b> when {{we know that they}} do what they do even of a reverent fear and awe of us; yea, though that which they do amounts but to little, we take it well at their hands, and are pleased therewith. The woman that cast in her two mites into the treasury, cast in not much, for they both did but make one farthing; yet how doth the Lord Jesus trumpet her up,[22] he had pleasure in her, and in her action (Mark 12:41-44). This, therefore, that the Lord taketh pleasure in them that fear him, is another of their great privileges.|$|E
