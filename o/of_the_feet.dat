MethodsWe studied 52 patients who underwent surgical treatment for cutaneous melanoma <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> from September 2000 to January 2015. Through a retrospective review of their medical records, we collected data relating to their sex, age, histopathological subtype, Clark level, tumor thickness, lymph node involvement, stage, and survival rate, and we compared these parameters to those of 61 patients treated for melanoma of other sites. Moreover, we analyzed the surgical procedures, complications, and mortality rates associated with cutaneous melanoma on various parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot.</b> ResultsMelanoma <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> differed from other melanomas only in the histopathological subtype. Other clinical features, including survival rate, did not differ significantly between the two groups heel was the most common site <b>of</b> melanoma <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> (22 cases, 42. 3 %). <b>The</b> method <b>of</b> reconstruction varied depending on the region involved. ConclusionsA comparison <b>of</b> melanoma <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> to other melanomas showed that melanoma <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> was associated with a significantly different distribution of histological subtypes. Consistent with previous findings, we found that the acral lentiginous subtype was the most common among melanomas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot.</b> Furthermore, in contrast with previous studies, we did not find a worse prognosis or lower survival rate for melanoma <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> in comparison with other melanomas...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background: Understanding <b>the</b> biomechanical {{function}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{normal human}} <b>foot</b> is essential so {{to be able}} to determine <b>the</b> parameters <b>of</b> what is <b>the</b> abnormal or pathological <b>foot.</b> <b>The</b> current model used in podiatry to describe the normal biomechanical function and assessment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> presents many key difficulties. Such as the poor reliability and questionable validity <b>of</b> many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> examinations used in <b>the</b> assessment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> and <b>the</b> incorrect assumption that all normal feet will display exactly the same biomechanical function during walking. Although technological advancements in gait analysis have improved our understanding of foot biomechanics this new information has not yet not yet significantly changed clinical practice. Objectives: <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> this investigation was a. Derive a consensus on what podiatrists currently use for conducting a static biomechanical assessment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot,</b> b. To test the Root et al (1971, 1977) description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> during gait cycle and c. To determine if the measurements obtained from a static biomechanical assessment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> as described by Root et al (1971, 1977) can predict <b>the</b> movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> during <b>the</b> gait cycle. Methods: Data was collected from 100 asymptomatic participants and included a static biomechanical assessment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> developed from <b>the</b> consensus agreement in part a. and <b>the</b> measurement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three dimensional kinematic function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> during <b>the</b> gait cycle using a six segment foot model. XVI Results: The results indicate that there is a large variation in <b>the</b> kinematic function <b>of</b> <b>feet</b> during walking and <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> a static biomechanical assessment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> cannot predict <b>the</b> dynamic function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot.</b> Conclusions: This suggests that <b>the</b> key principles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> current model used to describe <b>the</b> biomechanical function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> normal <b>foot</b> in podiatry are incorrect and the methods used by podiatrists in clinical practice are not valid...|$|R
5|$|Heart {{failure is}} where the heart can't beat out enough blood {{to meet the needs}} of the body. It is {{generally}} a chronic condition, associated with age, that progresses gradually. Each side of the heart can fail independently of the other, resulting in heart failure of the right heart or the left heart. Left heart failure can also lead to right heart failure (cor pulmonale) by increasing strain on the right heart. If the heart is unable to pump sufficient blood, it may accumulate throughout the body, causing breathlessness in the lungs (pulmonary congestion; pulmonary edema), swelling (edema) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> or other gravity-dependent areas, decrease exercise tolerance, or cause other clinical signs such as an enlarged liver, cardiac murmurs, or a raised jugular venous pressure.

5|$|Ordinary {{smallpox}} generally {{produced a}} discrete rash, {{in which the}} pustules stood out on the skin separately.

Sometimes, the blisters merged into sheets, forming a confluent rash, which began to detach the outer layers of skin from the underlying flesh.

5|$|Other {{studies by}} Taylor find that all {{tetrapods}} appear {{to hold their}} necks at the maximum possible vertical extension when in a normal, alert posture; they argue the same would hold true for sauropods barring any unknown, unique characteristics that set the soft tissue anatomy of their necks apart from that of other animals. Apatosaurus, like Diplodocus, would have held its neck angled upwards with the head pointing downwards in a resting posture. Kent Stevens and Michael Parrish (1999 and 2005) state Apatosaurus had a great feeding range; its neck could bend into a U-shape laterally. The neck's range of movement would have also allowed the head to feed at the level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>feet.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{blunt and}} short claws of Deinocheirus {{are similar to}} those of the therizinosaur Alxasaurus, which {{indicates}} the long arms and claws were used for digging and gathering plants. The blunt claws <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> could have helped the animal from sinking into substrate when wading. The robust hind limbs and hip region indicates the animal moved slowly. The large size of the animal may have helped it against predators such as Tarbosaurus, but in turn it lost the running ability of other ornithomimosaurs. The long neural spines and possible tail fan may have been used for display behaviour. Deinocheirus was likely diurnal (active during the day), since the sclerotic rings of the eyes were relatively small in comparison with its skull length. The hand had good mobility relative to the lower arm, but was capable of only a limited flexing motion, unable to close in grasping.|$|E

This means that the patient is placing his/her weight on <b>the</b> medial border <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot,</b> and <b>the</b> arch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> is absent, which distorts <b>the</b> <b>foot's</b> normal shape.Mainly occurs due to tightness of plantar flexors (calf muscles) and peroneus group of muscles.|$|R
