50|$|This station, {{which is}} 120 ft below the surface, has four {{elevators}} and a footbridge connecting the two side platforms {{at the northern}} end of the station. When the station opened on May 30, 1906, there had only been two elevators on the station's east side, but in 1909, two more elevators were added to the west side.

50|$|Until 2012 {{the line}} {{retained}} its historic characteristics, with well preserved stations, semaphore signalling and, until spring 2009, lineside telegraph poles, along with sections of jointed rail on wooden sleepers. However, the two-stage Ely-Norwich re-signalling programme in August and December 2012 involved {{the closure of}} the nine local mechanical signal boxes and removal of the seven sets <b>of</b> <b>manually-operated</b> wooden gates at level crossings. The Cambridge signal box now controls the modern electronic interlockings which operate the lightweight LED signals, while the level crossings have been fully automated with barriers and warning lights.|$|R
40|$|A JASSA {{evaluation}} <b>of</b> <b>manually-operated</b> {{peanut butter}} mills in Zimbabwe. Previous {{studies showed that}} the manually-operated peanut butter mills available on the market had technical problems related to the design and <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> the machines. One such {{problem was that the}} mills were too heavy for women to operate, resulting in limited operational time and ultimately, low total output. An ergonomic study of the original and modified versions of the mills was conducted at the University of Zimbabwe to verify the previously identified problems and develop appropriate and lighter mills for manual operation. A body discomfort assessment and heart rate measurement were used to determine stress endured by 12 women, as a result of operating the mills. Medium to high levels of discomfort were experienced in the lower back, neck, chest, lower arm, upper arm and shoulder. The heart rate readings showed that the mills currently available on the market were highly stressful (138 beats/minute), exceeding guidelines for safe manual operations. The modified mills, incorporating variable feed control devices, can be adjusted to ensure that stress levels are within recommended levels. The ergonomic study also established that for feed rates of 1. 1 and. 1. 5 kg/hour, the mills produce peanut butter of acceptable fineness to the subjects, in one pass without over stressing the operator. In a separate field experiment using the same subjects, extremely high stress levels (150 beats/minute) were recorded with the traditional stone-mill...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the monitoring {{results of a}} field experiment conducted {{over the course of}} one year in two side-by-side occupied offices to investigate the impact of various configurations <b>of</b> <b>manually-operated</b> venetian blinds on the performance of a commercial photocontrolled continuous dimming lighting control system. The performance indicators considered were the electric energy consumption and the space illumination as a function of blind slat angle and retraction area. The results showed that under clear sky and with no blinds the lighting control system reduced the lighting consumption on average by 50 to 60 % when compared to lights fully on from 6 AM to 6 PM. These savings were however, reduced by 5 to 45 % based on the window blinds' configuration tested. The impact of the blinds on the lighting consumption depended greatly on the variability of daylight levels and the sky condition and did not vary significantly from one season to another...|$|R

5000|$|The {{specification}} {{to which}} the Sunderland was developed to conform with had called for an offensive armament of a 37 mm gun and up to 2000 lb of bombs, mines or (eventually) depth charges. The ordnance was stored inside the fuselage in a purpose-built bomb room and was winched up to racks, under the wing centre section, that could be traversed out through doors {{on each side of}} the fuselage above the waterline to the release position. Defensive armament included a Nash & Thomson FN-13 powered turret with four [...]303 British Browning machine guns in the extreme tail and a pair <b>of</b> <b>manually-operated</b> [...]303 set on either side of the fuselage, firing from ports just below and behind the wings. These machine guns were later upgraded to 0.5-inch calibre Brownings. There were two different nose turret weapons, the most common, later, being two Browning machine guns. The nose weapons were later augmented by four fixed guns, two each side, in the forward fuselage that were fired by the pilot. Much later, a twin-gun turret was to be dorsal-mounted on the upper fuselage, about level with the wing trailing edge, bringing the total defensive armament up to 16 machine guns.|$|R

Two observations of architectural collaborative design supported by computer tool called “Studio Digital Collaboratif” have been conducted: one concerning collaboration between architects, in laboratory, the other one between architects and engineers in a real situation of design. Our analysis use two concepts to explain the collaborative conception in architecture: classes <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> conception and <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> conception.

50|$|In mathematics, an {{operation}} is a calculation from zero or more input values (called operands) to an output value. The number of operands is the arity <b>of</b> the <b>operation.</b> The most commonly studied operations are binary <b>operations</b> <b>of</b> arity 2, such as addition and multiplication, and unary <b>operations</b> <b>of</b> arity 1, such as additive inverse and multiplicative inverse. An <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> arity zero, or 0-ary operation is a constant. The mixed product {{is an example}} <b>of</b> an <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> arity 3, or ternary operation. Generally, the arity {{is supposed to be}} finite, but infinitary operations are sometimes considered. In this context, the usual <b>operations,</b> <b>of</b> finite arity are also called finitary operations.|$|R
