25|$|Once wasps {{emerge as}} mature adults, they spend the first 2–3 {{days on the}} nest doing very little. After the first 3 idle days, workers can be told from non-workers because workers stay on the nest longer. A wasp that leaves the nest for any reason {{immediately}} after those 3 days is considered a non-worker. Lifetime in the nest, then, seems directly dependent <b>on</b> <b>ones</b> role: queens lived an average of 61 days, workers lived about 31 days, non-workers survived for about 5 days, and males only survived about 4.8 days. This is considered evidence that the caste system determines the individual wasp’s life course. Note that these numbers are based entirely {{on the number of}} days that a wasp is seen in the nest. In some cases, including males, the wasps live the majority of their lives outside of the nest.|$|E

[...] By experimenting with her image, adopting a more 'traditional' look, and incorporating classical music in her songs, Madonna tried to appeal to an older audience who had been sceptical of her music.|$|E

Furtado recorded around forty tracks for Loose, deciding which she would include based on the s of the album—she called Timbaland [...] "a sonic extraterrestrial" [...] {{who came up with}} a sequence of songs that flowed, and said that the one she had devised was supposedly unsatisfactory.

500|$|By February 1906, Coolbrith's {{health was}} {{showing signs of}} deterioration. She was often sick in bed with rheumatism, and hard-pressed to {{continue}} her work at the Bohemian Club. Still, in March 1906 she gave a lengthy reading to the Pacific Coast Woman's Press Association entitled [...] "Some Women Poets of America." [...] Coolbrith, third vice president and life member of the club, briefly discussed the most prominent early American women poets but focused more fully <b>on</b> <b>ones</b> that became known {{in the second half}} of the 19th century, reciting example verse, and critically evaluating the work. A month later, disaster struck in the form of calamitous fire following the April 1906 San Francisco earthquake: Coolbrith's home at 1604 Taylor Street burned to the ground. Directly after the earthquake but before fire threatened, Coolbrith left her house carrying a pet cat, thinking she would soon return. Her student boarder Robert Norman and her companion Josephine Zeller were unable to carry more than another cat, a few small bundles of letters and Coolbrith's scrapbook. Immediately after he spotted heavy smoke from across the bay, Joaquin Miller took the ferry from Oakland to San Francisco in order to assist Coolbrith in saving her valuables from encroaching fire, but was prevented from doing so by soldiers who had orders to use deadly force against looters. In the blaze, Coolbrith lost 3,000 books including priceless signed first editions, artwork by Keith, many personal letters from famous people such as Whittier, Clemens, George Meredith and, above all, her nearly complete manuscript that was part autobiography and part history of California's early literary scene.|$|E
