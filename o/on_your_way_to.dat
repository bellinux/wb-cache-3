She comes to the gate– the gate is closed with a human leg; she goes into the yard– there a barrel full of blood; she goes up the stairs– there dead {{children}}; the porch is closed with an arm; on the floor– arms, legs; the door is closed with a finger. Baba Yaga comes to meet her {{at the door and}} asks her, “Have you seen anything, my dear, <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> my house?” “I saw,” the girl answers, “the gate closed with a leg.” “That is my iron latch.” “I saw a barrel in the yard full of blood.” “That is my wine, my darling.” “I saw children lying on the stairs.” “Those are my pigs.” “The porch is closed with an arm.” “That is my latch, my golden one.” “I saw in the house a hairy head.” “That is my broom, my curly one,” said Baba Yaga, then got angry with her prying goddaughter and ate her.|$|E
2500|$|Miller {{had sent}} a copy of Joaquin, et al. to Bret Harte, who offered advice that he avoid [...] "faults of excess" [...] and encouragingly wrote, [...] "you <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> become a poet." [...] The next summer, July 1870, Miller {{traveled}} to San Francisco with borrowed money and there befriended Charles Warren Stoddard and Ina Coolbrith. Stoddard {{was the first to}} meet him at the dock and, as he recalled, Miller's first words to him were, [...] "Well, let us go and talk with the poets." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "And now, having {{finished}} with the young patient," [...] said Miss Panney, who was waiting with her bonnet and shawl on, [...] "you can take up an old one, and I will get you to drive me home <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>way</b> back <b>to</b> Thorbury." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is well," [...] he answered, [...] "the monsoon {{will soon}} bring the ivory ships hither, then I {{will send you}} <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>way</b> with {{somewhat}} <b>to</b> pay your passage." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is best so," [...] I {{answered}} quietly. [...] "Hawaii is {{no place}} for such as you. I don't think Maloka will ever miss you. We will go on the Hornet away to Honolulu. There you can take passage with Frank and me on the next steamer for San Francisco, <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>way</b> home <b>to</b> dear, peaceful England." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But," [...] {{continued}} he, on {{observing that}} they did not seem cheered by the prospect, [...] "our road to the hunting-plain lies <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> Antananarivo, so you won't lose time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For which purpose, or that {{of going}} {{straight}} to your port, Captain Daggett, you've come down here, <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the Pacific; or, about five hundred miles out of your way!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! don't let us {{misunderstand}} one another," [...] she begged. [...] "Tell {{me why you}} are <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> America! Tell me why you are on this steamer, of all others." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am going}} to make a remark, Captain Granet," [...] he said, [...] "upon which you can comment or not, as you choose. Was not your costume last night rather a {{singular}} one for the evening? You say that you were <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>way</b> upstairs <b>to</b> undress when you heard the Zeppelin. Do you wear rubber shoes and a Norfolk jacket for dinner?" ...|$|R
6000|$|He replied {{still more}} compactly. [...] "By all means. I {{will send you}} some {{circular}} notes, Poste Restante, Rome. That will be <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>way.</b> Good wishes <b>to</b> you, Stephen. I'm glad {{you want to go}} east instead of just staying in Switzerland." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Duge," [...] he said, [...] "I'm {{thankful that}} we've made it up. Weiss cabled {{me that you}} had come to terms, and that you were <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>way</b> over here <b>to</b> deal with the other matter.

6000|$|... "My boy," [...] he said, [...] "there will {{be nothing}} but just a little {{incident}} that you can tell to Eve and laugh about <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the station. That I promise you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I do {{not want}} rich treasure,' replied the wolf. 'Only promise {{to give me the}} first thing that meets you <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> your castle. In three days I shall come and fetch it.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "This {{is a nice}} trick {{you have}} played us, Lisle," [...] the colonel said, as he entered. [...] "To think that while we all thought you <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>way</b> down <b>to</b> Calcutta, you were acting as a private in the regiment! It was very wrong of Gholam Singh to consent to your doing so; but I was so pleased {{to know that you}} were here that I could not bring it in my heart to blow him up as he deserved. Unquestionably, he acted from the respect and affection that he felt for your father.|$|R
6000|$|... "Welcome a {{thousand}} times! Welcome, my brave friend!" [...] the countess exclaimed. [...] "What dangers must you not have encountered <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>way</b> hither <b>to</b> us! The count and Thekla knew not that I {{had written to}} you, for I feared a failure; and when I learned yesterday that you had arrived I still kept silence, partly to give a joyful surprise to my lord today, partly because, if the governor called, I was sure that this child's telltale face would excite his suspicion that something unusual had happened." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's more'n I can tell. The mob may quiet down, an' {{then again}} they may grow worse, so there's no sayin' what'll happen. Anyhow, you don't {{want to take}} many chances <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the store." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're a puzzling proposition, Professor," [...] {{she whispered}} to herself, [...] "and you came near fooling me very properly. For I {{imagined}} you were <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> Washington, and here you've mixed up with another important job!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "At any rate, Ned," [...] {{the doctor}} said, [...] "your {{plan will be}} a relief to me in one way. Hitherto I have never gone {{to bed at night}} without an {{expectation}} of being awakened with the news that you have been shot <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>way</b> out <b>to</b> the mill at night. The fellows you frightened away last month must have a strong grudge against you in addition to their enmity against you as an employer. You will be safe enough in future, and can leave the mill to take care of itself at night if you like. You will have the blessings of all the poor fellows in the neighborhood, and may henceforth go where you will by night or day without the slightest risk of danger." ...|$|R
6000|$|The Prince's eyes {{fell upon}} the shield {{charged with the}} Black Raven and the stern young face of him who bore it. [...] "Sir Robert Knolles," [...] said he, [...] "I had thought you were <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> Brittany." ...|$|E
6000|$|A {{week after}} Tony's escape Vincent {{returned}} late one evening from {{a visit to}} some friends. Dan, as he took his horse, whispered to him: [...] "Stop a little <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> house, Marse Vincent; me hab someting to tell you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is," [...] I remarked, [...] "a {{very common}} happening. You are motoring, I see. You {{have chosen a}} very {{delightful}} night, but are you not--pardon me--a little off the track? You are <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the South Coast, I presume?" ...|$|E
60|$|Another slur {{upon the}} noble sport of chub fishing {{is the fact}} of his not being worth eating--a fact which, in the true sportsman's eyes, will go for nothing. But though the man who can buy fresh soles and salmon may despise chub, {{there are those who}} do not. True, you may make a most {{accurate}} imitation of him by taking one of Palmer's patent candles, wick and all, stuffing it with needles and split bristles, and then stewing the same in ditch-water. Nevertheless, strange to say, the agricultural stomach digests chub; and if, after having filled your creel, or three creels (as you may too often), with them, you will distribute them <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>way</b> home <b>to</b> all the old women you meet, you will make many poor souls happy, after having saved the lives of many trout.|$|R
5000|$|Tiki-taka {{has been}} {{variously}} described as [...] "a {{style of play}} based <b>on</b> making <b>your</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> {{the back of the}} net through short passing and movement", a [...] "short passing style in which the ball is worked carefully through various channels", and a [...] "nonsensical phrase that has come to mean short passing, patience and possession above all else". The style involves roaming movement and positional interchange amongst midfielders, moving the ball in intricate patterns, and sharp, one or two-touch passing. Tiki-taka is [...] "both defensive and offensive in equal measure" [...] - the team is always in possession, so doesn't need to switch between defending and attacking. Commentators have contrasted tiki-taka with [...] "Route One physicality" [...] and with the higher-tempo passing of Barcelona and Arsène Wenger's 2007-08 Arsenal side, which employed Cesc Fàbregas as the only channel between defence and attack. Tiki-taka is associated with flair, creativity, and touch, but can also be taken to a [...] "slow, directionless extreme" [...] that sacrifices effectiveness for aesthetics.|$|R
6000|$|... "I easily traced you to San Francisco, {{and found}} the hotel at which you had stopped. Here I {{obtained}} fresh news of you, and learned that you had started East, and that the destination of the party {{was believed to be}} Philadelphia. I had hoped that I should meet with you before you left California; but supposing that by that time you had reached your destination, or were, at least, far <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>way,</b> I yielded <b>to</b> the solicitations of my sister and made some excursions in California, intending then to follow you to Philadelphia and there to advertise for Mr. Craig, if he could not otherwise be found. However, by the rarest and most fortunate of chances, we have met thus early, and for this I can never be too devoutly thankful." ...|$|R
