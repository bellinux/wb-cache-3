40|$|International audienceIn {{the present}} paper, <b>opposites</b> are {{examined}} and discussed, {{and a way}} of describing them from a cognitive perspective is suggested. Related research disagrees upon whether <b>opposites</b> are symmetrical, and whether concepts should be integrated in the relation of <b>opposites.</b> The Swedish <b>opposites</b> levande 'alive' and död 'dead' have been studied thoroughly in order to provide empirical data. Arguments are presented in favour of an analysis in which <b>opposites</b> show semantic symmetry to some extent. When it comes to distribution and domains, however, <b>opposites</b> do not show symmetry. Further, it is argued that concepts {{should be included in the}} relation of <b>opposites.</b> The asymmetries found are related to markedness, information value, Aktionsart and the prototype of the word connected to referent of the subject/NP that one of the <b>opposites</b> describes...|$|R

5000|$|As Aristotle noted, {{however, the}} virtues can have several <b>opposites.</b> Virtues can be {{considered}} the mean between two extremes, as the Latin maxim dictates in medio stat virtus - in the centre lies virtue. For instance, both cowardice and rashness are <b>opposites</b> of courage; contrary to prudence are both over-caution and insufficient caution; the <b>opposites</b> of pride (a virtue) are undue humility and excessive vanity. A more [...] "modern" [...] virtue, tolerance, {{can be considered}} the mean between the two extremes of narrow-mindedness {{on the one hand}} and over-acceptance on the other. Vices can therefore be identified as the <b>opposites</b> of virtues - but with the caveat that each virtue could have many different <b>opposites,</b> all distinct from each other.|$|R

40|$|We {{present an}} {{automatic}} method for extraction of pairs of <b>opposites</b> (e. g. hotcold, top-bottom, buy-sell) {{by means of}} dependency patterns that are learned from a 450 million word treebank containing texts from Dutch newspapers. Using small sets of seed pairs, we identify the best patterns for finding new pairs of <b>opposites.</b> Treebanks are useful for generating dependency patterns expressing relations between words that occur far away from each other, something which is more difficult with textual patterns. Furthermore, textual patterns tend to find <b>opposites</b> expressed by the most frequent part-of-speech (PoS) category, viz. nouns ([17]). We examine whether dependency patterns {{can also be used}} for finding pairs of <b>opposites</b> of less frequent PoS classes: adjectives and verbs. We successfully employ dependency patterns for extracting <b>opposites</b> but find that the best acquired patterns are too general and extract a lot of noise. We conclude that while syntactic information helps to identify <b>opposites</b> for less frequently co-occurring PoS categories, more data, e. g. available from the Web, should be used to improve the results. ...|$|R

40|$|Knowing {{the degree}} of {{semantic}} contrast between words has widespread application in natural language processing, including machine translation, information retrieval, and dialogue systems. Manually created lexicons focus on <b>opposites,</b> such as hot and cold. <b>Opposites</b> are of many kinds such as antipodals, complementaries, and gradable. Existing lexicons often do not classify <b>opposites</b> into the different kinds, however. They also do not explicitly list word pairs that are not <b>opposites</b> but yet have some degree of contrast in meaning, such as warm and cold or tropical and freezing. We propose an automatic method to identify contrasting word pairs {{that is based on}} the hypothesis that if a pair of words, A and B, are contrasting, then there is a pair of <b>opposites,</b> C and D, such that A and C are strongly related and B and D are strongly related. (For example, there exists the pair of <b>opposites</b> hot and cold such that tropical is related to hot, and freezing is related to cold.) We will call this the contrast hypothesis. We begin with a large crowdsourcing experiment to determine the amount of human agreement on the concept of oppositeness and its different kinds. In the process, we flesh out key features of different kinds of <b>opposites.</b> We then present an automatic and empirical measure of lexical contrast that relies on the contrast hypothesis, corpus statistics, and the structure o...|$|R

40|$|Background in Musicology. The {{fundamental}} {{texts of}} musicology from Grosseteste to the Prakempa to Schopenhauer to Zuckerkandl imply {{that there is}} a philosophic basis to music. It was Eli Siegel in the 20 th century who explained what that basis is: "All beauty is a making one of <b>opposites,</b> " he showed, "and the making one of <b>opposites</b> is what we are going after in ourselves " (1949). <b>Opposites</b> which are in every reality—a leaf, a person, physics itself— such as oneness and manyness, motion and rest are in the music of every region. The <b>opposites</b> make for beauty—for isn't every good song, for example a unity with rich diversity? Exciting and also composing? We show in our presentation how the Siegel Theory of <b>Opposites</b> meets the hope of musicology for a method at once general enough and particular enough to provide new insight into every instance of music. Background in Anthropology. Also in this presentation we use findings of anthropology to illustrate how every culture has an aesthetic structure which is based on the same <b>opposites</b> that are made one in music. In her Patterns of Culture Ruth Benedict gives evidence for this, as did every accurate observer including Boas and Malinowski. Focusing on cultures of Native North America, the <b>opposites</b> we discuss include superiority and inferiority, self-assertion and self-abnegation—opposites every human being knows are in him- or herself. Our musical examples illustrate the poignant rising and falling, leaps and cascades so redolent of Native American melodies. We ask, when these melodies are powerful, beautiful, is it because they make sense of the <b>opposites</b> in self that are so confusing i...|$|R

Two years later she appeared <b>opposite</b> Cary Grant in the romantic mystery film Charade. Hepburn followed this by starring in the romantic comedy Paris When It Sizzles <b>opposite</b> William Holden, and as Cockney flower girl Eliza Doolittle in the musical film My Fair Lady (both in 1964). In 1967, she played a blind woman menaced by drug dealers {{in her own home}} in the suspense thriller Wait Until Dark which earned her a Best Actress Oscar nomination.
