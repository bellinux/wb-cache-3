25|$|The {{flow speed}} of a fluid can be {{measured}} using a device such as a Venturi meter or an <b>orifice</b> <b>plate,</b> which can be placed into a pipeline to reduce {{the diameter of the}} flow. For a horizontal device, the continuity equation shows that for an incompressible fluid, the reduction in diameter will cause an increase in the fluid flow speed. Subsequently, Bernoulli's principle then shows that there must be a decrease in the pressure in the reduced diameter region. This phenomenon is known as the Venturi effect.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2011. Despite the {{extensive}} research work {{carried out on}} flow through short square-edged <b>orifice</b> <b>plates</b> {{over the last century}} (e. g. Johansen, 1930; Benedict, 1977; Alvi et al., 1978; Swamee, 2005; ESDU, 2007), gaps in the engineering data still exist for certain ranges of flow conditions and geometries. The majority of data available in the literature are for Newtonian fluids in the turbulent flow regime (ESDU, 2007). Insufficient data have been observed for the orifice with pipe diameter ratio, β = 0. 2, in the laminar flow regime. There are no experimental data for β = 0. 3 and 0. 57. The objective of this thesis was to conduct wide-ranging experimental studies of the flow in <b>orifice</b> <b>plates,</b> which included those geometrical configurations, by measuring pressure loss coefficients and discharge coefficients across the <b>orifice</b> <b>plates</b> using both Newtonian fluids and non-Newtonian fluids in both laminar and turbulent flow regimes. The test work was conducted on the valve test rig at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology. Four classical circular short square-edged <b>orifice</b> <b>plates</b> having, β = 0. 2, 0. 3, 0. 57 and 0. 7, were tested. In addition, two generation 0 Von Koch <b>orifice</b> <b>plates</b> (Von Koch, 1904), with equivalent cross sectional area were also tested for β = 0. 57. Water was used as Newtonian fluid to obtain turbulent regime data and also for calibration purposes to ensure measurement accuracy and carboxymethyl cellulose, bentonite and kaolin slurries were used at different concentrations to obtain laminar and transitional loss coefficient data. The hydraulic grade line method was used to evaluate pressure loss coefficients (Edwards et al., 1985), while the flange tap arrangement method was used to determine the discharge coefficients (ESDU, 2007). A tube viscometer with three different pipe diameters was used to obtain the rheological properties of the fluids. The results for each test are presented in the form of pressure loss coefficient (kor) and discharge coefficient (Cd) against pipe Reynolds number (Re...|$|R

However, in floods, the flow rate rises and floods out the <b>orifice</b> <b>plate</b> which can then only pass a flow determined by the physical dimensions of the orifice.

40|$|In {{reciprocating}} fluid displacement systems, a {{trend toward}} high-speed machinery and application of stepless reverse-flow capacity control system is observed. Badly designed compression systems may cause excessive high-frequency noise and vibration levels, which are a risk from a structural integrity point-of-view. Furthermore, noise levels, conflicting with both environmental and HSE legislation may result in reduced system capacity or even process shutdown. Therefore, a robust system design {{should focus on the}} mitigation of high-frequency pulsations in an early design stage. This paper highlights the multi-bore <b>orifice</b> <b>plates</b> (MBRO’s) as powerful damping devices of in-line, highfrequency pressure pulsations. MBRO’s provide efficient pulsation damping behavior at high frequencies (up to 1 kHz) where conventional (single bore) <b>orifices</b> <b>plates</b> fail. Within the TNO research program, in collaboration with Hoerbiger, prediction models have been developed that describe the static and dynamic performance of MBRO’s.
