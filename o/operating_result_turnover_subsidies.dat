Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 52). Employee turnover {{is a problem that}} can hurt sales productivity, service levels, and drive up costs; all at the same time. Turnover can creep up and steal momentum from even the best run companies. Involuntary turnover has not been a major issue in many companies; the reason {{is that it is a}} highly common phenomenon. When times are good, jobs are abundant; wages are rising; workers are trying to get better opportunity. Turnover can be a symptom of other problems, especially dissatisfaction with work or working conditions. Measures taken to prevent turnover are bound to improve other <b>operating</b> <b>results</b> as well. <b>Turnover</b> is costly in terms of time and effort required to recruit, select, and train new personnel. Employee who leaves the organization is dissatisfied; it could be some will retire, leave town, quit because of family circumstances, and desire to change professions, or even start a business of their own. It is important to know and recognize the difference between employees who leave because they are unhappy and those who leave for other reasons. To minimize turnover, employees may be given perks and compensation, pleasant working conditions, opportunity for growth/advancement, and job security; that may influence employees desire to stay.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} extent to which {{productivity}} growth is the <b>result</b> of firm <b>turnover</b> as output is shifted from one firm to another, driven by the competitive process. Turnover occurs as some firms gain market share and others lose it. Some of the <b>resulting</b> <b>turnover</b> is due to entry and exit. Another part arises from growth and decline in incumbent continuing firms. This paper proposes a method for measuring the impact of firm turnover on productivity growth and shows that it is far more important than many previous empirical studies have concluded. It argues that firm turnover associated with competition is the main source of aggregate labour productivity growth in Canadian manufacturing industries.

The combined effect of these risks obviously influences the shareholders’ earnings.
