5|$|In May 2008, Obama asked Lu {{to begin}} {{planning}} for a possible presidential transition. Obama warned him to tell no <b>one</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> nascent operation, even his own wife, so Lu quietly rented a small office in D.C. and secretly met with people who had worked on previous Democratic presidential transition efforts. The planning efforts produced policy options {{on a wide range}} of topics, compiled names of and began vetting potential political appointees for top jobs, arranged over 100 security clearances, and managed the logistics for expanding the operations after Election Day.|$|E
5|$|While the {{tensions}} between NATO members from the build-up to the invasion of Iraq had dissipated, the NATO summit, and the months preceding the summit, were marked by divisions between the United States and the United Kingdom {{on the one side}} and France, Germany, Italy and Spain on the other. Two rifts existed, <b>one</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> military contributions to the war in Afghanistan, and the other concerning whether or not NATO should assume a more global role.|$|E
5|$|The false {{story of}} the {{execution}} of the Ho-Chunk prisoners, along with the incessant American trespassing, convinced some Ho-Chunks to take up arms against the United States. The timing seemed right, since the evacuation of Fort Crawford appeared to be a sign of American weakness. Another grievance was the news that some Ho-Chunk women had been sexually assaulted by American riverboat crews along the Mississippi River, although this story, like the <b>one</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> executions, may have been a false rumor. The Ho-Chunks broke off diplomatic relations with the United States by not showing up for a scheduled treaty conference, and prepared for war.|$|E

During World War II, a Good Humor truck was assigned to follow one of the armies during maneuvers. The commander could not understand how the opposing artillery was quickly locating his position until he realized that the spotters were using the white Good Humor truck as a guide. Rather than deny his troops ice cream, that night he ordered the truck to be painted army green. After the war, a Good Humor vendor took pity on a youngster who was a nickel short and accepted a new magazine in place of the missing five cents. When he returned the next day, the street was lined with stacks of magazines piled by children eager to exchange periodicals for Good Humors.|$|E
25|$|Papantla is {{the heart}} of the Totonacapan region. When the Spanish refounded the town, they laid it out in Spanish style with a central plaza {{surrounded}} by the most important buildings, such as the main church and the main government building. The Municipal Palace still faces the main plaza, marked by the classic-style pediment over the main entrance. This building contains two murals: <b>one</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Totonacs by Teodoro Cano Garcia and the other by Xolotl Martinez Hurtado de Mendoza. The construction of the building dates from 1810 although it was destroyed by forces associated with Pancho Villa in 1915. The building was reconstructed in 1929, with remodeling done in 1979 and 1999. The plaza is officially named the Israel C. Téllez Park, which contains grass and a number of trees. In this plaza are weekend events such as the Danzón Fridays as well as live music on Saturday and cultural events on Sundays. On the underside of the kiosk is a mural by Teodoro Cano Garcia which depicts the indigenous concept of creation, as a world with four suns.|$|E

Co-host Michael Marshall described it as, [...] "a fairly-shambolic, overly-enthusiastic and snarky mix of science, skepticism and sarcasm." [...] A popular semi-regular segment, until 14 July 2011 when it concluded with a special [...] "Best of" [...] edition, was a fact check on the children's book [...] The Giant Book of Fantastic Facts.

500|$|In 1965, Steiger {{played an}} effeminate {{embalmer}} in Tony Richardson's comedy The Loved <b>One,</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> funeral business in Los Angeles, {{based on the}} 1948 short satirical novel by Evelyn Waugh. His curly-haired appearance in the film was modeled on a bust of Apollo he once saw while meeting Richardson. Steiger offended Bosley Crowther of The New York Times, who found his character repellent. His next role, as Komarovsky, a Russian politician and [...] "villainous opportunist" [...] who rapes Julie Christie's character in David Lean's Doctor Zhivago (1965), {{was one of his}} favorites. Steiger, one of only two Americans in the cast, was initially apprehensive about working with such great British actors as Ralph Richardson and Alec Guinness, and was pleased when the film was completed that he did not stand out as an American. The film was the biggest international box office draw of the 1960s, grossing $200 million worldwide. It has since been acclaimed {{as one of the greatest}} films ever made, and in 1998 was selected as the 39th best American film in the original AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies list by the American Film Institute.|$|E

Its {{accompanying}} single, [...] "The Long and Winding Road", was the Beatles' last; {{it was released}} in the United States, {{but not in the}} UK. The Let It Be documentary film followed later that month, and would win the 1970 Academy Award for Best Original Song Score. Sunday Telegraph critic Penelope Gilliatt called it [...] "a very bad film and a touching <b>one...</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> breaking apart of this reassuring, geometrically perfect, once apparently ageless family of siblings". Several reviewers stated that some of the performances in the film sounded better than their analogous album tracks. Describing Let It Be as the [...] "only Beatles album to occasion negative, even hostile reviews", Unterberger calls it [...] "on the whole underrated"; he singles out [...] "some good moments of straight hard rock in 'I've Got a Feeling' and 'Dig a Pony'", and praises [...] "Let It Be", [...] "Get Back", and [...] "the folky 'Two of Us', with John and Paul harmonising together". McCartney filed suit for the dissolution of the Beatles' contractual partnership on 31 December 1970. Legal disputes continued long after their break-up, and the dissolution was not formalised until 29 December 1974, when John Lennon signed the paperwork terminating the partnership while on vacation with his family at Walt Disney World Resort in Florida.|$|E
