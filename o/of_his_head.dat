5|$|A defense-appointed {{expert witness}} {{in the field of}} {{biomechanics}} testified on March 5 that Nosek could not turn 180 degrees during the fall and that should he be falling forward, he could not have sustained an injury to the back <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> He further said that if Nosek fell over the first row of the fans, he must have been not only pushed, but must have jumped himself. The State Attorney immediately attacked this testimony, claiming that the expert witness omitted the conditions at the place and time, {{as well as some of}} the eyewitness testimonies, according to which Nosek fell onto his back from the beginning and did not turn during the fall. The presiding judge agreed with the State Attorney on some of his points.|$|E

5|$|Jewish legend {{records that}} Samson's {{shoulders}} were sixty cubits broad. (Many Talmudic commentaries, however, explain {{that this is}} not to be taken literally, for a person that size could not live normally in society. Rather, it means that he had the ability to carry a burden 60 cubits wide (approximately 30 meters) on his shoulders). He was lame in both feet but, when the spirit of God came upon him, he could step with one stride from Zorah to Eshtaol, while the hairs <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> arose and clashed against one another so that they could be heard for a like distance. Samson was said to be so strong that he could uplift two mountains and rub them together like two s of earth, yet his superhuman strength, like Goliath's, brought woe upon its possessor.|$|E
5|$|Nosek's other friend Ondřej Vlach {{testified that}} Nosek's fall {{happened}} in a break {{between the end of}} concert and the encore. Nosek climbed the stage together with another fan as the band members were leaving to go backstage. According to him, Blythe ran into the two fans and pushed them both off. While the other fan was caught by a couple of fans remaining under the stage, Nosek fell directly on the ground. According to Vlach, there were fewer fans in front of the stage due to the break. Vlach further testified that after the fall, Nosek went to sit on a bench, where he was fetched a water bottle. Nosek began vomiting about half an hour after the fall and as his friends realized that he had a bulge at the back <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> they called an ambulance for fear he might have a concussion. Vlach said that he understood Blythe's gesture in the break as an invitation to the stage.|$|E
5|$|On 4 July 1902 (the {{day of his}} death) Vivekananda awoke early, went to {{the monastery}} at Belur Math and meditated for three hours. He taught Shukla-Yajur-Veda, Sanskrit grammar and the {{philosophy}} of yoga to pupils, later discussing with colleagues a planned Vedic college in the Ramakrishna Math. At 7:00p.m. Vivekananda went to his room, asking not to be disturbed; he died at 9:10p.m. while meditating. According to his disciples, Vivekananda attained mahasamādhi; the rupture of a blood vessel in his brain was reported as a possible cause of death. His disciples believed that the rupture was due to his brahmarandhra (an opening in the crown <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head)</b> being pierced when he attained mahasamādhi. Vivekananda fulfilled his prophecy {{that he would not}} live forty years. He was cremated on a sandalwood funeral pyre {{on the bank of the}} Ganga in Belur, opposite where Ramakrishna was cremated sixteen years earlier.|$|E
