5|$|It {{was written}} in the L.A. sun on an {{afternoon}} with my friend David Poe. We were talking about how you sometimes know that you would be better at love if only you were older. But you can't rush <b>old.</b> <b>You</b> have to be young and dumb and let time do its thing before you get the experience you need to handle love right.|$|E
5|$|We have {{patience}} with music, {{a year or}} five {{years down the road}} it may kind of rewrite itself and become what it's supposed to be. There's two songs on this record that are over five years <b>old,</b> <b>you</b> know? 'God is the Radio' and 'No One Knows'.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} {{redundancy}} {{is based on}} a length of service calculation and age. For each year you have worked while you were under 21 years <b>old,</b> <b>you</b> get half a week's pay. For each year between ages 21 and 40, one week's pay. For each year over 40, one and a half week's pay (s.162). However, there is an upper limit set on what can be considered a week's pay, which is approximately the same as a week on the minimum wage (if you were made redundant on or before 31 January 2011, it was £380 per week - from 1 February 2011 to 31 January 2012, it was £400 - currently it is £450, before tax).|$|E

500|$|The {{event was}} held on the National Mall the next year on July 9, 2011. The Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum {{assisted}} through opening its Public Observatory and outer landing area to the public. Hofstra University sponsored the event, and presented both live events and space observation through telescopes. Hofstra University program coordinator of astronomy public outreach, professor Donald Lubowich, helped organize the event. Lubowich commented: [...] "Bringing Hofstra's program to the National Mall gives us a very special opportunity to encourage children to pursue their interest and science and promote public understanding of science. Gazing at the rings of Saturn or the Moon's craters and mountains captures the imagination, no matter how <b>old</b> <b>you</b> are." [...] The 2011 event included assistance from the Northern Virginia Astronomy Club, in addition to attendance from organizations including: the American Astronomical Society, the James Webb Space Telescope, the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, and the Franklin Institute Science Museum.|$|E
500|$|In January 2011, the Icelandic donor {{died and}} his penis was surgically removed {{so that it}} could be added to the museum's collection. The penectomy was not entirely {{successful}} and left the penis [...] "a greyish-brown, shrivelled mass". According to Sigurður, [...] "I should have stretched it and sewn it at the back to keep it in more or less a normal position". Instead, it [...] "went directly into the formaldehyde". Although disappointed with the results, Sigurður expressed confidence that [...] "I will get a younger and a bigger and better one soon." [...] Visitors' most common reaction to the preserved human penis is [...] "that it's very <b>old,</b> <b>you</b> know, a bit shrunken, and the male members [...] say 'oh, I hope mine will not look like this when I get old. Sigurður has considered donating his own penis to the museum when he dies but said that it depends on his wife: [...] "If she dies first, my specimen would go in here. If I die first, well I can't say. She might say no." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2012, Cardinale {{featured}} opposite Jeanne Moreau and Michael Lonsdale in {{the final}} feature film to be directed by Portuguese director [...] Manoel de Oliveira, Gebo and the Shadow. Critically acclaimed, it has a rare 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and was shown at the 69th Venice International Film Festival. The Hollywood Reporter described it as the [...] "ensemble of superb older performers who comprise {{the remainder of the}} dramatis personae". In 2013, Cardinale starred alongside supporting actresses Patricia Black and Chloé Cunha in Nadia Szold's Joy de V., and had a role in Ernst Gossner's war drama The Silent Mountain, a love story set in the Dolomite Mountains at the outbreak of World War I between Italy and Austria-Hungary in 1915. Gossner described her as [...] "a terrific spirit on the set", and noted that Cardinale told the production team [...] "legendary stories" [...] about Marcello Mastroianni. In 2014, Cardinale portrayed a [...] "sympathetic Italian chaperone" [...] viscountess in the British period drama film Effie Gray, which was penned by Emma Thompson and featured Dakota Fanning in the lead role. While promoting Effie Gray, in an interview Cardinale said: [...] "I still continue to work, it's 142 movies now. Usually when you are <b>old</b> <b>you</b> don't work any more, but I still work, which is good.... I've been very lucky because I've had many fantastic directors with me, Fellini, Visconti, Blake Edwards, lots and lots...".|$|E

It’s about discovery. And you learn from your mistakes so unless you’re completely shut down to improving your life, I believe you can continue learning until you’re very, very <b>old.</b> <b>You</b> have to look at those past missteps as learning experiences." ...|$|E

2500|$|In his 2002 {{commencement}} address, {{he described}} his then-current NASA activities as follows: “I am drawing pictures of space vehicles on Mars, but now I'm living inside them, and actually pretending we are ON Mars. I've done that in the High Arctic of Canada on Devon Island and more recently in the Utah desert, where I was the Station Commander for two weeks.” He said that “For thirty years we've waited to carry space exploration forward. We're in a transition zone, what I like to call 'Standing on Columbus' dock.'...Today we are called by adventure to another land....It's OUR new land, a new frontier. We're going to Mars....But when?...More practically, we're going within 20 years. Some of you could be walking on Mars before you are forty years <b>old.</b> <b>You</b> just have to believe. Your...attitude...matters. You must believe in discovery and adventure. If you let other people say 'it can't be done,' I can promise you, you will be 50 years old like me one day, and we will STILL be sending tin cans around the Earth, round and round going nowhere.” ...|$|E
2500|$|On July 9, 1948, Paige {{became the}} oldest man ever to {{debut in the}} major leagues, {{at the age of}} 42 years and two days. When asked about his age, he would reply [...] "If someone asked you how <b>old</b> <b>you</b> were and you didn't know your age, how old would you think you were?" [...] With the St. Louis Browns beating the Indians 4–1 {{in the bottom of the}} fourth inning, Boudreau pulled his {{starting}} pitcher, Bob Lemon, and sent Paige in. Paige, not knowing the signs and not wanting to confuse his catcher, pitched cautiously. Chuck Stevens lined a ball left field for a single. Jerry Priddy bunted Stevens over to second. Up next was Whitey Platt, and Paige decided to take command. He threw an overhand pitch for a strike and one sidearm for another strike. Paige then threw his [...] "Hesitation Pitch" [...] (see [...] "pitching style" [...] section below), which surprised Platt so much that he threw his bat 40 feet up the third base line. Browns manager Zack Taylor bolted from the dugout to talk to umpire Bill McGowan about the pitch, claiming it was a balk, but McGowan let it stand as a strike. Paige then got Al Zarilla to fly out to end the inning. The next inning, he gave up a leadoff single, but with his catcher having simplified his signals, Paige got the next batter to hit into a double play, followed by a pop fly. Larry Doby pinch-hit for Paige the following inning.|$|E
