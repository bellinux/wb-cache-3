5|$|Obayashi {{already had}} {{experience}} with special effects {{from his work}} on television commercials. Obayashi and the cameraman oversaw the special effects for the film. Obayashi desired the special effects to look unrealistic, as if a child created them. For the scene in which Ai Matsubara's character vanishes under the blood, Obayashi had her suspended nude, pouring buckets of blue paint on her to create a blue-screen chroma key effect where the blue colored parts of her body would deteriorate on camera. The outcome {{of a lot of}} these effects would be unknown until the film was completed. Obayashi stated that sometimes the effects did not turn <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> originally envisioned them.|$|E
5|$|By 1981, Gary's wife, {{and then}} Gary himself, had both {{committed}} suicide. At the same time, Hollywood was {{under threat of}} strikes by both the Writers's and Directors's Guilds. Needing enough films to carry the studio through in case the strikes happened, White Dog was one of thirteen films considered to be far enough along to be completable {{in a short time}} frame. With a push from Michael Eisner, White Dog was one of seven that Paramount put on a fast track for production. Eisner pushed for the film {{to be one of the}} selected ones because of its social message that hate was learned. Producer Jon Davison was less certain and, early on, he questioned how the film was being marketed. Hanson, back on board as the film's screenwriter, suggested that Samuel Fuller be named the film's director as he felt Fuller was the only one available with the experience needed to complete the film on such a short schedule and with a low budget, while still doing so responsibly with regard to the sensitive material. Davison agreed after visiting Fuller and seeing Fuller act <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> would shoot the film.|$|E
25|$|Griffin {{started as}} a singer on radio at age 19, {{appearing}} on San Francisco Sketchbook, a nationally syndicated program based at KFRC. Griffin was overweight as an adolescent and a young man, which disappointed some radio fans when they saw him in person. He wrote years later in his autobiography that originally there was a deliberate effort to keep the public from finding <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> looked. Embarrassed by the weight issue, Griffin resolved to change his appearance, losing 80 pounds in four months.|$|E

500|$|Considered by {{many critics}} {{as one of}} Dylan's masterpieces, [...] "Visions of Johanna" [...] proved {{difficult}} to capture on tape. Heylin places the writing {{in the fall of}} 1965, when Dylan was living in the Chelsea Hotel with his wife Sara. In the New York recording studio, on November 30, Dylan announced his epic composition: [...] "This is called 'Freeze Out'." [...] Gill notes that this working title captures the [...] "air of nocturnal suspension in which the verse tableaux are sketched... full of whispering and muttering." [...] Wilentz relates how Dylan guided his backing musicians through fourteen takes, trying to sketch <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> wanted it played, saying at one point, [...] "it's not hard rock, The only thing in it that's hard is Robbie." [...] Wilentz notes that, as Dylan quiets things down, he inches closer to what will appear on the album.|$|E

Suzy {{says that she}} is not willing to go over and be with Doc, but [...] "if he was sick or if he bust his leg or an arm or something", she would go to him and bring him soup. The wheels in Hazel's head begin unaccustomed turnings, and {{sometime}} later when Mac passes Hazel on the street, Mac is surprised to see his friend carrying a baseball bat. When the scene returns to Doc's lab, he is receiving treatment from a real doctor and trying to puzzle <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> broke his arm. Suzy comes in, and makes soup for him as Hazel and Mac take turns watching at the keyhole. Doc admits that he needs and loves Suzy, and they embrace. As Fauna and the girls arrive, so do the other Flophouse boys, and Mac gives Doc what was bought with the raffle money—the largest (tele)scope in the catalog. ("Finale") ...|$|E
500|$|In September 2007, Gavin Hood, {{director}} of , speculated {{that there would}} be a sequel, which would be set in Japan. During one of the post-credits scenes Logan is seen drinking at a bar in Japan. Such a location was the subject of Chris Claremont and Frank Miller's 1982 limited series on the character, which was not in the first film as Jackman felt [...] "what we need to do is establish who [...] is and find <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> became Wolverine". Jackman stated the Claremont-Miller series is his favorite Wolverine story. Of the Japanese arc, Jackman also stated, [...] "I won’t lie to you, I have been talking to writers... I’m a big fan of the Japanese saga in the comic book." [...] Before X-Men Origins: Wolverines release, Lauren Shuler Donner approached Simon Beaufoy to write the script, but he did not feel confident enough to commit. By May 4, 2009, Jackman's company Seed Productions was preparing several projects, including a sequel to X-Men Origins: Wolverine to be set in Japan, but neither Jackman nor Seed has a production credit on the completed 2013 sequel. On May 5, 2009, just days after the opening weekend of X-Men Origins: Wolverine, the sequel was officially confirmed.|$|E

500|$|The first {{image the}} Coens and Raimi {{conceived}} was of Norville Barnes about {{to jump from}} the window of a skyscraper and then they had to figure <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> got there and how to save him. The inclusion of the hula hoop came {{as a result of a}} plot device. Joel remembers, [...] "We had to come up with something that Norville was going to invent that on the face of it was ridiculous. Something that would seem, by any sort of rational measure, to be doomed to failure, but something that on the other hand the audience already knew was going to be a phenomenal success." [...] Ethan said, [...] "The whole circle motif was built into the design of the movie, and that just made it seem more appropriate." [...] Joel: [...] "What grew out of that was the design element which drives the movie. The tension between vertical lines and circles; you have these tall buildings, then these circles everywhere which are echoed in the plot...in the structure of the movie itself. It starts with the end and circles back to the beginning, with a big flashback." [...] It took the Coens and Raimi three months to write the screenplay. As early as 1985, the Coens were quoted as saying that an upcoming project [...] "takes place in the late Fifties in a skyscraper and is about Big Business. The characters talk fast and wear sharp clothes." ...|$|E

2500|$|Following promotional {{work for}} the second Kid Creole and the Coconuts album Fresh Fruit in Foreign Places, Darnell gave an {{interview}} to the UK music magazine Melody Maker in December 1981 in which he spoke enthusiastically of the forthcoming solo album he was planning called Wise Guy, and told the magazine about three songs he already had written for the record titled [...] "I'm a Wonderful Thing", [...] "Stool Pigeon" [...] (originally titled [...] "Jive Talking") and [...] "Imitation". When it became apparent a few months later, however, that the record {{would no longer be}} a solo album {{and that it would be}} significantly different in style musically from the previous records, Darnell told interviewers at the time that it was [...] "a chance to do some other things", but in reality he felt he was being forced to do [...] "a cop-out album, an R album" [...] in order to ease ZE's considerable financial difficulties with their parent label in the US, Sire Records. By the time of the album's release in May 1982, Darnell acknowledged that his record company had put pressure on him and that the record had not turned <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> had wanted: [...] "Make no mistake about it, this album is a compromise. It's much more steeped in R than Kid Creole should be. That's why it originally was supposed to be an August Darnell solo album. But because of the problems we ran into in the [...] company, and the company not believing in Kid Creole enough, this had to be turned into a Kid Creole album." ...|$|E

2500|$|Flintoff {{was back}} in action for Lancashire early in the 2008 season, but a side strain ruled him out of {{contention}} for the home series against New Zealand. After again returning to action in county cricket he was recalled to the England squad for the second Test against South Africa, where he missed the last 17 Tests prior. He took his 200th Test wicket in the Third Test, trapping Neil McKenzie lbw for 72. Flintoff bowled consistently against the South Africans, but South African coach Mickey Arthur {{felt that he was}} too defensive. [...] His batting also began to show promise as he consistently made starts, before being moved back up to bat at six when Kevin Pietersen took over as captain. In the following one day series, Flintoff was an important player for England, leading Pietersen to describe him as [...] "a superstar". Flintoff scored 78 in both the first and the third matches – he was not required to bat in the second – as well as 31 not out off 12 balls in the fourth, whilst taking three wickets in the same match. This led many pundits to speculate that Flintoff might just be back to his best. He won Man of the Series in the ODI home series against South Africa, where England won four-nil: the last match was washed out. He was both the top run-scorer and the top wicket-taker of that series. Still, though, his want of consistency frustrated the pundits. [...] "Flintoff," [...] wrote Peter Roebuck some time later, [...] "is a fine cricketer who has never quite worked <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> takes wickets or scores runs. Torn between hitting and playing, pounding and probing, he has performed below his highest capabilities." ...|$|E

[...] He further explained how he wanted the Astrodome scene to be {{the opening of the}} film to show viewers at her height of her career and then backtrail to show how she got there. The scene was shot at the San Antonio Alamodome on September 15, 1996 and was advertised in newspapers which garnered the attention of 35,000 people. Lopez said how she was nervous for the scene since {{it would be the first}} time she would perform in front of an audience of that size. She further expressed how uneven she was due to the criticism she received and was unsure how fans would receive her. Jackie Guerra voiced on how during the scene she saw Selena's parents sobbing, the cast later said how after the scene was completed they were overwhelmed with emotions. Later that night, fans approached Lopez sobbing that she looked identical to Selena and public perception on Lopez changed after her performance. The death scene was shot once, the cast explained how once they were emotional they continued after the director announced the take. Guerra said how she was physically and emotionally drained after the death scene was shot. She explained how she [...] "could not imagine what's it like to be [...] " [...] and further said how she had to live with the pain for four months but found it unimaginable to the pain the family goes through since the death of Selena. Lopez spoke how the scene made her appreciate life even more, whereas Seda expressed that working on the film was one of the hardest for him in terms of departing from the cast.|$|E
