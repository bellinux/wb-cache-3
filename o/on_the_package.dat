The Judge is arrested for questioning, and knowing {{that there is not}} enough evidence to warrant sentencing him, he offers Black a job with him. Black refuses, but The Judge is released. Bardale is incensed that The Judge has manipulated the law to his own ends, and passes sentence on him for hypocrisy. Finding Bardale alone in a farmhouse, Black discovers that the convict had fed The Judge to his pigs.|$|E

25|$|The P54C was {{followed}} by the P54CQS which operated at 120MHz. It was fabricated in a 0.35µm BiCMOS process and was the first commercial microprocessor to be fabricated in a 0.35µm process. Its transistor count is identical to the P54C and, despite the newer process, it had an identical die area as well. The chip was connected to the package using wire bonding, which only allows connections along the edges of the chip. A smaller chip would have required a redesign of the package, as there is a limit on the length of the wires and the edges of the chip would be further away from the pads <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>package.</b> The solution was to keep the chip the same size, retain the existing pad-ring, and only reduce the size of the Pentium's logic circuitry to enable it to achieve higher clock frequencies.|$|E

25|$|On February 2, 2009, Politico and CNN {{reported}} that Gregg accepted President Obama's offer {{to be the}} next United States Secretary of Commerce. If Gregg had been confirmed by the Senate, {{he would have had to}} resign his Senate seat and be replaced with an appointment by Democratic Governor John Lynch. Sources from both parties confirmed that Gregg's former chief of staff, Republican Bonnie Newman, would have been chosen to replace him. The Washington Post had alleged that Gregg would not accept the appointment unless Gov. Lynch agreed to appoint a Republican to fill his seat until 2010. In February 2009 many news outlets noted that Gregg had, in 1995, voted to abolish the United States Department of Commerce. Although he has stated that he supports the stimulus package promoted by President Obama, he has stated that he will recuse himself from voting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>package.</b>|$|E
25|$|Airtemp {{was more}} {{sophisticated}} and efficient than the complicated rival air conditioners of 1953. It recirculated, rather than merely cooled, the air inside the vehicle, {{and it was also}} the highest capacity unit available on an automobile. It was also simple to operate, with a single switch on the dashboard marked with low, medium, and high positions, which the driver selected as desired. The system was capable of cooling a Chrysler from 120 degrees to 85 degrees in about two minutes, and of completely eliminating humidity, dust, pollen and tobacco smoke at the same time. Since it relied on fresh air, and drew in sixty percent more of it than any contemporary system, Airtemp avoided the staleness associated with automotive air conditioning at the time. It was silent and unobtrusive. Instead of plastic tubes mounted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>package</b> shelf as on GM and on other cars, small ducts directed cool air toward the ceiling of the car where it filtered down around the passengers instead of blowing directly on them, a feature that modern cars have lost.|$|E
500|$|In a 2006 Rolling Stone interview, Vonnegut sardonically {{stated that}} he would sue the Brown & Williamson tobacco company, the maker of the Pall Mall-branded {{cigarettes}} he had been smoking since he was twelve or fourteen years old, for false advertising. [...] "And do you know why?" [...] he said. [...] "Because I'm 83 years old. The lying bastards! <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>package</b> Brown & Williamson promised to kill me." [...] He died {{on the night of}} April 11, 2007 in Manhattan, as a result of brain injuries incurred several weeks prior from a fall at his New York brownstone home. His death was reported by his wife Jill. Vonnegut was 84 years old. At the time of his death, Vonnegut had written fourteen novels, three short story collections, five plays and five non-fiction books. A book composed of Vonnegut's unpublished pieces, Armageddon in Retrospect, was compiled and posthumously published by Vonnegut's son Mark in 2008.|$|E

500|$|On December 15, 2011, a {{deal was}} reached on the {{remaining}} nine appropriations bills, which were combined into the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012. [...] One point of contention was that an earlier draft of the bill supported by Republicans contained new restrictions on travel to Cuba, which had been relaxed by the Obama administration in 2009. [...] These restrictions were removed in the enacted bill {{at the insistence of}} the Obama administration. [...] A separate Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2012 was also included in the package, as well as a concurrent resolution which offset the increased disaster funding by imposing a 1.83% across-the-board spending cut to all discretionary programs except Defense and Veterans Affairs. [...] Two more continuing resolutions were also passed, one extending the deadline by one day so that the Senate could vote <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>package,</b> and one until December 23, 2011. [...] The two appropriations bills were enacted on December 23, 2011, but the concurrent resolution failed in the Senate.|$|E
500|$|Many critics {{generally}} had {{a positive}} opinion <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>package.</b> Bertz thought that the game's multiplayer design had laid a great foundation for the game, {{but it was not}} taken advantage of due to the small number of game modes. Leack felt that Sieges tight focus on tactical gameplay had [...] "provided something unlike any other game on the market". Butterworth found the game very unique and that there was [...] "nothing else like it" [...] when he put aside the game's minor annoyances. Griffin wrote that the title felt very fresh, as most games in the market did not value tactics. Davenport similarly praised the game for being very concentrated and making no compromises on gameplay design, which in turn make the title one of the best tactical multiplayer shooters on the market. Gies recognized the game's potential but thought that they were overshadowed by the game's numerous technical annoyances, frustrating progression system and its lack of content. Robinson was impressed by the game's multiplayer mode, and that the overall package could be considered as the year's best multiplayer game. However, he questioned Ubisoft for releasing the game with so little content while still selling it at full-price.|$|E
500|$|Mr. Mackey's line, [...] "drugs are bad, m'kay?", {{has entered}} popular culture. The Eminem song, [...] "The Kids" [...] (which is {{featured}} on the B-side of the single [...] "The Way I Am" [...] and the clean version of The Marshall Mathers LP), is thematically about drug use, and makes numerous references to South Park and impressions of the show's characters, including an impression of Mr. Mackey's voice and the repetition of his line. The song [...] "Hip Hop Quotables" [...] by Ludacris, from his album Chicken-n-Beer, also contains the line. In 2008, the line was referenced in the dissenting opinion of a judge, {{in a case of}} the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Also, in a 2010 marijuana-related court case at the Maryland Court of Appeals, Judge Clayton Greene, Jr. referenced the episode in his dissenting opinion, calling Mr. Mackey's words [...] "immortal". In 2011, during a judiciary committee hearing about a marijuana-related bill in Denver, Colorado, a representative showed off a potential packaging for edible marijuana products. According to a group called the Cannabis Therapy Institute, the label <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>package,</b> which bore the placeholder text, [...] "Legal and governmentally approved statement describing that pot is bad, M-ok", was a reference to the South Park episode.|$|E

500|$|Falling print {{advertising}} revenue and projections of continued decline {{resulted in a}} paywall being instituted in 2011, regarded as modestly successful after garnering several hundred thousand subscriptions and about $100million in revenue [...] The paywall was announced on March 17, 2011, that starting on March 28, 2011 (March 17, 2011, for Canada), it would charge frequent readers for access to its online content. Readers {{would be able to}} access up to 20 articles each month without charge. (Although beginning in April 2012, the number of free-access articles was halved to just ten articles per month.) Any reader who wanted to access more would have to pay for a digital subscription. This plan would allow free access for occasional readers, but produce revenue from [...] "heavy" [...] readers. Digital subscriptions rates for four weeks range from $15 to $35 depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>package</b> selected, with periodic new subscriber promotions offering four-week all-digital access for as low as 99¢. Subscribers to the paper's print edition get full access without any additional fee. Some content, such as the front page and section fronts will remain free, as well as the Top News page on mobile apps. In January 2013, The New York Times Public Editor Margaret M. Sullivan announced {{that for the first time}} in many decades, the paper generated more revenue through subscriptions than through advertising.|$|E

2500|$|In December 2004, Trevin and Melanie Skeens of Maryland, who {{had bought}} the album for their thirteen-year-old daughter, filed a class action lawsuit against Wal-Mart after hearing the word [...] "fuck" [...] sung during the song [...] "Thoughtless", a cover of a Korn song. The lawsuit claimed that while the album {{contained}} this explicit word, there was no Parental Advisory sticker <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>package.</b> It also claimed that this album violated Wal-Mart's policy of not stocking music with explicit lyrics, and {{that the company had}} {{to be aware of the}} problem because the word was dubbed out of a free sample on the Walmart.com website. The lawsuit was resolved by court order of a deal which would allow those people who bought the album at a Maryland Wal-Mart location to receive a refund.
