40|$|ABSTRACT An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine the effect of varying dietary supplemental inclusion levels of <b>onion</b> <b>and</b> garlic mixture on semen quality characteristics of Koekoek breeder cocks aged 35 - 41 weeks. The experimental diets were isocaloric and isonitrogenous but with different supplemental inclusion levels of <b>onion</b> <b>and</b> garlic. A complete randomized design was used for the experiment. The three dietary supplemental levels based on garlic <b>and</b> <b>onion</b> supplemental inclusion levels were Q 0 (0 g <b>onion</b> <b>and</b> 0 g garlic per 600 g DM feed), Q 1 (2. 5 g <b>onion</b> <b>and</b> 2. 5 g garlic per 600 g DM feed), and Q 2 (5 g <b>onion</b> <b>and</b> 5 g garlic per 600 g DM feed) with each treatment having three replicates. A quadratic type equation was used to determine the <b>onion</b> <b>and</b> garlic levels for optimum semen quality characteristics. Daily supplementation with 5 g <b>onion</b> <b>and</b> 5 g garlic per 600 g DM feed increased progressive motile cells (%), actual life sperm count (× 106 /nl), and live sperm (%) by 221. 20 %, 301. 51 %, and 352. 43 %, while 2. 5 g <b>onion</b> <b>and</b> 2. 5 g garlic per 600 g DM feed reduced them by 28. 67 %, 12. 69 %, and 19. 00 %, respectively. However, daily supplementation with 2. 5 g <b>onion</b> <b>and</b> 2. 5 g garlic per 600 g DM feed increased sperm count (× 106 /nl) by 12. 82 %, whereas daily supplementation with 5 g <b>onion</b> <b>and</b> 5 g garlic per 600 g DM feed reduced it by 10. 26 % in Koekoek breeder cocks. Dietary <b>onion</b> <b>and</b> garlic supplemental inclusion levels of 3. 009, 3. 191, 4. 621, 6. 601, 6. 719, 2. 327, 2. 385, and 2. 247 g per 600 g DM feed supported optimum progressive motile cells (%), immotile sperm cells (%), actual dead sperm count (× 106 /nl), actual live sperm count (× 106 /nl), live sperm (%), acrosome morphology defects (%), acrosome detachment (%), and acrosome swelling (%), with probability values ranging from 0. 003 to 0. 783, whereas minimum progressive motile cells (%) increase was achieved at an optimum <b>onion</b> <b>and</b> garlic supplementation levels of 3. 009 g per 600 g DM feed. These findings have a lot of implications on the use of supplemental <b>onion</b> <b>and</b> garlic inclusion levels to enhance reproductive efficiency in Koekoek breeder cocks...|$|R
