5|$|As the {{performance}} of gliders improved in the 1960s, the concept <b>of</b> <b>flying</b> {{as far away as}} possible became unpopular with the crews who had to retrieve the gliders. Pilots now usually plan to fly around a course (called a task) via turn-points, returning to the starting point.|$|E
5|$|Flights are {{generally}} of short duration, rapid, low-leveled, and wavelike. The wings during flight are flapped rapidly, and are frequently used during foraging. They are also capable <b>of</b> <b>flying</b> vertically {{from the base}} of a tree to the top in a single wing assisted bound.|$|E

40|$|The term “formation flying” implies coordinated {{movement}} {{of at least}} two satellites on coplanar and non-coplanar orbits with a maximum distance between them being much less than the length of the orbit. Peculiarities <b>of</b> formation <b>flying</b> concept also include: - automatic coordination of satellites; - sub-group specialization <b>of</b> formation <b>flying</b> satellites; - equipment and data exchange technology unification in each specialized group or subgroup. Formation flying satellites can be classified according to the configuration stability level (order (array), cluster («swarm»), intergroup specialization rules («central satellite», «leader», «slave»), manoeuvrability («active» and «passive» satellites). Tasks <b>of</b> formation <b>flying</b> include: - experiments with payload, distributed in formation flying satellites; - various near-earth space and earth-surface research; - super-sized aperture antenna development; - land-based telescope calibration; - «space advertisement» (earth-surface observable satellite compositions of a logotype, word, etc.); - orbital satellite maintenance, etc. Main issues <b>of</b> formation <b>flying</b> satellite system design are: - development of an autonomous satellite group manoeuvring technology; - providing a sufficient characteristic velocity <b>of</b> formation <b>flying</b> satellites; - ballistic and navigation maintenance for satellite formation flying; - technical and economic assessment <b>of</b> formation <b>flying</b> orbital delivery and deployment; - standardization, unification, miniaturization and integration of equipment; - intergroup and intersatellite function redistribution. </p...|$|R
50|$|In many countries, {{including}} the United States, powered paragliding is minimally regulated and requires no licence. The ability to fly both low and slow safely, the 'open' feel, the minimal equipment and maintenance costs, and the portability are {{claimed to be}} this type <b>of</b> <b>flying's</b> greatest merits.|$|R
5|$|The first RAF trial CAM launch {{was from}} Empire Rainbow, at Greenock on the River Clyde on 31 May 1941; the Hurricane landed at Abbotsinch. Six CAM ships joined convoys in June 1941. When a CAM ship arrived at its destination, the pilot usually {{launched}} and landed {{at a nearby}} airfield to get in as much flight time as possible before his return trip. Pilots were rotated out of CAM assignments after two round-trip voyages to avoid the deterioration <b>of</b> <b>flying</b> skills from the lack <b>of</b> <b>flying</b> time during the assignment.|$|E

5|$|At 17, Smith {{became the}} {{youngest}} ever flight instructor in U.S. Army history after receiving just under 57 hours <b>of</b> <b>flying</b> instruction.

He was promoted to second lieutenant and stayed in the United States for the duration of his service duties.|$|E
5|$|Biological {{structures}} or sequences {{in different}} taxa are homologous {{if they are}} derived from a common ancestor. Homology thus implies divergent evolution. For example, many insects (such as dragonflies) possess two pairs <b>of</b> <b>flying</b> wings.

5|$|Born in Michigan, Sebille {{worked as}} an MC in Chicago, Illinois before joining the U.S. Army Air Corps shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.

Sebille briefly became a commercial airline pilot after the war before he was offered a commission as a first lieutenant and reentered the service in July 1946.|$|E
5|$|Boyd {{suffered}} from a fear <b>of</b> <b>flying,</b> which had on occasion caused difficulties in his football career. Chosen by the Birmingham County Football Association for a representative match in Hamburg in 1953, the players were already at the airport when he requested to be omitted from the team. While his teammates flew to Birmingham's Fairs Cup match in Milan, Boyd travelled across the English Channel by boat and then across France and into Italy by train.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{was carried}} out {{simultaneously}} at Banak, Alta Airport and Kirkenes Airport, Høybuktmoen, which combined would give Finnmark three primary airports. All three airports opened on 4 May 1963, while Tromsø Airport opened the following year. Services were at first operated by Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS). At first the airline used 56-passenger Convair CV-440 Metropolitan aircraft, which flew flights south to Oslo in combination with flights to Alta and Kirkenes—from 1964 also to Tromsø. The general route scheme <b>of</b> <b>flying</b> multi-legged flights from Oslo to Finnmark would remain until 1990.|$|E
