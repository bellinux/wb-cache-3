40|$|Combatants in war inflict untold devastation. They lay {{waste the}} environment, destroy {{cultural}} heritage, wound, maim, and kill. Most importantly, they kill. These deeds would be, {{in any other}} context, paradigmatically unjust. This thesis asks whether they can be justi-fied. There are two possible approaches: first, deny that killing in war is in fact unjust; sec-ond, argue that the injustice is overridden by weightier moral reasons. In Part I, I reject the view that principles of self-defence can render killing in war just. I argue that the most plausible theories of self-defence are hardest to apply in the cha-otic context of war, while the most practicable theories are least philosophically defensible. Moreover, none of them encompasses the inevitable noncombatant deaths that all wars bring. If killing in war is almost always unjust, perhaps we should advocate pacifism. In Part II, I propose an alternative, arguing that these injustices might be all things con-sidered justified. Combatants have morally important relationships: they have deep personal relationships with friends and family, and comrades-in-arms; if they are citizens of just communities, then that relationship is valuable too. I argue that they have associative <b>duties</b> <b>to</b> protect these relationships against {{the threat posed by}} war, and that these duties may override the injustices they must commit to avert that threat. After defending a conception of associative duties, I support this conclusion with the following argument. As well as <b>our</b> general <b>duties</b> not <b>to</b> harm, we have general <b>duties</b> <b>to</b> protect. <b>Our</b> general <b>duties</b> <b>to</b> protect sometimes override <b>our</b> general <b>duties</b> not <b>to</b> harm, in particular, in cases of justified humanitarian intervention. <b>Our</b> associative <b>duties</b> <b>to</b> protect, however, are stronger than <b>our</b> general <b>duties</b> <b>to</b> protect. If <b>our</b> associative <b>duties</b> <b>to</b> protect are stronger than <b>our</b> general <b>duties</b> <b>to</b> protect, and <b>our</b> general <b>duties</b> <b>to</b> protect can override <b>our</b> general <b>duties</b> not <b>to</b> harm, then <b>our</b> associative <b>duties</b> <b>to</b> protect should also be able <b>to</b> override <b>our</b> general <b>duties</b> not <b>to</b> harm.

40|$|What {{morality}} requires {{of us in}} a {{world of}} poverty and inequality depends both on what <b>our</b> <b>duties</b> are in the abstract, and on {{what we can do to}} help. T. M. Scanlon's contractualism addresses the first question. I suggest that contractualism isolates the moral factors that frame our deliberations about the extent of our obligations in situations of need. To this extent, contractualism clarifies our common-sense understanding of <b>our</b> <b>duties</b> <b>to</b> distant others. The second, empirical question then becomes vital. What we as individuals need to know is how <b>to</b> fulfil <b>our</b> <b>duties</b> <b>to</b> the distant poor. Moral theorists tend to base their prescriptions on simple assumptions about how the rich can help the poor. Yet a survey of the empirical literature shows how urgently we need more information on this topic before we can know what contractualist morality — or any plausible morality — requires of us...|$|R

500|$|According to {{historian}} Mark McLeod, these postulated {{explanations of}} Định's behaviour are plausible, given the chaos engulfing Vietnam {{at the time}} and the lack of conclusive documentation. However, Định and his supporters asserted their loyalty to the monarch and justified their struggle in his name, {{both before and after the}} signing of the treaty. These declarations show no hint of rejecting Tự Đức's authority nor any reference to a worthier, idealised monarch. Conversely, many of these proclamations display an intense feeling of personal loyalty. A placard that French forces found floating downstream near Định's base in Gò Công asserted: [...] "Gratitude ties us to our king. We will avenge the insults he has received , or we will die for him." [...] One of Định's proclamations to his followers read: [...] "The Emperor does not recognise us, but it is indeed <b>our</b> <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> carry on our struggle.... The Emperor calls us rebels, but in the depth of his heart he cannot help but praise our loyalty.

[...] Yusuf al-Qaradawi, a prominent Islamic theologian, called for a day of anger from Muslims in response to {{the cartoons}}. He supported calls for a UN resolution that [...] "categorically prohibits affronts to prophetsto the prophets of the Lord and His messengers, to His holy books, and to the religious holy places". He also castigated governments around the world for inaction on the issue, saying, [...] "Your silence over such crimes, which offend the Prophet of Islam and insult his great nation, is what begets violence, generates terrorism, and makes the terrorists say: Our governments are doing nothing, and we must avenge our Prophet ourselves.

Borussia faced stronger opponents in the semi-finals, when they were drawn with the then five times champions of Europe; Milan. Nevertheless, Borussia won the first leg 4–0, after a hat-trick from Márcio Amoroso, and a goal on 63 minutes from Jörg Heinrich. Milan manager Carlo Ancelotti admitted he was not surprised with the result, stating that, [...] "We knew they had quick strikers. I am more surprised by the terrible performance of our team.

[...] In the second leg, Milan won 3–1, with Filippo Inzaghi, and Cosmin Contra scoring within 18 minutes. However, Milan did not get their third goal until injury time when Serginho scored a penalty after Inzaghi was adjudged to have been pulled back by Christoph Metzelder. With Milan still needing one goal to force extra time, Lars Ricken scored for Dortmund in the fourth minute of injury time to put the club into their first European final since winning the 1997 Champions League Final.|$|E
