25|$|Domestic {{violence}} {{was not a}} part of the Brazilian criminal code until 2006, when the federal criminal domestic violence code was passed by President Lula. The Law of Domestic and Family Violence was the first <b>official</b> <b>codification</b> of domestic violence crimes, and tripled the previous punishments associated with domestic violence. Brazil's adoption of the domestic violence code was mainly influenced by its participation in the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), the urging of the international legal community, and the tenacity of local grassroots movements. The formation of women's police units and a federally funded hotline to serve victims of gender violence have significantly advanced the protections offered to women in Brazil, though domestic violence in Brazil remains prevalent and thus a major obstacle in attaining equal rights for women. In 2015, Brazil enacted a law against femicide.|$|E

The thesis then focuses on responsibility of international organizations in various branches of international public law - it discusses questions of contractual and tort liability, of attribution in UN peacekeeping missions, and of the rights of individuals to due process when dealing with responsibility of international organizations. The following is an analysis of the importance of codification of international law and the contribution of non-official codification activities for the work of the International Law Commission as the main codification organ of the United Nations.

A legislative branch agency within the Library of Congress, the Congressional Research Service, used different terms to clarify the confusion by defining the rail services with top speeds less than 150 mph to be higher-speed rail. There is no current train service in the United States which meets all of the domestic criteria for high-speed rail.

5000|$|The {{name has}} been given also to a {{canonical}} collection officially known as [...] "Decretales Clementis Papæ VIII". It owes the name of [...] "Liber Septimus" [...] to Cardinal Pinelli, prefect (president) of the special congregation appointed by Sixtus V {{to draw up a}} new ecclesiastical code, who, in his manuscript notes, applied this title to it; Fagnanus and Benedict XIV imitated him in this, and it has retained the name. It was to supply the defect of an <b>official</b> <b>codification</b> of the canon law from the date of the publication of the [...] "Clementinæ" [...] (1317), that Gregory XIII appointed about the year 1580 a body of cardinals to undertake the work. In 1587 Sixtus V established the congregation mentioned above. The printed work was submitted to Clement VIII, in 1598 for his approbation, which was refused. A new revision undertaken in 1607-08 had a similar fate, the reigning pope Paul V declining to approve the [...] "Liber Septimus" [...] as the obligatory legal code of the Church. It is divided into five books, subdivided into titles and chapters, and contains disciplinary and dogmatic canons of the Council of Florence, First Lateran Council and that of Trent, and apostolic constitutions of twenty-eight popes from Gregory IX to Clement VIII. The refusals of approbation by Clement VIII and Paul V are to be attributed, not to the fear of seeing the canons of the Council of Trent glossed by canonists (which was forbidden by the Bull of Paul IV, [...] "Benedictus Deus", confirming the Council of Trent), but to the political situation of the day, several states having refused to admit some of the constitutions inserted in the new collection, and also {{to the fact that the}} Council of Trent had not yet been accepted by the French Government; it was therefore feared that the Governments would refuse to recognize the new code. It also seems a mistake to have included in the work decisions that were purely and exclusively dogmatic and as such entirely foreign to the domain of canon law. This collection, which appeared about the end of the sixteenth century, was edited by François Sentis ("Clementis Papæ VIII Decretales", Freiburg, 1870).|$|E
40|$|Many {{scholars}} perceive {{state sovereignty}} as absolute, inviolable, indivisible, final, binding and stagnant. That perception emanates from inter alia political, social, cultural and environmental contexts {{of the modern}} era. Most literature converge that the doctrine of sovereignty first received <b>official</b> <b>codification</b> at the Peace Treaty of Westphalia in 1648. Contemporary international norms, particularly the Responsibility to Protect (R 2 P) doctrine, are arguably an environment and culture of current global politics. With human rights and democracy having taken centre-stage in contemporary political discourses, sovereignty is affected and influenced by such developments in international politics. Hence the argument that globalisation, among others, has eroded, weakened and rendered the doctrine of sovereignty obsolete. This study, using Zimbabwe‟s Operation Murambatsvina as a case study, demonstrates that sovereignty is neither unitary in practice, nor sacrosanct; it is dynamic and evolves, thus, in need of constant reconfiguration. To this end, the study uses the qualitative research methodology. Political SciencesM. A. (International Politics...|$|E
40|$|After {{providing}} {{an outline of}} the process of differentiation between Bulgarian and Macedonian, the author presents an historical overview of the standpoints of the most eminent linguists from before World War II (even before the <b>official</b> <b>codification</b> of Macedonian) to the present, who hold Macedonian to be an individually formed language in relation to Bulgarian. Such differences of systemic character indicate that Macedonian developed differently and differentiated itself continually over the centuries from Bulgarian. In this sense, they are two autochthonous entities, two diasystems, which due to a series of geographical, social, culturo-historical, language contact factors from the very beginning began to differentiate within the Souft Slavic and Balkan context, i. e. to develop from two Old Slavonic variants, that diverged further through the process of Balkanisation which was radical and primarily in Macedonian, i. e. central in contrast to the Bulgarian situation, and ultimately gave rise to two separate literary standards. 18 page(s...|$|E

The standards that these companies must follow are not uniformly applied to all companies, so the majority of accountants’ work comes from assuring that each company’s subjective interpretation of the standards is appropriate. The end goal is to produce a set of financial statements that are free of any material misstatements to be used and analyzed by potential investors. Each section herein contains a different case, each containing a unique accounting issue that was evaluated and solved on an individual basis using financial accounting knowledge, <b>official</b> <b>codification,</b> and some independent research.
