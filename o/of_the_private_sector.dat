5|$|The {{increasing}} role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> {{forms an}} important {{trend in the}} ADF's logistics arrangements. During the 1990s many of the ADF's support functions were transferred {{to the private sector}} to improve the efficiency with which they were provided. Since these reforms most of the 'garrison' support services at military bases have been provided by private firms. The reforms also led to many of the ADF's logistics units being disbanded or reduced in size. Since this time private firms have increasingly been contracted to provide critical support to ADF units deployed outside Australia. This support has included transporting equipment and personnel and constructing and supplying bases.|$|E

This distribution is constructed by integrating <b>the</b> conditional distribution <b>of</b> wages for <b>the</b> <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> with respect to <b>the</b> distribution <b>of</b> characteristics for <b>the</b> public sector. This quantity is well defined if <b>the</b> support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>private</b> <b>sector’s</b> characteristics includes <b>the</b> support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> public sector characteristics. The conditional distribution is estimated using linear quantile regression (100 regressions are estimated). Bootstrap standard errors are estimated using 50 repetitions.|$|R
