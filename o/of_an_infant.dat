5|$|Burial 278 {{was that}} <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>infant,</b> {{deposited}} in a cist under {{the floor of}} Terrace 1 Structure 5 in the acropolis. It was unaccompanied by any offering, the few ceramic fragments found associated with the cist were dated to the Late Classic Period. The remains were laid out on their back, with the skull oriented to the south.|$|E

In 1977, she assumed the alias Alice Louise Metzinger, taking the name from the birth certificate <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>infant</b> that had died the year before her birth. In 1979, she moved west to Oregon and {{gave birth to a}} son, Jamie, by an unknown father.|$|E

5|$|Rumination {{syndrome}} {{presents itself}} {{in a variety of}} ways, with especially high contrast existing between the presentation of the typical adult sufferer without a mental disability and the presentation <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>infant</b> and/or mentally impaired sufferer. Like related gastrointestinal disorders, rumination can adversely affect normal functioning and the social lives of individuals. It has been linked with depression.|$|E
5|$|Even in {{the absence}} of an impact, {{significant}} acceleration or deceleration of the head can cause TBI; however in most cases a combination of impact and acceleration is probably to blame. Forces involving the head striking or being struck by something, termed contact or impact loading, are the cause of most focal injuries, and movement of the brain within the skull, termed noncontact or inertial loading, usually causes diffuse injuries. The violent shaking <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>infant</b> that causes shaken baby syndrome commonly manifests as diffuse injury. In impact loading, the force sends shock waves through the skull and brain, resulting in tissue damage. Shock waves caused by penetrating injuries can also destroy tissue along the path of a projectile, compounding the damage caused by the missile itself.|$|E
5|$|Relations {{between the}} Song and Liao {{remained}} tense and hostile: in 986 the Song sent three armies against the Liao {{in an effort}} to take advantage <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>infant</b> emperor and recapture the Sixteen Prefectures, but the Liao successfully repulsed all three armies. Following this, diplomatic relations were resumed. Relations between Song and Liao worsened in the 990s. From 993 to 1004, the Liao observed the Song as the latter built a 'Great Ditch' in northern Hebei province from the Taihang Mountains in the west {{all the way to the}} Bohai Sea in the east. This was essentially a series of canals meant to block the advance of Liao cavalry far from the northern border line, although the Liao perceived this engineering project as a means for the Song to dispatch offensive forces more efficiently via new waterways. In 999 the Liao began annual attacks on Song positions, though with no breakthrough victories. The Liao were interested in capturing the Guannan region of northern Hebei, both because the Song general Zhou Shizong had taken it from them and because it contained strategic passes.|$|E

5|$|The law courts' {{jurisdiction}} over the guardianship of children {{is said to have}} come from the King's prerogative of parens patriae. The Chancery had administered this area of law from an early period, since it primarily concerned the holding of land– a form of trust. Since these were mainly dealt with orally there are few early records; the first reference comes from 1582, when a curator was appointed to deal with the property <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>infant.</b> While the common law courts regularly appointed guardians, the Chancery had the right to remove them, replace them or create them in the first place. Similarly, while there were actions against guardians which the child could undertake in the common law courts, these were regularly undertaken in the Court of Chancery. This jurisdiction was first regularly recognised from 1696 onwards, and its main focus was the welfare of the child. As such, wards of the court had certain principles: their estates had to be administered {{under the supervision of the}} Court, they had to be educated under the same supervision, and any marriage had to be sanctioned by the Court.|$|E

25|$|Infant {{mortality}} {{is the death}} <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>infant</b> {{in the first year}} of life, often expressed as the number of deaths per 1000 live births (infant mortality rate). Major causes of infant mortality include dehydration, infection, congenital malformation and SIDS.|$|E
50|$|Observation or {{recognition}} <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>infant's</b> sex may {{be complicated}} {{in the case}} of intersex infants and children, and in cases of early trauma. In such cases, sex assignment is generally taken to require medical treatment to confirm that assignment, but this is disputed in part due to the human rights implications of such treatment.|$|R
5000|$|Sex {{assignment}} (sometimes {{known as}} gender assignment) is the determination <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>infant's</b> sex at birth. [...] In the majority <b>of</b> births, <b>a</b> relative, midwife, nurse or physician inspects the genitalia {{when the baby}} is delivered, and sex and gender are assigned, without the expectation of ambiguity. Assignment may also be done prior to birth through prenatal sex discernment.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{many other}} sensory systems, the human visual system - {{components}} from {{the eye to}} neural circuits - develops largely after birth, especially {{in the first few}} years of life. At birth, visual structures are fully present yet immature in their potentials. From the first moment of life, there are a few innate components <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>infant's</b> visual system. Newborns can detect changes in brightness, distinguish between stationary and kinetic objects, as well as follow kinetic objects in their visual fields. However, many of these areas are very poorly developed. With physical improvements such as increased distances between the cornea and retina, increased pupil dimensions, and strengthened cones and rods, <b>an</b> <b>infant's</b> visual ability improves drastically. The neuro- pathway and physical changes that underlie these improvements in vision remains a strong focus in research. Because <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>infant's</b> inability to verbally express their visual field, growing research in this field relies heavily on non-verbal cues including <b>an</b> <b>infants</b> perceived ability to detect patterns and visual changes. The major components of the visual system can be broken up into visual acuity, depth perception, color sensitivity, and light sensitivity.|$|R

25|$|One of {{the customs}} {{following}} the birth <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>infant</b> was for an Angakkuq (shaman) {{to place a}} tiny ivory carving of a whale into the baby's mouth, in hopes this would make the child good at hunting. Loud singing and drumming were also customary after a birth.|$|E
50|$|The {{symmetrical}} tonic neck reflex (STNR) is {{a primitive}} reflex that normally emerges {{during the first}} year <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>infant's</b> life and is diminished by 2-3 years.

5000|$|Parastremmatic {{dwarfism}} {{is apparent}} at birth, with affected infants usually being described as [...] "stiff", or as [...] "twisted dwarfs" [...] when the skeletal deformities and appearance of dwarfism further present themselves.

25|$|The primary {{function}} of the breasts, as mammary glands, is the feeding and nourishing <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>infant</b> with breast milk during the maternal lactation period.
