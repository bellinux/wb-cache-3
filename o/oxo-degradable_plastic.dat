These plastics are mainly based on polyethylene and contain additives that cause the plastic to undergo oxidative degradation by a process accelerated by light and/or heat. The approach used in the study has been to review the published research on oxo-degradable plastics, assess other literature available in the public domain, and also to engage with stakeholders throughout the life cycle of the product. The main {{purpose of the study was}} to assess what happens at the end of life of the plastics and whether this has a beneficial effect. The study concluded that incorporating additives into petroleum-based plastics to accelerate their degradation does not improve their environmental impact and potentially gives rise to certain negative effects. In particular there is concern that these plastics are neither suitable for conventional recycling methods, due to the presence of degradation accelerators, nor suitable for composting, due to the lack of biodegradability. There is also concern about the fate of <b>oxo-degradable</b> <b>plastic</b> fragments in the environment...|$|E

New degradable {{materials have}} been proven successful for increasing crop productivity; however, their degradation in the field has been hardly addressed. A qualitative scale was {{used in the present study}} to assess the above-soil and in-soil degradation of degradable mulches during the cropping season. Degradation was determined in three biodegradable plastic mulches (Biofilm, BF; Mater-Bi, MB; Bioflex, BFx), two paper sheet mulches (Saikraft, PSA; MimGreen, PMG) and one <b>oxo-degradable</b> <b>plastic</b> mulch (Enviroplast, EvP). Polyethylene (PE) mulch was used as control. Mulches were tested in five Spanish locations (Castilla-La Mancha, La Rioja, Navarra, Aragón and Catalunya), with three crop seasons of processing tomato. Biodegradable plastic mulches BF and MB degraded more and faster above-soil than paper mulches; among biodegradable mulches BF degraded more than MB, and MB more than BFx. The above-soil degradation of the oxo-degradable mulch EvP was highly dependent on location and crop season, and it degraded more than PE. Main environmental factors triggering above-soil degradation were radiation, rainfall and crop cover. In-soil, paper mulches and BF degraded more and faster than MB, whereas BFx and EvP barely degraded. Environmental factors triggering in-soil degradation during the crop season were rainfall and irrigation water. The effect of soil parameters (organic matter, nutrient availability) on degradation during the cropping season was not evidenced. The qualitative scale used proved convenient for determining mulch field degradation. A visual scale for supporting the qualitative evaluation is provided. In order to standardise parameters and criteria for future studies on field mulching degradation evaluation, a unified degradation qualitative scale is suggested.

40|$|The {{widespread}} {{consumption of}} <b>oxo-degradable</b> polyethylene <b>plastics</b> in Indonesia is potentially cause pollution. This {{problem can be}} overcome by utilizing plastic degrading-bacteria as degradation agent. The present study aims to isolate and characterize of oxo-degradable polyethylene degrading-bacteria from Benowo landfill soil Surabaya. Isolation and screening {{was done by the}} culture technique and clear zone method. Total abundance of bacteria was calculated based on the Total Plate Count method. Bacterial colonies screening was done based on morphological characteristics and the diameter of clear zone. Four isolates with the largest diameter of clear zone were futher characterized based on cell morphology and physiology biochemistry characters. The results showed the average of total abundance of oxo-degradable polyethylene degrading- 4 - 1 bacteria of Benowo landfill was 1. 28 x 10 CFU g. The four of twelve isolates with the largest diameter of clear zone showing the highest degradation capability, that were isolates A 221 (0. 7 cm), A 231 (1 cm), A 232 (0. 6 cm), and C 231 (1. 3 cm). Colony morphology characteristics of four isolates were generally shape of circular and irregular; margin of entire and lobate; elevation of flat; optics of opaque; and pigmentation of yellow, greenish and cream. These four isolates were Gram negative with the shape bacilli and cell size range of 3 - 4 µm. Physiological and biochemical characteristics among the four isolates were resistant to acidic conditions; non...|$|R
