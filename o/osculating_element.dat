40|$|The {{theory of}} {{numerical}} averaging and analytical averaging will be reviewed {{and the application}} of these techniques to orbit and parameter estimation problems will be presented. Comparisons will be made between utilizing mean elements versus tracking data as the observation types. Results will be presented comparing the accuracy and efficiency of the combined orbit estimation and orbit prediction problem using averaged equations of motion, the Cowell equations of motion and the Brouwer general perturbation theory. The problem of converting the averaged element space back to <b>osculating</b> <b>element</b> space for orbit operations will also be discussed...|$|E
40|$|A semianalytic {{method to}} predict the orbit of a {{spacecraft}} orbiting a planet and perturbed by oblateness and a gravity anomaly (mascon) is presented. The Hamiltonian is first expressed in closed form {{in terms of the}} nonsingular canonical set of Poincare elements where the mascon is represented by a point-mass. The planet global potential is limited to the second and third harmonics. The mascon potential in harmonics is limited to second degree and first order. The original Lie-Hori method is then applied to transform the canonical equations of motion from the <b>osculating</b> <b>element</b> space to the mean element space. Numerical integration of the new equations is used...|$|E
50|$|Thus a {{particular}} coordinate system (equinox and equator/ecliptic of {{a particular}} date, such as J2000.0) could be used forever, but a set of <b>osculating</b> <b>elements</b> for a particular epoch may only be (approximately) valid for a rather limited time, because <b>osculating</b> <b>elements</b> such as those exampled above do not show the effect of future perturbations which will change {{the values of the}} elements.|$|R
50|$|An {{osculating orbit}} and the object's {{position}} upon {{it can be}} fully described by the six standard Keplerian orbital <b>elements</b> (<b>osculating</b> <b>elements),</b> which are easy to calculate {{as long as one}} knows the object's position and velocity relative to the central body. The <b>osculating</b> <b>elements</b> would remain constant in the absence of perturbations. However, real astronomical orbits experience perturbations that cause the <b>osculating</b> <b>elements</b> to evolve, sometimes very quickly. In cases where general celestial mechanical analyses of the motion have been carried out (as they have been for the major planets, the Moon, and other planetary satellites), the orbit can be described by a set of mean elements with secular and periodic terms. In the case of minor planets, a system of proper orbital elements has been devised to enable representation of the most important aspects of their orbits.|$|R

Special attention is devoted to pseudo-circular orbits and terminal values of <b>osculating</b> <b>elements.</b> The obtained results complete those of Klacka and Kaufmannova (1992) and Breiter and Jackson (1998). Terminal values of <b>osculating</b> <b>elements</b> presented in Breiter and Jackson (1998) are of no physical sense due to the fact that relativistic equation of motion containing only first order of v⃗/c was used in the paper...|$|R
40|$|We {{calculate}} the evolution and gravitational-wave emission of a spinning compact object inspiraling into a substantially more massive (non-rotating) black hole. We extend our previous {{model for a}} non-spinning binary [Phys. Rev. D 93, 064024] to include the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon spin-curvature force. For spin-aligned binaries we {{calculate the}} dephasing of the inspiral and associated waveforms relative to models that do not include spin-curvature effects. We find this dephasing can be either positive or negative depending on the initial separation of the binary. For binaries in which the spin and orbital angular momentum are not parallel, the orbital plane precesses and we use a more general <b>osculating</b> <b>element</b> prescription to compute inspirals.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model is developed {{for studying the}} effects of gravity gradient torque on the attitude stability of a tumbling triaxial rigid satellite. Poisson equations are used to investigate {{the rotation of the}} satellite (which is in elliptical orbit about an attracting point mass) about its center of mass. An averaging method is employed to obtain an intermediate set of differential equations for the nonresonant, secular behavior of the <b>osculating</b> <b>elements</b> which describe the rotational motions of the satellite, and the averaged equations are then integrated to obtain long-term secular solutions for the <b>osculating</b> <b>elements...</b>|$|R

40|$|By using Von Zeipel's {{generating}} function procedure the perturbing earth gravitational potential is averaged {{with respect to}} the fast variable (mean anomaly) and a set of 'fictitous' mean orbital elements which {{can be used as a}} long-term satellite orbit predictor is obtained. The set of elements is shown to be a function of the nonlinear square of the second zonal harmonic coefficient. It is found that the long-term orbit prediction using the 'fictitous' mean elements is as accurate as that using the <b>osculating</b> <b>elements,</b> but has a computing speed about two orders of magnitude faster. For short-term orbit predictions, the <b>osculating</b> <b>elements</b> approach must be used...|$|R
40|$|Mean element {{propagation}} of perturbed two body orbits {{has as its}} mathematical basis averaging theory of nonlinear dynamical systems. Averaged mean elements define the long-term evolution characteristics of an orbit. Using averaging theory, a near identity transformation can be found that transforms the mean elements back to the <b>osculating</b> <b>elements</b> that contain short period terms {{in addition to the}} secular and long period mean elements. The ability to perform the conversion is necessary so that orbit design conducted in mean elements can be converted back into osculating results. In the present work, this near identity transformation is found using the Fast Fourier Transform. An efficient method is found that is capable of recovering the <b>osculating</b> <b>elements</b> to first orde...|$|R
40|$|Analysis of the luni-solar tidal {{perturbations}} of {{the inclination}} of GEOS- 1 (1965 - 89 A) and GEOS- 2 (1968 - 002 A) yielded the values k 2 = 0. 22 (sigma = 0. 02) and 0. 31 (sigma = 0. 01) respectively {{for the second}} degree Love number. For GEOS- 1 a new, purely numerical method involving <b>osculating</b> <b>elements</b> was employed. For GEOS- 2 {{it was necessary to}} analyze the variations of the mean elements because of the very long period (450 d) of the dominant solar tidal perturbation. An additional analysis of the variation of the mean elements of GEOS- 1 confirmed the value of k 2 obtained from the <b>osculating</b> <b>elements...</b>|$|R
50|$|Because even {{satellites}} in low Earth orbit experience significant perturbations (primarily from Earth's non-spherical shape), the Keplerian elements {{computed from}} the state vector at any moment are only valid at that time. Such element sets are known as <b>osculating</b> <b>elements</b> because they coincide with the actual orbit only at that moment.|$|R
5000|$|For most bodies, the <b>osculating</b> <b>elements</b> are {{relatively}} {{close to the}} proper elements because precession and perturbation effects {{are relatively}} small (see diagram).

40|$|The {{current state}} of minor planet ephemerides was assessed, and the means for {{providing}} and updating these emphemerides for use by both the mission planner and the astronomer were developed.

The computer based system furnishes the <b>osculating</b> <b>elements</b> {{for all of the}} numbered minor planets at an adopted date of October 10, 1972, and at every 400 day interval over the years of interest. It also furnishes the perturbations in the rectangular coordinates relative to the <b>osculating</b> <b>elements</b> at every 4 day interval. Another computer program was designed and developed to integrate the perturbed motion of a group of 50 minor planets simultaneously.

5000|$|The proper {{elements}} can be {{contrasted with}} the <b>osculating</b> Keplerian orbital <b>elements</b> observed {{at a particular time}} or epoch, such as the semi-major axis, eccentricity, and inclination. Those <b>osculating</b> <b>elements</b> change in a quasi-periodic and (in principle) predictable manner due to such effects as perturbations from planets or other bodies, and precession (e.g. perihelion precession). In the Solar System, such changes usually occur on timescales of thousands of years, while proper elements are meant to be practically constant over at least tens of millions of years.|$|R
50|$|In the {{particular}} set of coordinates exampled above, much of the time-dependence of the elements has been omitted as unknown or undetermined; for example, the element n allows an approximate time-dependence of the element M to be calculated, but the other elements and n itself are treated as constant, which represents a temporary approximation (see <b>Osculating</b> <b>elements).</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Osculating</b> <b>elements</b> {{at a given}} epoch {{are always}} an {{approximation}} to an object's orbit (i.e. an unperturbed conic orbit or a [...] "two-body" [...] orbit).

40|$|Orbit {{determination}} and ephemeris generation or prediction over relatively long elapsed times {{can be accomplished}} with mean elements. The most simple and efficient method for orbit determination, which {{is also known as}} epoch point conversion, performs the conversion of <b>osculating</b> <b>elements</b> to mean elements by iterative procedures. Previous epoch point conversion methods are restricted to shorter elapsed times with linear convergence. The new method presented in this paper calculates an analytic initial guess of the unknown mean elements from a first order theory of secular perturbations and computes a transition matrix with accurate numerical partials. It thereby eliminates the problem of an inaccurate initial guess and an identity transition matrix employed by previous methods. With a good initial guess of the unknown mean elements and an accurate transition matrix, converging <b>osculating</b> <b>elements</b> to mean elements can be accomplished over long elapsed times with quadratic convergence...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{expands the}} idea of Vokrouhlicky ́ and Nesvorny ́ who used a {{modified}} Zappala ̀ et al. metric with <b>osculating</b> <b>elements</b> in search for pairs of asteroids suspected of having a common origin. Using six different orbital similarity functions, we find that five of them display a similar excess of close pairs in the catalogue of <b>osculating</b> <b>elements.</b> The excess is even higher when mean orbital elements are used. Similarly, when the mean elements are applied, {{there is a better}} agreement between the closest pairs found in the same catalogue using different metrics. The common subset of 62 pairs from five lists of 100 closest pairs according to different distance functions is provided. Investigating an artificial sample of asteroid orbital pairs with a known initial orbital velocity difference we find that the Drummond metric best preserves orbital proximity over long time intervals...|$|R

40|$|The precise {{analytic}} solution {{with the}} reference orbit eccentricity and perturbation effects {{is needed for}} the relative motion of formation flying satellites. Since Hill’s equations have considerable errors and are insufficient {{for the long term}} prediction of the relative motion, the new approach, called geometric method, is proposed to obtain the state transition matrix as a precise solution under the effects due to the reference orbit eccentricity and the gravitational perturbations. Based on the transformation and the state transition matrix for the relative orbital elements, the geometric method gives a precise solution in closed form to 1 st order in J 2 for the non-circular reference orbit with mean orbital elements under the existence of the gravitational perturbation J 2. Finally, using the transformation matrix from the mean <b>elements</b> to the <b>osculating</b> <b>elements</b> in powers of the eccentricity, the state transition matrix of the relative motion with the <b>osculating</b> <b>elements</b> is derived without solving the differential equations.

40|$|We {{revisit the}} Lagrange's system of {{equations}} for the six <b>osculating</b> <b>elements,</b> {{in the context of}} long-term planetary-orbit integration. An accurate re-examination of the derivation of Lagrange's system shows that, in fact, the orbit is always located not in the 6 -dimensional space of the <b>osculating</b> <b>elements,</b> but in a certain 3 -dimensional submanifold. If an analytic solution to Lagrange's system were available, it would obey this demand. However, whatever numerical integrator will cause drift away from this submanifold. This will result in a new type of accumulating numerical error that will be especially significant at long time spans. We point out an adjustment to be instilled in the integrator, that would eliminate this error. We point out that the choice of the said submanifold is mathematically equivalent to fixing a gauge in field theory. The existing freedom of subminifold choice (~=~freedom of gauge fixing) reveals a symmetry (and a fibre bundle structure) hiding behind Lagrange's system. Just as a choice of the convenient gauge simplifies calculations in electrodynamics, the freedom in choice of the submanifold may, potentially, lead to simpler schemes of orbit integration...|$|R

40|$|The {{visibility}} {{times and}} communication link dynamics for the Earth Observations Satellite (EOS) -McMurdo Sound direct downlinks have been studied. The 16 day EOS periodicity may be shown with the Goddard Trajectory Determination System (GTDS) {{and the entire}} 16 day period should be simulated for representative link statistics. We desire many attributes of the downlink, however, and a faster orbital determination method is desirable. We use the method of <b>osculating</b> <b>elements</b> for speed and accuracy in simulating the EOS orbit. The accuracy of the method of <b>osculating</b> <b>elements</b> is demonstrated by closely reproducing the observed 16 day Landsat periodicity. An autocorrelation function method is used to show the correlation spike at 16 days. The entire 16 day record of passes over McMurdo Sound is then used to generate statistics for innage time, outage time, elevation angle, antenna angle rates, and propagation loss.

One practical result of this comparison is seen to be the rare occurrence of zenith passes. The new result is functionally different than the earlier result, with a heavy emphasis on low elevation angles.
