40|$|ABSTRACT: Most of the {{theories}} developed for the estimation of pull <b>out</b> <b>capacity</b> of anchors are based on assumptions on the shape of rupture surface. The failure surfaces have been simplified by the researchers to simplify the computation of pull <b>out</b> <b>capacity.</b> Hence, {{there is a wide}} deviation between theoretical and experimental results. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are data driven modeling techniques which are extremely effective in handling dynamic, uncertain and non-linear data especially when the underlying physical relationship is not fully understood. The conventional back propagation networks employs the gradient descent optimization technique which may get stuck in local minima and parameters determined based on that may not be optimal whereas Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm {{is one of the most}} efficient higher order adaptive algorithms and often find better optima. This study explores the potential of ANN trained using LM algorithm for the estimation of pull <b>out</b> <b>capacity</b> of circular anchors embedded in cohesionless soils. Bayesian regularization technique has been used to avoid over fitting. The results are highly encouraging as the model is able to explain more than 99 % of the variance. The performance of ANN model is compared with that of the four theoretical methods. The trained ANN and the theoretical models were extensively evaluated for performance based on various statistical indices. The root-mean- square error, coefficient of efficiency and Mean bias error values for the ANN model for test data are 3. 758 kN, 0. 997 and 0. 132 kN respectively, while these values for the theoretical methods ranged from 14. 2...|$|E
