40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{international}} best practices <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> machinery valuation and to establish the common valuation concept, awareness and application of valuation methodology and valuation process for <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> machinery valuation in Malaysia. Using a qualitative approach, the content analyses were conducted from the international practices and current Malaysian implementation <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> machinery valuation. A quantitative approach, via questionnaire, was distributed amongst the registered and probationary valuers in Malaysia to investigate their understanding and opinion relating to <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> machinery valuation based on their current practices. The significance {{of this research is}} the identification <b>of</b> international <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> machinery practices and the understanding of current practices <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> machinery valuation in Malaysia. It found the main issues impacting on <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> machinery valuation practices in Malaysia are the limited numbers of resources available either from scholars or practitioners. This is supported by the findings from the research survey which indicates that there are immediate needs for practical notes or guidelines to be developed and implemented to support the Malaysian valuers practising <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> machinery valuation. This move will lead to a better understanding <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> machinery valuation, reducing discrepancies in the valuation <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> machinery and increased accuracy among practising valuers...|$|R

5|$|Like {{the rest}} of the {{southern}} Blue Ridge Mountains, Vogel State Park and the surrounding area consists of many valleys, ridges and mountains formed by repeated plate tectonic movement and collisions, starting with the Grenville Orogeny nearly 1.5 billion years ago.

5|$|A final {{decision}} was deferred {{until after the}} 1951 election. This resulted in a change of government, with the Conservative Party returning to power and Churchill replacing Attlee as Prime Minister. On 27 December 1951, the High Commissioner of the United Kingdom to Australia informed Menzies of the British government's decision to use Monte Bello. On 26 February 1952, Churchill announced in the House of Commons that the first British atomic bomb test would occur in Australia {{before the end of}} the year. When queried by a Labour Party backbencher, Emrys Hughes, about the impact on the local flora and fauna, Churchill joked that the survey team had only seen some birds and lizards. Among the AERE scientists was an amateur biologist, Frank Hill, who collected samples of the flora and fauna on the islands, teaming up with Commander G. Wedd, who collected marine specimens from the surrounding waters. In a paper published by the Linnean Society of London, Hill catalogued over 400 species <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> <b>and</b> animals. This included 20 new species of insects, six <b>of</b> <b>plants,</b> <b>and</b> a new species of legless lizard.|$|E
5|$|A {{large number}} of civic or {{municipal}} botanical gardens were founded in the 19th and 20th centuries. These did not develop scientific facilities or programmes, but the horticultural aspects were strong and the plants often labelled. They were botanical gardens {{in the sense of}} building up collections <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> <b>and</b> exchanging seeds with other gardens around the world, although their collection policies were determined by those in day-to-day charge of them. They tended to become little more than beautifully maintained parks and were, indeed, often under general parks administrations.|$|E
5|$|About 10% of Lord Howe Island's forests {{have been}} cleared for agriculture, and another 20% has been disturbed, mostly by {{domestic}} cattle and feral sheep, goats and pigs. As a result, 70% {{of the island}} remains relatively untouched with a variety <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> <b>and</b> animals, {{many of which are}} endemic, some of which are rare or threatened. Two species of plants, nine terrestrial birds, one bat and at least four invertebrates have become extinct since 1778. Endemism at the generic level includes the palms Howea, Hedyscepe and Lepidorrhachis, a woody daisy Lordhowea, the tree Negria, the leech Quantenobdella howensis, three annelid worm genera (Paraplutellus, Pericryptodrilus and Eastoniella), an isopod shrimp Stigmops, a hemipteran bug Howeria and a cricket Howeta.|$|E

5|$|Adults have {{forewings}} {{that are}} yellowish brown {{in color and}} have a dark spot located {{in the center of}} their body. The moths have a wingspan ranging from 32 to 45mm, and live over thirty days in optimal conditions. However, the life span ranges from five to fifteen days on average. They are nocturnal and hide in vegetation during the day. Adult moths collect nectar or other plant exudates from a large number <b>of</b> <b>plants,</b> <b>and</b> live for 12 to 16 days. Females can lay up to 2,500 eggs in their lifetime.|$|E
5|$|After the Clarno volcanoes had subsided, {{they were}} {{replaced}} about 36million {{years ago by}} eruptions from volcanoes to the west, in the general vicinity of {{what would become the}} Cascade Range. The John Day volcanoes, as they are called, emitted large volumes of ash and dust, much of which settled in the John Day basin. As with the earlier Clarno debris flows, the rapid deposition of ash preserved the remains <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> <b>and</b> animals living in the region. Because ash and other debris fell during varied climatic and volcanic conditions and accumulated from many further eruptions extending into the early Miocene (about 20million years ago), the sediment layers in the fossil beds vary in their chemical composition and color. Laid down on top of the Clarno Strata, the younger John Day Strata consist of several distinct groups of layers. The lowermost contains red ash such as that exposed in the Painted Hills Unit. The layer above it is mainly pea-green clay. On top of the pea-green layer are buff-colored layers. Fossils found in the John Day Strata include a wide variety <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> <b>and</b> more than 100 species of mammals, including dogs, cats, oreodonts, saber-toothed tigers, horses, camels, and rodents. The Blue Basin and the Sheep Rock unit contain many of these same fossils, as well as turtles, opossums, and large pigs. More than 60 plant species are fossilized in these strata, such as hydrangea, peas, hawthorn, and mulberry, as well as pines and many deciduous trees. One of the notable plant fossils is the Metasequoia (dawn redwood), a genus thought to have gone extinct worldwide until it was discovered alive in China in the early 20thcentury.|$|E
5|$|Ampelosaurus atacis {{is known}} from a {{specimen}} from the Marnes Rouges Inférieures Formation.

Even though it produced many vertebrates, the formation only has a few elements <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> <b>and</b> invertebrates. The vertebrates consist of numerous remains of Ampelosaurus, scales of Lepisosteus, shell fragments of an indeterminate turtle, cranial fragments and teeth of a crocodile, isolated theropod teeth, classified as Dromaeosauridae indet., an indeterminate ankylosaur, and a dentary and many postcranial elements of Rhabdodon priscus. The bird Gargantuavis philoinos, and dinosaur eggs have also been recovered.|$|E
