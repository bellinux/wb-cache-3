In January 2004 he was alleged to have {{assaulted}} a man during a raid <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>home.</b> In November 2004, on his request, Harwood was transferred back to the Met. There were three more complaints after that, before the incident with Tomlinson.|$|E
5|$|Desmond Jennings {{opened the}} first inning with a single, but was thrown out at second base trying to stretch the hit into a double. Wil Myers then walked, {{advanced}} to third base on singles by Ben Zobrist and Evan Longoria, and finally scored on a sacrifice fly by Delmon Young. Rays starter David Price struck out leadoff batter Ian Kinsler, then allowed a walk to Elvis Andrus but picked him off and finished the inning by retiring Alex Ríos. The score remained 1–0 until {{the top of the}} third inning, when Jennings drew a walk and scored <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>home</b> run by Longoria to give the Rays a 3–0 lead. The Rangers struck right back in the bottom half, as Craig Gentry led off the inning with a single. After advancing to second on a Leonys Martín groundout, he scored on a single to right field by Kinsler. The Rays scored again in the sixth, as Longoria doubled to lead off the inning, and advanced to third base on a groundout by Young. The next batter, David DeJesus, hit a double to right field that scored Longoria and put the Rays ahead, 4–1. Rangers reliever Alexi Ogando entered the game with one out and recorded the final two outs to end the inning.|$|E
5|$|The game {{remained}} scoreless in {{the early}} innings, with only two baserunners apiece for each team through the first three innings. The Giants loaded the bases with two outs {{in the top of}} the 4th inning, but Brian Johnson struck out to end the inning. The first runs of the game came in the bottom of the 5th as Henry Rodriguez singled to lead off the inning and scored <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>home</b> run by Gary Gaetti to give the Cubs a 2–0 lead. The Cubs threatened again in the next inning with singles by Lance Johnson and Sammy Sosa. Rich Rodriguez relieved Gardner, but loaded the bases with a walk to Mark Grace and allowed a single to Matt Mieske which scored two more runs and extended the Cubs' lead to 4–0. John Johnstone relieved Rodriguez and closed the inning without further scoring.|$|E

5|$|The game {{remained}} tied through nine innings, forcing extra innings. There too {{the game}} stayed tied until {{the top of}} the 13th inning when Giles singled off of Jorge Julio and scored <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>home</b> run by Scott Hairston. Ramón Ortiz relieved Julio and no further runs scored in the inning, but the Padres entered the bottom of the 13th with an 8–6 lead. The Padres brought in Trevor Hoffman to secure the game and a wild-card victory. However, Hoffman blew the save, allowing doubles to Matsui and Tulowitzki and a triple to Holliday which tied the game 8–8. Hoffman then intentionally walked Todd Helton leaving baserunners at first and third base. Carroll then hit a line drive to right fielder Brian Giles. Holliday tagged up at third and slid headfirst on a close play at home plate. Home plate umpire Tim McClelland ruled Holliday safe on the sacrifice fly, and the Rockies won the game 9–8.|$|E
5|$|Affeldt {{spent the}} entire 2007 season in the bullpen, where he {{was used as a}} lefty specialist. Affeldt had a 2.15 ERA through his first fiftysix games of the year. He did not give up a home run until Pete Laforest hit one off of him in an 119 loss to the San Diego Padres on August 16. He {{struggled}} {{at the end of the}} year, with a 7.30 ERA in his final nineteen games. He still finished the year 43, with a 3.51 ERA in seventy-five games, and the Rockies made the playoffs as the NL Wild Card. He made his postseason debut on October 4 in the Division Series against the Philadelphia Phillies and gave up one run (<b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>home</b> run by Ryan Howard) in one inning in a 105 win by Colorado. The Rockies swept the series to advance to the Championship Series against the Arizona Diamondbacks. In the first game, Affeldt entered with two outs and the bases loaded with the Rockies leading 51. He retired Stephen Drew to help the Rockies win 5–1. The Rockies swept the Diamondbacks to meet the Boston Red Sox in the World Series. Affeldt pitched in all four games of the World Series without giving up a run, but the Rockies were swept by the Red Sox. Affeldt became a free agent after the season.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} pitch thrown by Harvey, Alcides Escobar hit an inside-the-park home run, {{the first in a}} World Series game since Mule Haas in the 1929 World Series, and the first hit by a leadoff batter since Patsy Dougherty did it for the Boston Americans in the 1903 World Series. In the fourth inning, Murphy {{recorded}} the Mets' first hit, and later scored their first run on a hit by Travis d'Arnaud. Curtis Granderson hit a home run in the fifth inning to give the Mets a 2–1 lead. The Mets took a 3–1 lead {{in the top of the}} sixth when Michael Conforto drove in Yoenis Céspedes with a sacrifice fly. Mike Moustakas then saved a run with a diving stop and throw out to first to end the top of the sixth. Eric Hosmer reduced the lead to 3–2 with a sacrifice fly, and set a new Royals' postseason run batted in (RBI) record in the process. A single by Moustakas tied the game at three, but in the top of the eighth, Wilmer Flores reached on an fielding error by Hosmer, allowing Juan Lagares to score the go-ahead run and give the Mets a 4–3 lead. In the bottom of the ninth with the Mets 2 outs away from taking Game 1, Alex Gordon tied the game for the Royals with a home run to deep center field, as Jeurys Familia blew his first save in six postseason opportunities and his first since July 30. With the home run, Gordon became the first player since Scott Brosius in the 2001 World Series, and just the fifth player in history, to tie a World Series game <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>home</b> run in the ninth inning.|$|E

5|$|The Dodgers {{cut into}} {{the lead in the}} fourth, as Snider doubled to lead off, {{advanced}} to third on a Tommy Davis single, and scored on a groundout by Frank Howard. The Giants threatened against Podres {{in the top of the}} sixth with singles by Cepeda, Ed Bailey, and Jim Davenport on a bunt to load the bases. However, Ed Roebuck relieved Podres and escaped the inning without allowing a run. The Dodgers took a 3–2 lead in the bottom of the inning as Snider singled and scored <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>home</b> run by Tommy Davis. They extended this lead in the bottom of the seventh as Wills singled and then stole second as Jim Gilliam batted. Manager Alvin Dark had chosen not to try to hold Wills to the first base bag as Dark did not believe his Giants' defense could stop Wills from stealing regardless of their positioning. Gilliam was put out for the second out of the inning, but Wills stole third base and then scored on a throwing error by the catcher trying to catch him. This extended the Dodgers' lead to 4–2. The Dodgers further threatened in the bottom of the eighth. Don Larsen entered in relief of Marichal midway through Davis' at bat but Davis walked to lead off the inning regardless. Ron Fairly sacrificed him to second base and Davis then stole third as Howard struck out. However, Larsen intentionally walked both Roseboro and Willie Davis to load the bases and induced a ground out by Roebuck to end the inning.|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between <b>a</b> <b>home's</b> sale price and {{its proximity to}} different open spaces types is explored using a data set comprised of single-family home sales {{in the city of}} Portland, within Multnomah County, between 1990 and 1992. Homes located within 1, 500 feet of a natural area park, where more than 50 % of the park is preserved in native and/or natural vegetation, are found to experience, on average, the largest increase in sale price. The open space size that maximizes <b>a</b> <b>home's</b> sale price is calculated for each open space type. Natural area parks require the largest acreage to maximize sale price, and specialty parks are found to have the largest potential effect <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>home's</b> sale price. <b>A</b> zonal approach is used to examine the {{relationship between}} <b>a</b> <b>home's</b> sale price and its distance to an open space. Natural area parks and specialty parks are found to have a positive and statistically significant effect <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>home's</b> sale price for each zone studied. Homes located adjacent to golf courses (within 200 feet) are estimated to experience the largest increase in sale price due to open space proximity although the effect drops off quickly as distance from the golf course increases.

Then, the seven group winners along with the defending champions qualified to the quarterfinals. The quarterfinals, semifinals, and finals were played as a two-legged format, with away goals, extra time, and penalties used as tie-breakers.|$|E
