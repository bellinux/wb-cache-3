5|$|Around 1800, Europeans began {{settling}} the land east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> River that was inhabited by the Chickasaw Indians for centuries {{prior to the}} arrival of Europeans. Chickasaw land in West Tennessee and southwestern Kentucky was ceded in the Jackson Purchase after negotiations in which the United States was represented by General Andrew Jackson and Governor Isaac Shelby, while the Chickasaw were represented by their chiefs and warriors. In 1818, both sides agreed to the transfer by signing the Treaty of Tuscaloosa. In the treaty, the United States agreed to pay the Chickasaw $300,000 in return for the right to the land east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> River and north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> state line.|$|E
5|$|General Kirby Smith {{tried to}} send {{reinforcements}} from his Army of the Trans-Mississippi east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> River to relieve Vicksburg, Mississippi, {{in the spring}} of 1864 following the Battle of Mansfield and the Battle of Pleasant Hill. This was not practicable due to the Union naval control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> River. Smith instead dispatched Major General Sterling Price and his cavalry on an invasion of Missouri that was ultimately not successful. Thereafter the war west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> River was principally one of small raids. By May 26 a representative of Smith's negotiated and signed surrender documents with a representative of Major General Edward Canby. Canby in Shreveport, Louisiana, then took custody of Smith's force of 43,000 soldiers when they surrendered, by then the only significant Confederate forces left west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> River. With this ended all organized Southern military resistance to the Union forces. Smith signed the surrender papers on June 2 on board the U.S.S. Fort Jackson just outside Galveston Harbor.|$|E

The Tipton Phase people and the Chickasaw Indian tribe populated the Mississippi River valley near Randolph during the Mississippian period. In 1541, Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto crossed the Mississippi River at or near Randolph.

5|$|Halleck {{appointed}} Pope {{to command}} the Army <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> (and the District <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi,</b> Department of the Missouri) on February 23, 1862. Given 25,000 men, {{he was ordered to}} clear Confederate obstacles on the Mississippi River. He made a surprise march on New Madrid, Missouri, and captured it on March 14. He then orchestrated a campaign to capture Island No. 10, a strongly fortified post garrisoned by 12,000 men and 58 guns. Pope's engineers cut a channel that allowed him to bypass the island. Assisted by the gunboats of Captain Andrew H. Foote, he landed his men on the opposite shore, which isolated the defenders. The island garrison surrendered on April 7, 1862, freeing Union navigation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> as far south as Memphis.|$|E

5|$|On November 3, 1762, {{as part of}} the Treaty of Fontainebleau, France ceded {{the portion}} of Louisiana west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> River to Spain.

Although the Louisiana colony was a financial liability, King Carlos III of Spain reluctantly accepted it, as that meant France was finally ceding its claim to Texas. At the Treaty of Paris on February 10, 1763, Great Britain recognized Spain's right to the lands west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi.</b> Great Britain received the remainder of France's North American territories, and Spain exchanged some of their holdings in Florida for Havana.|$|E

5|$|Several {{tropical}} cyclone warnings and watches were issued {{in association with}} Tropical Storm Edouard. At 2100UTC on August3, a tropical storm watch was posted from Intracoastal City, Louisiana to Port O'Connor, Texas. Simultaneously, a tropical storm warning was issued from Intracoastal City to the mouth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> River in Louisiana. The tropical storm watch was upgraded to a hurricane watch early on August4. Around that time, the tropical storm warning was extended from the mouth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> River to Cameron, Louisiana. At 0900UTC on August4, the tropical storm warning was revised to reach San Luis Pass, Texas. The hurricane watch was modified from Grand Isle, Louisiana to Sargent, Texas. The tropical storm warning was extended to include the mouth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> River to Port O'Connor at 1500UTC on August5. At that time, the tropical storm warning was modified again to stretch from San Luis Pass to Cameron. Late on August5, all {{tropical cyclone}}s were discontinued.|$|E
5|$|Spain had, since 1763, {{controlled}} the lands west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> River, Spanish Louisiana, plus New Orleans on its east bank. Great Britain, between 1763 and 1783, {{controlled the}} lands east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi,</b> British Florida, north from the Gulf of Mexico. Spain gained possession of British Florida south of 31° N and claimed {{the rest of}} itnorth to 32° 22′ (the junction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> and Yazoo Rivers). Thereafter, Spain attempted to slow the migration of American settlers into the region, and to lure those already there to secede from the United States. Toward this end, in 1784 the Spanish closed New Orleans to American goods coming down the Mississippi, which was the only viable outlet for the goods produced by many American settlers, and also began selling weapons to the Indian tribes in the Yazoo.|$|E

5|$|Thanks to the {{decision}} of Potawatomi leaders to aid the U.S. during the war, American officials did not seize tribal land as war reparations. Instead, only three individuals accused of leading the Indian Creek massacre were tried in court; they were acquitted. Nevertheless, the drive to purchase Potawatomi land west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> began in October 1832, when commissioners in Indiana bought {{a large amount of}} Potawatomi land, even though not all Potawatomi bands were represented at the treaty.

50|$|Another {{possible}} course {{change for}} <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> River is a diversion into Lake Pontchartrain near New Orleans.

This spillway and an imperfect natural levee about 4-6 meters (12 to 20 feet) high are all that prevents <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> from taking a new, shorter course through Lake Pontchartrain to <b>the</b> Gulf <b>of</b> Mexico. Diversion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi's</b> main channel through Lake Pontchartrain would have consequences similar to an Atchafalaya diversion, but to a lesser extent, since the present river channel would remain in use past Baton Rouge and into the New Orleans area.|$|R
