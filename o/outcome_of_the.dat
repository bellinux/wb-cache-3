30|$|For <b>the</b> second aim <b>of</b> this paper, {{we assume}} a network {{consists}} of several complete components {{and a complete}} network. Firstly, <b>the</b> stability <b>of</b> components does not generate a stable overall network. When comparing <b>the</b> <b>outcomes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stable components <b>of</b> a network with <b>the</b> <b>outcomes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> complete network consisted <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same size <b>of</b> each component, we find that <b>the</b> individual <b>outcomes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> complete components are smaller than <b>the</b> <b>outcomes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> complete network. Secondly, comparing <b>the</b> <b>outcomes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> complete giant component with <b>the</b> <b>outcomes</b> <b>of</b> other components of a network shows that the individual outcomes are higher in the giant component.|$|R
30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  7, <b>the</b> {{individual}} <b>outcomes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> giant complete component GC {{is higher than}} <b>the</b> <b>outcomes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anther component C_ 2.|$|R
30|$|To {{evaluate}} whether this expansion in <b>the</b> definition <b>of</b> disability under <b>the</b> ADAAA has impacted <b>the</b> labor market <b>outcomes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> obese, I take a similar empirical approach as Carpenter (2006), who previously examined a related question. This paper asks whether the 2008 ADAAA has improved labor market <b>outcomes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> obese; Carpenter {{asked whether the}} 1990 ADA improved labor market <b>outcomes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> obese. Specifically, Carpenter examined whether employment <b>outcomes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> obese improved after Cook, the sole positive federal court decision under the 1990 ADA. Carpenter found that employment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> obese, but not the morbidly obese, increased after 1993 (<b>the</b> year <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cook decision) by two percentage points for men and four percentage points for women nationwide.|$|R

5|$|Herodotus {{tells us}} that, on seeing the <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> battle {{hung in the}} balance, the {{disarmed}} Samians had joined in {{on the side of}} the allies, doing what they could. This inspired the other Ionian contingents to turn on the Persians as well. At which stage in the battle this happened is not clear; the Samians were presumably not in the main battle line (being disarmed), so it may have been after the Persians retreated to the camp. Meanwhile, the Milesians who were guarding the passes of Mycale also turned on the Persians. At first they misdirected the fleeing Persian contingents so that they ended up back amongst the Allied troops; then, perhaps seeing the <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> battle was certain, they began killing the fleeing Persians.|$|E

30|$|To <b>the</b> best <b>of</b> our knowledge, {{there is}} a paucity of {{comparative}} studies regarding <b>the</b> <b>outcomes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four treatments; therefore, we conducted a retrospective, single institutional and comparative study evaluating oncological and functional <b>outcomes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four commonly used treatments for localized prostate cancer.|$|R
30|$|In {{a bid to}} seek clarity, a {{systematic}} review addressing <b>the</b> long-term <b>outcomes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> medial approach was conducted. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> this review was to identify, appraise and synthesise the best evidence pertaining to <b>the</b> long-term <b>outcomes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> MAOR for developmental dysplasia <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hip in children.|$|R

When the Byzantines were defeated and started to flee, Bodin retreated with his army. The Turks who had been lent {{to him by the}} Seljuk Sultan Suleyman I followed Constantine's example.|$|E
5|$|Persian agents or Palmyrene traitors: the {{possibility}} of a Persian involvement exists but the <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> assassination would not have served Shapur without establishing a pro-Persian monarch on the Palmyrene throne.

5|$|The Court has no {{original}} {{jurisdiction in}} most cases, {{meaning that it}} can only hear cases appealed to the Court after having been previously heard in lower courts. Most cases begin in local circuit courts, where the initial trial is held and a jury decides the <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> case. The circuit court decision can be appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals or the Indiana Tax Court, who can hear the case or enforce the lower court's decision. If the parties still disagree with the <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> case, they can appeal the decision to the Indiana Supreme Court. The Court can choose {{to hear the case}} and possibly overturn the previous judgment, or it can decline to accept the case and uphold the decision of the lower courts.|$|E
