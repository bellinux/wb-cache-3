5|$|Orangutan {{hands are}} similar to human hands; they have four long fingers and an opposable thumb. However, the joint and tendon {{arrangement}} in the orangutans' hands produces two adaptations that are significant for arboreal locomotion. The resting configuration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> is curved, creating a suspensory hook grip. Additionally, {{without the use of}} the thumb, the fingers and hands can grip tightly around objects with a small diameter by resting the tops <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> against the inside of the palm, creating a double-locked grip.|$|E
5|$|Several {{anomalies}} {{affecting the}} digits (fingers and toes) {{have been observed}} with the syndrome. A broadening of the thumbs and big toes (halluces) was reported in two brothers. The broadening was apparent in all distal phalanges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fingers,</b> although the pinkies were unaffected yet appeared to be clinodactylic (warped, or bent toward the other fingers). Additional eports described this broadness of the thumbs and big toes, with brachydactyly (shortness) in the distal phalanges of the other digits except the pinkies in affected individuals. On X-rays of a two-year-old boy with the disorder, the brachydactyly was shown {{to be caused by}} shortening of epiphyses (joint-ends) of the distal phalanges. The broadness and brachydactyly of the big toes in particular may give them a stunted, rounded and stub-like appearance.|$|E
5|$|Some {{clinical}} {{symptoms and}} signs {{have been named}} after Hippocrates as he {{is believed to be}} the first person to describe those. Hippocratic face is the change produced in the countenance by death, or long sickness, excessive evacuations, excessive hunger, and the like. Clubbing, a deformity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> and fingernails, is also known as Hippocratic fingers. Hippocratic succussion is the internal splashing noise of hydropneumothorax or pyopneumothorax. Hippocratic bench (a device which uses tension to aid in setting bones) and Hippocratic cap-shaped bandage are two devices named after Hippocrates. Hippocratic Corpus and Hippocratic Oath are also his namesakes. The drink hypocras is also believed to be invented by Hippocrates. Risus sardonicus, a sustained spasming of the face muscles may also be termed the Hippocratic Smile.|$|E

30|$|Furthermore, {{we assumed}} that <b>the</b> shear {{deformation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> pad is <b>the</b> unique factor that determines the skin deformation at the radial side. This indicates that only <b>the</b> tangential translation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> motion is considered, and the rotation around and translation along <b>the</b> longitudinal axis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> should {{not interfere with the}} skin deformation at the radial side. In the experiments, only tangential finger motions were allowed. Furthermore, the participants attempted to maintain <b>the</b> posture <b>of</b> their <b>finger.</b> Nonetheless, <b>the</b> frequency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rotational motion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> is smaller than <b>the</b> active range <b>of</b> <b>the</b> miniature accelerometer that we used.|$|R
5|$|In a {{symbolic}} act, the first rivet placed into the skin, fixing a copper plate onto the statue's big toe, {{was driven by}} United States Ambassador to France Levi P. Morton. The skin was not, however, crafted in exact sequence from low to high; work proceeded {{on a number of}} segments simultaneously in a manner often confusing to visitors. Some work was performed by contractors—one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> was made to Bartholdi's exacting specifications by a coppersmith in the southern French town of Montauban. By 1882, the statue was complete up to the waist, an event Barthodi celebrated by inviting reporters to lunch on a platform built within the statue. Laboulaye died in 1883. He was succeeded as chairman of the French committee by Ferdinand de Lesseps, builder of the Suez Canal. The completed statue was formally presented to Ambassador Morton at a ceremony in Paris on July 4, 1884, and de Lesseps announced that the French government had agreed to pay for its transport to New York. The statue remained intact in Paris pending sufficient progress on the pedestal; by January 1885, this had occurred and the statue was disassembled and crated for its ocean voyage.|$|E
5|$|Slow lorises have a {{powerful}} grasp with both their hands and feet due to several specializations. They can tightly grasp branches with little effort because of a special muscular arrangement in their hands and feet, where the thumb diverges at nearly 180° from the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fingers,</b> while the hallux (big toe) ranges between being perpendicular and pointing slightly backwards. The toes have a large flexor muscle that originates on {{the lower end of}} the thigh bone, which helps to impart a strong grasping ability to the hind limbs. The second digit of the hand is short compared to the other digits, while on the foot, the fourth toe is the longest. The sturdy thumb helps to act like a clamp when digits three, four, and five grasp the opposite side of a tree branch. This gives their hands and feet a pincer-like appearance. The strong grip can be held for hours without losing sensation due to the presence of a rete mirabile (network of capillaries), a trait shared among all lorises. Both slender and slow lorises have relatively short feet. Like nearly all lemuriforms, they have a grooming claw on the second toe of each foot.|$|E

30|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accelerometers {{was fixed}} to <b>the</b> side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> by using {{adhesive}} tape. This attachment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accelerometer does not alter either the stiffness or <b>the</b> viscosity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> pad, {{and does not}} lead to any subjective influences on the textures experienced by wearers. Another was mounted on the contactor on which <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> pad was placed, to measure <b>the</b> acceleration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> pad’s deformation. <b>The</b> displacement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vibrating contactor was small, being a maximum of ± 2.5  mm, for which <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> pad does not slip on the contactor. Hence, <b>the</b> displacement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contactor is in good agreement with that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> pad. <b>The</b> sensitivity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accelerometers was set along the X-axis. The outputs from both accelerometers were recorded at 8  kHz.|$|R
40|$|Human finger pad {{friction}} and <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> surface {{features on the}} fingerprint ridges, shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> and <b>the</b> material properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> were investigated. <b>The</b> friction coefficients for three fine-grit abrasive papers were measured to assess these effects. Four probing surfaces were used: human index finger pad, silicone replicas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> with and without fingerprints, and a smooth silicone sphere. Friction tests were performed at a constant normal load of 0. 5 N in two probe orientations: normal and perpendicular to <b>the</b> orientation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fingerprint ridges. Scanning electron microscopy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> abrasive papers was performed to examine their surface topography. Based on the trends in coefficients of friction, topography <b>of</b> <b>the</b> abrasive papers, surface features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> pad, and <b>the</b> shape and elastic properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>finger,</b> possible friction mechanisms were discussed. It was inferred that the change in <b>the</b> shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> probe (from a sphere to <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> shape) changes <b>the</b> adhesion and deformation components <b>of</b> friction, <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> fingerprints adds an interlocking contribution to the {{friction and}} decrease the adhesion and deformation components <b>of</b> friction, and <b>the</b> elastic properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> {{lead to an increase}} in all <b>the</b> three components <b>of</b> friction...|$|R

50|$|Peripheral stimuli are {{generally}} {{applied to the}} limbs, and a common technique is squeezing <b>the</b> lunula area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> or toe nail, often with an adjunct such as a pen. Like the sternal rub, though, this can cause bruising, and is recommended against, in favour <b>of</b> squeezing <b>the</b> side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>finger.</b>|$|R

40|$|We study fracturelike flow instabilities {{that arise}} when water is {{injected}} into a Hele-Shaw cell filled with aqueous solutions of associating polymers. We explore various polymer architectures, molecular weights, and solution concentrations. Simultaneous measurements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> tip velocity and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pressure at the injection point {{allow us to}} describe <b>the</b> dynamics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> mobility, which relates the velocity to the pressure gradient. The flow discontinuities, characterized by jumps in <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> tip velocity, which are observed in experiments with some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> polymer solutions, can be modeled by using a nonmonotonic dependence between a characteristic shear stress and the shear rate at <b>the</b> tip <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>finger.</b> A simple model, {{which is based on}} a viscosity function containing both a Newtonian and a non-Newtonian component, and which predicts nonmonotonic regions when <b>the</b> non-Newtonian component <b>of</b> <b>the</b> viscosity dominates, is shown to agree with the experimental data...|$|R
25|$|The {{anti-cancer}} medication capecitabine {{may cause}} {{the loss of}} fingerprints. Swelling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fingers,</b> such as that caused by bee stings, will in some cases cause the temporary disappearance of fingerprints, though they will return when the swelling recedes.|$|E
