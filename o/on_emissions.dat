5|$|In November 2009, Wright was {{sufficiently}} {{concerned that the}} Climate Change Response (Moderated Emissions Trading) Amendment bill would result in increased emissions that she publicly urged politicians three times not to adopt the National Government's legislation. She opposed the removal of a firm cap <b>on</b> <b>emissions,</b> the reduction of price incentives to reduce emissions, and the heavy subsidies from taxpayers granted to emissions-intensive industry and agriculture by the intensity-based allocation of free units.|$|E
5|$|Observations of 55 Cancri A in the {{submillimeter}} {{region of}} the spectrum have thus far failed to detect any associated dust. The upper limit <b>on</b> <b>emissions</b> within 100AU of this star is about 850mJy, at a wavelength of 850μm.

5|$|The Labour Party {{noted that}} the {{allocation}} of credits to emitters on a 'intensity' basis, with no cap <b>on</b> <b>emissions,</b> meant that emitters would {{have an incentive to}} continue to emit greenhouse gases.

40|$|Although the {{literature}} <b>on</b> <b>emission</b> inequality is abundant, {{this study will}} differentiate itself by focusing <b>on</b> <b>emission</b> inequalities at the household level due to the disparity in household expenditure profiles. We further separate measures <b>on</b> <b>emission</b> inequality based <b>on</b> household characteristics as well as decompose it into sources of emission. Employing a common application for analyzing inequalities, results show that as per capita expenditure increases, within quintiles emission inequality tends to decline until the middle quintiles but then further increases in expenditure level and worsens emission inequality until the richest household. The decomposition of inequality based <b>on</b> <b>emission</b> sources suggests that energy-transportation dominantly contributes of the overall emission inequality...|$|R

25|$|Towards {{the end of}} 2006, the Mayor of London {{proposed}} {{the introduction of a}} variable congestion charge.

25|$|As climate change, {{greenhouse}} gas emissions and pollution have become a major issue for Australia, Sydney {{has in the past}} been criticised for its lack of focus on reducing pollution, cutting back <b>on</b> <b>emissions</b> and maintaining water quality.

The development led to the release of the Metropolitan Air Quality Scheme (MAQS), which led to a broader understanding of the causation of pollution in Sydney, allowing the government to form appropriate responses to the pollution.|$|E
