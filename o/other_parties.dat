5|$|For its actions, the West German {{government}} was criticised by Israel and <b>other</b> <b>parties,</b> {{in some cases}} combined with allegations that the hijacking had been staged or at least tolerated with theories of a secret agreement between the German government and Black September Organization - release of the surviving terrorists in exchange for assurances of no further attacks on Germany.|$|E

40|$|A {{quasi-experiment}} {{tested the}} effects of honor values {{and the use of}} insults by the <b>other</b> <b>party</b> on perceived conflict, negative emotions, and intentions to behave distributively and integratively during a workplace conflict. After honor values were measured, participants read a scenario in which a conflict was described. In the scenarios, we manipulated whether the <b>other</b> <b>party</b> used an insult by describing the <b>other</b> <b>party's</b> statements such that either an insult was uttered or no insult was uttered. Consistent with our hypotheses, results showed that conflicts in which the <b>other</b> <b>party</b> used an insult lead to higher ratings of perceived conflict, more negative emotions, and stronger intentions to engage in distributive behavior than conflicts in which the <b>other</b> <b>party</b> did not use an insult in high-honor-value participants, but not in low-honor-value participants. Mediation analyses showed that the interactive effect of honor values and <b>other</b> <b>party's</b> insults on intentions to behave distributively could be explained by perceived conflict and negative emotions...|$|R

5|$|Abandoning {{their usual}} {{strategy}} {{of trying to}} make major inroads in Liberal-dominated Quebec, the Tories focused on winning seats in the other provinces. They were successful; though they gained few seats in Quebec, they won 112seats overall to the Liberals' 105. With the remaining seats won by <b>other</b> <b>parties,</b> the PC party only had a plurality in the House of Commons, but the margin was sufficient to make John Diefenbaker Canada's first Tory Prime Minister since 1935.|$|E
5|$|After {{assembly}} elections {{across the}} country in 1967, the party entered into a coalition with several <b>other</b> <b>parties,</b> including the Swatantra Party and the socialists. It formed governments in various states across the Hindi heartland, including Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. It {{was the first time the}} Jana Sangh held political office, albeit within a coalition; this caused the shelving of the Jana Sangh's more radical agenda.|$|E
50|$|Under {{contract}} law, in {{a bilateral}} contract {{two or more}} parties owe obligations to each <b>other.</b> Each <b>party</b> acts in reliance that the <b>other</b> <b>party</b> will fulfill their respective obligation. If one party fails to respect their obligation, then the <b>other</b> <b>party</b> or parties may suffer an economic harm. Reliance damages compensate the harmed party/ies {{for the amount of}} damages they suffered for acting in reliance on the <b>other</b> <b>party's</b> contractual obligations. They are most often rewarded when the aggrieved party's damages are not capable of accurate estimation, and ordering Specific Performance would be inappropriate.|$|R

5|$|Before the vote, {{there were}} {{calls for the}} bills to be {{separated}} at the Diet.

Attempts to designate only the Hinomaru as the national flag by the DPJ and <b>other</b> <b>parties</b> during the vote of the bill were rejected by the Diet. The House of Representatives passed the bill on July 22, 1999, by a 403 to 86 vote. The legislation was sent to the House of Councilors on July 28 and was passed on August 9. It was enacted into law on August 13.|$|E

He is restricted to communicating through Take-Two's attorneys on any future matter, but is able to maintain his outspoken stance against their titles and may act as counsel in lawsuits against Take-Two by <b>other</b> <b>parties.</b> For their part, Take-Two agreed to drop the contempt of court lawsuit against Thompson regarding alleged improper conduct during the court hearings for Rockstar's game Bully in 2006.|$|E
50|$|Escrow {{services}} {{are intended to}} ensure security by acting as a middleman in transactions where the two parties do not trust each other. Rather than sending money or goods directly to the <b>other</b> <b>party</b> (which is insecure, as one or the <b>other</b> <b>party</b> must send its item first, at {{the risk that the}} <b>other</b> <b>party</b> may not reciprocate), both parties send their items to the escrow service, which holds them until both items are received, then sends each on to the intended recipient.

5|$|By 1958, the WRU had {{concluded}} that a new national ground was needed due to flooding that often plagued Arms Park. After debate and disputes between the WRU and various <b>other</b> <b>parties,</b> including Cardiff RFC, in the 1960s, {{it was decided that}} a new national stadium would be built with a new ground for the Cardiff club backing onto it. The National Stadium, as it was known, was officially opened in 1970.|$|E
5|$|Electoral success overtook {{the party}} and Janmaat began to make {{controversial}} statements in the media. Based on his conviction that high office should be restricted to third-generation Dutch nationals, he suggested that several cabinet ministers, including Justice Minister Ernst Hirsch-Ballin who was of Jewish descent, and Agriculture State Secretary Dzsingisz Gabor who was of Hungarian descent, should {{be removed from the}} Dutch leadership. This marked the start of prosecutions of Centre Democrats party members on charges of racism, as well as the decision by the <b>other</b> <b>parties</b> in Parliament and government to place a cordon sanitaire around the party.|$|E

With a bombing party of 10 men, who voluntarily undertook this duty, he conveyed {{a supply of}} 96 bombs to within 20 yards of the enemy's position over exceptionally dangerous ground, after the attempts of two <b>other</b> <b>parties</b> had failed. Lieutenant Smyth succeeded in taking the bombs to the desired position {{with the aid of}} two of his men (the other eight having been killed or wounded), and to effect his purpose he had to swim a stream, being exposed the whole time to howitzer, shrapnel, machine-gun and rifle fire.|$|E

If the court is satisfied that such reasonable grounds exist, it may make an interim judgment of presumption of death and of divorce. In such proceedings, the fact that for seven years or more the <b>other</b> <b>party</b> to the marriage has been continually absent from the applicant, and the applicant has {{no reason to believe that}} the <b>other</b> <b>party</b> has been living within that time, is evidence that the missing person is dead until the contrary is proved.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first step}} in {{implementing}} Rule 5 begins with picking the best chooser. Usually, the best chooser is the smallest number party. The best chooser will then have to “compare its own opportunity cost to the opportunity cost (figured by the judge) of the <b>other</b> <b>party</b> or parties.” The second step is {{the implementation of the}} double-reverse twist proposed by Krier and Schwab. First, the judge estimates the <b>other</b> <b>party’s</b> social costs (damages caused by the best chooser). [...] Then, the judge enters an order requiring the best chooser to decide whether to continue causing damage to the <b>other</b> <b>party</b> without receiving any compensation or stop causing damage and receive compensation. [...] Therefore, if the best chooser decides to stop causing harm to the <b>other</b> <b>party,</b> then the <b>other</b> <b>party</b> will have to pay the best chooser damages calculated by the judge. Should the best chooser decide to stay, then the best chooser continues to cause harm and receives no payment.|$|R

On the same day, Labour polled ahead of all <b>other</b> <b>parties</b> at the local elections, winning 31% of the vote and taking control of six additional councils.|$|E
5|$|In the 1945 election, the Communists were unopposed {{because the}} <b>other</b> <b>parties</b> abstained. Once in power, the Communists {{introduced}} a single-party political system, {{in which the}} Communist Party of Yugoslavia was the ruling party and the Communist Party of Croatia was its branch. In 1971, the Croatian national movement, which sought greater civil rights and the decentralisation of the Yugoslav economy, culminated in the Croatian Spring, which was suppressed by the Yugoslav leadership. In January 1990, the Communist Party fragmented along national lines; the Croatian faction demanded a looser federation.|$|E
