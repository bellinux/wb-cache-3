Absorption data indicated deviations from Beer’s law above 10 mM suggesting strong solute-solute interactions at higher concentrations. By scanning {{in a wide range}} of potentials, + 2. 0 to- 2. 0 V, and using 1 mM α-lipoic acid (sodium salt), it was possible to identify the irreversible formation of thiolsulfonate, reversible formation lipoic acid S-oxide, reversible formation <b>of</b> dihydrolipoic <b>acid,</b> and reversible formation of dimers <b>of</b> lipoic <b>acid.</b> The oxidation <b>of</b> dihydrolipoic <b>acid</b> and the dimers <b>of</b> lipoic <b>acid</b> were influenced by the concentration <b>of</b> lipoic <b>acid</b> as well as the scan rate. Evidence is presented for the formation of S-oxides <b>of</b> lipoic <b>acid</b> dimers or higher polymers that are different from lipoic acid S-oxide. In the active region, the cathodic current produced depended on the concentration <b>of</b> α-lipoic <b>acid.</b> The reduction <b>of</b> α-lipoic <b>acid</b> to dihydrolipoic acid was unaffected by the starting anodic potential.

5|$|A {{knowledge}} of pKa values {{is important for}} the quantitative treatment of systems involving acid–base equilibria in solution. Many applications exist in biochemistry; for example, the pKa values of proteins and amino acid side chains are of major importance for the activity of enzymes and the stability of proteins. Protein pKa values cannot always be measured directly, but may be calculated using theoretical methods. Buffer solutions are used extensively to provide solutions at or near the physiological pH for the study of biochemical reactions; the design of these solutions depends on a {{knowledge of}} the pKa values of their components. Important buffer solutions include MOPS, which provides a solution with pH 7.2, and tricine, which is used in gel electrophoresis. Buffering is an essential part <b>of</b> <b>acid</b> base physiology including acid–base homeostasis, and is key to understanding disorders such as acid–base imbalance. The isoelectric point of a given molecule is a function of its pK values, so different molecules have different isoelectric points. This permits a technique called isoelectric focusing, which is used for separation of proteins by 2-D gel polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.|$|E

It is commonly used as a large ornamental tree in eastern Australia, in the North Island of New Zealand, and also in Hawaii and California, where it is also listed as an invasive species in some areas. It is useful as a shade tree in public parks and on golf courses. Not as prodigious as other figs, F. rubiginosa is suited to slightly more confined areas, such as lining car parks or suburban streets. However, surface roots can be large and intrusive and the thin bark readily damaged when struck. Tolerant <b>of</b> <b>acid</b> or alkaline soils, it is hardy to US Hardiness Zones 10B and 11, reaching 10m (35ft) high in 30 years.

The trees are of great value in providing fruit for birds and mammals, though drop large quantities of fruit and leaves, leaving a mess underfoot.|$|E
