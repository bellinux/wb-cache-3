5|$|Brazilian pepper (Schinus terebinthifolius) {{was brought}} to Southern Florida as an <b>ornamental</b> <b>shrub</b> and was {{dispersed}} by the droppings of birds and other animals that ate its bright red berries. It thrives on abandoned agricultural land growing in forests too dense for wading birds to nest in, similar to melaleucas. It grows rapidly especially after hurricanes and has invaded pineland forests. Following Hurricane Andrew, scientists and volunteers cleared damaged pinelands of Brazilian pepper so the native trees {{would be able to}} return to their natural state.|$|E

40|$|The study {{compared}} the air pollution tolerance indices (APTI) of five plant species and five <b>ornamental</b> <b>shrubs</b> in Enugu Urban Center. Laboratory {{analysis was performed}} on the four physiological and biological parameters including leaf relative water content (RWC), ascorbic acid (AA) content, total leaf chlorophyll (TCH) and leaf extract pH. These parameters were used to develop an air pollution tolerance index. Factor analysis and descriptive statistics were utilized in the analysis to examine the interactions between these parameters. Vegetation monitoring in terms of its APTI acts as a B́ioindicatoróf air pollution. The study also showed the possibility of utilizing APTI as a tool for selecting plants or <b>ornamental</b> <b>shrubs</b> for urban heat Island mitigation in Enugu City. The result of APTI showed order of tolerance for plants as Anacarduim occidentale (23. 20), Pinus spp (22. 35), Catalpa burgei (22. 57), Magifera indica (23. 37), and Psidum guajava (24. 15). The result of APTI showed increasing order of sensitivity for <b>ornamental</b> <b>shrubs</b> from ixora red (14. 32), yellow ficus(12. 63), masquerade pine(12. 26), Tuja pine(11. 000),to Yellow bush(10. 60). The APTI of all the plants examined were higher than those of <b>ornamental</b> <b>shrubs.</b> Thus suggesting that plants in general were more tolerant to air pollution than <b>ornamental</b> <b>shrubs.</b> The <b>ornamental</b> <b>shrubs</b> with lower APTI values (sensitive) were recommended as bioindicator of poor urban air quality while plants with high APTI values (tolerant) are planted around areas anticipated to have high air pollution load. The result of this current study is therefore handy for future planning and as well provides tolerant species for streetscape and urban heat island mitigation...|$|R
