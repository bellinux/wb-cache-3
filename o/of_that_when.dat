25|$|For {{this reason}} {{it was not until}} the {{development}} of electric podded propulsion, ABB's Azipod, that the concept of double acting ships became feasible. The superiority of podded propulsion in icebreaking merchant ships, especially when running astern, was proved when Finnish product tankers Uikku and Lunni were converted to Azipod propulsion in 1993 and 1994, respectively. Even though the ships were originally designed with icebreaking capability in mind, after the conversion ice resistance in level ice when running astern was only 40% <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> breaking ice ahead despite the ships being equipped with an icebreaking bow and not designed to break ice astern.|$|E

The German shooting was very accurate, with both armoured cruisers quickly scoring hits on their British counterparts while still outside six-inch gun range, starting fires on both ships. Cradock, knowing his only chance was {{to close the}} range, continued to do so despite the battering that Spee's ships inflicted. By 19:23 the range was almost half <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> the battle began and the British ships bore onwards. One shell from Gneisenau blew the roof off Monmouths forward turret and started a fire, causing an ammunition explosion that completely blew the turret off the ship.|$|E
500|$|Lou Lombardo, having {{previously}} worked with Peckinpah on Noon Wine, was personally {{hired by the}} director to edit The Wild Bunch. Peckinpah had wanted an editor who would be loyal to him. Lombardo's youth was also a plus, as he was not bound by traditional conventions. One of Lombardo's first contributions was to show Peckinpah an episode of the TV series Felony Squad he edited in 1967. The episode, entitled [...] "My Mommy Got Lost", included a slow motion sequence where Joe Don Baker is shot by the police. The scene mixed slow motion with normal speed, having been filmed at 24 frames per second but triple printed optically at 72 frames per second. [...] Peckinpah was reportedly thrilled and told Lombardo: [...] "Let's try some <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> we get down to Mexico!" [...] The director would film the major shootouts with six cameras, operating at various film rates, including 24 frames per second, 30 frames per second, 60 frames per second, 90 frames per second, and 120 frames per second. When the scenes were eventually cut together, the action would shift from slow to fast to slower still, giving time an elastic quality never before seen in motion pictures up to that time.|$|E
500|$|Spee {{immediately}} {{turned to}} close and signalled his ships to open fire at 19:04 when the range closed to [...] Spee's flagship, Scharnhorst, engaged Good Hope while Gneisenau fired at Monmouth. Cradock's flagship was {{hit on the}} Scharnhorsts third salvo, when shells knocked out her forward 9.2-inch turret and set her forecastle on fire. Cradock, knowing his only chance was to close the range, continued to do so despite the battering that Spee's ships inflicted. By 19:23 the range was almost half <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> the battle began and the British ships bore onwards. Spee tried to open the range, fearing a torpedo attack, but the British were only [...] away at 19:35. Seven minutes later, Good Hope charged directly at the German ships, although they dodged out of her way. Spee ordered his armoured cruisers to concentrate their fire on the British flagship and she soon drifted to a halt with her topsides all aflame. At 19:50 her forward magazine exploded, severing the bow {{from the rest of}} the ship, and she later sank in the darkness. Spee estimated that his flagship had made 35 hits on Good Hope, suffering only two hits in return that did no significant damage and failed even to wound one crewman. Good Hope was sunk with all hands, a total of 919 officers and enlisted men. Four of the midshipmen aboard the ship were the first casualties of the newly formed Royal Canadian Navy.|$|E

2500|$|The {{superiority of}} {{electric}} podded propulsion in icebreaking ships, especially when running astern, was proved {{when the first}} propulsion pod was installed on fairway maintenance vessel Seili, owned by the Finnish Maritime Administration, in 1990.

When product tankers Uikku and Lunni were converted to Azipod propulsion in 1993 and 1994, respectively, the result was similar increase in manoeuvrability and icebreaking capability.
