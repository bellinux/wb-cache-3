25|$|These Sutras suggest, states Paul Williams, that 'all sentient beings {{contain a}} Tathagata' as their 'essence, core or {{essential}} inner nature'.

25|$|According to Heng-Ching Shih, the tathāgatagarbha/Buddha-nature {{does not}} {{represent}} a substantial self (ātman).

While the classical tenets-system, as propagated by the Gelugpa, is limited to four tenets (Vaibhāṣika, Sautrāntika, Yogācāra, and Madhyamaka), more complicated systems include also the shentong-view of the Jonang and the Kagyu, and also differentiates between the radical <b>emptiness</b> <b>of</b> the Gelugpa-school, and the experiential <b>emptiness</b> <b>of</b> the Nyingma and the Shakya.|$|R

25|$|Another seminal text, {{which was}} and is {{influential}} in Tibetan Buddhism, is the Ratnagotravibhāga sutra.
