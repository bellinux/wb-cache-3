5|$|Dynamism of a Dog <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Leash</b> (Italian: Dinamismo di un cane al guinzaglio), {{sometimes}} called Dog <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Leash</b> or Leash in Motion, is a 1912 painting by Italian Futurist painter Giacomo Balla. It {{was influenced by}} the artist's fascination with chronophotograpic studies of animals in motion. It is considered one of his best-known works, {{and one of the most}} important works in Futurism, though it received mixed critical reviews. The painting has been in the collection of the Albright–Knox Art Gallery since 1984.|$|E
5|$|The {{decomposition}} of movement into moments in time which Balla created in Dynamism of a Dog <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Leash</b> likely inspired the photodynamic technique of Futurist photographer Anton Giulio Bragaglia.|$|E

5|$|A 2002 {{research}} paper on machine vision by computer scientists Roman Goldenberg, Ron Kimmel, Ehud Rivlin, and Michael Rudzsky used Futurism's techniques of motion, as embodied by Dynamism of a Dog <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Leash,</b> {{to illustrate the}} mathematical representation of periodic motion using {{a small number of}} eigenshapes.|$|E
5|$|Dog racing was {{originally}} {{an extension of}} hare coursing. Whippets began to be bred to race in the mid-nineteenth century. The first form of the sport was a rudimentary form of coursing known as 'ragging', and dogs who participated {{were said to be}} 'trained to the rag'. Dogs were kept <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>leash</b> by a person known as a slip, who was frequently also the race judge. The slip would release the dogs from their collars at the same time, and they would race towards their owners, who were standing {{at the opposite end of}} the track waving towels.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens with}} a fast motion night view of several skyscrapers located in Houston. It {{transitions}} to quick looks of various houses and people. Scenes filmed at the SLAB parade, an annual celebration of car culture in Houston were also featured in the clip set in slow motion. Houston residents posing for the camera are featured throughout the video as well as scenes of children playing football. During several scenes, Beyoncé is seen lip-syncing the song wearing a white-hooded fur mink coat and a matching one piece {{in front of a}} tumbledown house holding a pit bull <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>leash.</b> This scene was filmed in the suburb of Brunswick, during her Melbourne, Australia part of The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour and is the only scene from the music video, to be filmed outside of Houston. During another scene, she is seen wearing a jersey of the Houston Rockets with number 13, by James Harden. Beyoncé also appears at a gas station filling the fuel tank of a car and later goes to the streets in it.|$|E
50|$|Balá had {{a weekly}} {{television}} show, cementing his status {{at the top}} of children's entertainment, on par with Piluso and Pepitito. The show featured Angueto, an invisible dog, which Balá would pull around <b>on</b> <b>a</b> taut <b>leash.</b>|$|R

25|$|This breed is gentle, and is tireless when {{following}} a scent. Because of its strong tracking instinct, {{it can be}} willful and somewhat difficult to obedience train and handle <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>leash.</b> Bloodhounds have an affectionate and even-tempered nature with humans, making excellent family pets. However, like any pet, they require supervision when around small children.|$|E
25|$|In Medieval {{hunting the}} typical {{use of the}} Bloodhound was as a ‘limer’, or ‘lyam-hound’, that is a dog handled <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>leash</b> or ‘lyam’, to find the hart or boar before it was hunted by the pack hounds (raches). It was prized {{for its ability to}} hunt the cold scent of an {{individual}} animal, and, though it did not usually take part in the kill, it was given a special reward from the carcass.|$|E
50|$|The {{trail is}} open during {{daylight}} hours only; pets are allowed {{but must be}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> 6-foot <b>leash</b> at all times.

25|$|In November 1945 Fala {{was hospitalized}} {{for a week}} after being {{attacked}} at the family's Hyde Park estate by Elliott Roosevelt's 135-pound bull mastiff, Blaze. Fala had been staying with Margaret Suckley and visited Hyde Park. He was <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>leash</b> when the larger dog jumped on him, slashing his back and right eye. The attack ended when someone struck Blaze with a rock and dazed him. Blaze tested negative for rabies, but was still euthanized as a precaution against future attacks.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} common breeds used in Russia is the German Shepherd. This is mainly because these dogs are adapted to the climate of the country. Attack dogs have been used for a long time, off and on for foot patrolling. These dogs are kept <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>leash</b> at all times and are {{required}} to wear a muzzle unless the dog is needed to pursue and detain a suspect. These dogs must remain calm, docile, and unfazed by crowds or noise. Russian Police Dogs may react to any and all stimuli only if they are ordered to do so by their handler. They are a common sight in the public and are often unnerving to the public. German shepherds are also used for tasks such as seeking dangerous fugitives, tracking, and were ultimately chosen as the all-purpose police and army breed. This has remained common in most Soviet Union Successor States.|$|E
25|$|Dachs is German for badger, a {{term used}} for hunting dogs with short legs. The name Dachsbracke may reflect that the Dachsbracke dogs were bred down in size by {{crossbreeding}} long-legged Bracken with the Dachshund. Historically, the term Bracke {{was used in}} German to mean the scenthounds. Brack is an old Low German word for a coastal marsh periodically inundated by storm surges with salt water (related to the English word brackish). In Europe, scenthounds are usually separated into running hounds (free running packs, which either drive the game back to the hunter, or the hunter follows as they run, or the hunter waits until the dogs' cries communicate that game has been found and held, and then goes to that spot) or leash hounds (which follow the game or track wounded or dead game while being held <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>leash</b> by the hunter.) The Bracke are usually used as running hounds, in packs, to hunt rabbits or foxes in a type of hunt called Brackade. The Dachsbracke are used for hunting today mainly in Scandinavia and in alpine regions.|$|E

6000|$|There {{was much}} noise and contest among the competitors, and Charles, {{internally}} regretting the rash promise which had placed {{the hand and}} wealth of his fair vassal <b>on</b> such <b>a</b> hazard, was in hopes he might find means of evading all these conflicting claims, when Crawford pressed forward into the circle, dragging Le Balafre after him, who, awkward and bashful, followed like an unwilling mastiff towed <b>on</b> in <b>a</b> <b>leash,</b> as his leader exclaimed, [...] "Away with your hoofs and hides and painted iron!--No one, save he who slew the Boar, can show the tusks!" ...|$|R

500|$|In 2014, {{art critic}} Robert C. Morgan {{declared}} Dynamism of a Dog <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Leash,</b> along with Gino Severini's paintings Blue Dancer and Dynamic Hieroglyphic of the Bal Tabarin, to be [...] "probably {{the most elegant}} and accurate works ever painted in the Futurist tradition." [...] He credits these works with [...] "moving status into kinesis, stillness into motion, and thus giving life to culture, bringing it back from the bucolic ornaments of the 19th century." ...|$|E
500|$|Based on Jack Warner's 2003 debut novel Shikar, Maneater {{was filmed}} in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. [...] The film uses no CGI special effects at all, with the [...] "killer tiger" [...] portrayed by actual trained tigers. In scenes where the tiger is chasing various characters, the tiger is {{actually}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>leash</b> with his trainer behind him. The leash and trainer were edited {{out of the}} scenes during post-production. While Gary Busey said the tigers were a [...] "joy" [...] to work with, Clark joked that he was hoping they would not think he was lunch, noting {{that it was his}} first time working with tigers.|$|E
50|$|The area's dry and nutrient-poor {{sandy soil}} {{provides}} a habitat for numerous endangered {{plants such as}} the sea thrift, childing pink and wild thyme. The dominant species is sheep fescue. Other rare plants include filago and the hairgrass Corynephorus canescens. The grassland provides nesting for various birds, among them the woodlark, the skylark and the titlark. Leaving the paths is prohibited during the nesting season from April to July, dogs must be kept <b>on</b> <b>a</b> short <b>leash.</b> <b>A</b> herd of Heidschnucken sheep keeps the grass short.|$|R

Phoning Stan at home, Ollie suggests a ruse by which Stan is to convince his wife, who keeps him <b>on</b> <b>a</b> short <b>leash,</b> {{that he has been}} called away on business. Stan readily agrees to the idea, assuring Ollie that his wife is [...] "so dumb she'll never know the difference".|$|R

500|$|Perry and {{the other}} brides chase after him. When Alexander pulls out his phone, Perry is on the screen singing to him. He flees the {{warehouse}} and finds Perry outside wearing urban clothing, surrounded by dancers dressed similarly. When he turns around, he discovers {{that he has been}} cornered by Perry and the group of angry brides. He stumbles and the dancers surround him as he lies on the ground, before Perry approaches him leading a zebra <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>leash.</b> Alexander blinks and finds himself back at the altar in the church, revealing that the previous events were just his fantasy. The priest asks him again if he accepts his vows, and this time he says [...] "I do". The crowd in the church breaks out into cheers and sighs of relief as Perry runs victoriously down the aisle with him.|$|E
500|$|In 1943, artist Cornelia Geer LeBoutiller {{criticized the}} painting, {{comparing}} it unfavorably with Duchamp's Nude Descending a Staircase (a work {{with which it}} is often compared) and Picasso's Portrait of Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, calling Balla's work [...] "more crude, less mature, almost childish indeed ... Balla takes himself and his dog so seriously, so studiedly, that {{it is doubtful that}} any pleasure has ever come out of it anywhere; certainly no movement has." [...] Writing in 1947, critic Henry R. Hope called Dynamism of a Dog <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Leash</b> [...] "a cliché of modern art". Writer Geoffrey Wagner declared Balla's painting to be anathema to the Vorticist aesthetic of British painter Wyndham Lewis, who criticized Futurism for its [...] "romantic excess" [...] and dynamism. However, S. I. Hayakawa credited Balla's [...] "classic" [...] for its introduction of the time dimension in its representation of its subject.|$|E
500|$|Camping is {{available}} at a dozen campgrounds with more than 2,000 campsites. Camping is also available in surrounding National Forests, {{as well as in}} Grand Teton National Park to the south. Backcountry campsites are accessible only by foot or by horseback and require a permit. There are [...] of hiking trails available. The park is not considered to be a good destination for mountaineering because of the instability of volcanic rock which predominates. Visitors with pets are required to keep them <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>leash</b> at all times and are limited to areas near roadways and in [...] "frontcountry" [...] zones such as drive in campgrounds. Around thermal features, wooden and paved trails have been constructed to ensure visitor safety, and most of these areas are handicapped accessible. The National Park Service maintains a year-round clinic at Mammoth Hot Springs and provides emergency services throughout the year.|$|E
50|$|A mid {{sixth century}} BC Laconian cup, by the Hunt Painter, adds several new {{features}} {{to the scene}} which also become common in later works: three heads, a snake tail, Cerberus' chain and Heracles' club. Here Cerberus has three canine heads, is covered by a shaggy coat of snakes, and has a tail which ends in a snake head. He is being held <b>on</b> <b>a</b> chain <b>leash</b> by Heracles who holds his club raised over head.|$|R
