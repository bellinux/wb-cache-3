40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} the relative contribution of left ventricular (LV) geometric remodeling and of morphological and functional myocardial changes in rats with induced supravalvar aortic stenosis (SAS), {{in the transition}} from compensated hypertrophy to congestive heart failure (CHF). Methods: Twenty <b>one</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> induction of SAS, the rats were classified as controls (CG, n= 13), without congestive heart failure (SG, n= 11), or with congestive heart failure (SG-HF, n= 12). All groups were evaluated with echocardiographic, hemodynamic and morphological study of the myocardium. Results: Twenty <b>one</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> SAS: mass index (SG-HF>SG>CG, pCG, pSG>CG, pSG>CG, pSG>CG, pSG>CG, p< 0. 05). In the SG-HF group, LV geometric remodeling was characterized by {{a significant increase in}} dimensions and relative thickness of the normal wall (excentric remodeling), whereas the SG group presented a concentric remodeling. Indexes of LV performance in the SG-HF group were significantly lower than those of the SG group. Conclusions: The SG-HF and SG groups differed primarily in the LV geometric remodeling and structural myocardial remodeling process, which established a chronically compensated state in the SG group and triggered CHF in the SG-H...|$|R

Several {{species of the}} fungus Trichoderma, {{including}} Trichoderma polysporum, T.harzianum and T.viride, are able to attack and penetrate and the outer tissue of A.gallica rhizomorphs and parasitize the internal hyphae.

Entoloma abortivum is another fungus that can live parasitically upon A.gallica. The whitish-gray malformed fruit bodies that may result are due to the E.abortivum hyphae penetrating the mushroom and disrupting its normal development.|$|E
