40|$|This article aims at {{studying}} a possible articulation between {{the theory of}} the central core of social representations and {{the theory of the}} <b>organizing</b> <b>principles.</b> The confrontation of the results of three research undertaken in connection with the social representation of the studies (two already published and one original) in three distinct populations indicates deep differences in terms of core between these populations but an important transversality of the <b>organizing</b> <b>principles</b> of the standpoints. The assumption thus is put forth that the <b>organizing</b> <b>principles</b> constitute the common base of diversified standpoints according to the social position of the groups and that, among these standpoints, some are the object of strong consensus inside the groups and thus constitute the central system of their representation. This assumption implies that common <b>organizing</b> <b>principles</b> could report different representations in terms of central system...|$|R

His notion of abelian category is now the basic object of study in homological algebra. The emergence of a separate mathematical discipline of category theory has been attributed to Grothendieck's influence, though unintentional.|$|E

Many of Asimov's robot-focused stories involve robots behaving in unusual and counter-intuitive ways as an unintended consequence of how the robot applies the Three Laws to the situation in which it finds itself. Other authors working in Asimov's fictional universe have adopted them and references, often parodic, appear throughout science fiction as well as in other genres.|$|E

40|$|We have {{recently}} devised <b>organizing</b> <b>principles</b> to obtain maximally dense packings of the Platonic and Archimedean solids, and certain smoothly-shaped convex nonspherical particles [Torquato and Jiao, Phys. Rev. E 81, 041310 (2010) ]. Here we generalize {{them in order}} to guide one to ascertain the densest packings of other convex nonspherical particles as well as concave shapes. Our generalized <b>organizing</b> <b>principles</b> are explicitly stated as four distinct propositions. We apply and test all of these <b>organizing</b> <b>principles</b> to the most comprehensive set of both convex and concave particle shapes to date, including Catalan solids, prisms, antiprisms, cylinders, dimers of spheres and various concave polyhedra. We demonstrate that all of the densest known packings associated with this wide spectrum of nonspherical particles are consistent with our propositions. Among other applications, our general <b>organizing</b> <b>principles</b> enable us to construct analytically the densest known packings of certain convex nonspherical particles, including spherocylinders, "lens-shaped" particles, square pyramids and rhombic pyramids. Moreover, we show how to apply these principles to infer the high-density equilibrium crystalline phases of hard convex and concave particles. We also discuss the unique packing attributes of maximally random jammed packings of nonspherical particles. Comment: 37 pages, 14 figure...|$|R

500|$|In mathematics, a {{group is}} an {{algebraic}} structure {{consisting of a}} set of elements equipped with an operation that combines any two elements to form a third element and that satisfies four conditions called the group axioms, namely closure, associativity, identity and invertibility. One of the most familiar examples of a group is the set of integers together with the addition operation, but the abstract formalization of the group axioms, detached as it is from the concrete nature of any particular group and its operation, applies much more widely. [...] It allows entities with highly diverse mathematical origins in abstract algebra and beyond to be handled in a flexible way while retaining their essential structural aspects. The ubiquity of groups in numerous areas within and outside mathematics makes them a central <b>organizing</b> <b>principle</b> of contemporary mathematics.|$|E

No Batman villain sees this as clearly as Anarky..." [...] However, Anarky's behavior was also interpreted as an attempt to impose an even more restrictive order, with examples presented from Batman: Anarky, in which Lonnie Machin lectures fellow juvenile detainees in [...] "Tomorrow Belongs to Us", explains his motivations in a self-righteous farewell letter to his parents in [...] "Anarky", and creates a fantasy dystopia in a distorted reflection of his desired society in [...] "Metamorphosis": [...] "His [...] search for an <b>organizing</b> <b>principle</b> that is less repressive than the state fails." [...] This is sharply compared with Batman, described as moderating his impulses towards social control. Dialogue from Detective Comics is employed, in which Batman compares himself to Anarky and denies the latter legitimacy: [...] "The fact is, no man can be allowed to set himself up as judge, jury and executioner." ...|$|E
