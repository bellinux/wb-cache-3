40|$|Forty nine embryos, twenty unfertilized {{eggs and}} five <b>other</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>eggs</b> of 'doubtful' status have been {{recovered}} from 58 pony mares in 122 flushes up to 22 days after ovulation. The fresh egg or embryo recovery rate was 78 % with surgical methods (or at slaughter) and 40 - 60 % with non-surgical methods of recovery. The fertilization rate was about 70 %. It has been confirmed that horse embryos normally enter the uterus as blastocysts 5 - 6 days after ovulation. Three features of early embryo morphology have become clearer upon comparison with unfertilized eggs of similar ages; early embryos are often ellipsoidal in shape; dispersal of most of a thick gel coat seems to be hastened by fertilization; gradual disappearance of refractile granules from the perivitelline space is similar in fertilized and unfertilized eggs. A tense, transparent, acellular capsule (considered {{to be different from}} the zona pellucida) is acquired by the spherical blastocysts within the uterus and persists at least until a diameter of 34 mm is attained (at 21 days in the present series). The capsule seems to be analogous, in part, with the 'neozona' described in rabbit blastocyst before attachment, and trophoblastic cells appear to be involved in its formation. Cleavage stages of oviductal embryos and diameters of uterine blastocysts from this series have been described and illustrated and used to extend previous knowledge of early growth patterns in horse embryos...|$|E

50|$|Albumen is {{a mixture}} of {{proteins}} found in egg whites, and is utilized for its capacity to create foams. In a commercialized setting, dried albumen is used as opposed to <b>fresh</b> <b>egg</b> whites. In addition to convenience, the advantages of using dried albumen are an increase in food safety, and the reduction of water content in the marshmallow. <b>Fresh</b> <b>egg</b> whites carry a higher risk of Salmonella, and are approximately 90 percent water. This is undesirable for the shelf life and firmness of the product. For artisan-type marshmallows, prepared by a candy maker, <b>fresh</b> <b>egg</b> whites are usually used.

40|$|The {{availability}} of thermo-physical data of foods and their constituents is of general importance to food industry. The thermal effusivity e is one among the relevant thermodynamical quantities. The latter is normally {{calculated from the}} relationship e = (¿¿c) ½, where c is specific heat, ¿ is the density, and ¿ is the thermal conductivity. The necessity for performing the time consuming independent measurements of these three quantities is the major reason that the existing database with effusivity of foods is not very wide. This paper describes {{the application of the}} inverse photopyroelectric (IPPE) technique that allows the determination of effusivity from a single measurement. This approach was used to directly measure thermal effusivity of <b>fresh</b> <b>egg</b> yolk, egg white, and white/yolk blends. In addition, thermal effusivity of rehydrated egg powders (white, yolk, and the whole egg powder) has been measured and compared to that of the <b>fresh</b> hen <b>egg.</b> In case of the egg white, effusivity of rehydrated egg powders was practically {{the same as that of}} the <b>fresh</b> <b>egg.</b> However, the difference in effusivity between <b>fresh</b> <b>egg</b> yolk and rehydrated egg yolk, and between the blend of <b>fresh</b> <b>egg</b> and the rehydrated whole egg power was significant.

50|$|Dehydrated {{and frozen}} egg whites are cheaper and more {{efficient}} than <b>fresh</b> <b>egg</b> whites. However, each lot of dehydrated egg whites varies from the next. This results in each batch of cakes varying in texture, moisture, volume, and height. Surfactants {{that have been used}} to improve the whipping properties of dehydrated eggs are sodium desoxycholate, triethyl citrate, triacetin, sodium oleate and oleic acid. Frozen egg whites do not form as firm or stable foams as <b>fresh</b> <b>egg</b> whites. It may be necessary to adjust the pH if the eggs have been refrigerated for a long time because they become more alkaline than <b>fresh</b> <b>eggs.</b> Acids can be added in manufacturing such as acetic, malic, tartaric, and citric.

There {{were no differences}} between the very low density lipoproteins isolated from the fresh and those from the stored eggs {{in the percentage of}} lipid extracted by ether after the action of unfolding agents, detergents, reducing agents, trypsin, Pronase, or phospholipase D. Phospholipase C released less lipid from the very low density lipoproteins of the stored eggs than from those of the fresh unless they were extracted with ether before digestion, when equal amounts were extracted. Very low density lipoproteins isolated from <b>fresh</b> <b>eggs</b> and those isolated from stored eggs contained similar percentages of lipid. The very low density lipoproteins from the stored eggs had lower isoelectric points than those from <b>fresh</b> <b>eggs,</b> but there were no differences in average size when determined by electron microscopy.
