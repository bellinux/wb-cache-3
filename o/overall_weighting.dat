40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} closed-form {{weighted}} least-squares solution for designing variable two-dimensional (2 -D) finite-impulse response (FIR) digital filters with continuously variable 2 -D fractional delay responses. First, the coefficients of the variable 2 -D transfer function {{are represented by}} using the polynomials {{of a pair of}} fractional delays (1 2). Then the weighted squared-error function of the variable 2 -D frequency response is derived without sampling the two frequencies (1 2) and two fractional delays (1 2), which leads to a significant reduction in computational complexity. With the assumption that the <b>overall</b> <b>weighting</b> function is separable and stepwise, the design problem is reduced to the minimization of the weighted squared-error function. Based on the error function, the closed-form optimal solutions for the coefficient matrices of the variable 2 -D transfer function can be determined through solving a pair of matrix equations. In addition, Cholesky decomposition is applied to the final closed-form expressions in order to avoid some numerical instability problem. An example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed design method. Index Terms—Two-dimensional digital filters, variable digital filters, variable fractional delay filters, weighted least-squares design. I...|$|E

40|$|Fisheries {{management}} is typically characterized by multiple and often con¯icting objectives. The Western Paci®c Regional Fishery Management Council (WPRFMC) is the authority for managing {{exclusive economic zone}} (EEZ) ®sheries in Hawaii. The array of multiple objectives coupled with the heterogeneous composition of WPRFMC creates a complex decisionmaking environment for ®shery management in Hawaii. In this paper, we applied the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to evaluate four alternatives for limiting entry of longliners into the Hawaii pelagic ®shery. We ®rst elicited the factors deemed to be important for a sustainable pelagic ®shery using a questionnaire survey, followed by another questionnaire to elicit judgments {{from all of the}} individuals involved in the decision-making process of WPRFMC. While there is considerable variation among individuals, the <b>overall</b> <b>weighting</b> of objectives and ranking of alternatives is robust in the sense of being consistent across all four bodies of the WPRFMC. There was no statistical difference in mean results among the WPRFMC bodies at the 5 % level. This experience demonstrated an application of the AHP process in ®shery management. The results of the present evaluation of the alternatives for limiting entry of longliners are comparable to earlier decisions. As compared to conventional decision making, this process has the advantages of timeliness, quanti®cation, and documentation. It may also provide policy analysts with insights into potential con¯icts and tradeoffs before the decision-making process unfolds. # 199...|$|E
40|$|AbstractEmergency Medical Services (EMS) {{is a basic}} medical acts {{carried to}} an {{accident}} victim {{with the purpose of}} sustaining life and preventing a decline in body condition before the victim finally getting further treatment from medical personnel. One evacuation tool of first aid commonly used is Long Spinal Board (LSB). This tool is set up as an emergency stretcher boards made from wood or polymer with a flat surface that is used to perform the evacuation of the injured spinal cord. The basic principle of the LSB use is to immobilize the position of the spine so that the secondary injury on the spine due to swing, clash, or shocks that occurred during the evacuation process can be minimized. However, the existing LSB has several disadvantages, both in terms of user comfort, and also the effectiveness and efficiency of the evacuation process when done. A recent study found the LSB use can cause pain, discomfort, and respiratory disorders to the patients. Furthermore, the LSB can blockage the flow of oxygen in the tissue capillaries at the placement of strap. Therefore, it is important to improve the design of the LSB with the aims to achieve mobility and better equipment compatibility when used, so that the evacuation process can be done more effectively, efficiently and safely. This study identifies the design requirements of ergonomic LSB using Quality Function Deployment (QFD). QFD is an effective design method to integrate ergonomics needs and comfort into LSB design because it explicitly addresses the translation of customer requirements into engineering characteristics. Preliminary survey was conducted through direct observation of the actual use of LSB that exists today and interviews with volunteers from the Indonesian Red Cross of West Sumatera. Data gathered was translated into questionnaire and answered by 47 participants from medics, Red Cross, Ambulance Unit Medical Officer and rescue team of Padang, West Sumatera. Then it was clarified and used in the House of Quality matrix. The QFD analysis of the LSB revealed that the selection of LSB main board materials, the application of LSB strap systems, as well as the addition of LSB features were receiving the highest <b>overall</b> <b>weighting,</b> which means that improving the design of those criteria would lead to higher customer satisfaction...|$|E
40|$|Waste {{resulting}} from healthcare activities is hazardous {{due to its}} potential risk of infection to healthcare workers, waste workers and the public. Many tools and approaches have been applied in waste management in developed countries, but are not suitable for application in developing countries due to their complexity and extensive data and resource requirements. WasteOpt was therefore developed and applied as an appropriate decision-making tool in the developing country context. WasteOpt comprises of the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), costing and Life cycle management (LCM). The {{purpose of this study}} was to identify environmentally sound technologies (ESTs) that minimise the risk of infection by healthcare waste (HCW) in rural clinics. Rural clinics were selected because apart from financial constraints, they are challenged by the lack of procedure, infrastructure and technologies to develop reasonable waste management plans that can be implemented within a practicable time frame. WasteOpt was applied to aid in identifying ESTs in relation to the infection risks and costs of the technologies. Experts in waste management in Lesotho were involved in a workshop for the ranking of technologies. The <b>overall</b> <b>weighting</b> values of the rankings were converted to risk factors for individual options and for alternatives (combination of options). Risk factors were classified as low, medium and high risk. The technologies within a single class were differentiated by analysing the cost of acquiring and running the technology to qualify as ESTs. The ESTs identified for Lesotho are Engineered containers, Refrigerated engineered facility, engineered wheeled transport, detailed procedures, multi chamber incinerator, engineered pit and landfill. Ten (10) clinics in Lesotho were also assessed as case studies using the WHO RAT. The RAT was first modified to include questions on financial management at the clinics. The calculated risk factors were applied to the case studies to assess the risk under which healthcare workers operate in those clinics. The additive minimum risk for the overall life cycle of waste was 4. 0 (excluding central treatment and disposal). The clinic workers were found to be at a risk of between 1. 1 x 10 - 4 and 7. 8 x 10 - 5, which proves that rural clinics in Lesotho are still using inappropriate technologies. In terms of financing for waste management, public clinics were found to have little decision-making powers over funds and had less accountability measures. CHAL clinics which are managed by churches in Lesotho had more control of funds and exhibit more accountability. All clinics had no targets for saving funds from waste management activities. WasteOpt can be applied as a decision-making tool for HCW in Lesotho since it overcomes the barriers that inhibit environmentally sound management of HCW in developing countries. In conclusion: WasteOpt can be applied as a decision-making tool for different types of waste by replacing HCW options with respective ones and designing a relevant questionnaire for qualitative data capture. WasteOpt can then be applied in a developing country to aid sustainable waste management decision-making. Informed decision-making helps resource poor managers to select cost-effective but low-risk options, which will be sustainable in the future.
