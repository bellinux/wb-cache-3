50|$|Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint, and Word allow {{users to}} {{immediately}} insert a screenshot of open app windows or {{a selection of}} content on the screen into documents without saving the image as a file. The functionality is exposed through a new Screenshot command <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Insert</b> <b>tab</b> of the ribbon that, when clicked, presents individual options to capture either app windows or selections of content. The former option presents open windows as thumbnails in a gallery on the ribbon that insert a screenshot of the selected window into the active app, while the latter option minimizes the currently active app, dims the screen, and presents a selection rectangle for users to create a screenshot by holding the main mouse button, dragging the selection rectangle to a desired area of the screen, and then releasing the button to automatically insert the selection as an image into the document. Only windows {{that have not been}} minimized to the taskbar can be captured. After a screenshot has been inserted, various adjustments can be made.|$|E

To resize the text box, click one of the circles on the border of the text box and drag it to the desired size. To move the text box, click and drag the border of the text box. Once the WordArt is selected, the Drawing Tools→Format tab will appear. Using this tab, you can make additional changes to your WordArt. The Shape Styles will change the format of the box around the WordArt. The WordArt Styles will change the text. Text Wrapping When an object is inserted into a document, it can be either inline—graphics or other objects that are positioned directly in the text of a document at the insertion point—or floating—an object that is inserted in the drawing layer so that you can position it precisely on the page, in front of or behind text or other objects, or align the picture and text.

5000|$|Pivot {{tables are}} not created automatically. For example, in Microsoft Excel one must first select the entire {{data in the}} {{original}} table {{and then go to}} <b>the</b> <b>Insert</b> <b>tab</b> and select [...] "Pivot Table" [...] (or [...] "Pivot Chart"). The user then has the option of either <b>inserting</b> <b>the</b> pivot table into an existing sheet or creating a new sheet to house the pivot table. A pivot table field list is provided to the user which lists all the column headers present in the data. For instance, if a table represents sales data of a company, it might include Date of sale, Sales person, Item sold, Color of item, Units sold, Per unit price, and Total price. This makes the data more readily accessible.|$|R

When an instance of a SmartArt is inserted, a Text Pane appears next to it to guide the user through entering text in the hierarchical levels. Each SmartArt graphic, based on its design, maps the text outline, automatically resized for best fit, onto the graphic. There are a number of [...] "quick styles" [...] for each graphic that apply largely different 3D effects to the graphic, and the graphic's shapes and text can be formatted through shape styles and WordArt styles. In addition, SmartArt graphics change their colors, fonts, and effects to match the document's theme.|$|R

5000|$|Microsoft Graph (originally {{known as}} Microsoft Chart) is an OLE {{application}} deployed by Microsoft Office {{programs such as}} Excel and Access to create charts and graphs. The program is available as an OLE application object in Visual Basic. Microsoft Graph supports {{many different types of}} charts, but its output is dated. Office 2003 was the last version to use Microsoft Graph for hosting charts inside Office applications as OLE objects. Office 2007, specifically, Excel 2007 includes a new integrated charting engine and the charts are native to the applications. The new engine supports advanced formatting, including 3D rendering, transparencies, and shadows. Chart layouts can also be customized to highlight various trends in the data. Microsoft Graph still exists for compatibility reasons, but the entry points are removed. This product can be used within other products, and is available in the Object menu in <b>the</b> <b>Insert</b> <b>tab</b> in Office Programs. Sold separately in Mac releases.|$|R

EN 24 substrate was coated with hexavalent chrome to a thickness of 170 μm. The surface hardness before and after hard turning of hard chrome plated surfaces were studied. <b>The</b> temperature developed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>insert,</b> workpiece and chips were studied in the present investigation. An experiment was carried out to determine the maximum heat development <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>insert.</b> <b>The</b> experimental results revealed that the maximum heat was observed at 2 mm from <b>the</b> cutting edge <b>on</b> <b>the</b> top diagonal. The images obtained from the confocal microscope and scanning electron microscope discovered the nature of fracture of the chips from the work surfaces...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAir–liquid {{interface}} {{cell culture}} is an organotypic model for study of differentiated functional airway epithelium in vitro. Dysregulation of cellular energy metabolism and mitochondrial function {{have been suggested}} to contribute to airway diseases. However, there is currently no established method to determine oxygen consumption and glycolysis in airway epithelium in air–liquid interface. In order to study metabolism in differentiated airway epithelial cells, we engineered an <b>insert</b> for <b>the</b> Seahorse XF 24 Analyzer that enabled the measure of respiration by oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and glycolysis by extracellular acidification rate (ECAR). Oxidative metabolism and glycolysis in airway epithelial cells cultured <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>inserts</b> were successfully measured. <b>The</b> <b>inserts</b> {{did not affect the}} measures of OCR or ECAR. Cells under media with apical and basolateral feeding had less oxidative metabolism as compared to cells <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>inserts</b> at air-interface with basolateral feeding. <b>The</b> design of <b>inserts</b> {{that can be used in}} the measure of bioenergetics in small numbers of cells in an organotypic state may be useful for evaluation of new drugs and metabolic mechanisms that underlie airway diseases...|$|R
