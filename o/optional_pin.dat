50|$|Arx Fatalis has a {{somewhat}} open-ended gameplay style, allowing the player to allocate skill {{points for the}} character type such as spellcasting, weapons and armor, , and so on. There are several side quests that can be undertaken. Simple crafting involves enchanting ammunition and weapons, or creating items, such as a fishing rod (fishing pole and rope), keyrings (key and ring), or pies (dough and rolling <b>pin,</b> <b>optional</b> apple and optional bottle of wine). Raw food can be cooked, like rounds of bread, chicken drumsticks, or pies. The main plotline is non-linear with the player collecting the various items to forge a sword required to defeat Akbaa in a final showdown. Additional goals come up such as dealing with the rebels of Arx, the snake women and The King of Arx. The player can resolve the conflict between them all and experience several different endings to the conflict with different consequences somewhat affecting the story.|$|R
