5000|$|The {{black-headed oriole}} (<b>Oriolus</b> <b>larvatus)</b> is {{a species of}} bird in the family Oriolidae. It is found in Africa and has a very {{striking}} appearance with a bright yellow body, contrasting black head and flesh-coloured beak.|$|E
50|$|The dark-throated oriole is {{sometimes}} considered {{to form a}} superspecies with the Philippine oriole and the Isabela oriole. Alternate names for the dark-throated oriole include the black-headed oriole, black-throated oriole and Malaysian oriole. The alternate name 'black-headed oriole' {{should not be confused}} with the species of the same name, <b>Oriolus</b> <b>larvatus.</b>|$|E

30|$|A {{total of}} 2484 birds {{belonging}} to 56 species were recorded at the 12 sampling sites. Black headed Oriole (<b>Oriolus</b> <b>larvatus),</b> Spur Winged Lapwing (Vanellus spinosus), Spectacled Weaver (Places ocularis) and Yellow Wagtail (Motacilla flava) {{where the most}} abundant bird species {{in the study area}} and accounts 35  % of the total species. Human disturbance and habitant conditions varied considerably between sites in the study area.|$|E

40|$|Some {{silvicultural}} {{practices in}} the Knysna Forest are aimed at the sustained-yield production of valuable timber tree species, albeit on limited areas only. This study investigates effects of forest plant species composition and physiognomy on bird and invertebrate communities in three discrete, relatively undisturbed forest types along a dry-wet soil moisture gradient. Using discriminant functions analysis, a 100 % floristic and a 78 % vegetation structural discrimination was obtained between the three forest types. However, the bird communities of these floristically and structurally different forest types were very similar in species composition and had much lower densities than normally encountered in other superficially similar forests. It was only possible to discriminate between the wet and the moist/dry forest types by using the two best bird discriminators. the blackheaded oriole (<b>Oriolus</b> <b>larvatus)</b> and the sombre bulbul (Andropadus importunus). A separation of the moist and dry forest types was not possible. Although an 81 % discrimination between forest types was attained through analysis of ground surface invertebrates. measures of litter and aerial invertebrate abundance were of limited use as discriminators. Historical and biogeographic factors and the low nutritional levels in the soil and vegetation may {{be the cause of}} low bird and invertebrate density and diversity. It is concluded therefore, that floristics and vegetation structure have, at best, a minor influence on bird community structure, and possibly also on the invertebrate community in the Knysna Forest and that management practices need not cater for variation in forest vegetation composition and physiognomy.
