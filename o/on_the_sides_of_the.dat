5|$|Dragonflies (suborder Anisoptera) are heavy-bodied, strong-flying {{insects that}} hold their wings {{horizontally}} both in flight and at rest. By contrast, damselflies (suborder Zygoptera) have slender bodies and fly more weakly; most species fold their wings over the abdomen when stationary, {{and the eyes}} are well separated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> head.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, {{scanning}} {{electron microscopy}} revealed fine grooves or striations on the teeth in lemuriform toothcombs. These grooves were only found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> teeth on the concave surfaces between the sides, as well on the back ridge of the teeth. Between 10 and 20µm wide, these grooves indicate that hair moved repeatedly across the teeth. Inside these grooves were even finer grooves, less than 1µm, created by abrasion with the cuticular layer of the hair.|$|E
5|$|Refurbishment and {{improvement}} works completed in 2007 included new and reconstructed cross bridges between platforms and {{the installation of}} lifts for mobility impaired passengers. Cosmetic improvements carried {{out at the same}} time included the reinstatement of pole-mounted roundels <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> entrance vestibule. Other work in the 2000s at the station includes the construction of a substantial air rights building spanning across the cutting.|$|E

These weapons were 5.1m (16ft9in) long and carried an 87.5kg (193lb) TNT warhead. They could be set at two speeds for {{different}} ranges. At , the torpedoes had a range of 800m (870yd). At an increased speed of , the range was reduced to 500m (550yb).|$|E
5|$|The {{upper body}} had a baggage {{compartment}} separating the driver's compartment from the crew compartment. Bench seats <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vehicle, with under-seat storage, could accommodate six men. The windshield could fold forward {{and was also}} removable. A convertible canvas top was mounted at {{the upper part of}} the rear body. It fastened to the windshield when erected. Four side pieces could be mounted to protect the crew from the weather.|$|E
5|$|After a {{company-wide}} {{contest to}} name the aircraft, the initial prototype received the name Pirate and made its first flight on 2 October 1946. Flight testing revealed severe aerodynamic problems, mostly caused by the airfoil section and thickness of the wing. The vertical stabilizer also had to be redesigned to smooth out the airflow {{at the intersection of}} the horizontal and vertical stabilizers. Other changes included the addition of dive brakes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fuselage and the replacement of the Metalite panels near the engine's exhaust with stainless steel ones.|$|E

5|$|All {{described}} {{specimens of}} Sinosauropteryx preserve integumentary structures (filaments {{arising from the}} skin) which most palaeontologists interpret as very primitive type of feathers. These short, down-like filaments are preserved along the back half of the skull, the arms, neck, back, and {{top and bottom of}} the tail. Additional patches of feathers have been identified <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body, and palaeontologists Chen, Dong and Zheng proposed that the density of the feathers on the back and the randomness of the patches elsewhere on the body indicated the animals would have been fully feathered in life, with the ventral feathers having been removed by decomposition.|$|E
5|$|Defence against torpedo boats was {{provided}} by eight QF 6-pounder guns, although the exact type of gun is not known. Four of these were mounted on the main deck in casemates <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hull and suffered from the same problems as the six-inch guns. Hood also mounted a dozen QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns mounted in the superstructure and fighting tops. Like her sisters, the ship was fitted with seven 18-inch Torpedo tubes. Two of these were mounted in the bow below the waterline, four {{were placed in the}} sides of the hull, two on each broadside, and one in the stern. These last five tubes were all above water. She also was fitted with a plough-shaped underwater ram.|$|E
5|$|In non-breeding plumage, the {{nominate}} has greyish-black upper parts, cap, nape, and hindneck, {{with the}} colour {{on the upper}} portion of the latter being contained in a vertical stripe. The dark colour of the cap reaches below the eye and can be seen, diffused, to the ear-coverts. Behind the ear-coverts <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> neck, there are white ovals. The rest of the neck is grey to brownish-grey in colour and has white that varies in amount. The breast is white, and the abdomen is whitish. The flanks are coloured in a mix of blackish-grey with white flecks. The colour of the bill when not breeding {{differs from that of}} the breeding plumage, with the former being significantly more grey.|$|E

5|$|Living chelicerates {{have both}} {{compound}} eyes (only in horseshoe crabs, as the compound {{eye in the}} other clades {{has been reduced to}} a cluster of no more than five pairs of ocelli), mounted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> head, plus pigment-cup ocelli ("little eyes"), mounted in the middle. These median ocelli-type eyes in chelicerates are assumed to be homologous with the crustacean nauplius eyes and the insect ocelli. The eyes of horseshoe crabs can detect movement but not form images. At the other extreme, jumping spiders have a very wide field of vision, and their main eyes are ten times as acute as those of dragonflies and is able to see in both colors and UV-light.|$|E
5|$|The body of {{the soft}} tick, family Argasidae, is pear-shaped or oval with a rounded {{anterior}} portion. The mouthparts cannot be seen from above as {{they are on the}} ventral surface. The cuticle is leathery; there is often a centrally positioned dorsal plate, with ridges which project slightly above the surrounding surface, but there is no decoration. A pattern of small, circular depressed areas show where muscles are attached to the interior of the integument. The eyes are <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body, the spiracles open between legs 3 and 4, and males and females only differ {{in the structure of the}} genital pore.|$|E
5|$|The {{bottom end}} {{of the body is}} an ampulla (a flask-like swelling), which anchors the animal in the tube and enables it to retract its body very quickly when threatened. When the lophophore is {{extended}} {{at the top of the}} body, cilia (little hairs) <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tentacles draw food particles to the mouth, which is inside and slightly to one side of the base of the lophophore. Unwanted material can be excluded by closing a lid above the mouth or be rejected by the tentacles, whose cilia can switch into reverse. The food then moves down to the stomach, which is in the ampulla. Solid wastes are moved up the intestine and out through the anus, which is outside and slightly below the lophophore.|$|E
30|$|In conclusion, three {{measurements}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> impacted canines {{were significantly}} lower than <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> without impaction; width from premolar to the mid-palatine raphe and lateral angulations of incisors (lateral and central) showed significant reduction, presenting disto-angulated incisors <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> impacted canine.|$|R
40|$|When Cambarus clarkii {{is exposed}} to a source of light so that both eyes are equally illuminated, leg {{movements}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two <b>sides</b> are equal in frequency and amplitude. On covering one eye and exposing the uncovered eye to light, leg movements <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> uncovered eye are more frequent and are of greater amplitude than <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> covered eye. <b>On</b> covering <b>the</b> exposed eye also <b>the</b> leg movements <b>on</b> <b>the</b> two <b>sides</b> again tend to become equal in frequency and amplitude.

5|$|The fourth upper premolar (P4) {{has four}} main, {{transversely}} placed crests; {{the description of}} S.bolligeri mentions an additional, centrally placed small crest. De Bruijn interpreted the four main crests as the anteroloph, protoloph, metaloph, and posteroloph {{from front to back}} and wrote that these crests are not connected <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tooth. Prieto and Böhme note that the posteroloph is convex on the back margin of the tooth. In Muscardinus, the number of ridges on P4 ranges from five in Muscardinus sansaniensis to two in M.pliocaenicus and the living hazel dormouse, but the protoloph and metaloph are always connected on the lingual (inner) side of the tooth. P4 is two-rooted in S.alpinus and three-rooted in S.bolligeri.|$|E
