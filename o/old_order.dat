5|$|Forster was {{not present}} in Mainz during the siege. As representatives of the Mainz National Convention, he and Adam Lux {{had been sent to}} Paris to apply for Mainz – which was unable to exist as an {{independent}} state – {{to become a part of}} the French Republic. The application was accepted, but had no effect, since Mainz was conquered by Prussian and Austrian troops, and the <b>old</b> <b>order</b> was restored. Forster lost his library and collections and decided to remain in Paris.|$|E
5|$|By 1957, the <b>old</b> <b>order</b> {{was mostly}} re-established as {{fourteen}} of the fifteen judges were endorsed for re-election {{by both parties}} and returned to office without opposition. The fifteenth, 75-year-old Joseph L. Kun, was President Judge of the Court of Common Pleas and had served on the court for thirty years. In February, lawyers from the city bar association voted by a 2-to-1 margin to not endorse his re-election, calling him unqualified to hold office. Despite the bipartisan effort against him among the city's lawyers, Kun filed for re-election in both parties' primaries. Kun won the Republican nomination handily, but lost the Democratic nomination to Earl Chudoff, {{a member of the}} federal House of Representatives from Pennsylvania's 4th congressional district. In November, Chudoff won easily, taking 58% of the vote. Kun, already in poor health, retired from the profession of law and died in 1961. Chudoff remained on the bench until 1974.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{leading up to}} 1789, the {{territory}} today known as Belgium was divided into two states, called the Austrian Netherlands and Prince-Bishopric of Liège, both of which were part of the Holy Roman Empire. In the aftermath of the French Revolution, both states experienced revolutions in 1789 in which the <b>old</b> <b>order</b> was overthrown and new states created. These revolutions were condemned by the Holy Roman Empire and were crushed by 1792. The territory was only briefly regained, however, as the area was captured by the French during the French Revolutionary Wars and incorporated into the French First Republic. This French period lasted roughly from 1794 to 1815. In the aftermath of Napoleon's final defeat in 1815, the Congress of Vienna added the territory of Belgium to the Netherlands, and until 1830, Belgium was part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands.|$|E

5|$|On January 3, 1894, Crispi {{declared}} a state of siege throughout Sicily. Army reservists were recalled and General Roberto Morra di Lavriano was dispatched with 40,000 troops. The <b>old</b> <b>order</b> was restored through the use of extreme force, including summary executions. The Fasci were outlawed, the army and the police killed scores of protesters, and wounded hundreds. Thousands of militants, including all the leaders, were put in jail or sent into internal exile. Some 1,000 persons were deported to the penal islands without trial. All working-class societies and cooperatives were dissolved and the freedom of the press, meeting and association were suspended. A solidarity revolt of anarchists and republicans in the Lunigiana was crushed as well. The government also seized the opportunity to 'revise' the electoral registers. In Catania 5,000 of the 9,000 electors were struck off.|$|E

25|$|Lancaster also hosts other Plain Anabaptist groups. As of 2000, {{there are}} about 3,000 <b>Old</b> <b>Order</b> Mennonites of the Groffdale Conference who drive black top buggies instead of the grey top buggies of the Amish in Lancaster county. Other buggy-using <b>Old</b> <b>Order</b> Mennonites in Lancaster County are subgroups of the Stauffer Mennonites with 283 baptized members and the Reidenbach Mennonites with 232. There are about 4,000 members of the car-driving Weaverland <b>Old</b> <b>Order</b> Mennonite Conference. A {{congregation}} of 83 members of the <b>Old</b> <b>Order</b> River Brethren lives there as well as 84 members of the Reformed Mennonite Church who have retained the most conservative form of Plain dress of all Plain groups. There are 74 members of the Old German Baptist Brethren in Lancaster County. The Amish comprise around 5.7% of the total population.|$|E
25|$|While {{speakers}} {{without an}} Anabaptist background in general do not pass the dialect {{to their children}} today, the <b>Old</b> <b>Order</b> Amish and horse-and-buggy <b>Old</b> <b>Order</b> Mennonites {{do so in the}} current generation and there are no signs that this practice will end in the future. There are only two car driving Anabaptist groups who have preserved the dialect: The Old Beachy Amish and the Kauffman Amish Mennonites, also called Sleeping Preacher Churches. Even though Amish and <b>Old</b> <b>Order</b> Mennonites were originally a minority group within the Pennsylvania German-speaking population, today they form the vast majority. According to sociologist John A. Hostetler, less than 10 percent of the original Pennsylvania German population was Amish or Mennonite.|$|E
