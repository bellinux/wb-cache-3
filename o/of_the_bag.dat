5|$|Specifically, {{the video}} {{opens with a}} boy with a {{basketball}} in his bag walking out of a car park. The basketball then begins to bounce out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bag,</b> jumps out of the city streets and gets into a Lada taxi. After that, it continues to bounce and causes troubles in an office. Its owner struggles to chase the ball but then manages to catch it for a second. Unfortunately, the ball escapes and is run over by a truck driven by The Chemical Brothers. The basketball re-inflates after the accident, jumps into and eventually gets trapped inside an old phone booth near Baross Street, swells to an enormous size, and explodes.|$|E

25|$|A {{holdback}} line is used {{to prevent}} the lift bag and load from floating away when used for short distance lifts at the bottom. The holdback {{is attached to the}} lifting ring <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bag,</b> or to the load, and should be attached by a strong cable to an anchor point it cannot lift. The SWL of the holdback should be at least equal to the lifting capacity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bag.</b> A holdback and inverter are often used together.|$|E

40|$|The U. S.

The device physically cleans either 22. 7 kg (50 lb) or 45. 4 kg (100 lb) paper bags by {{using a combination of}} brushes and air jets. It is completely self-contained and is kept under negative pressure by a baghouse to ensure that dust and product removed from <b>the</b> <b>bags</b> during cleaning does not flow into the work environment and contaminate workers. <b>The</b> <b>bags</b> travel through <b>the</b> device on a chain conveyor, which permits any product or dust cleaned from <b>the</b> <b>bags</b> to fall into a hopper at <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> device and be recycled back into the process via a screw conveyor.

40|$|Purpose: To report {{findings}} that could suggest an elliptical shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> capsular <b>bag.</b> Methods: Five eyes of three patients with axial length greater than 24 mm underwent phacoemulsification cataract surgery with plate-haptic multifocal toric intraocular lens (IOL) implantation oriented in the vertical meridian. Results: In all cases, correct orientation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> IOLs was verified 30 minutes after surgery. After 24 hours, all eyes demonstrated unwanted rotation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> IOLs ranging from 15 to 45 degrees. The IOLs remained stable {{in the new}} position in all cases until adhesion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> capsular <b>bag</b> took place. Conclusion: These observations could suggest that <b>the</b> perimeter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> capsular <b>bag</b> has an elliptical shape. Therefore, the IOL tends to become fixated in a meridian <b>of</b> <b>the</b> capsular <b>bag</b> that best fits <b>the</b> diagonal diameter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> IOL...|$|R

25|$|A simple {{generalization}} of the example considers {{a mixed bag}} of beans and a handful that contain either very few or very many white beans. The generalization considers both extremes. It requires more calculations and more comparisons {{to arrive at a}} formal answer, but the core philosophy is unchanged; If the composition of the handful is greatly different from that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bag,</b> then the sample probably originated from another bag. The original example is termed a one-sided or a one-tailed test while the generalization is termed a two-sided or two-tailed test.|$|E
25|$|Fabric filters or baghouses are {{the most}} {{commonly}} employed in general industry. They work by forcing dust laden air through a bag shaped fabric filter leaving the particulate to collect on the outer surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> and allowing the now clean air to pass through to either be exhausted into the atmosphere {{or in some cases}} recirculated into the facility. Common fabrics include polyester and fiberglass and common fabric coatings include PTFE (commonly known as Teflon). The excess dust buildup is then cleaned from the bags and removed from the collector.|$|E

25|$|A {{lifting bag}} is {{an item of}} diving {{equipment}} consisting of a robust and air-tight bag with straps, {{which is used to}} lift heavy objects underwater by means <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bag's</b> buoyancy. <b>The</b> heavy object can either be moved horizontally underwater by the diver or sent unaccompanied to the surface.|$|R
25|$|When filling bags, if each bag is {{completely}} filled before starting to fill <b>the</b> next <b>bag,</b> {{it is less}} likely that a runaway will be initiated, as only one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bags</b> can increase lift as it ascends. This will be <b>the</b> last <b>bag,</b> and <b>the</b> divers will be monitoring it most carefully while they are filling it, so {{will be more likely}} to react in time to regain control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lift.|$|R
25|$|A catcher {{nearly always}} throws {{with his right}} hand. Since most hitters are {{right-handed}} and stand {{to the left side}} of the plate when batting, a catcher who throws left-handed is forced to take some time to sidestep (or otherwise avoid) the right-handed hitter when he throws from behind the plate. In addition, a lefty's throw would tend to come in on the shortstop side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bag,</b> while a righty's throw would be on the second base side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bag,</b> which is where the runner is coming in. Consequently, players who are left-handed rarely play catcher. Left-handed catchers have only caught eleven big-league games since 1902, and Jack Clements, who played for 17 years at the end of the nineteenth century, is the only man in the history of baseball to play more than three hundred games as a left-handed catcher. However, some observers, including the famed statistician Bill James and ESPN writer Rob Neyer, have suggested that the real reason that there are no left-handed catchers is because left-handed players with strong throwing arms are almost always encouraged, at an early age, to become pitchers. Benny Distefano, the last lefty thrower to catch a big-league game (in 1989), noted that lefty catchers have difficulty on bunts up the third base line and on fielding throws home for plays at the plate.|$|E
25|$|Rapid {{deployment}} lift bags have a scuba cylinder {{mounted on}} the outside which contains sufficient air to inflate the bag at a specified depth. The bag can {{be attached to the}} load and when ready, the valve is opened and the diver swims clear. If the regulator pressure is set to a lower pressure than the over-pressure relief valve, a closed bag will automatically stop filling before the relief valve opens, but will be topped up if it leaks after reaching the surface. The regulator pressure must take into account the hydrostatic pressure difference between the top and bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> so that the bag will be completely filled.|$|E
25|$|A {{inverter}} or capsizing {{line can}} {{be attached to the}} top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bag.</b> This line should be long enough and strong enough to attach to an independent anchor point so that if the lift bag or rigging fails the bag will be inverted and the air will escape, preventing a runaway lift. This procedure is generally used for short distance transport near the bottom, as when aligning large components for assembly. With this method the load will generally hold the bag in the upright position, so the tripping line may be subjected to considerable load and the bag may not invert. An inverter line can also be attached to the load, so it will capsize the bag if it breaks free of the load, but this will not stop a runaway lift, and a holdback line is used for this purpose.|$|E

25|$|At the time, the Schuylkill Valley was a {{hotly contested}} territory, with {{constant}} conflicts over titles, some dating to before the American Revolution and British colonial rule, and rights.

The partners operated secretly to protect their interests. Tower would make the purchases, and convey the titles to legal dummies to hide the ownership of the land.
