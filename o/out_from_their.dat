Also on that day, {{at the spot}} where, on Christmas Day 1914, their regimental ancestors came <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> trenches to play football, men from the 1st Battalion, The Royal Welch Fusiliers played a football match with the German Battalion 371. The Germans won 2–1.|$|E
5|$|In ancient Rome, all the {{livestock}} known in ancient Egypt were available. In addition, rabbits were domesticated for food {{by the first}} century BC. To help flush them <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> underground burrows, the polecat was domesticated as the ferret, its use described by Pliny the Elder.|$|E
5|$|Regardless, on 1 April, Operation Pegasus began. Opposition {{from the}} North Vietnamese was {{light and the}} primary problem that {{hampered}} the advance was continual heavy morning cloud cover that slowed the pace of helicopter operations. As the relief force made progress, the Marines at Khe Sanh moved <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> positions and began patrolling at greater distances from the base. Things heated up for the air cavalrymen on 6 April, when the 3rd Brigade encountered an NVA blocking force and fought a day-long engagement.|$|E

5|$|From late April 1916, after a German-led Ottoman force {{attacked}} British yeomanry at Katia, British Empire {{forces in}} the region at first doubled from one brigade to two and then grew as rapidly as the developing infrastructure could support them. The construction of the railway and a water pipeline soon enabled an infantry division to join the light horse and mounted rifle brigades at Romani. During the heat of summer, regular mounted patrols and reconnaissance were carried <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> base at Romani, while the infantry constructed an extensive series of defensive redoubts. On 19 July, the advance of a large German, Austrian and Ottoman force across the northern Sinai was reported. From 20 July until the battle began, the Australian 1st and 2nd Light Horse Brigades took turns pushing out to clash with the advancing hostile column.|$|E
5|$|Nintendo's stake {{purchase}} allowed Rare {{to expand}} significantly. The {{number of staff}} members increased from 84 to 250, and Rare moved <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> headquarters at the Manor Farmhouse. Rare also developed a CGI arcade fighting game, Killer Instinct, on their own custom-built arcade machine. Killer Instinct was set to be released for Nintendo's own 64-bit system, the Nintendo 64 in 1995, but was forced to release the game for the 16-bit SNES system, and had to downgrade the game's graphics. Killer Instinct sold 3.2 million copies, and {{was followed by a}} sequel, Killer Instinct 2. Killer Instinct Gold, the console version of Killer Instinct 2, suffered from a graphical downgrade due to the compression technology used to fit the arcade version onto the smaller Nintendo 64 cartridge.|$|E
5|$|The Germans {{started the}} withdrawal, while the {{motorized}} Allied forces broke <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> bridgeheads and pursued the German units from behind. The rapid Allied advance posed {{a major threat}} for the Germans, who could not retreat fast enough. The Germans tried to establish a defense line at the Rhône to shield the withdrawal of several valuable units there. The US 45th and 3rd Divisions were pressing to the north-west with uncontested speed, undermining Wiese's plan for a new defense line. Barjols and Brignoles were taken by the two American divisions on 19August, which also were about to envelop Toulon as well as Marseille from the north, cutting off the German units there.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of October 16, Allen led two rifle {{companies}} (Bravo and Delta) of the 2nd Battalion <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> temporary night defensive position along the Ong Thanh Stream to patrol an area to the southeast, which was covered by thick jungle canopy. After marching for about , the battalion found a fortified Viet Cong bunker, so Allen ordered his men to pull back and directed airstrikes against Viet Cong positions. When the bombing runs were over, Allen’s men entered the camp and a firefight broke out with Viet Cong snipers firing down from trees in the surrounding areas. Again, Allen ordered his men to pull back and form a perimeter to protect their wounded soldiers, as artillery strikes were called in against Viet Cong bunker positions. The 2nd Battalion re-entered the camp, and they discovered the bodies of 17 dead Viet Cong soldiers. Allen's men then moved through {{the western end of}} the camp, and another fire-fight broke out with an estimated 60 Viet Cong soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The {{golden jackal}} often hunts alone, and {{sometimes}} in pairs, but rarely hunts in a pack. When hunting alone, it trots around an area and occasionally stops to sniff and listen. Once prey is located, the jackal conceals itself, quickly approaches its prey and then pounces on it. Single jackals hunt rodents, hares, and birds. They hunt rodents in grass by locating them with their hearing before leaping {{into the air and}} pouncing on them. In India, they can dig Indian gerbils <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> burrows, and they can hunt young, old, and infirm ungulates up to 4–5 times their body weight. Jackals search for hiding blackbuck calves throughout the day during the calving period. The peak times for their searches are the early morning and the late evening. When hunting in pairs or packs, jackals run parallel to their prey and overtake it in unison. When hunting aquatic rodents or birds, they will run along both sides of narrow rivers or streams and drive their prey from one jackal to another.|$|E

25|$|Chain Reaction is a {{mode that}} is similar to Turf War. This has the player {{capturing}} posts, but the player must do them in a specific order – one team works <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> base needing to capture 1 through 5 while the other team starts <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> home and needs to snag 5 through 1. King of the Hill has players capturing a hill, spawned on the map to score points. They must stay in the hill to score points while the enemy team tries to do the same.|$|E

25|$|The {{job of the}} centre-back, (or central defender) (historically {{called a}} centre-half) is to stop {{opposing}} players, particularly the strikers, from scoring, and to bring the ball <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> penalty area. As their name suggests, they play in a central position. Most teams employ two centre-backs, stationed {{in front of the}} goalkeeper. There are two main defensive strategies used by centre-backs: the zonal defence, where each centre-back covers a specific area of the pitch, and man-to-man marking, where each centre-back has the job of covering a particular opposition player.|$|E
25|$|Armenian {{fortunes}} {{were reversed}} in 867 with the accession of the Armenian emperor of Byzantium Basil I, whose successful military campaigns against the Arabs conclusively weakened Abbasid rule in Armenia. In 857, Smbat had been succeeded {{by his son}} Ashot I, who took a measured approach to gradually retake territories formerly held by the Arabs. He assumed the title prince of princes in 862 and appointed his brother Abas sparapet, {{as they began to}} push the Arabs <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> base in Tayk. His initial efforts to expel the ostikan of Arminiya failed, although this did not dissuade him in taking advantage of the Byzantine-Arab rivalry.|$|E
