5|$|The Enterprise {{successfully}} rendezvous in time {{to bring}} aboard the new host, a female (Nicole Orth-Pallavicini), much to Dr. Crusher's surprise. She helps with the other Trill to transplant Odan into the new host, and both Riker and Odan fully recover. When Odan attempts to continue their relationship, Dr. Crusher is uncomfortable, knowing both that the Trill appear to have no preferences on gender orientation, and that Odan will continue to live on {{in any number of}} hosts' bodies. Odan admits he still loves Dr. Crusher, but understands her confusion and discomfort, and promises to never forget her or their short time together. And Dr. Crusher replies that she loves Odan too; in Odan's new, female host body, Odan then kisses the inner wrist <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E
5|$|The survivors' vehicle {{suffers a}} blowout, {{prompting}} them to swerve onto a farm. The {{back of the}} car is penetrated by PVC pipes which injure Eugene, and he is rushed to the hospital. As rescuers arrive at the scene, Brian Gibbons, the son of a farm owner, is nearly killed by a speeding news van, but Rory saves him. Using the Jaws of Life Kat's rescuer accidentally activates the airbag and her head is impaled by a pipe protruding from her headrest. Her cigarette falls out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> and into a gasoline leak leading to the news van, causing the van to explode, and sending a barbed wire fence flying through the air, which kills Rory.|$|E

25|$|In 1440, {{the poet}} Kabir was also {{said to have}} been born of a virgin widow (a Hindu), through the palm <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b> Like Karna, Kabir was sent down the river in a basket; he was found and adopted by a family of Muslim weavers, downstream. This (presumably posthumous) account—which depicts Kabir as {{secretly}} descended from Hindus—was intended to legitimise Kabir's religious authority {{in the eyes of the}} Hindu population who venerated his works. This story is absent from Muslim and Sikh accounts of Kabir's work.|$|E
25|$|Pathologist Luca Lalli, from Perugia's {{forensic}} science institute, performed the autopsy on Kercher's body. Her injuries consisted of sixteen bruises and seven cuts. These included several bruises {{and a couple}} of insubstantial cuts on the palm <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b> Bruises on her nose, nostrils, mouth, and underneath her jaw were compatible with a hand being clamped over her mouth and nose. Lalli's autopsy report was reviewed by three pathologists from Perugia's {{forensic science}} institute who interpreted the injuries, including some to the genital region, as indicating an attempt to immobilize Kercher during sexual violence.|$|E

Her first task is to kidnap Martha Kent with her spouse, and stating that she and Kal-L wish for Kal-El, Connor Kent, and Martha, to be reunited with Jonathan Kent in death. She proved unable to deal with the resourcefulness of Martha Kent, and was set ablaze by the widow, but kept regenerating until Krypto intervened, ripping the black ring out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> and preventing regeneration for long enough to allow Superman and Conner Kent to destroy the Black Lantern powerhouses attacking Smallville, and reaching town to aid others unhindered.|$|E

25|$|González {{lived in}} Corpus Christi, Texas, {{with her husband}} Edmundo E. Mireles, also a schoolteacher, until her death in 1983. In her lifetime, she never earned acclaim for her novels, but she was {{nevertheless}} a prominent Corpus Christi citizen, and she published a couple pieces in the Southwest Review and Publications of the Texas Folklore Society. In the 1970s, González {{and her husband were}} interviewed by historian and archivist Martha Cotera for the University of Texas at Austin's Mexican American Library Project Cotera asked about González's 1934 Rockefeller grant and the novel that had resulted. Mireles said then that the Caballero manuscript had been destroyed; however, González indicated with a brief wave <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> that her husband's statement was untrue.|$|E
25|$|Surmounted on {{the main}} altar is a {{beautiful}} statue of St. Lucy holding up {{her eyes on the}} palm <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b> The exquisite stained glass windows when lit by sunlight create a panorama of colour further enhancing the transepts of the church. In a far corner of the church is a circular Baptismal Font of white marble carved with cherubs, and crowned by a statue of John the Baptist. On going up the narrow staircase that leads to the choir loft, one encounters 'Anthony Thomas', an enormous bell weighing 4300lbs. The bell has intricate engravings of elaborate floral wreaths and holy figures and symbols of Christianity, and it is the largest of the four bells shipped from Marseilles and christened at the cathedral in 1903. The choir loft also contains a unique pipe organ donated to the cathedral in 1934.|$|E
25|$|The Queen {{turns into}} an old lady and tries to force Kilala to eat a poison apple, making the dogs hold down Rei. Snow White appears and tells The Queen that, to save Kilala, she will eat the apple instead. Just before she can, however, Kilala knocks the apple out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> telling The Queen {{no one will be}} eating that apple and the Seven Dwarfs appear. They are all able to attack the Queen, pushing her into a Cauldron which turns her into a vulture. Afterwards, Snow White gives Kilala a ruby, which {{attaches}} itself to the Tiara and changes her and Rei back to normal. The Gate reappears and the two leave Snow White's world, following the light back to their world, which leads them to Erika. Rei questions why they would leave her behind, but then realizes it must be because she is not the Seventh Princess.|$|E

25|$|On March 8, 1806, Decatur married Susan Wheeler, the {{daughter}} of Luke Wheeler, the mayor of Norfolk, Virginia. She was well known for her beauty and intelligence among Norfolk and Washington society. They had met at a dinner and ball held by the mayor for a Tunisian ambassador {{who was in the}} United States negotiating peace terms for his country's recent defeat at Tunis under the silent guns of John Rodgers and Decatur. Before marrying Susan, Decatur had already vowed to serve in the U.S. Navy and maintained that to abandon his service to his country for personal reasons would make him unworthy <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b> Susan was once pursued by Vice President Aaron Burr and Jérôme Bonaparte, brother to Napoleon, both of whom she turned down. For several months after their marriage the couple resided with Susan's parents in Norfolk, after which Stephen received orders sending him to Newport to supervise the building of gunboats. The couple never had children during their fourteen years of marriage.|$|E

500|$|Ono's final {{album of}} the 1980s was Starpeace, a concept album that she {{intended}} {{as an antidote to}} Ronald Reagan's [...] "Star Wars" [...] missile defense system. On the cover, a warm, smiling Ono holds the Earth in the palm <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b> Starpeace became Ono's most successful non-Lennon effort. [...] The single [...] "Hell in Paradise" [...] was a hit, reaching No. 16 on the US dance charts and No. 26 on the Billboard Hot 100, and the video, directed by Zbigniew Rybczyński received major airplay on MTV and won [...] "Most Innovative Video" [...] at Billboard Music Video Awards in 1986. In 1986, Ono set out on a goodwill world tour for Starpeace, primarily visiting Eastern European countries.|$|E

500|$|The {{player can}} move with weapons drawn and use {{automatic}} targeting functions. Enemies can knock Regina's weapon out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> {{at which point}} she'll have to retrieve it. Sometimes [...] "DANGER" [...] may flash on the screen in perilous situations, {{at which point the}} player should push all the controller buttons as rapidly as possible to survive. If Regina becomes injured, she will hold her arm or struggle to walk. Med Paks can be used to heal Regina's health. Sometimes a trail of blood may appear, indicating that Regina is bleeding and will continue to lose health. Hemostats can be used to stop bleeding injuries. Two types of medical supplies are available in the game: Med Paks, which heals player health, and Hemostats, which stop bleeding injuries. If Regina dies, the player may continue from the room she died in. After five [...] "Continues" [...] are exhausted, the player must continue from their last save point.|$|E
500|$|During the {{rehearsal}} for that evening, Julie and Steve {{learn that the}} town sheriff is coming to arrest them. Steve takes out a large pocket knife and makes a cut on the back <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> sucking the blood and swallowing it. Pete returns with the sheriff, who insists that the show cannot proceed, because Julie is a mulatto woman married to a white man, and local laws prohibit such miscegenation. Julie admits {{that her mother was}} black, but Steve tells the sheriff that he also has [...] "black blood" [...] in him, so their marriage is legal in Mississippi. The troupe backs him up, boosted by the ship's pilot Windy McClain, a longtime friend of the sheriff. The couple have escaped the charge of miscegenation, but they still have to leave the show boat; identified as black, they can no longer perform for the segregated white audience. Cap'n Andy fires Pete, but in spite of his sympathy for Julie and Steve, he cannot violate the law for them.|$|E
500|$|On {{the way out}} of Hades, Euridice {{is delighted}} to be {{returning}} to earth, but Orfeo, remembering the condition related by Amore in act 1, lets go <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> and refusing to look at her, does not explain anything to her. She does not understand his action and reproaches him, but he must suffer in silence (Duet: [...] "Vieni, appaga il tuo consorte"/"Viens, suis un époux"). Euridice takes this to be a sign that he no longer loves her, and refuses to continue, concluding that death would be preferable. She sings of her grief at Orfeo's supposed infidelity in the aria [...] "Che fiero momento"/"Fortune ennemie" [...] (in 1774, there is a brief duet before the reprise). Unable to take any more, Orfeo turns and looks at Euridice; again, she dies. Orfeo sings of his grief in the famous aria [...] "Che farò senza Euridice?"/"J’ai perdu mon Eurydice" [...] ("What shall I do without Euridice?"/"I have lost my Euridice") Orfeo decides he will kill himself to join Euridice in Hades, but Amore returns to stop him (1774 only: Trio: [...] "Tendre Amour"). In reward for Orfeo's continued love, Amore returns Euridice to life, and she and Orfeo are reunited. After a four-movement ballet, all sing in praise of Amore ("Trionfi Amore"). In the 1774 version, the chorus ("L’Amour triomphe") precedes the ballet, to which Gluck had added three extra movements.|$|E

500|$|O'Malley {{moves in}} with new intern Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh), Meredith's half-sister. Lexie and O'Malley {{discover}} {{that he only}} failed his exam by a single point, leading him to confront Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.), the chief of surgery, {{to ask for a}} chance to retake the exam. He passes the second attempt, and begins to distance himself from Lexie, who has fallen in love with him. O'Malley supports Stevens when she discovers she has melanoma, and walks her down the aisle as she marries Karev. O'Malley begins to display a talent for trauma surgery, and is told by the chief of trauma surgery Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd) that it is definitely his specialty. He then abruptly and inexplicably decides to join the U.S. Army. While his friends at the hospital prepare an intervention to convince O'Malley to stay, they all work on a severely disfigured John Doe, brought in after a horrible bus accident, in which he pushed a woman {{out of the way and}} saved her life. When Meredith goes to check on John Doe, he seems to recognize her and will not let go <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b> After several attempts at trying, he succeeds in tracing [...] "007" [...] on Meredith's hand. Shocked, she realizes [...] "John Doe" [...] is in fact O'Malley. She informs the other surgeons and they rush him to surgery. However, he flatlines and is ultimately declared braindead. His organs are donated after Stevens confirms that is what O'Malley would have wanted, and he is buried a week later.|$|E
500|$|In 1927, under {{pressure}} from his family, Valdemar decided against providing Tschaikovsky with any further financial support, and the funds from Denmark were cut off. Duke George of Leuchtenberg, a distant relative of the Tsar, gave her a home at Castle Seeon. The Tsarina's brother, Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse, hired a private detective, Martin Knopf, to investigate the claims that Tschaikovsky was Anastasia. During her stay at Castle Seeon, Knopf reported that Tschaikovsky was actually a Polish factory worker called Franziska Schanzkowska. Schanzkowska had worked in a munitions factory during World War I when, shortly after her fiancé had been killed at the front, a grenade fell out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> and exploded. She had been injured in the head, and a foreman was killed in front of her. She became apathetic and depressed, was declared insane on 19 September 1916, and spent time in two lunatic asylums. In early 1920, she was reported missing from her Berlin lodgings, and since then had not been seen or heard from by her family. In May 1927, Franziska's brother Felix Schanzkowski was introduced to Tschaikovsky at a local inn in Wasserburg near Castle Seeon. Leuchtenberg's son, Dmitri, was completely certain that Tschaikovsky was an impostor {{and that she was}} recognized by Felix as his sister, but Leuchtenberg's daughter, Natalie, remained convinced of Tschaikovsky's authenticity. Leuchtenberg himself was ambivalent. According to one account, initially Felix declared that Tschaikovsky was his sister Franziska, but the affidavit he signed spoke only of a [...] "strong resemblance", highlighted physical differences, and said she did not recognize him. Years later, Felix's family said that he knew Tschaikovsky was his sister, but he had chosen to leave her to her new life, which was far more comfortable than any alternative.|$|E
2500|$|Both {{historic}} buildings were in bad shape. [...] However, after consulting structural engineers, the Epleys decided to restore it.
