40|$|Abstract-The {{effect of}} single-cycle <b>overloads</b> on the {{subsequent}} fatigue crack growth behavior of Incond 600 is studied. <b>Overloads</b> ranging from 10 to 50 % {{are applied to}} a sample undergoing baseline fatigue crack growth at constant AK. In all cases, the crack growth rate increases lightly immediately after the <b>overload</b> and then decreases rapidly to a minimum value before later returning to the pre-overload value. The plastic zone size, affected crack length and the crack growth increment at minimum crack growth rate, a’, are measured for each <b>overload.</b> The affected crack length is considerably larger than the <b>overload</b> plastic zone size for <b>overloads</b> greater than ZtQ. Consequently, although the minimum crack growth rate occurs within the plane stress <b>overload</b> plastic zone, {{the effect of the}} <b>overload</b> extends well beyond the <b>overload</b> region. Within the <b>overload</b> plastic zone, contact occurs between the crack faces due to the excessive deformation produced during the <b>overload</b> cycle. The size of the contact region agrees very well with the <b>overload</b> plastic zone size. Beyond the <b>overload</b> region, AI & remains less than the applied AK for some time due to the wedge action of the plastically deformed <b>overload</b> region, delaying recovery of the pre-overload crack growth rate. The crack growth rate recovers only after the crack grows out of the region of influence of the wedge...|$|R

The film depicts human trafficking as a matter of good and evil, provides interviews with survivors of human trafficking, and presents analysis from anti-trafficking advocates. Throughout the film, Robert Bilheimer encourages viewers to personally combat human trafficking.

40|$|AbstractDifferential {{pressure}} sensors using precision-engineered protection mechanisms provide an <b>overload</b> capability {{of at least}} Δp= 160 bar at a nominal range of Δp= 10 mbar. Silicon differential {{pressure sensors}} provide good mechanical properties, due to their low hysteresis and zero point stability. Because of their basic <b>overload</b> capability p< 1 bar (100 kPa), an <b>overload</b> protection is required that {{does not affect the}} sensor's sensitivity. An integrated micromechanical <b>overload</b> protection reduces the complexity; compared to state-of-the-art external <b>overload</b> protection made of stainless steel with defined oil filling. The presented measuring element achieves these characteristics for one-sided <b>overload</b> by limiting the deflection of the diaphragm with an integrated <b>overload</b> protection made of structured glass (Fig. 2). The <b>overload</b> resistant differential pressure sensor with nominal range Δp= 10 mbar is able to provide an average <b>overload</b> capability of Δp= 220 bar (Fig. 1).

40|$|With {{the intense}} {{competition}} between cloud providers, oversubscription is increasingly important to maintain profitability. Oversubscribing physical resources {{is not without}} consequences: it {{increases the likelihood of}} <b>overload.</b> Memory <b>overload</b> is particularly damaging. Contrary to traditional views, we analyze current data center logs and realistic Web workloads to show that <b>overload</b> is largely transient: up to 88. 1 % of <b>overloads</b> last for less than 2 minutes. Regarding <b>overload</b> as a continuum that includes both transient and sustained <b>overloads</b> of various durations points us to consider mitigation approaches also as a continuum, complete with tradeoffs with respect to application performance and data center overhead. In particular, heavyweight techniques, like VM migration, are better suited to sustained <b>overloads,</b> whereas lightweight approaches, like network memory, are better suited to transient <b>overloads.</b> We present Overdriver, a system that adaptively takes advantage of these tradeoffs, mitigating all <b>overloads</b> within 8 % of well-provisioned performance. Furthermore, under reasonable oversubscription ratios, where transient <b>overload</b> constitutes the vast majority of <b>overloads,</b> Overdriver requires 15 % of the excess space and generates a factor of four less network traffic than a migration-only approach...|$|R

5|$|The {{existing}} electrical grid, {{and local}} transformers in particular, {{may not have}} enough capacity to handle the additional power load that might be required in certain areas with high plug-in electric car concentrations. As recharging a single electric-drive car could consume {{three times as much}} electricity as a typical home, <b>overloading</b> problems may arise when several vehicles in the same neighborhood recharge at the same time, or during the normal summer peak loads. To avoid such problems, utility executives recommend owners to charge their vehicles overnight when the grid load is lower or to use smarter electric meters that help control demand. When market penetration of plug-in electric vehicles begins to reach significant levels, utilities will have to invest in improvements for local electrical grids in order to handle the additional loads related to recharging to avoid blackouts due to grid overload. Also, some experts have suggested that by implementing variable time-of-day rates, utilities can provide an incentive for plug-in owners to recharge mostly overnight, when rates are lower.|$|E
