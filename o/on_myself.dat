500|$|At the 2010 National Championships, Hardy {{made the}} American team that competed at the 2010 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships after {{finishing}} {{second in the}} 100-meter freestyle. [...] On August 5, despite being the world record holder in the 100-meter breaststroke, Hardy finished in seventh place {{with a time of}} 1:09.24. [...] At the first 50, Hardy came in first in 30.92, but faded badly at the end. Hardy did not blame her poor performances on her physical condition but rather her mental state. [...] On her final chance of making the team, on August 7, Hardy finished in second place in the 100-meter freestyle in 54.14, a personal best for her. [...] After the competition, Hardy said, [...] "I've been struggling so much with the pressure I put <b>on</b> <b>myself,</b> especially in the 100 [...] breaststroke." ...|$|E
500|$|St-Pierre's trainer Greg Jackson {{denied any}} wrongdoing, stating that Nurse was rubbing and tapping on St-Pierre's body {{as part of}} a drill to aid in his {{breathing}} techniques. [...] Jackson said that any Vaseline transferred from residue on Nurse's fingers was accidental and wiped off when pointed out. [...] Georges St-Pierre spoke to Sports Illustrated with regard to the controversy stating, [...] "I haven't seen the fight yet, but I remember at some point something happened and the athletic commission was complaining. [...] They used a towel to wet my back and wipe it off. [...] I don't mind. [...] I didn't put Vaseline <b>on</b> <b>myself</b> and I'm not a cheater." [...] However, St-Pierre offered Penn a rematch in the summer that Penn verbally accepted but is unlikely to happen due to the fact they have both since been scheduled for title defenses.|$|E
500|$|Sanz {{is known}} for his {{distinctive}} raspy vocals, which he attributes to his flamenco roots, crediting singer Camarón de la Isla as a major influence.

Sometimes, I'm harder <b>on</b> <b>myself</b> than any music critic can be. I'm laughing at that." [...] Throughout his youth, Sanz was heavily influenced by English-language heavy metal groups such as Iron Maiden and Dio, referring to himself as a [...] "heavy metal radical". He also feels that living in the city of Cadiz had a major impact on his musical style, where [...] "Any 7-year-old kid you find knows how to play guitar, play the cajón, knows how to sing.

500|$|By {{the end of}} May, Revere {{was back}} hitting mainly {{at the top of}} the order after manager Charlie Manuel decided to adjust the lineup in hopes of {{sparking}} some offense. He managed two hits in a game against the Miami Marlins on June 3, stole two bases, and stopped an extra-base hit from Adeiny Hechavarria. [...] "I just have to take it one game at a time and not put any pressure <b>on</b> <b>myself.</b> I'm finding my stroke", Revere later said of the game. On July 13, Revere suffered a fractured foot after a foul ball hit him while at-bat. He had surgery for the fracture on July 16. Although the initial timetable for Revere's return was six to eight weeks, the Phillies official website later published an article stating that there was no timetable for his return and they were unsure whether or not he will return for a remainder of the 2013 season. He ended up missing the rest of the 2013 season, and finished with a [...]305 batting average, 0 home runs, 17 runs batted in and 22 stolen bases.|$|E
500|$|PolyGram and Working Title Films, who had funded Fargo, backed The Big Lebowski with {{a budget}} of $15million. In casting the film, Joel remarked, [...] "we tend to write both for people we know and have worked with, and some parts without knowing who's {{going to play the}} role. In The Big Lebowski we did write for John [...] and Steve , but we didn't know who was getting the Jeff Bridges role." [...] In {{preparation}} for his role, Bridges met Dowd but actually [...] "drew <b>on</b> <b>myself</b> a lot from back in the Sixties and Seventies. I lived in a little place like that and did drugs, although I think I was a little more creative than the Dude." [...] The actor went into his own closet with the film's wardrobe person and picked out clothes that he had thought the Dude might wear. He wore his character's clothes home because most of them were his own. The actor also adopted the same physicality as Dowd, including the slouching and his ample belly.

500|$|Ganzi Mugula, {{who at the}} age of 33 was {{participating}} in his first Olympic Games, was notable for carrying the flag of Uganda in the opening and closing ceremonies. He attempted to qualify for the previous three Olympic Games but did not succeed, but made the London Summer Games via a universality place awarded by FINA because his best time of 27.51 seconds did not reach the [...] "A" [...] or [...] "B" [...] standard entry times for his event, the men's 50 metre freestyle. Mugula was drawn in the second heat on 2 August, finishing fifth out of eight swimmers, with a time of 27.58 seconds. He ranked ahead of Cameroon's Edingue Ekane (27.87 seconds) and Mulualem Girma of Ethiopia (28.99 seconds) but behind Jackson Niyomugabo from Rwanda (27.38 seconds) in a heat led by Djibouti's Abdourahman Osman (27.25 seconds). Overall he finished 53rd out of 58 swimmers, and was unable to advance to the semi-finals after being 5.11 seconds slower than the slowest competitor who progressed to the later stages. After the event Mugula said: [...] "I felt this time I was fitter. I think psychologically I put too much pressure <b>on</b> <b>myself.</b> But it's OK, I'm not disappointed. I'm an Olympian, that's what counts. It's worth all the effort. Medal or no medal, I'm a winner" ...|$|E

But in the present case I have no criterion of correctness." [...] This absence of any criterion of correctness is not a problem because it makes it more difficult for the private linguist to remember his sensation correctly; it is a problem because it undermines the intelligibility of such a concept as remembering the sensation, whether correctly or incorrectly.|$|E
