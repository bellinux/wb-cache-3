5|$|Fowles's {{presentation}} of Sarah, {{one of the}} most enigmatic female characters in literary history, is also psychoanalytically informed.

Through Sarah's deliberate spreading of lies about herself and her relationship with Charles, Fowles brilliantly brings about the various aspects of femininity that has the potential to authenticate, threaten, and expose the vanity of the male subjects.|$|E

5|$|Offscreen, Robert Mitchum's {{arrest and}} {{conviction}} for marijuana possession—he would serve {{two months in}} jail—was widely assumed to mean career death for RKO's most promising young star, but Hughes surprised the industry by announcing that his contract was not endangered. Of much broader significance, Hughes decided to get the jump on his Big Five competitors by being the first to settle the federal government's antitrust suit against the major studios, which had won a crucial Supreme Court ruling in United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc. Under the consent decree he signed, Hughes agreed to dissolve the old parent company, Radio-Keith-Orpheum Corp., and split RKO's production-distribution business and its exhibition chain into two entirely separate corporations—RKO Pictures Corp. and RKO Theatres Corp.—with the obligation to promptly sell off one or the other. While Hughes delayed the divorcement procedure until December 1950 and didn't actually sell his stock in the theater company for another three years, his decision to acquiesce was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crucial</b> steps {{in the collapse of}} classical Hollywood's studio system.|$|E
5|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crucial</b> {{points is}} that there are several {{different}} sources for the Battle itself, including poems and songs in Old English, Old Norse, Old Welsh, Middle English, Latin, and Anglo-Norman, highlighting a wide potential of sources in order to glean information about the battle from all sides of the campaign. Furthermore, while these sources might be seen as biased due to national origin and underlying romantic and heroic narrative constructions of the battle for each side, some of the sources, such as the Chronicle work as points of reference to the more lyrical constructions presented in other popular narrative formats. Although there is a relative lack of iron-clad primary sources that are completely unbiased, by taking into account all of these sources, historians and literary scholars can gain a fuller image of the military maneuvers and actions taken by the respective leaders of armies involved in this battle.|$|E

In this method, two subsequent transformations must be performed in order to incorporate the pCas9cr4 and pKDsg-XXX plasmids necessary for recombination. This is because preliminary studies found that when both Cas9 and sgRNA were expressed {{at the same time}} without the linear DNA to be incorporated into the genome, cell death was induced due to the disruption <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crucial</b> gene. Therefore, the expression of the recombination machinery and sgRNA were kept under strict control and transformed stepwise to reduce cell lethality.|$|E
