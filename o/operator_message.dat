5000|$|P5 is {{the address}} of a prompt string to be {{displayed}} to the user before accepting input. The advantage of providing this prompt, instead of as a prior write operation, is automatic redisplay in any situation requiring a refresh of the input line while the read is in progress (such as after an <b>operator</b> <b>message</b> has been broadcast to the terminal, or the user hits CTRL/R to redisplay the line).|$|E
50|$|Although e-mail {{capabilities}} {{have been}} extended to alphanumeric pagers and cellular text <b>messaging,</b> the <b>operator</b> <b>messaging</b> services are used by individuals who are not located near a computer or where sending a text message may be dangerous or impractical. Live <b>operator</b> <b>messaging</b> marries the technologies of voice messaging and text messaging {{as an alternative to}} voicemail service by using call forwarding features to redirect callers of your cell phone automatically to the <b>operator</b> <b>messaging</b> service after three or four unanswered rings. <b>Operator</b> <b>messaging</b> service providers remain profitable because the average call length is under 30 seconds and employees are often paid less than full-service answering service employees due to the limited training required.|$|R

50|$|<b>Operator</b> <b>Messaging</b> is the term, {{similar to}} Text Messaging and Voice Messaging, {{applying}} to an answering service call center who focuses on one specific scripting style {{that has grown}} out of the alphanumeric pager history.|$|R
50|$|Unlike voicemail, {{which can}} be a {{centralized}} or networked system that covers, and mostly extends, similar functions, an answering machine is set up in the user's premises alongside — or incorporated within — the user's land-line telephone. Unlike <b>operator</b> <b>messaging</b> the caller does not talk to a human.|$|R
50|$|Alpha-dispatch {{was never}} {{designed}} {{to replace a}} full-service answering service. Although both services will answer calls in a customer's name and advise the caller that the customer is unavailable, a full-service answering service will usually have additional information about the customer that they are encouraged {{to share with the}} caller such as business summary, website information, personal schedule, and other informational details. An alpha-dispatch service operator usually has no knowledge of the subscriber, except for their first and last name or company name, and serves only as a messaging bridge between the caller and the subscriber with the caller dictating what the operator should type as a message to the subscriber. Because of this difference, minimal training and supervising is required of the call center employees and therefore <b>operator</b> <b>messaging</b> service is much less expensive than full-service answering services. The low cost makes <b>operator</b> <b>messaging</b> an affordable alternative to voicemail.|$|R
40|$|Short Message Service {{available}} on digital GSM networks allowing text messages up to 160 characters {{to be sent}} and received via network <b>operator's</b> <b>message</b> center to mobile phone. A very popular service among people {{that can be used}} to develop advance communication between a business and customers. Information and confirmation can be sent via SMS to customer. Quick respond from the application will be send back immediately carrying an information about point when customer check point via SMS...|$|R
5000|$|When {{locations}} are known, usage patterns may emerge, from which inferences may be drawn. Traffic analysis is {{the discipline of}} drawing patterns from information flow among a set of senders and receivers, whether those senders and receivers are designated by location determined through direction finding, by addressee and sender identifications in the message, or even MASINT techniques for [...] "fingerprinting" [...] transmitters or <b>operators.</b> <b>Message</b> content, other than the sender and receiver, {{is not necessary to}} do traffic analysis, although more information can be helpful.|$|R
5000|$|As {{the use of}} {{alphanumeric}} pagers {{declined in}} the mid-1990s and cell phone text messaging availability and reliability increased ever since, these well-established alpha-dispatch call centers adjusted their technology to allow live operators' messages to be transmitted to cellular service providers {{in the same way}} as to pager service providers. Operators still follow the same answering procedures and have no idea if the subscriber is receiving the text message on a cell phone or a pager. The operator still serves as a [...] "relay" [...] or [...] "bridge" [...] for the caller to dictate their <b>message</b> to the <b>operator</b> <b>messaging</b> subscriber's device.|$|R
50|$|The {{aggregator}} model {{involves the}} mobile <b>messaging</b> <b>operator</b> signing multiple individual agreements with mobile operators to facilitate two-way SMS traffic through that <b>operator’s</b> SMSC (Short <b>Message</b> Service Center). SMS messages are {{delivered to the}} operator’s SMSC, but not the subscriber’s handset; the SMSC takes care of further handling of the message through the SS7 network.|$|R
50|$|Both {{hard-wired}} (cable) and through-water electronic voice {{communications systems}} {{may be used}} with surface-supplied diving. Wired systems are more popular {{as there is a}} physical connection to the diver for gas supply in any case, and adding a cable does not change the handling characteristics of the system. Wired communications systems are still more reliable and simpler to maintain than through-water systems. The communications equipment is relatively straightforward and may be of the two-wire or four-wire type. Two wire systems use the same wires for surface to diver and diver to surface messages, whereas four wire systems allow the diver's messages and the surface <b>operator's</b> <b>messages</b> to use separate wire pairs.|$|R

50|$|Inter-utility {{real time}} data {{exchange}} has become critical to the operation of interconnected systems {{in most parts of}} the world. For example, the development of electricity markets has seen the management of electricity networks by a functional hierarchy that is split across boundaries of commercial entities. At the top level there is typically a system operator with coordination responsibilities for dispatch and overall system security. Below this are regional transmission companies that tie together distribution companies and generating companies. In continental power systems there is now considerable interconnection across international borders. ICCP allows the exchange of real time and historical power system information including status and control data, measured values, scheduling data, energy accounting data and <b>operator</b> <b>messages.</b>|$|R

40|$|On July 18, 1997, the Transuranic (TRU) {{glovebox}} {{was tested}} using glovebox acceptance test procedure 13021 A- 86. The primary focus of the glovebox acceptance test was to examine control system interlocks, display menus, alarms, and <b>operator</b> <b>messages.</b> Limited mechanical testing involving the drum ports, hoists, drum lifter, compacted drum lifter, drum tipper, transfer car, conveyors, sorting table, lidder/delidder device and the TRU empty drum compactor were also conducted. As of February 25, 1998, 10 of the 102 test exceptions that affect the TRU glovebox remain open. These items will be tracked and closed via the WRAP Master Test Exception Database. As part of Test Exception resolution/closure the responsible individual closing the Test Exception performs a retest of the affected item(s) to ensure the identified deficiency is corrected, and, or to test items not previously available to support testing. Test exceptions are provided as appendices to this report...|$|R
5|$|Before {{receiving}} the French intelligence material, Rejewski {{had made a}} careful study of Enigma messages, particularly of the first six letters of messages intercepted on a single day. For security, each message was encrypted using different starting positions of the rotors, as selected by the <b>operator.</b> This <b>message</b> setting was three letters long. To convey it to the receiving operator, the sending <b>operator</b> began the <b>message</b> by sending the message setting in a disguised form — a six-letter indicator. The indicator was formed using the Enigma with its rotors set to a common global setting for that day, termed the ground setting, which was shared by all operators. The particular way that the indicator was constructed introduced a weakness into the cipher.|$|R

40|$|Preparing the Deep Space Network (DSN) {{stations}} to support spacecraft missions (referred to as pre-cal, for pre-calibration) is currently an operator and time intensive activity. Operators {{are responsible for}} sending and monitoring several hundred <b>operator</b> directivities, <b>messages,</b> and warnings. <b>Operator</b> directives are used to configure and calibrate the various subsystems (antenna, receiver, etc.) necessary to establish a spacecraft link. Messages and warnings are issued by the subsystems upon completion of an operation, changes of status, or an anomalous condition. Some points of pre-cal are logically parallel. Significant time savings could be realized if the existing Link Monitor and Control system (LMC) could support the operator in exploiting the parallelism inherent in pre-cal activities. Currently, operators may work on the individual subsystems in parallel, however, the burden of monitoring these parallel operations resides solely with the <b>operator.</b> <b>Messages,</b> warnings, and directives are all presented as they are received; without being correlated to the event that triggered them. Pre-cal is essentially an overhead activity. During pre-cal, no mission is supported, and no other activity can be performed using the equipment in the link. Therefore, it is highly desirable to reduce pre-cal time as much as possible. One approach to do this, {{as well as to}} increase efficiency and reduce errors, is the LMC Operator Assistant (OA). The LMC OA prototype demonstrates an architecture which can be used in concert with the existing LMC to exploit parallelism in pre-cal operations while providing the operators with a true monitoring capability, situational awareness and positive control. This paper presents an overview of the LMC OA architecture and the results from initial prototyping and test activities...|$|R
40|$|We propose an {{efficient}} nonparametric strategy for learning a <b>message</b> <b>operator</b> in expectation propagation (EP), which takes as input {{the set of}} incoming messages to a factor node, and pro-duces an outgoing message as output. This learned operator replaces the multivariate inte-gral required in classical EP, which may not have an analytic expression. We use kernel-based re-gression, which is trained {{on a set of}} probabil-ity distributions representing the incoming mes-sages, and the associated outgoing messages. The kernel approach has two main advantages: first, it is fast, as it is implemented using a novel two-layer random feature representation of the input message distributions; second, it has prin-cipled uncertainty estimates, and can be cheaply updated online, meaning it can request and in-corporate new training data when it encounters inputs on which it is uncertain. In experiments, our approach is able to solve learning problems where a single <b>message</b> <b>operator</b> is required for multiple, substantially different data sets (logis-tic regression for a variety of classification prob-lems), where it is essential to accurately assess uncertainty and to efficiently and robustly update the <b>message</b> <b>operator.</b> ...|$|R
