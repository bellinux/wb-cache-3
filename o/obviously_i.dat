5|$|I {{feel that}} {{talking about it}} trivializes it. I've been {{studying}} the Cabala , which is the mystical interpretation of the Torah. I've studied Buddhism and Hinduism and I've been practising yoga and <b>obviously</b> <b>I</b> {{know a lot about}} Catholicism. There are indisputable truths that connect all of them, and I find that very comforting and kind. My spiritual journey is to be open to everything. Pay attention to what makes sense, be absorbed. For me, yoga is the closest thing to our real nature.|$|E
25|$|Regarding {{comments}} he made {{suggesting that}} contracts for the mega-fight {{were close to}} being finalized, De La Hoya told BoxingScene.com on July 26, 2010: I think I said it because I get the question asked so many times that, <b>obviously,</b> <b>I</b> was fed up and tired of it and I just said like, yeah, yeah, it's gonna get made. So it was a quick answer that I should have obviously thought about. But, obviously, negotiations weren't going on. Nothing was going on.|$|E

I got away from the one thing that kept me on the straight and narrow and that was my relationship with the Lord. That should always come first. Hopefully some good will come out of this. It just crossed my mind that night, 'Can I have a drink?' <b>Obviously</b> <b>I</b> can't and this reinforces that. Since that night, I have not had another thought like that. I know it's something I shouldn't do because it leads to other things.|$|E

But to me anyway — and <b>obviously</b> <b>I</b> wrote it so maybe I'm biased, but — it's not a sappy love song. ... We've never done that before, and honestly I don't {{have a whole lot}} of experience writing love songs, or anyways lyrics that are like this." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite the film's darkness, Nolan {{wanted to}} make the film appeal to a wide age range. [...] "Not the {{youngest}} kids <b>obviously,</b> <b>I</b> think what we've done is probably a bit intense for them but I certainly didn't want to exclude the sort of ten to 12-year olds, because as a kid I {{would have loved to have}} seen a movie like this." [...] Because of this, nothing gory or bloody was filmed.|$|E
500|$|When {{appearing}} {{on a panel}} of comedy judges at the 2007 Edinburgh International Television Festival, Frank Skinner, in response to The Vicar of Dibley and The Catherine Tate Show being voted the best comedies in a public poll, called it [...] "the best sitcom that anyone from the comedy circuit has done [...] <b>Obviously</b> <b>I</b> was hoping it would be shit" [...] (Skinner starred in his own failed sitcom, Shane in 2004).|$|E

500|$|From childhood, Woods {{was raised}} as a Buddhist, and he {{actively}} practiced this faith from childhood {{until well into}} his adult professional golf career. In a 2000 article, Woods {{was quoted as saying}} he [...] "believes in Buddhism... Not every aspect, but most of it." [...] He has attributed his deviations and infidelity to his losing track of Buddhism. He said, [...] "Buddhism teaches me to stop following every impulse and to learn restraint. <b>Obviously</b> <b>I</b> lost track of what I was taught." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1988, a {{representative}} for Kodak said Cosby had become [...] "synonymous with quality products and quality services". Ebony agreed, saying Cosby {{has the advantage}} of being able to be selective. Cosby said his belief in their product is an attribute, stating, [...] "if I presented a Bill Cosby who didn't care, their sales would stop right there on the screen. <b>Obviously,</b> <b>I</b> could never do that. Once I believe in the product I aim to sell it, and that's what I think I do better than anybody".|$|E
500|$|The general {{pattern of}} {{reaction}} has been typified by Bob Kerrey, {{president of the}} New School and former Senator from Nebraska, who originally stated that Hsu had been [...] "a terrific member" [...] of the New School board. After Hsu resigned as a board member, Kerrey said the university did not do background checks of prospective trustees and that he hoped that Hsu [...] "didn't break the law." [...] After Hsu became a two-time fugitive, Kerrey remarked, [...] "I thought that I knew him, but <b>obviously</b> <b>I</b> didn’t." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Crazy in Love" [...] was re-recorded by Beyoncé for {{the film}} Fifty Shades of Grey (2015) and used for its trailer which was {{released}} on July 24, 2014. This slowed-down version was produced by Boots with violin arrangements by Margot, both of whom worked on Beyoncé's fifth studio album. Margot said, [...] "It inspires me to work on other artists' songs [...] it pushes my boundaries {{in a direction that}} I wouldn't necessarily come up with. <b>Obviously</b> <b>I</b> know how 'Crazy in Love' goes, but I knew there was the possibility her vocals would be different. It's almost more vulnerable and beautiful this way, because you do do crazy things when you fall in love. To hear the mood reversed and flipped makes it even more powerful." ...|$|E
500|$|In July 2006, The Observer Music Monthly interviewed Timberlake {{and stated}} that the track [...] "is arguably the album's 'Cry Me a River'." [...] In response, Timberlake said, [...] "It is similar. You go back to Aaliyah's biggest record, 'Are You That Somebody' – it's similar to that too because it's that percussive ballad." [...] When asked about the lyrics, [...] "There's just one thing I need from you: say I do", being autobiographical, he said no, adding that the line before that, [...] "this ring here {{represents}} my heart", is about marriage and love. Timberlake stated, [...] "It's not specifically about marriage, but about a humble approach to love. None of it is autobiographical, though <b>obviously</b> <b>I</b> have experience to draw from." ...|$|E
500|$|Not surprisingly, Quentin Tarantino {{has lately}} {{become the focus}} {{for this sort of}} {{criticism}} (about the relationship between the movies and acts of violence). The fact that Django Unchained arrived in theaters right {{around the time of the}} Sandy Hook massacre didn't help. Yet he has refused to give an inch in discussing the link between movie violence and real life. <b>Obviously</b> <b>I</b> don't think one has to do with the other. Movies are about make-believe. It's about imagination. Part of the thing is trying to create a realistic experience, but we are faking it. Is it possible that anyone in our cynical world credits a self-serving sophistry like this? Of course an industry under fire will claim that its hands are clean, just as the NRA has done – and of course a favorite son, be it Tarantino or LaPierre, can be counted on to make the claim louder than anyone else. But do they really believe that imaginative expression is without consequence? ...|$|E

500|$|On November 24, 2015, Frusciante {{announced}} that he was releasing free unreleased songs dating from 2008-2013 on his own official Bandcamp and SoundCloud pages. He also debunked the interview about him retiring from the music industry, saying that his words were taken out of context. The announcement was made via Frusciante's rarely updated website in an open letter titled [...] "Hello audience," [...] where Frusciante provides an in-depth response to the reporter who, according to him, misquoted him. He writes, [...] "I also must clear something up. I normally don’t read my press, but I heard about this quote, recently taken out of context by some lame website and made into a headline, in which I said 'I have no audience'. This has been misinterpreted, and by no fault of the excellent journalist who interviewed me for the fine publication Electronic Beats. [...] <b>Obviously</b> <b>I</b> have a public audience. I am aware of them, and they know who they are." [...] He continues, [...] "Reduced to a single sentence, it would have been accurate to say that, at this point, I have no particular audience in mind while I am making music." ...|$|E
500|$|M.I.A. {{has been}} a {{supporter}} of WikiLeaks and Julian Assange. In her own book, M.I.A. wrote regarding Wikileaks, [...] "So <b>obviously</b> <b>I</b> love Wikileaks because, after I’d gone through the whole backlash, {{they were the first}} news information site to confirm any news on the Sri Lankan war in the truest form; they were the first to release information stating the truth about {{what had happened to the}} Tamils as I knew it and to reveal that the United Nations was aware that the Sri Lankan government was lying—war crimes had been committed but their hands were tied because any time anyone tried to impose sanctions, governments would walk out. [...] I support Wikileaks because of that." [...] She composed the theme to Assange's television show The World Tomorrow and later stood by Assange's side as he held a press conference at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London where Assange was successfully granted political asylum by Ecuador in August 2012. [...] "I ask President Obama to do the right thing. The United States must renounce its witch hunt against WikiLeaks," [...] Assange said at the press conference. She posted a photo of Assange from within the embassy, and later tweeted, [...] "hummmm after this day 2things have 2 happen....., either 500 cops turn up outside every rape case reported even if it's without charge. or we get raped by the powerz that be and we deal 4eva." [...] The tweets were in reference to an arrest warrant the Swedish Prosecutor's Office issued in August 2010 for Assange on two charges: rape and molestation. Earlier in 2012 Britain's Supreme Court denied an appeal by Assange to avoid extradition to Sweden to face these charges. In November 2013, Assange appeared via Skype to open M.I.A.'s New York City concert. Also, on 18 September 2014 Maya tweeted a link to a documentary on YouTube entitled [...] "The Internet's Own Boy: Aaron Swartz". The documentary is about the life of Aaron Swartz, who was a computer programmer, writer, political organiser and Internet hacktivist. In the same tweet Maya included a link and invitation to RSVP to a party to launch Julian Assange's new book [...] "When Google Met WikiLeaks".|$|E
