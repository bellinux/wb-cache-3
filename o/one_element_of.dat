5|$|The {{division}} {{was located in}} three states, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Louisiana. The 1st Brigade was headquartered in Tulsa, Oklahoma and had elements of the 377th and 379th in regiments in its battalions. The 2nd Brigade was headquartered in Lawton, Oklahoma with elements of the 378th and 379th Regiments. The 3rd Brigade was headquartered in Stillwater, Oklahoma, a move made in September 1975, and consisted of only 291st Regiment elements. The 4th Brigade was headquartered in Bossier City, Louisiana, a suburb of Shreveport, and includes the 95th Regiment and <b>one</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> the 379th. The Committee Group was headquartered in Little Rock, Arkansas with no Regimental elements. The 95th Support Battalion was headquartered in Midwest City, Oklahoma with the Division Headquarters, Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 95th Division Leadership Academy, and the 95th Division Maneuver Training Command. On 1 January 1979 the division's four brigades was reorganized specifically for one station unit training.|$|E
5|$|The {{injunction}} {{against the}} project forced Alyeska to do further research {{throughout the summer}} of 1970. The collected material {{was turned over to}} the Interior Department in October 1970, and a draft environmental impact statement was published in January 1971. The 294-page statement drew massive criticism, generating more than 12,000 pages of testimony and evidence in Congressional debates by the end of March. Criticisms of the project included its effect on the Alaska tundra, possible pollution, harm to animals, geographic features, and the lack of much engineering information from Alyeska. <b>One</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> opposition the report quelled was the discussion of alternatives. All the proposed alternatives—extension of the Alaska Railroad, an alternative route through Canada, establishing a port at Prudhoe Bay, and more—were deemed to pose more environmental risks than construction of a pipeline directly across Alaska.|$|E

25|$|Japanese {{occupation}} of the Philippines was opposed by large-scale underground guerrilla activity. The American-aligned Philippine Army, as well as remnants of the U.S. Army Forces Far East, continued to fight the Japanese and pro-Japanese paramilitary forces in a guerrilla war and was considered an auxiliary unit of the United States Army. Their effectiveness was such {{that by the end}} of the war, Japan controlled only twelve of the forty-eight provinces. <b>One</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> resistance in the Central Luzon area was furnished by the Hukbalahap, which armed some 30,000 people and extended their control over much of Luzon.|$|E
25|$|During the Qing dynasty, {{criminal}} justice {{was based on}} extremely detailed Great Qing Legal Code. <b>One</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> the traditional Chinese {{criminal justice}} system {{is the notion that}} criminal law has a moral purpose, one of which is to get the convicted to repent and see the error of his ways. In the traditional Chinese legal system, a person could not be convicted of a crime unless he has confessed. This often led to the use of torture, in order to extract the necessary confession. These elements still influence modern Chinese views toward law. All capital offenses were reported to the capital and required the personal approval of the emperor.|$|E

Raimi had been impressed by his performance in Frida and also felt he had the physicality.

Although he was not familiar with Doc Ock, Molina found <b>one</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> the comics that he wanted to maintain, and that was the character's cruel, sardonic sense of humor.|$|E
25|$|The Missile Defense Alarm System, or MIDAS, was an American {{system of}} 12 early-warning {{satellites}} that provided limited notice of Soviet {{intercontinental ballistic missile}} launches between 1960 and 1966. Originally intended {{to serve as a}} complete early-warning system working in conjunction with the Ballistic Missile Early Warning System, cost and reliability concerns limited the project to a research and development role. Three of the system's 12 launches ended in failure, and the remaining nine satellites provided crude infrared early-warning coverage of the Soviet Union until the project was replaced by the Defense Support Program, which served as a successor program. MiDAS represented <b>one</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> the United States's first generation of reconnaissance satellites that also included the Corona and Samos series. Though MiDAS failed in its primary role as a system of infrared early-warning satellites, it pioneered the technologies needed in successor systems.|$|E
25|$|After the WSC splits {{off from}} the Norwegian Atlantic Current it begins to enter very cold {{atmospheric}} conditions. The cold atmosphere is able to cool the surface water, {{and in some instances}} this water cools so much that some of the WSC water actually sinks due to its density increase, all the while holding its salinity constant. This is <b>one</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> the formation of the Lower Arctic Intermediate Water. As the current continues to move northward and reaches the continental shelf of western Svalbard it begins to encounter sea-ice. The sea-ice melts due to the warmth of the WSC, and thus a surface layer of very freshwater begins to exist. Winds mix the freshwater and the warm salty water of the WSC mix, creating some Arctic Surface Water. This Arctic Surface Water is now less dense than the Atlantic Water in the WSC and thus the WSC begins to sink underneath the Arctic Surface Water. At this point the WSC is still relatively warm and very saline. Thus, this allows the Atlantic Water in the WSC to be completely isolated from the surface waters.|$|E

25|$|A graded poset (with {{positive}} integer ranks) cannot {{have any}} elements x for which arbitrarily long chains with greatest element x exist, as otherwise {{it would have}} to have elements of arbitrarily small (and eventually negative) rank. For instance, the integers (with the usual order) cannot be a graded poset, nor can any interval (with more than <b>one</b> <b>element)</b> <b>of</b> rational or real numbers. (In particular, graded posets are well-founded, meaning that they satisfy the descending chain condition (DCC): they do not contain any infinite descending chains. has arbitrarily long chains descending fromnbsp&, but has no infinite descending chains.) Henceforth we shall therefore only consider posets in which this does not happen. This implies that whenever xnbsp&<nbsp&y we can get from x to y by repeatedly choosing a cover, finitely many times. It also means that (for positive integer rank functions) compatibility of ρ with the ordering follows from the requirement about covers. As a variant of the definition of a graded poset, Birkhoff allows rank functions to have arbitrary (rather than only nonnegative) integer values. In this variant, the integers can be graded (by the identity function) in his setting, and the compatibility of ranks with the ordering is not redundant. As a third variant, Brightwell and West define a rank function to be integer-valued, but don't require its compatibility with the ordering; hence this variant can grade even e.g. the real numbers by any function, as the requirement about covers is vacuous for this example.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} Tomb Raider {{theme was}} composed by Nathan McCree. He created the original theme music after having discussions with Gard {{about the character}} of Lara Croft. Having decided to use Classical English music as an inspiration, he decided to create something simple for the theme song. Its simplicity made rearrangements and orchestrations easy. For {{his work on the}} first three Tomb Raider games, he was given fairly minimal briefs, and for Tomb Raider III he was working on the game as a freelancer as he had left the company. For The Last Revelation, Peter Connelly replaced Nathan McCree as the main composer, using McCree's music as a basis for his work. He composed the opening theme for The Last Revelation, saying that the opening melody came to him out of the blue, and added Egyptian motifs to fit in with the game's setting. Chronicles was originally going to have a sizeable original opening theme, but due to time constraints the majority of it ended up being discarded, much to Connelly's later regret. Only the opening segment survived. The music for Angel of Darkness, composed by Connelly and Martin Iveson, was the <b>one</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> production that did not encounter problems, as recording was finished before the major content cuts happened. Scored using a full orchestra as opposed to the synthesised instruments of previous titles, it was performed by the London Symphony Orchestra.|$|E
