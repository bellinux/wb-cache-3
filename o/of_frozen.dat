5|$|The {{game was}} played in {{extremely}} cold and icy conditions, still the worst in Sun Bowl history. Three inches of snow fell {{on top of a}} layer <b>of</b> <b>frozen</b> rain the day before the game, and at kickoff the teams took the field under cloudy skies and in below-freezing temperatures. Despite the inclement weather, 15,000-seat Kidd Field was approximately half full, and bowl officials estimated the crowd at around 10,000 people.|$|E

5|$|During World War II, a large {{underground}} {{cold store}} at Smithfield was the theatre of secret experiments led by Dr Max Perutz on pykrete, {{a mixture of}} ice and woodpulp, believed to be possibly tougher than steel. Perutz's work, inspired by Geoffrey Pyke and part of Project Habakkuk, was meant to test the viability of pykrete as a material to construct floating airstrips in the Atlantic to allow refuelling of cargo planes in support of Admiral the Earl Mountbatten's operations. The experiments were carried out by Perutz and his colleagues in a refrigerated meat locker in a Smithfield Market butcher's basement, behind a protective screen <b>of</b> <b>frozen</b> animal carcasses. These experiments became obsolete {{with the development of}} longer range aircraft and the project was then abandoned.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{describe}} the supply chain management <b>of</b> imported <b>frozen</b> beef from Australia to Indonesia; to analyze where the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats for the frozen meat distributor, and what strategy should be chosen; and to analyze alternatives of cooperation between imported frozen beef distribution with local beef distribution chain. The research approach is qualitative, and the research strategy is a case study. This research was conducted in Jakarta, data collecting technique by interview method and literature study. Data analysis techniques use supply chain management (SCM) and strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis. The results show that the distribution chain management <b>of</b> imported <b>frozen</b> beef needs to tripartite cooperation with government and local beef distributors to conduct joint marketing <b>of</b> imported <b>frozen</b> beef and cooler procurement to the point of retailers in traditional markets; expanding the market share <b>of</b> imported <b>frozen</b> beef to industrial segments (hotels, restaurant, catering company; and meat processing factories); and cooperate with imported beef suppliers to overcome the problem of taste flavor and lack of weight <b>of</b> imported <b>frozen</b> meat, and clarify halal certification...|$|R

The product {{was an attempt}} to introduce a between-meals snack to KFC, and was marketed towards teenagers. In April 2010, the Double Down sandwich was launched. Criticised as an unhealthy product, it featured two pieces of fried chicken in lieu of a conventional bread bun. It {{has proved to be a}} success for the company, with 15 million Double Downs sold worldwide between March 2011 and March 2013.

5|$|In October the {{dry season}} sets in across much of Florida (starting early in the month in {{northern}} Florida and {{near the end of}} the month in deep southern Florida) and lasts until late April in most years. Fronts from mid-latitude storms north of Florida occasionally pass through northern and central parts of the state which bring light and brief winter rainfall. Mid and late winter can become severely dry in Florida. In some years {{the dry season}} becomes quite severe and water restrictions are imposed to conserve water. While most areas of Florida do not experience any type <b>of</b> <b>frozen</b> precipitation, north Florida can see fleeting snow or sleet a few times each decade.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{disputes}} between Karta and Ladbroke led the British firm {{to exit the}} project, and its shares were assumed by Alfred Akirov's Alrov company. However, further objections from many sourcesincluding religious groups opposed to an entertainment area {{so close to the}} Old City and possible operation on the Jewish Sabbathkept construction at a crawl. Both Alrov and Karta accused each other of breach of contract and sued. After years <b>of</b> <b>frozen</b> construction and drawn-out mediation, the Jerusalem district court found parts of both parties' complaints to be justified and ordered 100 million NIS paid to Alrov by Karta, which allowed construction to resume.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} {{possible}} explanations for the high mortality rate of the 1918 influenza pandemic. Some {{research suggests that the}} specific variant of the virus had an unusually aggressive nature. One group of researchers recovered the original virus from the bodies <b>of</b> <b>frozen</b> victims, and found that transfection in animals caused a rapid progressive respiratory failure and death through a cytokine storm (overreaction of the body's immune system). It was then postulated that the strong immune reactions of young adults ravaged the body, whereas the weaker immune systems of children and middle-aged adults resulted in fewer deaths among those groups.|$|E
5|$|Acting on a {{tip from}} Strax, the Doctor visits the Great Intelligence Institute posing as Sherlock Holmes. He confronts Dr. Simeon and find a large glass globe in Simeon's office that {{contains}} psychic snow. The Doctor speaks to the Great Intelligence, the entity that has been speaking to Dr. Simeon {{since he was a}} boy. He learns that the Great Intelligence has been controlling the snowmen and has taken interest in Latimer's pond. The Doctor visits the pond and deduces that the Great Intelligence is using the old governess' body as a DNA blueprint to form an ice creature that will retain its form and not melt. While Clara is putting the children to bed, the frozen body of the governess breaks into the house. The Doctor fights her off and is joined by Vastra, Jenny and Strax. Dr. Simeon arrives with more snowmen and tells them he wants the governess' ice body. The Doctor flees with Clara to the roof of the mansion and then to the TARDIS hovering overhead. They are pursued by the ice governess, whom the Doctor traps under a layer <b>of</b> <b>frozen</b> ice crystals. Inside the TARDIS the Doctor gives Clara a TARDIS key, but the ice governess arrives and pulls Clara down off the cloud.|$|E

5|$|In November, {{before the}} release <b>of</b> <b>Frozen,</b> Anna and Elsa began making {{appearances}} at Walt Disney Parks and Resorts in Florida and California through meet and greets. In Walt Disney World, the attractions {{were set up}} in the Norway Pavilion of Epcot in recognition of the Scandinavian cultural elements that went into the film's design. In Disneyland, a winter-themed cottage was {{set up in the}} Fantasyland section, with a talking audio-animatronic Olaf sitting on the cottage roof. In February 2014, these meet-and-greet sessions were extended indefinitely, with wait time to meet the princesses frequently exceeding two hours, which is longer than any previous Disney characters. Additionally, Elsa, Anna, and Olaf were given a Frozen-themed float for Disneyland Paris' Disney Magic on Parade. On March 9, 2014, the three made appearances again on their own Frozen parade float in Festival of Fantasy Parade at Magic Kingdom theme park. On April 20, 2014, Anna and Elsa moved from Epcot to the Princess Fairytale Hall at Magic Kingdom, with wait time to see the characters amounted to three hours, compared to Cinderella's and Rapunzel's 15 minutes.|$|E

5|$|Porcini {{are sold}} fresh in markets {{in summer and}} autumn in Central and Southern Europe, and dried or canned at other times of the year, and {{distributed}} worldwide to countries where they are not otherwise found. They are eaten and enjoyed raw, sautéed with butter, ground into pasta, in soups, and in many other dishes. In France, they are used in recipes such as cèpes à la Bordelaise, cèpe frits and cèpe aux tomates. Porcini risotto is a traditional Italian autumn dish. Porcini are a feature of many cuisines, including Provençal, and Viennese. They are used in soups and consumed blanched in salads in Thailand. Porcini can also be frozen—either raw or first cooked in butter. The colour, aroma, and taste <b>of</b> <b>frozen</b> porcini deteriorate noticeably if frozen longer than four months. Blanching or soaking and blanching as a processing step before freezing can extend the freezer life up to 12 months. They are {{also one of the}} few mushroom species pickled and sold commercially.|$|E
