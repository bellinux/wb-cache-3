5|$|In April 1863, {{the fort}} was {{named in honor}} of the {{recently}} deceased Brigadier General George Dashiell Bayard, who had been killed on December 13, 1862, at the Battle of Fredericksburg. At the time of its dedication, the fort was roughly complete. Round in shape and surrounded by trenches and abati, the fort's guns faced north, overlooking River Road. A service road crossed the trenches in the southern half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fort,</b> connecting with River Road behind the fort. Rifle pits extended northeast to Fort Reno and southwest to Fort Simmons. A small battery of guns, named Battery Bayard, was an outwork <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fort</b> and covered a blind spot in the ravine to the northwest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fort.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the center}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fort</b> {{there is a}} {{courtyard}} planted with trees.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} <b>the</b> meta-functional typology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forts</b> <b>of</b> Kaunas Fortress as {{the unique}} architectural-urban objects {{that can help}} {{to create a more}} preferred, legible and complex cityscape. Space syntax analysis methodology is applied for <b>the</b> analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forts.</b> Two aspects are investigated. The first one: location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forts</b> in <b>the</b> axial map <b>of</b> Kaunas is considered while evaluating depth, global integration, local integration and other features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> map. The second one: structure of convex spaces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> all 10 remaining forts is analysed in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> depth, “here and there” relations, serial vision, etc. Significant changes or destructions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original plan <b>of</b> <b>the</b> analysed objects are considered as well. Meta-functional typology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forts</b> in terms <b>of</b> contemporary architecture is offered. <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> investigation are significant for <b>the</b> utilisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forts</b> within <b>the</b> contemporary urban context...|$|R

5|$|The Apple River Fort Historic Foundation began {{attempting}} {{to locate the}} original site <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fort</b> {{in the spring of}} 1995.

The group, unable to determine the veracity of the tale, hired an archaeologist to determine the location of the old frontier fortification.|$|E
5|$|The {{main body}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fort</b> {{consisted}} of a diamond-shaped structure made up of two flanks and two faces. The two faces and the right flank originally had embrasures, but they were dismantled in the late 19th century by the British. A blockhouse, with courtyards on either side, was located in the centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fort.</b>|$|E

50|$|Nowadays, <b>the</b> {{construction}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Saint Petersburg Dam {{has led to}} some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forts</b> being demolished. <b>The</b> dam also permitted Kronstadt {{and some}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forts</b> to be reached without using a boat. Among the most important surviving forts are <b>Fort</b> Konstantin, <b>the</b> biggest in <b>the</b> Gulf <b>of</b> Finland; <b>Fort</b> Rif on <b>the</b> western shore <b>of</b> <b>the</b> island; and <b>the</b> particularly well-preserved <b>Fort</b> Alexander I (Plague <b>Fort).</b> <b>The</b> largest and <b>the</b> newest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forts,</b> built at <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20th century, is Fort Totleben, named after Eduard Totleben.|$|R

5|$|After {{numerous}} proposals {{the sand}} hills rear and north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fort</b> were removed in 1882, improving the fort's land defence {{and allowing the}} 64-pounder guns to sweep the Semaphore jetty. This now levelled area {{was used as a}} bivouac and exercise area for the colony's volunteer troops. A stable, office, shed and gunner's store were also erected north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fort.</b> The gunner's shed was damaged by fire in 1895 and replaced further eastward. These buildings did not survive into the 21st century.|$|E
5|$|An irregularly shaped parade area {{occupies}} the middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fort,</b> which is divided by a sloping ramp {{leading up to}} the casemates. A small brick building – originally used as a laboratory or shell-filling facility – stands {{to the right of the}} ramp. The fort is entered through a single gateway on its west side, protected against landward attackers by a caponier. The front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fort</b> was surrounded by a dry ditch, in which there were originally four caponiers to provide musketry defence. A very wide outer wet ditch blocked access from the riverside.|$|E
50|$|In the First World War <b>the</b> {{vulnerability}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forts</b> {{had become}} evident. <b>The</b> development <b>of</b> artillery went faster than <b>the</b> construction <b>of</b> resistant fortifications. <b>The</b> concept <b>of</b> <b>forts</b> had become redundant. After the First World War <b>the</b> <b>forts</b> were therefore no longer {{seen as a}} defence line, but <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forts</b> would be in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> infantry support.|$|R

5|$|At around 2:50p.m., the B-10 rifles on {{the west}} bank managed to open a breach in the barbed wire {{surrounding}} the fort, and also destroyed other significant targets, such as the observation equipment. Meanwhile, combat engineers were breaching further openings using Bangalore torpedoes, under heavy small arms fire and hand grenades. The battalion's main assault force was crossing at the same time. The main assault force then funneled through the breaches and entered the Israeli trenches. The Israeli command in Northern Sinai kept receiving frantic calls for help from the fort's radio operator, and gunfire could also be heard. The Egyptians captured the southern sector <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fort</b> by 3:05p.m.. Five minutes later, the assault force moved against the northern sector <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fort.</b> Within fifteen minutes, the Egyptians were in control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fort.</b> The power generator inside the fort was destroyed, and all electricity and communication lines leading to the fort were severed. At 3:30p.m., Maj. Gen. Khaled was informed that Lahtzanit had been seized and that Israeli soldiers had been captured. The Israelis reported losing radio contact with the fort at around 4:00p.m.|$|E
5|$|At first, St. Leger {{tried to}} intimidate the fort's {{occupants}} by parading his troops—including the Indians in their war dress—in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fort.</b> When this failed {{he sent a}} truce flag bearing a proclamation authored by General Burgoyne; Gansevoort refused to respond. St. Leger then began siege operations, encamping the regulars and artillery on a low rise north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fort,</b> {{and most of the}} Indians and Loyalists to its south, with a picket line of Indian encampments along the Mohawk River.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the final}} {{surrender}} of the Confederate States of America in 1865, Fort Jackson was abandoned. The lumber used in its construction was promptly salvaged for firewood and construction materials and, {{due to its}} proximity to the Long Bridge, the earthworks were flattened {{in order to provide}} easier access to Long Bridge. In the early 20th century, the fort's site was used for the footings and approaches to several bridges connecting Virginia and Washington. Today, no trace <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fort</b> remains, though the site <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fort</b> is contained within Arlington County's Long Bridge Park, and a National Park Service 2004 survey of the site indicated some archaeological remnants may still remain beneath the park.|$|E
5|$|Fort Bayard was an {{earthwork}} fort {{constructed in}} 1861 northwest of Tenleytown in the District of Columbia {{as part of}} the defenses of Washington, D.C. during the American Civil War. It never faced major opposition during the conflict and was decommissioned following the surrender of Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. Named after Brigadier General George Dashiell Bayard, who was killed at the Battle of Fredericksburg, the site <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fort</b> is in Boundary Park, located at the intersection of River Road and Western Avenue NW in Washington, D.C. and is maintained by the U.S. National Park Service. No trace <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fort</b> remains, though a marker commemorating its existence has been constructed by the Park Service.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} that {{followed}} the completion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fort,</b> numerous telegraph lines were laid between Fort Corcoran, War Department offices in Washington, and other forts in Northern Virginia. According to a July 1863 report on the operations of the military telegraphs in the Army of the Potomac, six telegraph lines ran between Fort Corcoran and Washington, five between Corcoran and Fort Ethan Allen, two between Corcoran and Alexandria, and one each to two observation points southwest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fort.</b> Throughout the remainder of the war, Fort Corcoran remained an important communications center for the entire Arlington Line system of defenses, eventually connecting to over 30miles of telegraph wire at the time of Robert E. Lee's surrender.|$|E

The {{construction of the}} Rochdale Canal through the south western corner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fort</b> in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and the building of viaducts for the Great Northern Railway over the site in the late 19th century, damaged the remains and even destroyed some of the southern half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fort.</b> When the railway viaducts were built, Charles Roeder documented the remains that were uncovered in the process, including parts of the vicus. Mills were all around the site. Castlefield became the south west corner of Manchester city centre. Deansgate, which developed into the main thoroughfare, follows the general line of Roman road to Ribchester.|$|E
5|$|Montgomery and {{his troops}} {{spent the first}} night near the landing area, under light fire from the British guns. The next morning, he ordered Major Timothy Bedel to occupy a {{position}} north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fort,</b> but when Montgomery saw that his men were apprehensive, he chose to lead the mission himself. As Montgomery led his troops, they came upon a fight between British troops and another American party. Montgomery took command of the skirmish and forced the British party back into the fort. Montgomery sent Bedel with a force to entrench themselves about a mile north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fort.</b> Montgomery then put other troops around the fort and began a siege.|$|E
5|$|On 11 June, the French bombarded {{the fort}} from land and sea. The fort's {{garrison}} fought back, and its commander, Rechberg, managed {{to bring in}} more ammunition from Floriana.

The Maltese militia left the fort, reducing its garrison to 80 men. By the end of the day, the ammunition had run out, and parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fort</b> were damaged during the bombardment. When Rechberg and his soldiers attempted to escape, the French captured them, and the fort was in French hands by 13 June.|$|E
