40|$|Abstract — This paper {{addresses}} end-to-end connectivity {{planning and}} call admission control {{for a high}} capacity multi-beam satellite network with <b>on-board</b> cross-connectivity. <b>On-board</b> satellite switching is a technology designed to offer multi-media services, especially in demographically dispersed areas. Nevertheless, full <b>on-board</b> switching techniques are far from maturity. Their implementations have been proven expensive and difficult. There are also high risks involved in launching satellites for the stationary orbit surrounding the earth. As a substitute, a satellite network with <b>on-board</b> cross-connect is devised in this paper. Connectivity planning and call admission control mechanisms associated with such a network are also presented. Simulation studies are conducted to show {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed mechanisms.

40|$|Abstract. The {{extension}} of Internet services to public transport pas-sengers is slowly becoming inevitable. To this end, it is envisaged that high-speed local area networks will be deployed <b>on-board</b> public trans-port vehicles (e. g., buses, trains, ships and planes). The <b>on-board</b> LAN will {{be connected to}} the Internet via an <b>on-board</b> mobile router (MR). The passengers simply connect their devices to the <b>on-board</b> LAN and start enjoying Internet services. The mobility of the entire <b>on-board</b> net-work including the passenger devices is managed transparently by the MR. However, the mobility of the router (and the entire IP subnet) gives rise to several unique challenges for achieving end-to-end resource reservation. In this paper we propose a novel extension for RSVP, which addresses these issues. The proposed <b>On-Board</b> RSVP protocol can effec-tively, transparently, and scalably support end-to-end resource reserva-tion in <b>on-board</b> IP networks. A key feature of <b>On-Board</b> RSVP is that it retains the basic building blocks of the original RSVP, minimising the changes required to existing RSVP infrastructure. The high level of dynamism associated with the QoS resource demand in an <b>on-board</b> com-munication system results in excessive signaling and processing overhead at the MR and the intermediate routers along the end-to-end paths. To address this issue, we propose and discuss two new aggregation schemes for handling the large number of RSVP setup messages: Cardinal Oper-ating Policy (COP) and Temporal Operating Policy (TOP). ...|$|R
