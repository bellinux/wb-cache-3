5|$|There {{has also}} been a general feeling <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>shift</b> in the {{creative}} attribution of Peking-opera works. The performer has traditionally played a large role in the scripting and staging of Peking-opera works. However, perhaps following the lead of the West, Peking opera in recent decades has shifted to a more director and playwright centered model. Performers have striven to introduce innovation in their work while heeding the call for reform from this new upper level of Peking-opera producers.|$|E
5|$|Beebe {{undertook}} {{an expedition}} to Brazil in 1915, {{for the purpose of}} capturing more birds for the zoo. This expedition was an important turning point for Beebe in several ways. Beebe had far more field experience than either of the two others accompanying him on the expedition, G. Inness Hartler and Herbert Atkins, making this his introduction to the role of a mentor. During this expedition, Beebe was also amazed to discover the number and variety of organisms living under a single tree, and pioneered the method of studying a small area of wilderness for an extended amount of time. This expedition marked the beginning <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>shift</b> for Beebe from ornithology to the study of tropical ecosystems.|$|E

5|$|Several {{other factors}} {{complicated}} {{the rise of}} nationalism in the German states. The man-made factors included political rivalries between members of the German confederation, particularly between the Austrians and the Prussians, and socio-economic competition among the commercial and merchant interests and the old land-owning and aristocratic interests. Natural factors included widespread drought in the early 1830s, {{and again in the}} 1840s, and a food crisis in the 1840s. Further complications emerged as a result <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>shift</b> in industrialization and manufacturing; as people sought jobs, they left their villages and small towns to work during the week in the cities, returning for {{a day and a half}} on weekends.|$|E

Five endings are available. Gameplay takes place in two parts: a framing, first-person psychotherapy session, and an over-the-shoulder perspective of Harry's journey through Silent Hill, which is periodically interrupted by the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>shift</b> to an alternate dimension. Answers given to the psychological tests in the therapy session affect various gameplay elements in Harry's journey.|$|E

25|$|In {{the course}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>shift</b> in low positions, the thumb {{of the left}} hand moves up or down {{the neck of the}} {{instrument}} so as to remain in the same position relative to the fingers (though the movement of the thumb may occur slightly before, or slightly after, the movement of the fingers). In such positions, the thumb is often thought of as an 'anchor' whose location defines what position the player is in. In very high positions, the thumb is unable to move with the fingers as the body of the instrument gets in the way. Instead, the thumb works around the neck of the instrument to sit at {{the point at which the}} neck meets the right bout of the body, and remains there while the fingers move between the high positions.|$|E
25|$|Europe's {{cultural}} makeover {{marked a}} period of significant innovation for adoption. Without support from the nobility, the practice gradually shifted toward abandoned children. Abandonment levels rose {{with the fall of}} the empire and many of the foundlings were left on the doorstep of the Church. Initially, the clergy reacted by drafting rules to govern the exposing, selling, and rearing of abandoned children. The Church's innovation, however, was the practice of oblation, whereby children were dedicated to lay life within monastic institutions and reared within a monastery. This created the first system in European history in which abandoned children did not have legal, social, or moral disadvantages. As a result, many of Europe's abandoned and orphaned children became alumni of the Church, which in turn took the role of adopter. Oblation marks the beginning <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>shift</b> toward institutionalization, eventually bringing about the establishment of the foundling hospital and orphanage.|$|E

25|$|Holt came {{to regard}} the {{referendum}} as indicative <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>shift</b> in the national mood. In the following months, he toured Aboriginal communities and consulted with indigenous leaders, including Charles Perkins and Kath Walker. Despite opposition from state governments, he created a new Office of Aboriginal Affairs within the Prime Minister's Department, {{as well as a}} new advisory body called the Council of Aboriginal Affairs (chaired by H. C. Coombs). According to Coombs and Paul Hasluck, Holt had little interest in indigenous affairs before becoming prime minister. Despite this, he brought about a fundamental shift in the way policy was handled, paving the way {{for the federal government to}} assume many of the powers and responsibilities that had previously been the preserve of the states. Indigenous academic Gary Foley has said that Holt's death was a setback for Aboriginal people, as his successors did not show the same commitment to the framework that he established.|$|E
25|$|Here {{are some}} {{illustrations}} {{of the alternative}} accentuation: a word nykštỹs 3 is also commonly said nýkštis 1; zýlė 1 {{is also known as}} zylė̃ 3 in some dialects, but this form is used more narrowly and not shown here. Similarly, a word rýkštė 1 is also known as rykštė̃ 4; this is shown in the table. In a case of šálmas 3 – helmet, the variant šal̃mas 4 is also very common. The alternative forms are most usually present between the 1-3 and 2-4 accentuation patterns, same in the type of an accent. But there are also different cases, for example, rýkštė 1 and rykštė̃ 4. The fourth accentuation paradigm can be result <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>shift</b> of the third paradigm. The shift can happen following nivellation of the two accents, a loss of accentual contrast. In a case of nivellation of the start-firm and end-firm accents the distinction between the 3-4 and 1-2 loses its ground, because in a place of the stress the 1 with the 2, the 3 with the 4 acentuation groups differ only in a few cases.|$|E
25|$|Manipulation of the {{electron}} beam is performed using two physical effects. The interaction of electrons with a magnetic field will cause electrons to move according to the left hand rule, thus allowing for electromagnets to manipulate {{the electron}} beam. The use of magnetic fields allows {{for the formation of}} a magnetic lens of variable focusing power, the lens shape originating due to the distribution of magnetic flux. Additionally, electrostatic fields can cause the electrons to be deflected through a constant angle. Coupling of two deflections in opposing directions with a small intermediate gap allows for the formation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>shift</b> in the beam path, this being used in TEM for beam shifting, subsequently this is extremely important to STEM. From these two effects, as well as the use of an electron imaging system, sufficient control over the beam path is possible for TEM operation. The optical configuration of a TEM can be rapidly changed, unlike that for an optical microscope, as lenses in the beam path can be enabled, have their strength changed, or be disabled entirely simply via rapid electrical switching, the speed of which is limited by effects such as the magnetic hysteresis of the lenses.|$|E
