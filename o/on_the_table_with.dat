5|$|The Crusaders' 2004 {{season began}} with two losses: {{first to the}} Waratahs, then to the Blues. They {{recovered}} to again finish second <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>with</b> seven wins. They played the Stormers at Jade Stadium in their semi-final, and won 27–16. They met the Brumbies at Canberra Stadium in a replay of the 2000 final. The Brumbies dominated in the final, scoring 33 unanswered {{points in the first}} 19 minutes. The Crusaders managed to salvage some pride by narrowing the loss to a 47–38 finish.|$|E
25|$|Quetta Gladiators and Islamabad United {{finished}} the group stage in {{second and third}} positions respectively on the league's points table. Quetta won six out of eight games in the group stage and finished second <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>with</b> 12 points. Quetta batted second in seven of their matches and chased the tournament's highest total, 201 against Lahore Qalandars in their last group match. Islamabad began the tournament with four defeats in their first six matches, but won their last two group stage matches {{to qualify for the}} playoffs in third place with eight points.|$|E
25|$|Yorkshire and Lancashire fought {{throughout}} the season; Lancashire {{were the first}} team to beat Yorkshire, in their ninth game, when hundreds from Reggie Spooner and Johnny Tyldesley helped Lancashire to an innings victory at Old Trafford. Lancashire went unbeaten until July, their fifteenth game, when Surrey overcame them at Aigburth, but Yorkshire were behind <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>with</b> three losses before their match with Yorkshire at Bramall Lane. With Walter Brearley taking seven for 35 in the first innings, Lancashire took a lead of 101, but Wilfred Rhodes turned it around with 74 and four for 49. Lancashire could still have managed to take the title with wins in their final games, but a loss to Gloucestershire at Bristol while Yorkshire avoided defeat meant the title went to Yorkshire.|$|E

500|$|The Crusaders' {{winning run}} {{finally came to}} an end when they were beaten 39–5 by the Blues in the third round of the 2003 Super 12 season. Although their 15-match unbeaten streak had ended, Richie McCaw said of the loss, [...] "...in some ways it was almost a relief. We'd finally been beaten, the run was over, so people could stop talking about it and we could get on with playing it week by week." [...] The Crusaders {{recovered}} to finish second <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>with</b> eight wins. They hosted a semi-final against the Hurricanes, who were coached by Colin Cooper, a former assistant coach for the Crusaders. Despite this inside knowledge of the team by the Wellington coach, the Crusaders won the match 39–16. In the final, the Crusaders met the Blues, another team coached by a former Crusaders assistant coach, Peter Sloane. Hooker Mark Hammett scored two tries to give the Crusaders a 10–6 lead at half-time. The Blues hit back to lead 21–10 with ten minutes to go. The Crusaders managed another converted try, but it was not enough, and the Blues won 21–17.|$|E
500|$|The album's cover artwork {{features}} {{a photo of}} Donald Fagen as a disc jockey, wearing a collared shirt and tie, speaking into a RCA 77DX microphone. In front of him is a turntable (16inch '50s model, with a [...] tonearm), an ashtray, and a pack of Chesterfield King cigarettes. Visible <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>with</b> the record player, is {{the cover of the}} 1958 jazz album Sonny Rollins and the Contemporary Leaders (one of Fagen's favorite albums). On the wall behind is a large clock, indicating that the time is 4:09. An advertisement in Billboard shortly before the album's release described the album cover: [...] "At 4:09 a.m., silence and darkness have taken hold of the city. The only sound is the voice of The Nightfly". Fagen appeared on the album cover despite his reclusive nature. [...] "It was an autobiographical album so it seemed like I might as well go public with it," [...] he said. The cover was shot in Fagen's apartment in the Upper East Side of Manhattan by photographer James Hamilton. Two shoots were arranged because in the first, the RCA microphone was facing the wrong direction. Gale Sasson and Vern Yenor are credited with the cover's set design.|$|E

2500|$|After {{a chance}} meeting with Merelli close to La Scala, the {{impresario}} {{gave him a}} copy of Temistocle Solera's libretto which had been rejected by the composer Otto Nicolai. Verdi describes how he took it home, and threw [...] "it <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>with</b> an almost violent gesture....

2500|$|In 2012, 16 {{years after}} her debut appearance, Kasumi was {{redesigned}} to look less cartoon-like and more realistic with a [...] "grown up" [...] appearance in DOA5. The game's art director Yuta Saito said, [...] "From DOA4 we wanted to evolve the characters in a slightly realistic direction. The most difficult, and you don't have to ask, is Kasumi. Kasumi {{is the face of}} DOA and the eternal heroine. And for such a popular character like Kasumi, to change her form we really needed a lot of courage and it really was a big challenge. But if we didn't do that, we couldn't make DOA5 and we wouldn't be able to show you anything." [...] Producer Yasuke Hayashi said the processn of remodeling Kasumi has sparked most disputes in the development team, especially since she is [...] "a character that is not so much out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> <b>with</b> [...] hidden feelings, and it's been difficult to express such a 'hidden look'." [...] GamesRadar noted that [...] "the manga influences on her facial featureswhile still apparenthave been scaled right back nd her boobs seem less ludicrously unmanageable." [...] Itagaki, who has left Team Ninja in 2008, said in 2014: [...] "Straightly speakin’, my daughter was totally ruined, spoiled. I can’t/shouldn’t avert my eyes from that fact. Many DOA fans here are crying, I will do something for DOA after I finished Devil's Third." ...|$|E

60|$|A {{suspended}} {{interest and}} a prevalent absence of mind, were perhaps observed by the spies who looked {{in at the}} wine-shop, as they looked in at every place, high and low, from the king's palace to the criminal's gaol.
