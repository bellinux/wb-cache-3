40|$|Optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) {{has proven}} to be able to provide three-dimensional (3 D) volumetric images of scattering biological tissues for in vivo medical diagnostics. Unlike conventional optical microscopy, its depth-resolving ability (axial resolution) is exclusively determined by the laser source and therefore invariant over the full imaging depth. In contrast, its transverse resolution is determined by the objective's numerical aperture and the wavelength which is only approximately maintained over twice the Rayleigh range. However, the prevailing laser sources for OCT allow image depths of more than 5 mm which is considerably longer than the Rayleigh range. This limits high transverse resolution imaging with OCT. Previously, we reported a novel method to extend the depth-of-focus (DOF) of OCT imaging in Mo et al. [Opt. Express 21, 10048 (2013) ]. The approach is to create three different <b>optical</b> <b>apertures</b> via pupil segmentation with an annular phase plate. These three <b>optical</b> <b>apertures</b> produce three OCT images from the same sample, which are encoded to different depth positions in a single OCT B-scan. This allows for correcting the defocus-induced curvature of wave front in the pupil so as to improve the focus. As a consequence, the three images originating from those three <b>optical</b> <b>apertures</b> can be used to reconstruct a new image with an extended DOF. In this study, we successfully applied this method {{for the first time to}} both an artificial phantom and biological tissues over a four times larger depth range. The results demonstrate a significant DOF improvement, paving the way for 3 D high resolution OCT imaging beyond the conventional Rayleigh range...|$|R

40|$|The {{potential}} {{development of}} large aperture groundbased "photon bucket" optical receivers for deep space communications, with acceptable performance even when pointing {{close to the}} sun, is receiving considerable attention. Sunlight scattered by the atmosphere becomes significant at micron wavelengths when pointing to a few degrees from the sun, even with the narrowest bandwidth optical filters. In addition, high quality <b>optical</b> <b>apertures</b> in the 10 - 30 meter range are costly and difficult to build with accurate surfaces to ensure narrow fields-of-view (FOV). One approach currently under consideration is to polish the aluminum reflector panels of large 34 -meter microwave antennas to high reflectance, and accept the relatively large FOV generated by state-of-the-art polished aluminum panels with rms surface accuracies {{on the order of}} a few microns, corresponding to several-hundred micro-radian FOV, hence generating centimeter-diameter focused spots at the Cassegrain focus of 34 -meter antennas. Assuming pulse-position modulation (PPM) and Poisson-distributed photon-counting detection, a "polished panel" photon-bucket receiver with large FOV will collect hundreds of background photons per PPM slot, along with comparable signal photons due to its large aperture. It is demonstrated that communications performance in terms of PPM symbol-error probability in high-background high-signal environments depends more strongly on signal than on background photons, implying that large increases in background energy can be compensated by a disproportionally small increase in signal energy. This surprising result suggests that large <b>optical</b> <b>apertures</b> with relatively poor surface quality may nevertheless provide acceptable performance for deep-space optical communications, potentially enabling the construction of cost-effective hybrid RF/optical receivers in the future...|$|R

Implemented {{in the form of a}} proposed 50 - 500 m Exo-Earth Discoverer array in space, the principle can serve to detect Earth-like exo-planets in the infra-red. It can also provide images of faint nebulosity near stars, active galactic nuclei and quasars.

5000|$|While space-based coronagraphs such as LASCO {{avoid the}} sky {{brightness}} problem, they face design challenges in stray light management under the stringent {{size and weight}} requirements of space flight. Any sharp edge (such as {{the edge of an}} occulting disk or <b>optical</b> <b>aperture)</b> causes Fresnel diffraction of incoming light around the edge, which means that the smaller instruments that one would want on a satellite unavoidably leak more light than larger ones would. The LASCO C-3 coronagraph uses both an external occulter (which casts shadow on the instrument) and an internal occulter (which blocks stray light that is Fresnel-diffracted around the external occulter) to reduce this [...] "leakage", and a complicated system of baffles to eliminate stray light scattering off the internal surfaces of the instrument itself.|$|E
