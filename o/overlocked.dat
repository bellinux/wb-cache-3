50|$|To {{maximize}} yield, most jeans {{are made}} from wide denim and have a straight outseam that utilizes the full width of the fabric, including the edges. Selvedge denim {{has come to be}} associated with premium quality jeans, which show the finished edges from the loom rather than the <b>overlocked</b> edges that are shown on other jeans.|$|E
5000|$|Usually a {{flat bed}} sheet is <b>overlocked</b> {{around the edges}} to form four seams. One of the seams is wider than the other three and helps with {{orienting}} the sheet correctly on the mattress. The wider seam goes at the head end of the mattress. Sometimes the sides do not have seams, but are finished with the selvedge only. When placing a flat sheet on a bed, the manufacturer has designed the printed side to be softer, and thus it {{should be placed on}} the bed printed side [...] "down". When folding back the covers, this also allows the printed side to show, for aesthetic purposes. When one makes a bed, the patterned or monogrammed side of the top sheet is placed facing down and then the top edge is folded towards the foot of the bed, exposing the design.|$|E
30|$|The {{construction}} {{method that}} connected a lining fabric {{to the outer}} shell fabric was separate over-locking sewing steps (the front lining was <b>overlocked</b> to front outer shell, the back was <b>overlocked</b> to the back outer shell), then all were sewn together (84.6 %, 11 out of 13). The important factors {{on the length of}} the lining pattern were “the comfortableness on the knee area” (53.8 %, 7 out of 13) and “product cost by fabric consumption” (30.8 %, 4 out of 13).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Overlock,</b> {{also known}} as [...] "serging" [...] or [...] "serger stitch", can be formed with one to four threads, one or two needles, {{and one or two}} loopers. <b>Overlock</b> sewing {{machines}} are usually equipped with knives that trim or create the edge immediately in front of the stitch formation. Household and industrial <b>overlock</b> machines are commonly used for garment seams in knit or stretchy fabrics, for garment seams where the fabric is light enough that the seam {{does not need to be}} pressed open, and for protecting edges against raveling. Machines using two to four threads are most common, and frequently one machine can be configured for several varieties of <b>overlock</b> stitch. <b>Overlock</b> machines with five or more threads usually make both a chainstitch with one needle and one looper, and an <b>overlock</b> stitch with the remaining needles and loopers. This combination is known as a [...] "safety stitch". A similar machine used for stretch fabrics is called a mock safety.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Overlocking</b> is also {{referred}} to as [...] "overedging", [...] "merrowing", or [...] "serging". Though [...] "serging” technically refers to <b>overlocking</b> with cutters, in practice the four terms are used interchangeably.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Overlock</b> {{stitching}} {{was invented}} by the Merrow Machine Company in 1881.J. Makens Merrow and his son Joseph Merrow, who owned a knitting mill established in Connecticut in 1838, developed a number of technological advancements {{to be used in}} the mill’s operations. Merrow's first patent was a machine for crochet stitching, and the Merrow Machine Company still produces crochet machines based on this original model. This technology was a starting point for the development of the <b>overlock</b> machine, patented by Joseph Merrow in 1889. Unlike standard lockstitching, which uses a bobbin, <b>overlock</b> sewing machines utilize loopers to create thread loops for the needle to pass through, in a manner similar to crocheting. Merrow's original three-thread overedge sewing machine is the forerunner of contemporary <b>overlocking</b> machines. Over time, the Merrow Machine Company pioneered the design of new machines to create a variety of <b>overlock</b> stitches, such as two- and four-thread machines, the one-thread butted seam, and the cutterless emblem edger.|$|R

40|$|The {{field of}} {{corporate}} social responsibility (CSR) among {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} (SMEs) is often <b>overlocked</b> because their involvement in CSR activities is often on less formalised business. However, recent trends show that there is growth in CSR activities among SMEs in Malaysia. Hence, the purpose of this is to identify types of CSR activities undertaken by manufacturing SMEs in Malaysia. A total oa 1608 survey questionnaire were designed and distributed to SME owner-managers and a total of 203 SMEs responded yielding a response rate of 12. 6 %. The one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to provide evidence of any between-group differences among SMEs (micro, small and medium) on CSR practices. The results indicated that the most frequently implemented CSR among SMEs in Malaysia are market-oriented activities and market-oriented activies. The authority may promote CSR activities by putting in place rules and regulations to monitor CSR implementation among SMEs. Government and businesses can encourage SMEs to engaged in CSR activities by providing training and sharing of best practices and rewards for socially responsible SMEs...|$|E
5000|$|An <b>overlock</b> {{is a kind}} of stitch that sews {{over the}} edge of one or two pieces of cloth for edging, hemming, or seaming. Usually an <b>overlock</b> sewing machine will cut the edges of the cloth as they are fed through (such {{machines}} being called [...] "sergers" [...] in North America), though some are made without cutters. The inclusion of automated cutters allows <b>overlock</b> machines to create finished seams easily and quickly. An <b>overlock</b> sewing machine differs from a lockstitch sewing machine in that it uses loopers fed by multiple thread cones rather than a bobbin. Loopers serve to create thread loops that pass from the needle thread to the edges of the fabric so that the edges of the fabric are contained within the seam.|$|R
50|$|<b>Overlock</b> sewing {{machines}} usually run at high speeds, from 1000 to over 9000 rpm, {{and most are}} used in industry for edging, hemming and seaming a variety of fabrics and products. <b>Overlock</b> stitches are extremely versatile, {{as they can be}} used for decoration, reinforcement, or construction.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Overlock</b> {{stitches}} {{are classified}} {{in a number}} of ways. The most basic classification is by the number of threads used in the stitch.

Traditional home sewing techniques for finishing plain seams include trimming with pinking shears, oversewing with a zig-zag stitch, and hand or machine overcasting.|$|R

50|$|Sometime after nylon-backed {{neoprene}} appeared, {{the blind}} stitch method was developed.

This is similar to the <b>overlock</b> stitching used for teeshirts and other garments made from knitted fabrics.|$|R
