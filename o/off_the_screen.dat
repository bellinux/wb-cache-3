5|$|The player {{controls}} {{a yellow}} knight riding a flying ostrich or stork, from a third-person perspective. Using the two-way directional joystick and the button for flapping the ostrich's wings, the player flies the knight amidst the floating rock platforms and above pools of lava; when maneuvering <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> to either side, the player will continue its path reappearing {{from the opposite}} side. The {{rate at which the}} player repeatedly presses the button causes the ostrich to fly upward, hover, or slowly descend.|$|E
5|$|While both {{settings}} seem {{to suggest}} that Madonna's characters live in the barrio and may be Latina themselves, the portrayal of Madonna in the dancing scenes (lush, flashy, colorful) contrasts with the Latinos in the street (sparsely worn out dresses). She dances around and even flirts but does not get really involved with them as the last scene shows Madonna dancing <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b> The video symbolizes the link between Latino culture and Catholicism. The two characters symbolize the restrained and passionate sides of Catholicism, which author Rettenmund has described as Madonna's take on the religion.|$|E

5|$|Believing {{their first}} {{attempts}} {{to be too}} derivative, the developers held brain storming sessions. During a session, they agreed that one of Asteroidss favorable elements was its wrapping effect. They felt a game that allowed the player to fly <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> would be exciting, and decided to create a game world larger than the screen displayed. The game's environment was made longer than the screen, with the visible area scrolling horizontally. Expanding on the idea, they envisioned a version of Space Invaders rotated 90degrees. By changing the orientation of Space Invaders design, the ship moved up and down while flying horizontally. Large asteroids, an element from Asteroids, were then added to the game world, but were later removed because the staff felt it lacked enjoyment. Jarvis intended the screen to scroll only from left to right; fellow Williams employee Steve Ritchie, however, convinced him the game {{should be able to}} scroll in either direction.|$|E
5|$|Following its predecessors, Brawl uses {{a battle}} system {{unlike that of}} typical {{fighting}} games. Players can choose from a large selection of characters, each attempting to knock their opponents <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> as they fight on various stages. The characters in Brawl include most of the same ones as the predecessors, such as the well-known Mario and Pikachu. Instead of using traditional health bars that start at a maximum value and lose value, Brawl characters start the game with 0%; the value rises as they take damage and may rise over 100% {{to a maximum of}} 999%. As a character's percentage increases, the character flies further back when hit. When a character is knocked beyond a stage's boundary and disappears from the screen, the character loses either a life, a point, or coins, depending on the mode of play. Brawl includes a function which allows players to create profiles with personalized button configurations for each control method along with their chosen username.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} playable {{characters}} in Brawl {{has grown from}} that in Super Smash Bros. Melee, although a few characters from Melee were cut in Brawl. Brawl is the first game in the series to have playable third-party characters. Like that of its predecessors, the object of Brawl is to knock an opponent <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b> It is a departure from traditional fighting games, notably in its simplified move commands and emphasis on ring outs over knockouts. It includes a more extensive single-player mode than its predecessors, known as the Subspace Emissary (SSE). This mode is a plot-driven, side-scrolling beat 'em up featuring computer-generated cut scenes and a selection of playable characters. Brawl also supports multiplayer battles with up to four combatants, and is {{the first game of}} its franchise to feature online battles via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. The game is unique, in that it may be played with four different controllers, including the Wii Remote, Wii Remote with Nunchuk, GameCube controller, and Classic Controller, simultaneously.|$|E

5|$|Donkey Kong Country is a {{platform}} game where players must complete 40 different side-scrolling levels (or 41 in the Game Boy Color version) and recover the Kongs' banana hoard, {{which has been}} stolen by the Kremlings. Each level is uniquely themed and consists of varying tasks such as swimming, riding in mine carts, launching out of barrel cannons, or swinging from vine to vine. The player begins {{with a minimum of}} six lives. Players lose a life if they get hit by any enemy or fall <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b> To defeat an enemy, players can either execute a roll, jump or hand slap (a move only usable by Donkey Kong). However, some enemies cannot be taken down in this manner, so the player must throw a barrel or use the assistance of an animal. Enemies vary in difficulty, usually becoming tougher to take down as the game progresses. When the player has lost all their lives, the game is over. However, the player can gain additional lives by collecting items scattered throughout the levels, including bananas, golden letters that spell out K–O–N–G, extra life balloons, and golden animal tokens that lead to bonus levels. There are also many secret passages that can lead to bonus games where the player can earn additional lives or other items, as well as gain possible shortcuts through the level.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} the rolling HP meter began with pachinko balls that would drop balls <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> upon being hit. This did not work as well for {{characters}} with high health. Instead, around 1990, they chose an odometer-style hit points counter. The bicycle {{was one of the}} harder elements to implement—it used controls similar to a tank before it was tweaked. Iwata felt that the Ape programmers were particularly willing to tackle such challenges. The programmers also found difficulty implementing the in-game delivery service, where the delivery person had to navigate around obstacles to reach the player. They thought it would be funny to have the delivery person run through obstacles in a hurry on his way off-screen. The unusual maps laid out with diagonal streets in oblique projection required extra attention from the artists. Itoi specifically chose against having an overworld map, and didn't want to artificially distinguish between towns and other areas. Instead, he worked to make each town unique. His own favorite town was Threed, though it was Summers before then.|$|E
5|$|Micro Machines 2: Turbo Tournament adds new modes: Leagues, Time Trials, Single Race, and Tournaments. In League mode, players {{compete for}} points in divisions. Seasons consist of four races. Players {{with the most}} points {{at the end of}} the season are {{promoted}} to the next division, and players with the least are relegated. Time Trial mode is where players race alone (although some tracks have a Shadow Racer representing the best time) for the best time, or to practise driving. Single Race is where players compete in a series of rounds in which vehicles begin at the centre of the scree, and get further apart as the race progresses. If a vehicle goes <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen,</b> they are out of the race unless they have travelled the furthest. The game ends when only one player remains. Tournaments are a fixed race series played in the same manner as Single Races. The winner is the first player to win a set number of times. There are two multiplayer-only modes: Knockout and Share Games. Knockout involves a series of races similar to tournament mode, with winners progressing to the next round and losers knocked out. Share Games is similar to Single Race, but cars are coloured according to team, with each team's finishing position depending on which member performs the best. The Mega Drive J-Cart provides two controller ports, enabling up to eight players in multiplayer by two players sharing the controllers. The Game Gear version retains the console sharing (two player sharing one console) function of the original, and two units can be linked.|$|E

50|$|With {{video games}} that use side-scrolling, often <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> will scroll forward {{following}} {{the speed and}} direction of the player character, and can also scroll backwards to previously visited parts of a stage. In other games or stages <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> will follow <b>the</b> player character but only scroll forwards, not backwards, so once something has passed <b>off</b> <b>the</b> back of <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> it can no longer be visited. Some games have stages where <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> scrolls forward by itself at a steady rate, and the player must keep up with <b>the</b> <b>screen,</b> attempting to avoid obstacles and collect things before they pass <b>off</b> <b>screen.</b> <b>The</b> <b>screen</b> in shoot 'em ups such as R-type often side-scrolls by itself in such a way.

500|$|In {{his normal}} state, Mario can {{tolerate}} one hit from an enemy and defeat {{most of the}} foes with a stomp.

500|$|Described as a [...] "shoot-and-lift-up puzzle" [...] game, Meteos core {{gameplay}} mechanic has players move colored blocks (known as meteos) {{that fall}} {{from the top of}} the screen with the Nintendo DS stylus. Aligning three (or more) meteos of the same color horizontally or vertically cause them to ignite and rise; if they (or any blocks above them) move <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen,</b> they are removed from the playing area. The speed and frequency of falling meteos can be adjusted with the [...] "Speeder" [...] gauge. Power-ups can be used to help or hinder the player or opponents; one example is a giant hammer which can destroy multiple meteos with a few swings. Each meteo sent out of the playing field is cached in a virtual bank, from which they can be unlock new planets, aliens, and sounds. The player can play as one of thirty-two aliens and their respective planets. Each planet has its own unique gravitational pull that affects how the meteos launch.|$|E
500|$|Nolan {{was born}} in London. His English father, Brendan James Nolan, was an {{advertising}} executive, and his American mother, Christina (née Jensen), worked as a flight attendant and an English teacher. His childhood was split between London and Evanston, Illinois, and he has both British and US citizenship. He has an older brother, Matthew Francis Nolan, a convicted criminal, and a younger brother, Jonathan. He began making films at age seven, borrowing his father's Super 8 camera and shooting short films with his action figures. Growing up, Nolan was particularly influenced by Star Wars (1977), and around the age of eight, he made a stop motion animation homage called Space Wars. His uncle who worked at NASA, building guidance systems for the Apollo rockets, sent him some launch footage: [...] "I re-filmed them <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> and cut them in, thinking no-one would notice," [...] Nolan later remarked.
