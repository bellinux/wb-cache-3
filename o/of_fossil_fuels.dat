40|$|Burning <b>of</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> is {{the main}} reason behind manmade climate change. By burning the carbon content, carbon dioxide is {{produced}} and quickly spreads in the global atmosphere. This increases the greenhouse effect, thereby changing the earth’s energy balance. Concern over the negative consequences of climate change has led to a vast array of policy measures aimed at reducing the use <b>of</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel.</b> This chapter examines some aspects of these policies. It discusses the arguments for taxes and quantity restrictions on CO 2 -emitting activities, and especially on the burning <b>of</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel,</b> as well as policies to subsidise substitutes for these activities, particularly the use and development of technologies producing non-fossil based “green energy”. ...|$|R
5|$|Large {{deposits}} <b>of</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> {{are obtained}} from Earth's crust, consisting of coal, petroleum, and natural gas. These deposits {{are used by}} humans both for energy production and as feedstock for chemical production. Mineral ore bodies have also been formed within the crust {{through a process of}} ore genesis, resulting from actions of magmatism, erosion, and plate tectonics. These bodies form concentrated sources for many metals and other useful elements.|$|E

Fine particulates (PM2.5) and sulfate aerosols, which may be released in traffic exhaust fumes, are associated with slightly increased risk. For nitrogen dioxide, an incremental increase of 10 parts per billion increases the risk of lung cancer by 14%. Outdoor air pollution is estimated to account for 1–2% of lung cancers.|$|E

5|$|The phrase {{acid rain}} {{was first used}} by Scottish chemist Robert Augus Smith in 1852. The pH of rain varies, {{especially}} due to its origin. On America's East Coast, rain that {{is derived from the}} Atlantic Ocean typically has a pH of 5.0-5.6; rain that comes across the continental from the west has a pH of 3.8-4.8; and local thunderstorms can have a pH as low as 2.0. Rain becomes acidic primarily due to the presence of two strong acids, sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and nitric acid (HNO3). Sulfuric acid is derived from natural sources such as volcanoes, and wetlands (sulfate reducing bacteria); and anthropogenic sources such as the combustion <b>of</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels,</b> and mining where H2S is present. Nitric acid is produced by natural sources such as lightning, soil bacteria, and natural fires; while also produced anthropogenically by the combustion <b>of</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> and from power plants. In the past 20 years the concentrations of nitric and sulfuric acid has decreased in presence of rainwater, which {{may be due to the}} significant increase in ammonium (most likely as ammonia from livestock production), which acts as a buffer in acid rain and raises the pH.|$|E
5|$|While many of {{the costs}} <b>of</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> are well known, others (pollution related health problems, {{environmental}} degradation, the impact on national security from relying on foreign energy sources) are indirect and difficult to calculate. These are traditionally external to the pricing system, and are thus {{often referred to as}} externalities. A corrective pricing mechanism, such as a carbon tax, could lead to renewable energy, such as solar thermal power, becoming cheaper to the consumer than fossil fuel based energy.|$|E

5|$|As large {{consumers}} <b>of</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels,</b> First World countries {{drew attention}} to environmental pollution. The Kyoto Protocol is a treaty {{that is based on}} the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which was finalized in 1992 at the Earth Summit in Rio. It proposed to place the burden of protecting the climate on the United States and other First World countries. Countries that were considered to be developing, such as China and India, were not required to approve the treaty because they were more concerned that restricting emissions would further restrain their development.|$|E

There are currently plans to develop all types of renewable energy, which is strongly encouraged by the Russian government. Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has called for renewable energy to have a larger share of Russia's energy output, and has taken steps to promote the development of renewable energy in Russia since 2008.|$|E

His last book before writing The Empathic Civilization was The European Dream, published in 2004, comparing the American Dream with the values expressed by Europeans in the post-industrial economy.
