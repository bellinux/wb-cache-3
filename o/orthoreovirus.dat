25|$|<b>Orthoreovirus</b> is a genus of viruses, in {{the family}} Reoviridae, in the {{subfamily}} Spinareovirinae. Vertebrates serve as natural hosts. There are currently five species in this genus including the type species mammalian <b>orthoreovirus.</b> Diseases associated with this genus include mild upper respiratory tract disease, gastroenteritis, and biliary atresia. Mammalian <b>orthoreovirus</b> type 3 (strain dearing-T3D) induces cell death preferentially in transformed cells and therefore displays inherent oncolytic properties.|$|E
25|$|Members of the <b>Orthoreovirus</b> genus {{have been}} known to cause {{apoptosis}} in host cells, and have thus been studied fairly extensively for this very purpose. Mammalian orthoreoviruses induce apoptosis via the activation of several death receptors—TNFR, TRAIL, and Fas—while avian <b>orthoreovirus</b> has been found to use the up-regulation of p53 to induce apoptosis. Both of these strains have also been found to be involved in G2/M cell cycle arrest. The avian <b>orthoreovirus</b> has also been proven to promote autophagy of the host which could contribute to disease in a similar manner as apoptosis. The inhibition of the innate immune response has also been seen in mammalian and avian orthoreoviruses. Other strains of the orthoreoviruses have not been studied as frequently as mammalian and avian strains resulting in a lack of understanding in the pathophysiology of those strains, though it can be assumed they act in similar ways.|$|E
25|$|<b>Orthoreovirus</b> {{is part of}} {{the family}} known as Reoviridae. Its genome is {{composed}} of segmented double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), thus it is classified as a group III virus according to the Baltimore classification system of viruses. This family of viruses is taxonomically classified into 12 distinct genera. These genera are sorted out taking into account the number of dsRNA genomes. The <b>Orthoreovirus</b> genus has 10 segments that have been isolated from a large range of hosts including mammals, birds, and reptiles. These genera are further divided into two phenotypic groups: fusogenic and non-fusogenic. The way that they are determined to belong to a specific group is if the virus is able to cause multinucleated cells known as syncytial cells. According to this classification, mammalian orthoreoviruses (MRV) are known to be non-fusogenic, meaning it does not produce syncytia, while other members of this genus are fusogenic, such as avian orthoreoviruses (ARV), baboon orthoreoviruses (BRV), reptilian orhtoreoviruses (RRV).|$|E
50|$|The NBV has a {{morphology}} {{similar to}} other <b>orthoreoviruses</b> but has a much more rapid cytopathic effect.|$|R
25|$|These <b>orthoreoviruses</b> {{were first}} {{isolated}} in 1987 from a moribund python (Python regius) {{and was found}} to cause high levels of syncytium formation but did not cause hemagglutination in human red blood cells (RBCs). In reptiles the virus has been found widely but is not necessarily associated with any specific disease. The virus {{has been found to}} have 2 ORFs encoding for p14, a cell fusion protein and σC. RRVs belong to the fusogenic subgroup and has only recently been classified as a distinct subgroup of <b>orthoreoviruses.</b>|$|R
40|$|Baboon {{reovirus}} (BRV) is {{a member}} of the fusogenic subgroup of <b>orthoreoviruses.</b> Unlike most other members of its genus, BRV lacks S-segment coding sequences for the outer fiber protein that binds to cell surface receptors. It shares this lack with aquareoviruses, which constitute a related genus and are also fusogenic. We used electron cryomicroscopy and three-dimensional image reconstruction to determine the BRV virion structure at 9. 0 -Å resolution. The results show that BRV lacks a protruding fiber at its icosahedral 5 -fold axes or elsewhere. The results also show that BRV is like nonfusogenic mammalian and fusogenic avian <b>orthoreoviruses</b> in having 150 copies of the core clamp protein, not 120 as in aquareoviruses. On the other hand, there are no hub-and-spoke complexes attributable to the outer shell protein in the P 2 and P 3 solvent channels of BRV, which makes BRV like fusogenic avian <b>orthoreoviruses</b> and aquareoviruses but unlike nonfusogenic mammalian <b>orthoreoviruses.</b> The outermost “flap ” domains of the BRV core turret protein appear capable of conformational variability within the virion, a trait previously unseen among other ortho-and aquareoviruses. New cDNA sequence determinations for the BRV L 1 and M 2 genome segments, encoding the core turret and outer shell proteins, were helpful for interpreting the structural features of those proteins. Based on these findings, we conclude that the evolution of ortho- and aquareoviruses has included a series of discrete gains or losses of particular components, several of which cross taxonomic boundaries. Gain or los...|$|R
25|$|The syncytia {{inducing}} {{capabilities of}} {{this class of}} orthoreoviruses combined with their association to encephalitis in baboons, distinguish them from other mammalian orthoreoviruses. While these viruses have the signature <b>Orthoreovirus</b> genome, {{they have not been}} found to encode for a cell attachment protein (σC), they do not encode any S-class genome segments, and are organized differently from the other species of fusogenic orthoreoviruses. The BRV genome contains 2 ORFs and contains two proteins, p15 and p16, that are not homologous to known viral or cellular proteins; however, p15 {{has been found to be}} the cell fusion protein in BRV.|$|E
25|$|Mammalian <b>orthoreovirus</b> {{does not}} really cause a {{significant}} disease in humans. Even though the virus is fairly common, the infection produced is either asymptomatic or causes a mild disease which is self-limiting in the gastrointestinal tract and respiratory region for children and infants. Symptoms are similar to what a person might have when they have the common cold, such as a low-grade fever and pharyngitits. However, in other animals such as baboons and reptiles, other known orthoreoviruses fusogenic strains can cause more serious illness. In baboons it can cause neurological illness while in reptiles {{it can be the}} cause of pneumonia. In birds this virus may even cause death.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{relevant}} uses for the mammalian orthoreoviruses are the manipulation of their oncolytic properties for their use in cancer treatments. This particular use of reoviruses was discovered in 1995 by Dr Patrick Lee who discovered these viruses could kill those cells that contained an over-activated Ras pathway, often a hallmark of cancerous cells. These viruses are particularly ideal for these sort of therapies because they are self-limiting while simultaneously harnessing the ability to induce apoptosis in tumor cells exclusively. One of the more widely used strains for these anti-cancer clinical trials is the serotype 3 dearing strain, Resolysin, used in phase I-III trials. A variety of cancers have been treated with this therapy, either alone or in tandem with others, including multiple myeloma, ovarian epithelial, and pancreatic cancers. A recent clinical trial demonstrated that mammalian <b>orthoreovirus</b> was effective in inducing apoptosis in hypoxic prostate tumor cells with hopes of success in clinical trials.|$|E
40|$|AbstractAll {{characterized}} <b>orthoreoviruses</b> encode {{a characteristic}} spike-like protein on their polycistronic S 1 genome segments that mediates virus cell attachment. In {{the case of}} baboon reovirus (BRV), the polycistronic S-class genome segment corresponds to the smallest S 4 segment. We recently determined that the 5 ′-proximal open reading frame (ORF) of the bicistronic S 4 segment encodes a nonstructural protein responsible for virus-induced syncytium formation. Current analysis indicates that the p 16 protein encoded by the 3 ′-proximal ORF of the BRV S 4 genome segment shows no sequence similarity to any other protein encoded by the <b>orthoreoviruses,</b> including the well-characterized σ 1 /σC reovirus cell attachment protein. Results indicate that p 16 is a BRV-specific nonstructural protein that is not required for virus infection in cell culture and {{is not involved in}} viral cell attachment. In conjunction with previous studies of the BRV S 1, S 2, and S 3 genome segments, the current results indicate that, unlike all other <b>orthoreoviruses,</b> BRV does not encode a cell attachment protein in its S-class genome segments. Furthermore, cell binding and infectivity studies suggested BRV may not utilize a functional homolog of the prototypical reovirus σ 1 /σC cell receptor-binding protein to mediate endocytic uptake by cells...|$|R
40|$|Nelson Bay <b>orthoreoviruses</b> (NBVs) {{are members}} of the fusogenic <b>orthoreoviruses</b> and possess 10 -segmented {{double-stranded}} RNA genomes. NBV was first isolated from a fruit bat in Australia more than 40 years ago, but it was not associated with any disease. However, several NBV strains have been recently identified as causative agents for respiratory tract infections in humans. Isolation of these pathogenic bat reoviruses from patients suggests that NBVs have evolved to propagate in humans in the form of zoonosis. To date, no strategy has been developed to rescue infectious viruses from cloned cDNA for any member of the fusogenic <b>orthoreoviruses.</b> In this study, we report the development of a plasmid-based reverse genetics system free of helper viruses and independent of any selection for NBV isolated from humans with acute respiratory infection. cDNAs corresponding to each of the 10 full-length RNA gene segments of NBV were cotransfected into culture cells expressing T 7 RNA polymerase, and viable NBV was isolated using a plaque assay. The growth kinetics and cell-to-cell fusion activity of recombinant strains, rescued using the reverse genetics system, were indistinguishable from those of native strains. We used the reverse genetics system to generate viruses deficient in the cell attachment protein σC to define the biological function of this protein in the viral life cycle. Our results with σC-deficient viruses demonstrated that σC is dispensable for cell attachment in several cell lines, including murine fibroblast L 929 cells but not in human lung epithelial A 549 cells, and plays a critical role in viral pathogenesis. We also used the system to rescue a virus that expresses a yellow fluorescent protein. The reverse genetics system developed in this study can be applied to study the propagation and pathogenesis of pathogenic NBVs and in the generation of recombinant NBVs for future vaccines and therapeutics...|$|R
40|$|The Reoviridae are {{a family}} of viruses with a non-enveloped {{icosahedral}} capsid and a segmented double-stranded RNA genome. Prototypes of the mammalian <b>Orthoreoviruses</b> have been isolated from human respiratory and enteric tracts and are not associated with human disease. One of these, human reovirus type 3 Dearing (T 3 D), usually serves {{as a model for}} the family. In the last decade the mammalian <b>Orthoreoviruses,</b> especially T 3 D, have been evaluated as oncolytic agents in experimental cancer therapy. This is based on the observation that reoviruses induce cell death in tumor cells, but not in healthy non-transformed cells. Cancer cells have developed all kinds of strategies to escape control of normal regulators in tissue. If the strategy involves evading cell death pathways on which the reovirus relies on for replication or if the expression of the canonical receptor is diminished, the effect of the therapy is severely reduced. To boost the oncolytic potency of reoviruses in tumor cells that resist reovirus infection and replication, we used two strategies; 1) a bioselection procedure to select for reoviurses that can replicate in cells lacking the receptor and 2) genetic modification to insert small transgenes in one of the reovirus dsRNA segments (S 1) ...|$|R
2500|$|This <b>orthoreovirus</b> {{has been}} {{extracted}} from the heart blood of a fruit bat (Pteropus policephalus) in Australia with different viruses being isolated from different species, such as the flying fox (Pteropus hypomelanus) which {{have been found to}} cause respiratory infections in humans in Southeast Asia. [...] The Nelson Bay <b>Orthoreovirus,</b> like the Avian <b>orthoreovirus,</b> has 3 open reading frames (ORFs) which encode for three different proteins: P10 which promotes syncytia formation, P17, and σC involved in cell attachment.|$|E
2500|$|The Avian <b>Orthoreovirus</b> has {{a similar}} {{structure}} compared to the Mammalian <b>Orthoreovirus</b> with the differences mainly existing in the proteins that it encodes: 10 [...] structural proteins and 4 non-structural proteins. However, these proteins have not been studied in depth, so there is some skepticism regarding their exact functions. The pathogenesis of this virus has been studied {{in an attempt to}} determine the pathway of inducing apoptosis. Avian <b>orthoreovirus</b> induces apoptosis by what has been proposed as an upregulation of p53 and Bax, a mitochondria-mediated pathway. P17 has also been found {{to play a role in}} growth retardation involved in the p53 pathway. Avian Orthoreoviruses have been found to cause diseases in poultry including chronic respiratory disease, malabsorption syndrome, and arthritis representing economic losses that make this virus particularly important to study.|$|E

50|$|The <b>orthoreoviruses</b> (reoviruses) are the prototypic {{members of}} the virus Reoviridae family and {{representative}} of the turreted members, which comprise about half the genera. Like other {{members of the}} family, the reoviruses are non-enveloped and characterized by concentric capsid shells that encapsidate a segmented dsRNA genome. In particular, reovirus has eight structural proteins and ten segments of dsRNA. A series of uncoating steps and conformational changes accompany cell entry and replication. High-resolution structures are known for almost all of the proteins of mammalian reovirus (MRV), which is the best-studied genotype. Electron cryo-microscopy (cryoEM) and X-ray crystallography have provided a wealth of structural information about two specific MRV strains, type 1 Lang (T1L) and type 3 Dearing (T3D).|$|R

The primary objective of our study was the molecular characterization of an avian reovirus strain, T 1781, which was isolated from a broiler chicken with a central nervous system disorder in Hungary during 2012. The complete genome sequence was determined using a traditional sequencing method after cell culture adaptation of the strain. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses showed that T 1781 shared only moderate nucleic acid sequence identity in several genes to previously analyzed reovirus strains from chickens, and each gene formed separate branches in the corresponding phylogenetic trees. The maximum nucleotide sequence identities of strain T 1781 genes to reference avian reovirus strains ranged from 79...|$|R
40|$|Mammalian <b>orthoreoviruses</b> are {{believed}} to replicate in distinctive, cytoplasmic inclusion bodies, commonly called viral factories or viroplasms. The viral nonstructural protein μNS has been implicated in forming the matrix of these structures, {{as well as in}} recruiting other components to them for putative roles in genome replication and particle assembly. In this study, we sought to identify the regions of μNS that are involved in forming factory-like inclusions in transfected cells in the absence of infection or other viral proteins. Sequences in the carboxyl-terminal one-third of the 721 -residue μNS protein were linked to this activity. Deletion of as few as eight residues from the carboxyl terminus of μNS resulted in loss of inclusion formation, suggesting that some portion of these residues is required for the phenotype. A region spanning residues 471 to 721 of μNS was the smallest one shown to be sufficient for forming factory-like inclusions. The region from positions 471 to 721 (471 - 721 region) includes both of two previously predicted coiled-coil segments in μNS, suggesting that one or both of these segments may also be required for inclusion formation. Deletion of the more amino-terminal one of the two predicted coiled-coil segments from the 471 - 721 region resulted in loss of the phenotype, although replacement of this segment with Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein, which is known to weakly dimerize, largely restored inclusion formation. Sequences between the two predicted coiled-coil segments were also required for forming factory-like inclusions, and mutation of either one His residue (His 570) or one Cys residue (Cys 572) within these sequences disrupted the phenotype. The His and Cys residues are part of a small consensus motif that is conserved across μNS homologs from avian <b>orthoreoviruses</b> and aquareoviruses, suggesting this motif may have a common function in these related viruses. The inclusion-forming 471 - 721 region of μNS was shown to provide a useful platform for the presentation of peptides for studies of protein-protein association through colocalization to factory-like inclusions in transfected cells...|$|R

We report the generation of viable reovirus following plasmid transfection of murine L 929 (L) cells using a strategy free of helper virus and independent of selection. We used the reovirus reverse genetics system to introduce mutations into viral capsid proteins σ 1 and σ 3 and to rescue a virus that expresses a green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgene, thus demonstrating the tractability of this technology.

The efficiency of virus rescue using the 4 -plasmid strategy was substantially increased in comparison to the original 10 -plasmid system.

40|$|Mammalian <b>Orthoreoviruses</b> are {{important}} models for studies of viral pathogenesis(3). Reovirus type 3 Dearing (T 3 D) causes a prominent neutrophil influx, substantially greater than seen with reovirus type 1 Lang (T 1 L) in a rat model of viral pneumonia(2). To better understand mechanisms underlying {{differences in the}} host inflammatory response elicited by T 1 L and T 3 D, Farone et al. characterized cytokine expression patterns induced by those strains after infection of THP- 1 monocyte cells. Because GRO-α, IL- 8, or TNF-α are produced by monocytes and macrophages and play important roles in the attraction and activation of neutrophils(4). THP- 1 cells were adsorbed with ultraviolet-inactivated T 1 L and T 3 D and assayed for mRNA and protein production of GRO-α, IL- 8, or TNF-α. A greater percentage of THP- 1 cells was infected with T 1 L than T 3 D as assessed by infectious center assay, and T 1 L achieved higher yields of infectious progeny than did T 3 D in infected THP- 1 cells as determined by plaque assay. These strain-dependent differences i...|$|R
2500|$|The {{assembly}} of new virion occurs in sub-viral {{particles in the}} cytoplasm. [...] Since this virus has two capsids, each capsid, T13 (outer capsid) and T2 (inner capsid) {{need to be able}} to self-assemble to form the virus particle. It is known that the {{assembly of}} T13 capsid is dependent on viral protein σ3. This allows the formation of heterohexameric complexes to be made. The T2 capsid proteins of <b>orthoreovirus</b> [...] need the co-expression of both the T2 protein and the [...] nodular σ2 protein to stabilize the structure and aid in assembly. Positive and negative strands of RNA produced during the transcription state must base pair correctly in order to serve as the genome in the newly formed virus particle.|$|E
2500|$|Replication of {{the virus}} takes places in the {{cytoplasm}} of the host cell. Since the genome of this virus is dsRNA, early transcription of the genome must take place inside the capsid where it is safe {{and will not be}} degraded by the host cell. dsRNA inside of a cell is a tip off to the immune system that the cell is infected with a virus, since dsRNA does not occur in the normal replication of a cell. As transcription occurs with the aid of viral polymerase, protein λ3 serves as the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, full strands of positive sense single stranded RNA (mRNA) are synthesized from each of the dsRNA segments. Viral protein, μ2, is known to be a transcriptase cofactor during transcription. It has been determined that this protein has some enzymatic functions such as NTPase activity, capping the mRNA transcript, even serving as RNA helicase to separate the dsRNA strands. The viral helicase comes from protein λ3 [...] These mRNA now are able to go into the cytoplasm to be translated into protein. The viral protein gyanyltransferase λ2 is responsible for capping the viral mRNA. Mammalian <b>orthoreovirus</b> mRNA transcripts have a short 5’ un translated region (UTR), do not have [...] 3’ poly A tails, and may even lack 5’ caps during late post-infection. Thus is it not known how exactly how these uncapped versions of viral mRNA are able to use host cell ribosome to aid in translation. To be able to produce the genome, positive sense RNAs serve as the template strand to make negative sense RNA. The positive and negative strands will base-pair to create the dsRNA genome {{of the virus}}.|$|E
2500|$|Mammalian <b>Orthoreovirus</b> virions are non-enveloped with {{icosahedral}} symmetry {{created by}} a double-layered capsid reaching about 80nm wide. Each capsid contains 10 segments of double stranded RNA (dsRNA) genome. The inner capsid or core particle (T=2) contains five different proteins: σ2, λ1, λ2, λ3, and μ2 and is approximately 70nm in diameter. One hundred and twenty copies of the λ1 protein arranged in 12 decameric units make up the shell of the inner capsid structure. This shell is stabilized by {{one hundred and fifty}} copies of the σ2 protein that 'clamp' [...] adjacent λ1 monomers together. At the 12 five-fold axes of symmetry, pentamers of the λ2 protein form turret-like structures that protrudes {{from the surface of the}} shell. In the center of the λ2 turret a channel allows viral mRNAs to be extruded during transcription. The channel is 70Å at its base and 15Å at its narrowest point. [...] The core also contains within it twelve copies of λ3, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. One λ3 protein is found slightly offset from each of the twelve pentameric λ2 turrets. Closely associated with λ3 are one or two copies of μ2, a transcriptase cofactor. μ2 has been found to have some enzymatic functions, such as NTPase activity. The λ3 protein is responsible for transcription of the double-stranded RNA genome segments. Each transcript is threaded through the λ2 pentameric turret as it is being extruded. Guanylyltransferase enzmatic activity in the λ2 turret adds a 5' guanosine cap to the extruded mRNA. In addition, two methyltransferase domains found in the λ2 structure act to methylate the 7N position of the added guanosine and the 2' O of the first templated nucleotide, which in all cases is also a guanosine. The outer capsid (T=13) is composed of μ1 and σ3 proteins with λ2, in compound with σ1, interspersed around the capsid. It has been proposed that λ2 is involved in replication due to its placement at the fivefold axes and its ability to interact with λ3 in solution. σ1, a filamentous trimer extruding from the outer capsid, [...] is responsible for cell attachment by interacting with sialic acid and other entry receptors. μ1 and σ3 are both involved in the attachment and thus entry of the virus via receptor-mediated endocytosis involving the formation of clathrin-coated pits.|$|E
40|$|Mammalian <b>orthoreoviruses</b> induce {{apoptosis}} in vivo and in vitro; {{however, the}} specific {{mechanism by which}} apoptosis is induced is not fully understood. Recent {{studies have indicated that}} the reovirus outer capsid protein μ 1 is the primary determinant of reovirus-induced apoptosis. Ectopically expressed μ 1 induces apoptosis and localizes to intracellular membranes. Here we report that ectopic expression of μ 1 activated both the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways with activation of initiator caspases- 8 and - 9 and downstream effector caspase- 3. Activation of both pathways was required for μ 1 -induced apoptosis, as specific inhibition of either caspase- 8 or caspase- 9 abolished downstream effector caspase- 3 activation. Similar to reovirus infection, ectopic expression of μ 1 caused release into the cytosol of cytochrome c and smac/DIABLO from the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Pancaspase inhibitors did not prevent cytochrome c release from cells expressing μ 1, indicating that caspases were not required. Additionally, μ 1 - or reovirus-induced release of cytochrome c occurred efficiently in Bax−/−Bak−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs).

40|$|Virally induced {{structures}} called viral factories form {{throughout the}} cytoplasm of cells infected with mammalian <b>orthoreoviruses</b> (MRV). When expressed alone in cells, MRV nonstructural protein μNS forms factory-like structures very similar in appearance to viral factories, {{suggesting that it}} is involved in forming the structural matrix of these structures. μNS also associates with MRV core particles; the core proteins μ 2, λ 1, λ 2, λ 3, and σ 2; and the RNA-binding nonstructural protein σNS. These multiple associations result in the recruitment or retention of these viral proteins or particles at factory-like structures. In this study, we identified the regions of μNS necessary and sufficient for these associations and additionally examined the localization of viral RNA synthesis in infected cells. We found that short regions within the amino-terminal 220 residues of μNS are necessary for associations with core particles and necessary and sufficient for associations with the proteins μ 2, λ 1, λ 2, σ 2, and σNS. We also found that only the λ 3 protein associates with the carboxyl-terminal one-third of μNS and that viral RNA is synthesized within viral factories.

To directly test this hypothesis, the gene encoding the p 14 FAST protein of reptilian reovirus was inserted into the genome of a heterologous virus that does not naturally form syncytia, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Expression of the p 14 FAST protein by the VSV/FAST recombinant gave the virus a highly fusogenic phenotype in cell culture. The growth of this recombinant fusogenic VSV strain was unaltered in vitro but was significantly enhanced in vivo. The VSV/FAST recombinant consistently generated higher titers of virus in the brains of BALB/c mice after intranasal or intravenous infection compared to the parental VSV/green fluorescent protein (GFP) strain that expresses GFP in place of p 14. The VSV/FAST recombinant also resulted in an increased incidence of hind-limb paralysis, it infected a larger volume of brain tissue, and it induced more extensive neuropathology, thus leading to a lower maximum tolerable dose than that for the VSV/GFP parental virus.

This study reports the isolation and characterization of a novel reassortant MRV from the lesser horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus hipposideros). The isolate, here designated BatMRV 1 -IT 2011, was first identified by electron microscopy and confirmed using PCR and virus-neutralization tests. The full genome sequence was obtained by next-generation sequencing. Molecular and antigenic characterizations revealed that BatMRV 1 -IT 2011 belonged to serotype 1, which had not previously been identified in bats. Phylogenetic and recombination detection program analyses suggested that BatMRV 1 -IT 2011 was a reassortant strain containing an S 1 genome segment {{similar to those of}} MRV T 1 /bovine/Maryland/Clone 23 / 59 and C/bovine/ Indiana/MRV 00304 / 2014, while other segments were more similar to MRVs of different hosts, origins and serotypes. The presence of neutralizing antibodies against MRVs has also been investigated in animals (dogs, pigs, bovines and horses). Preliminary results suggested that MRVs are widespread in animals and that infections containing multiple serotypes, including MRVs of serotype 1 with an S 1 gene similar to BatMRV 1 -IT 2011, are common. This paper extends the current knowledge of MRVs and stresses the importance to continue and improve MRV surveillance in bats and other mammals through the development and standardization of specific diagnostic tools...|$|R
40|$|Mammalian <b>orthoreoviruses</b> (reoviruses) are {{ubiquitous}} viral {{agents that}} infect cells in respiratory and enteric tracts. The frequency {{and nature of}} human cellular immunoregulatory responses against reovirus are unknown. Here we establish systems to detect and quantify reovirus-induced cytokine and chemokine recall responses using primary cultures of virus-infected {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMC) and two widely used reovirus serotypes, type 1 Lang (T 1 L) and type 3 Dearing (T 3 D) reexposure in vitro. In cultures from 44 healthy adults, reovirus induced exceptionally strong CD 4 and CD 8 T-cell-dependent gamma interferon (IFN-γ) recall responses concomitant with intense interleukin 10 (IL- 10) production. These responses were elicited independently of viral replication. Surprisingly, paired analyses of subject responses to these two common serotypes revealed that while both elicit intense Th 1 -dominated immunity, median T 3 D-driven responses were 2. 2 -fold weaker (P = 0. 0004) than those elicited by T 1 L. Recall responses evoked by these viral serotypes differed markedly in their mechanism of regulation. T 3 D IL- 10 and IFN-γ responses were CD 4 and CD 8 dependent and blocked by interfering with CD 86 costimulation but were CD 80 independent. T 1 L responses were consistently CD 28 and CD 80 / 86 independent. Thus, despite extensive genetic and morphological similarities between reovirus serotypes, the nature and intensity of the human recall responses as well as the control mechanisms regulating them are clearly distinct...|$|R
