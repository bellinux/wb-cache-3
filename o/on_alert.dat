5|$|On 15December, areas across Pilbara {{were placed}} <b>on</b> <b>alert</b> for the storm's arrival; however, {{as the storm}} {{continued}} west, the alert was dropped. The warning was quickly reinstated when forecasts showed Ilona moving south. Officials indicated that residents had roughly 12hours to fully prepare.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effect of aging <b>on</b> <b>alerting,</b> orienting, and {{conflict}} resolution by assessing younger (mean age¼ 25. 8) and older (mean age¼ 67. 9) adults’ performance in the Attention Network Test that combines, in a single experimental paradigm, a flanker task with alerting and orienting cues. The analyses of response times indicated equivalent orienting and conflict resolution effects in younger and older adults. By contrast, alerting {{was found to be}} significantly reduced in the elderly. This result is only marginally in accordance with recent studies addressing the issues of age-related differences in alerting, which provide mixed results. The possible role of methodological differences across studies in accounting for the controversial results concerning the aging affect <b>on</b> <b>alerting</b> is discussed...|$|R

5|$|After 1964 the Kwajalein {{site was}} no longer {{required}} to be <b>on</b> <b>alert,</b> and returned primarily to Zeus testing. The system was kept active in a non-alert role between 1964 and 1967, known as Program 505. In 1967 it {{was replaced by a}} Thor based system, Program 437. A total of 12 launches, including those at White Sands, were carried out as part of the 505 program between 1962 and 1966.|$|E
5|$|Due to the storm's {{proximity}} to Central America, several countries were placed <b>on</b> <b>alert</b> and began allocating supplies {{for a potential}} disaster. Several hurricane watches and warnings were raised for the small Colombian island of Providencia {{as well as the}} Nicaragua and Honduras coastlines. An estimated 150,000 people were evacuated from dangerous regions in Nicaragua and more than 125,000 more were evacuated in Honduras.|$|E
5|$|During late 1999, No.75 Squadron {{was placed}} <b>on</b> <b>alert</b> to provide {{close air support}} and air defence for the {{international}} forces deployed to East Timor as part of INTERFET. While Indonesian forces posed a potential threat to this force, no fighting eventuated and the Hornets were not required.|$|E
50|$|Needless to say, {{this was}} the heyday of ALCS operations. Around-the-clock, there were three {{dedicated}} ALCCs <b>on</b> ground <b>alert,</b> one ALCS capable Looking Glass SAC ABNCP airborne at all times, {{and at least two}} ALCS-capable Auxiliary ABNCPs <b>on</b> ground <b>alert.</b> Airborne missileers, along with all other Cold Warriors kept the peace for several decades.|$|R

5|$|In 1981, Loring's bombers {{were placed}} <b>on</b> <b>alert</b> after Soviet {{submarines}} were spotted {{off the coast}} of the region. The base was briefly mentioned in the 1983 movie WarGames, although the film erroneously listed Loring as being home to the 43rd Bombardment Wing. In 1982, the base was hit by two earthquakes, which damaged the base hospital and caused cracks to appear {{on the walls of the}} control tower.|$|E
5|$|Radar-equipped Japanese {{reconnaissance}} aircraft sighted various task {{groups of the}} Third Fleet throughout {{the day and night}} of 11October, giving area commanders on Formosa and in the Philippines early warning. Knowing that dawn strikes on 12October were imminent, ground forces were placed <b>on</b> <b>alert</b> and aircraft were readied for early morning intercept.|$|E
5|$|The {{squadron}} was re-equipped with F/A-18 Hornet {{fighters and}} moved to RAAF Base Tindal in 1988. It was placed <b>on</b> <b>alert</b> to support the Australian-led INTERFET peacekeeping deployment to East Timor in 1999, and saw combat in 2003 {{as part of the}} Australian contribution to the invasion of Iraq and in 2015 during the military intervention against ISIL.|$|E
30|$|Our {{approach}} is less sensible {{to the age}} of the dataset, as it relies <b>on</b> <b>alerts</b> derived from the network traffic (by sensors such as Snort), instead of the network traffic itself. Therefore, the changes that have taken place in the characteristics of network traffic are masqueraded by our sensors and have a lesser impact on the effectiveness of our algorithms.|$|R

5|$|To prepare in {{the case}} of violence, the church applied for an arsenal that a {{volunteer}} company would use in case the church was attacked. Pennsylvania Governor David R. Porter authorized the formation of a company and the procurement of twenty-five muskets from the Frankford Arsenal. Major General Robert Patterson, commander of the Pennsylvania militia, put the troops <b>on</b> <b>alert</b> in case of violence.|$|E
5|$|Waterspouts {{have long}} been {{recognized}} as serious marine hazards. Stronger waterspouts pose threats to watercraft, aircraft and people. It is recommended to keep a considerable distance from these phenomena, and to always be <b>on</b> <b>alert</b> through weather reports. The United States National Weather Service will often issue special marine warnings when waterspouts are likely or have been sighted over coastal waters, or tornado warnings when waterspouts are expected to move onshore.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of the storm, over 24,000people {{evacuated}} Philippines's northeastern {{province of}} Aurora. Many radio stations, typically which close during Easter, remained operational to broadcast the storm. Officials issued storm warnings, {{and the military}} was <b>on</b> <b>alert.</b> Beaches were closed, boats were ordered to remain at port, and 10flights were canceled. The Department of Social Welfare and Development reported that ₱300.9million (US$6.8million) worth of funds and supplies were available for possible relief efforts. Approximately 28,000family food packs were prepositioned in warehouses across Luzon.|$|E

5|$|In November 2014, three MV-22Bs {{were placed}} <b>on</b> <b>alert</b> at Al Jaber Air Base in Kuwait {{to be ready}} within 30 minutes to recover downed pilots during the Military {{intervention}} against ISIL. On 29 occasions between 1 November and 24 April 2015, two Ospreys and a KC-130J aerial tanker assigned to this Tactical Recovery of Aircraft and Personnel (TRAP) mission spent 145 flight hours loitering, ready to perform rescue missions if required. The only pilot that was downed was a Jordanian, {{but he did not}} have a radio on him when he ejected and landed too close to ISIL forces.|$|E
5|$|Loring {{was also}} home to many {{facilities}} that {{were a part of}} the base, or were nearby. Caribou Air Force Station was the weapons storage area that operated separately from Loring until it was absorbed in 1961. Caswell Air Force Station operated to the east, but had a unit associated with Loring before it became fully operational. On-base facilities included the Alert Area, which operated as a separate facility within Loring, due to crews being constantly stationed <b>on</b> <b>alert.</b> The Double Cantilever Hangar was the largest hangar at the facility, with the capacity to hold six parked B-52s, or five B-36s.|$|E
5|$|Maine {{continued}} to be difficult, with a rebellion by Hubert de Beaumont-au-Maine, probably in 1084. Hubert was besieged in his castle at Sainte-Suzanne by William's forces {{for at least two}} years, but he eventually made his peace with the king and was restored to favour. William's movements during 1084 and 1085 are unclear– he was in Normandy at Easter 1084 but may have been in England before then to collect the danegeld assessed that year for the defence of England against an invasion by King Cnut IV of Denmark. Although English and Norman forces remained <b>on</b> <b>alert</b> throughout 1085 and into 1086, the invasion threat was ended by Cnut's death in July 1086.|$|E

5|$|News {{stations}} were stationed with crews along the Jersey shore {{several days in}} advance of Isabel to provide breaking news and live conditions. Many residents prepared their houses by boarding windows and purchasing emergency supplies. The Sussex County chapter of the American Red Cross advised local high schools to be on stand-by as potential shelters in the event evacuation occurred. Emergency coordinators in several counties were <b>on</b> <b>alert,</b> though none issued evacuations. In preparation for anticipated power outages, the Jersey Central Power and Light company arranged to receive more electrical crews from its parent company, FirstEnergy. Other utility workers from various locations as far as Canada left for {{the state in the}} event of power outages.|$|E
5|$|Nicholson was {{at first}} seen as an {{improvement}} over the Catholic Thomas Dongan, the outgoing governor. However, the province's old guard was unhappy that Andros removed all of the provincial records to Boston, and then Nicholson alarmed the sometimes hardline Protestant population by preserving the trappings of the chapel in Fort James that Dongan and the handful of New York's Catholics had used for worship. In response to a rumored Dutch invasion of England (a rumor {{that turned out to}} be true), Nicholson in January 1689 ordered the provincial militias to be <b>on</b> <b>alert</b> to protect the province for the king. Unknown to Nicholson, events in England had already changed things.|$|E
5|$|No. 33 Squadron was {{immediately}} put <b>on</b> <b>alert.</b> At noon, Pattle {{was ordered to}} fly a fighter patrol over the Rupel Pass, Bulgaria, another Axis partner. Here he had his first encounter with the Luftwaffe. No. 33 Squadron attacked 20 Bf 109s and claimed five without loss. Pattle claimed two victories over Bf 109Es over the Rupel Pass —Oberleutnant Arno Becker was killed and Leutnant Klaus Faber was captured. These successes represented his 26th and 27th aerial victories. Thereafter, details vary as to his score as all records were destroyed.|$|E
