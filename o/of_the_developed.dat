5|$|At birth {{the lungs}} are very undeveloped with only around one sixth of the alveoli {{of the adult}} lung present. The alveoli {{continue}} to form into early adulthood, {{and their ability to}} form when necessary is seen in the regeneration of the lung. Alveolar septa have a double capillary network instead of the single network <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>developed</b> lung. Only after the maturation of the capillary network can the lung enter a normal phase of growth. Following the early growth in numbers of alveoli there is another stage of the alveoli being enlarged.|$|E
5|$|By 1955, talks began about {{upgrading}} the highway. After a proposition to turn {{much of the}} route into a toll road failed, it was decided a four-lane freeway {{would be the best}} decision. However, opposition from residents in surrounding neighborhoods as well as a federal oil embargo only allowed widening of the approach between Fairgrounds Drive and I-80. In 1977, a levee broke and flooded a portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>developed</b> land, turning it into protected wetlands that is home to endangered species. Because of its new status, environmental studies were needed in order to continue the project.|$|E

40|$|Morphological {{variations}} in the adult anthropoid mandibular symphysis {{have been attributed to}} the high loading regimens elicited during postcanine biting, but none of these biomechanical models have considered <b>the</b> potential influences <b>of</b> developmental constraints on symphyseal morphology during ontogeny. Consistency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shape <b>of</b> symphyseal morphology and its intimate relationship of incisor crypts in juveniles suggest either that <b>the</b> relative size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> incisors influences symphyseal morphology or that biomechanical demands on the symphyseal region constraint <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> incisors during ontogeny. Also <b>the</b> spatial requirements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> incisor dentition result in <b>the</b> reduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subcortical bone tissue in the symphyseal region, leaving the anterior mandible subcortically hollowed. <b>The</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> incisor crypts-instead <b>of</b> subcortical bone-on <b>the</b> mechanical performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> juvenile symphysis was tested here using Finite element analysis (FEA) of a juvenile M. fascicularis mandible. FEA results showed a notable increase in strain magnitudes by up to 35 % when <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> crypts are present. This suggests that <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> crypts and associated reduction in subcortical bone tissue has a remarkable effect on <b>the</b> ability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> symphysis to resist bending since a hollowed subcortical symphysis is not as effective at resisting stresses. These results indicate that there is an adaptational balance in symphyseal morphology between <b>the</b> spatial requirements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> incisor dentition and the biomechanical functional maintenance during ontogeny. <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> this study also introduce the hypothesis that symphyseal morphology is a primary adaptation to <b>the</b> spatial demands <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> incisor dentition which is secondarily adapted (exapted) to masticatory biomechanics...|$|R

It is a glacial lake surrounded by hills and is the source of Harveys Creek, a tributary of the Susquehanna River. The lake has a stone masonry dam. The lake's watershed has an area of approximately 3600 acres. The majority of the watershed is forested, but there is some developed land as well. Nearly all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>developed</b> land is close to the lake itself, and the lake is surrounded entirely by a paved road.|$|E

Chapman as partners, and dedicated the South Park Blocks and midtown park blocks in 1852. This made them the first official greenspace in Portland. While they were dedicated to the city, they weren't owned by the city until September 22, 1870, when Mayor Bernard Goldsmith and Chapman agreed on selling the South Park Blocks and the two Plaza Blocks (Chapman and Lownsdale Squares) to the city for $6,250.
