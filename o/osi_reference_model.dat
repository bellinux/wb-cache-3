5|$|The Internet {{works in}} part because of {{protocols}} that govern how the computers and routers communicate with each other. The nature of computer network communication lends itself to a layered approach where individual protocols in the protocol stack run more-or-less independently of other protocols. This allows lower-level protocols to be customized for the network situation while not changing the way higher-level protocols operate. A practical example of why this is important is because it allows an Internet browser to run the same code regardless of whether the computer it is running on is connected to the Internet through an Ethernet or Wi-Fi connection. Protocols are often talked about in terms of their place in the <b>OSI</b> <b>reference</b> <b>model</b> (pictured on the right), which emerged in 1983 as the first step in an unsuccessful attempt to build a universally adopted networking protocol suite.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Current network stacks {{based on}} the classic <b>OSI</b> layered <b>reference</b> <b>model</b> are {{restricted}} and inflexible, which makes the addition and deployment of new features difficult. Operating systems offer an interface for the Transport Layer functionalities to applications. The usage of this interface is very widespread, making it useful to maintain this interface. However, the layered structure should be replaced. In this paper, we propose our approach for breaking up the functionalities of the OSI Transport Layer into the concept so called functional building blocks. Each functional building block provides a particular service, which – in interaction with the other functional building blocks – is able to provide a service similar to the classic OSI Transport Layer. The concept allows for easy removal, replacement or addition of existing and new functional building blocks to adapt the service to state-of-the-art and future requirements, particularly including multi-path transport and QoS...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – Since its {{introduction}} in the mid- 1970 s, the <b>OSI</b> Basic <b>Reference</b> <b>Model</b> (OSI-BRM) {{has been widely}} used {{as a foundation for}} communication models and standards. While many of these have modified the OSI-BRM for specific communication requirements (protocols such as ZigBee and Fieldbus – used in sensor networks), little structure or standardisation has been developed for other aspects of the hardware/software interface – for example sensing, energy management, actuation or locationing. Such processing is often implemented in the application layer of the communications stack, resulting in an unstructured, top-heavy and confusing stack. Alternatively, processing is performed off-chip or in separate unstructured software. In this paper, we propose the Unified Framework for the structured design and implementation of multiple interfaces on a sensor node. The framework creates unified stacks by connecting individual stacks (containing distinct functionality) via a shared application layer. We present the application of the framework to create a unified stack, structuring both communications and sensing. The process of extending a unified stack for implementing energy management, locationing and actuation is also discussed. The proposed framework establishes a structured platform for the formal design, specification and implementation of sensor and wireless sensor networks. I...|$|R

40|$|The Internet's {{success in}} the 21 st century has {{encouraged}} analysts to investigate {{the origin of this}} network. Much of this literature adopts a teleological approach. Works often begin by discussing the invention of packet switching, describe the design and development of the ARPANET, and then examine how this network evolved into the Internet. Although the ARPANET was a seminal computer network, these accounts usually only briefly consider the many other diverse networks that existed. In addition, apart from momentary asides to alternative internetworking solutions, such as the Open Systems Interconnection (<b>OSI)</b> seven-layer <b>reference</b> <b>model,</b> this literature concentrates exclusively on the ARPANET, the Internet, and the World Wide Web. While focusing on these subjects is important and therefore justified, it can leave the reader with the impression that the world of networking started with the ARPANET and ended with the Internet. This thesis is an attempt to help correct this misconception. This thesis analyses the evolution of British computer networks and the Internet between the years 1970 and 1995. After an introduction in Chapter 1, the thesis analyses several networks. In Chapters 2 and 3, the focus is on academic networks, especially JANET and SuperJANET. Attention moves to videotex networks in Chapter 4, specifically Prestel, and in Chapter 5, the dissertation examines electronic mail networks such as Telecom Gold and Cable & Wireless Easylink. Chapter 6 considers online services, including CompuServe, American Online, and the Microsoft Network, and the thesis ends with a conclusion in Chapter 7. All of the networks discussed used protocols that were incompatible with each other which limited the utility of the networks for their users. Although it was possible that OSI or another solution could have solved this problem, the Internet's protocols achieved this objective. This thesis shows how the networks converged around TCP/IP.

Comments are welcome. Distribution of this memo is unlimited. 2) Acknowledgement The {{authors would like to}} thank Guy Almes of Rice University for his contributions and insight. 3) Overview The "core " model of Autonomous Systems [2] formed the basis for the routing model used in the Internet. Due to massive growth and topology changes, the "core " model no longer is in harmony with the reality of today’s Internet. Indeed, this situation was foreseen at the outset: "Ultimately, however, the internet may consist of a number of coequal autonomous systems, any of which may be used [...] . as a transport medium for traffic originating in any system and destined for any system. When this more complex configuration comes into being, it will be inappropriate to regard any one autonomous system as a "core " system " [2]. Furthermore, the Autonomous System concept has been outgrown in certain parts of the Internet, in which the complexity of regional routing has exceeded the limits of the definition of Autonomous Systems. A model which can provide a better match to the Internet can be found in the "OSI Routeing Framework " [1]. This framework proposes a structure of Routing Domains within Administrative Domains. This paper is intended to briefly describe this framework, to outline how this model better fits the reality of Hares & Katz [Page 1] RFC 1136 A Model for Routing in the Internet December 1989 the present and future Internet, and to show how the model can aid in the construction of well-engineered routing environments. 4) Terminology The following is a brief glossary of OSI terminology. Formal definitions can be found in the <b>OSI</b> Basic <b>Reference</b> <b>Model</b> [4], the Internal Organization of the Network Layer [5], and the OSI Routeing Framework [1].
