40|$|Abstract. A human {{interface}} toolkit is proposed {{for helping the}} user to develop <b>operation</b> <b>support</b> <b>system</b> of complex industrial system such as Nuclear Power Plant (NPP). With a friendly graphical interface, this integrated tool includes a database, a procedure editor and a procedure executor. A three layer hierarchy is adopted to express the complexity of operation procedure, which includes mission, process and node. There are 10 kinds of node: entrance, exit, hint, manual input, detector, actuator, data treatment, branch, judgement and plug-in. The <b>operation</b> <b>support</b> <b>system</b> will sense and actuate the actual industrial systems with the interface based on IVI-COM (Interchangeable Virtual Instru-mentation-Component Object Model) technology.

50|$|The Service Evaluation System (SES) was an <b>operations</b> <b>support</b> <b>system</b> {{developed}} by Bell Laboratories {{and used by}} telephone companies {{beginning in the late}} 1960s. Many local, long distance, and operator circuit-switching systems provided special dedicated circuits to the SES to monitor the quality of customer connections during the call setup process. Calls were selected at random by switching systems and one-way voice connections were established to the SES monitoring center.|$|E

50|$|AMATPS is an <b>Operations</b> <b>Support</b> <b>System</b> {{developed}} during the early 1980s by the Bell System and Bell Communications Research. AMATPS is an acronym that stands for Automatic Message Accounting Tele-Processing System. The purpose of this OSS and communications application was to transport customer billing information from switching systems to a centralized computer {{that serves as a}} repository for billing data. Nearly all wireline and wireless telecommunications companies utilize similar technologies today to transport near-real-time billing information.|$|E
5000|$|This {{system was}} known as the SOSS, or Satellite <b>Operations</b> <b>Support</b> <b>System.</b> [...] Analog feeds were discontinued, and instead uplinked {{digitally}} (but still in SCPC fashion and on 2 satellite transponders) using Musicam encoding, and received using ComStream ABR-700 digital audio satellite demodulators, which tapped off the 70 MHz IF bus of a Satellite System Corporation Model 4421 downconverter, which was in essence the main satellite receiver for the system, taking in the L-band input from the dish's LNB.|$|E
50|$|The Switching Control Center System was an <b>operations</b> <b>support</b> <b>system</b> {{developed}} by Bell Laboratories and deployed {{during the early}} 1970s. This computer system was first based on the PDP-11 product line from Digital Equipment Corporation and used the CB Unix operating system and custom application software and device drivers that were developed and maintained by Bell Labs in Columbus, Ohio USA. SCCS was ported to the AT&T 3B20 and 3B5 computers running UNIX System V Release 2 in the early 1980s.|$|E
40|$|Intelligent <b>operation</b> <b>support</b> <b>systems</b> {{emerged from}} the {{complexity}} of modern industrial plants {{and the availability of}} inexpensive computer hardware. Modern industrial plants often collect vast amount of process data in distributed control systems and management information systems. Time stress due to data overload and decision uncertainty increases the risk of operator errors. Comprehensive <b>operation</b> <b>support</b> to the operator in abnormal situations to reduce operator errors is strongly suggested. The solution to this problem is to design intelligent <b>operation</b> <b>support</b> <b>systems</b> that reduce the cognitive load placed on operators by providing guidance for knowledge-based decision making. This paper presents an intelligent <b>operation</b> <b>support</b> <b>system</b> (IOSS) structure using rich knowledge representation and hybrid reasoning strategy. The functional requirements and desired features for IOSS are defined. The human operator’s recognition behavior is analyzed. It is shown that a hybrid reasoning environment that combines case-based reasoning (CBR), model-based reasoning (MBR) and rule-based reasoning (RBR) is consistent with operator’s problem solving. A multidimensional problem solving model is proposed to incorporate these requirements and human recognition behavior. The IOSS is designed by using the problem solving model as the guide...|$|R
