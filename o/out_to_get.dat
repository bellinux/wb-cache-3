The Gunslinger arrives, and confirms the Doctor's theory that he is one of Jex's experiments. He has sought vengeance and killed all but Jex. Though he cannot harm innocents by his programming, the Gunslinger warns that Jex must be brought to him or he will take more drastic measures.|$|E

Skinner tells him that Miles is somehow alive and still <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> Scully and her unborn child. Suddenly, Agent Gene Crane comes to Doggett and tells him {{that there is a}} person—Knowle Rohrer—who wants to see him, about issues {{concerning}} Miles and Scully. This leaves Fox Mulder and Skinner to interrogate Krycek. Rohrer fabricates a story to Doggett that Miles is part of a Military Project to create a super soldier and that Scully had a chip put {{in the back of her}} neck during her abduction to make her pregnant with the first organic version of a super soldier.|$|E
5|$|The {{prototype}} of the prison genre was The Big House (1930). In The Big House, Robert Montgomery plays a squirmy inmate who is sentenced to six years after committing vehicular manslaughter while under the influence. His cell mates are a murderer played by Wallace Beery and a forger played by Chester Morris. The picture features future staples of the prison genre such as solitary confinement, informers, riots, visitations, an escape, and the codes of prison life. The protagonist, Montgomery, ends up being a loathsome character, a coward who will sell anyone in the prison <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> an early release. The film was banned in Ohio, {{the site of the}} deadly prison riots that inspired it. Numbered Men, The Criminal Code, Shadow of the Law, Convict's Code, and others, from no less than seven studios, followed. However, prison films mainly appealed to men, and had weak box office performances as a result.|$|E

In 1868 Hooker had proposed that the whole of the huge herbarium collection of Joseph Banks should be moved from the British Museum to Kew, a reasonable idea, but a threat to Owen's plans for a museum in South Kensington to house the natural history collections. Hooker cited mismanagement at the British Museum as a justification.|$|E

25|$|One {{particularly}} high-profile {{example of}} a duck came in 1948, when Don Bradman was playing his final Test match for Australia, against England at The Oval. In Australia's first innings, Bradman was bowled for a duck by Eric Hollies, causing his Test average to fall from 101.39 to 99.94; had he scored just four runs, his average would have been 100. As things turned out, Australia won the match by an innings, and so Bradman did not get to bat a second time (had he batted, he would have needed at least 104 runs if dismissed or at least four runs if not <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> his average back to 100).|$|E
25|$|After {{hitting a}} dip in the season, losing 13–3 to {{eventual}} national champion Clemson, Georgia regained its focus and won <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to 10–1 by the regular season's end. Even though Walker was able to push, shove, and get through Clemson's defense by rushing 28 times for 111 yards, it wasn't enough to overcome 9 turnovers by the Bulldogs in the loss to the Tigers. Georgia rebounded by blanking South Carolina, 24–0, on September 26 as the sophomore Walker ran for 176 yards on 36 carries. Georgia led just 3–0 at the half, and Walker opened things up for the Bulldogs in the third quarter by scoring on touchdown runs of 3 and 8 yards to put the Gamecocks away.|$|E
25|$|Cases {{like these}} have created some privacy {{implications}} {{as to whether}} or not companies should have the right to look at employees' social network profiles. In March 2012, Facebook decided they might take legal action against employers for gaining access to employee's profiles through their passwords. According to Facebook Chief Privacy Officer for policy, Erin Egan, the company has worked hard to give its users the tools to control who sees their information. He also said users shouldn't be forced to share private information and communications just to get a job. According to the network's Statement of Rights and Responsibilities, sharing or soliciting a password is a violation to Facebook. Employees may still give their password information <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a job, but according to Erin Egan, Facebook will continue to do their part to protect the privacy and security of their users.|$|E

25|$|Swanson invited Will Hays {{for lunch}} and {{summarized}} the plot, naming the author and the sticking points. According to Swanson, Hays made a verbal promise he would {{have no problem with}} the making of such a film. Swanson set <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the rights to the play by having Schenck pretend to buy it in the name of United Artists, never to be used. They were able to obtain the story rights for $60,000 instead of the original $100,000. When news broke concerning just what was intended with the play, the three authors threatened to sue. Swanson later contacted Maugham about rights to a sequel, and he offered to grant them for $25,000. Maugham claimed Fox had asked about a sequel at the same time Swanson had bought the original story's rights. The sequel was to follow the further exploits of Sadie in Australia, but was never made.|$|E
25|$|Aboutrika helped Al-Ahly won {{his seventh}} {{continental}} title of CAF Champions League scoring 6 goals. His most impressive match was on 14 May 2012. Ahly were down 1–0 {{at home to}} Stade Malien in a second leg CAF Champions League match and were down 2–0 on aggregate. Aboutrika was subbed on in the 42nd minute for Mohamed Shawky {{and in the second}} half, he scored his first ever CAF Champions League hat-trick, 2 of which were scored in the last 8 minutes of the match. He scored the first from a wonderfully curled free-kick from 28 yards out. He then scored the second from a penalty in the 82nd minute. Finally, he blasted the third from into the top right corner from 12 yards <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the hat-trick, complete the comeback, and secure Al-Ahly a place in the 2012 CAF Champions League group stage. On 22 July 2012, he scored against Al-Zamalek to win 1–0 in the group stage match.|$|E
25|$|The winning ways {{continued}} for United with three home games {{to start the}} month. In the first, United defeated the Columbus Crew 2–0, with two first half goals. The first came on a shot by Espindola that finished off a play that began with a 40-yard run by Rolfe, who got the assist on a perfectly weighted pass through the Crew defense. Espindola had the assist on the second goal with a corner kick to the far post when Sean Franklin volleyed for the goal. Back in goal for this game, Hamid earned yet another shutout. United's impressive home unbeaten streak continued a week later, with a 1–1 draw against Sporting Kansas City. A long pass from Perry Kitchen found Pontius, who chested {{the ball into the}} path of Jairo Arrieta, and Arrieta's shot found the back of the net. United gave away the lead about a minute later, just before halftime, as a cross by Sporting's Roger Espinoza found the foot of Dom Dwyer for the tying goal. Four nights later, United again defended Fortress RFK, against MLS debutantes, Orlando City SC. Missing star striker Espindola due to injury, United started slowly and Orlando capitalized as rookie Cyle Larin, the first pick in the 2015 MLS Superdraft, pounced on a loose ball in the box and beat goalie Bill Hamid. However, United was able to rally with two goals over the final 20 minutes to come away with a 2–1 win and regain the lead in the Supporters Shield race. A free kick by Taylor Kemp found the head of Opare, who was starting in place of the injured Birnbaum. Rolfe got the game-winner, stretching his leg <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{on the end of a}} cross by Arrieta, and tipping it in for the goal that sent the crowd into a frenzy.|$|E
