50|$|Population {{change in}} Clarborough has {{followed}} a similar trajectory {{to that of}} England as a whole, {{although there has been}} a greater amount of fluctuation. One {{reason for this is that}} Clarborough has a smaller population, therefore any change would be more recognisable. In 1881 there was a national decline in population change with England overall declining by 3%, whereas Clarborough declined overall by 6%, reaching its lowest rate of change being −3%. Since this period the population has peaked higher than the <b>original</b> <b>rate</b> to 6% in 1901, and has remained steadily in parallel with the rest of England and Wales.|$|E

The present paper is aimed at studying the influence of imperfect rating curve knowledge on the uncertainty of the response of a daily conceptual linear-nonlinear rainfall-runoff model. To describe the impact of imperfect rating curve knowledge, simulations have been conducted using a conceptual rainfall-runoff model and continuous daily series of rainfall, air temperature and discharges recorded in a Sicilian catchment. The GLUE procedure was used to introduce the uncertainty of the rating curve in a classical rainfall-runoff model uncertainty analysis by randomly modifying the <b>original</b> <b>rating</b> curve. The final results show an increase of uncertainty with respect to the <b>original</b> <b>rating</b> curves for the majority of model predictions, but more significantly for overestimated rating curves than underestimated ones...|$|R
5000|$|For many reasons, {{the furor}} {{surrounding}} The Minstrel Show overshadowed the music itself. On August 16, 2005, hip hop magazine The Source's Editor-in-Chief, Joshua [...] "Fahiym" [...] Ratcliffe, {{announced his retirement}} due to conflicting opinions on the rating The Minstrel Show was to receive in the next issue of the publication. According to Ratcliffe, his <b>original</b> <b>rating</b> of 4.5 (out of 5) was reduced to 4 by the magazine's Chief Brand Executive, Raymond [...] "Benzino" [...] Scott and CEO Dave Mays because Ratcliffe gave then-upcoming artist Young Jeezy a rating of 4. After they refused to change the rating back to 4.5 he decided to step down from his editorial position.

5000|$|Reverse sweep (sweep-out): In case of {{shortfalls}} in {{the savings}} account to honour any debit instruction (e.g. when the customer wants to withdraw money through cheque or through ATM), {{the balance in}} the FD to the extent needed for meeting the shortfall is automatically withdrawn in multiples of Rs 1000 (or any other amount set by the bank). The remaining balance in the FD continues to earn higher interest at the <b>original</b> <b>rate</b> applicable to FDs. Hence in case the customer wants to withdraw more than what is deposited in the savings account component, the bank would withdraw money from the fixed deposit component.|$|E
50|$|The {{stiffness}} {{of the spring}} (shown in image below), the normal load at the interface (the weight of the slider), the duration of time the interface has existed (influencing chemical mass transport and bond formation), the <b>original</b> <b>rate</b> (velocity) of sliding (when the slider is in the slip phase) - all influence {{the behavior of the}} system. A description using common phonons (rather than constitutive laws like Coulomb's friction model) provides explanations for noise that generally accompanies stick-slip through surface acoustic waves. The use of complicated constitutive models that lead to discontinuous solutions (see Painlevé paradox) end up requiring unnecessary mathematical effort (to support non-smooth dynamical systems) and do not represent the true physical description of the system. However, such models are very useful for low fidelity simulations and animation.|$|E
50|$|In NBS Boland Bank v One Berg River Driver and Others, {{the court}} held that, save, perhaps, where a party is given the power to fix his own prestation, or to fix a {{purchase}} price or rental, a stipulation conferring upon a contractual party the right to determine a prestation is unobjectionable. This {{does not mean that}} an exercise of such a contractual discretion is necessarily unassailable; it may be voidable at the instance of the other party. It is a rule of the common law that, unless a contractual discretionary power is clearly intended to be completely unfettered, an exercise of such a discretion must be made arbitrio bono viri. The discretionary powers vested in mortgagees in terms of mortgage bonds conferring upon the mortgagees the right unilaterally to increase the <b>original</b> <b>rate</b> of interest payable by the mortgagor must therefore be subject to the aforesaid inherent limitation. Such a provision in a mortgage bond is therefore valid.|$|E

50|$|Suppose {{that the}} gambler's IOU falls in value from $300 to $200, {{so that the}} market value of the dollar is now given by the equation: 100+400E=600E, or E=0.5 oz/$. If the bank tries to {{maintain}} convertibility at the <b>original</b> <b>rate</b> of E=1.0 oz/$, it will face a bank run. Customers see that a dollar will fetch only 0.5 ounces of silver on the market, and so they all rush to the bank for the chance of getting 1 ounce for that dollar. The bank, for its part, loses 0.5 ounces for every dollar redeemed at this rate, and this loss of assets causes {{the value of the dollar}} to fall still more. For example, if the bank redeems $40 for 40 ounces, then setting assets equal to liabilities yields 60+400E=560E, implying E=0.375 oz./$. If the bank pays out its last 60 ounces of silver for $60, then the equation becomes 0+400E=500E, or E=0.|$|E
5000|$|In 2000, Konami bundled Gradius III and Gradius IV {{together}} for release on the PlayStation 2 video game console, as Gradius III and IV. The port {{is based on}} the arcade version and has an unlockable Extra Edit mode, which gives the player the freedom to create a weapon array from all included setups and adds the F-Option, R-Option and Reduce II power-ups found in the Super NES port. The Reduce from the SNES port returns the player one step closer to the Vic Viper's original size when hit, giving it protection from two hits. As the PlayStation 2 hardware is more capable than the game's original arcade hardware, in certain technically-demanding moments of the game the PlayStation 2 is able to maintain normal operating speed in situations that would normally introduce [...] "slowdown" [...] (half-speed operation) on the original hardware. To recreate this gameplay characteristic, KCET implemented an optional [...] "WAIT LEVEL" [...] regulator that can be adjusted from three levels at any point in the game, beginning from 0 to 2 (<b>original</b> <b>rate).</b> While the PS2 version doesn't have the option to continue as the Super NES version, it features the possibility to select any stage the player has cleared.|$|E
50|$|The film {{begins with}} an {{overhead}} view {{of a man and}} woman picnicking in a park at the Chicago lakefront — a one-meter-square overhead image of the figures on a blanket surrounded by food and books they brought with them, one of them being The Voices of Time by J. T. Fraser. The man then sleeps, while the woman starts to read one of the books. The viewpoint, accompanied by expository voiceover by Philip Morrison, then slowly zooms out to a view ten meters across (or 101 m in scientific notation). The zoom-out continues (at a rate of one power of ten per 10 seconds), to a view of 100 meters (102 m) (where they are shown to be in Burnham Park, near Soldier Field, then 1 kilometer (103 m) (where we see the entirety of Chicago), and so on, increasing the perspective and continuing to zoom out to a field of view of 1024 meters, or the size of the observable universe. The camera then zooms back in at a rate of a power of ten per 2 seconds to the picnic, and then slows back down to its <b>original</b> <b>rate</b> into the man's hand, to views of negative powers of ten—10−1 m (10 centimeters), and so forth—until the camera comes to quarks in a proton of a carbon atom at 10−16 meter.|$|E
