5|$|Chris Boucher {{began his}} {{television}} writing career in comedy, working on such programmes as Dave Allen at Large and Romany Jones, {{before moving on}} to write for drama series, including Shoestring, Juliet Bravo and Bergerac. He was no stranger to television science fiction, having written three serials for Doctor Who and having acted as script editor on the entire four season run of Blake's 7 as well as writing nine episodes for it himself. Boucher originally pitched Star Cops to the BBC in 1981 as a radio series but, with James Follet's epic Earthsearch serial in production that year, it was felt that science fiction was adequately served in the schedules and so Boucher tried to sell it to television instead. He sent the draft script of the first Star Cops story to Jonathan Powell, the Head of Drama at BBC television. Powell responded asking Boucher to write a second script and on the strength of this the series was commissioned. However, Powell insisted that the first story, which Boucher had intended to run over two episodes, be reworked into a single episode. This would be the first of many difficulties Boucher would have with how Star Cops was eventually realised for the screen. Boucher, who at this time was working as script editor <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> series Bergerac, was also told by Powell he could work on Star Cops or on Bergerac but not on both and so chose to leave Bergerac.|$|E

25|$|In 1951 {{only two}} of the five {{permanent}} members of the UN Security Council (UNSC) were parties to the CPPCG: France and the Republic of China. The CPPCG was ratified by the Soviet Union in 1954, the United Kingdom in 1970, the People's Republic of China in 1983 (having replaced the Taiwan-based Republic of China on the UNSC in 1971), and the United States in 1988.

25|$|Research {{suggests}} that {{immigration to the}} United States is beneficial to the US economy. With few exceptions, the evidence {{suggests that}} immigration on average has positive economic effects on the native population, but is mixed as to whether low-skilled immigration adversely affects low-skilled natives. Studies also indicate that immigration either has no impact <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> rate or that it reduces the crime rate in the United States. Research shows that the United States excels at assimilating first- and second-generation immigrants relative to many other Western countries.|$|E

25|$|Police {{investigated}} {{a conspiracy}} to kill Richards. A man was sentenced on 24 February 2003 to 25 {{years in prison for}} his role in a national cocaine ring, and it was also believed that he and others were linked to the slaying of James Richards. Richards kept tabs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> activity in his neighborhood and police believed others had conspired to kill him. It was alleged that Richards was killed because the people in the crime ring thought he was giving police information about their operations. The indictment indicated that Richards murder and the attempted murder of an unidentified man were meant to further the individuals criminal enterprise.|$|E
25|$|After {{the minimum}} 20 {{countries}} became {{parties to the}} Genocide Convention, it came into force as international law on 12 January 1951. At that time however, {{only two of the}} five permanent members of the UN Security Council were parties to the treaty, and it was not until after the last of the five permanent members ratified the treaty in 1988, and the Cold War came to an end, that the international law <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> of genocide began to be enforced. As such, the allegation that genocide took place during the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971 was never investigated by an international tribunal set up {{under the auspices of the}} United Nations.|$|E

25|$|The FBI, which {{continues}} to investigate the theft, has said {{it is no longer}} interested in identifying the thieves as the statute of limitations <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> expired in 1996 and no one can be prosecuted for it (although those knowingly in possession of the stolen works could still be charged for that offense). However, it apparently does not put much credence in the theory that Donati was behind the crime. Kurkjian writes that he shared the details of his conversation with the FBI {{agent in charge of the}} investigation, but at a news conference a month later, the agent did not mention Donati at all and apparently seemed to still be embracing an earlier FBI theory of the crime.|$|E
25|$|In 1933 Lemkin made a {{presentation}} to the Legal Council of the League of Nations conference on international criminal law in Madrid, for which he prepared an essay <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Crime</b> of Barbarity as a crime against international law. The concept of the crime, which later evolved into the idea of genocide, {{was based on the}} Armenian Genocide and prompted by the experience of Assyrians massacred in Iraq during the 1933 Simele massacre. In 1934 Lemkin, under pressure from the Polish Foreign Minister for comments made at the Madrid conference, resigned his position and became a private solicitor in Warsaw. While in Warsaw, Lemkin attended numerous lectures organized by the Free Polish University, including the classes of Emil Stanisław Rappaport and Wacław Makowski.|$|E

Copies of this report are submitted to the contact officer, the forensic entomologist, and as a courtesy, to the medical examiner. If throughout the course of the investigation, any manipulation of the specimens occurred (i.e. dissecting, rearing, then a copy of the specimen disposition and identification form should also be included in the report).|$|E
25|$|In March 2009, EA {{launched}} a Facebook app, called The Godfather II: Crime Rings to help promote the game. Based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> ring mechanic from the game, the app allowed players {{to create a}} mobster and take over rackets, building crime rings and eventually becoming Don. Players were randomly placed {{into one of the}} five families from the game (Corleone, Rosato, Granados, Mangano and Almeida) upon joining the app. In early April, EA sent out brass knuckles to game journalists to promote the game. However, brass knuckles are illegal to own in several states. Realizing their mistake, EA requested everyone who received the knuckles return them. On April 9, EA opened a space for The Godfather II on the PlayStation 3's online service PlayStation Home. The space offered users five poker tables for No Limit Texas hold 'em, with promotional videos and concept art available for viewing.|$|E
25|$|On March 17, 1994, Stanfa and 23 of his {{men were}} arrested on {{racketeering}} related chargers. This was the second major indictment <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> family in seven years. The Federal case was the largest prosecution of an organized crime group in Philadelphia history. The second major indictment against the crime family was another strong case for the prosecution. A key piece of evidence was two years of recorded conversations Stanfa would have with mobsters in his attorney's office and doctor's office. Believing attorney–client privilege and doctor-patient confidentiality would protect him, Stanfa openly talked about important Mafia business with his men. However, the FBI {{was able to get}} a warrant to place covert listening devices in both offices once they figured out they were being used to aid criminal conspiracies. The secretly recorded conversations implicated Stanfa and his men of many criminal acts. The star witness at the trial was John Veasey, who was recruited by Stanfa to fight in the war against Merlino and eventually was inducted into the family. Before this, Veasey had no connection to the Mafia or organized crime.|$|E
