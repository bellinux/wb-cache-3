5000|$|G.718 is an ITU-T {{recommendation}} embedded scalable {{speech and}} audio codec providing high quality narrowband (250 Hz to 3.5 kHz) speech over the lower bit rates and high quality wideband (50 Hz to 7 kHz) speech over the complete range of bit rates. In addition, G.718 {{is designed to}} be highly robust to frame erasures, thereby enhancing the speech quality when used in internet protocol (IP) transport applications on fixed, wireless and mobile networks. Despite its embedded nature, the codec also performs well with both narrowband and wideband generic audio signals.The codec has an embedded scalable structure, enabling maximum flexibility in the transport of voice packets through IP networks of today and in future media-aware networks. In addition, the embedded structure of G.718 will easily allow the codec to be extended to provide a superwideband (50 Hz to 14 kHz) and stereo capability through additional layers which are currently under development in ITU-T Study Group 16. The bitstream may be truncated at the decoder side or by any component of the communication system to instantaneously adjust the bit rate to the desired value without the need for <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signalling.</b> The encoder produces an embedded bitstream structured in five layers corresponding to the five available bit rates: 8, 12, 16, 24 & 32 kbit/s.|$|E
5000|$|When Mission Control (in Houston, Texas) {{wanted to}} talk to astronauts, the capsule {{communicator}} (CAPCOM) pushed a button (push-to-talk, or PTT) that turned on the transmitter, then spoke, then released the button. When the transmitter is local, this is easy to arrange - the transmitter is connected directly to the PTT button. But to stay in continuous contact with the astronauts as they orbit the Earth, or travel to the Moon, NASA had to use tracking stations all around the world, switching from one station to the next as needed. To get the voice signal to the remote transmitter, dedicated telephone lines connected these stations to Houston. NASA could either build a parallel system for operating the transmitters - one line to carry the audio and another to carry the control signal for the PTT button (<b>out-of-band</b> <b>signalling),</b> or combine these two systems together, using audio tones to turn the transmitter on and off. Since dedicated phone lines were a very expensive measure at the time, NASA chose the use of tones to reduce the operating cost of the network. [...] The same system was used in Project Gemini and was still in use with half duplex UHF Space Shuttle communications for transmitter RF keying.|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, we {{investigate}} {{the use of}} ultra low-power receivers to perform power efficient communications by exploring two orthogonal approaches to the problem. First, by using the DCF 77 time-code signal, {{we are able to}} synchronize a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) to within (3. 3 Â± 1. 3) ms accuracy, without the use of the conventional radio. We identify the limiting factor to be the time-code decoding chip and an analysis reveals that with a more efficient decoding chip the platform supports Âµs precision. We subsequently use this global synchronization in our scalable, self-configuring, scheduled communication protocol, and achieve a power consumption equivalent to a duty-cycle of the primary radio of 0. 4 %- 0. 001 %, which is at least an order of magnitude better than similar protocols. This combination of out-of-band synchronization together with self-configuration makes deployment and joining a WSN completely transparent. Secondly, we explore the use of <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signalling</b> to reduce latency and improve duty-cycling by implementing a low-power, low transmission rate secondary radio. We show that we can achieve 73 ms latency with one-hundredth of the amount of energy normally required to have no latency in the network. By using this secondary radio to facilitate deployment and joining a WSN we achieve a similar reduction of power consumption. When used in power efficient discovery, however, we find that the low-power consumption will eventually become a significant problem, and regular scheduled communication based on timers will be more energy efficient. By combining the secondary radio with scheduled communication into a Scheduled Discovery Protocol we achieve a scalable, self-configuring, protocol that outperforms even our scheduled communication protocol based on DCF 77 synchronization...|$|E
40|$|Orthogonal {{frequency}} division multiplexing (OFDM) has recently become a dominant transmission technology {{considered for the}} next generation fixed and mobile broadband wireless communication systems. OFDM has an advantage of lessening the severe effects of the frequency-selective (multipath) fading due to the band splitting into relatively flat fading subchannels, and allows for low-complexity transceiver implementation based on the fast Fourier transform algorithms. Combining OFDM modulation with multilevel frequency-domain symbol mapping (e. g., QAM) and spatial multiplexing (SM) over the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels, can theoretically achieve near Shannon capacity of the communication link. However, the high-rate and spectrumefficient system implementation requires coherent detection at the receiving end that is possible only when accurate channel state information (CSI) is available. Since in practice, the response of the wireless channel is unknown and is subject to random variation with time, the receiver typically employs a channel estimator for CSI acquisition. The channel response information retrieved by the estimator is then used by the data detector and can also be fed back to the transmitter by means of in-band or <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signalling,</b> so the latter could adapt power loading, modulation and coding parameters according to the channel conditions. Thus, design of an accurate and robust channel estimator is a crucial requirement for reliable communication through the channel, which is selective in time and frequency. In a MIMO configuration, a separate channel estimator has to be associated with each transmit/receive antenna pair, making the estimation algorithm complexity a primary concern. Pilot-assisted methods, relying on the insertion of reference symbols in certain frequencies and time slots, have been found attractive for identification of the doubly-selective radio channels from both the complexity and performance standpoint. In this dissertation, a family of the reduced-complexity estimators for the single and multiple-antenna OFDM systems is developed. The estimators are based on the transform-domain processing and have the same order of computational complexity, irrespective of the number of pilot subcarriers and their positioning. The common estimator structure represents a cascade of successive small-dimension filtering modules. The number of modules, as well as their order inside the cascade, is determined by the class of the estimator (one or two-dimensional) and availability of the channel statistics (correlation and signal-to-noise power ratio). For fine precision estimation in the multipath channels with statistics not known a priori, we propose recursive design of the filtering modules. Simulation results show that in the steady state, performance of the recursive estimators approaches that of their theoretical counterparts, which are optimal in the minimum mean square error (MMSE) sense. In contrast to the majority of the channel estimators developed so far, our modular-type architectures are suitable for the reconfigurable OFDM transceivers where the actual channel conditions influence the decision of what class of filtering algorithm to use, and how to allot pilot subcarrier positions in the band. In the pilot-assisted transmissions, channel estimation and detection are performed separately from each other over the distinct subcarrier sets. The estimator output is used only to construct the detector transform, but not as the detector input. Since performance of both channel estimation and detection depends on the signal-to-noise power vi ratio (SNR) at the corresponding subcarriers, there is a dilemma of the optimal power allocation between the data and the pilot symbols as these are conflicting requirements under the total transmit power constraint. The problem is exacerbated by the variety of channel estimators. Each kind of estimation algorithm is characterised by its own SNR gain, which in general can vary depending on the channel correlation. In this dissertation, we optimise pilot-data power allocation for the case of developed low-complexity one and two-dimensional MMSE channel estimators. The resultant contribution is manifested by the closed-form analytical expressions of the upper bound (suboptimal approximate value) on the optimal pilot-to-data power ratio (PDR) as a function of a number of design parameters (number of subcarriers, number of pilots, number of transmit antennas, effective order of the channel model, maximum Doppler shift, SNR, etc.). The resultant PDR equations {{can be applied to the}} MIMO-OFDM systems with arbitrary arrangement of the pilot subcarriers, operating in an arbitrary multipath fading channel. These properties and relatively simple functional representation of the derived analytical PDR expressions are designated to alleviate the challenging task of on-the-fly optimisation of the adaptive SM-MIMO-OFDM system, which is capable of adjusting transmit signal configuration (e. g., block length, number of pilot subcarriers or antennas) according to the established channel conditions...|$|E
