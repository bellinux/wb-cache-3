5|$|The levade: a {{position}} wherein the horse raises up both front legs, {{standing at a}} 30-degree angle entirely <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>hind</b> legs in a controlled form that requires {{a great deal of}} hindquarter strength. A less difficult but related movement is the pesade, where the horse rises up to a 45-degree angle.|$|E
5|$|Although Stegosaurus is {{undoubtedly}} now {{considered to have}} been quadrupedal, some discussion has occurred over whether it could have reared up <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>hind</b> legs, using its tail to form a tripod with its hind limbs, and browsing for higher foliage. This has been proposed by Bakker and opposed by Carpenter. A study by Mallison (2010) found support a rearing up posture in Kentrosaurus, though not for ability for the tail {{to act as a}} tripod.|$|E
5|$|Amargasaurus was quadrupedal (moved on four legs), and {{probably}} {{was unable to}} rear <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>hind</b> legs. Salgado and Bonaparte (1991) suggested that Amargasaurus was a slow walker, as both the forearms and lower legs were proportionally short, as a feature common to slow-moving animals. This was contradicted by Gerardo Mazzetta and Richard Fari√±a (1999), who argued that Amargasaurus was capable of rapid locomotion. During locomotion, leg bones are strongly affected by bending moments, representing a limiting factor for the maximum speed of an animal. The leg bones of Amargasaurus were even more sturdy than those of today's white rhinoceros, which is adapted to galloping.|$|E
5000|$|When perceiving danger, O. wiegmanni spurts {{away quickly}} <b>on</b> <b>its</b> large <b>hind</b> legs and might {{eventually}} climb up a sapling or tree.|$|R
50|$|Named for its pale-furred {{back and}} long hind limbs and feet, the pale {{kangaroo}} mouse is a large-headed rodent with fur-lined external cheek pouche. This species is bipedal, {{meaning that it}} generally moves around <b>on</b> <b>its</b> strong <b>hind</b> legs, hopping much like a kangaroo.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Meerkats adopt a {{range of}} postures while {{watching}} for predators. One individual (left) has 4 limbs {{in contact with the}} ground, another (middle) has only 2 limbs and the tail in contact, and another (right) is standing erect <b>on</b> <b>its</b> 2 <b>hind</b> legs and supported by the tail.|$|R
5|$|Despite being quadrupedal the {{ring-tailed lemur}} can rear up and balance <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>hind</b> legs, usually for {{aggressive}} displays. When threatened the ring-tailed lemur may {{jump in the}} air and strike out with its short nails and sharp upper canine teeth in a behaviour termed jump fighting. This is extremely rare outside of the breeding season when tensions are high and competition for mates is intense. Other aggressive behaviours include a threat-stare, used to intimidate or start a fight, and a submissive gesture known as pulled-back lips.|$|E
5|$|A full-grown Scelidosaurus {{was rather}} small {{compared}} to most later non-avian dinosaurs, {{but it was a}} medium-sized species in the Early Jurassic. Some scientists have estimated a length of 4metres (13ft). In 2010, Gregory S. Paul gave a body length of 3.8 metres (12.5ft) and a weight of 270 kilogrammes. Scelidosaurus was quadrupedal, with the hindlimbs longer than the forelimbs. It may have reared up <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>hind</b> legs to browse on foliage from trees, but its arms were relatively long, indicating a mostly quadrupedal posture. A trackway from the Holy Cross Mountains of Poland shows a scelidosaur like animal walking in a bipedal manner, hinting that Scelidosaurus may have been more proficient at bipedalism than previously thought.|$|E
5|$|Brachiosaurus is {{the first}} dinosaur seen by the park's visitors. It is inaccurately {{depicted}} as chewing its food, and standing up <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>hind</b> legs to browse among the high tree branches. According to artist Andy Schoneberg, the chewing was done to make the animal seem docile, {{in a way it}} resembled a cow chewing its cud. The dinosaur's head and upper neck was the largest puppet without hydraulics built for the film. Despite scientific evidence of their having limited vocal capabilities, sound designer Gary Rydstrom decided to represent them with whale songs and donkey calls to give them a melodic sense of wonder. Penguins were also recorded {{to be used in the}} noises of the dinosaurs.|$|E
50|$|From {{the scant}} remains the living animal {{would appear to}} have been about three metres long (10 ft), with a {{typically}} prosauropodan appearance: bulky body, long neck, small head and clawed feet. Like other prosauropods, it was probably equally comfortable on all fours as well as <b>on</b> <b>its</b> elongated <b>hind</b> legs. It was herbivorous or may have been an omnivore.|$|R
5000|$|The idea of {{a boxing}} {{kangaroo}} originates from the animal's defensive behavior, in which it will use its smaller forelegs (its [...] "arms") to hold an attacker in place while using the claws <b>on</b> <b>its</b> larger <b>hind</b> legs to try to kick, slash or disembowel them. This stance {{gives the impression that}} the kangaroo appears to be [...] "boxing" [...] with its attacker.|$|R
5000|$|Polychrus gutturosus, {{also known}} as Berthold's bush anole, is a species of lizard found {{throughout}} tropical Central and South America. It is {{sometimes referred to as}} a [...] "forest iguana". It lives in forests and jungles from Honduras to Ecuador. It ranges from 24-34 inches from head to tail. This insectivorous iguana is a climbing species that can often be seen holding onto branches. It can even hold <b>on</b> with <b>its</b> <b>hind</b> legs, though it moves slowly that way.|$|R
5|$|Deimatic {{displays}} {{are made}} by insects including the praying mantises (Mantidae) and stick insects (Phasmatodea). While undisturbed, these insects are usually well camouflaged. When disturbed by a potential predator, they suddenly reveal their hind wings, which are brightly coloured. In mantises, the wing display is sometimes reinforced by showing brightly coloured front legs, and accompanied by a loud hissing sound created by stridulation. For example, the grasshopper Phymateus displays red and yellow areas <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>hind</b> wings; it is also aposematic, producing a distasteful secretion from its thorax. Similarly the threat display of the walking stick phasmid (Peruphasma schultei) is not a bluff: the insect sprays defensive dolichodial-like monoterpene chemical compounds at attackers.|$|E
5|$|The African {{elephant}} has two finger-like extensions {{at the tip}} of {{the trunk}} that allow it to grasp and bring food to its mouth. The Asian elephant has only one, and relies more on wrapping around a food item and squeezing it into its mouth. Asian elephants have more muscle coordination and can perform more complex tasks. Losing the trunk would be detrimental to an elephant's survival, although in rare cases, individuals have survived with shortened ones. One elephant has been observed to graze by kneeling on its front legs, raising <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>hind</b> legs and taking in grass with its lips. Floppy trunk syndrome is a condition of trunk paralysis in African bush elephants caused by the degradation of the peripheral nerves and muscles beginning at the tip.|$|E
5|$|As {{described}} in a 2016 study, examination of melanosomes preserved in the specimen of Psittacosaurus preserved with integument indicated that the animal was countershaded, likely due to preferring a habitat in dense forests with little light, much like many modern species of forest-dwelling deer and antelope; stripes and spots on the limbs may represent disruptive coloration. The specimen also had dense clusters of pigment on its shoulders, face (possibly for display), and cloaca (which may have had an antimicrobial function), as well as large patagia <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>hind</b> legs that connected {{to the base of}} the tail. Its large eyes indicate that it also likely had good vision, which would have been useful in finding food or avoiding predators. The authors pointed out that there might have been variation in coloration across the range of the animal, depending on differences in the light environment. The authors were unable to determine which species of Jehol Formation Psittacosaurus the specimen belonged to due to the way the skull is preserved, but ruled out P. mongoliensis, based on hip features.|$|E
50|$|This small rodent is {{sometimes}} likened {{to a tiny}} kangaroo due to <b>its</b> incredibly large <b>hind</b> legs, and hopping form of locomotion. The lesser Egyptian jerboa has three toes <b>on</b> each of <b>its</b> <b>hind</b> feet and a very long tail, used for balance when jumping. It has large eyes and ears and a rather stubby snout, and its coat is a pale or dark sandy colour with a paler underside.|$|R
60|$|Aside {{from the}} marble statues of Unc Nunkie and Margolotte, the Glass Cat was there, {{curled up on}} a rug; and the Woozy was there, sitting <b>on</b> <b>its</b> square <b>hind</b> legs and looking on the scene with solemn interest; {{and there was the}} Shaggy Man, in a suit of shaggy pea-green satin, and at a table sat the little Wizard, looking quite {{important}} and as if he knew much more than he cared to tell.|$|R
60|$|They came along, looking {{neither to}} right nor to left, {{as the three}} men had hoped they would, {{and they were all}} but past, when {{suddenly}} Wilding gave his roan a touch of the spur and bounded forward. Diana's horse swerved so that it nearly threw her. Ruth, slightly ahead, reined in at once; so, too, did the groom in the rear, and so violently in his sudden fear of highwaymen that he brought his horse <b>on</b> to <b>its</b> <b>hind</b> legs and had it prancing and rearing madly about the road, so that he was hard put to it to keep his seat.|$|R
5|$|Since the {{practical}} function of striping {{has not been}} determined for zebras in general, it is unclear why the quagga lacked stripes <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>hind</b> parts. A cryptic function for protection from predators (stripes obscure the individual zebra in a herd) and biting flies (which are less attracted to striped objects), as well as various social functions, have been proposed for zebras in general. Differences in hind quarter stripes may have aided species recognition during stampedes of mixed herds, so that members of one subspecies or species would follow its own kind. It has also been evidence that the zebras developed striping patterns as thermoregulation to cool themselves down, and that the quagga lost them due to living in a cooler climate, although one problem with {{this is that the}} mountain zebra lives in similar environments and has a bold striping pattern. A 2014 study strongly supported the biting-fly hypothesis, and the quagga appears to have lived in areas with lesser amounts of fly activity compared to other zebras.|$|E
25|$|In {{the warmer}} summer months, common box turtles {{are more likely}} to be seen near the edges of swamps or marshlands, {{possibly}} in an effort to stay cool. If common box turtles do become too hot, (when their body temperature rises to around 32¬∞C), they smear saliva over their legs and head; as the saliva evaporates it leaves them comfortably cooler. Similarly, the turtle may urinate <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>hind</b> limbs to cool the body parts it is unable to cover with saliva.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} Rosa story {{featuring}} The Three Caballeros, Donald Duck is {{shocked by the}} sight of a capybara standing <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>hind</b> legs, with shrubs, leaves and fruit in front of its body, coincidentally making it look like Mickey Mouse. Jos√© Carioca and Panchito Pistoles, never having seen Mickey Mouse, ask Donald what is wrong, but Donald replies he is just tired. Later in the same story, the Caballeros free several animals from a poacher. One panel shows the animals fleeing; Mickey can be seen among them.|$|E
5000|$|This {{species is}} found in dry steppes and {{semi-desert}} brushlands. It lives either communally or singly in burrows where it hibernates in winter and aestivates in excessive summer heat. The entrance to the burrow is often found {{at the base of}} a bush. The diet is primarily vegetarian consisting of seasonal plant growth [...] including young shoots of certain shrubs, bulbs and tubers. Unlike some other related species, Brandt's ground squirrel seldom stands erect <b>on</b> <b>its</b> two <b>hind</b> legs and <b>its</b> alarm cry is a quiet squeak.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of {{the statue}} of Andrew Jackson in New Orleans, Louisiana, [s. d. ]. Above the center, a large statue is {{positioned}} on a large block of concrete; the statue shows a man, wearing a uniform while holding up a hat in one hand, sitting {{on the back of a}} horse that is standing <b>on</b> <b>its</b> two <b>hind</b> legs. In the foreground, a sidewalk and a metal fence run together along the site; small bushes can be seen surrounding the statue. Streetlights can also be seen around the site. Buildings are observable in the background...|$|R
50|$|Antheraea polyphemus (polyphemus moth) is a North American {{member of}} the family Saturniidae, the giant silk moths. It is a tan-colored moth, with an average {{wingspan}} of 15 cm (6 in). The most notable feature of the moth is its large, purplish eyespots <b>on</b> <b>its</b> two <b>hind</b> wings. The eye spots give it its name - from the Greek myth of the Cyclops Polyphemus. The species is widespread in continental North America, with local populations found throughout subarctic Canada and the United States. The caterpillar can eat 86,000 times its weight at emergence in a little less than two months.|$|R
25|$|Stein {{published}} {{an article on the}} biomechanics of Pteranodon flight. He crafted model Pteranodon wings and tested them in a wind tunnel. He found that Pteranodon was a capable, maneuverable flyer but was best adapted to long distance flights at low velocities. Stein calculated that a large Pteranodon would have to fly at least 10 miles an hour to stay airborne. He concluded that Pteranodon would have had to land <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>hind</b> feet because making the front feet ready for landing would collapse the wings, which would no longer be useful for keeping the pterosaur aloft. Stein's conclusions contradicted the previous findings of Bramwell and Whitfield.|$|E
25|$|Though {{capable of}} sprinting, the cougar is {{typically}} an ambush predator. It stalks through brush and trees, across ledges, or other covered spots, before delivering a powerful leap {{onto the back}} of its prey and a suffocating neck bite. The cougar is capable of breaking the neck of some of its smaller prey with a strong bite and momentum bearing the animal to the ground. The head of the cat is round and the ears are erect. Its powerful forequarters, neck, and jaw serve to grasp and hold large prey. It has five retractable claws on its forepaws (one a dewclaw) and four <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>hind</b> paws. The larger front feet and claws are adaptations to clutching prey.|$|E
25|$|The {{entrance}} to the hall showcases six fossil shark jaws, ranging in height from 2‚Äì9 feet. The exhibition begins with five extinction events described in dioramas that lead visitors onto the Florida Platform at about 66 million years ago, {{also known as the}} Dawn of the Age of Mammals. Displays include a primitive-toothed whale in the Eocene, a pig-like, extinct mammal from the Oligocene, a Miocene rhinoceros being attacked by two saber-toothed, cat-like animals, a -tall sloth standing <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>hind</b> legs in the Pliocene area and a 500,000-year-old jaguar chasing a peccary from the Pleistocene epoch. The time periods also include artwork by paleoartists from around the world, including a -tall steel sculpture of an extinct Terror Bird, Titanis walleri.|$|E
50|$|Megatherium had {{a robust}} {{skeleton}} {{with a large}} pelvic girdle and a broad muscular tail. Its large size enabled it to feed at heights unreachable by other contemporary herbivores. Rising <b>on</b> <b>its</b> powerful <b>hind</b> legs and using its tail to form a tripod, Megatherium could support its massive body weight while using the curved claws <b>on</b> <b>its</b> long forelegs to pull down branches with the choicest leaves. This sloth, like a modern anteater, walked {{on the sides of}} its feet because its claws prevented it from putting them flat on the ground. Although it was primarily a quadruped, its trackways show that it was capable of bipedal locomotion. Biomechanical analysis also suggests it had adaptations to bipedalism.|$|R
50|$|The car's badging {{is based}} on the city of Turin's coat of arms. The symbol is a bull {{standing}} <b>on</b> <b>its</b> two <b>hind</b> legs, mimicking the prancing stallion symbol of Ferrari. The Argentine car's front end, rear fascia, and interior were redesigned by Italian auto stylists at Pininfarina to give it a more European look, as well as to make the Torino more appealing to the Argentine public and less like an American car. With the added exterior styling touches, as well as its unique trim and luxurious interior appointments, and Argentine built Kaiser-Jeep OHC six, the Torino was truly a product of Argentina.|$|R
5000|$|Pterochroza ocellata, {{the peacock}} katydid, is an insect {{in the family}} Tettigoniidae. The species is a leaf-mimic katydid; when it is in repose its {{camouflage}} resembles a diseased or dead leaf. The katydid owes both its common name and its specific epithet (ocellata, meaning [...] "marked with little eyes") to its startle display, in which it shows false eye spots <b>on</b> <b>its</b> normally hidden <b>hind</b> wings.|$|R
25|$|Within the top roundel the Evangelist {{is shown}} holding a stylus {{in his right}} hand and an open Gospel book he holds in his left hand. His beast symbol within the arch {{consists}} of a full-figure, three-quarter profile figure of a winged horned calf/ox standing <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>hind</b> hooves. The hindquarters of this beast symbol appears to have been borrowed or copied from elsewhere, and the upper half of the calf was influenced by either a Carolingian or Mediterranean exemplar or model, thereby creating a hybrid image. The capitals from which the arches spring consist of simple double tablet capitals painted in reddish brown and blue. Here again, the flanking columns rest directly on the floor or ground lacking bases. The Latin inscriptions for this miniature read: top = ‚Äú+ HIC LUCAS IN HUMANITATE‚Äù (‚ÄúHere Luke is in his human form‚Äù), and bottom ‚Äú+ HIC LVCAS FORMAM ACCEPIT VITULI‚Äù (‚ÄúHere Luke has taken the shape of a calf‚Äù).|$|E
25|$|During {{the main}} season of its activity, May through September, the {{entrance}} to the nesting sites of P. gibbosus can be characterized by the scattered heaps of sand or soil around their supporting structure, usually bricks or tree roots. The sand heaps are very low and spread out. In building these sand heaps, females can be observed backing out of the burrow with moist sand or soil that is spread around into the heaps using jerks of her front legs. While burrowing, P. gibbosus stands <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>hind</b> legs. In order to dig the actual burrow, P. gibbosus uses its tarsi and mandibles to dig a shaft that is at least two feet in length. The shaft culminates in an oval shaped cell in which eggs are provisioned. Other oval shaped cells line the shaft which are smaller in size and contain the skeletons of other bees that were killed and fed to the larvae as nutrients.|$|E
25|$|Later, Zuo Ci went to Cao Cao, who granted him {{a pension}} {{to do his}} magics. Cao Cao may have shown an {{interest}} in the Taoist approach to longevity by doing this, but his son Cao Zhi wrote that the pensions are only intended to keep the magicians and their wild teachings under control. Zuo Ci performed a number of magic acts in Cao Cao's court, such as catching an exotic fish from an empty copper pan, and teleporting far away to buy ginger. Zuo Ci once fed a whole court assembly with food and wine, but Cao Cao soon found out that Zuo Ci had emptied every wine shop in the region with his magic for this purpose. Cao Cao tried to execute Zuo Ci, but Zuo escaped by walking through walls. When someone reported that Zuo Ci had been sighted in the market, everyone in the market became identical to Zuo's appearance. Another report said Zuo Ci went to the mountaintop, so Cao Cao and his men went, and realised Zuo was concealed among a flock of sheep. Knowing he could not find him, Cao Cao announced to the flock of sheep that he was merely trying to test Zuo Ci's skill, and had no intention to kill him. At the moment, a goat stood <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>hind</b> legs and spoke. Cao Cao's men rushed to the goat, only to find the rest of the flock also turned into goats and started standing and speaking like humans. Zuo Ci was never found by Cao Cao's men again.|$|E
50|$|Spix‚Äôs disk-winged bat (Thyroptera tricolor), is an insectivorous {{species of}} bat {{in the family}} Thyropteridae. Although this species is {{unevenly}} dispersed, it is widespread and is therefore considered as having a ‚Äúleast concern‚Äù status on the conservation list. The most prominent anatomical feature of this bat, separating it from other bats, {{is the presence of}} disks <b>on</b> <b>its</b> thumbs and <b>hind</b> feet. These circular disks act as suction cups, allowing the bats to cling onto and move along smooth surfaces.|$|R
5000|$|The {{armadillo}} has two massive sets of claws <b>on</b> <b>its</b> {{front and}} <b>hind</b> limbs help it to dig the burrows in compacted soil very quickly. The pink fairy armadillo is nicknamed the [...] "sand-swimmer" [...] {{because it is}} said that it can [...] "burrow through the ground as fast as a fish can swim in the sea." [...] These claws are very big relatively to the size of this animal which makes it difficult for it to walk on a hard surface.|$|R
60|$|Bradley was in {{the lead}} when he came {{suddenly}} upon a grotesque creature of Titanic proportions. Crouching among the trees, which here commenced to thin out slightly, Bradley saw {{what appeared to be}} an enormous dragon devouring the carcass of a mammoth. From frightful jaws to the tip of its long tail it was fully forty feet in length. Its body was covered with plates of thick skin which bore a striking resemblance to armor-plate. The creature saw Bradley almost at the same instant that he saw it and reared up <b>on</b> <b>its</b> enormous <b>hind</b> legs until <b>its</b> head towered a full twenty-five feet above the ground. From the cavernous jaws issued a hissing sound of a volume equal to the escaping steam from the safety-valves of half a dozen locomotives, and then the creature came for the man.|$|R
