40|$|A lot of {{attention}} is being paid to wind energy due to the focus on renewable energy. Malaysia is situated in the equatorial region and its climate is governed by the monsoons. Wind resource in Malaysia varies from one location to another.

40|$|<b>Wind</b> <b>power,</b> as a {{renewable}} source of energy, produces no emissions {{and is an}} excellent alternative in environmental terms to conventional electricity production based on fuels such as oil, coal or natural gas. At present, {{the vast majority of}} <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> is generated from onshore wind farms. However, their growth is limited by the lack of inexpensive land near major population centers and the visual pollution caused by large wind turbines. Comparing with onshore <b>wind</b> <b>power,</b> <b>offshore</b> <b>winds</b> tend to flow at higher speeds than onshore winds, thus it allows turbines to produce more electricity. Estimates predict a huge increase in wind energy development over the next 20 years. Much of this development will be <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> energy. This implies that great investment will be done in <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> farms over the next decades.

25|$|<b>Offshore</b> <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> or {{offshore}} wind energy {{is the use of}} wind farms constructed offshore, usually on the continental shelf, to harvest wind energy to generate electricity. Higher wind speeds are available offshore compared to on land, so {{offshore wind}} power’s contribution in terms of electricity supplied is higher, and NIMBY opposition to construction is usually much weaker. The cost of <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> has historically been higher than that of onshore wind generation, but in 2016 had decreased to €54.5/MWh the 700 MW Borssele 3&4 due to government tender and size.

30|$|<b>Offshore</b> <b>wind</b> {{parks are}} <b>power</b> plants {{on the sea}} that produce {{electricity}} from renewable source wind.

Moreover, the lifetime of <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> farms is characterised by different phases that are considered somewhat in isolation in relation to each other, e.g. construction, production, installation and O&M; however, considerable spill-over is present between phases and can therefore be viewed as network systems (Houman et al. 2014; Autio and Thomas 2014).|$|R
40|$|An {{accurate}} {{estimate of}} the long-term wind speed is essential to site an <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> farm effectively.

40|$|<b>Offshore</b> {{and coastal}} <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> {{is one of}} the fastest growing {{industries}} in many areas, especially those with shallow coastal regions due to the preferable generation conditions available in the regions.

40|$|Abstract — Better {{modelling}} {{of power}} fluctuations at large <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> farms may significantly enhance control and management strategies {{of their power}} output. The paper introduces a new methodology for modelling and forecasting the short-term (i. e. few minutes ahead) fluctuations of wind generation. This methodology {{is based on a}} Markov-switching autoregressive model with time-varying coefficients. An advantage of the method is that one can easily derive full predictive densities along with the usually generated point forecasts. The quality of this methodology is demonstrated from the test case of two large <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> farms in Denmark. The exercise consists in 1 -step ahead forecasting exercise on time-series of wind generation with a time resolution of 10 minutes. The interest of such modelling approach for better understanding power fluctuations is finally discussed.

40|$|Operation and Maintenance (O&M) {{contributes}} {{a significant}} {{share of the}} expenses during the lifetime of <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> farms. When compared to onshore wind, O&M costs are increased, due {{to the use of}} specialised vessels, shorter weather windows and challenging environmental conditions. Furthermore, increased frequency of failures, longer downtime and limited accessibility create uncertainties in the planning stage of the O&M tasks. In order to decrease the cost of power generation and increase the competitiveness of <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> industry against other alternative energy sectors, it is essential to keep the costs of the vessel fleet used for O&M tasks at minimum level while providing sufficient support to sustain power generation. In order to address these issues, the focus {{of this paper is to}} provide decision support for the selection of a Crew Transfer Vessel (CTV) fleet for the <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> farm maintenance operations. This is achieved through analyses of environmental conditions, investigation of failures, and assessment of vessel operations. The developed methodology and analysis enable operators to decide the specification of CTVs which will bring the optimum financial benefit, considering both the enhancement of the <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> farm <b>power</b> generation as well as the minimisation of the total O&M cost...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{develop a}} {{combined}} social constructivist, {{internal and external}} conceptualisation {{of the process of}} realising <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> farms, and to investigate costs, time, delays and operational performance results of <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> farm <b>power</b> plant projects in Denmark and Sweden with a view to possible strategic misrepresentation. Design/methodology/approach: Desk study of a sample of seven Danish and Swedish <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> farms using triangulation of publicly available material. Findings: Some of the wind farm projects are successful and some less successful. In the latter group, budget and time overruns and under-performance are found. The paper discusses specific elements of possible strategic misrepresentation but finds a contradictory pattern. Also competences developed on the basis of experience do not produce clear results, since more recent wind farm performance is poorer than earlier. Research limitations/implications: If desk research were combined with other methods, {{it would be possible to}} detect projects’ internal phenomena better. Practical implications: There is a need to improve the efficiency of the wind farm building process and to improve the quality of <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> turbines, their foundations and cabling.
