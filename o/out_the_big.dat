25|$|Proponents of {{this tactic}} claimed interceptions {{in large numbers}} caused greater enemy losses while {{reducing}} their own casualties. Opponents pointed <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> wings would take too long to form up, and the strategy ran {{a greater risk of}} fighters being caught on the ground refuelling. The big wing idea also caused pilots to overclaim their kills, due to the confusion of a more intense battle zone. This led to the belief big wings were far more effective than they were.|$|E

Even though Mags struggled with the screen test and has no formal cooking training, she was declared the winner of heat 2 and Rita was granted a wild card.|$|E
500|$|... "Birthday" [...] {{contains}} elements of funk-pop, synthpop, and disco house. The song {{is backed by}} a [...] "busy but buoyant" [...] instrumentation featuring a [...] "deeply rhythmic impulse". Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times felt [...] "Birthday" [...] was a musically updated version of disco, achieved by replacing [...] "cheesy strings" [...] with [...] "jerky breaks and synth washes". Its [...] "joyful" [...] lyrics present the commemoration of her partner's birthday {{as a metaphor for}} sexual intercourse.

He stated, [...] "After that, trust me, when a gale came up we dropped the hook [...] We dropped the hook because they found <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> ones could sink." [...] Mark Thompson wrote, [...] "Since the loss of the Fitz, some captains may be more prone to go to anchor, rather than venturing out in a severe storm, but there are still too many who like to portray themselves as 'heavy weather sailors.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Larry Flick from The Advocate {{denounced the}} track as an [...] "'Into the Groove' redux". He {{added that the}} song [...] "propels the {{listener}} into Spears' collaborations with heavy-hitting producers. There's nary a hint of her pristine pop past on Kelly's hip-grinding 'Outrageous' or Perry's 'Girls & Boys'. Instead Spears swims through dark, often hip-hop hued waters with occasional forays into minor keyed electro dance terrain." [...] Ali Fenwick of The Johns Hopkins News-Letter said, [...] "Despite bringing <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> guns in a duet with Madonna, 'Me Against The Music' is not danceable, the measure of success in any pop tune." [...] Linda McGee of RTÉ.ie commented that {{although much of the}} content of In the Zone is [...] "catchy", [...] "it is hard to see any potential singles impressing as much as 'Me Against The Music'." [...] Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times deemed it as [...] "an odd, overstuffed track, not so much a song as a series of party chants". Mim Udovitch of Blender called it [...] "lackluster".|$|E
500|$|Regarding {{the third}} round, Keller said the bout {{was a dream}} match for some with [...] "lots of cool spots from start to finish", but that it had [...] "little context early" [...] and was more just a [...] "bunch of spots."

[...] As for the final round, Keller commented that [...] "it had some spectacular (and ridiculously dangerous looking) spots", but that it ended up [...] "feeling short for a match of that caliber." [...] Caldwell stated that the third round bout was [...] "entertaining yet quite long" [...] and that the [...] "crowd was super into Sabin and Shelley." [...] He also said that after the match settled into [...] "one-on-one action" [...] it [...] "turned into a pretty good match."

Instead, he stubbornly continued building his short-line railroad {{through some of the}} most rugged terrain of the Mountain State, to the increasing puzzlement {{of the leaders of the}} big railroads. They were unaware that one of Page's investors (who were silent partners in the venture) was the powerful Rogers.
