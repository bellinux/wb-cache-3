5|$|After {{the band}} had walked offstage, {{in a move}} {{described}} by NME as the most meaningful <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>concert,</b> the audience faced the troops in the stadium and broke into a spontaneous round of applause, which quickly turned into an ovation—an act which the soldiers mimicked in turn.|$|E

50|$|In {{the first}} tour, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>concerts</b> were {{extremely}} long, due to <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> artists that {{were chosen to}} headline the massive tour. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>concerts</b> were praised for the production value and how each artist played like it was their own tour. Many critics agreed that one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great things about <b>the</b> <b>concerts</b> were that they {{felt like they were}} made up of mini concerts.|$|R
5000|$|Seger chose [...] "Detroit Made" [...] as {{the opening}} song in most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>concerts</b> on his 2013 tour.

5|$|Another {{witness who}} had {{attended}} the {{concert at the}} rear of the crowd testified that Blythe's behavior was standard to metal concerts, saying that metal bands always put on angry and tough acts and the concert at issue was no exception. She said that it was evident that Blythe did not want any fans on the stage. Neither the two nor any other witness who took the stand that day gave a testimony as to the moment of Nosek's fall at the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>concert.</b>|$|E
5|$|Chopin {{took the}} new salon genre of the nocturne, invented by the Irish {{composer}} John Field, {{to a deeper}} level of sophistication. He {{was the first to}} write ballades and scherzi as individual concert pieces. He essentially established a new genre with his own set of free-standing preludes (Op.28, published 1839). He exploited the poetic potential of the concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>concert</b> étude, already being developed in the 1820s and 1830s by Liszt, Clementi and Moscheles, in his two sets of studies (Op.10 published in 1833, Op.25 in 1837).|$|E

5|$|On December 13, 2014, Merregnon Studios {{announced}} {{that they would be}} producing an album for the concert, to be published the following year. Unlike prior Merregnon Studios concert albums, the Final Symphony album would not be a recording of one of the performances but would instead be a studio recording of the London Symphony Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios, produced especially for the album. The version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>concert</b> recorded was the one used in the final performance in Tampere, rather than the one originally performed by the London Symphony Orchestra in 2013. The performance was recorded on December 15–17, was conducted by Eckehard Stier, and featured a piano performance by Katharina Treutler. Nobuo Uematsu supervised the production of the album. The album was published by X5 Music Group, who had previously published the Symphonic Fantasies Tokyo album for Merregnon Studios. It was released as a digital album on February 23, 2015, while a preview of the album was performed on British radio station Classic FM on February 21. Prior to the album's release, the only available recording <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>concert</b> was a video of the Stockholm performance of the Final Fantasy VI symphonic poem by the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra, released on their website on October 10, 2014. A physical version of the album was released on Blu-ray on September 16, 2015. A promotional mini-album was released on April 23, 2015, containing the Final Fantasy VI symphonic poem, and one part each from the Final Fantasy VII and X sections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>concert.</b> In December 2016, Laced Records released the Final Symphony album on double CD and triple vinyl.|$|E
5|$|On the day <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>concert,</b> trains {{ran into}} Sarajevo {{for the first}} time since the start of the war. Two lines were opened, one from Mostar to Sarajevo and the other from Maglaj to Sarajevo. Although the {{railways}} had been functional for the duration of the war, Muslim and Croat politicians could not decide who would operate them. As a result, the trains were only run on the date <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>concert</b> to bring fans to the city, and the day after to take them home again. Visa requirements were temporarily suspended. An effort was made to include all of the country's ethnic groups at the concert. Approximately 500fans crossed the ethnic boundary lines between Bosnia's Serb Republic and the Moslem-Croat Federation. People from several of the other Yugoslavian republics went to Sarajevo for the concert, with buses carrying fans from Zagreb, Croatia and Ljubljana, Slovenia. Security around the event was strict. SFOR soldiers searched for bombs with sniffer dogs, and the buildings around the stadium were lined with Irish troops and sharpshooters in case violence broke out.|$|E
5|$|Since 2009, Eurovision in Concert {{has been}} held in the Netherlands, and has become the largest {{gathering}} of Eurovision artists outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>concert</b> itself.

5|$|The concert {{took place}} on Saturday, September 19, 1981, on the Great Lawn, the central open space of Central Park. The first spectators, many {{carrying}} chairs or picnic blankets, arrived at daybreak to secure a good spot. The Parks Department originally expected about 300,000 attendees. Although rain fell throughout the day and continued until the start <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>concert,</b> an estimated 500,000 audience members made this the seventh-largest concert attendance in the United States in history.|$|E
5|$|The fourth disc of Collaborations is a DVD {{containing}} previously unissued film of {{a performance}} by the Music Festival from India, recorded at London's Royal Albert Hall in September 1974. Filmed by director Stuart Cooper, the footage required substantial restoration for its 2010 release. An audio-only track on the DVD, prepared by Anoushka Shankar and Paul Hicks, provides a more complete record <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>concert.</b>|$|E
