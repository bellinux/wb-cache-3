In Lusei which is called as Zawlbuk [...] Apart from the family, it was the most important educational system of the people. It was mandatory for all the youths over 15 years of age to stay in the Bukpui, where they received training in 'tribal welfare wrestling, hunting and village government'. These Bukpui’s are often of great size, and are on much higher platforms than the other houses. To reach the platforms, notched logs of wood serve as staircases, and long pieces of cane are often suspended from an <b>overhanging</b> <b>beam</b> close to the notched logs to assist the inmates to climb up and down. The boys who went to the Bukpui emerged as complete men. The Bukpui began to lose in importance after the appearance of the British on the scene.

40|$|Although {{various types}} of sensors are now {{available}} to monitor a structure, structural responses are usually recorded in {{a limited number of}} locations which are much less than the total number of degrees of freedom (DOF) of the structure. The lack of information on multi-scale responses of the structure at all its key locations may hamper subsequently the accuracy of system identification, the reliability of damage detection or the effectiveness of structural control. Therefore, multi-scale response reconstruction at the key locations of a structure based on limited measured responses is essential. A dual-type sensor placement method with the aim of the possibly best reconstruction of multi-scale structural responses is investigated experimentally in this paper in terms of a simply supported overhanging steel beam. The numbers and locations of strain gauges and displacement transducers for the possibly best reconstruction of the multi-scale responses are first determined in terms of the proposed method and the updated finite-element (FE) model of the <b>overhanging</b> <b>beam.</b> An experimental work is then designed with the simply supported <b>overhanging</b> <b>beam.</b> The determined dual-type sensors are installed on the physical beam accordingly. The structural responses from these sensors are recorded during the experiments and employed to reconstruct the multi-scale responses of the beam at all its key locations. Some of these reconstructed responses are finally compared with the measured ones to verify the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method is feasible and efficient.

40|$|Summary Structural damage {{identification}} {{is essentially an}} inverse problem. Ill-posedness is a common obstacle encountered in solving such an inverse problem, especially {{in the context of}} a sensitivity-based model updating for {{damage identification}}. Tikhonov regularization, also termed as ? 2 -norm regularization, is a common approach to handle the ill-posedness problem and yields an acceptable and smooth solution. Tikhonov regularization enjoys a more popular application as its explicit solution, computational efficiency, and convenience for implementation. However, as the ? 2 -norm term promotes smoothness, the solution is sometimes over smoothed, especially in the case that the sensor number is limited. On the other side, the solution of the inverse problem bears sparse properties because typically, only a small number of components of the structure are damaged in comparison with the whole structure. In this regard, this paper proposes an alternative way, sparse regularization, or specifically ? 1 -norm regularization, to handle the ill-posedness problem in response sensitivity-based damage identification. The motivation and implementation of sparse regularization are firstly introduced, and the differences with Tikhonov regularization are highlighted. Reweighting sparse regularization is adopted to enhance the sparsity in the solution. Simulation studies on a planar frame and a simply supported <b>overhanging</b> <b>beam</b> show that the sparse regularization exhibits certain superiority over Tikhonov regularization as less false-positive errors exist in damage identification results. The experimental result of the <b>overhanging</b> <b>beam</b> further demonstrates the effectiveness and superiorities of the sparse regularization in response sensitivity-based damage identification.

The buckling length coefficients specified in the current standards and specifications were firstly defined by Nethercot (1973) [1], and cover only doubly symmetric I-sections. The elastic and inelastic behavior of <b>overhanging</b> singly-symmetric floor <b>beams</b> subjected to concentrated load at cantilever tip is investigated in this paper, using the finite element method. To this purpose, a geometrically and materially non-linear finite element model is built.

40|$|Different {{types of}} sensors in a {{structural}} health monitoring (SHM) system {{installed in a}} structure enable various types of structural responses to be measured. However, their distinct properties and limitations considerably complicate multisensing structural condition assessment. As a result, the information from these sensors is often used separately, and the potential advantage of multisensing information has not been used effectively. This paper first proposes a covariance-based multisensing (CBMS) damage detection method in the time domain {{in terms of a}} CBMS vector as a new damage index and a sensitivity study for damage detection. The proposed method has the merit of assimilating heterogeneous data and reducing the adverse effect of measurement noise. The CBMS damage detection method is then used in two stages for detecting damage location and severity consecutively. Numerical studies are finally performed to investigate the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed framework using an <b>overhanging</b> <b>beam</b> with two damage scenarios. The results show that the two-stage CBMS damage detection method improves the accuracy of damage detection and that the proposed method can be effectively used to combine multisensing information for better damage detection.

H 577 P CEE 2017 Zhangxxxviii, 343 pages :color illustrationsTo {{ensure the}} safety and {{functionality}} of civil structures, {{it is vital to}} detect and quantify structural deteriorations in a timely manner for remedial work, before these deteriorations propagate and become detrimental to the entire structure. Structural health monitoring has been developing in past two decades, aiming to continually monitor loading conditions and assess structural conditions so that prompt decisions can be made if any damage is detected and quantified. Vibration-based damage identification, as a significant focus for structural condition assessment and health monitoring, {{has been the subject of}} many research efforts in recent years. Despite considerable progress in the structural health assessment of oil rigs, mechanical systems, and aerospace structures, such assessment still encounters some obstacles when it is applied to complex civil structures. These barriers mainly exhibit the following aspects: (1) the limited number of sensors compared to the number of structural components, which makes it difficult to capture enough dynamic responses for structural condition assessment; (2) the significance of model error, which is due to the difficulty of establishing a finite element (FE) model to represent the real dynamic behavior of large and complex structures; (3) the ill-posedness and non-identifiability of the inverse problem, which is due to the significant dimension of damaged areas corresponding to the numerous structural components; (4) the fact that the higher mode vibrations of cumbersome civil structures, which are more sensitive to local damage, are not easily excited under operating conditions; and (5) the enormous, unaffordable computational demand associated with the large dimensions of discretized FE model matrices and the scope of dynamic FE analysis during iterations. Taking these obstacles into consideration, this thesis aims to develop novel vibration-based damage identification methods specifically suited for application to civil structures of large-scale and geometric complexity. To accomplish this aim, the following research efforts have been made. First, an optimal multi-type sensor placement method is proposed for the best response reconstruction on the location where no sensors are installed as well as the time evolution of the pre-located deterministic excitations; Second, sparse regularization is proposed to replace the traditional Tikhonov regularization in finite element (FE) model updating based damage identification. The superiority of sparse regularization is highlighted not only in constraining the solution norm but also in promoting solution sparsity. Third, the Kalman filter based response reconstruction and multi-type response fusion are integrated with the sparse regularized FE model updating to supplement the limitation of sensor measurements as well as take the benefits of both global and local response fusion in structural damage identification. Fourth, the proposed response reconstruction-oriented damage identification strategy is extended from circumstances where the time evolution of external excitations is required to the conditions where external excitations acting on the structure are unknown. And finally, multi-level damage identification via response reconstruction is proposed for identification of element-level damages on large civil structures. This method firstly detects possible damaged regions over the condensed and assembled substructures through dynamic substructuring technique using measured responses; then, the damage at the element level is further localized and quantified over suspicious substructures using the reconstructed responses of the identified substructures. As a result, the damage dimensions are dramatically decreased in the identification of both levels; the computational efforts are dramatically decreased, while the identifiability of the damage is increased. Besides the theoretical studies, numerical studies and experimental investigations are also conducted to demonstrate the procedures of these proposed methods and verify their effectiveness. Simulation studies and experimental investigations are performed on an <b>overhanging</b> <b>beam</b> of 40 elements on the following issues: optimal sensor placement for joint response and excitation reconstruction, sparse regularization in FE model updating based damage identification, and damage identification via response reconstruction under both known and unknown excitations. Performance evaluation of the proposed optimal sensor placement method for joint response and excitation reconstruction as well as multi-level damage identification via response reconstruction is also conducted through experimental investigation on the long-span Tsing Ma suspension bridge testbed at the Structural Dynamic Laboratory of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. The research works presented and the results obtained in this thesis contribute to the damage identification of the major civil structures. Department of Civil and Environmental EngineeringPh.

40|$|Although {{various types}} of sensors are now {{available}} to monitor a structure, measurements are usually obtained {{in only a few}} locations numbering less than the total degrees of freedom (DOFs) of the structure. The lack of structural responses of the structure at all its critical areas may hamper the effectiveness of structural monitoring. Therefore, multi-scale response reconstruction at those key structural locations where sensors are not available is essential to fully achieving the structural monitoring objectives. This paper addresses a problem of placing multi-type sensors in a structure with the objective of best reconstruction of structural responses. The types of sensors include accelerometers, displacement and strain measurement sensors, all of which are widely used in civil engineering structures. The number and locations of the three types of sensors are determined aiming to best possibly reconstruct the strain, displacement and acceleration responses, in which the Kalman filter algorithm is employed. By minimizing the overall reconstruction error variance at the locations of interest and maintaining reconstruction errors to a desired target level, the initial set of candidate sensor locations is reduced to a smaller set. The key multi-scale structural responses are reconstructed from the fusion of limited multi-type sensor data information. A simply-supported <b>overhanging</b> steel <b>beam</b> is investigated as a sample case in numerical and experimental study to investigate the effectiveness and accuracy of the presented approach. The good response reconstruction results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed optimal placement method for multi-type sensors. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|The need {{to perform}} dynamic {{response}} reconstruction always arises as {{the measurement of}} structural response is often limited to a few locations, especially for a large civil structure. Besides, it is usually very difficult, if not impossible, to measure external excitations under the operation condition of a structure. This study presents an algorithm for optimal placement of multi-type sensors, including strain gauges, displacement transducers and accelerometers, for the best reconstruction of responses of key structural components {{where there are no}} sensors installed and the best estimation of external excitations acting on the structure at the same time. The algorithm is developed in the framework of Kalman filter with unknown excitation, in which minimum-variance unbiased estimates of the generalized state of the structure and the external excitations are obtained by virtue of limited sensor measurements. The structural responses of key locations without sensors can then be reconstructed with the estimated generalized state and excitation. The asymptotic stability feature of the filter is utilized for optimal sensor placement. The number and spatial location of the multi-type sensors are determined by adding the optimal sensor which gains the maximal reduction of the estimation error of reconstructed responses. For the given mode number in response reconstruction and the given locations of external excitations, the optimal multi-sensor placement achieved by the proposed method is independent of the type and time evolution of external excitation.

40|$|One {{outstanding}} obstacle that hinders robust {{application of}} vibration-based damage identification to civil structures {{is that the}} number of sensors installed on a large civil structure is always limited, compared with the total degrees of freedom of the structure, so that the limited measured responses may not provide enough information for detecting local damage. Furthermore, developments in sensor technology make installation of heterogeneous sensors on a structure practical and feasible while every type of sensor has its own merits and drawbacks for damage identification. But the benefits of utilizing heterogeneous sensors in vibration-based damage identification have not been fully investigated. This study proposes a damage identification method by combining the response reconstruction technique with the response sensitivity–based finite element model updating method to address these issues. The number and location of heterogeneous sensors, such as accelerometers, displacement transducers, and strain gauges, are optimally and collectively determined in an optimization strategy to obtain the best reconstruction of multi-type responses of a structure using Kalman filter. After damage occurrence, radial basis function network is employed to predict the mode shapes using the modal properties extracted from the measurement data by experimental modal analysis method, and these modal properties are further used to reconstruct responses of the damaged structure. The reconstructed responses are finally used to identify the damage in terms of sensitivity-based finite element model updating. In every updating, the sparse regularization is employed to increase the identification accuracy. A simply supported <b>overhanging</b> steel <b>beam</b> composed of 40 elements serves as a numerical study to demonstrate the procedure and feasibility of the proposed method. The validation of this method is further conducted by laboratory test.

40|$|The {{disaster}} in Taiwan such as mountain collapse, landslide and mudflow {{is due to}} the human excessive, improper exploitation and overuse on hillside. The other natural cause is located at the severely movable plate surrounding the west Pacific Ocean earthquake zone. The active mountain motion makes three fourths of Taiwan area as mountain region. Therefore, the slope failure on the road occurs frequently caused by typhoon, rainstorm and flood with fragile geology. When the road is ruined from natural disaster, the fill and retaining wall are usually used for rehabilitation and restoring the road width. However, the poor compaction and overload will accompany with the fill construction. Furthermore, the footing of retaining wall can not penetrate into the stiff layer due to the limitation of road width. Then the road condition is not easily kept in good condition and even brings about the second disaster. A proper measure should be taken for solving the problem above. The landing bridge for road rehabilitation with limited width seems a feasible way. It uses a landing beam across the road to increase the width and take the above load. The overload condition with the fill will not happen in this measure. In the research the finite element program Plaxis is used to analyze the mechanical behavior of different cases of landing bridge with overhanging style. From the analyzed results, it indicates that using the <b>overhanging</b> I <b>beam</b> which is put on the concrete footing at the road base and at the mountain side, properly protecting the upper and lower slope of the road can feasibly solve the problem of limited width and provide the safety of road use. 台灣地區災害成因除人為山坡地過度與不當的開發及超限利用造成發生山崩、地滑與土石流外，天然條件因位處板塊活動劇烈之環西太平洋地震帶上，活躍的造山運動，造成台灣有將近四分之三的土地為山地區域，因此，除山高水深且地質脆弱外，於颱風、豪雨、洪水、地震的侵襲下，道路邊坡崩塌之狀況頻繁。 當道路遭遇天災損壞，為恢復道路原有路幅寬度則通常需以填方及擋土牆進行修復，但以土石料回填通常伴隨夯實不易及負載過重問題，另外受路幅限制下擋土牆基礎無法深入堅硬地盤中，因此容易造成維護困難及二次災害產生，故此仍須尋求其他可行之解決方案。棧梁式路面修復工法為一種可行性以解決上述問題，以棧梁支撐路面重量，達成增加路幅寬度目的，亦可解決高填方造成山坡負載過重問題。 本研究以Plaxis 2 D程式於路幅受限採懸臂棧橋作為穩定坡面之使用方式，進行不同案例之載重力學行為分析與探討，分析結果顯示:利用外懸工字梁，下方配合RC混凝土塊基礎座及靠山側混凝土擋土牆之施作，以及上下邊坡坡面適當之保護，可有效解決路幅不足問題，並提供道路使用之安全。目錄 摘要	i 目錄	iii 表目錄	vi 圖目錄	vii 第一章 緒論	 1 1. 1 前言	 1 1. 2 研究動機與目的	 1 1. 3 研究方法	 2 1. 4 研究內容	 2 第二章 文獻回顧	 4 2. 1 邊坡破壞類型	 4 2. 1. 1 淺層土壤破壞	 4 2. 1. 2 土石流	 6 2. 1. 3 表層土壤沖蝕	 8 2. 1. 4 近圓弧滑動破壞	 10 2. 1. 5 地層潛變位移	 12 2. 1. 6 順向坡滑動破壞	 14 2. 1. 7 落石	 16 2. 2 道路邊坡崩塌型態	 18 2. 2. 1 墜落型（Fall）	 18 2. 2. 2 傾覆型（Topple）	 19 2. 2. 3 滑動型（Slide）	 19 2. 2. 4 側移型（Spreads）	 19 2. 2. 5 流動型（Flow）	 20 2. 2. 6 潛移型（Creep）	 20 2. 3 邊坡潛在危險因素	 20 2. 4 一般擋土牆工程設計規範及流程	 21 2. 5 棧橋式修復工法介紹	 27 2. 5. 1 適用地形	 28 2. 5. 2 災害原因分析	 28 2. 5. 3 棧橋配置	 29 2. 5. 4 結構分析	 31 第三章 分析研究方法	 32 3. 1 Plaxis 2 D數值分析程式	 32 3. 1. 1 Input (輸入) 單元	 33 3. 1. 2 Calculation (計算) 單元	 34 3. 1. 3 Output (輸出) 單元	 34 3. 2 莫爾庫倫（Mohr-Coulomb）模式	 35 3. 3 莫爾庫倫模式之基本參數	 36 第四章 案例分析與討論	 37 4. 1 研究案例	 37 4. 2 研究案例之分類	 39 4. 3 分析步驟	 40 4. 4 案例分析結果與討論	 42 4. 4. 1 案例一 	 42 4. 4. 2 案例二	 45 4. 4. 3 案例三	 48 4. 4. 4 案例四	 51 4. 4. 5 案例五	 54 4. 4. 6 案例六	 57 4. 4. 7 案例七	 60 4. 4. 8 案例八	 63 4. 4. 9 研究案例分析數值統計	 67 第五章 結論與建議	 68 5. 1 結論	 68 5. 2 建議	 69 參考文獻	 70 表目錄 表 2 - 1 邊坡破壞類型與潛在危險因素關係	 21 表 4 - 1 材料分析使用參數	 37 表 4 - 2 研究案例分類表	 39 表 4 - 3 研究案例分析數值統計表	 67 圖目錄 圖 2 - 1 淺層土壤破壞剖面示意圖	 5 圖 2 - 2 現地邊坡淺層土壤破壞情形	 5 圖 2 - 3 土石流破壞示意圖	 7 圖 2 - 4 三義火炎山 130 甲線發生土石流災變圖	 7 圖 2 - 5 土壤沖蝕破壞情形	 9 圖 2 - 6 近圓弧形滑動破壞示意圖	 11 圖 2 - 7 近圓弧形滑動破壞現場情形	 11 圖 2 - 8 邊坡潛變位移破壞示意圖	 13 圖 2 - 9 山區公路邊坡潛變位移破壞情形	 13 圖 2 - 10 順向坡滑動破壞剖面示意圖	 15 圖 2 - 11 九份二山順向坡滑動破壞情形	 15 圖 2 - 12 落石示意圖	 17 圖 2 - 13 現場落石情形	 17 圖 2 - 14 擋土牆設計流程圖	 23 圖 2 - 15 重力式擋土牆斷面圖	 24 圖 2 - 16 古棧道	 27 圖 2 - 17 棧道使用現況圖	 27 圖 2 - 18 造成路幅不足之災害原因分析圖	 28 圖 2 - 19 棧橋式修復示意圖	 30 圖 2 - 20 棧橋式粱斷面結構分析	 31 圖 4 - 1 初始應力場形成	 40 圖 4 - 2 施設工字梁	 41 圖 4 - 3 增加均佈靜載重	 41 圖 4 - 4 增加車行集中載重	 42 圖 4 - 5 案例一整體變形圖	 43 圖 4 - 6 案例一最大主應力分佈圖	 44 圖 4 - 7 案例一工字梁垂直變位圖	 44 圖 4 - 8 案例一工字梁彎矩圖	 45 圖 4 - 9 案例一工字梁剪力圖	 45 圖 4 - 10 案例二整體變形圖	 46 圖 4 - 11 案例二最大主應力分佈圖	 47 圖 4 - 12 案例二工字梁垂直變位圖	 47 圖 4 - 13 案例二工字梁彎矩圖	 48 圖 4 - 14 案例二工字梁剪力圖	 48 圖 4 - 15 案例三整體變形圖	 49 圖 4 - 16 案例三最大主應力分佈圖	 50 圖 4 - 17 案例二工字梁垂直變形圖	 50 圖 4 - 18 案例三工字梁彎矩圖	 51 圖 4 - 19 案例三工字梁剪力圖	 51 圖 4 - 20 案例四整體變形圖	 52 圖 4 - 21 案例四最大主應力分佈圖	 53 圖 4 - 22 案例四工字梁垂直變形圖	 53 圖 4 - 23 案例四工字梁彎矩圖	 54 圖 4 - 24 案例四工字梁剪力圖	 54 圖 4 - 25 案例五整體變形圖	 55 圖 4 - 26 案例五最大主應力分佈圖	 56 圖 4 - 27 案例五工字梁垂直變形圖	 56 圖 4 - 28 案例五工字梁彎矩圖	 57 圖 4 - 29 案例五工字梁剪力圖	 57 圖 4 - 30 案例六整體變形圖	 58 圖 4 - 31 案例六最大主應力分佈圖	 59 圖 4 - 32 案例六工字梁垂直變形圖	 59 圖 4 - 33 案例六工字梁彎矩圖	 60 圖 4 - 34 案例六工字梁剪力圖	 60 圖 4 - 35 案例七整體變形圖	 61 圖 4 - 36 案例七最大主應力分佈圖	 62 圖 4 - 37 案例七工字梁垂直變形圖	 62 圖 4 - 38 案例七工字梁彎矩圖	 63 圖 4 - 39 案例七工字梁剪力圖	 63 圖 4 - 40 案例八整體變形圖	 64 圖 4 - 41 案例八最大主應力分佈圖	 65 圖 4 - 42 案例八工字梁垂直變形圖	 65 圖 4 - 43 案例八工字梁垂直變形圖	 66 圖 4 - 44 案例八工字梁剪力圖	 6...|$|R
