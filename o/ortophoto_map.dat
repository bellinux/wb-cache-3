The chosen ones were Stable cadastral map (1841), an ortophotomap from 1950 ´s (1954) and a recent <b>ortophoto</b> <b>map</b> (2015). The first part of the thesis is dedicated to literary research, which is focused on demarcation of related issues. The second part is focused on data processing and analysis. Maps were processed by ArcGIS 10. 2 software. Raster data were manually vectorised according to the chosen categories of landscape utilization. The maps of landscape utilization during the times are providing important information about landscape development, mostly in past 170 years. At the end, the results derived from the analysis are put into context with the overall objectives of land consolidation. That show us the possible benefits of land consolidation in area of interest...|$|E
40|$|More {{and more}} {{countries}} {{realize that the}} existence of reliable maps is the key to sucessful planning of the development of the country. During the past four decades the majority part of the mapping which has been carried out throughout the world, including medium and small scale mapping, has been based on aerial photography and produced using photogrammetic techniques. Technological advances have resulted in the development of improved aerial cameras, high resolution aerial films, analytical instruments permitting digital data capture, powerful computer software for block adjustments and data manipulation, orthophoto projectors and other automatic systems. Despite these technological advances, the 1989 United Nations report on the status of the world's topographic mapping reveals that only 33 per cent of the world has been mapped on the scale of 1 : 25. 000, 56 per cent on the scale of 1 : 50. 000 and 59 per cent on the scale of 1 : 100. 000. The annual progress of new production between 1980 and 1987 has been of the order of 2 per cent. During the 1970 the annual production was only 1 - 1, 5 per cent. These figures give no indication of the considerable need for revision of a majority of the existing map sheets. The lack of reliable mapping is a particularly serious constraint within the fields of rural development and the planning of the use and management of natural resources. Accurate and up-to [...] date, knowledge about the present situation allows decision makers to avoid costly mistakes for the national economy in respect of national investments and development directions of the nation. To cover an entire country with new maps on a scale suitable for the regional resources review and development planning by using the traditional mapping technique, is normally a task of twenty to thirty years. This situation has rapidly changed since 1986, when the first civilian satellite suitable for use in cartography became available. The French-Swedish SPOT satellite is the first and only cartographic satellite system. The time saving aspect of this new satellite mapping technique was probably the most important fact, when so many countries and world organizations, like WB, UN and FAO, decided to use the satellite technique as the base material for national resource inventory and planning. The use of Satellite Image Maps varies from the revision of existing maps through environmental protection planning, agricultural development, rural development, land use inventory, foresty mapping and planning, urban and transport planning, to the planning of national census. Satellite based maps are satellite imagery in a map sheet format - format which to must users in the natural one. Satellite scenes are merged digitally do cover the requested area, and subsectioned into map sheet units. The subsectioning system is determined by the customer's requirements and is normally adapted to the existing sytem and projection of the country. Three diferent types of base maps can be produced from SPOT satellite data: Satellite lmage Maps; Satellite Orthophoto Map; Topographic <b>Ortophoto</b> <b>Map.</b> Satellite Image Maps are derived from precision corrected imagery from SPOT. Image displacements might occur due to deviations between the ground altitude and the reference elevation {{as well as from the}} viewing angle of the satellite. Image displacements are minimized using vertical or near vertical images. Satellite Orthophoto Maps are produced similarly as the Satellite Image Maps, but the terrain displacement errors have been eliminated. This elimination is done using a simplified digital terrain models derived from existing topographic maps. Topographic Orthophoto Maps are produced from digital stereo pairs from SPOT. Digital Terrain models, DTMs, are computed through a Multi-point-matching technique. Contour lines are then generated from the DTMs for the final topographic map.. Pages: 361 - 37...|$|E
40|$|The {{evaluation}} of prefered kinds of fair game - Wild pig (Sus scrofa), Roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), Pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) and Brown hare (Lepus europaeus) was studied in model game areas - Lhenice and in Žabovřesky in South Bohemia. The landscape of both studied areas differs by the land cover {{and intensity of}} agriculture. Te main data about game species were: number of shooting game, number of dieing game and spring population density {{in the last ten}} years. The second part of our study was directed on landscape evaluation. The <b>ortophoto</b> <b>maps</b> of studied areas were analysed ArgGis software. Data about game and landscape character were compared including the climate condition of both areas. The results of our studies verified the hypoothesis that the landscape with more diverse land cover is more perspective for populations of game species. It was found that besides of man factors play the important role the natural conditions of game areas. These condition are independent on the man activities and can be affected by the care about the landscape...|$|R
40|$|The {{availability}} of high resolution satellite stereopairs {{also for the}} civil users opens new possible fields of application among which the automatic extraction of digital models of the surface, the stereoscopic restitution, {{as well as the}} possibility to appraise changes and transformations of areas following catastrophic events, as for instance seismic events. In this last case, obviously, as for all the monitoring studies, it is necessary to effect a comparison with the situation before the event. Photogrammetry can fortunately also use older aerial acquisitions, very useful when substantial changes have occurred in the territory; normally, such historical aerial frames are easily available at a very reasonable cost. In this paper is illustrated an experimentation including a first series of tests to evaluate the real possibilities of use of high resolution satellite images, acquired by the Ikonos satellite, to estimate changes caused by a seismic event happened in September 1997 in central Italy, causing relevant damages to a lot of buildings in the zone. It is interesting to evaluate the different capabilities of change detection tecniques on single images and the difference of DSMs extracted by aerial and satellite stereopairs. As reference have been assumed <b>ortophoto</b> <b>maps</b> and aerial frames of the same zone, acquired in years antecedent to the seismic event. From the comparisons, it is possible to underline the variations in the urban areas as the presence of new constructions, changes of the roads, areas with different use of the ground, etc...|$|R
40|$|The {{information}} collected through the airborne remote sensing {{are useful for}} many scientific and practical works. In order to use collected information and existing knowledge of the observed object in {{the most efficient way}} for the purpose of solving specific problems, we have to examine their characteristics and if possible fuse them. This article is motivated by the existence of two operative digital sensor systems in Croatia that collect information at different wavelengths and with different methods of taking images. The first sensor is the digital matrix (staring) camera, for three visible channels (V: 0. 4 – 0. 5 µm, 0. 5 - 0. 6 µm, 0. 6 - 0. 7 µm), for near infrared channel (NIR: 0. 7 - 1. 0 µm) and the second sensor is the longwave thermal infrared (TIR: 8 - 14 µm) parallel scan camera. This paper will analyze the possibility of fusing information provided by above sensors, of one not very accessible area (mountainous terrain, with large differences of heights). Digital sensor systems yield multispectral images with different spatial and radiometric resolutions, geodetic and photogrammetric data (geographic <b>maps,</b> GPS data, <b>ortophoto</b> <b>maps,</b> geocoded mosaics), the insight in the field situation (ground truth) and other accessible sources provide inputs for fusion. It will also consider influence of the fusion on the results of classification of mosaics developed on multi-sensor, multi-spectral and multi-resolution digital images from above mentioned two sensor systems. The mosaics {{made on the basis of}} the above-mentioned sensor systems have been separately made, and later on the multi-spectral mosaics containing the information from all 5 channels will be created. Spatial and geometrical quality of multi-sensor and multi-spectral images and mosaics were analysed in earlier works, so this article will not deal with this matter, but will use the results of those earlier analyses. The work is an integral part of the research conducted in the scientific project ARC funded by the European Commission...|$|R

40|$|Poster presentado en la 4 th International Conference on Medical Geology GEOMED celebrada en Bari (Italia) del 20 al 25 de septiembre de 2011 The Mediterranean {{wetlands}} {{are unique}} in biological diversity and they offer multiple benefits constituting a great water reserve {{for the planet}} and to produce biomass and nutrients for the trophic chain. However, the increasing human impact and the socio-economic development of the last decades have produced important losses in these ecosystems. To study the impact of urban and traditional agricultural landscapes on natural protected wetlands new holistic and multidisciplinary approaches are necessary. In this work are methodology based in the combination of environmental forensic procedures under which different techniques, (such as Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of 16 water samples to determine 17 domestic use pharmaceutical compounds, aerial photographs and <b>ortophotos</b> to <b>map</b> surfaces water flows and Geographical Information Systems to integrate information from different sources and to establish the territorial implications of water flows and emerging contaminants from urban systems to open water in protected natural wetlands) are combined. The work has been developed in the Natural Park of La Albufera (Valencia, Spain), which includes a coastal lagoon, marshlands, dunes and pinewoods, surrounded by rice fields in its not urbanized part. In spite of this great ecological value, it suffers impacts derived from the high human and industrial occupation, and of the hydrological contributions from the connected irrigation systems. Result shows that after treatment, the presence of 12 pharmaceutical compounds is detected {{in the majority of}} the water samples analysed. Urban agglomerations and population concentration are determinants in the number or pharmaceutical and concentrations detected. Further, the traditional irrigation drainage systems are determinant in the surface water flows from the urban systems to the natural environments. In that later case they act as interconnection mechanisms from urban landscapes to the natural open waters in the protected Natural Park. Thus, further studies are needed to determine trends and rates of emerging contaminants inflows and the impacts into the wetland water and habitats to developed effective protection policies.
