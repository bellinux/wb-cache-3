25|$|Contemporary writers {{observed}} that the Greeks {{were among the most}} temperate of ancient peoples. This appears to result from their rules stressing moderate drinking, their praise of temperance, and their avoidance of excess in general. An exception to this ideal <b>of</b> <b>moderation</b> was the cult of Dionysus, in which intoxication was believed to bring people closer to their deity.|$|E

25|$|A fourth {{difference}} suggested, {{relates to}} the acceptability <b>of</b> <b>moderation</b> within Jewish law. Both Modern Orthodoxy and Ultra Orthodoxy regard Halakha as divine in origin, and as such, no position is assumed without justification in the Shulchan Aruch and in the Acharonim. The movements differ, however, in their approach to strictures (chumras) and leniencies (kulas).|$|E
25|$|Lafayette's tricolour cockade {{was adopted}} in July 1789, {{a moment of}} {{national}} unity that soon faded. Royalists began wearing white cockades and flying white flags, while the Jacobins, and later the Socialists, flew the red flag. The tricolour, which combines royalist white with republican red, {{came to be seen}} as a symbol <b>of</b> <b>moderation</b> and of a nationalism that transcended factionalism.|$|E

40|$|We {{assess the}} extent to which the great US {{macroeconomic}} stability since the mid- 1980 s can be accounted for by changes in oil shocks and the oil share in GDP. To do this we estimate a DSGE model with an oil-producing sector before and after 1984 and perform counterfactual simulations. We nest two popular explanations for the Great Moderation: (1) smaller (non-oil) real shocks; and (2) better monetary policy. We find that the reduced oil share accounted for as much as one-third <b>of</b> the inflation <b>moderation,</b> and 13 % <b>of</b> the growth <b>moderation,</b> while smaller oil shocks accounted for 11 % <b>of</b> the inflation <b>moderation</b> and 7 % <b>of</b> the growth <b>moderation.</b> This notwithstanding, better monetary policy explains the bulk <b>of</b> the inflation <b>moderation,</b> while most <b>of</b> the growth <b>moderation</b> is explained by smaller TFP shocks.

25|$|Joseph Chénier's play Charles IX was a {{huge success}} during the French Revolution, drawing {{strongly}} anti-monarchical and anti-religious lessons from the massacre. Chénier {{was able to put}} his principles into practice as a politician, voting for the execution of Louis XVI and many others, perhaps including his brother André Chénier. However, before the collapse of the Revolution he became suspected <b>of</b> <b>moderation,</b> and in some danger himself.|$|E
25|$|This was {{observed}} when Communist and socialist leaders in Italy defended the Czech coup {{as a victory}} for democracy, rationalizing that the violation of civil rights was a necessary and just response to a reactionary threat posed by Western imperialist (i.e., American) interests; such discourse probably damaged the Front's credibility and undercut its promises <b>of</b> <b>moderation.</b> Kennan cabled to suggest the PCI should be outlawed and the U.S. should intervene militarily in the likely event of a civil war, but he quickly softened his line.|$|E
25|$|As the {{province}} entered a sustained recession, Bennett's popularity and media image were in decline. On April 1, 1983, Premier Bennett overstayed his constitutional limits {{of power by}} exceeding the legal tenure of a government, and the Lieutenant-Governor, Henry Pybus Bell-Irving, was forced to call Bennett to Government House to resolve the impasse, and an election was called for April 30, while in the meantime government cheques were covered by special emergency warrants as the Executive Council no longer had signing authority because of the constitutional crisis. Campaigning on a platform <b>of</b> <b>moderation,</b> Bennett won an unexpected majority.|$|E

25|$|For a {{few months}} the Pathēt Lao {{appeared}} to honour their promises <b>of</b> <b>moderation.</b> The shell of the coalition government was preserved, there were no arrests or show-trials, and private property was respected. Diplomatic relations with the U.S. were maintained, despite an immediate cut-off of all U.S. aid. (Other western countries continued to offer aid, and Soviet and eastern European technicians began to arrive to replace the departed Americans.) But in December there was a sharp change in policy. A joint meeting {{of the government and}} the Consultative Council was held, at which Souphanouvong demanded immediate change. There was no resistance.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the early}} Buddhist texts, after realizing that meditative dhyana was the right path to , but that extreme asceticism didn't work, Gautama {{discovered}} what Buddhists know as being, the Middle Way—a path <b>of</b> <b>moderation</b> away from the extremes of self-indulgence and self-mortification, or the Noble Eightfold Path, {{as described in the}} Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta, which is regarded as the first discourse of the Buddha. In a famous incident, after becoming starved and weakened, he is said to have accepted milk and rice pudding from a village girl named Sujata. Such was his emaciated appearance that she wrongly believed him to be a spirit that had granted her a wish.|$|E
25|$|The Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions, {{which became}} part of the Principles of '98, along with the {{supporting}} Report of 1800 by Madison, became final documents of Jefferson's Democratic-Republican Party. Gutzman argued that Governor Edmund Randolph designed the protest in the name <b>of</b> <b>moderation.</b> Gutzman argues that in 1798, Madison espoused states' rights to defeat national legislation that he maintained was a threat to republicanism. During 1831–33, the South Carolina Nullifiers quoted Madison in their defense of states' rights. But Madison feared that the growing support for this doctrine would undermine the union and argued that by ratifying the Constitution states had transferred their sovereignty to the federal government.|$|E

25|$|In {{his letter}} to David Ben-Gurion dated 9 January 1968, he {{explained}} that he was convinced that Israel had ignored his warnings and overstepped the bounds <b>of</b> <b>moderation</b> by taking possession of Jerusalem, and Jordanian, Egyptian, and Syrian territory by force of arms. He felt Israel had exercised repression and expulsions during the occupation and that it amounted to annexation. He said that provided Israel withdrew its forces, it appeared that {{it might be possible to}} reach a solution through the UN framework which could include assurances of a dignified and fair future for refugees and minorities in the Middle East, recognition from Israel's neighbours, and freedom of navigation through the Gulf of Aqaba and the Suez Canal.|$|E
25|$|During {{this period}} the flourishing of Dutch {{painters}} became {{emblematic of the}} Golden Age in Dutch culture. At the time, this was just an industry like many others, with offshoots like chemical pigment making. Its rise illustrates the general boom conditions in the country, like the horticultural developments that laid {{the basis for the}} sophisticated tulip farming sector (which had its own speculative bubble, known as the tulip mania). By 1636 the tulip bulb became the fourth leading export product of the Netherlands – after gin, herring and cheese. The price of tulips skyrocketed because of speculation in tulip futures among people who never saw the bulbs. Many men made and lost fortunes overnight, to the consternation of Calvinists who abhorred this artificial frenzy that denied the virtues <b>of</b> <b>moderation,</b> discretion and genuine work.|$|E
25|$|The delays {{could only}} {{postpone}} Peter's inevitable defeat. Baldwin used the breathing space to renew his campaign of suspension and excommunication against his opponents, while Honorius, like Peter, {{remained at the}} papal court, {{as he had been}} ordered to return there by the chapter. However, on 26 January 1188, Clement made a final decision on the matter, which he communicated in a letter to Baldwin. He rebuked the archbishop for his lack <b>of</b> <b>moderation,</b> which tended to undermine the dignity of his office, and for his disobedience, before repeating all of Urban's demands: the new collegiate church was forbidden and the previous situation was to be restored. Baldwin continued his vindictive campaign against the monks, who were imprisoned in their own priory at the cathedral until August 1189, a month after the death of Henry II, when Richard I imposed a resolution.|$|E

25|$|Forum {{rules are}} {{maintained}} and {{enforced by the}} moderation team, but users are allowed to help out via {{what is known as}} a report system. Most American forum software contains such a system. It consists of a small function applicable to each post (including one's own). Using it will notify all currently available moderators of its location, and subsequent action or judgment can be carried out immediately, which is particularly desirable in large or very developed boards. Generally, moderators encourage members to also use the private message system if they wish to report behavior. Moderators will generally frown upon attempts <b>of</b> <b>moderation</b> by non-moderators, especially when the would-be moderators do not even issue a report. Messages from non-moderators acting as moderators generally declare a post as against the rules, or predict punishment. While not harmful, statements that attempt to enforce the rules are discouraged.|$|E
