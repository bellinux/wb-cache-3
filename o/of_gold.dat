5|$|Following the {{discovery}} <b>of</b> <b>gold</b> in California, {{a large amount}} <b>of</b> <b>gold</b> coins began appearing in American commercial channels. The influx caused the price <b>of</b> <b>gold</b> relative to silver to decrease, making silver coins worth more as bullion than as currency. They were exported abroad, or else melted locally for their bullion value. As it was profitable to export silver, little {{was presented at the}} Mint, which resulted in low mintage numbers for the silver dollar; 1,300 and 1,100 were struck in 1851 and 1852 respectively. The rarity of these dates was recognized by the late 1850s; Mint employees made surreptitious restrikes to sell to collectors.|$|E
