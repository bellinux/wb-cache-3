40|$|AbstractThe {{regularity}} of {{the solution}} of the <b>telegraph</b> <b>system</b> with nonlinear monotone boundary conditions is investigated by two methods. The first one is based on D'Alembert-type representation formulae for the solution. In the second method the <b>telegraph</b> <b>system</b> is reduced to a linear Cauchy problem with a locally Lipschitzian functional perturbation; then regularity results are established by appealing to the theory of linear semigroups...|$|R
50|$|In the 1830s {{the first}} {{commercial}} <b>telegraph</b> <b>system</b> was constructed in England. Over time the system was perfected and across the world overhead telegraph lines were built at rapid pace to connected towns and countries. The <b>telegraph</b> <b>system</b> allowed immediate communications by Morse telegraph codes to pass important government, commercial and private messages which up until then were delivered by mail on coaches and horseback.|$|R

25|$|Brunel {{was quick}} to see the {{possible}} advantages of the early electric <b>telegraph</b> <b>system</b> for use in running the railway. In 1838 he persuaded Sir Charles Wheatstone and William Fothergill Cooke to install their five-needle <b>telegraph</b> <b>system</b> between Paddington Station and West Drayton and to carry out experiments. It proved to be useful, so the viaduct thus carried the world's first commercial electrical telegraph, on 9 April 1839.|$|R
