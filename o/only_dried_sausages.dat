40|$|Actual healthy trends produce {{changes in}} the sensory {{characteristics}} of <b>dry</b> fermented <b>sausages</b> therefore, new strategies are needed to enhance their aroma. In particular, {{a reduction in the}} aroma characteristics was observed in reduced fat and salt <b>dry</b> <b>sausages.</b> In terms of aroma enhancing, generally coagulase-negative cocci were selected as the most important group from the endogenous microbiota in the production of flavour compounds. Among the volatile compounds analysed in <b>dry</b> <b>sausages,</b> ester compounds contribute to fruity aroma notes associated with high acceptance of traditional <b>dry</b> <b>sausages.</b> However, the origin of ester compounds in traditional <b>dry</b> <b>sausages</b> can be due to other microorganisms as lactic acid bacteria, yeast and moulds. Yeast contribution in <b>dry</b> fermented <b>sausages</b> was investigated with opposite results attributed to low yeast survival or low activity during processing. Generally, they affect sausage colour and flavour by their oxygen-scavenging and lipolytic activities in addition to, their ability to catabolize fermentation products such as lactate increasing the pH and contributing to less tangy and more aromatic sausages. Recently, the isolation and characterization of yeast from traditional <b>dry</b> fermented <b>sausages</b> made possible the selection of those with ability to produce aroma active compounds. Molecular methods were used for genetic typing of the isolated yeasts whereas their ability to produce aroma compounds was tested in different systems such as in culture media, in model systems and finally on <b>dry</b> fermented <b>sausages.</b> The results revealed that the appropriate selection of yeast strains with aroma potential may be used to improve the sensory characteristics of reformulated fermented sausages.

40|$|Traditional {{products}} {{are an interesting}} purchase option for the consumers confronted with the standardization of industrial products and the manufacture of these traditional products allows the producers to have more incomes in order to perpetuate their farm. The {{aim of this study}} is to identify and to characterise the diversity of traditional pure pork <b>dry</b> <b>sausages</b> of Massif Central, to know the perception of the consumers towards these products and to measure the impact of the sensory information on their perception. Firstly, the typology of manufacturing know-how on the overall traditional small scale facilities of Massif Central led to 6 groups of know-how which differed mainly by the choice of the raw materials used and by the techniques of drying. The link between the know-how and the organoleptic characteristics of the <b>dry</b> <b>sausages</b> was set up by canonical correlation analysis. Secondly, the organoleptic diversity of the <b>dry</b> <b>sausages</b> was characterised by sensory tools. The results confirmed that the factors driving the diversity are the raw materials used and the techniques of drying. The homogeneity and the regularity of the traditional <b>dry</b> <b>sausages</b> were demonstrated by the study of the composition of intra-dry sausage, of the batch of production and of the products through the year. These results allowed to check that the diversity observed on the small scale facilities is generally stable. Finally, the <b>dry</b> <b>sausages</b> representatives of the 6 know-how groups were presented to the consumers during an hedonic test in blind condition then with the information describing their sensory profile. The results showed that the traditional <b>dry</b> <b>sausages</b> are globally liked by the consumers. Moreover, the sensory information provided to the consumers oriented their preference. In fact, the sensory information allows the consumer to better analyse the organoleptic characteristics of the products. Thus, some producers with an innovative process offer to the consumers a larger diversity of traditional <b>dry</b> <b>sausages.</b> Contrary to the generally accepted idea, the traditional manufacturing is homogeneous and regular. Finally, these <b>dry</b> <b>sausages</b> have generally a good quality and are liked by the consumers of traditional products. L'objectif de cette étude est de caractériser la diversité des saucissons secs purs porc fermiers du Massif Central et de connaître la perception des consommateurs vis-à-vis de ces produits en présence ou non d'une information sensorielle.

The study describes two cases of undesirable heterofermentation in <b>dry</b> <b>sausages</b> from two different producers. In the sausage samples (n = 7) the pH value {{and the content of}} lactic and acetic acids were measured. Microbial analysis focused on quantitative and qualitative detection of lactic acid bacteria. The acetic acid content varied from 24. 28 to 67. 41 µmol·g- 1 dry matter, in the case of samples from the second producer the content of acetic acid (48. 45 to 67. 41 µmol·g- 1 dry matter) was higher than the lactic acid content (20. 98 to 29. 02 µmol·g- 1 dry matter). The lactobacilli strains from the sausages were assigned to the corresponding species by Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization – Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and classified to three groups according to the sugar fermentation pattern (obligately homofermentative, facultatively heterofermentative and obligately heterofermentative) and they caused the heterofermentation process in the samples of <b>dry</b> fermented <b>sausages.</b> The description of the case of heterofermentation process in <b>dry</b> <b>sausages</b> is unique and there is little information about thi...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Hypersensitivity {{pneumonitis}} due to <b>dry</b> <b>sausage</b> mould {{has been}} reported in workers who brush off the excess mould which coats <b>dry</b> <b>sausage.</b> Prevalence of symptoms and sensitization to mould among these pork-butchery workers is unknown. The aim {{of the study was to}} assess the clinical, radiographic, functional, and immunological features in exposed and non-exposed workers in semi-industrial pork butcheries. Patients and methods: Symptoms, and serum precipitins against mould extracts, were studied in workers in semi-industrial pork butcheries. Of 600 workers asked to participate, 123 (20. 5 %) were included. Fifty-nine workers, exposed to <b>dry</b> (raw) <b>sausage</b> mould and Penicillium nalgiovense were compared with 64 non-exposed subjects, for symptoms, chest X-rays, spirometry and CO-transfer measurements. Precipitating antibodies were detected by immunoelectrophoresis and electrosyneresis. Results: Sneezing, cough, dyspnoea, nasal obstruction, headache, and discomfort were significantly more frequent in the exposed group at work and after work than in the control group (P < 0. 05). The prevalence of precipitating antibodies for sausage mould was higher in the exposed group (37 %) than in the non-exposed group (9 %) (P < 0. 01). The mean number of precipitating lines measured by electrosyneresis was higher in exposed workers than in non-exposed workers for mould extract (1. 09 vs 0. 28, P < 0. 05) and for Penicillium nalgiovense (1. 77 vs 0. 33, P < 0. 05). No specific X-ray opacity or lung function impairment was found in either group. Conclusions: Clinical symptoms and sensitization to Penicillium nalgiovense are frequent among workers exposed to mould during brushing in <b>dry</b> <b>sausage</b> plants...|$|R
40|$|Differences in the {{production}} of bacterial metabolites with potential impact on fermented sausage flavour were found in meat simulation medium when comparing different strains of Staphylococcus xylosus and Staphylococcus carnosus as starter cultures. Overall, higher levels of 3 -methyl- 1 -butanol and acetoin were found for S. xylosus, with some intraspecies variability. In addition, sausage fermentation parameters affected staphylococcal growth and metabolism. Strong acidification, as in Northern-European types of fermented <b>dry</b> <b>sausage,</b> inhibited S. xylosus 3 PA 6 but not S. carnosus 833. During a milder, Southern-European type of acidification, both strains displayed survival over time. During in situ sausage trials, variations in the degree of acidification and the choice of starter microorganisms were of importance, whereas modifications in fat and salt contents had no effects. Staphylococcus sciuri alpha Sg 2, Staphylococcus succinus 4 PB 1, and S. xylosus 3 PA 6 were unable to survive the fermentation of a Northern-European type of fermented <b>dry</b> <b>sausage,</b> characterized by low or no 3 -methyl- 1 -butanol and acetoin production. Inoculation with S. sciuri alpha Sg 2, S. succinus 4 PB 1, or S. xylosus 3 PA 6 led to 3 -methyl- 1 -butanol and acetoin production in Southern-European type of fermented <b>dry</b> <b>sausages,</b> which was not observed with S. carnosus 833.
