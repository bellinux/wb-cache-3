5|$|Soon afterward, Nigerian Major Chukwuma Kaduna Nzeogwu {{seized control}} of the {{northern}} region <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>as</b> {{part of a larger}} coup attempt. Commanders in other areas failed, and the plot was answered by a military crackdown. A massacre of three thousand people from the eastern region living in the north occurred soon afterwards, and stories of other attacks on Igbo Nigerians began to filter into Lagos.|$|E
5|$|The Polish {{population}} is historically declining.

5|$|About {{nine hours}} after Ernesto became a {{tropical}} storm, {{the government of}} Haiti issued a tropical storm watch from its border with the Dominican Republic to the southwestern tip <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> <b>As</b> the storm strengthened, the watch was replaced with a tropical storm warning, and about 15hours prior to its closest approach the warning was replaced with a hurricane warning. Several low-lying citizens in Gonaïves were evacuated after local meteorologists anticipated up to 20inches (500mm) of rain in some mountainous areas. Additionally, authorities advised residents in shanty towns near the ocean to evacuate to emergency shelters.|$|E

5|$|Discontent with Richard's actions {{manifested}} itself in the summer after he took control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> <b>as</b> a conspiracy emerged to displace him from the throne. The rebels were mostly loyalists to Edward IV, who saw Richard as a usurper. Their plans were coordinated by a Lancastrian, Henry's mother Lady Margaret, who was promoting her son {{as a candidate for}} the throne. The highest-ranking conspirator was Buckingham. No chronicles tell of the duke's motive in joining the plot, although historian Charles Ross proposes that Buckingham was trying to distance himself from a king who was becoming increasingly unpopular with the people. Michael Jones and Malcolm Underwood suggest that Margaret deceived Buckingham into thinking the rebels supported him to be king.|$|E
5|$|Forces of the South Korean Republic of Korea Army, {{supported}} by the United States Navy and United States Air Force, defended the eastern coast <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>as</b> {{a part of the}} Pusan Perimeter. When several divisions of the North Korean People's Army crossed through mountainous terrain to push the UN forces back, a complicated battle ensued in the rugged terrain around P'ohang-dong, which contained the vital supply line to the main UN force at Taegu.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, a {{researcher}} in Devon discovered {{a list of}} ingredients for a pasty tucked inside an audit book and dated 1510, calculating the cost of making a venison pasty. This replaced the previous oldest recipe, dated 1746, held by the Cornwall Records Office in Truro, Cornwall. The dish {{at the time was}} cooked with venison, in this case from the Mount Edgcumbe estate, as the pasty was then considered a luxury meal. Alongside the ledger, which included the price of the pasty in Plymouth, Devon, in 1509, the discovery sparked a controversy between the neighbouring counties of Devon and Cornwall as to the origin of the dish. However, the term pasty appears in much earlier written records from other parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> <b>as</b> mentioned above.|$|E

5|$|In the 1980s, {{the sector}} was in crisis, {{characterized}} by low investment, poor cost recovery and poor service quality in most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> <b>As</b> a result, the government {{decided to break}} up INSFOPAL {{at the end of}} the 1980s and to devolve the responsibility for service provision back to the municipalities after four decades, except for some cases like the Valle de Cauca department, where the regional companies continued providing the services. Furthermore, the institutional responsibility for the sector was transferred from the Ministry of Health to the Ministry of Economic Development. This change was not only an administrative change, but it introduced a different focus and perspective to the sector.|$|E

Returning to Paris, Heliade continued to publish works on political and cultural issues, including an analysis of the European situation after the Peace Treaty of 1856 and an 1858 essay on the Bible. In 1859, he published his own translation of the Septuagint, under the name Biblia sacră ce cuprinde Noul şi Vechiul Testament ("The Holy Bible, Comprising the New and Old Testament").|$|E
5|$|On 3 September 1943, Italy {{surrendered}} to the Allied powers. Hoping to occupy as much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>as</b> possible before the German Army could react, the U.S. Fifth Army prepared to attack Salerno. On 10 September, elements of the division conducted its second landing at Agropoli and Paestum with the 36th Infantry Division, on the southernmost beaches of the attack. Opposing them were elements of the German 29th Panzergrenadier Division and XVI Panzer Corps. Against stiff resistance, the 45th pushed to the Calore River {{after a week of}} heavy fighting. The Fifth Army was battered and pushed back by German forces until 20 September, when Allied forces were finally able to break out and establish a more secure beachhead.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the course}} of the 19th and 20th centuries, borscht's {{popularity}} spread beyond its Slavic homeland, largely due to such factors as territorial expansion of the Russian Empire, Russia's growing political clout and cultural stature, and waves of emigration out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> <b>As</b> Russia grew to cover most of northern and central Eurasia, borscht was introduced to the cuisines of various peoples inhabiting the territories both within and adjacent to the empire, from Finland to the Caucasus and Iran, to Central Asia and China, to Alaska (Russian America).|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 20th century, a few Roman Catholics were appointed, but {{concerns}} about {{diversity of the}} Court were mainly in terms of geographic diversity, to represent all geographic regions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> <b>as</b> opposed to ethnic, religious, or gender diversity. The 20th century saw the first appointment of justices who were Jewish (Louis Brandeis, 1916), African-American (Thurgood Marshall, 1967), female (Sandra Day O'Connor, 1981), and Italian-American (Antonin Scalia, 1986). The 21st century saw the first appointment of a Hispanic justice (Sonia Sotomayor, 2009), if justice Benjamin Cardozo, who was a Sephardi Jew of Portuguese descent and appointed in 1932, is excluded.|$|E
5|$|The {{economy of}} Scotland {{developed}} slowly {{in this period}} and a population of perhaps a little under a million {{by the middle of}} the 14th century began to decline after the arrival of the Black Death, falling to perhaps half a million by the beginning of the 16th century. Different social systems and cultures developed in the lowland and highland regions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>as</b> Gaelic remained the most common language north of the Tay and Middle Scots dominated in the south, where it became the language of the ruling elite, government and a new national literature. There were significant changes in religion which saw mendicant friars and new devotions expand, particularly in the developing burghs.|$|E

5|$|The {{island of}} Dominica {{suffered}} severe damage from Hurricane Omar. The village of Scotts Head, {{with a population}} of 450, was cut off from the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>as</b> roads were extensively damaged. The village also suffered water losses, electricity shortage, and landline telephones were cut off. Ports throughout the country were severely damaged. All barge access for hauling sand and stones were destroyed. The airport also sustained some damage. Seven boats ran aground during the storm. Minor damage was reported in Anguilla. Two hotels sustained roof damage, downed treed knocked down power lines causing scattered power outages, and the rough seas caused severe beach erosion. Three cargo ships and seven boats ran aground and two other boats sank.|$|E
5|$|Though {{concentrated}} in London, the outbreak affected other areas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>as</b> well. Perhaps {{the most famous}} example was the village of Eyam in Derbyshire. The plague allegedly arrived with a merchant carrying a parcel of cloth sent from London, although this is a disputed point. The villagers imposed a quarantine on themselves to stop the further spread of the disease. This prevented the disease from moving into surrounding areas but {{the cost to the}} village was the death of around 80% of its inhabitants over a period of fourteen months.|$|E

5|$|Before the {{formation}} of Hurricane Kate, a ridge was located across the southeastern United States {{for much of the}} autumn of 1985; concurrently, a major trough persisted across the western portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> <b>As</b> a result, weather conditions across the Gulf of Mexico and western Atlantic Ocean in November were more typical of the pattern in late September, including sea surface temperatures of 81°F (27°C). On November13, a weak tropical wave began interacting with a trough to the northeast of the Lesser Antilles. It gradually organized due to the favorable conditions, and on November15, a Hurricane Hunters flight into the area indicated the development of a tropical cyclone. As gale force winds were already present, the system was immediately declared Tropical Storm Kate, about 240miles (385km) northeast of San Juan, Puerto Rico.|$|E
5|$|Benito Juárez, {{elected as}} President of Mexico on 19 January 1858, {{suspended}} all repayments on Mexico's foreign debts (save those {{owed to the}} United States), leading France, the United Kingdom, and Spain to send a joint expeditionary force that took Veracruz in December 1861. Juárez then repaid the debts, after which British and Spanish troops withdrew, but Emperor Napoleon III of France used the situation as a pretext to overthrow the republic and install a monarch friendly {{to the interests of}} France. Archduke Maximilian, brother of the Emperor of Austria, was elevated as Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico, thereby re-establishing the Mexican monarchy, but the new emperor ultimately did not bow to Napoleon's wishes, leading the latter to withdraw the majority of his influence from Mexico. Regardless, Maximilian was still viewed as a French puppet, and an illegitimate leader <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> <b>As</b> well, {{at the end of the}} American Civil War, US troops moved to the Mexico-US border as part of a planned invasion, seeing the establishment of the Second Mexican Empire as an infringement on their Monroe Doctrine. Backed by the Americans, ex-president Juárez mobilised to retake power, and defeated Maximilian at Querétaro on 15 May 1867. The Emperor was arraigned before a military tribunal, sentenced to death, and executed at the Cerro de las Campanas on 19 June 1867.|$|E
5|$|Odense is Funen's most {{important}} industrial and commercial centre, and the city's central location in Denmark makes {{it one of}} the national convention and congress centres. Enterprises include the Albani Brewery, ABB (Asea Brown Boveri), Kansas Workwear (clothing), Plus Pack (canning and containers) as well as manufacturers in the electrical sector. In recent years there has been a general trend from manufacturing into the service sector. By 2002, 51% of the workforce was employed by the service sector while only 13% were working in industry. Lindø Wharf, once Denmark's largest shipbuilding facility, has now been converted into Lindø Industrial Park specialising in the production and storage of components for the offshore industries, creating a variety of new tenants.
