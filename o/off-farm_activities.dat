50|$|The {{poor are}} {{particularly}} vulnerable to weather-induced risks simply {{by virtue of their}} poverty. Poor households have few assets to sell and their consumption is already low, so in times of scarcity they do not have much to buffer them from food insecurity. The most vulnerable groups in rural areas are women (who account for 55 percent of the population and 80 percent of the economically active population) and children under five years of age. Survival strategies to secure sufficient food supply and minimize risk include diversification of agricultural activities, development of <b>off-farm</b> <b>activities,</b> seasonal or permanent migration and wage labour. Nevertheless, vulnerability of Madagascar’s population has been worsened over years of natural disasters, political instability, and limited investment in social infrastructure, with coping mechanisms largely exhausted. Environmental degradation and soil erosion has further harmed rural populations’ ability to cope.|$|E

At the household level, we distinguish three types of diversification as opposed to grain production only: within farm (non-grain production) activities, local <b>off-farm</b> <b>activities,</b> and migration. We find that land availability stimulates on-farm diversification.

At the individual level, we analyze the determinants of participation in three different types of jobs as compared to agricultural work: local off-farm employment, local self-employment and migration. We find a clear gender and age bias in access to <b>off-farm</b> <b>activities</b> that are mostly undertaken by male and by young people.

The aim of the present study is to explore further the demographic and economic determinants of the dynamics of income diversification using survey data. The data used in this study cover larger and more representative sample and was colleted from rural Ethiopia during 1994 and 1997 harvest years. This study investigates not only the determinants of participation and intensity of <b>off-farm</b> <b>activities,</b> but also factors that affect the dynamics between 1994 and 1997. The results of this study attempt to answer the question: to what extent initial conditions (for instance, asset holdings, production, and crop income) prompt households to diversify to <b>off-farm</b> <b>activities</b> overtime. The results show that participation in <b>off-farm</b> <b>activities</b> is mainly driven by demographic factors, whereas land and other asset ownership as well as crop production and income affect intensity of <b>off-farm</b> <b>activities.</b> The dynamic model results show that farm families who have initially diversified to more <b>off-farm</b> <b>activities</b> subsequently realized less income diversification.

Theory on such 'forest transitions' describes urbanization and agricultural modernization as underling factors. Tropical country governments may seek to harness these factors to promote a tropical forest transition within the REDD+ scheme. Yet tropical forest transitions remain poorly described due to limited data and inappropriate modeling. To determine {{the nature of a}} tropical forest transition I derive canonical correlations of (a) socio-agrarian transformation observed via respondent-level census records and (b) forest-cover change observed via satellite imagery, for 82 % of Panamanian counties over 1980 – 1990 – 2000 – 2008.
