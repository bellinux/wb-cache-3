5|$|The IUCN {{states that}} about half of the {{estimated}} total population lives in protected areas and 30% <b>on</b> <b>private</b> <b>land.</b> Protected areas that support major populations include Omo (Ethiopia), Serengeti, Katavi, Ruaha and Selous-Kilombero (Tanzania), Kafue and North Luangwa (Zambia), Nyika (Malawi), Etosha (Namibia), Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park (Botswana/South Africa) and Ukhahlamba Drakensberg Park (South Africa). Most of these populations appear to be stable. Relatively large numbers of common eland now live <b>on</b> <b>private</b> <b>land,</b> particularly in Namibia, Zimbabwe and South Africa, reflecting its value as a trophy animal. Common elands have also been widely domesticated in Zimbabwe, South Africa and Kenya, as well as in Russia and Ukraine.|$|E

5|$|Canada is home {{to about}} 52,000â€“60,000 wolves, whose legal status varies {{according}} to province and territory. First Nations residents may hunt wolves without restriction, and some provinces require licenses for residents to hunt wolves while others do not. In Alberta, wolves <b>on</b> <b>private</b> <b>land</b> may be baited and hunted by the landowner without requiring a license, and in some areas, wolf hunting bounty programs exist.

When the next congressional session opened in December 1816, Sharp reversed his position and voted to repeal the law, but the damage was already done; he lost his seat in the House in the next election.|$|E
5|$|Threats to B.cuneata include land clearing, {{which leads}} to direct plant loss and {{population}} fragmentation, grazing pressure, competition from exotic weeds, changes to the fire regime, and encroaching salinity. The Banksia Atlas survey found one population {{to be on the}} side of a road; the plants were aging with no new seedlings noted, and the site was weed-infested. A large part of the surviving populations are <b>on</b> <b>private</b> <b>land,</b> and depend on good relationships with local landowners. Many have obliged by fencing off areas and restricting entry of rabbits. There has been some attempt by CALM to translocate populations away from hazardous areas; these have met with some success, helped with watering in the first year.|$|E
5|$|Upstream of Lick Run, 13 {{percent of}} Roaring Creek is {{on public land}} that is open to access. The {{remaining}} 87 percent is <b>on</b> <b>private</b> <b>land</b> that is closed to access. The remaining reaches of the creek are entirely <b>on</b> <b>private</b> <b>land,</b> but open to access. As of 2000, approximately 3,500 people live in the watershed. In section 01, the population density of the watershed is 18 people per square kilometer as of 2000. In section 02, the population density is 22 people per square kilometer and in section 03, the population density is 16 people per square kilometer. In section 01 of the creek, 50 percent of its length is within 100 meters of a road, 89 percent is within 300 meters, and 91 percent is within 500 meters. In section 02, 28 percent is within 100 meters, 87 percent is within 300 meters, and 100 percent is within 500 meters. In section 03, 96 percent of its length is within 100 meters of a road, 98 percent is within 300 meters of one, and 100 percent is within 500 meters of one.

5|$|Many populations, {{particularly}} in the Sydney region, inhabit areas of infrequent disturbance, such as golf courses, disused industrial land, brick pits, and landfill areas. Though {{once one of the}} most common frogs in south-east Australia, the green and golden bell frog has endured major population declines, {{particularly in}} highland areas, leading to its current classification as globally vulnerable. Its numbers have continued to fall and are threatened by habitat loss and degradation, pollution, introduced species, and parasites and pathogens, including the chytrid Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. As most of the remaining populations live <b>on</b> <b>private</b> <b>land,</b> the logistics of the conservation effort can be complicated. Despite the situation in Australia, some frog populations have survived with more success in New Zealand and several other Pacific islands, where it has been introduced. However, unfortunately even in these areas the population of green and golden bell has been rapidly declining in the past few decades.|$|E
5|$|According to the Provisional Population Totals 2011 {{census of}} India, the {{population}} of Gangtok Municipal Corporation has been estimated to be 98,658.

The Gangtok subdivision of the East Sikkim district had a population of 281,293, Gangtok has an average literacy rate of 82.17%, higher than the national average of 74%: male literacy is 85.33%, and female literacy is 78.68. About 8% of Gangtok's population live in the nine notified slums and squatter settlements, all on Government land. More people live in areas that depict slum-like characteristics but have not been notified as slums yet because they have developed <b>on</b> <b>private</b> <b>land.</b> Of the total urban population of Sikkim, Gangtok Municipal Corporation has a share of 55.5%. Including Gangtok, East District has a share of 88% of the total urban population. The quality of life, the pace of development and availability of basic infrastructure and employment prospects has been the major cause for rapid migration to the city. With this migration, the urban services are under pressure, intensified by the lack of availability of suitable land for infrastructure development.|$|E

5|$|In East Africa, {{the blue}} {{wildebeest}} {{is the most}} abundant big game species; some populations perform an annual migration to new grazing grounds, but the black wildebeest is merely nomadic. Breeding in both takes place over {{a short period of}} time at the end of the rainy season and the calves are soon active and are able to move with the herd, a fact necessary for their survival. Nevertheless, some fall prey to large carnivores, especially the spotted hyena. Wildebeest often graze in mixed herds with zebra which gives heightened awareness of potential predators. They are also alert to the warning signals emitted by other animals such as baboons. Wildebeest are a tourist attraction but compete with domesticated livestock for pasture and are sometimes blamed by farmers for transferring diseases and parasites to their cattle. Some illegal hunting goes on but the population trend is fairly stable and some populations are in national parks or <b>on</b> <b>private</b> <b>land.</b> The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists both as least-concern species.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} this species {{includes}} Northern Arkansas and southern Missouri, East to the Appalachian Mountains and Ohio River Basin, North into New England, southern Ontario and Quebec. Distribution of the bats is spotty within their entire range, and they {{are considered to be}} very uncommon. These bats prefer to reside in deciduous or coniferous forests. They are active in mountain ranges from 240â€“1125 meters in height. During the spring, summer, and autumn they prefer to roost at emergent rock-outcrops such as cliffs, bluffs, shale barrens, and talus slopes, as well as man-made structures, including buildings, joints between segments of cement guard rails, turnpike tunnels, road-cuts, and scree covered dams. The largest populations of Myotis leibii have been found in New York, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Western Virginia. (red list) The total count of individuals in all hibernacula in which they have been found is 3,000, with roughly 60% of the total number from just two sites in New York. Unfortunately, 90% of their habitat is <b>on</b> <b>private</b> <b>land</b> which makes it difficult to protect them.|$|E
5|$|Australian ravens die {{most often}} by being shot or poisonedâ€”generally by farmers. Despite their fondness for roadkill, fewer ravens are hit by {{vehicles}} than Australian magpies. Research in the 1950s and 60s showed that 64% of Australian ravens perished {{in their first}} year of life. Immature birds are most at risk of dying as {{they are more likely to}} come into conflict with farmers. The Australian Raven is a peaceful bird, showing no aggression toward humans or other birds without reason. However, the Australian raven is frequently blamed for the loss of young lambs. Scientific observation in the country's southeast showed that the killing of healthy lambs was rare, but that sick animals were predisposed to being attacked. Australian ravens mostly eat faeces (often from the lamb's anus), afterbirth or stillborn lambs. Newborn lamb faeces is nutritious, containing around 21â€“44% protein, 9â€“37% fat and 10â€“30% carbohydrate. It has the consistency of treacle and often sticks to the lamb's hindquarters or tail. The raven bites a sleeping lamb's tail, holding on and walking behind it when it wakes up. A healthy lamb would respond by running away or butting the bird, but a sick one might not respond and be attacked further as it alerts the bird that it is vulnerable. Wounded lambs can also succumb to Clostridium infection as these bacteria are present on raven bills. Ravens bring some benefits to agricultural areas as they clean away carrion and eat insects that are potentially damaging to crops. In areas of Western Australia, the species is classified as a Declared Pest of Agriculture under the provisions of the Agriculture and Related Resources Protection Act 1976, meaning that shooting <b>on</b> <b>private</b> <b>land</b> in rural areas is legal, although should be considered only after other options have been exhausted.|$|E
