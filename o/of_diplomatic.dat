5|$|Elizabeth {{remained}} {{close to}} Dudley and he, with her blessing {{and on her}} prompting, pursued his suit for her hand in an atmosphere <b>of</b> <b>diplomatic</b> intrigue.

5|$|In December 1804, an Anglo-Swedish {{agreement}} led to {{the creation}} of the Third Coalition.

Having been defeated twice in recent memory by France, and being keen on revenge, Austria joined the coalition a few months later.|$|E
5|$|In {{most cases}} hatt-ı humayuns {{were written by}} the Sultan himself {{although}} there exist some that were penned by the chief scribe or another functionary. Important hatt-ı humayuns on the white were sometimes drafted by the head <b>of</b> <b>diplomatic</b> correspondence (Reis-ül Kuttab) or the Secretary of Navy (Kapudan Paşa). In some cases, there were notations as to who prepared the draft of the document that was then re-written by the Sultan.|$|E

50|$|All {{these matters}} {{fall within the}} scope <b>of</b> <b>diplomatics,</b> and all offer {{different}} tests for the authenticity of any given document. There are other details which often need to be considered, for example the Tironian notes (or shorthand), which are of not infrequent occurrence in primitive Urkunden, both papal and imperial. A special section in any comprehensive study <b>of</b> <b>diplomatics</b> {{is also likely to}} be devoted to spurious documents: the number is surprisingly great.|$|R

5|$|Such open {{display of}} anti-British {{feelings}} and humiliation prompted the Governor General {{of the time}} Richard Wellesley to recall Knox to India and unilaterally suspend the diplomatic ties. The Treaty of 1801 was also unilaterally annulled by the British on 24 January 1804. The suspension <b>of</b> <b>diplomatic</b> ties also gave the Governor General a pretext to allow the ex-King Rana Bahadur to return to Nepal unconditionally.|$|E

Results show that, although diplomatics is a secular technique, it can be perfectly adapted to the contemporary context, addressing issues related to the origin of digital documents...|$|R

5|$|Byzantines availed {{themselves}} {{of a number}} <b>of</b> <b>diplomatic</b> practices. For example, embassies to the capital would often stay on for years. A member of other royal houses would routinely be requested to stay on in Constantinople, {{not only as a}} potential hostage, but also as a useful pawn in case political conditions where he came from changed. Another key practice was to overwhelm visitors by sumptuous displays. According to Dimitri Obolensky, the preservation of the ancient civilisation in Europe was due to the skill and resourcefulness of Byzantine diplomacy, which remains one of Byzantium's lasting contributions to the history of Europe.|$|E

Mutual suspicion between the British and the Russians eased in the face of several French political mistakes and by April 1805 the two had signed a treaty of alliance.

40|$|Guo Songtao was {{the first}} {{minister}} sent abroad in modern China. My thesis aims to examine and assess the origin and development <b>of</b> his <b>diplomatic</b> thought, especially as reflected in his diplomatic activities. It comprises four chapters. The first introduces Guo's traditional scholarship with emphasis on his Neo-Confucianism background. The second deals with the formation <b>of</b> Guo's <b>diplomatic</b> thought before he was appointed as minister to Britain and France. The third is about the finalization <b>of</b> Guo's <b>diplomatic</b> pattern and its development after he became a minister from three aspects <b>of</b> basic <b>diplomatic</b> principles and attitudes, the standpoints <b>of</b> making <b>diplomatic</b> strategy and the choice of tactics. The last chapter studies Guo's understanding and application of the International Law. As I see, to some extent, Guo has gone beyond the framework of "zhong-ti-xi-yong" formula advocated {{by most of the}} other supporters of the Self-strengthen Movement...|$|R
40|$|Scholars <b>of</b> <b>diplomatics</b> {{never had}} a {{fundamental}} opposition on using modern technology to support their research. Nevertheless no technology since the introduction of photography had such an impact on questions and methods <b>of</b> <b>diplomatics</b> as the computer had. This book discusses the methodological consequences <b>of</b> doing <b>diplomatic</b> research on huge corpora and fast text mining technologies. It gives examples of how to enlarge the digitised charter corpus and demonstrates research applying information technology on medieval and early modern charters asking pure diplomatic questions as well as doing historical or philological research. It presents results of the international conference held on the 30 th September- 1 st October 2011 in Naples, the second conference {{in a series of}} meetings initiated in 2007 (Munich) and continuing in 2013 (Paris-Aubervilliers). It aims at giving historians, diplomatists and IT specialists an intense insight where the digital turn in historical sciences has led diplomatics so far...|$|R

5|$|Internationally, {{the treaty}} pushed American {{diplomatic}} relations away from France and towards Great Britain, as the French government {{concluded that it}} violated the Franco-American treaty of 1778, and that the U.S. government had accepted the treaty against the overwhelming public sentiment against it. This set up a series <b>of</b> <b>diplomatic</b> and political conflicts over the ensuing four years, culminating in {{what became known as}} the Quasi-War. The Jay Treaty also helped ensure American control of its own frontier lands. After the signing of treaty, the British withdrew their support from several Native Americans tribes, while the Spanish, fearing that the Jay Treaty signaled the creation of an Anglo-American alliance, sought to appease the United States.|$|E

He was also one of three men who were instructed, in a letter of 3 February 1449, to not attend the forthcoming parliament and remain in the north guarding the border.

5|$|Kennan {{found it}} {{difficult}} to perform his job in Belgrade. President Josip Broz Tito and his foreign minister, Koča Popović, began to suspect that Kennedy would adopt an anti-Yugoslav policy during his term. Tito and Popović considered Kennedy's decision to observe Captive Nations Week as an indication that the United States would assist anticommunist liberation efforts in Yugoslavia. Tito also believed that the CIA and the Pentagon were the true directors of American foreign policy. Kennan attempted to restore Tito's confidence in the American foreign policy establishment but his efforts were compromised by a pair <b>of</b> <b>diplomatic</b> blunders, the Bay of Pigs Invasion, and the U-2 spy incident.|$|E
