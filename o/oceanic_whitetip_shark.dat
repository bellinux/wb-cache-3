5|$|The {{rules of}} the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature are that in general the first-published {{description}} has priority; therefore, the valid scientific name for the <b>oceanic</b> <b>whitetip</b> <b>shark</b> should be Carcharhinus maou. However, Lesson's name remained forgotten {{for so long that}} Carcharhinus longimanus remains widely accepted.|$|E
5|$|The <b>oceanic</b> <b>whitetip</b> <b>shark</b> (Carcharhinus longimanus), {{also known}} as Brown Milbert's sand bar shark, brown shark, nigano shark, oceanic white-tipped whaler, and silvertip shark, is a large pelagic requiem shark inhabiting {{tropical}} and warm temperate seas. Its stocky body is most notable for its long, white-tipped, rounded fins.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{morphological}} similarities, Jack Garrick in 1982 grouped {{this species}} with the bignose shark (C. altimus) and the sandbar shark (C. plumbeus), while Leonard Compagno in 1988 placed {{it as the}} sister species of the grey reef shark (C. amblyrhynchos). A phylogenetic analysis based on allozyme data, published by Gavin Naylor in 1992, indicated that the Caribbean reef shark is the sister taxon to a clade formed by the Galapagos shark (C. galapagensis), dusky shark (C. obscurus), <b>oceanic</b> <b>whitetip</b> <b>shark</b> (C. longimanus), and the blue shark (Prionace glauca). However, more work is required to fully resolve the interrelationships within Carcharhinus.|$|E
5|$|Sharks can {{be highly}} social, {{remaining}} in large schools. Sometimes more than 100 scalloped hammerheads congregate around seamounts and islands, e.g., in the Gulf of California. Cross-species social hierarchies exist. For example, <b>oceanic</b> <b>whitetip</b> <b>sharks</b> dominate silky sharks of comparable size during feeding.|$|R
5|$|Carcharhiniformes: Commonly {{known as}} ground sharks, the order {{includes}} the blue, tiger, bull, grey reef, blacktip reef, Caribbean reef, blacktail reef, <b>whitetip</b> reef, and <b>oceanic</b> <b>whitetip</b> <b>sharks</b> (collectively called the requiem sharks) {{along with the}} houndsharks, catsharks, and hammerhead sharks. They are distinguished by an elongated snout and a nictitating membrane which protects the eyes during an attack.|$|R
40|$|Time {{series of}} depth data, {{obtained}} for 6 <b>oceanic</b> <b>whitetip</b> <b>sharks</b> (Carcharhinus longimanus) tagged with pop-up satellite archival tags, were analyzed in detail. The {{aim was to}} improve {{our knowledge of the}} vertical behavior of this species. Individuals were tagged in the Atlantic Ocean (n= 5) and Indian Ocean (n= 1) between 2011 and 2012. Deployment periods for these tags varied from 100 to 178 d. The sharks spent most of their time in the mixed layer, displaying the typical behavior of an epipelagic species. However, analyses revealed complex vertical movement patterns, including marked diel changes that reflect 3 different types of behavior. Results of the generalized additive models indicate that vertical movements were strongly correlated with variations in the depth of the mixed layer. A correlation between vertical movements and sea-surface temperature (SST) was also observed. When SST was above average, <b>oceanic</b> <b>whitetip</b> <b>sharks</b> increased their vertical amplitude, disregarding the reduction of the mixed layer. Thermoregulation likely allows this type of vertical movement...|$|R
5|$|More recently, Gavin Naylor's 1992 phylogenetic analysis, {{based on}} {{allozyme}} sequence data, {{found that the}} silky shark {{is part of a}} group containing large sharks with a ridge between the dorsal fins. One branch within this group contains the sandbar shark (C.plumbeus) and the bignose shark (C.altimus), while the silky shark is the basal member of the other branch and the sister taxon to a clade containing the Caribbean reef shark (C.perezi), Galapagos shark (C.galapagensis), <b>oceanic</b> <b>whitetip</b> <b>shark</b> (C.longimanus), dusky shark (C.obscurus), and blue shark (Prionace glauca). Mine Dosay-Abkulut's 2008 ribosomal DNA analysis, which included the silky, blue, and bignose sharks, confirmed the closeness of those three species.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{conducted}} off the Florida {{coast and}} the Bahamas {{have shown that}} silky sharks are highly sensitive to sound, in particular low-frequency (10–20Hz), irregular pulses. Experiments in which these sounds were played underwater attracted sharks from hundreds of meters away. Silky sharks likely orient to these sounds because they {{are similar to the}} noise generated by feeding animals such as birds or dolphins, thus indicating promising sources of food. These studies have also demonstrated that a silky shark attracted by one sound will quickly withdraw if that sound abruptly changes in amplitude or character; this change need not be a sound produced by a predator to evoke the reaction. Over repeated exposures, silky sharks habituate to the sound change and stop withdrawing, though it takes them much longer to do so compared to the bolder <b>oceanic</b> <b>whitetip</b> <b>shark.</b>|$|E
5|$|Teeth {{belonging}} to the dusky shark are fairly well represented in the fossil record, though assigning Carcharhinus teeth to species can be problematic. Dusky shark teeth dating to the Miocene (23-5.3 Ma) have been recovered from the Kendeace and Grand Bay formations in Carriacou, the Grenadines, the Moghra Formation in Egypt, Polk County, Florida, and possibly Cerro La Cruz in northern Venezuela. Teeth dating to the Late Miocene or Early Pliocene (11.6-3.6 Ma) are abundant in the Yorktown Formation and the Pungo River, North Carolina, and from the Chesapeake Bay region; these teeth differ slightly from the modern dusky shark, and have often been misidentified as {{belonging to}} the <b>oceanic</b> <b>whitetip</b> <b>shark</b> (C. longimanus). Dusky shark teeth have also been recovered from the vicinity of two baleen whales in North Carolina, one preserved in Goose Creek Limestone dating to the Late Pliocene (c. 3.5 Ma), {{and the other in}} mud dating to the Pleistocene-Holocene (c. 12,000 years ago).|$|E
40|$|Foundation {{appreciate}} {{the opportunity to}} express our views on key shark conservation issues under consideration by the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC). Our organizations maintain a special focus on shark conservation {{due in large part}} to the low reproductive capacity that leaves most shark species exceptionally vulnerable to overexploitation. We commend the WCPFC for identifying key shark species and dedicating resources to the comprehensive scientific investigation and assessment of regional shark populations and related fishery impacts. We believe that this remarkable work sets the WCPFC apart from most Regional Fishery Management Organizations (RFMOs) and serves as a sound basis for conservation action. We are deeply concerned, however, that an estimated 7 % (or less) of the shark catch in the Western Central Pacific Ocean (WCPO) is controlled (through domestic catch limits), and that the WCPFC, unlike most other RFMOs, has yet to adopt species-specific shark conservation measures. Our specific concerns and science-based recommendations are detailed below. <b>Oceanic</b> <b>Whitetip</b> <b>Sharks</b> Strong evidence of the serious depletion of <b>oceanic</b> <b>whitetip</b> <b>sharks</b> (Carcharhinu...|$|R

500|$|Dr. Christopher Neff, {{a policy}} analyst at the University of Sydney, argues that terms like [...] "attack" [...] are laden with {{cultural}} stigmatization. Instead of the word [...] "attack", he proposes labeling human-shark interactions, {{on a scale of}} extremity, as encounters, minor bites, moderate bites and fatal bites. The term [...] "attack" [...] is only appropriate in specific instances where specialists can confirm the predatory nature of the shark-human encounter, which is extremely difficult to do. While many encounters with <b>oceanic</b> <b>whitetip</b> <b>sharks</b> appear predatory in nature, without the verification of a scientific community in each instance, it is best to assume the accidental or nonpredatory intent of the encounters.|$|R
5|$|The {{silky shark}} {{is one of}} the three most common pelagic sharks along with the blue and oceanic whitetip sharks, and counts among the most {{numerous}} large oceanic animals in the world with a population of at least tens of millions. Compared to the other two species, it is less strictly pelagic with the greatest numbers found in offshore waters associated with land, where food is more readily obtained than farther out in the truly open ocean. The silky shark is an active, inquisitive, and aggressive predator, though it will defer to the slower but more powerful <b>oceanic</b> <b>whitetip</b> <b>shark</b> in competitive situations. When approaching something of interest, it may seem inattentive, sedately circling and sometimes swinging its head from side to side. However, it can respond with startling swiftness to any shift in its immediate surroundings. This shark is often found around floating objects such as logs or tethered naval buoys.|$|E
25|$|The {{range of}} tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier), <b>oceanic</b> <b>whitetip</b> <b>shark</b> (Carcharhinus longimanus) and mako shark (Isurus) {{includes}} the ocean around Tuvalu. The mako {{is known as}} rokea in the Tuvaluan language.|$|E
500|$|The <b>oceanic</b> <b>whitetip</b> <b>shark,</b> {{or lesser}} white shark was {{described}} in 1831 by naturalist René-Primevère Lesson, who named the shark Carcharhinus maou.

The species epithet [...] refers {{to the size of}} its pectoral fins ( [...] translates from Latin as [...] "long hands"). The <b>oceanic</b> <b>whitetip</b> <b>shark</b> has many common names in English: Brown Milbert's sand bar shark, brown shark, nigano shark, oceanic white-tipped whaler, and whitetip shark.|$|E
5|$|Three {{types of}} habitats, mangroves, reefs and seagrasses, {{are found in}} Puerto Rico's ocean waters. A total of 677 fish species live in these habitats; 242 being reef species. Fish species found in Puerto Rican reefs are {{representative}} of the general Caribbean fauna. Common reef fishes include wrasses, damselfishes, white grunts (Haemulon plumieri), bluestriped grunts (Haemulon sciurus), queen parrotfish (Scarus vetula), and sharks (family Carcharhinidae). Sea breams (Archosargus rhomboidalis) and yellowfin mojarras (Gerres cinereus) are some of the species commonly found in mangrove habitats. Other species of interest include flatfishes, with 21 recorded species, and sharks, with more than 20 species. <b>Oceanic</b> <b>whitetip</b> <b>sharks</b> and silky sharks are common in the Mona Passage.|$|R
5|$|Pelagic {{stingrays}} may segregate by sex, vertically in {{that males}} {{are found in}} deeper water than females, and perhaps horizontally as well. Captive individuals often act highly aggressively towards ocean sunfish (Mola mola), biting and harassing them, particularly if they are hungry. This species is preyed upon by <b>oceanic</b> <b>whitetip</b> <b>sharks</b> (Carcharhinus longimanus), great white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias), toothed whales, and other large, ocean-going carnivores. Its all-around dark coloration likely serves to camouflage it against its featureless habitat. The venom on its tail spine is also quite potent, causing it to be avoided by other fishes. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Acanthobothrium benedeni, A. crassicolle, and A. filicolle, Rhinebothrium baeri and R. palombii, and Tetragonocephalum uarnak, and the monogenean Entobdella diadema.|$|R
50|$|That first close {{encounter}} dive {{demonstrated that}} Great Whites are not built only to devour people but are very curious {{and can be}} quite 'friendly'.

Like the other members of its family, this species possesses blood vessel countercurrent exchange systems called the rete mirabilia (Latin for [...] "wonderful net", singular rete mirabile) in its trunk musculature and around its eyes and brain.

40|$|This paper {{follows from}} the {{estimation}} of catch rates and catches of key shark species submitted the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) Scientific Committee (SC 7, Lawson 2011). The developments presented here include additional analyses of the SPC data holdings for <b>oceanic</b> <b>whitetip</b> <b>sharks</b> (Carcharhinus longimanus; OCS) and silky sharks (Carcharinus falciformis; FAL) caught in longline and purse seine fisheries in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPO). <b>Oceanic</b> <b>whitetip</b> and silky <b>sharks</b> {{are some of the}} most commonly caught bycatch species in pelagic tuna longline and purse seine fisheries, however the quantity and quality of historical shark catch data are often poor (Camhi et al. 2008, Clarke et al 2011). A main driver of this is that sharks have long been considered non‐target species and as such are often either inaccurately recorded in vessel logbooks or entirely un‐recorded. A surge in the shark fin trade in the 1990 s (Clarke 2009), combined with the practice of shark finning (i. e. retention of fins while discarding the carcasses at sea), has led to increased interest in the impact of fishing on shark populations (Clarke et al. 2007, Clarke and Harley 2010, Lawson 2011).

50|$|The third {{programme}} {{begins in}} the tropics, where a white sperm whale calf stays close to its mother. The 19th-century story of the Essex, with its whalemen stranded in their lifeboats after a sperm whale attack is used to illustrate the difficulty of surviving in the open ocean. The currents that circle the South Pacific support huge shoals and an incredible variety of life, {{but much of the}} centre is an ocean desert. Nutrients are trapped at depth by the thermocline, making the windless surface clear but barren. Life can be tough for large predators. Some, including short-finned pilot whales, can dive to great depths to hunt squid. Others, such as rare <b>oceanic</b> <b>whitetip</b> <b>sharks,</b> track the whales hoping for scraps or a chance to seize a young calf. The waters around the Galápagos teem with life thanks to the cool, nutrient-rich Antarctic current. Underwater footage shows penguins, manta rays, and sea lions feeding. The sea lions work together to divide shoals into smaller bait balls, and blow bubbles into the reef to scare fish out. Seabirds are great ocean wanderers, but all must return to land to breed. On French Frigate Shoals, frigatebirds take sooty tern chicks from their nests, whilst offshore a dozen tiger sharks snatch any unfortunate black-footed albatross chicks that get their maiden flight wrong. Dusky dolphins and bull sperm whales are filmed in the waters off New Zealand, where rescue boats guide an exhausted whale beached in a shallow bay back out to sea.|$|R
40|$|<b>Oceanic</b> <b>whitetip</b> <b>sharks</b> (Carcharhinus longimanus) have {{recently}} been targeted for conservation in the western North Atlantic following severe declines in abundance. Pop-up satellite archival tags were applied to 11 mature <b>oceanic</b> <b>whitetips</b> (10 females, 1 male) near Cat Island in the central Bahamas 1 - 8 May 2011 {{to provide information about}} the horizontal and vertical movements of this species. Another large female was opportunistically tagged in the U. S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Data from 1, 563 total tracking days and 1, 142, 598 combined depth and temperature readings were obtained. Sharks tagged at Cat Island stayed within 500 km of the tagging site for ~ 30 days before dispersing across 16, 422 km(2) of the western North Atlantic. Maximum individual displacement from the tagging site ranged from 290 - 1940 km after times at liberty from 30 - 245 days, with individuals moving to several different destinations (the northern Lesser Antilles, the northern Bahamas, and north of the Windward Passage). Many sharks returned to The Bahamas after ~ 150 days. Estimated residency times within The Bahamas EEZ, where longlining and commercial trade of sharks is illegal, were generally high (mean = 68. 2 % of time). Sharks spent 99. 7 % of their time shallower than 200 m and did not exhibit differences in day and night mean depths. There was a positive correlation between daily sea surface temperature and mean depth occupied, suggesting possible behavioral thermoregulation. All individuals made short duration (mean = 13. 06 minutes) dives into the mesopelagic zone (down to 1082 m and 7. 75 °C), which occurred significantly more often at night. Ascent rates during these dives were significantly slower than descent rates, suggesting that these dives are for foraging. The sharks tracked appear to be most vulnerable to pelagic fishing gear deployed from 0 - 125 m depths, which they may encounter from June to October after leaving the protected waters of The Bahamas EEZ...|$|R
