5|$|Anna Maria Rückerschöld (5 February 1725–25 May 1805), born Rücker, was a Swedish {{author who}} wrote several popular books on {{housekeeping}} and {{cooking in the}} late 18th and early 19th century. She was an advocate of women's right to a good education in household matters and propagated this view in public debate through an anonymous letter in 1770. Along with Cajsa Warg and <b>other</b> <b>female</b> cookbook authors, she was an influential figure in culinary matters in early modern Sweden.|$|E
5|$|New York City actress Ash ("Liz") Sroka voices Tali {{throughout}} the Mass Effect trilogy, her first {{role in a}} video game. Sroka auditioned for three different roles: the female Commander Shepard, Tali'Zorah, and one <b>other</b> <b>female</b> character. After initially receiving the role of Tali, she was still unsure of how much material there was. Ginny McSwain gave voice direction, and would generally take two takes—the first to use, the second as back-up, and occasionally a third or more if the recording did not fit with what she wanted. Recording sessions would generally last about four hours. Sroka herself is not a gamer, though she says she enjoys the character of Tali and is happy to have landed the role.|$|E
5|$|Ruth {{is portrayed}} as being strong-willed, {{determined}} and loyal. She is also a New Woman and a farmer, traits that made her {{stand out from the}} <b>other</b> <b>female</b> characters in The Archers {{at the time of her}} introduction. In later years, Ruth has mellowed and is more open to negotiation. Her storylines have often revolved around her marriage to David and her work on Brookfield Farm. In the early 2000s, the scriptwriters had Ruth and David isolate themselves from the community during a foot-and-mouth outbreak. Ruth was also diagnosed with breast cancer, a storyline which Finch undertook extensive research for and later named as one of her Archers highlights.|$|E

25|$|The {{relationships}} between the queen and the breeding males may last for many years; <b>other</b> <b>females</b> are temporarily sterile. Queens live from 13 to 18years, and are extremely hostile to <b>other</b> <b>females</b> behaving like queens, or producing hormones for becoming queens. When the queen dies, another female takes her place, sometimes after a violent struggle with her competitors. Once established, the new queen's body expands {{the space between the}} vertebrae in her backbone to become longer and ready to bear pups.|$|R
5|$|She {{moved to}} New York City {{with her mother}} and took rooms in the National Arts Club in Gramercy Park, Manhattan. Around 1905, Coffin set up her own office at the National Arts Club and began taking commissions, using her family {{connections}} to find work. She was ideally situated; it was the height of the Country Place Era, when wealthy East Coast Americans were eager to develop elaborate European-style gardens for their estates. Coffin was well-connected in such circles, widely traveled, came from a good family, was professionally trained and was known for her good taste. She also joined the American Society of Landscape Architects, which had two <b>other</b> <b>female</b> members at the time.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} {{has been both}} criticised and praised by several commentators. Some viewed her as a competent and professional soldier, and considered her to be less sexualised than <b>other</b> <b>female</b> gaming characters due to her military clothing. Others, however, argued that she was weakened as the protagonist by features that undermined her role as heroine, and criticised some of her sexualised costumes that players receive as rewards for completing certain tasks within the games.|$|E

The first section {{features}} her escaping from prison along with <b>other</b> <b>female</b> inmates. The second segment displays upbeat dance numbers and ends with a performance inspired by Marilyn Monroe. The third section features an Egyptian theme with fireworks and acrobatics. The fourth segment displays energetic routines and motorcycle costumes. The encore begins with a video interlude of Spears capturing the stalker, and is followed by two performances in which she defeats a group of ninjas.|$|E
40|$|Here {{we examine}} the effects of {{maternal}} kinship, reciprocity, and dominance rank on the social relationships of female baboons (Papio cynocephalus ursinus) in a well-habituated, free-ranging group in the Okavango Delta of Botswana. These data are useful for testing comparative hypotheses about the ecological and demographic factors that shape the evolu-tion of social organization in primates and other animals. In this group, adult females had well-differentiated grooming relationships with one another, and limited their grooming to a relatively small subset of available partners. Although there were 19 adult females in the group, the average female groomed only 8 <b>other</b> <b>females,</b> and devoted at least 5 % of her grooming to only four <b>other</b> <b>females.</b> Females groomed maternal kin at signi cantly higher rates and for signi cantly longer periods than they groomed <b>other</b> <b>females.</b> The bias in favo...|$|R

5|$|This {{is a large}} duck, and the male's long central tail {{feathers}} {{give rise}} to the species' English and scientific names. Both sexes have blue-grey bills and grey legs and feet. The drake is more striking, having a thin white stripe running {{from the back of}} its chocolate-coloured head down its neck to its mostly white undercarriage. The drake also has attractive grey, brown, and black patterning on its back and sides. The hen's plumage is more subtle and subdued, with drab brown feathers similar to those of <b>other</b> <b>female</b> dabbling ducks. Hens make a coarse quack and the drakes a flute-like whistle.|$|E
5|$|After Baby {{discovers that}} Johnny's dance partner, Penny Johnson (Cynthia Rhodes), is {{pregnant}} by Robbie Gould (Max Cantor), a womanizing waiter {{who is also}} dating and cheating on Baby's older sister, Lisa (Jane Brucker) and several <b>other</b> <b>female</b> guests, she borrows money from her father {{to pay for an}} illegal abortion for Penny. Jake agrees to give the money to Baby even though she says she can't tell him what it's for. Penny eventually accepts the money, but says there is another issue. Johnny and Penny perform a weekly dance at the Sheldrake, another nearby resort. Penny will miss her performance if she goes for the abortion, and they will forfeit their salary for the season. Billy suggests that Baby fill in for her. Johnny scoffs at this, which overcomes Baby's initial resistance. Billy and Penny insist that Johnny can teach anyone to dance. Johnny begins to teach Baby the mambo, and the two spend several awkward practice sessions together. Baby gradually begins to improve, and a romantic attraction grows between them.|$|E
5|$|At this point, Murray had no {{experience}} in field archaeology, and so during the 1902–03 field season, she travelled to Egypt to join Petrie's excavations at Abydos. Petrie and his wife, Hilda Petrie, had been excavating at the site since 1899, having taken over the archaeological investigation from French Coptic scholar Émile Amélineau. Murray at first joined as site nurse, but was subsequently taught how to excavate by Petrie and given a senior position. This led to some issues {{with some of the}} male excavators, who disliked the idea of taking orders from a woman. This experience, coupled with discussions with <b>other</b> <b>female</b> excavators (some of whom were active in the feminist movement) led Murray to adopt openly feminist viewpoints. While excavating at Abydos, Murray uncovered the Osireion, a temple devoted to the god Osiris which had been constructed by order of Pharaoh Seti I during the period of the New Kingdom. She published her site report as The Osireion at Abydos in 1904; in the report, she examined the inscriptions that had been discovered at the site to discern the purpose and use of the building.|$|E
5000|$|Females often parasitize {{their own}} species, either {{stealing}} prey from nests of <b>other</b> <b>females</b> to provision their own nests, or in brood parasitism, removing the <b>other</b> <b>female's</b> egg and laying {{one of her}} own instead. Brood parasitism [...] "appears to be a cheap and easy route to producing offspring", as it takes only about 30 minutes to switch eggs in an existing nest, but about 10 hours to build and provision a new nest; however, more than 80% of brood-parasitized nests were themselves parasitized by another female.|$|R
50|$|Strictly an {{arboreal}} species, P. standingi {{lives in}} pairs on trees, {{spending a lot}} of time basking in the sun on the highest and well exposed branches. The males are very territorial and will fight when in the presence of <b>other</b> males; <b>females</b> have this character towards <b>other</b> <b>females,</b> a behavior which is rather rare in geckos.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} select the best quality males and {{maximize}} their offspring survival rate, females will pool their eggs with <b>other</b> <b>females</b> into a single male’s territory and create a larger brood. Studies have shown that pooling to create larger broods serves to not only decrease predatory effects, but also increases paternal investment. By increasing brood size, predation rate per individual decreases {{as a result of}} dilution effects. Also, males with larger broods are less likely to cannibalize their broods. It has also been hypothesized that egg pooling is a simple imitation tactic by which females confirm the quality of the male. By copying the spawning behavior of <b>other</b> <b>females,</b> females can minimize the search costs of finding a good mate.|$|R
5|$|In May 1932, Kalep {{traveled}} from France to New York on the steamship SS Paris {{with the intention}} of flying back to Europe across the Atlantic Ocean; at the time, no woman had made a solo transatlantic flight. She befriended American aviation pioneer Amelia Earhart, who, unbeknownst to Kalep, was planning a similar feat. After Earhart's successful flight from Canada to Ireland on 20 May, Kalep decided {{that it would not be}} worthwhile to make her own attempt at flying across the Atlantic, since she would no longer be the first woman to do so. She continued to encourage other women to enter the field of aviation, however, and became a member of the Ninety-Nines, an international organisation for women pilots which was founded by Earhart and 98 <b>other</b> <b>female</b> aviators. In August 1932, Kalep planned to fly with Roger Q. Williams from Los Angeles to Athens to celebrate the former city's hosting of the 1932 Summer Olympics, but their flight was canceled. Soon after, it was reported that Kalep had remarried to W. E. Hutton-Miller, an American stockbroker.|$|E

Later she meets other people in leather and masks, before being {{surrounded}} by a troop of lace-clad dancers. One shot shows a man in colourful clothes and leopard print Speedos surrounded by bubbles in a bathtub. Another room contains a family of four mannequins in a 1960s-styled kitchen, preparing for a plastic-looking meal. A bare African-American is seen dancing and painting herself with a large brush while being almost naked. She is also seen with her legs spread around a TV screen and Beyoncé is seen on it, singing the song. During one scene, Beyoncé performs a dance choreography on a couch along with several <b>other</b> <b>female</b> dancers. Throughout the video, she is seen wearing a tuxedo with a tie, a white fur jacket and platform heels designed by Saint Laurent. The black-and-white jumpsuit she wears is designed by Russian designer Ulyana Sergeenko. Her look is further complete with dark make-up around the eyes and red lipstick while her hair is marcelled and blonde.|$|E
5|$|One of Wollstonecraft's central {{arguments}} in the Rights of Woman is that women should be educated in a rational manner {{to give them the}} opportunity to contribute to society. In the 18th century, it was often assumed by both educational philosophers and conduct book writers, who wrote what one might think of as early self-help books, that women were incapable of rational or abstract thought. Women, it was believed, were too susceptible to sensibility and too fragile to be able to think clearly. Wollstonecraft, along with <b>other</b> <b>female</b> reformers such as Catharine Macaulay and Hester Chapone, maintained that women were indeed capable of rational thought and deserved to be educated. She argued this point in her own conduct book, Thoughts on the Education of Daughters (1787), in her children's book, Original Stories from Real Life (1788), {{as well as in the}} Rights of Woman.|$|E
