25|$|NET binds to the ERs, the ERα and the ERβ, with 0.07% and 0.01% of the {{relative}} binding affinity of estradiol. Due to these very low relative affinities, it is essentially inactive itself as a ligand of the ERs at clinical concentrations. However, NET {{has been found to}} be a substrate for aromatase and is converted in the liver to a small extent (0.35%) to the highly potent estrogen EE, and for this reason, unlike most other progestins, NET has some estrogenic activity. However, with typical dosages of NET used in oral contraceptives (0.5 to 1mg), the levels <b>of</b> <b>EE</b> produced are low, and it has been said that they are probably without clinical relevance. Conversely, doses of 5 and 10mg of NET, which are used in the treatment of gynecological disorders, are converted at rates of 0.7% and 1.0% and produce levels <b>of</b> <b>EE</b> that correspond to those produced by 30 and 60μg dosages <b>of</b> <b>EE,</b> respectively. The levels <b>of</b> <b>EE</b> formed by 0.5 and 1mg of NET have been calculated and estimated based on higher dosages as corresponding to 2 and 10μg dosages <b>of</b> <b>EE,</b> respectively.|$|E

Active EEs are bound to histone proteins, and these his-tone-bound EEs carry actively transcribing genes such as c-myc.

25|$|NET is weakly estrogenic (via {{conversion}} {{into its}} metabolite EE), {{and for this}} reason, {{it has been found}} at high dosages to be associated with high rates of estrogenic side effects such as breast enlargement in women and gynecomastia in men, but also with improvement of menopausal symptoms in postmenopausal women. It has been suggested that very high dosages (e.g., 40mg/day, which are sometimes used in clinical practice for various indications) of NETA (and by extension NET) may result in an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) analogously to high dosages (above 50μg/day) <b>of</b> <b>EE,</b> and that even dosages of NETA of 10 to 20mg, which correspond to EE dosages of approximately 20 to 30μg/day, may in certain women be associated with increased risk.|$|E

However, high quality needs to be ensured {{in order to achieve}} validated results and help making informed decisions. Thus, the objective {{of the present study was}} to systematically identify and review published pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma-related EEs and to assess their quality. Methods: Systematic literature research was conducted in PubMed and Cochrane to identify published EEs between 2000 and 2015. The quality <b>of</b> each selected <b>EE</b> was assessed by two independent reviewers, using the Drummond's checklist. Results: Our systematic review was based on 32 EEs and showed a wide variety of methodo-logical approaches, including different perspectives, time horizon, and cost effectiveness analyses. Nearly two-thirds <b>of</b> <b>EEs</b> are full EEs (n Z 21), and about one-third <b>of</b> <b>EEs</b> had a Drummond score 7, synonymous with 'high quality'. Close to 50 % <b>of</b> full <b>EEs</b> had a Drum-mond score 7, whereas all <b>of</b> partial <b>EEs</b> had a Drummond score < 7 (n Z 11). Conclusions: Over the past 15 years, a lot of interest has been evinced over the <b>EE</b> <b>of</b> pancre-atic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and its direct impact on therapeutic advances in PDAC. To provide a framework for health care decision-making, to facilitate transferability and to lend credibility to health EEs, their quality must be improved. For the last 4 years, a tendency towards a quality improvement of these studies has been observed, probably coupled with a context of rational decision-making in health care, a better and wider spread of recommendations and thus, medical practitioners' full endorsement. ...|$|R

In this report, we have elucidated the size, structure, functional components of c-Myc-induced extrachromosomal elements (EEs). Scanning electron microscopy revealed that EEs isolated from MycER-activated Pre-B+ cells are {{an average of}} 10 times larger than EEs isolated from non-MycER-activated control Pre-B- cells.

Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analyses using pan -histone-specific, histone H 3 phosphorylation-specific, histone H 4 acetylation-specific antibodies indicate that a significant proportion <b>of</b> <b>EEs</b> analyzed from MycER-activated cells harbors transcriptionally competent and/or active chromatin.

The present {{study was conducted to}} assess the role of regular inspections on food safety in hospital premises. Methodology: This was an intervention based before and after study. A tool was prepared based on the Food Safety and Standards Regulations (FSSR) (in India) 2011. This included major, critical, and highly critical domains. Each item in the tool scored between 1 and 3 (poor, satisfactory, and good). Based on this, each eating establishment (EE) was given a score on conformance to FSSR 2011. Monthly inspection was made over a year and corrective actions were suggested. Results: The minimum preintervention score was (41. 28 %), and maximum was (77. 25 %). There was no significant association between type of meal services and score EE (P > 0. 05). Higher proportion <b>of</b> <b>EEs</b> within the hospital building had a satisfactory and good score as compared to EEs outside the hospital building but within hospital premises (P < 0. 05).
