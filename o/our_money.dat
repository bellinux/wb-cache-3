500|$|Kennedy {{began the}} season playing right wing. Then, in mid-December, Leaf centre Mel Hill {{fractured}} his ankle. This gave Kennedy his {{first opportunity to}} play regularly at the centre position, where he remained {{for most of his}} career. In a January 8 game at Maple Leaf Gardens against the Boston Bruins, the mayor of Port Colborne presented Kennedy and Don Gallinger with gold watches on behalf of his town's citizens. Kennedy finished the season as the team's second best goal-scorer with 26 and was fourth in points. He was just 18 years old. In the playoffs, Toronto faced the powerful Montreal Canadiens. Although Toronto won the first game 3–1, they were then swept in the next four and eliminated from the playoffs. The Toronto Daily Star said of Kennedy's rookie season, [...] "For <b>our</b> <b>money</b> the best rookie of the year though playing with one of the weakest lines in N.H.L. history." [...] Kennedy was ineligible for the rookie-of-the-year award because of the two games he played with the Leafs {{at the end of the}} 1942–43 season.|$|E

500|$|McCartney {{explained}} that the Beatles had only experienced sex with girls from Liverpool, but {{when they got to}} Hamburg the only women who hung around the clubs late at night were strippers, dancers, or prostitutes. Harrison (who was then only 17) called Hamburg [...] "the naughtiest city in the world". McCartney said: [...] "By the time you got to Hamburg, a girlfriend there was likely to be a stripper, so to be suddenly involved with a hard-core striptease artist, who obviously knew {{a thing or two about}} sex... it was quite an eye-opener." [...] Gerry Marsden—frontman for Gerry & the Pacemakers—remembered visiting a Hamburg brothel in Herbertstrasse with Lennon: [...] "We paid <b>our</b> <b>money,</b> went in and sat down. This guy came out with the biggest lady we had ever seen in our lives. She looked like a bus with a bra on. We ran out that door so quick we didn't hear it shut.

500|$|Art {{historian}} Cornelius Vermeule {{criticized the}} Louisiana Purchase Exposition dollar and the Lewis and Clark Exposition dollar issued in 1904–1905: [...] "the lack of spark in these coins, as {{in so many}} designs by Barber or [...] Morgan, {{stems from the fact}} that the faces, hair, and drapery are flat and the lettering is small, crowded, and even." [...] He did not believe that the problems he saw were due to the small size of the dollar, stating that the gold dollar of the Panama-Pacific issue, by Charles Keck, is far more beautiful. Vermeule noted that contemporary accounts saw the 1903 issue as an innovation; a 1904 article in the American Journal of Numismatics stated that they [...] "indicate a popular desire for a new departure from the somewhat monotonous types of Liberty which have characterized <b>our</b> <b>money...</b> If this tendency could make itself felt on the regular coinage, it would give a new zeal to collectors." [...] Beginning in 1909 with the Lincoln cent, the Mint would depict an actual person on the circulating coinage; this would become more common with the 1932 Washington quarter.|$|E

Because they were financing the project themselves, the developers could also ignore pressure from their publisher; their standard reply to when Duke Nukem Forever would ship was [...] "when it's done". In 2003, Take-Two CEO Jeffrey Lapin reported that the game would not be out that year. He further said the company was writing off $5.5million from its earnings due to Duke Nukem Forevers lengthy development time. Broussard shot back that [...] "Take-Two needs to ... We don’t want Take-Two saying stupid-ass things in public for the sole purposes of helping their stock. It's our time and <b>our</b> <b>money</b> we are spending on the game. So either we're absolutely stupid and clueless, or we believe in what we are working on." [...] Later that year, Lapin said 3D Realms had told him that Duke Nukem Forever was expected to be finished by the end of 2004, or the beginning of 2005.|$|E

2500|$|Taunton {{was founded}} by {{settlers}} from England and officially incorporated as a town on September 3, 1639. Most of the town's settlers were originally from Taunton in Somerset, England, which led early settlers to name the settlement after that town. At the time of Taunton's incorporation, they explained their choice of name as being, [...] "in honour and love to our dear native country... and owning it a great mercy of God to bring us to this place, and settling of us, on lands of our own bought with <b>our</b> <b>money</b> in peace, {{in the midst of}} the heathen, for a possession for ourselves and for our posterity after us."

It's an interesting time. It's our best educated guess on where we feel comfortable being." [...] Guitarist and backing vocalist Tom Linton stated: [...] " [...] we just toured, saved up all of <b>our</b> <b>money</b> and were able to save up enough money to record by ourselves, and then we shopped the record around.

2500|$|The album, {{also called}} Magician Among the Spirits, {{received}} mixed reviews, despite the guitar rock hook of its single, [...] "Comedown". It {{was released on}} the band's own Deep Karma label, but due to financial constraints they had to arrange for outside distribution for the North American and European markets. This almost doomed the album from the beginning, but worse events were to come. Within a short time, the U.S. distributor went bankrupt, leaving the band stripped of its earnings from North American sales. Although exact figures remain unknown due to disputes, up to A$250,000 worth of merchandise (some 25,000 discs) was lost. For a band already on shaky ground, this was nearly the death knell. Comments by Kilbey in May of that year summed up the situation: [...] "There's no immediate future for The Church.....Our management, {{the whole thing is}} broken down.....We don't really have a label. We're owed lots and lots of money and we're broke. We're trying to pursue lawyers to get <b>our</b> <b>money</b> back. Marty and I aren't having any communication.

2500|$|Benjamin Franklin {{told the}} House of Commons that, [...] "I know that {{whenever}} the subject [...] {{has occurred in}} conversation where I have been present, it has {{appeared to be the}} opinion of every one that we could not be taxed by a Parliament wherein we were not represented...An external tax is a duty laid on commodities imported; that duty is added to the first cost and other charges on the commodity, and, when it is offered for sale, makes a part of the price. If the people do not like it at that price, they refuse it; they are not obliged to pay it. But an internal tax is forced from the people without their consent if not laid by their own representatives. The Stamp Act says we shall have no commerce, make no exchange of property with each other, neither purchase nor grant, nor recover debts; we shall neither marry nor make our wills, unless we pay such and such sums; and thus it is intended to extort <b>our</b> <b>money</b> from us or ruin us by the consequence of refusing to pay it." [...] James Otis Jr. reasoned that the legal liberties of British subjects meant that Parliament should, or could, only tax the colonists if they were actually represented in Westminster.|$|E
