30|$|Tunneling field-effect {{transistor}} (TFET) {{has become a}} kind of potential electric device for the ultralow power consumption applications [1 – 3]. Because band-to-band tunneling (BTBT) is the main operation mechanism in TFETs, TFETs can break the limitation of 60  mV/dec subthreshold swing (SS) in the conventional CMOS {{field-effect transistor}} that relies on the hot electron emission [4 – 6]. In addition, TFETs are less influenced by short channel effects than MOSFETs. However, the low <b>on-state</b> <b>current</b> is an inherent disadvantage in the traditional TFETs. In order to improve the <b>on-state</b> <b>current</b> of TFETs, various novel device structures have been proposed such as L-shaped channel TFET (LTFET) [7, 8], U-shaped channel TFET (UTFET) [9], L-shaped gate TFET (LG-TFET) [10], heterojunction TFET (HTFET) [11, 12]. Among these structures, the LG-TFET is proved to be essential for the enhancement of <b>on-state</b> <b>current,</b> because its tunneling current mainly depends on the electron BTBT perpendicular to the channel instead of parallel to the channel, and gate-pocket overlap regions in the lateral direction increase the electric field at the top of tunneling junction, which is helpful for the improvement of <b>on-state</b> <b>current</b> [10, 13, 14]. But electron BTBT in LG-TFET occurs only {{on one side of the}} gate, which will limit further improvement of <b>on-state</b> <b>current.</b>|$|E

These effects decrease as ribbon widths increase and as edges become smoother. However the bandgap decreases with increasing width, thereby increasing the band-to-band tunneling mediated subthreshold leakage current even with perfect nanoribbons.
