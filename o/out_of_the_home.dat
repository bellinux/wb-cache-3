5|$|David Bell, the Home Office negotiator, kept contradicting himself, {{as if in}} a bid {{to prolong}} the negotiations. He would agree to our terms, then he would try and tell us it was out of his hands, and go back on his word. If it was <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Home</b> Officer's hands—then whose hands was it in? I think the final stages were messed around by the Home Office so that our protest could help to divert the public's {{attention}} from the Poll Tax revolt that was going on throughout the country. As Alan Lord was snatched after being asked to negotiate on behalf of us all, this made us all more defiant about ending the protest.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, unbearably {{inadequate}} {{housing and}} overcrowded neighborhoods pushed working men <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>home</b> and into saloons where they congregated for drink and discussion. Wealthy capitalists wishing {{to strike a}} balance between the demands of labor and desires of capital looked to Robert Owen's example. George Pullman and William Halliday implemented a policy of tolerance in their towns identical to that of Robert Owen. The peaceful atmosphere in Pullman and Hallidayboro can be attributed in part to the absence of alcohol.|$|E

5|$|Tera McArthur asked {{two police}} {{officers}} to accompany her to a trailer home where she lived with her husband Charles, {{so that she could}} take her belongings <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>home.</b> Just after she came out of the trailer, she told the police that Charles McArthur had drugs inside. The police knocked and asked Charles if they could search, which he refused. He then came out of the trailer; an officer prevented him from going back inside while the other policeman rushed to get a warrant. The Illinois Appellate Court held that this action violated the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures without a warrant. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to hear the case in 2000.|$|E

He suffered a blood clot in his left arm after a training injury which forced him to pull <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>home</b> match against Fulham on 6 February 2010; he spent the weekend in hospital. The treatment for the ailment meant that Cahill could not play {{for a number of}} months.

25|$|Paraguayan {{women had}} a {{significant}} role in the Paraguayan War. During the period just before the war began many Paraguayan women were the heads of their households, meaning they held a position of power and authority. They received such positions by being widows, having children out of wedlock, or their husbands worked as peons. When the war began women started to venture <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>home</b> becoming nurses, working with government, and establishing themselves into the public sphere. When the New York Times reported on the war in 1868 they considered Paraguayan women equal to their male counterparts.|$|E
25|$|Edgerton {{was born}} in Cazenovia, New York, on August 17, 1818. His parents were Amos and Zerviah (Graham) Edgerton, both of Connecticut. Zerviah was a cousin of millionaire philanthropist Anson Greene Phelps. As a child, Edgerton was so sickly and frail that burial clothes were {{prepared}} for him. Whereas the young Edgerton avoided death, the same could not be said for his father, a teacher by trade who had been blind for years. Amos Edgerton died when Sidney was still an infant. Left with six children to raise, Zerviah Edgerton struggled to maintain her family. By age eight, young Sidney was <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>home</b> and working himself through school. He eventually attended the Genesee Wesleyan Seminary in Lima, New York, where his cousin taught, and where he would later become an instructor as well.|$|E

In the penultimate match of the season, she hit an unbeaten 59 in a tied match against Queensland. Farrell ended the season with 172 runs at 34.40 from eight matches, an average superior to many specialist batsmen. Her bowling remained steady, never taking more than two wickets in a match. She ended the WNCL with nine wickets at 27.33 at an economy rate of 3.48. Western Australia won only two of their eight matches and did not make the final.

25|$|Hannah Hanson {{was born}} in 1805 in Lisbon, Maine. At seventeen, she met Ward Witham, and {{they were married in}} January 1822, in Portland, Maine. After {{the first few months of}} their marriage, Hanson was accused by two neighbors, Mr. and Mrs. Weymouth, of {{stealing}} their personal items. Witham defended his wife at the time, but later suspected her in the theft when he came to believe that she had been involved in an extra-marital affair. In October 1822, Hanson and Witham moved <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>home</b> they had shared with the Weymouth family. In July 1823, Kinney gave birth to her first child, a daughter. Witham came to suspect Kinney had been involved in an affair during the winter of 1824. In 1825, Hanson gave birth to her second child, a son. In the winter of 1825, Witham worked outside the home gathering lumber. He suspected his wife was involved in a second affair, this time with a young man. Rozilla Moody, a ward of the Witham family, signed an affidavit in 1826 saying she had witnessed another man in the Witham household during the previous winter.|$|E
25|$|The {{environment}} in Genie's new placement was extremely rigid {{and gave her}} far less access to her favorite objects and activities, and her caretakers rarely allowed her mother to visit. Soon after she moved in they began to subject her to extreme physical and emotional abuse, resulting in both incontinence and constipation resurfacing and causing her to revert to her coping mechanism of silence. The incident with the strongest impact occurred when they severely beat her for vomiting {{and told her that}} if she did it again they would never let her see her mother, making her terrified of opening her mouth for fear of vomiting and facing more punishment. As a result, she was extremely frightened of eating or speaking, and she became extremely withdrawn and almost exclusively relied on sign language for communication. During this time Curtiss was the only person who had worked with Genie to have regular contact with her, continuing to conduct weekly meetings to continue her testing, and she noted the extreme deterioration in Genie's condition. She quickly started petitioning to have Genie taken <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>home,</b> but Curtiss said that both she and social services had a difficult time contacting John Miner, only succeeding after several months. In late April 1977, with assistance from David Rigler, Miner removed her from this location.|$|E

25|$|Even though Sheila's {{body had}} been removed from the closet, the smell of {{decomposition}} still lingered in the apartment. Knorr became concerned that the smell and physical evidence in the closet could implicate her in Sheila's death. On September 29, 1986, Knorr moved the family's belongings <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>home</b> and ordered her youngest daughter Terry to burn down the apartment in an effort to destroy any physical evidence. During the night, Terry Knorr dumped three containers of lighter fluid on the apartment floor and set it on fire. The fire did little damage as neighbors quickly reported the fire before it spread. The closet in which Sheila died was not damaged. After Knorr's arrest, investigators were able to remove the subfloor from the closet to test it for physical evidence. After leaving the Sacramento apartment, Knorr went into hiding. Her surviving children, who were by then of legal age, severed their ties with their mother. Knorr's youngest child, 16-year-old Terry, also left her mother's care and used Sheila's identification card to pass herself off as a legal adult. The only child to remain with Knorr was Robert, Jr. who was then 19 years old. Knorr and Robert, Jr. moved to Las Vegas and attempted to keep a low profile. In November 1991, Robert Knorr, Jr. was arrested after he fatally shot a bartender in a Las Vegas bar during an attempted robbery. He was sentenced to 16 years in prison. Shortly after Robert, Jr.'s arrest, Knorr left Las Vegas and relocated to Salt Lake City.|$|E
