5|$|Payne {{drew up a}} {{compromise}} bill, in which the Resumption Act would be repealed and replaced with a gradual, partial return to gold-backed money. Under the Payne Act, national banks {{would be required to}} build up gold reserves equal to three percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> of greenbacks in circulation that year, adding an additional three percent each year until 1885, when they would have gold reserves of thirty percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> of circulating greenbacks. At that point, greenbacks would become redeemable in at least thirty percent gold. This compromise was still too much for the Eastern Democrats and Republicans who favored the gold standard, and the Banking Committee refused to approve the bill. Payne contrived to bypass his committee and bring the bill for a vote by the whole House, but it was voted down, 81 to 157. The House later passed a complete repeal of the Resumption Act, 133 to 120, but the Senate declined to take up the matter. Specie resumption remained {{the law of the land}} when the 44th Congress's term expired.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{properties}} of gravity at short distances should be somewhat independent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> of the cosmological constant, it is desirable to have {{a version of the}} AdS/CFT correspondence for positive cosmological constant.

This duality involves a model of spacetime called de Sitter space with a positive cosmological constant.

5|$|Boyer {{observes the}} {{distinction}} between how nonhuman animals can receive political protection {{as individuals and as}} species. He argues that the latter form of protection is motivated by a desire to preserve human experience of the species rather than the experiences of the nonhuman animals themselves. Politically motivated species advocacy, Boyer argues, is highly anthropocentric, as advocates present these animals as sharing in particular revered virtues; as a result, the likes of habitat and genetic health are the focus of advocates, rather than the nonhuman animals themselves. Using the example of polar bear preservation, Boyer illustrates how species advocacy becomes tied up with broader political goals concerning humans and competing visions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> of animals. He concludes that the advancement of species advocacy can limit the achievement of animal welfare/rights goals.|$|E
