Mrs. Conant silently poured the coffee, knowing any interference would annoy him. Irene, the niece, was a cripple and sat in her wheeled chair at the table, between her uncle and aunt. She was a pleasant-faced, happy little maid, consistently ignoring her withered limbs and thankful that from her knees up she was normal and that her wheeled chair rendered her fairly independent of assistance in all <b>ordinary</b> <b>activities.</b> Everyone loved Irene Macfarlane because of her brave and cheery acceptance of her misfortune, and her merry speech and spontaneous laughter rendered her, as [...] "Aunt Hannah" [...] often declared, [...] "the light of the house."

40|$|Introduction: Previous {{studies have}} shown that various factors such as {{emotional}} stress can trigger of MI in susceptible persons. More studies are needed to evaluate the characteristics of patients regarding to emotional stress, heavy work, routine activity, infection or rest before occurrence of MI. Methods: We studied 608 consecutive hospitalized in CCUs from May 2000 to October 2001. For patients, questionnaires including demographic, clinical and paraclinical characteristics were completed and data analyzed. Results: In this study rest (33. 4 %) and <b>ordinary</b> <b>activity</b> (32. 4 %) were more prevalent among the MI situations and infection had the lowest prevalence (0. 7 %). In patients higher than 45 years we had similar results, but in age group younger than 45 year <b>ordinary</b> <b>activity</b> (30. 6 %) and after heavy work (20. 8 %) had the highest prevalence before occurring of MI. In Diabetic patients, MI developed in sleep situation more frequently. (17. 8 %),(P= 0. 03) 52. 5 % of MI mortality occurred in rest situation. (P= 0. 009) Conclusion: Rest had the highest prevalence of MI compared to other situations but in age group younger than 45 years MI after heavy work had the highest prevalence.

30|$|In {{the present}} {{introductory}} experimental study, creativity {{has emerged as}} a rather <b>ordinary</b> <b>activity</b> of cooperative and non-cooperative agents, whose main ability is to operate intentional associations on knowledge bases. More broadly, this preliminary study on the primitives of spatial environments seems to suggest that organizational models based on their ontological conceptualization can serve as structural layout enabling knowledge associations and supporting spatial-based decisionmaking. In this sense, it seems to confirm some basic assumptions of our work, that need to be further developed and investigated in subsequent research.|$|R
