5|$|Although the ZX Microdrive was {{initially}} greeted with good reviews, it never took <b>off</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> distribution method due to {{worries about the}} quality of the cartridges and piracy.

No games are known to be exclusively released on Microdrive.|$|E

5|$|Described by German {{zoologist}} Friedrich Boie in 1826, {{the genus}} Phylloscopus contains about 50 species of small insectivorous Old World woodland warblers which are either greenish or brown above and yellowish, white or buff below. The genus was formerly {{part of the}} Old World warbler family Sylvidae, but has now been split <b>off</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> separate family Phylloscopidae. The chiffchaff's closest relatives, other than former subspecies, are a group of leaf warblers which similarly lack crown stripes, a yellow rump or obvious wing bars; they include the willow, Bonelli's, wood and plain leaf warblers.|$|E

5|$|Plutonium is a {{transuranic}} radioactive {{chemical element}} with symbol Pu and atomic number 94. It is an actinide metal of silvery-gray appearance that tarnishes {{when exposed to}} air, and forms a dull coating when oxidized. The element normally exhibits six allotropes and four oxidation states. It reacts with carbon, halogens, nitrogen, silicon and hydrogen. When exposed to moist air, it forms oxides and hydrides that can expand the sample up to 70% in volume, which in turn flake <b>off</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> powder that is pyrophoric. It is radioactive and can accumulate in bones, which makes the handling of plutonium dangerous.|$|E
5|$|Seeking {{national}} reconciliation between revolutionaries and Catholics, the Concordat of 1801 was signed on 15 July 1801 between Napoleon and Pope Pius VII. It solidified the Roman Catholic Church {{as the majority}} church of France and brought back most of its civil status. The hostility of devout Catholics against the state had now largely been resolved. It did not restore the vast church lands and endowments that had been seized during the revolution and sold <b>off.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> part of the Concordat, he presented another set of laws called the Organic Articles.|$|E

5|$|Starting in 1897, Clark {{attempted}} to secure protection for his holdings from the British South Africa Company. The Company took little notice of him. A local chief, Chintanda, {{complained to the}} Company in 1899 that Clark had secured his concessions while passing himself <b>off</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Company official and had been collecting hut tax {{for at least two}} years under this pretence. The Company resolved to remove him from power, and did so in 1902. Clark then farmed for about two decades, with some success, and moved in the late 1910s to Broken Hill. There he became a prominent local figure, and a partner in the first licensed brewery in Northern Rhodesia. Remaining in Broken Hill for the rest of his life, he died there in 1927.|$|E
5|$|The {{company began}} as a {{development}} team that created software called Picture This Home in the mid-1990s for Autodesk in San Rafael, California. The program allowed people to virtually preview room decoration projects before any work began. Users could create virtual rooms, change walls and arrange furniture, and create photo-realistic renderings of completed designs. Picture This Home was awarded the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval. In 1998, the software and its team of 40developers were sold to Broderbund, which was owned by The Learning Company, a subsidiary of Mattel Inc. Broderbund eventually spun Picture This Home <b>off</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> company called GoodHome.com in June 1999.

5|$|A {{designer}} named Tateaki Koshiki steps forward, {{claiming he}} developed the Solid State system before committing suicide. Kusanagi dives into his cyberbrain and into Koshiki's trap, allowing him to hack her cyberbrain. The Puppeteer reveals that he was spread across several egos until a collective consciousness emerged and developed into a Solid State, allowing him {{to move into the}} society beyond as the vanishing mediator. Later, Batou tells a recovering Kusanagi that the real Tateaki Koshiki used a cybernetic body and built the Solid State after he was hired by Munei. Kusanagi does not reveal that the Puppeteer was a fragment of herself, but Batou already knew from being linked to her during the dive.
