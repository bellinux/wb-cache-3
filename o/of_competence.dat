40|$|Two {{studies were}} run {{to explore the}} {{relations}} between a conflict <b>of</b> <b>competences</b> (i. e., {{a situation in which}} two competent individuals present divergent solutions to the same task), counterfactual thinking, and performance. The first study shows that individuals who imagine themselves in a situation involving a conflict <b>of</b> <b>competences</b> generate more intensive subtractive than additive counterfactual thoughts. The second study tested the impact of a conflict <b>of</b> <b>competences</b> on performance in an anagram task. A condition involving a mere conflict <b>of</b> <b>competences</b> was compared to one involving a conflict <b>of</b> <b>competences</b> with additive counterfactuals (known to improve performance) and one involving a conflict <b>of</b> <b>competences</b> with subtractive counterfactuals (known to have no such effect on performance).

5|$|Transformation, unlike {{transduction}} or conjugation, {{depends on}} numerous bacterial gene products that specifically interact to perform this complex process. In {{order for a}} bacterium to bind, take up and recombine donor DNA into its own chromosome, it must first enter a special physiological state termed competence (see Natural competence). In Bacillus subtilis, about 40 genes are required for the development <b>of</b> <b>competence.</b> The length of DNA transferred during B. subtilis transformation can be between {{a third of a}} chromosome up to the whole chromosome. Transformation appears to be common among bacterial species, and thus far at least 60 species are known to have the natural ability to become competent for transformation. The development <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> in nature is usually associated with stressful environmental conditions, and seems to be an adaptation for facilitating repair of DNA damage in recipient cells.|$|E

40|$|It is {{the aim of}} {{this paper}} to {{investigate}} the complex system of the distribution <b>of</b> <b>competences</b> in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In order to do this, we will proceed as follows: First, we will focus on the “twin union state” (Graf Vitzhum 2000) that Dayton created, and provide an overview of the basics of the political system. Second, we will look at the current distribution <b>of</b> <b>competences,</b> their implementation and their actual application. By doing so, we will not only focus on the distribution <b>of</b> <b>competences</b> between different levels of government, but we will also focus on the concrete implementation of the distribution <b>of</b> <b>competences</b> in selected policy areas. Third, we will look at how the distribution <b>of</b> <b>competences</b> has been interpreted and how checks and balances function in the political system. In part four, we will analyze how the distribution <b>of</b> <b>competences</b> has evolved over time in post-war Bosnia. The focus will be on the changing dynamics between central state, entities, cantons and municipalities. We will assess how the distribution <b>of</b> <b>competences</b> can be changed and which mechanisms are used to ensure that far-reaching changes to the distribution <b>of</b> <b>competences</b> follow a clear legal process. Finally, we will conclude by looking at the most recent developments in Bosnia and Herzegovina, pointing out where reforms are required and focusing on an important judgement of the European Court for Human Rights in relation to Bosnia’s political system...|$|R

5|$|The {{capture of}} Detroit and Hull's army wounded American morale, and {{eliminated}} the main American {{force in the}} area as a threat, {{while at the same}} time boosting morale among his own forces. Brock took the American supplies at Detroit and used them for his own forces, particularly the ill-equipped militia. Under prize regulations, a substantial part of the value of the captured military stores would accrue to him. (If he had lived longer, he could have settled his debts.) Brock valued the captured ordnance supplies at £30,000. Finally, the victory secured the support of Tecumseh and the other chiefs in his confederation, who took Brock's actions as both a sign <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> and a willingness to take action.|$|E
5|$|At NSGL, {{the enlisted}} African Americans who {{tested in the}} top 30 to 40 percent were {{selected}} for non-labor battalion assignments. Port Chicago was manned by workers drawn from those remaining. The Navy determined {{that the quality of}} African American petty officers at Port Chicago suffered because of the absence of high-scoring black men, and that overall levels <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> were further reduced by the occasional requirement for Port Chicago to supply drafts of men with clear records for transfer to other stations. The Navy's General Classification Test (GCT) results for the enlisted men at Port Chicago averaged 31, putting them in the lowest twelfth of the Navy. Officers at Port Chicago considered the enlisted men unreliable, emotional, and lacking the capacity to understand or remember orders or instructions.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the heavy}} Polish casualties—or {{according}} to one historian, possibly because of them—the battle has been largely neglected in Polish historiography. During {{the period of the}} People's Republic of Poland it was portrayed merely as a difficult but victorious battle. However, since the fall of communism modern Polish historians have been much more critical of Świerczewski's command, blaming his drive on Dresden for the near destruction of the Polish force. Świerczewski's lack <b>of</b> <b>competence,</b> according to some sources, included commanding the battle while drunk. He was briefly relieved of command by Marshal Konev, but due to the backing of the Soviet high command (most likely the NKVD) he not only retained his position but all controversies were hushed up, and after the war was hailed as a hero. The actions of other Polish officers have also been questioned, such as the 9th Infantry Division commander's decision to advance without sufficient reconnaissance and escort.|$|E

5|$|The academy {{was formed}} as a not-for-profit company in 1999 and officially opened on 1 April 2000. It {{occupied}} converted naval premises until a clubhouse was built, which was opened in June 2005 by the Princess Royal. £7.85 million of funding for the project was donated by charities, individuals and local councils; the National Lottery donated £3 million in 2003, and the South West Regional Development Agency added £3.34 million. The academy's aims are to promote the sport of sailing at all levels <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> and ability, through courses, training and events, and {{to contribute to the}} economic regeneration of the area. Since opening it has created a demand in service and marine industries worth around £10 million. WPNSA continues to promote sailing to local schools, offering benefits such as free boat hoist and storage. Use of the facilities and access to training is open to anyone in return for an annual membership fee. On 6 July 2005, London was chosen to host the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, and the WPNSA was chosen to host the sailing events.|$|E
5|$|The war also {{provided}} opportunities for advancement onto the General Staff, {{especially in the}} early days, when many former senior officers were recalled from retirement. Some of these were found wanting, due to their advanced age, their unwillingness to serve, or a lack <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> and fitness; most were sent back into retirement before {{the first year of}} the war was over, leaving a gap that had to be filled by lower-ranking officers. Criticism of the quality of staff work in the Crimean War and the Second Boer War had led to sweeping changes under Haldane. The Staff College, Camberley was greatly expanded and Lord Kitchener established another staff college at Quetta for Indian Army officers in 1904. Nonetheless, when war broke out in August 1914, there were barely enough graduates to staff the BEF. Four-month-long staff courses were introduced, and filled with regimental officers who, upon completing their training, were posted to various headquarters. As a result, staff work was again poor, until training and experience slowly remedied the situation. In 1918, staff officers who had been trained exclusively for static trench warfare were forced to adapt to the demands of semi-open warfare.|$|E
