5|$|AML {{has several}} subtypes; {{treatment}} and prognosis vary among subtypes. AML is cured in 35–40% of people under 60 {{years old and}} 5–15% over 60 years old. <b>Older</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> {{are not able to}} withstand intensive chemotherapy have an average survival of 5–10 months.|$|E
5|$|In a {{study of}} a {{district}} general hospital in the UK, 5.4% of all the hospital's self-harm cases were aged over 65. The male to female ratio was 2:3 although the self-harm rates {{for males and females}} over 65 in the local population were identical. Over 90% had depressive conditions, and 63% had significant physical illness. Under 10% of the patients gave a history of earlier self-harm, while both the repetition and suicide rates were very low, which could be explained by the absence of factors known to be associated with repetition, such as personality disorder and alcohol abuse. However, NICE Guidance on Self-harm in the UK suggests that <b>older</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> self-harm are at a greater risk of completing suicide, with 1 in 5 <b>older</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> self-harm going on to end their life. A study completed in Ireland showed that older Irish adults have high rates of deliberate self-harm, but comparatively low rates of suicide.|$|E
5|$|In 2013 about 3.3 {{million cases}} of self-harm occurred. Self-harm is most common {{between the ages}} of 12 and 24. Self-harm in {{childhood}} is relatively rare but the rate has been increasing since the 1980s. However, self-harm behaviour can occur at any age, including in the elderly population. The risk of serious injury and suicide is higher in <b>older</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> self-harm. Self-harm is not limited to humans. Captive animals, such as birds and monkeys, are also known to participate in self-harming behaviour.|$|E

He used Walter the Chancellor and other now-lost works for the history of the Principality of Antioch. From the end of Fulcher's chronicle in 1127, William is the only source of information from an author living in Jerusalem.

5|$|Tourism {{supported}} by fishing is {{the mainstay of}} Whitby's economy in an isolated community with poor transport infrastructure and restricted by building constraints in the surrounding North York Moors National Park. The economy is governed by the changing fortunes of fishing, tourism and to some extent, manufacturing. Structural changes have led to concentrations of deprivation, unemployment and benefit dependence. A narrowing employment base and dependence on low wage and low skill sectors has resulted in younger age groups leaving the area. There are few business start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises. <b>Older</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> make increasing demands on the area's health and social care capacity have moved into the area. Demographic changes, Whitby's relative isolation from the region's main growth areas and decline in traditional employment sectors pose an economic challenge.|$|E

25|$|Language (and {{especially}} spoken language) is {{not necessarily}} linked with national identification. Family ties and informal local contact across the border used to be very common, with South Jutlandic being the first language of both Danish minded and German minded people. Sometimes the purest South Jutlandic may be found among <b>older</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> identify as German. Since they have not attended Danish schools, their speech is not influenced by Standard Danish. With urbanisation in the recent decades this crisscross of dialects and national sentiment has faded, High German becoming the first choice everywhere, but often some South Jutlandic words are retained in the vocabulary.|$|E
25|$|In Portugal, given {{names have}} a {{standard}} spelling {{that is considered}} the norm (even for non-contemporary figures) and the rules are enforced by law. The 'Instituto dos Registos e do Notariado', {{under the jurisdiction of}} the Portuguese Republic, has rules about given names. There is a defined list of allowed names; misspelt and archaic forms (e.g., Luiz is the archaic form of Luís; Felipe is a misspelling of Filipe), and names containing foreign letters – k, y, w – are usually not allowed. However, <b>older</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> were registered with archaic forms have continued to use them (examples include Manoel de Oliveira – the modern spelling would be Manuel). Regarding surnames, there are no legal restrictions, and as such many people continue to use archaic spellings of family names, as in Athayde (modern form Ataíde), Telles (modern form Teles).|$|E

500|$|Quatermass {{met with}} a {{generally}} unenthusiastic critical response. Sean Day-Lewis wrote, [...] "Although Piers Haggard's direction achieves much verisimilitude and the story is certainly enough to command some addiction; I did not feel exactly grabbed; the genre has moved some way since the 1950s and the Professor moves a little slowly for the 1970s". The reviewer in The Daily Telegraph found Professor Quatermass [...] "far too unheroic and unresourceful to carry much interest" [...] while The Times found the serial to be [...] "a so-so affair". More positive was the Daily Mail who thought the serial was [...] "not the best of Nigel Kneale but it equalled any of his earliest Quatermass stories". John Brosnan, writing in Starburst magazine, found the serial to be [...] "a bitter reaction {{by a member of}} an older generation to the younger generation whose apparently irrational behaviour makes them appear to belong to a totally different species. Naturally in the traditions of sf, these failings are exaggerated to the nth degree. Thus muggers and juvenile delinquents become armed gangs and the hippy movement with its emphasis on mysticism, becomes the Planet Church. It's very much a story of Age versus Youth and significantly it's the <b>older</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> are impervious to the malign alien influence". This view is echoed by filmmaker John Carpenter who said, [...] "Nigel was very embittered about the way of the world, as was shown, I think, in The Quatermass Conclusion".|$|E

2500|$|... 10–12% of {{the human}} brain is {{composed}} of lipids, including the omega-3 fat DHA. Recent studies suggest that older people can boost their brain power by eating more oily fish, what with regular consumers being able to remember better and think faster than those who don't consume at all. Other research has also suggested that adding more DHA to the diet of children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder can reduce their behavioural problems and improve their reading skills, while there have also been links suggested between DHA and better concentration. Separate studies have suggested that <b>older</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> eat fish {{at least once a week}} could also have a lower chance of developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease.|$|E
2500|$|As {{part of the}} Delivering Quality First {{proposals}} {{submitted by}} the BBC in October 2011 {{and approved by the}} BBC Trust in May 2012, all children's programming on BBC One and Two would be moved permanently to the CBBC and CBeebies channels following the digital switchover. It was found that the majority of child viewers watched the programmes on these channels already and that only 7% of these children watched CBBC programmes on BBC One and Two only, it was made clear [...] "Children's programmes are absolutely fundamental to the BBC and that is why we have protected investment in them in the light of cuts elsewhere." [...] Children's programming on BBC One ended on 21 December 2012. The move was criticised by Teletubbies co-creator Anne Wood, who described the changes as [...] "ghettoising children's programmes" [...] and believe it was merely a cost-cutting measure. Wood said [...] "On the one hand it is inevitable. But it is dismissive of children. There {{is a certain amount of}} overlooking of the fact that children's programmes do get a wider audience than people are aware of... I have frequently had letters from <b>older</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> have enjoyed my programmes as much as children do. A lot of the reason older people like to watch children's programming is because it is life-enhancing." [...] Head of BBC Children's, Joe Godwin said: [...] "Our young viewers are our priority and the vast majority of children in the UK already tune in to CBeebies and CBBC to find their favourite BBC children's programmes. Far from being a 'cynical' move, we're just following where our audience has already gone." ...|$|E
