5|$|A third {{milestone}} in Wodehouse's life came {{towards the end}} of 1915: his old songwriting partner Jerome Kern introduced him to the writer Guy Bolton, who became Wodehouse's closest friend and a regular collaborator. Bolton and Kern had a musical, Very Good Eddie, running at the Princess Theatre in New York. The show was successful, but they thought the song lyrics weak and invited Wodehouse to join them on its successor. This was Miss Springtime (1916), which ran for 227 performances—a good run {{by the standards of the}} day. The team produced several more successes, including Leave It to Jane (1917), <b>Oh,</b> <b>Boy!</b> (1917–18) and Oh, Lady! Lady!! (1918), and Wodehouse and Bolton wrote a few more shows with other composers. In these musicals Wodehouse's lyrics won high praise from critics as well as fellow lyricists such as Ira Gershwin.|$|E

In 1981, he was chosen for the Jordache Jeans campaign which funded his way to London, where he was selected for the cover of teen magazine <b>Oh</b> <b>Boy,</b> which would be his first. After one year of modeling, Bloch returned to the US and worked at Studio 54.|$|E

25|$|Back at the Gaiety Theatre, Grossmith wrote, {{produced}} {{and starred in}} the hit in Theodore & Co (1916), based on a French comedy. Edwardes had died in 1915, however, and Grossmith was dissatisfied with the offer of the new management under Alfred Butt and Robert Evett, the executor of Edwardes's estate, and so he left the Gaiety and produced three successes, Mr Manhattan, Arlette (1917), and Yes, Uncle! (1917) elsewhere. His Oh! Joy (the British adaptation of <b>Oh,</b> <b>Boy!,</b> 1917) was also successful. He also wrote the tremendously successful revue series, The Bing Boys Are Here (1916), The Bing Boys are There (1917) and The Bing Boys on Broadway (1918). Grossmith fitted his work on all these productions around his naval service in World War I.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 1930s, Lawson had {{established}} {{herself on the}} stage as a musical comedy star, able to earn fifty to sixty British pounds a week, and in 1933 she entered into the British film industry. Though she eventually acted {{in more than a}} dozen films, her screen career never matched her stage success. Her first major role was as Susie in Colonel Blood, which starred Frank Cellier. The most successful film that Lawson had a role in was the 1935 production of Scrooge, which starred Seymour Hicks and Donald Calthrop. She also appeared in films that included in their cast such notable actors as Stanley Holloway in D'Ye Ken John Peel? and Cotton Queen, Will Fyffe in Cotton Queen, and Vivien Leigh in Things Are Looking Up, and Bud Flanagan in A Fire Has Been Arranged. Lawson's last film was <b>Oh</b> <b>Boy!</b> in 1938.|$|E

500|$|Many other {{scenes in}} Homicide were filmed {{primarily}} in the Fells Point neighorhood, including actual streets, bars and houses to create authenticity. Scenes at the Homicide morgue were filmed inside Baltimore's actual Office of the Medical Examiner, which the actors hated performing in due to the unsettling atmosphere; Ned Beatty said of filming there, [...] "The one thing you can't get on camera is, <b>oh</b> <b>boy,</b> it smells." [...] Homicide footage was transferred from film to videotape for editing at the Maryland studio Colorlab Motion Picture Services. There, Levinson and Ewing worked with colorist Drexel Williams to drain the footage of color value, leaving a gritty visual style almost reminiscent of black-and-white. This technique was downplayed starting in the second season, giving the show a more colorful look.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} filmed {{over the course}} of seven days in Baltimore. The scene in which Pembleton and Felton try to find the correct police car in a large garage was filmed in a rundown early 20th-century ballroom. The scene {{features}} dozens of white unmarked Cavaliers. Shortly before [...] "Gone for Goode" [...] was filmed, the Baltimore Police Department stopped using Cavaliers as their regular brand of police car, and agreed to sell their collection of leftover Cavaliers to the Homicide show for $1. Although the cars were used as props in the episode, only two of the cars were actually drivable. The scenes set in the medical examiner's office were filmed in the actual Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Baltimore. The actors, particularly Jon Polito, hated performing in the morgue because they found the atmosphere unsettling. Ned Beatty said of filming there, [...] "The one thing you can't get on camera is, <b>oh</b> <b>boy,</b> it smells." [...] The identification pictures of suspects that Munch looks through were all pictures of photos of members of the Homicide crew. One of the final scenes in the episode, featuring Polito, Johnson and Belzer speaking in an alley at night, was conceived, written and shot in one night simply because it was raining outside, and the Homicide crew wanted {{to take advantage of the}} location during a rainy night.|$|E
500|$|The band {{recorded}} {{their debut}} album, Unknown Pleasures in April 1979 at Strawberry Studios, Stockport. Producer Martin Hannett significantly altered their live sound, {{a fact that}} greatly displeased the band at the time. Hook said in 2006 that the album [...] "definitely didn't turn out sounding the way I wanted it But now I can see that Martin {{did a good job}} on it There's no two ways about it, Martin Hannett created the Joy Division sound". The album cover was designed by Peter Saville, who would go on to provide artwork for future Joy Division releases. Unknown Pleasures was released in June and sold through its initial pressing of 10,000 copies. Tony Wilson said that the relative success of the album turned the indie label into a true business and a [...] "revolutionary force" [...] that operated outside of the major record label system. Reviewing the album for Melody Maker, writer Jon Savage described the album as an [...] "opaque manifesto" [...] and declared [...] "eaving the twentieth century is difficult; most people prefer to go back and nostalgise. <b>Oh</b> <b>boy.</b> Joy Division at least set a course in the present with contrails for the future—perhaps you can't ask for much more. Indeed, Unknown Pleasures may very well be one of the best, white, English, debut LPs of the year".|$|E

500|$|Executive producers/writers David Benioff and D. B. Weiss had {{pitched the}} idea of {{adapting}} Martin's series for television to HBO in March 2006, and the network secured the rights in January 2007. The first actor cast was Peter Dinklage as Tyrion in May 2009. Benioff and Weiss later noted that the funny and [...] "incredibly smart" [...] Dinklage was their first choice for the role, as the actor's [...] "core of humanity, covered by a shell of sardonic dry wit, is pretty well {{in keeping with the}} character." [...] Unfamiliar with the source material, Dinklage was cautious in his first meeting with the producers; as a dwarf, [...] "he wouldn't play elves or leprechauns" [...] and – choosy about genre roles – he had just come from portraying the dwarf Trumpkin in 2008's [...] Benioff and Weiss told Dinklage that the character was [...] "a different kind of fantasy little person," [...] or in the actor's words, [...] "No beard, no pointy shoes, a romantic, real human being." [...] Dinklage signed on to play Tyrion before the meeting was half over, in part because [...] "They told me how popular he was." [...] Martin said of Dinklage's casting, [...] "If he hadn't accepted the part, <b>oh,</b> <b>boy,</b> I don't know what we would have done." [...] Benioff added, [...] "When I read George's books, I decided Tyrion Lannister {{was one of the great}} characters in literature. Not just fantasy literature – literature! A brilliant, caustic, horny, drunken, self-flagellating mess of a man. And there was only one choice to play him." ...|$|E
500|$|Since 2011, Dinklage {{has played}} Tyrion Lannister in HBO's fantasy drama Game of Thrones, an {{adaptation}} of author George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series. Game of Thrones takes place on the fictional continents of Westeros and Essos and chronicles the power struggles among noble families as they fight {{for control of the}} Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms. Tyrion is a member of House Lannister, one of the wealthiest and most powerful families in the fictional kingdom of Westeros, who uses his status as a Lannister to mitigate the impact of the marginalization and derision he has received all of his life. In May 2009, he was the first actor to be cast, as showrunners David Benioff and D. B. Weiss noted that Dinklage, whom he described as funny, smart and witty, was their first choice for the role, as the actor's [...] "core of humanity, covered by a shell of sardonic dry wit, is pretty well in keeping with the character".

[...] However, it did little to fulfill the new team's mission to innovate, except that Kern's song, [...] "The Magic Melody", was the first Broadway showtune with a basic jazz progression. [...] Kern and Bolton next created an original piece, Very Good Eddie, which was a surprise hit, running for 341 performances, with additional touring productions that went on into the 1918-19 season.
