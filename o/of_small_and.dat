5|$|From its {{founding}} in the 9th century until the Industrial Revolution, Oldham {{is believed to have}} been little more than a scattering <b>of</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> insignificant settlements spread across the moorland and dirt tracks that linked Manchester to York. Although not mentioned in the Domesday Book, Oldham does appear in legal documents from the Middle Ages, invariably recorded as territory under the control of minor ruling families and barons. In the 13th century, Oldham was documented as a manor held from the Crown by a family surnamed Oldham, whose seat was at Werneth Hall.|$|E

5|$|In {{earliest}} recorded history, Norway {{was divided}} into a number <b>of</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> sometimes warring petty kingdoms with weak central authority. In traditional historiography the rise of Harald Fairhair in the 9th century started the process of unification {{of the country and}} the consolidation of royal power. Harald's descendants, and other claimants to the throne, had to contend with strong regional leaders such as the Jarls of Lade in the north and the rulers of Vingulmark in the east, while the kings of Denmark claimed regions in the south and were eager to acquire Norwegian vassals to increase their influence. The spread of Christianity also became an increasingly important political issue in the late 10th century.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of the Basque Roads, {{also known}} as the Battle of Aix Roads (French: Bataille de l'île d'Aix, also Affaire des brûlots, rarely Bataille de la rade des Basques) was a major naval battle of the Napoleonic Wars, fought in the narrow Basque Roads {{at the mouth of the}} Charente River on the Biscay coast of France. The battle, which lasted from 11–25 April 1809, was unusual in that it pitted a hastily-assembled {{squadron}} <b>of</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> unorthodox British Royal Navy warships against the main strength of the French Atlantic Fleet, the circumstances dictated by the cramped, shallow coastal waters in which the battle was fought. The battle is also notorious for its controversial political aftermath in both Britain and France.|$|E

5|$|The common endemic Fiji goshawk is a {{specialist}} predator <b>of</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> medium-sized birds, and the swamp harrier {{is also a}} widespread predator, often taking fledglings. The local subspecies of the peregrine falcon, Falco peregrinus nesiotes will hunt finches, but is itself rare and declining. Barn owls eat mainly rats, but sometimes take small birds. Rats and mice use Fiji parrotfinch nests, and may be significant predators of the species, and the small Asian mongoose will prey on birds feeding on the ground. The fan-tailed cuckoo, which has an endemic Fijian subspecies, is a brood parasite, but the parrotfinch {{does not appear to}} be a host of this large cuckoo.|$|E

5|$|Alloys of zinc {{with small}} amounts of copper, aluminium, and {{magnesium}} are useful in die casting as well as spin casting, especially in the automotive, electrical, and hardware industries. These alloys are marketed under the name Zamak. An {{example of this is}} zinc aluminium. The low melting point together with the low viscosity of the alloy makes possible the production <b>of</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> intricate shapes. The low working temperature leads to rapid cooling of the cast products and fast production for assembly. Another alloy, marketed under the brand name Prestal, contains 78% zinc and 22% aluminium, and is reported to be nearly as strong as steel but as malleable as plastic. This superplasticity of the alloy allows it to be molded using die casts made of ceramics and cement.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} {{war broke out}} in Europe, the Australian armed forces were less {{prepared}} than at the outbreak of World WarI in August 1914. The Royal Australian Navy (RAN), the best-prepared of the three services, was small and equipped with only two heavy cruisers, four light cruisers, two sloops, five obsolete destroyers and a number <b>of</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> auxiliary warships. The Australian Army comprised a small permanent cadre of 3,000men and 80,000part-time militiamen who had volunteered for training with the Citizen Military Forces (CMF). The Royal Australian Air Force(RAAF), the weakest of the services, had 246aircraft, few of them modern. While the Commonwealth Government began a large military expansion and transferred some RAAF aircrew and units to British control upon the outbreak of war, it was unwilling to immediately dispatch an expeditionary force overseas due to {{the threat posed by}} Japanese intervention.|$|E

Mercer was detached from his Brigade and placed in charge of coordinating the mass <b>of</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> independent Canadian units which were steadily arriving from Canada. During the autumn of 1915 Mercer was able to shape this force (which included dismounted cavalry regiments and British Indian artillery) into an effective infantry unit and in January 1916 he was confirmed as Major-General {{in command of the}} 3rd Canadian Division, as this disparate force became.|$|E

5|$|Shipbuilding {{business}} in Sibu {{started in the}} 1930s to supply wooden boats for river and coastal navigation. It flourished in 1970s and 1980s along with increase in exports of tropical timber from Sarawak. It later shifted its focus into steel boat building. Some of the vessels in demand are tug boats for towing logs, barges for carrying logs, anchor handlers, Offshore Support Vessels (OSV), ferries, and express boats for carrying passengers. Most of the boats built are <b>of</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> medium in size. There are a total of 40 shipyards in Sibu. A majority of the workers are welders. In 2003, 17 of the shipyards were relocated to Rantau Panjang Integrated Shipyard Shipbuilding Industrial Zone, Sibu. This included Yong Chin Kui, Far East, and TuongAik. The boats built in Sibu are often exported to neighbouring state of Sabah, Peninsular Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and United Arab Emirates. In the year 1991, a total of US$50 million was earned for shipbuilding {{business in}} Sibu. In 2011, Sibu ship exports stood at RM 525 million. Sibu is also the only city in Sarawak to possess a vehicle assembly plant. The plant is operated by N.B. Heavy Industries Sdn.

5|$|The {{attack on}} Darwin in February 1942 marked {{the start of}} a {{prolonged}} aerial campaign over northern Australia and the Japanese-occupied Netherlands East Indies. Following the first attack on Darwin the Allies rapidly deployed fighter squadrons and reinforced the Army's Northern Territory Force to protect the town from a feared invasion. These air units also attacked Japanese positions in the NEI and the Japanese responded by staging dozens of air raids on Darwin and nearby airfields during 1942 and 1943, few of which caused significant damage. These raids were opposed by US, Australian and British fighters and suffered increasingly heavy casualties as Darwin's defences were improved. The Japanese also conducted a number <b>of</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> ineffective raids on towns and airfields in northern Queensland and Western Australia during 1942 and 1943.|$|E
