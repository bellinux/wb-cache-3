5|$|Following the {{penetrations}} inland, confused hard-fought individual actions {{pushed the}} foothold out {{two and a}} half kilometers (1.5 mi) deep in the Colleville area to the east, less than that west of St. Laurent, and an isolated penetration in the Vierville area. Pockets of enemy resistance still fought <b>on</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> American front line, and the whole beachhead remained under artillery fire. At 21:00 the landing of the 26th RCT completed the planned landing of infantry, but losses in equipment were high, including 26 artillery pieces, over 50 tanks, about 50 landing craft and 10 larger vessels.|$|E

And even for me, when I look at them, they say so much. Photos really tell a thousand words.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the public}} blamed Ernest for Sellis's death. The more extreme Whig papers, anti-royal pamphleteers, and caricaturists all offered nefarious {{explanations}} for Sellis's death, in which the Duke was to blame. Some stories had the Duke cuckolding Sellis, with the attack as retaliation, or Sellis killed for finding Ernest and Mrs. Sellis in bed together. Others suggested that the Duke was the lover of either Sellis or Neale, and that blackmail had {{played a part in}} the death. Both Roger Fulford and John Van der Kiste, who wrote books about George III's children, ascribe part of the animus and fear towards the Duke {{to the fact that he}} did not conduct love affairs in public, as did his older brothers. According to them, the public feared what vices might be going <b>on</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> locked doors of the Duke's house, and assumed the worst.|$|E

25|$|During the 1990s the Genealogical Research Kit which {{contained}} microfilm copies of popular key archival documents was expanded, renamed the Archives Resources Kit (ARK), and deposited at forty Community Access Points (CAPs), mainly public libraries, throughout New South Wales. This {{had the effect}} of reducing demand in the Reading Rooms at the Sydney and Western Sydney Records Centres. In addition to the Archives Resources Kit, work was going <b>on</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> scenes to make more State archives available to external users electronically. In 2000 Archives Investigator was developed jointly by the State Records Authority of NSW and the Council of the City of Sydney. (The name refers to HMS Investigator, in which Matthew Flinders completed the first circumnavigation of Australia, 1801–1803, and mapped much of the coast for the first time.) This made a large number of archival series available online via the Internet. Work on Photo Investigator, a related database commenced in the early 2000s and by 2006 a considerable number of photographs from the archives were available to users online.|$|E

Despite having {{recently}} signed a long-term contract, his form and goal record led to constant rumours {{of a big}} money move {{to a host of}} Premier League clubs. West Brom eventually issued a [...] "hands-off" [...] warning to other clubs. He claimed further hat-tricks against Crystal Palace and Huddersfield Town, and finished the season with 32 goals in 45 games. This tally left him as the country's top-scorer. He was named on the PFA Team of the Year for the First Division. He then submitted a written transfer request, and his spokesman told the press that there have [...] "been a number of things going <b>on</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> scenes which have unsettled him recently". In particular, his £1,400 a week salary was compared with the £5,000 a week salary of under-performing teammate Fabian de Freitas.|$|E

On it, Lewis is shown performing in front of several photographic set-ups, and shows what goes <b>on</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> scenes of them.

Richards says that she likes the idea that April [...] "went on a journey to try and find herself" [...] as [...] "a lot of people [...] try and do that {{because a lot of people}} get to the point where they're not really sure who they are any more". Richards also discusses the motif of April's paper dolls, saying that April can relate to them as in different places, she is [...] "still the same person", but that she is [...] "coloured in differently by different people and different surroundings". Alexandra Hewett, who played the Young April, described the dolls as April's [...] "only real friends".|$|E

[...] Kyle Anderson of MTV.com wrote, [...] "the story takes an amazingly candid look at the conversations and arguments that went <b>on</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> scenes. It even takes you to the moment when O'Brien decides that he has to walk away from 'The Tonight Show.'" [...] Paul Schwartzman of The Washington Post wrote that it [...] "is a great read and an example of narrative journalism's power when practiced by a reporter steeped in his subject matter." [...] Lynette Rice of Entertainment Weekly gave Carter's book a rating of B-, and wrote, [...] "In the end, Carter presents a pretty compelling argument that while the fourth-place network lost the public relations war, it probably won the late-night battle."

500|$|Leicester City's manager Brian Little was {{forbidden}} {{to speak to}} Aston Villa by their board, after rumours began circulating that Ellis wanted to hire him. Although maintaining {{that he had not}} spoken to Ellis about the possibility of taking over at Villa, Little resigned from his post at Leicester even though he was contracted to the club {{until the end of the}} 1997–98 season. Three days after his resignation, Ellis hired him as the new Villa manager. Little kept Villa in the Premiership, and then reshaped the squad in the 1995 close-season by selling most of the club's older players and buying in several younger ones. Villa won the 1996 League Cup with a win over Leeds United, reached the FA Cup semi-finals and finished fourth in the Premiership in the 199596 season. In February 1998, with Villa standing 15th in the Premiership and speculation rife that he would be sacked, Little resigned, stating that, [...] "There were certain things going <b>on</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> scenes which were affecting my own managerial position." [...] Ellis came out with a statement directly challenging that it had anything to do with the management at Villa Park. Instead, he suggested it was due to a [...] "variety of pressures" [...] including abuse directed towards Little and his family by irate fans.|$|E
500|$|Ramirez {{described}} her character {{as someone who}} [...] "appears {{to be a certain}} way, but has some very complex issues going <b>on</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> scenes. She seems to be a very strong personality, someone who really believes in herself and has worked very hard to get where she is. She's very competitive but does have a sense of self, so she doesn't need to win all the time." [...] At Torres' initial appearance on the show, she was disliked by fans, due to her {{getting in the way of}} O'Malley and Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo)'s relationship. When asked of this, Ramirez said: [...] "You do run across a lot of people who are extremely invested in that story line. Obviously, I've heard some negative stuff." [...] The end of the show's fourth season saw Torres grow closer to cardiothoracic surgeon Erica Hahn, in a relationship referred to by the portmanteau [...] "Eri-Cal" [...] and later [...] "Callica" [...] by Michael Ausiello of Entertainment Weekly. Rhimes stated that: [...] "Callie and Erica have an undeniable chemistry, and watching the story unfold is something the writers are looking forward to. I wanted to illuminate their relationship in the same way we do all relationships on the show— it will be funny, sweet, honest, and a little bit dirty." ...|$|E

They don't understand why I wouldn't go back to play Jason if I'm ready to work again. But what happens at GH should stay at GH." [...] Phelps dismissed rumors that she has [...] "lured" [...] Burton away from General Hospital. While clarifying rumors about him leaving General Hospital because of Phelps' appointment as executive producer of The Young and the Restless, Burton described them as [...] "interesting". He told On-Air On-Soaps that he knew people would try to put [...] "two and two together", but it was never his intention to leave General Hospital purposely, as he just couldn't reach a contractual agreement with the show. [...] "It’s just like a sports player...when a deal does not work out with his team, there might be another team out there that might want him," [...] Burton said. During the week Burton debuted on the series as Dylan, the show experienced an increase of over 105,000 viewers, averaging 4.7 million viewers. Michael Fairman, during an interview with Burton, noted the [...] "significant increase" [...] in viewers, which Burton was a [...] "big reason" [...] for.|$|E
