5|$|Debate {{on church}} {{officers}} began on 19 October. The Assembly began with <b>the</b> issue <b>of</b> ordination, as many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>divines</b> {{were concerned about}} <b>the</b> rise <b>of</b> various sectarian movements and <b>the</b> lack <b>of</b> any mechanism for ordination <b>of</b> ministers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> established church. While some members {{did not seem to}} think ordination necessary for preachers (though they should not administer the sacraments without it), a majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>divines</b> thought any regular preaching without ordination unacceptable and wished to erect a provisional presbytery for purposes of ordination. There was also debate at this early stage over <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> visible church. The congregationalists considered a church to be a single local congregation, while the majority considered the national church to be a unity and were alarmed at <b>the</b> prospect <b>of</b> a disintegrated English church. Despite these debates, up until <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> 1643 there was hope that a common church government could be framed that would be satisfactory to all parties involved.|$|R

5|$|In England, Parliament held James {{abandoned}} the throne by fleeing from English territory to France.

This effectively rejected the principle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Divine</b> Right of Kings which had driven political conflict for the last 60 years.

5|$|Ahimsa {{is one of}} the {{cardinal}} virtues and an important tenet of Jainism, Hinduism, and Buddhism. Ahimsa is a multidimensional concept, inspired by the premise that all living beings have the spark <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>divine</b> spiritual energy; therefore, to hurt another being is to hurt oneself. Ahimsa has also been related to the notion that any violence has karmic consequences. While ancient scholars of Hinduism pioneered and over time perfected the principles of Ahimsa, the concept reached an extraordinary status in the ethical philosophy of Jainism. Most popularly, Mahatma Gandhi strongly believed in the principle of ahimsa.|$|E

40|$|Recent anthropological {{studies of}} divination have {{been marked by}} renewed and appreciative concern for the {{epistemological}} and performative dimensions of divination. Pursuing these recent investigations, and especially their interest in <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> knowledge and modes of knowing underlying divinatory ritual, <b>the</b> first part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> article attempts an understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interpretative operations and modalities of knowledge involved in different forms of divination practised in Senegal and Gambia today. At the same time, and somewhat antithetically, it will {{be argued that the}} focus on <b>the</b> question <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cognitive nature <b>of</b> divinatory knowledge and <b>the</b> person <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>diviner</b> may also be problematic: it may lead to undervaluing <b>the</b> main quality <b>of</b> divination, which lies perhaps not in its cognitive but its consultational properties. Further decentring its initial cognitive outlook, <b>the</b> second part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> article addresses <b>the</b> question <b>of</b> how to understand the fact that within the divinatory discourse itself it is not <b>the</b> <b>diviner</b> but <b>the</b> divinatory apparatus that is being addressed as <b>the</b> source <b>of</b> enunciation. Where, if not in <b>the</b> person <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>diviner,</b> is <b>the</b> source <b>of</b> <b>the</b> knowledge underlying and resulting from divinatory procedure to be located? And in how far is it possible, as <b>the</b> title <b>of</b> this article suggests, to conceive <b>of</b> <b>the</b> divinatory process as being autonomous <b>of</b> <b>the</b> expertise and specialist agency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individual diviner?status: publishe...|$|R
5|$|Bahá'u'lláh {{stated that}} he was a {{messenger}} of God, and he used the term Manifestation of God to define the concept of an intermediary between humanity and God. In the Bahá'í writings, the Manifestations of God are a series of interrelated personages who speak with a divine voice and who reflect the attributes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>divine</b> into the human world for the progress and advancement of human morals and civilization. The Manifestations of God, as explained by Bahá'u'lláh, are not incarnations of God, but have a two-fold station; one which is the divine in that they reveal God's attributes, but not God's essence, and one which is human in that they represent the physical qualities of common man, and have human limitations. Bahá'u'lláh wrote that God will never manifest his essence into the world.|$|E
5|$|Belgrano studied {{near the}} {{intellectual}} elite of Spain, {{and by that}} time there were heated discussions about the ongoing French Revolution. The principles of equality and freedom, the universal scope of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, and criticism <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>divine</b> right of kings were constant topics of debate. Among the supporters of these ideas it was thought that Spain should be remade under similar principles, and critics of such thought were rejected as tyrants or proponents of outdated ideas. However, the Spanish Enlightenment was slightly different from the French one as it still respected religion and the monarchy. Thus, despite the new influences, Belgrano remained a strong Catholic and monarchist.|$|E
5|$|Born into {{an aristocratic}} Bengali family of Calcutta, Vivekananda was {{inclined}} towards spirituality.

After Ramakrishna's death, Vivekananda toured the Indian subcontinent extensively and acquired first-hand knowledge of the conditions prevailing in British India.

Vivekananda conducted hundreds {{of public and private}} lectures and classes, disseminating tenets of Hindu philosophy in the United States, England and Europe.
