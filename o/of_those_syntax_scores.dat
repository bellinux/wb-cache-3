40|$|AbstractBackgroundAlthough {{trials have}} shown {{efficacy}} of unprotected left main percutaneous coronary intervention (uLMPCI), data from Indian subcontinent are lacking. Hence, we planned this observational analysis of single-center uLMPCI data. ObjectivesTo study long-term outcome after uLMPCI and identify predictors of adverse outcome. MethodsCase details of 62 consecutive patients of uLMPCI between 2006 and 2013 were retrieved from a computerized database wherein detailed records were maintained. ResultsMean follow-up duration was 669. 8 ± 404. 2 days. Procedural success rate was 98. 4 %. Primary endpoint was composite of major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE), which included cardiac death (CD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), myocardial infarction (MI), {{and need for}} repeat intervention (RI) at three years. MACCE occurred in 13 (20. 9 %) patients. Cardiac death (CD), (including possible stent thrombosis), RI, and CVA occurred in 6 (9. 7 %), 5 (8 %), and 2 (3. 2 %) patients, respectively. Overall three-year MACCE-free survival rate was 76. 7 %. Event-free survival rate was similar among patients who underwent uLMPCI alone and patients who underwent uLMPCI along with additional one-vessel PCI [(88. 9 % vs 81. 8 %), p= 0. 492], while survival rate was lower in patients who underwent uLMPCI along with PCI of additional two or more vessels (40 %, p= 0. 036). Patients with <b>syntax</b> <b>score</b> ≤ 32 had higher event-free survival rate than <b>those</b> with <b>syntax</b> <b>score</b> > 32 [(87. 1 % vs 33. 3 %), p= 0. 001]. <b>Syntax</b> <b>score</b> > 32 was the only independent predictor of adverse outcome.

40|$|Background: Fragmented QRS (f-QRS) {{complexes}} are novel electrocardiographic signals, which reflect myocardial conduction {{delays in}} patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). The significance of f-QRS complexes in non-ST elevation ACS patients for detection {{of the severity of}} CAD (correlation with <b>Syntax</b> <b>score)</b> was evaluated in this prospective study. Methods: A total of 104 patients with non-ST-elevation ACS who underwent invasive coronary angiography for detection of coronary artery disease were recruited prospectively in this study, ECG was done to all patients, which showed f-QRS in 50 patients (f-QRS group) and inverted T wave or depressed ST in 54 patients (non f-QRS group). The significance of f-QRS complexes on 12 -lead ECG for detection of the severity of the CAD (correlated with <b>Syntax</b> <b>score)</b> was assessed in this cohort of patients.

40|$|Background: Coronary {{artery disease}} (CAD) affects {{both men and}} women. Cardiovascular {{biomarkers}} have been suggested to relate to CAD severity, but data on sex-specificity is scarce. Therefore, we investigated the association of established biomarkers with the severity of CAD in stable patients undergoing coronary angiography in a sex-specific manner. Methods: We studied stable patients undergoing coronary angiography and measured CAD severity by <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> and biomarker levels (N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT pro-BNP), high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP), cystatin C (CysC), myeloperoxidase (MPO), high-sensitivity troponin I (hsTnI) and von Willebrand factor (VWF)). We tested for sex differences in SYNergy between percutaneous coronary intervention with TAXUS (TM) and cardiac surgery (<b>SYNTAX)</b> <b>scores</b> and biomarker levels using multivariable ANCOVA. We investigated the association of biomarker levels with <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> in a multivariable linear regression with interaction terms for sex. Results: We analysed data on 460 men and 175 women. <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>scores</b> were significantly lower in women (9. 99 points vs. 11. 88 points). Univariably, hsCRP and hsTnI levels {{were significantly associated with}} <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>scores</b> (both beta 2. 5). In multivariable analysis only hsCRP associated with <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> (b 1. 9, p = 0. 009). Sex did not modify the association of biomarkers with <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score.</b> Conclusion: CAD severity as quantified by <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> is lower in women than men based on coronary angiography.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: There {{are limited}} data {{comparing}} long-term outcomes of {{coronary artery bypass}} graft surgery (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stents (DES) in patients with high surgical risk. We evaluated 5 -year outcomes following CABG versus PCI with DES in 598 patients with left main or multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD) and a high surgical risk [EuroSCORE (European system for cardiac operative risk evaluation) >= 6]. METHODS: Databases were merged from the BEST, PRECOMBAT and SYNTAX trials. The primary outcome was a major adverse cardio-cerebral event (MACCE), defined as the composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, stroke or repeat revascularization. RESULTS: During 5 -year follow-up, the rates of MACCE were 29. 4 % in the CABG group and 43. 8 % in the PCI group [hazard ratio (HR), 0. 64; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 0. 49 - 0. 84; P = 0. 001]. The MACCE was significantly better with CABG than with PCI in patients with high and intermediate <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>scores</b> (34. 9 % vs 46. 3 %, P = 0. 039, and 29. 7 % vs 47. 6 %, P = 0. 010, respectively), but comparable between the two groups in <b>those</b> with low <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>scores.</b> The rates of all-cause death and stroke were similar between the two groups.

40|$|Aims: The <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> {{is a tool}} to {{quantify}} the complexity of coronary artery disease. We investigated {{the relation between the}} <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> and the occurrence of a periprocedural myocardial infarction (PMI) according to the historical definition of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the recently updated universal definition of MI. Methods and results: The <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> was calculated in 1, 243 patients enrolled in TWENTE, a randomised trial which assessed second-generation drug-eluting stents. PMI was defined by the WHO definition and the third universal definition of MI. Patients were divided into tertiles of the SYNTAX score: ≤ 7 (n= 430); > 7 and < 15 (n= 390); ≥ 15 (n= 423). PMI according to the WHO definition occurred more frequently in patients in the highest <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> tertile (7. 3 % vs. 3. 1 % vs. 1. 6 %, p< 0. 001) compared to the mid and lowest tertile. Similar findings were seen for universal PMI (9. 9 % vs. 7. 7 % vs. 3. 7 %, p< 0. 01).

Objective: We sought to 1) validate and compare {{the performance of the}} <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>Score</b> 1 and 2 for predicting major cardiovascular events at 4 years in patients who underwent unprotected left main angioplasty and 2) evaluate the long-term outcome according to the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> 2 -recommended revascularization strategy. Methods: We retrospectively studied 132 patients from a single-centre registry who underwent unprotected left main angioplasty between March 1999 and December 2010. Discrimination and calibration of both models were assessed by ROC curve analysis, calibration curves and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test. Results: Total event rate was 26. 5 % at 4 years. The AUC for the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>Score</b> 1 and <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>Score</b> 2 for percutaneous coronary intervention, was 0. 61 (95 % CI: 0. 49 - 0. 73) and 0. 67 (95 % CI: 0. 57 - 0. 78), respectively. Despite a good overall adjustment for both models, the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>Score</b> 2 tended to underpredict risk. In the 47 patients (36 %) who should have undergone surgery according to the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>Score</b> 2, event rate was numerically higher (30 % vs. 25 %; p= 0. 54), and for those with a higher difference between the two <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>Score</b> 2 scores (Percutaneous coronary intervention vs. Coronary artery by-pass graft risk estimation greater than 5. 7 %), event rate was almost double (40 % vs. 22 %; p= 0. 2).

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Syntax</b> <b>score</b> is a lesion-based {{angiographic}} scoring system, originally {{devised to}} grade the anatomic complexity of {{coronary artery disease}} (CAD) and thereby facilitate consensus {{in the study of}} a diagnostic angiogram between surgeons and interventional cardiologists. Suitable biology marker to predict the severity of CAD and to have a treatment decision for revascularization by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or bypass surgery, is still unknown. Which biology marker can be a predictor for higher <b>Syntax</b> <b>score</b> remains unknown as well. METHODS: Severity of 105 patients who underwent coronary angiography, were evaluated with <b>Syntax</b> <b>score.</b> Laboratory tests were conducted for routine blood test, serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, kidney function, creatinine and hemoglobin A 1 c (HbA 1 c). RESULTS: Ureum had significant correlation with <b>Syntax</b> <b>score,</b> p= 0. 016 and 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 0. 05 - 0. 55.

BackgroundThe Logistic Clinical <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> allows for an individualized prediction of 1 -year mortality in patients undergoing contemporary percutaneous coronary intervention. It is composed of a “Core” Model (anatomical <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score,</b> age, creatinine clearance, and left ventricular ejection fraction), and “Extended” Model (composed of an additional 6 clinical variables), and has previously been cross validated in 7 contemporary stent trials (> 6, 000 patients). MethodsOne-year all-cause death was analyzed in 2, 627 patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention from the ACUITY (Acute Catheterization and Urgent Intervention Triage Strategy) trial. Mortality predictions from the Core and Extended Models were studied with respect to discrimination, that is, separation <b>of</b> <b>those</b> with and without 1 -year all-cause death (assessed by the concordance [C] statistic), and calibration, that is, agreement between observed and predicted outcomes (assessed with validation plots). Decision curve analyses, which weight the harms (false positives) against benefits (true positives) of using a risk score to make mortality predictions, were undertaken to assess clinical usefulness. ResultsIn the ACUITY trial, the median <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> was 9. 0 (interquartile range 5. 0 to 16. 0); approximately 40 % of patients had 3 -vessel disease, 29 % diabetes, and 85 % underwent drug-eluting stent implantation. Validation plots confirmed agreement between observed and predicted mortality. The Core and Extended Models demonstrated substantial improvements in the discriminative ability for 1 -year all-cause death compared with the anatomical <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> in isolation (C-statistics: SYNTAX score: 0. 64, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0. 56 to 0. 71; Core Model: 0. 74, 95 % CI: 0. 66 to 0. 79; Extended Model: 0. 77, 95 % CI: 0. 70 to 0. 83).

We compared clinical outcomes of PCI versus CABG in patients with <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> ≤ 34 and patients with <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> > 34. ResultsThe rates of 2 -year mortality were similar between CABG and PCI in the group of patients with <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> ≤ 34 (6. 2 % vs. 8. 1 %, p = 0. 461). Among patients with <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> > 34, <b>those</b> treated with CABG had lower rates of mortality (8. 5 % vs. 32. 7 %, p 34 (hazard ratio: 2. 54, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 09 to 5. 92, p = 0. 031).

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the prognostic value of the <b>Syntax</b> <b>score</b> in patients undergoing CABG for 3 -vessel CAD. METHODS: A cohort of 320 consecutive patients with multivessel (3 -vessel) CAD who were subjected for CABG were included in this study and divided into tertiles according to the <b>Syntax</b> <b>score</b> (34). During the 1 -year follow-up, cardiovascular events including death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke were systematically indexed. The primary end point was the composite criteria death/MI/stroke. RESULTS: The <b>Syntax</b> <b>score</b> ranged from 11 - 74 with a mean of 31. 2 +/- 12. 6 and a median of 28. 5 [22 - 38]. Baseline clinical characteristics were similar among the tertiles. No statistical difference was found for the composite criteria death/MI/stroke: 9. 4 % versus 7. 5 % versus 10. 4 % in the groups with a <b>Syntax</b> <b>score</b> 34, respectively (P = 0. 754). CONCLUSION: Unlike for PCI, the <b>Syntax</b> <b>score</b> has a poor prognostic value for severe cardiovascular events in patients undergoing CABG for 3 -vessel CAD.

The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the association between GDF- 15 and the <b>syntax</b> <b>score</b> for risk prediction of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) at 2 -year follow-up in patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTEACS). This is a prospective cohort study of 502 patients with NSTEACS. The <b>syntax</b> <b>score</b> was calculated from baseline coronary angiography. Blood samples were obtained at study entry for the assessment of GDF- 15 and high-sensitivity C reactive protein. One hundred and three patients (20. 5 %) showed MACE at 2 -year follow-up. Patients who developed MACE had greater GDF- 15 concentrations and <b>syntax</b> <b>score</b> (p < 0. 001) compared to patients who did not. There was a positive, but moderate, correlation between GDF- 15 and <b>syntax</b> <b>score</b> (ρ = 0. 45, p < 0. 0001). On Cox regression analysis, only GDF- 15 levels (p < 0. 001), body mass index (p = 0. 04), and <b>syntax</b> <b>score</b> (p < 0. 001) remained independent predictors of the MACE. The area under the curve of GDF- 15 (0. 912, 95 % confidence interval 0. 894 to 0. 944) was significantly greater compared to high-sensitivity C reactive protein and <b>syntax</b> <b>score.</b> In conclusion, in patients with NSTEACS, levels of GDF- 15 at admission were correlated with the <b>syntax</b> <b>score</b> and independently associated with an increased risk of MACE during 2 -year follow-up.

We examined the influence of the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>Score</b> on the incidence of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events. MethodsAll patients with de novo left main or 3 -vessel disease undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting from January 2005 to December 2008 at our institution (Hospital Clínico San Carlos, Madrid, Spain) were retrospectively assessed, and their <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>Score</b> was calculated. The influence of the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>Score</b> on postprocedural and follow-up mortality and combined major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (including death, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, and repeat revascularization) was identified by multivariate analysis. Balancing score analysis was performed to eliminate the effect of potential confounders. ResultsA total of 716 patients were enrolled. Mean <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>Score</b> was 34. 5 (standard deviation, 6. 7; range,  11. 5 – 76). Three groups of patients were identified according to the score terciles: low (≤ 33), intermediate (33 – 37), and high (> 37). These terciles scores differed greatly from those reported by the SYNTAX trial investigators. The multivariate analysis identified that the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>Score</b> was associated with follow-up mortality (hazard ratio =  1. 046, P = . 015) and combined early and follow-up major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (odds ratio =  1. 079, P < . 001; and hazard ratio =  1. 034, P = . 026, respectively). Balancing score-adjusted analyses demonstrated that the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>Score</b> was independently associated with early and late major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (odds ratio =  1. 65, P < . 001; and hazard ratio =  1. 034, P = . 027, respectively). ConclusionsSYNTAX Score was remarkably high among patients undergoing surgical off-pump myocardial revascularization at our institution.

40|$|BackgroundPercutaneous {{coronary}} intervention (PCI) is {{well established}} procedure for management of coronary artery disease. However, up to 50 % of cases associated with myocardial injury with subsequent increased mortality. Currently there is no reliable method to predict this injury. Aim of the workto investigate {{the ability of the}} <b>syntax</b> <b>score</b> to predict peri-procedure myocardial injury (PMI) in patients undergoing PCI. Patients and Methods: This study included 60 patients. They are divided into two groups (1 =Non-diabetics) and (2 =Diabetics) and subjected to: History and physical examination, ECG, echocardiography, calculation of <b>syntax</b> <b>score,</b> PCI and troponin T. ResultsOur study shows highly significant elevation in the troponin level in both groups after PCI, this elevation was more in group (2) (< 0. 001). In all study population the incidence of PMI was low in patients with low <b>syntax</b> <b>score</b> and increased proportionally with the increase in <b>syntax</b> <b>score.</b> We found the <b>syntax</b> <b>score</b> cutoff value for prediction of PMI to be 15 with calculated sensitivity of 95. 3 %, specificity 88. 2 %, predictive value positive 95. 3 % and Predictive value negative 88. 2 %. ConclusionSyntax score has the ability to predict the occurrence of PMI with accepted sensitivity. It can assess the patient risk for development of PMI which could help to rationalize the use of adjunctive therapies as distal embolic protection devices in high risk patients. Also, diabetic patients have higher incidence of complicated coronary lesions, higher <b>syntax</b> <b>score</b> and they are more labile for PMI...|$|R

We evaluated its role in predicting clinical outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in non-selected patients, treated in the daily clinical practice of a reference center. METHODSAnalysis of patients undergoing PCI from March to September 2009 and followed-up for up to 12 months. Patients were divided in tertiles according to the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score.</b> The primary endpoint included major adverse cardiac events (MACE) – death, non-fatal acute myocardial infarction and target-vessel revascularization. The ability of the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> in predicting MACE was assessed by the ROC (Receiver Operator Characteristic) curve. RESULTSTwo hundred and thirty-four patients with a mean <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> of 11. 6 ± 6. 2 points were included. Tertile I had a <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> ≤ 9 (average 5. 9); tertile II, > 9 and≤ 13 (average 10. 8); and tertile III, > 13 (average 18. 3). In the clinical follow-up of 7. 2 ± 4. 9 months, the incidence of MACE was greater in tertile III when compared to tertiles I and II (2. 5 % vs. 6. 4 % vs. 14. 1 %; P= 0. 0075). The ROC curve showed an area under the curve of 0. 667 (P= 0. 012) indicating a moderate ability to anticipate the occurrence of MACE in this population.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Coronary {{artery disease}} (CAD) {{is a global}} problem with {{increasing}} incidence in Asia. Prior studies reported inter-ethnic differences in the prevalence of CAD rather than the severity of CAD. The angiographic "synergy between percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with taxus and cardiac surgery" (<b>SYNTAX)</b> <b>score</b> quantifies CAD severity and predicts outcomes. We studied CAD severity and all-cause mortality in four globally populous ethnic groups: Caucasians, Chinese, Indians and Malays. METHODS: We quantified <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>scores</b> of 1, 000 multi-ethnic patients undergoing PCI in two tertiary hospitals in the Netherlands (Caucasians) and Singapore (Chinese, Indians and Malays). Within each ethnicity we studied 150 patients with stable CAD and 100 with ST-elevated myocardial infarction (STEMI). We made inter-ethnic comparisons of <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>scores</b> and all-cause mortality. RESULTS: Despite having a younger age (mean age Indians: 56. 8 and Malays: 57. 7 vs. Caucasians: 63. 7 years), multivariable adjusted <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>scores</b> were significantly higher in Indians and Malays than Caucasians with stable CAD: 13. 4 [11. 9 - 14. 9] and 13. 4 [12. 0 - 14. 8] vs. 9. 4 [8. 1 - 10. 8], p< 0. 001. Among STEMI patients, <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>scores</b> were highest in Chinese and Malays: 17. 7 [15. 9 - 19. 5] and 18. 8 [17. 1 - 20. 6] vs. 15. 5 [13. 5 - 17. 4] and 12. 7 [10. 9 - 14. 6] in Indians and Caucasians, p< 0. 001. Over a median follow-up of 709 days, 67 deaths (stable CAD: 37, STEMI: 30) occurred. Among STEMI patients, the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> independently predicted all-cause mortality: HR 2. 5 [1. 7 - 3. 8], p< 0. 001 for every 10 -point increase. All-cause mortality was higher in Indian and Malay STEMI patients than Caucasians, independent of <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> (adjusted HR 7. 2 [1. 5 - 34. 7], p= 0. 01 and 5. 8 [1. 2 - 27. 2], p= 0. 02).

Methods and results The <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> was retrospectively calculated in 848 patients enrolled in the SIRolimus-eluting stent compared with pacliTAXel-Eluting Stent for coronary revascularization (SIRTAX) trial. The CSS was calculated using age, and baseline left ventricular ejection fraction and creatinine clearance. A stratified post hoc comparison was performed for all-cause mortality, cardiac death, myocardial infarction (MI), ischaemia-driven target lesion revascularization (TLR), definite stent thrombosis, and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) at 1 - and 5 -year follow-up. Tertiles for <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> and CSS were defined as SSLOW ≤ 7, 7 14 and CSSLOW ≤ 8. 0, 8. 0 17. 0, respectively. Major adverse cardiac events rates were significantly higher in SSHIGH compared with SSLOW at 1 - and 5 -year follow-up, which was also seen at 5 years for all-cause mortality, cardiac death, MI, and TLR. Stratifying outcomes across CSS tertiles confirmed and augmented these results. Within CSSHIGH, 5 -year MACE increased with use of paclitaxel- compared with sirolimus-eluting stents (34. 7 vs. 21. 3 %, P= 0. 008). <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> and CSS were independent predictors of 5 -year MACE; CSS was an independent predictor for 5 -year mortality.

The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the relationship between HbA 1 c levels and the complexity of coronary artery lesions among the older patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). METHODS: This retrospective study enrolled a total of 3805 consecutive type 2 DM patients aged 60 years and older who underwent their first elective coronary angiography and had their HbA 1 c levels measured at the Chinese PLA General Hospital between December 2005 and December 2012. The complexity of the coronary artery lesions was evaluated using the <b>Syntax</b> <b>score,</b> and the subjects were divided into three groups according to their HbA 1 c levels. Logistic regression and Pearson correlation were used to analyze the association between the measured HbA 1 c levels and <b>Syntax</b> <b>score.</b> RESULTS: The mean age was 72. 3 ± 10. 6 years. The higher HbA 1 c levels were significantly associated with higher <b>Syntax</b> <b>score</b> (p< 0. 001). The unadjusted correlation coefficient of HbA 1 c levels and the <b>Syntax</b> <b>score</b> was 0. 371 (p< 0. 001).

The outcomes of interests were 3 -year incidences of major adverse vascular events (MAVE), including death, Q-wave myocardial infarction, and stroke and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE), including MAVE and target vessel revascularization of ULMCA. ResultsThe incidence of 3 -year MAVE was 6. 2 % in the lowest (≤ 23), 7. 1 % in the intermediate (23 to ∼ 36), and 17. 4 % in the highest (> 36) <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> tertile groups after PCI (p = 0. 010). However, the incidences of MAVE in the CABG group and MACCE in the PCI and CABG groups did not differ among the SYNTAX tertiles.

Secondary outcomes included the late occurrence of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events, left ventricular function, and New York Heart Association functional class. Results: The mean <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> was 32 +/- 13, and the mean preoperative left ventricular ejection fraction was 35 % +/- 6 %. At a median follow-up of 43 months, the primary outcome had occurred in 46 of 191 patients (24 %). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a survival of 81 % +/- 15 % for low, 77 % +/- 7 % for intermediate, and 53 % +/- 7 % for high coronary artery disease complexity (chi(2), 29. 4; P=. 001). The rate of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events was significantly greater in patients with a <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> of 33 or more (P=. 002). Greater degrees of left ventricular ejection fraction improvement were found in patients with a <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> of 32 or less (+ 15 % +/- 10 % vs + 4 % +/- 11 %; P=. 17) and translated into a better New York Heart Association functional class among patients with a lower <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> (P=. 01). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> (area under the curve, 0. 70; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 63 - 0. 77) {{to have the best}} predictive power for late mortality with respect to the preoperative left ventricular ejection fraction (area under the curve, 0. 59; difference, P=. 04) and incomplete revascularization (area under the curve, 0. 55; difference, P=. 02). Conclusions: The {{results of the present study}} have shown a direct relationship between coronary artery disease complexity and late outcomes of patients with left ventricular dysfunction who are undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. Additional studies are needed to confirm these findings...|$|R
