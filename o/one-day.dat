5|$|Only {{two centuries}} {{were made in}} the {{international}} <b>one-day</b> matches. Kepler Wessels scored the first, accruing 136 runs; his score is the highest in WSC <b>one-day</b> international matches, and makes him the only player to have scored a century in both a Supertest and an international <b>one-day</b> match in the WSC. The other century was scored by Martin Kent, who scored 109 runs. In all, 25 centuries were scored in Supertests, and 2 in international <b>one-day</b> matches. Seven of the centuries were scored at VFL Park in Melbourne, the most of any venue.|$|E
5|$|Englishmen Peter Denning and Graham Rose, jointly {{hold the}} record for most List A {{appearances}} for Somerset, while current captain Marcus Trescothick holds {{the record for}} the most runs in <b>one-day</b> cricket for Somerset, with 7,374 from his twenty-one years with the county. Barbadian Hallam Moseley ranks as the top wicket-taker, claiming 309 wickets in <b>one-day</b> cricket, nine more than England Test cricketer Ian Botham.|$|E
5|$|His {{breakthrough}} {{began in}} 2000, {{when he was}} voted Player of the Year by the Durham members, particularly for his <b>one-day</b> efforts. His form varied following a back injury, but he hit his stride in 2001, when he excelled both in the County Championship and in the <b>one-day</b> game. In the six English seasons from 2001, Collingwood has exceeded a batting average of 40 four times and achieved a bowling average of less than 40 on three occasions.|$|E

5|$|In 2013 Buttler {{broke into}} the England ODI side on a {{consistent}} basis, playing regularly throughout the year in both ODI and T20 formats. He played in every England match in the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy in England. Buttler played again in the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 in India in March and played regular <b>one-day</b> cricket again throughout the year. He scored his maiden <b>One-Day</b> International century against Sri Lanka at Lord's in May, scoring 121 in 61 balls with nine fours and four sixes, the fastest century by any England batsman. After first choice wicket-keeper Matt Prior stood down after injury on the 22 July 2014, Buttler was called up for the England squad for the third Test against India. He made 85 runs from 83 balls in his first Test innings. He played in the final three Tests of the series before reverting back to <b>one-day</b> duty, touring Sri Lanka {{at the end of}} the year.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, English county cricket teams began playing a {{shortened}} version of cricket which only lasted for one day. Starting in 1962 with a four-team knockout competition {{known as the}} Midlands Knock-Out Cup, and continuing with the inaugural Gillette Cup in 1963, <b>one-day</b> cricket grew in popularity in England. A national Sunday League was formed in 1969. The first <b>One-Day</b> International match was played {{on the fifth day}} of a rain-aborted Test match between England and Australia at Melbourne in 1971, to fill the time available and as compensation for the frustrated crowd. It was a forty over game with eight balls per over.|$|E
5|$|Irfan Pathan was {{recalled}} for India's ODI squad {{for last}} two matches of five match <b>one-day</b> series against West Indies in December 2011, and played in last match of the series, picking the wicket of first ball.|$|E

5|$|Burns {{had more}} first team {{opportunities}} during the 1993 season, {{due to a}} series of hand injuries to the first-choice wicket-keeper, Keith Piper. Burns' chances came particularly in <b>one-day</b> cricket; he appeared in eleven List A matches during the year. He scored 151 runs across nine batting innings at an average of 25.16, and reached his highest score of the season, 48 not out, against the touring Zimbabweans in September. Despite making another large century for the second team, scoring 172 against Yorkshire seconds, he struggled in first-class cricket; in six appearances he averaged just 9.60 for his 96 runs. The following year, his only first-class match was against Oxford University, with Piper ever-present in the County Championship. Burns continued to be selected as a wicket-keeper batsman in <b>one-day</b> cricket, though he was less successful than the previous year, scoring 86 runs at 10.75.|$|E
5|$|Cavendish was runner-up in the 2010 Tour's points {{classification}} and had won 15 {{stages in}} the three previous Tours; he had won a stage at the Tour of Oman, the <b>one-day</b> race Scheldeprijs and two stages at the Giro during the 2011 season prior to the Tour. Gilbert had amassed a total of eleven wins (not including the national championships) for the season before the Tour, including three spring classics: Liège–Bastogne–Liège, Amstel Gold Race and La Flèche Wallonne. Farrar's form in the lead-up to the Tour included a stage win in both Tirreno–Adriatico and the Ster ZLM Toer. Hushovd, the world road race champion, only had one win in the season before the Tour, a stage of the Tour de Suisse. Petacchi's best results prior the Tour were a trio of {{stages in the}} Giro, the Volta a Catalunya and the Tour of Turkey. The major victory of Boonen's season up to the Tour was the Gent–Wevelgem <b>one-day</b> race.|$|E
5|$|Due to his {{international}} commitments, Kartik {{made only}} sporadic appearances during the Indian domestic scene in 2007–08. He took nine wickets at 44.22 and scored 77 runs at 19.25 in three first-class fixtures. After being dropped from India's limited-overs team, Kartik continued his strong <b>one-day</b> form at domestic level, taking six wickets at 25.33 at an economy rate of only 3.16 in six matches.|$|E
5|$|Germany was {{dependent}} on imported oil; a confrontation with Britain over the Czechoslovakian dispute could curtail Germany's oil supplies. This forced Hitler to call off Fall Grün, originally planned for 1 October 1938. On 29 September Hitler, Neville Chamberlain, Édouard Daladier, and Mussolini attended a <b>one-day</b> conference in Munich {{that led to the}} Munich Agreement, which handed over the Sudetenland districts to Germany.|$|E
5|$|Gilchrist was {{in strong}} form {{ahead of the}} Tests, scoring 393 runs at 49.13 in the ODIs in England. The {{highlight}} was the 121 not out in {{the final game of}} the <b>one-day</b> NatWest Series, Gilchrist being awarded the man-of-the-match award. However, he performed poorly in the five Tests, with 204 runs at 25.50. Just as in India in 2001, Australia lost 2–1, and Gilchrist fell four times to man of the series Andrew Flintoff.|$|E
5|$|He {{went on to}} captain the <b>one-day</b> side against India, {{where they}} won the 1st ODI but lost an {{entertaining}} 2nd ODI at Bristol by 9 runs. After the 2nd ODI Collingwood was fined half of his match fee for a slow over rate. England eventually won the closely fought series 4–3.|$|E
5|$|Helen became pregnant; Simpson's {{apartment}} in Paris was now unsuitable {{and a larger}} home in France was not in their means. In October, with help from his friend, Albert Beurick, they moved into a small cottage in Ghent. Low on funds, Simpson earned money in <b>one-day</b> track races in Belgium.|$|E
5|$|His second {{first-class}} {{season with}} Middlesex {{was much less}} successful than the first; Kartik took only 16 wickets at 34.06 in seven matches, with a best of 4/101 against Derbyshire. He scored 161 runs at 20.12 with a best of 44 against Warwickshire. His <b>one-day</b> form was also lean, yielding six wickets at 33.00 in six matches.|$|E
5|$|Historical records {{reveal that}} despite the {{repeated}} attacks by enemies to capture the fort, it was not taken, except for a lone <b>one-day</b> occupation by Kamran Mirza. Kamran was the second son of the Mughal Emperor Babur who attacked Bikaner in 1534, which was then ruled by Rao Jait Singh.|$|E
5|$|Immediately after Warne and Waugh had met John in Colombo, Australia {{defeated}} Pakistan in a <b>one-day</b> match, scoring 7/179 and restricting Pakistan to 9/151 in reply. There were {{suspicions that}} the Pakistanis had thrown {{the game by}} batting slowly, although Warne said he had genuinely tried his best, pointing {{out that he was}} named man-of-the-match. Warne and May had alleged that Malik offered them money to bowl badly {{on the final day of}} the First Test in Karachi. Australia then reduced Pakistan from 3/157 to 9/258, and appeared set for victory, but a last-wicket partnership took them to the target of 314. The win was registered when wicket-keeper Ian Healy missed a stumping chance from Warne and the ball went for four byes. Warne denied that he had thrown the match, again pointing out he was named man-of-the-match. Waugh had alleged that Malik offered him money to help Australia lose a <b>one-day</b> match during the same tour. He denied the allegation that he did so. Waugh scored an unbeaten 121, but it was not enough to prevent Australia from suffering a nine-wicket defeat.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, {{he scored}} an unbeaten 117 against Kerala in the <b>one-day</b> tournament and was {{selected}} for the tour of New Zealand as the reserve wicket-keeper. After watching the entire T20 and ODI series from the sidelines, {{he played in the}} Second Test after Dhoni was injured, but he was criticized for dropping multiple catches as the hosts amassed 9/619 and made only six in his only innings.|$|E
5|$|In April 2016, the Rochester Razorsharks, a {{professional}} minor-league basketball team, signed McElwain to a <b>one-day</b> contract for their regular season finale against the Western New York Thundersnow. With the Razorsharks leading {{by more than}} 40 points late in the game, McElwain was put in and scored 10 points, including 2 three-point shots.|$|E
5|$|In January 2005, {{a series}} of <b>one-day</b> {{domestic}} tournaments were held, and Karthik {{had a chance to}} press his claims for selection in that format, having never played more than three List A matches in a sequence. In five matches for Tamil Nadu, he only had three innings, but scored 72 and 80 in two of them. He was then called into South Zone’s senior team for the first time, to play in the zonal <b>one-day</b> competition. He scored 106 runs at 26.50 in four outings for the southerners. In the Challenger Trophy, Karthik played for India A against India B and India Seniors, and made little impact, scoring 17 and 3. He then played for South Zone in the first-class Duleep Trophy, but continued to have modest returns with the bat, scoring 101 runs at 25.25 in two outings, although he was run out in one innings after making a start and reaching 59.|$|E
5|$|In five matches for his {{new team}} during the 1994–95, he took 24 wickets at 14.58 {{including}} a haul of 5/28 against Vidarbha. He was rewarded with selection in the Under-19 Central Zone team for the zonal <b>one-day</b> tournament, taking five wickets at 25.00 in four matches. He had little success with the bat, scoring 47 on one occasion during the season, but otherwise only aggregating nine runs in six innings.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} of the <b>one-day</b> competition, she scored 23 from 37 balls batting at No. 3 and took two catches as New South Wales {{defeated}} Victoria by 59 runs. Healy ended her first full season as a wicket-keeper with 208 runs at 29.71, the second-highest average in her team behind Blackwell. In 11 matches, she also took 11 catches and completed 9 stumpings, effecting more dismissals than any other player.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, Kerry Packer {{established}} the rival World Series Cricket (WSC) competition. It introduced {{many of the}} now commonplace features of One Day International cricket, including coloured uniforms, matches played at night under floodlights with a white ball and dark sight screens, and, for television broadcasts, multiple camera angles, effects microphones to capture sounds from {{the players on the}} pitch, and on-screen graphics. The first of the matches with coloured uniforms was the WSC Australians in wattle gold versus WSC West Indians in coral pink, played at VFL Park in Melbourne on 17 January 1979. The success and popularity of the domestic <b>one-day</b> competitions in England {{and other parts of the}} world, as well as the early <b>One-Day</b> Internationals, prompted the ICC to consider organising a Cricket World Cup.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>one-day</b> tournament, Ambrose took 18 wickets at 13.38. He took eight wickets in the two-match final—both {{games were}} {{won by the}} West Indies. In the first final, he took five for 32, driven to bowl with more hostility when the Australian batsman Dean Jones asked him to remove his white {{wristbands}} while bowling. He followed up with three for 26 in the second match to be named player of the finals.|$|E
5|$|It {{has hosted}} more Test matches {{than any other}} ground in the Caribbean, and also hosted a number of <b>One-Day</b> International (ODI) matches, {{including}} many World Series Cricket games in 1979 and matches of the 2007 Cricket World Cup. The Trinidad and Tobago cricket team play most of their home matches at the ground, {{and it is the}} home ground of the Caribbean Premier League team Trinbago Knight Riders.|$|E
