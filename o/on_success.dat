25|$|Building <b>on</b> <b>success,</b> on 20 August Vang Pao {{expanded}} his offensive. He continued to plan on a two-pronged operation. As before, {{there was a}} northern column. Two battalions of Royalist regular volunteers—Bataillon Volontaires 21 and Bataillon Volontaires 24—were stiffened with the 101 Bataillon Parachutistes (101st Paratroop Battalion). This probe moved northeastward from Ban Na; their immediate objective was Moung Phanh. The second column, moving in from the south, consisted of two regimental-size units of guerrillas, Groupe Mobile 22 and Groupe Mobile 23. Most of the Kou Kiet troops were armed with M16s.|$|E

Atkinson played regularly in first-class matches until the middle of the season, but did not appear at all in the new John Player League, the Sunday one-day competition which Lancashire won in its first season. He was dropped from the side in mid July, and never appeared again in first-class cricket. He was 31 at the time.|$|E

25|$|Many {{alternative}} therapies and interventions are available, ranging from elimination diets to chelation therapy. Few {{are supported by}} scientific studies. Treatment approaches lack empirical support in quality-of-life contexts, and many programs focus <b>on</b> <b>success</b> measures that lack predictive validity and real-world relevance.

Even {{if they do not}} help, conservative treatments such as changes in diet are expected to be harmless aside from their bother and cost.

25|$|Based <b>on</b> <b>success</b> to date, the {{decision}} was made to once again extend the offensive. The objective now became cutting the Ho Chi Minh Trail near the transshipment point of Tchepone. Tchepone was garrisoned by six PAVN battalions defended by antiaircraft guns. Air support for the government forces would come from the numerous tactical air sorties already directed at the Trail, and would be directed by Nail FACs and Raven FACs. Although the Royalists realized that capturing the actual town was unlikely, they planned to occupy another road junction, Routes 9/91 ten kilometers northwest of Tchepone. They also planned to cut Route 9 between Tchepone and Vietnam, stranding the North Vietnamese garrison. However, they paused to refresh and realign their forces.|$|E
25|$|U.S. analyst Ashley J. Tellis {{argues that}} the Indo-US nuclear deal is {{attractive}} to India because it gives it access to far more options on its civil nuclear programme than would otherwise be the case, primarily by ending its isolation from the international nuclear community. These options include access to latest technologies, access to higher unit output reactors which are more economical, access to global finance for building reactors, ability to export its indigenous small reactor size PHWRs, better information flow for its research community, etc. Finally, the deal also gives India two options that are relatively independent from the three-stage programme, {{at least in terms}} of their dependencies <b>on</b> <b>success</b> or failure. The first option is that, India can opt to stay with the first stage reactors as long as the global supply of uranium lasts. The plus side of this is that it covers any risk from short term delays or failures in implementing the three-stage programme. On the negative side, this is an option that is antithetical to the underlying objective of energy independence through the exploitation of thorium.|$|E

25|$|Eventually a {{decision}} was made which would influence the next 50 years of the Port Adelaide Football Club with Foster Neil Williams, a brilliant rover from West Adelaide, being appointed captain-coach of the club. Williams brought to the club a new coaching style based <b>on</b> <b>success</b> at any cost which was succinctly encapsulated in the legendary club creed he eventually wrote in 1962. During his second season as coach in 1951, Williams led Port to their first official premiership (excluding World War II competition) for 9 seasons, defeating North Adelaide by 11 points. At the end of the 1951 season the VFL premiers Geelong visited South Australia to play the local premiers Port Adelaide on Adelaide Oval. Geelong won the match 8.14 (62) to 6.18 (54) in front of 25,000 people. Port Adelaide would make the Grand Final again in 1953 against local rivals West Torrens in what would be the Eagles last appearance before merging with Woodville. West Torrens would disappoint Port Adelaide, winning the 1953 premiership by 7 points.|$|E

500|$|Although Success {{was badly}} damaged and drifting, the delay had allowed Nelson's {{flagship}} Foudroyant under Captain Sir Edward Berry and Northumberland under Captain George Martin {{to come up}} to Généreux by 16:30. Foudroyant fired two shots at the French warship, at which point the demoralised French officers fired a single broadside at the approaching British ships and then surrendered, at 5:30. The remaining French ships had escaped seawards and eventually reached Toulon, while the British squadron consolidated their prizes and returned to Keith off Toulon. British losses in the engagement were one man killed and nine wounded, all <b>on</b> <b>Success,</b> while French losses were confined to Perrée alone, who died of his wounds in the evening. Perrée's death was met by a mixed response in the British squadron: some regretted his death as [...] "a gallant and capable man", while others considered him [...] "lucky to have redeemed his honour" [...] for violating his parole after being captured the previous year.|$|E
500|$|The {{player is}} awarded points for {{correctly}} hitting notes, chords and sustains. The player can also increase a score multiplier by playing {{a series of}} consecutive notes successfully. A [...] "Rock Meter" [...] tracks the player's performance based <b>on</b> <b>success</b> or failure of hitting notes, and if the meter drops too low the song will prematurely end in failure for the player. The player can also earn [...] "Star Power" [...] by playing a series of glowing notes perfectly and using the whammy bar during sustains. Once the Star Power meter is filled at least halfway, Star Power can then be activated by briefly tilting the guitar controller vertically, or by pressing a specific button on a standard controller. Activating Star Power will double the scoring multiplier and {{makes it easier to}} increase the Rock Meter by playing correct notes. Thus, players can strategically use Star Power to play through difficult sections of a song they might have otherwise failed.|$|E
500|$|At {{daylight}} on 18 February, lookouts on Alexander sighted the French convoy sailing {{along the}} Maltese coast towards Valletta and gave chase, with Nelson's three ships visible to seawards. At 08:00 the transport Ville de Marseille was overhauled, and surrendered to Lieutenant Harrington's ship, {{but the other}} smaller vessels hauled up at 13:30 and made out to sea, led by Badine. Généreux was unable to follow as {{to do so would}} bring the French ship into action with Alexander, and instead bore up, holding position. This station prevented Alexander from easily coming into action, but gave Captain Peard <b>on</b> <b>Success</b> an opportunity to close with the French ship, bringing his small vessel across the ship of the line's bow and opening a heavy fire. Peard was able to get off several broadsides against Perrée's ship before the French officers managed to turn their vessel to fire on the frigate, inflicting severe damage to Peard's rigging and masts. By this stage however, Perrée was no longer in command: a shot from the first broadside had thrown splinters into his left eye, temporarily blinding him. Remaining on deck, he called to his crew [...] "Ce n'est rien, mes amis, continuons notre besogne" [...] ("It is nothing, my friends, continue with your work") and gave orders for the ship to be turned, when a cannonball from the second broadside from Success tore his right leg off at the thigh. Perrée collapsed uncounscious on the deck.|$|E

Pauline Kael found his performances so powerful that she believed he [...] "often seems to take over a picture even when he isn't in the lead". The journal Films and Filming, surveying his career in 1971, noted that his talent [...] "developed steadily through films good and bad", and that the secret of his success was that he stayed grounded, citing a 1956 interview where he said [...] "I pity the player who can't keep his feet on the ground.

This focus <b>on</b> <b>success,</b> in combination with the common Asian cultural value of family honor, helps explain the high educational successes seen by second generation Asian immigrants.
