Variation of yarn tension between different knitting tools causes different loop length <b>of</b> <b>stitches</b> duration knitting process. In this research, a new intelligent method is applied to control loop length <b>of</b> <b>stitches</b> in various tools based on ideal shape <b>of</b> <b>stitches</b> and real angle <b>of</b> <b>stitches</b> direction while different loop length <b>of</b> <b>stitches</b> causes stitches deformation and deviation those of angle. To measure deviation <b>of</b> <b>stitch</b> direction against variation of tensions, image processing technique was applied to pictures of different fabrics with constant front light. After that, the rate of deformation is translated to needed compensation of loop length cam degree to cure stitches deformation. A fuzzy control algorithm was applied to loop length modification in knitting tools. The presented method was experienced for different knitted fabrics of various structures and yarns. The results show that presented method is useable for control of loop length variation between different knitting tools based on stitch deformation for various knitted fabrics with different fabric structures, densities and yarn types...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation has}} been conducted {{to determine the effect}} <b>of</b> <b>stitching</b> on the static and fatigue failure load of bonded composite single lap joints. The variables considered in the static tests included adherend thickness, overlap length, stitch spacing, and number <b>of</b> rows <b>of</b> <b>stitches.</b> A limited fatigue program was conducted for one configuration to compare the fatigue life <b>of</b> <b>stitched</b> and unstitched joints. Up to a 38 percent improvement in static failure load and an order of magnitude increase in fatigue life compared with unstiffened results are obtained by a single row <b>of</b> <b>stitches</b> {{near the end of the}} overlap. Additional rows <b>of</b> <b>stitching</b> or different stitch spacing has little effect on static joint failure load. Thicker adherends and larger overlap length result in larger improvements in static failure load with stitching.

40|$|According to experiments, the bending {{behaviour}} of a pipe {{is characterized by}} its global elastic-plastic(hardening-softening) bending moment-curvature constitutive equation which depends on the interaction between its material properties and the <b>ovalization</b> <b>of</b> the cross-section when it is subjected to large plastic deformation. In the context of dynamic structural plasticity, this behaviour should {{have an important role}} in problems such as pipe-whip. This paper presents the results of a study of the dynamic response of a tubular cantilever beam which possesses such hardening-softening behaviour in the plastic range. With the help of a numerical approach based on a small deflection formulation, three examples are given. The first example which utilizes parameters selected from a typical pipe-whip test is compared with experimental data and gives a good prediction of the degree <b>of</b> <b>ovalization</b> <b>of</b> the cross-section, the distribution of plastic work in the pipe and the instantaneous deformation of the pipe. Additional examples consider various pulse loadings and constitutive relations to demonstrate that the evolution of softening can undergo three stages, viz. initial softening of one cross-section, growth of the softening region and finally shrinking of the softening region to a particular cross-section which exhibits a sharp localization of the bending deformation...|$|R

5000|$|The most {{difficult}} part of flat medallion knitting is increasing or decreasing at just the right rate. The circumference [...] of a circle is related to its radius [...] by the formula [...] Therefore, the number <b>of</b> <b>stitches</b> [...] in a row at radius [...] must exactly equal that circumference times the stitch gauge, if the medallion is to lie flat. If the number <b>of</b> <b>stitches</b> is fewer than this, the medallion will cup at its edges, forming a spherical bowl; if the number <b>of</b> <b>stitches</b> exceeds this, the medallion will frill at its edges, forming ruffles. Therefore, one should measure the radius regularly as the medallion is being knitted and determine the number <b>of</b> <b>stitches</b> that need to be increased or decreased in each round. Of course, these increases or decreases should be spread evenly around the circumference.|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{elucidate}} the predisposing factors and clinical characteristics {{related to the}} occurrence <b>of</b> <b>stitch</b> abscess after surgery in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Patients and Methods: The subjects were 232 patients who underwent excision and/or reconstruction and/or neck dissection for oral SCC using silk sutures for high ligation of the blood vessels. Detection rates and characteristics <b>of</b> patients with <b>stitch</b> abscess were retrospectively evaluated by comparing patients with and without stitch abscesses after surgery diagnosed by ultrasonography and findings of various modalities in 232 patients. Several echogenic dots with subtle acoustic shadows in a hypoechoic mass were identified as the characteristic findings <b>of</b> <b>stitch</b> abscess on US. The patient groups with and without stitch abscess were compared with respect to various factors to identify those that predispose to the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>stitch</b> abscess. The factors analyzed included patients' sex and age, chemotherapy treatment, radiotherapy treatment, {{the presence of a}} history of allergy, and blood test results. Results: A significant correlation was found between the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>stitch</b> abscess and age, liver function abnormalities on blood tests, and the presence of a history <b>of</b> allergy. Multiple <b>stitch</b> abscesses clearly tended to occur more often than single ones in patients with stitch abscess. Conclusions: The occurrence <b>of</b> <b>stitch</b> abscesses was related to age, liver dysfunction, and/or the presence of allergies.

40|$|The effect <b>of</b> <b>stitching</b> {{parameters}} on the puncture resistance {{properties of}} high strength fabric system was investigated. There are three objectives in this study; {{to investigate the}} effect <b>of</b> <b>stitching</b> patterns on the puncture resistance properties of the high strength fabric system, to investigate the effect <b>of</b> <b>stitch</b> density on the puncture resistance properties of the high strength fabric system, and to suggest the mechanism of penetration of the high strength fabric system. Four types <b>of</b> <b>stitching</b> patterns used in this study;vertical, diagonal, square and diamond stitched patterns. The samples were stitched with the nylon thread in two types <b>of</b> <b>stitch</b> density; 4 stitch/em and 8 stitch/em. The puncture resistance test was conducted and the conical shape probe {{was used in the}} test. The probe moved downward at 100 mrnlmin and stopped automatically when the maximum puncture load achieved. The results showed that diagonal, vertical and unstitch patterns gave much highest puncture resistance performance. Fabrics that were stitched with high stitch density offer higher puncture load value from 2 -layer to 4 -layer. There is a possibility of fabric slippage on the 5 -layer and 6 -layer fabric because the fabric samples became thicker and the clamping gap increased. The shape of the probe also contributed to the mechanism of penetration. The conical probe was able to push aside the principal yams. The sharp tip of the conical probe stretched the fibers and the stitch yams, break the fibers and stitch yarns, and then penetrate into the fabric. The local yam rupture was the fabric failure mode in this study. The puncture resistance of the high strength fabric system is dependent upon the number of fabric layers, types <b>of</b> <b>stitching</b> patterns, and the number <b>of</b> <b>stitch</b> density used to the fabric syste...|$|R
