2500|$|<b>The</b> {{radiation}} pattern <b>of</b> <b>the</b> feed antenna {{has to be}} tailored to <b>the</b> shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dish,</b> {{because it has a}} strong influence on the aperture efficiency, which determines the antenna gain (see Gain section below). [...] Radiation from the feed that falls outside <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dish</b> is called [...] "spillover" [...] and is wasted, reducing the gain and increasing the backlobes, possibly causing interference or (in receiving antennas) increasing susceptibility to ground noise. [...] However, maximum gain is only achieved when <b>the</b> <b>dish</b> is uniformly [...] "illuminated" [...] with a constant field strength to its edges. [...] So the ideal {{radiation pattern}} of a feed antenna would be a constant field strength throughout <b>the</b> solid angle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dish,</b> dropping abruptly to zero at the edges. [...] However, practical feed antennas have radiation patterns that drop off gradually at the edges, so the feed antenna is a compromise between acceptably low spillover and adequate illumination. [...] For most front feed horns, optimum illumination is achieved when the power radiated by the feed horn is 10 dB less at <b>the</b> <b>dish</b> edge than its maximum value at <b>the</b> center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dish.</b>|$|R

25|$|Food {{and drink}} is very {{important}} to the culture of the people of Benghazi, {{as it is in the}} rest of Libya. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dishes</b> and ingredients used are passed down as tradition from generation to generation.

These products are natural to this area, and these ingredients are very common to much of North Africa and the Mediterranean. Another tradition of Libyan culinary culture is tea. Tea from Benghazi has a uniquely thick, bitter taste. Tea drinking is a social activity that close friends and relatives usually take part in.|$|E

Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dishes</b> prepared on festive occasions include puri, lapsee, potaya, dudh-plag, and dhakanu.

25|$|The cuisine of Mizoram {{differs from}} that of most of India, though it shares {{characteristics}} to other regions of Northeast India and North India. Rice is the staple food of Mizoram, while Mizos love to add non-vegetarian ingredients in every dish. Fish, chicken, pork and beef are popular meats among Mizos. Dishes are served on fresh banana leaves. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dishes</b> are cooked in mustard oil. Meals tend to be less spicy than in most of India. Mizos love eating boiled vegetables along with rice. A popular dish is bai, made from boiling vegetables (spinach, eggplant, beans, and other leafy vegetables) with bekang fermented soya beans or Sa-um, a fermented pork and served with rice. Sawhchiar is another common dish, made of rice and cooked with pork or chicken.|$|E

In addition to The Bahamas, conch is also eaten in the West Indies (Jamaica in particular); locals in Jamaica eat conch in soups, stews and curries. Restaurants {{all over the}} islands serve this particular meat. In the Dominican Republic, Grenada, and Haiti, conch is commonly eaten in curries or in a spicy soup. It is locally referred to as lambi. In The Turks and Caicos Islands, the Annual Conch Festival is held in November each year, located at the Three Queen's Bar/Restautant in Blue Hills. Local restaurateurs compete for {{the best and most}} original conch dishes, that are then judged by international chefs. Free sampling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dishes</b> follows the judging; along with those festivities, other competitions, events, and music performances occur well into the evening. In Puerto Rico, conch is served as a ceviche, often called ensalada de carrucho (conch salad), consisting of raw conch marinated in lime juice, olive oil, vinegar, garlic, green peppers, and onions. It is also used to fill empanadas.|$|E
25|$|Manipuri cuisine is {{represented}} by the cuisine of the Meitei people who form the majority population in the central plain. Meitei food are simple, tasty, organic and healthy. Rice with local seasonal vegetables and fish form the main diet. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dishes</b> are cooked like vegetable stew, flavored with either fermented fish called ngari, or dried and smoked fish. The most popular manipuri dish is the iromba; it's a preparation of boiled and mashed vegetables, often including potatoes or beans, mixed with chilli and roasted fermented fish. Another popular dish is the savory cake called Paknam, made of a base of lentil flour stuffed with various ingredients such as banana inflorescence, mushrooms, fish, vegetables etc., and baked covered in turmeric leaves. Along with spicy dishes, a mild side dish of steamed or boiled sweet vegetables are often served in the daily meals. The manipuri salad dish called singju, made of finely julienned cabbage, green papaya, and other vegetables, and garnished with local herbs, toasted sesame powder and lentil flour is extremely popular locally, and often found sold in small street side vendors. Singju is often served with bora which are fritters of various kinds, and also kanghou, or oil fried spicy veggies. Cooked and fermented soybean is a popular condiment in all manipuri kitchens.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{some simple}} calculations of a 2 D {{model of a}} telescope {{in order to understand}} how different design parameters affect the design. For <b>the</b> design <b>of</b> a telescope it is assumed that they need a design that minimizes deflections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dish</b> and also minimizes <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> motors and torques needed to rotate in elevation. A common belief is that a lighter dish and minimum counterweight is desirable. However, these calculations show this is not necessarily true. The torque needed for rotation depends on <b>the</b> moment <b>of</b> inertia and if the telescope is balanced about the elevation axis. A light dish with no CW requires that the elevation axis be several meters in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dish</b> (8 - 9 m) in order to be balanced. This is not practical from a structural point <b>of</b> view. If <b>the</b> elevation axis is only 2 m in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dish</b> and there is no counterweight then the telescope will be unbalanced and the toruqes required will be very high - much higher than the torques needed only to overcome inertia. A heavy dish though can act as its own counterweight and the elevation axis only has to be 2 - 3 m in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dish</b> in order to achieve a balanced telescope. Also the struts that support the camera from <b>the</b> <b>dish</b> place a load on <b>the</b> <b>dish</b> which will put a bending moment on <b>the</b> <b>dish.</b> This bending moment will deform <b>the</b> <b>dish</b> and require it to be stiffer. A counterweight structure performs two functions. First, it allows the telescope to be balanced about the elevation axis. Second, it applies a force on <b>the</b> <b>dish</b> that opposes <b>the</b> forces from the camera struts, thereby reducing the bending moment and deformations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dish...</b>|$|R
