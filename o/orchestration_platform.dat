The arrival of the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) promises helping service providers to deploy a complete array of services on real-time, customized business and consumer multimedia services over any access network. This project describes a new service plain for IMS to give support to the service development. This new service plain is a new platform, the <b>orchestration</b> <b>platform,</b> offered by the network operator to allow the easy development of new and complex services for professional and nonprofessional developers, and to provide a better time-to-market.

40|$|Realizing Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud {{requires}} a control platform for orchestrating the provisioning, configuration, management and decommissioning of a distributed set of diverse cloud resources (i. e., compute, storage, network) serving different clients. Cloud resource orchestration is challenging {{due to the}} rapid growth of data centers, the high failure rate of commodity hardware, the enforcement of service and engineering rules, the increasing sophistication of cloud services, and the requirement to fulfill provider operational objectives and customer service level agreements (SLAs). ^ Towards addressing these challenges, this dissertation makes following contributions: (1) An automated resource <b>orchestration</b> <b>platform</b> that allows cloud operators to declaratively specify optimization goals and constraints given provider operational objectives and customer SLAs. Based on these specifications, orchestration commands are automatically generated to optimize resource configurations and allocations within the cloud; (2) A highly available transactional resource <b>orchestration</b> <b>platform</b> for building IaaS cloud infrastructures. Transactional orchestration procedures automatically guarantee atomicity, consistency, isolation and durability (ACID) properties for cloud operations. Transactional semantics provide a clean abstraction which enables cloud operators to focus on developing high level cloud services without worrying about the complexities of accessing and managing underlying volatile distributed resources. ^ We present the design and implementation of our transactional automated cloud <b>orchestration</b> <b>platform.</b> Using realistic scenarios and workloads derived from production cloud services, we demonstrate that our platform is able to automatically orchestrate compute, storage, and network resources within and across geographically distributed data centers to meet operational objectives and SLAs. ...|$|E

It will {{have a significant impact on}} companies with the introduction of <b>orchestration</b> <b>platforms</b> as a Service (OaaS) to perform the services that support a variety of business processes such as BPEL. It's becoming an adoptable technology for many of the organizations, thanks to its flexibility and because it reduces total cost of ownership. Thus, an effective OaaS must meet several requests simultaneously; ensuring scalability and optimizing the use of shared resources in order to minimize energy consumption. In this paper, we will investigate three issues i) exploiting the minimum of resources to execute a maximum number of processes, ii) Preventing possible overload to the server, and iii) minimizing dynamic energy consumption which becomes one of the main challenges for large-scale computing, such as in cloud data center. As a solution for these challenges, we propose to use Workflow partitioning technique and this based on temporal dynamic reconfiguration approach. Our work aims to reduce the dynamic energy consumption; especially in communication buffers between partitions of BPEL process during partitioning. The proposed approach is based on two main steps: 1) Estimate the energy consumption of BPEL processes 2) Temporal and dynamic partitioning of BPEL process based on reconfigurable architecture in order to minimize overall energy consumption on each BPEL process...|$|R

Geographically distributed DCs interconnection requires automatic and more dynamic provisioning and deletion of end-to-end (E 2 E) connectivity services, through heterogeneous network domains. Each network domain may use a different data transport technology but also a different control/management system. The fast development of Software Defined Networking (SDN) and the interworking with current control plane technologies such as Generalized Multi-protocol Label Switching (GMPLS), demand orchestration over the heterogeneous control instances to provide seamless E 2 E connectivity services to external applications (i. e.

40|$|Cloud {{computing}} is revolutionizing the IT {{industry by}} enabling access to infrastructure, platform and applications as services. Due {{to the vast}} diversity of existing IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) and PaaS (Platform as a Service) clouds, the development and execution of contemporary cloud-based applications is significantly hindered. Therefore, {{the goal of this}} thesis is to design a reference model for the integration of infrastructure- and platform-level clouds, which we structure into three models: (1) architectural model of IaaS, (2) model for cloud-specific enrichment of contemporary container-based platforms and (3) model for compensation handling in cloud orchestrators. There is an evident deficiency of mechanisms for analysis, comparison and evaluation of IaaS cloud implementations, since no unified taxonomy or reference architecture is available. In this article, we propose an architectural model of IaaS, which consists of a unified taxonomy and an IaaS architectural framework. We survey various IaaS systems and map them onto our taxonomy to evaluate the classification. We then introduce an IaaS architectural framework that relies on the unified taxonomy. We provide detailed description of each layer and define dependencies between the layers and components. Finally, we evaluate the proposed IaaS architectural framework on several real-world projects, while performing a comprehensive analysis of the most important commercial and open-source IaaS products. The evaluation results show notable distinction of feature support and capabilities between commercial and open-source IaaS platforms, significant deficiency of important architectural components in terms of fulfilling true promise of infrastructure clouds, and real-world usability of the proposed taxonomy and architectural framework. Elasticity and cloud-control are two most important aspects that have to be addressed in order to seamlessly run applications in IaaS and PaaS clouds. Hence, we have investigated elasticity and cloud-control capabilities of contemporary container-based platforms. We have design a model for cloud-specific enrichment of contemporary container-based platforms, while defining a generic parameter system for executing applications in IaaS and PaaS clouds, which we have structured around two parameter groups: control parameters and elasticity parameters. Both groups present platform-independent parameters, which we use to derive platform-specific programming directives and policies, thus achieving cloud-specific enrichment with deficient elasticity and cloud-control capabilities. We have shown that applying such metadata system to Java EE platform provides application administrators and application developers with greater control and manageability of their application. Cloud orchestration {{is one of the most}} important mechanisms of a successful application deployment in the cloud. Cloud orchestration describes the automated arrangement, coordination, and management of complex cloud systems, middleware and services, and is realized by orchestrating workflows. To enable reliable and fault-tolerant cloud orchestration, it is important to establish an effective compensation handling mechanism. In fact, compensation handling principles have so far not been included in cloud <b>orchestration</b> <b>platforms</b> and had to be performed manually, by implementing the reversal operations of already completed activities in one of the upstream activities or within an error handler, thus preventing workflow designers to compose more error-prone workflows in an efficient way. In this paper we introduce a model for compensation handling support in cloud orchestrators while performing an architectural analysis of existing cloud-specific workflow systems, defining a generic approach for compensation handling applicable to cloud orchestrators, and proposing a novel algorithm called Compensation Activities Search (CAS) for traversing a cloud orchestration workflow and finding appropriate activities to be compensated. Finally, we present a use case of adapting BPMN 2. 0 to orchestrate cloud-specific tasks and develop a proof of concept system to show the effectiveness and feasibility of our proposed approach. Key results of the dissertation are (1) an architectural model of IaaS, which defines a unified taxonomy and an IaaS architectural framework, provides detailed description of each layer and defines dependencies between the layers and components, (2) a model for cloud-specific enrichment of contemporary container-based platforms, which investigates elasticity and cloud-control capabilities of contemporary container-based platforms and defines a generic parameter system for executing applications in IaaS and PaaS clouds, and (3) a model for compensation handling support in cloud orchestrators, which performs an architectural analysis cloud orchestrators, defines a generic approach for compensation handling applicable to cloud orchestrators, and introduces a novel algorithm CAS for traversing a cloud orchestration workflow.

In order to reproduce distributed experiments, researchers need to perform complex deployments which involve many dependent software stacks with many configurations and manual orchestrations. Further, researchers need to allocate a larger {{amount of money}} for clusters of machines and then spend their valuable time to perform those experiments. Also, some of the researchers {{spend a lot of}} time to validate a distributed scenario in a real environment as most of the pseudo distributed systems do not provide the characteristics of a real distributed system. Karamel provides solutions for the inconvenience caused by the manual orchestration by providing a comprehensive <b>orchestration</b> <b>platform</b> to deploy and run distributed experiments. But still, this solution may incur a similar amount of expenses as of a manual distributed setup since it uses virtual machines underneath. Further, it does not provide quick validations of a distributed setup with a quick feedback loop, as it takes considerable time to terminate and provision new virtual machines. Therefore, we provide a solution by integrating Docker that can co-exists with virtual machine based deployment model seamlessly. Our solution encapsulates the container-based deployment model for users to reproduce distributed experiment in a cost-effective and efficient manner. In this project, we introduce novel deployment model with containers that is not possible with the conventional virtual machine based deployment model. Further, we evaluate our solution with a real deployment of Apache Hadoop Terasort experiment which is a benchmark for Apache Hadoop map-reduce platform in order to explain how this model can be used to save the cost and improve the efficiency. ...|$|E

40|$|International {{audience}} 5 G is {{the next}} generation mobile network that enables innovation and supports progressive change across all vertical industries and across our society. Through its Radio Access Network (RAN) design and its orchestrated end-to-end architecture, {{it has the potential}} to boost innovation and generate economic growth in the European economy. The 5 G service models support agility and dynamicity, thereby impacting the granularity, duration and trustworthiness of business relationships. The ability to combine private and public networks and data centres across multiple domains in a secure and controlled way facilitates collaborative business processes. It reshapes the digital business ecosystem with new value chains linking stakeholders from the telecommunications world and the vertical industries in win-win situations. New stakeholders emerge in this evolved ecosystem, for example cloud companies and software houses that profit from the cloudification and virtualization of the infrastructure, and brokers that facilitate sharing of spectrum and trading of connectivity and processing resources. Small and medium-sized enterprises and start-ups are able to embed 5 G in their innovative products and services for existing and new customers and markets, leveraging on the Anything as a Service (XaaS) model. These opportunities are conditioned by the ability of 5 G architecture and technologies to deliver the performance levels required for vertical industry stakeholders to engage in the 5 G digital business ecosystem. This white paper highlights the technological innovations of the first phase of the 5 G Public Private Partnership (5 G PPP) and how they contribute to the key performance targets for the 5 G service classes: enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC), and massive Machine Type Communications (mMTC). The performance levels ensure an unprecedented experience for end users including high data rates, reduced end-to-end latency, massive connectivity, ultra-reliability and support for very high mobility. The 5 G PPP innovations go far beyond what is announced for early 5 G deployments. For eMBB service, the integration of mm-wave and frequencies below 6 GHz, along with ultra-dense networks and nomadic nodes, ensure the targeted performance levels with ubiquitous coverage and in high mobility scenarios, in contrast with standalone deployments of mm-wave networks, suitable for fixed usage. The innovations related to the transport network allow also translating the peak throughputs available at the air interface into perceived user experience at affordable deployment cost for operators. In addition to this, the envisioned 5 G air interface serves simultaneously all service classes (eMBB, mMTC and URLLC) in a cost effective way, paving the way for new business opportunities with and for verticals. The 5 G concept developed in this paper is not limited to the RAN; it covers the end-to-end path and allows the 5 G network to act as a secure, reliable and flexible <b>orchestration</b> <b>platform</b> across multiple domains. The 5 G PPP innovations converge towards the vision of 5 G as a holistic <b>orchestration</b> <b>platform</b> that integrates networking, computing and storage resources into one programmable and unified infrastructure. The 5 G PPP innovations on multi-domain orchestration enable quick end-to-end service deployment and dynamic sharing of networking and processing resources among stakeholders. The 5 G security architecture is built on a baseline trust model as a fundamental feature, and provides tools to analyse trust and make it explicit in specific scenarios. The 5 G architecture ensures resilience of the network against attacks and its availability during failure incidents. Availability and reliability are achieved by mechanisms such as error recovery, fault detection and fault resolution. These security, reliability and flexibility properties, along with the multi-service air interface, ensure that the 5 G network is not just an enhanced air interface as for pre- 5 G early deployments, announced for the period 2018 - 2020, but also an open platform for new business opportunities. The architecture and protocols are designed to adapt to a wide range of deployment scenarios including deep indoor, hot spots, urban areas, rural areas, maritime areas and in an aeronautical context. The 5 G concept combines various access technologies, such as cellular, wireless, satellite and wireline, for delivering reliable performance for critical communications and improve area coverage. Standardization and spectrum regulation are critical elements for avoiding fragmentation of future deployments and increasing efficiency by eliminating redundant options. Spectrum regulation must ensure the early availability of a limited number of frequency bands, which eases the development of the necessary equipment and facilitates faster preparation of tests and trials. As of standardization, 5 G PPP projects contribute to 5 G standards development by building consensus among European industry, leading to individual and concerted actions towards standardization bodies. In contrast to early announcements of 5 G deployments, the 5 G results are aligned with the standardization trends in 3 GPP, ensuring a global impact of European 5 G innovations. Once the first 5 G standards are released and the frequency bands are available, deployments of 5 G networks will start, adopting cost efficient upgrade paths building on existing 4 G infrastructure. Networking and processing resource sharing strategies between stakeholders can be implemented for delivering the performance targets, e. g. for URLLC use cases, at an affordable cost. This resource sharing/integration is enabled by the multi-domain orchestration advocated by 5 G PPP projects and aim at achieving win-win situations for all the stakeholders involved in the 5 G service. Regulation must facilitate such flexibility in infrastructure sharing in order to foster the development of the 5 G digital business ecosystem...|$|E
