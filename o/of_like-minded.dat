5|$|In 1976, Reagan {{challenged}} incumbent President Gerald Ford {{in a bid}} {{to become}} the Republican Party's candidate for president. Reagan soon established himself as the conservative candidate with the support <b>of</b> <b>like-minded</b> organizations such as the American Conservative Union, which became key components of his political base, while Ford was considered a more moderate Republican.|$|E
5|$|Beaumont {{was fully}} {{involved}} in the political crises that punctuated the reign of Henry VI: Griffiths has labelled him one of 'a small group <b>of</b> <b>like-minded</b> men, led by Suffolk' who could work for the king whether in council or on royal progress, although his attendance at council seems to have become more sporadic by 1443. As Steward of England, he personally- although accompanied by, for example, other lords such as Buckingham and the earl of Salisbury- arrested Humphrey, duke of Gloucester for treason, in Bury St Edmunds 18 February 1447.|$|E

Reagan soon established himself as the conservative candidate with the support <b>of</b> <b>like-minded</b> organizations such as the American Conservative Union which became key components of his political base, while President Ford was considered a more moderate Republican. Though Reagan lost the Republican nomination, he received 307 write-in votes in New Hampshire, 388 votes as an Independent on Wyoming's ballot, and a single electoral vote from a faithless elector in the November election from the state of Washington, which Ford had won over Democratic challenger Jimmy Carter. Ford ultimately lost the general election to Carter.|$|E

5|$|The band Pylon was {{a long-standing}} and {{influential}} {{part of the}} Athens scene, and became critical darlings in the 1980s, but never achieved significant mainstream success. This was partially because they eschewed several record contracts from the major labels {{due to a lack}} of trust in their corporate goodwill. Pylon's dance rock style was not very accessible or commercial, and was accompanied grating, chanting-style vocals, funky guitars and bass-heavy beats. Other 1980s local bands with nationwide alternative followings included Love Tractor, Oh-OK, with Michael Stipe's sister Lynda Stipe, vocalist Linda Hopper (later of Magnapop) and future solo performer Matthew Sweet, Dreams So Real. The members of R.E.M. have remained fixtures in Athens as they have also become international stars, helping out local performers like Vic Chesnutt, the Chickasaw Mudd Puppies and Jack Logan. The Elephant 6 Collective, a group <b>of</b> <b>like-minded</b> indie bands, gained limited nationwide exposure starting in the mid-1990s with the rise of Neutral Milk Hotel, Elf Power and Olivia Tremor Control. The same period saw the Kindercore Records roster find critical acclaim, including the bands Sunshine Fix, Masters of the Hemisphere, Japancakes, Love Tractor, Gresham Disco and Of Montreal. Candy, a DJ store owned by Michael Lachowski of Pylon, opened in 1998; the store became an important part of the burgeoning dance music scene that produced Danger Mouse, Phungus and DJ 43.|$|E

Inspired by Weston's show at the De Young Museum the previous year, they approached the museum with the idea of mounting a group exhibition of their work. They named themselves Group f/64, and in November, 1932, an exhibition of 80 of their prints opened at the museum. The show was a critical success.|$|E
25|$|An {{innovator}} {{among the}} Romanian communist intellectual and professional elite, Murgescu spent his final decades questioning {{the assumptions of}} Marxian economics. At the Institute for World Economy, which later became {{a branch of the}} Romanian Academy, he trained a new generation <b>of</b> <b>like-minded</b> economists. Shortly before his death, he was involved in dissidence against the Nicolae Ceaușescu regime. Although he did not live long enough to witness the 1989 Revolution, he played an indirect part in shaping the economic policies to which the country turned in post-communism.|$|E
25|$|Díaz {{came from}} a devoutly Catholic family; his uncle, José Agustín, was bishop of Oaxaca. Díaz had trained for the priesthood, and it seemed likely that was his career path. Oaxaca was a center of liberalism, and the {{founding}} of the Institute of Arts and Sciences, a secular institution, helped foster professional training for Oaxacan liberals, including Benito Juárez and Porfirio Díaz. Díaz was a Freemason, which did not necessarily put him at odds with the Catholic Church, but did give him access to a secret brotherhood <b>of</b> <b>like-minded</b> ambitious men.|$|E

25|$|The TPA's {{plans were}} opposed by {{neighbouring}} residents and community associations who together formed the Community Air {{special interest group}} to fight the expansion. The expansion became a primary issue in the 2003 Toronto municipal election. Mayoral candidates Barbara Hall and John Tory supported the bridge and David Miller opposed it. Miller and a slate <b>of</b> <b>like-minded</b> candidates for council ran on a common platform, the centrepiece of which was to stop the bridge. After Miller was elected Mayor in November 2003, the new council voted to cancel the previous Council's decision, stopping the bridge project.|$|E
25|$|Doughty knew {{almost from}} the {{beginning}} of her work in the death industry that she wanted to change attitudes about death, {{and find a way to}} offer alternative funeral arrangements. After one year at the crematory, Doughty attended Cypress College's mortuary science program, and graduated as a licensed mortician, though in California she could have obtained a license by passing a test without attending mortuary college. She founded The Order of the Good Death, an association <b>of</b> <b>like-minded</b> death professionals, along with artists, writers, and academics who shared her goals of reforming Western attitudes about death, funerals, and mourning.|$|E
25|$|The 1890s saw the {{emergence}} of a loosely connected group <b>of</b> <b>like-minded</b> radical artists who would later become known as the Birmingham Group. All had studied at the Birmingham School of Art after the reorganisation of its teaching methods by Edward R. Taylor in the 1880s, and all had been deeply imbued with the philosophy and practices of the Arts and Crafts Movement, of which they were to become leading exponents. Many went on to teach at the school and become associated with other more formal organisations such as the Birmingham Guild of Handicraft or the Bromsgrove Guild.|$|E

25|$|Porter {{worked to}} raise the {{standards}} of the U.S. Navy in the position of Superintendent of the Naval Academy when it was restored to Annapolis. He initiated reforms in the curriculum to increase professionalism. In the early days of President Grant's administration, Porter was de facto Secretary of the Navy. When his adoptive brother David G. Farragut was advanced from rank of vice-admiral to admiral, Porter took his previous position; likewise, when Farragut died, Porter became the second man to hold the newly created rank of admiral. He gathered a corps <b>of</b> <b>like-minded</b> officers devoted to naval reform.|$|E

As a student, he got involved with the cultural wing of the Communist Party of India. Although he never {{became a member of the}} party, his association with the socialist Indian People's Theatre Association brought him close to a number <b>of</b> <b>like-minded</b> culturally associated people.|$|E
25|$|Some {{political}} contention {{exists between}} the traditional nudist and the naturist within the national organizations that represent clothing optional recreation for lobbying purposes. Traditional nudists seek {{to maintain the status}} quo, while the naturists push for designation of more clothing optional beaches and other outdoor facilities. It has been said that naturists tend to be more supportive of public nudity than do nudists, who generally focus more on landed and non-landed clubs. In America, there appears to be more support for mass-nudity, such as the photography/art of Spencer Tunick, while in Europe, there are extended naked walks by individuals and small groups <b>of</b> <b>like-minded</b> people.|$|E
