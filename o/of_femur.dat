25|$|After cabin disintegration, the astronauts' {{bodies were}} {{released}} into the upper atmosphere and battered by extreme aerodynamic forces (close to 14,000 MPH) and temperatures. The remains of the crew then fell some 200,000 feet to earth, where they were also subjected to burning from aerodynamic heating. The official NASA report omitted {{some of the more}} graphic details on the recovery of the remains, however witnesses reported various gruesome finds such as a human heart and parts <b>of</b> <b>femur</b> bones.|$|E
25|$|Holtz {{observed}} that tyrannosaurids had the longest limbs {{relative to their}} body size of any theropod dinosaurs apart from the ostrich dinosaurs and a small, slender ceratosaur called Elaphrosaurus. Although the ostrich dinosaur on average had relatively longer limbs overall, the ratios <b>of</b> <b>femur</b> length {{to the length of}} the tibia and fibula were actually very close between the smaller tyrannosaurs and the largest ostrich dinosaurs. Holtz found ostrich dinosaurs and tyrannosaurs to have other traits of the hindlimb in common as well. Both groups had a pinched third metatarsal, called an arctometatarsus, that strengthened the foot. Holtz concluded that these traits indicated that tyrannosaurids were among the best adapted for running of all carnivorous dinosaurs.|$|E
500|$|Jack Horner and Don Lessem {{argued in}} 1993 that Tyrannosaurus {{was slow and}} {{probably}} could not run (no airborne phase in mid-stride), because its ratio <b>of</b> <b>femur</b> (thigh bone) to tibia (shin bone) length was greater than 1, as in most large theropods and like a modern elephant. Holtz (1998) noted that tyrannosaurids and some closely related groups had significantly longer distal hindlimb components (shin plus foot plus toes) relative to the femur length than most other theropods, and that tyrannosaurids and their close relatives had a tightly interlocked metatarsus that more effectively transmitted locomotory forces from the foot to the lower leg than in earlier theropods ("metatarsus" [...] means the foot bones, which function {{as part of the}} leg in digitigrade animals). He therefore concluded that tyrannosaurids and their close relatives were the fastest large theropods. Thomas Holtz Jr. echoed these sentiments in his 2013 lecture, stating that the giant allosaurs had shorter feet for the same body size than Tyrannosaurus, whereas Tyrannosaurus had longer, skinnier and more interlocked feet for the same body size; attributes of faster moving animals.|$|E

2500|$|Perthes {{disease is}} self-limiting, {{but if the}} head <b>of</b> <b>femur</b> is left deformed, {{long-term}} problems can occur. Treatment is aimed at minimizing damage while the disease runs its course, not at 'curing' the disease. It is recommended not to use steroids or alcohol as these reduce oxygen in the blood which is needed in the joint. As sufferers age, problems in the knee and back can arise secondary to abnormal posture and stride adopted to protect the affected joint. [...] The condition is also linked to arthritis of the hip, though this appears not to be an inevitable consequence. [...] Hip replacements are relatively common as the already damaged hip suffers routine wear; this varies by individual, but generally is required any time after age 50.|$|E
2500|$|Rather {{than using}} the Wiberg angle {{because it makes}} it {{difficult}} to quantify the degree of dislocation they used 3 key elements to determine the degree of subluxation: A reference line at the lower rim of the [...] "teardrop", junction between the femoral head and neck of the respective joint and the height of the pelvis (vertical measurement). They studied anteroposterior pelvic x-rays and drew horizontal lines through the lower rim of a feature called [...] "teardrop". The distance between this line and the middle lines of the junction between femur head and neck gave them a measure of the degree <b>of</b> <b>femur</b> head subluxation. They further established that a [...] "normal" [...] diameter of the femur head measures 20% of the height of the pelvis. [...] If the middle line of the neck-head junction was more than 10% of the pelvis height above the reference line they considered the joint to be more than 50% dislocated.|$|E
2500|$|Osteosarcomas tend {{to occur}} at the sites of bone growth, presumably because {{proliferation}} makes osteoblastic cells in this region prone to acquire mutations {{that could lead to}} transformation of cells (the RB gene and p53 gene are commonly involved). Due to this tendency, high incidence of osteosarcoma is seen in some large dog breeds (St. Bernards and Great Danes). The tumor may be localized {{at the end of the}} long bone (commonly in the metaphysis). Most often it affects the proximal end of tibia or humerus, or distal end <b>of</b> <b>femur.</b> Osteosarcoma tends to affect regions around the knee in 60% of cases, 15% around the hip, 10% at the shoulder, and 8% in the jaw. The tumor is solid, hard, irregular ("fir-tree," [...] "moth-eaten", or [...] "sun-burst" [...] appearance on X-ray examination) due to the tumor spicules of calcified bone radiating in right angles. These right angles form what is known as a Codman triangle, which is characteristic but not diagnostic of osteosarcoma. Surrounding tissues are infiltrated.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Segmentation <b>of</b> <b>femurs</b> in Anterior-Posterior x-ray {{images is}} very {{important}} for fracture detection, computer-aided surgery and surgical planning. Existing methods do not perform well in segmenting bones in x-ray images due to the presence of large amount of spurious edges. This paper presents an atlas-based approach for automatic segmentation <b>of</b> <b>femurs</b> in x-ray images. A robust global alignment method based on consistent sets of edge segments registers the whole atlas to the image under joint constraints. After global alignment, the femur models undergo local refinement to extract detailed contours <b>of</b> the <b>femurs.</b> Test results show that the proposed algorithm is robust and accurate in segmenting the <b>femur</b> contours <b>of</b> different patients. ...|$|R
