5|$|A federal {{government}} is only sensible, for Russell, when it has limited but well-defined powers. Russell advocates the creation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> government made up of sovereign nation-states (Russell 1938:197, 230–31). On his view, the function <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> government should only be to ensure the avoidance {{of war and the}} pursuit of peace (Russell 1938:230-31). On the world stage, democracy would be impossible, because of the negligible power any particular individual could have in comparison with the entire human race.|$|E

5|$|In 1936, Ayer wrote Language, Truth and Logic, {{in which}} he claimed that {{religious}} language is meaningless. He put forward a strong empirical position, arguing that all knowledge must either come from observations of the world or be necessarily true, like mathematical statements. In doing so, he rejected metaphysics, which considers the reality <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> beyond the natural world and science. Because {{it is based on}} metaphysics and is therefore unverifiable, Ayer denounced religious language, as well as statements about ethics or aesthetics, as meaningless. Ayer challenged the meaningfulness of all statements about God– theistic, atheistic and agnostic– arguing that they are all equally meaningless because they all discuss the existence of a metaphysical, unverifiable being.|$|E
