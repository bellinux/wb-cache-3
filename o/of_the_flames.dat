40|$|Abstract: <b>The</b> <b>flame</b> {{recognition}} {{system based}} on video image is applied to <b>the</b> fire <b>flame</b> detection, {{and it can be}} very good to avoid <b>the</b> shortage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> traditional fire <b>flame</b> detection system. Three frame difference algorithm is adopted to extract <b>the</b> motion features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flame.</b> And Lab color space is applied in analyzing <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> color. By analyzing <b>the</b> circular degree <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> and <b>the</b> interference sources, <b>the</b> change rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> area and <b>the</b> angle feature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fire <b>flame,</b> it can be determined whether there is a fire in the image. The experimental results shows: this algorithm can not only effectively improve the accuracy and real-time performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> detection and identification, but also eliminate <b>the</b> interference <b>of</b> other substances and reduce the misjudgment...|$|R

5|$|Exactly 100 {{days after}} the Flames last held a playoff position, they climbed back into the top eight with a 7–0–1 run that culminated in a 3–1 victory over the Chicago Blackhawks. Jokinen tied a {{franchise}} record for points in a period during a February 14 game against the Colorado Avalanche when he scored four {{points in the first}} period of a 9–1 win. The last Flame to accomplish the feat was Al MacInnis in 1991. The victory also marked Kiprusoff's 250th win as a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Flames.</b>|$|E
5|$|Flames radio {{broadcaster}} Peter Maher {{was named}} {{the recipient of the}} Foster Hewitt Memorial Award in 2006 for his years of service as the radio play-by-play announcer for the Calgary Flames.

5|$|Several members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Flames</b> {{organization}} {{have been}} honoured by the Hockey Hall of Fame during the team's history in Calgary. Lanny McDonald {{was the first}} Flame player inducted, gaining election in 1992. McDonald recorded 215 goals in 492 games for the Flames, including a team record 66 goals in 1982–83. He was joined in 2000 by a fellow member of the 1989 Stanley Cup championship team, Joe Mullen. Mullen spent five seasons with the Flames, recording 388 points and capturing two Lady Byng Trophies. Grant Fuhr, elected in 2003, became the third former Flames player to enter the Hall. Fuhr played only one season in Calgary; however, he recorded his 400th career win in a Flames uniform, a victory over the Florida Panthers on October 22, 1999. In 2007, Al MacInnis became the fourth former Flame inducted into the Hall, and the third to earn his Hall of Fame credentials primarily as a Flame. MacInnis was a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Flames</b> from 1981 until 1994. He is best remembered for his booming slapshot, {{as well as for}} winning the Conn Smythe Trophy in 1989 as the most valuable player of playoffs. On June 28, 2011, Joe Nieuwendyk was announced as an inductee to the Hockey Hall of Fame. Nieuwendyk played with the Flames from 1986-1987 until 1994-95. Joe was the team captain from 1991 until he left in '95.|$|E
5|$|Allan MacInnis (born July 11, 1963) is {{a retired}} Canadian ice hockey defenceman who played 23 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Calgary Flames and St. Louis Blues. A first round {{selection}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Flames</b> in the 1981 NHL Entry Draft, {{he went on to}} become a 13-time All-Star. He was named the Conn Smythe Trophy winner as the most valuable player of the playoffs in 1989 after leading the Flames to the Stanley Cup championship. He was voted the winner of the James Norris Memorial Trophy in 1999 as the top defenceman in the league while a member of the Blues. On January 27, 2017, in a ceremony during the All-Star Weekend in Los Angeles, MacInnis was part of the second group of players to be named one of the '100 Greatest NHL Players' in history.|$|E
5|$|Calgary {{struggled}} to a 4–7–2 record in November, losing six {{of their last}} seven road games during the month. However, the team ended the month with its star players playing their best games of the season. Kiprusoff recorded his third shutout {{of the season in}} a 3–0 win against the Minnesota Wild while Iginla scored eight goals and 12 points in the final nine games of the month. Though they sat in 14th place in the 15-team Western Conference, the Flames ended November only five points out of a playoff spot. The organization reached a milestone during the month, as Curtis Glencross scored the 10,000th goal in the history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Flames</b> franchise during a 3–2 victory over the Philadelphia Flyers on November 26.|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} and random electron current in a flame have been measured using a platinum probe. <b>The</b> <b>flame</b> studied {{in this work}} has a cylindrical shape.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transfer function <b>of</b> a ducted, laminar, premixed flame. This transfer function {{is defined as}} <b>the</b> ratio <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fluctuations in <b>flame</b> heat release to the flow velocity modulations at <b>the</b> base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flame.</b> A conical, laminar, propane/air premixed <b>flame</b> stabilised at <b>the</b> rim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> burner and confined in a glass tube is considered. <b>The</b> <b>flame</b> is excited by incident acoustic waves generated by a loud speaker over a range <b>of</b> forcing frequencies. <b>The</b> fluctuations <b>of</b> heat release due to corrugation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> by <b>the</b> acoustic wave is measured using a photo-multiplier tube (PMT) while the flow velocity fluctuation is determined by considering the loud speaker diaphragm motion and assuming conservation of classical acoustic energy within the burner. In keeping with other studies, the results clearly show qualitatively the low-pass filter nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flame.</b> <b>The</b> decay <b>of</b> <b>the</b> amplitude <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> transfer function by increase of forcing frequency is further supported by images <b>of</b> <b>the</b> excited <b>flame...</b>|$|R

5|$|McDonald {{also felt}} the {{pressure}} of having to replace two popular ex-Flames in MacMillan and Lever while also working to overcome a separated shoulder he suffered {{earlier in the year}} with the Rockies. He made his debut with the Flames the following night, a 7–1 victory over the Los Angeles Kings, after which McDonald remarked that it was the most fun he had playing the game in a long time. He was given a loud ovation by the fans who immediately embraced him as a local hero, even though it took him seven games before he scored his first goal as a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Flames.</b> He scored 34goals in Calgary, and combined with the 6 scored in Colorado, finished with his fifth 40-goal campaign in six years.|$|E
5|$|McGrattan was {{a regular}} in the Flames lineup {{throughout}} 2013–14. He set career highs in games played (76), goals (4) and points (8) in a season. He appeared in his 300th NHL game late in the campaign. Though {{best known for his}} fighting skills, McGrattan played a prominent role as a peacekeeper during a January 18, 2014, incident between the Flames and Canucks. Vancouver coach John Tortorella, upset over a line brawl between the two teams {{at the start of the}} game, attempted to accost Calgary's coach Bob Hartley in the hallway between the two teams' locker rooms during the first intermission. McGrattan stepped between Tortorella and members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Flames</b> to ensure that the dispute did not develop into a violent altercation.|$|E
5000|$|A {{turbulent}} premixed flame can {{be assumed}} to propagate as a surface composed of an ensemble of laminar flames {{so long as the}} processes that determine <b>the</b> inner structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> are not affected. Under such conditions, <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> surface is wrinkled by virtue of turbulent motion in the premixed gases increasing <b>the</b> surface area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flame.</b> <b>The</b> wrinkling process increases <b>the</b> burning velocity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> turbulent premixed <b>flame</b> in comparison to its laminar counterpart.|$|R

40|$|Acoustic {{resonances}} in combustion {{systems like}} central heating boilers prohibit further technological advances in these systems. The {{design and construction}} is obstructed by acoustic problems because they are largely misunderstood. <b>The</b> <b>flame</b> often acts as an active element in the acoustic field, because <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> transfer function <b>of</b> acoustic waves has a large amplitude at low frequencies. Current models <b>of</b> <b>the</b> phase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> transfer function <b>of</b> Bunsen-type flames, based on kinematic behavior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> dynamics, completely miss the experimentally observed phase, unless the measured flow field {{is used in the}} model.

5|$|When Rama {{abandons}} {{the young}} Maya Sita at Agni Pariksha, she – {{worried about her}} uncertain future – questions Rama and Agni about what should she do now. They advise {{her to go to}} Pushkar and perform austerities (Tapas) and prophesy that she will be become Svargalakshmi ("Lakshmi of the heaven") as the result of her asceticism. Shiva is pleased with her penance and promises to grant her desired boon. Maya Sita, who is transformed into Svargalakshmi by practising austerities for three lakh years, anxiously repeats five times that she get a husband. Shiva blesses her that she will be born as Draupadi, the princess of Pancala, who will have five husbands. Draupadi, the heroine of the Mahabharata, is born out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flames</b> of a yajna (fire sacrifice) of Drupada (King of Panchala) and later becomes the common wife of the five Pandava brothers, princes of Kuru kingdom. The text also declares that in previous birth, Maya Sita was Vedavati, a woman Ravana tries to rape and who curses Ravana that she will be the cause of his ruin. Since she has taken birth in three yugas (ages; a cycle of four ages is believed to repeat) – Vedavati in Satya yuga, Maya Sita in Treta Yuga and Draupadi in Dwapara yuga, she is known as Trihayani, the one who appears in the three ages.|$|E
5|$|When {{the chorus}} of the song begins, two women pull Gaga out of the bathtub, rip her top {{clothing}} off and force her to drink a glass of vodka. As the second verse begins, Gaga, wearing a diamond-covered outfit topped with a crown, seductively dances {{for a group of}} men bidding for her. She straddles one of the men, played by Slovenian model Jurij Bradač, and performs a lap dance for him. Afterwards, the man raises his bid and becomes the highest bidder for her. When the chorus is played for the third time, Gaga is shown wearing a faux-polar bear hide jacket. She walks towards the man, who is sitting on a bed and unbuttoning his shirt, while drinking a glass of vodka. Gaga has a look of indifference on her face and removes her jacket and sunglasses. Suddenly, the bed spontaneously combusts with the man still sitting on it, and Gaga sings in a sinister way in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flames.</b> The video ends with her lying beside a smoldering skeleton, on top of the destroyed bed, covered in ashes. With soot smeared across her body, she calmly smokes a cigarette while her pyrotechnic bra activates.|$|E

Each frame <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> video clips is processed and <b>the</b> medial axis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> is extracted. <b>The</b> processed medial axes are then superimposed for statistical analysis. The test results show that, although <b>the</b> shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> is randomly fluctuated even under the same combustion condition, some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> statistical shape parameters are relatively stable for the given burner condition. These parameters can be used to indicate <b>the</b> stability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flame...</b>|$|R

40|$|Perfectly spherical and {{cylindrical}} premixed methane/air flames are numerically {{investigated in}} orderto analyze <b>the</b> inner structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flame,</b> <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> propagation, and stretch effects. Three kinds of flames are studied: steady, expanding, and imploding <b>flames.</b> To model <b>the</b> <b>flames</b> in detail, while minimalizing computational costs, a flamelet model {{is adapted to}} the spherical and cylindrical flames in combination with a skeletal reaction mechanism. The expression for <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> stretch rate follows directly from its mass-based definition and is shown to consist of two terms, one due to <b>the</b> propagation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> itself and <b>the</b> other one due to <b>the</b> variation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> thickness.
