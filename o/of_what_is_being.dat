5|$|On 31 October 1517, Luther sent {{a letter}} to Archbishop of Mainz, Albert of Brandenburg, under whose {{authority}} the indulgences were being sold. In the letter, Luther addresses the archbishop out of a loyal desire to alert him to the pastoral problems created by the indulgence sermons. He assumes that Albert is unaware <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>being</b> preached under his authority, and speaks out of concern that the people are being led away from the gospel, and that the indulgence preaching may bring shame to Albert's name. Luther does not condemn indulgences or the current doctrine regarding them, nor even the sermons which had been preached themselves, as he had not seen them firsthand. Instead he states his concern regarding the misunderstandings of the people about indulgences which have been fostered by the preaching, such as the belief that any sin could be forgiven by indulgences or that the guilt as well as the punishment for sin could be forgiven by an indulgence. In a postscript, Luther wrote that Albert could find some theses on the matter enclosed with his letter, so that he could see the uncertainty surrounding the doctrine of indulgences in contrast to the preachers who spoke so confidently of the benefits of indulgences.|$|E

25|$|In some Asian {{television}} programming, captioning {{is considered}} {{a part of the}} genre, and has evolved beyond simply capturing what is being said. The captions are used artistically; it is common to see the words appear one by one as they are spoken, in a multitude of fonts, colors, and sizes that capture the spirit <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>being</b> said. Languages like Japanese also have a rich vocabulary of onomatopoeia which is used in captioning.|$|E

25|$|Defining a German nation {{based on}} {{internal}} characteristics presented difficulties. Since {{the start of}} the Reformation in the 16th century, the German lands had been divided between Catholics and Lutherans and linguistic diversity was large as well. Today, the Swabian, Bavarian, Saxon and Cologne dialects in their most pure forms are estimated to be 40% mutually intelligible with modern Standard German, meaning that in a conversation between a native speaker of any of these dialects and a person who speaks only standard German, the latter will be able to understand slightly less than half <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>being</b> said without any prior knowledge of the dialect, a situation which is likely to have been similar or greater in the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|In the {{beginning}} of the decoding stage a child will often be devoting so much mental capacity to the process of decoding that they will have no comprehension of the meaning of the words being read. This is most likely if the text being read is at or above their skill level. It is nevertheless an important stage. Such decoding practice allows the child to improve their decoding skills with the ultimate goal of becoming automatic as it is for most skilled readers with most text they encounter. Like every skill, the more you do it the better you get. Though comprehension may be poor at this stage, it is nevertheless an important step towards comprehension. As the skill of decoding improves and the more automatic it becomes the more the child has mental capacity to devote to comprehension. Therefore, understanding <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>being</b> read increases.|$|E

25|$|Vision is {{the primary}} sense for humans, but speech {{perception}} is multimodal, which means that it involves information {{from more than one}} sensory modality, in particular, audition and vision. The McGurk effect arises during phonetic processing because the integration of audio and visual information happens early in speech perception. The McGurk effect is very robust; that is, knowledge about it seems to have little effect on one's perception of it. This is different from certain optical illusions, which break down once one 'sees through' them. Some people, including those that have been researching the phenomenon for more than twenty years, experience the effect even when they are aware that it is taking place. With the exception of people who can identify most <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>being</b> said from speech-reading alone, most people are quite limited in their ability to identify speech from visual-only signals. A more extensive phenomenon is the ability of visual speech to increase the intelligibility of heard speech in a noisy environment. Visible speech can also alter the perception of perfectly audible speech sounds when the visual speech stimuli are mismatched with the auditory speech. Normally, speech perception is thought to be an auditory process; however, our use of information is immediate, automatic, and, to a large degree, unconscious and therefore, despite what is widely accepted as true, speech is not only something we hear. Speech is perceived by all of the senses working together (seeing, touching, and listening to a face move). The brain is often unaware of the separate sensory contributions of what it perceives. Therefore, when it comes to recognizing speech the brain cannot differentiate whether it is seeing or hearing the incoming information.|$|E

2500|$|As the {{emergence}} of rock 'n roll music began in the 1950s, Williams left no doubt as to where {{he stood on the}} subject: against. [...] "Most of it's so bad it's embarrassing," [...] he said. [...] "In the days of the big bands, a vocalist {{had to be able to}} sing....I believe teenagers are hungry to hear good music, and at some point we must assume a lot of the blame for the quality <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>being</b> heard. I use the word 'we' to mean disc jockeys and radio stations in general." [...] A well-known advertisement of the era showed Williams holding his nose under the caption [...] "We asked William B. Williams of WNEW Radio what he thought of rock 'n' roll." [...] Still, beginning in the late 1950s, WNEW began mixing in softer tunes from rock artists, which continued into the 1960s. While WNEW was still playing pop standards, soft rock was a big part of the format, making them a MOR station. Williams hated most of these songs, but played them when he had to.|$|E
2500|$|Addressee honorifics {{express the}} social {{status of the}} person being spoken to (the hearer), {{regardless}} <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>being</b> talked about. For example, Javanese has three different words for [...] "house" [...] depending on the status level of the person spoken to. Referent honorifics express {{the status of the}} person being spoken about. In this type of honorific, both the referent (the person being spoken about) and the target (the person whose status is being expressed) of the honorific expression are the same. This is exemplified by the T–V distinction present in many Indo-European languages, in which a different 2nd person pronoun (such as tu or vous in French) is chosen based on the relative social status of the speaker and the hearer (the hearer, in this case, also being the referent). Bystander honorifics express the status of someone who is nearby, but not a participant in the conversation (the overhearer). These are the least common, and are found primarily in avoidance speech such as the [...] "mother-in-law languages" [...] of aboriginal Australia, where one changes one's speech in the presence of an in-law or other tabooed relative.|$|E
