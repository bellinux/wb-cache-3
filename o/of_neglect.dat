5|$|According to American {{composer}} David Schiff, his compatriot Leonard Bernstein used {{to imply}} that he had single-handedly rescued Mahler from oblivion in 1960, after 50years <b>of</b> <b>neglect.</b> Schiff points out that such neglect was only relative—far less than the (incomplete) disregard of Bach {{in the years after}} his death. Although Bernstein gave the Mahler revival further impetus, it was well under way before 1960, sustained by conductors such as Stokowski, Dimitri Mitropoulos and John Barbirolli, and by the long-time Mahler advocate Aaron Copland.|$|E
5|$|After his death, Gaudí's works {{suffered}} a period <b>of</b> <b>neglect</b> and were largely unpopular among international critics, who regarded them as baroque and excessively imaginative. In his homeland he was equally disdained by Noucentisme, the new movement which took {{the place of}} Modernisme. In 1936, during the Spanish Civil War, Gaudí's workshop in the Sagrada Família was ransacked, and {{a great number of}} his documents, plans and scale models were destroyed.|$|E

5|$|Although it {{has survived}} years of wear and warfare, {{one of the}} palace's wings is now in danger of {{collapsing}} into the Black Sea below. Cracks have begun {{to appear in the}} library, housing almost 10,000 books and manuscripts. Although Edward Blore had a state-of-the-art drainage system built into the palace's foundation, years <b>of</b> <b>neglect</b> and the construction of a nearby sewage pipe in 1974 have helped to increase the potential for a landslide. Another potential looming disaster is surrounding the medieval-style gatehouse near the palace's west side.|$|E
5|$|Bizet's {{marriage}} to Geneviève Halévy was intermittently happy and produced one son. After his death, his work, apart from Carmen, was generally neglected. Manuscripts were given away or lost, and published versions {{of his works}} were frequently revised and adapted by other hands. He founded no school and had no obvious disciples or successors. After years <b>of</b> <b>neglect,</b> his works began to be performed more frequently in the 20th century. Later commentators have acclaimed him as a composer of brilliance and originality whose premature death was a significant loss to French musical theatre.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 19th century, {{the church and}} its parish were showing signs <b>of</b> <b>neglect.</b> In 1802 only ten communicants are recorded, and in 1814 some 90% of the parish {{was thought to be}} non-churchgoing. The church was further reduced by the {{creation}} of the parishes of St Paul's in 1837, St Barnabas' in 1869, and St Frideswide's in 1873.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} of his death, Massenet was {{regarded}} by many critics as old-fashioned and unadventurous although his two best-known operas remained popular in France and abroad. After a few decades <b>of</b> <b>neglect,</b> his works began to be favourably reassessed during the mid-20th century, and many of them have since been staged and recorded. Although critics do not rank him among the handful of outstanding operatic geniuses such as Mozart, Verdi and Wagner, his operas are now widely accepted as well-crafted and intelligent products of the Belle Époque.|$|E

They released 386BSD via an anonymous FTP server. The development flow of 386BSD was slow and after a period <b>of</b> <b>neglect,</b> a group of 386BSD users decided to branch out on their own and create FreeBSD so that they could keep the operating system up to date. The first version of FreeBSD was released on November 1993.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the reasons}} for the long period <b>of</b> <b>neglect</b> of Schubert's piano sonatas seems to be their {{dismissal}} as structurally and dramatically inferior to the sonatas of Beethoven. In fact, the last sonatas contain distinct allusions and similarities to works by Beethoven, a composer Schubert venerated. However, musicological analysis has shown that they maintain a mature, individual style. Schubert's last sonatas are now praised for that mature style, manifested in unique features such as a cyclical formal and tonal design, chamber music textures, and a rare depth of emotional expression.|$|E

Toxicity of drugs, microbial resistance patterns, and long courses of treatments are among the current challenges in effective management <b>of</b> <b>neglected</b> diseases.

5|$|The funding {{produced}} by the Battleship Texas Commission was {{not up to the}} task of maintaining the ship. Consequently, years <b>of</b> <b>neglect</b> resulted in cracks and gaps in coated surfaces, water intrusion, and steel deterioration. Paint in interior spaces began to crack, then flake, exposing metal surfaces underneath, which began to rust. At the same time, pipes open to the sea ultimately failed, flooding various voids and bunkers.|$|E
5|$|Another problem {{exposed by}} Rolling Thunder was the unpreparedness of the Air Force for the {{operations}} it was undertaking. Its aircraft {{had been designed}} and its pilots trained for strategic operations against the Soviet Union – for nuclear, not conventional war. The new campaign exposed years <b>of</b> <b>neglect</b> in conventional tactics, while aircraft capabilities and armament were ill-suited to the task at hand. The Air Force was also embarrassed {{by the fact that}} the Navy was better prepared. It possessed the only all-weather bomber in the U.S. inventory in the new A-6 Intruder and was also responsible for the development of the F-4 Phantom fighter-bomber, which became ubiquitous during the Vietnam War.|$|E
5|$|Attachment {{disorder}} {{is a broad}} term intended to describe disorders of mood, behavior, and social relationships arising from a failure to form normal attachments to primary care giving figures in early childhood. Such a failure would result from unusual early experiences <b>of</b> <b>neglect,</b> abuse, abrupt separation from caregivers between 6 months and three years of age, frequent change or excessive numbers of caregivers, or lack of caregiver responsiveness to child communicative efforts resulting in a lack of basic trust. A problematic history of social relationships occurring after about age three may be distressing to a child, but does not result in attachment disorder.|$|E

5|$|By 1934, {{there was}} a large system of {{interconnected}} bridle paths along trails and park roads. One bridle path ran close by to the lake, intersecting with Mosholu Avenue, before looping around the Parade Ground and diverging in the Northwest Woods. The Van Cortlandt Golf Course also had trails, as did the Old Croton Aqueduct and near Jerome Avenue and Holly Lane. However, as the primary roads through the park such as Jerome, Grand, and Mosholu Avenues were constantly maintained and upgraded, secondary roads fell into a state <b>of</b> <b>neglect.</b> One such road was Rockwood Drive, which was closed in 1936 and became a bridle path.|$|E
5|$|By 1978, {{the number}} of Amin's {{supporters}} and close associates had shrunk significantly, and he faced increasing dissent from the populace within Uganda as the economy and infrastructure collapsed {{as a result of}} the years <b>of</b> <b>neglect</b> and abuse. After the killings of Bishop Luwum and ministers Oryema and Oboth Ofumbi in 1977, several of Amin's ministers defected or fled into exile. In November 1978, after Amin's vice president, General Mustafa Adrisi, was injured in a car crash, troops loyal to him mutinied. Amin sent troops against the mutineers, some of whom had fled across the Tanzanian border. Amin accused Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere of waging war against Uganda, ordered the invasion of Tanzanian territory, and formally annexed a section of the Kagera Region across the boundary.|$|E
5|$|In a 5–4 opinion {{written by}} Justice Harry Blackmun, the Supreme Court of the United States vacated the Appellate Division's ruling, holding that states seeking to sever parental rights irrevocably must show at least {{clear and convincing}} {{evidence}} <b>of</b> <b>neglect.</b> Justice William Rehnquist, joined by three others, dissented, {{on the grounds that}} the majority's focus on a single aspect of the law disregarded the fairness of the scheme as a whole. The ruling has since been criticized for its intrusion into state affairs. Because of the ruling, all states previously using the fair preponderance standard changed to the clear and convincing standard, but California has since abandoned the clear and convincing standard and returned to the fair preponderance standard.|$|E
