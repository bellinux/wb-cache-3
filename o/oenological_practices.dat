50|$|In the European Union (EU), much of {{the wine}} law is common to all {{countries}} through the European Union wine regulations which {{is a part of}} the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). The CAP Wine Regime consists of a set of rules that govern the wine sector, with the aim of achieving a balanced and open market. The principal features are rules governing production, <b>oenological</b> <b>practices</b> and processes, classification of wines, a range of structural and support measures, detailed rules governing the description and labeling of wines, and imports from non-EU countries.|$|E

The wine sector required regulation of more technical aspects, such as the development of wine-growing potential, wine production techniques, <b>oenological</b> <b>practices</b> and processes, rules on designation and presentation, rules governing the movement and release for consumption of wine products, protection of designations of origin, and so on.|$|E

30|$|The {{majority}} of studies regarding {{the effect of}} nutrients on yeast derived aroma compounds have focused on nutrient addition to the grape juice immediately prior to or during alcoholic fermentation. The common <b>oenological</b> <b>practice</b> of using active dry yeast (ADY) for wine fermentation necessitates rehydration, since water availability in ADY is too low for yeast to maintain metabolic activity during storage (Rapoport et al. 1997). This step represents a further opportunity for nutrient supplementation. Previous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of nutrient supplementation {{at this point in}} time on yeast viability and vitality. Supplementation of organic nutrient in the form of inactive dry yeast (IDY) was found to increase fermentation rate, supposedly due to an incorporation of solubilised sterol present in IDY (Soubeyrand et al. 2005). Additions of fermentable carbon source and magnesium salts were also shown to enhance both viability and vitality of dehydrated yeast following rehydration (Kraus et al. 1981; Rodríguez-Porrata et al. 2008).|$|R

40|$|Aims: Volatile phenols (4 -ethylphenol and 4 -ethylguaiacol) affect wine quality by imparting, above certain concentrations, aroma defects. This work {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the effect of some common <b>oenological</b> <b>practices</b> on the concentration of volatile phenols and the sensory impact of these odour-active compounds in wines. Methods and results: The studied <b>oenological</b> <b>practices</b> {{were based on the}} addition of gum arabic, mannoproteins, yeast cell walls, lees, oak chips, dairy cream and potassium caseinate and on the application of a bubbled nitrogen stream. These treatments were applied to naturally contaminated wines containing volatile phenols at concentrations above detection threshold. The treated wines were characterised by chemical and sensory analysis. The most effective treatments in the reduction of the concentration of volatile phenols were the addition of fine lees, cream and potassium caseinate. Apart from being able to partially remove these compounds (approximately 35 % removal), fine lees contributed to a greater “freshness” and complexity of the wines. Although the addition of cream did decrease the sensory impact of volatile phenols, it did not benefit the wines as these were strongly marked by dairy aromas. The use of oak chips, although it did not have a notable effect on the removal of volatile phenols, led to a significant reduction in the perception of these compounds...|$|E
30|$|Wine is a natural, {{agricultural}} product recognized by European Union (EU) treaties and defined in Comité Européen des Entreprises Vins (CEEV)EU legislation as a “product obtained exclusively {{from the total}} or partial alcoholic fermentation of fresh grapes, whether or not crushed, or of grape mus.” (Comité Européen des Entreprises Vins (CEEV) 2016 b). In EU member countries, ingredients and nutritional labeling in wine and beverages are exempted {{according to a new}} regulation (EU regulation 1169 / 2011) and allow for authorized food additives, including an explicit reference to the specific EU Common Market Organization (CMO) rules on <b>Oenological</b> <b>Practices</b> for wines (Comité Européen des Entreprises Vins (CEEV) 2016 a).

40|$|Protection of the {{vineyard}} against diseases and pests {{may lead to}} pesticide residues in the wine. Traces of these active substances, even at concentrations below the legal limits, alarm the consumers and can compromise the potential to sale wines to some markets.

A laboratory pilot filtration device has been developed in order to confirm the efficiency of this treatment {{and its impact on the}} wine quality before its large-scale use in industrial conditions. This simple device is made of a peristaltic pump and a laboratory filter holder. Several wines with different fibre doses and filtration speeds can be rapidly tested, at bottle scale (75 [*]cl).

The use of some cultivars may contribute phenolic compounds that modify certain characteristics in blended wines, particularly {{those related to}} mouthfeel. The aim of this work was to study the effect of Carm´en` ere, Merlot and Cabernet Franc on the phenolic composition, proanthocyanidin profile and mouthfeel characteristics of Cabernet Sauvignon blends. RESULTS: Significant differences in chemical composition were observed among the monovarietal wines. Separation using Sep-Pak C 18 cartridges revealed differences in the concentration {{but not in the}} proportion of various proanthocyanidins. Blending reduced polyphenol concentration differences among the various monovarietal wines. Although no major overall differences were observed after blending the monovarietal wines, this <b>oenological</b> <b>practice</b> produced clear differences in mouthfeel characteristics {{in such a way that}} the quality of the perceived astringency was different. CONCLUSION: This study showed that the use of a particular wine variety (Cabernet Sauvignon) in a higher proportion in wine blending produced blends that were less differentiable from the monovarietal wine, owing to a suppression effect, producing an apparent standardization of the wines regarding chemical composition.

After the application of chemometric techniques for descriptive analyses {{to the results of}} the oenological assessment, the yeasts were divided into 3 groups, A, B and C. Group A had some strains which caused low values of dry extract and glycerol in wines. Yeasts in group B were less interesting in terms of their oenological characteristics. Yeasts in group C had mixed behaviour with positive and negative characteristics and their utilisation must be considered separately each time.

40|$|The {{ability of}} the grapevine to {{activate}} defense mechanisms against some pathogens {{has been shown to}} be linked to the synthesis of resveratrol and other stilbenes by the plant (inducible viniferins). Metabolized viniferins may also be produced or modified by extracellular enzymes released by the pathogen in an attempt to eliminate undesirable toxic compounds. Because of the important properties of resveratrol, there is increasing interest in producing wines with higher contents of this compound and a higher nutritional value. Many biotic and abiotic elicitors can trigger the resveratrol synthesis in the berries, and some examples are reported. Under the same elicitation pressure, viticultural and enological factors can substantially affect the resveratrol concentration in the wine. The production of high resveratrol-containing grapes and wines relies on quality-oriented viticulture (suitable terroirs and sustainable cultural practices) and winemaking technologies that avoid degradation of the compound. In general, the <b>oenological</b> <b>practices</b> commonly used to stabilize wine after fermentation do not affect resveratrol concentration, which shows considerable stability. Finally the paper reports on two sirtuin genes (SIRT) expressed in grapevine leaves and berries and the role of resveratrol on the deacetylation activity of the encoded enzymes...|$|E
40|$|Wine {{exports from}} the European Union have gained shares in both {{traditional}} markets (US, Canada, Switzerland and Japan) {{and in new}} markets (China, Hong Kong and Russia). In coming years, major growth in consumption and imports is expected in these new markets and in others, like Singapore, South Korea, India, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa and Angola. Most of the above new markets, however, are still heavily protected by high tariff and non- tariff barriers, the most intrusive being wine labelling regulations, <b>oenological</b> <b>practices,</b> maximum residue limits of agrichemicals, certifi cation and testing procedures. Since the stalling of the Doha multilateral negotiations exporting countries have been negotiating Free Trade Agreements to gain preferential access to fast growing markets.

However, isotope characteristics of carbon of intramolecular structural groups of dihydroxysuccinic acid made of different raw materials differ significantly. This allows specifying the nature of dihydroxysuccinic acid that is used for making of wines and juice drinks. In Russia, scientific and research institute of beer brewing and wine-making industry carried out a work for studying isotope characteristics of intramolecular isotope heterogeneity of dihydroxysuccinic acid from different origins in order to identify wines and juice drinks. Isotope characteristics of organic oxy acids from different origins were studied including them obtained by synthetic way and numeric range of value δ 13 [*]C,‰ were specified.

40|$|The main aim of {{this work}} was to test a dry-ice basting method to {{regenerate}} the barriques in order to prolong their life. In addition, this treatment for barrels can also represent {{an alternative to the}} use of sulfur dioxide for the barrique sanitization, in line with the guidelines of <b>oenological</b> <b>practices</b> for sustainable development proposed by the OIV (International Organization of Vine and Wine) (sustainable development, food security: reduction the content of sulfites in wine). The effect of the blasting with dry ice for the treatment of barrique has been studied from a microbiological and sensory point of view. Microbiological analyses were carried out using wine contaminated with Brettanomyces and Lactobacillus; results showed a reduction of contaminant of 98 – 100 %. Finally, it was evaluated the impact of this treatment on the sensory profile of wine. In this regard the wine aged in a barrique dry-ice blasted was compared with a wine aged in a barrique treated with sulfur dioxide. From the sensory analysis emerged that the dry-ice blasting treatment can regenerate the barriques, this confers to the wine increased notes of vanilla and boisé. The benefits that derive from the use of this method are: a good sanitization of the barrel, a positive impact on the organo- leptic characteristics of the wine and the ability to regenerate and reuse a barrel, with a positive effect on sustainability...|$|E

Thus, the touristic products of oenotourism are complex attractions with {{a substantial number of}} educational elements, such as on-site wine appreciation courses, organized wine excursions on well known wine routes, wine festivals, international sommelier days or agro-tourism in wine estates where tourists may have the opportunity to participate in the harvest and learn more about the wine making process. The main target groups of wine-tourism consist of educated, mostly middle aged people with reasonably good economy and a clear intention {{to learn more about the}} culture and history of the country and its viticultural areas in an informal, entertaining way. An increasing number of vintners expand their agribusiness with a complete product structure such as grape seed oil, grappa, fruit juice, cheese, olive oil, food supplements produced from grapes, accommodation facilities from bed and breakfast to hotels and restaurants, creating herewith ideal conditions for tourism, often utilizing the network of completing, additional tourist attractions in the neighbourhood. Special attention shall be paid to the organic viticulture and wine production based on the maintenance of ecological cycles in the vineyard, because it can be the basis of eco-wine tourism, and even wine-heritage tourism due to the revival of certain traditional cultivation methods, trades and crafts linked to the historical routes of the wine industry.

40|$|The {{control and}} {{optimization}} of oxygen content in wine matrices {{is becoming more}} and more important in wine production in order to guarantee their best quality. It is well known that in a first phase O 2 is necessary to facilitate the development and activity of yeasts, to favor the combination of anthocyanins and color stabilization, and to help reducing the astringency of red wines. In a second phase, however, during the maturation, O 2 can severely deteriorate the organoleptic characteristics of the wine. The main <b>oenological</b> <b>practices</b> commonly performed in wine cellars causes remarkable amounts of oxygen to dissolve in wine. For this reason, an instrumentation able to be used in cellars is needed to detect the amount of dissolved oxygen in the wine; as well, a plant technology is needed which is capable of eliminating excess oxygen. In this work, a new economic prototype of optical sensor for oxygen measurements in oenological matrices is developed. It is based on the sampling of the light emission of a polysulfone polymer membrane containing 5, 10, 15, 20 -Tetraphenyl- 21 H, 23 H-porphyrin platinum (II) (PtTPP). The experimental parameter used for calibration of the sensor is the life time of the PtTPP, obtained from the fitting of the emission decay profile produced by stimulation of the membrane with short pulses emitted by a 390 nm excitation LED. The membrane guarantees a linear behavior of the Stern-Volmer equation and long-lasting signal stability [1, 2]. Studies on the behavior of the sensor have been performed in different environments such as air, water, synthetic wine, and also in real red and white wine samples at different temperatures from 5 ° to 20 ° C. The sensor has been suitably designed to work in food matrices and to optimize the noise signal ratio, while keeping the price of the components as low as possible. The sensor was tested for a month within a barrel of 10 m containing wine in the first fermentation phase. In particular, two equal sensors were placed at two levels of depth compared to the wine infeed level: at 0. 5 and 2. 5 m, respectively. The oxygen content measured during this period was always constant and equal to 0. 2...|$|E
