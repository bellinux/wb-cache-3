50|$|The {{number of}} turbine stages varies in {{different}} types of engines, with high-bypass-ratio engines tending {{to have the most}} turbine stages. The number of turbine stages can have a great effect on how the turbine blades are designed for each stage. Many gas turbine engines are twin-spool designs, meaning that there is a high-pressure spool and a low-pressure spool. <b>Other</b> <b>gas</b> <b>turbines</b> use three spools, adding an intermediate-pressure spool between the high- and low-pressure spool. The high-pressure turbine is exposed to the hottest, highest-pressure air, and the low-pressure turbine is subjected to cooler, lower-pressure air. The difference in conditions leads to the design of high-pressure and low-pressure turbine blades that are significantly different in material and cooling choices even though the aerodynamic and thermodynamic principles are the same.Under these severe operating conditions inside the gas and steam turbines, the blades face high temperature, high stresses, and potentially high vibrations. Steam turbine blades are critical components in power plants which convert the linear motion of high-temperature and high-pressure steam flowing down a pressure gradient into a rotary motion of the turbine shaft.|$|E

This thesis investigates the feasibility of coating MoSi 2 sacrificial particles with a protective Al 2 O 3 shell to prevent this oxidation, while still retaining particle availability upon damage. Two different chemical methods, namely a sol-gel procedure and atomic layer deposition with residual chemical vapor deposition were successfully utilized to coat MoSi 2 healing particles. The microcapsule composition and integrity has been investigated by means of scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results demonstrate that after calcining at 1200 °C for 1 h in argon ?-Al 2 O 3 shell can be formed and the shell remains intact. Subsequently the heat treated encapsulated particles were embedded in YSZ matrix followed by healing tests at 1100 and 1200 °C. The crack-healing tests proved that the shells produced by both methods remain intact at high temperatures, but also the coatings have a protective effect compared to uncoated MoSi 2. Moreover, the embedded particles show a crack healing effect, indicating the feasibility of this self-healing concept.

The developed simulation methods and the systems have been applied to a model turbojet and a model turboshaft gas turbine engine to demonstrate the effectiveness of both two methods. The comparison between the results of engines with and without the ICV method simulated fuel system models shows that the delay of the engine transient response due to the inclusion of the fuel system components and introduced inter-component volumes is noticeable, although relatively small.

One of the major control problems associated with these compressors is pressure fluctuation. In recent years, various control methods have been designed and applied {{in the field to}} reduce pressure fluctuation and improve the overall operating stability. This paper describes recent advanced complex gas compression control techniques used for centrifugal compressors, and a verification method using a newly developed control system and dynamic simulator. One of the control techniques used for fuel gas compressors that supply fuel <b>gas</b> to <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> combined cycle (GTCC) power plants is described in this paper. Two compressors supply the fuel gas to two independent <b>gas</b> <b>turbines</b> through on common header. Each <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> is related to each individual compressor, which has to supply fuel gas for the individual <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> according to the load by modulating the control valve opening. The compressor also has to stabilize the common header pressure fluctuation by changing the <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> loads. For this process, on control technique is proposed with feed forward (FF) control for the load changing of <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> and feedback (FB) control for common header pressure stabilization, as well as application of the above technique in a plant operating in the field. With the FF and FB control, if load shedding of one <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> occurs and the <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> load suddenly goes down, the <b>other</b> <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> can continue operating safely.

In order to select the appropriate filtration system, air monitoring of turbine inlet and its filtration is essential. Therefore, this study was performed to assess the quality of <b>gas</b> <b>turbines</b> inlets in a gas power plant in Tehran.. Material and Method: In this cross- sectional study, the concentration of particulates contained in air intake of 4 types of <b>gas</b> <b>turbines,</b> including: Fiat, Assec, Hitachi and mitsubishi were evaluated in second-half of spring season. For this means, 12 series of air samples were collected using 8 stages cascade Impactor, model AN - 200 made by OGAWA company on cellulose – ester filters. The dust concentrations were determined gravimetrically in different ranges of sizes. Then the concentrations of 8 metals including Sodium, Potassiumu Lead, Mercury, Aluminum,Copper and Cadmium were measured using,Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy method and the data were statistically analyzed by SPSS Software, version 16.. Results: The {{results showed that the}} mean of particulate concentration with the diameter less than 4. 7 µ were 64 %, 66 %, 60 %, 67 % for Fiat, Assec, Hitachi, mitsubishi respectively and it was 64. 25 % totally.

This thesis investigates, both theoreticallyand experimentally, two alternative approaches tohumidification: the packed-bed humidification tower and thetubular humidifier. Both these equipments involvecountercurrent contact between water and the working fluid. Humidifier design criteria are developed and criticalparameters such as flooding, wetting rate and entrainment arediscussed.

The following <b>gas</b> <b>turbines</b> were evaluated for the modifications expected for APFBC service: 2 x Rolls-Royce Industrial Trent aeroderivative <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> configurations; a 3 x Pratt & Whitney Turbo Power FT 8 Twin-Pac (6 FT 8 s) aeroderivative <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> configuration; 1 x General Electric PG 7121 EA <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> configuration; several Siemens Westinghouse <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> configurations that included 1 x and 2 x V 64. 3, 1 x V 84. 3, and 1 x W 501 F gas turbines; and several configurations of Dresser-Rand turbomachinery units. These <b>gas</b> <b>turbines</b> were core elements used in the concept APFBC repowering of five U. S...|$|R
40|$|Vibration {{generated}} from main rotor unbalance {{has a major}} impact on the aerospace <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> industry. A combination of logistical and technological drivers differentiate aerospace <b>gas</b> <b>turbines</b> and their derivatives from <b>other</b> types of <b>gas</b> <b>turbines</b> with respect to the approach for managing vibration, leading to a bespoke approach for the design, build, and balancing. The key drivers are: limited accessibility to rotors within the engine, the requirement for exchangeable modules (sub-assemblies) of major parts of the rotor without rebalancing, the use of only low-speed balancing on pseudo-rigid rotors with bladed assemblies, very low vibration limits leading to very tight balancing limits, extreme weight limits for design solutions, and the need for highly accurate, repeatable, and stable rotor joints. This study proposes and demonstrates a novel and rapid robust design system that has been created to deal with these unique challenges. The system comprises an overarching process and a set of novel tools and methods that have been created to support the process. These tools comprise an Unbalance Response Function (URF) design method that effectively delivers a preliminary design assessment and a fast Monte-Carlo simulation and comparison method with supporting software for comparing and improving build and balance design solutions. The aim of the overall process is to generate a system that identifies and controls critical parameters, and alleviates time wasted controlling non-critical parameters. The target outcome is therefore the most cost effective, predictable and repeatable solution with respect to rotor generated vibration (i. e. robust). Two novel methods of informing and improving the outcome of the low-speed balancing process using extra information available about the rotor are also introduced...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} work, {{the results are}} {{reported}} of the energy and exergy analyses of three biomass-related processes for electricity generation: the biomass gasification integrated externally fired combined cycle, the biomass gasification integrated dual-fuel combined cycle, and the biomass gasification integrated post-firing combined cycle. The energy efficiency for the biomass gasification integrated post-firing combined cycle is 3 % to 6 % points higher than for the other cycles. Although {{the efficiency of the}} externally fired biomass combined cycle is the lowest, it has an advantage in that it only uses biomass. The energy and exergy efficiencies are maximized for the three configurations at particular values of compressor pressure ratios, and increase with <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> inlet temperature. As pressure ratio increases, the mass of air per mass of steam decreases for the biomass gasification integrated post-firing combined cycle, but the pressure ratio has little influence on the ratio of mass of air per mass of steam for the <b>other</b> cycles. The <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> exergy efficiency is the highest for the three configurations. The combustion chamber for the dual-fuel cycle exhibits the highest exergy efficiency and that for the post-firing cycle the lowest. Another benefit of the biomass gasification integrated externally fired combined cycle is that it exhibits the highest air preheater and heat recovery steam generator exergy efficiencies...|$|R
