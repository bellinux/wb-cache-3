40|$|There are {{approximately}} a million subsistence fishermen in Brazil whose activities {{expose them to}} severe occupational hazards without adequate health protection. This article conducts an analysis of working conditions and health risks faced by subsistence fishermen and outlines challenges {{to the implementation of}} Occupational Health Surveillance (VISAT) actions. The methodology is based on qualitative analysis of risks and working conditions through observation and interviews, and diagnosis of <b>occupational</b> <b>illnesses</b> with clinical evaluation. Mobile teams conducted eight years of activities together with fishing communities throughout the state of Bahia. The results revealed the challenge of surveying a traditional self-employed category with relative management autonomy. Fishermen face precarious living conditions without access to occupational health services.

40|$|Objectives. The goal of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} acute <b>occupational</b> pesticide-related <b>illnesses</b> among youths and to provide prevention recommendations. Methods. Survey data from 8 states and from poison control center data were analyzed. Illness incidence rates and incidence rate ratios were calculated. Results. A total of 531 youths were identified with acute <b>occupational</b> pesticide-related <b>illnesses.</b> Insecticides were responsible for most of these illnesses (68 %), most of which were of minor severity (79 %). The average annual incidence rate among youths aged 15 to 17 years was 20. 4 per billion hours worked, and the incidence rate ratio among youths vs adults was 1. 71 (95 % confidence interval= 1. 53, 1. 91).

40|$|This study {{examined}} the association between labour intensification due to work intensification and work extensification and ill health in women in certain manufacturing work in the Philippines. Work intensification is defined as more workload for each worker, and work extensification as less deadtime or work rest and more overtime. The sample was 23 establishments and 630 respondents. Workplace environment monitoring showed exposure to hazards such as noise, chemicals, poor ventilation, and poor illumination. The most prevalent illnesses and health problems were headache and coughs and colds. Results of focus group discussions showed adverse work conditions, hazard exposures among women workers, fast pace of work, close supervision, prevalent <b>occupational</b> <b>illnesses,</b> and management style that do not comply with the national work standards.

40|$|In 2004, a {{total of}} 251 metal mining {{operations}} reported employment to the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA). Metal mines were the smallest mining commodity sector, comprising 1. 7 % of all mining operations. Gold mines comprised 47. 0 % (n= 118) of all metal mining operations. Other common types of metal mines were iron ore (n= 29; 11. 6 %), copper ore (n= 27; 10. 8 %), and lead and/or zinc ore (n= 18; 7. 2 %). Nevada had {{the largest number of}} metal mines (n= 51; 20. 3 %), followed by Alaska (n= 26; 10. 4 %). A total of 25, 205 employees, corresponding to 26, 091 full-time equivalent (FTE) employees, were reported by metal mine operators. Within the mining sectors, metal mine operator employees accounted for 9. 6 % of all employee hours reported to MSHA. Metal operator employee hours were reported for both underground (14. 6 %) and surface (85. 4 %) work locations. Two occupational fatalities occurred among metal mine operator employees in 2004, compared to one fatality in 2003. The metal mine operator fatality rate was 7. 7 fatalities per 100, 000 FTE employees. There were 558 nonfatal lost-time injuries (130 at underground and 428 at surface work locations) among metal operator employees occurring at a rate of 2. 1 injuries per 100 FTE employees. A total of 27, 057 days lost from work resulted from these injuries. The underground nonfatal lost-time injury rate was greater than the surface injury rate (3. 4 vs. 1. 9 per 100 FTE workers). The most frequent classification of nonfatal lost time injuries for metal operator employees involved handling materials (n= 206; 36. 9 %). Sprains and strains were the most frequently reported nature of injury (n= 260; 46. 6 %). The back was the most frequently reported part of the body injured (n= 102; 18. 3 %) and accounted for 4, 051 days lost from work. In 2004, 44 cases of <b>occupational</b> <b>illnesses</b> were reported to MSHA by metal operators. This compares to 63 cases reported in 2003. Joint, tendon, or muscle inflammation or irritation accounted for the most frequently reported <b>occupational</b> <b>illnesses</b> (n= 29; 65. 9 %). There were seven cases of hearing loss or impairment reported to MSHA (or 15. 9 % of all <b>occupational</b> <b>illnesses</b> reported).
