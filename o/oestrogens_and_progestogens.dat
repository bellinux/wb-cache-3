30|$|Irregular {{bleeding}} {{associated with}} the use of a combination of <b>oestrogens</b> <b>and</b> <b>progestogens</b> is considered as an unacceptable side effect of HRT [7]. In continuous combined regimens, <b>oestrogens</b> <b>and</b> <b>progestogens</b> are administered together daily, and such treatment should produce an atrophic endometrium and amenorrhoea. Alternately, in sequential or cyclic regimens, progestogens are given after oestrogens in order to induce predictable withdrawal bleeding [8]. Persistent bleeding associated with combined regimens or occurring before the discontinuation of progestogens in the sequential regimens should be considered abnormal, and its cause should be investigated in order to exclude uterine pathology. Various diagnostic imaging modalities that can be used are transvaginal ultrasonography (TVS), saline infusion sonohysterography (SIS) and hysteroscopy (HYS) and biopsy [9]. The diagnostic strength and advantages and disadvantages of such techniques must be known, as must their observer dependence, to guarantee that the right technique is favoured over others and that it is applied in a cost-effective way.|$|E

40|$|The {{expression}} of <b>oestrogen</b> <b>and</b> <b>progestogen</b> receptors, {{as well as}} Cathepsin D, an oestrogen-induced protease, in trophoblastic cells of 12 cases of complete hydatidiform mole, 12 cases of partial mole and nine cases of spontaneous abortions, were studied {{in an attempt to}} elucidate their possible roles in the pathogenesis of the diseases. The immunohistochemical studies were performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue using the ABC immunoperoxidase method. The intensity of staining and proportion of cells stained were assessed and compared in the three categories of lesions. Immunoreactivity for Cathepsin D was noted in both the syncytio- and cytotrophoblastic cells in all three lesions. Statistical analysis showed consistently stronger and more extensive staining for Cathepsin D in complete moles when compared with abortions. Staining for <b>oestrogen</b> <b>and</b> <b>progestogen</b> receptors was found to be weak in the tissues studied. The strong {{expression of}} Cathepsin D in trophoblastic cells of all three lesions, especially in complete mole, suggests that it might be important in the control of trophoblastic cell activities and involved in the pathogenesis of hydatidiform mole.

Experimental diabetes was previously shown to modify the hormonal milieu and produce alterations in oestrogen receptor kinetics in the uterine tissue. In the present work, <b>oestrogen</b> <b>and</b> <b>progestogen</b> receptor levels were measured on the morning of day 6 of pregnancy in normal and in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, both in implantation sites and in interembryonic segments of endometrium and myometrium. Receptor levels were different in the implantation sites compared to the interembryonic segments of endometrium, both in the control and in the diabetic animals. Indeed, implantation sites were characterized by lower oestrogen receptor levels in cytosol <b>and</b> higher <b>progestogen</b> receptor levels in cytosol and nuclei. However, compared to the control rats, the diabetic rats had lower oestrogen receptor levels in implantation sites, both in cytosol and nuclei. In the myometrium, the differences between sites or between types of rats were minimal. Plasma levels of oestradiol were lower in diabetic rats than in control animals, whereas progesterone levels were similar. A 20 % lower implantation rate was found in diabetic rats, compared to normal rats. These results show that the specific distribution of <b>oestrogen</b> <b>and</b> <b>progestogen</b> receptors between implantation sites and interembryonic segments was preserved in the diabetic rats; however the absolute level of oestrogen receptor was lower. This abnormal endocrine milieu might arise from a lower oestradiol level and a decreased oestradiol/progesterone ratio in the circulating blood. Whether the lower implantation rate in diabetic rats might be a consequence of the overall disturbed hormonal status remains to be elucidated...|$|R

40|$|Monographs on the {{carcinogenic}} risk {{to humans}} concluded that combined oral oestrogen–progestogen contraceptives are carcinogenic to humans (IARC, 2007). This evaluation {{was made on}} the basis of increased risks for cancer of the breast (among current and recent users only), cervix and liver (in populations that are at low risk for hepatitis B viral infection). There is also convincing evidence in humans that these agents confer a protective effect against cancer of the endometrium and ovary. The IARC (2007) review also concluded that there is sufficient evidence in humans for the carcinogenicity of combined oestrogen–progestogen menopausal therapy in the breast. With respect to endometrial cancer, combined oestrogen–progestogen menopausal therapy was evaluated as carcinogenic when progestogens are taken for o 10 days per month, while there was evidence suggesting lack of carcinogenicity in the endometrium when progestogens are taken daily.

40|$|Oestrogen receptors were {{measured}} in the cytosolic and purified nuclear fractions of rat liver. Both cytosolic and nuclear receptors bind oestrogen with high affinity (Kd = 1. 47 and 2. 28 nM respectively) and specificity {{similar to that of}} receptors in order oestrogen-target tissues such as the uterus. During the 4 -day oestrous cycle the receptor content and distribution between cytosol and nucleus did not vary; in particular, the content of nuclear receptor did not appear to fluctuate in concert with known cyclic changes in the concentration of plasma oestrogen. Injection of 50 micrograms of oestradiol- 17 beta or 10 micrograms of ethynyloestradiol resulted in a 4 [...] 6 -fold increase in the nuclear receptor content, with a concomitant decrease in the unoccupied-receptor content of cytosol 1 h after injection. The nuclear receptors present after injection bind oestrogens with similar affinity (Kd = 2. 78 nM) and specificity to receptors present in uninjected animals. The administration of lower doses of either oestrogen was less effective in producing increases in nuclear receptor content. Hence there is apparently substantial translocation of receptor to the nucleus in response to hyperphysiological doses of oestrogen, but not to the physiological changes in plasma oestrogen concentrations during the oestrous cycle.

40|$|Objective: The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} {{in order to determine the}} change of frequency and type of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) regimen newly prescribed by Dutch GPs. Methods: A comparison was made of two data sets (multi-stage random samples) collected in 1987 / 88 and from 1995 to 1998 concerning women 40 years and older who were newly prescribed HRT. Results: Compared with 1987 / 88, 50 % more patients were newly prescribed HRT in 1998 (2. 0 in 1987 / 88 and 3. 0 in 1998 per 1000 registered women, P< 0. 01). The age distribution remained about the same, with a peak between 50 and 54 years in each year of registration. Unopposed oestrogens (including plasters) were prescribed less frequently (1. 3 % in 1987 / 88 versus 0. 7 % in 1998, P< 0. 001), and combinations of oestrogen and progestogen more frequently in 1998 (0. 2 % in 1987 / 88 versus 1. 8 % in 1998, P< 0. 01). Sequential therapy was prescribed slightly more frequently than xxxx therapy (65 % sequential therapy in 1995; 55 % in 1998). The most frequent reason for starting HRT in 1995 - 1998 was climacteric symptoms (89 - 98 %), followed by osteoporosis prevention (16 - 28 %) and early menopause (13 - 25 %). Rarely were preventive goals the only reason (6 %) for prescribing HRT. Conclusions: The number of HRT prescriptions increased by 50 % over the last decade of the millennium.

40|$|Combined oral {{contraceptives}} consist of the steroid hormone oestrogen {{in combination with}} a progestogen, taken primarily to prevent pregnancy. The same hormones {{can also be used}} in other forms for contraception. Combined oral contraceptive pills generally refer to pills in which an <b>oestrogen</b> <b>and</b> a <b>progestogen</b> are given concurrently in a monthly cycle. In contrast, a cycle of sequential oral contraceptive pills includes oestrogen-only pills followed by five to seven days of oestrogen plus progestogen pills. Sequential oral contraceptive pills were removed from the consumer market in the late 1970 s; they are covered in an IARC monograph (IARC, 1979, 1987). Combined {{oral contraceptives}} are thus usually administered as a pill containing <b>oestrogen</b> <b>and</b> <b>progestogen,</b> which is taken daily for 20 – 22 days, followed by a seven-day pill-free interval (or seven days of placebo), during which time a withdrawal bleed is expected to occur. The most commonly used oestrogen is ethinyloestradiol, although mestranol is used in some formulations. The progestogens most commonly used in combined oral contraceptives are derived from 19 -nortestosterone and include norethisterone, norgestrel and levonorgestrel, although many others are available (Kleinman, 1990) (see Annex 2, Table 1) ...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Postnatal depression, with a {{prevalence}} {{of at least}} 10 %, {{is probably the most}} common complication of the puerperium. A deficiency or imbalance of sex hormones has repeatedly been suggested as a cause. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review was to evaluate the role of <b>oestrogens</b> <b>and</b> <b>progestogens</b> in the prevention and treatment of postnatal depression. SEARCH STRATEGY: The register of clinical trials maintained and updated by the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group. SELECTION CRITERIA: All trials were considered in which pregnant or postpartum women (up to 18 months) were randomised to receive postpartum oestrogen or progestogen or placebo for the treatment or prevention of postnatal depression. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two published randomised placebo controlled trials were identified for inclusion in the analyses for this review. One study was excluded. MAIN RESULTS: Depot norethisterone enanthate given within 48 hours of delivery and lasting 8 - 12 weeks was associated with significantly higher postpartum depression scores than placebo. Oestrogen therapy in severely depressed women was associated with a greater improvement in depression scores than placebo. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: There is no place for synthetic progestogens in the prevention of treatment of postnatal depression. Long-acting norethisterone enanthate is associated with an increased risk of postnatal depression. It and other long-acting progestogen contraceptives should be used with caution in the postnatal period, especially in women with a history of depression. The role of progesterone in the prevention and treatment of postnatal depression has yet to be evaluated in a randomised placebo-controlled trial. Oestrogen therapy may be of modest value at a late stage of severe postnatal depression. Its role in the prevention of recurrent postnatal depression has not been evaluated. Further research on its value is unlikely for ethical reasons. Revie...|$|E
40|$|At least 20 {{million women}} in {{developed}} countries {{are estimated to be}} currently using hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Almost 100 epidemiological studies have reported on the relationship between the use of HRT and the risk of cancer of female reproductive organs, namely the breast, uterus or ovary. Cancer at these sites is common and there are a priori reasons why the use of hormonal therapy to 'replace' the endogenous production of ovarian hormones after the menopause might increase the risk of these cancers. The available evidence indicates that {{the risk of breast cancer}} or endometrial cancer is increased while women are using HRT, the risk increasing with increasing duration of use. Most of the evidence about these cancers relates to use of HRT preparations containing oestrogens alone. The limited evidence about combination therapy, with <b>oestrogens</b> <b>and</b> <b>progestogens,</b> suggests that, compared to oestrogens alone, the effect on the breast is similar, but the effect on the endometrium is diminished, the diminution in risk being greater the more days each month that progestogens are used. The effect of HRT on breast cancer wears off after use ceases and has disappeared largely, if not wholly, within 5 years, whereas the effects on endometrial cancer take longer to wear off, if at all. The breast and endometrial cancers that are diagnosed in HRT users are less aggressive clinically than cancers in never-users but, as yet, there is little reliable information about the relationship between use of HRT and mortality from these cancers. For other cancer sites, the existing data about the effects of HRT are inconclusive. The longer the period of use of HRT, the greater the excess incidence of cancer of the breast and endometrium is likely to be. Use of HRT for short periods of time should have little effect on the incidence of these cancers. The cumulative excess incidence in 1000 women who used HRT for 10 years, beginning at age 50, is estimated to be six for breast cancer, 42 for endometrial cancer in women with an intact uterus using oestrogen therapy alone and about 20 for endometrial cancer in women with an intact uterus using oestrogen-progestogen combinations. The estimate for combined therapy is based on small numbers and may well vary with the type of preparation used. The overall balance between the excess incidence of these cancers and other effects of HRT needs to be evaluated carefully and will require more reliable data than exist at present...|$|E
40|$|The Collaborative Group on Hormonal Factors in Breast Cancer {{has brought}} {{together}} and reanalysed the worldwide epidemiological evidence on {{breast cancer risk}} and use of hormonal contraceptives. Original data from 54 studies, representing about 90 % of the information available on the topic, were collected, checked and analysed centrally. The 54 studies were performed in 26 countries and include a total of 53, 297 women with breast cancer and 100, 239 women without breast cancer. The studies were varied in their design, setting and timing. Most information came from case-control studies with controls chosen from the general population; most women resided in Europe or North America and most cancers were diagnosed during the 1980 s. Overall 41 % of the women with breast cancer and 40 % of the women without breast cancer had used oral contraceptives at some time; the median age at first use was 26 years, the median duration of use was 3 years, the median year of first use was 1968, the median time since first use was 16 years, and the median time since last use was 9 years. The main findings, summarised elsewhere, are {{that there is a}} small increase in the risk of having breast cancer diagnosed in current users of combined oral contraceptives and in women who had stopped use in the past 10 years but that {{there is no evidence of}} an increase in the risk more than 10 years after stopping use. In addition, the cancers diagnosed in women who had used oral contraceptives tended to be less advanced clinically than the cancers diagnosed in women who had not used them. Despite the large number of possibilities investigated, few factors appeared to modify the main findings either in recent or in past users. For recent users who began use before age 20 the relative risks are higher than for recent users who began at older ages. For women whose use of oral contraceptives ceased more than 10 years before there was some suggestion of a reduction in breast cancer risk in certain subgroups, with a deficit of tumors that had spread beyond the breast, especially among women who had used preparations containing the highest doses of oestrogen and progestogen. These findings are unexpected and need to be confirmed. Although these data represent most of the epidemiological evidence on the topic to date, there is still insufficient information to comment reliably about the effects of specific types of oestrogen or of progestogen. What evidence there is suggests, however, no major differences in the effects for specific types of oestrogen or of progestogen and that the pattern of risk associated with use of hormonal contraceptives containing progestogens alone may be similar to that observed for preparations containing both <b>oestrogens</b> <b>and</b> <b>progestogens.</b> On the basis of these results, there is little difference between women who have and have not used combined oral contraceptives in terms of the estimated cumulative number of breast cancers diagnosed during the period from starting use up to 20 years after stopping. The cancers diagnosed in women who have used oral contraceptives are, however, less advanced clinically than the cancers diagnosed in never users. Further research is needed to establish whether the associations described here are due to earlier diagnosis of breast cancer in women who have used oral contraceptives, to the biological effects of the hormonal contraceptives or to a combination of both. Little information is as yet available about the effects on breast cancer risk of oral contraceptive use that ceased more than 20 years before and as such data accumulate it will be necessary to re-examine the worldwide evidence...|$|E

40|$|Hormone {{replacement}} therapy (HRT) effectively relieves vasomotor and other symptoms associated with menopause, yet is underutilised {{by the majority}} of menopausal women. Current HRT regimens combine continuous oestrogen with continuous or sequential progestogen in order to achieve the beneficial effects of oestrogen while avoiding the potential for increased risk of endometrial cancer. Uterine bleeding and other adverse progestogenic effects are major reasons for patient noncompliance and early discontinuation of combination HRT, which can ultimately limit the achievement of long-term oestrogenic benefits. A novel constant 17 β-oestradiol, intermittent norgestimate regimen has been developed based on theoretical hormone receptor dynamics in an attempt to minimise the hormonal doses needed, thereby potentially reducing the occurrence of adverse effects associated with higher <b>oestrogen</b> <b>and</b> <b>progestogen</b> doses.

Mifepristone (not available in South Africa as EC) and levonorgestrel are very effective, with few adverse effects, and are preferred to combined <b>oestrogen</b> <b>and</b> <b>progestogen</b> administration. Levonorgestrel can be used in a single dose (1. 5 mg) instead of two doses (0. 75 mg) 12 hours apart. A Copper IUD can be retained for ongoing contraception. Despite the proven efficacy of ECP, increased access to ECPs enhances use but has not been shown to reduce unintended pregnancy rates at a population level. Further research is needed to explain this finding and to define the best ways to use EC to produce a public health benefit. Efforts should be targeted at vulnerable groups such as adolescents and women presenting for urgent care. At the time of the visit regular contraception should be promoted and initiated. Revie...|$|R
40|$|The risk {{of breast}} cancer arises from a {{combination}} of genetic susceptibility and environmental factors. Recent studies show that type and duration of use of hormone replacement therapy affect a women 2 ̆ 7 s risk of developing breast cancer. 1 - 7 The women 2 ̆ 7 s health initiative trial was stopped early because of excess adverse cardiovascular events and invasive breast cancer with <b>oestrogen</b> <b>and</b> <b>progestogen.</b> 6 The publicity increased public awareness of the risks of hormone replacement therapy, and this was heightened by the publication of the million women study. 2 However, the recently published oestrogen only arm of the women 2 ̆ 7 s health initiative trial suggests that this formulation may reduce the {{risk of breast}} cancer. 8 To help make sense of the often confusing information, 9 women and clinicians need individual rather than population risk data. We have produced estimates {{that can be used to}} calculate individual risk for women living up to the age of 79 and suggest the ris...|$|R
40|$|Breakthrough {{bleeding}} is {{a common}} problem in postmenopausal women taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and is often {{the single most important}} factor deterring women from continuing to use HRT, or from starting it in the first place. The mechanisms which underlie this unscheduled bleeding are poorly understood. The benefits of HRT in terms of longevity and quality of life are becoming increasingly apparent, and a greater under-standing of why this bleeding occurs and how we can prevent or treat it, will undoubtedly enable more women to reap the potential consid-erable benefits of long-term <b>oestrogen</b> <b>and</b> <b>progestogen</b> replacement. What sets post-menopausal women apart from their counter-parts in the mid-reproductive years is the increased likelihood of endometrial adenocarci-noma in which unscheduled bleeding is the presenting symptom. Therefore, spontaneous postmenopausal bleeding must always be appro-priately evaluated. Hence, the occurrence of unscheduled bleeding with HRT may provide a dilemma with diagnosis as well as a challenge to acceptability. Combined HRT regimens tend to be predominantly progestogenic, and there is increasing evidence to suggest that some of the vascular changes seen in women taking long-term, low-dose progestogen-only contraceptives may also occur in women taking HRT.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Oestrogen</b> <b>and</b> <b>progestogen</b> {{have the}} {{potential}} to influence gastro-intestinal motility; both are key components of hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Results of observational studies in women taking HRT rely on self-reporting of gastro-oesophageal symptoms and the aetiology of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) remains unclear. This study investigated the association between HRT and GORD in menopausal women using validated general practice records. Methods 51, 182 menopausal women were identified using the UK General Practice Research Database between 1995 – 2004. Of these, 8, 831 were matched with and without hormone use. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for GORD and proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) use in hormone and non-hormone users, adjusting for age, co-morbidities, and co-pharmacy. Results In unadjusted analysis, all forms of hormone use (oestrogen-only, tibolone, combined HRT <b>and</b> <b>progestogen)</b> were statistically significantly associated with GORD. In adjusted models, this association remained statistically significant for oestrogen-only treatment (OR 1. 49; 1. 18 – 1. 89). Unadjusted analysis showed a statistically significant association between PPI use and oestrogen-only and combined HRT treatment. When adjusted for covariates, oestrogen-only treatment was significant (OR 1. 34; 95 % CI 1. 03 – 1. 74). Findings from the adjusted model demonstrated the greater use of PPI by progestogen users (OR 1. 50; 1. 01 – 2. 22). Conclusions This first large cohort study of the association between GORD and HRT found a statistically significant association between oestrogen-only hormone and GORD and PPI use. This should be further investigated using prospective follow-up to validate the strength of association and describe its clinical significance. </p...|$|R
25|$|HRT is {{available}} in various forms. It generally provides low dosages {{of one or more}} estrogens, and often also provides either progesterone or a chemical analogue, called a progestin. Testosterone may also be included. Some HRT treatments such as Livial contain Tibolone, an anabolic steroid, that has the properties of <b>oestrogen,</b> <b>progestogen</b> <b>and</b> testosterone. Such treatments aren't usually recommended to women who are perimenopausal or for at least 12 months after the last menstrual period.|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} for hormone therapy to cause {{cancer is the}} greatest fear for postmenopausal women considering hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Breast cancer {{is the most common}} female malignancy, for which HRT is one of many modifiable risk factors, often attracting disproportionate attention. Randomized controlled trials have confirmed that in postmenopausal women aged 50 - 59 years taking combined <b>oestrogen</b> <b>and</b> <b>progestogen</b> HRT over 5 years, there will be three extra cases of breast cancer per 1000 women. With the use of unopposed conjugated equine oestrogens, there would be four fewer cases over the same time. Women can be advised that {{the risk of breast cancer}} is not significantly increased with up to 3 years of combined HRT and up to 5 years of unopposed oestrogen. Unopposed oestrogen increases the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma significantly, and this is dose and duration dependent. The addition of progestogen prevents the proliferative effect of oestrogen on the endometrium, and may even reduce the risk of endometrial cancer compared with non-users if given continuously. The use of combined oral contraception in premenopausal women also reduces the risk of endometrial cancer but increases the risk of cervical carcinoma significantly. HRT does not influence the risk of cervical cancer. Epithelial ovarian cancer risk may be slightly increased with long-term use of unopposed oestrogen, is not altered by the addition of <b>progestogen,</b> <b>and</b> is reduced significantly in users of combined oral contraception. The mechanism for these effects is not understood. Colorectal cancer and possibly lung and gastric cancers are reduced by the use of HRT. Apart from a slight increased risk of gallbladder disease and carcinoma with HRT, there are no data linking oestrogen or progestogen with any other malignancies...|$|R
40|$|Modern hormone {{replacement}} therapy (HRT) regimens contain <b>oestrogen</b> <b>and</b> <b>progestogen,</b> given either in a cyclical or continuous combined manner. Most endometrial biopsies from women on sequential HRT show weak secretory features. Approximately 15 % show proliferative activity, although this figure may be less if more than nine days of progestogen is given in each cycle. A small proportion will show an inactive or atrophic endometrium. Up to 50 % of biopsies from women on continuous combined HRT contain minimal endometrial tissue for histopathological analysis: this correlates well with an atrophic endometrium with no appreciable pathology. Of the 50 % with more substantial material, approximately one half will show endometrial atrophy, and one half will show weak secretory features. Proliferative, menstrual, and pseudodecidual changes are rare. Approximately 20 % of women given unopposed oestrogen for one year develop endometrial hyperplasia. The relative risk of endometrial carcinoma is two to three. This is dramatically reduced {{by the addition of}} progestogen to the regimen, but cyclical progestogen as part of a sequential HRT regimen does not completely eliminate the risk of carcinoma. The prevalence of endometrial hyperplasia associated with sequential HRT is 5. 4 %, and that of atypical hyperplasia (endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia) is 0. 7 %. Continuous combined HRT is not associated with the development of hyperplasia or carcinoma, and may normalise the endometrium of women who have developed complex hyperplasia on sequential HRT. The probability of a histopathologist finding clinically relevant pathology in an endometrial biopsy specimen of a patient on HRT is low and {{is more likely to be}} a manifestation of pre-existing disease...|$|R
40|$|Using {{behavioural}} {{and physiological}} measures, this thesis investigates behavioural effects of oestradiol, and {{of two of}} its synthetic analogues, mestranol and ethynyl oestradiol, in the female rat. Two types of behaviour receive particular attention, feeding and sexual behaviour. The first chapter describes some physiological and behavioural changes in the female rat over the oestrous cycle. Changes in meal size are seen during oestrus, or in ovariectomlzed rats treated with oestradiol. The effect of oestradiol on the gastric emptying of saline, glucose and fat loads was investigated (Chapter 2) to determine whether changes in stomach emptying were responsible for altered meal size. Only the emptying of fats from the stomachs of oestradiol treated rats was significantly reduced. The role of oestradiol in motivational processes associated with sexual behaviour was also examined (Chapter 3). It {{was found that the}} performance of females, running to sexually active or castrate males in a straight runway, depended on their oestrous state, and the gonadal condition of the males. These were independent and additive effects. The characteristics of the potent male that were rewarding to a female were then investigated by varying the odour and sexual activity of male rats (Chapter 4). The results suggest that both the odour and sexual activity of a potent male are rewarding to a female rat. Ethynyl oestradiol and mestranol are synthetic oestrogens nonnally used in oral contraceptives. The experiments presented in Chapter 5 show that in female rats both of these steroids reduced food intake reliably, and more than oestradiol. Ethynyl oestradiol, but not mestranol, stimulated sexual behaviour. Furthermore, there was no interaction between <b>oestrogen</b> <b>and</b> <b>progestogen</b> components of oral contraceptives which influenced, in any way, the behaviours observed in this study. The final chapter reviews the effects of oral contraceptives on mental, somatic and behavioural changes in women...|$|R
