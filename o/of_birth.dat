40|$|This work {{evaluates the}} impact of an {{abortion}} reform in Uruguay allowing free interruption of pregnancy until 12 weeks of gestation on {{the quantity and quality}} <b>of</b> <b>births</b> in the short run. We employ a differences-in-differences approach, a comprehensive administrative register <b>of</b> <b>births</b> and a novel identification strategy based on the planned or unplanned nature of pregnancies that end in births. Our results suggest that this policy induced an 8 % decline in the number <b>of</b> <b>births</b> <b>of</b> unplanned pregnancies, driven by the group of mothers between 20 and 34 years old with secondary education. This increased the average quality <b>of</b> <b>births</b> in terms <b>of</b> more intensive prenatal control care and a lower probability of having a single mother. Furthermore, we document a positive selection process <b>of</b> <b>births</b> affected by the reform, as adequate prenatal control care and Apgar scores rose among the affected demographic group...|$|R

In 2012, in eastern Germany 61.6% <b>of</b> <b>births</b> were to unmarried women, while in western Germany only 28.4% were.
