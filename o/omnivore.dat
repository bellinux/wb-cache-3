5|$|Although no {{specific}} {{studies have been}} done on the black catbird's feeding ecology, it is thought to be an <b>omnivore,</b> like its close relatives are. It is known to eat the fruits of Bursera simaruba and Ficus cotinifolia, two deciduous trees found in the Neotropics.|$|E
5|$|The curve-billed thrasher is an <b>omnivore.</b> Its diet {{includes}} invertebrates such as beetles, moths, butterflies, arachnids, and snails. It also eats vegetable matter, {{and fruits}} from cacti, prickly pear, hackberries, and anacua, among other plants. The curve-billed {{has also been}} spotted eating dog food, and will feed it to their chicks.|$|E
5|$|Typically, Othnielosaurus {{has been}} {{interpreted}} like other hypsilophodonts as a small, swift herbivore, although Bakker (1986) interpreted the possibly related Nanosaurus as an <b>omnivore.</b> This idea has had some unofficial support, but little in the formal literature; description of more complete skull remains {{will be needed to}} test this hypothesis.|$|E

5|$|The jays {{travel in}} groups of two to ten {{individuals}} and may join mixed-species flocks. It is a secretive species and therefore difficult to observe in the wild. As an <b>omnivore,</b> this jay eats berries, seeds, and small, dead animals. Females lay three to four eggs, and the young fledge after twenty days. This species is listed as Least Concern, meaning it is not threatened with extinction.|$|E
5|$|The thread-sail {{filefish}} is an <b>omnivore,</b> and can feed on plant or animal matter. Its diet includes kelp, but consists mainly of amphipods such as gammarids and skeleton shrimp, {{as well as}} the seagrass species Zostera marina. The fish also feeds upon smaller organisms, including bryozoans and some species of serpulid tube worms.|$|E
5|$|Lemur diets {{are highly}} {{variable}} and demonstrate {{a high degree}} of plasticity, although general trends suggest that the smallest species primarily consume fruit and insects (omnivory), while the larger species are more herbivorous, consuming mostly plant material. As with all primates, hungry lemurs might eat anything that is edible, whether or not the item is one of their preferred foods. For instance, the ring-tailed lemur eats insects and small vertebrates when necessary and as a result it is commonly viewed as an opportunistic <b>omnivore.</b> Coquerel's giant mouse lemur (Mirza coquereli) is mostly frugivorous, but will consume insect secretions during the dry season.|$|E

5|$|More than 1,400 gastroliths (stomach stones, 8 to 87mm in size) {{were found}} among the ribs and gastralia of {{specimen}} MPC-D100/127. The ratio of gastrolith mass to total weight, 0.0022, supports the theory that these gastroliths helped the toothless animals in grinding their food. Features such {{as the presence of}} a beak and a U-shaped, downturned jaw, are indicators of facultative (optional) herbivory among coelurosaurian theropods. In spite of these features, fish vertebrae and scales were also {{found among the}} gastroliths, which suggests that it was an <b>omnivore.</b> Ornithomimosaurs in general are thought to have fed on both plants and small animals.|$|E
5|$|The American {{black bear}} (Ursus americanus), {{among the largest}} animals along the Appalachian Trail, rarely confronts people. The black bear is the largest <b>omnivore</b> that may be {{encountered}} on the trail, and it inhabits all regions of the Appalachians. Bear sightings on the trail are uncommon, except in certain sections, especially Shenandoah National Park and portions of New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts sections, where bear populations have increased steadily since 1980; confrontations are rarer still.|$|E
5|$|The {{common earwig}} is an <b>omnivore,</b> eating plants and ripe fruit {{as well as}} {{actively}} hunting arthropods. To a large extent, this species is also a scavenger, feeding on decaying plant and animal matter if given the chance. Observed prey include largely plant lice, but also large insects such as bluebottle flies and woolly aphids. Plants that they feed on typically include clover, dahlias, zinnias, butterfly bush, hollyhock, lettuce, cauliflower, strawberry, blackberry, sunflowers, celery, peaches, plums, grapes, potatoes, roses, seedling beans and beets, and tender grass shoots and roots; they have also been known to eat corn silk, damaging the corn.|$|E

5|$|The high-crowned sudamericids were {{probably}} herbivores, but the lower-crowned Ferugliotherium was more probably an insectivore or <b>omnivore,</b> like similar multituberculates such as Mesodma, which {{is thought to}} have eaten insects, other arthropods, seeds, and/or nuts. It may have used its incisors for gnawing or slicing, and the blade-like p4 may also have been used for slicing hard plant parts, such as seeds. The wear patterns on Ferugliotherium teeth independently suggest that the animal may have eaten some plant material.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} mockingbird is an <b>omnivore.</b> It eats both insects and fruits. It is {{often found in}} open areas and forest edges but forages in grassy land. The {{northern mockingbird}} breeds in southeastern Canada, the United States, northern Mexico, the Bahamas, the Cayman Islands and the Greater Antilles. It is replaced further south by its closest living relative, the tropical mockingbird. The Socorro mockingbird, an endangered species, is also closely related, contrary to previous opinion. The northern mockingbird is listed as of Least Concern according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
5|$|The {{ring-tailed lemur}} is an {{opportunistic}} <b>omnivore</b> primarily eating fruits and leaves, {{particularly those of}} the tamarind tree (Tamarindus indica), known natively as kily. When available, tamarind makes {{up as much as}} 50% of the diet, especially during the dry, winter season. The ring-tailed lemur eats from as many as three dozen different plant species, and its diet includes flowers, herbs, bark and sap. It has been observed eating decayed wood, earth, spider webs, insect cocoons, arthropods (spiders, caterpillars, cicadas and grasshoppers) and small vertebrates (birds and chameleons). During the dry season it becomes increasingly opportunistic.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, I use {{data from}} the British Household Panel Survey and Understanding Society to {{investigate}} {{the social and political}} attitudes of cultural <b>omnivores.</b> I report a threefold typology of visual arts consumption that is consistent with previous research.

Specifically, <b>omnivores</b> are more trusting than visual arts inactives. They hold more favourable views about the European Union, and they tend to eschew subnational identities. <b>Omnivores</b> are ‘greener’, and are more liberal on gender role and homosexuality.

5|$|With its low-crowned teeth, Ferugliotherium {{may have}} been an {{insectivore}} or <b>omnivore,</b> like similar multituberculates such as Mesodma, which is thought to have eaten insects, other arthropods, seeds, and/or nuts. The wear on Ferugliotherium teeth suggests that the animal may have eaten some plant material. The high-crowned sudamericids are thought to have been herbivores feeding on abrasive vegetation, although their precise diet is not known. In the evolutionary history of gondwanatheres, hypsodont teeth are thought to have evolved from brachydont precursors. Gurovich hypothesizes that the anterior molariforms of sudamericids may have evolved from bladelike premolars as seen in Ferugliotherium.|$|E
5|$|Modern animal {{husbandry}} relies on production systems {{adapted to the}} type of land available. Subsistence farming is being superseded by intensive animal farming in the more developed parts of the world, where for example beef cattle are kept in high density feedlots, and thousands of chickens may be raised in broiler houses or batteries. On poorer soil such as in uplands, animals are often kept more extensively, and may be allowed to roam widely, foraging for themselves. Most livestock are herbivores, except for the pig which is an <b>omnivore.</b> Ruminants like cattle and sheep are adapted to feed on grass; they can forage outdoors, or may be fed entirely or in part on rations richer in energy and protein, such as pelleted cereals. Pigs and poultry cannot digest the cellulose in forage, and require cereals and other high-energy foods.|$|E
5|$|Othnielosaurus is a genus of ornithischian dinosaur {{that lived}} about 155to 148million years ago, during the Late Jurassic-age Morrison Formation {{of the western}} United States. It is {{named in honor of}} famed {{paleontologist}} Othniel Charles Marsh, and was formerly assigned to the genus Laosaurus. This genus was coined to hold fossils formerly included in Othnielia, which is based on remains that may be too sparse to hold a name; as such, it is part of decades of research to untangle the taxonomy left behind by Marsh and his rival Edward Drinker Cope from the Bone Wars. Othnielosaurus has usually been classified as a hypsilophodont, a type of generalized small bipedal herbivore or <b>omnivore,</b> although recent research has called this and the existence of a distinct group of hypsilophodonts into question.|$|E
40|$|Excessive {{oxidative}} stress and abnormal blood lipids may cause chronic diseases. This risk {{can be reduced}} by consuming an antioxidant- and fiber-rich vegetarian diet. We compared biomarkers of {{oxidative stress}}, antioxidant capacity, and lipid profiles of sex- and age-matched long-term vegetarians and <b>omnivores</b> in Korea. Forty-five vegetarians (23 men and 22 women; mean age, 49. 5 ± 5. 3 years), who had maintained a vegetarian diet {{for a minimum of}} 15 years, and 30 <b>omnivores</b> (15 men and 15 women; mean age, 48. 9 ± 3. 6 years) participated in this study. Their 1 -day, 24 -h recall, and 2 -day dietary records were analyzed. Oxidative stress was measured by the levels of diacron reactive oxygen metabolites (d-ROM). Antioxidant status was determined by the biological antioxidant potential (BAP) and levels of endogenous antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase. We observed that vegetarians had a significantly lower body fat percentage (21. 6 ± 6. 4 %) than that of <b>omnivores</b> (25. 4 ± 4. 6 %; P < 0. 004). d-ROM levels were significantly lower in vegetarians than those in <b>omnivores</b> (331. 82 ± 77. 96 and 375. 80 ± 67. 26 Carratelli units; P < 0. 011). Additionally, total cholesterol levels in the vegetarians and <b>omnivores</b> were 173. 73 ± 31. 42 mg/dL and 193. 17 ± 37. 89 mg/dL, respectively (P < 0. 018). Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was 101. 36 ± 23. 57 mg/dL and 120. 60 ± 34. 62 mg/dL (P < 0. 005) in the vegetarians and <b>omnivores,</b> respectively, indicating that vegetarians had significantly lower lipid levels. Thus, oxidative stress, body fat, and cholesterol levels were lower in long-term vegetarians than those in <b>omnivores...</b>|$|R

5|$|A {{study of}} the fossil remains of large {{carnivores}} from LaBrea pits dated 36,000–10,000YBP shows tooth breakage rates of 5–17% for the dire wolf, coyote, American lion, and Smilodon, compared to 0.5–2.7% for ten modern predators. These higher fracture rates were across all teeth, but the fracture rates for the canine teeth {{were the same as}} in modern carnivores. The dire wolf broke its incisors more often when compared to the modern gray wolf; thus, it has been proposed that the dire wolf used its incisors more closely to the bone when feeding. Dire wolf fossils from Mexico and Peru show a similar pattern of breakage. A 1993 study proposed that the higher frequency of tooth breakage among Pleistocene carnivores compared with living carnivores was not the result of hunting larger game, something that might be assumed from the larger size of the former. When there is low prey availability, the competition between carnivores increases, causing them to eat faster and thus consume more bone, leading to tooth breakage. As their prey became extinct around 10,000 years ago, so did these Pleistocene carnivores, except for the coyote (which is an <b>omnivore).</b>|$|E
5|$|The Australian raven is omnivorous, though eats more meat than smaller corvids. Its diet {{in summer}} {{contains}} {{a high proportion}} of insects, while more plant items are eaten in autumn. Flesh makes up over half its diet in winter. Invertebrates commonly eaten include spiders, millipedes, centipedes (which ravens behead before eating), grasshoppers, cicadas and caterpillars (especially of the family Noctuidae), which are important in feeding nestlings. Australian ravens sometimes eat yabbies (Cherax destructor) from the edges of dams. Unusually for a ground-feeding <b>omnivore,</b> earthworms are rarely eaten. Australian ravens have been reported killing birds of such size as young galahs (Eolophus roseicapillus) and starlings (Sturnus vulgaris). Most mammals are eaten as carrion, as many species are too large for the raven to kill, though young rabbits are a frequent prey item. Australian ravens drink water frequently, up to ten times a day in hot weather. Birds have been observed dunking pieces of meat in water before eating them, as well as doing the same with hard biscuits to make them soggy and soft.|$|E
5|$|To {{maintain}} a high constant body temperature is energy expensive – mammals therefore need a nutritious and plentiful diet. While the earliest mammals were probably predators, different species have since adapted {{to meet their}} dietary requirements {{in a variety of}} ways. Some eat other animals – this is a carnivorous diet (and includes insectivorous diets). Other mammals, called herbivores, eat plants, which contain complex carbohydrates such as cellulose. An herbivorous diet includes subtypes such as granivory (seed eating), folivory (leaf eating), frugivory (fruit eating), nectarivory (nectar eating), gummivory (gum eating) and mycophagy (fungus eating). The digestive tract of an herbivore is host to bacteria that ferment these complex substances, and make them available for digestion, which are either housed in the multichambered stomach or in a large cecum. Some mammals are coprophagous, consuming feces to absorb the nutrients not digested when the food was first ingested. An <b>omnivore</b> eats both prey and plants. Carnivorous mammals have a simple digestive tract because the proteins, lipids and minerals found in meat require {{little in the way of}} specialized digestion. Exceptions to this include baleen whales who also house gut flora in a multi-chambered stomach, like terrestrial herbivores.|$|E
40|$|The {{gastrointestinal}} microbiota produces short-chain fatty acids, especially butyrate, which affect colonic health, {{immune function}} and epigenetic regulation. To assess {{the effects of}} nutrition and aging on the production of butyrate, the butyryl-CoA:acetate CoA-transferase gene and population shifts of Clostridium clusters lV and XlVa, the main butyrate producers, were analysed. Faecal samples of young healthy <b>omnivores</b> (24 ± 2. 5 years), vegetarians (26 ± 5 years) and elderly (86 ± 8 years) <b>omnivores</b> were evaluated. Diet and lifestyle were assessed in questionnaire-based interviews. The elderly had significantly fewer copies of the butyryl-CoA:acetate CoA-transferase gene than young <b>omnivores</b> (P= 0. 014), while vegetarians showed {{the highest number of}} copies (P= 0. 048). The thermal denaturation of the butyryl-CoA:acetate CoA-transferase gene variant melting curve related to Roseburia/Eubacterium rectale spp. was significantly more variable in the vegetarians than in the elderly.

40|$|True <b>omnivores</b> {{that feed}} on both {{plant and animal}} tissues are not {{additive}} combinations of herbivore and predator (carnivore). Because true <b>omnivores</b> must distribute adaptive feeding decisions among two disparate tissue types, understanding the context that plants provide for foraging {{is important to understand}} their role in food webs. We varied prey and plant resources to investigate the plant context in an omnivorous true bug, Dicyphus hesperus. The contribution of plant species to fitness was unimportant in water acquisition decisions, but affected numbers of prey consumed over longer periods. In plant communities, in the absence of prey, D. hesperus moved to plants with the highest resource quality. Unlike pure predators facing declining prey, <b>omnivores</b> can use a nondepleting resource to fund future foraging without paying a significant cost. However, the dual resource exploitation can also impose significant constraints when both types of resources are essential. The presence of relatively profitable plants that are spatially separate from intermediate consumer populations could provide a mechanism to promote stability within food webs with plant-feeding <b>omnivores.</b> The effects of context in <b>omnivores</b> will require adding second-order terms to the Lotka-Volterra structure to explicitly account for the kinds of interactions we have observed here.
