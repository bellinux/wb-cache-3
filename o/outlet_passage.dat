Optimal mathematical models were established aiming at the least daily operation cost for pumping station system, which includes main pump units, inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>passages</b> and their accessories, forebay and outlet pond, auxiliary equipment, power transmission and transformation equipment, other electromechanical equipments and lightings. Also, head varying, time-varying electrical price, and blade adjusting frequency are all taken into account.

The results indicate that the operation cost is reduced by 5. 64 %∼ 12. 13 % by the optimal schemes considering time-varying electrical price and adjusting pump blade angles than that of conventional schemes, taking Jiangdu Forth Pumping Station in China as a case. The more the blade adjusting frequency, the less the operation cost. Also, if the blade adjusting frequency exceeds eight times, the optimum operation cost is close to be a const. Therefore, it is advisable to adjust blade angles four to six times a day to save operation cost and guarantee the reliability of pump units...|$|R

In this paper, a {{numerical}} method for three-dimensional {{flow in the}} <b>outlet</b> <b>passage</b> and the open channel of the pump stations, {{which can be used}} to calculate the flow field and get the hydrodynamic parameters in the passage, such as the flow losses, is obtained.

40|$|The study {{concentrates}} {{on the effects of}} structural parameters of an electronic fuel injector on its dynamic response (the opening delay and the closing delay). The injector was developed for a marine medium-speed diesel engine. The dynamic response {{from the start of the}} control signal to the end of the needle valve closing were investigated. Firstly, a complete and detailed model of the electronic fuel injector was built and integrated into an optimisation model, where a MOGA was applied. Secondly, the importance and effects of main structural parameters on dynamic response were examined, as were their interactions. Finally, a Pareto optimum was obtained through scattering charts and comparisons were made between the baseline design and the optimal design. Results show that the control piston diameter, fuel oil inlet passage diameter, fuel oil <b>outlet</b> <b>passage</b> diameter and their interactions are influential factors to the opening delay, while the fuel oil inlet passage diameter has the dominant effect on the closing delay. A small control piston diameter together with a small fuel oil inlet passage diameter contribute to a short opening delay, however, they lead to a significant increase in the closing delay. Moreover, a small closing delay prefers a large fuel oil inlet passage diameter. The selected Pareto optimum achieved a significant reduction in both the opening delay and the closing delay under three different rail pressures...|$|E

50|$|The {{stator core}} is built with lamination's of cold rolled {{grain-oriented}} sheet steel 0.013 in (0.033cm) thick, insulated {{from each other}} with insuline. The number of segments per circle is arranged so that the maximum practical percentage of core flux is {{in the direction of}} the oriented grain. The rings of lamination's are built into a skeleton frame which is flexibly supported inside the main stator frame to prevent double-frequency vibrations being transmitted to the foundations. Axial gas passages are provided within the core by holes punched in the lamination's, which line up throughout its length. The ends of the core are divided axially by spacers into a number of radial ducts. These ducts form the gas inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>passages</b> for the axial gas passages. Separate radial ducts feed the extreme ends of the core with cold gas to cater for the increased heating experienced at the core ends during leading power factor operation. Each coil side of the stator winding consists of rectangular copper tubes, each tube being insulated with resin-impregnated glass braid, and the tubes are transposed within the coil length by the Roebel method to minimise stray copper losses. Inlet and outlet manifolds are arranged at opposite ends of the windings and all coil sides are fed in parallel from these. The water connections between the manifolds and coil sides are made with flexible hoses of insulating material. The electrical connections between coil sides consist of flexible copper straps, bolted and sweated to contact blocks which are brazed to the conductor tubes near to the end of each coil side. The rings used to connect up the phase groups to the terminals are also water cooled, the flow through these being in parallel with the flow through the coil sides.|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{demands for}} {{high-performance}} screw pumps {{in oil and}} gas {{as well as other}} applications require deep understanding of the fluid flow field inside the machine. Important effects on the performance such as dynamic losses, influence of the leakage gaps and presence and extent of cavitation are difficult to observe by experiments. However, it is possible to study such effects using well-validated computational fluid dynamics models. The novel-structured numerical mesh consisting of a single-computational domain for moving screw pump rotors was developed to allow three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics simulation of such machine possible. Based on finite volume method, the instantaneous mass flow rates, rotor torque, local pressure field, velocity field and other performance indicators including the indicated power were predicted. A calculation model for the bearing friction losses was introduced to account for mechanical losses. The geometry of the inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>passages</b> and piping system are taken into consideration to evaluate their influences on the pressure distribution and shaft power. The paper also shows the influence of rotor clearances on the pump performance. The computational fluid dynamics model was validated by comparing the numerical results with the measured performance obtained in the experimental test rig through the comprehensive experiment performed for a set of discharge pressures and rotational speeds. Validation includes comparison of mass flow rates, shaft power and efficiency under variety of speeds and discharge pressure. It has been found that the predicted results match well with the measurements. The results also showed that the radial clearances have larger influence on the mass flow rate than the interlobe clearance. The correct design of the flow passages within the screw pump plays significant role in minimizing required power consumption. The analysis presented in this paper contributes to better understanding of the working process inside the screw pump and offers a good reference to improve design and optimize such machines in terms of clearance selection, shape of the ports, piping system, etc. In future, this model will be used for analysis of cavitating flows and determining performance of other multiphase screw pumps...|$|R

Fluid results showed that flow in the <b>outlet</b> flow <b>passage</b> {{was a combination of}} the axial flow and circumferential rotation motion. Time and frequency domain analysis of pressure pulsation of typical measure points indicated that larger pulsation amplitudes appeared in the tip of the blades and the main vibration source was the pressure pulsation induced by rotation of the blades. The fluid pulsation amplitudes decreased gradually along the flow direction, which can be ascribed to the function of fixed guide vane. Structural analysis of the blades in both pressure and suction side indicated that significant stress concentration was formed at the blade and hub connection near the leading edge. Maximum effective stress of the blades varied periodically, so prevention measures of the fatigue of blades should be taken. This research can provide important reference for the design of the tubular pump...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Road and stream intersections {{require a}} {{crossing}} that allows safe passage {{of water and}} vehicles. Culverts are normally used when roads cross small streams. Recently, passage of aquatic organisms through culverts has received increased attention. We used a geographic information system (GIS) analysis to determine the degree of salamander habitat fragmentation in Tucker and Randolph counties in West Virginia, USA. We visited state roads with culverts and categorized salamander barriers as complete, partial, or nonbarrier, based on outlet hang, culvert slope, and substrate. Complete barriers occurred at 55. 0 % of the sites visited and partial barriers at 34. 2 %. We found that 20. 6 % of the total stream length in the Dry Fork watershed and 18. 4 % in the Shavers Fork watershed were isolated by at least a partial barrier. Outlet hang height and the presence (or absence) of streambed substrate were the main determinants of stream salamander <b>passage.</b> <b>Outlet</b> hang {{was positively correlated with}} stream gradient and culvert slope. Culverts containing streambed substrate occurred on lower gradient streams, had lower culvert slope, and had a greater width compared to culverts lacking substrate.

60|$|If {{the surplus}} of water upon the Abyssinian {{mountains}} had been constant and uniform, the stream, in its passage across the desert, would have communicated very little fertility to the barren sands which it traversed. The immediate banks of the river would have, perhaps, been fringed with verdure, but {{the influence of the}} irrigation would have extended no farther than the water itself could have reached, by percolation through the sand. But the flow of the water is not thus uniform and steady. In a certain season of the year the rains are incessant, and they descend with such abundance and profusion as almost to inundate the districts where they fall. Immense torrents stream down the mountain sides; the valleys are deluged; plains turn into morasses, and morasses into lakes. In a word, the country becomes half submerged, and the accumulated mass of waters would rush with great force and violence down the central valley of the desert, which forms their only <b>outlet,</b> if the <b>passage</b> were narrow, and if it made any considerable descent in its course to the sea. It is, however, not narrow, and the descent is very small. The depression in the surface of the desert, through which the water flows, is from five to ten miles wide, and, though it is nearly two thousand miles from the rainy district across the desert to the sea, the country for the whole distance is almost level. There is only sufficient descent, especially for the last thousand miles, to determine a very gentle current to the northward in the waters of the stream.|$|R
40|$|This study {{assessed}} {{differences in}} fish assemblages existing {{upstream and downstream}} two types of culverts, one on each of two different Neotropical streams. We analyzed the composition {{and structure of the}} ichthyofauna and tested for spatial patterns. Fish sampling was carried out monthly between November 2009 and October 2010 using different fishing gears. We collected 2, 220 fish of 33 species; 901 in stretches of the Lopeí stream - circular culvert and 1, 310 in stretches of the Pindorama stream - box culvert. Fish abundance was similar in upstream and downstream stretches of the circular culvert, whereas it was slightly higher in the upstream than downstream stretch for the box culvert. Characiformes predominated in the upstream stretch of both culverts. On the other hand, Siluriformes was abundant in the downstream stretch of the circular culvert, with similar abundance in the stretches of the box culvert. Species richness and diversity (Shannon-Weiner Index) were higher in the downstream stretch of the circular culvert, but they were similar in both stretches of the box culvert. The most abundant species were Astyanax altiparanae, A. paranae, A. fasciatus, Ancistrus sp., and Hypostomus sp. The last two species were more abundant in the downstream stretch of the circular culvert, and similar in stretches of the box culvert. Our study indicated variations in the species abundance, richness, and diversity between upstream and downstream stretches in particular of the circular culvert in the Lopeí stream, suggesting that fish movements are restrained more intensively in this culvert, especially for Siluriformes. The drop in the circular culvert <b>outlet</b> probably created <b>passage</b> barriers especially for those fish that has no ability to jump, where downstream erosion could lead to culvert perching.

40|$|In {{the month}} of July 1997, 38 {{culverts}} suspected of blocking upstream passage of juvenile salmonids were inventoried on the Hoonah Ranger District. Attributes measured included species/numbers of fish upstream and downstream of each culvert, in addition to physical characteristics such as outlet barrier height, culvert gradient, and upstream habitat. Thirty culverts exhibited some form of physical impediment (excessive barrier height and/or gradient) to the upstream migration of juvenile salmonids. Of the 30 barrier culverts, {{the height of the}} lower lip of the culvert outlet above the streambed ranged from 0 cm to 205 cm and averaged 36. 5 cm. The gradient of these structures ranged from – 0. 5 percent to 14. 5 percent and averaged 5. 0 percent. Thirteen Class I (anadromous) culverts were sampled, of which nine lacked juvenile coho upstream of the culvert (no juvenile steelhead trout were trapped during the study). Boxplots of number of juvenile salmon trapped upstream of culverts relate a considerable reduction in distribution, median, and mean as compared to downstream. All 13 culverts exhibited an outlet perched above the streambed, with barrier heights ranging from 10 cm to 99 cm, averaging 38. 8 cm. Class I culvert gradient ranged from 0. 5 percent to 9. 5 percent and averaged 3. 4 percent. Nineteen culverts were identified as Class II culverts (i. e., culverts in streams providing cutthroat trout and Dolly Varden charr habitat occupied upstream of anadromous habitat) during the survey, of which 17 exhibited some physical form of barrier to juvenile <b>passage.</b> <b>Outlet</b> barrier heights ranged from 0 cm to 205 cm, averaging 37. 2 cm. Culvert gradient ranged from 2. 0 percent to 9. 0 percent and averaged 4. 3 percent. Eight of the 19 Class II culverts had resident fish species trapped upstream of the culvert, six of which occurred above culverts exhibiting barrier characteristics such as outlet perch or excessive gradient. Boxplot distribution, median, and mean of height of outlet barrier and culvert gradient tended to be greater at Class I and Class II structures without fish trapped upstream as compared to culverts where fish were trapped upstream. This pattern was repeated for culvert length at Class I crossings, but was reversed for Class II structures. Overall, barrier culverts resulted in a loss of 8. 11 km (16, 534 m 2) of fish habitat, comprised of 2. 68 km (6, 408 m 2) of Class I and 5. 42 km (10, 126 m 2) Class II habitat. Habitat lost per culvert at Class I crossings was 206 m (493 m 2 by area), and 319 m (596 m 2 by area) for Class II culverts. Roughly 37 % of Class I fish habitat lost (determined by length) was of high-quality Floodplain process group reaches with an additional 47 percent comprised of moderate-quality Moderate Gradient–Mixed Control reaches. Class II habitat lost comprised about 41 percent Mixed-Moderate reaches, followed by 32 percent High Gradient-Contained and 17 percent Alluvial Fan process group reaches, both providing relatively low-quality fish habitat...|$|R
