40|$|This paper {{presents}} a state-of-art review of empirical research on object-oriented (OO) design. Many {{claims about the}} cognitive benefits of the OO paradigm {{have been made by}} its advocates. These claims concern the ease of designing and reusing software at the individual level as well as the benefits of this paradigm at the team level. Since these claims are cognitive in nature, its seems important to assess them empirically. After a brief presentation of the main concepts of the OO paradigm, the claims about the superiority of OO design are outlined. The core of this paper consists of a review of empirical studies of OOD. We first discuss results concerning OOD by individuals. On the basis of empirical work, we (1) analyse the design activity of novice OO designers, (2) compare OO design with procedural design and, (3) discuss a typology of problems relevant for the OO approach. Then we assess the claims about naturalness and ease of OO design. The next part discusses results on OO software reuse. On the basis of empirical work, we (1) compare reuse in the OO versus procedural paradigm, (2) discuss the potential for OO software reuse and (3) analyse reuse activity in the OO paradigm. Then we assess claims on reusability. The final part reviews empirical work on OO design by teams. We present results on communication, coordination, knowledge dissemination and interactions with clients. Then we assess claims about <b>OOD</b> <b>at</b> the software design team level. In a general conclusion, we discuss the limitations of these studies and give some directions for future research...|$|E

40|$|The Barotse Floodplain, a {{designated}} Ramsar site, {{is home to}} thousands of indigenous people along with an extensive wetland ecosystem and food production system. Increasingly {{it is also a}} popular tourist destination with its annual Kuomboka festival which celebrates the relocation of the king and the Lozi people to higher ground before the onset of the ood season. This paper presents an integrated approach which cross validates and combines the oodplain residents' perceptions about recent oods with information on ood inundation levels derived from satellite observations. Local residents' surveys were conducted to assess farmers’ perception on the ooding patterns and the impact on their livelihoods. Further, a series of ood inundation maps from 1989 to 2014 generated from remotely sensed Landsat imagery were used to assess the recent patterns of oods. Results show that the oodplain has a population of 33 thousand living in 10, 849 small permeant or temporary buildings with a total cropland area of 4976 ha. The oodplain hydrologyand ooding patterns have changed, con rmed by both surveys and satellite image analysis, due to catchment development and changing climate. The average annual inundated areas have increased from about 316 thousand ha in 1989 e 1998 to 488 thousand ha in 2005 e 2014. As a result the inundated cropland and houses increased from 9 % to 6 % in 1989 to 73 % and 47 % in 2014, respectively. The timing of the oods has also changed with both delaying and early onset happening more frequently. These changes cause increasing dif culties in ood forecast and preparation using indigenous knowledge, therefore creating greater damages to crops, livestock, and houses. Current oodplain management system is inadequate and new interventions are needed to help manage the <b>oods</b> <b>at</b> a systematic manner...|$|R
40|$|This updated {{study focused}} on the methodologies, tools, and {{applications}} {{used to evaluate the}} hydrologic runoff potential of a burned watershed when few variables were actually measured. Forest fi res often alter the balance between rainfall and the resulting runoff from natural watersheds. This may result in fl ooding from the burned watershed at locations downstream. Such was the case for the Mud Canyon watershed on New Mexico’s Mescalero Apache Indian Reservation. In the spring, a fi re burned approxi-mately 42 % of the watershed. Subsequent storms during the summer caused fl ows in Mud Canyon that led to fl <b>ooding</b> downstream <b>at</b> the town of Mescalero. The fl ooding was likely the result of inadequate remediation, neither human nor natural, during the months between the fi re and the storms. While the summer storms that followed the spring fi re had an updated magnitude to be expected every 10 years, the resulting updated fl ooding was more on the order of a 500 -year event. A {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the amount of rainfall that produced the estimated fl ood fl ows. This result could then be used to determine the degree to which the burned portion of the watershed caused the fl ooding. The Burned Area Emergency Rehabilitation (BAER) Plan concluded that there was not a serious threat of fl ooding, based on the fact that the soils in the watershed were well-drained and not hydrophobic. The paper conclude...|$|R
40|$|It is {{increasingly}} acknowledged that a careful planning of urban areas {{is needed to}} cope with the negative effects of future climate changes. The planning process calls for fi nding a balance between various ecosystem services, such as, water and air purifi cation, the regulation of rainfall, the preservation of natural and cultural values, increased fl <b>ood</b> risk, while <b>at</b> the same time providing ample space for societal demands in relation to residences, employment and recreation. In this paper we focus on the possibilities of adapting land in urban areas {{in such a way that}} possible negative effects of climate change, in particular fl ooding, are reduced as much as possible. We will illustrate this with a case-study in the Netherlands, using a GIS-based land-use simulation model in combination with a fl ood damage assessment module. This combination of tools is applied in a regional planning context to optimise land-use patterns taking into account fl ood risk and other water management issues...|$|R
40|$|Natural hazards {{assessment}} concerning Civil Protection {{is crucial}} for emergency situations prevention and mitigation. Among the natural hazards affecting the district of Oporto the landslides and the ?ash ?oods are {{over the last years}} those which presented hazard, mainly resulting from the increase of the human action on territory. Using Arcgis 9. 1 ’s tools we’ve developed a Geodatabase joining cartographic information and related attributes concerning 3 main themes: historic information from ?oods (2002 - 2004) and landslides occurrences (1996 - 2006); conditioning factors (geomorphologic, hydrologic and lithologic) as well as triggering factors (human or hidrogeomorphologic). Several conditioning factors were normalized and weighed in 3 D Analyst e Spatial Analyst extensions in order to assess landslides and ?ash ?<b>oods</b> hazard <b>at</b> 1 : 50 000 scale. In landslide susceptibility assessment were considered factors such as lithology, morphology as geomorphologic dynamics. Concerning ?ash ?oods were pondered extreme precipitations, slope, lithology and morphological elements. Greater landslide susceptibility is registered in mountainous and intermediate relief areas {{in the eastern part of}} the district (along Douro’s Valley), at Valongo’s quartzite crests and at metamorphic hillslopes. Referring to ?ash ?oods larger susceptibility is located in mountainous areas where natural factors prevail. At the urban areas the human intervention plays a major role. It will be crucial to extend the occurrences database comprising a larger temporal range, producing natural hazard’s susceptibility cartography at a detailed scale, mainly in urban areas. This will contributes to build a District and Municipal base to Civil Protection work?ow and give the support instruments for land management at several intervention scales...|$|R

The game engine and editor are made with an Entity Component System architecture and with the technologies WinRt, DirectX and WIC, XAML was used to do the editor's GUI. The programming language used was C++, the IDE was Visual Studio Express 2013 and the target OS is Windows 8. The Direct X Game and Direct X and XAML App templates from Visual Studio Express 2013 were used as the base for the game engine and game engine's editor, respectively. In this memory it is explained concepts like Entity Component System and how it was applied to this project. The Entity Component System is initially explained from a Object Oriented Design perspective. Then, there's a little break from ECS, and there is a section about "the ability to deal with the cache of the computer of an <b>OOD</b> system". <b>At</b> the end, during the explanation of the implementation of the ECS, these two themes are brought together. Also, there are a few components of the engine that are explained more deeply. These components are the Graphic Engine and the Physic Engine. The Graphic Engine follows a simple approach that consist on using a Camera, and drawing everything that is inside that Camera. The Physic Engine follows a "not so traditional" approach. Basically, it updates every game object in the Y axis and then the collisions are managed, then it does the same but in the X axis. Also, the design done to create the ECS is explained. Which Components where made, how the Processors handle them and the Assemblages to generate more Entities. To create a game there are two steps. Firstly create it with the game engine's editor. Secondly, save it with the editor, the result will be a. txt file. Thirdly and finally, add that file to the game engine project, change the program to use that file and play the game engine...|$|R
40|$|The {{settlement}} of Gorgo del Ciliegio (Sansepolcro-Arezzo) is situated on an ancient terrace {{on the left}} bank of the Afra Creek, at about 400 metres above sea level, near-by the tuscan-emilian Appennines divide. During the six last years (2001 - 2006) an area of approximately 178 square meters was investigated, resulting in the fi ndings of a living fl oor with several structures (pole holes, combustion structures, pits of different typology), including a small food oven of particular interest. The pottery retrieved from the deposit is represented by cylindrical, troncoconic and globular vessels, among which milk boilers are present, carinated shapes (bowls, cups) and some sherds decorated in the Appennine styles, which has allowed for the attribution of the site to an early phase of the Middle Bronze 3 (BM 3). The Middle Bronze Age people settled on a preserved portion of an alluvial surface (T 1 a) standing about 10 meters higher than the coeval active channel of the Afra Creek, whose deposits are bounded by the surface T 2. This location ensured a relative protection from fl <b>oods</b> being, <b>at</b> the same time, close to a large water source. Sedimentological features of the alluvial gravels bounded on top by T 1 a and T 2 surfaces, suggest a significantly different fl uvial style during the late Holocene compared to the modern Afra Creek. Before (e. g. T 1 a deposits) and during (e. g. T 2 deposits) the human occupation at this site, the Afra Creek was characterized by a relatively wide (about 150 meters) valley with multiple shallow channels inside, fi lled by gravels. This style {{can be observed in}} some modern creeks of the Upper Tiber River basin, indicating local condition of channel overfilling. On the whole this ancient style contrasts with the modern one in which a few tens meter wide Afra Creek is deeply entrenched in the bedrock and still affected by erosive processes. Despite the different valley morphology attained during the late Holocene, the terracing of the Afra Creek recorded at the site, attests to successive readjustment of the river profile to repeated perturbation of base level possibly due to the active tectonic setting of the Upper Tiber River valley. The preliminary results of the archeozoological study demonstrate that the inhabitants of Gorgo del Ciliegio were involved in the rearing of mostly sheep-goats and pigs and cattle in the second place, and in the hunting of deer and roe-deer; domestic dogs were present on the site. Such a pattern and the geographic location of the site, might suggest that Gorgo del Ciliegio community mostly practised mobile pastoralism and the dogs may have been kept to assist with herding the animals. Preliminary pollen analysis of the archaeological soil, reveals a scarcity and a bad preservation of the pollen grains possibly due to a highly acidic environment. Nevertheless, few grains of Urticaceae point to local anthropic impact on the vegetation cover, fully consistent with the settlement activity...|$|R
