5|$|A Non-constituency Member of Parliament ("NCMP") is a {{candidate}} of an opposition political party who, despite having lost in a general election, is declared elected as a Member of the Parliament of Singapore ("MP") by virtue of provisions in the Constitution and the Parliamentary Elections Act enabling the unsuccessful candidates who have performed the best to be accorded the status. The MP is so called because he <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not represent any constituency (or electoral division) in Parliament.|$|E
5|$|A {{leader of}} a party is chosen by the party, {{following}} an internal constitution unique to each party that comprises a framework to elect or appoint a leader. The leader, if he <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not already have a seat, must then win a seat in a by-election or general election {{to sit in the}} Assembly. If a {{leader of a}} party does not have a seat, he or she must sit in the legislature gallery. While sitting in the gallery a premier cannot exercise any legislative powers.|$|E

If the person submitted a community declaration that did not include an application for a community certificate, {{he or she must}} submit the Community Committee's written acceptance of the declaration and a statutory declaration that he <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not consider himself or herself a member of the Chinese community, Malay community, or Indian or other minority communities.|$|E
5|$|Medical fitness to dive is {{the medical}} and {{physical}} suitability of a diver to function safely in the underwater environment using underwater diving equipment and procedures. Depending on the circumstances it may be established by a signed statement by the diver that he <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not suffer {{from any of the}} disqualifying conditions and is able to manage the ordinary physical requirements of diving, by a detailed medical examination by a physician registered as a medical examiner of divers following a prescribed procedural checklist, attested by a legal document of fitness to dive issued by the medical examiner and recorded on a national database, or by alternatives between these extremes.|$|E
5|$|GRCs {{have been}} criticized as {{creating}} unequal voting powers between electors. At present, one vote in a GRC ward returns five or six candidates into Parliament, compared with one vote in a SMC ward, which only returns one candidate. The GRC scheme has also diluted electors' voting power. For instance, in an SMC ward there are around 14,000 voters, compared to 140,000 voters in a five- or six-member GRC. Thus, the power of each vote in a GRC is lower than in an SMC, as each voter in a GRC finds it harder to vote out an MP that he <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not like. The situation {{is compounded by the}} fact that a 30% deviation from equality of electoral divisions is tolerated. Another commentator has pointed out that the current MP-to-voter guide ratio is one MP to 26,000 voters, which implies that the number of voters in an electoral division can vary between 18,200 and 33,800. By extrapolation, a five-member GRC can have between 91,000 and 169,000 voters, a difference of 86%.|$|E

25|$|Next, the Court {{found that}} fair {{criticism}} {{should not be}} limited to criticism raised through formal legal avenues, which include court proceedings and the removal of judges under Article 98(3) of the Constitution. This limitation overburdens the right of free speech, and a person should not be prevented from raising rationally supported criticism simply because he <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not have access to formal avenues.|$|E
25|$|At common law, no {{judge of}} a {{superior}} court or inferior court is liable in damages if acting within jurisdiction, {{even if he}} <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> so maliciously. Further, no judge of a superior court is liable for an act done outside jurisdiction, provided that this {{was done by the}} judge in the honest belief that the act was within jurisdiction. Liability only attaches in such cases if the judge knowingly acts outside jurisdiction.|$|E

25|$|The risk {{of stroke}} {{increases}} exponentially from 30 years of age, {{and the cause}} varies by age. Advanced age {{is one of the}} most significant stroke risk factors. 95% of strokes occur in people age 45 and older, and two-thirds of strokes occur in those over the age of 65. A person's risk of dying if he <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> have a stroke also increases with age. However, stroke can occur at any age, including in childhood.|$|E
25|$|According to Article 10 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, {{individuals}} {{have the right}} to a fair trial. Therefore, in the name of fairness of judicial proceedings, it is an established linguistic right of an individual to an interpreter when he <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not understand the language used in criminal court proceedings, or in a criminal accusation. The public authorities must either use the language which the individual understands, or hire an interpreter to translate the proceedings, including court cases.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, Pandora Media Inc. {{began as}} Savage Beast Technologies, and {{was founded by}} Will Glaser, Jon Kraft and Tim Westergren. The idea {{was to create a}} separate, {{individualized}} radio station for each user, with music that the user prefers without music that he <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not prefer. The company quickly ran through its initial $2 million in funding, running out of money by 2001. Founder Tim Westergren then convinced Pandora's 50 employees of the company to work for two years without pay.|$|E

25|$|A player must {{establish}} an Apple ID {{to associate with}} a Game Center nickname. A player has the option to create an Apple ID from within Game Center if he <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not already have one. Only one nickname {{may be associated with}} an Apple ID at any given time. Each player is assigned a profile in Game Center. A profile consists of the player's nickname, the number of Game Center-compatible games the player owns, the number of friends the player has, the number of achievement points a player has, and an optional photo and player-defined status.|$|E
25|$|Normally, a {{condition}} of the application process is that the appointed interim councillor does not run as a candidate in the next regular election, so that he <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not gain an unfair incumbency advantage. There have, nonetheless, been instances in which appointed interim councillors have tested the rule; most recently, Paul Ainslie did so in 2006 by running for re-election in a different ward than the one {{where he had been}} appointed. Peter Leon considered registering as a candidate in the 2014 election following his appointment as an interim councillor in 2013, but ultimately did not do so.|$|E
25|$|Fitness to dive, (also {{medical fitness}} to dive), is {{the medical and}} {{physical}} suitability of a diver to function safely in the underwater environment using underwater diving equipment and procedures.

50|$|An {{important}} caveat {{to this is}} {{that the}} player gets one extra free pass for every 1,000 points scored. So, if a player were at 2,000 points and had not yet let any cattle pass, then he <b>or</b> <b>she</b> would be allowed to let four cattle pass before the fifth one ended the game (assuming he <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not reach 3,000).|$|R

25|$|The {{examining}} magistrate then presents the dossier detailing {{his or her}} findings {{to the president of}} the bench that will adjudicate on the case where it has been decided that a trial shall be conducted. Therefore, the president of the bench's view of the case is not neutral and may be biased while conducting the trial after the reading of the dossier. Unlike the common law proceedings, the president of the bench in the inquisitorial system is not merely an umpire and is entitled to directly interview the witnesses or express comments during the trial, as long as he <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not express his or her view on the guilt of the accused.|$|E
25|$|All people {{resident}} in Switzerland are {{liable for the}} taxation of their worldwide income and assets, except on the income and wealth from foreign business or real estate, or where tax treaties limit double taxation. For tax purposes, residence may also arise if a person stays in Switzerland for 30 days, or for 90 days if he <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not work. Moreover, non-residents are also taxed on certain Swiss assets or on the income from certain Swiss sources, such as from real estate, permanent business establishments or pensions. The income and assets of spouses are pooled and taxed jointly, but at a lower rate to offset the effects of tax progression.|$|E
5000|$|UNICEF defines {{child labour}} differently. A child, {{suggests}} UNICEF, {{is involved in}} child labour activities if between 5 and 11 years of age, he <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> at least one hour of economic activity or at least 28 hours of domestic work in a week, and in case of children between 12 and 14 years of age, he <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> at least 14 hours of economic activity or at least 42 hours of economic activity and domestic work per week. UNICEF in another report suggests, [...] "Children’s work needs {{to be seen as}} happening along a continuum, with destructive or exploitative work at one end and beneficial work promoting or enhancing children’s development without interfering with their schooling, recreation and rest at the other. And between these two poles are vast areas of work that need not negatively affect a child’s development." ...|$|R
