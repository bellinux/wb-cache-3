5|$|In {{an address}} to the troops after the battle, Chetwode {{expressed}} his appreciation for the mounted rifle and light horse method of attack.

5|$|Many {{different}} types and sizes of horse {{were used in}} war, depending on the form <b>of</b> <b>warfare.</b> The type used varied with whether the horse was being ridden or driven, and whether they were being used for reconnaissance, cavalry charges, raiding, communication, or supply.

5|$|The JNA was {{initially}} formed during World War II {{to carry out}} guerrilla warfare against occupying Axis forces. The success of the Partisan movement led to the JNA basing much of its operational strategy on guerrilla warfare, as its plans normally entailed defending against NATO or Warsaw Pact attacks, where other types <b>of</b> <b>warfare</b> would put the JNA in a comparatively poor position. That approach led to maintenance of a Territorial Defense system.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the Middle Ages, the {{functions}} and composition of households started to change. This was due primarily to two factors. First of all, the introduction of gunpowder to the field <b>of</b> <b>warfare</b> rendered the castle a less effective defence, and did away with the military function of the household. The result was a household more focused on comfort and luxury, and with a significantly larger proportion of women.|$|E

5|$|After {{the end of}} hostilities, I Corps was {{assigned}} to occupation duty in Japan. On 19 September 1945 the corps, with the assigned 33rd Infantry Division, sailed from Lingayen Gulf for Japan, landing {{on the island of}} Honshū on 25 September, three weeks after Japan's formal surrender. The next few years were a period during which the terms of the surrender were supervised and enforced; Japanese military installations and material were seized, troops were disarmed and discharged, and weapons <b>of</b> <b>warfare</b> disposed of. The duties of the occupation force included conversion of industry, repatriation of foreign nationals, and supervision of the complex features of all phases of Japanese government, economics, education, and industry.|$|E
5|$|Around 1785BC, as {{the power}} of the Middle Kingdom pharaohs weakened, a Western Asian people called the Hyksos had already settled in the Eastern Delta town of Avaris, seized control of Egypt, and forced the central {{government}} to retreat to Thebes. The pharaoh was treated as a vassal and expected to pay tribute. The Hyksos ("foreign rulers") retained Egyptian models of government and identified as pharaohs, thus integrating Egyptian elements into their culture. They and other invaders introduced new tools <b>of</b> <b>warfare</b> into Egypt, most notably the composite bow and the horse-drawn chariot.|$|E

He set the initial focus towards the employment of manoeuvre type doctrine. Corbett's principles of sea control, focus on the enemy, and manoeuvre for tactical advantage form the foundation of today's naval manoeuvre warfare.|$|R
5|$|During the Late Classic {{there was}} greater {{public access to}} the acropolis; as the threat <b>of</b> <b>warfare</b> grew during the Terminal Classic (AD 800-900), access became much more restricted. The end of formal {{occupation}} {{of the city in}} the Terminal Classic appears to have been violent, with evidence of a battle recovered during excavations of the acropolis. Refugees appear to have occupied the city centre immediately after the collapse of formal settlement at La Blanca, but they abandoned the city for good in the 11th century, after which it was never reoccupied.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Roman {{soldiers}} seem to {{have been}} modelled after those of the Etruscans to the north, who themselves are believed to have copied their style <b>of</b> <b>warfare</b> from the Greeks. Traditionally, the introduction of the phalanx formation into the Roman army is ascribed to the city's penultimate king, Servius Tullius (ruled 578 to 534 BC). According to Livy and Dionysius of Halicarnassus, the front rank was composed of the wealthiest citizens, who were able to purchase the best equipment. Each subsequent rank consisted of those with less wealth and poorer equipment than the one before it.|$|E
5|$|Edward I {{became the}} king of England in 1272. Edward had {{extensive}} experience <b>of</b> <b>warfare</b> and sieges, having fought in Wales in 1257, led the six-month siege of Kenilworth Castle in 1266 and joined the crusade to North Africa in 1270. He had seen numerous European fortifications, including the planned walled town and castle design at Aigues-Mortes. On assuming the throne, one of Edward's first actions was to renovate and extend the royal fortress of the Tower of London. Edward was also responsible for building a sequence of planned, usually walled, towns called bastides across Gascony {{as part of his}} attempt to strengthen his authority in the region. Edward also authorised new planned towns to be built across England.|$|E

5000|$|The history <b>of</b> guerrilla <b>warfare</b> {{stretches}} back {{to ancient}} history. While guerrilla tactics {{can be viewed}} as a natural continuation <b>of</b> prehistoric <b>warfare,</b> the Chinese general and strategist Sun Tzu, in his The Art of War (6th century BCE), was the earliest to propose the use <b>of</b> guerrilla <b>warfare.</b> This directly inspired the development of modern guerrilla warfare.; Communist leaders like Mao Zedong and North Vietnamese Ho Chi Minh both implemented guerrilla warfare in the style of Sun Tzu, which served as a model for similar strategies elsewhere, such as the Cuban [...] "foco" [...] theory and the anti-Soviet Mujahadeen in Afghanistan. While the tactics <b>of</b> modern guerrilla <b>warfare</b> originate in the 20th century, irregular warfare, using elements later characteristic <b>of</b> modern guerrilla <b>warfare,</b> has existed throughout the battles of many ancient civilizations.|$|R
