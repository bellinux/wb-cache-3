5|$|Rope dart: The rope dart is {{a weapon}} used in Chinese martial arts. It {{consists}} of a long rope with a metal dart attached at the end. The dart can be thrown as a long range weapon while the rope is used to pull the dart backwards. The first written description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> dart is dated from the Tang Dynasty (618 – 907 AD).|$|E
5|$|The seventh {{match was}} a Texas Bullrope match between Randy Orton and Dusty Rhodes. Rhodes started the match by {{performing}} {{a series of}} elbows on Orton's head. Orton, however, took the advantage after hitting Rhodes' head several times with the cowbell, {{which was in the}} middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> connecting the two men. After a final hit to the head, Orton pinned Rhodes to win the match. After the match, Orton attempted to punt Rhodes in the head, but Rhodes' son, Cody, made the save.|$|E
5|$|Oba Chandler (October 11, 1946November 15, 2011) was an American man {{convicted and}} {{executed}} for the June 1989 triple murders of Joan Rogers {{and her two}} daughters, whose bodies were found, with their hands and feet bound, floating in Tampa Bay, Florida. Autopsies showed the victims had been thrown into the water while still alive, with ropes around their necks with a concrete block tied {{at the other end}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rope.</b> The case became high-profile in 1992 when local police posted, on billboards, enlarged copies of the suspect's handwriting recovered on a pamphlet in the victims' car. Chandler was identified as the killer when his neighbor recognized the handwriting. This was the first such use of billboards by law enforcement in the U.S.; billboards became useful tools in searches for missing people.|$|E
40|$|Lateral {{vibrations}} of {{suspension and}} compensating ropes in a high-rise elevator system are {{induced by the}} building motions. When <b>the</b> frequency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building coincides with the fundamental natural frequency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ropes,</b> large resonance whirling motions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ropes</b> result. This phenomenon leads to impacts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ropes</b> <b>the</b> elevator walls, making the building and elevator system unsafe. The impact loads affect <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elevator installation resulting in interruptions of service and damage to <b>the</b> components <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system.

40|$|Lateral {{vibrations}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{suspension and}} compensating ropes in a high-rise elevator system are {{induced by the}} building motions. When the elevator is in motion <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ropes</b> change so that the natural frequencies vary, rendering <b>the</b> dynamics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system nonstationary. In this scenario large displacements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ropes</b> occur when a passage through resonance takes place. Due to the nonlinear coupling, interactions between the in-plane and out of plane directions occur. Furthermore, the car, counterweight and compensating sheave suffer from vertical vibrations due to the coupling with lateral vibrations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ropes.</b> This paper presents a comprehensive mathematical model of a high-rise elevator system which can predict the dynamic interactions taking place during its operation.

5|$|The {{weather had}} begun to deteriorate, and {{it was decided that}} the schuit was not strong enough to bring the {{remaining}} Malagasy ashore. One end of a rope was anchored to the shore, and at low tide volunteers from the Dutch group on shore swam out to Meermin, bringing the other end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> with them and handing it up to the crew on the ship. The crew then helped the remaining fifty-three Malagasy climb down to the Dutch volunteers, who helped them to shore, some carrying children on their backs. The Dutch built a fire to warm the Malagasy after their immersion in the water, and fed them; three wagons took them to Cape Town on 12March. Of the 140 or so Malagasy who had been shipped, 112 reached the Cape Colony as slaves.|$|E
5|$|Two {{forms of}} juldarigi, from Gijisi (Dangjin) and Yeongsang, are {{recognised}} as Important Intangible Cultural Properties of Korea. The Yeongsan ceremony is held {{later in the}} year than elsewhere, having been moved from the lunar festival to March 1 in the mid-twentieth century (to commemorate the March 1st Movement). In 2009, a special ₩20000 coin was minted in South Korea commemorating the Yeongsan juldarigi. In Gijisi, where the sport has been practiced for at least 500 years, the traditional East/West divide is replaced with a division of teams into upriver and downriver.

5|$|Pieces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> {{which was}} used to hang Corder sold for a guinea each. Part of Corder's scalp with an ear still {{attached}} was displayed in a shop in Oxford Street. A lock of Maria's hair sold for two guineas. Polstead became a tourist venue with visitors travelling from as far afield as Ireland; Curtis estimated that 200,000 people visited Polstead in 1828 alone. The Red Barn and the Martens' cottage excited particular interest. The barn was stripped for souvenirs, down to the planks being removed from the sides, broken up, and sold as toothpicks. It was slated to be demolished after the trial, but it was left standing and eventually burned down in 1842. Even Maria's gravestone in the churchyard of St Mary's, Polstead was eventually chipped away to nothing by souvenir hunters; only {{a sign on the}} shed now marks the approximate place where it stood, although her name is given to Marten's Lane in the village. Pottery models and sketches were sold and songs were composed, including one quoted in the Vaughan Williams opera Hugh the Drover and Five Variants of Dives and Lazarus.|$|E
40|$|Coupled lateral and {{longitudinal}} vibrations of {{suspension and}} compensating ropes in a high-rise lift system are often {{induced by the}} building motions due to wind or seismic excitations. When <b>the</b> frequencies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building become near <b>the</b> natural frequencies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ropes,</b> large resonance motions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system may result. This leads to adverse coupled dynamic phenomena involving nonplanar motions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ropes,</b> impact loads between <b>the</b> <b>ropes</b> and <b>the</b> shaft walls, as well as vertical vibrations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car, counterweight and compensating sheave. Such an adverse dynamic behaviour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system endangers <b>the</b> safety <b>of</b> <b>the</b> installation. This paper presents two mathematical models describing <b>the</b> nonlinear responses <b>of</b> a suspension/ compensating rope system coupled with the elevator car / compensating sheave motions. The models accommodate the nonlinear couplings between the lateral and longitudinal modes, with and without longitudinal inertia <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ropes.</b> <b>The</b> partial differential nonlinear equations of motion are derived using Hamilton Principle. Then, the Galerkin method is used to discretise <b>the</b> equations <b>of</b> motion {{and to develop a}} nonlinear ordinary differential equation model. Approximate numerical solutions are determined and <b>the</b> behaviour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system is analysed...|$|R

25|$|Releasable abseil - Used by some guides with inexperienced abseilers. A rope {{is set up}} by {{anchoring}} it with a munter hitch and locking off the non-rappelling strand <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rope.</b> The client descends on the non-locked strand <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rope.</b> The guide {{unlocks the}} other strand and lowers the client or the rappeller if the client gets into trouble. Useful with an inexperienced rappeller or when the rappeller gets into trouble, for example, by getting {{a piece of clothing}} or hair entangled in the descender.|$|E
25|$|Abseiling can be dangerous, and {{presents}} risks, especially to unsupervised or inexperienced abseilers. According to German mountaineer Pit Schubert, about 25% of climbing deaths occur during abseiling, most commonly due to failing anchors. Another frequent cause of accidents is abseiling beyond the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rope.</b> Backing up the rope set-up with a friction knot (autoblock, Kleimheist, or prusik) {{such that the}} slipping <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> is stopped even if the climber lets go of the control rope provides a measure of safety {{with regard to the}} control of the rate of descent.|$|E

50|$|According to Herodotus, <b>the</b> <b>ropes</b> {{were not}} only used as mooring ropes but also {{supported}} the wooden logs forming the bridge deck which is a rather unusual method of construction.
