5|$|Bindrich {{attended}} the 12th Neckar Open in 2008 and finished first out of over 300 participants, with 7½/9, finishing <b>only</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> point ahead of Leon Hoyos, Dgebuadze, Lauber, Graf, Krämer, Peralta, Chatalbashev, Erdos, and Fedorchuk, who all finished the tournament with 7.0/9. He also played for Germany in the 2008 Chess Olympiad, held in Dresden, where his team placed 13th out of 146 overall teams.|$|E
5|$|It {{took several}} years {{and a team of}} assistants to piece {{together}} the scanned fragments (many <b>only</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> page in width) of the hundreds of documents photocopied by Bukovsky and then, in 1999, to make them available online. Many of the same documents were extensively quoted and cited in Bukovsky's Judgment in Moscow (1995), where he described and analysed what he had uncovered about recent Soviet history and about the relations of the USSR and the CPSU with the West.|$|E

5|$|Plaman Mapu {{was a tiny}} Malaysian village <b>only</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> mile {{behind the}} western part of the border between Sarawak and Kalimantan. There the British had {{established}} a base for 'B' Company of the Parachute Regiment. Apart from the two 3-inch mortars stationed there, the place had little strategic value beyond being a lookout point for the British to detect Indonesian raids over the border. By the low standards of the makeshift British jungle bases, it was fairly well defended, equipped with aforementioned mortars, an interconnected trench network, and a command bunker, with supporting artillery weapons within range of the base to supply cover. The defenders of the base, by contrast, were wholly unprepared for combat. The undermanned 'B' Company had recently been supplied with a platoon of inexperienced troopers who had pitiful experience in jungle warfare. Due to the intensity of recent fighting, the base commander, Lieutenant Colonel Ted Eberhardie, had only been able to spare a few of the new men for a training course in such combat at Singapore, but one of those was Sergeant Major John Williams, who would play a crucial role in the coming battle.|$|E

25|$|There {{have been}} {{proposals}} that {{certain kinds of}} draws should be worth more points than others – for example, awarding <b>only</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> point for an agreed draw, but three-quarters of a point for a side delivering stalemate (one-quarter of a point going to the side who is stalemated).|$|E

25|$|But Cummings {{was close}} {{enough to be able to}} touch George's heels with his fingertips. At the half-mile point, they were at 2:01, and the crowd went delirious. At 1,000 yards, Cummings pulled even. At the three-quarter mark, George was at 3:07½, <b>only</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> second slower than the world record pace.|$|E
25|$|The {{water column}} is {{generally}} well-mixed, with {{no evidence of}} a significant halocline or thermocline. Mean differences in water temperature between sea surface and sea bed range from <b>only</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> degree (Celsius; 1°F) in summer to almost zero in winter, and differences in salinity are very small even when the Leeuwin Current is at its strongest.|$|E
25|$|The Rays {{went into}} the All-Star break with a 7-game losing streak. They had won 7 {{straight}} before then. The losing streak caused the Rays to fall to 2nd place in the AL East, but by <b>only</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> game behind the Boston Red Sox. Even though the Rays lost the division lead, they still led the Wild Card spot by 2½ games.|$|E

25|$|The fossil {{is that of}} a {{juvenile}} <b>only</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> metre (twenty inches) long and perhaps just three days old. The adult size is estimated to have been about two metres (6.5feet). Scipionyx was a bipedal predator, its horizontal rump balanced by a long tail. Its body was probably covered by primitive feathers but these have not been found in the fossil, that is without any skin remains.|$|E
25|$|Claims {{that the}} delays were <b>only</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> second are untrue, as {{examination}} of the original recordings shows. Also, {{there should not be}} a consistent time delay between every response, as the conversation is being recorded at one end – Mission Control. Responses from Mission Control could be heard without any delay, as the recording is being made {{at the same time that}} Houston receives the transmission from the Moon.|$|E
25|$|The {{first season}} of the League in 1992 was an exception, as it lasted <b>only</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> year. This was because the last Soviet league season ended {{in the autumn of}} 1991, and the Football Federation of Ukraine decided to shift the {{calendar}} from “spring-fall” to “fall-spring” football seasons. In the inaugural season, 20 clubs were divided into two 10-team groups. In both groups, each club played each other twice, and the championship was decided by a play-off match between the group winners, in which Tavriya Simferopol surprised the pre-season favorite Dynamo Kyiv.|$|E
50|$|The film {{is largely}} lost, with <b>only</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> hour {{surviving}} {{of the original}} 70-minute film. A restoration was made using still photos and title cards to bridge the missing sections in 1987.|$|R

25|$|The {{municipality}} {{is considered}} to be highly marginalized economically. Of those economically active, 51.86 are employed in farming and livestock. 49.26% of those in this sector do not receive wages, with <b>only</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> percent receiving more than five payments per year. 10.36% are employed in construction and industry, of which just under six percent do not receive payment. 35.62% are employed in commerce and services including tourism. This is above the regional average and about equal to the state average. About 6.5% of these workers do not receive any wages.|$|E
25|$|Perry {{returned}} on 13 February 1854, after <b>only</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> year {{rather than}} the full year promised, and with ten ships and 1600 men. Both actions were calculated to put even more pressure onto the Japanese. After initial resistance, Perry was permitted to land at Kanagawa, {{near the site of}} present-day Yokohama on March 8, 1854, where, after negotiations lasting for around a month, the Convention of Kanagawa was signed on March 31, 1854. Perry signed as American plenipotentiary, and Hayashi Akira, also known by his title of Daigaku-no-kami signed for the Japanese side.|$|E
25|$|Fletcher {{was out of}} {{first-class}} and List A cricket {{for nearly}} two years, and his return for Somerset, as an experimental opening batsman, proved unfortunate, as he had made 65 when his thumb was broken by the Middlesex opening bowler Neil Williams. This remained his highest first-class score. He returned to the Somerset side {{late in the season}} as a middle-order batsman, with some success, but in 1994 he played <b>only</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> dozen matches and he left the Somerset staff {{at the end of the}} season.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Porson was in {{his place}} next morning, having {{returned}} <b>only</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> hour before school began; he looked fagged, and he was scarcely so attentive as usual to the lessons, his thoughts seeming to be elsewhere.|$|R
25|$|While the {{buildings}} were designed to support enormous static loads, they provided little resistance to the moving mass of the sections above the floors where the collapses initiated. Structural systems respond very differently to static and dynamic loads, and since {{the motion of the}} falling portion began as a free fall through the height of at least one story (roughly three meters or 10feet), the structure beneath them was unable to stop the collapses once they began. Indeed, a fall of <b>only</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> meter (about 20inches) would have been enough to release the necessary energy to begin an unstoppable collapse.|$|E
25|$|The {{central part}} of the Coniston range can be likened to an {{inverted}} 'Y' with Brim Fell at the connecting point of the three arms. The main spine of the ridge runs north over Swirl How and Great Carrs and south west to Dow Crag and the lower hills beyond. The third arm is a truncated spur, running <b>only</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> mile to the summit of the Old Man before tumbling away south eastward to the valley floor. This ridge end position gives the fell a sense of isolation and increased stature, with steep faces on three sides.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of World War I, the air forces of the Allied forces were small and primitive. Most of the {{available}} aircraft and pilots {{were assigned to the}} Western Front. This meant that the Indian Army, which was attacking the Ottoman Empire in Mesopotamia, had no air support. On 8 February 1915, the Australian government received a request for air assistance from the British Government of India. The AFC was still in its infancy and could provide enough aircrews and ground staff for <b>only</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> flight: the unit therefore became known as the Mesopotamian Half-Flight, or Australian Half-Flight and Captain Henry Petre was appointed commander.|$|E
