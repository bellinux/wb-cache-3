5|$|A {{wide variety}} of small vessels {{from all over the}} south of England were pressed into service to aid in the Dunkirk evacuation. They {{included}} speedboats, Thames vessels, car ferries, pleasure craft, and many other types of small craft. The most useful proved to be the motor lifeboats, which had a reasonably good capacity and speed. Some boats were requisitioned without the owner's knowledge or consent. Agents of the Ministry <b>of</b> <b>Shipping,</b> accompanied by a naval officer, scoured the Thames for likely looking vessels, had them checked for seaworthiness, and took them downriver to Sheerness, where naval crews were to be placed aboard. Due to shortages of personnel, many small craft crossed the Channel with civilian crews.|$|E

5|$|After work on UB-10 was {{complete}} at the Weser yard, she was readied for rail shipment. The process <b>of</b> <b>shipping</b> a UB I boat involved breaking the submarine down {{into what was}} essentially a knock down kit. Each boat was broken into approximately fifteen pieces and loaded onto eight railway flatcars. In early 1915, the sections of UB-10 were shipped to Antwerp for assembly in what was typically a two- to three-week process. After UB-10 was assembled and launched on 20 February, she was loaded on a barge and taken through canals to Bruges where she underwent trials.|$|E
40|$|The small far {{infrared}} target <b>of</b> <b>ship</b> in surge interference {{is easy to}} have visual deviation causing the low accuracy of target positioning and the bad target identification performance. In order to improve the accuracy of far small infrared targets recognition <b>of</b> <b>ship</b> under surge interference, this paper proposed far small infrared target recognition algorithm <b>of</b> <b>ship</b> based on distributed target position estimation and DOA location in computer vision model for constructing coherent distributed source array model of far small infrared target distribution <b>of</b> <b>ship.</b> This algorithm used MUSIC algorithm for the beamforming processing of far small infrared target echo model <b>of</b> <b>ship.</b> Combined with the adaptive filtering algorithm we carried out the surge interference suppression and the estimation of central direction of arrival and angle spread of far small infrared target <b>of</b> <b>ship</b> through multidimensional spectrum peak searching algorithm, realizing the joint estimation <b>of</b> distance <b>of</b> <b>ship</b> target, DOA and frequency parameters, so as to realize the accurate positioning and recognition of targets. Simulation results show that using this method for the far small infrared target recognition <b>of</b> <b>ship</b> under surge interference, the spectral peak sharpness of spectral peak search of target position is high, side-lobe suppression performance is good, which shows the high accuracy of target position estimation and location, the accuracy and anti-interference performance of far small infrared target recognition <b>of</b> <b>ship</b> is good, and has superior performance...|$|R
