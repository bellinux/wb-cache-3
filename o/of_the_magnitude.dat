5|$|Evangelis Zappas {{was often}} {{described}} as a solitary and eccentric personality, who had no children. On the other hand, {{he was a man}} of vision, determination and a patriot, who was well aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>magnitude</b> of his acts. His cousin, Konstantinos Zappas, was the executor of his will and he continued Evangelis Zappas philanthropic works through his legacy. Zappas's wish was to be initially buried in Romania, where he lived most of his life. But after four years his bones were exhumed and reinterred at the school's courtyard in Labovo where he was born, and his skull was enshrined beneath his memorial statue outside the Zappeion in Athens, Greece. A ceremony for the interment was held at 10am on 20 October 1888 at the Zappeion. Baron Pierre de Coubertin made a similar gesture by having his heart buried at Olympia.|$|E
5|$|The {{software}} also {{calculated the}} fireball's instantaneous apparent magnitude at the ground. The computation started {{and ended with}} heights of approximately 250km, long {{before and after the}} cameras of the European Fireball Network could observe it. Its apparent magnitude started at a value of +5.7 and it became brighter quite quickly. The program gave an apparent magnitude of −5.7 when it was seen by one camera and −6.3 at perigee. The fireball subsequently dimmed, with an apparent magnitude of −5.4 when it was last seen by the cameras and a final calculated value of +6.0 at a height of 257km. These values are not entirely certain, because the program worked with the simplified assumption that the luminous efficacy of the fireball did not change along the track. The starting apparent magnitude is not far from the naked eye visibility limits. For example, faint stars <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>magnitude</b> +6 can be observed only in dark rural areas approximately 150km away from large cities. This magnitude corresponds to the apparent magnitude of Uranus. At its brightest, it was several times as bright as the maximum brightness of Venus.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} supply the boom in the iron and other industries, the output of mines {{increased}} massively. Near Bianjing, the Song capital, according to one estimate over one million households were using coal for heating, an indication <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>magnitude</b> of coal use. Light industries also began to prosper during the Song, including porcelainwhich replaced potteryshipbuilding and textiles. Compared with the Tang, textile production increased 55%. The historian Xie Qia estimates that over 100,000 households were working in textile production by Song times, an indicator <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>magnitude</b> of the Song textile industry. The urbanisation rate of the Song increased to 12%, compared with 10% during the Tang.|$|E

25|$|Quantitative symbols give {{a visual}} {{indication}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>magnitude</b> {{of the phenomenon}} that the symbol represents. Two major classes of symbols are used to portray quantity. Proportional symbols change size according to phenomenon’s magnitude, making them appropriate for representing statistics. Choropleth maps portray data collection areas, such as counties or census tracts, with color. Using color this way, the darkness and intensity (or value) of the color is evaluated by the eye {{as a measure of}} intensity or concentration.|$|E

25|$|On account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>magnitude</b> of the Holocaust, many theologians have re-examined the {{classical}} theological views on God's goodness and {{actions in the}} world.

25|$|As {{a result}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>magnitude</b> 8.0 {{earthquake}} in Sichuan province of China on 12 May 2008, many rivers became blocked by landslides, {{resulting in the}} formation of so-called quake lakes: large amounts of water pooling up behind the landslide-formed dams. These dams eventually broke {{under the weight of the}} water, endangering those downstream. At least one Mi-26 belonging to a branch of China's civil aviation service was used to bring heavy earth moving tractors to the quake-lakes at Tangjiashan mountain, located in difficult terrain and accessible only by foot or air.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} reasons why {{underwater}} archaeology can make {{a significant contribution to}} our knowledge of the past.

Shipwrecks such as Mary Rose can also be important for archaeology because they can form a kind of accidental time capsule, preserving an assemblage of human artifacts at the moment in time when the ship was lost.|$|E

A switched quantiser between memoryless and predictive coding schemes is also introduced for the resilience against channel errors while producing performances, {{in terms of}} weighted signal to noise ratio, superior to memoryless quantiser and comparable to predictive quantiser.
