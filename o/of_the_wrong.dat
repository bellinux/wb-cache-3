Ivan Sache of Flags of the World claimed that this flag design, which hadn't been seen earlier, may have been inaccurate, suggesting that the journalist might not have been at the affair or he had reproduced a drawing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> flag.|$|E

But, in United States v. Brewster (1833), the Court held that the crime applied only to counterfeit bills, not counterfeit notes.|$|E

In Hinduism, not only should one forgive others, but one must also seek forgiveness if one has wronged someone else. Forgiveness is to be sought from the individual wronged, as well as society at large, by acts of charity, purification, fasting, rituals and meditative introspection.|$|E

25|$|Infant sloths {{normally}} {{cling to}} their mothers' fur, but occasionally fall off. Sloths are very sturdily built and rarely die from a fall. In some cases, they die from a fall indirectly because the mothers prove unwilling {{to leave the}} safety of the trees to retrieve the young. Females normally bear one baby every year, but sometimes sloths' low level of movement actually keeps females from finding males for longer than one year. Sloths are not particularly sexually dimorphic and several zoos have received sloths <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> sex.|$|E
25|$|During {{the late}} 20th and early 21st century it was mistakenly {{assumed that the}} {{community}} had been named after St. Albert the Great. This was due to incorrect information in the 1985 history of St. Albert; , published by the amateur historians of the St. Albert Historical Society. This led to the City of St. Albert erroneously promoting St. Albert the Great as the community's patron saint and even erecting a statue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> saint in the downtown area. This misconception was not corrected until 2008. The original chapel has since become an historic site staffed with historical interpreters and {{is open to the}} public in the summer season.|$|E

25|$|Acupuncture needles {{during this}} period were much thicker than most modern ones and often {{resulted}} in infection. Infection {{is caused by a}} lack of sterilization, but at that time it was believed to be caused by use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> needle, or needling in the wrong place, or at the wrong time. Later, many needles were heated in boiling water, or in a flame. Sometimes needles were used while they were still hot, creating a cauterizing effect at the injection site. Nine needles were recommended in the Chen Chiu Ta Chheng from 1601, which may have been because of an ancient Chinese belief that nine was a magic number.|$|E
25|$|Iatrogenic {{conditions}} do {{not necessarily}} result from medical errors, such as mistakes made in surgery, or the prescription or dispensing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> therapy, such as a drug. In fact, intrinsic and sometimes adverse effects of a medical treatment are iatrogenic. For example, radiation therapy and chemotherapy â necessarily aggressive for therapeutic effect â frequently produce such iatrogenic effects as hair loss, hemolytic anemia, diabetes insipidus, vomiting, nausea, brain damage, lymphedema, infertility, etc. The loss of function resulting from the required removal of a diseased organ is iatrogenic, {{as in the case}} of diabetes consequential to the removal of all or part of the pancreas.|$|E
