5|$|In April 1987, Danville's local newspaper, the Danville Advocate-Messenger, {{sponsored}} the first Rally <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Square,</b> a political rally where candidates for statewide office can make speeches and meet area voters. Since then, the rally {{has been held}} every four years in April, {{in advance of the}} statewide primary elections in May. The first Rally <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Square</b> featured a brass band from nearby Centre College, which inspired the city to hold the first Great American Brass Band Festival in 1990. The festival has been held annually in June ever since. Constitution Square is one of the locales used for outdoor performances during the festival.|$|E

Highway 7 was widened in 1944 and rebuilt between 1960 and 1961.|$|E

5|$|Regency Square was a prestigious, high-class development, {{attracting}} the social elite. The square gradually lost its prestige status after World War I as hotels {{started to move}} in, and by the mid-20th century, most of the houses had become hotels. During World War II air-raid shelters were built <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>square,</b> and an underground car park was built beneath it in 1969.|$|E

The current coat of arms, more accurately called an emblem as it was not designed to conform to traditional heraldic rules, was adopted {{in place of the}} royal arms on 5 May 1948.|$|E

5|$|An {{alternative}} model {{assumes that}} PrPSc exists only as fibrils, and that fibril ends bind PrPC and convert it into PrPSc. If this were all, then {{the quantity of}} prions would increase linearly, forming ever longer fibrils. But exponential growth of both PrPSc and of the quantity of infectious particles is observed during prion disease. This {{can be explained by}} taking into account fibril breakage. A mathematical solution for the exponential growth rate resulting from the combination of fibril growth and fibril breakage has been found. The exponential growth rate depends largely <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>square</b> root of the PrPC concentration. The incubation period is determined by the exponential growth rate, and in vivo data on prion diseases in transgenic mice match this prediction. The same square root dependence is also seen in vitro in experiments with a variety of different amyloid proteins.|$|E

The square remained fashionable throughout most of the 18th century, with notable residents including the architect James Stuart at No35 from 1766 to 1788 and the painter John Singleton Copley at No.28 from 1776 to 1783.|$|E

5|$|On {{the day of}} the robbery, 26 June 1907, the 20 organizers, {{including}} Stalin, met near Yerevan Square (just 2 {{minutes from}} the seminary, bank and viceroy's palace) to finalize their plans, and after the meeting, they went to their designated places in preparation for the attack. The Russian authorities had become aware that some large action was being planned by revolutionaries in Tiflis, and had increased the security presence in the main square; just prior to the robbery, they had been tipped off and were guarding every street corner in Yerevan Square. To deal with the increased security, gang members spotted patrolling gendarmes and police prior to the robbery and lookouts were posted looking down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>square</b> from above.|$|E

5|$|Place d'Armes {{is one of}} {{the largest}} squares in the city of Calais, adjoins the watchtower, and during medieval times was once the heart of the city. While Calais was a {{territory}} of England (1347–1558), it became known as Market Square (place du Marché). Only at the end of English rule did it take the name of Place d'Armes. After the reconquest of Calais in 1558 by Francis, Duke of Guise, Francis II gave Calais the right to hold a fair twice a year <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>square,</b> which still exists today, as well as a bustling Wednesday and Saturday market.|$|E

The surrounding area has largely been redeveloped from its 19th-century industrial past. The ditch that originally linked the defences of the fortress to the River Seine had been dug out {{at the start of the}} 19th century to form the industrial harbour of the Bassin de l'Arsenal, linked to the Canal Saint Martin, but is now a marina for pleasure boats, while the Promenade Plantée links the square with redeveloped parklands to the east.|$|E

It pointed to a voice analysis conducted by the Speech Processing Laboratory at National Taiwan University, which concluded that the voices did not match, and also noted that the hairline and facial proportions appeared to be different.
