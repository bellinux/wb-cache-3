25|$|The poll at Paisley {{was split}} by an {{independent}} extreme socialist and a Tory. Asquith won with 33.4 per cent of the vote. Nationally, the <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>election</b> in December 1923 was a hung Parliament (258 Conservatives, 191 Labour, 158 Liberals); the Liberals had gained seats but were still in third place. A quarter of the seats were held by majority less than 1,000.

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{high-profile}} cases of corrupt practices in recent years {{was that of the}} local government elections in the Bordesley Green and Aston wards of Birmingham in June 2004. The election court, presided over by Richard Mawrey QC, found that there had been extensive abuse of the postal vote system, resulting in the <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>election</b> being changed. He accordingly reported that extensive corrupt practices had been committed, found six individuals personally guilty (although one was subsequently cleared by the Court of Appeal), and voided the elections.|$|E
25|$|Adams {{knew that}} his own victory in the {{contingent}} election would require the support of Clay, who despite being eliminated from the deliberation, would, as Speaker of the House, still {{be the most important}} player in determining the <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>election.</b> In contrast with Clay, Crawford believed in a weak, limited federal government. Jackson's policy views were unclear, but Clay had been outraged by Jackson's actions in Florida, and he feared what Jackson would do in office. Clay's American System called for high tariffs, federally-funded internal improvements, and a national bank, all of which were supported by Adams. Adams and Clay met prior to the contingent election, and Clay agreed to support Adams.|$|E
25|$|In March 2016, Portman {{authored}} {{the bipartisan}} bill the Countering Foreign Propaganda and Disinformation Act, along with Democratic Senator Chris Murphy. Congressman Adam Kinzinger introduced the U.S. House {{version of the}} bill. After the 2016 U.S. presidential election, worries grew that Russian propaganda spread and organized by the Russian government swayed the <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>election,</b> and representatives in the U.S. Congress took action to safeguard the National security of the United States by advancing legislation to monitor incoming propaganda from external threats. On November 30, 2016, legislators approved a measure within the National Defense Authorization Act to ask the U.S. State Department {{to take action against}} foreign propaganda through an interagency panel. The legislation authorized funding of $160 million over a two-year-period. The initiative was developed through the Countering Foreign Propaganda and Disinformation Act.|$|E

25|$|The U.S. House of Representatives had {{the right}} to make the final {{determination}} as to whether Buchanan will hold the seat {{for the remainder of the}} term or be replaced by Jennings. In April, a three-person House task force was created to evaluate the election. In early May, the task force voted along party lines to refer an investigation into Florida’s 13th district House race to the Government Accountability Office (GAO). On 25 February 2008, the committee and the House accepted the GAO's findings that no machine error was demonstrated as sufficient to have altered the <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>election.</b> The House passed HR 989 affirming the findings of the committee, accepting the results of the 2006 race and formally dismissing Jennings' challenge of the election's results. Jennings formally dropped her challenge shortly thereafter to focus on her 2008 rematch against Buchanan.|$|E
25|$|The {{perceived}} {{costs or}} cost savings of adopting an IRV method {{are commonly used}} by both supporters and critics. In the 2011 referendum on the Alternative Vote in the UK, the NOtoAV campaign was launched with a claim that adopting the method would cost £250million; commentators argued that this headline figure had been inflated by including £82million {{for the cost of}} the referendum itself, and a further £130million {{on the assumption that the}} UK would need to introduce electronic voting systems, when ministers had confirmed that there was no intention of implementing such technology, whatever the <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>election.</b> Automated vote counting is seen by some to have a greater potential for election fraud; IRV supporters counter these claims with recommended audit procedures, or note that automated counting is not required for the method at all.|$|E
25|$|Peter Singer, in Democracy and Disobedience, {{argues that}} {{compulsory}} voting could negate {{the obligation of}} a voter to support the <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>election,</b> since voluntary participation in elections is deemed {{to be one of}} the sources of the obligation to obey the law in a democracy. In 1996 Albert Langer was jailed for three weeks on contempt charges in relation to a constitutional challenge on a legal way not to vote for either of the major parties. Chong, Davidson and Fry, writing in the journal of the right wing think tank the CIS, argue that Australian compulsory voting is disreputable, paternalistic, disadvantages smaller political parties, and allows major parties to target marginal seats and make some savings in pork-barrelling because of this targeting. Chong et al. also argue that denial is a significant aspect of the debate about compulsory voting.|$|E

25|$|As {{the night}} wore on, the returns {{in a handful}} of small-to-medium-sized states, {{including}} Wisconsin and Iowa, were extremely close; however, it was the state of Florida that would decide the winner of the election. As the final national results were tallied the following morning, Bush had clearly won a total of 246 electoral votes, while Gore had won 249 votes. Two hundred and seventy votes were needed to win. Two smaller states — Wisconsin (10 electoral votes) and Oregon (7 electoral votes) — were still too close to call. It was Florida (25 electoral votes), however, on which the news media focused its attention. Mathematically, Florida's 25 electoral votes became the key to an election win for either candidate. Although both Wisconsin and Oregon were declared in favor of Gore over the next few days, Florida's statewide vote took center stage because that state's winner would ultimately win the election. The <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>election</b> was not known {{for more than a month}} after the balloting ended because of the time required to count and recount Florida's presidential ballots.|$|E
25|$|Monroe was reelected without {{opposition}} in 1820, {{and the old}} caucus system for selecting Republican candidates collapsed in 1820. In the presidential election of 1824, factions in Tennessee and Pennsylvania put forth Andrew Jackson. From Kentucky came Speaker of the House Henry Clay, while Massachusetts produced Secretary of State Adams; a rump congressional caucus put forward Treasury Secretary William H. Crawford. Personality and sectional allegiance played important roles in determining the <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>election.</b> Adams won the electoral votes from New England and most of New York; Clay won his western base of Kentucky, Ohio, and Missouri; Jackson won his base in the Southeast, and plus Illinois, Indiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and New Jersey; and Crawford won his base in the South, Virginia, Georgia, and Delaware. No candidate gained {{a majority in the}} Electoral College, so the president was selected by the House of Representatives, where Clay was the most influential figure. In return for Clay's support in winning the presidency, John Quincy Adams appointed Clay as secretary of state in what Jacksonians denounced as The Corrupt Bargain.|$|E
500|$|Although he did {{not believe}} Garrard had {{personally}} done anything wrong, Logan formally protested the <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>election</b> to Kentucky Attorney General John Breckinridge. Breckinridge refused to render an official decision on the matter, claiming that neither the constitution nor the laws of the state empowered him to do so. Privately, however, he expressed his opinion that Logan had been legally elected. Logan then appealed to the state senate, which was given the authority to intervene in disputed elections. In November 1796, the Senate opined that the law giving them that authority was unconstitutional because it did not promote the [...] "peace and welfare" [...] of the state. State senator Green Clay was the primary proponent of this line of reasoning. By this time, Garrard had been serving as governor for five months, and Logan abandoned the quest to unseat him.|$|E
