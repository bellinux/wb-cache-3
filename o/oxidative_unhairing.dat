40|$|As an {{alternative}} to the traditional process based on the use of sulfides, an unhairing process in drum by hydrogen peroxide was developed for the production of high-quality bovine upper leather. A preliminary investigation at laboratory scale has allowed us to set out the optimal process conditions, in terms of H 2 O 2 dosage and pH, in order to achieve an effective unhairing and a compatible swelling of the hide. The pilot and industrial scale runs have assessed the industrial feasibility of the process that allows the production of a versatile base for different final applications of the leather (either chrome or vegetable tanned), and appear practical to implement as well as compatible with existing machinery. The finished leather obtained by the innovative unhairing process shows good physical-mechanical and technical properties comparable with those of the traditional process, and the leather was technically assessed as satisfactory and suitable for use in the production of high quality upper leathers. The major pollutants of the <b>oxidative</b> <b>unhairing,</b> either as absolute concentrations or if normalized with respect to the salted weight of hide processed, appear quite similar to those from the traditional process. The evident advantage is obviously the complete absence of dissolved sulfides in the exhaust baths of the oxidative process. Scanning electron microscopy was used as investigation method to better understand the mechanism of the <b>oxidative</b> <b>unhairing</b> in comparison with the traditional...|$|E
40|$|As an {{alternative}} to the traditional process based on the use of sulfides, an unhairing process in drum by hydrogen peroxide, named DEPOXO, was developed for the production of high-quality bovine upper leather. A preliminary investigation at laboratory scale has allowed to set out the optimal process conditions, in terms of H 2 O 2 dosage (9 %) and pH (12. 5), in order to achieve an effective unhairing and a compatible swelling of hides. The following pilot-scaled runs have assessed the industrial feasibility of the process that allows the production of a versatile base for different final applications of the leather (either chrome or vegetable tanned), and appear practical to implement. The crust leather obtained by the <b>oxidative</b> <b>unhairing</b> process showed good physical-mechanical and technical properties comparable with those obtained by the traditional one, and the leather was technically assessed as satisfactory and suitable according to the market request. The actual reduction of the environmental impact of the novel process, in relation with the traditional one, was evaluated performing a Life Cycle Assesment (LCA) using SimaPro 7. 3, one of the most used software for LCA analysis. The results of the life cycle impact assessment underline that damages on main impact categories are greatly reduced through the adoption or the <b>oxidative</b> <b>unhairing.</b> Therefore, the DEPOXO process appears a feasible process, either from the environmental or from the technical point of view, to produce high quality bovine upper leather...|$|E
