TWZW employed about 50 people full-time (many <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>women),</b> many more volunteers (particularly to distribute its publications), and consumed monthly about 5 tons of paper (bought on the black market). TWZW was likely the largest underground publisher in the world.|$|E
25|$|Unit 101 {{undertook}} {{a series of}} raids against Jordan, which then held the West Bank. The raids also helped bolster Israeli morale and convince Arab states that the fledgling nation was capable of long-range military action. Known for raids against Arab civilians and military targets, the unit is {{held responsible for the}} widely condemned Qibya massacre in the fall of 1953. After a group of Palestinians used Qibya as a staging point for a fedayeen attack in Yehud that killed a Jewish woman and her two children in Israel, Unit 101 retaliated on the village. By various accounts of the ensuing attack, 65 to 70 Palestinian civilians, half <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>women</b> and children, were killed when Sharon's troops dynamited 45 houses and a school.|$|E

25|$|The {{village of}} Pidkamin (Podkamień) near Brody was {{a shelter for}} Poles, who hid in the monastery of the Dominicans there. Some 2,000 persons, the {{majority}} <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>women</b> and children, were living there when the monastery was attacked in mid-March 1944 by UPA units, which according to Polish Home Army accounts were cooperating with the Ukrainian SS. Over 250 Poles were killed. In the nearby village of Palikrovy, 300 Poles were killed, 20 in Maliniska and 16 in Chernytsia. Armed Ukrainian groups destroyed the monastery, stealing all valuables. What remained was the painting of Mary of Pidkamin, which now is kept in St. Wojciech Church in Wrocław. According to Kirichuk, the first attacks on the Poles took place there in August 1943 and they were probably the work of UPA units from Volhynia. In retaliation, Poles killed important Ukrainians, including the Ukrainian doctor Lastowiecky from Lviv and a popular football player from Przemyśl, Wowczyszyn.|$|E
25|$|The Treaty {{established}} a British Governor of New Zealand, recognised Māori ownership of their lands, forests, and other properties, and gave Māori {{the rights of}} British subjects. An immediate result of the Treaty was that Queen Victoria's government gained the sole right to purchase land. Because the English and Māori versions of the Treaty differed significantly, {{there is no consensus}} as to exactly what was agreed upon. From the British point of view, the Treaty gave Britain sovereignty over New Zealand, and gave the Governor the right to govern the country. Māori believed they ceded to the Crown a right of governance in return for protection, without giving up their authority to manage their own affairs. After the initial signing at Waitangi, copies of the Treaty were taken around New Zealand, and, over the following months, many other chiefs signed. In total there are nine copies of the Treaty of Waitangi, including the original signed on 6 February 1840. Around 530 to 540 Māori, at least 13 <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>women,</b> signed the Treaty of Waitangi.|$|E
25|$|However, ethnic {{tensions}} in North Ossetia which were orchestrated by Ossetian nationalists (per Helsinki Human Right Watch), {{led to an}} outbreak {{of violence in the}} Ossetian–Ingush conflict in late October, when another ethnic cleansing of the Ingush population started. In a possible retaliation, Chechen and Ingush militants took over 500 Osset hostages in Beslan high-school. According to media reports, the school gymnasium was one of several buildings in which the Islamist militants had held hundreds of Osset hostages, many <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>women</b> and children. The hostages were all kept in the same gymnasium, and deprived of food and water; at least one newborn, and several dozen male hostages were executed. Over 60,000 Ingush civilians were forced from their homes in the Prigorodny District of North Ossetia. As a result of the conflict, pro-Russian general Ruslan Aushev, a decorated war hero from the War in Afghanistan, was appointed by the Russian government as the first president of Ingushetia {{to stop the spread of}} the conflict. Partial stability returned under his rule.|$|E

25|$|The {{first state}} to {{introduce}} a compulsory sterilization bill was Michigan, in 1897, but the proposed law failed to pass. Eight years later Pennsylvania's state legislators passed a sterilization bill that was vetoed by the governor. Indiana became the {{first state to}} enact sterilization legislation in 1907, followed closely by California and Washington in 1909. Several other states followed, but such legislation remained controversial enough to be defeated in some cases, as in Wyoming in 1934. Sterilization rates across the country were relatively low, with the sole exception of California, until the 1927 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Buck v. Bell which legitimized the forced sterilization of patients at a Virginia home for the intellectually disabled. In the wake of that decision, over 62,000 people in the United States, most <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>women,</b> were sterilized. The number of sterilizations performed per year increased until another Supreme Court case, Skinner v. Oklahoma, 1942, complicated the legal situation by ruling against sterilization of criminals if the equal protection clause of the constitution was violated. That is, if sterilization was to be performed, then it could not exempt white-collar criminals.|$|E

When the bill became law, 4 million voters, most <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>women,</b> were added to the register. In the 1929 general election, held on 30 May, Bondfield easily held her Wallsend seat despite the intervention of a candidate representing unemployed workers. The overall election result left Labour as the largest party with 287 seats, but without an overall majority, and MacDonald formed his second minority administration.|$|E
