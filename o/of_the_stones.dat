5|$|In 1965, the Museum Society raised $40,000 {{to mount}} the grand portal of the old church. It was {{installed}} in the de Young Museum, the centerpiece of Hearst Court, the main exhibit hall. The rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stones</b> were abandoned by the museum in May 1969 with the announcement {{that there would be}} no reconstruction. After this, stones were occasionally taken by park workers and used to decorate Golden Gate Park.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, the {{archaeologist}} {{and historian}} Patrick Healy discovered {{the remains of}} a prehistoric wedge tomb in the woods. All the survives is the skeletal outline of the main chamber and the outer double walls.

5|$|Orkney has a rich folklore, {{and many}} of the former tales concern trows, an Orcadian form of troll that draws on the islands' Scandinavian connections.

5|$|The Great Circle was {{surrounded}} by a ditch and is accompanied by smaller stone circles to the north east and south west. There is also a group of three stones, known as The Cove, in the garden of the local pub. Slightly further from the Great Circle is a single stone, known as Hautville's Quoit. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stones</b> are still vertical, but the majority are now recumbent and some are no longer present.|$|E

5|$|The Northern Isles have a rich folklore. For example, {{there are}} many Orcadian tales {{concerning}} trows, a form of troll that draws on the islands' Scandinavian connections.

5|$|Two {{pre-existing}} settlements {{were included}} in the territory: the port of Georgetown, Maryland, founded in 1751, and the city of Alexandria, Virginia, founded in 1749. During 1791–92, Andrew Ellicott and several assistants, including a free African American astronomer named Benjamin Banneker, surveyed the borders of the federal district and placed boundary stones at every mile point. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stones</b> are still standing.|$|E

2500|$|Gamma Ray {{changed their}} name in 1997 after the German power metal band Gamma Ray {{threatened}} to sue.

5|$|After leaving Cambridge, Horrocks {{returned}} {{to his home in}} Lancashire and began collecting books and instruments in order to pursue his main interest, the study of astronomy. In the summer of 1639, he left home and moved about 18 miles along the coast to the village of Much Hoole, where it is thought he took up a post as a tutor for the children <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Stones</b> family, who were prosperous haberdashers living at Carr House, within the Bank Hall Estate, Bretherton.|$|E
5|$|Alexander {{suggested}} that the barrow was constructed before the chamber, {{and that it was}} used as a ramp on which to drag the large stones into position. He {{suggested that}} these megaliths were covered with sand until the capstones were placed atop the chamber, at which the sand was then cleared. In 1950, it was stated that fourteen <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stones</b> currently survive, although following full excavation it was revealed that eighteen large sarsen boulders were extant, alongside four smaller sarsen stones used in the drystone wall and pavement of the tomb.|$|E
5|$|In 1877 three {{stones were}} found in a cavern on Rodrigues, each near a Rodrigues {{solitaire}} skeleton, and were inferred to be the gizzard stones mentioned by Leguat. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stones</b> was examined and found to be dolerite: somewhat rough, hard and heavy, , but hardly flat on one side as described by Leguat. This {{could be due to}} its association with a young individual. Although Leguat asserted that the bird hatched with the gizzard stone already inside, in reality adults most likely fed the stones to their hatchlings.|$|E

The band signed with the {{independent}} label Loosegroove Records and released <b>the</b> Kyuss/Queens <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Stone</b> Age extended play in 1997. In 1998, the band released its full-length debut, Queens <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Stone</b> Age. <b>The</b> band subsequently signed with Interscope Records and released its first album for a major label, Rated R, which became <b>the</b> first Queens <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Stone</b> Age album to chart.|$|R
5|$|In 1980, {{when the}} stadium was {{in need of}} {{redesign}} to meet UEFA criteria, the club raised money by offering supporters the opportunity to inscribe their name on the bricks for a small fee. The idea was popular with supporters, and thousands of people paid the fee. Later this became the centre of controversy when media in Madrid picked up reports that one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stones</b> was inscribed with the name of long-time Real Madrid chairman and Franco supporter Santiago Bernabéu. In preparation for the 1992 Summer Olympics two tiers of seating were installed above the previous roofline. It has a current capacity of 99,354 making it the largest stadium in Europe.|$|E
5|$|In 1983 and 1987, Davis made {{unsuccessful}} {{requests for}} all of the chapter house stones. After the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, the de Young museum was to be rebuilt, and the future <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stones</b> was reconsidered. In September 1993, museum director Harry Parker joined with Davis to sign an unconditional permanent loan of the chapter house stones to New Clairvaux. In 1994, the city approved the loan with the stipulation that the building be restored accurately and that it be occasionally open to the public. The stones were transported in 20 truckloads to Vina. Inside an old brick barn built by Stanford to make brandy, the stones began to be fitted together, laid flat on Burke's plywood templates.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stones</b> {{were used}} to {{construct}} an outdoor reading terrace adjoining the Helen Crocker Russell Library of Horticulture, part of the Strybing Arboretum and Botanical Gardens in Golden Gate Park. Other stones were used for various purposes around Golden Gate Park and the Japanese Tea Garden, taken unofficially by park workers as they saw fit. Some of these {{ended up in the}} park's AIDS Memorial Grove, others on a scent-based flower walkway named Garden of Fragrance.|$|E

50|$|The Skåäng Runestone {{consists}} of a younger futhark inscription that is within a serpent on <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> and an older inscription in <b>the</b> center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stone.</b> <b>The</b> younger futhark inscription was discovered in 1830, but the older central inscription was not noticed until 1867.|$|R
5|$|Located in {{the bottom}} of a narrow valley, the Nine Stones circle has a {{diameter}} of 9.1 metres by 7.8 metres (29 feet 10 inches by 25 feet 11 inches). It consists of nine irregularly spaced sarsen megaliths, with a small opening on its northern side. Two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stones</b> on the north-western side of the monument are considerably larger than the other seven. This architectural feature has parallels with various stone circles in south-western Scotland, and was potentially a deliberate choice of the circle's builders, to whom it may have had symbolic meaning.|$|E
5|$|Nearby Sierra Nevada Brewing Company {{partnered with}} the monks of New Clairvaux {{to make a}} series of Belgian-style beers under the Ovila Abbey brand. In late 2010, the beer {{producer}} launched a website to tell about {{the making of the}} beer product line and the story of the restoration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stones.</b> Sierra Nevada founder Ken Grossman said he had long been interested in making a line of Belgian beers, and the abbey's project provided a good opportunity. The first product, a Dubbel, was released in March 2011, followed in July by a Saison and in November by a Quadrupel. Sierra Nevada has dedicated a percentage of the beer sales to assist in funding the rebuilding project.|$|E
5|$|Seven of {{the nine}} {{surviving}} stones are under 90 centimetres (3 feet) tall, {{but two of the}} north-west stones are considerably larger. Located opposite the circle's two shortest stones, one is thin and pointed, reaching 2.1 metres (7 feet) high, while the other is broader, measuring 1.8 metres square (6 feet by 6 feet). The largest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stones</b> weighs approximately 7.3 tonnes (8 tons) and would have required the efforts of many people to move and erect it.|$|E
