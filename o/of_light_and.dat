5|$|According to Jesse Stommel of Bright Lights Film Journal, {{the lack}} of {{explicit}} violence in the film forces viewers to question their own fascination with violence that they {{play a central role}} in imagining. Nonetheless—citing its feverish camera moves, repeated bursts <b>of</b> <b>light,</b> <b>and</b> auditory pandemonium—Stommel asserts that it involves the audience primarily on a sensory rather than an intellectual level.|$|E
5|$|After {{witnessing}} {{a bright light}} in the sky which most historians have identified as Halley's Comet, Zara Yaqob, Emperor of Ethiopia from 1434 to 1468, founded the city of Debre Berhan (tr.

5|$|As {{intriguing}} as geometric Newtonian gravity may be, its basis, classical mechanics, {{is merely}} a limiting case of (special) relativistic mechanics. In the language of symmetry: where gravity can be neglected, physics is Lorentz invariant as in special relativity rather than Galilei invariant as in classical mechanics. (The defining symmetry of special relativity is the Poincaré group, which includes translations, rotations and boosts.) The {{differences between the two}} become significant when dealing with speeds approaching the speed <b>of</b> <b>light,</b> <b>and</b> with high-energy phenomena.|$|E
5|$|At the time, Monet's {{innovative}} use <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>and</b> color {{led to its}} {{rejection by}} the Paris Salon of 1869. Today, art historians classify The Magpie as one of Monet's best snowscape paintings. The painting was privately held until the Musée d'Orsay acquired it in 1984; it {{is considered one of}} the most popular paintings in their permanent collection.|$|E
5|$|Baroque {{architecture}} is a European phenomenon originating in 17th-century Italy; it is flamboyant and theatrical, and richly ornamented by sculpture and an effect known as chiaroscuro, the strategic use <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>and</b> shade on a building created by mass and shadow.|$|E

5|$|Closely {{related to}} light {{deflection}} is the gravitational time delay (or Shapiro delay), the phenomenon that light signals {{take longer to}} move through a gravitational field than they would {{in the absence of}} that field. There have been numerous successful tests of this prediction. In the parameterized post-Newtonian formalism (PPN), measurements of both the deflection <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>and</b> the gravitational time delay determine a parameter called γ, which encodes the influence of gravity on the geometry of space.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy Dimensions {{features}} 2D {{graphics and}} a Job Change System {{similar to that}} of Final Fantasy V. Its battle system is a variation of the Final Fantasy series's Active Time Battle system. The game follows two parties, the Warriors <b>of</b> <b>Light</b> <b>and</b> the Warriors of Darkness, with players controlling up to five party members at a time in battle, on their quest to reform their shattered world and foil the dark plans of the Avalon Empire.|$|E
5|$|Gateshead International Stadium (GIS) is a multi-purpose, all-seater venue in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, England. Originally {{known as}} the Gateshead Youth Stadium, the venue was built in 1955 {{at a cost of}} £30,000. It has since been {{extensively}} re-developed on three occasions. Its capacity of around 11,800 is the greatest in the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead, the third-largest in Tyne and Wear (behind only St James' Park and the Stadium <b>of</b> <b>Light)</b> <b>and</b> the sixth-largest in North East England.|$|E

5|$|Gravitational waves, {{a direct}} {{consequence}} of Einstein's theory, are distortions of geometry that propagate {{at the speed}} <b>of</b> <b>light,</b> <b>and</b> {{can be thought of as}} ripples in spacetime.

5|$|Hunter {{painted a}} variety of still-lifes, landscapes and portraits, and his {{paintings}} are critically acclaimed for their treatment <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>and</b> the effects of light.

5|$|It is {{expected}} that {{the definition of the}} kilogram and several other units will change on May 20, 2019, following a final vote by the CGPM in November 2018.

5|$|Most mythological {{elements}} in Carnivàle relate to so-called Avatars (or Creatures <b>of</b> <b>Light</b> <b>and</b> Darkness), fictional human-like beings with supernatural powers who embody good and evil. In its first season Carnivàle does not reveal its characters as Avatars beyond insinuation, {{and makes the}} nature of suggested Avatars a central question. By the second season it is established that Ben is a Creature <b>of</b> <b>Light</b> <b>and</b> Brother Justin a Creature of Darkness. Other than through the characters, the show's good-and-evil theme manifests in the series' contemporary religion, the Christian military order Knights Templar, tarot divination, and in historical events like the Dustbowl and humankind's first nuclear test. Show creator Daniel Knauf {{did not respond to}} questions about the mythology but did provide hints about the mythological structure to online fandom both during and after the two-season run of Carnivàle. Nevertheless, many of the intended clues remained unnoticed by viewers. Knauf left fans a production summary of Carnivàles first season two years after cancellation. This so-called Pitch Document, originally written to give HBO and Knauf's co-writers an overview of the intended storyline, backed up and expanded upon the assumed mythological rules.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{his work}} at the patent office related to {{questions}} about transmission of electric signals and electrical-mechanical synchronization of time, two technical problems that show up conspicuously in the thought experiments that eventually led Einstein to his radical conclusions about the nature <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>and</b> the fundamental connection between space and time.|$|E

5|$|Rodin was a naturalist, less {{concerned}} with monumental expression than with character and emotion. Departing with centuries of tradition, {{he turned away from}} the idealism of the Greeks, and the decorative beauty of the Baroque and neo-Baroque movements. His sculpture emphasized the individual and the concreteness of flesh, and suggested emotion through detailed, textured surfaces, and the interplay <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>and</b> shadow. To a greater degree than his contemporaries, Rodin believed that an individual's character was revealed by his physical features.|$|E
