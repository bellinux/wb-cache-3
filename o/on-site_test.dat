50|$|The {{simplest}} {{methods of}} chemical analysis are those measuring chemical elements without {{respect to their}} form. Elemental analysis for oxygen, as an example, would indicate a concentration of 890,000 milligrams per litre (mg/L) of water sample because water is made of oxygen. The method selected to measure dissolved oxygen should differentiate between diatomic oxygen and oxygen combined with other elements. The comparative simplicity of elemental analysis has produced {{a large amount of}} sample data and water quality criteria for elements sometimes identified as heavy metals. Water analysis for heavy metals must consider soil particles suspended in the water sample. These suspended soil particles may contain measurable amounts of metal. Although the particles are not dissolved in the water, they may be consumed by people drinking the water. Adding acid to a water sample to prevent loss of dissolved metals onto the sample container may dissolve more metals from suspended soil particles. Filtration of soil particles from the water sample before acid addition, however, may cause loss of dissolved metals onto the filter. The complexities of differentiating similar organic molecules are even more challenging.Making these complex measurements can be expensive. Because direct measurements of water quality can be expensive, ongoing monitoring programs are typically conducted by government agencies. However, there are local volunteer programs and resources available for some general assessment. Tools available to the general public include <b>on-site</b> <b>test</b> kits, commonly used for home fish tanks, and biological assessment procedures.|$|E

50|$|After being de-mobilised, {{he joined}} Dinamo Bucharest’s rugby team, {{where he played}} for a few months. Dinamo’s canoeing coach Radu Huţan, hearing about his {{fisherman}} and paddling past, persuaded him to switch to canoeing, to which Ismailciuc would devote {{the rest of his}} life.His outstanding talent, exceptional working capacity and his life experience soon turned him into Huţan’s genuine, albeit unpaid, assistant coach. Fascinated by Ismailciuc’s Danube Delta stories, Huţan sent him on various scouting missions there, resulting in a series of talented youngsters from that area (of various ethnic backgrounds) rising rather quickly to canoeing glory (a trend which would continue over the following decades).As for Ismailciuc himself, realising he could not match fellow Dinamo canoeist Leon Rotman’s times in the singles events, he looked for a partner among the young people he had selected, and he chose Dumitru Alexe. The two of them competed in the C-2 events in the 1956 Summer Olympics. Some liver complaints by Ismailciuc prevented them being placed higher than fifth in the C-2 10000 m event. However, they competed brilliantly in the C-2 1000 m event, where they won Olympic gold. They went on to become European champions in Ghent, Belgium (1957) in the C-2 10000 m event (they won silver in the C-2 1000 m event). The bronze medal in C-2 10000 m was won by two of Ismailciuc’s protégés (Ichim Lipalit-Lavrente Calinov), as one country was entitled to two entries in each event. At the 1958 World Championships in Prague, Ismailciuc and Alexe won the gold in the C-2 1000 m event. Deserted by Alexe, who retired and returned to his previous job, Ismailciuc tried his luck in the C-1 1000 m event for the 1960 Summer Olympics, he was already credited with better results than reigning Olympic champion Leon Rotman. However, Romanian coaches were unable to decide between the two, so both were part of the Romanian Olympic delegation in Rome. The <b>on-site</b> <b>test</b> races on Lake Albano showed Rotman was faster and allowed to represent Romania at those games. Ismailciuc retired {{as a result of his}} second-place finish though he would return to win a gold in the C-1 1000 m event at the 1963 World Championships in Jajce.|$|E

40|$|Compelled by {{the high}} quality {{requirements}} of HV Power Transformers and increase of average age, on-site tests {{are becoming more and}} more important. Impulse on-site testing is a tool for checking the quality of new and already installed equipment. For large Power Transformers a transportation of the entire transformer is, due to the heavy weight, not possible. In this case assembling has to be performed on site and, as a logical consequence, also the testing. Digital recorders used for on-site testing should, of course, be equipped with state of the art analysis tools such as Transfer and Coherence function. Such sophisticated analysis tools, which take advantage of the transformation to the frequency domain, should have excellent amplitude resolution. The fact that on-site tests are generally performed with full wave impulses, having little spectral density at high frequencies, means that amplitude resolution is the most important factor. In this article only impulse test systems and analysis are discussed. For information on AC OWTS or other <b>on-site</b> <b>test</b> systems the reader is referred to the literature [1, 2].

Between January and May 2009, we randomized 1281 HIV-negative (or status unknown) adults who reported no past-year HIV testing to (1) referral for off-site HIV testing, (2) HIV risk-reduction counseling with <b>on-site</b> rapid HIV <b>testing,</b> or (3) verbal information about <b>testing</b> only with <b>on-site</b> rapid HIV <b>testing.</b> Results. We defined 2 primary self-reported outcomes a priori: receipt of HIV test results and unprotected anal or vaginal intercourse episodes at 6 -month follow-up. The combined <b>on-site</b> rapid <b>testing</b> participants received more HIV test results than off-site testing referral participants (P <. 001; Mantel-Haenszel risk ratio = 4. 52; 97. 5 % confidence interval [CI] = 3. 57, 5. 72).

40|$|The {{integral}} {{variability of}} raw materials, {{lack of awareness}} and appreciation of the technologies for achieving quality control and lack of appreciation of the micro and macro environmental conditions that the structures will be subjected, makes modern day concreting a challenge. This also makes Designers and Engineers adhere more closely to prescriptive standards developed for relatively less aggressive environments. The data from exposure sites and real structures prove, categorically, that the prescriptive specifications are inadequate for chloride environments. In light of this shortcoming, a more pragmatic approach would be to adopt performance-based specifications which are familiar to industry {{in the form of}} specification for mechanical strength. A recently completed RILEM technical committee made significant advances in making such an approach feasible. Furthering a performance-based specification requires establishment of reliable laboratory and <b>on-site</b> <b>test</b> methods, as well as easy to perform service-life models. This article highlights both laboratory and <b>on-site</b> <b>test</b> methods for chloride diffusivity/electrical resistivity and the relationship between these tests for a range of concretes.

40|$|Automatic {{platform}} gates {{are recognized}} as one of the most efficient hardware to reduce accidents on platforms, as they prevent customers from falling from the platform or coming into contact with arriving or departing trains. West Japan Railway Company (JR-West), who has been trying to increase their safety level and whose fiscal 2018 (ending March 2018) safety target includes 30 per cent reduction of platform accidents from 13 in fiscal 2013, has been installing platform gates into several stations. However, these “door style ” platform gates, which cannot accommodate rail cars with different door configurations, are not appropriate for stations on the company’s major lines because the number of doors or train cars is different depending on the services such as local or rapid. Having taken this issue into account, JR-West invented a new type of platform gate; the “wire style”. These platform gates enable passengers to keep away from moving trains, being operated by wires which are raised when the trains stop at the platform. The first <b>on-site</b> <b>test</b> was completed in Sakurajima station on a minor line in the Osaka-Kyoto metropolitan area, which 18, 000 passengers use every day and where only 8 -car-trains stop. Reviewing its result, JR-West started a second <b>on-site</b> <b>test</b> in Rokkomichi station on one of the most major lines between Osaka and Kobe, which 50, 000 passengers use and where 230 trains with 6, 7, 8, 10 and 12 cars stop every day.

40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 2011 accident at Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (F 1 hereafter), municipal solid waste (MSW) contaminated with radioactive cesium (rad-Cs hereafter) has been generated in 12 prefectures in Japan. The Japanese Minister of Environment classified MSW that contained rad-Cs in the concentration more than 8, 000 Bq/kg as “designated (solid) waste (DSW hereafter), and prescribed the collection, storage and transportation procedures. When MSW containing rad-Cs was incinerated, rad-Cs was concentrated in fly ash, and the ash often fell into the category of DSW. We have investigated a technique that can reduce the volume of the rad-Cs-contaminated fly-ash by extracting rad-Cs with aqueous solvents such as water and oxalic acid and concentrating rad-Cs in a small amount of hexacyanoferrate (or ferrocyanide, designated as Fer hereafter) precipitate. Since DSW could not be transported to the outside laboratory, we have conducted on-site tests at places where DSW were generated to investigate the applicability of the extraction – precipitation technique. The present report is a summary of our most recent <b>on-site</b> <b>test</b> conducted in 2014. Also presented is the re-evaluation of the results of our past <b>on-site</b> <b>test</b> from the viewpoint of leaching of rad-Cs and heavy metals in the fly ash. An apparent decrease in leaching of rad-Cs from fly ash was observed by incinerating sewage sludge with soil. Fly ash from a melting furnace contained more water-soluble rad-Cs than that from a fluidized-bed incinerator. Some incinerator fly ash appeared to produce rad-Cs in colloidal form when extracted with oxalic acid, resulting in the lower removal of rad-Cs from the extract by Fer method. © The Editor(s) if applicable and the Author(s) 2016...|$|E
