The {{effect of}} heat {{treatment}} on the superconducting properties of porous Y(Ba 1 -xCax) 2 Cu 3 Oδ with Ca substitution x = 0. 00, 0. 10, 0. 20, and 0. 30 via a solid-state reaction method have been investigated. The superconducting parameters, zero critical temperature, Tc zero and critical current density, Jc were {{measured by the}} standard four point probe method in the temperature range from 20 K to 300 K, while the morphology of the samples was investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). In addition structural identification was also investigated. All the samples received a heat treatment at 900 °C for 5 hours, and the Jc improved from 1. 410 A/cm 2 to 7. 013 A/cm 2 for x = 0. 30 at 60 K. The heat treatment process did not change the morphology, while the crystallographic structure remained orthorhombic structure.

40|$|As {{stated earlier}} in the title, <b>the</b> overall aim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> project has been to {{investigate}} “Synthesis, Characterisation and Photocatalytic Application of Rhodium-doped Oxides upon Irradiation with Visible Light”. The key considerations in photocatalyst design, assessment and challenges and energy requirements in application is reviewed in the Introduction chapter. In the Discussion chapters, first, a simple one-step strategy was employed to produce a high surface area, phase pure metal oxide that is active in UV light. Various structures have been produced as parent phases such as SrTiO 3, BaTiO 3 and Y 2 Ti 2 O 7, and once <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> phase pure material was confirmed, rhodium substitution was initiated by B site doping of structures by adding soluble Rh salts during phase formation. <b>The</b> idea <b>of</b> using rhodium was to provide active, new rhodium states within the band gap therefore induce e- and h+ transfer that will presumably facilitate photochemical reduction/oxidation reactions with a longer excited wavelength than 400 nm, visible light photons. <b>The</b> series <b>of</b> nanoparticulate SrTi 1 -xRhxO 3 and BaTi 1 -xRhxO 3 materials with x = 0; 0. 01; 0. 025; 0. 050; 0. 075 and 0. 1 rhodium content have been fully characterised. <b>The</b> functionality <b>of</b> well-known SrTi 1 -xRhxO 3 H 2 generating p-type oxide was extended to be successfully applied in water remediation and disinfection with excellent performance in model Methyl Orange molecule degradation and reasonable efficiency in E. coli Gram-negative bacteria inactivation when exposed to visible light (λ > 420 mm). So far, of semiconductor oxides, nitrogen-doped titania in particular have demonstrated activity under visible light in all three functionalities mentioned above, making this new finding very encouraging in <b>the</b> application <b>of</b> SrTi 0. 95 Rh 0. 05 O 3 compound. As <b>the</b> investigation <b>of</b> novel advanced materials is crucial in the field, following up on this, a novel stable visible-light-driven photocatalyst (λ ≥ 450 nm) for water oxidation is reported. Rhodium substitution into the pyrochlore Y 2 Ti 2 O 7 is demonstrated by monitoring the Vegard’s law evolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>unit-cell</b> parameters <b>with</b> changing rhodium content, to a maximum content of 3 % dopant.

40|$|In this research, novel meta {{material}} structures {{based on}} microstrip integrated circuit technology {{have been investigated}} for filter application in <b>the</b> next generation <b>of</b> microwave wireless communication systems. A number of novel microstrip planar filter structures have been developed {{that are able to}} meet the stringent requirements for high-performance systems and subsystems, such as sharp-cutoff frequency response, low passband insertion-loss and high return-Joss, high out-af-band rejection, compact size, low cost and ease <b>of</b> integration. <b>The</b> filters are approximately 70 % smaller than their conventional counterparts. Analysis and mathematical modeling of these microstrip devices involved <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> transmission-line theory and EM simulation tools which were based on <b>the</b> method <b>of</b> moments and finite element analyses. Measured results were used to validate the predicted behavior and performance of these devices. In fact there was good agreement with the theory and simulation modeling. A Composite right/left-handed (CRLH) metamaterial unit-cell whose ground-plane is defected with a rectangular dielectric slot was used to develop a single and multi-pole bandpass filters. <b>The</b> <b>unit-cell</b> comprises <b>of</b> serial inter-digital capacitors whose junction is connected to a short-circuited inductive stub. By defecting <b>the</b> ground-plane <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>unit-cell</b> 's structure <b>with</b> a dielectric slot, which is located immediately below <b>the</b> <b>unit-cell,</b> enables substantial tuning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> filter's centre frequency in <b>the</b> order <b>of</b> 26. 5 %. This was achieved with minimal effect on the unitcell's insertion- and return-loss performance as well as its selectivity. The filters were fabricated on conventional dielectric substrate and their performance measured to verify the design methodology. The proposed technique eases the trade-off constraints that plague conventional filter designs and makes possible <b>the</b> realization <b>of</b> challenging filter specifications constituted from CRLH unit-cells using distributed transmission-lines. A novel multilayer technique is presented that enables (i) <b>the</b> control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> filter's bandwidth, (ii) significantly improves its passband selectivity, and (iii) enhances its out-of-band rejection without affecting the filter's overall dimensions. The technique involves implementation of identical filter structures on both sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dielectric substrate that are interconnected through vias. The filter circuit is laid on top of another identical substrate with a ground-plane. This structure results in a device that exhibits a sharp selectivity that is substantially smaller than traditional filter constructions. <b>The</b> sharpness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> filter is due to the upper and lower transmission zeros present on either side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> filter's passband being shifted closer together which causes reduction in its bandwidth. This effect is opposite to that encountered in conventional multilayer filter structures. It is shown the filter's bandwidth can be controlled while maintaining a good passband insertion- and return-loss performance, i. e. 10 dB, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed filter is relatively easy to fabricate using conventional technology. A diplexer was developed based on the proposed multilayer technique and was shown to yield a high out-af-band rejection and high isolation between the two very closely spaced channels. Normally isolators are used to provide isolation between channels in order to prevent inter-channel interference. The technique is relatively simple to realize and cost effective to manufacture. Design methodology and experimental results are presented that show good correlation between the measured and simulation results. This diplexer should find application in multi band wireless communication systems. A triplexer deSign is also presented whose multiband performance was created using CRLH <b>unit-cell</b> structures. <b>The</b> three passband channels <b>of</b> <b>the</b> triplexer have a common input splitter and transmission-line matching network is used to ensure high isolation between the channels is maintained in order to prevent undesired interaction between the channels which would otherwise adversely affect the triplexer's passband response. This was achieved using stepped impedance lines (SIL). No isolators were necessary using the proposed technique. It is also shown that by curving the SIL can provide enhancement in the triplexer's loss performance, bandwidth, and suppression of high order spurii. The design analysis and performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> triplexer was verified via fabrication and measurement. A novel compact microstrip wideband bandpass filter was presented for wideband application that possesses good insertion- and return-loss, sharp frequency selectivity and high out-of-band rejection. The proposed filter comprises of two inter-digital capacitors with four inductive stubs. It employs a T-shaped open stub that is inserted between the symmetrical unitcell structures.

SSSs are composed of polygonal unit-cells, which can change side lengths and corner angles. These changes are made possible by each side and corner consisting of at least two different shields, or layers <b>of</b> material.

40|$|International audienceAcoustic {{metamaterials}} {{constitute a}} new class of acoustic structures, composed of periodic arrangements of engineered unit-cells, that exhibit macroscopic acoustic properties not readily available in nature.

40|$|A unit-cell {{model was}} {{developed}} for open metallic foams in order to predict their effective elastic moduli and the plastic collapse strengths. The model {{is based on the}} metallic ligament frame <b>of</b> tetrakaidecahedral shape. <b>The</b> frame structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>unit-cell</b> was analyzed using the finite element method. The plastic collapse strength was determined when <b>the</b> joints <b>of</b> ligaments became plastic hinges under <b>the</b> assumption <b>of</b> elastic-perfectly plastic material behavior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> metallic material. Both elastic modulus and plastic collapse strength were computed using a single step of finite element analysis without any iterative or incremental procedure.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the relaxed micromorphic {{material}} model for anisotropic elasticity {{is used to}} describe <b>the</b> dynam-ical behavior <b>of</b> a band-gap metamaterial with tetragonal symmetry. Unlike other continuum models (Cauchy, Cosserat, second gradient, classical Mindlin-Eringen micromorphic etc.), the relaxed micromorphic model is endowed to capture all the main microscopic and macroscopic characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> targeted metamaterial, namely, stiffness, anisotropy, dispersion and band-gaps. <b>The</b> simple structure <b>of</b> our material model, which simultaneously lives on a micro-, a meso-and a macroscopic scale, requires only <b>the</b> identification <b>of</b> {{a limited number of}} frequency-independent and thus truly constitutive parameters, valid for both static and wave-propagation analyses in the plane. The static macro-and micro-parameters are identified by numerical homogenization in static tests on <b>the</b> <b>unit-cell</b> level. <b>The</b> 3 macro-parameters are obtained by imposing periodic boundary conditions thus mimicking the structure at large. The 3 micro-parameters can be uniquely identified for a unit-cell, which (i) represents <b>the</b> <b>unit-cell</b> <b>with</b> maximal stiffness and (ii) preserves its tetragonal symmetry. Both conditions (i) and (ii) are built on <b>the</b> inherent rationale <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relaxed micromorphic model. The missing mesoscopic elastic parameters directly follow from a recently developed harmonic-mean type micro-macro homogenization rule, which establishes the general relation between the elasticities in the micromorphic model on its three scales. The remaining inertia parameters for dynamical analyses are calibrated on <b>the</b> dispersion curves <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same metamaterial as obtained by Bloch-Floquet analysis for two wave directions. We demonstrate via polar plots that the obtained material parameters describe very well <b>the</b> response <b>of</b> <b>the</b> structural material for all wave directions in the plane, thus covering <b>the</b> complete panorama <b>of</b> anisotropy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> targeted metamaterial. Our findings suggest, that a deeper understanding of micromorphic continuum models for anisotropic elasticity can pave the way towards future developments such as <b>the</b> conception <b>of</b> morphologically complex (meta-) structures by finite element analyses...|$|R
