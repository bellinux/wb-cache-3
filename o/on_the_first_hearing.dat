Musharraf later assumed control of the government as chief executive. Initially, the prime minister's mindset was to remove the chairman Joint Chiefs and the Chief of Army Staff first, then deposed the Chief of Naval Staff and the Chief of Air Staff, who had played the role destroying the credibility of prime minister.

60|$|There are {{two modes}} of giving {{to the name}} of a Kind this sort of significance. The best, but which {{unfortunately}} is seldom practicable, is when the word can be made to indicate, by its formation, the very properties which it is designed to connote. The name of a Kind does not, of course, connote all the properties of the Kind, since these are inexhaustible, but such of them as are sufficient to distinguish it; such as are sure marks of all the rest. Now, it is very rarely that one property, or even any two or three properties, can answer this purpose. To distinguish the common daisy from all other species of plants would require the specification of many characters. And a name can not, without being too cumbrous for use, give indication, by its etymology or mode of construction, of more than {{a very small number of}} these. The possibility, therefore, of an ideally perfect Nomenclature, is probably confined to the one case in which we are happily in possession of something approaching to it—the Nomenclature of elementary Chemistry. The substances, whether simple or compound, with which chemistry is conversant, are Kinds, and, as such, the properties which distinguish each of them from the rest are innumerable; but in the case of compound substances (the simple ones are not numerous enough to require a systematic nomenclature), there is one property, the chemical composition, which is of itself sufficient to distinguish the Kind; and is (with certain reservations not yet thoroughly understood) a sure mark of all the other properties of the compound. All that was needful, therefore, was to make the name of every compound express, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>hearing,</b> its chemical composition; that is, to form the name of the compound, in some uniform manner, from the names of the simple substances which enter into it as elements. This was done, most skillfully and successfully, by the French chemists, though their nomenclature has become inadequate to the convenient expression of the very complicated compounds now known to chemists. The only thing left unexpressed by them was the exact proportion in which the elements were combined; and even this, since the establishment of the atomic theory, it has been found possible to express by a simple adaptation of their phraseology.|$|E

The problem of accurate identification of alarm {{sounds in the}} operating room, recovery room, and intensive care environment has persisted for many years. Monitors made by different companies may have different alarm sounds for the same monitored variable, and similar alarm sounds for different variables. In an effort to illustrate universal alarms sounds, a system of six musical alarm tones was designed with musical themes from popular songs used for oxygenation, ventilation, cardiovascular monitoring, temperature monitor-ing, artificial perfusion, and drug administration systems. These melodies were played {{for a group of}} anesthesiologists and others, who were initially asked to guess the organ system for each melody. The answers were then given to the partici-pants, and after a short delay the melodies were played again in a different order. Seventy-nine response sheets were col-lected. The expected random score was 1. 0 + 1. 0 SEM cor-rect. The observed score <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>hearing</b> was 1. 5 -+ 1. 6 SEM, p = 0. 01 compared with the random score. The ob-served score on the second testing was 4. 3 + 2. 2 SEM, p = 0. 001 compared with the first hearing. Indeed, 42 of 79 (53 %) respondents got all six answers correct on the second testing, versus three respondents for the first testing. The implications of these findings are discussed in the context of integrated alarm systems u ed in complex medical environments such as the operating room...|$|E

As for the criterion of deafness, ones that can not hear 2 tones at 20 db or one at 25 db were considered deaf. Deaf ears and doubtful cases for deaf determined by the method just mentioned, were re-examined on two other occasions and the changes in their hearing were investigated.

RESULTS: the comparison between <b>the</b> <b>first</b> day, first, second and third months after the hearing aids were fitted revealed a statistically significant improvement (p< 0. 001) between the results, not only for the PISR but also for the S/N ratio. No statistically significant difference was found for the results obtained through the questionnaire applied in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> and third months. CONCLUSION: the objective evaluation, using speech recognition tests, presents better results in the months following the hearing aids fitting indicating a progressive improvement in the speech abilities from <b>the</b> <b>first</b> month onwards. <b>The</b> subjective evaluation does not reveal an improvement when comparing <b>the</b> <b>first</b> and third moths after the hearing aids were fitted...|$|R
