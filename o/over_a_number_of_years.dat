5|$|In August, Clinton {{signed the}} Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, which passed Congress without a Republican vote. It cut taxes for 15 million low-income families, made tax cuts {{available}} to 90percent of small businesses, and raised {{taxes on the}} wealthiest 1.2percent of taxpayers. Additionally, it mandated that the budget be balanced <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> through the implementation of spending restraints.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a meeting}} with {{attorneys}} on May 10, 1961 intended to resolve the dispute, Dave Guard resigned from the Kingston Trio, though pledging to fulfill group commitments through November of that year. Shane, Reynolds, and Werber bought out Guard's interest in the partnership for $300,000 to be paid <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> and moved to replace him immediately. The remaining Trio partners settled quickly on John Stewart, a 21-year-old member of the Cumberland Three, one of the myriad of groups that sprang up hoping to imitate the Kingston Trio's success. Stewart was already well-acquainted with Reynolds and Shane, having sold two of his early songwriting efforts to the Trio, {{and he was a}} proficient guitarist, banjoist, and singer who seemed to the partners to be perfectly positioned to replace Guard. Stewart began rehearsing and recording with the group nearly immediately, commencing public appearances with the Trio in September 1961.|$|E
5|$|John Gilchriese {{became friends}} with John Flood, who had been Wyatt Earp’s secretary, confidante, and best friend for many years. When Earp died, Flood {{inherited}} many of his personal belongings. Flood in turn willed them to Gilchriese, who amassed <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> {{one of the largest}} collections of personal items belonging to Wyatt and Virgil Earp, along with many unpublished photos of them and their family. Gilchriese opened the Wyatt Earp Museum in Tombstone in 1966 and commissioned Western artist Don Perceval to paint the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral. The oil on masonite painting titled The Street Fight is 6 feet 4 inches by 4 feet (1.93 m by 1.22 m). It was the largest work ever executed by Perceval. He referred to original documents in Gilchriese's collection, including Wyatt Earp's own diagram of the shootout, and unpublished notes made by John Flood, to create what is regarded as the most accurate depiction of the shootout. Gilchreise had 500 lithographic prints reproduced from the original, which Perceval signed. The prints were sold by the museum for $10.|$|E

25|$|The Ring {{is a major}} {{undertaking}} for any opera company: staging four interlinked operas {{requires a}} huge commitment both artistically and financially; hence, in most opera houses, production of a new Ring cycle will happen <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>years,</b> {{with one or two}} operas in the cycle being added each year.

25|$|M. Daphne Kutzer of the State University of New York at Plattsburgh {{argues in}} Beatrix Potter: Writing in Code that {{the charm of}} Appley Dapply's Nursery Rhymes lies in the {{illustrations}} rather than the text, and that the book (like other nursery rhyme collections) is not a sustained narrative {{but a series of}} short verses. Such collections are typically unified in style and design, but Appley Dapply lacks this unity because the illustrations range <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> in which Potter's style changed significantly.|$|E
25|$|Cirrhosis is most {{commonly}} caused by alcohol, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Typically, {{more than two}} or three alcoholic drinks per day <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> is required for alcoholic cirrhosis to occur. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease has a number of causes, including being overweight, diabetes, high blood fats, and high blood pressure. A number of less common causes of cirrhosis include autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cholangitis, hemochromatosis, certain medications, and gallstones. Diagnosis is based on blood testing, medical imaging, and liver biopsy.|$|E

Investigations by PricewaterhouseCoopers and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority highlighted a need for cultural change. The losses were a result of a failed speculative position where the traders falsified profits to trigger bonuses <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>years.</b> In order to actually generate the reported profits, the traders speculated on the US dollar, betting that it would rise against the Australian dollar and other currencies.|$|E

25|$|Maud {{is one of}} {{only two}} {{surviving}} Norfolk trading wherries to be found on the Norfolk Broads. Maud was built in 1899, and served as a sailing wherry and later as a lighter before being sunk in the mid-1960s as protection for part of the banks of Ranworth Broad. In 1981, she was refloated and taken to Upton where she was restored <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>years,</b> finally returning to the water in 1999. As of 2010, Maud is active on the Norfolk Broads. She is listed on the register of National Historic Ships in the United Kingdom, as part of the National Historic Fleet.|$|E
25|$|The {{core part}} of the {{fundraising}} programme {{is focused on the}} cathedral's fabric. The major conservation-restoration projects already identified will cost £30 million. Fabric conservation is the most urgent element of the campaign. The appeal - the third of its kind following major fundraising drives at Canterbury in the 1950s and 1970s - was launched to fund these projects. Fundraising for the appeal will take place <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> both nationally and internationally, stressing the cathedral's role as the mother church of the worldwide Anglican Communion and as a World Heritage Site. An integrated conservation programme that addresses the priority areas has been drawn up by the cathedral's Surveyor to the Fabric, John Burton.|$|E

In early October 2014, Boko Haram released a video containing the decapitation of who they claimed was a captured Nigerian Air Force pilot of a downed Alpha Jet. In March 2016, attacks performed by Nigerian Alpha Jets had reportedly dislodged Boko Haram fighters from Sambisa Forest, Borno State.|$|E
25|$|The {{magnetic}} mini-mover procedure (3MP) is {{a technique}} used to correct pectus excavatum by using two magnets to realign the sternum {{with the rest of}} the chest and ribcage. One magnet is inserted 1cm into the patient's body on the lower end of the sternum, the other is placed externally onto a custom fitted brace. These two magnets generate around 0.04tesla (T) in order to slowly move the sternum outwards <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>years.</b> The maximum magnetic field that can be applied to the body safely is around 4T, making this technique safe from a magnetic viewpoint. The 3MP technique's main advantages are that it is more cost-effective than major surgical approaches such as the Nuss procedure and it is considerably less painful postoperatively.|$|E
25|$|Although fully mineralized and {{containing}} no water—and {{therefore not}} subject to dehydration and subsequent crazing as seen in opal—ammolite is often damaged due to environmental exposure. The thin, delicate sheets in which ammolite occurs are also problematic; for these reasons, most material is impregnated with a clear epoxy or other synthetic resin to stabilize the flake-prone ammolite prior to cutting. Although the tessellated cracking cannot be repaired, the epoxy prevents further flaking and helps protect the relatively soft surface from scratching. The impregnation process was developed <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> by Korite {{in partnership with the}} Alberta Research Council. Impregnated and epoxy-coated ammolite first entered the market in 1989 and the treatment significantly increased the availability and durability of the gem.|$|E
