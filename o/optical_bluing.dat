40|$|We present very early, high-cadence {{photometric}} {{observations of}} the nearby Type Ia SN 2017 cbv. The light curve is unique in {{that it has a}} blue bump during the first five days of observations in the U, B, and g bands, which is clearly resolved given our photometric cadence of 5. 7 hr during that time span. We model the light curve as the combination of early shocking of the supernova ejecta against a nondegenerate companion star plus a standard SN Ia component. Our best-fit model suggests the presence of a subgiant star 56 solar radii from the exploding white dwarf, although this number is highly model-dependent. While this model matches the optical light curve well, it overpredicts the observed flux in the ultraviolet bands. This may indicate that the shock is not a blackbody, perhaps because of line blanketing in the UV. Alternatively, it could point to another physical explanation for the <b>optical</b> <b>blue</b> bump, such as interaction with circumstellar material or an unusual nickel distribution. Early optical spectra of SN 2017 cbv show strong carbon absorption up through day - 13 with respect to maximum light, suggesting that the progenitor system contains a significant amount of unburned material.

Specifically we focus on the sample of 486 bright (B_T 10 ks) exposure. The X-ray sources detected within the optical extent of each galaxy are categorised as either nuclear or non-nuclear depending on whether the source is positioned within or outside of a 25 arcsecond radius circle centred on the optical nucleus. A nuclear X-ray source is detected in over 70 % of the galaxies harbouring either a Seyfert or LINER nucleus compared to a detection rate of only ~ 40 % in less active systems. The correlation of the H alpha luminosity with nuclear X-ray luminosity previously observed in QSOs and bright Seyfert 1 galaxies appears to extend down into the regime of ultra-low luminosity (L(x) ~ 10 ^ 38 - 10 ^ 40 erg/s) active galactic nuclei (AGN).
