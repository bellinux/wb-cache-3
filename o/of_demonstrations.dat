5|$|Although the June 28, 1969, Stonewall riots are {{generally}} considered {{the starting point}} of the modern gay liberation movement, a number <b>of</b> <b>demonstrations</b> and actions took place before that date. These actions, often organized by local homophile organizations but sometimes spontaneous, addressed concerns ranging from anti-gay discrimination in employment and public accommodations to the exclusion of homosexuals from the United States military to police harassment to the treatment of homosexuals in revolutionary Cuba. The early actions have been credited with preparing the gay community for Stonewall and contributing to the riots' symbolic power.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the method}} <b>of</b> <b>demonstration</b> in experimental phenomenology. The theoretical basis of experimental henomenology and meanings <b>of</b> <b>demonstration</b> in psychology are examined. The term 'demonstration' in psychology typically means {{the presentation of}} concrete illustrations of facts generally to teach or to persuade scientifically, the reference to conclusive observational proof derived from theoretical arguments and opposition {{to the definition of}} experiment. The methodological inadequacies of these meanings for experimental phenomenology are illustrated. In experimental phenomenology the aim <b>of</b> the <b>demonstration</b> is to show the evidence for a law using a non- propositional argument. Two examples <b>of</b> <b>demonstration</b> from the studies of Wertheimer and Michotte are analysed...|$|R

They patrolled the taverns to prevent the men from betraying the duty of militancy with bottles of wine. They also took care of many organizational aspects and were particularly active in proselytizing for the movement, decorating the stage of the rallies, preparing ceremonies such as the inauguration opening of the flag of the Fasci, and welcoming the leaders who came to the towns with flowers.|$|E

It was part of a global outcry by the Tamil diaspora to end the Sri Lankan Civil War, investigate acts of war crimes by the Government of Sri Lanka, and restore civil rights for Tamils in Sri Lanka. The aim was also to create awareness and appeal to leaders, notably the Prime Minister of Canada, Stephen Harper, the President of the United States, Barack Obama and the Consulate General of Sri Lanka in Canada, Bandula Jayasekara, to take action in ending the conflict. Several Tamil Canadian citizens and business-owners from different parts of Canada and the United States took part in major protests set up in Toronto and Ottawa, while smaller scale demonstrations took place in Montreal, Vancouver and Calgary.|$|E
