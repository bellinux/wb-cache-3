40|$|Abstract <b>Operational</b> <b>discharges</b> of {{produced}} water and drill cuttings from offshore {{oil and gas}} platforms are a continuous source of contaminants to continental shelf ecosystems. This paper reviews recent research on the biological effects of such discharges with focus on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. The greatest concern is linked to effects of {{produced water}}. Alkylphenols (AP) and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) from produced water accumulate in cod and blue mussel caged near outlets, but are rapidly metabolized in cod. APs, naphtenic acids, and PAHs may disturb reproductive functions, and affect several chemical, biochemical and genetic biomarkers. Toxic concentrations seem restricted to < 2  km distance. At the peak of discharge of oil-contaminated cuttings fauna disturbance was found at more than 5  km from some platforms, but is now seldom detected beyond 500  m. Water-based cuttings may seriously affect biomarkers in filter feeding bivalves, and cause elevated sediment oxygen consumption and mortality in benthic fauna. Effects levels occur within 0. 5 – 1  km distance. The stress is mainly physical. The risk of widespread, long term impact from the <b>operational</b> <b>discharges</b> on populations and the ecosystem is presently considered low, but this cannot be verified from the published literature...|$|R

40|$|On 8 - 9 September 2002, {{an extreme}} {{rainfall}} event {{caused by a}} stationary mesoscale convective system (MCS) occurred in the Gard region, France. Distributed hydrologic and hydraulic modelling {{has been carried out}} to assess and compare the various sources of data collected operationally and during the post-event field surveys. Distributed hydrological modelling was performed with n-TOPMODELs and assessed for ungauged basins with the discharge estimates of the post-event surveys. A careful examination of the occurrence in time and space of the flash floods over the head watersheds indicates that flooding was controlled by the trajectory of the convective part of the MCS. Stationarity of the MCS over the Gardon watershed (1858 km 2 at Remoulins) for 28 h was responsible for the exceptional magnitude of the flood at this scale. The flood dynamics were characterized by an extensive inundation of the Gardonnenque plain upstream of the Gardon Gorges resulting in a significant peak flow reduction downstream. One-dimensional unsteady-flow hydraulic modelling was found to be required to reproduce these dynamics.

Local floodings and debris flows following exceptional downpours often come without any adequate warning and cause heavy tolls to the human society. This work proposes a novel flood alert system for small catchments prone to flash flooding, capable of monitoring {{a large portion of}} the European domain. Operational streamflow simulations are produced through distributed hydrological modeling of ensemble weather forecasts. A long-term reforecast dataset is run through the same hydrological model to derive coherent warning thresholds. These are compared with <b>operational</b> <b>discharge</b> ensembles in a threshold exceedance analysis to produce early warnings. A case study in the southern Switzerland is tested over a 17 -month period and system skills are evaluated by means of different quantitative and qualitative analyses. Results from three different predictors derived from the streamflow ensemble are shown and compared, also by accounting for the persistence of lagged forecasts. Significant improvements in predicting discharge thresholds exceedance are achieved by fitting gamma probability distributions to the raw ensemble. Further discussion underlines the limits of predictability of extreme events in small catchments due to the comparatively coarse space–time resolution of current weather forecasts. JRC.

40|$|Abstract: Coastlines {{and birds}} {{blackened}} by mineral oil are an icon for {{the risks involved}} in the transport of mineral oils. Regulations governing such transport have been developed {{since the end of}} the 19 th century. In the 1970 s, international environmental protection standards were introduced through Annex I of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution by Ships and it’s Amendments (MARPOL 73 / 78) for mineral (black) oil tankers. Regulation of the maritime transport of other bulk liquids, such as chemicals, in special tank ships (chemical tankers) has also been developed since that time (as Annex II to MARPOL), thus leaving the transport of vegetable oils more or less unregulated. Today, about a third of the tank ship capacity non-licensed for mineral oils is used for vegetable (white) oils. Volumes are increasing. Marine environmental protection became an issue when fl oating vegetable oils coated birds and European coastlines in the early 1990 s. As this damage to birds were caused by <b>operational</b> <b>discharge</b> and not by accident, no press pictures of oiled animals appeared in the media. Th e revision of the environmental regulations was advocated only by experts in maritime aff airs and pollution prevention.

40|$|Oil spills {{in the sea}} is one of {{the most}} serious hazard for coastal and marine environments. The main {{contribution}} to oceans oil pollution is related to <b>operational</b> <b>discharge</b> from tankers (e. g. oil dumped during cleaning operations) that spread in the sea the equivalent of one full-tanker disaster every week. In order to reduce the environmental impact of such a kind of hazards, timely detection and continuously updated information are fundamental and satellite remote sensing could give an important contribution in such a direction. In particular meteorological satellite, thanks to their high temporal resolution and to an easy data delivery, can be profitably used for a near real time sea monitoring. Recently, two new methodologies for oil spill detection and monitoring, both based on the general Robust Satellite Technique (RST) approach, have been proposed. The first one, based on the multi-temporal analysis of AVHRR Thermal Infrared (TIR), have shown good capability in automatically detect, with high level of reliability, oil spill presence. The second one, by using MODIS visible (VIS) data, have been applied, with encouraging results, for a detailed mapping of the oil slick. In this paper we have exported the RST AVHRR TIR approach to MODIS TIR data in order to guarantee the availability of both the methodologies and their specific advantages (high reliability in TIR channels, better spatial resolution in the VIS) by using a single multispectral sensor.

40|$|Abstract: Fish {{attempting}} to move upstream through hydroelectric dams can be trapped {{and killed in}} turbines. Understanding fish movement patterns can provide useful insights for how to manage dam operation and maneuvers to minimize fish kill in turbines. We evaluated the movements and abundance of two migratory fish (Prochilodus argenteus and Pimelodus maculatus) most affected by turbine operation, using acoustic telemetry and cast nets in the tailrace of Três Marias Dam (São Francisco River, Brazil) from 31 October 2011 to 16 February 2012. The General Linear Models were applied in the data in order to access the influence of time period (diurnal and nocturnal) and <b>operational</b> <b>discharge</b> (turbine and spillway) on the biotic data. The majority of tagged fish left the tailrace in less than one week, however some individuals returned, performing several visits to the tailrace. The number of visits was influenced by time period, turbine and spillway discharge. Although the time period was the only important contributor to the visits performed by P. argenteus, the movements of P. maculatus were significantly influenced by the three factors. We found that whereas P. argenteus was predominantly diurnal, P. maculatus showed nocturnal habits. Additionally, visits of P. maculatus were significantly lower during minimum turbine and spillway discharge. This result agrees with temporal changes in fish abundance in the tailrace. The number of P. maculatus captured using cast nets was also significantly lower during minimum turbine discharge. These results provide hydropower managers with useful information about the likelihood of occurrence of a fish injuries/kills events since these impacts can occur in combination with fish attraction to the tailrace. With an increased understanding of the behavior and vulnerability of fish species to turbine operational maneuvers, future operational procedures of hydropower facilities may be modified and adapted {{in order to protect}} native species...|$|E

The main waste source is the ship based <b>operational</b> <b>discharges.</b> Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) can be effectively used for the detection and classification of oil spills. Oil spills appear as dark spots in SAR images. One major advantage of SAR is that it can generate imagery under all weather conditions. However, similar dark spots may arise from a range of unrelated meteorological and oceanographic phenomena, resulting in misidentification. A major focus of research in this area is the development of algorithms to distinguish ‘oil spills’ from ‘look-alikes’.

This paper describes {{the development of a new}} approach to SAR oil spill detection using Segmentation method and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). A SAR-based oil-spill detection process consists of three stages: image segmentation, feature extraction and object recognition (classification) of the segmented objects as oil spills or look-alikes.

Satellite remote sensing can be a useful tool for the management of such types of marine hazards, namely oil spills, mainly owing to the synoptic view and the good trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution, depending on the specific platform/sensor system used. In this paper, an innovative satellite-based technique for oil spill detection, based on the general robust satellite technique (RST) approach, is presented. It exploits the multi-temporal analysis of data acquired in the visible channels of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board the Aqua satellite in order to automatically and quickly detect the presence of oil spills on the sea surface, with an attempt to minimize "false detections" caused by spurious effects associated with, for instance, cloud edges, sun/satellite geometries, sea currents, etc. The oil spill event that occurred in June 2007 off the south coast of Cyprus in the Mediterranean Sea has been considered as a test case. The resulting data, the reliability of which has been evaluated by both carrying out a confutation analysis and comparing them with those provided by the application of another independent MODIS-based method, showcase the potential of RST in identifying the presence of oil {{with a high level of}} accuracy...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} four decades, {{there have been many}} catastrophic oil spills in the marine {{environment}} and these larger oil spills have often caused environmental devastation especially if they occurred in the coastal marine area. Serious ecological damage can also be caused from <b>operational</b> <b>discharges,</b> ballast and bilge water, from ships within territorial waters. Until now New Zealand has only had relatively minor oil spillages in its coastal waters, primarily from ships' discharge or accidental leaks in port. The possibility however of a major oil spill occurring within our coastal area is considerably higher today than 20 years ago as there has been a significant increase of all types of oil tankers/bulk carriers/container ships to New Zealand. New Zealand is an island nation that relies heavily on the marine environment for commercial operations such as fisheries and tourism and many New Zealanders enjoy recreational, aesthetic and spiritual ties to the coastal marine area. The sustainability of our territorial sea is therefore of paramount importance. A major oil spill could cause widespread ecological damage, cripple or destroy marine/tourism operations and ensure that the human values associated with the coast are lost, possibly for many years. The research reported here addresses the issue of oil spill preparedness and response in New Zealand's waters. A combination of a review of New Zealand's international commitments and domestic legislation and two case studies of high profile oil spills: the Poor Knights Islands Marine Reserve and the Jody F Millennium are used. The research identifies whether the present environmental legislation, that promotes sustainable management, is proactive in the prevention of a major oil spill and concludes that the New Zealand approach reflects a relatively strong Sustainable Imperative position rather than one of Sustainable Development.

40|$|Abstract. Oil is the {{pollutant}} with the longest history of international attention and vessel-source pollution {{is the most}} famous internationally regulated area of marine pollution. Ship-related oil pollution is attributed mostly to <b>operational</b> <b>discharges</b> which have consistently overshadowed accidental <b>discharges.</b> Most <b>operational</b> spills stem from ship-routine operations such as loading and discharging of cargoes, receiving bunkers, ballasting and deballasting, tank washing, and are caused by broken hoses, defective valves, overfilling of tanks, leaks from manifold flanges, blowing lines etc, along with the human intervention. Apparently {{the majority of these}} incidents happen either close to the mainland or within port areas and terminal stations resulting usually in small spills which are being tackled by the local authorities and are seldom reported. Accidental oil spills are the result of collisions, groundings, explosions, hull and machinery damage, war operations, mixed accidents and generally give rise to severe pollution incidents but are less frequent. In this paper we analyze 295 cases of ship incidents that caused or likely to cause oil pollution in the Mediterranean Sea during the period 1981 - 2000. The main source of information has been extracted from the REMPEC database which recorded all the incidents that had occurred in the Mediterranean Sea in the aforementioned period. We attempt to assess the available data with the aid of advanced intelligent techniques, namely machine learning and inductive decision trees. Inductive machine learning is based on entropy information criteria applied to either nominal or numerical data representing database information. The inductive learning methodology is applied for producing automated domain-dependent expert knowledge by mining the data corresponding to ship-incident reports. The outcome of the analysis corresponds to a meaningful set of decision rules, also represented as a top-down classification tree. 1...|$|R

The <b>operational</b> oil <b>discharges</b> connected with offshore production platforms could, however, have equally severe effects in the offshore environment because the pollution occurs day after day {{as long as the}} activities that produce it continue to operate. This study is concerned with such discharges in the North Sea. The study focused on the central actors involved in the standard-setting process for <b>operational</b> or chronic <b>discharges.</b> Each key actor was interviewed in depth to determine their perceptions of the problem, the role of other actors, the alternatives considered and the interactions among actors. This decision-making complex thus includes a variety of decision-making units with varying abilities to influence the outcomes of the standards.

The objectives of the regulators and developers are described along with the alternative regulations, treatments and uses of the environment that are considered. Then a comparison and evaluation of the decision process by which Norwegian and U. K. regulators arrived at discharge standards is made. Major findings include the near similarity of the standards set even though the approaches to such standards are perceived to be quite different in each country. Another finding is that entrepreneurial endeavor for oil discharge treatment equipment is a key parameter in deciding on standards since both countries must rely on such effort for what is available. Lack of information on the effects of oil in the sea is another finding along with a minimal role for environmental quality factors in setting standards. Such findings make it difficult to trace trade-offs in the selection process for standard setting. Finally, some suggestions for improvements in this process are noted...|$|R

In terms of observed spills, {{there has been a}} significant decline in the numbers of spills and volume of oil entering the marine environment over more than two decades. This is also the case for discharges from oil and gas installations, where OSPAR Commission monitoring data identifies a very large fall in <b>operational</b> <b>discharges</b> from installations over the last decade in particular. The decadal OSPAR Quality Status Reports have also identified improvements in the region while identifying areas for further action in reducing oil inputs still further, especially from ageing oil and gas infrastructure. Projects such as Bonn Agreement BE-AWARE have mapped and identified the risk of oil pollution across the region, while Bonn-OSINet and COSIweb have resulted in improved methods to not only identify the make-up of an oil spill but also to increase the likelihood of matching samples from a spill to samples from potential sources. Beached bird surveys also provide a tool in monitoring not only the impacts of large spills from accidents but also levels of chronic oil pollution in coastal and offshore areas. The results of investigations into oil pollution in the waters of Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark and Germany are discussed, while an examination of the legal structure for monitoring and dealing with oil pollution in UK waters is presented. Legislative measures such as the MARPOL Convention, EU Directive on Port Reception Facilities and national legislation have contributed to a reduction in oil being <b>discharged</b> through <b>operational</b> activities from ships, while accidental spills have also been reduced as a result of better vessel standards and improved traffic management in the southern and eastern North Sea.

40|$|The Hanford Site's 200 Area Effluent Treatment Facility (ETF) {{processes}} contaminated {{aqueous wastes}} derived from Hanford Site facilities. The treated wastewater occasionally contains tritium, which cannot be removed by the ETF {{prior to the}} wastewater being discharged to the 200 Area State-Approved Land Disposal Site (SALDS). During the first 11 months of fiscal year 2008 (FY 08) (September 1, 2007, to July 31, 2008), approximately 75. 15 million L (19. 85 million gal) of water were discharged to the SALDS. Groundwater monitoring for tritium and other constituents, as well as water-level measurements, {{is required for the}} SALDS by State Waste Discharge Permit Number ST- 4500 (Ecology 2000). The current monitoring network consists of three proximal (compliance) monitoring wells and nine tritium-tracking wells. Quarterly sampling of the proximal wells occurred in October 2007 and in January/February 2008, April 2008, and August 2008. The nine tritium-tracking wells, including groundwater monitoring wells located upgradient and downgradient of the SALDS, were sampled in January through April 2008. Water-level measurements taken in the three proximal SALDS wells indicate that a small groundwater mound is present beneath the facility, which is a result of <b>operational</b> <b>discharges.</b> The mound increased in FY 08 due to increased ETF discharges from treating groundwater from extraction wells at the 200 -UP-l Operable Unit and the 241 -T Tank Farm. Maximum tritium activities increased by an order of magnitude at well 699 - 48 - 77 A (to 820, 000 pCi/L in April 2008) but remained unchanged in the other two proximal wells. The increase was due to higher quantities of tritium in wastewaters that were treated and discharged in FY 07 beginning to appear at the proximal wells. The FY 08 tritium activities for the other two proximal wells were 68, 000 pCi/L at well 699 - 48 - 77 C (October 2007) and 120, 000 pCi/L at well 699 - 48 - 77 D (October 2007). To date, no indications of a tritium incursion from the SALDS have been detected in the tritium-tracking wells. Concentrations of all chemical constituents were within Permit limits or were below method detection limits when sampled during FY 08. A summary of the chemical constituent concentrations or method detection limits is provided in Table 3 - 2 in the main text discussion. This report presents the results of groundwater monitoring and tritium-tracking samples from the SALDS facility during FY 08. Due to the 30 -day laboratory turnaround for analysis of proximal well groundwater samples, this report addresses available date extending from August 1, 2007, through September 30, 2008 (August 2007 data {{were not included in the}} FY 07 report). Updated background information, which is necessary to understand the results of the groundwater analyses, is also provided on facility operations. Interpretive discussions and recommendations for future monitoring are also provided, where possible...|$|R

40|$|For {{many large}} {{irrigation}} systems, distributing water equitably is a stated management objective. Canal operations plans specify which canal {{to operate at}} what discharge for each irrigation interval to achieve the stated objective. In this study, {{a function of the}} Gini index is incorporated in to an integer program that can develop a canal operations plan. In contrast with earlier canal operations planners that minimize inequity, the operations planner presented herein does not constrain the discharge in a canal to a binary integer. Rather, the user can define an allocation cost function that in turn defines the preferred <b>operational</b> range of <b>discharge</b> over which any canal should be operated for any interval. The operations planner can also be modified to permit spillages. The model is applied to a secondary canal in Pakistan, and the sensitivity of the results to operational range and permissible spillage are explored. An engineering application of the model is presented. Peer Revie...|$|R
40|$|Oceans cover 70 % of the world's {{surface and}} {{are a source of}} 90 % of the world's biomass. Oceans provide the world's populations with food and {{facilitate}} international trade in goods. The shipping industry is a notable source (although not leading source) of marine pollution both from <b>operational</b> <b>discharges</b> and maritime incidents. With a vast number of ships navigating the world's oceans the impact of maritime incidents, especially of bulk carriers of oil, on the marine environment can be devastating. Ships which become distressed often attempt to find a 'place of refuge', being nearby port or a sheltered area within the territorial waters of a nearby coastal state. Traditionally these ships in distress had the customary law right of entry into port {{in order to ensure that}} persons on board could be saved. This position seems to have changed in the modern age. With the advancement of modern technology persons on board can be saved without bringing the distressed ship into port. In addition, these ships in distress present a serious risk to the marine environment within the waters of the coastal state. Coastal state practice seems to indicate that coastal states prioritise the preservation of their own sovereign waters over the needs of the particular ship in distress, especially where there is no risk to human life. It would seem that the traditional customary law rights of ships in distress do not apply to circumstances where there is no risk to the persons on board and where there is only a risk to the marine environment. These ships are now commonly called ships in need of assistance and are differentiated from ships in distress due to the fact that the risk is one to the marine environment and not to human life. The result of the refusing places of refuge creates the problem of ships in need of assistance as such ships proceed to beg for entry from other nearby coastal states usually being refused along the way. Through the discussion of notable maritime incidents of this nature it will be shown that such refusal of entry by coastal states into a place of refuge is a leading factor that increases the probability of a maritime incident occurring and thereby increasing the likelihood of damage to the marine environment. The concept of state sovereignty has been utilised as a justification for coastal states refusing entry into a place of refuge. This dissertation will discuss the concept of coastal state sovereignty paying particular attention to the legislative and enforcement rights of coastal states in the regulation of pollution and the protection of the marine environment. The international community has long since recognised that the protection of the marine environment is a general state duty and a principle of international customary law. The duty to protect and preserve the marine environment guides, informs and restricts coastal state action. This dissertation analyses the relationship between sovereignty and the duty to protect the marine environment in the context of ships in need of assistance in modern international law. This dissertation seeks to conclude with an overall analysis of the current customary and modern international law rights of ships in need of assistance in order to determine whether coastal states are obliged to grant places of refuge. The IMO Guidelines will be discussed to analyse whether same add any value to the problem of ships in need of assistance and to what end such guidelines indicate further development on this issue...|$|R
40|$|Gated spillways {{are often}} {{necessary}} to provide both <b>operational</b> flexibility and <b>discharge</b> capacity to pass large flood events. However, gated spillways present operational challenges to dam owners and operators, often necessitating development of a flood operations plan (FOP) that is used {{in tandem with the}} dam’s emergency action plan (EAP). Even a well-intentioned and robust FOP/EAP can require personnel to predict flooding, use judgment particular to the requirements of the plan, and react quickly. In addition, all of the equipment required to operate the gates need to function as designed and be operated in accordance with the FOP. This paper presents a framework for evaluating the risks related to gate operations during floods, considering operations in accordance with the FOP, as well as operations that deviate from the FOP/EAP due to operator (human) error or system (mechanical/electrical/structural) malfunction. Case studies are presented to evaluate the downstream impacts of gate operations (or misoperation) for a range of flood events. A basis for quantitative evaluation of risks is included. Considerations for improving operation plans and replacement of spillway gates with more reliable passive systems are presented in the context of risk framework.

40|$|The {{environmental}} impact of systems managing large (kg) tritium amount represents a public scrutiny issue for the next coming fusion facilities as DEMO. Furthermore, potentially new dose limits imposed by international regulations (ICRP) shall impact next coming devices designs and the overall costs of fusion technology deployment. Refined environmental tritium dose impact assessment schemes are then overwhelming. Detailed assessments can be procured from {{the knowledge of the}} real boundary conditions of the primary tritium discharge phase into atmosphere and into soils. Lagrangian dispersion models using real-time meteorological and topographic data provide strong refinement. Advance simulation tools are being developed in this sense. The tool integrates modeled numerical records from European Centre for Medium range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) with a lagrangian atmospheric dispersion model (FLEXPART). The model results can be coupled with tritium dose secondary phase pathway assessment tools. Nominal tritium <b>discharge</b> <b>operational</b> reference and selected incidental ITER-like plant systems tritium form source terms have been assumed. The real-time daily data and mesh-refined records together with lagrangian dispersion model approach provide accurate results for doses to population by inhalation or ingestion in the secondary phase...|$|R
40|$|Mercury {{discharge}} lamps are critical in many trapped ion frequency standard applications. An integrity monitoring {{system can be}} implemented using end-of-life signatures observed in <b>operational</b> mercury <b>discharge</b> lamps, {{making it possible to}} forecast imminent failure and to take action to mitigate the consequences (such as switching to a redundant system). Mercury lamps are used as a source of 194 -nm ultraviolet radiation for optical pumping and state selection of mercury trapped ion frequency standards. Lamps are typically fabricated using 202 Hg distilled into high-purity quartz, or other 194 -nm transmitting material (e. g., sapphire). A buffer gas is also placed into the bulb, typically a noble gas such as argon, neon, or krypton. The bulbs are driven by strong RF fields oscillating at. 200 MHz. The lamp output may age over time by two internal mechanisms: (1) the darkening of the bulb that attenuates light transmission and (2) the loss of mercury due to migration or chemical interactions with the bulb surface. During fabrication, excess mercury is placed into a bulb, so that the loss rate is compensated with new mercury emanating from a cool tip or adjacent reservoir. The light output is nearly constant or varies slightly at a constant rate for many months/years until the mercury source is depleted. At this point, the vapor pressure abruptly falls and the total light output and atomic clock SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) decrease. After several days to weeks, the light levels decrease to a point where the atomic clock SNR is no longer sufficient to stay in lock, or the lamp self-extinguishes. This signature has been observed in four separate end-of-life lamp failures while operating in the Deep Space Network (DSN). A simple integrator circuit can observe and document steady-state lamp behavior. When the light levels drop over a predetermined time interval by a specified amount (e. g., 20 percent), an alarm is set. For critical operational applications, such as the DSN or in space flight, this warning provides notice that a failure may be imminent, and for operators or control algorithm to take action...|$|R

The Li 2 S~O 4 has been further characterized by infrared, ESCA, and X-ray analyses. A number of organic compounds including CH 4 and 3, 5 -diamino- 2, 4 -hexenenitrile hav been identified in forced overdischarged cells.

40|$|In {{nitrogen}} drilling, entrained sand {{particles in}} the gas flow may cause erosive wear on metal surfaces and {{have a significant effect}} on the <b>operational</b> life of <b>discharge</b> pipelines, especially for elbows. In this paper, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations based code FLUENT is carried out to investigate the flow erosion on a sand discharge pipe in conjunction with an erosion model. The motion of the continuum phase is captured based on solving the three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations, while the kinematics and trajectory of the sand particles are evaluated by the discrete phase model (DPM). The flow field has been examined in terms of pressure, velocity, and erosion rate profiles along the flow path in the bend of the simulated discharge pipe. Effects of flow parameters such as inlet velocity, sandy volume fraction, and particle diameter and structure parameters such as pipe diameter and bend curvature are analyzed based on a series of numerical simulations. The results show that small pipe diameter or small bend curvature leads to serious erosion, while slow flow, little sandy volume fraction, and small particle diameter can weaken erosion. The results obtained from the present work provide useful guidance to practical operation and discharge pipe design...|$|R
