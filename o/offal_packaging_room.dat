40|$|Contamination of sliced {{cooked meat}} {{products}} with a Lactobacillus sake starter strain was suspected to cause spoilage in the products {{before the end}} of the expected shelf life. Slicing and vacuum packaging of the cooked products was done in the room in which the fermented product was handled. Since L. sake strains are known to be a dominant part of spoilage microflora associated with vacuum-pack-aged meat products, a contamination study was performed. One hundred and eighteen strains were isolated from 6 spoiled vacuum packaged meat products and from the surfaces of the <b>packaging</b> <b>room</b> and adjac-ent refrigerators. DNA was isolated from these strains and cleaved using Eco RI and Hind III restriction endonucleases to obtain characteristic ribotypes. Corresponding ribotypes of the L. sake starter strain were compared to the 14 different patterns obtained from the strains growing in spoiled products and on surfaces by Eco RI digestions. The L. sake starter strain was shown to contaminate the <b>packaging</b> <b>room</b> and it was also isolated from one of the products. However, it was not a dominant strain in this product and it could not be linked to the other products. Our results indicated that handling the fermented product in the refrigerating and <b>packaging</b> <b>rooms</b> together with cooked products was not the major cause of spoilage in these products...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to validate/calibrate two tools to be able to {{reliably}} measure/predict warpage at ambient temperature, especially for ball grid array (BGA) electronic packages. The tools used in this study were a high-precision microscope and a finite-element model. First, the authors calibrated the microscope by comparing the obtained results with the results obtained with a shadow moirÃ© machine (considered as reference) and then the finite-element model was calibrated to the microscope. The numerical study was not restricted to a deterministic approach; a stochastic study was also performed for taking into account parameter uncertainties. The results demonstrated that both tools are reliable alternatives for thermomechanical characterization of BGA <b>packages</b> at <b>room</b> temperature. The results obtained in the finite-element model calibration phase showed the importance of adopting a probabilistic approach, at the same time proving that the elaborated warpage numerical model is a good basis for future advanced analysis such as optimization or numerical design of experiments while having reasonable investment and time-consumption costs...|$|R

The trial was conducted at the seed laboratory of the Department of Agronomy and Horticulture, Faculty of Agriculture, Bogor Agriculture University in March- October 2005. The experiment was arranged in completely randomized design with three factors. The first factor was packaging materials (paper, polyethylene and aluminum foil); the second factor was storage room conditions (ambient room, Air Conditioned (AC) room and refrigerator); the third factor was storage periods (0, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 weeks). The result of this research showed that packaging materials gave significant effect on the dry weight of normal seedling. Storage periods gave very significant effect on germination percentage, dry weight of normal seedling, maximum growth capacity, and vigor index. The interaction between <b>packaging</b> materials, storage <b>room</b> conditions and storage periods gave very significant efflect on germination rate.

30|$|The results {{suggested}} that the cold plasma streamers of air gas could be efficient in the disinfection of A. flavus spores in solid foods. The plasma streamers had no {{significant effect on the}} temperature, pH, moisture and color of the sample.

The research instruments developed in this work, guarantied deactivation of A. flavus spores on pistachio surface inside a closed <b>package</b> at <b>room</b> temperature. The disinfections of heat-sensitive food surfaces with plasma streamers open up an alternative novel route for the development of advanced technologies for the elimination of fungal contamination, provided that an ideal gaseous compound together with a proper electric power supply is employed.

Dairy and food industries are fast growing industries and day-by-daynewer technologies are being introduced to get better quality of foods. Use ofconventional energy is common practice for major processing of milk. At present all mostall dairy operations are performed using grid supply with diesel gen-set as backup. Milkprocurement system has changed in India and now milk is being procured by maintainingcold chain to improve its microbial quality. The village level co-operative societies for milkcollections are provided by bulk milk coolers operating on conventional grid supply ofelectricity and in case of unavailability of electric supply diesel generator sets are providedfor cooling the milk. To overcome the problem of continuous grid supply of electricityand diesel generator sets, solar based refrigeration system for milk cooling at society levelis quiet feasible. Most of the milk processing operations, room conditioning for milkproduct packaging and cold stores for milk & milk products are operating on grid electricsupply. To overcome problem of peak load penalty, the part load can be shared by solarbased vapour absorption system for such operations. The use of solar energy in the dairyis generally found for hot water supply to boiler, hot water generator for processing ofmilk or for CIP cleaning.
