5|$|Abd al-Rahman at {{this time}} was a {{flamboyant}} figure with broad popular support. His stature served to diminish that of the politicians, who were seen as his followers rather than as leaders. Abd al-Rahman could not afford a sudden British withdrawal, since that would <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>for</b> an Egyptian take-over {{and the loss of}} his power. The British also were against an Egyptian take-over, but for different reasons. Yet Abd al-Rahman could not be seen as supporting an indefinite colonial status, and continued to promote independence. Abd al-Rahman and the British were engaged in delicate and unstable arrangements characterized by mutual distrust.|$|E

25|$|All of NY357 was {{originally}} designated {{as part of}} NY7B {{as part of the}} 1930 renumbering. North of North Franklin, NY7B continued to NY7 in Oneonta by way of an overlap with NY28. On November 27, 1969, the New York State Department of Transportation Commissioner T. W. Parker announced that NY7B would be renumbered to NY357 effective January1. 1970. This new designation would also truncate NY7B off the overlap with NY28 to Oneonta and simply signage for drivers to understand in the city. This would also <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>for</b> signage to be added for future Interstate88 If the weather permitted, the official signage would be replaced in the spring of1970. On January1, 1970, NY7B was truncated southward to the southern terminus of its overlap with NY28 and renumbered to NY357.|$|E

25|$|Moyne {{arrived in}} his car with his driver, Lance Corporal Arthur Fuller, his secretary, Dorothy Osmond, and his ADC, Major Andrew Hughes-Onslow. The ADC went to {{open the front door}} of the {{residence}} and the driver got out to <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>for</b> Moyne. They were suddenly told not to move, as Bet-Zuri emerged and shot Fuller in the chest, causing him to collapse in the driveway and bleed to death in minutes. Hakim then pulled the car door open and shot Moyne three times. The first bullet hit him in the neck on the right side, just above the clavicle, the second penetrated his abdomen, punctured his colon and large intestine, and became embedded to the right of the second lumbar vertebrae, while the third shot, fired after Moyne raised his right hand, ripped across four of his fingers and went in and out of his chest, causing no serious injuries.|$|E
25|$|Three 11-year-old boys rode {{their bikes}} {{into the west}} parking lot to {{purchase}} soft drinks. Hearing {{a member of the}} public yell something unintelligible from across the street, all three hesitated, before Huberty shot the three boys with his shotgun and Uzi. Joshua Coleman fell to the ground critically wounded in the back, arm, and leg; he later recalled looking toward his two friends, Omarr Alonso Hernandez and David Flores Delgado, noting that Hernandez was on the ground with multiple gunshot wounds to his back and had started vomiting; Delgado had received several gunshot wounds to his head. Coleman survived; Hernandez and Delgado both died at the scene. Huberty next noticed an elderly couple, Miguel Victoria Ulloa (74) and Aida Velazquez Victoria (69), walking toward the entrance. As Miguel reached to <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>for</b> his wife, Huberty fired his shotgun, killing Aida with a gunshot to the face and wounding Miguel. An uninjured survivor, Oscar Mondragon, later reported that he had seen Miguel cradling his wife in his arms and wiping blood from her face. Miguel shouted curses at Huberty, who approached and killed him with a shot to the head.|$|E

25|$|In early 2006, Benefis {{sought to}} stop the Great Falls Clinic from {{purchasing}} 20-bed Central Montana Surgical Hospital. The clinic had partnered with Essentia Health, a non-profit healthcare system based in Minnesota and North Dakota, to purchase Harold Poulsen's outstanding stock in Central Montana Surgical Hospital and gain a controlling interest in the surgical hospital. Benefis sued to prevent the transaction, arguing that the new owners intended to run the facility as a specialty hospital in contravention of a 2005 state law banning further construction {{of these types of}} facilities and that the Clinic and Essentia did not apply for the required health care facility license. The health system won a temporary restraining order. Benefis also said it stood to lose $4 million a year in revenues if Central Montana Surgical Hospital was licensed as a general hospital. The company said it would likely close its renal dialysis unit, suspend Mercy Flights, shutter its nursing home, and end outpatient psychiatric and chemical dependency services. Benefis also said it would lose several million dollars a year in federal payments as well. On March 24, the injunction was lifted. Benefis filed an emergency motion with the Montana Supreme Court three days later, appealing the district court's ruling. The state of Montana then issued a six-month provisional license to Central Montana to operate as a general hospital. But on October 4, 2006, the Montana Supreme Court ruled 4-to-3 to uphold the district court's dismissal of the temporary injunction. However, the state supreme court declined to rule on other issues raised by Benefis' lawsuit, and left <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>for</b> the company to continue litigation in the district courts. On November 6, 2006, Benefis declined to appeal the high court's ruling and said it would not bring the other issues back to the district court. In February 2007, the Clinic sued Benefis to recover its legal fees. A state judge ruled in September 2007 that Benefis must pay these fees.|$|E

In the second minute-long clip, Raul discusses the medals he received for his parks-related accomplishments, including [...] "doing away with people making speeches in the parks", [...] "organizing the garbage so it's not all over the place" [...] and [...] "looking at the leaves".

500|$|One of Nhu's {{objectives}} was {{to trick}} dissidents into joining the false uprising {{so that they}} could be identified and eliminated. Another objective of the public relations stunt was to give a false impression of the strength of the regime. The first stage of the scheme would involve loyalist soldiers, disguised as insurgents, faking a coup and vandalising the capital. A [...] "revolutionary government" [...] consisting of opposition activists who had not consented to being named in the regime would be announced, while Diệm and Nhu would pretend to be on the run. During the orchestrated chaos of the first coup, the loyalists and Nhu's underworld contacts would kill the leading plotting generals and their assistants, such as Thơ, CIA agent Lucien Conein, and U.S. Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. A fake [...] "counter-coup" [...] was to follow, whereupon the loyalists would triumphantly re-enter Saigon to restore the Diệm regime. However, the plot failed because Đính was part of the coup plot and sent the loyalist forces out of the capital to <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>for</b> the rebels.|$|E
500|$|His {{performance}} {{style has}} been studied by academics who analysed gender, image and sexuality. For example one author noted that Jagger's performance style [...] "opened up definitions of gendered masculinity and so laid the foundations for self-invention and sexual plasticity which are now {{an integral part of}} contemporary youth culture". His stage personas also contributed significantly to the British tradition of popular music that always featured the character song and where the art of singing becomes a matter of actingwhich creates a question about the singer's relationship to his own words. His voice {{has been described as a}} powerful expressive tool for communicating feelings to his audience, and expressing an alternative vision of society. To express [...] "virility and unrestrained passion" [...] he developed techniques previously used by African American preachers and gospel singers such as [...] "the roar, the guttural belt style of singing, and the buzz, a more nasal and raspy sound". Steven Van Zandt wrote: [...] "The acceptance of Jagger's voice on pop radio was a turning point in rock & roll. He broke <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>for</b> everyone else. Suddenly, Eric Burdon and Van Morrison weren't so weird – even Bob Dylan." ...|$|E
500|$|When Jason Takes Manhattan {{failed to}} perform {{successfully}} {{at the box}} office, Sean Cunningham decided {{that he wanted to}} reacquire the rights to Friday the 13th and start working with New Line Cinema on Freddy vs. Jason, as New Line owned the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise. The concept of a fight between Freddy and Jason was not new, since Paramount had approached New Line about filming a crossover years before the latter had gained the licensing rights to Friday the 13th. At that time, both companies wanted the license to the other's character so that they could control the making of the film. Negotiations on the project were never finalized, which led Paramount to make The New Blood. After Jason Takes Manhattan was released in 1989, the rights reverted to Scuderi, Minasian, and Barsamianto, who sold them to New Line. Before Cunningham could start working on Freddy vs. Jason, Wes Craven returned to New Line to make New Nightmare. This effectively put Freddy vs. Jason on hold, but allowed Cunningham the chance to bring Jason back into the spotlight with Jason Goes to Hell. The ninth installment [...] "turned a healthy profit", though it was only intended to <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>for</b> a crossover with Freddy Krueger rather than to start a new series for New Line. Ultimately, the film series would go through another sequel before that would happen. Cunningham's [...] "frustration" [...] with the delayed development of the Freddy vs. Jason project forced him to create another sequel {{in an effort to keep}} the franchise in the minds of audiences. Based on Jason Takes Manhattans concept of taking Jason away from Crystal Lake, the 10th film would put the titular character in space. The film suffered from the loss of its biggest supporter, President of Production Michael De Luca, when he resigned from his position. Lack of support forced the finished film to sit for two years before finally being released on April 26, 2002, and it would go on to become the lowest-grossing film in the franchise at the domestic box office. It also held the distinction of having the largest budget of any of the previous films at that time.|$|E
