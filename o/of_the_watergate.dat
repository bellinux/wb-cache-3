During the 1972 campaign, Cole served as Ohio chair of a future voters organization for the Nixon campaign. She then left politics, devoting her spare time to training and showing horses. In 1974, Cole {{declined to comment on}} the resignation of President Nixon in the wake <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Watergate</b> scandal, but stated in 1977 that she felt sympathy for him, though she believed his resignation was necessary.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the closure}} of the X-Files, the FBI has reassigned Mulder to a {{low-level}} wiretap while his former partner, Dana Scully, has returned to teaching at the FBI Academy. The two have a discreet meeting at the parking lot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Watergate</b> Hotel, where Mulder admits that he has been doubting his belief in the paranormal since Deep Throat's assassination. Mulder flashes back to the night when his sister, Samantha, was abducted.|$|E

5|$|Four {{years after}} the election, Goldwater {{returned}} to the Senate and was re-elected twice. He became an influential member of the party's conservative wing, serving {{as chairman of the}} Select Committee on Intelligence and the Committee on Armed Services. He supported the presidential candidacy and eventual presidency of Richard Nixon; however, he was critical of Nixon's attempt to control prices and wages. Initially, Goldwater defended Nixon in light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Watergate</b> scandal until August 5, 1974, when he withdrew his support. Nixon resigned from office four days later.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Watergate</b> scandal, Kennedy pushed {{campaign}} finance reform; {{he was a}} leading force behind passage of the Federal Election Campaign Act Amendments of 1974, which set contribution limits and established public financing for presidential elections. In April 1974, Kennedy travelled to the Soviet Union, where he met with leader Leonid Brezhnev and advocated a full nuclear test ban as well as relaxed emigration, gave a speech at Moscow State University, met with Soviet dissidents, and secured an exit visa for famed cellist Mstislav Rostropovich. Kennedy's Subcommittee on Refugees and Escapees continued to focus on Vietnam, especially after the Fall of Saigon in 1975.|$|E
5|$|The 1974 Congressional midterm {{elections}} took place {{less than three}} months after Ford assumed office and in the wake <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Watergate</b> scandal. The Democratic Party turned voter dissatisfaction into large gains in the House elections, taking 49 seats from the Republican Party, increasing their majority to 291 of the 435 seats. This was one more than the number needed (290) for a two-thirds majority, the number necessary to override a Presidential veto or to propose a constitutional amendment. Perhaps due in part to this fact, the 94th Congress overrode the highest percentage of vetoes since Andrew Johnson was President of the United States (1865–1869). Even Ford's former, reliably Republican House seat was won by a Democrat, Richard Vander Veen, who defeated Robert VanderLaan. In the Senate elections, the Democratic majority became 61 in the 100-seat body.|$|E
50|$|Carter, {{a native}} Southerner from {{neighboring}} Georgia, carried Tennessee with a 13% {{margin of victory}} against incumbent Ford. <b>The</b> <b>Watergate</b> scandal had severely damaged Ford's predecessor, Richard Nixon, who had resigned in 1974 as a result, and the Republican Party as a whole. The relatively unknown Carter campaigned as a Washington outsider free <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corruption <b>of</b> <b>Watergate,</b> and thus appealed to many voters in the country, including Tennessee.|$|R

On August 1, a $25,000 cashier’s check earmarked for the Nixon re-election campaign was found in the bank account of one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Watergate</b> burglars. Further investigation by the FBI would reveal the team had thousands of dollars more to support their travel and expenses in the months leading up to their arrests. Examination of their funds showed a link to the finance committee of the CRP.|$|E

2500|$|Public {{response}} to Felt and his actions has varied widely since he revealed {{himself to be}} Deep Throat. In <b>the</b> immediate aftermath <b>of</b> <b>the</b> revelation, Felt's family called him an [...] "American hero", suggesting that he leaked information for moral or patriotic reasons. G. Gordon Liddy, who was convicted <b>of</b> burglary in <b>the</b> <b>Watergate</b> scandal, said Felt {{should have gone to}} the grand jury rather than leak.|$|R

50|$|After {{the civil}} unrest during Johnson's administration, Watergate during Nixon's administration, and <b>the</b> public {{exposure}} <b>of</b> COINTELPRO by a dissident organization in 1971, widespread criticism <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Red Squads for illegal and undemocratic tactics emerged. In 1975, in <b>the</b> wake <b>of</b> both <b>the</b> <b>Watergate</b> scandal and <b>the</b> exposure <b>of</b> COINTELPRO, <b>the</b> Church Committee {{was formed to}} investigate overstepping on <b>the</b> part <b>of</b> federal law enforcement and intelligence gathering agencies. Following <b>the</b> recommendations <b>of</b> that committee, <b>the</b> U.S. Congress passed Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) in 1978, placing limits on <b>the</b> power <b>of</b> police and Federal agencies.

50|$|Dahlberg was the Midwest finance {{chairman}} for the Committee to Re-elect the President during President Richard M. Nixon's 1972 campaign.

MacGregor was later appointed <b>the</b> head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Committee to Re-elect the President in 1972, after {{former attorney general}} John Mitchell had resigned. It was later learned the $25,000 came from Dwayne Andreas, {{chief executive officer of}} Archer Daniels Midland, as an anonymous donation to the Nixon campaign. Woodward later commented that finding Dahlberg's check was a turning point in their investigation because it led to <b>the</b> discovery <b>of</b> how <b>the</b> <b>Watergate</b> burglars were financed through a money-laundering scheme.|$|R

500|$|Several <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plot {{elements}} are self-referential to other episodes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> series.

The references to MUFON were purposely placed in the episode to connect to the story-arc involving Scully's cancer, which had been discovered during the show's fourth season. The episode also references and mirrors elements of popular culture. Fowley's apartment was purposely located in <b>the</b> <b>Watergate</b> complex, a hotel notorious as <b>the</b> location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1970s <b>Watergate</b> scandal. <b>The</b> scenes featuring Mulder and Scully being decontaminated were based on a similar scene in the 1962 James Bond film Dr. No, according to Spotnitz.
