40|$|Within {{the wider}} {{debate on the}} {{effectiveness}} of at-sea recovery, this paper investigates whether the particular characteristics of heavy oils warrant special consideration when planning and responding to spills of these oils. The paper reviews arguments for and against greater at-sea recovery efforts than would be justified with <b>other,</b> <b>lighter</b> <b>oils.</b> Attention is given both to theoretical considerations as well as to actual experience gained in such spills of heavy oils as the BALTIC CARRIER, ERIKA, EVOIKOS, NAKHODKA, VOLGONEFT 263 and other spills. The paper reviews and compares the observed effectiveness of state-of-the-art equipment with non-specialised equipment such as mechanical grabs. It is concluded that while heavy oils often warrant special attention, large investment in specialised equipment and R&D are likely to be less beneficial than improved planning and preparation with locally available resources. ...|$|R
50|$|Oil in the McKittrick {{field is}} in 13 {{separate}} pools: 8 in the Northeast Area, and 5 in the Main Area. The most productive pools {{have been the}} Tulare-San Joaquin, Olig, and Basal Reef Ridge in the Main Area, and the Tulare-San Joaquin, Phacoides, and Oceanic in the Northeast Area. Oil API gravity varies between the different pools, with some bearing heavy crude of API gravity 12, and <b>others</b> with <b>lighter</b> <b>oil,</b> such as the Phacoides which reported an average value of 33.

25|$|Modernized and new large {{refineries}} such as {{are found}} in the Midwestern United States and on the Gulf Coast of the United States, as well as many in China, can handle upgrading heavy oil themselves, so their demand is for non-upgraded bitumen and extra-heavy oil rather than SCO. The main problem is that the feedstock would be too viscous to flow through pipelines, so unless it is delivered by tanker or rail car, it must be blended with diluent to enable it to flow. This requires mixing the crude bitumen with a lighter hydrocarbon diluent such as condensate from gas wells, pentanes and <b>other</b> <b>light</b> products from <b>oil</b> refineries or gas plants, or synthetic crude oil from oil sands upgraders to allow it to flow through pipelines to market.|$|R
40|$|A new, unique, IOR {{concept has}} been {{investigated}} for application in <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> reservoirs that have been previously water flooded, but which can be applied at any stage of oil prodn. The method operates via GSGI (gravity stabilized gas injection), but {{does not require the}} injection of displacement gas from the surface. Instead, gas is generated in situ, using a downhole (underground) gasification unit. The economics of the process, in terms of the energy required to produce a barrel of incremental oil appears to be very attractive. In addn. to addnl. oil, the process also produces hydrogen, and other inert gases. These gases can be stored in the reservoir for future use. The primary scope for applying the method appears to be in watered flooded reservoirs, or <b>other</b> depleted <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> reservoirs, in which the pressure has been reduced to less than 150 bar, if co-evapn. of oil and water is employed. However, if water (steam) is injected sep., then there is no restriction on reservoir pressure, within the limits of economic operation. The paper reports the first, preliminary set of results for downhole gasification. A small exptl. gasifier was developed to simulate the steam reforming of 'light naphtha' fractions, cut from <b>light</b> crude <b>oils.</b> Although designed for operation up to 800 DegC and 140 bar pressure, the continuous flow system was restricted in these trials to around 75 bar pressure. The commissioning and preliminary trials used methane gas as feedstock, in order to test if it was possible to convert methane to hydrogen and other gases at significantly higher pressures than those normally used in surface reforming plant. Methane is also a very significant component of most reservoir oils and therefore has an important influence on how much displacement gas can be produced. The initial expts. achieved a hydrogen concn. in the reformer-gasifier exit gas of nearly 60 %. Further trials were also made using a reservoir gas. [on SciFinder (R) ...|$|R

Fingering of flowing water {{is one of the}} serious problems of the oil displacement by water and another problem is the estimation of the amount of recover oil from a petroleum reservoir. To address these problems, the fractional flow of heavy <b>oil</b> and <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> are investigated. The fractional flow approach treats the multi-phases flow rate as a total mixed fluid and then describes the individual phases as fractional of the total flow. Laboratory experiments are implemented for two different types of oils, heavy <b>oil,</b> and <b>light</b> <b>oil,</b> to experimentally obtain relative permeability and fractional flow curves. Application of the <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> fractional curve, which exhibits a regular S-shape, to the water flooding method showed that a large amount of mobile oil in the reservoir is displaced by water injection. In contrast, the fractional flow curve of heavy oil does not display an S-shape because of its high viscosity.

40|$|Purpose: Combustion {{and fuel}} {{qualities of the}} animal-fats {{biodiesel}} as a heating fuel for agricultural hot air heater were studied. Methods: Biodiesel (BD) was made from animal-fats by reacting with methanol and potassium hydroxide in the laboratory. The biodiesel made in the laboratory was tested for fuel and combustion qualities. Results: The kinematic viscosity and the calorific values of the biodiesels were measured. Kerosene based biodiesel, BD 20 (K) showed 18 cSt at- 20 ℃. It seemed that BD 100 was not suitable for a heating fuel under some temperature. As BD content increased, the calorific value decreased up to 40, 000 J/g for BD 100, while the calorific value of <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> was 45, 567 J/g showing difference of 5, 567 J/g, about 12 % difference. Several different fuels including BD 20 (biodiesel 20 % + <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> 80 %), BD 50 (biodiesel 50 % + <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> 50 %), BD 100 (biodiesel 100 %), and <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> were tested for fuel combustion qualities for agricultural hot air heater, and their combustion performances were compared and analyzed. Flame dimensions of biodiesels and <b>light</b> <b>oils</b> were almost the same shape at the same combustion condition. Generally, the CO 2 amounts of BDs were greater than <b>light</b> <b>oil.</b> However, in this study the differences were minor, {{so there was no}} significant difference existed between the BDs combustion and <b>light</b> <b>oil.</b> Conclusions: It seemed that quality was good for heating oil for agricultural hot air heater because of showing no barriers for continuous combustion and proper exhaust gas temperature and CO 2 amount discharged. But, for fuel fluidity for higher BD content fuel could be a detrimental problem in situations where the outdoor temperature is lowered. As BD content increased, calorific value decreased up to 40, 000 J/g for BD 100. Calorific value difference between BD 20 and ligh...|$|R

Methods: Animal fats based on pig biodiesel were manufactured manually and tested for its engine performance in the tractor diesel engine and fuel adoptability in the field works. Four different fuels, three different content of biodiesel (BD 20, BD 50, BD 100) and <b>light</b> <b>oil,</b> were prepared and tested in the four strokes diesel engine. Power output, fuel consumption rate and exhaust gases of the four fuels in the diesel engine were compared and discussed. Results: Power output of <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> engine was the greatest showing 5. 3 % difference between <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> and BD 100, but 0. 37 % better power than BD 20 engine power. Less exhaust gases of CO 2, CO, NOX and THC were produced from animal fats biodiesel than <b>light</b> <b>oil,</b> which confirmed that biodiesel is environmental friendly fuel. For fuel adoptability in the tractor, biodiesel engine tractor showed its fuel competitiveness comparing with <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> for tractor works in the faddy field.
