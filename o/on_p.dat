5|$|Any initial two {{disjoint}} given circles can {{be rendered}} concentric as follows. The radical {{axis of the}} two given circles is constructed; choosing two arbitrary points P and Q on this radical axis, two circles can be constructed that are centered <b>on</b> <b>P</b> and Q and that intersect the two given circles orthogonally. These two constructed circles intersect each other in two points. Inversion in one such intersection point F renders the constructed circles into straight lines emanating from F and the two given circles into concentric circles, with the third given circle becoming another circle (in general). This follows because the system of circles is equivalent {{to a set of}} Apollonian circles, forming a bipolar coordinate system.|$|E

The film takes place in 2027, where two decades of human infertility have left society {{on the brink of}} collapse. Illegal immigrants seek sanctuary in the United Kingdom, where the last functioning government imposes oppressive immigration laws on refugees. Owen plays civil servant Theo Faron, who must help a refugee (Clare-Hope Ashitey) escape the chaos. Children of Men also stars Julianne Moore, Michael Caine, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Charlie Hunnam.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} approach, the given circles are shrunk or swelled (appropriately to their tangency) until one given circle is shrunk {{to a point}} P. In that case, Apollonius' problem degenerates to the CCP , which {{is the problem of}} finding a {{solution}} circle tangent to the two remaining given circles that passes through the point P. Inversion in a circle centered <b>on</b> <b>P</b> transforms the two given circles into new circles, and the solution circle into a line. Therefore, the transformed solution is a line that is tangent to the two transformed given circles. There are four such solution lines, which may be constructed from the external and internal homothetic centers of the two circles. Re-inversion in P and undoing the resizing transforms such a solution line into the desired solution circle of the original Apollonius problem. All eight general solutions can be obtained by shrinking and swelling the circles according to the differing internal and external tangencies of each solution; however, different given circles may be shrunk to a point for different solutions.|$|E
5|$|Studies by Phil Senter in 2007 {{conducted}} <b>on</b> <b>P.</b> neimongoliensis and P. mongoliensis {{concluded that}} the forelimbs of these taxa (and likely those of other Psittacosaurus species) were too short (only about 58% {{as long as the}} hindlimbs) to reach the ground, and their range of motion indicates they could neither be pronated nor generate propulsive force for locomotion, suggesting that Psittacosaurus was entirely bipedal. The forelimbs were also too short to be used in digging or bringing food to the mouth, and Senter suggested that if Psittacosaurus needed to dig depressions in the ground it may have used its hindlimbs instead. The forelimbs could be used for two-handed grasping of objects or scratching the body, but due to their extremely limited flexibility and reach, they could have only been used to grasp objects very close to the belly or sides of the animal and could have scratched only the belly, flank and knees. Even though the hands could not reach the mouth, Psittacosaurus could have still used them to carry nesting material or food to a desired location.|$|E

40|$|Zheng, NF (通讯作者) A facile {{method to}} boost the {{catalysis}} of Pd nanoparticulate catalysts by simple C 2 H 2 treatment is developed. During the C 2 H 2 treatment, Pd nanoparticles serve as active catalysts to polymerize C 2 H 2 into transpolyacetylene. The deposition of trans-polyacetylene layer <b>on</b> <b>Pd</b> nanoparticles makes their surface hydrophobic. Such a hydrophobic surface modification helps to accumulate more hydrophobic substrates during catalysis, making the modified Pd nanoparticulate catalysts more active than untreated catalysts in the catalytic reaction involving hydrophobic substrates. Moreover, the coating of polyacetylene <b>on</b> <b>Pd</b> creates encapsulated Pd nanocatalysts, stabilizing Pd nanoparticles against sintering or aggregation. Since the catalytic polymerization of polyacetylene <b>on</b> <b>Pd</b> is not facet dependent, the development is readily applied to enhance the catalysis of commercial Pd nanoparticulate catalysts by simple C 2 H 2 treatment.

40|$|Zheng, NF (通讯作者) One key {{challenge}} in making high-quality bimetallic nanocrystals {{is to prevent}} self-nucleation of individual metal components. We report in this work an effective seeded growth strategy that uses activated hydrogen atoms as the reducing agent to prepare core-shell bimetallic nanocrystals. In the developed method, Pd nanocrystals serve as the seed and catalyst as well to activate H- 2 for the reductive deposition of Ag. The unique feature of the developed method is that the activated hydrogen atoms are confined {{on the surface of}} the Pd seeds. Consequently, the self-nucleation of Ag is effectively inhibited so that the deposition of Ag occurs only <b>on</b> <b>Pd.</b> The mechanism studies reveal that reductive growth of Ag <b>on</b> <b>Pd</b> seeds proceeds until the Pd surface is fully covered by Ag. The Ag/Pd ratio in the prepared Pd@Ag nanocrystals is readily fine-tuned by the amount of AgNO 3 or H- 2. The method is effective for depositing Ag <b>on</b> <b>Pd</b> nanocrystal seeds with different morphologies such as nanosheets, nanocubes, tetrahedra and nanowires. More importantly, the deposition of Ag <b>on</b> <b>Pd</b> nanowires allows preparation of flexible transparent electrode material with sheet electronic conductivity of 271 S sq(- 1) at a transmittance of over 90 %.
