40|$|All cases {{referred}} for pelvimetry in 1970 - 1 and all breech presentations {{referred for}} pelvimetry in 1972 - 4 were reviewed. Indications for pelvimetry fell into four main categories: high {{head in the}} antenatal clinic (47 - 8 %); high head in labour (13 - 9 %); breech presentation (20 - 9 %); and previous caesarean section (14 - 8 %). In the first two categories pelvimetry rarely if ever influenced management, and {{it should not be}} performed routinely. In breech presentation and cases of caesarean section pelvimetry seemed to be of value, but in the latter group it should be performed puerperally to avoid the known radiation hazard to the fetus. A fairly close correlation between <b>obstetric</b> <b>conjugate</b> and pelvic capacity was shown, which suggested that a 3400 -g baby might pass through a pelvis of <b>obstetric</b> <b>conjugate</b> of 10 cm as a cephalic trial of labour, but would need an <b>obstetric</b> <b>conjugate</b> of 11 - 7 cm for safe vaginal breech delivery...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Normal {{morphological}} {{features of}} the maternal pelvis are an important prerequisite for vaginal delivery. Clinical evaluation and radiopelvimetry are the accepted methods {{for the evaluation of}} the maternal pelvis. But while the clinical method is associated with a subjective error, radiopelvimetry is cumbersome and associated with radiation hazard to the fetus, the ultrasonic measurement of <b>obstetric</b> <b>conjugate</b> is stated to be simple, cost effective,and clinically useful in women with suspected inlet obstruction. This study aimed at evaluating the relationship of ultrasonic measurement of the <b>obstetric</b> <b>conjugate</b> with the type of delivery. "nMaterials and Methods: In a diagnostic value study, 200 primigravidae with a cephalic presentation referred to 2 ultrasonography centers were recruited during a 14 -months period. The <b>obstetric</b> <b>conjugate</b> diameter was measured twice by the means of transabdominal gray-scale ultrasonography at weeks 25 - 30 and 30 - 35 of pregnancy and the mean was employed as the main reading. The optimal cut-off point for predicting vaginal or cesarean delivery was calculated by the ROC curve. "nResults: Two hundred pregnant women with the mean age of 24. 12 &plusmn; 4. 94 (15 - 40) years were enrolled. Finally, the cesarean section (CS) was indicated in 65 (32. 5 %) patients. There {{was no significant difference between}} the first and the second measurements (p= 0. 065). According to the ROC curve analysis,the optimal cut-off point for the <b>obstetric</b> <b>conjugate</b> diameter was &gt; 119. 75 mm in prediction of vaginal delivery with a sensitivity and specificity of 80 % and 78. 5 %, respectively. "nConclusion: According to this study the ultrasonic measurement of <b>obstetric</b> <b>conjugate</b> is an accurate method which almost remains constant during the end of pregnancy; it's easy to be measured and might be confidentially employed for predicting the CS. Almost 80 % of women with a reading of &gt; 120 mm could be expected to end up with the vaginal delivery. Below 100 mm C/S is inevitably expected...|$|E
30|$|For optimal {{preoperative}} treatment {{planning of}} rectal cancer, adequate local staging is {{of paramount importance}} [30]. Factors associated with prognosis are tumour height, T-stage, extramural tumour growth, lymph node status, vascular and neural invasion, threatened CRM and overgrowth to adjacent structures. In addition, narrow <b>obstetric</b> <b>conjugate</b> and shorter interspinous distance appear to be factors leading to poor surgical quality [31].|$|E
40|$|The erect lateral {{radiograph}} pelvimetry measurements {{was related}} to the outcome of labor in 173 patients. The most common indication for pelvimetry was one previous caesarean section in 90 (52 %) patients. Sixty-nine (39. 9 %) pelvimetry measurements were performed because of suspected cephalopelvic disproportion, while 20 (11. 6 %) were done because of breech presentation. In patients with a cephalic presentation at delivery, the mean +/- standard deviation (SD) <b>obstetric</b> <b>conjugate</b> for the 87 women who delivered vaginally (group 1) was 11. 42 +/- 1. 5 cm, while that of the 45 women who had emergency caesarean section (group 2) was 10. 77 +/- 1. 5 cm. The mean +/- SD anteroposterior outlet diameter for groups 1 and 2 were 12. 24 +/- 1. 9 cm and 11. 84 +/- 1. 7 cm respectively. Both differences were found to be statistically significant (p < 0. 001 and p < 0. 05 respectively). The mean +/- SD birthweight of the babies in groups 1 and 2 were 3. 34 +/- 0. 79 kg and 3. 42 +/- 0. 86 kg respectively. There was no statistically significant {{difference between the two groups}} (p < 0. 05).

The evaluated parameters were the <b>obstetric</b> <b>conjugate</b> diameter (OCD), the true conjugate diameter (TCD), the median transverse and transverse diameters (MTD and TD), the intertuberous diameter (ITD), the interspinous diameter (ISD), the anteroposterior diameter (APD) of the pelvic outlet, and the Magnin index (OCD + MTD). There was excellent correlation between EOS® imaging and CT scan or manual measurements for all parameters except for the ISD, which was underestimated on EOS® imaging by 4.9  mm.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} pelvic arch interference and the depth of the pelvic cavity, as shown on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), on the performance of extraperitoneal laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (ELRP). Materials and Methods: In 115 patients, pelvic bone images were obtained at the time of prostate MRI before ELRP. In the reconstructed sagittal plane, we measured the true conjugate diameter, the <b>obstetric</b> <b>conjugate</b> diameter, the difference between the true and obstetric diameters, and the distance between the true conjugate and the prostate apex (pelvic depth). We analyzed which factors were associated with operative time (OT), estimated blood loss (EBL), and positive surgical margins (PSMs). Results: The difference between the true and <b>obstetric</b> <b>conjugate</b> diameters was 12. 7 ± 3. 7 mm, and the pelvic depth was 59. 9 ± 6. 0 mm. The OT, EBL, and the rate of PSMs were 260. 1 ± 91. 1 minutes, 633. 3 ± 524. 7 ml, and 19 % (22 / 115), respectively. According to multiple linear regression analysis, predictors of a higher EBL included pelvic depth (3. 0 % higher per 1 mm increase in diameter difference, p= 0. 01) and prostate volume (1. 5 % higher per 1 cc increase in prostate volume, p= 0. 002). Factors associated with a longer OT were pelvic depth (p= 0. 04), serum prostate-specific antigen (p= 0. 04), prostate volume (p= 0. 02), and Gleason score (p= 0. 001). For PSMs, only pT 2 was an independent factor. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the depth of the pelvic cavity and prostate volume may increase surgical difficulty in patients undergoing ELRP.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{establish}} obstetric {{magnetic resonance}} (MR) pelvimetric reference values {{in a large}} study population and stratify them according to delivery modality and to determine the intra- and interobserver error and intraindividual variability of MR pelvimetric assessment in volunteers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MR pelvimetric data were retrospectively reviewed in 781 women (mean age, 28. 9 years +/- 5. 2 [SD]) clinically referred, and the data were correlated to obstetric history to derive normative values. Five observers assessed results of multiple MR pelvimetric examinations in 10 female volunteers (mean age, 34. 7 years +/- 6. 0; eight nullipara, two primipara) to provide data for measurement error analysis. RESULTS: All values {{were higher in the}} spontaneous vaginal delivery subgroup (n = 100) and lower in the cesarean section or vacuum extraction subgroup (n = 130; intersubgroup difference, P <. 001, Mann-Whitney U test). Pelvimetric parameters in the group undergoing spontaneous vaginal delivery were as follows: <b>obstetric</b> <b>conjugate,</b> 121. 7 mm +/- 8. 6; interspinous distance, 112. 3 mm +/- 7. 9; intertuberous distance, 120. 6 mm +/- 11. 3; transverse diameter, 129. 5 mm +/- 8. 7; and sagittal outlet, 115. 8 mm +/- 9. 9. In the volunteer study, intraobserver, interobserver, and intraindividual reliabilities were high for the <b>obstetric</b> <b>conjugate</b> (0. 94 - 0. 96), interspinous distance (0. 92 - 0. 95), and transverse diameter (0. 95 - 0. 98) but low for intertuberous distance (0. 64 - 0. 87) and sagittal outlet (0. 66 - 0. 85). CONCLUSION: Pelvimetric dimensions are smaller in women undergoing cesarean section or vacuum extraction than they are in those delivering vaginally. The pelvimetric parameters associated with the largest measurement errors are intertuberous distance and sagittal outlet...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo {{demonstrate}} {{the reliability of}} the EOS imaging system in measuring the internal diameters of the bony pelvis. Materials and methodsA prospective study comparing the results of the pelvimetry of 18  dry pelvises carried out on the EOS imaging system to measurements taken manually and using the two current gold standard CT methods. Pelvimetric measurements of each pelvic bone were obtained using four methods and compared: direct manual measurements, spiral and sequential CT pelvimetry, and 2 D- 3 D low-dose biplanar X-rays. The various obstetric diameters were measured to the millimetre and compared. ResultsThere {{was no significant difference in}} the different diameters assessed, with the exception of the interspinous diameter. There was a highly significant correlation (P< 0. 001) between the values measured manually and by EOS for the Magnin index (Pearson= 0. 98), the <b>obstetric</b> <b>conjugate</b> diameter (Pearson= 0. 99), and the median transverse diameter (Pearson= 0. 87). ConclusionThe EOS imaging system allows for an ex vivo determination of the obstetrical diameters that is reliable enough to estimate obstetric prognosis, producing comparable measurements to CT. In view of concerns about protection from radiation, this low-dose imaging technique could become, after in vivo prospective validation, the new gold standard for pelvimetry and therefore a good alternative to CT...|$|E
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{an innovative}} sonopelvimetry method for early prediction of obstructed labour. Methods: A prospective {{study was conducted}} in two centers. GPS-based sonopelvimetry, laborProTM (Trig Medical Inc., Yoqneam Ilit, Israel) devise, was used prior to labour in nulliparous women at 39 - 42 weeks gestation remote from labor. Maternal pelvic parameters, including inter-iliac transverse diameter, <b>obstetric</b> <b>conjugate</b> and interspinous diameter were evaluated. Fetal parameters included head station, biparietal diameter and occipitofrontal diameter. Data on delivery and outcome were collected from the electronic files. Results: The innovative use of sonopelvimetry was applied to 154 consecutive women, none of the participants complained of discomfort or complications observed. The mean time of examination was 15 + 2 minutes. Mean time of examination to delivery interval was 4. 8 days (range 0 - 16 days). Small interspinous diameter and high head station were the best predictors for obstructed labour. Analysis indicated 87 % sensitivity and 61 % specificity for birth weight fetal head station and ISD combined in predicting obstructed labour with an area under the curve of 0. 77. Conclusions: Our results indicate that GPS-based sonopelvimetry combined with fetal estimated weight is a valuable tool in the risk assessment of obstructed labour. Parameters obtained by sonopelvimetry combined with birth weight may be useful...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE The aim of {{our study}} was to measure the impact of supine and upright {{birthing}} positions on MR pelvimetric dimensions. MATERIALS AND METHODS MR pelvimetry was performed in 35 nonpregnant female volunteers in an open 0. 5 -T MR imaging system with patients in the supine, hand-to-knee, and squatting positions. The obstetric conjugate; sagittal outlet; and interspinous, intertuberous, and transverse diameters were compared among positions. RESULTS With patients in the hand-to-knee and squatting positions, the sagittal outlet (11. 8 +/- 1. 3 cm and 11. 7 +/- 1. 3 cm) exceeded that in the supine position (11. 5 +/- 1. 3 cm; p = 0. 002 and p = 0. 01, respectively), as did the interspinous diameter (11. 6 +/- 1. 1 cm and 11. 7 +/- 1. 0 cm vs 11. 0 +/- 0. 7 cm; p < 0. 0001, in both cases). Intertuberous diameter was wider with patients in the squatting position than in the supine position (12. 7 +/- 0. 8 cm vs 12. 4 +/- 1. 1 cm; p = 0. 01). Only the <b>obstetric</b> <b>conjugate</b> was smaller with patients in the upright squatting position than in the supine position (12. 3 +/- 0. 8 cm vs 12. 4 +/- 0. 9 cm; p = 0. 01). Transverse diameter did not change significantly in any position. CONCLUSION An upright birthing position significantly expands female pelvic bony dimensions, suggesting facilitation of labor and delivery...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{assessed}} retrospectively {{the reference}} values of pelvic dimensions by 3 D CT performed for non-obstetrical indications in non-pregnant multiparous {{women with a}} successful vaginal delivery. We further aimed to evaluate the impact of maternal short stature on these parameters. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The 3 D CT pelvimetry was performed retrospectively in 203 non-pregnant women selected consecutively if they {{had at least one}} singleton term delivery with head presentation and if there was no history of maternal or fetal birth trauma or cerebral palsy after childbirth. With standard sagittal and reformatted axial-oblique views, anteroposterior including three conjugates of pelvic inlet, transverse, posterior sagittal diameters of pelvic inlet, the plane of greatest diameter, the plane of least diameter, and pelvic outlet were measured. Selected obstetric parameters were collected. RESULTS: Overall, the pelvises had transverse oval appearance in inlet and size of the female pelvis. The diagonal conjugate was at least 15 mm longer than the <b>obstetric</b> <b>conjugate.</b> Women with short stature had lower maximal birth weight, and this was in accordance with their somewhat lower pelvic diameters. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study present the reference values of the main planes of the true pelvis by 3 D CT pelvimetry in a relatively large group of multiparous women who passed a trial of labor successfully. Overall, the pelvises had features of female pelvic bony structure although pelvic diameters were somewhat lower in multiparous women with short stature. The 3 D pelvimetry with CT applications may be used as an adjunct to clinical and ultrasonographic examinations to rule out cephalopelvic dystocia in selected cases...|$|E
