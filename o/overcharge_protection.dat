Most polymers currently used in battery separators are polyolefin based materials with semi-crystalline structure. Among them, polyethylene, polypropylene, and their blends such as polyethylene-polypropylene are widely used. Recently, graft polymers have been studied in an attempt to improve battery performance, including micro-porous poly(methyl methacrylate)-grafted and siloxane grafted polyethylene separators, which show favorable surface morphology and electrochemical properties compared to conventional polyethylene separators. In addition, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) nanofiber webs can be synthesized as a separator to improve both ion conductivity and dimensional stability [...] Another type of polymer separator, polytriphenylamine (PTPAn)-modified separator, is an electroactive separator with reversible <b>overcharge</b> <b>protection.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Initially, lithium {{cobalt oxide}} {{was used as}} the cathode and polyacetylene as the anode. Later in 1985, it was found that using lithium cobalt oxide as the cathode and {{graphite}} as the anode produced an excellent secondary battery with enhanced stability, employing the frontier electron theory of Kenichi Fukui [...] This enabled the development of portable devices, such as cell phones and laptops. However, before lithium ion batteries could be mass-produced, safety concerns needed to be addressed such as overheating and over potential. One key to ensuring safety was the separator between the cathode and anode. Yoshino developed a microporous polyethylene membrane separator with a “fuse” function. [...] In the case of abnormal heat generation within the battery cell, the separator provides a shutdown mechanism. The micropores close by melting and the ionic flow terminates. In 2004, a novel electroactive polymer separator with the function of <b>overcharge</b> <b>protection</b> was first proposed by Denton, et al. [...] This kind of separator reversibly switches between insulating and conducting states. Changes in charge potential drive the switch. More recently, separators primarily provide charge transport and electrode separation.|$|E

40|$|We {{observed}} that 3 -chloroanisole (3 CA), as an electrolyte additive was very effective for <b>overcharging</b> <b>protection</b> during a 12 V overcharging reaction. During overcharging, the cell voltage {{did not increase}} beyond 5. 3 V, as opposed to other aromatic compounds that showed a voltage shoot-up to 12 V. This behavior {{was due to the}} 3 CA decomposition and the formation of conducting polymer film within separator and at cathode/electrolyte interface, which consumes the surplus current and inhibit the voltage increase through the shunting effect. In addition, the use of 3 CA did not lead to any problems with rate capability, cycle life, and long-term storage behavior at 50 and 70 °C. Furthermore, during storage at 90 °C for 4 and 24 h, electrolyte with 3 CA in a Li-ion cell showed a similar increase of cell thickness as a cell without 3 CA. close 121...|$|R

The model has been experimentally verified using 1, 1 -prime-dimethylferrocene as a redox additive.

At this high concentration, redox shuttles ensure improved <b>overcharge</b> <b>protection</b> than lower concentrations. We developed electroactive imidazolium salts by modifying imidazolium with 2, 5 -di-tert-butyl- 1, 4 -dimethoxybenzene. Two salts with the cation 1 -(3 -(2, 5 -di-tert-butyl- 1, 4 -methoxyphenoxy) propyl) - 3 -methyl- 1 H-imidazol- 3 -ium (EMIm) were synthesized using either hexafluorophosphate (DDB-EMIm-PF 6) or bis(trifluromethanesulfonyl) amide (DDB-EMIm-TFSI)) anions. The electrochemical properties of DDB-EMIm-PF 6 and DDB-EMIm-TFSI dissolved in ethylene carbonate: diethyl carbonate (EC:DEC), {{in the presence}} of either LiPF 6 or LiTFSI, were evaluated.

40|$|Solar energy {{harvesting}} is blooming across the world, {{and it is}} being used for variety of applications; storing the electricity generated from the sunshine for future use is one among these. Batteries are the main components used in off grid solar power harvesting systems to store the power generated from sun light. For storing the electricity into the batteries, we need charge controllers which will control the amount of current flowing into a battery. Conventional battery chargers may fail in monitoring the battery health and are not so intelligent to decide when to charge battery, and are unable to detect faults in a battery charging circuit. Most of time solar panels are mounted on a roof or on poles; due to this the solar modules will not get the enough sunshine to generate electricity throughout the day. And hence the conversion efficiency will be very less. If we use some mechanism to make solar panels to be facing the sun always, we can maximize the incidence of sun radiation on the panel surface and hence the efficiency; this mechanism that makes the solar panel to move according to the sun position is known as solar tracker. In this paper design of an efficient battery charger and smart single axial solar tracker is proposed and developed; that {{will take care of}} battery health and monitor the charging and discharging of battery (like deep discharging, <b>overcharging</b> <b>protection,</b> and control of external loads). And also has an option to charge battery using AC supply in case of low light intensity (during rainy seasons and night hours). The single axis solar tracker will track the sun moment throughout the day and rolls back to the east position once sun sets, and waits for sun to rise. This makes solar panel always facing the sun and enhances th...|$|R

40|$|Recently, {{lithium iodide}} has been {{suggested}} as an additive for secondary lithium batteries to prevent the oxidation of organic electrolytes during charging operations. In this study, the charge and discharge reactions of lithium iodide in 1. 5 M LiAsF 6 /tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution on platinum are investigated with the cyclic voltammetric and rotating disk electrode techniques. At the anodic potentials, lithium iodide is found to undergo atwo-step rocess of oxidation of iodide ion to tri-iodide ion and further oxidation f tri-iodide ion to iodine. The diffusion coefficients of iodide and tri-iodide ions in the electrolyte and the kinetic parameters of the redox reactions on platinum are evaluated from the rotating disk data. It is found that iodine initiates the polymerization ofTHF {{in the presence of}} lithium hexafluoroarsenate. To provide over-charge protection of the lithium batteries using L iAsF J rHF electrolytes, large excess of lithium iodide must be present in the cell to form stable lithium tri-iodide with the iodine generated uring the charging of lithium batteries.

40|$|Lithium-ion {{batteries}} store energy {{through two}} electrochemical reactions. In {{addition to these}} main reactions, many side reactions are possible. The causes and effects of battery side reactions are usually detrimental, sometimes positive, and almost always very complicated. We investigate here both fundamental and applied aspects of several side reactions using experiments and theory. In Part I, we develop a new method to characterize the solid-electrolyte-interphase (SEI), a passivating film that {{is the product of}} side reactions on the graphite electrode, using ferrocene, a redox shuttle. By comparing ferrocene kinetics in the presence and absence of passivating films, the shuttle functions as an electrochemical probe of the mechanism by which the SEI prevents reaction. We develop our method using a model system of a rotating-disk-electrode (RDE) and glassy carbon. Coupling experimental measurements with a physics-based model aids interpretation of the results. We develop both steady-state and transient methods in the model system before applying the methods to highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG), which more closely resembles the carbon found in an actual battery. We study the effects of the relative fraction of edge and basal planes, the formation voltage, and the electrolyte anion. We also attempt in-situ atomic-force microscopy to validate our electrochemical measurements. In Part II, we treat several different overcharge reactions theoretically to explain empirical observations, predict system behavior, and suggest considerations for battery design. We develop a two-dimensional model to explain why lithium deposition occurs preferentially at the edges of electrodes and suggest mitigation techniques. In a separate model, we implement a redox shuttle for <b>overcharge</b> <b>protection.</b> We study how the presence of a redox shuttle affects the macroscale current-potential relations of the battery and optimize the redox potential of the shuttle while considering the tradeoffs between current efficiency and <b>overcharge</b> <b>protection...</b>|$|E
40|$|Although redox {{shuttles}} {{have been}} demonstrated to provide <b>overcharge</b> <b>protection</b> for up to 200 cycles, {{the existence of the}} solid-electrolyte-interphase (SEI), a passivating film on the negative electrode, seems to be inherently incompatible with a successful shuttle reaction. In this work, the kinetics of ferrocene is measured in the presence and absence of passivating films using rotating-disk-electrode voltammetry. The steady-state current-voltage curve is described by a simple model of Butler-Volmer kinetics and a through-film limiting current. The presence of a passivating film decreases both the limiting current and the effective rate con-stant. Both parameters decrease with increased passivation time; a decreasing porosity is a possible explanation for the latter obser-vation. The characterization method developed in this work allows direct measurements of the effect of passivating films, thus contributing to understanding of passivation phenomena in nonaqueous electrolytes...|$|E
