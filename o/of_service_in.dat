However, empirical data on intensity <b>of</b> <b>services</b> <b>in</b> child protection are scarce.

5|$|After the {{war there}} was limited {{resources}} for new rolling stocks and upgrades to the line. Multiple units gradually took over passenger trains, and by 1957, no passenger trains to Storlien were hauled by locomotives. That year Stavne–Leangen Line opened, allowing trains to bypass Trondheim Central Station. The new Di 3 diesel locomotives {{were put into}} service in 1961. The last steam engine was taken out <b>of</b> <b>service</b> <b>in</b> 1971. The introduction of the Di 3 forced an upgrade to the line to allow for an axle load of 18 tonnes. The opening of European Road E14 in the 1950s caused a reduction in shorter-haul passenger and freight. NSB subsequently cut passenger services to a single daily train, with a Di 3 hauling Swedish carriages through Meråker. Trains continuing along the Nordland Line continued to increase.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{initial safety}} concerns, DC-10 {{aircraft}} continued {{to serve with}} passenger airlines for over 30 years after the crash of Flight 191. In the end, it was newer, more fuel-efficient twin-engined airplanes from Boeing and Airbus and not safety concerns that ultimately ended the passenger career of the DC-10. Many retired passenger DC-10s have since been converted to all-cargo use. DC-10 freighters, along with its derivative, the MD-11, form {{the backbone of the}} FedEx Express fleet. The DC-10s have been upgraded with the glass cockpit from the MD-11, thereby turning them into MD-10s. American Airlines retired its last DC-10s in 2000 after 29 years <b>of</b> <b>service.</b> <b>In</b> February 2014, Biman Bangladesh Airlines operated the final DC-10 passenger flights.

5|$|Due to the {{cessation}} of hostilities, YDG-11 saw little or no active service before being berthed with the Pacific Reserve Fleet at San Diego, California.

On 1 November 1947 she was re-designated ADG-11. The ship remained inactive until July 1951, when she was again placed in service. Assigned to the Far East, ADG-11 was based at Yokosuka, Japan until sometime in 1954. After that, her home port was Sasebo, Japan. On 1 February 1955, she was renamed Ampere. The ship was placed out <b>of</b> <b>service</b> <b>in</b> February 1957. Her equipment was transferred to USS Surfbird, a minesweeping vessel which was redesignated a degaussing ship on 15 June 1957.

Her name was struck from the Naval Register on 1 July 1961, and she was sold on 21 June 1962, to the Philippine President Lines of Manila. Her final disposition is unknown.|$|E
