5|$|At dawn on 6 April, the JNA {{launched}} a fresh attack towards Kupres and Kupreška Vrata, leaving {{the bulk of}} the 13th Partisan Brigade in reserve and employing the rest of the force at the plateau. The artillery was used so intensely that the 30th Partisan Division had to request resupply of its depleted stocks. The most effective part of the advance was the 9th Tank Company, which quickly pushed through the defensive positions, bypassed Zlosela and reached Olovo. In contrast, the Bosnian Croat TO command in Kupres was overwhelmed by the complexity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>and</b> could not track which units it had at its disposal—even losing track of units physically near the command post.|$|E

5|$|Finally at 7:58pm, President ceased {{fire and}} hoisted {{a light in}} her rigging, {{indicating}} that she had surrendered. Endymion ceased firing on the defeated American ship but did not board to take possession of her prize, {{due to a lack}} of undamaged boats. Endymions foresails had been damaged in the engagement and while she hove to for repairs, Decatur took advantage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>and,</b> despite having struck, made off to escape at 8.30pm; Endymion, hastily completed repairs and resumed the chase at 8.52pm.|$|E
5|$|In 1792, {{the middle}} and the most notable of the three Tây Sơn brothers, Nguyễn Huệ Quang Trung, who had gained {{recognition}} as Emperor of Vietnam by driving the Lê Dynasty and China out of northern Vietnam, died suddenly. Nguyễn Ánh took advantage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>and</b> attacked northwards. By now, {{the majority of the}} original French soldiers, whose number peaked at less than 80 by some estimates, had departed. The majority of the fighting occurred in and around the coastal towns of Nha Trang in central Vietnam and Qui Nhơn further to the south in Bình Định Province, the birthplace and stronghold of the Tây Sơn.|$|E
5|$|In the morning, Horrocks {{visited the}} Polish {{positions}} at Driel {{to see the}} front for himself. Later, he hosted a conference attended by Browning, Major-General Ivor Thomas of the 43rd (Wessex) Division and Sosabowski at Valburg. In a controversial meeting in which Sosabowski was politically outmanoeuvred, {{it was decided that}} another crossing would be attempted that night. When the Germans cut the narrow supply road near Nijmegen later that day though, it seems Horrocks realised the futility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>and</b> plans were drawn up to withdraw the 1st Division.|$|E

5|$|Lee’s army {{fought a}} series of battles in the Appomattox Campaign against Grant that {{ultimately}} stretched thin his lines of defense. Lee's extended lines were mostly on small sections of thirty miles of strongholds around Richmond and Petersburg, Virginia. His troops ultimately became exhausted defending this line {{because they were too}} thinned out. Grant then took advantage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>and</b> launched attacks on this thirty mile long poorly defended front. This ultimately led to the surrender of Lee and the Army of Northern Virginia at Appomattox.|$|E

Makkhi's father resolves the situation by accepting an apology from Chulbul. Chulbul meets Dayal Babu (Anupam Kher), a local political leader, who also dislikes Chedi. With his help, Chulbul adulterates the breweries of Chedi, and wrongly frames him for it.|$|E
50|$|A deeper {{scrutiny}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>situations</b> <b>and</b> narrative style <b>of</b> Groland's main host, Jules-Edouard Moustic, {{would reveal}} a clear Rabelais influence in Groland.

The images, visual line (by Jérôme Letué) and soundtrack are carefully crafted to depict the Groland characters as driven by greed and luxury.|$|R

5|$|The disorganized {{nature of}} the British retreat {{demonstrated}} a loss of effective command. An experienced commander could easily have encamped at the Lake George landing, taken stock <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation,</b> <b>and</b> begun siege operations against the French. Abercrombie, {{to the surprise of}} some in his army, ordered a retreat {{all the way back to}} the south end of Lake George. Nester, unable to find other rational reasons for this, claims that the general must have panicked.|$|E
5|$|The second Playford was {{something}} of a loner, but at the age of 15 he developed a relationship with a girl five years his senior with whom he fathered a child. In order to avoid the social stigma <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation,</b> <b>and</b> on the advice of his parents, Playford enlisted in the British Army in 1810. While three years under the acceptable age, Playford's height (6ft 2 in) enabled him to pass as eighteen. He spent 24 years {{in the service of the}} Life Guards, fighting all over Europe in Portugal, Spain and France, including the Battle of Waterloo at the age of 20.|$|E

30|$|In practice, the {{assumption}} that vehicles move independently from each other does not hold. Vehicles share the road with other vehicles, and the maneuvers performed by one vehicle will necessarily influence <b>the</b> maneuvers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other vehicles.

Liz confronts Tracy about the problem; he admits {{that he is}} illiterate and agrees to get help. Liz later notices Tracy reading a newspaper, and learns that he was using the ploy to get out of work. Liz tells Tracy that she is not going to take it anymore, and forces him to go through with the sketch.|$|E
5|$|A popular lakon named Irawan Rabi ("Irawan's wedding") {{tells about}} {{the love of}} Irawan and Titisari, a {{daughter}} of Kresna (Krishna). While Titisari is engaged to Irawan, Baladewa (Baladeva), Kresna's brother and an ally of the Kurawas (Kauravas), wants her to marry Lesmana Mandrakumara, the son of Durjudana (Duryodhana), initiating a dramatic conflict. The conflict that ensues ends up being three-sided, among the Pandawas, Kurawas and the ogre-kingdom, whose evil ogre-king Barandjana plans to kidnap Titisari. The confusion that follows results in the outwitting and humiliation of the Kurawas. Siti Sendari, the eldest daughter of Kresna and the estranged wife of Abhimanju, takes advantage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>and</b> schemes to bring Irawan and Titisari together, while also mending her relationships with her husband. Though officially Irawan and Titisari are the hero and heroine of the lakon, in reality they are mere spectators, not the movers, in the play. Brandon describes Irawan as a minor character. Irawan is also depicted as unassertive and manipulated by others, which is common in South Asian theatre. Another lakon called Serat Lampahan Pregiwa Pregiwati also relates a tale about the love of Irawan and Titisari.|$|E
5|$|Alan Brooke, {{commander}} of the British II Corps sought to put the matter of cooperation right with King Leopold. The King discussed the matter with Brooke, who felt a compromise could be reached. Van Overstraeten, the King's military aide, stepped in {{and said that the}} 10th Belgian Infantry Division could not be moved. Instead, the British should move further south and remain completely clear of Brussels. Brooke told the King that the 10th Belgian Division was {{on the wrong side of}} the Gamelin line and was exposed. Leopold deferred to his advisor and chief of staff. Brooke found Overstaeten to be ignorant <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>and</b> the dispositions of the BEF. Given that the left flank of the BEF rested on its Belgian ally, the British were now unsure about Belgian military capabilities.|$|E
