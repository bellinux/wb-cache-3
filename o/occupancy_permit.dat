Freed technically defaulted in March. With cost overruns exceeding $34million as of August 25, Freed owes $128.5million on a $205million construction loan, according to a lawsuit filed in Cook County Circuit Court. On November 3, the developer announced it had landed 13 new tenants to open within the succeeding few months. On November 20, a circuit court judge stripped Freed of the development rights and turn the responsibility over to CB Richard Ellis. On the same day a partial <b>occupancy</b> <b>permit</b> for the underground pedway connecting the red line and the blue line {{as well as the}} first floor retail space was granted. Freed claimed that the loan payments were current and that the default was based on a technicality. As receiver, CB Richard Ellis was scheduled to file a status report with the court December 8 and a full report, including financials, on January 15, 2010. In March 2011, Bank of America acquired the $206 million property with a credit bid of $100 million at a sheriff's foreclosure sale. Then in February 2012, CIM Group was expected to close on a negotiated purchase of the entire 305,000-square-foot shopping center from Bank of America Corp.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The Forest Service Recreation Residence Program {{has been}} {{operational}} since {{the passage of}} the <b>Occupancy</b> <b>permits</b> Act in 1915. In the initial years the Forest Service actively encouraged summer home occupancy with the view that such occupancy encouraged recreational use and assisted in proper forest management and fire control as well as providing a source of income. Approval of further recreation resi-dence development on public land was discontinued in 1968 as program costs exceeded revenues and the perception that such occupation of public land was elitist and potentially restricted public access to desir-able recreation sites. More recently, both the appraisal process and the pursuance of permit violations have become a focus of some political controversy. Recreational residences have often been built by and remain in the same family across generations leading to a strong attachment and identification with a particular forest tract. The study discussed in this paper examines the use of these residences and the meanings of such use to a sample of cottage owners in the Arapahoe-Roosevelt and Pike National Forests in Colorado, USA. A multi-methods approach was used to collect data on cottage use including project analysis, surveys, experiential sampling and in-depth interviews. The rationale underlying the multi-method approach and some preliminary results of this study will be presented in this paper...|$|R

The problem is posed as Constrained Markov Decision Process {{with the goal}} of minimizing the average transmission cost (such as the transmission power) with the constraint on the average holding cost (such as the transmitter delay). Standard Q-learning algorithm is employed to adaptively find the optimal policy for unknown channel/traffic statistics, its convergence properties discussed and shown that it can relatively quickly compute the optimal policy even for rather large state spaces. In order to further improve the convergence rate of the standard Q-learning, we establish several structural results on the optimal policies. We show that the optimal transmission policy is monotonic in the buffer <b>occupancy.</b> This <b>permits</b> us to utilize the supermodularity of the Q-factors and form a structured Q-learning algorithm that increases the convergence rate with respect to the standard Q-learning algorithm.

40|$|We {{theoretically}} {{study the}} quasiparticle resonance states around a nonmagnetic impurity in cuprate superconductors based on t-t'-J-U model. The purpose of introducing the Coulomb repulsive interaction U is to partially impose the double occupancy constraint by employing the Gutzwiller projected mean-field approximation. We determine the spatial {{variation of the}} order parameter and the local density of states (LDOS) by self-consistently solving Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations.

As U decreases the electron double <b>occupancy</b> d is <b>permitted</b> and gradually increases, leading to the decreasing of order parameter.

The measured energy savings from retrofits in buildings in the Texas LoanSTAR program are determined as the difference between the energy consumption predicted by a baseline model and the measured energy consumption during the post-retrofit period. Savings measurement for buildings such as primary and secondary schools is very difficult due to the special operating schedules of these buildings. Currently, savings are often determined by simple pre-post utility bill comparison; they may also be determined with two separate models for the baseline: a 3 -P model for non-summer months, and a mean model for the summer months. (Landman 1996). This thesis proposes a methodology for developing baseline models of energy use for buildings such as schools which have important daily and seasonal variations in occupancy. The method utilizes utility billing data, but also explicitly incorporates <b>occupancy</b> rate, <b>permitting</b> a generalized model which retains the distinction between energy use levels during occupied and unoccupied days of the year. The proposed methodology has been evaluated against the one proposed by Landman for 10 schools in Texas. The major results are summarized below: 1. The CV (Coefficient of Variation of the Root Mean Square Error) values for the proposed methodology are much smaller than those of the 3 -P mean model method, while the average absolute percent error is somewhat smaller for the proposed method, implying that it is suitable for developing baseline models for buildings such as schools that experience large seasonal changes in occupancy patterns. Although this method is a little more complicated it allows a more intuitive and unified model to be identified than the standard 3 -P model. 2. Using daily data from the Dunbar Middle School, it is illustrated that the effect of the schedule on energy use is sometimes comparable to that of outside temperatures for heavily scheduled buildings. This suggests that selection of data periods for baseline model identification should be done with great care. 3. The proposed 4 -P multiple-linear regression model is recommended. It was found to be somewhat more accurate than the 3 -P mean model approach recommended by Landman...|$|R
40|$|Native insulin {{inhibits}} {{the binding}} and degradation of 125 I-labelled insulin in parallel. Half-maximal inhibition of degradation occurs with 10 nm-insulin, a hormone concentration sufficient to saturate the insulin receptor. The proportion of bound hormone that is degraded increases as the insulin concentration is increased, suggesting that low-affinity uptake is functionally related to degradation. Since {{only a small}} fraction (approx. 10 %) of the overall degradation occurs at the plasma membrane, or in the extracellular medium, translocation of bound hormone into the cell is the predominant mechanism mediating the degradation of insulin. In the presence of 0. 6 nm-insulin, a concentration at which most cell-associated hormone is receptor-bound, chloroquine increases the amount of 125 I-labelled insulin retained by hepatocytes. However, chloroquine increases the retention of degradation products of insulin in incubations containing sufficient hormone (6 nm) to saturate the receptor and <b>permit</b> <b>occupancy</b> of low-affinity sites. Glucagon does not compete for the interaction of 125 I-labelled insulin (1 nm) with the insulin receptor. In contrast, 20 μm-glucagon inhibits 75 % of the uptake of insulin (0. 1 μm) by low-affinity sites. A fraction of the cell-bound radioactivity is not intact insulin throughout a 90 min association reaction at 37 °C. During dissociation, fragments of 125 I-labelled insulin are released to the medium more rapidly than is intact hormone. The production and transient retention of degradation products of the hormone complicates the characterization of the insulin receptor by equilibrium or kinetic methods of assay. It is proposed that insulin degradation occurs by receptor- and non-receptor-mediated pathways. The latter {{may be related to the}} action of glutathione–insulin transhydrogenase, with which both insulin and glucagon interact...|$|R
