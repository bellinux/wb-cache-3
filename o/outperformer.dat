This allows us to establish cointegration in the VIX and iTraxx/CDS markets in a demand and supply framework where arbitrageurs exploit temporary equilibrium mispricing following pairs strategies. By shorting the <b>outperformer</b> and buying the underperformer asset, arbitrageurs achieve equilibrium price convergence. Profits from pairs strategies, represented via VECM parameters, guarantee positive expected profits. Empirical estimates suggest that temporary mispricing exists due to a lead of VIX in the discovery process.

In such circumstances, people may indirectly protect their self-images by exaggerating the ability of those who outperform them.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to identify success factors for corporate growth out of these two approaches (hidden champions research, high‐growth companies research) to make the findings fertile for entrepreneurship policy and for entrepreneurship with a growth focus. The article is based on the literature review (theoretical background and research results on high‐growth companies). The paper is a summary of recent research findings regarding SME growth drivers and success factors as well as considerations about the goals of an effective SME and entrepreneurship policy. On the basis of the various empirical research only 6 to 10 % of companies become high‐growth companies. Most high‐growth companies arise in niche markets in low‐involvement industries and are not breakthrough innovators or technology leader. These companies produce the most jobs. Therefore, it is recommended in terms of SME policy not to generally support high technology or ‘trendy’ industries or more or less evenly many companies, but to use research findings for better targeting the companies with the highest potential to become <b>outperformer</b> and ‘jog engines’. The paper can be treated as a unique summary of the ‘state of research’ about successful SMEs and the application of the research findings to an economic policy question (interdisciplinary approach) ...|$|E

40|$|Background: TheWestern Ghats of India {{contain the}} westernmost dipterocarp forests of Asia. However, {{only a few}} dipterocarp tree species {{actually}} coexist in the forest canopy among which Vateria indica and Dipterocarpus indicus are the most common. The mechanisms contributing to the coexistence of these phylogenetically closely related species have not been identified. Aims: We investigated the time- related growth trajectories in diameter, height and crown size of these two species in the Uppangala Permanent Sample Plot to determine if trade-offs in their three-dimensional developmental strategies could contribute to their long-term coexistence. Methods: From annual diameter growth data of 692 trees > 9. 55 cm in diameter at breast height over a 21 -year period, we developed time-related diameter growth models for the two species, accounting for local density-dependent competition effects and topography. Combining the diameter growth models with static stem and crown allometries, we projected time-related tree growth trajectories in height and crown size. Results: While both species can reach similar dimensions, V. indica grows much faster, {{or at least as}} fast as D. indicus in diameter, height and crown size in all the observed situations. Both species respond similarly to topography, but V. indica appears to be more responsive to local density-dependent competition than D. indicus. Finally, V. indica shows higher mortality and recruitment rates and a greater basal area increase than D. indicus. Conclusions: These results refute our hypothesis that D. indicus coexists with the <b>outperformer</b> V. indica by a growth strategy allowing selected individuals in favourable conditions to reach the canopy more quickly than their competitors. The current coexistence of the two dipterocarp species at Uppangala appears not to be at a static equilibrium; V. indica probably being in a phase of canopy stand colonisation...|$|E

However, given that talented people are not evenly distributed across regions, this paper seeks to determine the role of talent for furthering our understanding of regional disparities in Spain. Here, we empirically evaluate the effects of the distribution of talent on regional differences by means of a detailed analysis of the 17 Autonomous Communities of Spain between 1996 and 2004. The static and non-spatial panel data models are constructed. The unit of analysis is NUTS 2. Our findings confirm that the economic performance indicators point to the significant positive impact of talent on regional economic activity. The concentration of talent plays a crucial role in accounting for regional differences.

In an unconditioned circumstance, {{the results show that}} analysts are not biased against conveying negative signals.

We also find that analysts delay their responses to new favorable information for <b>outperformers</b> from which they have received low representative information relative to high representative information.

This {{research}} {{investigates the}} relationship between firm-specific style attributes and the cross-section of equity returns on the JSE Securities Exchange (JSE) over the period from 1 January 1997 to 31 December 2007. Both linear and nonlinear expected returns forecasting models are constructed based on the cross-section of equity returns. A blended approach combining a linear modeling technique with a nonlinear artificial neural network technique is developed to identify future potential top performing shares on the JSE. 1. Both linear and nonlinear models identify book-value-to-price and cash flow-to-price as significant styles attributes that distinguish near-term future share returns on the JSE. 2. This thesis found updating the identity of attributes is equally important as updating the factor payoffs of attributes in applying the stepwise regression approach. 3. Nonlinearity on the JSE equity returns is found to complement the forecasting power of linear factor models. 4. In terms of artificial neural network modeling, the extended Kalman filter learning rule introduced in the thesis is found to outperform the traditional back-propagation approach. 5. This thesis found that updating the identity of attributes via a genetic algorithm in the nonlinear forecasting models is superior to the static nonlinear forecasting models. 6. Both linear and nonlinear models {{are found to be}} more adequate in identifying future <b>outperformers</b> than identifying future underperformers on the JSE.

Methods A systematic search was performed in Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL databases for studies evaluating imaging modalities for the diagnosis of CP up to September 2016. A bivariate random-effects modeling was used to obtain summary {{estimates of}} sensitivity and specificity. Results We included 43 studies evaluating 3460 patients. Sensitivity of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) (82 %; 95 % CI: 76 %- 87 %) was significant {{higher than that of}} abdominal ultrasonography (US) (67 %; 95 % CI: 53 %- 78 %; P= 0. 018). The sensitivity estimates of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and computed tomography (CT) were 81 % (95 % CI: 70 %- 89 %), 78 % (95 % CI: 69 %- 85 %), and 75 % (95 % CI: 66 %- 83 %), respectively, and did not differ significantly from each other. Estimates of specificity were comparable for EUS (90 %; 95 % CI: 82 %- 95 %), ERCP (94 %; 95 % CI: 87 %- 98 %), CT (91 %; 95 % CI: 81 %- 96 %), MRI (96 %; 95 % CI: 90 %- 98 %), and US (98 %; 95 % CI: 89 %- 100 %). Conclusions EUS, ERCP, MRI and CT all have comparable high diagnostic accuracy in the initial diagnosis of CP. EUS and ERCP are <b>outperformers</b> and US has the lowest accuracy.

We systematically reviewed 30 -year evidence on GvHD prophylaxis and quantified the relative effect of different policies using a network meta-analysis. We searched PubMed and the Cochrane Library for randomized studies on the topic. The primary outcome of interest was grade II-IV acute GvHD over 0 or I (with odds ratio OR < 1 denoting benefit). Thirty-three eligible studies that enrolled 3, 440 patients (published up to June 2014), provided data on seven immunosuppressive drugs namely cyclosporin A (CsA), methotrexate (MTX), anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), tacrolimus, sirolimus or corticosteroids and their combinations to calculate 14 direct and 21 indirect effects. The majority of trials (32 / 33) referred to myeloablative conditioning and sibling transplants (25 / 33). Tacrolimus/MTX (OR 0. 44; 95 % 0. 27 - 0. 70, number needed to treat to benefit, i. e. to avert a case of II-IV GvHD, NNTB = 5) and ATG/CsA/MTX (OR 0. 45; 95 %CI 0. 26 - 0. 78; NNTB = 5) were superior over CsA/MTX. ATG/CsA/MTX {{did not differ from}} tacrolimus/MTX (indirect evidence). Sirolimus-based prophylaxis outperformed CsA/MTX (OR 0. 10; 95 %CI 0. 02 - 0. 49, NNTB = 4) and marginally outperformed tacrolimus/MTX (OR 0. 22; 95 %CI 0. 05 - 1. 11). Add-on corticosteroids had no benefit over CsA/MTX. Tacrolimus/MTX and ATG/CsA/MTX were the <b>outperformers</b> over CsA/MTX, but sirolimus-based regimens showed also potential.

40|$|According to {{the agency}} theory, a {{positive}} relationship between company performance and good corporate governance should exist. A broader study of the author of this paper examines a sample of German stock–listed companies whereas Germany can be seen {{as one of the most}} highly regulated countries concerning corporate governance. The overall purpose of the author's study is to analyze the effect of supervisory board characteristics and procedures on firm performance. Several corporate governance variables such as number of committees, board independency, supervisory board compensation, personal risk liability, etc. are examined regarding their effects on firm performance in terms of firm growth and profitability. Two different approaches were selected: (1) a quantitative data analysis, based on financial figures and corporate governance variables, and (2) a survey of supervisory board members out of thissample. The total sample consists of 128 German stock–listed companies. The financial data are obtained from the financial databases providers ThomsonOne and Morningstar. The corporate governance data are also collected from annual reports and from corporate governance compliance statements. According to the German Corporate Governance Codex (DCGK) each stock–listed company has to explain their compliance with the DCGK rules. Thus, the DCGK represents a benchmark of good corporate governance and allows collecting objective and comparable quantitative data to estimate the corporate governance level. The main data analysis methods are bivariate analysis and tests for statistical differences (t–test), the latter in particular to find differences between groups clustered by their 5 –years total shareholder return (TSR) growth resulting in a TSR top– 30 group and TSR bottom– 30 group. While the fulfilment of good corporate governance standards over all shows no significant effect on firm performance, this paper focusses on the findings that risk aversion in the board room is increasing as a result of governance regulations and that growth <b>outperformers</b> have a lower degree of risk aversion. It is concluded that an own–risk deductible inthe D&O insurance policy leads to risk–averse supervisory board behavior and thus to lower TSR growth...|$|R
40|$|Asset pricing models provide {{investors with}} a {{relation}} between risk and expected returns. Higher risk levels should {{be linked to}} higher expected returns. In addition, trading strategies that earn risk adjusted abnormally high or low returns {{are referred to as}} asset pricing anomalies. These asset pricing anomalies present an important challenge for us researchers. Either our asset pricing models are incorrect or there exist frictions in the capital markets allowing such anomalies to persist. A better understanding of these anomalies can help in the development of asset pricing models. Knowledge about these anomalies is of course gained by studying them, which is where my thesis comes in. This dissertation investigates three different topics in asset pricing literature. The first two papers study anomalies. In the first essay the momentum anomaly is investigated. In this respect, the momentum strategy consists of buying previous <b>outperformers</b> and selling previous underperformers. Moreover, this strategy generates abnormal returns. More specifically, the first essay studies the robustness of intermediate-term momentum. The result suggests that the difference found between short-term and intermediate-term momentum is mainly driven by low credit risk firms and that the optimal momentum strategy can be dependent on firm characteristics. In the second essay we investigate the credit risk puzzle. Previous studies have shown that firms with a high credit risk exhibit lower excepted returns than firms with a low credit risk. This phenomenon {{is referred to as the}} credit risk puzzle. Contrary to previous findings, we suggest that the credit risk puzzle is only a temporary occurrence. Furthermore, the reason for this temporary mispricing of high credit risk firms could be the result of stronger limits to arbitrage during the subsample or possibly due to a sudden increased power to the debtholders during the early subsample. The third essay shows that a higher reporting frequency can act as a stabilizing factor in times of market distress. Firms that report quarterly instead of semi-annually experience lower stock price volatility during times of market distress. However, the important systematic volatility is higher for stock prices of firms that report quarterly. Ultimately, there exists a trade-off between higher firm specific systematic volatility on average and lower total volatility in times of market distress...|$|R
40|$|The {{history of}} {{applying}} statistical simultaneous inference methods to a financial problem of mutual fund performance evaluation is very short. A {{major problem in}} applying simultaneous inference methods is the non-trivial dependence among the utilized test statistics. When the number of tests is large, the explicit modeling of dependence structure becomes difficult. As a result, assumptions that are too restrictive are made, which can substantially bias the inference. In addition, the initial performance evaluation model itself can be misspecified and thus distort the results. For instance, the recent study of Barras, Scaillet and Wermers (2008) utilizes a multiple inference procedure with oversimplifying assumptions and, therefore, is prone to both sources of bias. ^ Another under-investigated issue is the statistical power in a typical mutual fund study. The study of Kothari and Warner (2001) makes some progress but their research {{is not based on}} real mutual fund data. ^ This paper catches up with the recent developments in Statistics by applying a state-of-the-art “empirical null hypothesis” concept combined with the” local false discovery rate” method, developed by Efron in 2001 - 2007. That offers a viable alternative to the explicit modeling of high-dimensional dependence structure. In addition, the findings of Efron suggest that the new procedure may account for the performance evaluation model misspecification. The new method also provides informative power measures and an elegant way of comparing the performance of mutual fund subgroups. ^ A comprehensive investigation is performed for about 1900 actively managed US equity mutual funds observed monthly between 1993 and 2007. The results provide a significant extension to the findings of Barras et al. whose method {{can be seen as a}} restricted version of the method in this study. It is shown that the version of Barras et al. has both statistically and practically significant bias. ^ We conclude that, unfortunately, Barras et al. are too optimistic about the performance of US mutual funds. In addition, a detailed power analysis reveals that a typical mutual fund study with monthly dataset and multifactor performance evaluation model has a very low power. Even when <b>outperformers</b> are present in the sample, it usually requires too many years of data to single them out. ...|$|R
40|$|This section briefly {{summarizes}} {{in which}} {{way we have}} investigated momentum in this thesis. In Chapter 2 we alter the momentum strategy to improve its performance, while in Chapter 3 we leave the strategy as is, but aim at improving its performance by hedging. In Chapter 4 we develop a Bayesian latent factor model and apply this model to momentum. In Chapter 2 we apply mean-variance optimization to the equity momentum strategy and compare its performance to other alterations of the momentum strategy. Next to comparing these strategies we test if combining these alterations, including our meanvariance optimization, is able to further improve momentum’s performance. We evaluate whether the optimized and other altered momentum strategies {{as well as their}} combinations reduce momentum’s crash risk and its time-varying risks and returns. In Chapter 3 we hedge equity momentum’s time-varying exposures to the three equity risk factors. We determine the hedge coefficients in two different ways. First, we use the estimated factor loadings of each stock in the momentum strategy at that time to determine momentum’s exposures. Secondly, we use a conditional factor model to estimate momentum’s exposures using momentum’s recent returns. We test whether these hedging strategies reduce momentum’s time-varying risks and returns as well as its crash risk. Finally, we investigate whether the bias in the estimated factor loadings used for hedging varies over time. In Chapter 4 we use a Bayesian latent factor model to investigate the time variation in the comovements of stocks. In particular, we investigate how the optimal number of latent factors varies over time. We determine this optimal number of factors by comparing the predictive likelihoods for models with different numbers of latent factors. Subsequently, we apply the model in a residual industry momentum strategy. This thesis discusses several aspects and possible improvements of equity momentum strategies in finance. Equity momentum is the phenomenon that stocks that have recently outperformed continue to outperform, while underperformers will continue to underperform. Equity strategies that exploit this phenomenon by buying the recent <b>outperformers</b> and short-selling the recent underperformers have proven to be profitable for investors. In his Nobel prize lecture in 2013 Eugene Fama referred to this performance of the momentum strategy as being the biggest challenge for the efficient market hypothesis. Nevertheless, equity momentum is also known for its crash risk, wiping out years of average positive returns in just a few months, and the fact that its risk and returns vary over time. In this thesis different hedging strategies are applied to reduce momentum’s crash risk and time varying exposures without reducing its positive average returns. Furthermore, different recent improvements of momentum are combined in a mean-variance optimization set-up. Optimization also reduces momentum’s crash risk and its time varying exposures. Moreover it improves momentum’s Sharpe ratio for moderate transaction costs. Finally, this thesis addresses momentum’s time varying risks and returns in a different way. A Bayesian latent factor model where the number of latent factors is allowed to vary over time is derived. Using the predictive likelihood approach this model is then applied to a residual industry momentum strategy. In turbulent times, like the crisis that started in 2008, the Bayesian latent factor model performs well in terms of risk and return characteristics...|$|R
