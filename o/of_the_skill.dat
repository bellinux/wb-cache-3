5|$|The Roman heavy cavalry now {{charged the}} German horsemen. In the ensuing mêlée, Chnodomar's stratagem paid dividends. The {{interspersed}} foot warriors wreaked havoc, {{bringing down the}} horses of the cataphracts and then killing their riders on the ground. Unnerved by these tactics, and by the injury {{of one of their}} tribuni, the cataphracts panicked and fled the field. In their headlong flight, they crashed into the Roman infantry on the right, which, however, was able to maintain formation because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skill</b> of the crack auxilia palatina regiments Cornuti and Brachiati posted there. The cataphracts took refuge behind the infantry lines, where it took the personal intervention of Julian himself to rally them. Zosimus claims that one regiment of cataphracts refused to return to the fight and that after the battle, they were obliged by Julian to wear female clothes as punishment. The performance {{of the rest of the}} cavalry is not described by Ammianus, but they would have been obliged to retreat with the cataphracts, though it is unclear whether they followed them to behind the infantry lines, or, more likely, halted to cover the Roman right wing. It is clear, however, that the German cavalry was unable to capitalise on their success to outflank the Roman right. Nevertheless, Chnodomar had trumped Julian's best card.|$|E

The fatality rate per capita is twice the level of Germany's, or that of the United Kingdom, Sweden or the Netherlands (2010 comparison).

25|$|The {{uniqueness}} of Kiribati {{when compared with}} other forms of Pacific island dance is its emphasis on the outstretched arms of the dancer and the sudden birdlike movement of the head. The Frigate bird (Fregata minor) on the Kiribati flag refers to this bird-like style of Kiribati dancing. Most dances are in the standing or sitting position with movement limited and staggered. Smiling whilst dancing is generally considered vulgar {{within the context of}} Kiribati dancing. This is due to its origin of not being solely as a form of entertainment but as a form of storytelling and a display <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skill,</b> beauty and endurance of the dancer.|$|E

25|$|There {{are some}} {{exceptions}} for very {{high or low}} rolls, deemed criticals. No matter the level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skill,</b> a die roll of 18 is always a critical failure, and a roll of 3 or 4 is always a critical success (a roll of 17 is a critical failure as well, unless the character relevant skill level is 16 or more). The Game Master may decide in such cases that, in first case (a roll of 18, or 10+ over the modified skill level), the character has failed miserably and caused something disastrous to happen or, in the other case, {{that he or she}} succeeds incredibly well and gains some benefit as a result.|$|E
25|$|The human {{target is}} the {{essential}} distinguishing feature of the impalement arts. It has been asserted by several sources, including well-known knife throwers, that the power and appeal {{of this type of}} act lies as much in audience appreciation of the target as in admiration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skill</b> of the thrower or archer. Various theories have been put forward to explain this, ranging from simple awe at the display of steely nerves and complete trust to more complex psychological and philosophical theories. While some point to overtones of sadomasochistic eroticism, others cite dramaturgical works and point to parallels with the story arc of the hero in classic drama. In particular the assistant's performance is said to mirror the plot device of the , in which the hero proves his or her heroic qualities through self-sacrifice or by facing extreme peril.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two kinds}} of attacks: Melee (possibly with hand-to-hand weapons, or unarmed combat) and Ranged (bows, guns, thrown weapons, some Innate Attacks, etc.). Attacks made by a {{character}} are checked against their skill with the particular weapon they carry. For instance, if a character is using a pistol, as with any other skill, it is beneficial to have a high level in the Guns skill. Like any other skill check, a player must roll equal to or less than the level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skill</b> to succeed. Failure means a miss, success scores a hit. Similarly, critical hits mean that the blow might inflict significantly more damage to its target; critical misses may lead to a rather unpleasant and unexpected event (such as dropping the weapon or hitting the wrong target). Attack modifiers are set by the GM when factoring in things like distance, speed and cover that make a successful strike more difficult.|$|E

25|$|Competitive mode enables players, {{segregated}} in both {{region and}} platform, {{to participate in}} ranked play. Competitive mode is run in seasons that last for three months each with a short break (on {{the order of a}} week to two weeks) between each season to allow Blizzard to make necessary changes to this format; an exception was made for the first season which ran for 1.5 months to align timing for future seasons as to fall on calendar seasons. Players must have reached level 25 from casual matches to partake in competitive play. Before they can play any ranked matches for that season, they must play through ten preliminary matches which assigns a skill rating, which is partially influenced by the player's previous skill ranking on the last season. This ranking is subsequently used for matchmaking purposes in future competitive games they play that season. The player's skill level can move up or down during a season, influenced by their performance and by winning matches against higher-ranked players or losing matches to lower-ranked ones. Specific aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skill</b> system over the seasons are described below.|$|E
25|$|The {{assumption}} of new values or the rebellion against accepted notions {{of what is}} aesthetically superior need not occur concurrently with a complete abandonment of the pursuit of what is aesthetically appealing. Indeed, the reverse is often true, that the revision of what is popularly conceived of as being aesthetically appealing allows for a re-invigoration of aesthetic sensibility, and a new appreciation for the standards of art itself. Countless schools have proposed their own ways to define quality, yet {{they all seem to}} agree in at least one point: once their aesthetic choices are accepted, the value of the work of art is determined by its capacity to transcend the limits of its chosen medium to strike some universal chord by the rarity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skill</b> of the artist or in its accurate reflection in what is termed the zeitgeist. Art is often intended to appeal to and connect with human emotion. It can arouse aesthetic or moral feelings, and can be understood as a way of communicating these feelings. Artists express something so that their audience is aroused to some extent, but {{they do not have to}} do so consciously. Art may be considered an exploration of the human condition; that is, what it is to be human.|$|E

500|$|Between 1963 and 1966, Indonesia {{pursued a}} policy of Konfrontasi, or Confrontation, with Malaysia. 3 RAR, which was based at Camp Terendak in Malacca on {{mainland}} Malaysia, was subsequently used with British and New Zealand forces to mop up two small airborne and seaborne landings near Labis and Pontian in September and October 1964. On 13 February 1965, 3 RAR was warned for service in Sarawak {{on the island of}} Borneo, commencing in March. 3 RAR completed a four-month tour mounting numerous security patrols in its area of operations, including a number of sensitive cross-border patrols into the Indonesian regency of Sarawak as a part of Operation Claret, which resulted in actions at Sungei Koemba, Kindau and Babang, between late May and July. Operations on the Sarawak border [...] "were a severe test <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skill,</b> discipline and professionalism of the infantry, involving long periods in the jungle or in the company bases." [...] Out of the 30 Claret operations conducted by 3 RAR, 12 were reconnaissance patrols, while the remainder were ambushes or fighting patrols, four of which resulted in contact with Indonesian forces. 4 RAR, having been reformed as a battalion the previous year, assumed responsibility from 3 RAR at Camp Terendak in October 1965. Deploying forward to Borneo in April 1966, it remained there until September and like its predecessor, conducted a demanding routine of internal security and cross-border patrols.|$|E
