To date, he has appeared in all Phineas and Ferb novelizations, published by Disney Press. Phineas appears in the Nintendo DS video game based on the series, simply titled Phineas and Ferb. Dan Povenmire {{has said that he}} saw nothing of the game until its release, on which he was given a copy for free.|$|E
5|$|HFMA holds two {{paintings}} by German landscape painter Frederick Ferdinand Schafer (1839–1927). Morning in the Adirondacks and Olympic Mountains, Washington were both acquired in 1996 by the museum. <b>Other</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> art include Egyptian art, Korean art, African art, Indian art, and etchings by Dutch artist Anthonie Waterloo. The museum also houses the Paulus Collection of photograph glass negatives of the Salem {{area from the}} early Twentieth Century.|$|E
5|$|St Kilda's {{adventure}} playground covers 4 hectares {{along the}} seafront {{and is one}} of South Australia's best known. The playground has a constructed shipwreck, wooden castle, huge slides, a spiral slide inside a hill, flying foxes and numerous <b>other</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> play equipment, with South Australian children naming it in 2002 as the best adventure park in the state.|$|E

5|$|As {{well as the}} {{chandelier}} earrings, and 60 <b>other</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> jewellery, Mrs Greville left the Queen Mother a set of pear-drop earrings that she had bought from Cartier in 1938. The pear-shaped drop diamonds each weigh about 20carats (4g). Diana, Princess of Wales, borrowed them in 1983 to wear on her first official visit to Australia. At a state banquet, she wore the earrings with a tiara from her family's own collection. The Greville Pear-drop Earrings passed to the Queen upon her mother's death in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} rover and its {{bridging}} kits, Jetman {{has access to}} three <b>other</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> equipment, {{all of which can}} be carried on the bonnet of the rover, albeit one at a time. Bombs must be used to destroy alien bases when they are encountered, which can only be accomplished when Jetman is flying above them. Another piece of equipment is a cannon that may be mounted onto the rear side of the moon rover. The final piece of equipment is a pair of teleporters which can be used to instantaneously transport the player to the teleporter's twin, thus allowing rapid transport around the moon.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, a {{contract}} {{for the construction of}} a mesophilic anaerobic digestion facility was awarded, including the construction of buildings and various <b>other</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> equipment required for the treatment of sludge. Mesophilic anaerobic digestion enables the breaking down of biodegradable materials using micro-organisms under moderate temperatures. The new sludge treatment facility enables the recycled sludge to be used on neighbouring farmlands as manure, and also enables Yorkshire Water to generate 1.9MW of renewable energy using combined heat and power units.|$|E

5|$|There {{is a large}} statue by Eduardo Paolozzi named Piscator {{dedicated}} to German theatre director Erwin Piscator {{at the front of}} the courtyard, which as of 2016 is reported as deteriorating. <b>Other</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> public art, including low stone benches by Paul de Monchaux around the courtyard, were commissioned by Network Rail in 1990. The station has catering units and shops, a large ticket hall and an enclosed car park with over 200 spaces. The lack of daylight on the platforms compares unfavourably with the glazed trainshed roofs of traditional Victorian railway stations, but the use of the space above as a parcels depot released the maximum space at ground level for platforms and passenger facilities.|$|E
5|$|On {{the table}} are various <b>other</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> {{equipment}} {{that the natural}} philosopher would have used during his demonstration: a thermometer, candle snuffer and cork, {{and close to the}} man seated to the right is a pair of Magdeburg hemispheres, which would have been used with the air pump to demonstrate the difference in pressure exerted by the air and a vacuum: when the air was pumped out from between the two hemispheres they were impossible to pull apart. The air pump itself is rendered in exquisite detail, a faithful record of the designs in use at the time. What may be a human skull in the large liquid-filled glass bowl would not have been a normal piece of equipment; William Schupbach suggests that it and the candle, which is presumably lighting the bowl from behind, form a vanitas—the two symbols of mortality reflecting the cockatoo's struggle for life.|$|E
5|$|The Italian Peninsula was not {{the only}} region from which Napoleon took art. Under the Directory {{government}} of the 1790s, Napoleon (then a General) led an expedition to Egypt. The campaign was an expansionist {{effort on the part of}} the government, but the Directory had another goal to make Paris the center of art, science, and culture. The Directory wanted France to assume responsibility for liberating the works of art they deemed in danger in order to protect and nationalize the heritage and culture of their subjects. As a result, there were teams of artists and scientists who accompanied the armies into battle equipped with lists of paintings, sculptures, and <b>other</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> patrimony that would be collected, crated, and shipped back to France.|$|E
50|$|Also of {{historical}} note {{was that the}} operating system (OSIRIS), applications, development tools, and every <b>other</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> BiiN software was written exclusively in Ada — perhaps the largest non-military use of that programming language.|$|R

5|$|After his death, {{the court}} ruled that Van Meegeren’s estate be {{auctioned}} and the proceeds from his property and the sale of his counterfeits be used to refund the buyers of his works and to pay income taxes on the sale of his paintings. Van Meegeren filed for bankruptcy in December 1945. On 5 and 6 September 1950, the furniture and other possessions in his Amsterdam house at Keizersgracht 321 were auctioned by order of the court, along with 738 <b>other</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> furniture and works of art, including numerous paintings by old and new masters from his private collection. The house was auctioned separately on 4 September, estimated to be worth 65,000 guilders. The proceeds of the sale together with the house amounted to 123,000 guilders. Van Meegeren’s unsigned The Last Supper I was bought for 2,300 guilders, while Jesus among the Doctors (which van Meegeren had painted while in detention) sold for 3,000 guilders (about $800 or about $7,000 today.) Today the painting hangs in a Johannesburg church. The sale of the entire estate amounted to 242,000 guilders ($60,000, or about $500,000 today).|$|E
5|$|In this game, Mario {{is joined}} by a robotic {{backpack}} named FLUDD (Flash Liquidizing Ultra Dousing Device), which uses the power of water to clean away goop and help Mario reach new places. Mario starts with two default nozzles for FLUDD, Squirt and Hover, which he can quickly switch between. The Squirt nozzle lets Mario spray a stream of water which he can use to clean sludge, attack enemies, and activate certain mechanisms. The Hover nozzle lets Mario hover {{in the air for}} a short period of time, allowing him to cross large gaps while simultaneously spraying things directly below him. As the game progresses, Mario unlocks two additional nozzles for FLUDD which can be substituted with the Hover nozzle: the Rocket nozzle, which shoots Mario high up into the air; and the Turbo nozzle, which moves Mario at high speeds, allowing him to run across water and break into certain areas. Each of FLUDD's nozzles use water from its reserves, which can be refilled via water sources such as rivers or fountains. There are also some areas where FLUDD is taken away from Mario, forcing him to rely on his natural platforming abilities. At certain points in the game, Mario may come across an egg which hatches into a Yoshi after being brought a fruit he asks for. Yoshi can be ridden upon and can attack by spitting juice, which can clear certain obstacles that water cannot. Yoshi can also use his tongue to eat enemies or <b>other</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> fruit which change his color, depending on the type of fruit. Yoshi will disappear if he runs out of juice or falls into deep water. Juice can be replenished by eating more fruit.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to {{the main part of}} the sculpture, Jim Sanborn also placed <b>other</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> art at the CIA grounds, such as several large granite slabs with sandwiched copper sheets outside the entrance to the New Headquarters Building. Several morse code messages are found on these copper sheets, and one of the stone slabs has an engraving of a compass rose pointing to a lodestone. Other elements of Sanborn's installation include a landscaped garden area, a fish pond with opposing wooden benches, a reflecting pool, and <b>other</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> stone including a triangle shaped black stone slab.|$|E
