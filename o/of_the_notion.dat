5|$|Fodor {{revived the}} idea of modularity, without the notion of precise {{physical}} localizability, in the 1980s, {{and became one of}} the most vocal proponents of it with the 1983 publication of his monograph Modularity of Mind. Two properties of modularity in particular, informational encapsulation and domain specificity, make it possible to tie together questions of functional architecture with those of mental content. The ability to elaborate information independently from the background beliefs of individuals that these two properties allow Fodor to give an atomistic and causal account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of mental content. The main idea, in other words, is that the properties of the contents of mental states can depend, rather than exclusively on the internal relations of the system of which they are a part, also on their causal relations with the external world.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigated}} {{the historical and}} philosophical context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>notions</b> <b>of</b> “tradition” and <b>the</b> “purpose-task” in <b>the</b> philosophy <b>of</b> Sergius Hessen. <b>The</b> article identified <b>the</b> meaning <b>of</b> values and hierarchy of values of Heinrich Rickert in definition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>notions</b> <b>of</b> “tradition” and “purpose-task” and <b>the</b> main principle <b>of</b> their interaction...|$|R

25|$|In the 1760s {{there was}} a decline of popular demand for the confessional genre that could be {{connected}} to the crisis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of 'Everyman' criminal.|$|E

25|$|A partial metric {{space is}} {{intended}} to be the least generalisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of a metric space, such that the distance of each point from itself is no longer necessarily zero.|$|E
50|$|So generalizing {{marketing}} {{throughout the}} public sector, without deeper analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>notions</b> <b>of</b> exchange and relationship, is not easy.|$|R
30|$|For better display, {{the terms}} for each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>notions</b> will be {{abbreviated}} by capitalizing {{the first three}} letters; <b>the</b> <b>notions</b> Inverted Sequence and Greater Degree will be shortened as “I-S” and “G-D” respectively.|$|R

25|$|The {{language}} of category theory provides a concise definition for Lie groups: a Lie {{group is a}} group object {{in the category of}} smooth manifolds. This is important, because it allows generalization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of a Lie group to Lie supergroups.|$|E
25|$|The origins <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of reincarnation are obscure. Discussion of {{the subject}} appears in the {{philosophical}} traditions of India. The Greek Pre-Socratics discussed reincarnation, and the Celtic Druids are also reported to have taught a doctrine of reincarnation.|$|E
25|$|The work of Sela on first-order {{theory of}} free and word-hyperbolic groups {{substantially}} influenced {{the development of}} geometric group theory, in particular by stimulating the development and the study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of limit groups and of relatively hyperbolic groups.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> abelian {{kernel of}} a finite monoid extends <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> derived {{subgroup}} of a finite group.

In this paper we study these notions for some classes of finite monoids...|$|R
25|$|An earlier example <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of {{computing}} as the utility was in 1965 by MIT's Fernando Corbató. Corbató {{and the other}} designers of the Multics operating system envisioned a computer facility operating “like a power company or water company”.|$|E
25|$|This led in 1828 to an {{important}} theorem, the Theorema Egregium (remarkable theorem), establishing {{an important}} property <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of curvature. Informally, the theorem says that the {{curvature of a surface}} can be determined entirely by measuring angles and distances on the surface.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{equivalent}} definitions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of {{the fundamental}} group of a graph of groups: {{the first is a}} direct algebraic definition via an explicit group presentation (as a certain iterated application of amalgamated free products and HNN extensions), and the second using the language of groupoids.|$|E
30|$|Let the {{function}} F=(F_ 1,F_ 2,...,F_N) : R^n→R^N be differentiable at x^∗. <b>The</b> following generalizations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>notions</b> <b>of</b> invexity, pseudoinvexity, and quasiinvexity for vector-valued functions were originally proposed in [28].|$|R

25|$|It is {{possible}} to derive, from the covariant formulation of full quantum theory (Spinfoam) the correct relation between energy and area (1st law), the Unruh temperature and the distribution that yields Hawking entropy. The calculation makes use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of dynamical horizon and is done for non-extremal black holes.|$|E
25|$|Leopold Kronecker {{was skeptical}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of {{infinity}} {{and how his}} fellow mathematicians were using it in the 1870s and 1880s. This skepticism {{was developed in the}} philosophy of mathematics called finitism, an extreme form of mathematical philosophy in the general philosophical and mathematical schools of constructivism and intuitionism.|$|E
25|$|The utility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of a {{topology}} {{is shown}} {{by the fact that}} there are several equivalent definitions of this structure. Thus one chooses the axiomatisation suited for the application. The most commonly used is that in terms of open sets, but perhaps more intuitive is that in terms of neighbourhoods and so this is given first.|$|E

3000|$|..., we see {{further that}} in <b>the</b> {{perception}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>notions</b> <b>of</b> a real lecturer and an ideal lecturer by <b>the</b> participants <b>of</b> training is somewhat less consensus as in <b>the</b> perception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> considered <b>notions</b> by lecturers. This means that <b>the</b> participants <b>of</b> training evaluated <b>the</b> work <b>of</b> lecturers more critically than the lecturers themselves.

25|$|Harmful {{environmental}} {{issues such as}} ozone depletion, acidification, eutrophication and climate change came to the public's attention in the same period, and caused the onset of environmental science and environmental technology. In a 1967 article, Lynn Townsend White Jr. blamed the ecological crisis on the historical decline <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of spirit in nature.|$|E
25|$|PDIFF {{is mostly}} a {{technical}} point: smooth maps are not piecewise linear (unless linear), and piecewise linear maps are not smooth (unless globally linear) – the intersection is linear maps, or more precisely affine maps (because not based) – so they cannot directly be related: they are separate generalizations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of an affine map.|$|E
