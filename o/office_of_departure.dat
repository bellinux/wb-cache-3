The main task of those in power is to transform the lives of all South Africans and this could be achieved by improving service delivery.

The present paper proposes a measure to represent the degree <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> from marginal pointsymmetry for two-way tables.

50|$|In {{order for}} a {{projectile}} to impact any distant target, the barrel must be inclined to a positive elevation angle relative to the target. This {{is due to the}} fact that the projectile will begin to respond to the effects of gravity the instant it is free from the mechanical constraints of the bore. The imaginary line down the center axis of the bore and out to infinity is called the line <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> and is the line on which the projectile leaves the barrel. Due to the effects of gravity a projectile can never impact a target higher than the line <b>of</b> <b>departure.</b> When a positively inclined projectile travels downrange, it arcs below the line <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> as it is being deflected off its initial path by gravity. Projectile/Bullet drop is defined as the vertical distance of the projectile below the line <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> from the bore. Even when the line <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> is tilted upward or downward, projectile drop is still defined as the distance between the bullet and the line <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> at any point along the trajectory. Projectile drop does not describe the actual trajectory of the projectile.Knowledge of projectile drop however is useful when conducting a direct comparison of two different projectiles regarding the shape of their trajectories, comparing the effects of variables such as velocity and drag behavior.|$|R
