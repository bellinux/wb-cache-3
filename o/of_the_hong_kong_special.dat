500|$|The Regional Flag <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> <b>Special</b> Administrative Region {{features}} a stylized, white, five-petal Bauhinia blakeana flower {{in the center}} of a red field. On each petal is a red star; the stars demonstrate that Hong Kong residents love their motherland while the overall flag design signifies the link re-established between post-colonial Hong Kong and China while demonstrating the [...] "One country, two systems" [...] political principle applied to the region. The flag of Hong Kong was adopted on 16 February 1990. On 10 August 1996, it received formal approval from the Preparatory Committee, a group which advised the People's Republic of China (PRC) on Hong Kong's transfer of sovereignty from the United Kingdom to the PRC in 1997. The flag was first officially hoisted on 1 July 1997, in the handover ceremony marking the transfer of sovereignty from the United Kingdom to China.|$|E
500|$|Under the Immigration Ordinance a {{foreigner}} may {{be eligible to}} apply for permanent residency after having [...] "ordinarily resided" [...] in Hong Kong for seven continuous years, and thus enjoy the right of abode in Hong Kong. However, the definition of [...] "ordinary residency" [...] excludes (amongst other groups) those {{who lived in the}} territory as foreign domestic helpers; this effectively denied foreign workers the rights of permanent residents (including the right to vote), even if they had lived in Hong Kong for many years. Since 1997, section 2(4) of the Immigration Ordinance has stated that [...] "a person shall not be treated as ordinarily resident in Hong Kong while employed as a domestic helper who is from outside Hong Kong". In 2011, the issue of foreign workers applying for Hong Kong residency was debated; since one million families live under the poverty line in the territory, some political parties argued that Hong Kong has insufficient welfare funding to support 300,000 foreign workers if they can apply for public housing and social-welfare benefits. The Court of First Instance found in Vallejos v Commissioner of Registration that this definition of [...] "ordinarily resident" [...] contravenes Article 24 of the Basic Law. The latter stipulates, [...] "Persons not of Chinese nationality who have entered Hong Kong with valid travel documents, have ordinarily resided in Hong Kong for a continuous period of not less than seven years and have taken Hong Kong as their place of permanent residence before or after the establishment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> <b>Special</b> Administrative Region", feeding speculation that domestic helpers could obtain the right of abode. An appeal was made to the Court of Appeal of the High Court, which overturned the judgment of the Court of First Instance. The plaintiffs then appealed to the Court of Final Appeal, which ruled against them in a unanimous judgment.|$|E
