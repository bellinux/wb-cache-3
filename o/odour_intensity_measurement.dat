However, obtaining downwind odour samples that are representative to what is actually “felt ” by those {{in the field is}} almost impractical. The goal {{of this study was to}} evaluate a potentially more satisfactory method of evaluating odour directly in the field. This method was developed by St. Croix Sensory Inc.

Regarding olfaction, the coding of odour quality is often proposed to be combinatorial along the olfactory pathway, and working hypotheses are available concerning short-term associative memory trace formation of odour quality. However, it is less clear how <b>odour</b> <b>intensity</b> is coded, and whether olfactory memory traces include information about the intensity of the learnt odour. Using odour-sugar associative conditioning in larval Drosophila, we first describe the dose-effect curves of learnability across <b>odour</b> <b>intensities</b> for four different odours (n-amyl acetate, 3 -octanol, 1 -octen- 3 -ol and benzaldehyde). We then chose <b>odour</b> <b>intensities</b> such that larvae were trained at an intermediate <b>odour</b> <b>intensity,</b> but were tested for retention with either that trained intermediate <b>odour</b> <b>intensity,</b> or with respectively higher or lower intensities. We observed a specificity of retention for the trained intensity for all four odours used. This adds to the appreciation of the richness in 'content' of olfactory short-term memory traces, even in a system as simple as larval Drosophila, and to define the demands on computational models of associative olfactory memory trace formation.

40|$|Continuous odour {{measurements}} both {{of emissions}} {{as well as}} ambient concentrations are seldom realised, mainly because of their high costs. They are therefore often substituted by concentration measurements of odorous substances. Then a conversion of the chemical concentrations C (mg m- 3) into odour concentrations COD (ouE m- 3) and <b>odour</b> <b>intensities</b> OI is necessary. Four methods to convert the concentrations of single substances to the odour concentrations and <b>odour</b> <b>intensities</b> of an odorous mixture are investigated: (1) direct use of measured concentrations, (2) {{the sum of the}} odour activity value SOAV, (3) the sum of the <b>odour</b> <b>intensities</b> SOI, and (4) the equivalent odour concentration EOC, as a new method. The methods are evaluated with olfactometric measurements of seven substances as well as their mixtures. The results indicate that the SOI and EOC conversion methods deliver reliable values. These methods use not only the odour threshold concentration but also the slope of the Weber-Fechner law to include the sensitivity of the odour perception of the individual substances. They fulfil the criteria of an objective conversion without the need of a further calibration by additional olfactometric measurements.

An experiment was conducted with finishing pigs (n = 36) in a 2 × 3 factorial randomized complete block arrangement with 6 treatment combinations in 6 blocks. There were 2 dietary CP levels (low 12 %; high 18 %) and 3 digestible FC levels: (low 95. 5; medium 145. 5; and high 195. 5 g/kg feed, as-fed basis). Pigs with an initial body weight (BW) of 57. 7 ± 2. 5 kg were penned individually in partly slatted floor pens. Faeces and urine of each pig accumulated in separate manure pits under the slatted floor. In the 6 th week of the collection period air samples were collected directly above the manure in each pit. Manure samples were taken for manure characteristics. Air samples were analyzed for odour concentration and for hedonic tone and <b>odour</b> <b>intensity.</b> Manure samples were analyzed for volatile fatty acids (VFA), indoles, phenoles, sulphurous compounds, ammonium, and total N concentrations. Dietary CP level and FC level did not affect <b>odour</b> emission, <b>odour</b> <b>intensity</b> and hedonic tone but their interaction affected odour emission at P = 0. 06. At a high dietary CP level, increased FC level decreased odour emission, while at a low CP level, increased FC level increased odour emission from pig manure. Total N and ammonium concentrations, and ammonia emission from pig manure were reduced at low dietary CP level (P 0. 05) in the manure. We conclude that the interaction between dietary CP and FC plays a role in odour production and emission. Ammonia emission from pig manure can be reduced substantially by decreasing dietary CP and by increasing FC...|$|R

40|$|The {{fact that}} most types of sensory stimuli occur {{naturally}} over a large range of intensities {{is a challenge to}} early sensory processing.

We argue that this could be a natural consequence of odour coding and suggest how an ‘intensity feature’ might be useful to the honeybee in natural odour detection and discrimination...|$|R

40|$|Assessment of {{the impact}} of odours {{released}} from sewage pumpstations requires the consideration of a number of factors. These include the determination of the odour emission rate or source strength of the pumpstation, the dispersion of odorous air from the station and the response of the human nose to sewage odour. By using the dilution-to-threshold concept, the odour concentration of ambient air can be quantified in terms of standard odour units per unit volume. Taking into account the rate of odorous air emitted from a sewage pumpstation, the odour source strength of the station can be conveniently expressed in terms of standard odour units per unit time. Field measurements were carried out at ten sewage pumpstations and the results of these investigations indicate that odour emission rates tend to increase with the 1. 3 power of the sewage flowrate. Thus, the potential odorousness of a sewage pumpstation is dramatically increased with increasing flowrates. However, because the magnitude of observed change in <b>odour</b> <b>intensity</b> by the human nose is logarithmically related to the magnitude of the odour concentration, perceived <b>odour</b> <b>intensities</b> in the neighbourhood of pumpstations that receive increased flowrates, increase less dramatically...|$|R

An experiment was conducted with finishing pigs (n = 12) in a randomized complete block arrangement with 2 treatments of 12 and 15 % dietary CP in six blocks. The 2 diets were supplemented with essential AA up to the level of the animal's requirement. Pigs with an initial body weight (BW) of 57. 7 ± 0. 7 kg were penned individually in partly slatted floor pens. Faeces and urine of each pig accumulated in separate manure pits under the slatted floor. In the 3 rd week of the collection period, fresh faeces were collected for identifying fresh faeces characteristics and for assessing dry matter, organic matter, nitrogen (N), fat and non-starch polysaccharides digestibility using Cr 2 O 3 as a marker. In the 6 th week of the collection period, air samples were collected directly from each manure pit: one for odour, one for ammonia concentration and one for greenhouse gases. Afterwards the manure was mixed and a representative sample was taken for manure characteristic analysis. Odour samples were analyzed for odour concentration and for hedonic tone and <b>odour</b> <b>intensity.</b> Manure samples were analyzed for volatile fatty acids (VFA), indolic, phenolic, sulphurous compounds, ammonium and total N concentrations and pH. Reducing dietary CP level from 15 to 12 % did not affect <b>odour</b> emission, <b>odour</b> <b>intensity</b> and <b>odour</b> hedonic tone and greenhouse gaseous concentration (CH 4, CO 2 and N 2 O) (P > 0. 05) of odorous air above the manure pit.

This study investigated the effectiveness of saltiness enhancement by an odour to maintain the perception of saltiness in reduced salt content solutions. In the first experiment, we tested the hypothesis that <b>odour</b> <b>intensity</b> drives the level of saltiness enhancement. The results showed that odour can increase the salty intensity by 25 %, while no clear influence of <b>odour</b> <b>intensity</b> either in tasteless solutions or in low-salt content solutions. In a second experiment, we examined whether odour could enhance saltiness in salty solutions containing potassium chloride alone or mixed with sodium chloride and in salty-sour solutions. The results showed that a higher Odour-Induced Saltiness Enhancement occurred when the salty taste relied on potassium chloride as compared to sodium chloride. However, the highest enhancement was observed in the ternary odour-sour-salty solution.

The aims of the present study were to determine the role of sulphur-containing gases in flatus odour and test the efficacy of a device purported to reduce this odour.  Methods—Flatus was quantitatively collected via rectal tube from 16 healthy subjects who ingested pinto beans and lactulose to enhance flatus output. The concentrations of sulphur-containing gases in each passage were correlated with <b>odour</b> <b>intensity</b> assessed by two judges. <b>Odour</b> <b>intensity</b> was also determined after treatment of flatus samples with zinc acetate, which binds sulphydryl compounds (hydrogen sulphide and methanethiol), or activated charcoal. Utilising gas-tight Mylar pantaloons, the ability of a charcoal lined cushion to adsorb sulphur-containing gases instilled at the anus of eight subjects was assessed.  Results—The main sulphur-containing flatus component was hydrogen sulphide (1. 06 (0. 2) µmol/l), followed by methanethiol (0. 21 (0. 04) µmol/l) and dimethyl sulphide (0. 08 (0. 01) µmol/l) (means (SEM)). Malodour significantly correlated with hydrogen sulphide concentration (p⩽ 0. 001). Zinc acetate reduced sulphur gas content but did not totally eliminate odour, while activated charcoal removed virtually all odour. The cushion adsorbed more than 90 % of the sulphur gases.  Conclusion—Sulphur-containing gases are the major, but not the only, malodorous components of human flatus. The charcoal lined cushion effectively limits the escape of these sulphur-containing gases into the environment. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{compares the}} effects of four {{different}} smoking processes on the sensorial and physicochemical characteristics of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) fillets. Two commercial liquid smoke flavourings (FA and FB) and two types of wood used for cold-smoking wood smoke generation (BS: Beech wood and OS: Oak wood) are investigated. Comparisons were made over a 45 day storage period. Control salmon samples (Cn) (i. e., samples that underwent no smoke treatment of any kind) were characterised by their low colour intensity, firmness, fat release and fibrousness and high adhesiveness, pH, TBARS and TMA values, and a strong amine odour. Fillets treated with smoke flavouring FA showed characteristics {{very similar to those}} of the Cn samples, however their colour and smoke odour are more intense and their adhesiveness, amine odour and TMA values lower. Fish treated with smoke flavouring FB show low brightness and pH, but high firmness, elasticity, colour intensity and a high expressible water content. Salmon samples smoked with BS or OS smoke had a low <b>intensity</b> amine <b>odour</b> as well as low brightness, pH, TBARS and TMA values, high colour and smoke <b>odour</b> <b>intensities,</b> and a high fat release value. The effect of storage time on sensorial and physicochemical parameters was evident: the values recorded for certain characteristics decrease, such as, colour intensity, elasticity or firmness, and others increase, such as, amine odour, expressible water content or TMA, and some showing a linear relationship with time (elasticity or amine <b>odour</b> <b>intensity)</b> ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} called: "Monitoring of sensory quality of {{selected}} comodities" was to conduct sensory evaluation of ready meals, pâtés and fish muscle. There were samples of ready meals (3) and pâtés (15) whose sensoric properties were evaluated based on a way of storage during their shelf life. The evaluation was focused on appearance/appearance of the cut, <b>odour,</b> <b>intensity</b> of aroma, texture in mouth, flavour, flavour intensity, saltiness/sweetness {{and the presence of}} other flavours. The effect of storage on sensory quality of ready meals and pates was not proven in most cases (P > 0, 05). The effect of fish feed (from companies Aller and Biomar) on sensory properties of heat-treated fish muscle (24 samples of brook charr and 16 samples of rainbow trout) was evaluated as well. Following properties were assessed: <b>odour</b> pleasantness, <b>intensity</b> of aroma, texture in the mouth, juiciness, flavour pleasantness and intensity of flavour. Significant effect feed on the sensory quality of fish was detected only for samples of brook charr (P < 0, 05) ...|$|R
