40|$|Abstract: Recently {{a number}} of {{evolutionary}} multiobjective optimization (EMO) algorithms have been proposed to find a variety of well-distributed Pareto-optimal or near Pareto-optimal solutions {{with a wide range}} <b>of</b> <b>objective</b> values. We focus on the handling <b>of</b> <b>overlapping</b> <b>objective</b> vectors in the objective space. First we show that there exist a large number <b>of</b> <b>overlapping</b> <b>objective</b> vectors in each population when EMO algorithms are applied to multiobjective combinatorial optimization problems with only a few objectives. We discuss the number <b>of</b> <b>overlapping</b> <b>objective</b> vectors from a viewpoint of the diversity-convergence balance in the objective space. Next we implement two strategies to handle overlapping objective vectors. One strategy is the removal <b>of</b> <b>overlapping</b> <b>objective</b> vectors (i. e., overlapping solutions in the objective space). In this strategy, overlapping objective vectors are removed during the generation update phase except for only a single solution among them. As a result, each solution in the next population has a different location in the objective space. The other strategy is the removal <b>of</b> <b>overlapping</b> decision vectors (i. e., overlapping solutions in the decision space) so that each solution in the next population has a different location in the decision space. In this strategy, the next population may include overlapping objective vectors because different solutions in the decision space are not necessarily different in the objective space. Finally we examine the effect of each strategy on the performance of EMO algorithms through computational experiments on multiobjective 0 / 1 knapsack problems...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown feedstreams inside stirred tank {{reactors}} to oscillate. When multiple feed points are used, these oscillations can cause feedstreams to <b>overlap.</b> The <b>objective</b> <b>of</b> {{this study is to}} determine a description of the oscillations {{that can be used to}} prevent the feedstreams to overlap. The oscillations are analyzed by determining the displacements of the centers of the mass of a feedstream in radial cross sections. The growth of the root-mean-square radius of these displacements with time is linear, corresponding to the initial growth stage. The growth rate of the root-mean-square radius with time proved to equal the velocity fluctuations related to turbulent motions with a size larger than the diameter of the feedstream, indicating that these large-scale turbulent motions are responsible for large-scale oscillations. With the description obtained for the root-mean-square radius, the minimal distance between two feed pipes necessary to prevent the <b>overlap</b> <b>of</b> the feedstreams can be calculated...|$|R
40|$|Modeling neuropsychiatric {{disorders}} in animals poses a significant challenge {{due to the}} subjective nature <b>of</b> diverse often <b>overlapping</b> symptoms, lack <b>of</b> <b>objective</b> biomarkers and diagnostics, and the rudimentary understanding of the pathophysiology.

Here, we review behavioral and neurobiological findings from selected animal models, based on presumed etiology and risk factors, for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder. We focus {{on the use of}} appropriate statistical tools and newly developed Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) to link biomarkers from animal models with the human disease. We argue that this approach will lead to development of only the most robust animal models for specific psychiatric disorders and may ultimately lead to better understanding of the pathophysiology and identification of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets...|$|R
40|$|Background: A {{wide variety}} of {{cognitive}} concepts {{have been shown to}} play an important role in chronic widespread pain (CWP). Although these concepts are generally considered to be distinct entities, some might in fact be highly <b>overlapping.</b> The <b>objectives</b> <b>of</b> this study were to (i) to establish inter-relationships between self-efficacy, cognitive coping styles, fear-avoidance cognitions and illness beliefs in patients with CWP and (ii) to explore the possibility of a reduction of these cognitions into a more limited number of domains. Methods. Baseline measurement data of a prospective cohort study of 138 patients with CWP were used. Factor analysis was used to study the associations between 16 different cognitive concepts. Results: Factor analysis resulted in three factors: 1) negative emotional cognitions, 2) active cognitive coping, and 3) control beliefs and expectations of chronicity. Conclusion: Negative emotional cognitions, active cognitive coping, control beliefs and expectations of chronicity seem to constitute principal domains of cognitive processes in CWP.

40|$|Identification of {{variable}} interaction {{is essential for}} an efficient implementation of a divide-and-conquer algorithm for large-scale black-box optimization. In this paper, we propose an improved variant of the differential grouping (DG) algorithm, which has a better efficiency and grouping accuracy. The proposed algorithm, DG 2, finds a reliable threshold value by estimating the magnitude of roundoff errors. With respect to efficiency, DG 2 reuses the sample points that are generated for detecting interactions and saves {{up to half of}} the computational resources on fully separable functions. We mathematically show that the new sampling technique achieves the lower bound with respect to the number of function evaluations. Unlike its predecessor, DG 2 checks all possible pairs {{of variable}}s for interactions and has the capacity to identify <b>overlapping</b> components <b>of</b> an <b>objective</b> function. On the accuracy aspect, DG 2 outperforms the state-of-the-art decomposition methods on the latest large-scale continuous optimization benchmark suites. DG 2 also performs reliably in the presence of imbalance among contribution of components in an objective function. Another major advantage of DG 2 is the automatic calculation of its threshold parameter (ϵ), which makes it parameter-free. Finally, the experimental results show that when DG 2 is used within a cooperative co-evolutionary framework, it can generate competitive results as compared to several state-of-the-art algorithms...|$|R

40|$|Objective　To {{study the}} <b>overlapping</b> <b>of</b> {{involved}} organs in functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) {{occurring in the}} Chinese naval servicemen, {{and to provide a}} sound basis for its diagnosis and treatment. Methods　From November 2006 to April 2007, a questionnaire survey was conducted in 8600 officers and soldiers of Chinese naval force in three regions using randomized, stratified, multistage sampling method. All respondents completed the Rome Ⅲ Modular Questionnaire. The collected data were double input by EpiData 3. 02 software and analyzed by SPSS 13. 0 software. Results　 7454 valid questionnaires were retrieved. The incidence <b>of</b> <b>overlapping</b> was 46. 7 % involving two to five sites. In two-site <b>overlap</b> <b>of</b> FGIDs, the incidence <b>of</b> <b>overlap</b> functional gastroduodenal disorder (FGD) and functional bowel disorder (FBD) was shown to be highest (51. 2 %, 339 / 662), followed by the <b>overlap</b> <b>of</b> functional esophageal disorder (FED) and FBD (15. 4 %, 102 / 662). In three-site <b>overlap</b> <b>of</b> FGIDs, the <b>overlapping</b> rate <b>of</b> FED, FGD and FBD was the highest (44. 4 %, 151 / 340), followed by that of FGD, FBD and functional abdominal pain syndrome (FAPS) (20. 3 %, 69 / 340). The commonest four-site <b>overlap</b> <b>of</b> FGIDs included FED, FGD, FBD and FAPS (57. 7 %, 94 / 163). The five-site <b>overlap</b> <b>of</b> FGIDs was the combination of FED, FGD, FBD, FAPS and functional anorectal disorder (FAD). The incidence of FGIDs in southern military region was 49. 8 % (987 / 1983), which was higher than that of northern (31. 8 %, 1064 / 3351) and eastern (23. 8 %, 533 / 2240) regions. The incidence of FGIDs of single organ was 44. 9 % in southern military region, which was lower than 59. 0 % in eastern and 58. 4 % in northern region. The incidence of the illness involving two to five sites were higher in southern military region as compared with that of eastern and northern regions. Conclusions　The rate <b>of</b> <b>overlapping</b> <b>of</b> FGIDs at different sites is common in the Chinese naval servicemen. There is a difference in rate <b>of</b> <b>overlapping</b> between different military areas. More attention should be paid to the prevention and treatment <b>of</b> <b>overlapping</b> organs in FGIDs in the Chinese naval servicemen...|$|R
