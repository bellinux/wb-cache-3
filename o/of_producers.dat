40|$|This paper {{examines}} the impacts <b>of</b> <b>producer</b> concentration on Thai manufacturing productivity. The key hypothesis highlights {{the role of}} trade policy regime in conditioning the impact <b>of</b> <b>producer</b> concentration. Inter-plant cross-sectional econometric analysis is undertaken, using 1996 industrial census, the only census available so far. The key finding suggests the impact <b>of</b> <b>producer</b> concentration on plant productivity is not consistent and depends {{on the nature of}} trade policy regime. Tariff reduction must reach a certain level before the potential positive impact <b>of</b> <b>producer</b> concentration on productivity is observed. These results further highlight the relative importance of the trade policy regime for productivity enhancement and thus development policy. Although high levels <b>of</b> <b>producer</b> concentration can result in productivity gains, the competition fostered by open trade policies is required in high concentration is to be translated into higher productivity...|$|R
40|$|Within {{the context}} of a product variety model, this paper {{examines}} the impact of international outsourcing of some skill intensive tasks on wage inequality. We consider four possibilities: long-run equilibrium where varieties <b>of</b> <b>producer</b> services are non-traded, long-run equilibrium where varieties <b>of</b> <b>producer</b> services are traded, short-run equilibrium where varieties <b>of</b> <b>producer</b> services are non-traded and short-run equilibrium where varieties <b>of</b> <b>producer</b> services are traded. It is shown that in each case, under certain conditions, international outsourcing can increase skilled-unskilled wage inequality. In the first three cases, outsourcing affects wage inequality directly as well as indirectly. In the short-run equilibrium, where varieties <b>of</b> <b>producer</b> services are traded, international outsourcing increases skilled-unskilled wage inequality only through an indirect channel. In the short-run equilibrium, where all goods are traded, the impact of outsourcing on wage inequality depends solely on the relative size of the income share of capital. Furthermore, in the long-run equilibrium, outsourcing increases the productivity of the industrial sector...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} the authors examine the {{subcontracting}} behaviour <b>of</b> <b>producer</b> service firms in a peripheral metropolitan city. The {{objective of this}} empirical investigation is to uncover spatial and organizational linkages <b>of</b> <b>producer</b> services that have developed in response {{to changes in the}} industrial organization of a modern capitalist production system. The focus is on three types of linkages, namely subcontracting, inputs <b>of</b> <b>producer</b> services, and inputs of goods and final services. The data collected through a survey <b>of</b> <b>producer</b> services in Edmonton reveal that subcontracting rather than internalization is the main mode of production. Therefore the producer service sector can play an important role as a supplier of indigenous higher-order services and innovations, inducing better productivity rates in other industrial sectors including resource-oriented local producers. ...|$|R

40|$|Summary. The US's exports <b>of</b> <b>producer</b> {{services}} increased threefold in the 1980 s.

5|$|The {{pressure}} of the separation and constant press attention began to take its toll of Carey. Growing creative differences with producer Walter Afanasieff ended their working relationship, after collaborating on most of Carey's previous output. The breaking point came after a heated argument during a long recording session, over the album's musical direction. Carey also faced media criticism over her choice <b>of</b> <b>producers</b> and several newspapers linked Carey romantically to several rappers, suggesting these relationships influenced her decisions. However, Carey denied the allegations, stating she had only slept with her husband.|$|E

40|$|Producer gas is a biomass derived {{gaseous fuel}} which is {{extensively}} used in internal combustion engines for power generation application. Unlike the conventional hydrocarbon fuels (Gasoline and Natural gas), the combustion properties <b>of</b> <b>producer</b> gas fuel are much different. Therefore, setting of optimal spark time for efficient engine operation is required. Owing to the fluctuating tendency <b>of</b> <b>producer</b> gas composition during gasification process, the heat release patterns (dictating the power output and emissions) obtained {{are quite different}} from conventional fuels. It was found that, valve lift timing is yet another factor which influences the burn rate <b>of</b> <b>producer</b> gas fuel, and thus, the heat release rate of the engine. Therefore, {{the present study was}} motivated to estimate the influence of valve lift timing analytically (Wiebe model) on the burn rate <b>of</b> <b>producer</b> gas through curve fitting against experimentally obtained mass fraction burn curves <b>of</b> several <b>producer</b> gas compositions.

5|$|Cannibal is {{the debut}} {{extended}} play (EP) by American recording artist Kesha, released on November 19, 2010. The EP is a follow-up companion to her debut album, Animal.

Kesha worked with a variety <b>of</b> <b>producers</b> and writers such as executive producer Dr. Luke, Benny Blanco, Ammo, Max Martin, Bangladesh and others. Musically, the songs on Cannibal are of the dance-pop genre, with some songs incorporating elements of electro and electropop in their production and beats.

Additionally, Emotions features influences {{from a range of}} genres such as gospel, R, soul and 1950s, 1960s and 1970s balladry infusion. On the record, Carey worked with a variety <b>of</b> <b>producers</b> and writers, including Walter Afanasieff, the only hold over from her previous effort.

5|$|Marx's {{theories}} about society, economics and politics—collectively understood as Marxism—hold that human societies develop through class struggle. In capitalism, this {{manifests itself in}} {{the conflict between the}} ruling classes (known as the bourgeoisie) that control the means of production and working classes (known as the proletariat) that enable these means by selling their labour power in return for wages. Employing a critical approach known as historical materialism, Marx predicted that, like previous socioeconomic systems, capitalism produced internal tensions which would lead to its self-destruction and replacement by a new system: socialism. For Marx, class antagonisms under capitalism, owing in part to its instability and crisis-prone nature, would eventuate the working class' development of class consciousness, leading to their conquest of political power and eventually the establishment of a classless, communist society constituted by a free association <b>of</b> <b>producers.</b> Marx actively fought for its implementation, arguing that the working class should carry out organised revolutionary action to topple capitalism and bring about socio-economic emancipation.|$|E
