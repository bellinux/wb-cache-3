60|$|The great {{staples of}} the trade of Lombock {{as well as of}} Bali are rice and coffee; the former grown on the plains, the latter on the hills. The rice is {{exported}} very largely to other islands of the Archipelago, to Singapore, and even to China, and there are generally one or more vessels loading in the port. It is brought into Ampanam on pack-horses, and almost every day a string of these would come into Mr. Carter's yard. The only money the natives will take for their rice is Chinese copper cash, twelve hundred of which go to a dollar. Every morning two large sacks of this money had to be counted out into convenient sums for payment. From Bali quantities of dried beef and <b>ox-tongues</b> are exported, and from Lombock a good many ducks and ponies. The ducks are a peculiar breed, which have very long flat bodies, and walk erect almost like penguins. They are generally of a pale reddish ash colour, and are kept in large flocks. They are very cheap and are largely consumed by the crews of the rice ships, by whom they are called Baly-soldiers, but are more generally known elsewhere as penguin-ducks.|$|R

40|$|Iranian <b>ox-tongue</b> (Red Feather) is an {{important}} medicinal plant with a remedy attribute that has a specific situation in Iranian traditional medicine. In this study, callus induction and indirected regeneration of green plant potential from leaf explants-derived calli were assessed. The usage medium was base MS medium with Gamborge vitamins {{and in order to}} callus induction, various levels of plant growth regulators, 1 -naphthalene acetic acid + 6 -Benzylaminopurine and 2, 4 -Dichlorophenoxy acetic acid and also to plant regeneration, various levels of BAP and Kin in combination with NAA were used. The results showed that the highest percentage of callus induction was obtained from leaf explant in treatment of BAP+NAA, each of them 1. 0 mg/L, whereas the maximum callus fresh weight was belonged to 1. 0 mg/L of 2, 4 -D. the plantlet regeneration assessment also showed that culture medium supplemented containing Kin had the highest amount (= 62. 5 %) of green plant regeneration.

Despite resprouting and a poor first burn, {{two years after}} the 2 nd fire, coyote brush cover on the burned plots was still only about 40 % of the cover on the unburned plots. • Mortality of coyote brush more than doubled following the second burn, likely maintaining a reduction in cover for longer than a single burn would have. • Purple needlegrass {{does not appear to be}} adversely affected by fire at Point Pinole. • Creeping wildrye may benefit from fire; at a minimum, creeping wildrye is not adversely affected by prescribed burning at Point Pinole. • Although data were few for California oatgrass, this study found no evidence of a deleterious burning effect, possibly even a hint of a positive fire effect. • The two burns did not result in increases in fennel, black mustard, or prickly <b>ox-tongue.</b> • Other non-native, annual grasses and forbs showed no lasting, if any, fire effects. • Purple false-brome increased over the course of the study on all plots; it showed no clear fire effect...|$|E
40|$|Commercial {{vineyards}} {{in southern}} Spain were surveyed and sampled during October to December 2004 {{to determine the}} extent to which common weeds present were suitable hosts of root-knot nematodes infesting soils of those vineyards. Seven weed species commonly growing in grapevine soils in southern Spain were found infected by either Meloidogyne incognita or M. javanica: Amaranthus retroflexus (redroot pigweed), Anchusa azurea (<b>ox-tongue),</b> Chenopodium album (goosefoot), Erodium moschatum (musk stork’s bill), Malva rotundifolia (low mallow), Sinapis alba (white mustard), and Solanum nigrum (black nightshade). The host suitability of the weeds to root-knot nematodes was evaluated on the basis of root galling severity and nematode population densities in soil and roots. Also, the host–parasite relationship in these naturally Meloidogyne-infected weeds was examined. All the weed species in the study were considered suitable hosts for M. incognita and M. javanica because: (a) high Meloidogyne spp. populations occurred in roots and surrounding soil of the weed species; (b) the severity of root galling was high, and (c) well-established permanent feeding sites were observed in the histopathological studies of infected root tissues. In addition, this study presents the first reports of S. alba and A. azurea as hosts for M. incognita, and of E. moschatum as a new host for M. javanica, thus increasing the list of reported weed hosts for Meloidogyne spp. These results indicate that noticeable population densities of M. incognita and M. javanica can be maintained or increased in these weeds, at population levels higher than those previously reported for the same nematodes infecting grapevine roots. The weeds infesting vineyards thus represent an important source of inoculum of Meloidogyne spp., and furthermore may act as reservoirs of these nematodes which can be disseminated within or among vineyards by agricultural operations. This research was supported in part by grant P 06 -AGR- 01360 from Consejería de Innovación Ciencia y Empresa (CICE) of Junta de Andalucía. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: In recent years, {{the effect}} of {{exogenous}} organic amendments on soil properties and plant growth characteristics has received renewed attention. Although the utilization of mineral fertilizers {{could be viewed as}} the best solution in terms of plant productivity, this approach is often inefficient in the long-term in tropical ecosystems due to the limited ability of low-activity clay soils to retain nutrients. Intensive use of agrochemicals in agricultural systems is also known to have irreversible effects on soil and water resources. Compost is organic matter that has been decomposed and recycled as a fertilizer and soil amendment. Compost can greatly enhance the physical structure of soil. Decomposing organic amendments slowly release nutrients which may be taken up by plants and thus result in improved agroecosystem productivity. Vermicompost is currently being promoted to improve soil quality, reduces water and fertilizer needs and therefore increases the sustainability of agricultural practices in tropical countries. Vermicomposting is a process which stabilizes organic matter under aerobic and mesophilic conditions through the joint action of earthworms and microorganisms. The products of vermicomposting have been successfully used to suppress plant pests and disease as well as increase crop productivity. Cow manure is an excellent fertilizer containing nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and other nutrients. It also adds organic matter to the soil which may improve soil structure, aeration, soil moisture-holding capacity, and water infiltration. Plant density is the number of individuals of a given plants that occurs within a given sample unit or study area. Planting density can impact the overall health of plants. Plantings that are too sparse (the density is too low) may be more susceptible to weeds, while planting that are too dense might force plants to compete over scarce nutrients and water and cause stunted growth. Despite of many studies on {{the effect of}} organic fertilizers and plant density on different crops, information on the effects of these factors for many medicinal plants is scarce. Therefore, in this study the effect of organic fertilizers and plant density on morphological characteristics and yield of Echium amoenum was studied in a low input cropping system. Materials and methods: In order to evaluate the plant density and comparison of organic and chemical fertilizers on Iranian <b>Ox-Tongue</b> (Echium amoenum), a split plots experiment in time based on RCBD design with three replications was conducted in 2011 - 2014 growing seasons, in Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Iran. The main plots included factorial combination of 3 plant densities (3, 5 and 10 plants per m 2) and 4 different types of organic and chemical fertilizers (compost, vermicompost, cow manure, nitrogen chemical fertilizer and control) and the sub plots included agronomic years (2 and 3 agronomic years). Results and discussion:The results showed that the effect of plant density on dry flower yield was significant, so that the highest dry flower yield (816 kg. ha- 1) obtained for 5 plants per m 2 and in this treatment dry flower yield was 23...|$|E
