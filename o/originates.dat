5|$|Geothermal {{energy is}} heat energy {{generated}} {{and stored in}} the Earth. Thermal energy is the energy that determines the temperature of matter. The geothermal energy of the Earth's crust <b>originates</b> from the original formation of the planet and from radioactive decay of materials (in currently uncertain but possibly roughly equal proportions). The geothermal gradient, which is the difference in temperature between {{the core of the}} planet and its surface, drives a continuous conduction of thermal energy in the form of heat from the core to the surface. The adjective geothermal <b>originates</b> from the Greek roots γη (ge), meaning earth, and θερμος (thermos), meaning hot.|$|E

5|$|The first {{dorsal fin}} {{is large and}} triangular, with a pointed apex and a concave {{trailing}} margin; it <b>originates</b> roughly over the posterior insertions of the pectoral fins. The second dorsal fin {{is less than a}} third as high as the first, and <b>originates</b> ahead of the anal fin. There is no midline ridge between the dorsal fins. The long pectoral fins are broad and slightly falcate (sickle-shaped), becoming narrow and pointed at the tips. The anal fin has a sharply notched trailing margin. The caudal peduncle has a deep notch on its upper surface at the caudal fin origin. The caudal fin is asymmetrical, with a well-developed lower lobe and a longer upper lobe with a notch in the trailing margin near its tip.|$|E
5|$|The first {{dorsal fin}} is {{slightly}} smaller and shorter-based than the second, and neither has spines. The first dorsal fin <b>originates</b> behind the free rear {{tip of the}} pectoral fins, while the second <b>originates</b> above {{the middle of the}} pelvic fin bases. The pectoral fins are short and rounded. The caudal fin has a prominent upper lobe with a well-developed notch near the tip, and a barely present lower lobe. The form and arrangement of the fins is similar to the Portuguese dogfish (Centroscymnus coelolepis), from which this species can be distinguished by the lack of fin spines. The dermal denticles are small and flat, with a single horizontal ridge ending in a point.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{the rolling}} bearing, the flaking caused by rolling contact fatigue is {{classified}} into two types: surface <b>originated</b> flaking and subsurface <b>originated</b> flaking. It {{has been recognized}} that marked microstructural change can occur in subsurface <b>originated</b> flaking due to rolling contact fatigue. But there are few reports in surface <b>originated</b> flaking about microstructural change. In this study, surface <b>originated</b> flaking caused by rolling contact fatigue was investigated based on microstructural change. Thrust ball bearing and radial ball bearing was used for fatigue test. Simulation of dent <b>originated</b> flaking was carried out using the bearing with artificial dent. Another fatigue test subjected to surface <b>originated</b> flaking was done under shortage of oil film thickness lubrication condition. Microstructural change was measured by X-ray Diffractmetry (XRD) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) during fatigue testing. Microstructure of bearing steel used for fatigue test is consisted of martensite with small amount of retained austenite. XRD measurement reveals that the half peak width of martensite and volume fraction of retained austenite decreasing with increasing testing time, {{and the amount of}} decrease in these parameter were small in the surface <b>originated</b> flaking compared with subsurface <b>originated</b> flaking when the specimens were flaking. This suggests that surface <b>originated</b> flaking occurs in spite of mild microstructural change. TEM observation about the surface <b>originated</b> flaking shows plastic flow in the surface layer. Especially, it was confirmed that partial recrystallization occurs in the fatigue test under shortage of oil film thickness lubrication condition. But it was also confirmed that degree of recrystallization is lower in the surface <b>originated</b> flaking than subsurface one, and this reasonably explains XRD result. From these results, it was cleared that recrystallizaiton of martensite is differ in degree but not in kind between surface <b>originated</b> flaking and subsurface <b>originated</b> flaking...|$|R
