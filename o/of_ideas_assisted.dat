50|$|Significant {{controversy}} has developed around the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>assisted</b> colonization {{since it was}} first put forth in the scientific literature in 2007.

Detractors generally believe that other conservation techniques which {{do not include the}} high risk of invasive species are not only better suited but {{are also more likely to}} succeed. This debate continues throughout the literature generally due to a lack of real-world applications and follow-ups.

40|$|ABSTRACT In this paper, {{we argue}} {{that the role of}} the Dutch State has been (a) {{significant}} in the spread of management knowledge in the Dutch management community but (b) changed dramatically during the nineteen eighties. After the World War II, the Dutch government {{played an important role in}} the development of an institutionalized network to spread management knowledge through the management community. The government stimulated the introduction <b>of</b> new <b>ideas</b> by <b>assisting</b> in the development of different new institutions. In the nineteen eighties, however, the position of the government changed dramatically. Its role as distributor of knowledge disappeared almost completely and was taken over by consulting agencies, commercial publisher, and conference organizers. Besides the decreasing role as distributor, the government also changed its own interest. More and more, government agencies started to use management knowledge themselves and turned into one of the largest users in the Netherlands. ...|$|R

As {{the population of}} language minority families significantly increases in our nation (National Center for Educational Statistics, 2002), schools are trying {{to meet the needs}} of a growing number of students with limited English skills. This qualitative research study examined the types of academic, social, and linguistic support currently available to immigrant school-aged children and their families as they enter into a small mid-western community in the United States. The forty-nine participants in this study included immigrant parents, school staff, and community members, who shared insight into the types of support most needed and helpful for newcomer students and their families. Using grounded theory methods of research, three major themes emerged and were used to create a model for support. Each of the three levels of support includes a précis <b>of</b> <b>ideas</b> for <b>assisting</b> schools, communities and families, as they develop ways to support newcomer students in their academic, linguistic, and socio-cultural development. Major findings of this study include: a.) the need for increased communication and access to services, b.) the need for more opportunities to learn English, and c.) the importance of maintaining native language skills and culture as an asset to the community...|$|R

Four investigators systematically examined fifty designs from the teenagers using six different lenses – two concerned with the purpose of the designed technology (hydration and re-use), two with its desirability (aesthetics and cool) and two with the product concept (business and innovation). The investigators used these lenses to focus their examination. Each proposed a candidate solution based on what they had seen from the teen designs. The resulting concepts are examined against the teenagers’ ideas that inspired them with attention being paid to when, and how often, ideas were put in mind. This analysis revealed three different idea types, core, add-ons and novel, each of which needed different treatment to bring it to fruition...|$|R

The <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the Digital Heritage project is to use Virtual Reality Technology for recreating {{cultural}} heritage in a new way that includes modeling Virtual Guide and all information of cultural heritage as a learning environment. The visitor is a learner and the visit is a learning process where a variety of factors influence visitor's virtual environment experience.

The new <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>assisting</b> the user by providing him the appropriate context dependent information and using his feedback to refine and improve the environment are the main topic of this thesis. The first part of this work, gives an introduction from psychological point of view by examining the user in the role of the visitor.

The concept of this thesis describes the new virtual environment and <b>idea</b> to <b>assist</b> the user in his learning process through encouraging curiosity and active participation. The associations to the real-world analogies are helping the user to understand the knowledge as whole and not only its isolated parts. As a result, the new virtual environment is implemented with the Peranakan culture as content of the virtual environment...|$|R
40|$|As {{technology}} advances, systems involving artificial components {{provide more}} and more support for people. The potential consequences of this phenomena are examined in the specific circumstances of `ambient assisted living' as an instantiation {{of the concept of}} `intelligent environment'. This chapter describes the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> `ambient <b>assisted</b> living' and looks at some of the possible ways humans may be affected by the prevalence of technology. The general example of assisted healthcare, and the specific example of medication support are used to show that systems are advancing. Moreover, these advancements can lead to problems with both the artificial systems, and the larger systems with which they are involved. In many cases there is a trade-off around having people in the loop, but inevitably they will need to be included for many decision making processes. The chapter concludes with reflections on how these considerations can help us to retain the positive aspects whilst avoiding the negative side effects of the hypothetical technological singularity...|$|R

This paper presents one method that allows a person to balance the weight of his or her arm against gravity and thus allows for a wide range of vertical movements. Careful design of an orthosis based on the mechanism discussed allows the orthosis to be externally powered should residual muscle forces be insufficient to perform the tasks required by the user.

40|$|A {{histogram}} assisted {{adjustment of}} fitness distribution in standard genetic algorithm is introduced and tested on four benchmark functions of complex landscapes, with remarkable improvement in performance, {{such as the}} substantial enhancement in the probability of detecting local minima. Numerical tests suggest that the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> histogram <b>assisted</b> adjustment, or the "renormalization" of the fitness distribution, is generally advantageous for multi-modal function optimization. An analysis {{on the effect of}} the bin number of the histogram has also been carried out, showing that the performance of the algorithm is insensitive to this extra parameter {{as long as it is}} an order of magnitude smaller than the size of the population (N) in the genetic algorithm. This analysis suggests that the advantage of the introduction of histogram assisted fitness adjustment is a robust feature for genetic algorithm, since the adjustment of fitness enhances exploration by broadening the diversity of the population of chromosomes. In general, the advantage of this histogram assisted adjustment more than compensates the cost of computation resource in the construction of the histogram with O(N) time complexity. Suggestions of using this technique for the mapping of complex landscape are discussed. Copyright 2010 ACM...|$|R
