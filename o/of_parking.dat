40|$|The {{personal}} and community-wide benefits <b>of</b> <b>parks</b> are well documented in previous studies. Despite a strong recognition <b>of</b> <b>park</b> {{benefits in the}} literature, there has been limited inquiry focused {{on the relationship between}} visitation and perceptions of the {{personal and}} community-wide benefits <b>of</b> <b>parks.</b> Consequently, this paper revisits the influence of visitation, as well as other key variables, on public perceptions of the benefits <b>of</b> <b>parks.</b> To achieve this objective, a survey was administered to 1584 participants from Australia. Overall, the Australian public was quite positive about the benefits <b>of</b> <b>parks.</b> Results revealed a strong association between visitation, age, gender and public perceptions <b>of</b> <b>park</b> benefits. Residing in an urban or regional location had little effect on perceptions <b>of</b> <b>park</b> benefits. Future research and management attention should be directed towards improving non-visitors 2 ̆ 7, young people 2 ̆ 7 s and males 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of the benefits <b>of</b> <b>parks...</b>|$|R

5|$|Several local {{businesses}} considered contributing {{money to the}} mountain's purchase. Such funding would be considered surplus, {{and would not be}} subject to referendum. Owners of businesses on Main Street expressed concern at the June1 town board meeting that the cost <b>of</b> <b>parking</b> would increase if the property was purchased by a third party. One board member estimated that without paying rent, the town would recoup the cost of the property within 12 years. Ulster County Area Transit expressed a desire to route its buses through the property, creating a connection to the Mohonk Preserve. A nonprofit organization, the Joppenbergh Mountain Preservation Association, was created in June 2011 to raise funding to purchase the mountain, the parking lot, and Willow Kiln Park.|$|E

5|$|The {{main roads}} through the Peak District are the A57 (Snake Pass) between Sheffield and Manchester, the A628 (Woodhead Pass) between Barnsley and Manchester via Longdendale, the A6 from Derby to Manchester via Buxton, the Cat and Fiddle road from Macclesfield to Buxton, {{and in the}} extreme north of the Park the A635 (Saddleworth Moor) running from Manchester to Barnsley and the A62 from Manchester to Leeds, which forms the northernmost border of the National Park at Standedge. These major roads, {{together}} with other minor roads and lanes in the area, are attractive to drivers, but the Peak's popularity makes road congestion and the availability <b>of</b> <b>parking</b> spaces a significant problem, especially during summer.

5|$|On July 10, 2005 a new trolley station {{opened on}} the SDSU campus, after {{construction}} began in 1999. The station connected students and faculty with other areas in San Diego county and helped to combat the low availability <b>of</b> <b>parking</b> around campus. The $103 million station {{was just one of}} the university's several construction projects that occurred in the 2000s. Starting in the late 1990s, a $500 million College Community Redevelopment Project led to the development of the $8.5 million Piedra del Sol Apartments, the $14.3 million Fraternity Row, and future developments of a $15 million Sorority Row, a $150 million Paseo retail, office, and apartment project, as well as a $125 million research and office park. In 2003, a pedestrian bridge opened, connecting several of the dorms to the main campus. In the same year, the campus's most technologically advanced and largest classroom (capable of holding 500 students) was completed. Through 2008 and 2009, the campus began work on constructing a new alumni center, expanding Aztec Center, and modifying Storm Hall and Nasitir Hall to add more office and classroom space.|$|E
5|$|The CPHC {{issued a}} {{tropical}} storm warning for Oahu on September 11 which was upgraded to a hurricane warning later that day. Though not hit by the hurricane, Iniki's large wind field caused nearly 30,000people to evacuate to 110public shelters in Oahu. Public school buildings acted as shelters, and were for refuge only, meaning they did not provide food, cots, blankets, medications or other comfort items. Roughly one-third of Oahu's population participated in the evacuation, though many others went {{to the house of}} a family member or friend for shelter. The execution of the evacuations went well, beginning with the vulnerable coastal area. For those in need, vans and buses gave emergency transportation, while police manned certain overused intersections. The two main problems that occurred during the evacuation were lack <b>of</b> <b>parking</b> at shelters and exit routes for the coastlines.|$|E
