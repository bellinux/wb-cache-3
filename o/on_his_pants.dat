500|$|It is laundry day, and SpongeBob is drying a whole load of his [...] "square pants". But {{while all}} his pants {{are in the}} dryer, SpongeBob gets distracted by Patrick who wants SpongeBob to hear him make funny sounds with his tongue for a long time. Eventually, SpongeBob goes to check <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>pants</b> which all shrunk in the dryer; he heads to the mall to buy new pairs. Upon hearing {{there will not be}} another {{shipping}} of [...] "square pants" [...] for months, SpongeBob tries out several different styles of pants at the mall until he finally chooses a pair of [...] "round pants".|$|E
500|$|Crash {{served as}} a mascot for Sony Computer Entertainment from his {{creation}} until September 2000 when Universal Interactive Studios and Konami entered an agreement that would enable Konami to publish a Crash Bandicoot game (which would later become [...] ) for next-generation game systems, with Universal Interactive handling {{the production of the}} games; the agreement served to break the Crash Bandicoot franchise's exclusivity to Sony-produced consoles and effectively made Crash Bandicoot a mascot character for Universal rather than Sony. Crash's game model in Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex was composed of approximately 1,800 polygons, which allowed an increase in detail compared to past models, including a more complex and realistic tuft of hair, a visible uvula, stitching on his jeans and shoes and a designer label <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>pants.</b>|$|E
500|$|A second seven-minute long {{accompanying}} {{video of}} a live performance (which {{should not be confused}} with the actual music video) was filmed in early 1988 in front of a live audience during Jackson's show in Madison Square Garden (Steve Stevens playing guitar). The video starts with the screen saying [...] "Pepsi Presents Michael Jackson Tour 1988" [...] in front of a white background for forty seconds. After showing a black screen, Jackson can be seen from a distance performing in front of an audience with the only source of light being blue lights. During Jackson's performance he is dressed in a white button down shirt, black pants and has metal and leather belts <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>pants</b> while singing and dancing. In between Jackson's performance from a distance, there are clips of him performing up-close while singing into a microphone, as well as clips of his guitarist Jennifer Batten performing behind him. Jackson then begins dancing and singing to the woman before walking down a cat-walk and dancing near guitarist Steve Stevens. Jackson's performance is then shown from a distance again and the video ends with Jackson finishing his performance and the lights turning blue.|$|E
50|$|The Punisher slays the Russian, {{drives to}} Ma's mansion, and intimidates {{what remains of}} her {{soldiers}} into surrendering by showing them the Russian's severed head. The Punisher then sets Ma's mansion ablaze while she helplessly screams insults at him. As fire consumes the building, Ma throws herself out a window, and tries to attack the Punisher by gnawing <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>pant</b> leg. The Punisher punts Ma back into her blazing home, where she is immolated.|$|R
60|$|Poor Gertie had time, in {{that brief}} moment, {{to note that}} Charlie Considine sat {{motionless}} <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>panting</b> horse, gazing sternly towards the karroo, and that {{a cloud of dust}} was sweeping over the plain towards them. She guessed too surely what it was, but said not a word, while her husband leaped his horse through a gap in the garden wall in order to reach the road by a short cut. Double-weighted thus, the horse did not run so well as before. Considine was frequently obliged to check his pace and look back.|$|R
60|$|A man {{was lying}} <b>on</b> <b>his</b> back <b>panting</b> in the {{culminating}} stages of violent exhaustion. His face was ghastly, his eyes bloodshot and glazed, {{for all the}} world like a dying man.|$|R
500|$|While Deangelo gets {{annoyed with}} Jim and Pam, {{he loves the}} antics of Andy, who has resorted to {{physical}} comedy when his jokes fall flat, {{getting to the point}} where he pours hot coffee <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>pants</b> and (at Deangelo's urging) eats soap; Andy tells the camera with dazed sadness that [...] "this is my life now". Deangelo's popularity with the employees causes Michael to get jealous to the point where he passes out peanut butter sandwiches, despite Deangelo's peanut allergy. Deangelo then assembles the staff in the [...] "multipurpose room", including Dwight, who learned from Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) that Michael did not put in a recommendation and thus snubs Michael. Jim quietly tells Michael that he chose to resign his job and needs to come to terms with both that choice and the fact that life is going to go on at the office. Deangelo then steps out of his meeting and asks Michael for advice for how to run the meeting, saying that he is a good manager and Dunder Mifflin will not be the same without him. The two make up with a reverse hug, Deangelo telling him that he should start enjoying his retirement. Michael returns to his office while Deangelo conducts his meeting in the conference room.|$|E
2500|$|On one {{occasion}} the anime gives Tuxedo Mask a stylized transformation sequence, with his tuxedo and accessories forming {{around him as}} he flings a rose. He does not shout any special phrase, although his voice-actor jokingly ad-libbed the line [...] "Tuxedo Power! Make up!" [...] He also acquires a transformation in the live-action series, using the same phrase, which {{is a part of}} an outrageous story he tells Usagi about how he became Tuxedo Mask. This transformation is initiated with a special band-aid, and the sequence consists of Mamoru pulling <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>pants</b> and coat with dramatic flair.|$|E
2500|$|Bell was {{the highest}} paid Padres player in 2011 at $7.5 million salary and would be {{eligible}} for free agency {{at the end of the}} season. He converted his first seven save opportunities of 2011, which tied him with Hoffman for the Padres club record of 41 consecutive successful save conversions. The streak also tied him with Hoffman and Rod Beck for the then-fourth longest in MLB history. Bell blew his next save opportunity, a 3–0 lead, after he opened the ninth inning walking the first two batters, and third baseman Chase Headley made a two-out, two-run throwing error to tie the game. On May 14, Bell recorded his 100th career save in a 9–7 win over the Colorado Rockies. Bell was selected to his third consecutive All-Star game. Entering the game in the eight inning, Bell sprinted from the bullpen and did a slide in front of the pitcher's mound, taking out a chunk of the infield grass and leaving grass stains <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>pants.</b> [...] "I wanted the fans to have fun with this", said Bell. With the team 12 games under [...]500 coming out of the All-Star break, general manager Jed Hoyer said the Padres would pursue a long-term contract with Bell if they did not get a desirable trade offer for him. Ultimately Bell was not traded at the non-waiver trade deadline on July 31, but Hoyer admitted Bell's greatest value to the team might come as a free agent if Bell refuses salary arbitration and signs elsewhere—the Padres would receive two first-round draft picks in June 2012 as compensation. Bell said he planned to accept arbitration from the Padres if they did not agree on a multi-year deal. He finished the season 43 of 48 in save opportunities with a 2.44ERA, but he struck out less than 30percent of all opponents’ at-bats for the first time as a Padre.|$|E

60|$|Then {{there was}} a sudden clamour, and as the Canarios ran forward Jefferson {{struggled}} vainly. Austin never knew where his strength came from, but in another moment the pistol slipped from his comrade's hand, and, reeling backwards, he struck the deck-house. Austin stood in front of him, with hands clenched, and the veins swollen high <b>on</b> <b>his</b> forehead, <b>panting</b> hard.|$|R
500|$|The Norwegian forces {{increased}} {{the pressure on}} Trondheim and red-hot shot rained down on the city daily. Despite Stiernsköld's swearing to [...] "boil soup <b>on</b> <b>his</b> leather <b>pants</b> before surrendering" [...] he was nevertheless forced {{to leave the city}} on December 11. According to the terms of the surrender, Stiernsköld and his men were allowed to leave under military honors with 2,500 men presenting arms.|$|R
60|$|We {{did some}} more washing {{in the lake}} this morning, and, with our clothes hung about on the dead trees and rocks, the shore looked like washing-day at home. The Indian, taking the hint, {{borrowed}} the soap, and, walking into the lake, washed his only cotton shirt on his person, then put <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>pants</b> and let it dry on him.|$|E

5000|$|Early {{shipments}} have a paint error on the Series 8 Captain America. The Ultimate Captain America {{was supposed}} to have grey paint <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>pants,</b> while the Classic Captain America was not. When the toys were first released, these paint apps were reversed. A running change later corrected the error.|$|E
5000|$|The Captain, {{after much}} wrestling with his alarm clock, finally wakes up to {{discover}} there's no buttons (for suspenders) <b>on</b> <b>his</b> ding-busted <b>pants.</b> He chews out Mama; {{she tells him}} if he doesn't like the housekeeping, {{he can do it}} himself, and storms out. What follows is pretty much the usual bunch of man-keeping-house jokes: a voracious vacuum, an overflowing sink, crashing dishes, and a dozen crises at once. And still no buttons on the pants.|$|R
60|$|One day, Alberic, in the {{character}} of a Dragon, was lying <b>on</b> <b>his</b> back, <b>panting</b> hard so as to be supposed to cast out volumes of flame and smoke at Richard, the Knight, who with a stick for a lance, and a wooden sword, was waging fierce war; when suddenly the Dragon paused, sat up, and pointed towards the warder <b>on</b> the tower. <b>His</b> horn was at his lips, and in another moment, the blast rang out through the Castle.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hullo, Jip, {{what have}} you got?" [...] asked the young man as the little dog jumped up on the {{carriage}} seat and laid <b>his</b> load <b>on</b> <b>his</b> master's knee, <b>panting</b> and wagging <b>his</b> tail {{as if he had}} done something to be praised for.|$|R
5000|$|In episode 4 of World at Your Feet, {{the series}} was {{addressed}} (as [...] "Best of buddy") and seen on a magazine when Lan Yangyang (Dennis Chew), who is applying for the supervisor of a food storage company, borrowed it from an interviewee to cover his buttocks (because of a deliberate spill <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>pants).</b>|$|E
5000|$|In the 2010 novel Mr. Peanut, a man fantasizes {{about killing}} his peanut-allergic wife by {{force-feeding}} her peanuts. [...] "He poured out a handful and ate {{them and then}} wiped the salt from his empty hand <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>pants.</b> He looked at the chipper Planters Peanuts man tipping his top hat hello and thought about how one bite could kill Alice dead." ...|$|E
5000|$|Nightmare Klonoa: An evil {{version of}} Klonoa {{introduced}} in the webcomic, appearing in a nightmare that Lolo was having. His design in general resembles a more evil-looking version of Klonoa, with spikes on his shoes and collar, fur lining <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>pants,</b> and curly fur. His cap also bears Clyde chasing a small Pac-Man rather than Pac-Man about to eat a pellet.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{went down}} below, and {{called up the}} first mate, {{and as soon as}} I’d {{explained}} to him what he was wanted for, he went right off into a fit of outrageous bad language, an’ hit me. He came right up <b>on</b> deck in <b>his</b> <b>pants</b> an’ socks. A most disrespekful way to come to the cap’n, but he was that hot and excited he didn’t care what he did.|$|R
60|$|Here {{the robber}} paused in his recital, {{overpowered}} by his emotions. Great drops of sweat stood <b>on</b> <b>his</b> forehead; he <b>panted</b> rather than breathed; his brawny bosom {{rose and fell}} like the waves of a troubled sea. When {{he had become a}} little calm, he continued his recital.|$|R
60|$|He made a {{movement}} to start back toward the sled, but found his foot rooted to the trail. He glanced down and saw that he stood in a fresh deposit of frozen red. There was red ice <b>on</b> <b>his</b> torn <b>pants</b> leg and on the moccasin beneath. With a quick effort he broke the frozen clutch of his blood and hobbled along the trail to the sled. The big leader that had bitten him began snarling and lunging, and was followed in this conduct by the whole team.|$|R
5000|$|Relief pitcher Heath Bell had {{players and}} fans {{laughing}} {{as he entered}} the game in the eight inning. Bell sprinted from the bullpen and did a slide in front of the pitcher's mound, taking out a chunk of the infield grass and leaving grass stains <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>pants.</b> [...] "I wanted the fans to have fun with this", said Bell.|$|E
50|$|Months later, while incarcerated at Baumettes prison (9th {{arrondissement}} of Marseille), he repudiated {{his confession}} after learning {{he was of}} the same blood type as the little girl (bloodstains had been found <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>pants</b> seized in his car trunk), and hearing about a local pedophile who wore a red sweater {{similar to the one}} discovered near the mushroom bed where he had hidden after the murder.|$|E
5000|$|In [...] "Training Day", new {{branch manager}} Deangelo Vickers designates Andy as the office [...] "funny guy". Deangelo loves {{the antics of}} Andy, who has resorted to {{physical}} comedy when his jokes fall flat, {{getting to the point}} where he pours hot coffee <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>pants</b> and, at Deangelo's urging, eats soap; Andy tells the camera with dazed sadness that [...] "this is my life now".|$|E
60|$|Corrie {{struggled}} like a hero, as he was. He {{tried to}} shout, but Gascoyne's right hand again squeezed the wind-pipe; {{he attempted to}} bite, but the same hand easily kept the refractory head in order; he endeavoured to kick and hit, but Gascoyne's left hand encircled him in such a comprehensive embrace and pressed him so powerfully to his piratical bosom that he could only wriggle. This he did without ceasing, until Gascoyne suddenly planted him <b>on</b> <b>his</b> feet, <b>panting</b> and dishevelled, before the astonished faces of Frederick Mason and Ole Thorwald.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes,' he said, 'better {{get back}} to the House. You overdid it yesterday. Lie down somewhere. G'bye.' And he got into his stride again. Jim watched his figure diminish, until at last it was a shapeless dot of white against the brown surface. Then he lay down <b>on</b> <b>his</b> back and <b>panted.</b>|$|R
50|$|The team kits for the 2010-11 season are {{produced}} by Nike, first in its history. For {{the first time since}} 1983, the Hércules will not have sponsor on their shirts. Only in a friendly match against Real Madrid, the Hércules wore the sponsor Cívica. On 29 July 2010, the new shirts were officially presented. The first kit, maintains its traditional colors of blue and white vertical stripes with historic characterized by its thickness. The black color of <b>his</b> <b>pants</b> is the same as in its 88-year history. The socks are blue with some white details. New for this season, is the second kit, which {{for the first time in}} his life, will have horizontal stripes <b>on</b> <b>his</b> shirt. <b>Pants</b> and socks are still black for the second kit. The socks and pants will be white, so that these items are not confused with those of a rival team.|$|R
50|$|Chapman's lawyer, Brook Hart, {{said the}} {{incident}} was a misunderstanding, stating that Chapman had spilled orange juice <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>pants,</b> and proceeded to climb into the backseat, which has darkly tinted windows, to change into a clean pair. When the security guard began yelling for Chapman to exit the vehicle, Chapman {{made the mistake of}} attempting to drive away, to avoid negative publicity. Hart stated that Chapman had no intent of terrorizing or threatening anyone.|$|E
50|$|Back in Henry's office, Trapper relates {{his version}} of the {{incident}} concerning Frank and Hawkeye, only he recalls the story as Frank slipping on a bar of soap and hitting his face {{on the corner of the}} sink. Klinger walks in, handing Radar a pair of pants that have been lengthened 3-inches. When questioned, Radar quickly answers that he's chaffing and the extra length <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>pants</b> will help alleviate this ailment.|$|E
50|$|After {{returning}} to Molly's apartment, Kirk ejaculates prematurely {{in his pants}} when things start to heat up, just as Molly's parents (played by Eve's real-life parents, Sharon Maughan and Trevor Eve) arrive for a surprise visit. Desperate to conceal the stain <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>pants,</b> Kirk seems discourteous by avoiding {{to stand up and}} shake hands, and quickly leaves Molly's apartment. Molly grows cool to Kirk after this, believing he fled to avoid meeting her parents. At Jack's urging, Kirk admits the true reasons for his leaving, and their relationship resumes.|$|E
6000|$|The sun grew hotter and hotter, Bertram's wound bled, {{though not}} profusely, the smart grew upon him, his tongue was parched with thirst, {{and though he}} kept resolutely <b>on,</b> <b>his</b> breath came <b>panting,</b> <b>his</b> head grew dizzy, his eyes dim, his feet faltered, and at last, just as he {{attained}} a wider and more trodden way, he dropped insensible {{by the side of}} the path, his dry lips trying to utter the cry, [...] "Lord, have mercy on me!" ...|$|R
50|$|Skeat and Thomas later {{visit the}} army commander, the Duke of Normandy. Thomas has {{discovered}} {{a way to}} assault the city from the rear- a weak wooden palisade is all that prevents the army's entry, and they are weakly placed.

Thomas and his men successfully penetrate the city, open the gates and the town is sacked. During the onslaught Jekyll encounters Jeanette and attempts to rape her, but is prevented by the Earl, who walks in <b>on</b> him with <b>his</b> <b>pants</b> down.|$|R
