To them {{he added a}} rational and efficient local administration, an end to rural banditry, the encouragement of science and the arts, the abolition of feudalism and the greatest codification of laws {{since the fall of}} the Roman Empire.|$|E
5|$|The {{universe}} of the Drakengard series is split between multiple timelines. Events in those timelines are separate, {{but they can}} overlap. The core timeline is formed from Drakengard and its sequel. Drakengard 3 acts as the first game's prequel, but most of its events take place in separate timelines leading to different outcomes. In Drakengard 3, a malevolent flower uses servants called the Intoners, women gifted {{with the power to}} use magic through song, as instruments of humanity's destruction. In Drakengard, which succeeds the fifth version of Drakengard 3s events detailed in a supplementary novel, the Watchers use a group known as the Cult of Watchers to spark a religious war and destroy the seals. In Drakengard 2, the Watchers continue to use {{the former head of the}} cult to destroy the new seals, while the dragons prepare to usurp the gods and rule over the world. Nier is set in an alternative reality created by events stemming from Drakengards fifth ending: in this reality, <b>our</b> <b>modern</b> world was decimated by a plague created by the magical beings who came through the portal, bringing humanity to the brink of extinction. Nier: Automata takes place after the fourth ending of Nier, featuring appearances and mentions of characters from both Nier and the Drakengard games.|$|E

If he once begins by attempting passing expressions of passion, which is all stage portraits can give, he will find them so much easier than honest representations of character, that he will end, where all <b>our</b> <b>moderns</b> seem to do, in merest melodrama." ...|$|R

He appeared in <b>Our</b> <b>Modern</b> Maidens (1929), which led to a well-publicized romance and marriage to his co-star, Joan Crawford. He also appeared with John Gilbert and Greta Garbo in A Woman of Affairs (1928), which gave his career a considerable boost.|$|E
25|$|Strong {{authentication}} requires {{providing more}} than one type of authentication information (two-factor authentication). The username {{is the most common}} form of identification on computer systems today and the password is {{the most common form of}} authentication. Usernames and passwords have served their purpose but in <b>our</b> <b>modern</b> world they are no longer adequate. Usernames and passwords are slowly being replaced with more sophisticated authentication mechanisms.|$|E
25|$|The debates {{represent}} one of {{the highest}} points of scientific research {{in the first half of}} the twentieth century because it called attention to an element of quantum theory, quantum non-locality, which is central to <b>our</b> <b>modern</b> understanding of the physical world. The consensus view of professional physicists has been that Bohr proved victorious in his defense of quantum theory, and definitively established the fundamental probabilistic character of quantum measurement.|$|E

25|$|Since his {{beginnings}} as a geologist, George Poulett Scrope {{fostered a}} number of friendly relationships with some well-known natural philosophers. On his voyage and during the years since, Charles Darwin sent some letters to Scrope, checking certain geological observations and calculations he made, and made other general geology and scientific (in <b>our</b> <b>modern</b> terms) queries. These documents are mentioned by numerous sources, but were unavailable for review by this researcher.|$|E
25|$|As wagons were {{normally}} {{built at}} standard gauge, the streetcar rails {{were selected to}} be slightly wider, allowing the wagons to ride on the inside sections of the rail, and the streetcars on the outside. The Williams Omnibus Bus Line changed the gauge of their buses in 1861 to fit this gauge. At the time, track for horsecars was not <b>our</b> <b>modern</b> 'T' rail, but wide and flat, with a raised section {{on the outside of}} the rail.|$|E
25|$|It {{proclaimed the}} {{equality}} of citizens before the law, equality of languages, freedom of thought and faith; it created a Swiss citizenship, basis of <b>our</b> <b>modern</b> nationality, and the separation of powers, of which the old regime had no conception; it suppressed internal tariffs and other economic restraints; it unified weights and measures, reformed civil and penal law, authorised mixed marriages (between Catholics and Protestants), suppressed torture and improved justice; it developed education and public works.|$|E
500|$|A {{second issue}} (in his view) is the {{compactness}} of Old English words, which often have no modern equivalents, and phrases which are [...] "inevitably weakened even in prose by transference to <b>our</b> looser <b>modern</b> language".|$|R
50|$|It {{seemed to}} be a {{commonly}} held opinion that he invariably covered the last 220 yards in 12 seconds flat, {{despite the fact that he}} rode a gear of 68 inches with 6½-inch cranks... and no toestraps! Now this, if true, would be a phenomenal performance, seeing that <b>our</b> <b>moderns,</b> with gears in the high eighties or low nineties, on modern machines and tires, only rarely get below 13 sec. There is, unfortunately, no direct evidence of Zimmerman's performances over the 220 yards, for the very simple reason that in those days it was not customary to mark off the 220 yards mark nor to take times from it.|$|R

25|$|Even though humans derive many {{benefits}} from nature, <b>our</b> <b>modern</b> lifestyles {{have created a}} disconnect from the natural environment wherein we spend significantly more time indoors. Some researchers estimate that humans spend up to 90% of their lives indoors. This disconnection from nature can {{have a negative impact}} on humans because we are missing out on the beneficial effects of nature. As a result, we are less connected to nature and feel less responsibility to protect this environment.|$|E
25|$|A 16th-century {{physician}} {{wrote that}} many laborers dozed off exhausted {{at the start}} of each night; sexual intercourse with their wives typically occurring in the watching period, after a recuperative first sleep. Anthropologists find that isolated societies without electric light sleep in a variety of patterns; seldom do they resemble <b>our</b> <b>modern</b> habit of sleeping in one single eight-hour bout. Much has been written about dream interpretation, from biblical times to Freud, but sleep itself was historically seen as a passive state of not-awake.|$|E
25|$|Greek {{geometrical}} astronomy developed {{away from}} the model of concentric spheres to employ more complex models in which an eccentric circle would carry around a smaller circle, called an epicycle which in turn carried around a planet. The first such model is attributed to Apollonius of Perga and further developments in it were {{carried out in the}} 2nd century BC by Hipparchus of Nicea. Hipparchus made a number of other contributions, including the first measurement of precession and the compilation of the first star catalog in which he proposed <b>our</b> <b>modern</b> system of apparent magnitudes.|$|E

There may be plenty that is painful in real life; but for that very reason, we don't want it in books. The English novelist who enters my house (no foreign novelist will be admitted) must understand his art as the healthy-minded English reader understands it in our time. He must know that <b>our</b> purer <b>modern</b> taste, <b>our</b> higher <b>modern</b> morality, limits him to doing exactly two things for us, when he writes us a book. All we want of him is--occasionally to make us laugh; and invariably to make us comfortable." ...|$|R
25|$|Information assurance: The act of {{providing}} {{trust of the}} information, that the Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability (CIA) of the information are not violated, e.g. ensuring that data is not lost when critical issues arise. These issues include, {{but are not limited}} to: natural disasters, computer/server malfunction or physical theft. Since most information is stored on computers in <b>our</b> <b>modern</b> era, information assurance is typically dealt with by IT security specialists. A common method {{of providing}} information assurance is to have an off-site backup of the data in case one of the mentioned issues arise.|$|E
25|$|It is true, as {{the critics}} suggest, that the {{readings}} forego overt emotion, but what emerges instead {{is a solid}} sense of structure, letting the music speak convincingly for itself. It {{is also true that}} Strauss's tempos are generally swift, but this, too, contributes to the structural cohesion and in any event is fully in keeping with <b>our</b> <b>modern</b> outlook in which speed is a virtue and attention spans are defined more by MTV clips and news sound bites than by evenings at the opera and thousand page novels.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{definition of}} sleep paralysis was codified by Samuel Johnson in his A Dictionary of the English Language as nightmare, {{a term that}} evolved into <b>our</b> <b>modern</b> definition. Such sleep paralysis was widely considered the work of demons, and more specifically incubi, which were thought {{to sit on the}} chests of sleepers. In Old English the name for these beings was mare or mære (from a proto-Germanic *marōn, cf. Old Norse mara), hence comes the mare in the word nightmare. The word might be etymologically cognate to Greek Marōn (in the Odyssey) and Sanskrit Māra.|$|E
