However, {{the effects of}} 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 -directed signaling on <b>oral</b> <b>keratinocyte</b> pathophysiology have not been well studied. We examined the role of 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 in regulating proliferation and differentiation in cultured oral keratinocytes and on the oral epithelium in vivo. Using lentiviral-mediated shRNA to silence VDR, we generated an <b>oral</b> <b>keratinocyte</b> cell line with stable knockdown of VDR expression. VDR knockdown significantly enhanced proliferation and disrupted calcium- and 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 -induced <b>oral</b> <b>keratinocyte</b> differentiation, emphasizing the anti-proliferative and pro-differentiation effects of 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 in oral keratinocytes. Using vitamin D 3 -deficient diets, we induced chronic vitamin D deficiency in mice as evidenced by decreased serum 25 -hydroxyvitamin D (25 OHD) concentrations. The vitamin D-deficient mice manifested increased proliferation of the tongue epithelium, but did not develop any morphological or histological abnormalities in the oral epithelium, suggesting that vitamin D deficiency alone is insufficient to alter oral epithelial homeostasis and provoke carcinogenesis. Immunohistochemical analyses of human and murine oral squamous cell carcinomas showed increased VDR expression. Overall, our results provide strong support for a crucial role for vitamin D signaling in <b>oral</b> <b>keratinocyte</b> pathophysiology...|$|E
40|$|The {{integrin}} ?v? 6 is a fibronectin receptor that is undetectable on normal keratinocytes in situ, but {{is increased}} significantly in wound healing and in culture-established keratinocytes, {{suggesting that it}} may promote changes associated with cell motility. Using normal human oral keratinocytes we have shown that cultured cells express relatively high levels of ?v? 6 and this integrin has a functional role in both cell adhesion and migration towards fibronectin. We provide experimental evidence that the increased expression of ?v? 6 by normal human oral keratinocytes results in coordinate changes, which promote a more migratory phenotype. Thus increased expression of ?v? 6 results in a fibronectin-dependent increase in pro-matrix metalloproteinase 9, matrix metalloproteinase 9 activity increases normal human <b>oral</b> <b>keratinocyte</b> migration, {{and this may be}} further dependent on plasmin activation. The results suggest a key role for ?v? 6 in these processes and indicate a coordinated link between ?v? 6 expression and upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase 9.

The {{objective of this}} study was to determine if α 7 nAChR activation inhibited pathogen-induced interleukin- 8 (IL- 8) expression by <b>oral</b> <b>keratinocytes.</b> Materials and methods: Periodontal tissue expression of α 7 nAChR was determined by real-time PCR. OKF 6 /TERT- 2 <b>oral</b> <b>keratinocytes</b> were exposed to Porphyromonas gingivalis in the presence and absence of a α 7 nAChR agonist (PHA- 543613 hydrochloride) alone or after pre-exposure to a specific α 7 nAChR antagonist (α-bungarotoxin). Interleukin- 8 (IL- 8) expression was measured by ELISA and real-time PCR. Phosphorylation of the NF-κB p 65 subunit was determined using an NF-κB p 65 profiler assay and STAT- 3 activation by STAT- 3 in-cell ELISA. The release of ACh from <b>oral</b> <b>keratinocytes</b> in response to P. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide was determined using a GeneBLAzer M 3 CHO-K 1 -blacell reporter assay. Results: Expression of α 7 nAChR mRNA was elevated in diseased periodontal tissue. PHA- 543613 hydrochloride inhibited P. Gingivalis -induced expression of IL- 8 at the transcriptional level. This effect was abolished when cells were pre-exposed to a specific α 7 nAChR antagonist, α-bungarotoxin. PHA- 543613 hydrochloride downregulated NF-κB signalling through reduced phosphorylation of the NF-κB p 65 -subunit. In addition, PHA- 543613 hydrochloride promoted STAT- 3 signalling by maintenance of phosphorylation. Furthermore, <b>oral</b> <b>keratinocytes</b> upregulated ACh release in response to P.

In this study we performed an integrative, whole-genome analysis for discovery of epigenetically activated proto-oncogenes in head and neck cancer tumors. We used the 47 K GeneChip U 133 Plus 2. 0 Affymetrix expression microarray platform to obtain re-expression data from 5 -aza treated normal cell line and expression data from primary head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) tumor tissues and normal mucosa tissues. We then investigated candidate genes by screening promoter regions for CpG islands and bisulfite sequencing followed by QUMSP and RT PCR for the best candidate genes. Finally, functional studies were performed on the top candidate gene. From the top 178 screened candidates 96 had CpG islands in their promoter region. Seven candidate genes showed promoter region methylation in normal mucosa samples and promoter demethylation in a small cohort of primary HNSCC tissues. We then studied the demethylation of the top 3 candidate genes in an expanded cohort of 76 HNSCC tissue samples and 17 normal mucosa samples. We identified MAGEB 2 as having significant promoter demethylation in primary head and neck squamous cell carcinoma tissues. We then found significantly higher expression of MAGEB 2 in tumors in a separate cohort of 73 primary HNSCC tissues and 31 normal tissues.

Therefore, the production of these chemokines in peripheral tissues could be instrumental in the pathophysiology of tissue-specific immunological diseases such as oral lichen planus (OLP). In the present study, we assessed the production of keratinocyte-derived CXCL 9 / 10 / 11 under basal and inflammatory conditions and investigated whether these chemokines were involved in the pathogenesis of OLP. We used semi-quantitative PCR, ELISA, chemotaxis assays, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to assess the expression and functional role of CXCL 9 / 10 / 11 in <b>oral</b> <b>keratinocytes</b> (three strains of normal human <b>oral</b> <b>keratinocytes</b> (NHOK), and the H 357 oral cancer cell line) in the presence or absence of IFN-γ. CXCL 9 / 10 / 11 were also assessed in tissues from normal patients and those with oral lichen planus (OLP). The time course study in <b>oral</b> <b>keratinocytes</b> treated with IFN-γ showed that expression of CXCL 9 / 10 / 11 chemokines was significantly enhanced by IFN-γ in a time-dependent manner.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Oral</b> <b>keratinocytes</b> on the mucosal surface are {{frequently}} exposed to HIV- 1 through contact with infected sexual partners or nursing mothers. To determine the plausibility that <b>oral</b> <b>keratinocytes</b> are primary targets of HIV- 1, {{we tested the}} hypothesis that HIV- 1 infects <b>oral</b> <b>keratinocytes</b> in a restricted manner. Results To study the fate of HIV- 1, immortalized <b>oral</b> <b>keratinocytes</b> (OKF 6 /TERT- 2; TERT- 2 cells) were characterized for the fate of HIV-specific RNA and DNA. At 6 h post inoculation with X 4 or R 5 -tropic HIV- 1, HIV- 1 gag RNA was detected maximally within TERT- 2 cells. Reverse transcriptase activity in TERT- 2 cells was confirmed by VSV-G-mediated infection with HIV-NL 4 - 3 Δenv-EGFP. AZT inhibited EGFP expression in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that viral replication can be supported if receptors are bypassed. Within 3 h post inoculation, integrated HIV- 1 DNA was detected in TERT- 2 cell nuclei and persisted after subculture. Multiply spliced and unspliced HIV- 1 mRNAs were not detectable up to 72 h post inoculation, suggesting that HIV replication may abort and that infection is non-productive. Within 48 h post inoculation, however, virus harbored by CD 4 negative TERT- 2 cells trans infected co-cultured {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMCs) or MOLT 4 cells (CD 4 + CCR 5 +) by direct cell-to-cell transfer or by releasing low levels of infectious virions.

The first section of the study aimed to determine the influence of the surface finishing condition of a Ni-based (d. Sign? 10) dental casting alloy on the biocompatibility potential. The biocompatibility was determined following direct and indirect exposure of the dental casting alloys to the 2 D <b>oral</b> <b>keratinocyte</b> cell monolayer structures. The clinically relevant polished dental casting alloys induced significantly increased adverse biological effects compared with the ?as-cast? alumina particle air abraded alloys. In addition, the study showed that the use of trypsin-edetate disodium (EDTA) was inappropriate in the determination of the TR 146 cell density measurements and highlighted difficulties for comparisons with trypsin-EDTA-treated cell density studies in the dental literature. The biocompatibility potential of two polished Ni- based (d. Sign? 10 and d. Sign? 15) and a cobalt-chromium (Co-Cr) (d.

The influence of oral microorganisms (Streptococcus mutans, Candida albicans and Candida dubliniensis) on the biocompatibility potential of the dental casting alloys was also determined using the 2 D TR 146 cell monolayer structure. Oral microorganisms were shown to enhance the loss of biocompatibility, possibly due to the decreased pH levels, which exacerbated metal ion leachate release levels from the alloys...|$|E

Filaggrin/profilaggrin and keratin 1 were used as biochemical markers for cornified epithelium and keratins 13 and 19 as markers for noncornified epithelium. Cultured <b>oral</b> <b>keratinocytes</b> in RA-free conditions differentiated in a manner that closely resembled the differentiation pattern of gingival epithelia in viva. Increasing RA concentrations altered the in vivo-like terminal differentiation of <b>oral</b> <b>keratinocytes</b> by disruption of organized stratification, inhibition of filaggrin/profilaggrin and K 1 expression, and stimulation of K 13 and K 19 expression. Differentiation of keratinocytes from both cornified and noncornified regions of the oral cavity varied in a similar manner in response to added RA, with the exception of K 19 expression. K 19 was consistently expressed at higher levels in keratinocytes originating from noncornified epithelia as compared to those from cornified epithelia. The level of RA regulation was ultimately dependent on the type of fibroblasts underlying the epithelial cells. Homologous fibroblasts rendered the <b>oral</b> <b>keratinocytes</b> less sensitive to the effects of RA than skin fibroblasts, In addition, at a given RA concentration, fibroblasts from cornified <b>oral</b> mucosa potentiated <b>keratinocyte</b> expression of RA sensitive markers of keratinization as compared to the influence exerted by fibroblasts originating from noncornified oral mucosa.

40|$|The AIDS {{pandemic}} continues. Little {{is understood}} about how HIV gains access to permissive cells across mucosal surfaces, yet such knowledge {{is crucial to}} the development of successful topical anti-HIV- 1 agents and mucosal vaccines.

Interactions between HIV- 1 and <b>oral</b> <b>keratinocytes</b> have been modeled in the context of key environmental factors, including putative copathogens and saliva.

Because psychological stress increases salivary catecholamines and impairs oral mucosal wound healing, we sought to determine if epithelial adrenergic signaling could link these two findings. We found that cultured human oral keratinocytes (HOK) express the α 2 B- and β 2 -adrenergic receptors (ARs). Exposure of HOK to either epinephrine or the β-AR agonist, isoproterenol, reduced migratory speed and decreased in vitro scratch wound healing. Incubation with the β-AR antagonist timolol reversed the catecholamine-induced effects, indicating that the observed response is mediated by β-AR. Epinephrine treatment decreased phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) ERK 1 / 2 and p 38; these decreases were also reversed with timolol.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to develop a serum-free system for culturing canine <b>oral</b> <b>keratinocytes,</b> the construction and characterization of a canine ex vivo produced oral mucosa equivalent (EVPOME), and transduction green fluorescent protein (GFP) into keratinocytes as a post-grafting tracking marker. Dissociated canine buccal mucosa keratinocytes were cultured in a chemically defined serum-free medium, Epilife™. First-passage keratinocytes were transfected with the GFP gene using a lentiviral vector, sorted by flow cytometer and seeded onto a dermal equivalent, AlloDerm® to form EVPOMEs. The EVPOME was characterized by histology and immunohistochemistry, for p 63, Ki- 67, and involucrin. Laser confocal microscopy was used to locate GFP-transfected keratinocytes within the EVPOME. Cultured canine <b>oral</b> <b>keratinocytes</b> grew rapidly over the first three passages and then the proliferative rate decreased. The canine EVPOME formed a well-stratified epithelial layer. The majority of p 63 and Ki- 67 immunopositive cells were located in the basal layer whereas cytoplasmic involucrin expression was seen in the suprabasal layers, similar to native canine buccal mucosa. Under laser confocal microscopy, significant green fluorescence was observed throughout the EVPOME. In conclusion, canine EVPOMEs were successfully fabricated in a defined serum-free system with similar characteristics to native buccal mucosa. GFP-transfected canine <b>oral</b> <b>keratinocytes</b> could be identified within the EVPOME. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res 71 A: 143 – 153, 200...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} by which resin based materials induce adverse effects in patients have not been completely elucidated. Here we show that 2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) induces apopto-tic cell death in <b>oral</b> <b>keratinocytes.</b> Functional loss and cell death induced by HEMA was significantly inhibited {{in the presence of}} N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) treatment. NAC also prevented HEMA mediated decrease in vascular endothelial growth factor secretion. The protective effect of NAC was partly related to its ability to induce NF-kB in the cells, since HEMA mediated inhibition of nuclear NF-kB expression and function was significantly blocked in the presence of NAC treatment. Moreover, blocking of nuclear translocation of NF-kB in <b>oral</b> <b>keratinocytes</b> sensitized these cells to HEMA mediated apoptosis. In addition, since NAC was capable of rescuing close to 50 % of NF-kB knockdown cells from HEMA mediated cell death, there is, therefore, an NF-k...|$|R
40|$|Macrophage {{inflammatory}} protein- 3 a/C-C chemokine ligand 20 (MIP- 3 a/CCL 20) is an antimicrobial peptide {{that plays}} an important role in innate immunity. In addition to direct microbicidal effects, MIP- 3 a/CCL 20 also exhibits cytokine-like functions that are critical during dendritic cell activation. The aim of the present study was to investigate further which signaling pathways are involved in the MIP- 3 a/CCL 20 mRNA expression in response to whole-cell Porphyromonas gingivalis. Primary gingival epithelial cells (GECs) and the immortalized <b>oral</b> <b>keratinocyte</b> cell-line OKF 6 /TERT- 2 were stimulated with whole-cell P. gingivalis. Prior to stimulation, GECs and OKF 6 /TERT- 2 cells were pretreated with specific inhibitors for nuclear-factor-kB (NF-kB), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phospholipase C (PLC), and phosphatidylinositol- 3 -kinase (PI 3 K). In GECs and OKF 6 /TERT- 2 cells, activation of NF-kB was examined after exposure to P. gingivalis. The gene expression of MIP- 3 a/CCL 20 was significantly induced in response to P. gingivalis (P 0. 05) compared to unstimulated control cells. This induction was specifically blocked when cells were pre-incubated with inhibitors for NF-kB, MAPK, and PLC (P 0. 05), but not for PI 3 K. These results demonstrate that P. gingivalis induces the MIP- 3 a/CCL 20 mRNA in a NF-kB-, PLC-, and MAPK-dependent manner...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{advances}} in clinical management, 5 -year survival rate {{in patients with}} late-stage head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) has not improved significantly over the past decade. Targeted therapies have {{emerged as one of}} the most promising approaches to treat several malignancies. Though tyrosine phosphorylation accounts for a minority of total phosphorylation, it is critical for activation of signaling pathways and plays a significant role in driving cancers. To identify activated tyrosine kinase signaling pathways in HNSCC, we compared the phosphotyrosine profiles of a panel of HNSCC cell lines to a normal <b>oral</b> <b>keratinocyte</b> cell line. Dual-specificity tyrosine-(Y) -phosphorylation regulated kinase 1 A (DYRK 1 A) was one of the kinases hyperphosphorylated at Tyr- 321 in all HNSCC cell lines. Inhibition of DYRK 1 A resulted in an increased apoptosis and decrease in invasion and colony formation ability of HNSCC cell lines. Further, administration of the small molecular inhibitor against DYRK 1 A in mice bearing HNSCC xenograft tumors induced regression of tumor growth. Immunohistochemical labeling of DYRK 1 A in primary tumor tissues using tissue microarrays revealed strong to moderate staining of DYRK 1 A in 97. 5 % (39 / 40) of HNSCC tissues analyzed. Taken together our results suggest that DYRK 1 A could be a novel therapeutic target in HNSCC...|$|E
40|$|Epithelial-mesenchymal {{transition}} is reportedly important in loss of epithelial integrity and cell migration in inflammatory/infectious diseases and cancer. Since Gram negative anaerobic periodontal pathogens are well-recognized to induce intense inflammatory responses; {{the present study}} investigated their ability to induce EMT in vitro. A 2 D chronic inflammatory model was developed using either the H 400 <b>oral</b> <b>keratinocyte</b> cell-line or primary rat oral keratinocytes which were exposed to heat-killed Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Escherichia coli LPS for up to 8 -days. EMT-associated changes were determined using semi-quantitative-RT-PCR, PCR-arrays, ELISA, scratch/transwell migration assays, immunocytochemistry/immunofluorescence, and transepithelial electrical resistance. Chronically stimulated cultures increased extracellular levels of the EMT regulatory cytokines, TGF-β 1, TNF-α and EGF, whilst subsequent EMT-induction was indicated by up-regulation of mesenchymal markers, including vimentin and N-cadherin, and concomitant down-regulation of epithelial markers including E-cadherin and β-catenin. In addition, intracellular signaling activity of key EMT regulatory transcription factors, Snail- 1 and NF-ĸB, increased following chronic bacterial exposure and was associated with enhanced cellular migratory activity and reduced epithelial barrier integrity. These results indicated {{for the first time that}} EMT may be involved in the compromised epithelial barrier function observed during periodontitis pathogenesis which may occur in response to prolonged local bacterial exposure...|$|E

40|$|Cancer {{associated}} with {{smoking and drinking}} remains a serious health problem worldwide. The survival of patients is very poor {{due to the lack}} of effective early biomarkers. FOXM 1 overexpression is linked to the majority of human cancers but its mechanism remains unclear in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). FOXM 1 mRNA and protein expressions were investigated in four independent cohorts (total 75 patients) consisting of normal, premalignant and HNSCC tissues and cells using quantitative PCR (qPCR), expression microarray, immunohistochemistry and immunocytochemistry. Effect of putative oral carcinogens on FOXM 1 transcriptional activity was dose-dependently assayed and confirmed using a FOXM 1 -specific luciferase reporter system, qPCR, immunoblotting and short-hairpin RNA interference. Genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array was used to 'trace' the genomic instability signature pattern in 8 clonal lines of FOXM 1 -induced malignant human <b>oral</b> <b>keratinocytes.</b> Furthermore, acute FOXM 1 upregulation in primary <b>oral</b> <b>keratinocytes</b> directly induced genomic instability. We have shown for the first time that overexpression of FOXM 1 precedes HNSCC malignancy. Screening putative carcinogens in human <b>oral</b> <b>keratinocytes</b> surprisingly showed that nicotine, which is not perceived to be a human carcinogen, directly induced FOXM 1 mRNA, protein stabilisation and transcriptional activity at concentrations relevant to tobacco chewers. Importantly, nicotine also augmented FOXM 1 -induced transformation of human <b>oral</b> <b>keratinocytes.</b> A centrosomal protein CEP 55 and a DNA helicase/putative stem cell marker HELLS, both located within a consensus loci (10 q 23), were found to be novel targets of FOXM 1 and their expression correlated tightly with HNSCC progression. This study cautions the potential co-carcinogenic effect of nicotine in tobacco replacement therapies. We hypothesise that aberrant upregulation of FOXM 1 may be inducing genomic instability through a program of malignant transformation involving the activation of CEP 55 and HELLS which may facilitate aberrant mitosis and epigenetic modifications. Our finding that FOXM 1 is upregulated early during oral cancer progression renders FOXM 1 an attractive diagnostic biomarker for early cancer detection and its candidate mechanistic targets, CEP 55 and HELLS, as indicators of malignant conversion and progression...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIt {{has been}} {{reported}} that nicotine/alcohol alters epigenetic control and leads to abrogated DNA methylation and histone modifications, which could subsequently perturb transcriptional regulation critically important in cellular transformation. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine the molecular mechanisms of nicotine/alcohol-induced epigenetic alterations and their mechanistic roles in transcriptional regulation in human adult stem cells. We hypothesized that nicotine/alcohol induces deregulation of epigenetic machinery and leads to epigenetic alterations, which subsequently affect transcriptional regulation in oral epithelial stem cells. As an initiating step we have profiled transcriptomic alterations induced by the combinatory administration of EtOH and nicotine in primary normal human <b>oral</b> <b>keratinocytes.</b> Here we provide detailed experimental methods, analysis and information associated with our data deposited into Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under GSE 57634.
