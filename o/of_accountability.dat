Also in response to complaints about the DoD's response to the incident, the U.S. House of Representatives' Armed Services Subcommittee on Military Personnel scheduled a hearing on the incident for 3 August 1995 to examine the accident investigation and the judicial actions that followed.

The evaluation was also aimed at determining the impact <b>of</b> political <b>accountability</b> on project sustainability. In order {{to evaluate the}} question, field research was conducted. Field research was of a quantitative nature, using a questionnaire. This involved (a) selecting two systems (project implementers, a municipality and a non-governmental organisation) where the systems’ political accountability within water projects could be compared, and (b) interviewing community respondents from a set questionnaire in four villages. The main findings are that (i) the level <b>of</b> political <b>accountability</b> in water projects depends on the system implementing a water project, (ii) three elements <b>of</b> political <b>accountability</b> (responsibility, information, and inclusion) differ significantly between the two systems, and (iii) political accountability has {{a significant impact on}} project sustainability.

40|$|Individual <b>accountability</b> is one <b>of</b> {{cooperative}} learning (CL) principles (Johnson & Johnson, 1999; Kagan, 1989; Olsen & Kagan, 1992; Slavin, 1995). This study defines {{it as an}} activity (performance or presentation) done by individual students {{in front of their}} CL peers to complete a learning task. The study took place in Indonesian secondary school EFL classrooms. Among the questions explored was: How does individual accountability in CL help EFL learners learn the target language? To address the question, qualitative case study was employed. Data were collected through participant observations, in-depth interviewing, and document analysis. To guide data collection and analysis, constructivist grounded theory (Charmaz, 2014) was used. Four levels <b>of</b> individual <b>accountability</b> in CL were identified: 1) individual accountability in pairs, 2) in home groups, 3) in other groups, and 4) to the whole class. Peer interaction usually takes place between two levels <b>of</b> individual <b>accountability</b> and an initial or lower level <b>of</b> individual <b>accountability</b> usually prepares EFL learners for a higher level <b>of</b> individual <b>accountability.</b> A performance or presentation <b>of</b> individual <b>accountability</b> in CL is carried out either in spoken or written mode. In the studied classrooms, these activities <b>of</b> individual <b>accountability</b> in CL promoted the EFL learners‘ production of spoken English. This role <b>of</b> individual <b>accountability</b> in CL helped meet the need of the EFL learners because, as they reported, speaking was the most challenging language skill to learn. This finding fills the gap in the literature on how communicative approach to language teaching (CLT) is put in practice...|$|R
