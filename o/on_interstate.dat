5|$|Barry dropped {{moderate}} to heavy rainfall across Florida, peaking at 6.99inches (178mm) at Palm Beach International Airport; several other locations reported over 3inches (75mm). The rainfall alleviated persistent drought conditions and assisted in combating severe wildfires across the state. In Brevard County, the rainfall closed {{a portion of}} Eau Gallie Boulevard after a large sinkhole developed. Several other roads across the area were flooded, and <b>on</b> <b>Interstate</b> 95 near Lake Worth, a sinkhole closed two lanes of traffic. Wet roads caused several traffic accidents across the state; in both Brevard and Volusia counties, a motorist was killed from an accident. <b>On</b> <b>Interstate</b> 4, a tractor trailer led to disruptions near Orlando after it crashed into a guardrail.|$|E

5|$|Interstate 70 (I-70) is a transcontinental Interstate Highway in the United States, {{stretching}} from Cove Fort, Utah, to Baltimore, Maryland. In Colorado, the highway traverses an east–west route across {{the center of}} the state. In western Colorado, the highway connects the metropolitan areas of Grand Junction and Denver via a route through the Rocky Mountains. In eastern Colorado, the highway crosses the Great Plains, connecting Denver with metropolitan areas in Kansas and Missouri. Bicycles and other non-motorized vehicles, normally prohibited <b>on</b> <b>Interstate</b> Highways, are allowed on those stretches of I-70 in the Rockies where no other through route exists.|$|E

Chambersburg's retail sector has grown quickly since 2006 with the opening of Target, Petsmart, Michaels, and Kohls near the newly built Exit 17 of Interstate 81.

5|$|Seattle Transit {{general manager}} Lloyd Garber said that demand for parking {{was higher than}} {{expected}} {{and that it was}} too early to analyze ridership; after the first week of service, Seattle Transit began surveying riders to determine whether motorists had been lured by the new service. The study determined that 75 percent of surveyed patrons had switched from their personal automobiles, and that Blue Streak was responsible for a decrease of 400 vehicles <b>on</b> <b>Interstate</b> 5 at rush hour. By late October, demand at the Northgate park and ride prompted the State Highway Department to offer funding for an auxiliary lot.|$|E
50|$|One {{example of}} this type of route would be Metro Transit Metro Transit Route 114 in Minneapolis, MN.

5|$|The 2005Baylor {{game was}} played in Waco, Texas, {{approximately}} 100miles (161km) north <b>on</b> <b>Interstate</b> 35 from Austin. Since UT home games are usually sold out and Waco is relatively close to Austin, recent games against Baylor have attracted numerous Texas fans driving to Waco to see the game. The Baylor athletic department suspended ticket sales at onepoint {{in an effort to}} limit the number of Longhorn fans who purchased tickets. The average attendance for Baylor's home games for the season was 38,899, but for the UT game the attendance was 44,783 still short of the 50,000official capacity for Baylor's Floyd Casey Stadium.|$|E

It soon splits, with I-80 exiting to bypass Sacramento to the north and Interstate 80 Business (legislatively U.S. Route 50) {{continuing}} east via exit 82 towards downtown. After one interchange, at Harbor Boulevard (exit 1/1B), the freeway splits again, with Bus. 80 turning abruptly southeast over the Pioneer Memorial Bridge to avoid downtown Sacramento. State Route 275 begins here, at exit 3 of Bus. 80, with full access to and from the intersecting Jefferson Boulevard (State Route 84).|$|E

Also in Albemarle, two people were killed when their car drove off a road and crashed into a tree during heavy rainfall. A man in Chesterfield County died when struck by a tree. Three people died when a car in southern Fluvanna County crashed into a tree. The deaths were considered indirectly related to the storm.|$|E

5|$|Community Transit's Strategic Planning Group {{published}} a recommendation in 2004, calling for {{bus rapid transit}} service on the State Route 99 corridor between Everett Station and Aurora Village Transit Center, featuring off-board fare collection, limited stops, and transit signal priority. The route alternatives proposed included express service from Aurora Village to Downtown Seattle via Aurora Avenue North or Interstate 5, as well as express service <b>on</b> <b>Interstate</b> 5 in Everett, if a partnership to share costs with Everett Transit for the Evergreen Way segment was not viable. In December 2005, the CT Board of Directors approved an accelerated planning schedule for a bus rapid transit project, to cost an estimated $15–20 million, and to begin service as the first such system in the Puget Sound region in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Community Transit's {{planning}} for limited-stop bus service, which later evolved into bus rapid transit, {{began in the}} 1990s, with proposals to build bus lanes on State Route 99 between 145th Street NE in Shoreline and Casino Road (near State Route 526) in Everett. Sound Transit was established in 1996 as a regional transit authority, and selected the State Route 99 corridor as a route for its express bus system, but later replaced it, before service began, with an express route <b>on</b> <b>Interstate</b> 5 from Everett to Northgate, while leaving SR 99 to Community Transit. Sound Transit funded the construction of business access and transit lanes on State Route 99 through Lynnwood from 244th Street to 148th Street in 2002, converting former parking lanes, and widening the highway in some areas, improving existing bus service, and laying the ground for a future bus rapid transit line.|$|E
