40|$|A digital PWM {{controller}} for Buck-boost converter {{is designed}} using MATLAB-Simulink. The mathematical model of PWM controller is derived to design in MATLAB simulation model. In this Proposed model, the digital PWM controller {{is used to}} obtain the positive <b>ouput</b> <b>voltage</b> from the buck boost converter {{in the range of}} 101 V from the variable input voltage of 50 - 200 V. The proposed model is highly efficient and flexible for all kind of renewable energy conversion methods. In this paper, the basic principles of the proposed digitally controlled Positive buck boost converters are illustrated in detail and also we discussed about the proposed model <b>ouput</b> <b>voltage</b> is employed for DC Motor applications...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Sepic and ´Cuk {{converters}} {{working as}} power factor preregulators (PFP) in discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) present the following desirable characteristics for a PFP: 1) the converter {{works as a}} voltage follower (no current loop is needed); 2) theoretical power factor is unity; and 3) the input current ripple is defined at the design stage. Besides, input-output galvanic isolation is easily obtained. This paper analyzes the operation of both converters as DCM–PFP. Design equations are derived, {{as well as a}} small-signal model to aid the control loop design. Both simulation and experimental results are presented that are in agreement with the theoretical analysis and complement the work. Index Terms—AC–DC power conversion, filtering, power sup-plies.
