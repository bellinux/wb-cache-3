40|$|International audienceAn {{observatory}} {{of urban}} pollutants {{was created in}} Paris {{for the purpose of}} assessing the dynamics of wastewater and wet weather flow (WW and WWF) pollutant loads within combined sewers. This observatory is composed of six urban catchments, covering land areas ranging in size from 42  ha to 2581  ha. For a wide array of parameters including total suspended solids (TSS), chemical and biochemical oxygen demand (COD and BOD(5)), total organic carbon (TOC), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), heavy metals (Cu and Zn) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), this article is intended to evaluate the contributions of wastewater, runoff and in-sewer processes to WWF pollutant loads through the use of an entry-exit mass balance approach. To achieve this objective, a total of 16 rain events were sampled on these sites between May 2003 and February 2006. This study has confirmed that at the considered catchment scale (i. e. from 42  ha to 2581  ha) the production and transfer processes associated with WWF pollutant loads do not vary with basin scale. Entry-exit chemical mass balances over all catchments and for a large number of rain events indicate that wastewater constitutes the main source of organic and nitrogenous pollution, while runoff is the predominant source of Zn. For Cu, PAHs and TSS, the calculation underscores the major role played by in-sewer processes, specifically by sediment erosion, as a source of WWF pollution. A significant loss of dissolved metals was also observed during their transfer within the sewer network, likely {{as a consequence of the}} adsorption of dissolved metals on TSS and/or on sewer deposits. Moreover, the nature of eroded particles was examined and compared to the various sewer deposits. This comparison has highlighted that such particles exhibit similar organic and PAH contents to those measured in the organic layer, thus suggesting that the deposit eroded during a wet weather period is organic and of a nature comparable to the organic layer. Despite the extent of initial field investigations, no <b>organic</b> <b>deposit</b> was observed to be present on sewer lines within the catchments, which implies that this <b>organic</b> <b>deposit</b> is probably present in another form or to be found elsewhere in the main trunks...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePalaeozoic and Mesozoic {{cephalopod}} conchs occasionally reveal dark organic coatings at the aperture. A {{number of}} these coatings, including still unrecorded examples, are described, figured and interpreted herein. On the basis of elemental analysis, actualistic comparison and a comparison with Triassic bivalves, some of these coatings are shown to consist of apatite and primarily probably of conchiolin (and also probably melanin). In several Mesozoic ammonoid genera such as Paranannites, Psiloceras, Lytoceras, Phylloceras, Harpoceras and Chondroceras, some of these coatings (recorded herein for most of these taxa for the first time) are interpreted as a structure similar to the black band, which was previously known only from Recent Allonautilus and Nautilus. In contrast to these nautilid genera, however, the organic material of some Mesozoic ammonoids was not deposited {{on the inside of}} the shell but externally, albeit positioned at the terminal aperture as in Recent nautilids. Some ammonoids of Carboniferous and Triassic age show several such bands at more or less regular angular distances on the ultimate whorls and at the aperture, e. g. Nomismoceras, Gatherites, Owenites, Paranannites, Juvenites and Melagathiceratidae gen. et sp. nov. Triassic material from Oman shows that the black coating was probably secreted from the inside, because the position of this <b>organic</b> <b>deposit</b> changes from interior to exterior in an anterior direction (i. e. adaperturally). This structure has previously been referred to as a ‘false colour pattern' and is here interpreted as having been formed at an interim aperture or megastria (‘alter Mundrand').

40|$|Pterogobius elapoides (GÜNTHER) {{is a small}} Gobiid fish, some 80 mm {{in total}} length, with a {{polymorphic}} black band {{at the base of}} caudal fin (Plate XVI, Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4). It is distributed in Japan throughout, and lives individually a semi-pelagic life in bottom waters of rocky shore. It feeds on copepods, <b>organic</b> <b>deposit</b> and sea-weeds omnivorosly. A pair of this Gobiid fish, reared in the Shimonoseki Aquarium, spawnd four times during from October 6 th to November 30 th, 1957 (Plate XVI, Fig. 6; Table 1). The authors observed the spawning behaviour and detected three phases of it as followings: (1) Pre-spawning behaviour, (2) Spawning behaviour, and (3) Post-spawning behaviour (Plate XVI, Figs, 1, 2, 3). (1) Pre-spawning behaviour. The ripe male, 98 mm in total length, with black nuptial colour-ation enters into the shell set for artifical breeding-room and takes out a territory in its vicinity. Then the male leads the ripe female, 107 mm in total lenght, with black nuptial colouration into the shell. A pair of the fish nest in the shell during from one day to two days period preceding spawning. This nesting-behaviour is a important phase of the spawning. (2) Spawning behaviour. After the nesting, the oviposition and fertilization take place alternately. The duration of every oviposition and fertilization is about thirty seconds. This behaviour-phase lasts as long as about one hour. (3) Post-spawning behaviour. The female parent leaves the nest soon after spawning, while the male guards over the egg-mass in the nest. The number of the eggs of every spawning was enumerated as about 1, 800.

40|$|Marine {{biofouling}} is {{a global}} problem with {{a negative impact on}} several industrial and maritime branches, causing immense costs. Alongside with the economic consequences of colonization of surfaces, the environmental aspects should not be underestimated. Because of the predominant use of heavy-metal based antifouling coatings in the last decades, the most prominent component of which is tributyltin, TBT, several unacceptable environmental `side effects' on non-targeted species have emerged. This led to a global ban of the use of TBT-containing coatings in 2008. Since then, the research efforts focus on the development of surfaces which solely rely on physicochemical properties to mitigate the undesired accumulation of biomass. For identification of surface properties which influence and guide settlement, {{a better understanding of the}} colonization mechanisms of the target organisms is required. The purpose of this work was the investigation of the exploratory behaviour of barnacle larvae (cyprids) of Balanus amphitrite. This species was selected because it is widely spread in several geographic regions and contributes significantly to biofouling pressure. To enable the extraction of three-dimensional swimming trajectories, a stereoscopic setup was developed. It was utilized to quantify the pre-settlement behaviour of cyprids on surfaces with different wettability, hydration or charge. The analysis of the data allowed the identification of basic reoccurring patterns in the motion of cyprids, i. e. spiraling, swimming, sinking, rotating and walking. A detailed evaluation of the distribution of these patterns revealed that swimming was most frequently observed, followed by sinking which seemed to be its counterpart. Furthermore, it could be shown that most surface contacts emerged after sinking, while an active swimming towards the substrate was seldom observed. In addition, the general distribution of cyprids in the water column demonstrated that there was a clear preference for interfacial regions, and that the main occurrence of cyprids concentrated in three distinct zones above surfaces - the lower, bulk and upper swimming region, denoting the distance of the larvae from the substrate. It was revealed that the settlement preferences of cyprids were reflected in the motility parameters of exploration, i. e. linearity of the locomotion, mean velocity, swimming depth and extent of explored area. Once on a surface, cyprids initiate a close surface inspection, involving bipedal walking. The quantification of this mode of movement showed that the step duration and step velocity correlated with the attractiveness of the surface for settlement. Moreover, an analysis of the complete exploration process - from swimming via close surface inspection to interface interactions, confirmed literature reports that the number of surface touchdowns and the amount of <b>organic</b> <b>deposit</b> left behind were guided by the attractiveness of the substrate for biofouling. In addition to this <b>organic</b> <b>deposit,</b> macromolecules and other compounds accumulate on surfaces, immediately after these have been placed in an aquatic environment. The influence of this `conditioning' film on the exploratory behaviour was investigated and it was proven to cover the initial chemical end groups of different substrates. This masking process provoked cyprids to explore non-attractive conditioned surfaces in the same manner as attractive ones. Except on model surfaces, the exploratory behaviour was also investigated on commercially available hydrogel-based coatings and it was found that the motility of cyprids started to decrease gradually immediately after surface contact and after 4 h it completely stopped, which was contributed to mortality of the organisms caused by the paints. Finally, the stereoscopic setup was modified to allow measurements in situ, underwater. The results of the field experiments at two test sites are discussed with respect to the applicability of the system for measurements in the natural environment and its capability to reveal colonization dynamics of marine organisms. ...|$|E
40|$|Holocene {{records of}} climate change {{can be derived from}} organic rich sediments such as peats (with organic {{contents}} > 99 %) and gyttja rich lake sediments. While the performance of the Itrax is generally negatively affected by higher organic matter contents, we are currently developing two separate Itrax applications for such sediments. Tephras {{are an important part of}} establishing good chronologies for Holocene sequences. Tephras can vary in thickness from a few centimeters to a few shards thick. Finding crypotephra (i. e., those tephra not visible to the naked eye) is a time consuming process involving tedious sub-sampling and density separations. In order to improve the efficiency of tephra extraction we are developing a method to ‘screen’ sediment cores for tephra. Using small step sizes (< 1 mm), we identify areas where changes in the sample matrix (signaled through changes in the mean standard error) and elemental chemistry suggest the possible presence of tephra. These ‘target depths’ are then sub-sampled at a higher resolution (1 cm vs. 5 cm) for tephra extraction. To date we have tested three different sites and shard counts made at target depths shows that the Itrax can successfully locate both rhyolitic and basaltic tephra layers. In those cores with visible tephra, we are also testing the possibility of using major element concentrations from Itrax scans to make preliminary identifications of tephra layers through their elemental fingerprints. The Itrax generated plots are tested for accuracy by comparing them against conventional electron microprobe analyses of traditionally extracted tephra shards. Humification analyses reflect the level of decomposition of an <b>organic</b> <b>deposit</b> which in itself signals changes in evaporation/precipitation and temperature regimes, and by extension, paleo-climate.

40|$|Two field {{investigations}} were {{undertaken to}} study the role of water table management in reducing herbicide pollution of ground water. One of the three-year studies (1992 - 1995) was conducted in a sandy field near Joliette (Laurin farm), (Quebec) to monitor the herbicide metribuzin where potatoes were grown. Two water table management systems were evaluated, namely subsurface drainage and subirrigation. Soil and ground water samples were taken at two week intervals, once before and six times after the herbicide application. The amount of rainfall received {{in the first few}} weeks following herbicide application is crucial in assessing the extent of ground water contamination. In 1992, fewer rainfall events occurred after the application as compared to 1993, so metribuzin leached slowly. In 1992, it appears that subirrigation reduced ground water contamination by a factor of 10 through enhanced degradation and the greater effect of dilution. However, the role of subirrigation in reducing the metribuzin contamination of ground water was negligible in 1993 due to considerable leaching soon after the application. The second project was conducted in an organic soil in St-Patrice-de-Sherrington (Van Winden farm) where the herbicide prometryn was studied. Surface irrigation with a controlled water table was also used as a water table management system. One experimental unit was used {{for each of the three}} treatments (subirrigation, surface irrigation and subsurface drainage). The herbicide application rate was greater at the Van Winden farm than in the Laurin farm (5. 5 kg/ha versus 1. 0 kg/ha). However, a higher adsorption coefficient of the organic soil minimized the leaching process. Ground water contamination was less extensive in the <b>organic</b> <b>deposit.</b> The effect of subirrigation in reducing ground water contamination was significant when the water table was shallow.

DOI of original article: [URL] audienceOrganic matter and living micro-organisms are responsible for surface modifications of any materials immersed in seawater. This phenomenon, called biofouling, has many detrimental effects and has to be prevented. Electrochemistry could be a very efficient tool for biofouling prevention in two ways, either by local biocide production through seawater electrolysis or by immobilizing electrogenerated biocides. In this paper, both strategies will be developed and illustrated in the particular case of tin dioxide as anode material. Chloride and bromide ions present in seawater are efficiently oxidized at antimony doped tin dioxide to form biocidal hypohalogenous acids, namely HOCl and HOBr. Underwater optical instruments having glass window coated with a transparent tin dioxide layer can be effectively protected against biofouling without environmental damages because hypohalogenous acids are produced at a low level and on the window itself. Another possibility explored in this paper is to perform a pre-treatment of the surface to be protected. It consists in seawater electrolysis in the presence of organic macromolecules, as for instance bovine serum albumin. In these conditions, chlorinated and brominated <b>organic</b> <b>deposit</b> is formed on the tin oxide surface as proved by EDX and XPS analyses. By testing adhesion and growth of Escherichia coli bacteria, it was shown that this deposit possesses biocidal property.
