5|$|Teuruarii's reign was {{disrupted}} by ongoing French expansionism in the Pacific. Teuruarii entreated the British to place Rurutu under a British protectorate, which the islanders deemed more favorable {{due to their}} predominant adherence to Protestantantism. These efforts failed and Rurutu was proclaimed a protectorate of the French Third Republic on 27 March 1889. Teuruarii was allowed to continue ruling as king until the annexation of the island to the territory of French Oceania in 1900, today part of the <b>overseas</b> <b>country</b> of French Polynesia. Living out {{the remainder of his}} life as a village chief, Teuruarii left many descendants who would have a strong influence in the islands to the modern day.|$|E
5|$|Barnes went to England in the Australian {{winter of}} 1947. In his autobiography, {{he claimed to}} have gone as a {{representative}} for an alcohol company, although appears to have dealt in commodities that were in short supply due to rationing. Once in England, he was approached by Burnley to play as a professional in Lancashire League cricket, which he did briefly before becoming disinterested and resigning. Barnes returned to Australia for the 1947–48 season, keen to win a place on the 1948 tour to England. He was worried that having played as a professional in the Lancashire League would damage his chance of further Test cricket, as the Australian authorities frowned on those who played professionally in England. There was also concern that, with his wife now living in Scotland, he would breach the Australian Board of Control's rule that wives were not allowed to travel with players, by being in the same <b>overseas</b> <b>country.</b>|$|E

The Commonwealth of Nations listed the islands as a British Overseas Territory in their 2012 yearbook.

25|$|By {{the end of}} the 16th century, the Japanese mission {{had become}} the largest {{overseas}} Christian community that was not under the rule of a European power. Its uniqueness was emphasized by Alessandro Valignano since 1582, who promoted a deeper accommodation of Japanese culture. Japan was then the sole <b>overseas</b> <b>country</b> in which all members of those confraternities were locals, {{as was the case with}} Christian missions in Mexico, Peru, Brazil, the Philippines, or India, in spite of the presence of a colonial elite.|$|E
25|$|A new {{provision}} in the Treaty of Lisbon is that the status of French, Dutch and Danish overseas territories can be changed more easily, by no longer requiring a full treaty revision. Instead, the European Council may, on the initiative of the member state concerned, change the status of an <b>overseas</b> <b>country</b> or territory (OCT) to an outermost region (OMR) or vice versa.

2500|$|French Polynesia {{was also}} {{reinstated}} {{on the list}} on 17 May 2013, in somewhat contentious circumstances. Having been re-elected President of French Polynesia in 2011 (the territory being largely self-governing), Oscar Temaru asked {{for it to be}} re-inscribed on the list; it had been removed in 1947. (French Polynesia is categorised by France as an <b>overseas</b> <b>country,</b> in recognition of its self-governing status.) On 5 May 2013, Temaru's Union for Democracy party lost the legislative election to Gaston Flosse's pro-autonomy but anti-independence Tahoera'a Huiraatira party. At this stage, the United Nations General Assembly was due to discuss French Polynesia's re-inscription on the list twelve days later, in accordance with a motion tabled by the Solomon Islands, Tuvalu and Nauru. On 16 May, the Assembly of French Polynesia, with its new anti-independence majority, adopted a motion asking the United Nations not to restore the country to the list. On 17 May, despite French Polynesia's opposition, and France's, the country was restored to the list of Non-Self-Governing Territories. Temaru was present for the vote, {{on the final day of}} his mandate as President. The United Nations affirmed [...] "the inalienable right of the people of French Polynesia to self-determination and independence".|$|E
