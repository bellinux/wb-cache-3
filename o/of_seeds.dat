5|$|A {{proposed}} 1993 {{treatment of}} T. apollinea as a subspecies of Tephrosia purpurea noted some regional variations, with {{plants in the}} Eastern Desert of Egypt possibly producing smaller pods, leaves, and leaflets, and plants from oases having densely pubescent spreading hairs. Among the features they described as differentiating the apollinea subspecies from the nominate purpurea subspecies were that apollinea has somewhat longer pods (3.55 or sometimes 5.5cm, rather than 34cm), a wider range in the quantity <b>of</b> <b>seeds</b> per pod (generally 79, as low as 3, rather than generally 56, or sometimes 7), the pods being curved upwards rather than downwards, and leaflets having 9 rather than 7 lateral veins.|$|E
