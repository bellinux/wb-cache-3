5|$|Some {{of those}} who have {{attempted}} to find an escape from the impulse to power have resorted to forms of quietism or pacifism. One major proponent of such approaches was the philosopher Laozi. From Russell's perspective, such views are incoherent, since they only deny themselves coercive power, but retain an interest in persuading others to their cause; and persuasion is a form <b>of</b> <b>power,</b> for Russell. Moreover, he argues that the love <b>of</b> <b>power</b> can actually be a good thing. For instance, if one feels a certain duty towards their neighbours, they may attempt to attain power to help those neighbours (Russell 1938:215–216). In sum, the focus of any policy should not be on a ban on kinds <b>of</b> <b>power,</b> but rather, on certain kinds of use <b>of</b> <b>power</b> (Russell 1938:221).|$|E

40|$|The {{separation}} <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> {{doctrine is}} well-known {{at the federal}} government level but this doctrine has had little impact at the state government level in Australia, especially Queensland. The problem is that Australian democracy is based on responsible government and the Westminster parliamentary system and {{is not based on}} the separation <b>of</b> <b>powers.</b> First, the paper provides a brief survey of the main writers on the doctrine of the separation <b>of</b> <b>powers.</b> Second, the paper looks at the case study of Queensland where the executive infringes on the functions of the legislature and the judiciary. Third, the paper looks at a new contribution to the SOP doctrine with a legislative or constitutional recognition of the separation <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> and also a Bill of Rights. Although there is no formal or constitutional separation <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> at the state level, there is an implied separation <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> in practice at the state level in Australia.

5000|$|The {{doctrine}} of the separation <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> in Australia divides the institutions of government into three branches: legislative, executive and judicial.

The {{doctrine of}} the separation <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> is often assumed {{to be one of}} the cornerstones of fair government.

40|$|Separation <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> is one <b>of</b> least {{understood}} doctrines in U. S. law and politics. Underlying a {{great deal}} <b>of</b> separation <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> analysis is the conventional view that the United States Constitution requires a strict separation between the three branches of government, and that efforts within one branch to influence or control the exercise <b>of</b> another branch’s <b>powers</b> are illegitimate and should be rejected whenever possible. Although its simplicity might be appealing, this image of strict separation is inconsistent with both the Framers’ understanding <b>of</b> separation <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> and with the law as developed by the Supreme Court {{in the face of}} the explosive growth of the regulatory state over more than a century. This Article articulates an inductive understanding <b>of</b> separation <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> as practiced under the United States Constitution, arrived at by examining case law and actual practice, not deduced from general principles or an ideal conception <b>of</b> separation <b>of</b> <b>powers.</b> Although the Supreme Court’s recent decision in Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board adverted to the Vesting Clause of Article II, the Vesting Clauses of the Constitution’s first three articles have not been particularly important to the resolution of actual disputes over the separation <b>of</b> <b>powers.</b> The Court does not decide separation <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> controversies by determining the nature <b>of</b> a <b>power</b> and then assigning it to the appropriate branch as specified in the Vesting Clauses. Using examples from across the spectrum <b>of</b> separation <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> controversies, this Article establishes that the basic principle <b>of</b> separation <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> under the United States Constitution involves strict enforcement of the Constitution’s structural and procedural requirements for action by each branch, but great flexibility and deference to Congress when ruling on whether a more general principle <b>of</b> separation <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> has been transgressed...|$|R
