25|$|After {{celebrating the}} birth of his son, the first child with Morgan Beck, Miller {{announced}} in October, that he would skip another season with the intention {{to spend more time with}} his family and to focus on his new-found passion of horse training. Even though some people started to suspect that this might mean the end of his skiing career, Miller denied it in December stating that although he would never do the full circuit again, there's a likelihood that he'd return to racing occasionally. He terminated his contract with HEAD early under the restriction to not compete with <b>other</b> <b>skis</b> than HEAD in the World Cup circuit or World Alpine Ski Championships. He was then able to sign a deal with US-based ski manufacturer Bomber Ski, which also made Miller the brand's part owner.|$|E
50|$|In {{the spring}} of 1993, a number of {{pre-production}} SCX skis were sent to instructors in the US for practical experimentation. They invariably reported dramatic results, with intermediate skiers able to produce carving turns easily, even in poor conditions that experts would normally find difficult. Realizing they had a winning design, the Elan team started designing a series aimed at the training market, including a 163 cm long design for the instructors, and a 143 cm long version for students and junior racers. This was much shorter than most skis of the era, further differentiating them from <b>other</b> <b>skis</b> on the market. These were being demonstrated across Europe and the US during December 1993.|$|E

50|$|An {{original}} dating using {{pollen analysis}} of pollen {{from the site}} suggested that the skis were 4000 years old, but later carbon dating has shown evidence that they are around 5200 years old, i.e. older than the pyramids of ancient Egypt. An analysis made in 1992 by the Forest Sciences faculty of the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences showed that the skis were made from pine that had grown in a slope, causing the wood to become denser than ordinary. This shows good craftmansship, since this type of wood has been favoured by ski makers in more recent times as well. Each ski had four holes for the bindings, which corresponds well with ancient skis found in Siberia, but not typical of <b>other</b> <b>skis</b> found in Scandinavia. The ski pole is similar to ski poles used in historic times by the Sami people in northern Scandinavia.|$|E
40|$|A tank {{investigation}} {{has been conducted}} on a 1 / 8 -size powered dynamic model of the Grumman JRF- 5 airplane equipped with twin hydro-skis. The results of tests using two types of skis are presented: one had vertical sides joining the top surface to the chine; the other had the top surface faired to the chine to eliminate the vertical sides. Both configurations had satisfactory longitudinal stability although the model had a slightly greater stable elevator range available when the skis without the vertical sides were attached. Free model tests indicated no instability present when one ski emerged before the other. Considerable excess thrust was available at all speeds with either type of skis. A hump gross load-resistance ratio of 3. 37 was obtained with the skis with the vertical sides and 3. 53 with the <b>other</b> <b>skis.</b> Landing behavior in smooth water with yaw up to 15 deg and roll up to 15 deg in opposite directions was satisfactory with either type of skis...|$|E
