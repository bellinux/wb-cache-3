2500|$|On {{the morning}} of the 20th of last month, in the choir, after I had celebrated Mass I yielded to a {{drowsiness}} similar to a sweet sleep. [...] I saw before me a mysterious person similar to the one I had seen on the evening of 5 August. The only difference was that his hands and feet and side were dripping blood. This sight terrified me and what I felt at that moment is indescribable. I thought I should have died if the Lord had not intervened and strengthened my heart which was about to burst out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>chest.</b> The vision disappeared and I became aware that my hands, feet and side were dripping blood. Imagine the agony I experienced and continue to experience almost every day. The heart wound bleeds continually, especially from Thursday evening until Saturday. Dear Father, I am dying of pain because of the wounds and the resulting embarrassment I feel deep in my soul. I am afraid I shall bleed to death if the Lord does not hear my heartfelt supplication to relieve me of this condition. Will Jesus, who is so good, grant me this grace? Will he at least free me from the embarrassment caused by these outward signs? I will raise my voice and will not stop imploring him until in his mercy he takes away, not the wound or the pain, which is impossible since I wish to be inebriated with pain, but these outward signs which cause me such embarrassment and unbearable humiliation....the pain was so intense that I began to feel as if I were dying on the cross.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{have got}} two pounds," [...] Arthur said. [...] "I {{took it out}} <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>chest</b> while the gale was going on. I thought if we were wrecked and did get to shore it might be useful." ...|$|E
60|$|Often I have lain thus {{when the}} fact, that if I laid much longer I would {{actually}} freeze to death, {{would come over}} me with such overpowering force as to break the icy spell, and starting to my feet, I would endeavour {{to go through the}} combined manual and pedal exercise to restore the circulation. The first fling <b>of</b> <b>my</b> benumbed arm generally struck me in the face, instead <b>of</b> smiting <b>my</b> <b>chest,</b> its true destination. But in these cases one's muscles have their own way.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then I ring all {{the bells}} in the house; and shout and swear and scream, [...] "Thieves!--thieves!--landlord!--murder!--fire!" [...] until the whole {{household}} come tumbling up the stairs. [...] "Where is my servant?" [...] roar I. [...] "Who dares to rob me in open day? Look at the villain whom I {{find in the}} act <b>of</b> breaking <b>my</b> <b>chest</b> open! Send for the police, send for his Excellency the Austrian Minister! all Europe shall know of this insult!" ...|$|R
6000|$|He now {{lowered his}} tone {{with an air}} of deeper cunning. [...] "I've made two wills, and I'm going to burn one. Now you do as I tell you. This is the key <b>of</b> <b>my</b> iron <b>chest,</b> in the closet there. You push well {{at the side of the}} brass plate at the top, till it goes like a bolt: then you can put the key in the front lock and turn it. See and do that; and take out the topmost paper--Last Will and Testament--big printed." ...|$|R
60|$|At {{this stage}} {{my body was}} all dead, so far as I was concerned, save my head and a little patch <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>chest.</b> No longer did the pound and smash of my {{compressed}} heart echo in my brain. My heart was beating steadily but feebly. The joy of it, had I dared joy at such a moment, {{would have been the}} cessation of sensations.|$|E
6000|$|Running {{into the}} bedroom as this fear beset me, I laid hold <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>chest</b> of drawers, dragged it into the passage, and threw it down against the door. On {{the top of that}} I heaped my father's big tool chest, three chairs, and a scuttleful of coals; and last, I dragged out the kitchen table and rammed it as hard as I could against the whole barricade. They heard me as they were coming up to the door with fresh stones. Jerry said: [...] "Stop a bit!" [...] and t hen the two {{consulted}} together in whispers. I listened eagerly, and just caught these words: ...|$|E
60|$|When {{consciousness}} returned, and, as I soon learned, I {{was down}} but a moment, I sprang quickly {{to my feet}} searching for my sword, and there I found it, buried to the hilt in the green breast of Zad, who lay stone dead upon the ochre moss of the ancient sea bottom. As I regained my full senses I found his weapon piercing my left breast, but only through the flesh and muscles which cover my ribs, entering near the center <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>chest</b> and coming out below the shoulder. As I had lunged I had turned so that his sword merely passed beneath the muscles, inflicting a painful but not dangerous wound.|$|E
6000|$|If ever a {{man went}} through a [...] "psychological moment" [...] in this hour I was that man. The {{struggle}} was short and sharp, but it ended {{as might be expected}} in the case <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>my</b> history and character. Could I have foreseen the dreadful issues which hung upon my decision, I believe that rather than speak it, {{for the second time in}} my life I would have sought the solace to be found in the phials <b>of</b> <b>my</b> medicine <b>chest.</b> But I did not foresee them, I thought only <b>of</b> myself, <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own hopes, fears and ambitions, forgetting that no man can live to himself alone, and that his every deed must act and re-act upon others until humanity ceases to exist.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you think, Diggory Beggs," [...] she asked, indignantly, [...] "that {{after all}} these years I do not know you as well as I do the {{contents}} <b>of</b> <b>my</b> linen <b>chest?</b> I have never before known you open your purse strings one inch wider than was necessary. Have I not always had to ask, until I am verily ashamed, before I can get a new gown for myself, or a decent cloak for the girls? You have ever been hard fisted with your money, and never disposed to spend a groat, save on good occasion. There is not the wife of a trader of your standing in Plymouth but makes a braver show than I do, when we walk on the hoe on holidays or feast days.|$|R
5000|$|Tuff's First Two Buck Offs. It was 1993 and Tuff {{was well}} on his way to a Hall of Fame career and earning his {{reputation}} as King of the Bull Riders. Simultaneously, Bodacious was gaining his reputation as an 1,800 pound master of disaster. [...] "The first time I had him was at a bull riding event in Memphis, Tennessee," [...] Hedeman said. [...] "He was unbelievable. When he left the chute his front end came up so high. I was right in the middle of him, and riding him like you have to ride a bull with a lot <b>of</b> downdraft. But <b>my</b> <b>chest</b> was touching his horns, and my head was right over the top of his. I couldn't keep my hand in the rope." ...|$|R
60|$|I was {{suddenly}} and rudely enlightened when I heard the twang of the bow, {{and saw the}} arrow flying straight towards me. It {{was too late to}} leap aside, or dodge it. Full on the centre <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>chest</b> the shaft struck me. I experienced something of the shock that one feels when death is suddenly and very unexpectedly brought near. I have a distinct recollection of the solemn impression made by the belief that my last hour had come, yet I did not fall. I saw that the savage was hastily fitting another arrow to the bow, but was so stunned by surprise that I made no effort to save myself. Happily Big Otter had his wits about him. He fired before the arrow winged its flight, and shot the Indian dead.|$|E
60|$|My dear Taylor--My {{chest is}} in such a nervous state, that {{anything}} extra, such as speaking to an unaccustomed person, or writing a note, half suffocates me. This journey to Italy wakes me at daylight every morning, and haunts me horribly. I shall endeavour to go, though it be with the sensation of marching up against a battery. The first step towards it is to know {{the expense of a}} journey and a year's residence, which if you will ascertain for me, and let me know early, you will greatly serve me. I have more to say, but must desist, for every line I write increases the tightness <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>chest,</b> and I have many more to do. I am convinced that this sort of thing does not continue for nothing. If you can come, with any of our friends, do.|$|E
5000|$|After silent {{pleading}} {{from his}} wife, Vorenus eventually accepts - and Caesar leads him outside his villa, and presents {{him to a}} crowd of cheering onlookers. In the commotion that ensues, Pullo finds himself further adrift, consoling himself with jugs of wine. Lost in a drunken stupor, he tells Eirene about his slave parents. [...] "I'll cut my fucking heart out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>chest</b> and eat it before I kneel to anybody." ...|$|E
60|$|I felt {{my senses}} reeling. My head was swimming, my eyes {{no longer could}} see distinctly. It seemed as if an {{unbearable}} pressure upon <b>my</b> <b>chest</b> would finally squeeze the last breath out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> body.|$|R
60|$|BENTLEY. [rising reluctantly] I {{promised you}} two inches more round <b>my</b> <b>chest</b> this summer. I tried {{exercises}} with an indiarubber expander; but I wasnt strong enough: instead <b>of</b> <b>my</b> expanding it, it crumpled me up. Come along, Johnny.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you couldn't {{have done}} better, {{if you had}} been {{officers}} in His Majesty's service," [...] the admiral said. [...] "You have saved me the loss <b>of</b> <b>my</b> two plate <b>chests,</b> <b>of</b> all the plate in this room--and that couldn't be counted in money, for they were most of the things given me, at different times, on service--and of 500 pounds I had in that box upstairs--altogether, at least 2000 pounds in money value. More than that, you prevented my being captured; {{and it would have been}} a sorer blow, to me, than the loss of the money, if those scoundrels had had their way, and had got off scot free.|$|R
5000|$|... "When I {{started working}} on the record, I tried to avoid it. The timing was just calling for me to not avoid all the shit {{that was going on}} out there. It was like a 10,000-ton gorilla in the room {{watching}} me. This is the way I got it off <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>chest.</b> This album talks about life, love and money. It talks about the fact that marriage is expensive. Life Is Good represents the most beautiful, dramatic and heavy moments in my life." ...|$|E
5000|$|I am {{thirteen}} {{years old and}} for this age I am, as one can see, neither very tall nor small. My figure is slender, the colour of my skin brown, my face rather pale, my hair chestnut and soft, my eyes black, my nose rather bent. I will not say much <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>chest,</b> which to be true, is not very big. I have a pair of long and thin legs, and two feet, not minor size. From all this, one can understand, that physically, I am an average young man ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{the fall}} of 2011, Schaufler was accused of groping a woman's breast at an AFL-CIO {{convention}} held in Eugene, Oregon. The incident was publicized in Oregon's premier newspaper, The Oregonian, and Schaufler's behavior {{was referred to as}} [...] "highly inappropriate" [...] by the State Labor Commissioner Brad Avakian. Shaufler later denied the incident by written statement, explaining, [...] "A campaign worker and colleague of mine stuck a campaign sticker on my chest without my permission. I reacted by taking the sticker off <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>chest</b> and sticking it on her chest." [...] Schaufler further described the incident as [...] "innocent horseplay" [...] and a [...] "knee-jerk response." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Gone!" [...] ejaculated {{from the}} depths <b>of</b> his <b>chest</b> <b>my</b> bowman in a final tone. He spat in his hands, and took a better grip on his oar. The captain of the brig lowered his rigid arm slowly, and looked at our faces in a solemnly {{conscious}} silence, which called upon us to share in his simple-minded, marvelling awe. All at once he sat down by my side, and leaned forward earnestly at my boat's crew, who, swinging together in a long, easy stroke, kept their eyes fixed upon him faithfully.|$|R
6000|$|... 'As to the wedding, all I ask, Louisa, is, - and I ask {{it with a}} {{fluttering}} in <b>my</b> <b>chest,</b> {{which actually}} extends to the soles <b>of</b> <b>my</b> feet, - that it may take place soon.

60|$|I {{could not}} help feeling for a certain half of a sixpence that you have heard me speak of; and putting my hand {{mechanically}} upon <b>my</b> <b>chest,</b> I tore <b>my</b> fingers with the point <b>of</b> <b>my</b> new DIAMOND-PIN. Mr. Polonius had sent it home the night before, and I sported {{it for the first}} time at Roundhand's to dinner.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the same}} way, the Spanish poet, Antonio Gamoneda writes: [...] "Mohammed Bennis, strange angel who enters in my veins and flows in them like {{the waters of}} the instants and you ignite the {{friendship}} of light: take me with you to the gardens of the dead, to the place of palms glimpsed between two fugitive abysses. Enter the hole <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>chest</b> and show me the gift of the void incandescent and the pupils of animals conceived in crying, those who come to the doors of intoxication to inject us with the passion of light, that substance which birds cross and makes us crazy in the happiness of the sweet contemplation of death." ...|$|E
5000|$|Cameron's brother {{passed away}} {{at a young age}} at 31, and Cameron himself {{believed}} {{that he was going to}} die young like his brother due to heart complications and several heart problems. In an interview, he told The Sun newspaper that [...] "I woke up during the night thinking I was having a heart attack. I was having so much pain from the middle <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>chest</b> it felt like someone was sitting on me. It’s the first time I’ve ever been an emergency admission and I have never been so scared in all my life". Cameron went onto say that he “genuinely thought I was going to die that night. The pain just got worse and worse and worse".|$|E
5000|$|In September 2010, McCloud {{began work}} on a new {{collection}} of songs. Recording at Seventh Wave Studios in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania with record producer Jason Rubal (The Dresden Dolls), these songs would become the record known as Painful Words Of Loving Grace. [...] "The title just describes what the record is about. As many great times that I have had since the last record, {{there have been some}} pretty rough times, as well as things that I decided I wanted to get off <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>chest.</b> My last record was sort of this grand, majestic love story and when it was done, I was and am proud of it, but the last thing I wanted to do was go make “Romance Of The Atlantic: part II… I wanted to make something a little closer to what I had been feeling and thinking about. I wanted to have a sound that was a little more raw and stripped down, sort of dirty and pretty at the same time. The things I am talking about are things that I don’t really tell anyone, or things that are hard to say. This is a record of loss, uncertainty, beauty, decadence… it’s all there." ...|$|E

40|$|A 63 -year-old female {{presented}} to the emergency department with complaints of her “heart beating out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>chest,</b> ” palpitations, and shortness of breath. She was three months postoperative a # 23 Edwards Sapien Transapical Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR). On exam she was surprisingly comfortable in appearance with an easily visible pulsatile mass on her left anterior chest. A computed tomography revealed a large, high density collection extending from {{the apex of the}} left ventricle through the left anterior fifth-sixth intercostal space into the left anterior chest wall (Figure). The pseudoaneurysm measured approximately 9. 7 cm by 6. 5 cm. The heart appeared mildly enlarged and a percutaneously placed aortic valve was noted. There was atherosclerotic calcification in the coronary arteries and thoracic aorta. No pleural or pericardial effusion was present...|$|E
40|$|This morning I sat in two {{inner city}} middle school {{classrooms}} in Indianapolis as I do most weeks. But something struck me {{deeply in the}} center <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>chest</b> as I was observing the boredom and apathy in the detached, sleepy and seemingly sad faces {{of many of these}} seventh grade students. The teachers were cheerfully present, the standards were posted, the paperwork was almost completed, there were no overt disruptions, and compliance was at hand. The procedures, rules and transitions were hard-wired into the brains of these middle school students and adults, but an 2 ̆ 2 inner 2 ̆ 2 inspiration and deep subconscious yearning for something else attached to the notion of the 2 ̆ 2 purpose of school 2 ̆ 2 were nowhere to be found...|$|E
60|$|It {{was really}} an offence to me when the {{jacketing}} ceased. I sadly missed that dream world of mine. But not for long. I found that I could suspend animation by the exercise <b>of</b> <b>my</b> will, aided mechanically by constricting <b>my</b> <b>chest</b> and abdomen with the blanket. Thus I induced physiological and psychological states similar to those caused by the jacket. So, at will, and without the old torment, I was free to roam through time.|$|R
