40|$|Peripheral {{arterial}} disease (PAD) is {{an indicator}} of widespread atherosclerosis. However, most individuals with PAD, in spite of being at high cardiovascular risk, are asymptomatic. This fact, together with {{the limitations of the}} Doppler ankle-brachial index (ABI), contributes to PAD underdiagnose. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare oscillometric ABI and Doppler ABI to diagnose peripheral arterial disease, and also to examine the influence of oscillometric errors and calcified legs on the PAD diagnoses. We measured the ankle-brachial indexes of 90 volunteers (n = 180 legs, age 70 ± 14 years, 43 % diabetics) using both <b>oscillometer</b> OMRON-M 3 and Doppler. For concordance analyses we used the Bland and Altman method, and also estimated the intraclass correlation coefficient. Receiver Operating Characteristic Curves were used to examine the diagnostic performance of both methods. The ABI means were 1. 06 ± 0. 14 and 1. 04 ± 0. 16 (p = 0. 034) measured by <b>oscillometer</b> and Doppler ABIs respectively, with limits of agreement of ± 0. 20 and intraclass correlation coefficient = 0. 769. <b>Oscillometer</b> yielded 23 "error" measurements, and also overestimated the measurements in low ankle pressures. Using Doppler as gold standard, <b>oscillometer</b> performance for diagnosis of PAD showed an Area Under Curve = 0. 944 (sensitivity: 66. 7 %, specificity: 96. 8 %). Moreover, when considered calcified legs and oscillometric "error" readings as arteriopathy equivalents, sensitivity rose to 78. 2 %, maintaining specificity in 96 %. The best <b>oscillometer</b> cut-off point was 0. 96 (sensitivity: 87 %, specificity: 91 %, positive likelihood ratio: 9. 66 and negative likelihood ratio: 0. 14). Despite its limitations, oscillometric ABI could be a useful tool for the diagnosis of PAD, particularly when considering calcified legs and oscillometric "errors" readings as peripheral arterial disease equivalents...|$|E

40|$|Purpose : To {{validate}} the Dinamap ProCare 200 blood pressure (BP) monitor against a mercury sphygmomanometer in children 7 to 18 {{years old in}} accordance with the 2010 International Protocol of European Society of Hypertension (ESH-IP 2) and the British Hypertension Society (BHS) protocol. Methods : Forty-five children were recruited for the study. A validation procedure was performed following the protocol based on the ESHIP 2 and BHS protocols for children and adolescents. Each subject underwent 7 sequential BP measurements alternatively with a mercury sphygmomanometer and the test device by trained nurses. The results were analyzed according to the validation criteria of ESH-IP 2. Results : The mean (¡?#?D);difference in the absolute BP values between test device and mercury sphygmomanometer readings was 1. 85 ¡?#?. 65; mmHg for systolic BP (SBP) and 4. 41 ¡?#?. 53; mmHg for diastolic BP (DBP). These results fulfilled the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation criterion of a mean¡?#?D b;elow 5 ¡?#? mm;Hg for both SBP and DBP. The percentages of test device-observer mercury sphygmomanometer BP differences within 5, 10, and 15 mmHg were 96 &# 37;, 100 &# 37;, and 100 &# 37; for SBP, and 69 &# 37;, 92 &# 37;, and 100 &# 37; for DBP, respectively, in the part 1 analysis&# 59; both SBP and DBP passed the part 1 criteria. In the part 2 analysis, SBP passed the criteria but DBP failed. Conclusion : Although the Dinamap ProCare 200 BP monitor failed an adapted ESH-IP 2, SBP passed. When comparing BP readings measured by <b>oscillometers</b> and mercury sphygmomanometers, one has to consider the differences between them, particularly in DBP, because DBP can be underestimated...|$|R

40|$|AIM: The aim of {{the paper}} is to verify the {{existence}} of an inverse correlation between birth weight and blood pressure (BP) in neonates, infants and adolescents. METHODS: BP was measured at 7 days, 3, 6, 9, 12 months and 7 - 18 years in 432 subjects born at term at the Department of Pediatrics, Obstetrics and Reproductive Medicine, University of Siena; 228 of these subjects were small for gestational age (SGA) and 204 appropriate for gestational age (AGA). For small babies, BP was measured with a DYNAMAP <b>oscillometer</b> which provides digital visualisation of systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressure and heart rate. In older children, a mercury sphygmomanometer was used. Statistical analysis was carried out with SPSS 8. 01 software using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for normality of populations. RESULTS: Statistical analysis did not reveal any significant differences between SGA and AGA subjects in the various age classes of the first 12 months of life. Significant correlation was found between 7 and 18 years with differences in the various age classes for systolic pressure. Subjects with normal birthweight had lower systolic and diastolic BP. SGA males had higher risk of high systolic and diastolic pressure, whereas SGA females were only at higher risk for elevated diastolic pressure. CONCLUSIONS: SGA subjects should be monitored for BP and life-style between 7 and 18 years to risk of cardiovascular disease...|$|E
40|$|Dr. A. M. Elseed {{and colleagues}} (Archives, 1973, 48, 932) {{referred}} to 4 methods of indirect measurement of blood pressure: palpation, auscultation, flush, and Doppler. May I {{draw your attention}} to a fifth method which will measure systolic and diastolic blood pressure with reproducible results, even in very small infants-oscillometry. This method was first used by Mlle. L. Koessler (1912). By using a Pachon <b>oscillometer,</b> measurements were improved and used extensively by Balard (1912 a, b, 1913), including observations on newboms in {{the first day of}} life. Using a similar instrument with a specially designed double chamber cuff, originally designed by Gallavardin (1922), I did measurements on term and premature infants (Kafka, 1967). Nelson (1968) designed an electronic oscillo-meter which could be used with the commercially available single chamber cuff. This instrument has proved to be very effective, as shown in a study con-ducted by Dr. Oh and myself (Kafka and Oh 1971). The oscillometric method for indirect blood pressure measurements has obvious advantages. (1) It measures systolic and diastolic blood pressure. (2) Reliable and reproducible measurements can be taken on the upper {{as well as on the}} lower limb. (3) Measurements can be taken in very small infants. (4) The method will still be usable in conditions where blood pressure drops to low levels as in shock-like states or where there are low diastolic values due to shunts or low systolic measurements as in coarctation. The rounding off of figures of blood pressure values widely used in clinical medicine is not acceptable for statistical studies, according to Armitage and Rose (1966) ...|$|E
40|$|Goldblatt 3 has {{described}} the visceral arteriolar necroses and hemorrhages occurring in association with hypertension and azotemia after constriction of the renal arteries in dogs. In rabbits with induced hypertension, Wilson and Pickering 8 have found similar lesions. These authors have mentioned {{the presence of an}} occasional intramural hemorrhage in the smaller vessels. In a series of dogs, prepared after the same fashion in this laboratory, these observations have been confirmed, and numerous hemorrhagic lesions of the larger vessels also have been noted. This paper will describe the latter lesions and include a few examples of similar change encountered in a preliminary survey of materials from patients whose clinical story suggested such a possibility. A series of young, healthy dogs was subjected to various procedures designed to reduce blood flow through the kidneys. Blood pressures were followed by means of an adaptation of the Friedman <b>oscillometer</b> 2 ' 7 and non-protein nitrogen determinations were made on the blood. The material upon which this paper is based was obtained from a group of animals surviving renal artery constriction for from three to eight days, and which showed, postoperatively, marked hypertension and progressive nitrogen retention. At autopsy a varying number of gross vascular lesions were consistently present, as were the visceral hemorrhages described by Goldblatt. The most constant site of the former was the main trunk of the pulmonary artery. The aortic arch and its branches and the thoracic aorta frequently showed numerous lesions. In the great veins hemorrhages occurred most frequently in the proximal portions of the superior and inferior venae cavae. Extensive subendocardial and myocardial hemorrhages were present, especially in the left ventricle 3 as were also more minute focal hemorrhages of the valve leaflets. Grossly, the vascular lesions from the adventitial side appeare...|$|E
40|$|Low {{viscosity}} methyl cellulose, as {{has been}} shown, localizes selectively and {{to a large extent}} in the tufts of the renal glomeruli. Their capillaries become greatly distended with accumulated colloid in their lumina. Neither the endothelial nor the epithelial cells seem to contain the material. An occasional tuft undergoes necrosis with the escape of blood into the capsular space and connecting tubule. Secondary degenerative changes of both distal and proximal convoluted tubules include swelling, vacuolization, and rarely necrosis. ' All of these morbid processes follow single intravenous injections of small quantities-as little as 5 cc. -for several successive days with a dog of average size. The clinical course is marked by progressive diminution of albumin-laden urine containing many casts and both white and red blood cells. The non-protein nitrogen of the blood rises sharply to 200 mg. 7 % or more but there is no corresponding elevation in blood pressure. This ranges between 140 and 160 and rarely attains a 180 mm. Hg level. Death follows in from 4 to 13 days-and generalized necrotizing vascular disease is found in about 25 per cent of the animals. By grading the dose and spacing the injections, it has been possible to convert this acute picture into the subacute and more chronic forms, to be described in this communication. Materials and methods Dogs were the animals of choice. The methyl cellulose employed was a 2 per cent solution of the low viscosity (1 5 centipoises) variety. It was injected intravenously in amounts ranging from S to 20 cc. at intervals suggested by the clinical and laboratory findings. These included the animal's general appearance, its food and water intake, the daily quantity of urine and its character, the blood pressure as determined by the Friedman <b>oscillometer,</b> and especially the non-protein nitrogen level of the blood. In the attempt to keep this between 80 and 120 mg. % animals were found to fall into two groups. In one it was necessary to use large...|$|E
40|$|As {{arterial}} hypertension can be diagnosed by different methods, among {{which are the}} traditional auscultatory instrument and the automated oscillometric monitor, {{the aim of this}} study was to compare the performance of these instruments, to evaluate the reliability of the digital <b>oscillometer.</b> The sample consisted of 40 patients under dental treatment, whose blood pressure measurements were recorded. The measurements of systolic and diastolic blood pressures were evaluated in terms of their intraclass correlation coefficients (r). For systolic blood pressure, an excellent level of agreement was found between the instruments, with r= 0. 93, and for diastolic blood pressure, there was a good level of agreement (r= 0. 75). It was concluded, from the excellent agreement for systolic blood pressure, that the oscillometric monitor can be recommended for the monitoring of the variations of that pressure in the same individual, while the good agreement obtained in the determination of the diastolic blood pressure indicates that the oscillometric method is reliable. However, new studies need to be carried out for a better understanding of the disagreements that can occur in the diastolic pressure results. Como o diagnóstico da hipertensão arterial é feito por métodos diversos, sendo o mais tradicional o auscultatório e, o mais recente, o oscilométrico (digital), a proposta do presente trabalho foi comparar esses dois métodos. Para isso, tomou-se uma amostra de 40 pacientes em tratamento odontológico, para os quais foram obtidas as medidas de pressão arterial, segundo esses dois métodos. Para os valores de pressão arterial obtidos, aplicou-se o coeficiente de correlação intra- classe (r). Os métodos mostraram excelente concordância para pressão arterial sistólica (r= 0, 93) e boa concordância para a pressão arterial diastólica (r= 0, 75). Concluiu-se, pelo excelente nível de concordância para pressão arterial sistólica, que o uso do aparelho digital pode ser recomendado para o acompanhamento das variações dessa pressão em um mesmo indivíduo. Já a concordância boa, obtida na determinação da pressão arterial diastólica, permite concluir que o aparelho digital é confiável, porém novos estudos precisariam ser realizados para uma melhor compreensão das discordâncias que ocorrerem na aferição dessa pressão...|$|E
40|$|Purpose of the study. The bipolar {{prosthesis}} {{was developed}} {{in an attempt to}} alleviate acetabular wear of conventional metallic endoprostheses. The prosthesis was designed to achieve low-friction metal-on-polyethylene inner bearing motion while decreasing shear stress across the acetabular cartilage. Although good clinical results were obtained, the principle of a persistent inner mobility was contested and some authors have assigned the delay of cartilage erosion to the shock absorption capacity of the polyethylene. The present study was focused on assessing the vibration and shock damping effect of metal monoblock and bipolar head prostheses. Material and methods. The transmission of the shock wave through these two types of prostheses was studied in vitro. The two heads were first tested in a rigid environment to eliminate all external parasite frequencies. The impact excitation was applied with a hammer connected to an <b>oscillometer.</b> A second accelerometer was connected to the prosthesis stem. Shock wave transmission was analyzed. Secondly, the head was tested with a system vibrating in the same order of frequencies as the skeleton, with and without pre-constraint. The frequency response functions were analyzed. Results. For the metallic prosthesis, the frequency of vibration recorded on the femoral stems was in a large frequency range from 0 Hz to 10 KHz. For the bipolar prosthesis, all the high frequencies of the shock wave were eliminated and only shock wave frequencies from 0 to 500 Hz were recorded. In an environmental system vibrating below 100 Hz, the metallic head did not express high frequencies of vibration. The coefficient of shock absorption was not significantly different for the two heads. Discussion. In the first rigid environment, the metallic head did not filter the high frequency components of the shock wave and the bipolar head tended to eliminate high frequency components due to the flattening effect of the impulse load by the polymer. But, the lower leg is not a rigid structure and the musculo-skeletal system vibrates in frequencies below 100 Hz. In similar conditions, the increased shock-absorbing effect of the polyethylene is far more difficult to observe. For the metallic prosthesis, the recorded frequency of vibration also belongs to a small domain of frequency, from 0 Hz to 100 Hz. The range of frequency is similar for the two types of prostheses. Conclusion. Even though polyethylene is characterized by a more pronounced damping capacity than metallic materials, in experimental conditions simulating the vibratory characteristics of the human body, the introduction of a high-density polyethylene liner does not afford any additional shock-absorbing effect compared with a metallic head. It cannot explain cartilaginous sparing. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
