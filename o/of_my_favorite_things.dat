Speaking with talk show host Oprah Winfrey, Rhimes said: [...] "Cristina was second, simply because she's {{the kind of woman}} I know really well, and I like her. There's something interesting about a person who is that driven, a little bit emotionally disconnected but still a caring, sweet, and smart individual you could be friends with." [...] Sandra Oh, initially auditioned for the character of Bailey, adding: [...] "Thank God I did not get that part", explaining the show would not be the same without fellow cast member, Wilson. Discussing casting Oh as Yang, Rhimes said: [...] "She brought this energy that felt very fresh. From the beginning, I've been shaping Cristina around Sandra a little bit. One <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> <b>things</b> to do is take as much of her dialogue out of a scene as possible because she does so much nonverbally. Then I just watch what she manages to do without having a word to say." ...|$|E

So, we all ended up being on the same page. Creating our project was tough because we were going through new ideas every week for a while, but everyone in the group kept going and giving suggestions on how to make it better. And, when we were on a good track, everyone was equally excited! We had a good dynamic within our team, and I think our differing personalities worked well together. [c 2] [...]...|$|R

Gary will put some riffs on a CD, or even a cassette, depending on which vehicle I'm driving. He feeds the riff to me, and then I put a beat to it, and we work it all out, and then we come together as a band and arrange it. Rob is really not in the room for the musical process. We're gonna probably do some more pre-production for this one, 'cause our bass player now knows about Pro Tools and is really computer savvy. None {{of the rest of us}} are, really. It's a fun process. I love the process <b>of</b> recording; it's <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> <b>thing.</b> It's like construction; you're taking raw wood and building something.
