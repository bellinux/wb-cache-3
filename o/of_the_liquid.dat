50|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} by Nikolaides et al. that the observed attractions are <b>the</b> result <b>of</b> an electrostatic pressure on <b>the</b> <b>liquid</b> interface, due to electric charges on the particles.

The force has been coined the electrodipping force by Kralchevsky et al. - it dips the particle in one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>liquids.</b>|$|R

5|$|By {{the late}} 19th century {{scientists}} realized that air could be liquefied and its components isolated by compressing and cooling it. Using a cascade method, Swiss chemist and physicist Raoul Pierre Pictet evaporated liquid sulfur dioxide {{in order to}} liquefy carbon dioxide, which in turn was evaporated to cool oxygen gas enough to liquefy it. He sent a telegram on December 22, 1877 to the French Academy of Sciences in Paris announcing his discovery of liquid oxygen. Just two days later, French physicist Louis Paul Cailletet announced his own method of liquefying molecular oxygen. Only a few drops <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>liquid</b> were produced in each case and no meaningful analysis could be conducted.

5|$|In practice, the {{flexibility}} which the OBO design allows has gone largely unused, as these ships tend {{to specialize in}} either the liquid or dry bulk trade.

5|$|In {{the absence}} of an {{external}} field, the director of a liquid crystal is free to point in any direction. It is possible, however, to force the director to point in a specific direction by introducing an outside agent to the system. For example, when a thin polymer coating (usually a polyimide) is spread on a glass substrate and rubbed in a single direction with a cloth, it is observed that liquid crystal molecules in contact with that surface align with the rubbing direction. The currently accepted mechanism for this is believed to be an epitaxial growth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>liquid</b> crystal layers on the partially aligned polymer chains in the near surface layers of the polyimide.|$|E

5|$|Recent {{research}} {{has suggested that}} the explosive behavior of alkali metals in water is driven by a Coulomb explosion rather than solely by rapid generation of hydrogen itself.

The attraction between the charged metal and water ions will rapidly increase the surface area, causing an exponential increase of ionisation. When the repulsive forces within the liquid metal surface exceeds the forces of the surface tension, it vigorously explodes.|$|E

Elevations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>liquid</b> in these channels are {{at the same level}} as Ligeia Mare to within a vertical precision of about 0.7 m, consistent with the interpretation of drowned river valleys.
