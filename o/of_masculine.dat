5|$|Ardhanarishvara {{represents}} the synthesis <b>of</b> <b>masculine</b> and feminine energies {{of the universe}} (Purusha and Prakriti) and illustrates how Shakti, the female principle of God, is inseparable from (or the same as, according to some interpretations) Shiva, the male principle of God. The union of these principles is exalted as the root and womb of all creation. Another view is that Ardhanarishvara {{is a symbol of}} Shiva's all-pervasive nature.|$|E
5|$|Scholars {{regard the}} badnjak customs as practises {{inherited}} from the old Slavic religion. In the pre-Christian religion of the Serbs, as shown by Serbian scholar Veselin Čajkanović, there were trees seen as dwelling places of spirits or divinities. Čajkanović argues that there were also trees seen as divinities per se. He considers the badnjak as a convincing example of the latter. Salutations, prayers, and sacrifices such as grain, wine, and honey are offered to him (the name badnjak is <b>of</b> <b>masculine</b> gender in Serbian); he is consistently treated not as a tree but as a person.|$|E

50|$|This type {{reflects}} Proto-Slavic a-stems, and {{is characterized}} by the ending -a in nominative singular and -ē in genitive singular. It contains most of the feminine nouns, and a small number <b>of</b> <b>masculines.</b>|$|R
5|$|Shaktism's {{focus on}} the Divine Feminine does not imply a {{rejection}} <b>of</b> <b>masculine.</b> It rejects male-female, soul-body, transcendent-immanent dualism, considering nature as divine. Devi {{is considered to be}} the cosmos itself – she is the embodiment of energy, matter and soul, the motivating force behind all action and existence in the material universe. Yet in Shaktism, states C. MacKenzie Brown, the masculine and the feminine are aspects of the divine, transcendent reality. In Hindu iconography, the cosmic dynamic of masculine-feminine interdependence and equivalence, is expressed in the half-Shakti, half-Shiva deity known as Ardhanari.|$|E

25|$|Finally, the rarely applied {{grammatical}} {{principle is}} present when, for example, the basic singular form and plural form <b>of</b> <b>masculine</b> adjectives are written differently with {{no difference in}} pronunciation (e.g. pekný = nice – singular versus pekní = nice – plural).|$|E
25|$|Poverty {{is linked}} to both the perpetration of sexual {{violence}} {{and the risk of}} being a victim of it. Several authors have argued that the relationship between poverty and perpetration of sexual violence is mediated through forms of crisis <b>of</b> <b>masculine</b> identity.|$|E
25|$|The fourth declension {{is made up}} <b>of</b> <b>masculine</b> and {{feminine}} nouns. It {{is characterized by a}} genitive singular that is identical in form to the nominative/vocative/dative singular. The singular may end in a vowel or a consonant (usually the diminutive suffix -ín). The most common plural ending is -(a)í.|$|E
40|$|Masculinity {{has been}} widely {{regarded}} as a harmful cognition that may lead men to engage in risk behavior. The present study sought to examine the role <b>of</b> hyper <b>masculine</b> cognitions and behaviors on sexual health {{in a sample of}} gay and bisexual men. A sample of n= 313 gay and bisexual men were sampled from the community. Results indicate significant effects <b>of</b> hyper <b>masculine</b> behaviors and hyper masculine cognitions on sexual health variables. Moreover, engaging in risky sexual situations fully mediated effects <b>of</b> hyper <b>masculine</b> behavior on high-risk sexual behavior. Results are discussed with a focus on ego depletion and hegemonic masculinity...|$|R

25|$|The third declension {{is made up}} <b>of</b> <b>masculine</b> and {{feminine}} nouns. It {{is characterized by the}} genitive singular in -a. The majority of nouns in this class form the plural in -(a)í. The final consonant of the stem may be broad or slender: it retains its quality in the plural, but is always broad in the genitive singular.|$|E
25|$|The {{threat of}} one man to subject another to anal or oral rape (irrumatio) is a theme of invective poetry, most notably in Catullus's notorious Carmen 16, and was a form <b>of</b> <b>masculine</b> braggadocio. Rape {{was one of the}} {{traditional}} punishments inflicted on a male adulterer by the wronged husband, though perhaps more in revenge fantasy than in practice.|$|E
25|$|Roman {{attitudes toward}} male nudity {{differ from those}} of the ancient Greeks, who {{regarded}} idealized portrayals of the nude male as an expression <b>of</b> <b>masculine</b> excellence. The wearing of the toga marked a Roman man as a free citizen. Negative connotations of nudity include defeat in war, since captives were stripped, and slavery, since slaves for sale were often displayed naked.|$|E

25|$|Virility {{as a kind}} of {{life force}} (vis) or virtue (virtus) is an {{essential}} characteristic of Mars. As an agricultural guardian, he directs his energies toward creating conditions that allow crops to grow, which may include warding off hostile forces of nature. As an embodiment <b>of</b> <b>masculine</b> aggression, he is the force that drives wars – but ideally, war that delivers a secure peace.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of puberty, {{androgen}} levels increase dramatically in males, and androgens mediate the development <b>of</b> <b>masculine</b> secondary sexual characteristics {{as well as the}} activation of spermatogenesis and fertility and masculine behavioral changes such as gynephilia and increased sex drive. Masculine secondary sexual characteristics include androgenic hair, voice deepening, emergence of the Adam's apple, broadening of the shoulders, increased muscle mass, and penile growth.|$|E
25|$|Interslavic is an inflecting language. Nouns {{can have}} three genders, two numbers (singular and plural), {{as well as}} six cases (nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, {{instrumental}} and locative). Since several Slavic languages also have a vocative, it is usually displayed in tables as well, even though strictly speaking the vocative is not a case. It occurs only in the singular <b>of</b> <b>masculine</b> and feminine nouns.|$|E

25|$|Issues of {{homophobia}} and gay bashing are {{of relevance}} to the study <b>of</b> <b>masculine</b> psychology. Every year, men (such as Matthew Shepard) die {{as a result of}} gay bashing. The victims of gay bashing attacks are most often homosexual males, or those who display what are commonly perceived as effeminate behaviors or mannerisms which are, when seen in males, often associated with homosexuality. Self-identified heterosexual males are usually the perpetrators of gay bashing attacks.|$|E
25|$|Not all {{of these}} words are stably masculine. Native English speakers, among others, tend to treat kuzo (acousin) and amiko (afriend) as gender-neutral, and nepo (agrandson/grandchild), bubo (abrat), and koko (arooster/chicken) are often {{ambiguous}} as well. Once such a word is used ambiguously by {{a significant number of}} speakers or writers, it can no longer be assumed to be masculine. Language guides suggest using all ambiguous words neutrally, and many people find this the least confusing approach—and so the ranks <b>of</b> <b>masculine</b> words gradually dwindle.|$|E
25|$|Baum {{described}} The Sexual Brain as {{engaging and}} readable, and ideal for educated laypeople. However, he criticized LeVay for being unaware of some relevant research, {{and making a}} number of factual errors, such as that orgasm {{is caused by the}} neurotransmitter oxytocin, that female rats fail to display maternal behavior after hypophysectomy, that lesions of the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus reduce presentational behavior displayed by female monkeys, that antiandrogenic drugs block the masculinization of the sexually dimorphic subdivision of the medial preoptic area in male rats, and that vaginal olfactory cues are the primary determinants <b>of</b> <b>masculine</b> sexual arousal in male primates.|$|E
