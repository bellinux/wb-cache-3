40|$|Graduation date: 1983 The {{stability}} of valproate sodium syrup repackaged in {{three types of}} unit dose containers was studied. Two-milliliter samples of commercial valproate sodium syrup 250 mg/ 5 ml (of valproic acid) were packaged in polypropylene <b>oral</b> <b>syringes,</b> glass <b>oral</b> <b>syringes,</b> and glass vials (126 of each type). These were stored at 4, 25, or 60 °C and assayed for valproic acid concentration using gas chromatography at 0, 5, 10, 20, 30, 90, and 180 days. Polypropylene syringes that were stored for 180 days at 4 and 25 °C were rinsed and put in chloroform 50 ml; valproic acid concentration was determined daily for 12 days. Valproate sodium syrup repackaged in glass <b>oral</b> <b>syringes</b> and glass vials retained 95 % of valproic acid label claim after storage at 4 and 25 °C for 180 days, while valproate sodium syrup repackaged in polypropylene <b>oral</b> <b>syringes</b> did not retain 90 % of label claim after storage for 20 days at 4 or 25 °C. All samples stored at 60 °C had greater loss than those stored at lower temperatures. An average of 86 % of the drug lost from the polypropylene syringes was recovered in 12 days during the desorption experiment (range 80 - 92 %). Repackaging valproate sodium syrup in unit dose glass vials or glass syringes resulted in retention of 95 % of valproic acid label claim after storage for 180 days at 4 and 25 °C. Repackaging of this drug prodtict in polypropylene <b>oral</b> <b>syringes</b> is not recommended...|$|R

40|$|Purpose The {{long-term}} {{stability of}} levetiracetam solution in <b>oral</b> <b>syringes</b> {{was investigated in}} order to define a suitable beyond-use date and demonstrate the feasibility of storing prepared syringes for extended periods {{as an alternative to}} commercial levetiracetam unit dose cups. Methods Levetiracetam oral solution (100 mg/mL) was drawn into 1 - and 10 -mL amber polypropylene <b>oral</b> <b>syringes.</b> Triplicate samples of the syringe preparations were stored at refrigeration (2 – 8 °C) or room temperature (20 – 25 °C) and evaluated at monthly intervals for up to six months. At each time point, the samples were visually inspected and levetiracetam stability was assessed via pH measurement and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). A short-term forced degradation study was conducted to confirm that the HPLC assay method was stability indicating. Results Over the six-month storage period, there was no significant change in either the visual appearance or pH of any of the levetiracetam samples. The results of serial HPLC assessment indicated that at least 97 % of the initial levetiracetam concentration was retained in all samples of 1 - and 10 -mL <b>oral</b> <b>syringes</b> at both refrigeration and room temperature. Although this study was conducted using a generic product, the stability data obtained may be applied in repackaging decisions regarding other generic formulations of levetiracetam with similar excipient compositions.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The only {{medication}} used sublingually in the neonate is buprenorphine for {{the treatment}} of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). Compared with morphine, buprenorphine reduces the length of treatment and length of hospitalization in neonates treated for NAS. The objective {{of this study was to}} characterize the stability of ethanolic buprenorphine for sublingual administration. METHODS: Buprenorphine solution was prepared and stored in amber glass source bottles at either 68 °F to 77 °F (20 °C- 25 °C) or 36 °F to 46 °F (2. 2 °C- 7. 8 °C). Samples were collected from each of these batches on days 0, 3, 7, 14, and 30. Additional samples were withdrawn at baseline from each batch and placed in <b>oral</b> dispensing <b>syringes</b> for 3 and 7 days. Buprenorphine concentration was assessed by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Neither storage temperature (p= 0. 65) nor storage time (p= 0. 24) significantly affected buprenorphine concentrations. All of the mean concentrations, regardless of storage temperature, were above 95 % of the labeled concentration, and the potency was maintained for samples stored either in the original amber glass source bottles or in <b>oral</b> <b>syringes.</b> CONCLUSIONS: An ethanolic buprenorphine solution is stable at room temperature for 30 days...|$|R

50|$|Chloral Hydrate is a {{commonly}} prescribed sedative, and most common for inducing sleep {{in young children}} and infants for AEP recordings. It uses alcohol to depress the central nervous system, specifically the cerebral cortex. Side effects of chloral hydrate include vomiting, nausea, gastric irritation, delirium, disorientation, allergic reactions and occasionally excitement - {{a high level of}} activity rather than becoming tired and falling asleep. Chloral Hydrate is readily available in three forms - syrup, capsule and suppository. Syrup is most successful for those 4 months and older, proper dosage is poured in an <b>oral</b> <b>syringe</b> or cup. The syringe is used to squirt {{in the back of the}} mouth and then the child is encouraged to swallow. To induce sleep, dosages range anywhere from 500 mg to 2g, the recommended pediatric dose is equal to 50 mg per kg of body weight. A second dose no greater than the first dose, and an overall dose not exceeding 100 mg/kg of body weight can be used if the child does not fall asleep after the first dose. Sedation personnel should include a physician and a registered or practical nurse. Documentation and monitoring of physiologic parameters is required throughout the entire process. Sedatives should only be administered in the presence of those who are knowledgeable and skilled in airway management and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).|$|E
50|$|A quicker {{form of the}} dry enema {{utilizes}} {{the injection}} of {{a small amount of}} water-based lubricant such as KY Jelly into the rectum via a non-hypodermic syringe, such as an <b>oral</b> <b>syringe,</b> or from some other source. Then again since the glycerin itself is an effective producer of the desired contraction of the colonic muscles it is simpler - and more easily controlled - to introduce 5 - 10 cc of glycerin directly into the rectum. Specialist syringes are available for this purpose but are hard to find. An alternative is to use an enema nozzle which has an intake end which is compatible with a standard hypodermic syringe. This allows the immediate injection of the 5-10 ccs. required, and results can be expected in 2-4 minutes. Another alternative is to use a normal 5 or 10cc syringe inserted directly into the anus. This needs to be done carefully to avoid scratching the anal passage. The passage should be lubricated with sorbolene cream or any water-based lubricant. Only a syringe with a Luer-slip should be used, not a Luer-lock tip (a syringe end molded to take a screw-on needle). Penetration is better performed by the patient to eliminate any pain. The patient should be encouraged to wait at least 15 minutes in order that peristalsis can reach the full length of the rectum, but many will find this impossible and this treatment should therefore be applied only when the facilities to evacuate are nearby.|$|E

Aim: To assess effects of food, water, and route of administration on the bioavailability of dexlansoprazole 30 -mg ODT. Methods: Two separate open-label, phase 1, single-dose crossover studies were conducted in healthy adults. In study 1, pharmacokinetic parameters were analyzed in participants receiving dexlansoprazole ODT in a fed or fasted state with and without water. In study 2, the bioavailability of dexlansoprazole after administration via <b>oral</b> <b>syringe</b> or nasogastric (NG) tube, or after swallowing intact with water was compared to ODT administration in the fasted state, swallowed without water. Blood samples for determining dexlansoprazole plasma concentrations and pharmacokinetic parameter estimates were collected before and after dosing. Results: Equivalent values for area under the plasma concentration–time curve (AUC) were observed in the fed and fasted states, but the maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) was 38 % lower in the fed state; therefore, bioequivalence was not achieved. A water rinse following standard ODT administration decreased dexlansoprazole bioavailability, with lower Cmax and AUC values than when ODT was administered without a water rinse. Bioequivalence was demonstrated when comparing the alternative routes of administration, including via <b>oral</b> <b>syringe</b> or NG tube with standard ODT administration. Unlike with a water rinse, bioequivalence to standard ODT administration (i. e., without water) was demonstrated when swallowing the ODT intact with water. Rates of adverse events were comparable irrespective of administration route in the fasted state (6. 7 %– 9. 3 %) and were 12 % higher in the fed state than in the fasted state. Conclusion: The AUC from the dexlansoprazole ODT was equivalent when administered in the fed and fasted states.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Parent {{medication}} {{errors are}} exceedingly common, with one child experiencing an outpatient medication error every 8 minutes. In a previous randomized controlled trial where the intervention {{was carried out}} under ideal conditions, we examined the efficacy of a pictographic, health literacy-informed medication instruction sheet-based intervention (HELPix) in reducing parent dosing errors. While our intervention was efficacious in reducing errors, reproducing these results in a real world setting, is necessary to examine the true effectiveness of HELPix. OBJECTIVES: 1) To {{examine the impact of}} HELPix implementation on parent medication dosing errors. 2) To assess the effect of HELPix implementation on provider use of medication counseling strategies. DESIGN/METHODS: A pre-implementation/post-implementation study design was used in 2 pediatric Emergency Departments (EDs) in New York City, one with planned implementation of the HELPix intervention (HELPix site) and the other a control site within the same hospital network. Subject inclusion criteria included: 1) English or Spanish-speaking parent, 2) child < 9 years old, child prescribed a short course (≤ 14 days) daily liquid medicine, and 3) parent present with the child in the emergency department and received medication counseling. Parents were recruited over the phone; those who enrolled completed a phone interview along with a follow-up in-person assessment (median time to follow-up= 15 days). ED providers (residents, fellows, attendings) were also recruited. The HELPix intervention consists of: 1) provider provision of patient- and medicine-specific pictographic instruction sheets, 2) provider use of pictures/drawings as part of counseling to reinforce dosing information, 3) provider demonstration of the dose using an <b>oral</b> <b>syringe,</b> 3) teachback of dose information, 4) parent showback of the dose they plan to give, and 5) provider provision of an <b>oral</b> <b>syringe.</b> At the HELPix site, ED providers were trained in the use of HELPix counseling strategies as well as how to use the electronic medical record (EMR) system to generate the instruction sheets while ordering a prescription. Outcomes assessed were: 1) provider provision of HELPix instruction sheets via web tracking, 2) dosing errors ≥ 20 % deviation from prescribed dose, assessed from observation at follow-up visit, 3) provider counseling practices (i. e. use of pictures/drawings, demonstration, teachback, showback, provision of dosing tool) obtained by parent report. RESULTS: A total of 1493 parents were assessed by telephone for eligibility in the pre-/post-implementation phases. 561 parent-child dyads were recruited by phone (284 at HELPix site; 277 at control site). A total of 92 % were mothers, 52 % were Spanish speakers, 78 % were Latino, 16 % were Black, and 85 % were of low socioeconomic status. Web tracking at the HELPix intervention site indicated that for 58 % of the enrolled families in the post-implementation period, providers generated HELPix medication instruction sheets. Compared to the pre-implementation period at the intervention site, parent dosing errors rates were significantly reduced during the post-implementation period (37 % versus 16 %; AOR= 0. 3, p< 0. 001); with an overall Relative Risk Reduction (RRR) = 57 %, with greatest reductions in errors among those that received HELPix sheets (12 % error rate, RRR= 68 %). Providers at the HELPix implementation site {{were significantly more likely to}} use recommended provider counseling strategies post-implementation compared to pre-implementation (pictures/drawings: 37 % versus 1 %; dosing demonstration: 59 % versus 33 %; teachback: 24 % versus 8 %; showback: 33 % vs. 13 %, and provision of <b>oral</b> <b>syringe</b> 79 % versus 25 %; p< 0. 0001 for all strategies). In the non-intervention site, there were no differences in parent dosing error rates, or in provider use of counseling strategies between the pre- and post-implementation periods. CONCLUSION: Implementation of the HELPix intervention resulted in increased provider use of recommended counseling strategies as well as decreased parent medication dosing errors in an urban public hospital setting serving low socioeconomic status families. Use of HELPix supports high quality provider medication counseling and appears to be feasible to incorporate as part of routine Emergency Department discharge practices...|$|E

Background: Prescribing information provided with over-the-counter medication may {{be a source of}} confusion for parents delivering analgesics to children at home. Accurate administration is essential to ensure safe and effective treatment of children's pain or fever. The Parental Analgesia Slide is a new device developed with the objective of improving parental dosing accuracy. Methods: In this prospective, randomised study, 160 parents accompanying children aged between one and 13 -years-old were randomly allocated to complete a paracetamol dose calculation and administration questionnaire using one of two sources of prescribing information. Absolute percentage dose error and the number of correct dosage intervals, frequencies and demonstrated drug volumes were compared. Results: Use of the Parental Analgesia Slide resulted in a reduction in the absolute percentage dose error from a median of 33. 3 to 0 % (p< 0. 001) and {{an increase in the number}} of correct dosage intervals and frequencies (59 to 70 / 80, p= 0. 046).

The charcoal was gavaged as 0.3 mL of 99 mTc-Ch-DTPA suspension using <b>oral</b> feeding <b>syringe</b> at time 0. After gavaging of the 99 mTc-Ch-DTPA, the animals were imaged in the NanoSPECT-CT under light inhalation anesthesia using isoflurane (1 % isoflurane in 100 % oxygen at a flow rate of 1 L/min). Due to short duration of the anesthesia and short recovery time, a major effect of anesthesia on GI motility is not expected. To visualize the path traveled by the charcoal along the total length of the gastrointestinal tract, temporal images were collected for post-acquisition analysis. SPECT scans were obtained at 0, 1, 3, 6, and 22 h after ingestion of the 99 mTc-Ch-DTPA.

40|$|In this {{experiment}} {{the hypothesis that}} providing a supplementary source of bovine milk immunoglobulin G (IgG) to suckling piglets increases post-weaning growth performance was tested. The litters from eight multiparous Large White x Landrace sows received <b>oral</b> supplements by <b>syringe.</b> Three piglets in each litter received oral doses of whey globulin concentrate (WGC) which contained 6 % IgG. A second group of three piglets per litter received oral doses of whey protein isolate (WPI) to approximate the amino acids supplied in WGC but without IgG's. A third group of three piglets per litter received oral doses of water (CONT) to simulate the oral dosing procedure. The daily supplement of WGC and WPI provided 0. 7 g per day of age of ideal protein {{during the first week}} and 1. 4 g per day of age thereafter. The oral doses were provided twice daily at 09. 00 h and 15. 00 h from day 2 to day 24 of lactation. For the statistical analysis, a linear model including sex, sow and treatment as fixed effects, and live weight at birth as covariate was fitted to the data. The average daily gains measured over the suckling period (24 d) were not atatistically significantly different between the three groups with the control gaining 249 gd- 1, WGC gaining 259 gd- 1 and WPI gaining 264 gd- 1. The provision of either WGC or WPI did not increase the average daily gain up to weaning, possibly because the piglets reduced their intake of sow's milk. To determine the effect of supplemental IgG, the most valid comparison is between WPI and WGC because the supply of ideal protein, and the time taken to provide each oral dose, were similar. Piglets receiving WGC grew 12 % faster than WPI from transfer (62 d) to slaughter (85 kg) (P < 0. 05), and 8 % faster from birth to slaughter (P < 0. 05). These findings indicate that the provision of IgG during early life can lead to long term advantages in growth rate...|$|R

Because {{of the importance of}} their proper use for children&# 39;s health, {{this study was designed to}} assess Saudi mothers&# 39; experiences with measuring cups, syringes, and droppers for oral liquid medications; to compare accuracy of dosing across these devices; and to determine the effects of mothers&# 39; education statuses and pharmacist counseling on dosing accuracy. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study in which mothers were observed as they used a set of commonly available dosing devices which are a dosing cup, syringe, and dropper. Interviews were conducted in the outpatient pharmacy waiting area in several tertiary hospitals and primary clinics in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia between March and April 2013. Saudi women who were mothers of children aged 12 years old or younger and who gave their consent were eligible. Caregivers other than mothers and subjects with vision problems or cognitive/physical disabilities were excluded. We gathered demographic information such as age, number of children, and education status. Subjects were asked if they had had counseling on how to use measuring devices and which device they preferred. Then, the mothers were required to demonstrate how to measure 5 mL of paracetamol (acetaminophen) syrup using a cup and a syringe and 1 mL of paracetamol syrup using a dropper. Dosing errors were evaluated visually as overdosing, underdosing, or no error (if the dose was accurate). The data were entered into Microsoft Excel and evaluated using Stata 11. 1. Logistic regression was employed to determine relationships. Results: The results revealed that 58 % of participants measured an accurate dose of paracetamol using the oral dosing syringe versus 50 % of participants using the dropper and 51 % using the dosing cup. In general, participants measured more than the intended dose with the dosing cup and less than the intended dose with the dropper. Furthermore, we found that dosing accuracy for each type of instrument was significantly influenced by the mothers&# 39; education status. Among the study participants, 77 % had not had previous counseling on the use of liquid medication measuring devices. However, dosing errors were not affected by previous counseling. Conclusion: Among mothers using measuring devices, the most accurate doses were found to be measured with the use of the <b>oral</b> <b>syringe,</b> whereas the most errors were made with the use of the dropper.
