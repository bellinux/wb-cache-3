25|$|This {{critical}} and popular acclaim offered Hazlitt the prospect <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> of debt, and {{allowed him to}} relax and bask {{in the light of}} his growing fame. In literary circles however, his reputation had been tarnished in the meantime: he had openly taken both Wordsworth and Coleridge to task on personal grounds and for failing to fulfill the promise of their earlier accomplishments, and both were apparently responsible for retaliatory rumours which seriously damaged Hazlitt's repute. And the worst was yet to come.|$|E

25|$|He hits many sixes {{long and}} high, favouring {{straight}} down the ground or over midwicket. His trademark shot is a cross-batted flick to the leg-side to a ball outside off stump. However, his aggressive style increases his risk <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> and {{he is one of}} the most inconsistent batsmen in cricket. This is reflected by the fact that he is the only player to score more than 7,000 ODI runs at an average under 25. Afridi is the only player in the world who has scored 1,000 runs and 50 wickets in the T20 format of the game. Afridi has moved about the batting order, and this lack of consistency has made it difficult for him to settle. In the Indian subcontinent, where the ball quickly loses its shine, he prefers to open the batting; however, elsewhere he prefers to bat at number six.|$|E

The 1878 census population count for the entire kingdom had been only 57,985. As the tale went, Kalākaua would then hand the deed to the islands over to the Chinese government.

500|$|The Cabanatuan {{prison camp}} {{was named after}} the nearby city of 50,000people (locals also called it Camp Pangatian, after a small nearby village). The camp had first been used as an American Department of Agriculture station and then a {{training}} camp for the Filipino army.

One side of the camp housed Japanese guards, while the other included bamboo barracks for the prisoners as well as a section for a hospital.

500|$|Two {{years into}} the role, she {{experienced}} a 14-month nervous breakdown but did not confide in anyone besides her close family or take any time off work, which in retrospect she deemed [...] "the worst thing [...] could have done. During {{the worst part of}} her experience Lancashire described herself as [...] "hysterical at the thought <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> of bed". Her mother Hilda forced her to seek medical assistance for her condition, which Lancashire states [...] "gave me my life back", her twenties having been [...] "a write-off". Lancashire felt her first marriage had also contributed to her unhappiness; in 2001, she stated that though her marriage lasted ten years, it [...] "was 10 years longer than it should have done". [...] In 1995 she separated from Hargeaves; the pair would ultimately later divorce. She described leaving her marriage as a [...] "cleansing experience" [...] and a [...] "renaissance"; one that enabled her to rediscover her sense of identity. Other steps that Lancashire took to combat her depression included remaining single for five years, attending therapy sessions, and taking prescriptions of the anti-depressant drug Paroxetine. In December 1995 Lancashire starred in the spin-off straight-to-video film Coronation Street– The Cruise, a 75-minute special detailing Raquel and Curly's honeymoon. The special was advertised as being exclusive to video, and 750,000 copies were sold, to the value of £10million. Lancashire departed Coronation Street in 1996 due to her heavy work schedule and desire to pursue other projects. She had also tired of the fame the role brought her, shying away from personal appearances and interviews with television magazines. Her final scenes attracted 20million viewers. Lancashire's performance in the role saw her nominated in the Most Popular Actress category at the 2nd National Television Awards in October 1996.|$|E

500|$|In March 1957, Hancock was one {{of three}} candidates, along with Air Vice Marshals Frederick Scherger and Allan Walters, touted as {{possible}} successors to Air Marshal Sir John McCauley as Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), the RAAF's senior position. Scherger gained selection, and Hancock was posted in June to Malaya as Air Officer Commanding (AOC) No. 224 Group RAF, responsible for all Commonwealth air forces in the region. Though fastidious in appearance and a strict teetotaller, he was known for his enthusiasm in meeting staff and as [...] "an indefatigable participant in mess functions and games". He also made a point <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> to units in the field, taking every opportunity to fly himself around his command. For his [...] "distinguished service in Malaya", Hancock was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) on 9December 1958. He returned to Australia in July 1959 to serve as AOC Operational Command (now Air Command). When Scherger's term as CAS was due to complete, Hancock and Walters were once more put forward to the Minister for Air as potential replacements. His [...] "professional ability, operational experience and personal qualities" [...] being deemed more appropriate for the role, Hancock was promoted to air marshal and took over as CAS in May 1961. In June, he met with his opposite numbers in the Army and Navy at a Chiefs of Staff Committee conference to discuss the necessity of Australia acquiring nuclear weapons; the chiefs agreed that the probability such a capability would be required was remote but that it should remain an option under certain circumstances, a position the defence forces maintained during the ensuing decade. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in the 1962 Queen's Birthday Honours, gazetted on 2June.|$|E
500|$|H. J. R. Murray {{wrote that}} Staunton's {{response}} to Morphy's initial challenge and his {{article about the}} same in The Illustrated London News should have been interpreted as a courteous refusal of the offer, but that Morphy interpreted them differently, {{and one of the}} main reasons for his visit to Europe in 1858 was the hope of playing a match with Staunton. Murray also commented on the whole affair, [...] "In all this there is but little in which we can reproach Staunton, beyond the fact that he kept open the possibility of a match for so long, and even here there is a good deal that could be urged in justification of the course followed by Staunton" [...] but also noted that both sides were playing tactical games with each other in front of the public, and that comments made by both players or their respective supporters were acrimonious. In response to Morphy's complaints Lord Lyttelton, then president of the British Chess Association, said that it was reasonable for Staunton to decline the match, but that in his opinion Staunton should have done so plainly in his first letter to America, but had instead often given the impression that he would soon be ready to start the match. von der Lasa later wrote, although not specifically about this affair, that he thought there was no chance of Staunton's health being good enough for a serious contest from 1853 onwards. William Norwood Potter wrote in his obituary of Staunton in the City of London Chess Magazine, [...] "...nor were his innuendoes concerning Morphy otherwise than an utterly unworthy means <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> of an engagement, which he could have either declined with a good grace at first, or afterwards have honourably asked to be released from. Nevertheless, all said and done, Staunton was, as we have often heard a distinguished enemy of his say, emphatically a MAN. There was nothing weak about him, and he had a backbone that never curved with fear of any one." ...|$|E

2500|$|To {{coincide}} with the release <b>of</b> <b>Get</b> <b>Out,</b> Peele curated a film series for the Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM) called The Art of the Social Thriller.

Peele also included films outside of the horror genre, such as psychological thrillers Funny Games and Misery, Hitchcock's mystery thriller Rear Window, and comedy-thriller The 'Burbs. The sneak preview <b>of</b> <b>Get</b> <b>Out</b> was preceded by the 1967 comedy-drama Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, the first Hollywood film to address interracial marriage and a big influence on the premise for Peele's own film. When asked about its inclusion in the series, Peele told the Village Voice, [...] "It’s not an actual thriller, it’s just a great exploration of the social phenomenon of {{how we deal with}} race, putting it in a package that everyone can understand.
