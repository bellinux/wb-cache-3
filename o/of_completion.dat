5|$|Both Bayern and Baden were interned in Scapa Flow {{following}} the Armistice in November 1918. Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, {{the commander of}} the interned German fleet, ordered his ships be sunk on 21 June 1919; Bayern was successfully scuttled, though British guards managed to beach Baden to prevent her from sinking. The ship was eventually expended as a gunnery target in 1921. Sachsen and Württemberg, both at various stages <b>of</b> <b>completion</b> when the war ended, were broken up for scrap metal. Bayern was raised in 1934 and broken up the following year.|$|E

5|$|Construction {{began on}} Vladimir Monomakh on 22 February 1881 at the Baltic Shipyard in St. Petersburg, {{although}} the formal keel-laying ceremony was not held until 21 May. She was launched on 22 October 1882 and completed on 13 July 1883. The ship's total cost was 3,348,847 rubles. Although the second vessel {{to be laid}} down in the Dmitri Donskoy class, Vladimir Monomakh was completed first. Due to constant changes during construction, the design of both vessels diverged considerably by the time <b>of</b> <b>completion.</b> The ship was named after Vladimir II Monomakh, Grand Prince of Kiev.|$|E

40|$|Model-driven {{performance}} prediction methods require {{detailed design}} models {{to evaluate the}} performance of software sys-tems during early development stages. However, the complexity of detailed prediction models and the semantic gap between modelled performance concerns and functional concerns prevents many developers to address performance. As {{a solution to this}} problem, systematic model refinements, called completions, hide low-level details from developers. Completions auto-matically integrate performance-relevant details into component-based architectures using model-to-model transformations. In such scenarios, conflicts between different completions are likely. Therefore, the application order <b>of</b> <b>completions</b> must be determined unambiguously in order to reduce such conflicts. Many existing approaches employ the concept <b>of</b> performance <b>completions</b> to include performance-relevant details to the prediction model. So far researcher only address the application <b>of</b> a single <b>completion</b> on an architectural model. The reduction <b>of</b> conflicting <b>completions</b> have not yet been considered. In this paper, we present a systematic approach to reduce and avoid conflicts between completions that are applied to the same model. The method presented in this paper is essential for the automated integration <b>of</b> <b>completions</b> in software performance engineering. Furthermore, we apply our approach to reduce conflicts of a set <b>of</b> <b>completions</b> based on design patterns for concurrent software systems...|$|R

It was slated for release on the 64DD, a disk drive {{expansion}} peripheral for the Nintendo 64. Itoi's expansive ideas during development led the development team {{to question whether}} fans would still consider the game part of the series. The game entered development hell and struggled to find a firm release date and in 2000, despite its level <b>of</b> <b>completion,</b> was later cancelled altogether with the commercial failure of the 64DD.|$|E
