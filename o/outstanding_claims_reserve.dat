40|$|Correct {{estimation}} of the <b>Outstanding</b> <b>Claims</b> <b>Reserve,</b> an item that includes Incurred But Not Reported Claims (IBNR) as well as Incurred But Not Enough Reserved Claims (IBNER), {{is one of the}} most important issues currently facing actuarial science, due to its effect on the technical and financial stability of insurance companies. The purpose of this paper is to calculate the reserve in a decision-making environment, so that estimates can be made according to accurately defined and previously established rational criteria. Specifically, the estimating process enables a company’s particular situation to be taken into account, by incorporating its approach to the consequences arising from estimation errors into the model. The proposed calculation method gives rise to optimum link ratio estimators that can also be interpreted from a Bayesian perspective, with the advantages associated to such methodology.

This implies that the claims reserving problem for a portfolio of several (perhaps correlated) subportfolios is to be solved.

For the bivariate situation, we have already developed robust solutions for the chain-ladder method by introducing two techniques for detecting and correcting outliers.

40|$|In a {{non-life}} insurance business an insurer often needs {{to build up}} a reserve to be able to meet his future obligations arising from claims that are known to exist, but for which the actual size is unknown at the time the reserves have to be set. The delay of the actual payment of the claims is, for example, due to long legal procedures or difficulties in determining the size of the claims. Therefore, insurers have to build up reserves enabling them to pay the outstanding claims and to meet claims arising in the future on the written contracts. We assume that Xij and Cij (for 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) are respectively the incremental and the cumulative claims amount of accident year i and development year j.

40|$|Romanian {{insurance}} industry has a competitive market, having, however, a deep character of heterogeneity, {{which has had}} an impact on different financial ratios that define it. In an international framework, non-life insurance market in Romania was a different pattern as compared to similar markets from Central and Eastern Europe and in relation to similar markets from 42 countries in the world, with a growing trend, even in the year 2009, when this sector stagnate or even decreases. In Romania, within the class of non-life insurance, motor third party liability insurance ranks second, as a source of income and expenses, even since 1990. Peculiarities of this type of insurance motivated a detailed analysis based on its compulsory character, together with public availability of the financial information. In order to better understand the developments for this class of insurance, for 2005 - 2008 a wide range of financial indicators was used such as gross written premiums, gross claims payable, loss ratio, coverage rate, solvency ratio, etc. Even if the risk management had no major problems, nevertheless this insurance class faced some difficulties, especially regarding the growing trend for the loss ratio, the solvency margin, the casualty and coverage ratios and for the <b>outstanding</b> <b>claims</b> <b>reserve</b> adequacy. In addition, correlations between different financial indicators specific to the sector, analyzed over a period of four years, provided additional findings for {{a deeper understanding of the}} characteristics of this insurance class.

The standard actuarial technique, the so-called "chain-ladder technique" is given a sound statistical foundation and considered as a linear model. This linear model, the '"Chain Ladder Linear Model" is extended to encompass Bayesian, empirical Bayes and dynamic estimation. The empirical Bayes results are given a credibility theory interpretation, and {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of the various approaches are highlighted. Finally, the methods are extended to two-dimensional systems and results based on classical time series and Kalman filtering theory are produced. The empirical Bayes estimation results are very useful, practically, and can be compared to the Kalman filter estimates. They have the advantage that no prior information is required: the Kalman filter method requires the state and observation variances to be specified. For illustration purposes the estimates from the empirical Bayes procedure are used. The empirical Bayes results can also be compared with credibility theory estimators, although they retain the general statistical advantages of the linear modelling approach. For the classical theory, unbiased estimates of <b>outstanding</b> <b>claims,</b> <b>reserves</b> and variances are derived, and prediction intervals for total <b>outstanding</b> <b>claims</b> are produced.

Traditional statistical-actuarial methods are used to control and/or asseverate the evaluation and recent developments have tended to ensure that these enable an independent assessment of the <b>claims</b> <b>reserve.</b> In some European countries, a large subset of motor liability claims is managed within a direct reimbursement (DR) scheme. In Italy, the introduction of the direct compensation CARD system for third-party liability insurance has resulted in greater attention in the use of these traditional methods due to the heterogeneity of the data available for evaluations. This paper presents the results of a study undertaken to define a calculation method that, using the different assumptions that describe the evolution of settlement mechanisms, is able to quantify the <b>claims</b> <b>reserve.</b> The proposed methodology reduces the loss adjuster’s discretion in applying statistical methods since all assumptions must be made explicit and can hence be monitored and controlled. Furthermore, a stress test can be performed on all the parameters that influence the settlement and thus the <b>claims</b> <b>reserve.</b> Finally, in a backtesting perspective, the proposed methodology enables an ex-post analysis of actual cash flow deviations compared to expected values, identifying the variables that lead to these differences.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Outstanding</b> <b>claims</b> {{liability}} is {{the insurance}} companies’ corporate responsibility towards future debt. There {{are a number}} of existing models used to estimate the <b>outstanding</b> <b>claims</b> liability for long tail business. However, some of the assumptions imposed on these models are not met by the claims data under consideration. Furthermore, trends in the development year and payment year periods are not taken into account by these models. The Probabilistic Trend Family (PTF) model is developed to overcome these problems. In this paper, PTF model is described; and the process of estimating the <b>outstanding</b> <b>claims</b> liability, starting from the preliminary analysis of the claims data to the estimation of the <b>outstanding</b> <b>claims</b> liability is explained. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the obtained estimate of the <b>outstanding</b> <b>claims</b> liability is analyzed using a tool called leverage. Leverage can be used to evaluate the robustness of the model used to estimate the <b>outstanding</b> <b>claims</b> liability.

40|$|Stochastic {{models for}} <b>outstanding</b> <b>claims</b> {{valuation}} have been recently developed {{with the aim}} to obtain either a variability coefficient or the probability distribution of the reserve, useful {{for the assessment of}} the Reserve Risk capital requirement. Different methodologies, like Bootstrapping or Bayesian methods, allow to determine the prediction error and the <b>claims</b> <b>reserve</b> distribution under some assumptions based on the data figured out in the run-off triangle. The International Actuarial Association (IAA) proposed a different way to analyse out-standing <b>claim</b> <b>reserve,</b> focused on a paper by Meyers, Klinker and Lalonde where the overall reserve of a single LoB (without any distinction among different accident years) is described as a compound mixed poisson process, by a similar approach used for aggregate amount of claims when premium risk is to be estimated. In the present paper we extend this approach assuming that each single cell of {{the lower part of the}} run-off triangle follows a Compound Poisson Process (either Pure or Mixed). This assumption leads, under independence constraint, to obtain quite easily the exact moments of the reserve distribution only through the knowledge of the characteristics of the two main random variables (number and claim size of future payments). Furthermore, Monte Carlo methods allow to simulate <b>outstanding</b> <b>claims</b> distributions for each accident year, for both the overall reserve until complete run-off and the next calendar year only (in case of a one-year time horizon as prescribed in Solvency II). Model s parameters are calibrated from observed data and through a deterministic model (in the present paper an average cost method is used, namely Fisher-Lange method) based on the separate estimate of number of claims to be paid and future average costs for each cell of the lower triangle to be estimated. Finally, we analyze the one-year reserve risk in the perspective adopted by Solvency II. In particular a simulation approach, now usually called re-reserving, is here applied with the target to estimate the variability of claims development result and the percentiles, in order to quantify the capital requirement for the reserve risk. Main results will be compared using different stochastic reserving models, analysing the effect on both capital requirement for only reserve risk and risk margin...|$|R
