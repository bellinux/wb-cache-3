Two fine stone coffins were found, interred with the remains <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> woman. The villa and coffins were removed to a place near the gates of the factory grounds, and construction on the factory went ahead. Fry's built in the grounds of the factory a museum which for many years housed the Durley Hill mosaics, the coffins, and numerous other artefacts. In 2012, Taylor Wimpey, about to develop the factory site, made a detailed geophysical assessment of the area, and discovered an additional 15 Roman buildings centered around a Roman road beneath Keynsham Hams, with evidence of additional Roman buildings that had been disturbed by quarrying.|$|E

The Council would have consisted of three individuals from the ministry, three broadcast industry representatives, and three school teachers.
