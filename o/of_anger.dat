5|$|As {{the statue}} became {{an object of}} a pagan veneration, missionaries and the Bishop of Vannes Charles de Rosmadec asked Claude de Lannion, Lord of Blavet Quinipily, to destroy the statue. In 1661, Lannion ordered the statue to be thrown into the Blavet river. Abundant rain {{destroyed}} the harvest soon after, which peasantry and devotees interpreted as an act <b>of</b> <b>anger</b> by their insulted idol. In 1664, the statue was drawn from the river and restored to its original location.|$|E
5|$|Asad was {{dismissed}} {{from his office}} in Ramadan 109 AH (December 727 or January 728 AD), when in an outburst <b>of</b> <b>anger</b> he had the chief representatives of the four greatest Arab tribes in Khurasan, the Ahl al-'Aliyah, Azd, Tamim, and Bakr, publicly flogged. Caliph Hisham demanded his dismissal, and after naming al-Hakam ibn 'Awana al-Kalbi as his deputy, Asad returned to his brother in Iraq.|$|E

5|$|Dava Sobel {{argues that}} prior to Galileo's 1633 trial and {{judgement}} for heresy, Pope Urban VIII had become preoccupied with court intrigue and problems of state, and began to fear persecution or threats to his own life. In this context, Sobel argues {{that the problem of}} Galileo was presented to the pope by court insiders and enemies of Galileo. Having been accused of weakness in defending the church, Urban reacted against Galileo out <b>of</b> <b>anger</b> and fear.|$|E
5|$|The prisoners {{believe they}} have won the study, but the guards have tricked them into winning, {{allowing}} them to escape. Keith tells the police the story of Kendall and Cormac's deaths: Kendall gave Keith a valuable painting disguised as money in a case, and Cormac tried to kill Kendall and Keith to get the case's contents. Cormac killed Liam out <b>of</b> <b>anger</b> {{that there was no}} money. The episode concludes with Logan streaking through sociology class, fulfilling a bet made earlier in the episode.|$|E
5|$|Thurstan {{was the son}} of a {{canon of}} St Paul's in London named Anger, Auger or Ansgar, who held the prebend of Cantlers.

5|$|After Méliès's {{financial}} difficulties and decline, most {{copies of his}} prints were lost. In 1917, his offices were occupied by the French military, who melted down many of Méliès's films to gather the traces of silver from the film stock and make boot heels from the celluloid. When the Théâtre Robert-Houdin was demolished in 1923, the prints kept there were sold by weight to a vendor of second-hand film. Finally, in that same year, Méliès had a moment <b>of</b> <b>anger</b> and burned all his remaining negatives in his garden in Montreuil. In 1925, he began selling toys and candy from a stand in the Gare Montparnasse in Paris. A Trip to the Moon was largely forgotten to history and went unseen for years.|$|E
5|$|Anxious-ambivalent {{attachment}} is also misnamed as 'resistant attachment'. In general, a {{child with}} an anxious-ambivalent pattern of attachment will typically explore little (in the Strange Situation) and is often wary of strangers, even when the parent is present. When the mother departs, the child is often highly distressed. The child is generally ambivalent when she returns. The anxious-ambivalent strategy {{is a response to}} unpredictably responsive caregiving, and the displays <b>of</b> <b>anger</b> (ambivalent resistant) or helplessness (ambivalent passive) towards the caregiver on reunion can be regarded as a conditional strategy for maintaining the availability of the caregiver by preemptively taking control of the interaction.|$|E
5|$|By April 1896 the Welsh Football Union had sanctioned a {{subscription}} of 1,000 shillings to be {{contributed to the}} Gould testimonial. The Rugby Football Union (RFU) complained and the IRFB reacted by informing the WFU that only a plate up {{to the value of}} a hundred pounds sterling could be given to Gould, and that the remaining funds should be donated to charity; otherwise Wales would lose their international fixtures. The WFU stood down and withdrew their subscription. The reaction in Wales was one <b>of</b> <b>anger,</b> with the people feeling that the WFU had bowed to English pressure, and had been bullied into a decision against the people's wishes.|$|E

5|$|It {{was about}} this time that an {{incident}} occurred that temporarily clouded his career. In a moment <b>of</b> <b>anger</b> he struck one of the Thalias lieutenants, Robert Forbes.

In view of the mitigating circumstances, the court recommended that Paulet be considered for clemency by King George III. The King was pleased to follow the recommendation and reinstated Paulet in the service.|$|E
5|$|The Avalanche {{chose not}} to re-sign Fleury, and he joined the New York Rangers on a three-year {{contract}} worth $21million that included a club option for a fourth year at $7million. He touched off a wave <b>of</b> <b>anger</b> on signing with the Rangers when he claimed he was unappreciated in Calgary, comments he later stated were directed at the Flames' owners and not the team's fans, who he said always supported him. Fleury's first year in Manhattan was a disappointment. He scored only 15goals in 1999–2000, struggling {{under the pressure of}} trying to lead the Rangers into the playoffs and adapting to life in New York. After the season, he voluntarily entered a league-operated program that treats substance abuse and emotional problems, though he denied that either had any effect on his play.|$|E
5|$|The {{cardinals}} then {{attempted to}} elect Vidoni again, but Chigi was now opposed to him out <b>of</b> <b>anger</b> at the French for excluding d'Elci. The Spanish cardinals also worked against Vidoni, implying {{at one point}} that Mariana of Austria, the Queen regent of Spain, had excluded Vidoni's candidacy. The Spanish then attempted to elect Benedetto Odescalchi, but d'Ailly declared that no one would be allowed to be elected unless they owed loyalty to Louis XIV. The Spanish soon sent word that their cardinals were free to vote for anyone. The letter was brought by courier and announced that Mariana of Austria had not actually excluded Vidoni nor any member of the college.|$|E

50|$|Under Conwoïon two {{churches were}} built, one {{dedicated}} to Christ the Saviour (Sanctus Salvator) {{and the other}} to the Blessed Virgin Mary. The former, a Romanesque construction, was dedicated on 28 October 832/833. The altar contained relics of Saint Epetème or Apodème, Bishop <b>of</b> <b>Angers</b> (Hypothemius or Apodemius <b>of</b> <b>Angers)</b> which Conwoïon had acquired by dubious means. Pope Leo IV later made the abbey a gift of the relics of Saint Marcellinus <b>of</b> <b>Angers.</b> From 849 Redon also possessed relics of the Breton Saint Melor.|$|R
5|$|A {{short while}} {{later at the}} Andronikov Monastery, a {{messenger}} arrives from Moscow to ask Andrei for his assistance in decorating the Annunciation Cathedral with Theophanes the Greek. Both Daniil and Kirill are agitated by the recognition that Andrei receives. Daniil refuses to accompany Andrei and reproaches him for accepting Theophanes’ offer without considering his fellows, but soon repents of his temper and tearfully wishes Andrei well when the younger monk comes {{to say goodbye to}} his friend. Kirill is jealous of Andrei and in a fit <b>of</b> <b>anger,</b> decides to leave the monastery for the secular world, throwing accusations of greed in the face of his fellow monks, who also dismiss him. Kirill stumbles out of the monastery into the snowy countryside and is pursued by his dog, but Kirill savagely beats it with his walking stick and leaves it for dead. Andrei leaves for Moscow with his young apprentice Foma (Mikhail Kononov). Foma is another creative character, representing the light-hearted and practical-minded commercial artist. Still he seems to be contemplative enough to get along with Andrei.|$|E
5|$|Bhairava's {{headgear}} has a ruff on the back, a {{skull and}} cobra over the forehead, and the crescent {{high on the}} right. His facial expression is <b>of</b> <b>anger,</b> conviction of something he must do, {{and one in the}} middle of action. The legs and five of the eight arms are broken, attributed to Portuguese vandalism. The smaller broken image Andhaka is seen below Bhairava's image. Also depicted in his right hand is the symbolic weapon that Shaiva mythology states Shiva used to kill the destructive elephant demon. A hand holds a bowl to collect the blood dripping from the slain Andhaka, which Shaiva legend states was necessary because the dripping blood had the power to become new demons if they got nourished by the ground. Furthermore, the artwork shows ruined parts of a male and two female forms, figures of two ascetics, a small figure in front, a female figure, and two dwarfs. The uppermost part shows flying apsaras bringing garlands.|$|E
5|$|Confident that he {{was being}} {{targeted}} by clubs from higher divisions, Bruce resolved not to sign a new contract with Gillingham when his existing deal expired {{at the end of the}} 1983–84 season. In an April 1983 match against Newport County, he attempted, in a moment <b>of</b> <b>anger,</b> to deliberately injure opposition player Tommy Tynan, but connected awkwardly and succeeded only in breaking his own leg, leaving him unable to play again for six months. He returned in time to play a key role in Gillingham achieving two draws against Everton in the FA Cup in 1984, attracting the attention once again of scouts from First Division clubs. Arthur Cox, manager of Bruce's beloved Newcastle United, expressed an interest in signing the player, but resigned from his job before any further action could be taken. Bruce eventually opted to sign for Norwich City in August 1984 for a fee variously reported as £125,000 or £135,000. In 2009, he was voted into Gillingham's Hall of Fame.|$|E

5|$|Duchesne {{now called}} on Basil Orchard and Wilfred Boothroyd {{to counter the}} defence's evidence. Orchard, another doctor from Penetanguishene, testified that Lamb had {{suddenly}} abandoned any show of amnesia during an interview in August 1966. He saw no evidence that Lamb was insane {{and said that he}} was simply a young man with strong impulses who sometimes could not control them. Boothroyd, of Sunnybrook Hospital in Toronto, then spoke, arguing that Lamb had been acting out strong feelings <b>of</b> <b>anger</b> and bitterness and fully intended to kill the people he confronted, knowing and understanding what that meant. Lamb, he said, was capable of all kinds of emotion and was perfectly able {{to understand the nature of}} what he had done. Justice Stark intervened during Boothroyd's testimony, asking how he could give a reliable opinion on Lamb when he had never examined him. He also remarked that his opinion was contrary to every doctor who had testified so far.|$|E
5|$|During the match, she {{was knocked}} onto her right side, and {{her right arm}} became trapped {{underneath}} her wheelchair, causing a tendon in her elbow to rupture. Tracey Ferguson, the Canadian player who knocked her down tried to block the way for Australian officials to help her up. Carter lost considerable mobility in her right arm, and required an elbow reconstruction. She spent 11 weeks on a continuous passive motion machine getting treatment. Nine operations were required to treat the elbow. Because she had a pre-existing condition, the insurance company refused {{to pay for her}} treatment, although it paid her $7,500 in return for agreeing not to take legal action. Carter carried a lot <b>of</b> <b>anger</b> towards the Canadian in the first year following her accident. By 2004, she still could not fully flex her hand. Following her accident, she occasionally required the use of an electric wheelchair because of the severity of her injury, and needed the assistance of the Council's Home Care to clean her home. Before 2000, she had mostly been coached by national team coach Peter Corr.|$|E
5|$|During the pouring rain, a {{young boy}} helps {{his mother and father}} leave a heavily chained toy box at the {{doorstep}} of Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends with instructions to not be opened. The next day, Frankie has grown outraged about her job as the house caretaker; Mr. Herriman has been giving her endless chores to take care day after day without thanking her for any of it. When Frankie discovers the box left on the doorstep, Herriman instructs her to leave it in the attic. In a fit <b>of</b> <b>anger</b> toward Herriman, she intentionally ignores the instructions given in the box and peeks inside it. She falls inside, only to discover it is a vast world filled with anthropomorphic toys and delectable treats.
