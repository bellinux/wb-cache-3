25|$|The {{one that}} {{finished}} my career was when I got hit in my eye by John Maguire from Queensland...He got one to really rear up, and I {{got back to}} hook and it went between the visor and the top part of the helmet and smashed in my eye. That finished me. After that, I didn't want to be there. I thought of <b>other</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> wanted to do in life. Even though I continued playing on in Shield {{for two or three}} years, I just didn't want to be there.|$|E
25|$|Madonna {{approached}} me. We {{sat for a}} cup of tea {{and again}} {{for a cup of}} tea. Hopefully, it will all come together. I'm actually not familiar with her work, and I told her this flat-out. She sent a couple of films and I still haven't seen them... But no matter. I don't really go by that. I go by <b>other</b> <b>things.</b> <b>I</b> go by scripts. I go with what I think I can do with a character and if I feel a kinetic energy with someone and I feel we can uplift and challenge each other.|$|E
500|$|Smith had {{attempted}} to go to rehab several times, but {{found that he was}} unable to relate to the popular treatments for addicts that used a twelve-step program basis for treatment. [...] "I couldn't do the first step [...] I couldn't say what you were supposed to say and mean it." [...] In 2002, Smith went to the Neurotransmitter Restoration Center in Beverly Hills to start a course of treatment for his drug addiction. In one of his final interviews, he spoke about the center, [...] "What they do is an IV treatment where they put a needle in your arm, and you're on a drip bag, but the only thing that's in the drip bag is amino acids and saline solution. I was coming off of a lot of psych meds and <b>other</b> <b>things.</b> <b>I</b> was even on an antipsychotic, although I'm not psychotic." ...|$|E
6000|$|MRS. BARLOW. Only one <b>other</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> ask. If he must fight--and fight he must--let him alone: don't you try {{to shield}} him or save him. DON'T INTERFERE--do you hear? ...|$|R

500|$|Katrina Kaif {{was born}} in Hong Kong with her mother's surname Turquotte (also spelt Turcotte), on 16 July 1983. According to the actress, her father (Mohammed Kaif) is a British {{businessman}} of Kashmiri descent and her mother (Suzanne, also spelt Susanna) is an English lawyer and charity worker. She has seven siblings: three elder sisters (Stephanie, Christine, and Natasha), three younger sisters (Melissa, Sonia, and Isabel) and an elder brother, Michael. Isabelle Kaif is also a model and actress. Kaif's parents divorced {{when she was a}} child, and her father moved to the United States. She said her father had no influence on Kaif or her siblings while they were growing up, and they were raised by their mother. On her father's absence in her life, Kaif stated: [...] "When I see friends who have wonderful fathers who are like pillars of support for their families, I say, if only I had that. But instead of complaining, I should be grateful for all the <b>other</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> have". In a 2009 interview with The Indian Express, she said she was not in touch with her father.|$|E
500|$|Raleigh's {{co-pilot}} {{who lost}} her family in a Kaiju attack. Though Mori possesses a strength and fury that should serve well against the Kaiju, Pentecost is reluctant to use her, partly because of a fatherly bond and partly because he knows she is still fighting the terror of her childhood. Del Toro stated: [...] "I was very careful how I built the movie. One of the <b>other</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> decided was that I wanted a female lead who has the equal force as the male leads. She's {{not going to be}} a sex kitten, she's not going to come out in cutoff shorts and a tank top, and it's going to be a real earnestly drawn character." [...] Noting that the other actors were exhausted and [...] "destroyed physically" [...] by filming in the intensive Jaeger cockpit harnesses, del Toro said: [...] "The only one that didn't break was Rinko Kikuchi, the girl. She never complained… I asked Rinko her secret and she said 'I think of gummi bears and flowers.' I try to do that in my life now." [...] Mana Ashida plays Mako as a child.|$|E
2500|$|In early 2013, Thicke starred as a fictionalized {{version of}} himself {{alongside}} Kevin Hart, Boris Kodjoe, Nelly, Duane Martin, J.B. Smoove, Nick Cannon, and Cynthia McWilliams {{in the first}} season of BET's hit show Real Husbands of Hollywood. Thicke was unable to rejoin the cast for the shooting of the second season, opting instead to focus on his music. According to Thicke, [...] "Once the song started to take off, and all this momentum was happening, and [...] needed me for all eight weeks, I couldn't finish the album and promote the single and go over seas and do all these <b>other</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> wanted to do." ...|$|E

2500|$|In April 2011, Straw was {{appointed}} {{as a consultant}} to E. D. & F. Man Holdings Ltd., a British company based in London specialising in the production and trading of commodities including sugar, molasses, animal feed, tropical oils, biofuels, coffee and financial services. [...] Commenting on his appointment to ED Man on a salary of £30,000 per annum, Straw said, [...] "There are 168 hours in the week, and I will work in Blackburn for a least 60 and maybe sleep for 50. Providing there’s no conflict, I have long taken the view that I am not against people doing <b>other</b> <b>things.</b> <b>I</b> had two jobs as a minister. I think it's really important that politicians are involved with the outside world." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 20 April 2010, Ochoa {{released}} a statement indicating her intent to retire from professional golf. [...] At a press conference held in Mexico City on 23 April 2010, Ochoa said her last tournament would be the 2010 Tres Marias Championship to be played from 29 April through 2 May. She said that her career plan had always been to play for [...] "around ten years" [...] and to be the number 1 ranked player in the world. She also said: [...] "I {{just want to be}} honest with all of you. I went to Asia, and after two or three days of being in Thailand, it was really easy to me – it was really clear to see that I didn't want to be out there, you know. I just was thinking of <b>other</b> <b>things.</b> <b>I</b> wanted to get home. I wanted to start working on the foundation. I wanted to be here close to my family." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2003, the Redskins started 2–0 but {{finished}} 5–11, {{with several}} close losses {{coming down to}} the 4th quarter. The offense was a bit improved, but the departure of defensive coordinator Marvin Lewis to become the {{head coach of the}} Cincinnati Bengals saw the defense fade from 5th in scoring defense during the previous season to 24th in 2003. The team as a whole faded late in the season, and were outscored 85–31 over their last three games. Spurrier resigned on December 30, 2003, choosing to walk away from $15 million still owed to him over the remaining three years of his contract. In a statement released by the team, Spurrier said [...] "I apologize to Redskins fans that we did not reach a level of success that we had all hoped... It's a long grind and I feel (that) after 20 years as a head coach there are <b>other</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> need to do. I simply believe this is the right time for me to move on because this team needs new leadership." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "And there's {{just one}} <b>other</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> don't {{know much about}} {{morality}} and that, but there is this: It's always worth while before you do anything to consider whether it's going to hurt another person more than is absolutely necessary." ...|$|R
2500|$|Unappreciated {{features}} mainly hip hop and R tracks. During {{an interview}} about the album, {{when asked about}} its composition, the group said: [...] "You can expect a lot of realness, [...] we're trying to bring real R back to the world. Right now, R is not a genre anymore. It's pop, it's hip-hop, it's <b>other</b> <b>things.</b> <b>I</b> wanna bring back rhythm and blues." [...] During a different interview, the girls talked about how different this album was from their shelved debut: [...] "Well it's very different coming out now because with this album we have more creative control. When we came out in 2003, we were young and we didn't {{have much of a}} say in what went down. But this time around, we were able to write every song on the album, which makes this album very personal for all of us." [...] They later added on, [...] "From this album you can expect realness. Expect to hear all of our individual voices. A lot of crunk tracks like our first single 'Do It to It'. Also expect a lot of a cappella singing." ...|$|E
