25|$|In this fourth Edition I {{have made}} no {{alterations}} of any kind. I now, however, find myself at liberty to acknowledge my very great obligations to Mr. HENRY HOP of Amsterdam. To that Gentleman I owe the most distinct, as well as liberal information, concerning a very interesting and important subject, the Bank of Amsterdam; of which no printed account had ever appeared to me satisfactory, or even intelligible. The name of that Gentleman is so well known in Europe, the information which comes from him must do so much honour to whoever has been favoured with it, and my vanity is so much interested in making this acknowledgment, that I can no longer refuse myself the pleasure of prefixing this Advertisement to this new Edition <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>Book.</b>|$|E
500|$|In June 1862, Darwin welcomed {{favourable}} {{reviews in}} the press and wrote to Hooker; [...] "Well my orchis-book is a success (but I do not know whether it sells) after cursing my folly in writing it". He told his publisher, [...] "The Botanists praise my Orchid-book to the skies", and to Asa Gray he said, [...] "I am fairly astonished at the success <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>book</b> with botanists." [...] Darwin's geologist friend Charles Lyell gave it enthusiastic praise: [...] "next to the Origin, as the most valuable of all Darwin's works." [...] However, the book attracted little attention from the general public, and in September Darwin told his cousin Fox, [...] "Hardly any one not a botanist, except yourself, as far as I know, has cared for it." [...] The book baffled a general public more interested in controversy over gorillas and cavemen. There were some reviews in gardening magazines, but few natural philosophers or zoologists noticed the book, and hardly any learned appraisals appeared.|$|E
2500|$|Goldacre's first book, Bad Science, was {{published}} by Fourth Estate in September 2008. The book contains extended and revised versions {{of many of his}} Guardian columns. It was positively reviewed by the British Medical Journal (BMJ) and The Daily Telegraph, and reached the Top 10 bestseller list for Amazon Books. It was nominated for the 2009 Samuel Johnson Prize. In an interview in 2008, Goldacre said that [...] "one of the central themes <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>book</b> [...] is that there are no real differences between the $600 billion pharmaceutical industry and the $50 billion food supplement pill industry." ...|$|E

2500|$|In December 1859 the {{botanist}} Asa Gray {{negotiated with}} a Boston publisher for publication of an authorised American version, however, he learnt that two New York publishing firms were already planning {{to exploit the}} absence of international copyright to print Origin. Darwin wrote in January, [...] "I never dreamed <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>Book</b> being so successful with general readers: I believe I should have laughed {{at the idea of}} sending the sheets to America." [...] and asked Gray to keep any profits. Gray managed to negotiate a 5 per cent royalty with Appleton's of New York, who got their edition out in mid January, and the other two withdrew. In a May letter Darwin mentioned a print run of 2,500 copies, {{but it is not clear}} if this was the first printing alone as there were four that year.|$|E
2500|$|In France, intellectuals, {{because they}} had a chance of being {{published}} and could call on their “audience” to purchase their books, were able to express themselves on the subject of captivity. Their message, which naturally was not representative of all prisoners’ experiences, took several forms. Gaston Riou developed European themes in 1928 in his best-known work, Europe, ma patrie. The rapprochement with Germany that he outlined remained solely cultural, indeed superficial. Jacques Rivière, a prisoner since 24 August 1914, took an entirely different approach, developed in L’Allemand: “I must confess frankly: a relationship is described here, rather than an objective, rather than an appearance [...] The subject <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>book</b> is Franco-German antagonism”. Rivière developed a theory of economic rapprochement that would find fruition after the next world war: “Forgetfulness will develop, in Germany and here, if we know to organise industrial unity in the Rhine basin, if we know to harmoniously regulate trade there [...] There is all the same, in our current occupation of the Ruhr, with whatever intensity it has borne the Franco-German crisis, the foreshadowing of an equilibrium and a possible harmony between the two countries”.|$|E

5000|$|According to Goldman, [...] "the <b>book,</b> {{like most}} <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>books,</b> got crucified in {{hardcover}} {{and was a}} very, very successful book in paperback. Most of the books that I've written had their success in paperback." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "And rhythm is important," [...] Brodsky told book {{reviewer}} Ella Johnson, in a 2011 interview. [...] "Each <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>books</b> {{started as}} a poem. What I like about poetry is that it's very succinct. Each character in <b>my</b> <b>books</b> comes from either something someone has said to me or something I’ve seen." ...|$|R
5000|$|Various {{attempts}} at a film adaption of White Jazz {{have been under}} development since the 1990s. But as of 2009, Ellroy said that an adaptation of [...] "White Jazz is dead. All movie adaptations <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>books</b> are dead." ...|$|R

60|$|I {{very very}} rarely make {{presents}} <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>books.</b> If people {{are inclined to}} learn from them, I say to them as a physician would--Pay me my fee--you will not obey me if I give you advice for nothing.|$|R
5000|$|In 1971 Smith {{wrote to}} Klinger that, [...] "It is now {{becoming}} critical that somebody start making films out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>books.</b> This {{is essential for}} my career - which really needs a good film to take off in the Alistair Maclean class." ...|$|R

60|$|I have a {{plan for}} my own bedroom. I spend long hours in bed, reading, studying, and working.

So my bedroom shall be indoors.|$|E
5000|$|In a 1990 {{interview}} in The Austrian Economics Newsletter Rothbard {{was asked about}} the reception to the book and said it was well received, [...] "In fact, much better than any other <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>books.</b> Maybe that's because I didn't analyze the causes.

According to his website: [...] "After a {{lifetime}} of denial, I finally began to accept my homosexuality — a process made even more difficult by my religious fundamentalist background and mindset.

60|$|My resolve {{proved a}} wise one; for since the {{appearance}} <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>book,</b> {{a surprising number}} of papers and separate works on the fertilisation of all kinds of flowers have appeared: and these are far better done than I could possibly have effected.

60|$|Walkirk {{very soon}} {{discovered}} that I had no intention whatever of giving up the writing <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>book,</b> and I quieted the fears of my grandmother, in regard to my health, by assuring her that the sedentary work connected with the production of my volume would not be done by me.

60|$|Thou dost {{also here}} speak falsely of me, {{for all that}} I take in hand to prove, is this, that they hold a false opinion (and {{principles}} too) who hold up a Christ within, in opposition to Christ without, who is the Saviour; as doth plainly appear by my following discourse, if you read from page 203 to the end <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>book.</b>|$|E
