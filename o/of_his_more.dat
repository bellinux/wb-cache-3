5|$|Bernoulli's work, {{originally}} published in Latin is divided into four parts. It covers most notably his theory of permutations and combinations; the standard foundations of combinatorics today and subsets of the foundational problems today known as the twelvefold way. It also discusses the motivation and applications of a sequence of numbers {{more closely related to}} number theory than probability; these Bernoulli numbers bear his name today, and are one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>more</b> notable achievements.|$|E
5|$|Bruce and Hughes clashed in both {{style and}} ideology. Bruce found Hughes' {{management}} of the government capricious and chaotic, and felt little was accomplished in Cabinet or in party meetings so long as Hughes headed them. But {{he served as a}} strong counterweight to the domineering Hughes, resisting several <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>more</b> expensive proposals or acting as the voice of reason to talk Hughes down from several <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>more</b> outlandish ideas. His tenure would ultimately be short, presiding over just one budget in 1922, which was conservative and tax-cutting. The Opposition criticised the budget for its failure to limit rising government spending and indebtedness. The budget included many concessions to rural interests and the recently formed Country Party, which appeared as a major threat to Nationalist Party dominance going into the 1922 elections in December. Yet Bruce endeared himself to many of his colleagues with his amiable personal style, his forceful voice in Cabinet against Hughes, and his conservative views, which were more in line with the majority of the party.|$|E
5|$|General Howe, after {{consolidating}} British positions around New York harbor, detached 6,000 {{men under}} the command of two <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>more</b> difficult subordinates, Henry Clinton, and Hugh, Earl Percy to take Newport, Rhode Island (which they did without opposition on December 8), while he sent General Lord Cornwallis to chase Washington's army through New Jersey. The Americans withdrew across the Delaware River into Pennsylvania in early December.|$|E

5|$|I {{leave it}} with this House with every confidence. I am equal to either fortune. I can see past the {{decision}} of this House either for or against me, but whether it be against me or for me, I know, {{and it is no}} vain boast to say so, for even my enemies will admit that I am no boaster, that there does not exist in Canada a man who has given <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> time, <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> heart, <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> wealth, or <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> intellect and power, as it may be, for the good of this Dominion of Canada.|$|R
5|$|In 1935 he {{made his}} film debut, {{appearing}} in The Riverside Murder (dir. Albert Parker); he appeared in four films that year, and five the following. His film career progressed and by the mid 1940s he was a well-known figure in the theatre and cinema. The Times highlighted some <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>more</b> notable films, including Green for Danger (1946), The Happiest Days of Your Life (1950), Scrooge (1951), An Inspector Calls (1954), The Green Man (1956) and School for Scoundrels (1960).|$|E
5|$|Zoologists have {{frequently}} mocked Aristotle for errors and unverified secondhand reports. However, modern observation has confirmed {{one after another}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>more</b> surprising claims, including the active camouflage of the octopus {{and the ability of}} elephants to snorkel with their trunks while swimming. The evolutionary zoologist Armand Leroi has taken an interest in Aristotle's biology.|$|E
5|$|Adud al-Dawla, {{in order}} to {{maintain}} peace, established marriage ties with several rulers; his daughter was married to the Abbasid caliph at-Ta'i, while another was married to the Samanids and the Ziyarid ruler Bisutun. Adud al-Dawla himself had several wives, which included; the daughter of Bisutun; the daughter of Manadhar, an Justanid king; and the daughter of Siyahgil, an Giilite king. From these wives, Adud al-Dawla had several sons; Abu'l-Husain Ahmad and Abu Tahir Firuzshah, from the daughter of Manadhar; Abu Kalijar Marzuban, from the daughter of Siyahgil; and Shirdil Abu'l-Fawaris, from a Turkic concubine. Adud al-Dawla also had a younger son named Baha' al-Dawla. Abu'l-Husain Ahmad was supported by his mother and his uncle Fuladh ibn Manadhar as the heir of the Buyid Empire. However, Abu Kalijar Marzuban, because <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>more</b> prominent descent, was appointed as heir of the Buyid Empire by Adud al-Dawla.|$|E

5|$|Benchley re-entered Hollywood at {{the height}} of the Great Depression and the {{large-scale}} introduction of the talkie films he had begun working with years before. His arrival put him on the scene of a number of productions almost instantly. While Benchley was more interested in writing than acting, one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>more</b> important roles as an actor was as a salesman in Rafter Romance, and his work attracted the interest of MGM, who offered Benchley a lot of money to complete a series of short films. Benchley, who had also been offered a syndicated column by Hearst, was able to film the shorts in New York and keep up with his new column. Before heading back to New York, Benchley took a role in the feature film Dancing Lady (1933), which also featured Joan Crawford, Clark Gable, Fred Astaire, Nelson Eddy, and the Three Stooges.|$|E
5|$|Due to the lord's {{presence}} in a castle, it was a centre of administration from where he controlled his lands. He relied on the support of those below him, as without the support <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>more</b> powerful tenants a lord could expect his power to be undermined. Successful lords regularly held court with those immediately below them on the social scale, but absentees could expect to find their influence weakened. Larger lordships could be vast, {{and it would be}} impractical for a lord to visit all his properties regularly so deputies were appointed. This especially applied to royalty, who sometimes owned land in different countries.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his return}} to Schalke, Holtby was named in the {{starting}} line-up for the 2011 Supercup on 23 July and scored the first penalty in a penalty shoot-out victory over Dortmund. He scored his first goal for the club the following month, netting Schalke's third in a 5–1 league win over Köln. Having previously played as an attacking fielder and winger, Holtby was converted to a deeper role under new manager Ralf Rangnick due to Spanish legend Raúl occupying the more advanced attacking position in the team. In spite <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>more</b> defensive role, Holtby managed to record a career best tally of nine goals for the season across 41 appearances, helping Schalke finish the campaign in fifth position {{in the league and}} as semi-finalists in the Champions League.|$|E

5|$|For the 2007–08 season, {{with the}} likes of Florent Malouda, John Carew and Sylvain Wiltord all departing from the club, Benzema {{switched}} to the number 10 shirt and was inserted into the lead striker role. After forming a special relationship with new manager Alain Perrin, he responded with 31 goals in 51 games. He topped the league with 20 goals, scored four goals in the Champions League, one in the Coupe de la Ligue and totaled six goals in six Coupe de France matches, helping Lyon win their first ever double. Some <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>more</b> dazzling performances that season included a hat-trick against Metz on 15 September, an equalizing goal in the 90th minute from a free kick against Derby du Rhône rivals Saint-Étienne, and a goal against Lens that was nominated for goal of the season by fans.|$|E
5|$|Hancock did {{not long}} survive his electoral opponent. After the election, he {{remained}} on duty as {{commander of the}} Division of the Atlantic. He attended Garfield's inauguration and served loyally under him and Arthur. In 1885, he visited the Gettysburg battlefield, the site of his most famous triumph two decades earlier. Hancock died the following year, after an abscess in his leg became infected. Weaver survived both <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>more</b> popular opponents, returning to Congress for {{four years in the}} 1880s, and running for president again as the nominee of the Populist Party in 1892.|$|E
5|$|Heaphy {{painted a}} variety of {{subjects}} including landscapes, flora and fauna and notable Māori, including the chieftain Te Rauparaha. The success of the company depended on attracting emigrants to New Zealand so his work was almost always intended to present the country and its inhabitants in its best light. Heaphy was at times exposed to some danger; on an expedition to the Chatham Islands, his party intervened in a skirmish between two warring tribes and he {{was wounded in the}} leg. It was unlikely to have been a serious wound for a few weeks later, he went on a trek back in New Zealand to the Taranaki Region, where he produced some <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>more</b> notable landscapes.|$|E

5|$|Johnson's first leading film {{role was}} in The Scorpion King in 2002. For this, {{he was paid}} US$5.5 million, a world record for an actor in his first {{starring}} role. One <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>more</b> prominent roles is Luke Hobbs in The Fast and the Furious franchise. Johnson hosted and produced The Hero, a reality competition series and has since continued to produce TV shows and films through his production company Seven Bucks Productions. In 2013, Forbes listed Johnson No. 25 in the Top 100 Most Powerful Celebrities {{and has been in}} the top twenty every year since. He was the world's highest-paid actor of 2016. Time named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2016.|$|E
5|$|Mendelssohn enjoyed {{early success}} in Germany, {{where he also}} revived {{interest}} in the music of Johann Sebastian Bach, and in his travels throughout Europe. He was particularly well received in Britain as a composer, conductor and soloist, and his ten visits there– during which many of his major works were premiered– form {{an important part of}} his adult career. His essentially conservative musical tastes set him apart from many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>more</b> adventurous musical contemporaries such as Franz Liszt, Richard Wagner, Charles-Valentin Alkan and Hector Berlioz. The Leipzig Conservatoire (now the University of Music and Theatre Leipzig), which he founded, became a bastion of this anti-radical outlook.|$|E
5|$|On {{the right}} wing of the Republican party, some of Goldwater's {{political}} positions included anti-communism, an emphasis on total victory in war and opposition to high taxes and government spending. He often criticized the politics of some <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>more</b> moderate contemporaries, including President Dwight D. Eisenhower. He criticized some aspects of Eisenhower's economic policy, citing his failure to balance the federal budget. After being written off as too right-wing to successfully wage a presidential campaign, Goldwater actively supported Richard Nixon's campaign against John F. Kennedy in the 1960 presidential election.|$|E

50|$|Cheik Ledy was apprenticed to his elder brother, sign painter Chéri Samba, {{after leaving}} school in 1977, {{and worked as}} Samba's {{assistant}} for 10 years in his Kinshasa studio. Like Samba, Ledy’s paintings comment on social and political issues <b>of</b> <b>his</b> day. <b>His</b> <b>more</b> controversial work included sign paintings on condom use and labour. He died of AIDS-related complications in 1997 in Kinshasa.|$|R
5|$|The 20,000-man right (north) wing under Duke Ferdinand Frederick Augustus of Württemberg {{stood on}} the east bank of the Rhine behind the Sieg River, observing the French {{bridgehead}} at Düsseldorf. A portion patrolled {{the west bank and}} behind the Nahe River. The Mainz Fortress and Ehrenbreitstein Fortress garrisons totaled about 10,000 more, including 2,600 at Ehrenbreitstein. Charles concentrated the bulk of his force, commanded by one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>more</b> experienced generals, Count Baillet Latour, between Karlsruhe and Darmstadt, where the confluence of the Rhine and the Main made an attack most likely; the rivers offered a gateway into eastern German states and ultimately to Vienna, with good bridges crossing a relatively well-defined river bank. A force occupied Kaiserslautern on the west bank. Wilhelm von Wartensleben's autonomous corps covered the line between Mainz and Giessen.|$|E
5|$|The Dawn of Love, {{also known}} as Venus Now Wakes, and Wakens Love, is an oil {{painting}} on canvas by English artist William Etty, first exhibited in 1828 and currently in the Russell-Cotes Art Gallery & Museum in Bournemouth. Loosely based on a passage from John Milton's 1634 masque Comus, it shows a nude Venus leaning across to wake the sleeping Love by stroking his wings. While Etty often included nude figures in his work he rarely depicted physical intimacy, and owing to this The Dawn of Love is one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>more</b> unusual paintings. The open sensuality of the work was intended to present {{a challenge to the}} viewer mirroring the plot of Comus, in which the heroine is tempted by desire but remains rational and detached.|$|E
5|$|White {{was one of}} two {{physicians}} {{practicing in}} Frederick County along with Daniel Hart (died about 1748). White practiced from his residence near Great North Mountain, and one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>more</b> notable patients was Colonel James Wood, founder of Winchester, Virginia. White's son Alexander married Wood's daughter, Elizabeth Wood. White was part a larger wave of Scottish physicians who settled in Virginia prior to the American Revolutionary War. White's alma mater, the University of Edinburgh, was a leading center of medical education and research, and the school trained more physicians than were needed in Scotland. Unlike White, the majority of Scottish physicians practiced in the main centers of population in the colonial port cities.|$|E
