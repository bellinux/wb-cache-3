5|$|In a {{study on}} the {{different}} motivations of walkthrough viewers conducted by Max Sjöblom and Juho Hamari from the University of Tampere in 2016, numerous viewer motivations were discussed. From the findings, the five the most significant motivations were found to be improving player experience, confidence, knowledge about a particular game, socializing and creating an 'escape' or distraction from their everyday life. Walkthroughs may also guide players throughout an entire game or <b>only</b> <b>certain</b> sections and may be guides on finding rare collectables or unlocking achievements.|$|E

It adjoins a substantial wall that may also have origins in the 13th century. The other garden walls have unknown dates of origin but mostly pre-date around 1730, when the stables were built. All of the other buildings, including the lodge at the South entrance (1851) are Georgian or Victorian.

5|$|Iridium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Ir and atomic number 77. A very hard, brittle, silvery-white transition metal of the platinum group, iridium is generally credited {{with being the}} second densest element (after osmium). It {{is also the most}} corrosion-resistant metal, even at temperatures as high as 2000°C. Although <b>only</b> <b>certain</b> molten salts and halogens are corrosive to solid iridium, finely divided iridium dust is much more reactive and can be flammable.|$|E
5|$|Spot welding is {{a popular}} {{resistance}} welding method used to join overlapping metal sheets of up to 3mm thick. Two electrodes are simultaneously used to clamp the metal sheets together and to pass current through the sheets. The advantages of the method include efficient energy use, limited workpiece deformation, high production rates, easy automation, and no required filler materials. Weld strength is significantly lower than with other welding methods, making the process suitable for <b>only</b> <b>certain</b> applications. It is used extensively in the automotive industry—ordinary cars can have several thousand spot welds made by industrial robots. A specialized process, called shot welding, {{can be used to}} spot weld stainless steel.|$|E

5|$|Terrain {{played a}} {{significant}} role in operations around Narva. The elevation above sea level rarely rises above 100 meters in the area and the land is cut by numerous waterways, including the Narva and Plyussa Rivers. The bulk of the land in the region is forested and large swamps inundate areas of low elevation. The effect of the terrain on operations was one of channelization; because of the swamps, <b>only</b> <b>certain</b> areas were suitable for large-scale troop movement.|$|E
5|$|Up to {{this point}} in the tour Wolfgang appears to have done little composition. The Accademia Filarmonica concert in Mantua had {{included}} much improvisation but little of Wolfgang's own music; the <b>only</b> <b>certain</b> compositions from this phase of the tour are the arias composed for the final Firmian concert, which sealed his contract for the carnival opera. These are Se tutti i mali miei, K.83/73p, Misero me, K.77/73e, and Ah più tremar..., K.71. The Symphony in G, K.74, evidently completed in Rome in April, may have been started in Milan.|$|E
5|$|Cubs start {{following}} their mothers at six weeks. The mother frequently shifts the cubs to new locations. A study of play behaviour of cheetah cubs showed that cubs tend to play after nursing or {{while they are}} on the move with their mothers. Play involves plenty of agility; attacks are seldom lethal. Playing cubs stay near their mothers. The study further revealed that while the cubs showed improvement in catching each other as they grew up, the ability to crouch and hide did not develop remarkably. Thus, it was suggested that play helps develop <b>only</b> <b>certain</b> aspects of predator defence. Weaning occurs at three to six months of age. The mother brings kills to her cubs; the cubs might purr as the mother licks them clean after the meal. Cubs as young as six months try to capture small prey like hares and juvenile gazelles. However, they may have to wait until as long as 15 months of age to make a successful kill on their own.|$|E

HDMI 1.2 and all later versions allow any arbitrary resolution and frame rate (within the bandwidth limit); any formats that are {{not supported by the}} HDMI Specification (i.e. no standardized timings defined) may be implemented as a vendor-specific format. Although successive versions of the HDMI Specification continue to add support for additional formats (such as 4K resolutions), the added support is to establish standardized timings to ensure interoperability between products, not to establish what formats are and aren't permitted, and video formats do not require explicit support from the HDMI Specification in order to be displayed.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, McEwan's {{acquired}} {{the trade and}} goodwill of Alexander Melvin & Co of central Edinburgh. By 1914, McEwan's bottled beers were distributed across the United Kingdom. In December 1930, McEwan's merged with Edinburgh rival William Younger's Brewery to form Scottish Brewers in a defensive move after the Great Depression diminished revenues. Each entity was initially run separately, and <b>only</b> <b>certain</b> financial and technological resources were amalgamated. During this period the company became an early pioneer of container beer, largely due to its dependence on exports, particularly to the Royal Navy, where beer might be stored on board ships {{for up to a}} year. The NAAFI continued to be an important McEwan's customer throughout the century. In the early 1930s, Jardine Matheson approached the company regarding a potential brewing venture in China, but McEwan's did not welcome the threat to their export business.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, the Beti {{at large}} detested French forced labour {{practices}} and taxes. Some people {{fled to the}} bush before the tax collector arrived; others circumvented taxes by counting wives as out-of-town visitors or waiting {{until the last minute}} to pay and thus reducing the collector's cut of the tax money. If the taxes were not collected to the satisfaction of the colonial administrators, Atangana himself was expected to make up some of the difference. To counter these minor rebellions, chiefs could punish their subjects with 15 days in jail or 100 franc fines without due process of law. This was meant to be reserved for <b>only</b> <b>certain</b> infractions, but Atangana and other chiefs interpreted it broadly to include all sorts of difficult behaviour. Atangana and his sub-chiefs were expected to discipline such difficult subjects. He exerted continual pressure on the sub-chiefs, who in turn placed constant pressure on the villagers to pay taxes and supply labourers.|$|E

5|$|Officials {{of other}} leagues {{took note of}} the {{financial}} boon that followed SEC expansion to twelve teams. Atlantic Coast Conference representatives began discussing expansion to twelve schools {{in the first years}} of the new century, who began publicly pursuing the possibility of expansion anew in 2003. On May 13, 2003, representatives voted in favor of extending invitations to three schools. The <b>only</b> <b>certain</b> school was the University of Miami, while the other two spots were still being debated. Initially, the league favored admitting Miami, Syracuse University, and Boston College. After a month of debate, however, the ACC elected to extend formal invitations to Miami, Boston College, and Virginia Tech, which joined after initially being overlooked. This came years after these schools were considered for ACC membership in the early 1990s but nothing had ever came to fruition. Pittsburgh and Syracuse would also eventually join the ACC after rejections in 1990 and 2003, becoming members in 2013.|$|E
5|$|Precautions {{were taken}} to prevent secrets from the season finale being revealed; <b>only</b> <b>certain</b> staff members were {{provided}} with copies of the episode, which were given on watermarked DVDs and distributed to secret hiding places. The writers wanted Michael {{to have a big}} plan to get Holly back, but to realize throughout {{the course of the day}} that his relationship with Holly was something special and that he did not want to disrupt it; they felt it showed that Michael had become more mature, calm and confident about this relationship than that of Jan Levinson and others in his past. The first scene with Michael and Holly discussing their sketch possibilities in a secluded area was filmed with three cameras: one focusing on each side of the two actors, and one from the front of both of them to establish that the picnic was still going on behind them. Due to space limitations, the latter angle was filmed through a mirror (with the actors appearing to be opposite sides) and then the image was reversed and undistorted in post-production.|$|E
5|$|The addax live {{in desert}} terrain where they eat grasses and leaves of what shrubs, leguminous herbs and bushes are available.

Perennials which turn green and sprout at the {{slightest}} bit of humidity or rain. The addax eat <b>only</b> <b>certain</b> parts of the plant and tend to crop the Aristida grasses neatly to the same height. By contrast, when feeding on Panicum grass, the drier outer leaves are left alone while they eat the tender, inner shoots and seeds. These seeds are important part of the addax diet, being their main source of protein.|$|E
