Computer scientists also study other models of computation including parallel computers (more than <b>one</b> deterministic <b>step</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time), and quantum computers (which are based on non-deterministic quantum mechanical models). Computer systems or programs are often described as non-deterministic if their behavior depends on factors that cannot be predicted or reliably reproduced, such {{as the time of}} day or the speed at which the user enters data at the keyboard.

25|$|A* is an {{informed}} search algorithm, or a best-first search, {{meaning that it}} solves problems by searching among all possible paths to the solution (goal) for the one that incurs the smallest cost (least distance travelled, shortest time, etc.), and among these paths it first considers the ones that appear to lead most quickly to the solution. It is formulated in terms of weighted graphs: starting from a specific node of a graph, it constructs a tree of paths starting from that node, expanding paths <b>one</b> <b>step</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time, until one of its paths ends at the predetermined goal node.|$|E
25|$|An unmoved pawn {{can move}} one step, {{up to the}} middle of the board (in the case of the 16×16 board, the eighth rank), or {{anything}} in between. Thus, 1.i8 is a legal opening move, and so are 1.i3, 1.i4, 1.i5, 1.i6, and 1.i7. Once it has moved for the first time, it can only make <b>one</b> <b>step</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time. (In the case of an 8×8 board, this is exactly the same as in standard chess). Such a long initial pawn move allows the moving pawn to be captured en passant by an enemy pawn as if it had stopped on any one of the squares it had passed through.|$|E

40|$|SURFACES+NSPEnvironmental {{problems}} related {{to the use of}} fossil fuels and the development of new technologies for energy production from hydrogen have renewed the interest for the water gas shift reaction (WGSR). For several years, the WGSR has been used to eliminate carbon monoxide from hydrogen-rich streams produced during natural gas reforming, as well as to increase hydrogen production. For reasons of economy, in industrial processes the reaction is carried out in two <b>steps</b> <b>at</b> different temperatures. There is, however, interest to develop catalysts able to operate <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>step</b> <b>at</b> intermediate temperatures. In a previous work, we had found that nickel-based catalysts prepared from hydrotalcite-like precursors were promising for WGSR in a single step. In the present work, the influence of the nickel amount on the properties of the catalysts was investigated, in order to find the best formulation for these catalysts. The samples were prepared by precipitation techniques and characterized by chemical analysis, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, specific surface area and porosity measurements, temperature programmed reduction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The catalysts were evaluated in WGSR at 1 atm and at different temperatures. During the heating of hydrotalcite-like precursors, aluminum cations were incorporated into the nickel oxide lattice, hindering the reduction of this oxide; however, the addition of zinc decreased this effect. The existing interaction between nickel oxide and alumina (gamma-Al 2 O 3) is comforted by the observation of Moire fringes caused by the interference of crystallographic planes of both phases. All catalysts were active in the WGSR but the nickel-richest ones also produced methane, this effect being diminished or prevented by the addition of zinc to the catalysts. No simple relationship was found between nickel amount and the activity or selectivity of the catalysts probably due to the different interactions among the metals at different reaction temperatures. The most efficient catalyst was obtained by heating the N(0. 37) Z(0 37) A(0. 25) hydrotalcite, which produces a solid able to work in WGSR in <b>one</b> <b>step</b> <b>at</b> <b>an</b> intermediate temperature (300 degrees C) leading to 100 % of carbon monoxide conversion without producing methane.

30|$|The {{compression}} {{scheme of}} Zhao et al. [9] works similarly to zfp on spatio-temporal data, providing large compression ratios and fast decompression speeds {{but it is}} also limited to regular grid data. However, our CS approach compresses unstructured data and we expect to obtain compression ratios up to two orders of magnitude while keeping a reasonable accuracy in the reconstructed results. A very recent effort in scientific data compression relies on the Tucker tensor decomposition [10] {{to reduce the size of}} a large dataset gathered from different time steps, variables and computing nodes. Tucker compression results in compression ratios up to three orders of magnitudes, but it is unclear how it would perform in situ for data generated <b>at</b> <b>one</b> time <b>step</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time. Furthermore, this technique is applicable only on regular grids and it is not clear how it would adapt to unstructured meshes.
