30|$|This paper {{proposes a}} blind data hiding {{approach}} which has improved imperceptibility of the embedded <b>information</b> <b>data</b> {{as well as}} high capacity. The proposed method {{is a relatively new}} approach for two reasons. First, the Fresnelet transform is employed for scrambling the <b>information</b> image <b>data</b> with different distance parameters as keys, while maintaining the overall energy of the <b>information</b> <b>data</b> in the form of dummy complex data to be embedded in the cover image <b>data.</b> Second, the <b>information</b> <b>data</b> is extracted blindly in the extraction phase without the need of the original cover image data. Furthermore, our proposed method is useful for maintaining reasonable perceptual transparency of an information embedded image with large capacity of <b>information</b> <b>data.</b>|$|R

In communication system <b>information</b> <b>data</b> is transferred from source to destination through channel. In between, source and destination, data may be corrupted due to any type of noise. To find original information we use Hamming code error detection and correction technique. In hamming code error detection and correction technique, to get error free data at destination, we encrypt <b>information</b> <b>data</b> according to even and odd parity method before transmission of information at source end. In this project 14 bit <b>Information</b> <b>data</b> {{is divided into two}} groups of 7 bit data. After this division each group is encrypted using four Redundancy bit. In this way 14 bit <b>information</b> <b>data</b> at sender end is now converted into two groups of 11 bit data (with redundant bits). Both groups are joined to make total 22 bit <b>Information</b> <b>data.</b> At Receiver end 22 bit <b>information</b> <b>data</b> in divided into two groups of 11 bit data and each group is detected and corrected using even and odd parity check method.

3000|$|With the {{numerical}} simulation, we empirically analyze {{the choice of}} the scaling factor α. Since the scaling factor is weighting value for the <b>information</b> <b>data,</b> the different values of α in the range of 0 – 1 are affecting the quality of the information embedded image and the CC value of the extracted <b>information</b> <b>data.</b> In our simulation, we use the values α = 0.03, [...] 0.04, [...] 0.05, [...] 0.06, [...] 0.07 [...] that give a consistent result of PSNR and CC values as shown in Fig.  7. In this case, we employ four benchmark cover image data: Cameraman, Peppers, Elaine, Lena with size 512  ×  512 and two benchmark information image data: USAF, DDNT <b>information</b> <b>data</b> with 256  ×  256. Note that as increasing the scaling factor, the PSNRs of the information embedded images are decreasing and the CC values of the extracted <b>information</b> <b>data</b> are increasing and shown in Fig.  7.

30|$|Note {{that there}} is a {{trade-off}} between the capacity of an embedded <b>information</b> <b>data</b> {{and the quality of the}} information embedded image (Lin and Zhang 2012). For our proposed method, the capacity of an embedded <b>information</b> <b>data</b> is approximately twice as big as that of the <b>information</b> embedded <b>data.</b> Thanks to the diffusion process of the Fresnelet transform applied to the <b>information</b> <b>data,</b> we can generate a coded data with almost uniformly scattered structure (Nazeer et al. 2013; Zhou et al. 2014) as shown in Figs.  1, 5, which would be embedded into a cover image with keeping good quality of the <b>information</b> embedded <b>data.</b> While, for most of other existing techniques (Wu et al. 2005; Ashourian and Ho 2005; Chen et al. 2010; Chang et al. 2006; Yang 2010; Tian 2003; Chen and Huang 2014; Lin and Zhang 2012; Kamstra and Heijmans 2005; Luo et al. 2010), the <b>information</b> <b>data</b> of small capacity is hidden in a cover image data without any diffusion process as shown in Table  2 and Fig.  6. Since it is not possible to simultaneously maximize the robustness or imperceptiveness of the <b>information</b> embedded <b>data</b> and the capacity of the <b>information</b> <b>data</b> image, therefore an adequate balance of these two features for a specific application (Chen et al. 2010; Chang et al. 2006; Yang 2010; Chen and Huang 2014) is developed. In this regard, a data hiding method would forgo the low imperceptibility and the robustness in favor of large capacity of the embedded image (Nazeer and Kim 2012). On the other hand, an invisible watermarking method, which may not contain large capacity of a watermark, would definitely favor the high imperceptibility and the robustness of the embedded image (Wu et al. 2005; Huang et al. 2011; Shang 2011, 2015).|$|R
