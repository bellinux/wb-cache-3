40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the influence of practice and training on fine-motor flying skills during a manual instrument landing system (ILS) approach. Background: There is an ongoing debate that manual flying skills of long-haul crews suffer from a lack of flight practice due to conducting only a few flights per month and the intensive use of automation. However, objective evidence is rare. Method: One hundred twenty-six randomly selected airline pilots had to perform a manual flight scenario with a raw data precision approach. Pilots were assigned to four equal groups according to their level of practice and training by fleet (short-haul, longhaul) and rank (first officer, captain). Results: Average ILS deviation scores differed significantly in relation to the group assignments. The strongest predictor variable was fleet, indicating degraded performance among long-haul pilots. Conclusion: Manual flying skills are subject to erosion due to a lack of practice on long-haul fleets: All results support the conclusion that recent flight practice is a significantly stronger predictor for fine-motor flying performance than the time period since flight school or even the total or type-specific flight experience. Application: Long-haul crews have to be supported in a timely manner by adequate training tailored to address manual skills or by <b>operational</b> <b>provisions</b> like mixed-fleet flying or more frequent transitions between short-haul and long-haul operation...|$|E

Is this a valued and unambiguous role {{that should be}} carried forward when the new PQ framework starts in 2006 or is it one that should be questioned and analysed? This study explores whether mentoring could be used within the new PQ framework, by considering the results of ten semistructured in-depth interviews with managers and academics involved in the strategic and <b>operational</b> <b>provision</b> of PQSW in the Advance PQ Consortium. A {{review of the literature}} showed the value of mentoring and details of the outgoing PQ mentor role. It is concluded that the expectations of the new workplace assessor role are apt, including the skills of mentoring and coaching, which are taught on new PQ courses. It is recommended that generic mentoring schemes, whereby one person assists a less experienced individual to focus on his or her personal and professional development should be available within social care agencies for all social workers as part of a human resource strategy. It is suggested that mentoring and assessment roles should be included and remunerated within social workers' job descriptions. Moreover, this would formalise social workers' contribution to their and others continuous professional and personal development, support the new PQ framework, the GSCC Codes of Practice (2002) and contribute to staff retention...|$|R

40|$|Report in French and English. This paper {{examines}} the roles, responsibilities and {{interactions between the}} various formal and informal institutions and stakeholders involved {{in the management of}} police services in the DRC. It identifies informal networks that influence decision-making processes and policy implementation, and provides an analysis of interactions between the Congolese population and national and international actors. It also aims to highlight both horizontal and vertical accountability mechanisms within the existing legal framework, setting out to identify any legal gaps and contradictions, which could explain overlapping mandates. The study provides interesting geographical and administrative data on national security systems, and uses a multidimensional governance approach to understand the complexity of the security sector and the interconnectedness between the relevant actors. The study concludes that stakeholders of the security and police sectors of the DRC are linked together in a web of complex and dynamic systems, characterised by discrepancies between theory and practice. It is inaccurate to think of these systems and mechanisms as working either in opposition to one another or in parallel. In fact, these systems intertwine more than they conflict, and there are significant overlaps and confusion with regard to the mandates of the existing institutions, structures and actors involved. All security services in the DRC possess a legal framework within which they must operate. The legal contradictions and loopholes identified in this paper are often the result of dubious interpretations, or even deliberate misinterpretations of existing <b>operational</b> <b>provisions</b> underlying the functioning of security services. The research concludes that there is very poor coordination between the various actors and institutions involved in the management of security services in the DRC. This creates a dysfunctional structure characterised by a culture of impunity, with only a semblance of autonomy and independence among actors, but never with regard to senior civil servants in charge of coordination.

40|$|This thesis empirically investigates {{how well}} the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) ensures value for money (VfM) in its {{exploitation}} of Nigeria’s oil resources. This focus on VfM distinguishes the study from other researches carried out {{on the performance of}} national oil companies (NOCs) where the common approach in the literature has been to assess performance using the metrics applicable to private oil companies. The rationale for the new approach is that the NNPC is a quasi-public sector organisation and thus its performance should be measured {{in the same way as}} that of public sector bodies and state owned enterprises (SOEs). Informed opinions on NNPC’s management roles in Nigeria’s oil and gas upstream sector were sought from a range of relevant experts in twelve stakeholder groups involved in oil and gas upstream operations. Data were collected through the use of questionnaire and interview surveys, and further subjected to statistical analysis to determine and assess significant differences in views between respondent groups. The empirical results obtained from the questionnaires were used to draw a conclusion on the hypotheses formulated for the study. Furthermore, the findings of the interview survey were used to validate the conclusions drawn. The study revealed that the NNPC was perceived to be deficient in keeping its mandate of adding value to Nigeria’s hydrocarbon resources. In specific terms, the respondents were of the view that NNPC has not been able to ensure VfM in its operations because of defects in its organisational structure, administrative system, and accountability. External factors such as political interference, instability and an inappropriate legal framework against which NNPC operates have also been perceived to impede the corporation’s performance. The main conclusions were: firstly, it is argued that the use of conventional private sector metrics to evaluate the performance of NOCs makes it difficult to form an appropriate view on their performance. Secondly, NOCs with numerous conflicting roles as is the case with NNPC are unlikely to achieve satisfactory performance. Thirdly, the NNPC lacks the capability required to ensure multinational oil companies’ (MOC) conformity with <b>operational</b> <b>provisions</b> and best practice. Finally, the thesis concludes that establishing a standardised performance/benchmarking framework is an essential requirement to ensure value addition, VfM and accountability in Nigeria’s oil and gas operations.

40|$|The TerraSAR-X Mission started <b>operational</b> <b>provision</b> of SAR image {{products}} to the scientific and commercial user community in January 2008. An essential prerequisite for the excellent quality of the SAR products was the successful execution of a comprehensive commissioning phase (CP) in 2007. Here, the complete SAR system which comprises instrument commanding, instrument SAR data acquisition as well as SAR processing has been characterized, calibrated and verified. Finally SAR image product verification ensured that the product performance parameters are within the specification. Besides the versatile high-resolution X-Band SAR instrument in space, featuring Stripmap, ScanSAR and Spotlight imaging modes in different polarizations, the TerraSAR Multi-Mode SAR Processor (TMSP) is {{the central part of}} the ground segment. Most instrument and SAR calibration parameters have been derived on basis of SAR image products generated by the TMSP. Therefore, already in the beginning of the CP the products had to be relatively radiometric calibrated and geometrical undistorted. An indispensable prerequisite for this was the imaging mode independent normalization of the processor gain as well as the incorporation of external information, i. e. a digital elevation model for the projection of the elevation gain antenna pattern onto the terrain surface and a model of the atmosphere accounting for additional propagation delays. During the CP the TMSP has been adjusted to the in-orbit characteristics of the SAR data and instrument internal calibration. This includes adaptations of calibration pulse processing to a modified internal calibration strategy, accounting for duty cycle dependent pulse energy and temperature dependent gain levels as well as a fine tuning of the signal and geometry based Doppler centroid estimation algorithm. Furthermore, the determination of the reference function for range focusing has been optimized. Finally, the spectral weighting of the SAR data has been adjusted in order to obtain well balanced impulse response function properties in terms of resolution, side lobe ratios and azimuth ambiguities. The presentation reviews the essential features of the TMSP, summarizes the TMSP adjustments and presents results of the SAR product verification...|$|R

Quality standards are defined {{as a set of}} criteria through which the level of quality of provision of social services in the sphere of personnel and <b>operational</b> <b>provision</b> of social services and in the sphere of relations between the provider and the clients is defined. The aim of the work was to find out what problems are encountered by residential facilities in the Plzeň Region when they are introducing quality standards of social services. A partial aim of the work was to outline possible options as to how to optimise the given state. Data was obtained through a qualitative survey. The interviewing method, semi-guided interview technique and content analysis of documents were selected in order to achieve the goals of the work. The survey took place in selected residential social-care facilities in the Plzeň Region. The conducted survey implied that standard No. 2 Protection of personal rights and standard No. 5 Individual planning are considered by the facilities as more complex in terms of implementation yet very beneficial in practice. Also, the formulation and definition of standards, {{especially in the case of}} standard No. 1 Goals and methods of provision of social services created difficulties. Other problems that are encountered by the facilities include motivation, time demands and administrative load of the staff. Proposed solutions for the optimisation of the current situation are directed into the area of awareness, use of information technologies, and improvement of the lifelong education system. The following hypothesis was formulated based on the qualitative survey: the qualifications of social workers and social service workers achieved influence the introduction of quality standards. The diploma thesis may become an inspiration and a source of information for facilities that are adjusting the existing proposals or are dealing with the initial introduction of quality standards of social services. In particular, the above suggestions for optimisation, a more detailed elaboration of which could become the subject of another work in the social sphere, can be of major benefit...|$|R

40|$|The {{introduction}} of wind power into an electricity-generation system {{on a large}} scale brings about challenges for the evolution and operation of this system: backup for wind power becomes a necessity. This paper defines various elements that come into play when considering backup for electricity generation from wind power. The backup is split up in capacity backup and operational backup. The focus is set on the short-term, operational aspects of the backup provision. The effects of several short-term operation related parameters are defined and analysed. Most relevant parameters for the operation and needs for wind power backup are the load profiles, the wind power output profiles and the total amount of installed wind power. These are analysed by means of a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model through two different methods for <b>operational</b> backup <b>provision,</b> comparing the incremental cost, generated by both methods. The first method applies wind power backup through a 100 % provision of additional spinning reserves. The second method does not foresee any spinning reserve and relies on the balancing by the Transmission System Operator (TSO). Both methods result in different additional charges that are being affected by the said parameters. Both the wind profile and the total amount of installed wind power are positively related to the relative cost increase. The load profile is negatively correlated to this increase. The relationship between these parameters and the development of the incremental cost provides an understanding that allows finding better equilibria in the operational backup of wind power.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{is devoted}} to development, creation and study of material flow control processes automation in logistic systems based on multi-agent approach. Throughout the dissertation, an analysis of existing methods and material flows control systems was conducted. Also existing methods and approaches to dynamics of material flows movement were analyzed, control efficiency criteria were identified: general system optimality criteria, and criteria based on intelligent agents goal functions. During {{the work on the}} dissertation, a material flow dynamics model was developed based on universal properties of material flows which exist on all hierarchical levels of logistic systems. As a base for the model, a supply chain model by Lisovskyi-Ponomarenko was taken giving a static representation of planned logistic system. Based on positive and negative factors of existing criteria, methods, control systems features and material flow movement models, a multi-agent model of material flow movement environment was created, a multi-level structure and function of the dispatching agent were presented. Analytical model of multi-agent environment was created, two groups of effectiveness criteria were presented. Based on presented criteria, a discrete-stochastic material flow movement presentation model was proposed along with material flows dispatch function based on discrete-stochastic dynamic programming and decision making Markov chains. The function for searching of quasi-optimal solution for material flow control tasks according to discrete-stochastic dynamic programming principles was developed. All decisions are made based on numeric assessments of the next system?s step efficiency. In order to check the efficiency of proposed control method, an imitational modeling of multi agent environment and proposed methods was conducted. The modeling itself was conducted based on software created specifically for this dissertation, and it implements algorithmic embodiment of developed models throughout the dissertation.

40|$|This {{technical}} note explores {{the reasons for}} a comparatively high interest rate spread in Kazakhstan {{in the context of}} competition in the banking sector. In spite of significant gains in efficiency made in recent years, <b>operational</b> costs and <b>provisioning</b> for loan losses remain high compared with some other economies. Rapid progress is being made in developing an efficient banking sector, and further improvements will depend on good supervisory and regulatory enforcement. The level of financial intermediation, although high among neighboring countries and growing, is still low in broader comparisons.

40|$|International audienceOn March 24, 2006, the French Minister of Environment {{asked the}} Committee for Prevention and Precaution (CPP), an {{independent}} multidisciplinary committee created in 1996, {{to conduct a}} methodological analysis of operational feedback of natural and technological disasters to determine if France is equipped to collect the information and data necessary for the assessment, and optimal management of a disaster and its consequences. The Committee's analysis {{was based on the}} testimony it heard from 13 experts [...] scientists and representatives of associations and advocacy groups [...] and its review of the literature, including operational feedback reports. Its response to the Minister focused on the assessment of the health, social, environmental, and economic impacts of disasters and on their operational feedback (defined as the systematic analysis of a past event to draw lessons for the management of the risk), as practiced in France. It presents the results of the literature review about the consequences of disasters, expert's views on the current utility and limitations of impact assessments and operational feedback, the CPP's discussion of these results, and its recommendations to improve impact assessment and operational feedback of disasters. These recommendations cover preparation for and activation of data collection and <b>operational</b> feedback, financial <b>provisions,</b> coordination of stakeholders, education and training in disaster preparedness, and the distribution and use of data from operational feedback...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new transactional “database-as-a-service” (DBaaS) called Relational Cloud. A DBaaS promises to move {{much of the}} <b>operational</b> burden of <b>provisioning,</b> configuration, scaling, performance tuning, backup, privacy, and access control from the database users to the service operator, offering lower overall costs to users. Early DBaaS efforts include Amazon RDS and Microsoft SQL Azure, which are promising in terms of establishing the market need for such a service, but which do not address three important challenges: efficient multi-tenancy, elastic scalability, and database privacy. We argue that these three challenges must be overcome before outsourcing database software and management becomes attractive to many users, and cost-effective for service providers. The key technical features of Relational Cloud include: (1) a workload-aware approach to multi-tenancy that identifies the workloads that can be co-located on a database server, achieving higher consolidation and better performance than existing approaches; (2) {{the use of a}} graph-based data partitioning algorithm to achieve near-linear elastic scale-out even for complex transactional workloads; and (3) an adjustable security scheme that enables SQL queries to run over encrypted data, including ordering operations, aggregates, and joins. An underlying theme {{in the design of the}} components of Relational Cloud is the notion of workload awareness: by monitoring query patterns and data accesses, the system obtains information useful for various optimization and security functions, reducing the configuration effort for users and operators. 1...|$|R
