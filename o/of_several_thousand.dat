5|$|Griswold's {{funeral was}} held on August 30. His pallbearers {{included}} Leland, Charles Frederick Briggs, George Henry Moore, and Richard Henry Stoddard. His remains were left for {{eight years in the}} receiving tomb of Green-Wood Cemetery before being buried on July 12, 1865, without a headstone. Although his library <b>of</b> <b>several</b> <b>thousand</b> volumes was auctioned off, raising over $3,000 to be put towards a monument, none was ever commissioned.|$|E
5|$|The Catholics offered Gebhard a great sum of money, {{which he}} refused, {{demanding}} instead, {{the restoration of}} his state. When further negotiations among the Electors and the Emperor at Frankfurt am Main, then at Muhlhausen in Westphalia, failed {{to reach an agreement}} settling the dispute, the Pope arranged for the support <b>of</b> <b>several</b> <b>thousand</b> Spanish troops in early 1584.|$|E
5|$|During the Eastern Han, {{conscription}} {{could be}} avoided if one paid a commutable tax. The Eastern Han court favored the recruitment of a volunteer army. The volunteer army comprised the Southern Army (Nanjun 南軍), while the standing army stationed in and near the capital was the Northern Army (Beijun 北軍). Led by Colonels (Xiaowei 校尉), the Northern Army consisted of five regiments, each composed <b>of</b> <b>several</b> <b>thousand</b> soldiers. When central authority collapsed after 189 AD, wealthy landowners, members of the aristocracy/nobility, and regional military-governors relied upon their retainers to act as their own personal troops (buqu 部曲).|$|E

5|$|Griswold married Caroline on August 12, 1837, and {{the couple}} had two daughters. Following {{the birth of their}} second daughter, Griswold left his family behind in New York and moved to Philadelphia. His {{departure}} on November 27, 1840, was by all accounts abrupt, leaving his job with Horace Greeley's New York Tribune, and his library <b>of</b> <b>several</b> <b>thousand</b> volumes. He joined the staff of Philadelphia's Daily Standard and began to build his reputation as a literary critic, becoming known for his savagery and vindictiveness.|$|E

Pećanac declined this request and suggested that he might offer Mihailović the position as his chief of staff. He also recommended that Mihailović's detachments disband and join his organisation. In the meantime, Pećanac had arranged for the transfer <b>of</b> <b>several</b> <b>thousand</b> of his Chetniks to the Serbian Gendarmerie to act as German auxiliaries.|$|E

5|$|A crowd <b>of</b> <b>several</b> <b>thousand</b> {{gathered}} {{outside the courthouse}} while Lockett's trial was underway. A cameraman asked {{a large group of}} those gathered to shake their fists and yell so he could get a picture. The rest of the crowd mistakenly believed they were storming the courthouse and rushed forward. In the ensuing skirmish, one policeman was injured so badly that his arm later had to be amputated. The National Guard opened fire, killing six people and wounding approximately fifty. Some members of the mob looted nearby stores in search of weapons to retaliate, but reinforcements arrived from a nearby army post by mid-afternoon. Martial law was declared, and no further violence was perpetrated. A month later, Lockett was executed at the Kentucky State Penitentiary in Eddyville.|$|E
5|$|Although {{capable of}} {{generating}} a high volume of fire, autocannon {{are limited by}} the amount of ammunition that can be carried by the weapons systems mounting them. For this reason, both the 25mm Bushmaster and the 30mm RARDEN are deliberately designed with relatively slow rates of fire, to extend the amount of time they can be employed on a battlefield before requiring a resupply of ammunition. The rate of fire of modern autocannon ranges from 90 rounds per minute, to 1,800 rounds per minute. Systems with multiple barrels—Gatling guns—can have rates of fire <b>of</b> <b>several</b> <b>thousand</b> rounds per minute; the fastest of these is the GSh-6-30K, which has a rate of fire of over 6,000rounds per minute.|$|E
5|$|Dramatic performances, often {{accompanied}} by music, were popular in the markets. The actors were distinguished in rank by type and color of clothing, honing their acting skills at drama schools. Satirical sketches denouncing corrupt government officials were especially popular. Actors on stage always spoke their lines in Classical Chinese; vernacular Chinese that imitated the common spoken language was not introduced into theatrical performances until the subsequent Yuan dynasty. Although trained to speak in the erudite Classical language, acting troupes commonly drew their membership {{from one of the}} lowest social groups in society: prostitutes. Of the fifty some theatres located in the pleasure grounds of Kaifeng, four of these theatres were large enough to entertain audiences <b>of</b> <b>several</b> <b>thousand</b> each, drawing huge crowds which nearby businesses thrived upon.|$|E

He lectured for seven hours to 2,500 people at the Brixton Academy, London, in 2008, and the same year addressed the University of Oxford's debating society, the Oxford Union. His book tour for Human Race Get Off Your Knees: The Lion Sleeps No More (2010) included a sell-out talk to 2,100 in New York and £83,000 worth of ticket sales in Melbourne, Australia. In October 2012, he delivered a 10-hour lecture to 6,000 people at London's Wembley Arena.|$|E
5|$|Two {{successive}} inquiries {{failed to}} find evidence against Clayton. The legislature refused to continue, all charges were dropped, and Clayton was exonerated. In fact, he was never found guilty of any wrongdoing while governor. Finally a deal was reached. Johnson, now politically badly damaged by his impeachment ordeal and willing to take any position he could get, resigned as lieutenant governor, was appointed Secretary of State, and was given a compensation <b>of</b> <b>several</b> <b>thousand</b> dollars for his loss of power and prestige, since he would not become governor. A staunch Clayton supporter, O.A. Hadley, was then appointed lieutenant governor. Three days later, Clayton left the state for Washington, D.C., to join the US Senate, and Hadley succeeded him as governor.|$|E

McEntee began to work in Leinster House as her father's personal assistant in May 2010 while he was an opposition TD. One of the first issues on which she worked with {{her father was a}} campaign on behalf of the owners <b>of</b> <b>several</b> <b>thousand</b> houses damaged by the use of pyrite, a material used as backfill during construction, that expands when damp or exposed to air. She considered standing as a candidate in the 2014 local elections, and discussed the prospect with her father, as well as the possibility of one day succeeding him {{as a member of the}} Dáil. She moved with him to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine when he was appointed minister of state after Fine Gael became a party of government following the 2011 general election.|$|E

5|$|Montagu, having {{responsibility}} for the defence of the north, received various commissions of array, which reflected the government's knowledge that King Edward was equipping a Burgundian-backed fleet in order to re-invade. Montagu was to raise men from all across the north. On 14 March 1471, King Edward landed at Ravenspur, {{on the coast of}} Yorkshire; he had intended to land in East Anglia, but this had been established as being unsafe. Montagu, it has been suggested, could have 'snuffed out' Edward's army almost immediately had he moved fast enough. Montagu was in Pontefract Castle as Edward passed by (where even his castle bailiff deserted him for the returning king, taking the castle's funds with him). Montagu's army, composed of local militias, was probably in the region <b>of</b> <b>several</b> <b>thousand</b> men, between 6,000 and 7,000, and increased as he trailed Edward south. Montagu arrived at Coventry, where the Earl of Warwick was camped, in Early April 1471; this was probably the day after Clarence had defected back to his brother Edward, and taken his army with him.|$|E
5|$|On 22 and 23 September {{small groups}} of soldiers, {{remnants}} of the Yildirim Army Group, were attacked by aircraft on the Shibleh to Beisan road near the Jordan River. Shortly afterwards a column <b>of</b> <b>several</b> <b>thousand</b> Ottoman soldiers were seen marching back under a white flag along the Wady el Fara road. Meanwhile, east of the Jordan River, three German Pfalz scout aircraft {{and a number of}} D.F.W. two–seater aircraft from Deraa aerodrome were attacked by three Bristol Fighters over Um es Surab. During the aerial fight a German two–seater was shot down near Mafrak, another aircraft was forced to land near the railway and an Ottoman outpost, while the third aircraft was chased back to Deraa. Deraa aerodrome was attacked in the early morning of 23 September, by aircraft flying from Ramle. It was attacked again that night by the Handley-Page, which ended the enemy's use of that aerodrome.|$|E
5|$|Seneb's tomb reliefs and {{the false}} {{door of his}} tomb {{indicate}} his wealth and power. Seneb is described as the owner <b>of</b> <b>several</b> <b>thousand</b> cattle and is shown in various scenes of domestic life – being carried in a litter, sailing in a boat in the Nile Delta, or receiving his children. The false door shows Seneb carrying out the standard activities of a high-ranking courtier such as inspecting his linen and cattle, receiving accounts and overseeing his retainers. He is shown wearing kilts and a priestly robe made of panther skin, and carrying symbols of his office such as a sceptre and staff. One relief shows him accompanied by two pet dogs, each captioned with a name. He is depicted using what were evidently custom-made items of furniture, such as low stools and a specially adapted litter with a low back and large side-panels to conceal his legs.|$|E

5|$|The populace {{engaged in}} a vibrant social and {{domestic}} life, enjoying such public festivals as the Lantern Festival and the Qingming Festival. There were entertainment quarters in the cities providing a constant array of amusements. There were puppeteers, acrobats, theatre actors, sword swallowers, snake charmers, storytellers, singers and musicians, prostitutes, and places to relax, including tea houses, restaurants, and organized banquets. People attended social clubs in large numbers; there were tea clubs, exotic food clubs, antiquarian and art collectors' clubs, horse-loving clubs, poetry clubs, and music clubs. Like regional cooking and cuisines in the Song, the era was known for its regional varieties of performing arts styles as well. Theatrical drama was very popular amongst the elite and general populace, although Classical Chinese—not the vernacular language—was spoken by actors on stage. The four largest drama theatres in Kaifeng could hold audiences <b>of</b> <b>several</b> <b>thousand</b> each. There were also notable domestic pastimes, as people at home enjoyed activities such as the go and xiangqi board games.|$|E
5|$|Two {{years later}} Commodore Charles Knowles, {{who served as}} Governor of Louisbourg after its capture, had {{a large number of}} seamen from Boston harbour {{impressed}} for service in his squadron. A mob of more than 300 men seized three naval officers and a deputy sheriff and beat the sheriff. The mob then went to Governor Shirley's house, demanding the release of the men impressed by Knowles. Shirley tried to call out the militia, but they did not respond. Shirley did succeed in getting the naval officers into his house, and the mob eventually left. Later in the day Shirley went to the Town House to meet the people. The mob, now consisting <b>of</b> <b>several</b> <b>thousand</b> people, attacked the Town House, breaking many windows in the building. Shirley spoke to the mob and promised to present their demands to Commodore Knowles. The mob left, intending to find a Royal Navy ship to burn.|$|E
5|$|West {{points out}} that Kaifeng shopkeepers rarely had time to eat at home, so they chose {{to go out and}} eat at a variety of places such as restaurants, temples, and food stalls. Restaurant {{businesses}} thrived on this new clientele, while restaurants that catered to regional cooking targeted customers such as merchants and officials who came from regions of China where cuisine styles and flavors were drastically different than those commonly served in the capital. The pleasure district mentioned above—where stunts, games, theatrical stage performances, taverns and singing girl houses were located—was teeming with food stalls where business could be had virtually all night. West makes a direct connection between the success of the theatre industry and the food industry in the cities. Of the fifty some theatres within the pleasure districts of Kaifeng, four of these could entertain audiences <b>of</b> <b>several</b> <b>thousand</b> each, drawing huge crowds which would then give nearby businesses an enormous potential customer base. Besides food, traders in eagles and hawks, precious paintings, as well as shops selling bolts of silk and cloth, jewelry of pearls, jade, rhinoceros horn, gold and silver, hair ornaments, combs, caps, scarves, and aromatic incense thrived in the marketplaces.|$|E
