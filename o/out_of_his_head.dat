25|$|The Meditator {{finds it}} almost {{impossible}} to keep his habitual opinions and assumptions <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> try as he might. He resolves to pretend that these opinions are totally false and imaginary in order to counterbalance his habitual way of thinking. The Meditator wishes to avoid an excess of skepticism and instead uses a skeptical method, an important distinction. He supposes that not God, but some evil demon has committed itself to deceiving him so that everything he thinks he knows is false. By doubting everything, he can at least be sure not to be misled into falsehood by this demon.|$|E
25|$|After 47 drops Victoria {{off at the}} Rosewood Orphanage to hide, he {{contacts}} his informant, Birdie, {{for information}} about Victoria and the ICA, which Birdie agrees to provide once 47 has assassinated a crime boss in Chinatown for him. After cutting the barcode tattoo <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and giving his Silverballers to Birdie, 47 is informed by Birdie about a man named Blake Dexter, head of Dexter Industries, a home defense system company, who is staying at the Terminus Hotel. 47 sneaks into the hotel and learns from a conversation between Dexter and his secretary Layla Stockton in his penthouse that Dexter is planning to kidnap Victoria and sell her to the highest bidder. However, 47 is knocked out by Dexter's bodyguard Sanchez.

500|$|Along {{with his}} estrangement from McCartney, Lennon always felt a musical {{competitiveness}} {{with him and}} kept an ear on his music. During his five-year career break he was content to sit back as long as McCartney was producing what Lennon saw as mediocre material. Lennon took notice when McCartney released [...] "Coming Up" [...] in 1980, which was the year Lennon returned to the studio and {{the last year of}} his life. [...] "It's driving me crackers!" [...] he jokingly complained, because he could not get the tune <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> That same year, Lennon was asked whether the group were dreaded enemies or the best of friends, and he replied that they were neither, and that he had not seen any of them in a long time.

500|$|Following their {{successful}} partnership on All Things Must Pass in 1970, Harrison and co-producer Phil Spector {{turned their}} attention to resurrecting the career of Spector's wife Ronnie, formerly lead singer of the Ronettes. Since the break-up of the Ronettes in 1967, Ronnie Spector's only musical release had been [...] "You Came, You Saw, You Conquered", a 1969 single on A Records. Her signing to the Beatles' Apple record label was a condition of Phil Spector's deal with the company, one that Harrison and Lennon, as avowed fans of the Ronettes, were happy to honour. The plan was to produce a comeback album, with Harrison providing many of the songs, and issue it on Apple Records. In his book Phil Spector: <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>His</b> <b>Head,</b> Williams quotes music publisher Paul Case as having said during this period: [...] "Phil wants a hit record with Ronnie again {{more than anything in the}} world. I think he'd give up all his worldly possessions for that." ...|$|E

500|$|Also {{impressed}} with the song's musical moods, Ian Inglis writes: [...] "The switches between periods of pulsating rhythm and interludes of musical calm echo {{the ebb and flow}} of seduction itself. Like a painter who uses contrasting colors to create tension and movement, Harrison is... using the tools of the songwriter to create a dynamic and passionate depiction of lust and desire." [...] Madinger and Easter describe the track as [...] "an absolutely apocalyptic production" [...] and [...] "the best example of Spector running rampant with the 'Wall of Sound'". Writing in his book Phil Spector: <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>His</b> <b>Head,</b> Richard Williams views [...] "Let It Down" [...] as [...] "the record's most thrilling track", adding that it [...] "picks the listener up and, in the best Spector tradition, never lets him down, building an electrifying tension between the subdued, reverential verses and the roaring chorus". In September 2014, the song appeared as Harrison's selection on the solo Beatles EP , exclusive to iTunes.|$|E
500|$|The next {{extended}} {{stop was}} at Mainz. The Elector was ill, but the Mozarts gave three concerts in the town, which brought in 200 gulden. From Mainz the family took the market boat up the River Main to Frankfurt, where several public concerts were given. Among those {{present at the}} first of these was the fourteen-year-old Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, who would many years later recall [...] "the little fellow with his wig and his sword". An advertisement for these concerts announced that [...] "the girl" [...] would play [...] "the most difficult pieces by the greatest masters", while [...] "the boy" [...] would play a concerto on the violin and also repeat his Vienna trick of playing with the keyboard completely covered by a cloth. Finally [...] "he will improvise <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> not only on the fortepiano but also on the organ...in all the keys, even the most difficult, that he may be asked".|$|E
500|$|Alan Clayson approves of {{the more}} [...] "understated {{production}} aesthetic" [...] next to what he views as an at-times [...] "bloated" [...] sound found elsewhere on All Things Must Pass. Simon Leng also acknowledges Harrison's success in [...] "temper Phil Spector's taste for the extreme" [...] and describes [...] "Behind That Locked Door" [...] {{as one of its}} composer's [...] "more attractive" [...] songs, with a fine lead vocal. [...] " [...] is refreshing to hear Harrison singing about another's pain," [...] Leng adds, [...] "suggesting that, unlike some of his contemporaries, he was able to displace himself as the center of his universe {{for a moment or two}} at least." [...] In his book Phil Spector: <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>His</b> <b>Head,</b> Richard Williams identifies [...] "Behind That Locked Door" [...] as an example of [...] "how sympathetic to the performer" [...] Spector could be as a producer, in this case, by giving the recording a [...] "mellow, autumnal mix" [...] that [...] "beautifully display" [...] Drake's pedal steel.|$|E

500|$|In {{his book}} Phil Spector: <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>His</b> <b>Head,</b> Richard Williams writes that, unlike Lennon and McCartney on their 1970 solo albums, [...] "Harrison {{concentrated}} on pure joyous melodies – {{the kind of}} songs that had made the group so loved", and he says of [...] "Awaiting on You All": [...] "Spector repaid Harrison for his benediction on the Ike and Tina Turner album cover by {{turning it into a}} virtual remake of 'River Deep – Mountain High'." [...] Mark Ribowsky, another Spector biographer, writes of the producer's contribution to this and other songs on All Things Must Pass: [...] "Phil's rhythmically pounding basses and drum feels sutured George's sentimentality with cheerful energy and made Indian asceticism into dance music." [...] Simon Leng describes [...] "Awaiting on You All" [...] as a [...] "hot gospel stomper" [...] and [...] "the most successful example of Spector's work on the album". Writing for NME Originals in 2005, Adrian Thrills named [...] "Awaiting on You All" [...] and [...] "Wah-Wah" [...] as examples of [...] "a tendency to over-egg the mix" [...] on the otherwise [...] "magnificent" [...] All Things Must Pass, adding: [...] "it is hard to think of another big rock album on which the tambourine is shaken quite so relentlessly." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to George Maestri, Rocko has {{no family}} name because the writers {{did not think}} of a family name that they desired.
