40|$|Purpose – Ideally, {{there is}} no wear in {{hydrodynamic}} lubrication regime. A small amount of wear occurs during start and stop of the machines {{and the amount of}} wear is so small {{that it is difficult to}} measure with accuracy. Various wear measuring techniques have been used where <b>out-of-roundness</b> was found to be the most reliable method of measuring small wear quantities in journal bearings. This technique was further developed to achieve higher accuracy in measuring small wear quantities. The method proved to be reliable as well as inexpensive. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach – In an experimental study, the effect of antiwear additives was studied on journal bearings lubricated with oil containing solid contaminants. The test duration was too long and the wear quantities achieved were too small. To minimise the test duration, short tests of about 90 [*]min duration were conducted and wear was measured recording changes in variety of parameters related to weight, geometry and wear debris. The <b>out-of-roundness</b> was found to be the most effective method. This method was further refined by enlarging the <b>out-of-roundness</b> traces on a photocopier. The method was proved to be reliable and inexpensive. Findings – Study revealed that the most commonly used wear measurement techniques such as weight loss, roughness changes and change in particle count were not adequate for measuring small wear quantities in journal bearings. <b>Out-of-roundness</b> method with some refinements was found to be one of the most reliable methods for measuring small wear quantities in journal bearings working in hydrodynamic lubrication regime. By enlarging the <b>out-of-roundness</b> traces and determining the worn area of the bearing cross-section, weight loss in bearings was calculated, which was repeatable and reliable. Research limitations/implications – This research is a basic in nature where a rudimentary solution has been developed for measuring small wear quantities in rotary devices such as journal bearings. The method requires enlarging traces on a photocopier and determining the shape of the worn area on an <b>out-of-roundness</b> trace on a transparency, which is a simple but a crude method. This may require an automated procedure to determine the weight loss from the <b>out-of-roundness</b> traces directly. This method can be very useful in reducing test duration and measuring wear quantities with higher precision in situations where wear quantities are very small. Practical implications – This research provides a reliable method of measuring wear of circular geometry. The Talyrond equipment used for measuring the change in <b>out-of-roundness</b> due to wear of bearings indicates that this equipment has high potential to be used as a wear measuring device also. Measurement of weight loss from the traces is an enhanced capability of this equipment and this research may lead to the development of a modified version of Talyrond type of equipment for wear measurements in circular machine components. Originality/value – Wear measurement in hydrodynamic bearings requires long duration tests to achieve adequate wear quantities. <b>Out-of-roundness</b> is one of the geometrical parameters that changes with progression of wear in a circular shape components. Thus, <b>out-of-roundness</b> is found to be an effective wear measuring parameter that relates to change in geometry. Method of increasing the sensitivity and enlargement of <b>out-of-roundness</b> traces is original work through which area of worn cross-section can be determined and weight loss can be derived for materials of known density with higher precision...|$|E

40|$|The work {{described}} {{investigates the}} lobing and chatter behavior, and approaches to suppress lobing and chatter {{in order to}} improve the workpiece roundness in centerless grinding. The problem of workpiece <b>out-of-roundness</b> {{is one of the main}} limitations for the applications of centerless grinding as a high rate precision machining process. Lobing and/or chatter most often is the source of the problem. This work models the centerless grinding process as a causal system between the potential grinding disturbances and the resulting workpiece <b>out-of-roundness,</b> and develops approaches to set up a centerless grinding operation such that the workpiece <b>out-of-roundness</b> is kept minimum under the potential grinding disturbances. ^ A general centerless grinding process model is proposed. The model can be simplified for lobing and chatter analysis. A Bidiagrammatical method is proposed to investigate the lobing stability. It was found that the upper and lower lobing growth rate can be estimated through the Bidiagrammatical method, and the lobing growth exhibits periodicity over the lobing frequency. A relative stability diagram is thus developed to provide guidance such that a proper setup angle β can be selected to suppress lobing. ^ During grinding, two types of workpiece surface waves can be generated: (1) standing wave; and (2) precessing wave. It was found that the standing waves are less stable, therefore, often cause significant workpiece <b>out-of-roundness</b> problem. A work-speed regulation method is proposed such that only precessing waves are generated during grinding, therefore, reduce the workpiece <b>out-of-roundness.</b> ^ Chatter stability is investigated by using a similar Bidiagrammatical method. It was found that chatter stability can be approximately assessed through lobing stability. Therefore, approaches to lobing suppression can be equally applied to suppress chatter. ...|$|E

AimsThis study aims to examine differences among sites and log positions in post-felling log traits and green veneer recovery traits and {{determine the extent to which}} log traits explain variation in recovery traits. MethodsLog traits and green rotary-peeled veneer recovery traits from six temperate eucalypt plantations were studied. Selected plantations encompassed different age, site productivity, silvicultural and species classes in south-eastern Australia. Differences in log and recovery traits among sites and between lower and upper logs were examined, as was the extent to which log traits explained variation in recovery traits.

The <b>out-of-roundness</b> could be the result of asymmetric loads induced by hardware attached to the nozzle, asymmetric internal stresses induced by previous tests, and deformation, such as creep, from previous tests.

40|$|Purpose: In this paper, a radial {{clearance}} of a journal bearings and the metrology of the {{radial clearance}} measurement is described. Design/methodology/approach: In this experimental study <b>out-of-roundness</b> and radial clearance of journal bearings were measured with high precision {{and the impact}} of their metrology was examined on the specific oil film thickness of the bearing. Some metrological issues were emerged and these should be taken into account when bearings are designed. Findings: An investigation showed that the radial clearance measurements can vary from one measuring device to another and the specified clearance may not necessarily meet the design criteria of specific oil film thickness. The study indicates that the radial clearance measurement can differ from one measuring device to another depending upon the precision that can be achieved by the device. The radius of the bearing or the shaft also varies along the circumference, mainly due to <b>out-of-roundness.</b> The <b>out-of-roundness</b> contributes to the error in radial clearance measurement and hence similar to the cut off length specified with the surface roughness, the <b>out-of-roundness</b> needs to be specified with the radial clearance. Practical implications: The radial clearance of a journal bearing is a key design parameter and bearing performance mainly depends upon this parameter. In this paper was showed that the metrology of the radial clearance measurement plays a significant role and not only that the bearing manufacturer or the user of the bearing is aware of this fact but the bearing designer must also take this fact into account while designing bearings.

This paper will discuss the influence of initial <b>out-of-roundness</b> of wheels as well as the influence of wheelset unbalances at high speeds on this wear process. Using a modular approach the model of the wheelset based on the method of flexible multibody systems is coupled to the rail with a complex wheel-rail contact module. In order to account for the long-term wear effects on the wheels the mechanical model is extended by a long-term wear model using a wear-feedback loop in a different time scale. The presented results of wear simulations are subsequently used to discuss the influence of initial <b>out-of-roundness</b> and wheelset unbalances at high speeds on the order and magnitude of developing wear patterns. ...|$|E

The submerged {{pressure hull}} is subjected to very high hydrostatic pressure or underwater explosion load, which creates large compressive stress resultants. Due to this the pressure hull is susceptible to buckling. Buckling phenomena analysis is of greater importance in the design of the submerged pressure hulls. For the pressure hulls with local out-of- roundness, the operating depth will be greatly influenced and thus decreasing capability to resist pressure loading.

Wheel tread irregularities occurring in different types of train traffic in Sweden (high-speed, passenger, freight, commuter, subway) have been assessed using <b>out-of-roundness</b> measurements. These measurements show that high roughness levels with wavelengths between 3 cm and 8 cm (corrugation) are present on tread braked freight wheels and tread braked powered X 2 high-speed train wheels.

The influence {{of different types of}} wheel <b>out-of-roundness</b> on the vertical dynamic wheel-rail contact force and on the track response is investigated through extensive field tests and numerical simulations.

Ultrasonic burnishing is a modern method for finishing workpieces to produce a good surface quality. This process improves the surface quality and increases the surface hardness of the workpiece, and the surface roughness of the workpiece improves.

40|$|This thesis aims {{to develop}} novel {{applications}} of distributed fiber optic sensors for pipeline structural health monitoring. Specifically, this thesis aims {{to show that}} distributed fiber optic sensors can potentially detect the onset of <b>out-of-roundness</b> in pipes and monitor local stiffness changes on the out-of-round pipe, show the theoretical response of the distributed fiber optic sensor when instrumented on an out-of-round pipe subjected to axial and bending loads in addition to internal pressure and demonstrate the potential of distributed fiber optic sensors for monitoring pipe bursts in a laboratory-based burst test while highlighting the importance of sensor spatial and temporal resolution. The ability of distributed fiber optic sensors to detect <b>out-of-roundness</b> in pipes was demonstrated through an experimental program where fiber sensors were instrumented helically around a PVC pipe. The onset of <b>out-of-roundness</b> in the pipe was induced by filling it with water. Strain measurements made by the fiber sensor after the pipe was filled with water showed an oscillatory strain profile with maxima strains along the mid-line of the pipe and minima strains along the top and bottom. This suggested the onset of <b>out-of-roundness.</b> The measurements agreed with an analytical model derived by Brazier describing the deformation of a cylindrical shell due to a bending moment. Internal pressure was then applied to the filled pipe. Strain measurements made with the fiber sensors showed a mean increase in strain and an oscillatory strain profile with maxima strains {{at the top and}} bottom of the pipe and minimas along the mid-line. This agreed with an analytical model derived by Haigh describing the expansion of an out-of-round pipe under internal pressure. Local stiffness changes were introduced to the PVC pipe by bonding steel shims to its surface. The distributed fiber optic sensors were found to be capable of locating the shim when the out-of-round pipe was pressurized. These results demonstrate that distributed fiber sensors can potentially be used to detect the onset of <b>out-of-roundness</b> in pipes and monitor local wall stiffness changes in the out-of-round pipe. The theoretical response of the distributed fiber sensor when helically instrumented on an out-of-round pipe subjected to axial and bending loads in addition to internal pressure was investigated through finite element methods. An algorithm converting finite element point strains to distributed fiber sensor strains and a finite element model of the out-of-round pipe were developed. The strain distributions predicted by the combined algorithm and finite element pipe were found to show good agreement with the experimental results of Chapter 7. The validated algorithm and model were then used to study the theoretical response of the distributed fiber optic sensor when instrumented helically on an out-of-round pipe subjected to axial and bending loads in addition to internal pressure. The results of this study showed that the theoretical distributed fiber optic sensor strains of the out-of-round pipe subjected to internal pressure, internal pressure and axial loads and internal pressure and bending loads are different suggesting that a single strand of fiber sensor instrumented helically around the pipe can potentially distinguish between the three loading cases. The potential of distributed fiber sensors for monitoring pipe bursts was demonstrated in a laboratory-based study. Distributed fiber optic sensors were instrumented on a cast iron pipe. Various damages sizes were introduced to the pipe to initiate burst and the pipe was pressurized. It was observed that higher spatial and temporal distributed fiber optic sensor resolutions allowed the expansion of the burst site to be monitored until the pipe failed. Spatial and temporal resolutions that were too low however could not detect the burst site. The findings of this thesis are expected to contribute towards the development of smart pipes capable of relaying information on its structural health to pipeline operators...|$|E

The model also includes the important geometrical relationships that are unique {{to this type of}} grinding. The model was veriŽ ed using an experiential set-up involving sophisticated strain gauge force measurements on a commercial Landis CP grinding machine, with close correlation between the results and the model. <br /...|$|E
40|$|The {{simulation}} of 2 D etching shapes such as surface profiles and <b>out-of-roundness</b> profiles related to various (h k 0) and (h h l) silicon plates or cross-sections is studied. The theoretical {{basis of the}} simulation is presented. The database for the simulator TENSOSIM is determined from a systematic analysis of experimental 2 D etching shapes. Emphasis is placed on difficulties encountered in the determination procedure. Theoretical 2 D etching shapes are compared with experimental shapes. A correlation between polar plots of the dissolution slowness and corresponding theoretical shapes is established. So we can conclude that {{the accuracy of the}} proposed database is sufficient for the {{simulation of}} 2 D etching shapes...|$|E
