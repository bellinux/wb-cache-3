50|$|The BRT in Salvador {{occurred}} because of rapid deployment, {{a much lower}} cost than other systems, and easy integration of physical infrastructure with the road system. Salvador BRT will come with all the technology previously deployed in major cities like London. Cars will have double doors, automatic and wide {{to the left of}} the cars, stations with raised floors ensuring easy access for all, including the disabled, fare collection in booths outside, and the movement of vehicles will occur on highways that allow <b>overtaking</b> <b>stations,</b> ending queues. All planned to offer maximum safety and comfort. The International Airport/Iguatemi Mall route, for example, has three types of operating vehicles: the express, direct, faster, without stopping in the path, the semi-express, which will make a few stops along the line, only three or four in the path, and the local parador, stopping at all points/stations of the route.|$|R

40|$|Today many railway {{lines are}} {{operated}} close to maximum capacity. A common question asked is: “How {{is the quality}} of operation affected if one additional train/h is scheduled?” With the upcoming deregulation of operation, the necessity to be able to answer this question accurately increases when service operators that are denied train slots due to congestion demand a motivation. The objective {{of this paper is to}} investigate how secondary delays on a congested double-track line depend on several parameters such as: Number of trains/h. Timetable heterogeneity (speed difference). Primary delay levels. Inter-station distance. Each combination of settings of the parameters is investigated to capture possible interaction effects. The infrastructure model consists of a fictitious double-track line with <b>overtaking</b> <b>stations</b> at regular intervals. A program that generates timetables and perturbation data according to specified input settings is developed. The output of the program is data files that can be read directly by the well-known simulation tool RailSys. This process makes it possible to simulate the hundreds of different timetables that are the result when the parameters investigated are varied. The outcome of the simulations is analysed to find the influence of the investigated parameters on the secondary delays. QC 20120330 </p...|$|R
50|$|In the 1970s, owner Max Richmond {{died and}} FM radio began to <b>overtake</b> AM <b>stations</b> for music listening. WMEX decided to abandon Top-40 hits in 1975. It briefly ran a {{middle of the}} road music format with some talk programming. Then WMEX {{captured}} the broadcast rights to Boston Red Sox baseball beginning with the 1975 playoffs. That led to WMEX becoming an all-talk station in 1976. In 1978, to better promote its talk format and sports coverage, the station changed call letters to WITS ("We're Information, Talk and Sports").|$|R
40|$|The {{demand for}} {{transportation}} on railways grows {{for each year}} and many railway lines are already used close to maximum capacity. One way to increase capacity is to reduce traffic heterogeneity. Heterogeneity is introduced when train services with different speeds operate on the same line. There are many definitions of heterogeneity in literature. Good measures are important {{in order to be}} able to quantify capacity lost due to heterogeneity, and consequently how capacity can be gained by reducing it. This paper analyse some of the existing measures as well as introduces a new one, Mean Pass Coefficient (MPC). Other measures analysed are: number of speed levels (SL), speed ratio of fastest to slowest train (SR), mean difference in free running time (MDFR) as well as sum of shortest headway reciprocals (SSHR) and sum of arrival headway reciprocals (SAHR). Two infrastructure models of double-track lines with <b>overtaking</b> <b>stations</b> spaced at different intervals are simulated. A large number of timetables are created where traffic density as well as the mix of slower and faster trains is varied. Each timetable is characterized using the different definitions of heterogeneity and the results are used in regression analyses to determine their explanatory value with respect to secondary delays created in the simulations. Results show that MPC performs best closely followed by MDFR and SR, while SL is worse when it comes to explaining secondary delays. SSHR and SAHR also show good performance. The performance of the measures increases when primary delays are high, but is unaffected by interstation distance. QC 20140602 </p...|$|R

50|$|Eltville {{station is}} the only station between Rüdesheim and Wiesbaden Central Station that still has a third track. This is {{occasionally}} used to allow <b>overtaking.</b> Eltville <b>station</b> has a “home” platform (platform 1), which is barrier-free for the disabled and an island platform for tracks 2 and 3, {{which can only be}} reached by steps from an underpass. Track 1 is used by trains towards Wiesbaden and Frankfurt and track 2 is used by services towards Rudesheim, Kaub, Koblenz and Neuwied. Points and signals at the station are controlled by a push button interlocking installed in 1954. In the station forecourt there is a bus stop served by regular services of Omnibusverkehr Rhein-Nahe (the local Deutsche Bahn-owned bus company) to Rudesheim and Wiesbaden, to Kiedrich and Eberbach Abbey or to Martinsthal, Rauenthal and Schlangenbad.

5000|$|From 1979 to 1994, {{the team}} of Wendall Anschutz and Anne Peterson - who both served as the main anchors of KCTV's weekday evening newscasts - led the station's newscasts to first place among the Kansas City market's three main local {{television}} news outlets of the time period. During the 1980s and early 1990s, KCTV was engaged in very competitive race for first place in news viewership with KMBC and WDAF-TV, frequently trading places with both stations in certain time periods; in total viewership, KCTV battled WDAF for first place during this period. Viewership for the station's newscasts fell to third place following WDAF's switch to Fox in September 1994, as KMBC concurrently underwent a resurgence to <b>overtake</b> both <b>stations</b> {{to become the most}} watched television news operation in Kansas City. In 1994, KCTV began leasing a helicopter to provide aerial coverage of breaking news and weather events; branded as [...] "NewsHawk 5", the helicopter was grounded citing budget concerns in 1998. The station would eventually acquire a new helicopter for aerial newsgathering purposes, branded as [...] "Chopper 5", in May 2006.|$|R
5000|$|The station {{first began}} {{broadcasting}} in 1940 under the WLAV call sign (which stood for Leonard Adrian Versluis, the station's original owner). WLAV became a full-time Top 40 music {{station in the}} summer of 1963, and was originally consulted by Mike Joseph, who later went on to develop the Hot Hits format in the late 1970s. One popular WLAV personality was Larry Adderley, who would later work as a sportscaster at various radio and TV stations in the Detroit market as well as an announcer for the Detroit Tigers. WLAV soon <b>overtook</b> rival <b>stations</b> WGRD and WMAX as the dominant popular music station in the market, but its market share declined in the late 1960s and early 1970s with the popularity of FM stations such as 95.7 WZZM ("Z96"), WGRD (which had added an FM simulcast outlet), and WLAV's own FM sister station which found success as an album rocker after a period as an oldies station.

40|$|Train {{scheduling}} {{is one of}} {{the significant}} issues in the railway industry in recent years since it has an important role in efficacy of railway infrastructure. In this paper, the timetabling problem of a multiple tracked railway network is discussed. More specifically, a general model is presented here in which a set of operational and safety requirements is considered. The model handles the trains <b>overtaking</b> in <b>stations</b> and considers the stations capacity. The objective function is to minimize the total travel time. Unfortunately, the problem is NP-hard and real size problems cannot be solved in an acceptable amount of time. In order to reduce the processing time, we presented some heuristic rules, which reduce the number of binary variables. These rules are based on problem's parameters such as travel time, dwell time and safety time of stations and try to remove the impracticable areas of the solution space. Furthermore, a Lagrangian Relaxation algorithm model is presented in order to find a lower-bound. Finally, comprehensive numerical experiments on the Tehran Metro case are reported. Results show the efficiency of the heuristic rules and also the Lagrangian Relaxation method in a way that for all analyzed problems the optimum value are obtained...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{shows the}} {{advantages}} of simple models for analysis of railway operation. It presents two tools for infrastructure and timetable planning. It shows how the infrastructure can be analysed through fictive line designs, how the timetable can {{be treated as a}} variable and how delays can be used as performance measures. The thesis also gives examples of analyses of complex traffic situations through simulation experiments. Infrastructure configuration, timetable design and delays play important roles in the competitiveness of railway transportation. This is especially true on single-track lines where the run times and other timetable related parameters are severely restricted by crossings (train meetings). The first half of this thesis focuses on the crossing time, i. e. the time loss that occurs in crossing situations. A simplified analytical model, SAMFOST, has been developed to calculate the crossing time as a function of infrastructure configuration, vehicle properties, timetable and delays for two crossing trains. Three measures of timetable flexibility are proposed and they can be used to evaluate how infrastructure configuration, vehicle properties, punctuality etc affect possibilities to alter the timetable. Double-track lines operated with mixed traffic show properties similar to those of single-tracks. In this case overtakings imply scheduled delays as well as risk of delay propagation. Two different methods are applied for analysis of double-tracks: a combinatorial, mathematical model (TVEM) and simulation experiments. TVEM, Timetable Variant Evaluation Model, is a generic model that systematically generates and evaluates timetable variants. This method is especially useful for mixed traffic operation where the impact of the timetable is considerable. TVEM may also be used for evaluation of different infrastructure designs. Analyses performed in TVEM show that the impact on capacity from the infrastructure increases with speed differences and frequency of service for the passenger trains, whereas the impact of the timetable is strongest when the speed differences are low and/or the frequency of passenger services is low. Simulation experiments were performed to take delays and perturbations into account. A simulation model was set up in the micro simulation tool RailSys and calibrated against real operational data. The calibrated model was used for multi-factor analysis through experiments where infrastructure, timetable and perturbation factors were varied according to an experimental design and evaluated through response surface methods. The additional delay was used as response variable. Timetable factors, such as frequency of high-speed services and freight train speed, turned out to be of great importance for the additional delay, whereas some of the perturbation factors, i. e. entry delays, only showed a minor impact. The infrastructure factor, distance between <b>overtaking</b> <b>stations,</b> showed complex relationships with several interactions, principally with timetable factors.

50|$|While freight has {{declined}} in importance at Erkelenz station with {{the relocation of}} heavy traffic from rail to road in the 1980s, passenger traffic has developed {{to such an extent}} that the station today is the most important stop between Aachen and Moenchengladbach, based on entry and exit numbers. From 1992 to 2001, Erkelenz station was an InterRegio stop on the route towards eastern Germany (Aachen-Chemnitz). With the conversion of the railway line to electronic interlocking operation in November 2007, the crossovers were taken out, so the station is now regarded operationally as a halt, and the new German Ks-Signal system of signalling was installed. The former third platform track was taken out of use during the remodelling so that trains can no longer <b>overtake</b> at the <b>station.</b> Later, the third track was completely dismantled.|$|R

KFMB has led in newscast viewership in the San Diego market {{for most of its}} history, dating back to the 1950s when Ray Wilson was the popular anchor of the city's first half-hour newscast. When Wilson stepped down in 1973, KFMB slipped to a distant second behind KGTV, rebounding only in the late 1970s and early 1980s when former KGTV producer Jim Holtzman was hired by the station as its news director. Holtzman formed a popular and acclaimed news team consisting of anchors Michael Tuck and Allison Ross, weather anchor Clark Anthony and sports anchor Ted Leitner. By the end of 1979, KFMB had risen back to the #1 position, remaining there until 1984 when Tuck suddenly moved to KGTV and helped that <b>station</b> <b>overtake</b> KFMB {{for the remainder of the}} decade.|$|R
5000|$|WNYT had {{overtaken}} WTEN for the runner-up spot by the late-1980s, and in 1992, scored {{its first}} late news victory over longtime leader WRGB. Gradually, the <b>station</b> <b>overtook</b> WRGB, which had lost considerable momentum {{due to the}} retirement of longtime anchor Ernie Tetrault, in other time slots. In Viacom's last sweeps period owning WNYT, the station won every time slot. It remained the overall market leader under Hubbard ownership until mid-2009 when it lost the late weeknight lead to WRGB in the May 2009 ratings period. In November 2009, WNYT's weekday evening newscasts slipped to third place {{largely due to the}} station's decision to terminate many of its popular personalities. Two years after Hubbard bought WNYT, it won the distinction of being the first and only station outside of New York City to win a regional Emmy award for best newscast in New York State. With the re-branding of the station's newscasts from News 13 to NewsChannel 13 in 1991, WNYT became the first station to use the [...] "Live. Local. Late Breaking."

50|$|WVUE's news ratings slowly {{increased}} {{throughout the}} 2000s (particularly following the station's purchase by the Louisiana Media Company). By {{the middle of}} the decade, the <b>station</b> <b>overtook</b> WDSU for the #2 position in the local news ratings, placing behind WWL-TV in the 5:00 p.m. timeslot. The station remained in second place through 2008 and a see-saw period followed. In May 2011, the station again ranked third in the 5:00 time period. The station has consistently ranked third among the market's morning and afternoon newscasts with three or more local options since that time, while posting its best ratings at night. The station bests many network primetime shows during the 9:00 p.m. hour (WVUE's ratings for its primetime newscast outperformed WNOL-TV and WUPL (channel 54)'s newscasts - both produced by their respective duopoly partners, WGNO and WWL-TV - in the same timeslots, with both of those stations eventually cancelling those programs outright), and at 10:00 p.m., WVUE has generally held second place in the market. In recent years, the station's news department has won several Regional Emmy Awards for its news coverage; it also won duPont-Columbia Awards for its breaking news coverage and investigative reporting in 2013 and 2014 and a Peabody Award in 2013 for its investigation into campaign financing in Louisiana.|$|R
25|$|In July 1991, {{the show}} began to air on KLSX in Los Angeles. Listeners jammed the station's {{switchboard}} {{during the first}} simulcast with mostly negative calls about the change. Stern rivaled with the KLOS morning team of Mark and Brian, who for three years had the area's top-rated program. In January 1992, Stern reached the number one spot in New York by <b>overtaking</b> the news <b>station</b> WINS, who had enjoyed a ten-year reign. He was reaching over one million listeners a week there, and hosted a live victory parade in Times Square to celebrate. In October 1992, Stern became {{the first person to}} have the number one show in New York and Los Angeles simultaneously, as he acquired a 9.5% market share in New York and 6.4% in Los Angeles. His victory funeral for Mark and Brian was held {{in the parking lot of}} the Los Angeles Palace Theatre in November 1992. By this time, advertisers in New York were charged as much as $3,000 per minute, and $1,500 in Los Angeles, for a one-minute commercial on the show. Following his 1992 debut on WNCX in Cleveland, Stern took the station from thirteenth in mornings to first place in under two years. On June 10, 1994, during the city's funeral broadcast William Alford, an engineer of competing station WMMS, cut a wire used for the show's satellite feed which stopped the broadcast temporarily. Alford was later sentenced to ten days in jail and a $1,000 fine.|$|R

They began working on creating a setting for the game as to be able to pitch the idea to game publishers. A 2002 demonstration version was based on the Unreal Engine 2 for the first Xbox. This demonstration was primarily set aboard a space <b>station</b> <b>overtaken</b> with genetically-mutated monsters; the main character was Carlos Cuello, a [...] "cult deprogrammer"—a person charged with rescuing someone from a cult, and mentally and psychologically readjusting that person to a normal life. Ken Levine cites an example of what a cult deprogrammer does: [...] " [...] people who hired people to [...] deprogram their daughter who had been in a lesbian relationship. They kidnap her and reprogram her, and it was a really dark person, and that was the [...] character that you were." [...] This story would have been more political in nature, with the character hired by a Senator. The team collectively agreed that this game was not what they had set out to make, and were having trouble finding a publisher.
