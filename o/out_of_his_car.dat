5|$|In Costa Mesa, California, a {{young man}} named Donald Pankow {{approaches}} the drive-thru of a Lucky Boy fast food restaurant. Despite the restaurant being closed, Pankow angrily demands service. The sheepish fast food attendant tells the man to drive to the next window, where he is attacked and violently pulled <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>car.</b> Pankow's body is later discovered with the brain removed from the skull. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) are assigned to assist the local police in their investigation.|$|E
5|$|On lap 22, Zorzi {{pulled off}} to {{the left side of the}} main straight, just after the brow of a hill and a bridge over the track. He was having {{problems}} with his fuel metering unit, and fuel was pumping directly onto the engine, which then caught fire. Zorzi did not immediately get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>car</b> as he could not disconnect the oxygen pipe from his helmet.|$|E
5|$|Derek Charles (Idris Elba) {{works for}} a finance company and is married to Sharon (Beyoncé). While Derek is at work, he greets {{temporary}} worker Lisa Sheridan (Ali Larter), who, believing Derek was flirting with her, attempts to seduce him throughout the film. Derek repeatedly rejects her, but Lisa continues to pursue him, making sexual advances on him at the Christmas party {{and at one point}} she follows him to his car in the parking garage and attempts to seduce him with revealing lingerie and fishnet stockings but Derek refuses again and forces her <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>car.</b> Derek intends to report Lisa to his firm's human resource management, but learns that she has quit her job. Thinking that Lisa has given up, Derek is annoyed when he receives flirtatious emails from her. Derek and his workmates visit a resort for a conference, where he spots and confronts Lisa, who spikes his drink. Incapacitated, Derek is helpless when Lisa follows him into his hotel room. He confronts Lisa again the following day, and hours later discovers her lying naked in his bed after attempting suicide by drug overdose, and calls for medical help.|$|E
25|$|At the 1963 Belgian Grand Prix, Amon was partnered by Lucien Bianchi {{and started}} {{ahead of him}} from 15th position. After nine laps, however, an oil fire ended his race. He {{continued}} to experience mechanical problems at the Dutch, Mexican and German Grands Prix; and after an accident in practice for the Italian Grand Prix left him hanging <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>car's</b> cockpit with three broken ribs, he missed both the Italian and United States rounds.|$|R
50|$|By {{the late}} 1990s, he was wrestling {{primarily}} in Florida, where he competed for FOW and WXO. In WXO, {{he was given}} a gimmick where he was too big to get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own <b>car.</b>|$|R
50|$|On 1 July 2006, Kanjevac was hit {{and killed}} by three of seven shots fired as he was getting <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> parked <b>car</b> on Božidara Adžije Street in Niš. Once again, whoever was {{responsible}} was never identified.|$|R
5|$|Massa {{was slow}} to {{accelerate}} leaving the turn six hairpin on lap 49, giving Alonso the opening he needed to take the lead. Smedley was later heard apologising to Massa over the radio. De La Rosa made his one and only pit stop of the event for super-soft compound tyres on lap 51. Di Grassi, at turn one on the same lap, hit a kerb damaging his car's rear suspension, which meant {{it was not possible}} for him to continue competing in the race. He was pushed into his garage by his team to retire. Vettel placed pressure on Massa by setting consecutive fastest laps to reduce the time gap between them. Petrov was on course to score one point but was told by his team to shift early into seventh gear on lap 58 otherwise his maximum revolutions per minute would be changed to a lower setting. De La Rosa attempted to lap Kovalainen around the inside of the second corner on the 60th lap but the two cars made contact. De La Rosa sustained damage to a section of his front wing while Kovalainen drove to his garage and got <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>car</b> to become the race's fifth (and final) retirement on lap 61.|$|E
5|$|Angola {{held the}} first round of its 1992 presidential {{election}} on 29–30 September. Dos Santos officially received 49.57% of the vote and Savimbi won 40.6%. As no candidate received 50% or more of the vote, election law dictated a second round of voting between the top two contenders. Savimbi, along with eight opposition parties and many other election observers, said the election had been neither free nor fair. An official observer wrote that there was little UN supervision, that 500,000 UNITA voters were disenfranchised and that there were 100 clandestine polling stations. Savimbi sent Jeremias Chitunda, Vice President of UNITA, to Luanda to negotiate the terms of the second round. The election process broke down on 31 October, when government troops in Luanda attacked UNITA. Civilians, using guns they had received from police a few days earlier, conducted house-by-house raids with the Rapid Intervention Police, killing and detaining hundreds of UNITA supporters. The government took civilians in trucks to the Camama cemetery and Morro da Luz ravine, shot them, and buried them in mass graves. Assailants attacked Chitunda's convoy on 2 November, pulling him <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>car</b> and shooting him and two others in their faces. The MPLA massacred over ten thousand UNITA and FNLA voters nationwide in a few days in what was known as the Halloween Massacre. Savimbi said the election had neither been free nor fair and refused to participate in the second round. He then proceeded to resume armed struggle against the MPLA.|$|E
5|$|Upfront, Vettel {{had reduced}} {{the gap between}} himself and Alonso to one second by lap50 as the pair {{continued}} to trade the fastest lap time. Glock started to slow on the circuit {{and drove to the}} pit lane to retire. It was later confirmed that his retirement was the result of an issue with his car's hydraulic system. With the advantage of having newer tyres which gave him more grip, Kubica was able to make short work of Alguersuari, Buemi, his teammate Petrov, Massa, Hülkenberg, and Sutil (who was holding up a queue of five cars) in the space of nine laps. Vettel continued to pressure race-leader Alonso in the closing laps as the pair began to encounter slower cars. Kovalainen and Buemi made contact in the final sector of the lap, with the latter spinning around in front of the Toro Rosso, who was quick to avoid a head-on collision. Kovalainen's car suffered a cracked fuel tank pressure release valve and he limped back to the pit lane, the rear of his Lotus catching fire during the final few turns. Kovalainen aborted the pit entry, but did not make it much further as his car was consumed by the fire. Kovalainen stopped on the main straight and got <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>car</b> to extinguish the fire himself after members of the Williams team handed him a fire extinguisher. As Kovalainen was off the racing line, yellow flags were waved in the final corners instead of a safety car deployment.|$|E
5000|$|During the 1970s, {{he pulled}} <b>out</b> one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>cars</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the race before it ended because the {{numerous}} delays made the race continue into midnight Sunday. Midnight {{is the traditional}} start to the next day; the race started on Saturday evening and eventually ended after midnight on a [...] "Sunday morning." ...|$|R

50|$|The episode {{opens with}} a car crash. Mark Benford (Joseph Fiennes) climbs <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> wrecked <b>car</b> and looks around him: there is devastation everywhere, people lie injured and/or dead in the road, cars and trucks are piled up and things are on fire. Mark calls out for his partner, Demetri Noh (John Cho).|$|R
25|$|Swift {{arrived home}} soon after Larson and Lee's invasion; he got <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>car,</b> {{went into the}} house to investigate, confronted the two, and was shot in the heart and in the thigh. He died almost {{immediately}} from his wounds. His body was not moved until nearly 6pm that afternoon.|$|E
25|$|On 18 November 1998, Hayer {{was shot}} dead while getting <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>car</b> in the garage of his home in Surrey. Hayer had survived an earlier attempt on his life in 1988, but was paralysed and used a wheelchair. As a {{consequence}} of his murder, the affidavit was inadmissible as evidence.|$|E
25|$|In December 2005, a judge issued arrest {{warrants}} for Flair after a {{road rage}} incident {{that took place}} in Charlotte, North Carolina in which Flair allegedly got <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>car,</b> grabbed a motorist by the neck, and kicked the door off the motorist's sport utility vehicle. Flair was charged with two misdemeanors, injury to personal property and simple assault and battery. This incident was ridiculed on WWE programming, most notably by the wrestler Edge.|$|E
50|$|Kevin Harvick was {{the fastest}} {{in the second}} {{practice}} session {{with a time of}} 38.706 and a speed of 186.018 mph. Martin Truex, Jr. hit the wall in turn 1 after <b>his</b> <b>car</b> cut down the left-rear tire, and this necessitated the rolling <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> backup <b>car.</b> Because this was a post-qualifying change, he was forced to start from the rear.|$|R
50|$|At about 10:45 PM, {{a uniformed}} officer got <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> police <b>car</b> {{and placed a}} package near A. D. King's front porch. The officer {{returned}} to the car. As the car drove away, someone threw a small object through the house's window onto the sidewalk, where it exploded. The object created a small but loud explosion and knocked over bystander Roosevelt Tatum.|$|R
25|$|Macleod {{also became}} a non-executive {{director}} of Lombards Bank, which allowed him a chauffeur-driven car, which he needed as his spinal disability - he was increasingly unable to move his back or neck - meant {{that he was no}} longer able to drive. Roy Jenkins recalled him arriving at Parliament and stepping <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> large <b>car</b> “like a discontented gnome” stepping out a “golden coach”.|$|R
25|$|Blake {{maintained}} a nomadic existence {{for nearly all}} {{the remainder of his}} long life. With the exception of the wartime era, he traveled {{back and forth from the}} mainland to Hawaii every year until the mid 1950s. While in Hawaii, he usually lived in a beach shack or aboard a boat; on the mainland he often lived <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>car.</b> He typically supported himself by working as a lifeguard, an occupation he pursued into his early sixties.|$|E
25|$|In 1931, Charlotte, North Carolina-born {{salesman}} Herman Lay (1909–1982) sold {{potato chips}} in the Southern United States <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>car.</b> In 1932, {{he began a}} potato chip business in Nashville, Tennessee. Lay {{was hired as a}} salesman for the Barrett Food Products Company, an Atlanta, Georgia manufacturer of Gardner's Potato Chips, and eventually took over Barrett's Nashville warehouse as a distributor. Lay hired his first salesman in 1934, and three years later had 25 employees and a larger manufacturing facility where he produced popcorn and peanut butter sandwich crackers.|$|E
25|$|On March 1, 2012, {{a federal}} appeals court threw out the 30-month {{sentence}} White received for making threats and set a new sentencing date for enhanced sentencing because {{at least one of the}} victims was a child. Also in March, White was charged and found guilty in General District Court of littering for throwing fliers <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>car.</b> On May 14, White failed to appear at the sentencing hearing and left a note at his apartment that he will not be returning, violating his supervised release. He claimed online he was moving to Iran.|$|E
50|$|On the Friday {{before the}} accident, Senna's protegé, Rubens Barrichello, driving for the Jordan team, clipped a curb and crashed heavily at 140 mph at the Variante Bassa chicane. Senna got <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Williams <b>car</b> {{and went to}} the Medical Centre. Minutes after the accident, Barrichello regained {{consciousness}} and found Senna looking over him. After learning Barrichello had survived, Senna returned to <b>his</b> <b>car</b> and continued <b>his</b> practice session.|$|R

Offstage, Effie becomes infatuated with Curtis, while the married Jimmy begins {{an affair with}} Lorrell.|$|R
50|$|As {{the sheriff}} (Greigh Phillips) drives toward the metal object, he {{encounters}} a man {{lying on the}} road, and is attacked by the man as he gets <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> patrol <b>car.</b> Nearby, another man, holding a lighted glass container, watches the fight. The sheriff is knocked out, {{and the two men}} remove something from the container. The sheriff revives, and the three drive off in the patrol car.|$|R
25|$|The {{explosion}} blew a hole measuring {{seven feet}} in diameter in the church's rear wall, and a crater five feet wide and two feet deep in the ladies' basement lounge, destroying the rear steps {{to the church and}} blowing one passing motorist <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>car.</b> Several other cars parked near the site of the blast were destroyed, and windows of properties located more than two blocks from the church were also damaged. All but one of the church's stained-glass windows were destroyed in the explosion. The sole stained-glass window largely undamaged in the explosion depicted Christ leading a group of young children.|$|E
25|$|At {{the popular}} and scenic Spa-Francorchamps circuit in Belgium, Senna took pole ahead of Patrese, Prost, Mansell, Berger, Alesi, Piquet {{and the new}} sensation, Schumacher. (After Saturday qualifying, Patrese's car was found to not comply with safety {{regulations}} and Patrese's Saturday times were wiped out, thus starting 17th). At the start, Senna defended from Prost while Piquet and Schumacher got past Alesi. However, Schumacher slowed with a clutch problem on the run down to Eau Rouge and retired. At the front, Senna led from Prost, Mansell, Berger, Piquet and Alesi. On lap 3, Prost had fuel leaking <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>car</b> and retired.|$|E
25|$|In 2013 Franchitti {{improved}} on his 2012 season. At the Indy 500, Franchitti {{was running}} in the top ten for the final restart, but got loose in turn 1 and scraped across the turn 1 wall in a similar style to Takuma Sato's 2012 accident on the final lap. This brought out a final caution that found one of Franchitti's closest friends off the track, Tony Kanaan winning his first Indy 500 and his first win in a few years. After climbing <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>car,</b> Franchitti was led to the infield hospital. Franchitti was cleared uninjured; and he walked to victory lane to hug Kanaan just before the broadcasting ended.|$|E

500|$|Saturday afternoon's {{qualifying}} session ran for 60 minutes. The session {{began with}} the slowest driver in the weekend's combined practice sessions going out first with the quickest competitor heading out last. Each driver was restricted to two timed laps. Conditions for the one-hour session were sunny and warm. Tagliani clinched his second pole position {{of the season and}} the third <b>of</b> <b>his</b> career with a time of 31.935 seconds. He was joined on the grid's front row by da Matta. Bräck qualified third, Herta fourth and Fittipaldi fifth after he made changes to make <b>his</b> <b>car</b> go faster. Papis, Jourdain, Junqueira, Jimmy Vasser and Scott Dixon rounded out the top ten fastest qualifiers. After completing his lap, Jourdain switched off his engine when smoke came <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>car's</b> left-hand side leaving turn two and qualifying was temporarily stopped to allow course officials to extract <b>his</b> <b>car.</b> Gidley was the fastest driver not to qualify in the top ten; his fastest time was five-tenths of a second off Tagliani's pace. Nakano, Andretti, [...] Kanaan, Mauricio Gugelmin qualified in positions 11th to 15th, and De Ferran, Oriol Servià, Tracy, Alex Barron and Takagi completed the top-20.|$|R
5000|$|Lee Iacocca credits Chrysler's {{chief of}} {{engineering}} during that era, Frederick Zeder, with leading the effort.

Carthan was charged with driving under the influence, wanton endangerment, and official misconduct. On January 15, 2015, Carthan was acquitted on charges of wanton endangerment, but found guilty of driving under the influence; he was ordered to pay a $500 fine. The official misconduct charge was dismissed prior to trial.|$|E
25|$|Gallagher married Patsy Kensit on 7 April 1997. However, the {{marriage}} {{got off to}} a rocky start due to various incidents reported in the tabloids. Gallagher made headlines after an incident of road rage. He allegedly leaned <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>car</b> window, grabbed a cyclist and threw him off his bike. The cyclist was not injured and Gallagher was given a caution. On 26 March 1998, Lisa Moorish bore Gallagher a daughter, Molly, who was conceived during an affair in Los Angeles in June 1997, {{just a couple of months}} after he and Kensit got married. Gallagher and Kensit's son Lennon was born on 13 September 1999. The couple divorced a year later. Gallagher's second son, Gene Gallagher, was born to Nicole Appleton on 2 July 2001.|$|E
25|$|By late Saturday afternoon, {{concerns}} were rising about driver safety on the track. Patrick Carpentier {{went to the}} medical facility to have his wrist checked (a previous injury he had suffered in a crash at Long Beach.) As an aside, he mentioned {{that he could not}} walk in a straight line for at least four minutes after he got <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>car.</b> An impromptu survey was taken during the private drivers' meeting and 21 of the 25 drivers in the starting field reported suffering disorientation and vertigo-like symptoms, including inner ear, or vision problems, after running more than 10 laps (or 20 laps). They also claimed that they had had virtually no peripheral vision and limited reaction time. This was due to sustained g-loads as high as 5.5--almost double what most persons can endure, and closer to what jet pilots usually experience in shorter time intervals.|$|E
50|$|House {{is driving}} to Brye Park's Career Day {{to speak to}} {{students}} and traumatize them for life when Foreman and Martha call about their patient. Their insistence on arguing with House distracts him from his driving and he rear-ends someone.
