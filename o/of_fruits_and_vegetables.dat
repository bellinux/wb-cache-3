5|$|Bog turtles are {{omnivorous}} and eat {{aquatic plants}} (such as duckweed), seeds, berries, earthworms, snails, slugs, insects, other invertebrates, frogs, {{and other small}} vertebrates. They also occasionally eat carrion. Invertebrates such as insects are generally the most important food item. In captivity, a bog turtle can be fed a variety <b>of</b> <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables,</b> as well as meat such as liver, chicken hearts, and tinned dog food. Bog turtles feed only during the day, but rarely during the hottest hours, consuming their food on land or in the water.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrival of}} the Mediterranean fruit flies in 1929 {{also contributed to the}} nearly {{complete}} destruction of tourism and citrus in South Florida – two vital economic industries in the region. The federal and state government would spend approximately $7million (1929USD) in eradication efforts. There were foreign and domestic bans on the importation <b>of</b> <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> from Florida. Programs established by the New Deal and efforts by Florida governors in mid and late 1930s, particularly David Sholtz, brought relief to the economic slump, but the region remained in an abysmal financial state until the onslaught of American involvement in World War II.|$|E
5|$|Vegetables play an {{important}} role in human nutrition. Most are low in fat and calories but are bulky and filling. They supply dietary fiber and are important sources of essential vitamins, minerals, and trace elements. Particularly important are the antioxidant vitamins A, C, and E. When vegetables are included in the diet, there is found to be a reduction in the incidence of cancer, stroke, cardiovascular disease, and other chronic ailments. Research has shown that, compared with individuals who eat less than three servings <b>of</b> <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> each day, those that eat more than five servings have an approximately twenty percent lower risk of developing coronary heart disease or stroke.|$|E
40|$|Background/Objectives: Perceptions that <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> are {{expensive}} {{are more common}} among the socio-economically disadvantaged groups and are linked to poor dietary outcomes. Such perceptions may be exacerbated in countries recently affected by natural disasters, where devastation <b>of</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> crops has resulted in increase in prices <b>of</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables.</b> Examining the associations <b>of</b> perceptions <b>of</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> affordability <b>and</b> children 2 ̆ 7 s diets can offer insights into how the high prices <b>of</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> might {{have an impact on}} the diets of children. Subjects/Methods: We analysed the data from 546 socio-economically disadvantaged mother–child pairs to assess the relationship between maternal perceptions <b>of</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> affordability <b>and</b> the diets of their children. Results: Fruit consumption was lower among children whose mothers felt the cost <b>of</b> <b>fruit</b> was too high. Maternal perceptions <b>of</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> affordability were not associated with any other aspect of child 2 ̆ 7 s diet.

Panta bhat (rice soaked overnight in water) with onion and green chili is a traditional dish consumed in rural areas. Common spices found in a Bengali kitchen are cumin, ajmoda (radhuni), bay leaf, mustard, ginger, green chillies, and turmeric. People of erstwhile East Bengal use a lot of ajmoda, coriander leaves, tamarind, coconut, and mustard in their cooking while those aboriginally from West Bengal use a lot of sugar, garam masala, and red chilli powder. Vegetarian dishes are mostly prepared without onion and garlic.|$|E

40|$|Objective Perceptions that <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> are {{expensive}} {{have been found}} to be associated with lower consumption <b>of</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> among disadvantaged women; however, the determinants of these perceptions are relatively unknown. The purpose of the current paper is to examine whether perceived availability <b>and</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables,</b> <b>and</b> social support for healthy eating, are associated with perceptions <b>of</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> affordability among women residing in disadvantaged neighbourhoods. Design Cross-sectional self-report survey. Setting The study was conducted in Melbourne, Australia. Subjects An Australian sample of 4131 women, aged 18 – 45 years, residing in neighbourhoods ranked in the lowest Victorian tertile of relative disadvantage by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, an index that considers aspects of disadvantage such as residents’ income, education, motor vehicle access and employment. Results Results showed that irrespective of education, income and other key covariates, women who perceived poor availability <b>and</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> in their local neighbourhood were more likely to perceive <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> as expensive. Conclusions Our results suggest that perceptions <b>of</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> affordability are not driven exclusively by lack of financial or knowledge-related resources, but also by women 2 ̆ 7 s psychological response and interpretation of their local nutrition environment. <br /...|$|R
