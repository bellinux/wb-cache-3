In this paper we describe several techniques for obtaining lower bounds <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sizes</b> of codes achieving a given multicovering radius. Our main method is a generalization of the method of linear inequalities based on refined weight distributions of the code. We also obtain a linear upper bound <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 2 -covering radius. We further study bounds <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sizes</b> of codes with a given multicovering radius that are subcodes of a fixed code. We find, for example, constraints on parity checks for codes with small ordinary covering radius...|$|R
