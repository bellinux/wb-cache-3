5|$|Modern {{critical}} commentary varies. <b>One</b> <b>critic</b> {{points out}} that the faces of the rabbits are expressionless while another argues that the cock of an ear or the position of a tail conveys what the faces lack. <b>One</b> <b>critic</b> believes the tale lacks the vitality of The Tale of Peter Rabbit which sprang from a picture and story letter to a child. Most agree though that the depictions of the garden are exquisite and some of the finest illustrations Potter created.|$|E
5|$|After its premiere, Eaten Alive {{was widely}} criticized for false advertising. <b>One</b> <b>critic</b> {{compared}} the special to The Mystery of Al Capone's Vaults—a television event {{that ended with}} a similarly disappointing outcome that did not meet promoted expectations.|$|E
5|$|In December 1961, Disney Studios {{released}} Babes in Toyland, a {{film version}} of Victor Herbert's 1903 operetta starring teen heartthrobs Annette Funicello and Tommy Sands. Though new songs with jazzy tempi were incorporated into the film and <b>one</b> <b>critic</b> was delighted with the film's colorful numbers, Babes in Toyland was neither a success nor a complete box office flop. Its gigantic toy soldiers became members of the Disneyland and Walt Disney World Christmas Parades.|$|E

5|$|Mayabazar {{became the}} first Telugu film to be {{digitally}} remastered and colourised, at an estimated cost of 75million (valued at about US$1.7million in 2010), after Hyderabad-based company Goldstone Technologies acquired world negative rights to fourteen films including that of Mayabazar in late November 2007. The updated version was released on 30 January 2010 in 45 theatres in Andhra Pradesh. It was a commercial success that generated mostly positive reviews, <b>one</b> <b>critic</b> only expressing a preference for the original.|$|E
5|$|The Chase {{received}} positive critical reception; Burns and Labbett earned positive {{reviews for}} their roles, and <b>one</b> <b>critic</b> praised the series for avoiding a slow pace in gameplay.

5|$|The North Carolina {{coaching}} staff and administration {{was criticized for}} allowing the accused players {{to participate in the}} game, with at least <b>one</b> <b>critic</b> saying the school only did so in order to better its chances to win the game. Following the game, three of the players—Varian Ballard, Greg Harris and Ricco McCain—were found guilty of simple assault. Two others were found not guilty and charges were dismissed against another. The seventh player, Kivuusama Mays, pleaded no contest to the charge.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} {{generally}} well received by music critics for being musically diverse. <b>One</b> <b>critic</b> {{also pointed out}} that it resembled some of McLaughlin's work that he released in the 1970s.

5|$|The editing of {{the events}} in {{question}} during the broadcast episodes created controversy for the show and CBS, the broadcaster of Big Brother. While the comments couldn't air due to FCC regulations, the way the events were edited caused critics and fans of the show to claim the show was being edited to make the HouseGuests look good to the viewing public. <b>One</b> <b>critic</b> suggests the recent decline in ratings {{is due to the}} editing process of the show.|$|E

5|$|The game {{features}} flip-screen and isometric gameplay, {{in similar}} vein to its predecessors, Knight Lore and Alien 8. In addition, Nightshade features an enhanced {{version of the}} Ultimate Play the Game's Filmation game engine, branded Filmation II.

5|$|After {{considering}} {{pursuing a}} master's degree {{on the topic}} of hard science fiction novels as fascist literature, Gibson discontinued writing in the year that followed graduation and, as <b>one</b> <b>critic</b> put it, expanded his collection of punk records. During this period he worked at various jobs, including a three-year stint as teaching assistant on a film history course at his alma mater. Impatient at much of what he saw at a science fiction convention in Vancouver in 1980 or 1981, Gibson found a kindred spirit in fellow panelist, punk musician and author John Shirley. The two became immediate and lifelong friends. Shirley persuaded Gibson to sell his early short stories and to take writing seriously.|$|E
5|$|The song {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics, who praised Lee's vocals and its piano accompaniment, with some highlighting {{it as one}} of the album's best tracks. Following the digital sales of Evanescence, the song charted at number 99 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number nine on the UK Rock Chart. It also charted at numbers 31, 89, and 174 on the Swiss Singles Chart, Canadian Hot 100, and UK Singles Chart respectively. The band also added the song to the set list of their third worldwide tour Evanescence Tour (2011–12). After their performances at the Carnival of Madness tour, live footage of their performances were used to make a music video for the song. The song's live performance was received positively as well; <b>one</b> <b>critic</b> noted the song's building heaviness as the band became more involved.|$|E

5|$|Headley was {{selected}} for the West Indian tour of Australia in the 1930–31 season, under the captaincy of Jackie Grant. After a brief visit to New Zealand where they played a non-first-class match against Wellington, the tourists arrived in Sydney. Headley made a good start to the tour and attracted praise from the press in Australia and West Indies. The first match of the Australian leg was against New South Wales, where the West Indians were bowled out for 188 and Headley was stumped for 25. However, his runs came {{in less than two}} overs and Learie Constantine later rated this as one of Headley's best innings. In the second innings, Headley made 82, the top score, but could not prevent the tourists losing. The next match was also lost, as Bert Ironmonger took thirteen wickets in the match for Victoria. In the first innings, Headley scored 131 out of 212, regarded by <b>one</b> <b>critic</b> {{as one of the best}} centuries scored on the ground, and top-scored again with 34 in the second innings. By this stage the Australian bowlers had realised that Headley excelled when hitting the ball through the off side, and they began to alter their tactics accordingly. In the final match before the Test series began, against South Australia, Headley had problems playing the Australian bowlers, particularly the leg spin of Clarrie Grimmett. The Australians bowled at Headley's leg stump with fielders concentrated on the leg side, making it difficult for him to score runs. Headley scored 27 and 16 as his team were heavily defeated. These bowling tactics were used in subsequent matches, and Headley found difficulty in countering them.|$|E
5|$|Speaking {{about the}} gameplay, Famitsu was {{slightly}} mixed about some aspects; <b>one</b> <b>critic</b> praised the added tutorial for allowing new players to be eased {{in the series}} gameplay, while another compared the tutorial to a nagging mother and said it and the unseen Tactician representing the player might grate with series fans. Bramwell praised the integration of RPG elements and tactical gameplay, in addition to finding the permanent death of characters a suitable fit for the game's world. Dingo was positive about the level design and controls, but warned that it was quite short and lacking in depth when compared to Final Fantasy Tactics Advance. Massimilla found the gameplay both accessible and challenging {{as she made her}} way through the game, while Nutt was skeptical about the permanent death system and critical of the in-game economy despite generally enjoying the experience. Harris again compared it to Advance Wars, but said that Fire Emblem had enough unique elements to make it its own product, and generally praised the title's accomplishments. Burns, who had experience of earlier Fire Emblem titles, praised the game as a worthy entry in the series and a good entry for the West to experience.|$|E

25|$|Before Maurice Raynal {{coined the}} term Crystal Cubism, <b>one</b> <b>critic</b> {{by the name of}} Aloës Duarvel, writing in L'Élan, {{referred}} to Metzinger's entry exhibited at Galerie Bernheim-Jeune (28 December 1915 – 15 January 1916) as 'jewellery' ("joaillerie").|$|E
25|$|In 1906 Metzinger had {{acquired}} enough prestige {{to be elected}} to the hanging committee of the Salon des Indépendants, {{in addition to his}} entry of eight works. He formed a close friendship at this time with Robert Delaunay, with whom he would share an exhibition at Berthe Weill's gallery early in 1907. The two of them were singled out by <b>one</b> <b>critic</b> (Louis Vauxcelles) in 1907 as Divisionists who used large, mosaic-like 'cubes' to construct small but highly symbolic compositions.|$|E
