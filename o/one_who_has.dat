5|$|In {{a parody}} of Dexter, after hearing a voice that he thinks is God telling him to murder people, Ned Flanders becomes a serial killing vigilante, {{targeting}} characters who are Homer's enemies. When Flanders discovers that Homer is the <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> been duping him into committing murder (by way of a Bible-shaped receiver), Homer argues that God does not exist and starts burning Ned's bible, only to be stopped and strangled to death by God Himself. Marge begs God to reverse everything that has happened, but God tells her that Satan {{is the one who}} is running the world. When Flanders thinks that this scenario cannot get any worse, it is revealed that Satan is sleeping with Ned's deceased wife, Maude.|$|E
5|$|Prison Break {{revolves}} around two brothers: <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> {{been sentenced to}} death for a crime he did not commit and his younger sibling, a genius who devises an elaborate plan to help him escape prison. The brothers, along with six other prisoners at Fox River State Penitentiary, manage to escape, and the second season follows a massive manhunt chasing the group. Dubbed the Fox River Eight, the group splits and members go their individual way, occasionally meeting up to help each other. They struggle {{to escape from the}} police while avoiding a secret group of multinationals called The Company, that wants them all dead.|$|E
5|$|The crew of a French {{salvage ship}} {{trying to raise}} a World War II-era {{submarine}} from the sea floor are stricken with massive radiation burns—except for <b>one,</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> been infected with a parasitic black oil discovered on the submarine. The oil is controlling the crewman's body, and after passing through several hosts, has overtaken Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea), whom Mulder has been pursuing. Scully finds that the submarine {{had been involved in}} discovering the oil on the sea floor during World War II, under the guise of finding a sunken fighter plane. The infected Krycek makes his way to a missile silo used to hide a UFO, and the oil escapes his body to board the craft. Meanwhile, Scully has tracked down Luis Cardinal, the man responsible for killing her sister.|$|E
60|$|There were, of course, many boys, {{who felt}} that they were in danger. Every <b>one,</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> used profane language, was aware that he might be the <b>one,</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> been overheard, and, of course, all were deeply {{interested}} in what the teacher was saying.|$|R
50|$|In the {{classical}} Arabic lexicon, the word hafiz was not traditionally {{used to refer}} to <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> memorized the Qur'an. Instead, the word used was hamil (i.e., <b>one</b> <b>who</b> carries.) Hafiz was used for the scholars of hadith, specifically <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> committed 100,000 hadiths to memory (for example, Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani).|$|R

The oil, controlling the crewman's body, passes into the crewman's wife and travels to Hong Kong {{in pursuit of a}} middleman selling government secrets, who Mulder has also been pursuing. After Mulder catches Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) in Hong Kong, the oil passes itself to Krycek. Scully finds that the submarine had been involved in discovering the oil on the sea floor during World War II, under the guise of finding a sunken fighter plane. The infected Krycek makes his way to a missile silo used to hide a UFO, and the oil escapes his body to board the craft.

5|$|The idea of Masonic brotherhood {{probably}} descends from a 16th-century {{legal definition}} of a brother as <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> taken an oath of mutual support to another. Accordingly, Masons swear at each degree to keep the contents of that degree secret, and to support and protect their brethren unless they have broken the law. In most Lodges the oath or obligation is taken on a Volume of Sacred Law, whichever book of divine revelation is appropriate to the religious beliefs of the individual brother (usually the Bible in the Anglo-American tradition). In Progressive continental Freemasonry, books other than scripture are permissible, a cause of rupture between Grand Lodges.|$|E
5|$|To {{serve as}} governor, {{one must be}} at least 30 years old, be a citizen of the United States, and have been a {{resident}} of the state {{for at least two years}} prior to election. The state constitution of 1876 originally called for election of the governor every two years, with their term beginning on the second Tuesday of the January following the election. An amendment passed in 1956, taking effect in 1959, increased terms to four years. Originally, there was no term limit applied to the governor; a 1990 amendment allowed governors to succeed themselves only once. There is however no limit on the total number of terms one may serve as long as <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> served the two term limit is out of office for four years.|$|E
