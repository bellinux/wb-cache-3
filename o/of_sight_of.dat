5|$|Gibraltar {{was part}} of a 17-ship squadron, keeping four French ships-of-the-line in Fort Royal, Martinique, when on 29April 1781 a 20-ship fleet and a {{merchant}} convoy under Contre-amiral François deGrasse arrived from Brest. Out <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> the British, deGrasse put a man ashore to swap information with Fort Royal's garrison, and agree on a plan of attack with the blockaded ships.|$|E
5|$|Before leaving, Shackleton {{instructed}} Frank Wild {{that he was}} {{to assume}} full command as soon as the James Caird departed, and that should the journey fail, he was to attempt to take the party to Deception Island the following spring. The James Caird was launched from Elephant Island on 24 April 1916. The wind was a moderate south-westerly, which aided a swift getaway, and the boat was quickly out <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> the land.|$|E
5|$|Endeavour then resumed her voyage westward {{along the}} coast, picking {{a path through}} {{intermittent}} shoals and reefs {{with the help of}} the pinnace, which was rowed ahead to test the water depth. By 26 August she was out <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> land, and had entered the open waters of the Torres Strait between Australia and New Guinea, earlier navigated by Luis Váez de Torres in 1606. To keep Endeavours voyages and discoveries secret, Cook confiscated the log books and journals of all on board and ordered them to remain silent about where they had been.|$|E

5|$|On the {{northern}} end of the battlefield, events had unfolded quite differently. Dampierre's cavalry routed Lannoy's company of light horse; the Italians and the contingent from Gruyères, meanwhile, broke and fled—leaving their officers to be killed—without offering any real resistance to the advancing Imperial infantry. As Cardona's infantry moved past the original French line, Enghien descended on it with the entire body of heavy cavalry under his command; the subsequent engagement took place on the reverse slope of the ridge, out <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> the rest of the battlefield.|$|E
5|$|Social rodents have a {{wider range}} of vocalizations than do solitary species. Fifteen {{different}} call-types have been recognized in adult Kataba mole rats and four in juveniles. Similarly, the common degu, another social, burrowing rodent, exhibits a wide array of communication methods and has an elaborate vocal repertoire comprising fifteen different categories of sound. Ultrasonic calls play a part in social communication between dormice and are used when the individuals are out <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> each other.|$|E
5|$|The volume, pitch, tempo {{and order}} of notes {{can be changed}} {{depending}} on the message the Australian raven intends to convey. There {{are a variety of}} contact calls: a pair often makes a low murmuring sound when preening each other while roosting, and members of a flock carry on with a quiet chattering while at rest. Birds make a call and answer sequence if temporarily out <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> one another while foraging. Birds in flocks make a single high-pitched caa while flying over another territory as a transit call to signify they are just passing through. An Australian raven will give a longer caa with a downward inflexion to signify its return to the nest to its mate.|$|E

5|$|With {{the score}} now 2–0 {{in favor of}} Spassky, many {{observers}} believed that the match was over and Fischer would leave Iceland, and, indeed, Fischer looked to board the next plane out of Iceland, only to be dissuaded by his second, William Lombardy. His decision {{to stay in the}} match was attributed by some to another phone call from Kissinger and a deluge of cablegrams to Fischer. Spassky, owing to his sporting spirit and respect and sympathy for Fischer, agreed to play the third game in a small room backstage, out <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> the spectators. According to Pal Benko and Burt Hochberg, this concession was a psychological mistake by Spassky.|$|E
5|$|Animals may avoid {{becoming}} prey {{by living}} out <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> predators, whether in caves, underground, or by being nocturnal. Nocturnality is an animal behavior characterized by activity {{during the night}} and sleeping during the day. This is a behavioral form of detection avoidance called crypsis used by animals to either avoid predation or to enhance prey hunting. Predation risk has long been recognized as critical in shaping behavioral decisions. For example, this predation risk is of prime importance in determining the time of evening emergence in echolocating bats. Although early access during brighter times permits easier foraging, it also leads to a higher predation risk from bat hawks and bat falcons. This results in an optimum evening emergence time that is a compromise between the conflicting demands.|$|E
5|$|During the Philippine–American War, Yorktown {{stood in}} to Baler Bay, {{on the west}} coast of Luzon, on 11 April 1899, on a mission to relieve a Spanish {{garrison}} that had been under siege by Filipino troops for nine months. Lt. James C. Gillmore and a party of sailors in the ship's whaleboat provided a decoy, ostensibly taking soundings of a nearby river. Meanwhile, Standley and an enlisted man landed farther up the coast to reconnoiter. The next day, Gillmore and his boat crew drifted into a trap, running aground too far from the river's mouth and out <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> Yorktown. Filipino troops, hidden in the jungle-covered banks, raked the boat with rifle fire. Two American sailors were killed; two were mortally wounded; and the remainder, including Gillmore, were slightly wounded. The survivors were taken prisoner until freed by U.S. Army troops. Standley completed his mission and, together with the enlisted signalman, made it back to the ship.|$|E

5|$|Out <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> {{the band}} members, {{two of the}} gunmen placed a ten-pound (4.5kg) time bomb {{in the rear of}} the minibus. The UVF's plan was that the bomb would explode once the minibus had reached Newry, killing all on board. However, Martin Dillon alleged that the bomb was meant to go off in the Irish Republic. He {{suggested}} that had all gone according to plan, the loyalist extremists would have been able to clandestinely bomb the Republic of Ireland, yet claim that the band were republican bomb-smugglers carrying explosives on behalf of the IRA. They had hoped to embarrass the Government of Ireland, as well as to draw attention to its level of control of the border. This may have resulted in the Irish authorities enforcing tighter controls over the border, thus restricting IRA operations. Dillon opined that another reason the UVF decided to target the Miami Showband was because Irish nationalists held them in high regard; to attack the band was to strike the nationalists indirectly.|$|E
5|$|Regarding {{the aerial}} imagery that the U.S. report said {{suggested}} a lower death toll, the South Korean investigators, drawing on accounts from survivors and area residents, {{said that at}} least 62 bodies had been taken away by relatives, or buried in soldiers' abandoned foxholes, {{in the first days}} after the killings, and others remained inside one underpass tunnel, under thin layers of dirt, out <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> airborne cameras, and awaiting later burial in mass graves. In addition, South Korean military specialists questioned the U.S. reconnaissance photos, pointing out irregularities, including the fact that the No Gun Ri frames had been spliced into the roll of film, raising the possibility that they were not, as claimed, from August 6, 1950, eight days after the killings.|$|E
5|$|The {{deportation}} {{policy was}} tightened during the 1730s, after {{an outbreak of}} malaria killed thousands, including the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies, Dirck van Cloon. According to Indonesian historian Benny G. Setiono, the outbreak was followed by increased suspicion and resentment in native Indonesians and the Dutch toward the ethnic Chinese, who were growing in number and whose wealth was increasingly visible. As a result, Commissioner of Native Affairs Roy Ferdinand, under orders of Governor-General Adriaan Valckenier, decreed on 25July 1740 that Chinese considered suspicious would be deported to Ceylon (modern day Sri Lanka) and forced to harvest cinnamon. Wealthy Chinese were extorted by corrupt Dutch officials who threatened them with deportation; Stamford Raffles, a British explorer and historian of Java, noted in 1830 that in some Javanese accounts, the Dutch were told by the Dutch-appointed Chinese headman of Batavia, Nie Hoe Kong, Kapitein der Chinezen, to deport all Chinese wearing black or blue because these {{were thought to be}} poor. There were also rumours that deportees were not taken to their destinations but were thrown overboard once out <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> Java, and in some accounts, they died when rioting on the ships. The deportation of ethnic Chinese caused unrest among the remaining Chinese, leading many Chinese workers to desert their jobs.|$|E

5|$|The show's {{original}} puzzle {{board had}} three rows of 13 manually operated trilons, {{for a total}} of 39 spaces. On December 21, 1981, a larger board with 48 trilons in four rows (11, 13, 13 and 11 trilons) was adopted. This board was surrounded by a double-arched border of lights which flashed {{at the beginning and end}} of the round. Each trilon had three sides: a green side to represent spaces not used by the puzzle, a blank side to indicate a letter that had not been revealed, and a side with a letter on it. While the viewer saw a seamless transition to the next puzzle, with these older boards in segments where more than one puzzle was present, a stop-down of taping took place during which the board was be wheeled offstage and the new puzzle loaded in by hand out <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> the contestants. On February 24, 1997, the show introduced a computerized puzzle board composed of 52 touch-activated monitors in four rows (12 on the top and bottom rows, 14 in the middle two). To illuminate a letter during regular gameplay, the hostess touches the right edge of the monitor to reveal it. The computerized board obviated the stop-downs, allowing tapings to finish quicker at a lower cost to the production company.|$|E
