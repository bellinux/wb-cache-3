I've studied Buddhism and Hinduism and I've been practising yoga and obviously I {{know a lot about}} Catholicism. There are indisputable truths that connect all of them, and I find that very comforting and kind. My spiritual journey is to be open to everything. Pay attention to what makes sense, be absorbed. For me, yoga is the closest thing to <b>our</b> <b>real</b> nature.|$|E

25|$|Some of his assertions seem {{paradoxical}} {{and difficult}} to understand at first glance, {{not only because they}} are taken out of context, but above all because our habits of thought make us reduce everything to its visible appearance in the world instead of trying to attain its invisible reality in life. It is this separation between visible appearance and invisible reality which allows the dissimulation of <b>our</b> <b>real</b> feelings and which grounds the possibility of sham and hypocrisy, which are forms of lies.|$|E

He called on supporters [...] "to strike fear {{in the hearts of}} the white man, <b>our</b> <b>real</b> enemy", and accused his black opponents of being dupes of the whites. Amid growing internal opposition to his government, he remained determined to stay in power. He revived the regular use of revolutionary rhetoric and sought to reassert his credentials as an important revolutionary leader.|$|E

500|$|On August 10, 1781, the Canadian Regiment was reassigned {{from the}} Northern Department to the Main Army. On August 19, Washington used the {{regiment}} to feint preparations {{for an attack}} on New York. It crossed the Hudson River at Dobbs Ferry and was ordered to march, together with New Jersey troops, to posts on the heights between Springfield and Chatham, in which position the detachment would cover a French battery {{that had been set}} up at Chatham [...] "to veil <b>our</b> <b>real</b> movements and create apprehensions for Staten Island." [...] Meanwhile, {{the main body of the}} American Army was starting their southward movement toward Yorktown. The regiment withdrew, and held near Kakiat for three days from August 22–25.|$|E

This year <b>our</b> <b>real</b> hope is to make a crossover that's even bigger, and even more rewarding for the audience than the last years. The scripts for the [...] "Heroes Join Forces" [...] crossover were written in September 2015. Berlanti created the story for the event, and Kreisberg and Guggenheim helped to craft the story of The Flash and Arrow episodes, respectively. The teleplay for The Flash was written by showrunners Aaron and Todd Helbing; Arrows was written by Brian Ford Sullivan and Guggenheim.|$|E
500|$|Alf Ramsey {{took control}} of the team in 1962, but unlike Winterbottom, Ramsey had been a club manager, winning the League {{championship}} with Ipswich Town. [...] Upon his appointment, he declared England would win the 1966 World Cup. [...] His first match in charge resulted in a 5–2 loss at Parc des Princes against France. England automatically qualified for the 1966 World Cup as hosts and, after a goalless draw in the first match against Uruguay, four consecutive victories saw England through to the final against West Germany. [...] A 4–2 victory, after extra time, won England the World Cup for the only time. As a result of his and England's achievements, Ramsey was awarded a knighthood in 1967. The following year England finished third in the 1968 European Championship in Rome, but Ramsey reflected [...] "We are world champions.

500|$|As an {{illustration}} of the place hockey holds in the Canadian psyche, the Bank of Canada placed {{a line from the}} story on the reverse of the 2001 series five-dollar bill, making Carrier the first author to be quoted on a Canadian banknote. The line, appearing in both French and English is: « Les hivers de mon enfance étaient des saisons longues, longues. Nous vivions en trois lieux : l’école, l’église et la patinoire; mais la vraie vie était sur la patinoire. » / [...] "The winters of my childhood were long, long seasons. We lived in three places– the school, the church and the skating rink– but <b>our</b> <b>real</b> life was on the skating rink." [...] It is accompanied by scenes of children playing outdoors in the winter, centred by one in a Montreal Canadiens' sweater with Maurice Richard's number 9 on his back.|$|E
500|$|In {{the wake}} of Labour's second defeat at the Scottish Parliament {{election}} of May 2011, which saw the Scottish National Party (SNP) form its first majority government, Gray announced his intention to step down {{as leader of the}} Labour MSPs later that year. A review chaired by Jim Murphy and Sarah Boyack into the party's structure in Scotland subsequently concluded that the next leader should lead the entire Scottish Labour Party rather than just its MSPs, as previous leaders had. Lamont declared her candidacy for the leadership election in September 2011 and launched her campaign on 7 November at Stirling University. She told delegates that Labour needed to reengage with the electorate if it wanted to govern again: [...] "We must listen and learn, show humility and seek again to talk for and to people's ambitions and concerns. <b>Our</b> <b>real</b> challenge is that we in Labour lost our way, lost our confidence and lost Scotland." ...|$|E
500|$|After filming, twenty {{hours of}} raw footage was {{recorded}} {{which had to}} be cut down to two-and-a-half hours; the editing process took more than eight months. The directors screened the first cut in small film festivals in order to get feedback and make changes that would ensure that it appealed to as large an audience as possible. Originally, it was hoped that the film would make it on to cable television, and the directors did not anticipate wide release. The final version was submitted to Sundance Film Festival. After a surprise hit during its midnight premiere on January 25, 1999, Artisan Entertainment bought the distribution rights for $1.1 million. Prior to that, Artisan had wanted to change the film's original endingin which Donahue screams in terror and finds Michael C. Williams facing a corner in the basement before being knocked overas a number of test audiences were somewhat puzzled even though they admitted being scared with it. The directors and Williams traveled back to Maryland and four alternate endings were shot, one of which employed gory elements. Ultimately, they decided to keep the original, with Myrick explaining, [...] "What makes us fearful is something that's out of the ordinary, unexplained. The first ending kept the audience off balance; it challenged <b>our</b> <b>real</b> world conventions and that's what really made it scary." ...|$|E

I do not wish to conceal <b>our</b> <b>real</b> state, because I do not believe there is a man here who is afraid to face any sort of danger. We {{are in a position to}} defend ourselves against regular troops, far less a set of naked savages, with their spears and krisses. It is true they have swivels in their boats, but they cannot act here. I have not observed that they have any muskets, but if they have, so have we. When we were first thrown on shore we could only muster seventy-five musket ball cartridges [...] we now have sixteen hundred. They cannot send up, I believe, more than five hundred men; but with two hundred such as now stand around me, I do not fear a thousand [...] nor fifteen hundred of them. The pikemen standing firm, we will give them such a volley of musketry as they will be little prepared for; and when they are thrown into confusion, we will sally out, chase them into the water, and ten to one but we secure their vessels. let every man be on the alert, and should these barbarians this night attempt our hill, I trust we shall convince them they are dealing with Britons.|$|E

2500|$|The Tibetan Vajrayana {{tradition}} {{is based on}} Madhyamaka philosophy and Tantra. In deity yoga, visualizations of deities are eventually dissolved, to realize the inherent emptiness of every-'thing' that exists. Dzogchen, which is being taught in both the Tibetan buddhist Nyingma school and the Bön tradition, focuses on direct insight into <b>our</b> <b>real</b> nature. It holds that [...] "mind-nature" [...] is manifested when one is enlightened, being nonconceptually aware (rigpa, [...] "open presence") of one's nature, [...] "a recognition of one's beginningless nature." [...] Mahamudra has similarities with Dzogchen, emphasizing the meditational approach to insight and liberation.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the behavior of}} the long-run U. S. /U. K. real exchange rate from 1885 to 1995. <b>Our</b> long-run <b>real</b> exchange rate series is derived from an unobserved components model which divides the real exchange rate into permanent and transitory components. The transitory component is modeled as having variances which switch, according to a Markov-switching process, among low, medium and high variance states. The underlying assumptions of our time-series model are based on an economic theory in which the permanent component represents real influences, while the transitory component represents primarily short-run movements due to nominal exchange rate fluctuations. Because the model is difficult to estimate by standard methods, we describe how the method of Gibbs sampling can handle this model. We find that <b>our</b> long-run <b>real</b> exchange rate series moves similarly to other measures proposed in the literature based on economic models. ...|$|R
