40|$|Delirium is {{a common}} neuropsychiatric {{syndrome}} with considerable heterogeneity in clinical profile. Identification of clinical subtypes can allow for more targeted clinical and research efforts. We sought to develop a brief method for clinical subtyping in clinical and research settings. A multi-site database, including motor symptom assessments conducted in 487 patients from palliative care, adult and <b>old</b> <b>age</b> consultation-liaison <b>psychiatry</b> services was used to document motor activity disturbances as per the Delirium Motor Checklist (DMC). Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify the class structure underpinning DMC data and also items for a brief subtyping scale. The concordance of the abbreviated scale was then compared with the original Delirium Motor Subtype Scale (DMSS) in 375 patients having delirium as per the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (4 th edition) criteria. Latent class analysis identified four classes that corresponded closely with the four recognized motor subtypes of delirium. Further, LCA of items (n = 15) that loaded > 60 % to the model identified four features that reliably identified the classes/subtypes, and these were combined as a brief motor subtyping scale (DMSS- 4). There was good concordance for subtype attribution between the original DMSS and the DMSS- 4 (κ = 0. 63). The DMSS- 4 allows for rapid assessment of clinical subtypes in delirium and has high concordance with the longer and well-validated DMSS. More consistent clinical subtyping in delirium can facilitate better delirium management and more focused research effor...|$|R

In this article the Hellenic College of Academic Psychiatry (HCAP) recommend {{the recognition of the}} above mentioned subspecialties in Greece. The HCAP was constituted as an inter-university organization having as one of its aims to coordinate efforts to modernize and harmonize the academic educational programs in psychiatry nationwide in Greece. We also present the process followed by the HCAP members and the final consensus texts reached for training in the three subspecialties. These guidelines specify the special training, knowledge and skills required as well as the organization and assessment of training. Accredited subspecialties programmes increase focus and research in their field as well as upgrading their influence in academic centres, thus contributing to optimisation of the training of medical students and psychiatric residents. Lastly, the accreditation of the three subspecialties will ameliorate the care of patients that belong to specific populations such as patients with medical and psychiatric comorbidity, the elderly who suffer from mental illnesses and the patients who need forensic assessment and intervention.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the place of}} <b>old</b> <b>age</b> in British <b>psychiatry,</b> from 1835 - 1912. It asks: how were mental disorders in <b>old</b> <b>age</b> understood, categorised and responded to? It seeks {{answers to these questions}} in three sets of sources: theoretical published works written by professional psychiatrists, the official reports of the bodies charged with managing the asylum at a national and local level, and in the patient records of Hanwell County Lunatic Asylum. It argues that the ‘senile’ became more clearly defined in the latter nineteenth century, in politics and in medicine, as a residual category of person: too insane for the workhouse, too old for the asylum. It shows that, during this period, older people in the asylum were increasingly likely to be viewed as ‘old’. Through the increasing focus on internal pathology as an aetiological determinant of mental disorder, both engendered and reflected in changes to the asylum’s patient records, the inherent agedness of older people – with associations of inevitable decline, incurability and dependency – became central to the way that psychiatrists interpreted their mental disorders. The senile were a controversial group in nineteenth-century psychiatry. The administrators of Lunacy made attempts to exclude them from the asylum, but families and workhouse officials continued to send them there. The asylum {{played an important role in}} latter-nineteenth-century London as a pressure-valve for those whose behaviour made them unmanageable in other settings. Without more specialised provision, the asylum was often the only institution which could manage the elderly mentally disordered. Once there, aged patients worked and were cared for alongside the rest of the asylum population, usually until their death...|$|R

40|$|<b>Old</b> <b>age</b> {{has many}} images, {{with the one}} of a crisis regaining momentum. While images of {{activity}} and opportunity gained ground during recent decades, this trend now seems to reverse. The current economic crisis drains the financial resources of older people, which increases <b>old</b> <b>age</b> poverty. Moreover, governments react to the double-pressure of economic crises and population ageing through budget cuts, which reduces support systems for older people. It, moreover, centers public discourses more strongly on social problems associated with <b>old</b> <b>age.</b> Both developments underline the needs associated with <b>old</b> <b>age</b> and draw our {{attention away from the}} potentials of <b>old</b> <b>age.</b> In other words, they bring discussions on <b>old</b> <b>age</b> back to the topic of crises.

"Accessible summary While the decision to use restraint and seclusion was not taken lightly, nurse participants felt that there were no effective alternatives to the use of these measures. Adverse interpersonal, physical and practice environments contributed to the onset of aggression in <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>psychiatry</b> inpatient settings. Policies to reduce or eliminate the use of restraint and seclusion need to take account of wide-ranging strategies to deal with aggression, including the provision of appropriate education and support and addressing ethical and workplace cultural issues associated with these practices. Abstract Restraint and seclusion are often ineffective and can affect patients adversely. In this study, we explored nurses' experiences of restraint and seclusion in short-stay acute <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>psychiatry</b> inpatient units and how these experiences underpin resistance to eliminating these practices. Qualitative interviews were conducted with nurses in three <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>psychiatry</b> units in Melbourne, Australia. The results provide one overarching theme, lack of accessible alternatives to restraint and seclusion, indicating that nurses believe there are no effective, accessible alternatives to these practices. Three related themes contribute to this perception. First, an adverse interpersonal environment contributes to restraint and seclusion, which relates to undesirable consequences of poor staff-to-patient relationships. Second, an unfavourable physical environment contributes to aggression and restraint and seclusion use. Third, the practice environment influences the adoption of restraint and seclusion. The findings contribute to the limited evidence about nurses' experiences of these practices in short-stay <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>psychiatry,</b> and how account needs to be taken of these experiences and contextual influences when introducing measures to address these practices. Policies addressing these measures need to be accompanied by wide-ranging initiatives to deal with aggression, including providing appropriate education and support and addressing ethical and workplace cultural issues surrounding these practices...|$|E
