5|$|Kami, Perempoean (Perfected Spelling: Kami, Perempuan; Indonesian for We, the Women) is a 1943 stage play in one act by Armijn Pane. The six-character drama {{revolves}} around {{a conflict between}} two couples, with the women considering the men cowards for not wanting to join the Defenders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Homeland</b> and the men afraid of how the women will react to them having secretly joined. Despite warnings from the women's mother and father, the men prepare to leave for their training, with their partner's blessings.|$|E
5|$|Written {{during the}} Japanese {{occupation}} of the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), while Pane was {{an employee of the}} Cultural Centre in Jakarta, Kami, Perempuan is similar to contemporary plays owing to its openly pro-Japanese message and emphasis on everyday issues experienced by average people. Discussions of the play have found it to be pro-Japanese propaganda, suggesting that men should join the military to please their women, though it has also been suggested that the play is in fact a warning against accepting the Defenders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Homeland</b> as being for Indonesia. Kami, Perempuan was performed numerous times in 1943, and its script has been compiled in a book.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} <b>the</b> question <b>of</b> {{whether and}} how a study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> costs and benefits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>homelands</b> might be conducted. It is concluded that cost benefit studies of different designs are possible. As others previously have established beyond reasonable doubt, there are positive health benefits from homelands living. Current policy statements by governments regarding centralization of services (and inevitably populations) are a threat to this improved health and, in the current parlance surrounding Aboriginal health, risk widening the health gap rather than closing it. Compiling this report has involved examining in some detail the evidence that exists on the benefits in particular but also <b>the</b> costs <b>of</b> <b>homelands</b> living. There is solid evidence on <b>the</b> health benefits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>homelands.</b> <b>The</b> evidence on <b>the</b> costs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>homelands</b> is not as solid but it does suggest {{that they are not}} large and may even involve cost savings to governments. Strangely too the extent to which equity figures as a consideration in debating <b>the</b> <b>homelands</b> is largely absent. The paper argues that it ought not to be. Research for this report has unearthed no evidence to support those current government policies which threaten <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>homelands</b> movement. An interim moratorium on policy action on <b>the</b> <b>homelands</b> is proposed until findings are available from <b>the</b> sorts <b>of</b> studies suggested in this report. Only then, once good evidence in a cost benefit framework is available, ought policy decisions be made about <b>the</b> future <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>homelands</b> movement...|$|R

5|$|Born in Purbalingga, Dutch East Indies, Sudirman {{moved to}} Cilacap in 1916 and {{was raised by}} his uncle. A diligent student at a Muhammadiyah-run school, he became {{respected}} within the community for his devotion to Islam. After dropping out of teacher's college, in 1936 he began working as a teacher, and later headmaster, at a Muhammadiyah-run elementary school. After the Japanese occupied the Indies in 1942, Sudirman continued to teach, before joining the Japanese-sponsored Defenders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Homeland</b> as a battalion commander in Banyumas in 1944. In this position he put down a rebellion by his fellow soldiers, but was later interned in Bogor. After Indonesia proclaimed its independence on 17 August 1945, Sudirman led a break-out then went to Jakarta to meet President Sukarno. Tasked with overseeing the surrender of Japanese soldiers in Banyumas, he established {{a division of the}} People's Safety Body there. On 12 November 1945, at an election to decide the military's commander-in-chief in Yogyakarta, Sudirman was chosen over Oerip Soemohardjo in a close vote. While waiting to be confirmed, Sudirman ordered an assault on British and Dutch forces in Ambarawa. The ensuing battle and British withdrawal strengthened Sudirman's popular support, and he was ultimately confirmed on 18 December.|$|E
5|$|Winkelman acted both in his {{capacity}} of commander of the Dutch Army and of highest executive power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>homeland.</b> This created a somewhat ambiguous situation. On the morning of 14 May {{the commander of the}} Royal Dutch Navy, Vice-Admiral Johannes Furstner, had left the country to continue the fight; Dutch naval vessels were generally not included in the surrender. Eight ships and four unfinished hulks had already departed, some smaller vessels were sunk off, and nine others sailed for England in the evening of 14 May. The Hr. Ms. Johan Maurits van Nassau was sunk by German bombers while crossing. The commander of the main Dutch naval port of Den Helder, Rear-Admiral Hoyte Jolles, concluded that his base, with a naval garrison of 10,000, its own air service, and extensive land defences, should continue to resist also. Only with some difficulty did Winkelman convince him to obey the surrender order. Large parts of the Dutch Army were also reluctant to believe or accept the surrender, especially those units that hardly had seen any fighting, such as 3rd and 4th Army Corps and Brigade A.|$|E
