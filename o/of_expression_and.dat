Egyptian political scientist Alaa al-Din Desouki blamed the 1952 revolution's shortcomings on Nasser's concentration of power, and Egypt's lack of democracy on Nasser's political style and his government's limitations on freedom <b>of</b> <b>expression</b> <b>and</b> political participation.|$|E
5|$|The New Walford Guide to Reference Resources {{praised the}} FEPP website for its links to {{resources}} on freedom <b>of</b> <b>expression</b> <b>and</b> censorship.

40|$|This paper {{reviewed}} the relationship existing between the recognition <b>of</b> emotional <b>expressions</b> <b>and</b> identities in faces. First, we {{reviewed the}} studies which {{suggested that the}} recognition <b>of</b> <b>expressions</b> <b>and</b> identities was mediated through independent processes. Although this hypothesis of independence was supported in several areas of research, recent studies suggested that two of these processes were not completely independent. Therefore, we reviewed the studies which supported {{the idea that there}} was an interaction of the processing <b>of</b> <b>expressions</b> <b>and</b> identities. Finally, we argued that future studies should focus on the individual differences of the interaction <b>of</b> <b>expressions</b> <b>and</b> identities using a selective attention paradigm to contribute to the issues of social communication...|$|R

Atkins stated that Hope wrote highly structured, complex compositions that {{he played with}} improvisational flexibility.

5|$|Ti Noel {{has been}} {{considered}} a product of creolization, combining the African magical perspective of Macandal with the Catholic realism of Henri Christophe.

In this sense, magic realism is a necessary tool <b>of</b> <b>expression</b> <b>and</b> the technique serves to confront the novel's hero, better develop his purpose as a man, and advance a simultaneously profound and straightforward understanding of the human experience.|$|E
