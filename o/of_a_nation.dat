Spielberg became the first director to break his own record when Jurassic Park overtook E.T., and Cameron emulated the feat when Avatar broke the record set by Titanic.|$|E
5|$|In 1914 he had {{a highly}} publicized meeting with President Woodrow Wilson, in which he protested Wilson's {{introduction}} of segregation into the federal workplace. In Boston, Trotter succeeded in 1910 in shutting down productions of The Clansman but he was unsuccessful in 1915 with screenings of the movie The Birth <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Nation,</b> which also portrayed the Ku Klux Klan in favorable terms. He {{was not able to}} influence the peace talks at the end of World War I, and was in later years a marginalized voice of protest. In an alliance with Roman Catholics, in 1921 he did get a revival screening banned of The Birth <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Nation.</b> He died on his 62nd birthday after a possibly suicidal fall from his Boston home.|$|E

5|$|Some sources {{claim that}} The Big Parade {{superseded}} The Birth <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Nation</b> as highest-grossing film, eventually {{being replaced by}} Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, which in turn was quickly usurped by Gone with the Wind. Exact figures are not known for The Birth <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Nation,</b> but contemporary records put its worldwide earnings at $5.2 million as of 1919. Its international release was delayed by World War I, {{and it was not}} released in many foreign territories until the 1920s; coupled with further re-releases in the United States, its $10 million earnings as reported by Variety in 1932 are consistent with the earlier figure. At this time, Variety still had The Birth <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Nation</b> ahead of The Big Parade ($6,400,000) on distributor rentals and—if its estimate is correct—Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs ($8,500,000) would not have earned enough on its first theatrical run to take the record; although {{it would have been the}} highest-grossing 'talkie', displacing The Singing Fool ($5,900,000). Although received wisdom holds that it is unlikely The Birth <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Nation</b> was ever overtaken by a silent-era film, the record would fall to 1925's Ben-Hur ($9,386,000) if The Birth <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Nation</b> earned significantly less than its estimated gross. In addition to its gross rental earnings through public exhibition, The Birth <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Nation</b> played at a large number of private, club and organizational engagements which figures are unavailable for. It was hugely popular with the Ku Klux Klan who used it to drive recruitment, and at one point Variety estimated its total earnings to stand at around $50 million. Despite later retracting the claim, the sum has been widely reported even though it has never been substantiated. While it is generally accepted that Gone with the Wind took over the record of highest-grossing film on its initial release—which is true in terms of public exhibition—it is likely it did not overtake The Birth <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Nation</b> in total revenue until a much later date, with it still being reported as the highest earner up until the 1960s. Gone with the Wind itself may have been briefly overtaken by The Ten Commandments (1956), which closed at the end of 1960 with worldwide rentals of $58–60 million compared to Gone with the Winds $59 million; if it did claim the top spot its tenure there was short-lived, since Gone with the Wind was re-released the following year and increased its earnings to $67 million. Depending on how accurate the estimates are, the 1959 remake of Ben-Hur may also have captured the record from Gone with the Wind: as of the end of 1961 it had earned $47 million worldwide, and by 1963 it was trailing Gone with the Wind by just $2 million with international takings of $65 million, ultimately earning $66 million from its initial release.|$|E
5|$|Because The Birth <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Nation</b> {{attracted}} increased scrutiny due {{to possible}} Oscar nominations, {{and the film}} itself depicts a brutal rape, there was significant press coverage about damage control by Fox Searchlight Pictures, the studio releasing the film.

5|$|Du Bois {{used his}} {{influential}} {{role in the}} NAACP to oppose a variety of racist incidents. When the silent film The Birth <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Nation</b> premiered in 1915, Du Bois and the NAACP led the fight to ban the movie, because of its racist portrayal of blacks as brutish and lustful. The fight was not successful, and possibly contributed to the film's fame, but the publicity drew many new supporters to the NAACP.|$|E

5|$|For {{over seven}} years, Parker worked on making a film {{based on the}} life of Nat Turner. In 2014, he {{announced}} that he had funding and was working on assembling his team, and that the film would be called The Birth <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Nation,</b> in an ironic reappropriation of the infamously racist 1915 film of the same name. In addition to writing and directing, Parker cast himself as Turner. Aja Naomi King, Armie Hammer and Gabrielle Union were also cast in key roles.|$|E
5|$|In {{international}} politics, {{food power}} {{is the use of}} agriculture as a means of political control whereby one nation or group of nations offers or withholds commodities from another nation or group of nations in order to manipulate behavior. Its potential use as a weapon was recognised after OPEC’s earlier use of oil as a political weapon. Food has a major influence on political actions <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>nation.</b> In response to acts of food power, a nation usually acts in the interest of its citizens to provide food.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, {{fried chicken}} has stereotypically been {{associated}} with African-Americans. The reasons for this are various. Chicken dishes were popular among slaves before the Civil War, as chickens were generally the only animals slaves were allowed to raise on their own. Minstrel shows and the film The Birth <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Nation</b> led to a prevalent stereotype associating African-Americans with fried chicken.|$|E

5|$|The KKK had {{a revival}} {{for a decade}} after 1915, {{especially}} in industrial cities and the Midwest. In 1921, Trotter was successful in shutting down new screenings of The Birth <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Nation</b> in Boston; he allied with Roman Catholic organizations, who objected to the KKK's anti-Catholic stance of the 20th century, and were strong in {{the city as a}} result of extensive Irish and Italian immigration.|$|E
5|$|A common {{language}} {{may have been}} seen {{to serve as the}} basis <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>nation,</b> but as contemporary historians of 19th-century Germany noted, it took more than linguistic similarity to unify these several hundred polities. The experience of German-speaking Central Europe during the years of French hegemony contributed to a sense of common cause to remove the French invaders and reassert control over their own lands. The exigencies of Napoleon's campaigns in Poland (1806–07), the Iberian Peninsula, western Germany, and his disastrous invasion of Russia in 1812 disillusioned many Germans, princes and peasants alike. Napoleon's Continental System nearly ruined the Central European economy. The invasion of Russia included nearly 125,000 troops from German lands, and the loss of that army encouraged many Germans, both high- and low-born, to envision a Central Europe free of Napoleon's influence. The creation of student militias such as the Lützow Free Corps exemplified this tendency.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} element in nation-building, {{the story of the}} heroic past, fell to such nationalist German historians as the liberal constitutionalist Friedrich Dahlmann (1785–1860), his conservative student Heinrich von Treitschke (1834–1896), and others less conservative, such as Theodor Mommsen (1817–1903) and Heinrich von Sybel (1817–1895), to name two. Dahlmann himself died before unification, but he laid the groundwork for the nationalist histories to come through his histories of the English and French revolutions, by casting these revolutions as fundamental to the construction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>nation,</b> and Dahlmann himself viewed Prussia as the logical agent of unification.|$|E

5|$|Born in Lancaster, Ohio, Sherman later {{moved to}} Mansfield, where {{he began a}} law career before {{entering}} politics. Initially a Whig, Sherman was among those anti-slavery activists who formed what became the Republican Party. He served three terms in the House of Representatives. As {{a member of the}} House, Sherman traveled to Kansas to investigate the unrest between pro- and anti-slavery partisans there. He rose in party leadership and was nearly elected Speaker in 1859. Sherman was elevated to the Senate in 1861. As a senator, he was a leader in financial matters, helping to redesign the United States' monetary system to meet the needs <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>nation</b> torn apart by civil war. After the war, he worked to produce legislation that would restore the nation's credit abroad and produce a stable, gold-backed currency at home.|$|E
5|$|Following the Act of 1819, in 1820 the Court {{began to}} {{distinguish}} Palmer. In United States v. Klintock (1820), the Court distinguished Palmerin {{a case involving}} piracy by a U.S. citizen, claiming to act {{under the authority of}} the Mexican Republic, committed against a Danish ship and citizens, under the fraudulent claim that the Danes were Spanish (Spain being at war with the Mexican Republic)on the grounds that the victims in Palmer were not subjects <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>nation</b> recognized by the United States. In United States v. Furlong (1820), sometimes referred to as United States v. Pirates, authored by Justice Johnson (a dissenter in Palmer), the Court distinguished Palmer again, primarily on the ground that the pirate vessel had no nationality (it was an American ship prior to being hijacked). United States v. Holmes (1820) distinguished Palmer on the same ground, further holding that the burden was on the defendant to prove that his vessel flew a lawful flag.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} years of the silent film era, from the 1890s, films were {{generally}} accompanied by live music, often improvised, provided by piano or pump organ. In the early 20th century, larger cinemas began to use orchestras, which would accompany the film with out-of-copyright classical pieces or, increasingly, with original compositions. The score for the 1916 classic The Birth <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Nation,</b> compiled by Joseph Carl Breil from various classical works and some original writing, was a landmark in film music, and inspired notable composers of the day to provide scores for silent films. Among these were the Americans Victor Herbert and Mortimer Wilson, from France Darius Milhaud and Arthur Honegger, and the Germans Gottfried Huppertz and Edmund Meisel.|$|E
