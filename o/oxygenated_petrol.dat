40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the effect of oxygenated oleic acid additives in standard petrol on the engine performance and the exhaust emissions. The 4 -stroke 1. 5 litre engine was used on the engine test bed coupled to eddy current electric dynamometer which is also connected to CADET V 12 control system and exhaust gas analyser IMR 2000 / 2000 P. The oxygenated oleic acid additives used for this experiment is fixed at 0. 2 % by volume due to limited quantity available. Two types of test were carried out first test is with variable speed and no loads and the second test is at constant speed of 1, 400 rpm with variable loads. The experimental results showed that the brake power increased by 2 %, torque by 2 %, brake thermal efficiency by about 7 % and specific fuel consumption decreased by about 10 %. The exhaust emissions analysed are carbon monoxide, (CO), carbon dioxide (CO 2) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx). The result by comparing the <b>oxygenated</b> <b>petrol</b> with the standard petrol indicated that CO gas emission depend on the engine speed which decreased with increasing speed up to 1, 600 rpm and increased after that speed on test without load. The CO also decreased by about 28 % on the test with loads. The emission of CO 2 increased by 2. 7 % for tests with load and by 8 % for tests without loads. The NOx emission decreased by 9 % for test without load and about 7 % for test with load. This study indicates that engine performance is improved by adding 0. 2 % oxygenated additives to standard petro...|$|E
40|$|Aim In {{the context}} of the Italian Multicentric Epidemiological Study on Risk Factors for Childhood Leukaemia and Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (SETIL), the risk of {{childhood}} cancer was investigated in relation to parental occupational exposures. Methods All cases of childhood leukaemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) in children aged 0 - 10 years were identified. Controls were chosen at random from the local population in each region. Parents were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. The collected data were blindly reviewed by expert industrial hygienists in order to estimate exposure to a list of agents. Statistical analyses were performed for each agent using unconditional multivariable logistic regression models, taking into account timing of exposure. Results 683 cases of acute childhood leukaemia, 97 cases of NHL and 1044 controls were identified. Increased risk of childhood leukaemia was found for maternal exposure to aliphatic (OR 4. 3) or aromatic hydrocarbons (OR 3. 8) in the preconception period, and for paternal exposure to diesel exhaust (OR 1. 4), lead exposure (OR 1. 4) and mineral oils (OR 1. 7). Risk of NHL appeared to be related to paternal exposure to oxygenated solvents (OR 2. 5) and petrol exhaust (OR 2. 2). Conclusions We found increased risk for childhood leukaemia associated with maternal occupational exposure to aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons, particularly in the preconception period; increased risks were also observed for paternal exposure to diesel exhaust fumes, mineral oils and lead. The risk of NHL appeared to be related to paternal exposure to <b>oxygenated</b> solvent and <b>petrol</b> exhausts...|$|R
