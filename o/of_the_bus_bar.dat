40|$|Accuracy in the {{measurement}} of solar cell performance attains more and more economic significance additionally to its importance in technology development. Measurement of bare (without additional interconnectors on the bus bars) wafer based silicon solar cells directly in production with a high relative accuracy is important for cell sorting and a high absolute accuracy is necessary for valuation of the product. The calibration of the references used to set the cell testers focuses on the precision of ISC measurement, but for the valuation the maximum power at standard testing conditions is the decisive number. Therefore the fill factor determination is a critical point which depends on the specific implementation of the four wire measurement technique.

40|$|After the {{incident}} of September 2008, the operational beam {{energy of the}} LHC has been set to 3. 5 TeV, since not all joints of the superconducting (SC) bus bars between magnets have the required quality for 7 TeV operation. This decision is based on simulations to determine the safe current in the main dipole and quadrupole circuits, reproducing the thermal behaviour of a quenched superconducting joint by taking into account all relevant factors that affect a possible thermal runaway. One important parameter is the Residual Resistivity Ratio (RRR) of the copper stabilizer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> <b>bar</b> connecting the superconducting magnets. A dedicated campaign to measure the RRR for the main 13 kA circuits of the LHC in all sectors was performed during the Christmas stop in December 2010 and January 2011.

40|$|The first long {{shutdown}} (LS 1) of the LHC {{machine at}} CERN started in February 2013. The main trigger for LS 1 was the consolidation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> <b>bar</b> joints in the 13 -kA superconducting magnet circuits. Before LS 1, the copper continuity of these joints was not sufficiently good {{to ensure a}} safe passage of the current {{in case of a}} quench in the superconducting cable at currents larger than 7 - 8 kA. The consolidation mainly consists in adding shunts made of high conductivity copper across each joint connecting the bus bars of the neighboring magnets in order to ensure the copper continuity. After LS 1, the LHC can then be operated up to the original nominal conditions, i. e., a collision energy of 14 TeV. There are 1695 interconnects, each containing six 13 -kA joints, of which two belong to the main dipole circuit and four to the main quadrupole circuits. This paper describes the different steps of the consolidation work performed on the 10 170 magnet-to-magnet joints.

40|$|On the way {{to higher}} efficiencies, back contact solar cells {{seem to be a}} {{promising}} alternative to conventional screen-printed solar cells. Especially, the MWT (metal wrap through) solar cell concept with only two additional process steps compared with the conventional cell process is appropriate for a fast transfer to industry. Hence, a pilot-line process based on a new contact design was developed and tested. A batch of 80 mc-Si MWT solar cells was successfully produced at ISE's PV-TEC pilot-line. Cell efficiencies up to 16 % are achieved in this first run. Compared with conventionally processed cells made <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same mc Si-block, an efficiency gain up to 0. 4 % is observed.

40|$|Abstract The {{electric}} power utilities seek {{to take advantage}} of novel approaches to meet growing energy demand. Utilities are under pressure to evolve their classical topologies to increase <b>the</b> usage <b>of</b> distributed generation. Currently the electrical power engineers in many regions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world are implementing manual methods to measure power consumption for farther assessment of voltage violation. Such process proved to be time consuming costly and inaccurate. Also demand response is a grid management technique where retail or wholesale customers are requested either electronically or manually to reduce their load. Therefore this paper aims to design and model an automated power system for optimal new load locations using DPL DIgSILENT Programming Language. This study is a diagnostic approach that assists system operator about any voltage violation cases that would happen during adding new load to the grid. <b>The</b> process <b>of</b> identifying <b>the</b> optimal <b>bus</b> <b>bar</b> location involves a complicated calculation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> power consumptions at each load bus As a result the DPL program would consider all <b>the</b> IEEE 30 <b>bus</b> internal networks data then a load flow simulation will be executed.

40|$|AbstractA {{model is}} {{developed}} for simulating <b>the</b> inhomogeneity <b>of</b> front metal fingers {{and its influence}} on <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> mass-produced crystalline silicon solar cells. First, it is shown by numerical device simulations that, in modern cell design, <b>the</b> optimal number <b>of</b> fingers will be increasingly determined by the emitter sheet resistivity {{and to a lesser}} extent by other geometries <b>of</b> <b>the</b> metallization (such as finger width, their cross-sectional area A, and <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> <b>bus</b> <b>bars).</b> An example from production shows that the relationship between finger width and <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> screen-printing paste can be inferred from the data cloud containing short-circuit current and fill factor values of fabricated cells. A logistic function is introduced to fit a broad range of cross-sectional finger shapes. With all this as input, spice simulations are preformed to elucidate <b>the</b> dynamics <b>of</b> cell efficiency in dependency of cross-sectional finger area A. The model for finger inhomogeneity is illustrated with a failure analysis. Then, it is shown that finger inhomogeneity contributes only to a small extent to the observed variations in mass production, so the metal fingers can be designed with considerably smaller A to save silver without causing a too large spread in efficiency. Finally, a desirable near-future target of A ≈ 300 μm 2 is derived from a combination of modeling and a literature collection of metallization data. It will not be necessary in future cell design to increase <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> fingers beyond about 155 (equivalent to a finger pitch of about 1 mm), regardless <b>of</b> <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> <b>bus</b> <b>bars</b> or of a multi-bus bar design. Comparing the simulations with the trend in literature data suggests that screen-printing will be the moving target in metallization for some time to come. Mainly economic pain due to high silver prices may favor a transition to (near) silver-free printing techniques...|$|R
