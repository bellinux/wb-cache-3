5|$|Like Castile soap, {{the chief}} {{ingredients}} of Nabulsi soap are virgin olive oil, water, and an alkaline sodium compound. The compound {{is made by}} mixing the powdered ashes of the barilla plant (qilw) which grows {{along the banks of}} the River Jordan with locally supplied lime (sheed). The sodium compound is then heated with water and the olive <b>oil</b> <b>in</b> <b>large</b> copper vats over fermentation pits. The solution of water and the sodium compound becomes increasingly concentrated in a series of 40 cycles repeated over eight days. During that time, an oar-shaped wooden tool known as a dukshab is used to stir the liquid soap continuously. The liquid soap is then spread in wooden frames to set. After setting, it is cut into the classic cube shape of Nabulsi soap and stamped with the company's trademark seal. The soap cubes then undergo a drying process which can last from three months to a year and involves stacking them in ceiling-high structures resembling cones with hollow centers which allow the air to circulate around the cubes.|$|E

50|$|In Spitsbergen, in {{the first}} half of the 17th Century, the {{processing}} of whales was primarily done ashore. Where the whale was flensed differed between the English and Dutch.

The {{aim was to}} find how much greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions various kinds of wood energy cause (not only CO 2, but also CH 4 and N 2 O), which energy they substitute, their potential to reduce GHG emissions, and the major sources of uncertainty. The method was life cycle assessment. Six types of wood energy were studied: fuel wood, sawdust, pellets, briquettes, demolition wood, and bark. GHG emissions over {{the life cycle of}} the wood energy types in this study are 2 – 19 % of the emissions from a comparable source of energy. The lowest figure is for demolition wood substituting <b>oil</b> <b>in</b> <b>large</b> combustion facilities, the highest for fuel wood used in dwellings to substitute electricity produced by coal-based power plants. Avoided GHG emissions per m 3 wood used for energy were from 0. 210 to 0. 640 tonne CO 2 -equivalents. Related to GWh energy produced, avoided GHG emissions were from 250 to 360 tonne CO 2 -equivalents. Avoided GHG emissions per tonne CO 2 in the wood are 0. 28 – 0. 70 tonne CO 2 -equivalents. The most important factors were technology used for combustion, which energy that is substituted, densities, and heating values.

40|$|In these {{experiments}} {{in which the}} lymph and serum ferments and antiferment have been studied separately, {{the changes that are}} found to occur are uniform and consistent. Possibly as a result of increased blood flow through the ferment-producing organs a moderate amount of protease is directly absorbed into the blood stream, but when intestinal digestion is actively under way this rapidly diminishes in extent. If any protease is absorbed during digestion from the gastrointestinal tract it is probably removed when it reaches the liver. The ereptase, or peptidase, is evidently absorbed directly from the intestinal tract and enters the circulation through the lymphatic channels. The influence of the diet on the antiferment of the lymph is striking and accounts for the fluctuations observed in previous experiments. Following the milk meal the increase occurs gradually in the lymph in an amount that, when diluted in the blood stream, would be only nominal. When the fats of the milk were replaced by olive <b>oil</b> <b>in</b> <b>large</b> amounts it is surprising to find a decrease in the antiferment instead of an increase in titer, as might be expected in view {{of the nature of the}} antiferment. This result, however, is probably due to the fact that the antiferment lipoids of the serum and lymph may exist in both water and fat dispersion phases, but are active as antiferments only when in the former. If the amount of the fats of the serum is increased, as it is after the olive oil feeding, more of the antiferment will enter the fat phase and will as a result be rendered inactive. When the feeding included the sodium oleate, the anti-ferment was in consequence increased in both the serum and the lymph, some of the soap being apparently absorbed directly into the blood stream. It is possible that the titer of the antiferment may be altered, therefore, by means of selective feeding...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} {{conducted}} & submitted in partial {{fulfillment of the}} Requirement for the Master Degree in Clinical Nutrition in the Department of Community Health Sciences at the College of Applied Medical Sciences, King Saud University, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, December 2006 GThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has undergone a remarkable and rapid economic development {{over the past two}} decades (Al-Shammari et al, 1995). The discovery of <b>oil</b> <b>in</b> <b>large</b> quantities generated sudden wealth and the average family income increased sharply. Generous and varied food supplies became available on the market, and with the high purchasing power, meal patterns became more varied. On the other hand, diseases which were previously associated with the more economically developed countries arose. Of these, overweight and obesity are the most obvious and important due to increased risk of morbidity and mortality which is known to be associated with them. Obesity accounts for over 17 million deaths every year (WHO, 2005). The dietary pattern associated with an affluent lifestyle has been blamed for the increasing prevalence of health problems associated with over nutrition. The prevalence of overweight and obesity is rising to epidemic proportions at an alarming rate in both developed “Westernized” and developing countries around the world (Millar and Stephens, 1987, Michael and Jonathan, 1988, and Seidell, 1995). Obesity will probably replace cigarette smoking as the major killer of Americans in the next century (Grundy et al, 1998). The prevalence of obesity has increased by about 10 - 50 % in the majority of European countries in the last 10 years (International Obesity Task Force, 2004). Over the same period, there is a significant increase in the number of obese and overweight people in the Saudi community. The prevalence of obesity among Saudi females found to be 44 % (Al-Nozha et al, 2005). Sociocultural studies have highlighted the role of cultural factors in the incidence of eating disorders and unhealthy weight loss behaviors in women, such as the promotion of thinness as the ideal female form in Western industrialized nations, particularly through the media (Neumark-Sztaier and French, 1996, Pirouznia, 2001). Media’s effect in presentation of the thinner body as the ideal female body shape caused a significant decrease in weight and a trend from a curved body figure to a more angular one (Garner et al, 1980). The increasing exposure to western culture has also lead to the internalization of western attitudes towards eating pattern and also about the body shapes (Nasser, 1986). Preference for the modern western thin body image was clearly observed in Saudi females, also inappropriate weight reduction practices such as fasting (24 hr), induce vomiting after eating were emerge as nearly half (46. 2 %) of them (Rasheed, 1999). For several years, the public has been bombarded with numerous weight loss advertisements and commercials. In fact, it seems that every month there is a new book advocating a novel approach to weight loss. Some of these approaches are overly simplistic and often contradict one another. Some assert dietary fat as the main culprit in obesity (Katahn, 1993). Others stress Carbohydrates as the cause (Atkins, 1992 & Dashti, 2003). All these “experts” claim that the weight reduction modalities suggested by them are based on scientific research and evidence. Thus it is no surprise that the public remains confused. Because these programs influence the consumers and play a decisive role in affecting public behavior. Therefore the present study examined the influence of different weight reduction modalities on control of obesity, and their effect on nutritional and behavioral well being of Saudi females attending different weight reduction clinics in Riyadh...|$|E
