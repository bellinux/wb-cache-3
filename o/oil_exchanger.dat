Fouling occurs on the crude side of these exchangers due to asphaltene insolubility. The nature of asphaltene solubility in crude oil was successfully modeled by Wiehe and Kennedy.

40|$|This work {{describes}} a simplified methodology to model (air-side) a heat exchanger within a {{computational fluid dynamics}} analysis of an oil cooler device for aerospace applications. Although several CFD solvers provide specific tools to simulate a heat exchanger, sometimes the available data, as for example, cooling plate geometries, dimensions and their arrangement in the heat exchanger, are not exhaustive enough {{to set up the}} numerical simulation. Hence, in the present research was used a porous media model to simulate the main effects of the heat exchanger, such as pressure drop and heat rejection, on the flowfield occurs place inside an aircraft oil cooler system. In this way, the need to model the real complex geometry of the heat exchanger is avoided. In this framework, present analyses aim at verifying that the heat exchanger, under investigation, is able to satisfy the system requirements in terms of heat rejection of the engine's oil cooling system, foreseen for the aircraft operating conditions.

The study is carried out in a leading palm oil factory in Malaysia. At present solvent extraction plant are facing problem of high hexane loss, average 9. 5 litre/metric ton (ltr/mt). To reduce the hexane loss, critical investigations were performed to improve the heat transfer between hexane vapour and water condenser shell and tube. Preliminary investigations reveal that 21 % of the hexane is being loss during plant operation. The present redesigned heat exchanger is successfully reduced the hexane loss from 9. 5 % ltr/mt to 7. 5 ltr/mt per day of the same operating plant which saves about RM 904, 800 per annum for the industry. Ultimately, the outcome of this study gives a great economic impact to the industry by reducing the production cost leading into the reduction of oil price for the nation.

The concept of the experimental facility is to measure heat transfer coefficient and pressure drop on the refrigerant side in condensation and evaporation with or without <b>oil</b> with heat <b>exchanger</b> in mind. The auto-controlled test line has 6 test sections for testing and 5 conditioning sections to preset the inlet quality of each test section.

The tertiary loop is a chiller loop running with glycol/water mixtures to cool the water and refrigerant.

40|$|The heating {{capacity}} and {{coefficient of performance}} (COP) of conventional air-source heat pumps decreases towards lower ambient temperatures. In addition, high discharge temperature at the compressor discharge might limit {{the operation of the}} heat pump at very low ambient temperatures. Oil injected into the compression chamber {{at the beginning of the}} compression process can absorb part of the heat generated during the compression process, which can result in significant reduction of the compressor discharge temperature. Discharge temperature decreases with increasing injected oil mass fraction, especially at low ambient temperatures. Therefore, oil injection allows the application of air-source heat pumps in regions with very low ambient temperatures in winter. Additionally, oil injection decreases the compressor power consumption by providing better sealing and lower friction during the compression process. Furthermore, if oil injection is combined with a regenerative heat <b>exchanger</b> and an <b>oil</b> cooler, the system performance of a vapor compression system can be improved significantly.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we look at}} the {{principles}} underlying the revamping of pre-heat trains to save energy through increased heat recovery. For brevity, we do not consider throughput changes. Only pre-heat train performance is considered. The interaction between pre-heat train and crude oil distillation column performance is considered elsewhere. The principles underlying the design of new pre-heat trains are also considered elsewhere. That study shows that that pre-heat trains differ from general heat recovery networks in four important respects: (i) The heat demand is dominated by a single 'cold' stream; (ii) Rather than having a distinct 'pinch point', the composite curves are often close over quite a large region; (iii) The heat demand can be broken up into two or three distinct processing regions and the temperatures of these divisions are fixed and more significant than the 'pinch point' itself; (iv) The rate of fouling encountered in pre-heat train exchangers is dependent upon crude <b>oil</b> velocity and <b>exchanger</b> wall temperature. This means that the 'pinch technology principle' of matching the hottest hot stream with the cold stream at its hottest point, first proposed by Ponton & Donaldson, does not necessarily apply with pre-heat trains. When it comes to revamping projects, pre-heat trains differ from general problems in other important aspects. The first is that pressure drop considerations are very important. The pumps used to drive the crude through the train are very expensive. The designer will therefore seek to achieve the targets without pump replacement. Pressure drop is very strongly affected by fouling and allowance will have been made for this in the pump specification. There is, as shown below, a need to consider the hydraulic effects of fouling during retrofit projects. Finally, exchanger technologies which mitigate fouling are becoming established and should be considered during revamp design...|$|R
40|$|In vapor {{compression}} {{cycles of}} {{air conditioning and}} refrigeration systems, {{a small amount of}} the compressor lubricating oil is carried with the refrigerant and it circulates in the system components. In the heat <b>exchangers,</b> <b>oil</b> is a contaminant and it decreases the heat transfer rate and increases the pressure losses: both are unavoidable challenges. Nanolubricants, that is, nanoparticles dispersed in the non-volatile component of a refrigerant and oil mixture and working as thermal energy transport vectors within the mixture, have the potential to overcome these challenges in a cost-neutral manner for both new and retrofitting applications. This papers documents the effects of the nanoparticles thermal conductivity and aspect ratio on the two-phase flow heat transfer coefficients and pressure drop of nanolubricants by experimentally studying two types of nanolubricants. The first type used spherical Alumina (Î³-Al 2 O 3) nanoparticles with 40 nm nominal particle diameter. The second type used ZnO nanoparticles with 20 to 40 nm nominal particle diameter and with an elongated hexagonal wurtzite shape. The experimental results indicated that the thermal conductivity of the nanolubricants increased linearly with the added amount of nanoparticles in POE oil, and Î³-Al 2 O 3 and ZnO based nanolubricants had similar thermal conductivity if the nanoparticle concentration was 10 wt. % and 20 wt. %. However, even when diluted in the liquid phase of the refrigerant R 410 A and POE oil mixture, these two types of nanoparticles provided heat transfer performance that were measurably different from each other during two phase flow boiling inside an horizontal 9. 5 mm micro-fin evaporator tube. Depending on the mass flux, oil concentration, and heat flux, nanolubricants provided either an enhancement or a degradation of the heat transfer coefficients. These results supported the hypothesis that thermal conductivity of the nanolubricants was not the main property responsible for the heat transfer coefficient intensification during flow boiling. The experimental results also suggested that the magnitude of the enhancements of the two phase flow boiling heat transfer coefficient due to the nanoparticles dispersed in the POE oil were depended on the mass flux and shear rates within the liquid phase of the mixture. Interesting, even when high heat transfer coefficients were observed for the nanolubricants, the effect of the nanoparticles on the two phase flow pressure drop of the mixture was negligible. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Three {{companies}} namely Esko & Co Ltd, Cuttings Work Ltd and The Message Ltd {{were targeted}} {{for the purpose}} of this project study. The first one is Esko & Co Ltd. The company has diversified its production activities to produce sweets, bubble gums, chocolates, wafers and noodles both for the local market and export purposes. Cuttings Works Ltd is the second leading company in the manufacturing of top grade products using the best possible gemstones for the jewellery grade. The company is also diversifying and expanding its market. On the other hand ‘The message Ltd’ is another company involved in the designing and make up of high class casual wear. Previously the company was only designing and preparing samples and the bulk order done in another textile factory. With respect to the highly demanding market, they have now started the production of their shirts in-house. Being exposed to competition threats from other local and overseas suppliers, it is imperative for these factories to investigate on cost saving possibilities and process improvement opportunities. A walk-through audit was carried out where data were collected. The objective of the audit was to obtain energy savings through low cost improvements that optimise the building systems and process operation so that the companies operate efficiently and effectively. On the basis of observations and calculations, the following cost savings options can be suggested:’ 1.        Savings on Fuel (HFO) used at Esko & Co Ltd. A saving on fuel consumed of MUR 458 572 [PH 1] (Euro 11 464 based on exchange rate of Euro 1 = MUR 40) per year can be achieved by recovering the heat loss through the flash steam for pre-heating the feed-water to the boiler. Another saving on fuel of MUR 105 578 (Euro 2639) per year can be done by recovering the heat loss from the Wafers machine exhaust. Also by recovering the heat loss from the boiler chimney exhaust a saving of MUR 137 457 (Euro 3436) per year can be achieved. 2.        Savings on Electrical components. It was found that in a big manufacturing company like Esko & Co Ltd, a direct saving of MUR 13 278 (Euro 332) per year can easily be achieved by substituting the existing Fluorescent tube lights (18 W) by 9 W-T 8 lamp with a return on investment of 2. 8 years. However in smaller scale enterprise like The Message ltd and Cuttings Ltd, the shift on economic lamp can also lead to savings of MUR 3700 (Euro 92. 5) and MUR 1386 (Euro 34. 7) yearly. Most often large scale enterprise was found to be always paying a penalty fee for power factor. Hence the investment on an Automatic Correction Unit will also help doing savings. For instance, Esko & Co Ltd can save MUR 3200 (Euro 80) monthly on its electricity bill with a payback of 3. 1 years for the power corrector unit. Next we noticed that big companies are used to a penalty fee for power factor. As this fee is for a period of six months for every month of excess power consumed, it is worth investing on an Automatic Power Correction unit. As such foe Esko & Co Ltd we found that a saving of MUR 3200 Euro 80) per month will be made with a payback period of 3. 1 years for the equipment. Furthermore it was found that the power consumed by air conditioning units is quite significant. For instance for Esko & Co Ltd 33 % of the total power consumed are by the air conditioning units. A direct saving in this respect is achievable by only increasing the set point temperature by 1 to 2 oC. Other simple measures can be shading of windows to prevent sunlight or using wind curtains at doors and to switch on the AC when needed can largely help to decrease the air conditioning load However there is also room for future investment in variable speed drive for the compressors of the air conditioning units which is still costly at present. 3.        Steam leakage optimisation Reduction of steam leakage can be done by replacing the return condensate line from the <b>oil</b> heat <b>exchanger</b> at Esko& Co Ltd by a smaller one. It was not possible to calculate the savings as the leaks could not be measured – however results will show in the fuel bills. 4.        Reduction of heat dissipated Insulating the exhaust pipes from the Wafer machine at Esko& Co Ltd by using mineral wool of thickness 57 mm will considerably decrease the heat dissipated to the surrounding by 80 % and hence improving the working environment around the machine since no air conditioner is found in that room. Air conditioning load in other rooms are expected to reduce and once again here it is difficult to conduct any calculations on how much can be saved. But by taking this measure the effects are immediately seen. 5.        Transport Fuel optimisation Normally big companies like Esko& Co Ltd which has many lorries for their product delivery that consume around 2330 litres of diesel monthly. As the transportation fuel is continuously increasing, this area also requires monitoring and optimisation. Simple measures like smooth driving, regular tuning and servicing of your engine can help improving the fuel economy of the company. 6.        Use of solar energy To alleviate the increasing world oil prices, the use of renewable energies are becoming important. As such we found that in a country like Mauritius where there is great potential for solar energy, the latter can be an option for companies to invest on. It was found that a grid connected system will be more advantageous and depending on an agreement with the local grid, a payback of less than 5 years can be achieved for a tariff around MUR 3 (Euro 0. 08) per kWh. 7.        Avoided carbon dioxide emissions. To decrease the impact of global warming, it is important to cut down the emissions of greenhouse gases as it will be a serious threat to the third world countries and small island states in the first place as they are the most vulnerable. With the savings in the amount of HFO burned at Esko& Co Ltd, we found that the avoided amount of GHG emissions amounts to 98. 96 kg CO 2 -e/year...|$|R
