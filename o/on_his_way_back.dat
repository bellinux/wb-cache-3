5|$|In Shahîd's reconstruction, {{this event}} {{took place at}} Antioch on 13 April 244, while the emperor was <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> to Rome from the Persian front. The 12th-century Byzantine {{historian}} Zonaras repeats the story.|$|E
5|$|After the Internationals broke up, Costello {{returned}} to Australia to visit {{friends and relatives}} and to recuperate after many years on the road. <b>On</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> to the United States, Costello had a stop over in Detroit, Michigan, where he met Cleo Williams. The two fell in love and married shortly afterwards, remaining together {{for the rest of}} Costello’s life.|$|E
5|$|At {{this point}} Kantakouzenos {{received}} grave news from Constantinople. In late August Apokaukos attempted a coup {{and tried to}} kidnap John V. Having failed, he fled to his fortified house at Epibatai, where he was blockaded by troops. Kantakouzenos returned to Constantinople in early September, where he stayed {{for a few weeks}} consulting with the Empress. <b>On</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> to Thrace to prepare for a campaign into the Morea, he went to Epibatai, where he pardoned Apokaukos and restored him to his former offices.|$|E
6000|$|Stevenson {{had been}} sharply ailing as usual at Sydney, {{and was now}} <b>on</b> [...] <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>back.</b> Having {{received}} proofs {{of some of his}} South Sea [...] chapters, he had begun to realise that they were not what he had [...] hoped to make them.|$|R
60|$|It {{was with}} a feeling of joy, of {{distinct}} relief that we set our faces toward the sunset. Every mile brought us nearer home. I knew the West. I knew the people, and I had no fear of making a living beyond the Alleghanies. Every mile added courage and hope to our hearts, and increased the value of the splendid, if sometimes severe experiences through which we had passed. Frank was especially gay for he was definitely <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> home, <b>back</b> to Dakota.|$|R

"Now, granny," [...] remarked young Slidder, as he untied the parcel, {{and spread}} its {{contents}} {{on the small}} deal table, [...] "I've got a wague suspicion that the 'ouse w'ich 'as gone to hashes is the wery 'ouse in w'ich Dr Mellon put his little dog last night. 'Cause why? Ain't it the same identical street, an' the same side o' the street, and about the same part o' the street? An' didn't both him and me forgit to ask the name o' the people o' the 'ouse, or {{to look at the}} number--so took up was we with partin' from Punch?

Then, didn't that six-footer say a terrier dog was reskooed from the lower premises? To be sure there's many a terrier dog in London, but then didn't he likewise say that the gov'ness o' the family is a pretty gal? Wot more likely than that she's my young lady? All that, you see, granny, is what the magistrates would call presumptuous evidence. But I'll go and inquire for myself this wery evenin' w'en you're all settled an comf'rable, an' w'en I've got Mrs Jones to look arter you." ...|$|R
5|$|Barnes {{married a}} schoolteacher, Alison Margaret Edward on 11 June 1942. Alison was the {{daughter}} of Kenneth Edward, a Scottish Professor of Theology at the University of Sydney. The couple met at a country dance, when Barnes, <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> from an exhibition match in Katoomba, was bet the price of the meal that he could not get the young girl to dance with him. Within twelve months the pair were married.|$|E
5|$|In Cairo {{he became}} a wealthy courtier, but he was {{involved}} in plots and conspiracies there as well. The young az-Zafir became caliph in 1149, and Ibn as-Sallar became vizier, with Usama as one of his advisors. As-Sallar sent Usama to negotiate an alliance against the crusaders with Zengi's son Nur ad-Din, but the negotiations failed. Usama took part in battles with the crusaders outside of Ascalon <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> to Egypt, and after he left, his brother 'Ali was killed at Gaza.|$|E
5|$|In his memoirs, Diefenbaker did {{not mention}} the elder Atherton's initial {{approach}} but wrote that he was in Australia at a parliamentary conference {{at the time of the}} Canoe River crash. An Australian lawyer pointed out the case to Diefenbaker; he thought it interesting but noted that he was not a member of the Law Society of British Columbia. Diefenbaker wrote that he planned to meet Edna in Hawaii <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> from Australia. Instead she wired him, requesting that he meet her in Vancouver.|$|E
5000|$|Béraud {{became a}} student of Léon Bonnat, and {{exhibited}} his paintings at the Salon {{for the first time}} in 1872. However, he did not gain recognition until 1876, with <b>his</b> <b>On</b> the <b>Way</b> <b>Back</b> from the Funeral. He exhibited with the Society of French Watercolorists at the 1889 World's Fair in Paris.|$|R
50|$|In {{the main}} event, Randy Orton {{retained}} his WWE Championship against Wade Barrett {{in a free}} or fired Pinfall-and-submissions-only singles match with John Cena as a special referee. Cena pushed Barrett into a RKO, {{and because of the}} stipulations of the match, John Cena was fired. Cena thanked Michael Cole and the fans <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> to the <b>back</b> to close the show.|$|R
50|$|And who was it? The little bear cub who'd {{got lost}} from his family.The kids all marvel at how cute and tiny he is, but their mother warns that bears can bite {{and will have}} a mother and father nearby. In another homage to MGM's classic 1939 musical, Mary quips that she hopes it's {{somebody}} they know (referencing both the dual roles performed {{by the rest of}} the cast as well as setting up the intended second episode featuring Frank and Nancy Sinatra which was never filmed). And so Bing, Kathryn, Mary Frances and Nathaniel send the little bear cub <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> - <b>back</b> to <b>his</b> family.|$|R
5|$|The {{army of the}} Fourth Crusade conquered Constantinople on 12 April 1204. One of {{the main}} leaders of the crusade, Boniface of Montferrat, having lost the {{opportunity}} to become Emperor, went on to found the Kingdom of Thessalonica. That autumn, William of Champlitte followed him to Thessalonica but then continued south until he reached the Morea (Peloponnese). There he was joined by Geoffrey I of Villehardouin, who had sailed to Modon (Methoni) <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> from Palestine.|$|E
5|$|A {{recovered}} Herkus Monte raided Culmerland {{with a large}} {{force and}} took many prisoners in 1263. <b>On</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> to Natangia, Herkus and his men were confronted by a contingent of their enemies. In the Battle of Löbau that ensued, Prussians killed forty knights, including the Master and the Marshal. The Prussians also received help from Lithuanians and Sudovians. In summer of 1262 Treniota and Shvarn attacked Masovia, killing Duke Siemowit I, and raided Culmerland, provoking Pogesanians to join the uprising. However, assassination of Mindaugas and subsequent dynastic fights prevented Lithuanians from further campaigns. Skalmantas, leader of Sudovians, raided Culm (Chełmno) in 1263 and in 1265.|$|E
5|$|Although Ibn Haukal {{reports the}} sack of Samandar by Sviatoslav, the Rus' leader {{did not bother}} to occupy the Khazar heartlands north of the Caucasus Mountains permanently. <b>On</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> to Kiev, Sviatoslav chose to strike against the Ossetians and force them into subservience. Therefore, Khazar {{successor}} statelets continued their precarious existence in the region. The destruction of Khazar imperial power paved the way for Kievan Rus' to dominate north-south trade routes through the steppe and across the Black Sea, routes that formerly had been a major source of revenue for the Khazars. Moreover, Sviatoslav's campaigns led to increased Slavic settlement in the region of the Saltovo-Mayaki culture, greatly changing the demographics and culture of the transitional area between the forest and the steppe.|$|E
50|$|The {{last chance}} for the {{opposition}} to win back time on Anquetil was in the seventeenth stage, but Anquetil stayed close to his direct competitors, and only allowed lower classified riders to escape. The press criticized Anquetil's tactics, saying he was riding passively. In the nineteenth stage, an individual time trial, Gaul was <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> to win <b>back</b> a little time on Anquetil, when he crashed heavily, and could not find his pace again. Anquetil won almost three minutes on Gaul and extended his lead to more than ten minutes.|$|R
50|$|In 1845, Bakikhanov {{went on a}} hajj. <b>On</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> to {{the holy}} Islamic sights, he was warmly {{received}} by the Shah of Persia and was awarded the Shir-e Khorshid, the highest ranking Persian medal. There he also visited Isfahan, Yazd, Shiraz, and Kermanshah. In Constantinople, Bakikhanov had an audience with the Sultan, who showed interest {{in some of his}} academic writings, particularly in Asrar al-Malakut, of which he was presented a copy. From there, Bakikhanov went to visit Mecca and Medina. <b>On</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> from Medina <b>back</b> to Damascus he caught cholera and died {{in the small town of}} Wadi Fatima in Hejaz (present-day Saudi Arabia) in 1847.|$|R
50|$|Like {{many other}} water bodies and {{physical}} features of Kathmandu, the Nagdaha is also steeped in legends. According to one, a male serpent resides in Taudaha and the resident serpent of Nagdaha is female. During {{the rainy season}} the male serpent, widely spoken of in ancient scriptures and oral history of Kathmandu as a serpent king, makes a journey {{to the town of}} Panauti in order to participate in a festival. It is said that he stays with the female serpent of Nagdaha <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> to and <b>back</b> from Panauti. This union of the nagas, mythical half serpent, half human beings, is followed by heavy rain.|$|R
5|$|Ayyubid rule {{virtually}} {{ended in}} 1260, after the Mongols under Hulagu Khan completely destroyed Gaza—Hulagu's southernmost point of conquest. Hulagu left his army in Gaza after being recalled {{due to the}} death of the Mongol emperor, and Mamluk general az-Zahir Baybars subsequently drove the Mongols out of the city and again defeated them at Baysan in the Galilee. He was proclaimed sultan of Egypt <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> from the battlefield after the assassination of Sultan Qutuz. Baibars passed through Gaza six times during his expeditions against the remnants of the Crusader states and the Mongols between 1263 and 1269. Mamluk domination started in 1277, with Gaza initially being a small village in the territory of Ramla. In 1279, Sultan al-Mansur Qalawun encamped in Gaza for fifty days while on a march against the Mongols.|$|E
5|$|Encouraged by {{the success}} he had {{achieved}} in Romania in 1940 {{with the help of}} his son-in-law, Berger had proposed to Himmler that the next recruiting sphere be the Volksdeutsche communities of Romania, Hungary and Yugoslavia, which together contained about 1.5 million ethnic Germans. Little could be done to further this proposal until mid-1941, by which time Yugoslavia had been overrun by the Axis, and Romania and Hungary had joined the pact. Immediately after the lightning-quick defeat of Yugoslavia in April 1941, Hausser was being pressed to accept Yugoslav Volksdeutsche into his renamed SS-Division-Reich, even before it was withdrawn to prepare for Operation Barbarossa. <b>On</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> to Germany from Yugoslavia, Hausser had transited through Romania and gathered another 600 ethnic German volunteers who he smuggled out of the country.|$|E
5|$|Following the Yellowstone {{fires of}} 1988, Henry (Rich Sommer) takes {{a job in}} 1989 as a Shoshone National Forest fire lookout, after his wife Julia (Larissa Gallagher) {{develops}} early-onset dementia. On the first day, his supervisor Delilah (Cissy Jones) contacts him via walkie-talkie and asks that he investigate illegal fireworks at a nearby lake. There he detects teenage girls skinny dipping, who accuse him of leering. <b>On</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>back,</b> he finds a locked gate in a cave and spots a shrouded figure. Henry discovers his watchtower ransacked at arrival. The next day, Delilah sends him to a downed communication line. It is found cut, along with {{a message from the}} girls. He and Delilah plot to scare them off, but Henry finds their campsite abandoned.|$|E
50|$|It {{is today}} often visited by people {{travelling}} from Sweden to Germany {{because of the}} ferries to Rostock, Sassnitz, and Lübeck - Travemünde in Germany. These ferries began sailing on May 1, 1897, with the Sassnitz line; the route to Travemünde was established in 1962, while the line to the former East German city Rostock was inaugurated {{after the fall of}} the Berlin Wall in 1989. The ferries carry both passengers on one-day journeys, cars with vacationing families, and heavy trucks on their way through Europe. In April 1917, Lenin arrived with the ferry from Sassnitz to Trelleborg <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> from exile <b>back</b> to Russia to lead the Revolution.|$|R
5000|$|In September 2014 Fairford {{was used}} as the staging base for US President Obama's trip to the NATO conference held in Newport, Wales. VC-25A [...] "Air Force 1" [...] (AF1) {{aircraft}} carrying the President and his entourage and support aircraft arrived on 3 September, the US Secretary of State John Kerry also arrived in his own USAF C-32 aircraft. Air Force One with President Obama departed for Washington 5 September after an 'impromptu' visit to Stonehenge <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> from Newport <b>back</b> to RAF Fairford. Support aircraft temporarily based at Fairford for the visit included VC-22s, VH-60s other support aircraft, a significant number of C-17 cargo aircraft delivered equipment and vehicles.|$|R
50|$|Ana meets Nacho Najera, a rich boy who is {{dedicated}} to car racing, and they become friends. Although Nacho is committed to Magdalena, a frivolous and interested girl who loves Nacho's fortune more than him, he falls {{madly in love with}} Ana. Nacho is going away for a race in Indianapolis, and when he is going back to Mexico to end his relationship with Magdalena, he learns that she is expecting a child of <b>his.</b> <b>On</b> their <b>way</b> <b>back</b> to Mexico, Nacho and his father, Gustavo, are in an airplane crash. After Nacho's death, Magdalena causes an abortion that leaves her sterile.|$|R
5|$|Hasekura {{stayed for}} 5 months in Mexico <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> to Japan. The San Juan Bautista {{was waiting in}} Acapulco since 1616, after a second trip across the Pacific from Japan to Mexico. Captained by Yokozawa Shōgen, she was laden with fine pepper and lacquerware from Kyoto, which were sold on the Mexican market. Following a request by the Spanish king, {{in order to avoid}} too much silver leaving to Japan, the Viceroy asked for the {{proceeds}} to be spent on Mexican goods, except for an amount of 12,000 pesos and 8,000 pesos in silver which Hasekura and Yokozawa could bring back with them respectively.|$|E
5|$|Innocent consecrated Stephen Langton as {{archbishop}} against John's wishes, {{triggering a}} long {{dispute between the}} papacy and the King. The pope imposed various sanctions on England and John; at one point de Gray {{was one of only}} two bishops still legitimately holding office in England. In 1209 he became governor of Ireland for John, and spent until 1213 attempting to impose royal government on the Anglo-Norman barons and the native Irish in that country. Recalled to England to help defend against a threatened invasion by the French, de Gray then travelled to Rome to secure a papal pardon after the final settlement of John and Innocent's dispute over the bishop's abortive elevation to Canterbury. After securing his pardon de Gray was appointed Bishop of Durham, but he died <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> to England.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Salih and the Tayy fended off Fatimid {{troops in}} Palestine. <b>On</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> to Aleppo, Salih {{captured}} {{a string of}} towns and fortresses, namely Ba'albak west of Damascus, Hims and Rafaniyya in central Syria, Sidon on the Mediterranean coast and Hisn Ibn Akkar in the hinterland of Tripoli. These strategically valuable towns gave Salih's emirate an outlet to the sea and control of part of the caravan route between Aleppo and Damascus. The fall of Sidon particularly alarmed the Fatimids, who largely prioritized control of Syria's port cities over the inland towns and who feared that other ports would recognize Bedouin rule.|$|E
6000|$|Anne {{waited on}} the lower floor of the cottage while Geoffrey closed and locked the gate. She {{had no wish to}} appear to avoid him, after the answer that he had sent to his mother's message. He {{returned}} slowly half-way across the front garden, looked toward the passage in which she was standing, passed before the door, and disappeared round the corner of the cottage <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> to the <b>back</b> garden. The inference was not to be mistaken. It was Geoffrey who was avoiding her. Had he lied to Sir Patrick? When the next day came would he find reasons of his own for refusing to take her to Holchester House? ...|$|R
50|$|Two {{years of}} {{extremely}} hard work took a toll <b>on</b> <b>his</b> health. He succumbed to a terminal disease in 1945 {{and died in}} a taxi boat in Rugao <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> from Jiangyan <b>back</b> to Nantong, a few month before the Sino-Japanese war would end. The following year, 24 local VIPs issued a proclamation {{and set up a}} memorial committee in his honor. They referred to him as a “giant man of letters and a renowned master of education”, and they called upon the government to 1. Recognize and honor his professional services and patriotic deeds; 2. Restore Nantong Poor Children’s Home and rename it after him; 3. Protect his grave and build a memorial; and 4. Financially help his widow to raise his children. They launched a fund-raising campaign to help promote these measures.|$|R
50|$|As {{described}} in a film magazine, Nugget Nell (Gish) is the proprietress of a stage depot in the early west. to her hostelry comes the wealthy and well groomed City Chap (Cannon), who ignores her love prompted advances. She robs the ladies of the area of their fine clothes and adorns herself for his delectation, but with no results. When he leaves, she learns that the Wolf Gang is planning {{to hold up the}} stage and rob him. She in turn robs the gang and frees the City Chap. They are run to cover in a deserted hut where she successfully fights off their pursuers. However, she has learned that City Chap is a coward, so she sends him <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> and goes <b>back</b> to Big Hearted Jim (Butler), her faithful admirer.|$|R
5|$|The {{sighting}} by Jane Tanner, {{one of the}} Tapas Seven, of a man {{carrying a}} child that night became {{an important part of}} the early investigation. She had left the restaurant just after 21:00 to check on her own daughter, passing Madeleine's father on Rua Dr Francisco Gentil Martins <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> to the restaurant from his 21:05 check. He had stopped to chat to a British holidaymaker, but neither man recalled having seen Tanner. This puzzled the Portuguese police, given how narrow the street was, and led them to accuse Tanner of having invented the sighting.|$|E
5|$|There are {{indications}} that Robert may have been briefly betrothed to a daughter of King Cnut, but no marriage took place. It is unclear if William would have been supplanted in the ducal succession if Robert had had a legitimate son. Earlier dukes had been illegitimate, and William's association with his father on ducal charters appears to indicate that William was considered Robert's most likely heir. In 1034 Duke Robert decided to go on pilgrimage to Jerusalem. Although some of his supporters tried to dissuade him from undertaking the journey, Robert convened a council in January 1035 and had the assembled Norman magnates swear fealty to William as his heir before leaving for Jerusalem. He died in early July at Nicea, <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> to Normandy.|$|E
5|$|Żółkiewski {{attended}} a cathedral school in Lwów (now L'viv, Ukraine). Unlike {{many of his}} peers he had no higher education and did not travel abroad. However, he pursued studies {{on his own and}} was particularly interested in history and historical literature. In 1566 he joined the court of King Sigismund II Augustus, as an aid to the king's secretary Jan Zamoyski. There he became familiar with the executionist movement, which advocated numerous reforms including military ones. In 1573 he took part in the diplomatic mission to France, sent to meet a newly elected king Henry III of France, and <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> he was sent to Vienna to appease the Habsburgs.|$|E
50|$|After his escape, Conyngham fled to Texel Island in the Netherlands {{to try to}} find a <b>way</b> <b>back</b> to America {{where he}} could {{potentially}} receive a new ship. His spirits were high - he reported later that he was amused by the portrayals of himself as a monster that he saw displayed all over London while in disguise. He planned <b>on</b> making <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> to France where he could again enlist the help of his friend Benjamin Franklin, but instead met with a stroke of luck. While he was resting in Texel, John Paul Jones arrived in port after his battle with the Serapis. Jones took him aboard, and they cruised together for several months until Conyngham left the Alliance at a Spanish port in order to board a ship headed for American shores. However, it was here that Conyngham’s luck ran out once again. While aboard the Experiment en route to America, he was recaptured by the British on 17 March 1780, and sent back to Mill Prison in Plymouth. He remained there until his release due to a political prisoner exchange. This time, he headed for Ostend, where he obtained the armed vessel Layona, which he prepared to go cruising in once again. However, he received news of a treaty, and instead boarded the Hannibal, which was <b>on</b> its <b>way</b> <b>back</b> to <b>his</b> hometown of Philadelphia.|$|R
5000|$|Born of Kittitian and Jamaican descent, Burton {{began his}} footballing {{career as a}} trainee at Bolton Wanderers, before {{switching}} to Crystal Palace in 1994. He went <b>on</b> to make <b>his</b> début in the Premier League match at Derby County on 20 December 1997. He played the full ninety minutes, in what was a goalless draw at Pride Park. Following Palace's relegation, he played 23 of the club's 46 First Division matches in the following season. Despite this, he was still allowed to drop down a division to join Colchester United for a nominal fee in May 1999. After making just twelve appearances in league and cup, six months later he was <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> to <b>back</b> into the First Division after signing for Sheffield United on a free transfer. This spell {{would prove to be}} even briefer, and in January 2000 he joined Brian Horton's Port Vale, also of the First Division, again on a free transfer. He made 22 appearances for the Staffordshire club in 1999-2000, and found himself on the scoresheet in home draws with Charlton Athletic and Barnsley. He established himself as [...] "a powerful presence" [...] and [...] "impressive in the air". Despite this, Vale were relegated {{at the end of the}} season.|$|R
50|$|During {{his absence}} from the tower, Happer the miller and his {{daughter}} Mysie arrived on a visit, and soon afterwards came Sir Piercie Shafton, as a refugee from the English Court. The next day the abbot came to dine with them, and offered Halbert, who had quarrelled with the knight for his attentions to Mary, the office of ranger of the Church forests. He, however, refused it, and startled his rival with a token he had obtained from the mysterious spectre. The following morning they fought in a glen, and Halbert fled to the Baron of Avenel, leaving Sir Piercie apparently mortally wounded. His companion thither was Henry Warden, who offended the laird, and assisted Halbert in his determination {{to escape from the}} castle, rather than serve under his host's standard. The knight, however, had miraculously recovered, and <b>on</b> making <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> to the tower, was accused by Edward of having murdered his missing brother, in spite of his assurance that the youth was alive and uninjured. With the sub-prior's approval he was treated as a prisoner; but during the night Mysie assisted him to escape, and accompanied him northwards, dressed as his page. Mary Avenel, meanwhile, in the midst of her grief at the supposed death of her lover, was visited by the White Lady, who comforted her by disclosing the place where he had hidden the Bible, which she had secretly read with her mother.|$|R
