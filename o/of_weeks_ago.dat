500|$|... "Tallahassee" [...] {{received}} largely positive {{reviews from}} critics, with many {{noting that the}} Florida story-line gave the series a focus. TV Equals noted that the episode was [...] "one of the best episodes of The Office this the season and [...] {{one of the better}} episodes from the last couple of seasons." [...] Brian Marder from Hollywood.com wrote a largely positive review, noting that [...] "Overall, tonight represented a significant step back in the right direction – and hope that maybe the series still has hope... More promisingly, the humor was top-notch, funnily similar to the effortless comedy of early seasons and refreshingly dissimilar to the forced, uncharacteristic stuff that has pervaded season 8." [...] Bret Davinger from the California Literary Review noted that [...] "A couple <b>of</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>ago,</b> I complained about The Office spending too much time away from the office. How was I to know that taking a trip to Tallahassee would produce probably the best episode of the season and maybe one of the best episodes of the past couple of seasons?" [...] Davinger went on to note that the change in scenery from the office set to Tallahassee was working for the series. In addition, he noted that episode did not feature any hints of Erin's desire to stay in Florida or Cathy's attempt to seduce Jim, a move he hoped would be permanent. [...] Jeffrey Hyatt from Screencrave awarded the episode an 8 out of 10 and wrote that [...] "between 'Special Project' and 'Tallahassee' it’s fair to say that The Office is on a nice little run. Everything good and funny about last week's episode spilled over to 'Tallahassee'." [...] TV Fanatic reviewer Dan Forcella awarded the episode four out of five stars. Despite praising the episode for coming [...] "together {{as one of the best}} Office episodes of the season," [...] he criticized Dwight's main plot, calling it [...] "not funny." [...] The Filtered Lens reviewer Matt Dougherty called the episode [...] "solid" [...] and noted [...] "While 'Tallahassee' was not quite as good as last week, it still is a step in the right direction for this struggling show." [...] He ultimately awarded the episode a 7 out of 10. Many reviews praised the episode's cold opening, with many critics calling it one of the funniest openings of the eighth season. What Culture! reviewer Jeffrey Kratzer, despite awarding the episode three out of five stars, wrote, Tallahassee' was so enjoyable (for the most part) that [...] next few episodes look to be the excitement and focused momentum we've been waiting for all season." ...|$|E

60|$|Here, in the evening, {{amid the}} {{manifold}} smells of the day, the family goes to its virtuous couch. That is to say, {{as many as}} possible pile into the one bed (if bed they have), and the surplus turns in on the floor. And this is the round of their existence, month after month, year after year, for they never get a vacation save when they are evicted. When a child dies, and some are always bound to die, since fifty-five per cent. of the East End children die before they are five years old, the body is laid out in the same room. And if they are very poor, it is kept for some time until they can bury it. During the day it lies on the bed; during the night, when the living take the bed, the dead occupies the table, from which, in the morning, when the dead is put back into the bed, they eat their breakfast. Sometimes the body is placed on the shelf which serves as a pantry for their food.

6000|$|DEAR HOWELLS,--Your letter came yesterday. It then {{occurred}} to me that I might have known (per mental telegraph) that it was due; for a couple <b>of</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>ago</b> when the Weekly came containing that handsome reference to me I was powerfully moved to write you; and my letter went on writing itself while I was at work at my other literature during the day. But next day my other literature was still urgent--and so on and so on; so my letter didn't get put into ink at all. But I see now, that you were writing, about that time, therefore a part of my stir could have come across the Atlantic per mental telegraph. In 1876 or '75 I wrote 40,000 words of a story called [...] "Simon Wheeler" [...] wherein the nub was the preventing of an execution through testimony furnished by mental telegraph {{from the other side of}} the globe. I had a lot of people scattered about the globe who carried in their pockets something like the old mesmerizer-button, made of different metals, and when they wanted to call up each other and have a talk, they [...] "pressed the button" [...] or did something, I don't remember what, and communication was at once opened. I didn't finish the story, though I re-began it in several new ways, and spent altogether 70,000 words on it, then gave it up and threw it aside.|$|E

6000|$|You {{shall have}} a letter this morning, {{whatever}} happens! I am {{waiting for the}} train to Carcassonne, and you will perhaps ask yourself why you are thus sandwiched between these two mouldy antiquities. It is precisely because they are mouldy that I invoke your genial presence. Toulouse is dreary and not interesting, and I am afraid that Carcassonne will answer to the same description I heard given a couple <b>of</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>ago</b> by an English lady in Touraine, of the charming Château d'Amboise: [...] "rather curious, you know, but very, very dirty." [...] Therefore my spirit turns for comfort to what I have known best in life. I got your last excellent letter an abominable number of weeks ago; and I hereby propose, {{as a rule of}} our future correspondence, that I be graciously absolved from ever specifying the time that has elapsed since the arrival of the letter I am supposed to be answering. This custom will ease me off immensely. Your last, however, is not so remote but that the scolding you gave me for sending your previous letter to Mrs. Kemble is fearfully fresh in my mind. My dear Grace, I regret extremely having irritated you; but I would fain wrestle with you on this subject. I think you have a false code about the showing of letters--and in calling it a breach of confidence you surely confound the limits of things. Of course there is always a particular discretion for the particular case; but what are letters but talk, and what is the showing them but the repetition of talk? The same rules that govern that of course govern the other; but I don't see why they should be more stringent. It is indeed, I think, of the very essence of a good letter to be shown--it is wasted if it is kept for one. Was not Mme. de Sévigné's last always handed about to a hundred people--was not Horace Walpole's? What was right for them is, it seems to me, right for you. However, I make this little protest simply for the theory's sake, and promise you solemnly that in practice, in future, you shall be my own exclusive and peculiar Sévigné! Yet I don't at all insist on being your exclusive Walpole! I have indeed the sweet security of the conviction that you will never [...] "want," [...] as they say (you don't) in Cambridge, to exhibit my epistles. Only I give you full leave to read them aloud at your soirées! Have your soirées recommenced by the way? Where are you, my dear Grace, and how are you? The question about your whereabouts will perhaps make you smile, if anything in this letter can, as I make no doubt you are enjoying the gorgeous charm (I speak without irony) of a Cambridge October. For myself, as you see, I am [...] "doing" [...] the south of France--for literary purposes, into which I won't pretend to enter, as they are not of a very elevated character. (I am trying to write some articles about these regions for an American [...] "illustrated"--Harper--but I don't foresee, as yet, any very brilliant results.) I left England some five weeks ago, and after a few days in Paris came down into Touraine--for the sake of the châteaux of the Loire. At the hotel at Tours, where I spent 12 days, I had the advantage of the society of Mrs. Kemble, and her daughter Mrs. Wister, with the son of the latter. We made some excursions together--that is, minus Mrs. K. (a large void,) who was too infirm to junket about, and then the ladies returned to Paris and I took my way further afield. Touraine is charming, Chenonceaux, Chambord, Blois, etc., very interesting, and that episode was on the whole a success--enlivened too by my exciting company. But the rest of France (that is those parts I have been through) [is] rather disappointing, though I suppose when I recite my itinerary you will feel that I ought to have found a world of picturesqueness--I mean at Bourges, Le Mans, Angers, Nantes, La Rochelle, Poitiers, etc. The cathedral of Bourges is worth a long pilgrimage to see; but for the rest France has preserved the physiognomy of the past much less than England and than Italy. Besides, when I come into the south, I don't console myself for not being in the latter country. I don't care for these people, and in fine I rather hate it. I return to Paris on November 1st, and spend a month there. Then I return to England for the winter. When I am in that country I {{want to get out of}} it, and when I am out of it I languish for its heavy air. England is just now in a rather [...] "cocky" [...] mood, and disposed to carry it high with her little Egyptian victories. It is such a satisfaction to me to see her again counting for something in Europe that I would give her carte blanche to go as far as she chooses--or dares; but at the same time I hope she won't exhibit a vulgar greed. It has a really dramatic interest for me to see how the great Gladstone will acquit himself of a situation in which all his high principles will be subjected to an extraordinary strain. He will be, I suspect, neither very lofty, nor very base, but will compromise. I don't suppose, however, you care much about these far-away matters. I hope, my dear Grace, that your life is taking more and more a possible shape--that your summer has left you some pleasant memories, and your winter brings some cheerful hopes. I don't think I shall be so long again--at any rate my letters are no proof of my sentiments--by which I mean that my silence is no disproof; for after all I wish to be believed when I tell you that I am most affectionately yours, ...|$|E
