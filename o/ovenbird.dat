25|$|Parker Dam State Park and the {{surrounding}} Moshannon State Forest provides a habitat {{for a wide variety}} of wild creatures. There are many warblers and ravens to be seen in the dark coniferous forests. The rarely seen <b>ovenbird</b> and American redstart make their home in the deciduous forest. Turkey, beaver, white-tailed deer, coyotes and foxes can be spotted along the ridges, in the hollows and in the fields of the park. Bobcat, porcupine and elk also make their home in the woods of Parker Dam State Park. Elk are rarely seen in Pennsylvania, but there is a large herd that has thrived in the most remote and wooded parts of Clearfield, Cameron, Elk and Clinton counties.|$|E
25|$|Birdwatching {{activity}} peaks {{each spring}} (usually April) when dozens of migratory bird species can {{pass through the}} park in a single day. Many birds land inside the parade grounds of Fort Jefferson where they are often observed at close range. Common migratory warblers include the northern parula, American redstart, prairie warbler, hooded warbler, palm warbler, black-and-white warbler, common yellowthroat, yellow-rumped warbler, <b>ovenbird,</b> northern waterthrush, black-throated blue warbler, blackpoll warbler, and Cape May warbler, with more than 20 additional warbler species having shown up at least once. Several raptor species as well as cattle egrets are often seen hunting songbirds. Until early 2013 a small freshwater fountain existed beneath several seaside mahoe and buttonwood trees, and was the only freshwater source for many miles. Maintenance issues necessitated its removal, but a replacement water barrel is scheduled for installation {{in the fall of}} 2013. Each year several bird guides offer tours of Dry Tortugas National Park during April and early May when daily bird lists can often reach 100 or more species.|$|E
2500|$|Habitat damage: In Greenwich, Connecticut, the Greenwich Audubon Society's [...] of land {{have seen}} deer push out ground birds {{such as the}} <b>ovenbird</b> and black and white warbler. The deer have devastated species of plants once {{abundant}} on the Audubon group's land and ravaged low-lying vegetation, including hickory and hemlock saplings. Some once-abundant species in the area were completely absent as of late 2007, according to an Audubon official.|$|E
50|$|The band-tailed hornero, {{wing-banded hornero}} or tail-banded hornero, (Furnarius figulus), is {{a species of}} bird in the family Furnariidae, the <b>ovenbirds.</b> It is endemic to Brazil.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>ovenbirds</b> are {{a diverse}} group of {{insectivores}} which get their name from the elaborate, vaguely [...] "oven-like" [...] clay nests built by the horneros, although most other <b>ovenbirds</b> build stick nests or nest in tunnels or clefts in rock. The Spanish word for [...] "oven" [...] (horno) gives the horneros their name. Furnariid nests are always constructed with a cover, and up to six pale blue, greenish or white eggs are laid. The eggs hatch after 15 to 22 days, and the young fledge after a further 13 to 20 days.|$|R
50|$|The slaty antwren is {{normally}} found as pairs, and often joins a mixed-species feeding flock with woodcreepers, red-crowned ant tanagers, <b>ovenbirds</b> and Basileuterus warblers. It feeds on insects and spiders, taken from foliage.|$|R
2500|$|The Athabasca Plain {{ecoregion}} in the Boreal Shield provides {{breeding grounds}} for the Bohemian waxwing (Bombycilla garrulus), white-winged crossbill (Loxia leucoptera), Cape May warbler (Dendroica tigrina), Canada goose (Branta canadensis) and blackpoll warbler (Dendroica striata). In the south west area of the Boreal Shield ecozone lays the Churchill River Upland which has the second highest population of bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus). [...] This Upland area is home to waterfowl, such as the common loon (Gavia immer), red-breasted merganser (Mergus serrator), {{as well as other}} ducks, and geese on the many lakes of the region. The raven (Corvus corax), spruce grouse, gray jay (Perisoreus canadensis), Connecticut warbler (Oporornis agilis), northern three-toed woodpecker (Picoides dorsalis), osprey (Pandion haliaetus) and hawk owl (Surnia ulula) can be sighted in the boreal forests. The Mid-Boreal Upland ecoregion features these characteristic birds: white-throated sparrow (Zonotrichia albicollis), red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), American redstart (Setophaga ruticilla), bufflehead (Bucephala albeola), <b>ovenbird,</b> (Seiurus aurocapillus) and hermit thrush (Catharus guttatus). The ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus), Canada warbler (Wilsonia canadensis), ruby-crowned kinglet (Regulus calendula) and white-breasted nuthatch (Sitta carolinensis), American white pelican (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos) are common sightings in the Mid-Boreal Lowland ecoregion.|$|E
2500|$|Foraging for {{invertebrate}} prey on {{the ground}} often involves gleaning the leaf litter of the forest floor, sometimes flicking, flipping, or scratching through dead leaves. Birds can use their bills to flick or toss dead leaves from the ground to reveal prey residing beneath. The leaftossers of Central and South America and the pittas and laughingthrushes of Asia do this. An example of a bird that employs flipping is the <b>ovenbird,</b> a species of North American wood-warbler. It deliberately turns over leaves {{on the ground}} to search for spiders, worms, and such underneath. [...] In other parts of the world, similar leaf-flipping behavior has been observed in unrelated birds, such as the jungle babbler of India. Some birds, such as hummingbirds, will use their wings to create a blast of air to roll leaves over. Other birds rake a foot through the leaf litter, like a chicken, for the same purpose. This has been observed in buttonquails. Some American sparrows, such as the green-tailed towhee, perform a double-scratch by raking both legs simultaneously through the leaf-litter. They then catch prey items dislodged by the disturbance. Ground-foraging birds can be very hard for humans to observe, as they often occupy densely vegetated habitat, {{as in the case of}} the Bornean wren-babbler, which specializes in gleaning leaf litter in gullies in the forest of Southeast Asia.|$|E
50|$|The waterthrushes are a genus of New World warbler, Parkesia. The genus {{was split}} from Seiurus, which {{previously}} contained both waterthrush species and the <b>ovenbird.</b> When the genera split, the <b>ovenbird</b> {{was the only}} member left in Seiurus (making it a monotypic genus).|$|E
50|$|The sharp-tailed streamcreeper (Lochmias nematura) is a {{passerine}} bird of South America {{belonging to}} the family Furnariidae, the <b>ovenbirds.</b> It is {{the only member of}} the genus Lochmias. The species is also known as the streamside streamcreeper.|$|R
5|$|Thamnophilidae {{was removed}} from Formicariidae, leaving behind the antthrushes and antpittas, due to {{recognition}} of differences {{in the structure of}} the breastbone (sternum) and syrinx, and Sibley and Ahlquist's examination of DNAâ€“DNA hybridization. The Thamnophilidae antbirds are members of the infraorder Tyrannides (or tracheophone suboscines), one of two infraorders in the suborder Tyranni. The Thamnophilidae are now thought to occupy a fairly basal position within the infraorder, i. e. with regard to their relatives the antthrushes and antpittas, tapaculos, gnateaters, and also the <b>ovenbirds.</b> The sister group of the Thamnophilidae is thought to be the gnateaters. The <b>ovenbirds,</b> tapaculos, antthrushes and antpittas are thought to represent a different radiation of that early split.|$|R

50|$|The genus Xenops, {{which have}} usually been {{considered}} <b>ovenbirds,</b> represent an early divergence.
