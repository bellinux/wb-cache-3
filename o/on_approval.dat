2500|$|The fourth {{exemption}} is for any assessment which previously received majority voter {{approval from}} the voters voting in an election {{on the issue of}} the assessment.

The Miami were concerned that the Wea leaders were not present, although they were the primary inhabitants of the land being sold. The Miami also wanted any new land sales to be paid for by the acre, and not by the tract. Harrison agreed to make the treaty's acceptance contingent <b>on</b> <b>approval</b> by the Wea and other tribes in the territory being purchased, but he refused to purchase land by the acre. He countered that it was better for the tribes to sell the land in tracts so as to prevent the Americans from only purchasing their best lands by the acre and leaving them only poor land on which [...] to live.|$|E
2500|$|Ahead of {{the annual}} Board of Governors meeting where they were {{expected}} to vote <b>on</b> <b>approval</b> of the sale of the Kings to Hansen and Ballmer's group, as well as the relocation request, members of the NBA owners' finance and relocation committees held a meeting in New York City on April 3, 2013, for the Seattle group and the Sacramento group to each present their proposals. Any vote would only be on the PSA presented by Hansen and Ballmer, and the Sacramento proposal was considered a [...] "backup offer". Coming out of that meeting, the NBA removed the vote from the agenda of the BOG meeting and postponed it for two weeks while information was reviewed. Despite stated desires to the contrary, a bidding war began between Hansen's and Ranadivé's groups, including Hansen raising the team valuation of their offer twice from $525 million to $550 million to $625 million, and Ranadivé offering to forgo the team revenue sharing that has frequently kept smaller market teams like the Kings financially stable.|$|E

[...] During the negotiations of the Maastricht Treaty of 1992 the UK secured an opt-out from adopting the euro. [...] The Labour government of Tony Blair argued that the UK should join the euro, contingent <b>on</b> <b>approval</b> in a referendum, if five economic tests were met.

[...] The assessment of June 2003 concluded that not all were met. [...] The Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government elected in 2010 pledged not to join the euro during its term of office, due to expire in 2015.

[...] Providing for the regulation of capital, the Volcker Rule says that regulators are required to impose upon institutions capital requirements that are [...] "countercyclical, so that the amount of capital required to be maintained by a company increases in times of economic expansion and decreases in times of economic contraction", to ensure the safety and soundness of the organization.
