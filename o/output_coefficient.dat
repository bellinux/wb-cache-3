Deming and Stephan (1940) applied this non-survey method to update IO tables from existing IO tables.

Kagatsume (2004, 2006) suggested that the diagonal elements of R indicate the substitution change in each sector and the diagonal elements of S indicate the processing change in each sector.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the estimation of New Keynesian Phillips Curves (NKPC) and focuses on two issues: the weak instrument problem and the characterization of the steady states. It proposes some solutions from a global perspective. Using a global vector autoregressive (GVAR) model steady states are estimated as long-horizon expectations and valid instruments are constructed from the global variables as weighted averages. The proposed estimation strategy is illustrated using estimates of the NKPC for eight developed industrial countries. The GVAR generates global factors that are valid instruments and help alleviate the weak instrument problem. The steady states also reflect global influences and any long-run theoretical relationships that might prevail within and across countries in the global economy. The GVAR measure of the steady state performed better than the HP measure, and the use of foreign instruments substantially increased the precision of the estimates of the <b>output</b> <b>coefficient.</b> Copyright (c) 2009 The Ohio State University. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper studies optimal {{fiscal and}} {{monetary}} policy under sticky product prices. The theo-retical framework is a stochastic production economy without capital. The government finances an exogenous stream of purchases by levying distortionary income taxes, printing money, and issuing one-period nominally risk free bonds. The main {{findings of the}} paper are: First, for a miniscule degree of price stickiness (i. e., many times below available empirical estimates), the optimal volatility of inflation is near zero. This result stands in stark contrast with the high volatility of inflation implied by the Ramsey allocation when prices are flexible. The finding {{is in line with}} a recent body of work on optimal monetary policy under nominal rigidities that ignores the role of optimal fiscal policy. Second, even small deviations from full price flexibility induce near random walk behavior in government debt and tax rates. Third, sluggish price ad-justment raises the average nominal interest rate above the one called for by the Friedman rule. Finally, an interest-rate feedback rule whereby the nominal interest rate depends on inflation and output fits well the data emanating from the Ramsey economy. However, the fitted rule is not of the Taylor type, for the implied inflation coefficient is less than one and close to zero and the <b>output</b> <b>coefficient</b> is negative.

40|$|The {{discovery}} of new ceramic HTC materials in 1986 / 87 with critical temperatures above 77 K inaugurates additional {{applications in the}} field of small electrical machines. Therefore the present research project deals with preparing investigations first on liquid nitrogen cooled electrical machines and machine components, that can be extrapolated to using HTC - wound motors. It is intended to investigate 77 K properties of cheap standard materials of the electrical machine construction and to calculate performance characteristics of liquid nitrogen cooled polyphase machines. With these results material demands on HTC wires will be detected. A systematic theoretical and metrological study of materials and machines results in the following summary of the present research project: High quality standard materials of the usual 300 K temperature range can be used at 77 K, on principle there are partly worse material properties (e. g. iron losses). Nevertheless small electrical machines of frame size 250 W have an increase in <b>output</b> <b>coefficient</b> of two to four times {{and at the same time}} clearly raised efficiencies compared to the 300 K type.

The laminae are a single transversely polarized piezoelectric elements (PZ 29) sandwiched between two longitudinal-magnetic ally polarized magnetostrictive TD elements (Terfenol-D-TX GMM). The direct ME effect was determined by measuring laminate output with a Helmholtz-generated AC field (up to 7 Oe) in the range 50 Hz- 100 kHz biased by a DC field (0 - 1000 Oe). Peak voltage output occurred at the sample's mechanical resonant frequency, its value depending on the strength {{and direction of the}} applied magnetic field. The peak output was 3061 mV at 3 Oe AC field and 1000 Oe bias, equivalent to 74. 4 V cm(- 1) Oe(- 1). The peak <b>output</b> <b>coefficient,</b> however, was 93. 6 V cm(- 1) Oe(- 1) at 0. 1 Oe AC field and 1000 Oe DC bias. The reduction at higher drive amplitudes was attributed to increased Young's modulus of the TD phase. Anomalous peaks in the low frequency spectrum of sample's output are explained. The converse magnetoelectric effect was measured by recording the voltage induced in a solenoid encompassing the ME while exposed to a DC bias field and the PZ phase driven by a 10 VAC source. The peak output is shown to depend on the strength of the applied DC magnetic field and developed a maximum field of 15. 4 Oe at the sample's mechanical resonant frequency.
