5|$|An unusual slapstick mix of film noir, black {{comedy and}} B-movie conventions, the film portrays bizarre {{situations}} involving a death row inmate. The film was a box-office flop, {{and has since}} fallen into obscurity outside of fans <b>of</b> <b>Campbell</b> and Raimi. Few critics reviewed the film, though the little amount of critical attention it received was mostly negative. Several elements of the film influenced later productions by Raimi, {{and the failure of}} Crimewave directly led to the inception of Evil Dead II (1987). The film has achieved the status of a minor cult film.|$|E

5|$|A Japanese radio drama {{version of}} Metal Gear Solid, {{directed}} by Shuyo Murata and written by Motosada Mori, was produced {{shortly after the}} release of the original PlayStation game. 12 episodes were aired, from 1998 to 1999 on Konami's CLUB db program.

Set after the events of the PlayStation game, Snake, Meryl, Campbell and Mei Ling (all portrayed by their original Japanese voice actors) pursue missions in hostile third world nations as FOXHOUND. The new characters introduced include Sgt. Allen Iishiba (voiced by Toshio Furukawa), a Delta Force operative who assists Snake and Meryl, Col. Mark Cortez (v.b.

5|$|New York State Route333 (NY333) was an east–west {{state highway}} located in southeastern Steuben County, New York, in the United States. The western {{terminus}} {{of the route}} was at an intersection with County Route11 (CR11) and CR24 in Risingville, a hamlet within the town of Thurston. Its eastern terminus was at a junction with NY415 in the town <b>of</b> <b>Campbell.</b> In between, NY333 passed through the hamlet of Thurston. The route was assigned {{as part of the}} 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York and remained unchanged until April1, 1997, when ownership and maintenance of the route was transferred from the state of New York to Steuben County as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. NY333 was subsequently redesignated as County Route333.|$|E
5|$|On 7 May 1947, Beryl Derrick {{attended}} an investiture {{ceremony at the}} Government House, Adelaide, where she was presented with her late husband's Victoria Cross and Distinguished Conduct Medal by the Governor of South Australia, Lieutenant General Sir Charles Norrie.

5|$|Ray Parlour and Henry {{came off}} {{in the second half}} for Robert Pirès and Sylvain Wiltord. United created an early chance, but Van Nistelrooy was unable {{to make the most of}} Giggs' delivery. The player went down in the penalty area under the {{challenge}} <b>of</b> <b>Campbell,</b> prompting United players to appeal for a penalty; however, referee Steve Bennett decided to let play continue. Arsenal countered twice thereafter, but their attacks broke down on both counts. Vieira, Scholes and Quinton Fortune were booked for tackles during a 10-minute spell. Both clubs made substitutions in the midway point of the second half: for Arsenal, Bergkamp, Gilberto and Ljungberg were replaced by Francis Jeffers, Edu and Giovanni van Bronckhorst, whereas for United, Butt and Fortune came off for Eric Djemba-Djemba and John O'Shea. In the 72nd minute, Jeffers was shown a red card for kicking out at Neville. Ferguson brought on striker Diego Forlán for Neville six minutes later. Djemba-Djemba avoided a yellow card for his challenge on Campbell in the 80th minute; Bennett deemed it unintentional.|$|E
5|$|The low-budget horror film {{attracted}} {{the interest of}} producer Irvin Shapiro, who helped screen the film at the 1982 Cannes Film Festival. Horror author Stephen King gave a rave review of the film, which helped convince New Line Cinema to serve as its distributor. Though a meager commercial success in the United States, the film made its budget back through worldwide distribution, and grossed $2.4 million during its theatrical run. Both early and later critical reception were universally positive and {{in the years since}} its release, The Evil Dead has developed {{a reputation as one of}} the largest cult films and has been cited among the greatest horror films of all time. The Evil Dead launched the careers <b>of</b> <b>Campbell</b> and Raimi, who would collaborate on several films together throughout the years, including Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy.|$|E
5|$|M-33 {{was first}} {{designated}} by July 1, 1919. It {{ran along the}} current routing from Mio north to M-32 east of Atlanta. The highway also ran south of Mio to M-76 east of Roscommon using segments of what are now M-72 and M-144. By 1927, the southern section from Fairview to Roscommon was redesignated {{as a part of}} M-72. M-33 was shifted to run south of Mio to Rose City instead, creating the M-33/M-72 concurrency in the process. An extension was added {{by the end of the}} decade southward to M-55 at Campbell, a former community east of Selkirk in Ogemaw County. An earthen highway extension of M-33 north of Atlanta to US23 at Onaway was opened in 1934. A few years later in 1938, M-55 was realigned to follow a more direct path east of West Branch. At the same time, M-33 was extended south by a few miles to the new roadway south <b>of</b> <b>Campbell</b> and Selkirk. A lengthy northern extension was added to M-33 in 1940 when US23 was moved to a route along the Lake Huron shoreline between Rogers City and Cheboygan. The former route of US23 between the Afton area and Rogers City was redesignated as a discontinuous section of M-68, and M-33 was extended westward from Onaway along that highway to Afton and north to US27 (now M-27) near Cheboygan, creating the M-33/M-68 concurrency in southern Cheboygan and Presque Isle counties. By 1945, M-33 was extended southward again, this time to terminate at M-76 in Alger.|$|E
