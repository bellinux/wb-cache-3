5|$|Because {{norms for}} {{language}} use {{are shared by}} members of a specific group, communicative style also becomes a way of displaying and constructing group identity. Linguistic differences may become salient markers of divisions between social groups, for example, speaking a language with a particular accent may imply membership of an ethnic minority or social class, one's area of origin, or status {{as a second language}} speaker. These kinds of differences {{are not part of the}} linguistic system, but are an important part <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>people</b> use language as a social tool for constructing groups.|$|E

Pascal agreed with Montaigne that achieving certainty in these axioms and conclusions through human methods is impossible. He asserted that these principles can be grasped only through intuition, and that this fact underscored the necessity for submission to God in searching out truths.|$|E

25|$|The moral {{influence}} view can {{be combined}} {{with some of the}} other views of atonement. Indeed, Methodist theologian Vincent Taylor, while regarding the moral influence theory of atonement as inadequate by itself, described the moral influence theory as the 'truth' that is the 'presupposition of any worthy doctrine of the Atonement'. In the early centuries of the church, the moral influence view focused around the issue <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>people</b> can pass God's final judgment (namely through positive moral change). Some other atonement views, such as ransom from Satan, have nothing to say about final judgment and deal with other concerns. Such views can therefore be easily held in combination with the moral influence view.|$|E
25|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>people</b> {{lived in}} 1800s St. Augustine helped {{to confirm the}} interpretation of the property as a boarding house. For example, animal bones in abandoned trash pits provided clues to what was served on the table, shards of china helped identify the pattern used during Sarah Petty Anderson's ownership, and a cache of silver buttons and pins led to the discovery of a laundry shed footprint. In 2003, archaeologists found a rare 17th century double-barred, white bronze Caravaca cross {{at the bottom of a}} 19th-century trash pit. Crafted in Spain, it predates the boarding house era by two centuries and is the most mysterious object found on the site to date.|$|E

It laid the foundation for his theory of why unanticipated revolutions can occur. It is related to ideas of social proof as well as choice blindness.

Beyond Brokeback has been presented as a staged reading at other venues, such as Roosevelt University in Chicago, on November 13, 2011, together with a panel discussion and screening of the film.|$|E
25|$|On the one hand, a materialist view of {{landscape}} tends to stress how {{it may be}} seen in terms of a set of resources, for example for hunter-gatherers or early farming groups. This leads one to turn, for example, to optimal foraging theory and other economic models for an understanding <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>people</b> exploited the landscape 'rationally'. Postprocessualists like to argue that landscapes are always viewed in different ways by different peoples. They reject the 'rational' view of 'landscape-as-a-set-of-resources' as that of our own society and one that is ideologically loaded in its own way, loaded towards ideas of commodity and exploitation found in our own society. They suggest that ancient peoples would have had different views of what was 'real' in that landscape. On the other hand, an exclusively idealist view {{of landscape}} does not work either. Postprocessualists like to stress that such an understanding of landscape was not formed in the abstract—that the way people moved around and used that landscape affected their understanding of it.|$|E
500|$|These early {{theories}} exercised {{a lasting}} influence, and, {{when the work}} of unifying Romanian was accomplished in the late 19th century, they were used {{as a source of}} inspiration: Romania's major poet of the period, Mihai Eminescu, himself celebrated for having created the modern literary language, gave praise to Heliade for [...] "writing just as [...] is spoken". This assessment was shared by Ovid Densusianu, who wrote: [...] "Thinking <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>people</b> wrote back then, in thick, drawly, sleepy phrases, Heliade thus shows himself superior to all his contemporaries, and... we can consider him the first prose writer who brings in the note of modernity".|$|E
