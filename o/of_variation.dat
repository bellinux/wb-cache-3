5|$|The {{rediscovery of}} Gregor Mendel's laws of {{inheritance}} in 1900 ignited a fierce debate between two camps of biologists. In one camp were the Mendelians, who {{were focused on}} discrete variations {{and the laws of}} inheritance. They were led by William Bateson (who coined the word genetics) and Hugo de Vries (who coined the word mutation). Their opponents were the biometricians, who were interested in the continuous variation of characteristics within populations. Their leaders, Karl Pearson and Walter Frank Raphael Weldon, followed in the tradition of Francis Galton, who had focused on measurement and statistical analysis <b>of</b> <b>variation</b> within a population. The biometricians rejected Mendelian genetics on the basis that discrete units of heredity, such as genes, could not explain the continuous range <b>of</b> <b>variation</b> seen in real populations. Weldon's work with crabs and snails provided evidence that selection pressure from the environment could shift the range <b>of</b> <b>variation</b> in wild populations, but the Mendelians maintained that the variations measured by biometricians were too insignificant to account for the evolution of new species.|$|E

5|$|A population's genetic {{variation}} can be greatly reduced by a bottleneck, and even beneficial adaptations may be permanently eliminated. The loss <b>of</b> <b>variation</b> leaves the surviving population vulnerable to any new selection pressures such as disease, climate change or {{shift in the}} available food source, because adapting in response to environmental changes requires sufficient {{genetic variation}} in the population for natural selection to take place.|$|E
5|$|At present, {{the overall}} {{geomagnetic}} field is becoming weaker; the present strong deterioration {{corresponds to a}} 10–15% decline over the last 150 years and has accelerated {{in the past several}} years; geomagnetic intensity has declined almost continuously from a maximum 35% above the modern value achieved approximately 2,000 years ago. The rate of decrease and the current strength are within the normal range <b>of</b> <b>variation,</b> as shown by the record of past magnetic fields recorded in rocks.|$|E
5|$|Breeding {{of animals}} and plants showed related {{varieties}} varying in similar ways, or tending to revert to an ancestral form, and similar patterns <b>of</b> <b>variation</b> in distinct species were explained by Darwin as demonstrating common descent. He recounted how Lord Morton's mare apparently demonstrated telegony, offspring inheriting characteristics of a previous mate of the female parent, and accepted this process as increasing the variation available for natural selection.|$|E

5|$|Climate is the {{statistics}} of weather {{over long periods}} of time. It is measured by assessing the patterns <b>of</b> <b>variation</b> in temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, precipitation, atmospheric particle count and other meteorological variables in a given region {{over long periods of}} time. Climate differs from weather, in that weather only describes the short-term conditions of these variables in a given region.|$|E
5|$|For {{many years}} there was {{confusion}} between B.verticillata and B.littoralis (swamp banksia). Until 1984, {{the latter was}} circumscribed as encompassing what is now Banksia seminuda (river banksia), which has whorled leaves like B.verticillata. Thus {{it was easy to}} perceive B.verticillata as falling within the range <b>of</b> <b>variation</b> of this broadly defined species. The confusion was largely cleared up once B.seminuda was recognised as a distinct taxon.|$|E
5|$|Gene flow is the {{exchange}} of genes between populations and between species. It can therefore be a source <b>of</b> <b>variation</b> that is new to a population or to a species.

5|$|Identification of AVMs {{requires}} detailed {{medical imaging}} of the organs most commonly affected by these lesions. Not all AVMs cause symptoms or {{are at risk}} of doing so, and hence there is a degree <b>of</b> <b>variation</b> between specialists as to whether such investigations would be performed, and by which modality; often, decisions on this issue are reached together with the patient.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, a {{biochemical}} polymorphism {{study was}} conducted in four sample areas of the species. Electrophoretically demonstrable variation was found in one or more populations at 15 of 39 (38%) of the loci examined, and two and sometimes three alleles per locus were detected. At the least, the findings give an indication of the kind of genetic variation that may be found between populations within a species. The amount <b>of</b> <b>variation</b> was similar to findings in examinations of Peromyscus polionotus, Sigmodon, and Dipodomys.|$|E
5|$|Mutual {{intelligibility}} {{among these}} ASL varieties is high, and the variation is primarily lexical. For example, {{there are three}} different words for English about in Canadian ASL; the standard way, and two regional variations (Atlantic and Ontario), {{as shown in the}} videos on the right. Variation may also be phonological, meaning that the same sign may be signed in a different way depending on the region. For example, an extremely common type <b>of</b> <b>variation</b> is between the handshapes /1/, /L/, and /5/ in signs with one handshape.|$|E

5|$|Pteranodon was {{notable for}} its skull crest, though the {{function}} of this crest has been a subject of debate.

The fact that the crests vary so much rules out most practical functions other than for use in mating displays. Therefore, display was probably the main function of the crest, and any other functions were secondary.|$|E
5|$|The Book of Kells {{contains}} {{the text of}} the four Gospels based on the Vulgate. It does not, however, contain a pure copy of the Vulgate. There are numerous differences from the Vulgate, where Old Latin translations are used in lieu of Jerome's text. Although such variants are common in all the insular Gospels, there {{does not seem to be}} a consistent pattern <b>of</b> <b>variation</b> amongst the various insular texts. Evidence suggests that when the scribes were writing the text they often depended on memory rather than on their exemplar.|$|E

Finally, the study presents a Knowledge-Based Decision Support System (KBDSS) developed based on the data collected from these 79 institutional buildings, for making timely and more informed decisions for management <b>of</b> <b>variations.</b> To achieve the study objectives, an in-depth study of source documents and questionnaire survey was carried out for data collection. In-depth interviews with 62 professionals, {{who were involved in}} these projects, were analyzed. The results indicate that the total number <b>of</b> <b>variations</b> in upgrading projects were almost twice the total number <b>of</b> <b>variations</b> in new projects. The root causes <b>of</b> <b>variations</b> were grouped under five categories. The highest number <b>of</b> <b>variations</b> and variation orders were contributed from the Owner Related Variations (ORV) and Contractor Related Variations (CRV) groups. Further analysis of these two groups revealed the most important and common root causes <b>of</b> <b>variations</b> from both these groups. Furthermore, the study revealed the most frequent effects and most effective controls for each of the most important causes <b>of</b> <b>variations</b> identified that assisted in developing the KBDSS.
