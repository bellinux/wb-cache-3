The second sequel, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 was released on May 2, 2014. On June 17, 2013 Sony announced two more sequels to follow The Amazing Spider-Man 2, which were scheduled to release on June 10, 2016 and May 4, 2018, respectively. However, in July 2014, the third film was delayed to an unspecified date in 2018.|$|E

5|$|According to the Hittite inscriptions, {{it appears}} that the Ahhiya were a {{powerful}} empire, at the same scale as contemporary Egypt, Assyria and the Hittite Empire. Moreover, {{based on the fact that}} Attarsiya launched a military campaign in Anatolia and fielded one hundred chariots, in addition to infantry, Dutch researcher Jorrit Kelder suggested that Ahhiya must have had the military capacity <b>of</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>three</b> times the size of the Mycenaean kingdom of Pylos, based on the information recorded on the Linear B tablets unearthed from the specific palace. Based on this view, the Achaeans under Attarsiya may have formed some kind of alliance which included several Mycenaean kingdoms.|$|E

5|$|In Mahanoro, {{the biggest}} city near the cyclone's {{landfall}} in Madagascar, Eline disrupted power and water supplies while also leaving the town isolated. About 80% of buildings were {{damaged or destroyed}} there. In Marolambo, a village in eastern Madagascar, Eline killed six people. Heavy rainfall in the central portion of the nation caused landslides and flooding. Flooding also occurred in the west coast near Belo. The storm disrupted portions <b>of</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>three</b> highways. The storm left about 10,000people homeless, with about 1,500people forced to stay in storm shelters. Damage to public buildings was estimated at $300,000 (2000USD), Nationwide, Eline killed at least 64people and affected about a half-million people affected.|$|E
5|$|MTV {{reported}} in February 2008 that Summit Entertainment intended {{to create a}} series <b>of</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>three</b> films based on Meyer's books. The studio had optioned New Moon, the second book in the series, by October 2008, and confirmed their plans {{to make a film}} based on it November 22, 2008. Because Catherine Hardwicke had wanted more preparation time than Summit's schedule for the production and release of the sequel would provide, Chris Weitz was selected to direct it in December 2008.|$|E
5|$|Portions <b>of</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>three</b> {{prints of}} the film survive: a {{complete}} nitrate print with the car sometimes painted red, given to Méliès's granddaughter Madeleine Malthête-Méliès by an American collector; an incomplete hand-colored nitrate print, bought by Malthête-Méliès from a Belgian collector; and some fragments at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. In his book-length study of Méliès, the film historian John Frazer spoke highly {{of the film}}, noting its careful use of continuity of direction and comparing it to Mack Sennett's slapstick comedies and to the 1968 automobile film Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. Méliès made another film in a similar vein, Le Raid New York–Paris en automobile, in 1908; it was also received with success.|$|E

5|$|In 1992, Jack Horner {{and colleagues}} {{published}} an extremely preliminary {{report of a}} tyrannosaurid from the upper parts of the Campanian Two Medicine Formation in Montana, which was interpreted as a transitional species between Daspletosaurus and the later Tyrannosaurus. Currie (2003) stated that the tyrannosaurid from the Two Medicine Formation mentioned by Horner et al. (1992) may be an unnamed third species of Daspletosaurus. Another partial skeleton was reported from the Upper Two Medicine in 2001, preserving {{the remains of a}} juvenile hadrosaur in its abdominal cavity. This specimen was assigned to Daspletosaurus but not to any particular species. The remains <b>of</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>three</b> more Daspletosaurus have also been described in a Two Medicine bonebed by Currie et al. (2005); the authors stated that this fossil material likely represents then-unnamed species mentioned by Horner et al. (1992), but cautioned that further study and description of Daspletosaurus would be necessary before the species can be determined with certainty. In 2017, the Two Medicine Formation taxon was named as the new species D. horneri.|$|E
5|$|Like {{those of}} many other species of Marasmius, the fruit bodies of M.rotula can desiccate and shrivel in dry periods, then revive when {{sufficient}} moisture is available again {{in the form of}} rain or high humidity. Gilliam's study demonstrated that revived fruit bodies were capable of discharging spores over a period <b>of</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>three</b> weeks, whereas previous studies using similar methods with other Agaricomycetes showed spore discharge occurred over a shorter period of up to six days after revival. The potential for sustained spore production and discharge {{may be due to the}} growth of new basidioles (immature basidia) during periods of growth, which then complete maturation when the mushroom revives. This may also explain why the gills become thicker as the mushroom matures.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 2000, {{with the}} {{discovery}} <b>of</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>three</b> bodies (Quaoar, Sedna, and Eris) all comparable to Pluto in terms of size and orbit, {{it became clear that}} either they all had to be called planets or Pluto would have to be reclassified. Astronomers also knew that more objects as large as Pluto would be discovered, and the number of planets would start growing quickly. They were also concerned about the classification of planets in other planetary systems. In 2006, the matter came to a head with the first measurement of the size of Eris. That measurement had showed Eris (as it was mistakenly believed to be until the New Horizons mission to Pluto) to appear to be slightly larger than Pluto, and so was thought to be equally deserving of the status of 'planet' at the time.|$|E

5|$|The {{conversion}} of the Archbishop of Cologne to Protestantism triggered religious and political repercussions throughout the Holy Roman Empire. His conversion had widespread implications {{for the future of}} the Holy Roman Empire's electoral process established by the Golden Bull of 1356. In this process, seven Imperial Electors—the four secular electors of Bohemia, Brandenburg, the Palatinate, and Saxony; and the three ecclesiastical electors of Mainz, Trier, and Cologne—selected an emperor. The presence <b>of</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>three</b> inherently Catholic electors, who collectively governed some of the most prosperous ecclesiastical territories in the Empire, guaranteed the delicate balance of Catholics and Protestants in the voting; only one other elector needed to vote for a Catholic candidate, ensuring that future emperors would remain in the so-called Old Faith. The possibility of one of those electors shifting to the Protestant side, and of that elector producing an heir to perpetuate this shift, would change the balance in the electoral college in favor of the Protestants.|$|E
5|$|The {{pay-per-view}} event {{featured the}} buildup of a rivalry among two stables, groups <b>of</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>three</b> wrestlers. The two groups were the Corporate Ministry and the Union. The Corporate Ministry was formed when the Corporation merged with the Ministry of Darkness; the Corporate Ministry consisted of Viscera, the Big Boss Man, and the Acolytes (Bradshaw and Faarooq). Throughout the month of May, the Ministry was involved in matches with Mankind, Ken Shamrock, the Big Show, and Test, and in retaliation, the four wrestlers formed the Union stable. The WWF continued to enhance the feud over several weeks, which included a brawl among all eight wrestlers on May 10, 1999. The evolving plot led to the promotion of an eight-man elimination tag team match between both groups at Over the Edge. In this bout, the team that eliminated all of its opponents would win.|$|E

5|$|Twenty {{isotopes}} {{of sodium}} are known, but only 23Na is stable. 23Na is {{created in the}} carbon-burning process in stars by fusing two carbon atoms together; this requires temperatures above 600 megakelvins and a star <b>of</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>three</b> solar masses. Two radioactive, cosmogenic isotopes are the byproduct of cosmic ray spallation: 22Na has a half-life of 2.6 years and 24Na, a half-life of 15 hours; all other isotopes have a half-life of less than one minute. Two nuclear isomers have been discovered, the longer-lived one being 24mNa with a half-life of around 20.2 milliseconds. Acute neutron radiation, as from a nuclear criticality accident, converts some of the stable 23Na in human blood to 24Na; the neutron radiation dosage of a victim can be calculated by measuring the concentration of 24Na relative to 23Na.|$|E
