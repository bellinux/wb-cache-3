40|$|A shallow solar-pond {{integrated}} with a <b>baffle</b> <b>plate</b> is investigated theoretically and experimentally under Tanta prevailing weather conditions. A transient mathematical model is presented for the pond. The energy-balance equations for {{various parts of}} the pond are solved analytically using the elimination technique. In order to validate the theoretical model, experiments are performed under the batch mode of heat extraction with a black painted <b>baffle</b> <b>plate</b> made of stainless steel, with and without vents in the plate, for different masses of water in the upper and lower layers. It is found that the pond-water temperature decreases with increasing vent area; therefore, the <b>baffle</b> <b>plate</b> should be used without vents with shallow depths of the upper water-layer. Experiments have also been carried out using <b>baffle</b> <b>plates</b> made from Al and mica in order to study the effect of the thermal conductivity of the <b>baffle</b> <b>plate</b> on the pond's performance. The average temperature of the pond water is found to be less dependent on the thermal conductivity of the <b>baffle</b> <b>plate.</b> It is also inferred that the present system could provide 88 L of hot water at a maximum temperature of 71 Â°C at 3 : 00 pm with a daily efficiency of 64. 3 % when the <b>baffle</b> <b>plate</b> is used without vents. The pond can retain hot water until 7 : 00 am of the next day at a temperature of 43 Â°C, which can be used for most domestic applications. Comparisons between experimental and theoretical results indicated that the theoretical model could be used for estimating the pond's performance with good accuracy.

The effects of ground height, <b>baffle</b> <b>plate</b> edge, and jet exit turbulent intensity were assessed, and Navier-Stokes equations were solved using computational fluid dynamics. Turbulence closure was achieved using a k-e model, and the result compared with calculations obtained with a differential stress model. Three <b>baffle</b> <b>plate</b> edges were tested (rounded, squared, and chamfered), and the ground heights varied from rj = 0. 15 to 0. 8. It was found that flow mechanisms varied significantly with ground heights. A coherent vortex existed between the <b>baffle</b> <b>plate</b> and {{the ground at the}} low ground heights (17 0. 25), the vortex disappeared and separation at the plate edge played an important part in determining the lift loss.

40|$|Abstract [...] The {{triangular}} {{design of a}} solar water heater not only enhances the overall gain to the system but also improves the natural convection between the absorbing plate and the water, leading to better performance of the system. A night insulation cover is used at the top surface of the heater to reduce the losses from the system during the off-sunshine hours. Another {{way to reduce the}} losses from the system is by using an insulating <b>baffle</b> <b>plate</b> in the tank. This plate divides the tank water into two portions, the water above this plate is known as the upper column and below is known as the lower column. The water of the two columns is in contact with each other {{with the help of the}} incoming and outgoing vents provided in the <b>baffle</b> <b>plate.</b> This plate also suppresses losses from the lower column during the off-sunshine hours. In this paper, we have studied the effect of a <b>baffle</b> <b>plate</b> on the performance ofa triangular built-in-storage solar water heater. To obtain the thermal behavior of the system, the energy balance quations are written at the different nodes, and the well-known finite difference forward time step marching technique is used for their solution. The proposed system is studied by varying the vent area, the water mass in the two columns and under a constant flow rate for different durations. The effects of the thermal conductivity and thickness of the <b>baffle</b> <b>plate</b> on the water temperature are also investigated. It is found that the presence of the <b>baffle</b> <b>plate</b> greatly improves the system performance during off-sunshine hours...|$|R

40|$|Gold that {{is brought}} from artisanal and {{small-scale}} gold mining areas to gold shops for processing and sale typically contains 5 - 40 % mercury. The uncontrolled {{removal of the}} residual mercury in gold shops by using high-temperature evaporation can be {{a significant source of}} mercury emissions in urban areas where the shops are located. Emissions from gold shop hoods during a burn can exceed 1, 000 mg/m{sup 3 }. Because the saturation concentration of mercury vapor at operating temperatures at the hood exhaust is less than 100 mg/m{sup 3 }, the dominant component of the exhaust {{is in the form of}} aerosol or liquid particles. The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), with technical support from Argonne National Laboratory (Argonne), has completed a project to design and test a technology to remove the dominant aerosol component in the emissions from gold shops. The objective was to demonstrate a technology that could be manufactured at low cost and by using locally available materials and manufacturing capabilities. Six prototypes designed by Argonne were locally manufactured, installed, and tested in gold shops in Itaituba and Creporizao, Brazil. The initial prototype design incorporated a pebble bed as the media for collecting the mercury aerosols, and a mercury collection efficiency of over 90 % was demonstrated. Though achieving high efficiencies, the initial prototype was determined to have practical disadvantages such as excessive weight, a somewhat complex construction, and high costs (>US$ 1, 000). To further simplify the construction, operation, and associated costs, a second prototype design was developed in which the pebble bed was replaced with slotted steel <b>baffle</b> <b>plates.</b> The system was designed to have flexibility for installation in various hood configurations. The second prototype with the <b>baffle</b> <b>plate</b> design was installed and tested in several different hood/exhaust systems to determine the optimal installation configuration. The significance of coagulation and collection of the mercury aerosols in exhaust ducts, which is dependent on the hood and collector configuration, was also evaluated. Prototype demonstration tests verified the theoretical basis for mercury aerosol capture that can be used to optimize the <b>baffle</b> <b>plate</b> design, flow rates, and hood exhaust ducts and plenum to achieve 80 % or higher removal efficiencies. Results indicated that installation configuration significantly influences a system's capture efficiency. Configurations that retained existing inlet ducts resulted in system efficiencies of more than 80 %, whereas installation configurations without inlet ducts significantly reduced capture efficiency. As an alternative to increasing the volume of inlet ducts, the number of <b>baffle</b> <b>plates</b> in the system baffle assembly could be doubled to increase efficiency. Recommended installation and operation procedures were developed on the basis of these results. A water-based mercury capture system developed in Indonesia for installation in smaller shops was also tested and shown to be effective for certain applications. The cost of construction and installation of the <b>baffle</b> <b>plate</b> prototype was approximately US$ 400. These costs were reported as acceptable by local gold shop owners and government regulators, and were significantly lower than the cost of an alternate charcoal/copper mesh mercury filter available in the region, which costs about US$ 10, 000. A sampling procedure that consists of a particle filter combined with a vapor analyzer was demonstrated as an effective procedure for analyzing both the aerosol and vapor components of the mercury concentrations. Two key findings for enhancing higher mercury collection were identified. First, the aerosol/vapor mercury emissions must be given sufficient time for the mercury particles to coagulate to a size that can be readily captured by the <b>baffle</b> <b>plates.</b> An interval of at least 6 seconds of transit time between the point of evaporation and contact with the slotted <b>baffle</b> <b>plates</b> is recommended. Some particles will also deposit in the exhaust ducts between the point of evaporation and the <b>baffle</b> <b>plates.</b> Second, the slots in the <b>baffle</b> <b>plates</b> create jets that force the mercury particles to impinge and adhere on downstream surfaces. The <b>baffle</b> <b>plates</b> should closely follow the designs developed for this system to be most effective...|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} {{of a high}} temperature shell and tube heat exchanger and chemical decomposer (thereafter — heat exchanger) with straight tube configuration have been performed using Fluent 6. 2. 16 code to examine flow distribution on the tube side. The heat exchanger can {{be a part of}} sulfur iodine thermochemical water splitting cycle {{which is one of the}} most studied cycles for hydrogen production. Uniformity of the flow distribution in the heat exchanger is very critical because the flow maldistribution among the tube or shell sides can result in decreasing of chemical decomposition and increasing of pumping power. In the current study the flow rate uniformity in the heat exchanger tubes has been investigated. Simulations of the straight tube configuration, tube configuration with <b>baffle</b> <b>plate</b> arrangement and with pebble bed region inside the tubes were performed to examine flow distribution on the tube side. It was found the flow maldistribution along the tube direction is very serious with the simple tube configuration. An improvement of the header configuration has been done by introducing a <b>baffle</b> <b>plate</b> in to the header section. With the introduction of the <b>baffle</b> <b>plate,</b> there was a noticeable decrease in the flow maldistribution in the tubes. Uniformity of flow was also investigated with catalytic bed inside the tubes. A significant decrease in flow maldistribution was observed with this arrangement. But if the catalytic bed zone is created on the shell side, then the improved header configuration with a <b>baffle</b> <b>plate</b> is best suitable to avoid flow maldistribution...|$|R

40|$|In the {{analysis}} of an acoustic radiation mode of a <b>baffled</b> <b>plate,</b> Rayleigh integral with free space Green’s function is involved. The boundary element method (BEM) {{is one of the}} approaches to compute its modes and radiation efficiencies. In this paper a fast multipole BEM in conjunction with an iterative solver based on the implicit restart Arnold method is proposed to efficiently and accurately evaluate acoustic radiation modes and efficiencies. Even though a 3 D free space Green’s function is used here, a quad tree is used for the hierarchical tree structure of the boundary mesh instead of an oct tree, which can speed up the fast multipole BEM. Similar to the analytical integration of moment evaluations, the analytical integration is also employed to compute the local expansion coefficients which further improves the efficiency of the fast multipole BEM for {{the analysis}} of an acoustic radiation mode of <b>baffled</b> <b>plates.</b> Comparison between numerical and theoretical radiation efficiencies of a <b>baffled</b> circular <b>plate</b> vibrating as a piston shows that the fast multipole BEM proposed here can give results with very good accuracy.

The present paper describes the results of an experimental study of the flow pattern and the residual concentration of old water in a tank. The effect of the shapes of the inlet and outlet pipes on the displacement efficiency of old water in the tank was investigated. The displacement efficiency of old water in a tank that has inlet and outlet pipes {{at one end of the}} tank (Type 2) is better than that in a tank that has inlet and outlet pipes at the center of the tank (Type 1). The displacement efficiency of water inside the tank that has an inlet pipe with a diverging nozzle and an outlet pipe with a circular <b>baffle</b> <b>plate</b> (Type 5) is better than that of the other tank.
