40|$|Dupont's Marshall Laboratory is an {{automotive}} paint {{research and}} development facility in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The campus is comprised of several buildings that are served by Trigen-Philadelphia Energy Corporation's district steam loop. In 1996 Dupont management {{announced that it was}} considering moving the facility out of Philadelphia primarily due to the high operating cost compared to where they were considering relocating. The city officials responded by bringing the local electric and gas utilities to the table to negotiate better rates for Dupont. Trigen also requested the opportunity to propose energy savings opportunities, and dedicated a team of engineers to review Dupont's steam system to determine if energy savings could be realized within the steam system infrastructure. As part of a proposal to help Dupont reduce energy costs while continuing to use Trigen's steam, Trigen recommended modifications to increase energy efficiency, reduce steam system maintenance costs and implement small scale cogeneration. These recommendations included reducing the medium pressure <b>steam</b> <b>distribution</b> to low pressure, eliminating the medium pressure to low pressure reducing stations, installing a back pressure steam turbine generator, and preheating the domestic hot water with the condensate. Dupont engineers evaluated these recommended modifications and chose to implement most of them. An analysis of Dupont's past steam consumption revealed that the <b>steam</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>system</b> sizing was acceptable if the steam pressure was reduced from medium to low. After a test of the system and a few modifications, Dupont reduced the <b>steam</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>system</b> to low pressure. Energy efficiency is improved since the heat transfer losses at the low pressure are less than at the medium pressure <b>distribution.</b> Additionally, <b>steam</b> <b>system</b> maintenance will be significantly reduced since 12 pressure reducing stations are eliminated. With the steam pressure reduction now occurring at one location, the opportunity existed to install a backpressure turbine generator adjacent to the primary pressure reducing station. The analysis of Dupont's steam and electric load profiles demonstrated that cost savings could be realized with the installation of 150 kW of self-generation. There were a few obstacles, including meeting the utility's parallel operation requirements, that made this installation challenging. Over two years have passed since the modifications were implemented, and although cost savings are difficult to quantify since process steam use has increased, the comparison of steam consumption to heating degree days shows a reducing trend. Dupont's willingness to tackle energy conservation projects without adversely affecting their process conditions can be an example to other industrial steam users...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the damage that can occur in <b>steam</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>systems</b> due to high pressures generated by condensate being swept through pipework by high pressure steam. Two cases have been considered. The first situation is one where an isolated slug of water is propelled through a pipeline by high pressure gas and impacts against an obstruction, in this case an orifice plate. In the experimental tests compressed air was used to propel a slug of water through a 13 m long 50 mm diameter pipeline; impact pressures of up to 300 bar were generated. The second case considers the damage that is found to occur in a particular component of a steam system - a steam float trap. Damage was inflicted by slug impact and by pressures generated from water hammer in the main line. Although water slugs are often blamed for steam trap failures, the damage inflicted by this mechanism was inconsistent with that found in practice and it is concluded that they are not responsible. Water hammer in the main line could, however, be the cause of failure...|$|R

Our assessments {{are based on a}} spectral-based energy signature scheme that interprets acoustic vibration sensor data to estimate steam flow rates and assess steam traps status. Experimental results show that the energy signature scheme has the potential to identify different steam trap states and it has sufficient sensitivity to estimate flow rate. Moreover, results indicate a nearly quadratic relationship over the test region between the overall energy signature factor and flow rate in the pipe. We are able to present the steam flow and steam trap status, sensor readings, and the assessed alerts as an interactive overlay within a web-based Google Earth geographic platform that enables decision makers to take remedial action.

However, even with these relatively high prices the industry still finds it difficult to build a business case to justify waste heat recovery projects. The Steel Industry has large quantities of waste heat and there are technologies readily available for its capture, but often the issue has been finding a cost effective ‘end use’. Individual schemes incorporating both capturing and an ‘end use’ for the waste heat often incur high capital costs with resulting long payback times. This thesis defines the development and modelling of a strategy and methodology for the utilisation of waste heat recovery in a UK based Steelworks. The methodology involves the utilisation of the existing <b>steam</b> <b>distribution</b> circuit to link the possible waste heat schemes together with a single ‘end user’ thus limiting the capital requirement for each subsequent project. The thesis defines {{the development of a}} numerical model that is initially verified through extensive comparison to actual plant data from a series of pre-defined operational scenarios. The model is used to predict the pressure and temperature effects on the <b>steam</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>system</b> as the waste heat recovery boilers from various areas of the case study steelworks are connected up to it. The developed strategy stimulated significant capital investment for the CSSW and has generated over 100, 000 MWh and is therefore saving over £ 7 m and 50, 000 tonnes of indirect CO 2 emissions per annum.

BACKGROUND Over the last several decades, both manufacturing processes and power plants have been significantly changed by the rapid evolution of process control systems. Each new generation of technology has im proved manufacturing quality and productivity. Each new technology forces a reevaluation of audit meth ods to assure proper application of the new systems. Prior to 1960 s, manufacturing industries were adequately staffed with knowledgeable personnel with a detailed understanding of the process and operation of the plant. Without automation, plants relied upon resident experts to run and maintain their equipment. Automation was single or cascaded controllers with limited functionality. With the advent of the modern computer and the microprocessor during the 1970 s, industry immediately accelerated the automation process. Corporate cost cutting measures and the down sizing trend of the 1980 s, consequently eroded much of the front-line expertise in plant operation, engi neering and maintenance. The elimination of experi enced supervisors and engineers placed increasing responsibility on process operators.
