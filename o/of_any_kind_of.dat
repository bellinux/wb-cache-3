Beilhart believed very strongly in the individual's right to guide his own actions, and not be dictated to by others. While there was no mention <b>of</b> <b>any</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> organization or hierarchy in any documents, as the leader, Beilhart likely made important decisions concerning the group. There is no record <b>of</b> <b>any</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> internal conflict between members.|$|E

5|$|During the Kingdom, the Senate {{consisted}} of persons selected {{to the position}} by the King, a power which the consuls inherited {{after the end of}} the monarchy. In the very early republic, senators were primarily chosen due to their birth, but by the late Republic, and especially after Sulla, membership in the Senate became predicated on having previously held a magistracy. In the late 4th century BC, the consul's power to control Senate membership was transferred to the censor, exercised with considerable discretion, until laws passed in the late Republic formalised some kind of hearing before censorial decisions. In line with the censor's duty to protect morals, senators were required to be of good character, not have been found guilty of a criminal offence, and not be a person tainted with ignominy (e.g. bankrupts, former gladiators, prostitutes, or deserters). Before the time of Augustus, there is no evidence <b>of</b> <b>any</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> property qualification. The Senate {{consisted of}} around 300 prior to the dictatorship of Sulla, but after his dictatorship, it consisted of somewhere over 500 men.|$|E

25|$|Bound in Blood {{received}} mainly positive reviews. Most critics {{praised the}} plot, the general shooting mechanics, the game's authentic western tone, and the multiplayer mode.

25|$|There {{is another}} {{powerful}} factor which works against the chance <b>of</b> <b>any</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> peaceful reconstruction {{and which is}} equally negative for all levels of society: this is the extreme isolation in which the regime has placed both society and itself. This isolation has not only separated the regime from society, and all sectors of society from each other, but also put the country in extreme isolation {{from the rest of}} the world. This isolation has created for all—from the bureaucratic elite to the lowest social levels—an almost surrealistic picture of the world and of their place in it. Yet the longer this state of affairs helps to perpetuate the status quo, the more rapid and decisive will be its collapse when confrontation with reality becomes inevitable.|$|E
