40|$|Railway wheels {{that have}} been <b>overheated</b> {{as a result of}} {{abnormal}} friction braking conditions may develop fatigue cracks, and ultimately fail, due to the presence of tensile residual stresses in the wheel rim. A review of wheel failures suggests that industry practice for the management of <b>overheated</b> wheels may be inadequate for some conditions. The application of more stringent inspection procedures and non-destructive measurement of residual stresses in wheels known to have been <b>overheated</b> provides the potential to reduce such failures...|$|R

5|$|Some frogs such as Bokermannohyla alvarengai, which basks in sunlight, lighten {{their skin}} colour when hot (and darkens when cold), making their skin reflect more heat and so avoid <b>overheating.</b>|$|E
5|$|An {{inspection}} includes {{external and}} internal inspection for damage, corrosion, and correct colour and markings. The failure criteria {{vary according to the}} published standards of the relevant authority, but may include inspection for bulges, <b>overheating,</b> dents, gouges, electrical arc scars, pitting, line corrosion, general corrosion, cracks, thread damage, defacing of permanent markings, and colour coding.|$|E
40|$|We tested whether belly-soaking (i. e. wetting of ventral plumage) in {{incubating}} Kentish Plovers Charadrius alexandrinus {{in a hot}} environment {{serves to}} cool <b>overheated</b> eggs, or whether belly-soaking would mainly serve for adult thermoregulation, and egg wetting would be a mere consequence of the ventral feathers of incubating adults being wet. When ambient temperature was high (> 30 °C), body temperature of incubating Kentish Plovers increased with ambient temperatures. When adults departed from nests to belly-soak, egg temperatures were not critical for embryos. However, eggs in exposed nests <b>overheated</b> to levels that may be lethal for embryos when adults left the nests to belly-soak, and adults also employed belly-soaking to cool down <b>overheated</b> eggs {{when they returned to}} their nests. Indeed, the cooling rate of eggs was much faster when they were wetted. We conclude that the primary function of belly-soaking in the Kentish Plover is to dissipate body heat in heat-stressed incubating adults, rather than to cool <b>overheated</b> eggs. Eggs <b>overheated</b> as a consequence of short-term interruptions in nest attendance by heat-stressed adults to belly-soak, and Plovers employed secondarily belly-soaking to cool down <b>overheated</b> eggs. These results indicate that adult thermoregulation and egg cooling are not mutually exclusive functions of belly-soaking. © 2006 The Authors. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

5|$|Laika {{died within}} hours from <b>overheating,</b> {{possibly}} {{caused by a}} failure of the central R-7 sustainer to separate from the payload. The true cause and time of her death were not made public until 2002; instead, it was widely reported that she died when her oxygen ran out on day six or, as the Soviet government initially claimed, she was euthanised prior to oxygen depletion.|$|E
5|$|Nests may be {{protected}} from physical threats such as flooding and <b>overheating</b> by elaborate nest architecture. Workers of Cataulacus muticus, an arboreal species that lives in plant hollows, respond to flooding by drinking water inside the nest, and excreting it outside. Camponotus anderseni, which nests in the cavities of wood in mangrove habitats, deals with submergence under water by switching to anaerobic respiration.|$|E

5|$|Carriage and {{shipment}} of {{some kinds of}} lithium batteries may be prohibited aboard certain types of transportation (particularly aircraft) because of the ability of most types of lithium batteries to fully discharge very rapidly when short-circuited, leading to <b>overheating</b> and possible explosion in a process called thermal runaway. Most consumer lithium batteries have built-in thermal overload protection to prevent this type of incident, or are otherwise designed to limit short-circuit currents. Internal shorts from manufacturing defect or physical damage can lead to spontaneous thermal runaway.|$|E

5|$|Most {{materials}} with high thermal conductivity are also electrically conductive, such as metals. In contrast, pure synthetic diamond has high thermal conductivity, but negligible electrical conductivity. This combination is invaluable for electronics where diamond {{is used as}} a heat sink for high-power laser diodes, laser arrays and high-power transistors. Efficient heat dissipation prolongs the lifetime of those electronic devices, and the devices' high replacement costs justify the use of efficient, though relatively expensive, diamond heat sinks. In semiconductor technology, synthetic diamond heat spreaders prevent silicon and other semiconducting materials from <b>overheating.</b>|$|E
