5|$|On May 6, Hamels was {{suspended}} for five games after hitting Bryce Harper in his lower back with a pitch, after admitting that it was intentional. On July 21, 2012, Hamels hit his first career home run off San Francisco Giants pitcher Matt Cain, who had homered <b>off</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> in {{the top half of}} the same inning, the first time in MLB that two pitchers had hit home runs off of each other in the same inning.|$|E
5|$|Nick Swisher {{opened the}} top of the fifth inning with a double and scored on a single to center field by Andy Pettitte. This was Pettitte's first career postseason RBI and the first RBI by a Yankees pitcher in a World Series since Jim Bouton in 1964. Derek Jeter {{followed}} Pettitte with another single, and both runners scored on a two-run double by Johnny Damon. Cole Hamels then walked Teixeira and was relieved by J.A. Happ. Happ closed out the fifth without allowing further scoring, but Nick Swisher added to the Yankees lead with a solo home run <b>off</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> in the sixth. Werth hit his second solo home run of the game leading off the bottom of the sixth to close the Yankees lead to 6–4, becoming the second Phillies player to hit multiple home runs in this World Series.|$|E
5|$|Affeldt {{spent the}} entire 2007 season in the bullpen, where he {{was used as a}} lefty specialist. Affeldt had a 2.15 ERA through his first fiftysix games of the year. He did not give up a home run until Pete Laforest hit one <b>off</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> in an 119 loss to the San Diego Padres on August 16. He {{struggled}} {{at the end of the}} year, with a 7.30 ERA in his final nineteen games. He still finished the year 43, with a 3.51 ERA in seventy-five games, and the Rockies made the playoffs as the NL Wild Card.

The Rockies swept the series to advance to the Championship Series against the Arizona Diamondbacks. In the first game, Affeldt entered with two outs and the bases loaded with the Rockies leading 51. He retired Stephen Drew to help the Rockies win 5–1. The Rockies swept the Diamondbacks to meet the Boston Red Sox in the World Series. Affeldt pitched in all four games of the World Series without giving up a run, but the Rockies were swept by the Red Sox. Affeldt became a free agent after the season.|$|E

5|$|Former WWF Champion Randy Savage was {{the last}} wrestler to enter the match. The wrestlers fought and several men were {{eliminated}} in quick succession, leaving Backlund, Martel, Yokozuna, and Savage. Backlund eliminated Martel but was then eliminated by Yokozuna. Backlund was in the ring for one hour, one minute, and ten seconds, which set a new record for time spent in a Royal Rumble match. Savage gained the advantage over Yokozuna; he knocked him down and performed a diving elbow drop from the top rope. He tried to pin Yokozuna, although pinfalls are not counted during a Royal Rumble. Yokozuna pushed Savage <b>off</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> so hard that Savage flew over the top rope and onto the arena floor. As a result, Yokozuna was named {{the winner of the}} 1993 Royal Rumble match. During the match, he eliminated seven wrestlers, which broke the previous record for most eliminations in a Royal Rumble match.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Peter {{begins to}} insult Lois about her {{advancing}} age, including her minor strands of gray hair. This makes her extremely self-conscious, and soon Lois {{becomes aware of}} her lust for a younger man. After introducing her new boyfriend, Anthony, to the family, Meg goes on to make out {{with him on the}} family couch, with Lois watching over nearby. Jealous of her daughter's new-found love, she begins hitting on Anthony. Later that day, Lois sends Meg to pick up her grandfather, leaving her all alone with Anthony. The two then begin making out on the couch, but Meg returns to the house only a few moments later and discovers them. Angry at her mother for ruining her chance at having a normal boyfriend, Meg threatens Lois to lay <b>off</b> <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> pulling out one of her own teeth in frustration. Lois quickly agrees, but is still angry with Peter for continually insulting her. She confronts him about this, and he admits that he was actually embarrassed about his own advancing age, as well as his lack of fitness, and was only insulting Lois in order to distract her from the fact that she could be with a much better-looking man. He apologizes for his behavior, and Lois forgives him.|$|E

25|$|Okajima {{allowed a}} home run to John Buck on his very first pitch in the major leagues. It was the 7th time in MLB history a pitcher gave up {{a home run}} on his first pitch. However, Okajima then {{proceeded}} to hold opponents scoreless for nearly two months until the Yankees scored a run <b>off</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> via a fielder's choice on May 22. At {{the start of the}} 2007 Red Sox season, injuries and poor performances limited the effectiveness of anticipated setup relievers Mike Timlin and Joel Piñeiro. Okajima stepped into the role of primary setup man for closer Jonathan Papelbon and quickly {{became one of the most}} dominant relievers in the major leagues. Through the first two months of the season, Okajima cemented himself as the top setup man in the Red Sox bullpen garnering the American League Rookie of the Month for April. Okajima's scoreless streak from April to May 2007 was the longest by a Red Sox left-hander since Bruce Hurst 20 years prior.|$|E
25|$|The {{main event}} was between Vader (accompanied by Harley Race) and Ric Flair for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. Flair {{would have to}} retire from {{professional}} wrestling if he lost. The match started with Vader having the advantage with attacks. After Vader performed a gorilla press slam, Flair rolled outside the ring, and Vader performed a gorilla press drop onto the guard rail. Vader then missed an attack, {{and ran into the}} guard rail. Flair fought back, and sent Vader into the ringpost. Race then attacked Flair, and Vader regained the advantage. Vader dominated Flair, performing a superplex and a body avalanche. Flair fought back, and sent Vader's left leg into the ringpost. Flair attacked the leg with a chair, and continued to target the leg. After Vader missed a corner slingshot splash, Flair applied the figure four leglock. Vader reached the ropes, and fought back, but missed a moonsault. Flair attempted to pin Vader while Race climbed the turnbuckle Vader jumped from. Race attempted a diving headbutt to break up the pin, but Vader powered Flair <b>off</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> to kick out just as Race jumped and as a result the champion took the diving headbutt from his manager. After referee Randy Anderson threw Race out of the ring, Flair hit a running forearm smash on Vader then proceeded to chop the champion repeatedly. Flair then attempted another running maneuver only to be met with a bell clap from Vader. Flair then grabbed Vader's left leg, causing him to trip and fall, and pinned him with a roll-up to win the match and the title.|$|E

2500|$|In a 1–1 {{game the}} Red Sox had {{the bases loaded}} with nobody out {{in the bottom of}} the ninth but could not score. The White Sox scored twice off of Craig Krimbrel in extra innings and took game one of the series. Steven Wright pitched another 9 inning game, the only run was unearned to reclaim the American League lead in ERA. Chris Sale of the White Sox earned the MLB best 12th win of the season in game two. Clay Buchholz, who {{returned}} to the rotation, pitched 5 frames and gave up three runs. Eduardo Rodríguez handed the bullpen a two-run lead in game three after six innings, but Koji Uehara gave up two home runs in the eighth and Boston dropped three games in a row. In game four the June misfortunes continued. Against a struggling James Shields, who only pitched 11 [...] innings in his last four starts with a 24.62 ERA and 3.97 WHIP, Boston could only score once <b>off</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> in the first five innings and lost Chris Young in the second inning, who pulled his hamstring circling the bases and was put on the 15-day disabled list. The Red Sox down 1–4 coming into the sixth, the game turned into wild roller coaster ride. Shields was pulled after allowing back-to-back walks with 0 outs, both runners eventually scored and Boston subsequently put a four spot on the board. Chicago re-took the lead in the seventh on a José Abreu three-run home run off of Junichi Tazawa and had the bases loaded with nobody out in the top of the eighth. Heath Hembree escaped the jam himself unscathed and with Boston scoring in the seventh and eighth, the game was tied going into the ninth. Despite a lead-off double by David Ortiz the game went into extra innings. In the top of the tenth, the White Sox again had the bases loaded with nobody out, and again the Boston pitcher responsible for his own mess, Craig Kimbrel, escaped unscathed. In the bottom of the tenth, two batters walked with a ground-out in-between, and Xander Bogaerts, leading the MLB in batting average, came through with a walk-off single, avoiding a rare four-game sweep.|$|E
2500|$|During the March 30, 1998 {{episode of}} Nitro, after {{defeating}} Marty Jannetty, Jericho {{pulled out a}} long pile of paper that listed each of the 1,004 holds he knew and recited them to the audience. Many of the holds were fictional, and nearly every other hold was an armbar. On the March 12, 1998 episode of Thunder, Malenko defeated a wrestler wearing Juventud Guerrera's mask {{who appeared to be}} Jericho. However, the masked wrestler was actually Lenny Lane, who Jericho bribed to appear in the match. This started a minor feud between Lane and Jericho after Jericho refused to pay Lane. At Uncensored, Jericho finally wrestled Malenko and defeated him, after which Malenko took a leave of absence from wrestling. Jericho then proceeded to bring with him to the ring a portrait of Malenko that he insulted and demeaned. Just prior to Slamboree, J.J. Dillon (referred to by Jericho as [...] "Jo Jo") scheduled a cruiserweight Battle Royal, the winner of which would immediately have a shot at Jericho's Cruiserweight Championship. Jericho accepted on the grounds that whoever he faced would be too tired to win a second match. At Slamboree, Jericho came out to introduce the competitors in an insulting fashion before the match started and then went backstage for coffee. An individual who appeared to be Ciclope won the battle royal after Juventud Guerrera shook his hand and then eliminated himself. The winner was a returning Malenko in disguise. Following one of the loudest crowd reactions in WCW history, Malenko proceeded to defeat Jericho for the championship. Jericho claiming he was the victim of a carefully planned conspiracy to get the belt <b>off</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> He at first blamed the WCW locker room, then added Dillon, Ted Turner, and finally in a vignette, he walked around Washington, D.C. with the sign [...] "conspiracy victim" [...] and accused President Bill Clinton of being one of the conspirators after being rejected from a meeting. Eventually, Malenko vacated the title. Jericho ended up defeating Malenko at The Great American Bash to win the vacant title after Malenko was disqualified after hitting Jericho with a chair. The next night, Malenko was suspended for his actions.|$|E
