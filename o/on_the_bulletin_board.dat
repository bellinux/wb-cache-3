The owner {{of the house is}} a widow named Blanche Devereaux (McClanahan), who was joined by fellow widow Rose Nylund (White) and divorcée Dorothy Zbornak (Arthur), after they both responded to an ad <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bulletin</b> <b>board</b> of a local grocery store a year {{before the start of the}} series. In the pilot episode, the three were joined by Dorothy's 80-year-old mother, Sophia Petrillo (Getty), after the retirement home where she had been living burned down.|$|E
500|$|The {{first game}} of [...] "Basket Ball" [...] was played in December 1891. In a {{handwritten}} report, Naismith described {{the circumstances of the}} inaugural match; in contrast to modern basketball, the players played nine versus nine, handled a soccer ball, not a basketball, and instead of shooting at two hoops, the goals were a pair of peach baskets: [...] "When Mr. Stubbins brot [...] up the peach baskets to the gym I secured them {{on the inside of the}} railing of the gallery. This was about 10 feet from the floor, one at each end of the gymnasium. I then put the 13 rules <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bulletin</b> <b>board</b> just behind the instructor's platform, secured a soccer ball and awaited the arrival of the class... The class did not show much enthusiasm but followed my lead... I then explained what they had to do to make goals, tossed the ball up between the two center men & tried to keep them somewhat near the rules. Most of the fouls were called for running with the ball, though tackling the man with the ball was not uncommon." [...] In contrast to modern basketball, the original rules did not include what is known today as the dribble. Since the ball could only be moved up the court via a pass early players tossed the ball over their heads as they ran up court. Also following each [...] "goal" [...] a jump ball was taken in the middle of the court. Both practices are obsolete in the rules of modern basketball.|$|E

2500|$|... "The Soap Memo" [...] {{was a rare}} public {{look into}} the behind-the-scenes process at a major network and copies of the {{document}} were often found posted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bulletin</b> <b>boards</b> of television production companies and on studio sets as a rallying point against censorship.

2500|$|While {{studying}} for her bachelor's degree in elementary education at Indiana University, {{she was a}} member of the Singing Hoosiers. Responding to an audition call [...] posted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bulletin</b> <b>board</b> at practice, she was thrilled to get a job singing commercial jingles and station breaks (one of her most notable commercial jingles was for the Red Lobster seafood restaurant chain, in which she sang their famous slogan, [...] "Red Lobster for the seafood lover in you"). Her parents insisted she return to school to finish her degree, which she did, and then headed to California to pursue a career. Returning to Nashville, she signed with the Lea Jane Singers, which marked the beginning of her commercial success.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout the {{rehearsal}} period, the New York newspapers {{were filled with}} articles about gang warfare, keeping the show's plot timely. Robbins kept the cast members playing the Sharks and the Jets separate in order to discourage them from socializing {{with each other and}} reminded everyone of the reality of gang violence by posting news stories <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bulletin</b> <b>board</b> backstage. Robbins wanted a gritty realism from his sneaker- and jeans-clad cast. He gave the ensemble more freedom than Broadway dancers had previously been given to interpret their roles, and the dancers were thrilled to be treated like actors instead of just choreographed bodies. As {{the rehearsal}}s wore on, Bernstein fought to keep his score together, as other members of the team called on him to cut out {{more and more of the}} sweeping or complex [...] "operatic" [...] passages. Columbia Records initially declined to record the cast album, saying the score was too depressing and too difficult.|$|E
2500|$|Following his {{departure}} in The Chase Ian Chesterton has been name-checked {{on a number}} of occasions in the series: He was mentioned by Vicki in episode one of The Time Meddler; by the first Doctor in episode four of The Massacre and again by his third incarnation on Spiridon in episode one of [...] "Planet of the Daleks". Ian was also mentioned in episode one of the 1993 Children In Need charity special Dimensions In Time and again in Death of the Doctor, a two part story in the fourth series of The Sarah Jane Adventures. After meeting Jo Grant and the Eleventh Doctor, Sarah Jane Smith reveals that she has researched the lives of some of the Doctor's earth-bound companions and discovered that Ian and Barbara have married each other, become professors, live in Cambridge and are rumoured to have not aged since the 1960s. In the 50th Anniversary Special [...] "The Day of the Doctor", the sign for Coal Hill Secondary School identifies the Chairman of the Governors as I. Chesterton. However, the Doctor's companion Clara Oswald, who was a teacher at Coal Hill School in the same episode, does not notice his photograph and name <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bulletin</b> <b>board</b> in UNIT's Black Archive when pausing over an adjacent photograph of Susan. In the spin-off series Class it was revealed in the episode Brave-ish Heart that the Board of Governors had been removed when the school was refurbished as an Academy.|$|E

60|$|While the yell {{was being}} given with a heartiness {{that might have}} {{endangered}} the roof, Elliott, with flushed face and sparkling eyes, pushed nearer to the important typewritten announcement <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bulletin</b> <b>board.</b> Yes, he had won the Fraser Scholarship. His name headed the list of seven competitors.|$|E
60|$|The tempter was not silenced {{so easily}} as that. Elliott passed a sleepless night of indecision. But {{next day he}} went to Marwood {{and asked for a}} private {{interview}} with the president. As a result, an official announcement was posted that afternoon <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bulletin</b> <b>board</b> to the effect that, owing to a misunderstanding, the Fraser Scholarship had been wrongly awarded. Carl McLean was posted as winner.|$|E

60|$|On {{the morning}} when the final results of all the {{examinations}} were to be posted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bulletin</b> <b>board</b> at Queen's, Anne and Jane {{walked down the street}} together. Jane was smiling and happy; examinations were over and she was comfortably sure she had made a pass at least; further considerations troubled Jane not at all; she had no soaring ambitions and consequently was not affected with the unrest attendant thereon. For we pay a price for everything we get or take in this world; and although ambitions are well worth having, they are not to be cheaply won, but exact their dues of work and self-denial, anxiety and discouragement. Anne was pale and quiet; in ten more minutes she would know who had won the medal and who the Avery. Beyond those ten minutes there did not seem, just then, to be anything worth being called Time.|$|E
