5|$|A German victory <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Battle</b> of Britain Day was unlikely. It {{could only}} have been {{possible}} if Park had made crass errors and had been caught on the ground. Stephen Bungay postulates that had the loss rates been reversed, Dowding could have replaced those with reinforcements from his C units and carried on. Moreover, during both major engagements Fighter Command had used less than ½ of its strength. It {{would have been able to}} meet the Luftwaffe again on the morrow.|$|E
5|$|A {{demonstration}} of the game was released on 26 June 2002, featuring tutorial missions and a full single-player mission. The game was released on 19 August in North America and on 30 August in Europe. The Creative Assembly released a patch on 5 November 2002, which was targeted to fix the several bugs that were still present in the game. A new historical battle based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Battle</b> of Stamford Bridge was later released by The Creative Assembly, made available through Wargamer.|$|E
5|$|Ender's Game: Battle Room was {{a planned}} {{digitally}} distributed video game for all viable downloadable platforms. It was under development by Chair Entertainment, which also developed the Xbox Live Arcade games Undertow and Shadow Complex.

5|$|In Iceland, {{where the}} kings' sagas {{continued}} to be copied and studied, the battle exercised the imagination of several poets. A 15th century rímur cycle, Svöldrar rímur, chronicles the battle in verse, largely following the account of Oddr Snorrason. Two more rímur cycles on the same topic were composed in the 18th century, {{one of which is}} preserved. In the 19th century, the popular poet Sigurður Breiðfjörð composed yet another rímur cycle <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>battle,</b> based on the account in Mesta.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the military personnel involved in the fighting, several Australian war correspondents reported <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Battle</b> of Normandy. Chester Wilmot landed with the 6thAirborne Division on D-Day, and his coverage of the fighting for the BBC soon {{made him one of}} the best-known Allied war correspondents. Other Australian journalists in Normandy included John Hetherington, Geoff Hutton and Ronald Monson.|$|E
5|$|Odin Sphere is a {{two-dimensional}} (2D) side-scrolling action role-playing game where the player takes control of five different characters across six playable scenarios. Areas within levels are circular stages allowing movement {{left or right}} with exits leading to other areas; the main goal in each area is to eliminate all enemies and proceed to the next area. Combat—which uses a beat em up-style battle system—takes place within these areas, and revolves around the player character {{using a combination of}} physical attacks and Psypher skills, skills tied to each character's magical weapon. Combination attacks are triggered by attacking enemies continuously. Jumping can be used to reach airborne enemies within stages. At the end of each battle, grades are awarded based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> time, damage taken from enemies, and the amount of damage dealt. The amount of in-game currency the player receives as a reward after each battle depends <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> grade.|$|E

Marking the occasion, former President of the United States Dwight D. Eisenhower commented that [...] "no other battlefield presented such a horrible sight of death, hell, and total destruction."

5|$|On September 28, 1862, Gwyn sent {{a letter}} to Colonel Barnes stating that the 118th Regiment did not provide the Philadelphia Inquirer with {{information}} that the paper used to publish a map and a report of the incident. Two days later, Gwyn issued a report <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Battle</b> of Shepherdstown, noting the efforts he made to rally troops to fight back against the Confederate troops, though his efforts were in vain, as Colonel Barnes ordered to regiment to fall back.|$|E
5|$|The Serbian {{patriotic}} song March on the Drina {{was written}} by Serbian composer Stanislav Binički shortly after the battle to commemorate the victory. Binički dedicated the march to his favourite commander in the army, Colonel Stojanović, who was killed during the fighting. A Yugoslav war film also titled March on the Drina was released in 1964 and is loosely based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>battle.</b>|$|E
5|$|The poem is {{included}} in the Anglo-Saxon Poetic Records. The now-accepted standard edition of the poem is the 1938 edition by Alistair Campbell.

It is sited <b>on</b> <b>the</b> summit of Hill 262, where the pocket was officially closed on 21 August 1944, with two sites - an open-air monument at the hill's summit (overlooking the vallée de la Dives and the plain where the last phases of <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> played out), which was inaugurated in 1965 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>battle's</b> twentieth anniversary, and the museum itself, {{in the side of}} the hill, opened in 1994 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>battle's</b> fiftieth anniversary.|$|R

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the race, {{all eyes}} were <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> for third place, as Häkkinen's pace was so slow that Karl Wendlinger was {{catching}} him in the Sauber, aiming to give Sauber their first podium finish. However, Häkkinen was able to resist Wendlinger's challenge and finish in third place, with Wendlinger fourth. Ukyo Katayama finished fifth for Tyrrell and Hill was able to battle back to finish sixth, the last of the points-scorers.|$|E
5|$|With the 19th century rise of {{nationalism}} and romanticism {{and the growing}} number of translations of the sagas, interest in the battle of Svolder increased outside of Iceland. Around 1830, the Faroese poet Jens Christian Djurhuus composed a ballad <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> titled Ormurin langi, following Snorri's account. The ballad was well received and remains among the most popular and well-known Faroese ballads. In 2002, a heavy metal version by the band Týr gained some following abroad.|$|E
5|$|After the Battle of Chunuk Bair, {{while his}} bravery was not questioned, Malone {{initially}} {{came in for}} criticism of {{his handling of the}} defences, particularly the placement of his defence trenches. In the planning for the battle, and earlier in the Gallipoli Campaign, he had clashed with Major Arthur Temperley, Johnston's brigade major. Temperley, a British Army officer like Johnston, was one of the foremost critics of Malone's defensive arrangements and may have unduly influenced the subsequent official reports <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>battle.</b> However, recent studies have demonstrated that this criticism was misplaced and {{there were a number of}} crucial failures higher up in the chain of command. In particular, Johnston's delay in getting reinforcements to Chunuk Bair once it was captured likely led to the failure to hold the gains made by Malone's battalion.|$|E

5|$|Crécy soup was eaten {{annually}} by King Edward VII, King of the United Kingdom between 1901 and 1910, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>battle's</b> anniversary day, {{in honour of}} his ancestor, Edward, the Black Prince, who led <b>the</b> <b>battle.</b> It has also been suggested that the soup was served to triumphant English soldiers after <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> concluded, using carrots from Crécy.|$|R
5|$|After this {{there was}} a lull in {{fighting}} in the Zadar area {{until the end of}} the month, with only sporadic small-arms fire and minor skirmishes. During that period, the JNA's efforts were concentrated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Battle</b> of Šibenik and an advance towards Sinj. Although the ZNG defended Šibenik and Sinj it lost Drniš, abandoning it before the JNA's arrival on 23 September. During the last week of September the JNA returned its focus to Zadar, stepping up its artillery bombardment of the city and ending its naval blockade on 23 September. On 29 September the JNA edged towards Zadar, capturing the villages of Bulić, Lišane Ostrovičke and Vukšić and announcing its intention to evacuate its Zadar barracks (which was affected by desertions).|$|E
5|$|At Ostend, Vindictive did prevent larger {{warships}} {{passing through}} the channel, although smaller craft could still come and go at will. The larger warships in Bruges were trapped there for the remaining months of the war; the town was captured by the Allies in October 1918. The blockages at Ostend and Zeebrugge took several years to clear completely, not being totally removed until 1921. On a strategic scale {{the effects of the}} raids at Ostend and Zeebrugge <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> of the Atlantic were negligible. Despite this, in Britain the Ostend Raid was feted as a success. Three Victoria Crosses and a host of lesser awards were given to the men involved. The Admiralty presented it as a fine example of daring and careful planning from the Royal Navy, providing a valuable morale boost at {{one of the most critical}} moments of the war.|$|E

5|$|Faulty {{intelligence}} was the component that was mostly {{responsible for the}} failure of Adlertag. While the gap between the British and Germans was not yet wide in this regard, the British were starting to gain a decisive lead in intelligence. The breaking of the Enigma machine and poor Luftwaffe signals discipline allowed the British easy access to German communications traffic. The impact of Ultra <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Battle</b> of Britain is a matter of dispute, with Official Histories claiming there was no direct impact. Whatever the truth, Ultra, and the Y service in particular, gave the British an increasingly accurate picture of German order of battle deployments.|$|E
5|$|For hand weapons, most Roman foot {{carried a}} thrusting-spear (hasta) and a sword (spatha). Among the Alamanni, spears were the {{universal}} weapon, swords were probably less common. Nobles (optimates) {{and the professional}} warrior-retainers of ringgivers certainly had them. For the lower ranks the position is not certain. Ammianus' report <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> implies that many in the Alamanni ranks carried swords. Those that did not were armed with a seax (long pointed Germanic knives with some types being shortswords) {{as well as a}} spear and/or battle axe.|$|E
5|$|In 753, {{when the}} Rashtrakutas {{replaced}} the Badami Chalukyas {{as the dominant}} force in the Deccan, the Gangas offered stiff resistance for about a century. King Shivamara II is mostly known for his wars with the Rashtrakuta Dhruva Dharavarsha, his subsequent defeat and imprisonment, his release from prison and eventually his death <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> field. The Ganga resistance continued through the reign of Rashtrakuta Govinda III and by 819, a Ganga resurgence gained them partial control over Gangavadi under King Rachamalla. Seeing the futility of waging war with the Western Ganga, Rashtrakuta Amoghavarsha I gave his daughter Chandrabbalabbe in marriage to Ganga prince Butuga I, son of King Ereganga Neetimarga. The Gangas thereafter became staunch allies of the Rashtrakutas, a position they maintained {{till the end of}} the Rashtrakuta dynasty of Manyakheta.|$|E
