40|$|Odour from {{meat chicken}} (broiler) farms is an {{environmental}} issue affecting the sustainable {{development of the}} chicken meat industry but is {{a normal part of}} broiler production. Odour plumes exhausted from broiler sheds interact with the environment, where dispersion and dilution of the odours varies constantly, especially diurnally. The potential for odour impacts is greatest when <b>odour</b> <b>emission</b> rates are high and/or when atmospheric dispersion and dilution of odour plumes is limited (i. e. during stable conditions). We continuously monitored ventilation rate, on-site weather conditions, atmospheric stability, and estimated odour concentration with an artificial olfaction system. Detailed inspection of <b>odour</b> <b>emission</b> rates at critical times, i. e. dawn, dusk and night time, revealed that maximum daily and batch <b>odour</b> <b>emission</b> rates are not necessarily the cause of odour impacts. Periods of lower <b>odour</b> <b>emission</b> rates on each day are more likely to correspond with <b>odour</b> impacts. <b>Odour</b> <b>emission</b> rates need to be measured at the times when odour impacts are most likely to occur, which is likely to be at night. Additionally, high resolution ventilation rate data should be sought after to improve <b>odour</b> <b>emission</b> models, especially at critical times of the day.

40|$|A {{study in}} {{experimental}} slatted-system fattening pig units {{was conducted with}} the aim of estimating the <b>odour</b> <b>emission</b> factor (in ou/s. pig), which can subsequently be used in dispersion models to assess the odour annoyance zone. Dynamic olfactometry measurements carried out at different development stages of pigs showed a logical trend of the mean predicted <b>odour</b> <b>emission</b> factor with the pig weight. However, the variation within the same weight class was much larger than variation between classes. Possible causes of such variation were identified as the evolution of ventilation rate during the day and the circadian rhythm of pig. To be able to monitor continuously the daily variation of the odour, an electronic nose was used with suitable regression model calibrated against olfactometric measurements. After appropriate validation check, the electronic nose proved to be convenient, as a complementary tool to dynamic olfactometry, to record the daily variation of the <b>odour</b> <b>emission</b> factor in the pig barn. It was demonstrated that, in the controlled conditions of the experimental pens, the daily variation of the <b>odour</b> <b>emission</b> rate could be mainly attributed to the sole influence of the circadian rhythm of pig.

An experiment was conducted with finishing pigs (n = 36) in a 2 × 3 factorial randomized complete block arrangement with 6 treatment combinations in 6 blocks. There were 2 dietary CP levels (low 12 %; high 18 %) and 3 digestible FC levels: (low 95. 5; medium 145. 5; and high 195. 5 g/kg feed, as-fed basis). Pigs with an initial body weight (BW) of 57. 7 ± 2. 5 kg were penned individually in partly slatted floor pens. Faeces and urine of each pig accumulated in separate manure pits under the slatted floor. In the 6 th week of the collection period air samples were collected directly above the manure in each pit. Manure samples were taken for manure characteristics. Air samples were analyzed for odour concentration and for hedonic tone and odour intensity. Manure samples were analyzed for volatile fatty acids (VFA), indoles, phenoles, sulphurous compounds, ammonium, and total N concentrations. Dietary CP level and FC level did not affect <b>odour</b> <b>emission,</b> <b>odour</b> intensity and hedonic tone but their interaction affected <b>odour</b> <b>emission</b> at P = 0. 06. At a high dietary CP level, increased FC level decreased <b>odour</b> <b>emission,</b> while at a low CP level, increased FC level increased <b>odour</b> <b>emission</b> from pig manure.

First the hazardous volatile organic compounds emitted from the main odour sources were identified and quantified by chemical analysis. The Hazard Index (HI) was used to assess the toxicity associated with the emissions. The HI is the sum of the concentrations of the hazardous compounds weighted with their Reference Concentration (RfC). A RfC is the estimated continuous inhalation concentration at which people are unlikely to risk any deleterious effects during their lifetime. Atmospheric dispersion modelling was based on the Toxicity Emission Rate (TER) which, like the Odour Emission Rate (OER) conventionally used to quantify <b>odour</b> <b>emissions,</b> relates the HI with the air flow of an emission source; it is as a simple but effective method for the general characterization of toxic <b>odour</b> <b>emissions</b> in complex scenarios.

Odour Emission Factors (OEFs) {{can be developed}} in analogy with the emission factors defined for other chemical compounds, which relate the quantity of a pollutant released to the atmosphere to a given associated activity. Landfills typically represent a common source of odour complaint; for this reason, the development of specific OEFs allowing the estimation of <b>odour</b> <b>emissions</b> from this kind of source would be of great interest both for the landfill design and management. This study proposes an up-to-date methodology {{for the development of}} an OEF for the estimation of <b>odour</b> <b>emissions</b> from landfills, thereby focusing on the <b>odour</b> <b>emissions</b> related to the emissions of landfill gas (LFG) from the exhausted landfill surface. The proposed approach is an “indirect” approach based on the quantification of the LFG emissions from methane concentration measurements carried out on an Italian landfill. The Odour Emission Rate (OER) is then obtained by multiplying the emitted gas flow rate by the LFG odour concentration. The odour concentration of the LFG emitted through the landfill surface was estimated by means of an ad hoc correlation investigated between methane concentration and odour concentration. The OEF for the estimation of <b>odour</b> <b>emissions</b> from landfill surfaces was computed, considering the landfill surface as the activity index, as the product between the mean specific LFG flux emitted through the surface resulting from the experimental campaigns, equal to 0. 39  l/m 2 /h, and its odour concentration, which was estimated to be equal to 105 ′ 000 eq. ouE/m 3, thus giving an OEF of 0. 011 ouE/m 2 /s.

40|$|Feedlots in Australia {{have long}} been {{associated}} with odour, and as such, in the early 1990 's research {{was carried out in}} order to better understand the processes driving the odour generation. Since that time, many practices have been identified as contributing to the odour problem, and feedlot management has changed to minimise the <b>odour</b> <b>emissions.</b> This has resulted in a distinct lack of <b>odour</b> <b>emissions</b> data relating to 'modern' feedlots. Feedlot pad surfaces represent the largest odour emitting source, however, after a rain- fall event, the <b>odour</b> <b>emissions</b> from the effluent ponds increase to a point where it may exceed that of the feedlot pad surface. Despite this, there has been little Australian research carried out to determine and predict the <b>odour</b> <b>emissions</b> from feedlot ponds after an inflow event. This project set out to develop a model to predict the odour emission rate from the effluent ponds at a feedlot after a significant inflow. Odour samples were collected every few days {{for a period of time}} after an inflow at two commercial feedlots in Southern Queensland and Northern New South Wales, and assessed to determine the odour emission rate. The collected data displayed a similar pattern of odour emission to that measured in the early 1990 's, reported by Casey et al (1997). At both feedlots, the odour emission rate from the primary holding pond rose quickly to a peak (454 and 578 ou/s. m 2) within 5 - 8 days, and then declined steadily back to 'normal' levels within 25 - 30 days. A model was developed to reproduce the pattern of <b>odour</b> <b>emissions</b> from the primary holding pond at each feedlot. The model is a two-stage empirical algorithm, and is dependent on the inflow ratio, the 24 hour average ambient temperature experienced during the days of the rainfall event and the number of days since the first day of the rain event. A parameter named 'Peak Day' defines the two stages of the model, and is read from a table developed from the measured temperature data. It is known that the pond condition does impact the odour emission rate (Hobbs et al, 1999); however the current body of research is not conclusive, and not enough pond condition data was collected during the course of the project to permit this model to include pond condition parameters as input. The model was tested with a number of hypothetical scenarios, and was also validated using the data collected by Casey et al (1997). The model was shown to be reasonably robust to moderate changes in parameter values, but failed to accurately reproduce the odour emission patterns measured in the earlier work. This was attributed to the different management practices of feedlots between the two data sets, and the simplistic nature of the model developed. The limited number of <b>odour</b> <b>emissions</b> data sets and supporting data meant that a comprehensive model could not be developed...|$|E

Many national and local regulatory agencies in the United States are considering biosolids disposal bans in their communities because of misinformation, poor science, and citizen pressure, but primarily because of odour impact concerns.

The <b>odour</b> <b>emission</b> factors were calculated to be equal to 4. 52 × 108 ouE t− 1 for process air, to 8. 02 × 107 ouE t− 1 for a mixture of process air and ambient air, and to 3. 53 × 103 ouE t− 1 for wastewater treatment tanks. Furthermore, the efficiencies of different odour abatement systems used for the treatment of different gaseous emissions from this kind of facility are evaluated and compared. The abatement efficiencies of the monitored odour reduction systems decrease passing from combustors (efficiencies over 99 %) to biofilters (efficiencies between 73 and 80 %) and scrubbers (efficiencies between 41 and 60 %) ...|$|R

An experiment was conducted with finishing pigs (n = 12) in a randomized complete block arrangement with 2 treatments of 12 and 15 % dietary CP in six blocks. The 2 diets were supplemented with essential AA up to the level of the animal's requirement. Pigs with an initial body weight (BW) of 57. 7 ± 0. 7 kg were penned individually in partly slatted floor pens. Faeces and urine of each pig accumulated in separate manure pits under the slatted floor. In the 3 rd week of the collection period, fresh faeces were collected for identifying fresh faeces characteristics and for assessing dry matter, organic matter, nitrogen (N), fat and non-starch polysaccharides digestibility using Cr 2 O 3 as a marker. In the 6 th week of the collection period, air samples were collected directly from each manure pit: one for odour, one for ammonia concentration and one for greenhouse gases. Afterwards the manure was mixed and a representative sample was taken for manure characteristic analysis. Odour samples were analyzed for odour concentration and for hedonic tone and odour intensity. Manure samples were analyzed for volatile fatty acids (VFA), indolic, phenolic, sulphurous compounds, ammonium and total N concentrations and pH. Reducing dietary CP level from 15 to 12 % did not affect <b>odour</b> <b>emission,</b> <b>odour</b> intensity and odour hedonic tone and greenhouse gaseous concentration (CH 4, CO 2 and N 2 O) (P > 0. 05) of odorous air above the manure pit. Reduced dietary CP level decreased manure pH (P < 0. 001), total N (P < 0. 001) and ammonium (P < 0. 001) concentrations and ammonia emission from pig manure (P = 0. 03). In addition, total VFA, acetic, propionic, iso-butanoic and iso-pentanoic acids, phenol, 4 -ethyl phenol and carbon disulfide concentrations in manure were decreased by reducing dietary CP level (P < 0. 05). We conclude that reducing dietary CP from 15 to 12 % did not reduce <b>odour</b> <b>emission</b> and greenhouse gaseous concentration; however, ammonia emission was significantly reduced...|$|R
