5|$|Bacteria exhibit an {{extremely}} {{wide variety of}} metabolic types. The distribution of metabolic traits within a group of bacteria has traditionally been used to define their taxonomy, but these traits <b>often</b> <b>do</b> not correspond with modern genetic classifications. Bacterial metabolism is classified into nutritional groups {{on the basis of}} three major criteria: the kind of energy used for growth, the source of carbon, and the electron donors used for growth. An additional criterion of respiratory microorganisms are the electron acceptors used for aerobic or anaerobic respiration.|$|E
5|$|Development of an endometrial {{hyperplasia}} (overgrowth of endometrial cells) is {{a significant}} risk factor because hyperplasias can and <b>often</b> <b>do</b> develop into adenocarcinoma, though cancer can develop without {{the presence of a}} hyperplasia. Within ten years, 8–30% of atypical endometrial hyperplasias develop into cancer, whereas 1–3% of non-atypical hyperplasias do so. An atypical hyperplasia is one with visible abnormalities in the nuclei. Pre-cancerous endometrial hyperplasias are also referred to as endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia. Mutations in the KRAS gene can cause endometrial hyperplasia and therefore Type I endometrial cancer. Endometrial hyperplasia typically occurs after the age of 40. Endometrial glandular dysplasia occurs with an overexpression of p53, and develops into a serous carcinoma.|$|E
5|$|Females become {{sexually mature}} at around {{three or four}} years of age and males at around five; however, males <b>often</b> <b>do</b> not {{successfully}} breed until a few years later. A captive male sired offspring at age 19. In the wild, sea otters live to a maximum age of 23 years, with average lifespans of 10–15 years for males and 15–20 years for females. Several captive individuals have lived past 20 years, and a female at the Seattle Aquarium {{died at the age of}} 28 years. Sea otters in the wild often develop worn teeth, which may account for their apparently shorter lifespans.|$|E

5|$|In {{countries}} where {{women have to}} do paid work in order to feed their family, {{there is a lack}} of regulation and safety standards regarding female workers due to the large amount of informal work available. In Thailand for example, due to the severe economic crisis in 1997, many women have jobs in the informal industry, and <b>often</b> <b>do</b> home-based work so that they can do their domestic jobs concurrently with their paid jobs. This increases the work intensity by women doing more than one job at a time, and has been shown to have deteriorating effects on women's health.|$|E
5|$|Interstate, U.S., {{and state}} routes have {{maintenance}} road numbers that <b>often</b> <b>do</b> not match their signed route numbers. For instance, DE 261 in New Castle County is designated as Road 203. In Sussex County, several state routes largely have matching maintenance road numbers; for example, {{the entire length}} of DE 24 is designated Road 24. Some routes in Sussex County have maintenance road numbers that reflect former route designations; an example is the section of US 9 between Laurel and Georgetown which is designated Road 28, reflecting the former DE 28 designation along this stretch of road.|$|E
5|$|Not all ticks in an infective {{area are}} {{infected}} with pathogens, and both attachment of the tick and a long-feeding session seem to be necessary for transmission of these diseases to take place. Thus tick bites <b>often</b> <b>do</b> not lead to infection, especially if the ticks are removed within 36 hours. Adult ticks can be removed with fine-tipped tweezers or proprietary tick removal tools, disinfecting the wound. It is also possible to freeze them off with a medical wart remover. If the tick's head and mouthparts break off during removal, they can be removed with tweezers like a splinter.|$|E

5|$|Parallel {{computing}} {{is closely}} related to concurrent computing—they are frequently used together, and often conflated, though the two are distinct: it is possible to have parallelism without concurrency (such as bit-level parallelism), and concurrency without parallelism (such as multitasking by time-sharing on a single-core CPU). In parallel computing, a computational task is typically broken down in several, often many, very similar subtasks that can be processed independently and whose results are combined afterwards, upon completion. In contrast, in concurrent computing, the various processes <b>often</b> <b>do</b> not address related tasks; when they do, as is typical in distributed computing, the separate tasks may have a varied nature and often require some inter-process communication during execution.|$|E
5|$|Stylistically, it is {{characterized}} by its innovative syntax and the frequent paratactic use of multiple subjects, objects, and verbs in a single sentence without conjunctions or punctuation to separate them. Structurally, it consists of nine books that, because of the immense time span, <b>often</b> <b>do</b> not share common characters or settings; the third-person narrative voice, which has been likened to that of an anonymous chronicler, does not pass judgment on the events or provide commentary that would help tie events together.|$|E
5|$|Those {{who engage}} in self-harm face the {{contradictory}} reality of harming themselves {{while at the same}} time obtaining relief from this act. It may even be hard for some to actually initiate cutting, but they <b>often</b> <b>do</b> because they know the relief that will follow. For some self-harmers this relief is primarily psychological while for others this feeling of relief comes from the beta endorphins released in the brain. Endorphins are endogenous opioids that are released in response to physical injury, act as natural painkillers, and induce pleasant feelings and would act to reduce tension and emotional distress. Many self-harmers report feeling very little to no pain while self-harming and, for some, deliberate self-harm may become a means of seeking pleasure.|$|E

5|$|During the state's early history, vetoes were seldom {{employed}} by governors primarily {{because they were}} seen as only symbolic since the General Assembly could override them with only a simple majority. Governor James Whitcomb {{was the first to}} make significant use of the power and vetoed a record of fifteen bills during a single legislative session. Roger Branigin, who presided over a hostile legislature, made the most total vetoes of any governor, returning a total of one hundred bills to the assembly. Despite the fact that vetoes are easily overridden, only around ten percent of vetoed bills are overridden. During the 1970s, for example, 117 bills were vetoed, but only eleven were overridden. Observers and historians attribute this to the short length of legislative sessions, which <b>often</b> <b>do</b> not allow enough time for a large number of bills to pass through both houses twice. Another factor is that legislators of the same party as the governor typically refuse to override his veto, even in cases where they supported the bill originally.|$|E
5|$|Male horn {{development}} {{has been linked to}} sexual selection, Horns are small spikes in the monogamous duikers and other small antelopes, whereas in the polygynous, they are large and elaborately formed (for example in a spiral structure, as in the giant eland). Thus, to some extent, horns depict the degree of competition among males in a species. However, the presence of horns in females is likely due to natural selection. The horns of females are usually smaller than those of males, and are sometimes of a different shape. The horns of female bovids are believed to have evolved for defence against predators or to express territoriality, as nonterritorial females, which are able to use crypsis for predator defence, <b>often</b> <b>do</b> not have horns. Females possess horns only in half of the bovid genera, and females in these genera are heavier than those in the rest. Females use horns mainly for stabbing.|$|E
5|$|Otters are {{the only}} marine animals {{that are capable of}} lifting and turning over rocks, which they <b>often</b> <b>do</b> with their front paws when searching for prey. The sea otter may pluck snails and other organisms from kelp and dig deep into {{underwater}} mud for clams. It is the only marine mammal that catches fish with its forepaws rather than with its teeth. Under each foreleg, sea otters have a loose pouch of skin that extends across the chest which they use to store collected food to bring to the surface. This pouch also holds a rock that is used to break open shellfish and clams, an example of tool use. The sea otters eat while floating on their backs, using their forepaws to tear food apart and bring to their mouths. Marine otters mainly feed on crustaceans and fish.|$|E

5|$|The Jain {{concept of}} Ahimsa is characterised by several aspects. It {{does not make}} any {{exception}} for ritual sacrificers and professional warrior-hunters. Killing of animals for food is absolutely ruled out. Jains also make considerable efforts not to injure plants in everyday life as far as possible. Though they admit that plants must be destroyed {{for the sake of}} food, they accept such violence only inasmuch as it is indispensable for human survival, and there are special instructions for preventing unnecessary violence against plants. Jains {{go out of their way}} so as not to hurt even small insects and other minuscule animals. For example, Jains <b>often</b> <b>do</b> not go out at night, when they are more likely to step upon an insect. In their view, injury caused by carelessness is like injury caused by deliberate action. Eating honey is strictly outlawed, as it would amount to violence against the bees. Some Jains abstain from farming because it inevitably entails unintentional killing or injuring of many small animals, such as worms and insects, but agriculture is not forbidden in general and there are Jain farmers.|$|E
