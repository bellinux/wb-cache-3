5|$|After the tournament, Miceli asked WWF {{management}} {{to bring in}} new women for her to wrestle. In mid-1994, Bull Nakano joined the WWF roster and began feuding with Blayze. Blayze defeated Nakano at SummerSlam, but lost the belt to her on November 20, 1994 in Japan at the Big Egg Wrestling Universe event. Five months later on April 3, 1995, Blayze regained the title from Nakano on an edition of Monday Night Raw. As part of the storyline, immediately following the win, she was attacked by Bertha Faye, who broke her nose. According to Rhonda Sing (Faye), the storyline was written so Miceli could take time <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> breast implants and a nose job. She returned to the ring in August 1995, losing the Women's Championship to Faye at SummerSlam on August 27. Two months later, she won the title a third time, defeating Faye on October 23.

5|$|Over {{the course}} of this tour, My Chemical Romance dubbed {{themselves}} The Black Parade for the first part of their performance, convincing many concert goers that The Black Parade was initially a separate, opening band. During the tour there were several cancellations and some members left the tour for personal or medical reasons. Leading up to their tour date at The DCU Arena, many of the staff members of the tour fell ill with food poisoning. The band Circa Survive had to replace Muse, members of which also suffered from the same food poisoning. On January 11, 2007 Frank Iero left the tour because of an unspecified illness. He was replaced by Drive By guitarist Todd Price. Mikey Way took time <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> married and spend time with his new wife (Alicia Simmons) and was replaced by guitar tech, Matt Cortez, from April 18, 2007 until October 4, 2007. Six shows were cancelled from April 29, 2007 to May 4, 2007 after the band and crew contracted food poisoning. Bob Bryar suffered injuries relating to his wrists during the tour which led to the cancellation of the show at the University of Maine on October 27, 2007. Bryar left the tour on November 9, 2007 and was replaced by a friend of the band, Wagner, who wished to remain anonymous. Following the November 11, 2007 show in Newcastle, Frank Iero left the tour to return home after learning about a family member's illness. He was replaced by Matt Cortez.|$|E

25|$|It {{was said}} that the 1929–30 season would be a make-or-break one. The team responded to the pressure. Under Harry Evans' guidance, Blackpool were crowned Division Two champions, their only League title to date, and reached the top flight {{for the first time}} in their history. The team held their nerve in the {{important}} run-in, including a victory at fellow title-challengers Oldham Athletic in front of a crowd of over 45,000. Blackpool claimed the title on the final day of the season, 3 May, with a goalless draw at Nottingham Forest. Runners-up Chelsea could have won the title themselves the same afternoon if they had won and Blackpool had lost, but the Londoners were defeated at Bury by a single goal. Jimmy Hampson's 45 League goals (the most in the country that season) was a Blackpool record for a single season, and still stands as such. In addition, the final points tally of 58 was equalled only once more before the three-for-a-win points system was introduced in 1981–82. For his part, Hampson wanted to avoid the spotlight and sneaked <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the train home from Kirkham to avoid the fans who had gathered to welcome the team at Blackpool North.|$|E

Though the character's first name was never {{mentioned in the}} novels, the character is given the first name [...] "Quirinus" [...] in the official Harry Potter Trading Card Game. Quirrell is the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts during Harry's first year and secretly a Death Eater.

Rowling stated in a live web chat on 30 July 2007 that Quirrell had worked at Hogwarts as Muggle Studies teacher for a certain length of time, before taking the cursed Defence Against the Dark Arts position in the same year that Harry joined. There were rumours that he encountered vampires in the Black Forest and one in Romania, and he apparently had [...] "a nasty bit of trouble with a hag". After that, he was 'never the same' – upon his return, he appears perpetually nervous and has developed a stutter and nervous tics [...] and Hagrid was able to say even before the beginning of the autumn term that he was [...] "scared of the students, scared of his own subject". Quirrell's attire includes a new purple turban which he claims to have received as a reward from an African prince for getting rid of a troublesome zombie.
