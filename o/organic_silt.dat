The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the source, uptake, and toxicity of Ni by periphyton and macroinvertebrates (Hyalella azteca and Daphnia magna) in simulated stream ecosystems that included sediment and water. Periphyton were exposed to two types of sediment, a low-organic sandy mixture and a high <b>organic</b> <b>silt,</b> treated with varying levels of Ni. After 96 h, Ni levels in overlying water and periphyton were related to those in sediments, although differences existed between sediment types.

Aqueous uptake, as opposed to dietary accumulation from periphyton, was the dominant pathway of Ni assimilation by the macroinvertebrates.

40|$|The ground {{conditions}} in the Terryland River Valley area present considerable site development challenges to geotechnical engineers. The soft soil formation consists of peat overlying very soft, highly compressible calcareous silt overlying slow draining <b>organic</b> <b>silts</b> and inorganic clays.

Synchronous changes, occurring in pollen from snow-bed vegetation, the alga Pediastrum, chironomids, and grain-size composition, point to a climatic change interpreted as cooler or shorter summers that led to prolonged ice-cover on the lake. According to palynological results the sediments date back to at least the early 15 th century A. D., with the cooling phase encompassing the period between late 16 th and the mid- 19 th century thus coinciding with the Little Ice Age. Low concentrations of both chironomid head capsules and cladoceran remains in combination with results from fossil pigment analyses point to longer periods of bottom-water anoxia {{as a result of}} long-lasting ice-cover that prevented mixing of the water column.

Location: Riverine wetlands in the floodplain of the Ain River, France. Methods: Eighteen sampling units were defined, set over three sediment types: gravel-dominated coarse sediment, silt and organic matter-dominated sediment. For each sediment type, three sampling units were permanently aquatic, and three sampling units underwent summer dewatering. A survey of species cover was conducted in each sampling unit at four times: before summer dewatering, {{at the beginning of}} the event, at the end of the event and 2 months after rewet- ting. Community resistance and resilience were assessed, as were changes over time in the proportions of species according their water affinity (hydrophytes, amphiphytes and helophytes, documented from the floras), and the effect of dewatering on species renewal and richness. Results: The sediment type affected aquatic plant community resistance and resilience, with increasing disturbance intensity for silty, followed by coarse compared with organic sediment. Organic sediment retained water efficiently during dewatering, supporting high community resistance, with the mainte- nance of amphiphytes and more tolerant hydrophytes. On silty sediment, disturbance was sufficiently high to cause the disappearance of hydrophyte vegetative parts, but propagules rapidly sprouted after rewetting, suggesting their preservation in the sediment and enabling good community resilience. On coarse sediment, a decrease in resident amphiphyte abundance, together with helophyte colonization and maintenance after rewetting were observed. Coarse sediment is not favourable to propagule survival, explaining the low community resilience.

In this paper, delta N- 15 -NO 3 - and multi-tracers {{were used to}} identify the origin and fate of NO 3 - in groundwater of the Baiyangdian lake watershed, North China Plain. The investigation was conducted in two typical regions: one is the agricultural area located in the upstream of the watershed and another is the region influenced by urban wastewater in the downstream of the watershed. Results indicate that the high NO 3 - concentrations of the upstream shallow groundwater were sourced from fertilizer and manure or sewage leakage, whilst the mixture and denitrification caused the decrease in the NO 3 - concentration along the flow path of the groundwater. In the downstream, industrial and domestic effluent has {{a great impact on}} groundwater quality.

40|$|The {{sedimentary}} {{succession of}} the West Runton Freshwater Bed (WRFB) is described and interpreted. The sediments represent a fluvial valley floor accumulation that trends west- to east, subparallel {{to the modern}} cliffline. Stabilisation of the stream channels was initially followed by deposition of fine-grained silt in standing water, punctuated by intermittent flood events. Decreased flood intensity resulted in vertical accretion of fine-grained, organic, fossiliferous sediments in carbonate-rich spring water. Increased organic deposition produced a transition to black detrital sediment. Periodic flooding continued, but flood frequency decreased in response to reduction in accommodation. Local erosion of channel banks and floors also occurred. The sediments were disturbed by water-release structures and bioturbation, the latter resulting from large mammals locally entering the channel and pools, churning the deposits during walking, bathing and so on. River-flow velocity diminished later as forest vegetation stabilised catchment and valley-floor ground surfaces. Stabilisation of the channel led to deposition from low-velocity flowing and standing water. The uppermost part of the succession indicates vertical accretion, sheet-like deposition. The <b>organic</b> <b>silts</b> were deposited in an anoxic environment, and organic sulphur from rotting organic matter allowed formation of early diagenetic sulphides. Deposition began during the late-glacial (Beestonian Stage) and continued into {{the first half of}} a temperate-climate, interglacial event (the Cromerian Stage s. s.). The infill comprises an overall finingupward sequence, the stream adopted a stable meandering pattern. The WRFB stream showed typical chalk-stream behaviour.

40|$|Lake Télé has {{a nearly}} perfect {{ellipsoidal}} shape and {{is surrounded by}} swamps and barely penetrable flooded forests {{in the heart of}} the Congo-Zaïre watershed basin, and has intrigued the international scientific community for decades. In June 1992, a first Franco-Congolese multidisciplinary scientific expedition was finally able to reach the lake which is vast (23 km 2) and shallow (3 m). Its volume is estimated at 71 000 000 m 3 and is 40 % filled with an <b>organic</b> <b>silt</b> layer a metre thick. Its hydrological exchanges are almost exclusively vertical with very little lateral contribution from the surrounding swamp. This leads to the observation that the waters are very slightly mineralized (< 3 mg/l), but are very rich in organic carbon (44 % of suspended matter and of total dissolved matter) and are very acidic (pH < 4). In addition, a magnetic anomaly of some hundred nanoTesla from a magnetic body at shallow depth has been detected in the lake's northern half, although its origin remains unknown. Botanical and palynological observations suggest the persistence of a strongly hydromorphic forest environment for at least the last 6600 years. Identified pollen taxa, whether ancient or recent, come mainly from pioneer and colonizing taxa such as #Macaranga$, which tends to indicate that the forest is continuing to gradually fill in the lake.

40|$|AbstractIn Swedish practice, {{there is}} a long {{tradition}} of evaluating undrained shear strength from fall-cone tests and field vane tests. During the last 20 years cone penetration tests have also become widely used. However, the results from all these test methods have to be evaluated using empirical factors. The factors generally used for Swedish clays are related to liquid limit and overconsolidation, but they are not applicable to all types of fine-grained soils and can often be improved by local calibration for the particular type of soil in the area of current interest. For this calibration, the results of direct simple shear tests and/or triaxial tests in the laboratory are normally used. This paper presents an evaluation for Swedish fine-grained sulphide soils, for which a general correction factor of 0. 65 for field vane tests and fall-cone tests, a cone factor Nkt of 20. 2 for cone penetration tests and a relation cu,DSS/(σ′cOCR− 0. 2) of 0. 28 have been found. No correlations were found between these empirical factors and the clay content, liquid limit or organic content, but a relationship was found between the overconsolidation ratio and both the cone penetration test and the field vane test. The sulphide soils in question are found in northern Sweden along the coast of the Gulf of Bothnia.

Over the past 10 years, however, stacked rings have become more popular and are now the dominant confinement system sold and used in the United States. Despite this change, no comprehensive testing program comparing both confinement methods has been published. The objective of this thesis is to perform a laboratory testing program to compare the results of using stacked rings and wire reinforced membranes as a confining system for direct simple shear tests. Tests were performed on samples of a high plasticity clay from the Gulf of Mexico, a low plasticity <b>organic</b> <b>silt</b> from Rhode Island, and a low plasticity sensitive clay from Portland, Maine. All soils were tested using both confinement types, with the only difference being the use of stacked rings or the wire reinforced membrane. Measured values of undrained shear strength for both normally consolidated and overconsolidated samples were very similar using both confining systems. Samples confined with the wire reinforced membrane exhibited more strain softening beyond the peak strength and more vertical strain to the effective consolidation stress than samples confined with stacked rings. These results show that both confining systems can be used with confidence for determination of the undrained shear strength. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} Pleistocene {{deposits}} with different lithology is present where the Olza River flows {{out from the}} Carpathian foothills to the Oświęcim Basin. The deposits are mostly composed of gravels forming several series of different ages, which are intercalated with much finer silts and sands as well as <b>organic</b> <b>silts.</b> A complex of glaciogenic deposits is also found as {{a thin layer of}} till, glaciolacustrine and glaciofluvial sediments. Loess-like deposits occur in the top part of the section under study. Gravels were deposited in the zone of a fore-mountain fan. The co-occurrence of lithologically different deposits reflects a great variability of sedimentation conditions, which depended mostly on climate changes. However, the formation of fan was also controlled by other factors. Neotectonic movements probably {{played an important role in}} its evolution. In this paper, we describe the successive stages of fan development and the factors determining this process. The interpretation is based on the analysis of deposits exposed in the eastern part of the fan, at the Kończyce site. The fan of the Olza River was built up with alluvia mostly during successive glaciations. It was dissected towards the end of each glaciation. During interglacials the fan was only slightly transformed. A special period of fan development occurred during glaciation when the ice sheet advanced on the fan surface. The aggradation of the fan was probably stopped due to uplift of the area. Then, aeolian loess-like deposits started to accumulate on a considerable part of the fan surface. Former opinions about the stratigraphy of the fan deposits are strongly diversified. Precise age of the successive series is still difficult to establish. In the light of contemporary studies, it can not be excluded that age of the Olza fan might be younger than previously suggested...|$|R

40|$|The town of Como (N Italy) {{was founded}} in 59 BC {{on the shores of}} the homonymous lake. Its present-day {{environmental}} setting derives from the interactions between lacustrine, alluvial and human dynamics. The lake coastline moved through time because of alluvial progradation, town expansion and land reclamation. Since 1700 AD, more than 200 m of land reclamation towards the North are observed from historical maps of the study area. The harbor is a strategic infrastructure for a coastal town and its localization is a critical issue. Archaeological evidence found in the Como urban area points to a different position of the harbor during the Roman period and the Middle Ages; presently, those areas are buried below several meters of sediments due to land subsidence and the artificial filling of coastal areas. The results of a geoarchaeological study aimed at understanding the evolution of the coastal area are presented here. Adopted methodologies include the collection of available archaeological and stratigraphic data and the analysis of a number of continuous core drillings both on the lake promenade and, {{for the first time in}} Como, on the lake bottom. Sedimentological and geotechnical investigations were performed and archaeological and vegetal findings were studied. A lithological unit consisting of <b>organic</b> <b>silts</b> rich in vegetal remains and archaeological findings has been identified.

Geological cross-sections and map reconstructions enable us to define different phases of the town evolution.

Of particular sedimentological importance are thermokarst lakes forming in late Pleistocene icy silt (yedoma), which dramatically alter the land surface by lowering surface elevation and redistributing upland sediment into lower basins. Our study provides the first description of yedoma thermokarst lake sedimentology based on the cross-basin sampling of an existing lake. We present lake sediment facies descriptions based on data from sediment cores from two thermokarst lakes of medium depth, Claudi and Jaeger (informal names), which formed in previously non thermokarst-affected upland yedoma on the northern Seward Peninsula, Alaska. We identify four prominent facies using sedimentological, biogeochemical, and macrofossil indicators: a massive silt lacking aquatic macrofossils and other aquatic indicators situated below a sub-lacustrine unconformity (Facies 1); two basal deposits: interbedded <b>organic</b> <b>silt</b> and chaotic silt (Facies 2 – 3); and a silt-rich mud (Facies 4). Facies 1 is interpreted as yedoma that has thawed during lake formation. Facies 3 formed adjacent to the margin due to thaw and collapse events from the lake shore. Material from Facies 3 was reworked by wave action to form Facies 2 in a medium energy margin environment. Facies 4 formed in a lower energy environment toward the lake basin center.

Foraminifera at all sites formed bipartite assemblages, where elevations below mean high higher water (MHHW) were dominated by Miliammina spp. and elevations between MHHW and the highest occurrence of foraminifera were dominated by Jadammina macrescens and Balticammina pseudomacrescens. Five high-diversity groups of diatoms were identified and they displayed pronounced variability amongst the study sites. Bulk-sediment geochemistry recognized two groups (clastic-dominated environments below MHHW and organic-rich environments above MHHW). As one group included subtidal elevations and the other included supratidal elevations, we conclude that the measured geochemical parameters are not stand-alone sea-level indicators. Core JT 2012 captured a regressive sediment succession of clastic, tidal-flat sediment overlain by salt-marsh <b>organic</b> <b>silt</b> and freshwater peat. The salt-marsh sediment accumulated at 2804 ± 52 years before present and preserved foraminifera (Jadammina macrescens and Balticammina pseudomacrescens) with good analogy to modern assemblages indicating that RSL was + 2. 60 ± 0. 47 m at this time. Diatoms confirm that marine influence decreased through time, {{but the lack of}} analogy between modern and core assemblages limited their utility as sea-level indicators. Geochemical parameters also indicate a reduction in marine influence through time. We conclude that RSL reconstructions derived from salt-marsh sediment preserved beneath Eurasian sub-Arctic peatlands can provide valuable insight into the spatio-temporal evolution of the Fennoscandian and Eurasian ice sheets...|$|E

The soils {{are characterized by}} <b>organic</b> and inorganic <b>silts,</b> <b>organic</b> and inorganic clays within the depth of subgrade. In contrast, [...] relationships shaped in this study indicates that, CPT (qc + fs) and DCP (qc) correlations are very much improved compared to other combinations studied in terms of higher coefficient of correlation and least transformation uncertainty. Deliberation of sleeve friction measurements resulted in minor improvement in of correlations and these may be considered insignificant. According to Roberson’s chart, {{the distribution of the}} CPT and DCP data obtained along the highway route encompasses four zones. Zone 4 (i.e., silt mixtures: clayey silt to silty clay), zone 5 (sand mixtures: silty sand to sandy silt), zone 6 (sands: clean sand to silty sand), and zone 8 (very stiff sand to clayey sand), with some scattered data points are located in the zone 9 (very stiff, fine-grained). Overall, it is seen that the statistical correlations developed from the vast data points can help the site and design engineers to have a clear idea about the stratigraphy of a particular location for taking appropriate planning and design steps of an intended infrastructure project to meet the requirements of sustainability.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{development of}} the paleolake Starowlany existing in the Eemian Interglacial (MIS 5 e) in north - eastern Poland. The lake history is based on Cladocera analysis. The paleolake Starowlany {{is located in the}} central part of the Sokółka Hills, approximately 9 km north of the town of Sokółka in the North Podlasie Lowland. The sediments studied filled a southern part of a tunnel valley formed during the Warta Glaciation. The coring was carried out with a geological drilling and constituted a part of the frame work aimed at preparing the Sokółka sheet for the Detailed Geological Map of Poland in scale 1 : 50000. The core was 7 m long. Peaty silt, peats and <b>organic</b> <b>silt</b> were present at the depth of 4. 0 - 6. 6 m, under deluvial sands, tills and silt. Organic series was over lain by a clayey silt with no glacial cover. Cladocera analysis was conducted with 20 samples from a depth interval 6. 6 - 4. 1 m. Remains of 17 species of Cladocera were found, representing the families: Chydoridae, Sididae and Bosminidae. A vast majority of them were the littoral species. In the paleolake Starowlany four development zones were distinguished that reflected changes as regards temperature, trophic levels and changes of water level in the lake. The paleolake existed from the early until the middle Eemian. The high est water level and the most favorable conditions for zooplankton development occurred in zones SCZ I and II. The highest trophic level took place in SCZ III (middle Eemian). In the late Eemian the water level dropped and the paleolake was transformed into a wetland. At certain points, the higher water level enabled existence of a few Cladocera species. The reasons for disappearance of the paleolake Starowlany included a local decrease in ground water levels as well as morphometric and geological characteristics of the lake...|$|E
40|$|The {{behaviour}} of both geosynthetic {{and steel}} strip reinforced embankments constructed on soft foundations is investigated using the finite element method.;The results of {{finite element analysis}} are shown {{to be in good}} agreement with the observed performance of a full-scale geogrid reinforced embankment constructed on a very soft deposit of peat and <b>organic</b> <b>silt.</b> Stage I construction was back-analyzed using information obtained from the program of field monitoring together with engineering properties of the soils obtained from laboratory tests.;Finite element analyses are used to study the effects of reinforcement such as high modulus geosynthetics and steel strips, on the undrained behaviour of embankments constructed on soft clayey foundations where the undrained shear strength and modulus increase with depth. It is shown how the response of the foundation soil in terms of shear strain is influenced by such factors as; (1) load level, (2) reinforcement modulus, (3) foundation soil modulus and (4) the presence of a higher strength surface crust in the foundation. The use of a suitable reinforcement may substantially reduce the magnitude of the foundation shear strains beneath the embankment. This is of practical significance where the foundation soil may be susceptible to strain softening and the selection of a suitable reinforcement may help to reduce the magnitude of shear strains under working conditions and hence improve stability. The implications of these results with regard to the selection of a limiting geosynthetic strain for use in conventional analysis methods are also discussed.;A nodal compatibility interface joint element which models the pullout behaviour of strip reinforcement is introduced. This interface joint element is incorporated in a finite element study of the behaviour of steel reinforced embankments constructed on soft clay foundations. It is shown that the amount of steel strip reinforcement provided significantly influences the behaviour of these embankments.;Finally, a closed form limit equilibrium method of analysis is proposed and based on comparison with rigorous finite element analyses, appears to provide a simple but reasonable estimate of the undrained stability of reinforced embankments on soft cohesive deposits...|$|E
40|$|This study {{addresses}} the Holocene sedimentary succession at Martinhal coastal lowland (Algarve), a site recording the AD 1755 Lisbon tsunami. Data on twenty-four short cores and sixteen trenches, retrieved {{from both the}} literature and new field work were combined to improve the stratigraphic resolution and lateral correlation of sedimentary units accumulated in this lowland. Four fining-upward depositional sequences (S 1 to S 4) were identified, showing spatial variation with maximum thickness - S 1 : 0 - 3 m; S 2 : 1. 0 - 2. 4 m; S 3 : 0. 2 - 1. 0 m; S 4 : 0. 3 - 2. 3 m. Sequences S 1, S 2 and S 3 consist of medium to coarse yellow sands with levels rich in bioclasts that give place upsequence to brown <b>organic</b> <b>silt</b> and clay. Sequences S 1 to S 3 testify to the progressive infilling of a small estuary, coeval with the progressive development and changes in efficiency of a sandy barrier. The uppermost sequence (S 4) is clearly different and also shows contrast in facies at seaward and landward locations. S 4 comprises: 1) seaward (ESE), a basal subunit with boulders to pebbly gravels and coarse to medium well sorted sands, interpreted as deposited by the AD 1755 tsunami, covered by an upper subunit comprising an alternation of well sorted white sands and brown silts, interpreted as aeolian/washover and flood deposits; 2) upstream (WNW), alternating layers of poorly sorted very coarse to medium sands and brown silts represent flood plain accretion and channel infill within the lowland. Quartz OSL dating was done by measuring small aliquots in samples from the AD 1755 event-layer and large aliquots in samples from other deposits. The coarser and more basal sediment of the AD 1755 sediment yielded overestimated OSL ages due to partial bleaching; at the top, and in finer sediment, {{and also in the}} more landward locations, OSL ages are closer to the true age of this event. At this location, routine Quartz OSL dating using large aliquots can give useful data on the burial ages for a variety of sediments, provided that the burial time exceeds ca. 1 ky. In contrast, recent abrupt-event sediments should be dated by measuring small aliquots or single grains to get a better control on partial bleaching effects on OSL results...|$|E
