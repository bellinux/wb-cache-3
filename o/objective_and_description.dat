Children are more overweight and obese, and social inequalities related to this topic are discussed among all societies. The purpose of the master thesis was to explore the association between the sociodemographic factors parental education and living arrangements and the availability and intake of selected food items and total energy intake and macronutrient intake among overweight and obese Norwegian children aged 6 - 10 years. The thesis {{is an extension of}} the theory that is used in the article. This thesis begins with an introduction, which further expands to the elaboration of childhood overweight and obesity occurrence, the causes of the childhood epidemic and further the consequences of childhood overweight and obesity and preventive actions. Further, the <b>objective</b> <b>and</b> <b>description</b> of method applied, the study population, recruitment process, data collection and statistical analysis is explained. Selected results will be presented {{in the first part of}} the thesis. Following this, a discussion of the selected results and the used methodology is presented.

40|$|Abstract—Logistics {{outsourcing}} is {{a growing}} trend and measuring its performance, a challenge. It must {{be consistent with the}} objectives set for logistics outsourcing, but we have found no objective-based performance measurement system. We have conducted a comprehensive review of the specialist literature to cover this gap, which has led us to identify <b>and</b> define these <b>objectives.</b> The outcome is that we have obtained a list of the most relevant <b>objectives</b> <b>and</b> their <b>descriptions.</b> This will enable us to analyse in a future study whether the indicators used for measuring logistics outsourcing performance are consistent with the objectives pursued with the outsourcing. If this is not the case, a proposal will be made for a set of financial and operational indicators to measure performance in logistics outsourcing that take the goals being pursued into account...|$|R

The EVA Development Flight Experiment (EDFE) <b>objectives</b> <b>and</b> equipment <b>description</b> are also presented. The EDFE consisted of three experiments conducted during STS- 37 to evaluate both designs of crew translation equipment and loads imparted by crew members while performing typical EVA work site tasks for Space Station Freedom. The experiments were used to evaluate static and dynamic loads and ease of operation of four separate translation systems operating on a fixed track. Various measures of performance of the crew equipment and translation aids are discussed. The rates and accelerations experienced during translation aided by the manipulator foot restraint and remote manipulator system {{were found to be}} comfortable...|$|R

30|$|To {{quantify}} {{the number of}} unique sources that included direct observations within each review, we counted every reference that contained observation-based information on fire. Our definition of “observation-based” was similar to Leidolf and Bissonette’s (2009) definition of “original research,” which includes empirical research {{as well as more}} casual field observations. We also counted the number of “fire experiments” found in the literature for each review, a subset of the count of unique sources. Fire experiments were defined as studies that provided information on fire conditions and fire behavior, and reported quantitative comparisons between burned and unburned, or prefire and postfire, communities. Fire experiments were singled out because they generally give a clearer, more <b>objective,</b> <b>and</b> complete <b>description</b> of fire <b>and</b> fire effects than less rigorous fire studies, so their results can more readily be compared with those of other fire experiments.|$|R
