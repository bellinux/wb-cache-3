5|$|After the debacles of the Schwarz era {{and brief}} {{control of the}} team by the CFL (see above) the Argos were rescued by David Cynamon and Howard Sokolowski in 2004. There was {{optimism}} surrounding the duo's arrival and attendance figures improved in their six years heading the organization. It was also appreciated that the two were Torontonians after a quarter-century of foreign and/or corporate ownership. But by 2010 losses were great enough that the team was again put <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>block</b> and eventually sold to David Braley. There was some controversy surrounding Braley's takeover. He is simultaneously owner of the BC Lions, raising questions of competitive integrity. It was also revealed that Braley had bankrolled half of Cynamon and Sokolowski's initial $2 million buy-in of the Argos in 2004, and covered half their subsequent losses, in exchange for half of the 2007 Grey Cup profits.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} Chicago Fire, the block {{was home to}} one of Chicago's largest theaters. During the late 19th century, tall office {{buildings}} proliferated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>block.</b> By 1970, the block was densely developed with 11 buildings, housing theaters, offices, a YMCA, and retailers like Stop & Shop, a grocer. On June 14, 1973, Mayor Richard J. Daley announced a broad urban renewal initiative centered on the North Loop theater district. Over the ensuing 16 years, numerous private developers, notably the Rubloff Company and JMB Realty, planned large mixed-use developments on the site, with a mall along State Street and hotels and office towers above. Property assembly was facilitated by Mayor Harold Washington's creation of the North Loop tax increment financing district in 1983, which gave the urban renewal effort a steady revenue stream and eminent domain authority.|$|E

5|$|Heavier {{suburban}} {{traffic on the}} Melbourne network saw a greater strain <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>block</b> working then used, which required {{a large number of}} manned signal boxes to enable trains to run close together. As a result, it was decided to adopt power signalling under the Automatic Block System (ABS) of safeworking, where the presence of trains automatically control the signals after them, providing a safe distance between trains. Introduced from 1915, the system was based on American speed signalling practice with GRS2A upper quadrant mechanical signals with two arms able to indicate up to 5 different speed aspects to train drivers. These signals were later replaced by colour light signals which are the standard today, but the old mechanical style remained until 2001.|$|E

5|$|Issues {{surrounding}} {{the planning and}} construction of L'Enfant Plaza (immediately {{to the west of}} the site) delayed construction of any buildings <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>block</b> until the late 1960s. In 1963, the RLA purchased the land from the Westminster Memorial Church, Fifth Baptist Church, and homeowners. The United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare wished to purchase the site for its new headquarters, but the RLA declined to sell the property. (The federal government does not pay taxes on land and structures it owns, and the RLA wanted a private owner who would add to the tax base.) The RLA attempted to sell the land on January 29, 1965, but there were no buyers.|$|E

5|$|Just {{after midnight}} on 3 January, 200 police {{officers}} from the City of London and Metropolitan forces cordoned off the area around 100 Sidney Street. Armed officers were placed at number 111, directly opposite number 100, and throughout the night {{the residents of the}} houses <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>block</b> were roused and evacuated. Wensley woke the ground floor tenants at number 100 and asked them to fetch Gershon, claiming that she was needed by her sick husband. When Gershon appeared she was grabbed by the police and taken to the City of London police headquarters; the ground floor lodgers also evacuated. Number 100 was now empty of all residents, apart from Svaars and Sokoloff, neither of whom seemed {{to be aware of the}} evacuation.|$|E
5|$|One change {{made during}} {{production}} was augmented pitch control to avoid deep stall conditions at high angles of attack. The stall issue {{had been raised}} during development, but had originally been discounted. Model tests of the YF-16 conducted by the Langley Research Center revealed a potential problem, but no other laboratory was able to duplicate it. YF-16 flight tests were not sufficient to expose the issue; later flight testing on the FSD aircraft demonstrated {{there was a real}} concern. In response, the areas of the horizontal stabilizer were increased 25% <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Block</b> 15 aircraft in 1981 and later retrofitted to earlier aircraft. In addition, a manual override switch to disable the horizontal stabilizer flight limiter was prominently placed on the control console, allowing the pilot to regain control of the horizontal stabilizers (which the flight limiters otherwise lock in place) and recover. Besides reducing the risk of deep stalls, the larger horizontal tail also improved stability and permitted faster takeoff rotation.|$|E
5|$|The {{draft was}} then {{transferred}} by pencil on white-primed panels of hardwood end grain. Not {{only was it}} hard work, but {{the quality of the}} printing block was crucial. Everything left white <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>block,</b> around Busch's drawn lines, was cut from the plate by skilled engravers. Wood engraving allows a finer differentiation than woodcut and the potential tonal values are of almost the quality of intaglio printing, such as copper engraving. Sometimes the result was not satisfactory, leading Busch to rework or reproduce plates. The wood engraving technique did not allow for fine lines, which is why Busch's drawing, especially in his illustrated tales up to the mid-1870s, are boldly drawn, giving his work its particular characteristic.|$|E

40|$|Skin {{potential}} activities (SPA) {{were used}} to assess the degree of sympathetic blockade after stellate ganglion <b>block</b> (SGB). <b>The</b> SPA were recorded bilaterally from the palmar thenar eminences in four outpatients before and after SGB. Before the SGB, the skin potential responses (SPR) on both sides were synchronous and their amplitudes were almost the same. After SGB, <b>the</b> SPR amplitude <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>blocked</b> side gradually fell from 1 - 2 minutes. Before SGB, the skin potential levels (SPL) on both sides were parallel and the lateral difference was constant. About 1 - 2 minutes after SGB, <b>the</b> SPL <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>blocked</b> side began to fall and then reached a stationary level 5 minutes after SGB. SPA variations due to factors other than peripheral blockade can be cancelled by bilateral recording. Thus, the net SPL decrease <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>blocked</b> side compared with that <b>on</b> <b>the</b> non-blocked side was proved to be a useful index for continuous, quantitative monitoring of the sympathetic blockade by the SGB...|$|R
5|$|With {{the success}} of his chain of bookstores, Wilkinson pursued other {{business}} ventures in the fields of real estate development, farming, transportation, banking, coal interests, and construction. He purchased several private aircraft to help him tend to his diverse interests throughout the state, and in 1973, created Wilkinson Flying Service to keep the planes busy when he wasn't using them. After investing in the unfinished Bluegrass Commerce Center in Lexington in early 1977, he purchased one-third interest in the Purcell building on Lexington's Vine Street later that year. The building was only partially occupied, but had become more valuable because of the opening of nearby Rupp Arena in October 1976 and a new Hyatt hotel in May 1977. Developers Donald and Dudley Webb developed plans to construct the Vine Center on the block; by May 1979, they had options to buy every property <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>block</b> except Wilkinson's interest in the Purcell building. Unwilling to meet Wilkinson's asking price, they instead formed a partnership with him to co-develop the Vine Center. When Wilkinson eventually sold his interest in the venture at the end of 1981, he turned a profit of at least $1.3 million on his investment. Next, he formed a public-private partnership with the city of Lexington to construct the Capital Plaza Hotel in 1983. The city provided $3 million in capital and another $8.5 million in guaranteed loans to supplement Wilkinson's $1.15 million investment. Wallace's Book Stores was given 95% ownership in the hotel, allowing the company to shield $2 million in assets from federal income taxes and claim over $400,000 in tax credits.|$|E
