Obstacles such as human <b>occupants,</b> <b>doors,</b> walls, windows, etc. all {{have a significant impact on}} received signals strengths and will contribute to fading, multipath and shadowing effects. This paper studies the effects of changes within a building, such as opening and closing doors, and the movement and number of human occupants, on indoor signal propagation at 5. 8 GHz.

500|$|The 2011 Chevrolet Volt {{standard}} {{features include}} 4-wheel anti-lock brakes with traction control; StabiliTrak electronic {{stability control system}} with brake assist; tire-pressure monitoring system; and 8 total airbags: dual-stage frontal, side-impact and knee for driver and front passenger, and roof-rail side-impact for front and rear outboard seating positions, with a passenger sensing system. There is also available an optional emergency assistance system. A safety cage, built with high-strength and ultra high-strength steel, surrounds the passenger compartment to keep the space intact {{in the event of}} a crash.

40|$|Understanding the {{characteristics}} of radio wave propagation {{is a very important}} task for ensuring the required signal coverage for indoor wireless communication systems. The received signal strengths are highly affected when blocked by obstacles such as human <b>occupants,</b> <b>doors,</b> walls, windows, etc. This thesis investigated the E-field distributions inside a Victorian terraced house. Many scenarios are presented to investigate some important elements that {{have a significant effect on}} E-field distributions, such as opening and closing doors, the movement and number of human occupants and the location of the transmitter. These are considered for indoor signal propagation at various frequencies, specifically 5. 8 GHz, 2. 4 GHz, 868 MHz and 433 MHz. The distribution of the E- field strength within the building has been obtained using the FEKO simulation suite. The methods used in the simulation are geometrical optics and the uniform theory of diffraction. The results demonstrate that when the transmitter is located near to a wall, then the field distributions within the Victorian house are attenuated due to more reflections and multipath effects. Also, the results show that the door’s status and human occupancy effect on the electric field coverage at 5. 8 GHz and 2. 4 GHz is more significant than at 868 MHz and 433 MHz. The practical results demonstrate that the radio signals can penetrate through several adjacent walls within the same floor, however they became very weak when they go through different floors. This indicates that the deployment and positioning of smart meters in domestic properties has to be carefully considered. Our results clearly prove that extensive E-field measurements should be performed prior to the deployment of wireless communication system within the building...|$|R
50|$|In {{the event}} {{emergency}} exits are required, the crash bar works efficiently {{to allow people}} to pass through security doors without a reduction in speed. A crash bar's fast-acting mechanism reduces the risk that a rushing crowd might suddenly become a logjam at the exits. Such a human stampede situation, which has many historical precedents, can cause falls, crushing, and other injury because the rear of a crowd has no idea that the people at the front of a crowd have come across a door.Crash bars are typically found on doors which are required emergency exits serving a particular type or quantity of occupants. Common locations include doors which provide egress from assembly areas, doors which serve many <b>occupants,</b> or <b>doors</b> serving hazardous areas. For buildings subject to the International Building Code, or a locally adopted variation, they are required for certain healthcare, education, or assembly spaces, generally related to the number of occupants exiting through a given door.|$|R

50|$|Side-impact airbags or side torso airbags (side thorax/abdomen airbags) are a {{category}} of airbag usually located in the seat or door panel, and inflate between the seat <b>occupant</b> and the <b>door.</b> These airbags are designed {{to reduce the risk}} of injury to the pelvic and lower abdomen regions. Most vehicles are now being equipped with different types of designs, to help reduce injury and ejection from the vehicle in rollover crashes.

40|$|In 1978, 345 {{persons were}} killed in the United States in jumps and falls from non-crashing motor vehicles: 64 per cent fell; 15 per cent jumped; and it was not known whether the other 21 per cent jumped or fell. Two hundred and one people had been {{traveling}} on the exterior of vehicles, especially truck beds, and almost all of these people fell from their vehicles.

Seventy-seven per cent of those who fell from passenger compartments were males, and 44 per cent were less than five years old. Among those who jumped from vehicle compartments, 62 per cent were women and all were older than 14 years. Fatal falls and jumps from vehicles could be reduced in a variety of ways. These include legislation to prohibit travel on vehicle exteriors, designing vehicles so that doors cannot be opened when in motion, improving door designs, installing signals that provide warning if doors are not closed completely, and using occupant restraints...|$|R

40|$|Side impact {{accidents}} {{against a}} tree or pole remain the most dangerous accident scenarios in rally cars. Statistical data shows that 52 % of the fatalities between 2004 and 2009 concern crashes against a rigid pole by the track sides, whilst among those more than 60 % were side impacts. Despite the present scientific efforts, rallying cars side impacts are still among the least understood primarily due to limited space between the <b>occupant</b> and <b>door</b> sill, evolving safety regulations and vehicle dynamics. In this study, finite element dynamic characteristics of the whole car were studied. The finite element model consisted of the whole car structure and 241 parts including the engines, tyres and the suspension members with 4 different element types and 7 material models. All structural parts were modelled as low-carbon steel with the piecewise- linear-plasticity material model (mat 24). The tyres were modelled with the Blatz-Ko rubber material (mat 07) whilst also rigid and other materials (mat 020, 01, 09, S 01 and S 02) were used to represent {{different parts of the}} model, as the suspension members, suspension links and the engine. A rollcage and two racing seats were modelled with four-node shell elements and the use of piecewise-linear-plasticity and composite-damage materials respectively. A semi- cylindrical pole of 200 mm diameter was also designed and modelled as a rigid body. The model was used to first investigate the dynamics of the crash, and later run a wide range of simulations and parametric studies in the cage, the car's floor and the seats. The important findings from the study are presented, conclusions drawn and scope for further development outlined...|$|R
40|$|Today most {{buildings}} {{are equipped with}} adequate fire safety systems. Nevertheless fires still occur, even fatal fires. During a fire, problems frequently arise because systems {{were put in place}} with false expectations regarding how occupants actually behave during fires. The observation that occupants tend to ignore the sound of the fire alarm in large public buildings such as shopping centres, museums or airports, continuing their normal activities should be taken into account. In office buildings, well designed fire doors have failed to fulfil their role because <b>occupants</b> have installed <b>door</b> stops to facilitate free movement in the everyday use of the building; thus {{in the event of a}} fire, the doors stay open. Many of these problems could be foreseen if more attention were given to human behaviour in fire. In addition, there are a number of other factors that could have an impact on occupant response and behaviour. These factors are related to the occupants characteristics, the building characteristics and the fire characteristics. Consideration should be given to the interplay of these factors to gain a better understanding of human behaviour in fire and to improve the design and implementation of fire safety systems in buildings...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Vehicle {{interiors}} are {{primary source}} of injuries when occupants interact {{with them in the}} event of an accident.

40|$|Although {{there have}} been {{tremendous}} improvements in crash safety {{there has been an}} increasing trend in side impact fatalities, rising from 30 % to 37 % of total fatalities from 1975 to 2004 (NHTSA, 2004). Between 1979 and 2004, 63 % of AIS≥ 4 injuries in side impact resulted from thoracic trauma (NHTSA, 2004). Lateral impact fatalities, although decreasing in absolute numbers, now comprise a larger percentage of total fatalities. Safety features are typically more effective in frontal collisions compared to side impact due to the reduced distance between the occupant and intruding vehicle in side impact collisions. Therefore, an increased understanding of the mechanisms governing side impact injury is necessary in order to improve occupant safety in side impact auto crash. This study builds on an advanced numerical human body model with focus on a detailed thoracic model, which has been validated using available post mortem human subject (PMHS) test data for pendulum and side sled impact tests (Forbes, 2005). Crash conditions were investigated through use of a modified side sled model used to reproduce the key conditions present in full scale crash tests. The model accounts for several important factors that contribute to occupant response based on the literature. These factors are; the relative velocities between the seat and <b>door,</b> the <b>occupant</b> to <b>door</b> distance, the door shape and compliance. The side sled model was validated by reproducing the crash conditions present in FMVSS 214 and IIHS side impact tests and comparing the thoracic compression, velocity, and Viscous Criterion (VC) response determined by the model to the response of the ES- 2 dummy used in the crash tests. Injury was predicted by evaluating VCmax, selected for its ability to predict rate-sensitive soft tissue injury during thoracic compression (Lau & Viano, 1986). The Ford Taurus FMVSS 214 and Nissan Maxima IIHS tests were selected from side impact crash test data found in the NHTSA database because they included factors not present in standard side impact test procedures. These factors were; the presence of door accelerometers used to provide input velocities to the side impact model and the use of a ES- 2 (rather than the SID) to facilitate comparison of VC response to the human body model. Also, the two crash test procedures (FMVSS 214 & IIHS) were selected to ensure accurate side impact model response to different impact scenarios. The side impact model was shown to closely reproduce the timing and injury response of the full-scale FMVSS 214 side impact test of a Ford Taurus, as well as the IIHS side impact test of a Nissan Maxima. The side impact model was then used to investigate the effects of <b>door</b> to <b>occupant</b> spacing, <b>door</b> velocity profile, armrest height, seat foam, restraint system, and arm position. It was found that the VCmax was controlled by both the first and second peaks typically found in door velocity profiles, but the effect of each varies depending on the situation. This study found that VCmax was reduced by 73 - 88 % when door intrusion was eliminated compared to the VC response incurred by an intruding door. Also, the presence of a deformable door based on physical geometry and material characteristics rather than a simplified rigid door reduced VCmax by 16 % in this study. The study on seat foam determined that significant effects on VC response can be made by modest adjustments in foam properties. Low stiffness seat foam was found to increase VCmax by 41 % when compared to the VC response when using high stiffness foam. Arm position has been proven to be a relevant factor in side impact crash. Positioning the arms parallel to the thorax, in the “down” position, caused a 42 % increase in VCmax when compared to the VC response determined with the arms positioned at 45 degrees. Finally, although restraint systems have limited influence on side impact crash safety compared to front and rear impacts, this study found that the presence of a pre-tensioning restraint system reduced VCmax by 13 % when compared to the VC response of an un-belted occupant. It {{should be noted that the}} current study was limited to velocity profiles obtained from a specific FMVSS 214 test and therefore results and observations are restricted to the confines of the input conditions used. However, the side impact model developed is a useful tool for evaluating factors influencing side impact and can be used to determine occupant response in any side impact crash scenario when the appropriate input conditions are provided...|$|R
40|$|Protection of {{children}} in Child Safety Seats (CSS) in side impact crashes has been a topic of recent studies. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the performance of CSS in far-side impacts through a series of sled tests conducted at varying test speeds. Forty eight sled tests were conducted at three speeds (24 km/h, 29 km/h and 36 km/h), under two different CSS attachment conditions (LATCH and seat belt attached), using rear facing and forward facing CSS from four different manufacturers. Analyses were conducted to examine head retention within the CSS, velocity of the head as it passes an imaginary plane (cross over into other <b>occupant</b> space or <b>door),</b> lateral trajectory of the head and knee; head, chest and pelvis accelerations; neck and lumbar loads and moments. In addition to these parameters, the CSS were visually inspected for structural integrity after each test. Results from these sled tests highlighted the differential performance of CSS in far-side impacts. During the tests, all CSS experienced significant lateral movement irrespective of attachment type. In rear facing CSS tests, one of the designs failed as the seat disengaged from its base. In forward facing CSS tests, it was observed that the seat belt attached CSS experienced less rotational motion than the LATCH attached CSS.

40|$|Euro NCAP {{continually}} examines and modifies its protocols {{to encourage}} the automotive industry to improve vehicles {{and the safety of}} occupants. The aim {{of this study is to}} identify the key differences between the past and current Euro NCAP protocols regarding side impact, in order to apply optimized countermeasures for fulfilling the new requirements in a previously designed vehicle. Outcomes from a possible Euro NCAP increase in crash speed from 50 km/h to 60 km/h were evaluated. The current protocol introduces the dummy WorldSID 50 th percentile and changes in the barrier. The changes in the dummy lead to a reduction in the distance between the <b>occupant</b> and the <b>door</b> panel, and the current geometry of the barrier causes the car’s structure, in particular the sill, to be additionally loaded. An increase in mass of the current barrier causes an increase in energy absorption, thus presenting different deformation patterns. With the updated protocol, the most critical anatomical areas observed in this research were the pelvis and the shoulder. Countermeasures in this study were especially focused on decreasing the load on these anatomical structures. The evaluated countermeasures were: - Sill and B-pillar geometric adaptation to better perform against the AE-MDB - Reduced stiffness of the door panel at the occupant impact location - Optimized door beam Finite Element Method (FEM) tools were used as the basis of this research, including validated and correlated models with experimental full car tests. Initially, the research started with FEM testing of the current vehicle according to both past and current Euro NCAP protocols. Pelvic biomechanical values reached the lower performance limits when testing the AE-MDB barrier at 50 km/h.

40|$|Mitigating {{injury in}} side impact {{has been an}} {{important}} topic of research for decades. In the mid 1980 ’s the American government began a program intended to improve the crashworthiness of vehicles in side impact. This program ultimately led to the introduction of a dynamic side impact test (Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 214), which new vehicles must pass, along with a very similar test aimed at consumer awareness (New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) side impact test). The work presented in this thesis involved the study and simulation of these tests to evaluate occupant response in side impact, with a focus on the thoracic response. In the first portion of the work presented here, an in-depth study of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) crash test database was performed. In this study the results of the side impact crash tests of 72 vehicles were examined to understand the general trends seen in this type of testing with regards to vehicle velocity, side intrusion, and occupant injury prediction. A series of average velocity profile curves was created from accelerometer data at 18 measurement points on each vehicle crash tested. Additionally the injury criterion measured by the front seat occupant was plotted against several vehicle variables (such as mass and <b>occupant</b> arm to <b>door</b> distance) to study the effect these variable had on the injury predicted by the occupant. No single variable was shown to have a strong correlation to injury, although increasing door intrusion distance, peak lateral velocity, the Head Injury Criterion (HIC), and pelvic acceleration were found to positively correlate to thoracic injury. In addition, increasing vehicle model year, vehicle mass, and arm to door (AD) distance showed negative correlations with thoracic injury. Following the survey of the NHTSA database, a finite element model of the NHTSA side impact test was developed. This model included a full scale Ford Taurus model, a NHTSA barrier model and three side impact anthropometric test device (ATD) occupant models, each representing a different 50 th percentile male dummy. Validation of this model was carried out by comparing the simulated vehicle component velocity results to the corridors developed in the NHSTA crash test database study as well as comparing these velocities, the vehicle deformation profile, and the occupant velocity, acceleration and rib deflection to several Ford Taurus crash tests from a similar vintage to the finite element model. As this model was intended as a ‘baseline’ case to study side impact and occupant kinematics in side impact, side airbags were not included in this model. A lack of experimental data and a lack of consensuses within the automotive crash community on the proper method of modeling these devices and their effectiveness in real world impacts also led to their exclusion. Following model validation, a parametric study was carried out to assess the importance of the initial position of the occupant on the vehicle door velocity profile and the predicted occupant injury response. Additionally the effect of the door trim material properties, arm rest properties and the effect of seat belt use were studied. It was found that the lateral position of the occupant had an effect on the door velocity profile, while the vertical and longitudinal position did not. The use of seatbelts was shown to have no significant effect in these simulations, due to minimal interaction between the restraint system and occupant during side impact. Furthermore, there was a general decreasing trend in the injury predicted as the initial position of the occupant was moved further inboard, down and forward in the vehicle. Stiffer interior trim was found to improve the injury prediction of the occupant, while changing the material of the foam door inserts had no effect. It was found that in general the occupant remained in position, due to the inertia of the occupant, while the seat began moving towards the centerline of the vehicle. Future considerations could include more advanced restraint systems to couple the occupant more effectively to the seat, or to develop side interior trim that engages the occupant earlier to reduce the relative velocity between the <b>occupant</b> and intruding <b>door.</b> Overall, the model correlated well with experimental data and provided insight into several areas which could lead to improved occupant protection in side impact. Future work should include integrating side airbags into the model, widening the focus of the areas of injury to include other body regions and integrating more detailed human body models...|$|R
