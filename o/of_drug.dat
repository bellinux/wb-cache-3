40|$|Skin {{has been}} paid {{attention}} as a site of application <b>of</b> prescription <b>drugs,</b> over-the-counter drugs (non-prescription drugs) and cosmetics. Skin permeation and skin concentration of the compounds should be considered after topical administration, {{as well as their}} blood concentration to evaluate efficacy and safety. Since the evaluation of the amount <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> permeated through skin is important for topically applied drugs, studies on the skin permeation has been greatly advanced. In addition, many reports proved that skin permeabilities <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> could be predicted from physicochemical parameters <b>of</b> <b>drugs.</b> On the other hand, few reports have been found on the prediction of skin concentration <b>of</b> <b>drugs.</b> Furthermore, many experimented problems are left to determine the skin concentration of drugs: severe consume of human or animal skins, difficult removal <b>of</b> applied <b>drugs</b> from the skin surface, low drug extraction ratio from skin and low sensitivity to determine skin concentration <b>of</b> <b>drugs,</b> and requirement <b>of</b> long time measurement.

A total of 20 125 prescriptions were collected from 680 primary health clinics in vil-lages from 40 counties in 10 provinces of Western China. Five measurements were used to as-sess the irrational <b>drug</b> use: percentage <b>of</b> encounters with an antibiotic prescribed, average number <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> per encounter, percentage of encounters with an injection prescribed, percent-age <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> prescribed by generic name and percentage <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> prescribed from National Essential Medicines List or Formulary.

Her in vitro research was proven accurate when the drugs she studied were used to treat patients suffering from tertian malaria, a form of the illness in which the paroxysm of fever occurs every third day. She also investigated the drugs pamaquine and atebrin, along with proguanil, though proguanil was the only one shown to cause the development <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> resistance.
