Although they form part of the same institution, going to Aberlour is not a prerequisite of going to Gordonstoun and neither is it enforced that pupils at Aberlour House continue on into Gordonstoun. Even so, they are both <b>obviously</b> <b>very</b> close, sharing the same school song, school flag and the same motto.|$|E
25|$|The inner {{ridge and}} trough zone {{surrounds}} the central palimpsest. The ridges that immediately surround the central zone have steep flanks facing outward. These scarps, when studied {{at a high}} resolution, {{turned out to be}} discontinuous consisting of a series of small bright knobs surrounded by the smooth dark material. They are <b>obviously</b> <b>very</b> degraded structures. The troughs that are situated further from the center than ridges are sinuous and appear to be graben (about 20km wide). The inner trough zone extends up to 950km from the center of Valhalla.|$|E
25|$|During this period, Cromwell was {{continuing}} {{to enjoy the}} various invitations coming his way {{as a member of}} the A-list Hollywood social circuit. According to Bob Thomas, in his biography of Joan Crawford, Cromwell was a regular at the Saturday Night dinner parties of his former co-star Franchot Tone and then-wife Crawford. Other guests whom Cromwell dined with there included Barbara Stanwyck and then-husband Frank Fay, and William Haines and Jimmy Rogers. During the freewheeling heyday of West L.A. nightlife in the late 30s, Cromwell is said by author Charles Higham to have carried on a sometime, though <b>obviously</b> <b>very</b> discreet, affair with aviator and businessman Howard Hughes.|$|E

50|$|This meant, of course, {{that not}} only was Jones very conspicuously absent from the sparsely {{populated}} Lake Oval (the crowd for the day was 13,420) — and, <b>very</b> <b>obviously,</b> not supporting his Carlton team-mates — he was, at the same time, very conspicuously present at the MCG, was not injured in any way, and was <b>very</b> <b>obviously</b> supporting Richmond.|$|R
25|$|Green's mid-1860s Newmarket {{premises}} were in Station Road, {{very near}} where it joins the High Street. They were <b>obviously</b> <b>very</b> extensive as they included a vast half-mile wide straw-bed circle which, in hard frosts, other trainers (Blanton, Godding and J Wood are mentioned) he allowed to use. But Green's Newmarket premises were {{put up for}} sale at the White Hart Inn on the 13 February 1868 by auctioneer Ebenezer Feist and presumably he, as a quarterly tenant, was obliged to move to other premises in Newmarket at that point. Further details of the property are given though – a dwelling house with enclosed court yard, stalls and loose boxes for sixteen horses, hay, corn and straw chambers, carriage houses and an ample supply of spring water, within a short distance of the railway station.|$|E
25|$|A devadasi's {{life after}} {{dedication}} was <b>obviously</b> <b>very</b> different centuries ago. Nowadays After dedication {{of a girl}} to the temple, she has to take bath every day {{early in the morning}} and should present herself at the temple during morning worship of Yellamma. She is not allowed to enter the sanctum sanctorum. But she will bow to the deity from outside. Thereafter she sweeps compound of the temple. Every Tuesday and Friday she goes for yoga along with senior jogatis (yoga teachers). During this period she learns innumerable songs in praise of Yellamma and her son Parashurama. If she shows some aptitude to learn playing instruments she will be given training by her elder jogatis. In Yellampura and other villages Devadasis do not dance but this is performed by eunuch companions. The main functions of Devadasis would be singing and playing stringed musical instruments and Jagate. They form a small group and go for joga, from house to house on every Tuesday and Friday (Jogan Shankar, 1990).|$|E

500|$|Gunn {{revealed}} that character introductions were the [...] "hardest scenes to crack", with Thanos' introduction {{being the most}} difficult. He felt that [...] "having Thanos be in that scene was more helpful to the [...] {{than it was to}} Guardians of the Galaxy," [...] yet he still wanted Thanos in the film, without [...] " [...] the actual antagonist of the film, which is Ronan." [...] To solve his dilemma, Gunn chose to have Ronan kill [...] "The Other", Thanos' vizier, saying, [...] "I thought that was interesting, because we’ve had the Other, who’s <b>obviously</b> <b>very</b> powerful even in comparison to Loki, and then we see Ronan wipe his ass with him. So that I liked, but even that was sort of difficult, because it played as funnier when I first wrote it, and the humor didn’t work so much." ...|$|E
500|$|Speaking {{about the}} siege of Riverrun, Weiss noted about Brienne and Jaime's reunion that [...] "Jaime didn't expect to see Brienne {{necessarily}} ever again, he certainly didn't expect to see her marching into his military camp. And his relationship is <b>obviously</b> <b>very</b> complicated, and fraught, and has undercurrents that he's uncomfortable with feeling." [...] Benioff continued about Brienne's escape, [...] "It's these two who are not quite sure {{how they feel about}} the other, and he lets her go. He'd be well within his rights to send his men after her, to capture her, and it wouldn't be that hard to capture her since she's being slowly rowed away by Podrick, but he doesn't. She might technically be an enemy now that she's serving Sansa Stark, who is still obviously a suspect in Joffrey's murder, but she's not Jaime's enemy." ...|$|E
500|$|Marino {{was cast}} in November 2015, on which Fazekas said, [...] "He’s <b>obviously</b> <b>very</b> funny, but he also is a great {{dramatic}} actor. We had talked about him for a different role, {{but it was too}} small of a role. Then we knew we wanted him in [...] Manfredi role. So that role became so much bigger because it was Ken." [...] About the character, Fazekas added, [...] "What I love about Manfredi is he’s funny, he can flip on a dime and be a total psycho, and he is madly in love with Whitney and genuinely so—even when she’s cuckoo. Their scenes together, there’s such a tenderness to them". Since the character differs from its comic counterpart, Marino said [...] "the two things [...] " [...] were defining that Manfredi [...] "definitely was the muscle for Whitney, and that he did have a true love for her." [...] Marino wanted to make sure Manfredi [...] "felt like he was an old-school tough guy" [...] and felt that Frost was [...] "the one true love for him", comparing their relationship to Joe DiMaggio and Marilyn Monroe's.|$|E

2500|$|About 30 {{seconds after}} seeing the first flash of light, Arnold saw a series of bright flashes in the {{distance}} off to his left, or north of Mt. Rainier, which was then 20 to [...] away. He thought they might be reflections on his airplane's windows, but a few quick tests (rocking his airplane from side to side, removing his eyeglasses, later rolling down his side window) ruled this out. The reflections came from flying objects. They flew in a long chain, and Arnold for a moment considered they might be a flock of geese, but quickly ruled this out {{for a number of}} reasons, including the altitude, bright glint, and <b>obviously</b> <b>very</b> fast speed. He then thought they might be a new type of jet and started looking intently for a tail and was surprised that he couldn't find any.|$|E
2500|$|There {{has been}} {{criticism}} directed at newer visual kei bands for having lost {{the spirit of}} their forefathers, copying each other in design and sound, becoming all the same. As far back as 1998, Neil Strauss reported that to visual kei bands [...] "after X" [...] makeup and outrageous looks became [...] "more important than music". Several older musicians expressed their discontent; Kirito (Pierrot, Angelo) said [...] "now it's more like people are dressing up a certain way {{because they want to}} be visual kei or look visual kei. They are doing it to look like others instead of doing it to look different. This is <b>obviously</b> <b>very</b> different from when we started out more than ten years ago.", while Sugizo (Luna Sea) that [...] "they cannot make good sounds and music is more like a hobby for them. I cannot feel their soul in the music".|$|E
2500|$|After {{not being}} given a {{contract}} with the Queensland Bulls for the 2007–08 season, Nash decided to try to restart his career by moving to the West Indies. Speaking of his decision, he said [...] "I was <b>obviously</b> <b>very</b> disappointed to miss out on a contract, but I pretty much got told {{it would be hard for}} me to work my way back in again and I felt I still have something to offer". In October 2007, Nash was named in the Jamaican squad. Nash played a key role in Jamaica winning the KFC Cup. In the final, he scored 117 as his team beat Trinidad and Tobago by nine wickets. Nash finished the season with 422 first-class runs at 46.88 to his name from the domestic competition and was third in the batting averages. There was surprise in some quarters when Nash was not selected for the Test series against Australia in 2008.|$|E

2500|$|The {{business}} of interpretation is <b>obviously</b> <b>very</b> complicated. Literary {{uses of the}} problem of free-will and necessity, for example, may be noticed to give curiously bad arguments and I should think get their strength from keeping you in doubt between the two methods. Thus Hardy is fond of showing us an unusually stupid person subjected to very unusually bad luck, and then a moral is drawn, not merely by inference but by solemn assertion, that we are all in the same boat as this person whose story is striking precisely because it is unusual. The effect may be very grand, but to make an otherwise logical reader accept the process must depend on giving him obscure reasons for wishing it so. It is clear at any rate that this grand notion of the inadequacy of life, so various in its means of expression, so reliable a bass note in the arts, needs to be counted as a possible territory of the pastoral.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are about}} 30,000 {{surviving}} lines of Old English poetry and about ten times that much prose, {{and the majority}} of both is religious. The prose was influential and <b>obviously</b> <b>very</b> important to the Anglo-Saxons and more important than the poetry to those who came after the Anglo-Saxons. Homilies are sermons, lessons to be given on moral and doctrinal matters, and the two most prolific and respected writers of Anglo-Saxon prose, Ælfric and Wulfstan, were both homilists. [...] Ælfric also wrote the 'Lives of Saints' which very popular and were highly prized. Almost all surviving poetry is found in only one manuscript copy, but {{there are a number of}} different versions of some prose works, especially the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which was apparently promulgated to monasteries by the royal court. Anglo-Saxon clergy also continued to write in Latin, the language of Bede's works, monastic chronicles, and theological writing, although Bede's biographer records that he was familiar with Old English poetry and gives a five line lyric which he either wrote or liked to quote – the sense is unclear.|$|E
2500|$|His return Ashes tour {{over the}} winter of 2013–14 was less successful, however. In a series which England lost 5–0, Pietersen {{averaged}} only 29 and passed fifty only twice in ten innings. He made his 100th Test appearance in the first Test. During this game Pietersen was dismissed by a widely reported catch taken by Chris Sabburg, who entered the field as a substitute fielder. He remained nevertheless England's leading run scorer with 294 runs. He also bowled during the fifth and final Test. Once the tour had ended, and the fallout had contributed to the removal of Flower as head coach, there was much media speculation {{on the nature of}} Pietersen's relationship with the team management. The ECB met and announced on 4 February 2014 that Pietersen had not been selected for the upcoming tour of the Caribbean, a decision they described as [...] "unanimous". Media announcements immediately began stating that Pietersen's career was over. Pietersen himself released a statement which read [...] "Although I am <b>obviously</b> <b>very</b> sad the incredible journey has come to an end, I'm also hugely proud of what we, as a team, have achieved over the past nine years." ...|$|E
