The year 1883 saw similar service, along with fishery protection operations in the North Sea; this had become increasingly important due to the rising number of foreign boats illegally fishing in German waters. On 15 October 1883, Drache was once again decommissioned for the winter. She returned to service for more survey work in mid-1884 in the Skagerrak and the coast of Norway. She continued surveying areas of the North Sea through the first half of 1887, before being decommissioned the last time on 30 September. The <b>oceanographic</b> <b>data</b> Drache had gathered over the previous fifteen proved to be indispensable to German U-boat crews and mining operations during World War I. On 13 December, Drache was stricken from the naval register and hulked in Wilhelmshaven. She was towed through the Eider Canal in 1888 and was sunk by the torpedo boat [...] in a demonstration for Vizeadmiral (Vice Admiral) Max von der Goltz. The wreck was thereafter raised and broken up.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{there are}} so few right whales to observe in the North Pacific, and they are {{generally}} feeding far from shore, alternative analyses of habitat preferences are required. [...] Gregr used maps of historic whaling catches and added <b>oceanographic</b> <b>data</b> from other sources to identify preferred habitats. His analysis suggest that on the scale of ocean basins, North Pacific right whales seek out regions of cold water with low inter-annual variability and high within-season variability (i.e. areas where high frontal activity occurred predictably from year to year). However, and a more localized regional scale these correlations weakened.|$|E

During a 1969–70 deployment to Vietnam, Hamilton interdicted weapons smugglers and fired more than 4,600 rounds of gunfire in support of U.S. and Vietnamese troops ashore. From 1965–1975, Hamilton served on Atlantic Ocean Stations, collecting valuable <b>oceanographic</b> <b>data</b> and conducting frequent search and rescue missions. Hamilton also directed the interdictions of over 21,000 Haitian migrants throughout the Caribbean during Operation Able Manner. In 1994, Hamilton received the Coast Guard Meritorious Unit Commendation for rescuing 135 Haitians from the sea after their sailboat capsized and sank. In 1996, Hamilton transited the Panama Canal and served as the command and control platform for Operation Frontier Shield, a multi-agency effort to curtail the influx of narcotics into the United States. Hamilton intercepted 14 drug-laden vessels carrying more than 115 tons of contraband worth 200 million dollars. In 1999, Hamilton seized over [...] of cocaine bound for the U.S. in the Eastern Pacific Ocean. Hamilton frequently patrolled the Bering Sea off the Alaskan coast at the Maritime Boundary Line (MBL) which separates the Russian and the United States Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ).

We provide an accessible set of sufficient conditions, in terms of the observational model and the prior, to ensure geometric ergodicity of RSM samplers of the posterior distribution.
