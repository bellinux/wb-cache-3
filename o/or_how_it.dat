5|$|A diverse {{range of}} groups have raised issues, such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), over the welfare of animals, {{governmental}} and social agencies over health issues and compliance with nutritional labeling laws, and unions and trade groups over labor relations and laws. These situations have touched on the concepts of animal rights, corporate responsibility and ethics, {{as well as social}} justice. While the majority of the disputes did not result in lawsuits, in many of the cases the situations raised legal questions, dealt with statutory compliance, or resulted in legal remedies such as changes in contractual procedure or binding agreements between parties. The resolutions to these legal matters have often altered the way the company interacts and negotiates contracts with its suppliers and franchisees <b>or</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> does business with the public.|$|E

The mechanism of infection and transmission of diseases was little understood in the 14th century; many people believed only God's anger could produce such horrific displays.|$|E

It is assumed to have developed exclusively in the Horn of Africa since approximately the 7th century. Given the dearth of loan words from foreign languages within the xeer's nomenclature, the customary law appears to have evolved in situ.|$|E

In fact, the NLRB asked the NHLPA to withdraw its unfair labor practices charge on November 20, 1957, arguing it did not have jurisdiction. This was followed by the Montreal Canadiens players rejection of the association in early January, 1958.|$|E
25|$|In 1941, Charles Huggins {{reported}} that androgen ablation therapy causes regression of primary and metastatic androgen-dependent prostate cancer. He {{was awarded the}} 1966 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for this discovery. Androgen ablation therapy causes remission in 80-90% of patients undergoing therapy, resulting in a median progression-free survival of 12 to 33 months. After remission, an androgen-independent phenotype typically emerges, wherein the median overall survival is 23–37 months {{from the time of}} initiation of androgen ablation therapy. It is not clear how the prostate cancer becomes androgen-independent <b>or</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> reestablishes progression, although a few possibilities (on how) have been proposed. And the way the cancer changes, to overcome the lack of androgen, may vary between individual patients.|$|E

25|$|Aphasia was non-medically {{described}} in early texts, {{such as the}} Bible and writings of Homer, {{but there was no}} further mention of what aphasia was <b>or</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> occurred at that time. In medical research, speechlessness was described as an incorrect prognosis, and there was no assumption that underlying language complications existed. The earliest recorded medical cases of aphasia were made back in the Middle Ages, where it was thought to be an imbalance of bodily fluids in the brain that caused the inability to speak one's mind. The first medical documents dating back to the late 19th century contain early descriptions of aphasia. Broca and his colleagues were some of the first to write about aphasia, but Wernicke was the first credited to have written extensively about aphasia being a disorder that contained comprehension difficulties. Despite claims of who reported on aphasia first, it was F.J. Gall that gave the first full description of aphasia after studying wounds to the brain, as well as his observation of speech difficulties resulting from vascular lesions.|$|E

500|$|Given {{its size}} and orientation, the panel was {{probably}} meant to stand alone, but may have been conceived as the wing of triptych altarpiece.

At least half of Christus's known patrons were Italian or Spanish, and he often changed his style to suit their desire. Around eight of his paintings– only about 25 are extant – have come from either Italy or Spain, giving credence to speculation that he spent time there. [...] Yet the existence of the thriving export market in early Netherlandish panel painting suggests equally {{that it could have been}} painted in Bruges and transported south.|$|E

500|$|Lynch has {{mentioned}} {{that he tried to}} avoid thinking about the morality of the narrative, <b>or</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> would be received by censors or critics, feeling that if he allowed that worry to affect him it would ultimately drive him to create something that made him uncomfortable, preferring instead to simply produce the episode he wanted to and be prepared to defend it if necessary. He has also compared the search for Laura's killer to the central narrative of the 1960s television series The Fugitive, which featured an ongoing search for a one-armed man. Contrasting the two, Lynch stated [...] "each week, you know, they [...] hardly ever dealt with that. And that's the beautiful thing. You keep wondering, 'When will he find this guy and set everything straight?' But then you knew it would be the end".|$|E
