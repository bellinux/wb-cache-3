5|$|Feeding {{mainly on}} cephalopods, bony fishes, and other {{cartilaginous}} fishes, the copper shark is a fast-swimming predator {{that has been}} known to hunt in large groups, utilizing their numbers to their advantage; however for most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> remain solitary. Off South Africa, this species associates closely with the annual sardine run, involving millions of southern African pilchard (Sardinops sagax). Like other requiem sharks, it is viviparous, with the developing embryos mainly nourished through a placental connection formed from the depleted yolk sac. Females bear litters of 7 to 24 pups every other year in coastal nursery areas, after a gestation period of 12 or perhaps as long as 21 months. It is extremely slow-growing, with males and females not reaching maturity until 13–19 and 19–20 years of age respectively.|$|E
5|$|Oscar Finley and Wally Figg are the bickering {{partners}} {{of a small}} law firm in the South Side of Chicago; in fact, for much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> are just a pair of ambulance chasers. Oscar's character holds the firm together despite the childish and unethical behavior of Wally, his junior partner. Their bickering is often mediated by Rochelle, the highly competent African American secretary, who had {{learned a lot of}} law in her eight years in the office. Meanwhile, David Zinc, a graduate of the Harvard Law School, is completely fed up with the grinding and dehumanizing – though well-paid – life of an associate in the law firm of Rogan Rothberg, where in five years of work he had never seen the inside of a courtroom, in fact, David's expertise was in long-term bonds a job he hated. David suddenly breaks away, goes on a drinking binge and by chance finds himself at the Finley & Figg office. Feeling an elevating sense of freedom and vowing never to go back, Zinc willingly relegates himself to working for the two disreputable street lawyers and ambulance chasers.|$|E

5|$|The {{record is}} known for the {{difficulty}} Priestess encountered in trying to release it. The band's extensive touring schedule for their previous album Hello Master consumed much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> would have used to write new material, and after they began doing so, they had disputes with RCA Records, their international distributor at the time, {{as to whether the}} new songs were acceptable. After the completion of the recording sessions, which were themselves problematic, RCA ultimately refused to release the album, fearing it was not commercial enough, but allowed the group to release it on another label. Tee Pee Records signed the group thereafter and released the album internationally. Priestess were still signed to Indica Records, but only for Canadian distribution; the release on Indica was withheld until an international distributor was found.|$|E
5|$|The {{localization}} of Path of Radiance {{was handled}} by Nintendo of America's localization branch Nintendo Treehouse. During the process, the team {{worked closely with}} Intelligent Systems staff members. The biggest challenge for the team was translating from Japanese to English, which required staff from Japan {{to come over and}} check their work. When translating the dialogue, the localization team wanted to preserve the story's depth and serious tone, despite often having a limited text and character space for interaction and expression. While they had the option to add extra text boxes, this would potentially have made going through conversations tedious for players, so they worked to match the number of text boxes used in the Japanese version. The western version's difficulty was also toned down: the Japanese version's Maniac setting was removed, Hard Mode was toned down, and a new Easy was introduced. These adjustments were based on both western test player feedback, and feedback from Japanese players complaining about the game's high difficulty. The amount of dialogue and text that needed translating was estimated at less than that in Animal Crossing, but still enough to take several months to complete. Due to its serious nature, the team needed to take a different approach to its localization than other Nintendo titles. As far as possible, the team remained faithful to the original script, aside from pieces like jokes which would not have made sense to people unfamiliar with Japanese humor. While most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> refrained from putting out-of-context remarks in character dialogue, an exception was Anna, a recurring Fire Emblem character who featured in optional tutorial missions. As she existed outside the game to a degree, they had more freedom to have her make pop culture references.|$|E

25|$|The {{literary}} sublime, {{as well as}} the philosophical, aesthetic sublimes, {{is inherently}} connected to nature but, as with most literary terms, the sublime evolved alongside literature.

Authors began to see the sublime, with its inherent contradictions (pain and pleasure, terror and awe) as representative <b>of</b> <b>the</b> changing political and cultural climate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>times.</b> <b>They</b> began to incorporate more aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sublime into their literary works as a way of externalizing their inner conflicts.

40|$|It is standardly {{assumed that}} there are three—and only three—ways to solve problem of {{temporary}} intrinsics: (a) embrace presentism, (b) relativize property possession to times, or (c) accept <b>the</b> doctrine <b>of</b> temporal parts. <b>The</b> first two solutions are favored by endurantists, whereas the third is <b>the</b> perdurantist solution <b>of</b> choice. In this paper, I {{argue that there is}} a further type of solution available to endurantists, one that not only avoids the usual costs, but is structurally identical to the temporal parts solution preferred by perdurantists. In addition to providing a general characterization of this new type of solution, I also discuss certain of its anticipations in the literature on bundle theory, as well as provide a detailed development of it in terms of my own preferred metaphysics of ordinary objects—namely, a distinctive form of substratum theory tracing to Aristotle. Ordinary objects persist. And on our ordinary conception of persistence, they do so by enduring—that is, by being wholly present at each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>times</b> <b>they</b> exist. Thus, to say that Socrates persists is just to say that <b>the</b> whole <b>of</b> him is present at each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>times</b> <b>of</b> his existence. Many philosophers now reject our ordinary conception of persistence in favor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> doctrine <b>of</b> temporal parts. On <b>the</b> standard development <b>of</b> this doctrine, things persist not by enduring but by perduring—that is, by being partially present at each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>times</b> <b>they</b> exist...|$|R
