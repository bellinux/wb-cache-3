When asked of their views on their looks, members of the band have stated {{that they would not}} change their sound or image for a commercial approach; Tuck also said, [...] "Without sounding harsh, we're more interested in what <b>our</b> <b>music</b> sounds like than what our fucking hair looks like." ...|$|E
500|$|Bush {{opined that}} this record wasn't very {{different}} from their previous releases. [...] "It's still an Anthrax album with many different parts that can appeal to a wide audience.

500|$|The {{video for}} [...] "Stupid Girl" [...] is a {{performance}} piece, {{inspired by the}} title sequence from David Fincher's 1995 movie Se7en. The clip was shot in just four hours entirely within a warehouse decorated with plexiglas sheets on which the song lyrics were written. Bayer cut the film into pieces, and soaked it in his bath, applying deliberate fingerprints and abrasions to the footage before putting it back together by hand. Vig would compliment the video for mirroring the band's sound: [...] "some of it looked beautiful, some of it looked distorted, and kinda fucked up - and it sorta described some of <b>our</b> <b>music</b> visually". Bayer later re-edited a second version of the video, with alternative footage from the original shoot for a remix version of [...] "Stupid Girl" [...] by Todd Terry.|$|E

50|$|The {{producer}} of the series was James Upshaw, who also produced series like Hit Parade (1956-1959) and The Lorrae Desmond Show (1960-1964). The latter occupied the time slot of Make <b>Ours</b> <b>Music</b> for some time in 1960.|$|R

500|$|Rhys {{has also}} stated that after Love Kraft the band were [...] "kind of {{thinking}} of making a loud record" [...] following the [...] "very different atmosphere" [...] at initial shows on the Love Kraft tour, when the group played the [...] "slow" [...] songs from that album. Towards {{the end of the}} tour the setlist had become [...] "full of fast songs from [...] back catalogue" [...] and this had an effect as the band entered into the studio for the Hey Venus! sessions: [...] "It's definitely the first time our audience has influenced <b>our</b> <b>music</b> in that sense". Rhys used his second solo album, Candylion, as an outlet for the quiet, acoustic songs that he had written rather than put them forward for inclusion on Hey Venus!: ...|$|E
500|$|Apart {{from the}} final track, [...] "Mørket's Grøde", and the {{instrumental}} [...] "Tilflukt", all song lyrics are written in English. Zuza Steck of the Polish magazine Musick Magazine noted the [...] "unblack" [...] - Christian - message of the lyrics and how Antestor demonstrates that a band can maintain an extreme atmosphere but take a different lyrical approach. Antestor expounded on the lyrical themes that [...] "at {{the same time that}} we are Christians, we are also humans. I think almost everyone can relate to parts of <b>our</b> <b>music</b> and lyrics, for absolutely everyone – Christians and non-believers alike – experience hard and terrible times. The Lord does not say we will not meet hard times as Christians, but that He will be with us and carry us through it, and that {{is a big part of}} the Antestor message." ...|$|E

500|$|The album did not chart {{as well in}} the United States as its predecessor, peaking {{at number}} 148 on the Billboard 200. It was, however, the band's first album to chart on the UK Albums Chart, debuting at number 45. Many of the songs on Leave Home were not {{considered}} by Mickey Leigh to be [...] "radio–friendly" [...] because [...] "Carbona Not Glue" [...] was about Intoxicative inhalant. Joey relates: [...] "We thought we had a lotta songs that should've been hits. If you grew up in the sixties, things would just get played and be hits right off the bat. So we thought since <b>our</b> <b>music</b> was doin' something unique that everyone would pick up on that. What really happened was we were so alien that no one wanted to touch us. And so we wouldn't get played" ...|$|E
500|$|The cover art by Hugh Syme {{features}} {{an elderly woman}} hanging babies by their feet on a seemingly endless clothesline. According to bassist David Ellefson, the artwork concept was directly inspired from a line of the title track, [...] "We've been hung out to dry". He explained that the title track [...] "was probably the strongest representation of how we feel about {{the young people who}} listen to <b>our</b> <b>music</b> and what their future holds for them. It's like you have a choice, you can become proactive or you can choose 'Youthanasia'." [...] The title is a combination [...] of the words [...] "youth" [...] and [...] "euthanasia". Mustaine has stated that the idea for the title stems from hearing about Jack Kevorkian, as well as the declining state of well-being of young people, specifically referring to issues like drugs, crime and violence, and a lack of parenting.|$|E
500|$|La Dulzura {{represented}} a stylistic departure for the group, both musically and lyrically. The song [...] "Del Tope al Fondo" [...] {{is influenced by}} Argentine music, especially the genre of tango. Lyrically, the band discusses more romantic themes {{as opposed to the}} political emphasis of the group's previous records. [...] Guitarist Eliut Gonzalez remarked that the band aimed to shift discussion to [...] "the good things in the world", explaining [...] that [...] "We know that people need help, and that behind every revolution or movement, there is love. We wanted to document that in <b>our</b> <b>music,</b> but without doing it in a cheesy or typical way." [...] The singles [...] "Baja la Tensión", [...] "La Complicidad", [...] "Para Estar" [...] and [...] "Ilegal" [...] all charted on the Billboard Latin Pop Songs chart. In 2011, the group collaborated with Dominican musician Vicente García on his single [...] "Mi Balcón".|$|E

500|$|Ibrahim {{recalled}} in 2014 {{that it took}} only one take. Asked in an interview how the title came about, he said: [...] "Because Basil was from Manenberg and for us Manenberg was just symbolic of the removal out of District Six, which is actually the removal of everybody from everywhere in the world, and Manenberg specifically because... it signifies, it's <b>our</b> <b>music,</b> and it's our culture..." [...] The township of Manenberg was considered symbolic with respect to apartheid in the same was as Soweto. The track was released on the album Mannenberg – Is Where It's Happening in the same year. The album only featured two songs; [...] "Mannenberg", and [...] "The Pilgrim" [...] (which was similarly long, at 12 minutes and 47 seconds). The title [...] "Mrs. Williams from Mannenberg", in reference to Gladys Williams, former housekeeper {{of one of the}} musicians, Morris Goldberg, was also considered for the album, and a photograph of her by Ibrahim was used on the album cover.|$|E
500|$|After {{working on}} their debut self-titled album, Whodini {{embarked}} on a three-month European tour. Two-and-a-half weeks into this tour, {{they were joined by}} Kangol Kid and UTFO. The group had also planned to tour in Israel and Australia following their European tour, but refused to do so, as they had been away from home for three weeks and found the tour [...] "rigorous". Singer-songwriter Jalil Hutchins later said, [...] "Somebody should've stepped in and made us [...]" [...] Whodini member John Fletcher (Ecstasy) said that the group thought European audiences would be unfamiliar with their music, but they [...] "found that lots of kids, lots of club owners, had made a real effort to get hold of <b>our</b> <b>music.</b> When we discovered that, we realized that the music we were working with really was universal, that we didn't have to think of a particular market. People everywhere like to dance, sweat and party, and they like the same kind of sounds." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{the time}} came to return to a {{recording}} studio, the band looked for a new record producer. Lillywhite, who had done the work for both of their previous albums, had other commitments, and many in the band felt it was time to chart a new course anyway. Columbia Records management first attempted to match the band with David Bowie, who was a high-profile Furs supporter and who expressed enthusiasm for working with them. Bowie, however, also had commitments which would have postponed work for what the band felt would be an unacceptably long time. More importantly, there was a belief among some band members that this partnership would not yield much of a change. According to Richard Butler, [...] "the media were already making lots of comparisons between <b>our</b> <b>music</b> and his", and the band did not want to appear too indebted. An eleventh-hour offer by Lillywhite to fit the band into his schedule was politely declined.|$|E

500|$|The {{new feature}} {{continued}} {{to be known as}} The Concert Feature or Musical Feature as late as November 1938. Hal Horne, a publicist for Disney's film distributor RKO Radio Pictures, wished for a different title, and gave the suggestion Filmharmonic Concert. Stuart Buchanan then held a contest at the studio for a title that produced almost 1,800 suggestions including Bach to Stravinsky and Bach and Highbrowski by Stokowski. Still, the favorite among the film's supervisors was Fantasia, an early working title that had even grown on Horne, [...] "It isn't the word alone but the meaning we read into it." [...] From the beginning of its development, Disney expressed the greater importance of music in Fantasia compared to his past work: [...] "In our ordinary stuff, <b>our</b> <b>music</b> is always under action, but on this... we're supposed to be picturing this music—not the music fitting our story." [...] Disney had hoped that the film would bring classical music to people who, like himself, had previously [...] "walked out on this kind of stuff".|$|E
500|$|Several of {{the songs}} from xx were {{licensed}} by XL to television programs in the UK and North America. [...] "Intro" [...] became widely used as theme music in television, including sports highlights, episodes of series such as Law & Order and Cold Case, an advertisement for AT, and BBC's coverage of the 2010 British general election. Along with their placement in television, songs from the record were used by North American chain stores such as Starbucks and Urban Outfitters as background music at their locations. According to McCormick, these marketing strategies helped the xx develop enough media presence to garner [...] "over half a million sales around the world without ever having anything as vulgar as a hit". Kris Chen, XL's A senior vice president, believed the exposure was desired and necessary for promoting an album that was not [...] "driven by pop radio". Although the band realised their music had to be marketed somehow, Croft expressed reservations about [...] "putting <b>our</b> <b>music</b> on everything, just to put it to anything {{just for the sake}} of money".|$|E
500|$|Even before {{viewing the}} script, Reznor and Ross opted {{to use a}} redolent {{approach}} to creating the film's score. After discussing with Fincher the varying soundscapes and emotions, the duo spent six weeks composing. [...] "We composed music we felt might belong," [...] stated the Nine Inch Nails lead vocalist, [...] "and then we'd run it by Fincher, to see where his head’s at and he responded positively. He was filming at {{this time last year}} and assembling rough edits of scenes to see what it feels like, and he was inserting <b>our</b> <b>music</b> at that point, rather than using temp music, which is how it usually takes place, apparently." [...] Finding a structure for the soundtrack was arguably the most strenuous task. [...] "We weren’t working on a finished thing, so everything keeps moving around, scenes are changing in length, and even the order of things are shuffled around, and that can get pretty frustrating when you get precious about your work. It was a lesson we learned pretty quickly of, 'Everything is in flux, and approach it as such. Hopefully it’ll work out in the end.'" ...|$|E
