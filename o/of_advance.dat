5|$|Amidst growing {{concerns}} amongst Australian {{military commanders}} about Japanese intentions, the scheduled {{replacement of the}} 22nd Brigade was cancelled, and the 2/18th remained in Seremban until they were transported east to Jemaluang in August. The following month they were sent north to Mersing, which, situated {{on the east coast}} of the Malay Peninsula, was considered a likely place for a Japanese landing as it offered a short route <b>of</b> <b>advance</b> towards Singapore. At Mersing, the battalion was set to work digging defensive positions and constructing wire obstacles, punctuated by familiarisation patrols and anti-aircraft, anti-gas and mortar training.|$|E

5|$|Discovering on 24 December {{that the}} French squadrons {{had broken out}} of Brest, Barham {{despatched}} two squadrons in pursuit, led by Rear-Admiral Sir Richard Strachan and Rear-Admiral Sir John Borlase Warren. A third squadron detached from the blockade of Cadiz without orders, under its commander Rear-Admiral Sir John Thomas Duckworth, all three British forces cruising the mid-Atlantic {{in search of the}} French. Following a brief encounter with Willaumez, Duckworth sailed to the Caribbean and there discovered and destroyed Leissegues' squadron at the Battle of San Domingo in February 1806. With one of the French squadrons eliminated, Strachan and Warren remained in the mid-Atlantic anticipating Willaumez's return from his operations to the south. Warren's squadron was ordered to cruise in the Eastern Atlantic, in the region of the island of Madeira, directly across Linois's line <b>of</b> <b>advance.</b>|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of their advance through Belgium, the Germans {{committed}} a number of war crimes against the Belgian civilian population along their route <b>of</b> <b>advance.</b> These massacres were often responses to towns whose populations were accused of fighting as Francs-Tireurs or guerillas against the German army. Civilians were summarily executed and several towns deliberately destroyed in a series of punitive actions collectively known as The Rape of Belgium. As many as 6,500 people were killed by the German army between August and November 1914. In Leuven, the historic library of the town's university was deliberately burned. News of the atrocities, also widely exaggerated by the Allied press, raised considerable sympathy for the Belgian civilian population in occupied Belgium. The sympathy for the plight of Belgian civilians and Belgian refugees continued in Allied newspapers and propaganda {{until the end of the}} war.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{present a}} model <b>of</b> <b>advanced</b> nursing {{practice}} {{based on a}} narrative analysis <b>of</b> <b>advanced</b> practice stories provided by nurses. Design: Using narratives depicting their clinical practice, nurses {{were asked to provide}} illustrations <b>of</b> <b>advanced</b> practice. Analysis <b>of</b> fifty nine narratives enabled exploration <b>of</b> aspects <b>of</b> <b>advanced</b> practice. Setting: Stories depicted contexts <b>of</b> <b>advanced</b> nursing practice including mental health, child and family health, acute and aged care. Results: Findings revealed six themes: Knowticing; Getting a doctor; Trans-action; Taleoring care; Experiencing vulnerability and Transporting: facilitating comfort and control. Three narrative aspects representing advanced practice were described: Rescue; Recognition and Responsibility; and Respect. The stories were of complex care situations relating to diverse areas of work highlighting critical incidents. Some incidents gave nurses great satisfaction whilst others were challenging. Conclusions: The findings are presented as a model <b>of</b> <b>advanced</b> practice. Both the world <b>of</b> <b>advanced</b> practice a diagrammatic representation of the findings, and the futures model <b>of</b> <b>advanced</b> nursing practice incorporate the themes that emerged from the study. They highlight the central, often invisible place of the nurse in patient care. Advanced practice nurses assume responsibility for optimising care. They believe they make a difference and they call for recognition. The models reflect the multi-dimensional nature <b>of</b> <b>advanced</b> practice, its inherent complexity, dynamism and the potential for amplification of practice roles and functions...|$|R

50|$|A College <b>of</b> <b>Advanced</b> Technology (CAT) was a type {{of higher}} {{education}} institution established in 1956 in England and Wales following {{the publication of a}} Government White Paper on Technical Education which listed 24 technical colleges in receipt of 75% grant for parts <b>of</b> their <b>advanced</b> work. The government confirmed that the proportion <b>of</b> <b>advanced</b> work at these colleges should be increased so that they could develop as quickly as possible into Colleges <b>of</b> <b>Advanced</b> Technology. Eventually ten of the 24 were confirmed as CATs. Birmingham College <b>of</b> <b>Advanced</b> Technology was the first to be so designated, in 1956.|$|R
5|$|Early on 10 April, Pukovnik Franjo Nikolić, {{the head}} of the {{operations}} staff with the headquarters of the 1st Army Group, left his post and visited the senior Ustaše leader Slavko Kvaternik in Zagreb. He then returned to headquarters and redirected 4th Army units around Zagreb to either cease operations or to deploy to innocuous positions. These actions reduced or eliminated armed resistance to the German advance. On the same day, the 14th Panzer Division, supported by dive bombers, crossed the Drava and drove southwest towards Zagreb on snow-covered roads in extremely cold conditions. Initial air reconnaissance indicated large concentrations of Yugoslav troops on the divisional axis <b>of</b> <b>advance,</b> but these troops proved to be withdrawing towards Zagreb.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the advance}} to the Hongorai, {{there was a pause}} of about a week as the Australians had to wait for roads to be {{improved}} and supplies to be brought up, before attempting to cross the Hongorai en masse. This allowed Savige to re-evaluate the situation and to issue new orders for the advance towards the Hari and Mivo Rivers. As they waited for the advance to resume, the Australians carried out reconnaissance patrols deep into Japanese held territory and {{there were a couple of}} significant engagements during this time. As a part of these, the 24th Infantry Battalion sent a company across the Hongorai and subsequently located a strong Japanese position on a feature that became known as Egan's Ridge, which, due to its location, commanded the main Australian axis <b>of</b> <b>advance.</b>|$|E
5|$|I believe {{also two}} things. As I just said, {{there must be}} no imposition.

They can correspond in English. So I could have it as an alternate language as long as people require it and the decision for that – I would leave not to the Hindi-knowing people, but to the non-Hindi-knowing people.|$|E

5|$|In late February, ground sensors {{detected}} the 66th Regiment, 304th NVA Division preparing {{to mount an}} attack on the positions of the 37th ARVN Ranger Battalion on the eastern perimeter. On the night of 28 February the Combat Base unleashed artillery and airstrikes on possible North Vietnamese staging areas and routes <b>of</b> <b>advance.</b> At 21:30, the attack came on, but it was stifled by the small arms of the Rangers, who were supported by thousands of artillery rounds and air strikes. Two further attacks later in the morning were halted before the North Vietnamese finally withdrew. NVA, however, was not through with the ARVN troops. Five more attacks against their sector were launched during the month of March.|$|E
5|$|In {{the hours}} {{leading up to}} landfall, the TCWC in Brisbane issued 17 cyclone {{warnings}} for coastal areas. According to the BoM, residents received 20 hours <b>of</b> <b>advance</b> warning in which to complete preparations. By late on 23 December, police and ] workers were on alert for the approaching storm. High public preparedness and a relatively low loss of life were attributed to BoM cyclone awareness initiatives {{in the wake of}} 1970's deadly Cyclone Ada. However, storm victims still criticised the agency and local radio news stations for unclear, untimely, or conflicting broadcasts that caused widespread confusion. Significant delays between the issuance of warnings from TCWC Brisbane and local broadcast in the Townsville area raised some question about the need for a warning centre closer to North Queensland.|$|E
5|$|In the {{operation}} the 6th Airborne Division {{together with the}} 7th Armoured Division, the 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division and the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division, formed the I Corps, attached to the First Canadian Army.

5|$|Most of the Icelandic glaciers retreated rapidly {{during the}} warm decades from 1930 to 1960, slowing {{down as the}} climate cooled during the {{following}} decade, and started to advance after 1970. The rate <b>of</b> <b>advance</b> peaked in the 1980s, after which it slowed down until about 1990.
