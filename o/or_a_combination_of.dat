5|$|A few adult beetles may {{overlap between}} {{the spring and}} summer populations, but most adults from the earlier {{emergence}} die before the end of summer. Both adult and larval tansy beetles are unble to detect their host plant, or each other, at a distance, either by smell, sight <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> the two. Starvation is thus likely to be a major contributor to mortality when beetles wander away from their host and become lost.|$|E
5|$|As much as 80% of {{the lead}} in very high-content initial {{concentrates}} can be obtained as bullion; the remaining 20% forms a slag rich in lead monoxide. For a low-grade feed, all {{of the lead}} can be oxidized to a high-lead slag. Metallic lead is further obtained from the high-lead (25–40%) slags via submerged fuel combustion or injection, reduction assisted by an electric furnace, <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> both.|$|E

5|$|Outside of the {{seasonal}} variations, the geothermal gradient of temperatures through the crust is 25–30°C (77–86°F) per kilometer of depth {{in most of}} the world. The conductive heat flux averages 0.1MW/km2. These values are much higher near tectonic plate boundaries where the crust is thinner. They may be further augmented by fluid circulation, either through magma conduits, hot springs, hydrothermal circulation <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> these.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{geographic}} {{variation in}} the incidence of AML. In adults, the highest rates are seen in North America, Europe, and Oceania, while adult AML is rarer in Asia and Latin America. In contrast, childhood AML is less common in North America and India than in other parts of Asia. These differences may be due to population genetics, environmental factors, <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> the two.|$|E

5|$|Changes in {{direction}} {{of this nature}} are most commonly observed {{as a result of}} a cyclone's interaction with other low pressure systems, troughs, ridges, or with anticyclones. A strong and stationary anticyclone can effectively block the path of an extratropical cyclone. Such blocking patterns are quite normal, and will generally result in a weakening of the cyclone, the weakening of the anticyclone, a diversion of the cyclone towards the anticyclone's periphery, <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> all three to some extent depending on the precise conditions. It is also common for an extratropical cyclone to strengthen as the blocking anticyclone or ridge weakens in these circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Early {{fish from}} the fossil record are {{represented}} {{by a group of}} small, jawless, armored fish known as ostracoderms. Jawless fish lineages are mostly extinct. An extant clade, the lampreys may approximate ancient pre-jawed fish. The first jaws are found in Placodermi fossils. The diversity of jawed vertebrates may indicate the evolutionary advantage of a jawed mouth. It is unclear if the advantage of a hinged jaw is greater biting force, improved respiration, <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> factors.|$|E

5|$|It is {{possible}} to mimic this asymmetry in the laboratory in model bilayer systems. Certain types of very small artificial vesicle will automatically make themselves slightly asymmetric, although the mechanism by which this asymmetry is generated {{is very different from}} that in cells. By utilizing two different monolayers in Langmuir-Blodgett deposition <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> Langmuir-Blodgett and vesicle rupture deposition it is also possible to synthesize an asymmetric planar bilayer. This asymmetry may be lost over time as lipids in supported bilayers can be prone to flip-flop.|$|E
5|$|Swaying {{behaviour}} is practised by highly cryptic {{animals such as}} {{the leafy}} sea dragon and the stick insect Extatosoma tiaratum. These animals resemble vegetation with their coloration, strikingly disruptive body outlines with leaflike appendages, {{and the ability to}} sway effectively like the plants that they mimic. E. tiaratum actively sways back and forth or side to side when disturbed or when there is a gust of wind, with a frequency distribution like foliage rustling in the wind. This behaviour may represent motion crypsis, preventing detection by predators, or motion masquerade, promoting misclassification (as something other than prey), <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> the two, and has accordingly also been described as a form of motion camouflage.|$|E

After the 2007 changes to the Veterans Committee, the winner (if living) is no longer an automatic member of that body.

Exploring each level opens new paths and alternatives for accomplishing mission goals, and it is possible to complete all missions, eliminating all of Corvo's targets, in a non-lethal manner. The story and missions are changed in response to the player's violent actions or lack thereof. Magical abilities and equipment are designed to be combined to create new and varied effects.|$|E
5|$|The {{woolly mammoth}} coexisted with early humans, who used its bones and tusks for making art, tools, and dwellings, and the species was also hunted for food. It {{disappeared}} from its mainland range {{at the end}} of the Pleistocene 10,000 years ago, most likely through climate change and consequent shrinkage of its habitat, hunting by humans, <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> the two. Isolated populations survived on St. Paul Island until 5,600 years ago and Wrangel Island until 4,000 years ago. After its extinction, humans continued using its ivory as a raw material, a tradition that continues today. It has been proposed the species could be recreated through various means, but none of these are yet feasible.|$|E

5|$|A creamy-white or {{pale yellow}} stripe, bordered above with gold and below with black, extends {{from behind the}} eye, across the {{typically}} copper-coloured tympanum to the groin. This stripe rises to form a dorsolateral fold towards the groin. Another stripe of the same colour begins below the eye and continues to the shoulder. The abdomen is cream or white, and has a coarsely granular texture. The legs are green, bronze, <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> both, and the inside thigh and groin are blue-green. Mature males develop a yellowish colouration to the vocal sacs on their throats. The tympanum is distinct and ovular in shape, and the species has enlarged toe discs to aid in climbing. As this species is often found in water, the fingers are free from webbing, while the toes are almost completely webbed. When in breeding condition, males develop nuptial pads on their thumbs, which are used to grip females during mating. These are coloured brown during the breeding season, but are inconspicuous and paler {{during the rest of}} the year. During the breeding season, females develop a blueish hue on their feet, while males' legs turn rusty orange.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with most}} of the Pleistocene megafauna, Smilodon became extinct 10,000 years ago in the Quaternary {{extinction}} event. Its extinction has been linked to the decline and extinction of large herbivores, which were replaced by smaller and more agile ones like deer. Hence, Smilodon could have been too specialized at hunting large prey and may have been unable to adapt. A 2012 study of Smilodon tooth wear found no evidence that they were limited by food resources. Other explanations include climate change and competition with humans (who entered the Americas around the time Smilodon disappeared), <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> several factors, all of which apply to the general Pleistocene extinction event, rather than specifically to the extinction of the saber-toothed cats.|$|E
5|$|Around 59 {{species of}} {{pigeons and doves}} are {{threatened}} with extinction today, about 19% of all species. Most of these are tropical and live on islands. All of the species are threatened by introduced predators, habitat loss, hunting, <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> these factors. In some cases, they may be extinct in the wild, as is the Socorro dove of Socorro Island, Mexico, last seen in the wild in 1972, driven to extinction by habitat loss and introduced feral cats. In some areas, {{a lack of knowledge}} means the true status of a species is unknown; the Negros fruit dove has not been seen since 1953, and {{may or may not be}} extinct, and the Polynesian ground dove is classified as critically endangered, as whether it survives or not on remote islands in the far west of the Pacific Ocean is unknown.|$|E
