500|$|The {{relationship}} between Gilbert and Sullivan suffered its most serious breach in April 1890, during {{the run of}} The Gondoliers, when Gilbert objected to Carte's financial accounts for the production, including a charge to the partnership {{for the cost of}} new carpeting for the Savoy Theatre lobby. [...] Gilbert believed that this was a maintenance expense that should be charged to Carte alone. Carte was building a new theatre to present Sullivan's forthcoming grand opera, and Sullivan sided with Carte, {{going so far as to}} testify erroneously as to certain old debts. Gilbert took legal action against Carte and Sullivan and vowed to write no more for the Savoy, and so the partnership came to an acrimonious end. Sullivan wrote to Gilbert in September 1890 that he was [...] "physically and mentally ill over this wretched business. I have not yet got over the shock of seeing <b>our</b> <b>names</b> coupled ... in hostile antagonism over a few miserable pounds".|$|E

500|$|Imperial Bedrooms {{opens with}} an {{acknowledgement}} from Clay, the main character, {{that both the}} Less Than Zero novel and its film adaption are actual representational works within the narrative of his life: [...] "The movie {{was based on a}} book by someone we knew... It was labeled fiction but only a few details had been altered and <b>our</b> <b>names</b> weren't changed and there was nothing in it that hadn't happened." [...] The Los Angeles Times described this as a [...] "nifty little trick", as it allows Ellis to establish the newer book [...] "as the primary narrative, one that trumps Ellis as author and the real world." [...] The San Francisco Chronicle calls it a [...] "neat trick of authorial self-abnegation". Another reviewer describes it as Ellis at [...] "his most ambitious", a [...] "Philip Rothian, doppelgänger gambit", making his new narrator [...] "the real Clay" [...] and the other an imposter. This allows Ellis to skilfully, [...] "with writerly jujitsu", acknowledge Robert Downey Jr.'s popular performance as Julian in the moralistic 1987 film, in which he died; Ellis appreciates the adaptation as a [...] "milestone in a lot of ways". The device also allows the novelist to insert self-critique; The Sunday Times reviewer notes that Imperial Bedrooms finds its characters [...] "still a little sore at their depiction as inarticulate zombies". John Crace, in his [...] "digested read" [...] of Imperial Bedrooms, insinuates through parody that [...] "the author" [...] of the metafictional Less Than Zero is also meant to be Ellis, describing him in Clay's voice as [...] "too immersed in the passivity of writing and too pleased with his own style to bother with many commas to admit it so he wrote me into the story as the man who was too frightened to love." [...] With regard to the opening narrative conceit, Ellis queries [...] "Is it complication ... or is it clarification?", opining that it certainly is the latter for Clay. Even though Ellis never names himself explicitly in the book, he conceded to Lawson that one can [...] "guess [...] is who the Clay of Imperial Bedrooms is referring to." [...] Ellis did, however, reveal that he had not decided when writing the novel whether Clay was referring to him or not. Eileen Battersby likened Bedrooms to Lunar Park (2005), cited his use of [...] "self-consciousness as a device." [...] This device was picked up on by several other critics—in particular, Vice noted that [...] "the scatological violence of American Psycho" [...] and [...] "the otherworldly terror of Lunar Park" [...] had here been combined. Ellis himself raised the [...] "sequel" [...] question, commenting [...] "...I don't think it is [...] Well, I mean, it is and it isn't. It's narrated by him, sure. But I guess I could maybe have switched the names around and it could stand alone." ...|$|E

The June 1926 issue of Protesta Umana, published by their Defense Committee, carried an article signed by Sacco and Vanzetti that appealed for retaliation by their colleagues. In the article, Vanzetti wrote, [...] "I {{will try to}} see Thayer death [...] before his pronunciation of our sentence," [...] and asked fellow anarchists for [...] "revenge, revenge in <b>our</b> <b>names</b> {{and the names of}} our living and dead."

Later that year [...] Gerd and Judi Stern moved to Woodstock, New York near Garnerville, and {{arranged}} to have Callahan join them. Callahan moved in with the Sterns in Woodstock, and then the three moved into the church with the Durkees in 1965. Stern stated, [...] "Without <b>our</b> <b>names,</b> we decided to call ourselves 'USCO', the company of Us, because we were anonymous artists." [...] Callahan stated they came up with the name USCO, [...] "Company of US," [...] to create something more inclusive than using their individual names; it was also a way of [...] "bringing people together in an ad-hoc living arrangement." [...] Living not too far from the Hitchcock Estate in Millbrook, New York, they were invited to visit the communal Millbrook group; they then became involved with Timothy Leary, Richard Alpert, and Ralph Metzner.|$|E

2500|$|The {{week after}} the Ohio State game, Notre Dame faced Northwestern {{featuring}} All-American end Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. [...] Before the game, the Associated Press carried a story profiling the two players: [...] "Shakespeare and Longfellow will meet tomorrow —- not to trade verses, but to play all the football they know." [...] Longfellow later recalled, [...] "Shakespeare and I played against each other for three years. [...] Each year, because of <b>our</b> <b>names,</b> we got a terrific buildup. It was a natural, I suppose. All through my college days I never heard the end of it. The writers went wilder each year." [...] Longfellow {{got the better of}} Shakespeare in 1935, as he caught a touchdown pass to help Northwestern win the game, 14-7. [...] Shakespeare attempted to lead the Irish to another come-from-behind victory, as he ran 48 yard to the Northwestern ten-yard line late in the game, but the Northwestern defense held. [...] On the last play of the game, Shakespeare threw a [...] "long, desperate pass", but it was intercepted as time ran out.|$|E
2500|$|While Sturgis {{worked on}} Ivanhoe, Sullivan was {{composing}} The Gondoliers, with a libretto by Gilbert, for the Savoy Theatre. [...] After The Gondoliers opened and Sullivan took his annual holiday in Monte Carlo, he finally began {{the composition of}} Ivanhoe in May 1890, finishing the score in December 1890. [...] Chorus rehearsals for Ivanhoe began in November, with Alfred Cellier as chorus master, and his brother François Cellier became musical {{director of the new}} theatre. [...] In April 1890, Gilbert challenged Carte over partnership expenses at the Savoy Theatre, including a new carpet for the lobby. [...] To Gilbert's surprise and indignation, Sullivan sided with Carte – after all, Carte was producing his opera – and Gilbert sued Carte and Sullivan in May. [...] The lawsuit was ongoing during much of the period of composition of Ivanhoe, and Sullivan wrote to Gilbert in September 1890 that he was [...] "physically and mentally ill over this wretched business. [...] I have not yet got over the shock of seeing <b>our</b> <b>names</b> coupled ... in hostile antagonism over a few miserable pounds". [...] Sullivan completed the score too late to meet Carte's planned production date, and costs mounted as the producer had to pay performers, crew and others, while the theatre sat empty. [...] Sullivan was required to pay Carte a contractual penalty of £3,000 for his delay.|$|E
