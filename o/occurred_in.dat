5|$|Danny {{is notable}} for its extreme rainfall, the tornadoes {{generated}} by it, {{and the destruction}} it produced on its path, causing a total of nine fatalities and $ (1997USD, $ USD) in damage. The storm dropped a record amount of rainfall for Alabama, as at least 36.71inches (932mm) fell on Dauphin Island. Flooding, power outages, and erosion <b>occurred</b> <b>in</b> {{many areas of the}} Gulf Coast, and rescues had to be executed from flooded roadways. Tornadoes generated by Danny on the East Coast caused a great amount of damage. Of the nine fatalities caused by Danny, one happened off the coast of Alabama, four <b>occurred</b> <b>in</b> Georgia, two <b>occurred</b> <b>in</b> South Carolina, and two <b>occurred</b> <b>in</b> North Carolina.|$|E
