5|$|Henry had a {{considerable}} sexual appetite and enjoyed {{a substantial number}} of sexual partners, resulting in a large number of illegitimate children, at least nine sons and 13 daughters, many of whom he appears to have recognised and supported. It was normal for unmarried Anglo-Norman noblemen to have sexual relations with prostitutes and local women, and kings were also expected to have mistresses. Some <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>relationships</b> occurred before Henry was married, but many others took place after his marriage to Matilda. Henry had a wide range of mistresses from a range of backgrounds, and the relationships appear to have been conducted relatively openly. He may have chosen some of his noble mistresses for political purposes, but the evidence to support this theory is limited.|$|E

June Juanico of Memphis, one of Presley's early girlfriends, later blamed Parker for {{encouraging}} him to choose his dating partners with publicity in mind.

5|$|In 1934, Rona {{was back}} in Paris {{studying}} with Joliot-Curie, who had discovered artificial radioactivity. Soon after, Curie died and Rona became ill, but {{she was able to}} return to Vienna late the following year to share what had been learned with a group of researchers made up of Pettersson, Elizabeth Kara-Michailova, and Ernst Føyn, who was serving as an assistant to Ellen Gleditsch at that time. Their studies centered on research of the effect caused by bombarding radionuclides with neutrons. In 1935 Rona consolidated some <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>relationships,</b> working on Stora Bornö, then visiting Gleditsch in Oslo, then traveling to Copenhagen to see Hevesy, and later to Kålhuvudet, Sweden to meet with Karlik and Pettersson. One of the projects the group had been working on for several years was to determine if there was any correlation between water depth and radium content, and their seawater research evaluated the concentration of elements in seawater collected from different locations.|$|E

5|$|Sometime around 1850, PedroII began having {{discreet}} {{affairs with}} other women. The {{most famous and}} enduring <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>relationships</b> involved Luísa Margarida Portugal de Barros, Countess of Barral, with whom he formed a romantic and intimate, though not adulterous, friendship after she was appointed governess to the emperor's daughters in November 1856. Throughout his life, the Emperor held onto a hope of finding a soulmate, something he felt cheated of due to {{the necessity of a}} marriage of state to a woman for whom he never felt passion. This is but one instance illustrating his dual identity: one who assiduously carried out his duty in the role of emperor which destiny had assigned to him and another who considered the imperial office an unrewarding burden and who was happier in the worlds of literature and science.|$|E
5|$|The Waleses made Sandringham House their {{preferred}} residence, with Marlborough House their London base. Biographers agree that their marriage {{was in many}} ways a happy one; however, some have asserted that Albert Edward did not give his wife as much attention as she would have liked and that they gradually became estranged, until his attack of typhoid fever (the disease which was believed to have killed his father) in late 1871 brought about a reconciliation. This is disputed by others, who point out Alexandra's frequent pregnancies throughout this period and use family letters to deny the existence of any serious rift. Nevertheless, the prince was severely criticised from many quarters of society for his apparent lack of interest in her very serious illness with rheumatic fever. Throughout their marriage Albert Edward continued to keep company with other women, including the actress Lillie Langtry; Daisy Greville, Countess of Warwick; humanitarian Agnes Keyser; and society matron Alice Keppel. Alexandra knew about most <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>relationships,</b> and later permitted Alice Keppel to visit the king as he lay dying. Alexandra herself remained faithful throughout her marriage.|$|E

25|$|At {{the same}} time, many <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>relationships</b> {{might be more}} clearly {{understood}} as mentoring relationships between adult men and young boys rather than an analog of marriage. This is particularly true {{in the case of}} Sparta, where the relationship was intended to further a young boy's military training. While the relationship was generally lifelong and of profound emotional significance to the participants, it was not considered marriage by contemporary culture, and the relationship continued even after participants reached age 20 and married women, as was expected in the culture.|$|E

Another theme is about how the individual's need for expression is countered and restricted by the need for societal acceptance {{in a country that}} clung to traditions steeped in the church and strict convention. For example, in The Devil In Us she describes a convent school that uses morals to cruelly stop any type of nonconformity.|$|E

25|$|Initially, Nilsen {{experienced}} domestic contentment with Gallichan; however, {{within a}} year of their moving to Melrose Avenue, the superficial relationship between the two men began to strain. They slept in separate beds, and both began to bring home casual sexual partners. Although Gallichan insisted Nilsen had never been violent towards him, he was regularly berated by Nilsen, and by early 1976, the pair began arguing with increasing frequency. Nilsen later stated that, following a heated argument in May 1977, he had demanded Gallichan leave the residence. (Gallichan was to later inform investigators that he had himself chosen to end the relationship.) Although Nilsen formed brief relationships with several other young men over the following 18 months, none <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>relationships</b> lasted more than a few weeks, and none of the individuals expressed any intention of living with Nilsen on a permanent basis.|$|E
25|$|In {{the strictest}} sense, English folk music has existed since {{the arrival of}} the Anglo-Saxon people in Britain after 400 CE. The Venerable Bede's story of the {{cattleman}} and later ecclesiastical musician Cædmon indicates that in the early medieval period it was normal at feasts to pass around the harp and sing 'vain and idle songs'. Since this type of music was rarely notated, we have little knowledge of its form or content. Some later tunes, like those used for Morris dance, may have their origins in this period, but it is impossible to be certain <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>relationships.</b> We know from a reference in William Langland's Piers Plowman, that ballads about Robin Hood were being sung from at least by the late 14th century and the oldest detailed material we have is Wynkyn de Worde's collection of Robin Hood ballads printed about 1495.|$|E
25|$|The {{students}} of the University enjoy an unusual family tradition designed to make new students feel at home and build relationships within the student body. Traditionally, a Bejant or Bejantine acquires academic parents who are at least in their third year as students. These older students act as informal mentors in academic and social matters {{and it is not}} uncommon for such academic family ties to stretch well beyond student days. Tradition has it that a Bejant may ask a man to be his Senior Man but must be invited by a woman who is prepared to be his Senior Woman. Similarly, a Bejantine may ask a male to be her Senior Man but there is no overt rule regarding how she acquires a Senior Woman.

25|$|Loneliness is {{a common}} theme in Fassbinder's work, {{together}} {{with the idea that}} power becomes a determining factor in all human relationships. His characters yearn for love, but seem condemned to exert an often violent control over those around them. A good example is The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant (Die bitteren Tränen der Petra von Kant, 1972) which was adapted by Fassbinder from his plays. The title character is a fashion designer who lives in a self-created dreamland and the action is restricted mostly to her lavish bedroom. After the failure of her second marriage, Petra falls hopelessly and obsessively in love with Karin, a cunning working-class young woman who wants a career in modeling. The model's exploitation of Petra mirrors Petra's extraordinary psychological abuse of her silent assistant, Marlene. Fassbinder portrays the slow meltdown <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>relationships</b> as inevitable, and his actresses (there are no men in the film) move in a slow, trance-like way that hints at a vast world of longing beneath the beautiful, brittle surface.|$|E
500|$|During the 17th through 19th centuries, a woman expressing passionate {{love for}} another woman was fashionable, accepted, and encouraged. These {{relationships}} were termed romantic friendships, Boston marriages, or [...] "sentimental friends", and were {{common in the}} U.S., Europe, and especially in England. Documentation <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>relationships</b> is possible by a large volume of letters written between women. Whether the relationship included any genital component was not a matter for public discourse, but women could form strong and exclusive bonds {{with each other and}} still be considered virtuous, innocent, and chaste; a similar relationship with a man would have destroyed a woman's reputation. In fact, these relationships were promoted as alternatives to and practice for a woman's marriage to a man.|$|E

Deguchi also offered Ueshiba's services as a bodyguard to Kingoro Hashimoto, the Sakurakai's founder. Ueshiba's commitment {{to the goal of}} world peace, stressed by many biographers, must be viewed in the light <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>relationships</b> and his Ōmoto-kyō beliefs. His association with the extreme right-wing is understandable when one considers that Ōmoto-kyō's view of world peace was [...] of a benevolent dictatorship by the Emperor of Japan, with other nations being subjugated under Japanese rule.|$|E

Each <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>relationships</b> are presented as is, with Clamp carefully avoiding passing judgment on the correctness of the relationships.
