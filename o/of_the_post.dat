5|$|Another {{part of the}} 5th Division had {{gathered}} unseen below Courtnay's Post, which was held by the 14th Battalion, and at 04:00 they rushed the trench, throwing hand grenades. The post was only defended by an Australian section, two of whom were killed and another two wounded; as the Turks occupied that part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>post</b> the surviving Australians retreated. The Turks were {{now in a position}} to observe and bring fire down on Monash Valley. However, from another section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>post</b> Private Albert Jacka led a small group of men in a counter-attack on the Turks. Jacka shot five of the Turks, bayoneted another two, and chased the rest out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>post.</b> For this feat he was awarded the Victoria Cross.|$|E

The study involves a content analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>posts</b> published on <b>the</b> profiles, <b>the</b> thematic scope <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>posts,</b> {{as well as on}} <b>the</b> analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> language style <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>posts,</b> with particular consideration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> functional and discursive layer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> messages. The article presents the most typical structures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>posts,</b> as well as the most frequent discourse strategies used.

5|$|At 03:00, {{just before}} dawn, Spragg took {{command of the}} trench in the {{southern}} sector of No.3 Post, opposite where the Turks appeared to be gathering their forces to assault the post. He successfully deployed his men {{so that when the}} attack began, it was met and broken up by the New Zealanders' small arms fire. But by 03:30 the post was under sustained Turkish rifle and grenade attack and the relieving 2nd Squadron was still held up on a ridge to the south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>post.</b> Between them and No.3 Post was a strong Turkish force which had dug in and were in communication with the Turkish attackers in the gully to the north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>post.</b> However, the 2nd Squadron could now bring their own small arms fire onto the Turks attacking No.3 Post, making them keep their heads down. At daylight Elmslie led a troop in an attack which captured a Turkish trench to the left <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>post.</b> At 06:30 communications were re-established with No.3 Post by using signal flags, and Allied artillery were able to bring harassing fire onto the Turkish communications trenches. But by now the defenders were running short of supplies, especially ammunition, and no one could be spared to look after the wounded, who had to see to themselves.|$|E

5|$|Chauvel {{arrived on}} 12 May 1915 {{and took over}} the {{critical}} sector, which included Pope's Hill and Quinn's, Courtney's and Steele's Posts, from Colonel John Monash. Open to Turkish observation on two sides, these four advanced posts {{at the top of}} Monash Valley were the linchpin of the defence. Chauvel reorganised the defence, appointing permanent commanders for the posts. He also formed special sniper groups who eventually managed to suppress the Turkish snipers, making it safe even for mule trains to move up Monash Valley. Chauvel's brigade soon found itself under heavy pressure from the Turks. On 29 May 1915, the Turks fired a mine under Quinn's Post and broke into it. The permanent commander <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>post,</b> Lieutenant Colonel J. H. Cannan was absent on leave and the acting commander, Lieutenant Colonel G. J. Burnage was wounded in the fighting. Chauvel responded by bringing up reserves and appointing a temporary post commander, Lieutenant Colonel H. Pope, with orders to drive the Turks out at all costs. Major S. C. E. Herring was miraculously able to charge across the open practically unscathed, his attack having coincided with a Turkish one on another part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>post</b> so that the Turkish machine gunners could not shoot without hitting their own men. There were in fact only about seventeen Turks in the post, who eventually surrendered. Chauvel's decision may have been the wrong one, but it was decisive; he was also lucky. For this action, he was mentioned in despatches.|$|E
