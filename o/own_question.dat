On the CBS version, the challenger always began the second round (unless that contestant had matched all six stars; in this situation, the champion selected from the two questions available). This meant that a champion who had only answered one question could be ahead of a challenger who had played both questions, rendering the final question moot. On the syndicated versions, the leader after a round played first in the next round. In case of a tie score, the contestant who had not selected their <b>own</b> <b>question</b> in the previous round made the selection in the tie-breaker round.|$|E

500|$|Gig 'em: Both {{a saying}} and the thumbs up hand gesture of all Texas A University {{current and former}} {{students}} as sign of affiliation. Gig 'em also {{is the name of}} an Aggie yell. This tradition began at a 1930 Midnight Yell Practice held before the football game against the Texas Christian University Horned Frogs. In an attempt to excite the crowd, Pinky Downs, a 1906 Texas A graduate and member of the school's Board of Regents, asked the crowd [...] "What {{are we going to do}} to those Horned Frogs?"

500|$|Douglas H. Erwin, {{reviewing}} {{the book for}} Artificial Life, noted that life forms from fruit flies to humans have far fewer genes than many biologists expected – human beings have only some 20,000. [...] "How could humans, in all our diversity of cell types and complexity of neurons, require essentially {{the same number of}} genes as a fly, or worse, a worm (the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans)?" [...] asks Erwin. He answered his <b>own</b> <b>question</b> about the [...] "astonishing morphological diversity" [...] of animals coming from [...] "such a limited number of genes", praising Carroll's [...] "insightful and enthusiastic" [...] style, writing in a [...] "witty and engaging" [...] way, pulling the reader into the complexities of Hox and PAX-6, as well as celebrating the Cambrian explosion of life forms and much else.|$|E

500|$|Aggies {{today will}} often end public {{addresses}} and emails to other Aggies with a hearty [...] "Thanks and Gig 'em!". The [...] "Gig 'em" [...] tradition began at a 1930 Midnight Yell Practice held before {{the football game}} against the Texas Christian University Horned Frogs. In an attempt to excite the crowd, Pinky Downs, a 1906 Texas A graduate {{and member of the}} school's Board of Regents, asked [...] "What {{are we going to do}} to those Horned Frogs?" [...] Using a term for frog hunting, he answered his <b>own</b> <b>question,</b> [...] "Gig 'em, Aggies!" [...] For emphasis, he made a fist with the thumb extended. The phrase and hand signal proved popular, and it became the first hand sign of the Southwest Conference. Gig 'em is also the name of one of the school yells, which is used during football kickoffs.|$|E
500|$|In 1831, [...] "J. D." [...] {{wrote to}} The Magazine of Natural History, and Journal of Zoology, Botany, Mineralogy, Geology, and Meteorology about James Rennie's second edition [...] "to {{point out a}} few of its faults". He argued that the [...] "Plan of study" [...] which Rennie had added to the book was impractical, imagining the reader to have a shelf of books instead, probably, of just the one. Next, [...] "J. D." [...] {{attacked}} Rennie's [...] "use of system", declaring himself disappointed, especially by Rennie's [...] "abuse" [...] of zoologists who were systematic. He then asks rhetorically whether anyone can identify a bird using the second edition, answering his <b>own</b> <b>question</b> with [...] "that he can do so, no one will, I think, have the hardihood to advance" [...] and hence that [...] "The book, viewed in this light, {{appears to be a}} complete failure." ...|$|E

[...] David notes that the year after Modern Cookery was first published, Bird's Custard Powder was launched: [...] "What we know as modern cookery, and it {{had little to do with}} Eliza Acton's version, was on its way." [...] And she points out that manuals like Mrs Beeton's, which in later editions were edited and re-written by other hands, existed to allow cooks to look up recipes, rather than to read cookery books. She concludes that [...] "A book such as Miss Acton's, written as a coherent whole, is essentially one to be read, as it is written, with intelligence and understanding and application." ...|$|E

40|$|How do {{children}} develop their <b>own</b> <b>questions</b> to investigate in statistics? Often in school, teachers just give children questions to respond to, but rarely {{ask them to}} generate a question {{that they want to}} investigate. To write their <b>own</b> statistical <b>questions,</b> students need to envisage the processes and purpose of a statistical investigation. Curriculum documents in many countries have begun to recognise the benefits and importance of {{children develop}}ing their <b>own</b> <b>questions,</b> however little is known about children’s development in this area. This exploratory study aims to understand ways that 9 year old children can more confidently construct relevant and reasonable questions that can be answered with a statistical investigation.

He criticized the president, arguing, [...] "This president has no plan – how to win and/or how to leave". During the September 11 testimony by the General, Biden stated that the question to be asked to determine progress was [...] "Are we any closer to a lasting political settlement in Iraq at the national level today than we were when the surge began eight months ago?" [...] He answered his <b>own</b> <b>question</b> by stating [...] "In my judgment, I must tell you, based on my experience and my observation here, as well as in-country, the answer to... questions is no." [...] After the testimony concluded, Biden and other Democrats were criticized for their conduct during the deliberations.

2500|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the end of World War I, Wegner also voiced his opposition, at great risk to his own life, against the anti-semitic policies of the Nazis. In 1933, he authored an impassioned plea to Adolf Hitler on behalf of the Jews of Germany. He suggested that the persecution of the Jews was not just a question of [...] "the fate of our Jewish brothers alone, [...] the fate of Germany." [...] Noting that he was writing the letter as a proud German who could himself trace his Prussian familial roots back to the time of the Crusades, Wegner asked Hitler what would become of Germany if it continued its persecution of Jews. Answering his <b>own</b> <b>question,</b> Wegner declared, [...] "There is no Fatherland without justice!"

[...] Answering his <b>own</b> <b>question,</b> he offers that while in the contemporary political climate, [...] "One hardly needs to be Braveheart to be openly antagonistic to Israel at a meeting of anthropologists," [...] the more serious problem lies in the tradition of post-colonial studies, where anthropologists like Abu El Haj can [...] "construct their analyses with little concern for empirical or logical connectedness. Like mythology, they are masters of the found object, and pull in anything to create a story. This methodology has no connection to science. Its power lies in its politics and its aesthetics, and not in such boring ideas as validity and reliability." [...] In the same issue, Jonathan Rosenbaum, paleographer and President of Gratz College, suggests that Abu El Haj's [...] "personal agenda" [...] is [...] "the furtherance of her own nationalistic ideology at the expense of decades of careful excavations and rigorous publications" [...] establishing the historicity of much of the Biblical narrative.
