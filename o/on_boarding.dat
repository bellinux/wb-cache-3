40|$|Several {{studies have}} pointed out that {{different}} financial environments would affect the roles of bankers <b>on</b> <b>board.</b> The main {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the various functions provided by bankers on board: monitoring, expertise and (or) certification. During the two years of research period, we plan to analyze empirically the relationships between bankers <b>on</b> <b>board</b> and the firm』s debt ratio and loan terms in order to clarify the roles of bankers <b>on</b> <b>board</b> for global banks. First, since the firm』s debt ratio is an endogenous variable and would interact with bankers <b>on</b> <b>board,</b> we will employ the simultaneous regression models to estimate the relations between the debt ratio and bankers <b>on</b> <b>board.</b> In addition, the estimation will be further divided into some regressions with different dependent variables, including the lending bankers <b>on</b> <b>board,</b> non-lending bankers <b>on</b> <b>board,</b> insurance companies <b>on</b> <b>board,</b> investment banks <b>on</b> <b>board,</b> other investors <b>on</b> <b>board,</b> to detail and compare their relations with the firm』s debt ratio. Finally, we also expect to explore the effects of the tenure of bankers <b>on</b> <b>board</b> and the firm』s financial distress on the role of bankers <b>on</b> <b>board.</b> For the first year, the roles of bankers <b>on</b> <b>board</b> and the firm』s borrowing terms will be analyzed, and we plan to investigate how bankers <b>on</b> <b>board</b> influence the firm』s debt ratio in the second year of this research project. 許多研究指出不同的金融環境會影響銀行在企業董監事會所扮演的角色，本文將嘗試探討在全球國家中，銀行在企業董監事會所扮演的各種功能：監督、專業評估與（或）認證。在本計畫的兩年時間，我們預計實證分析全球的銀行進入企業董監事會與企業的負債比例以及銀行放款契約條件之間的關係，以釐清銀行在企業董監事會所扮演的各種可能角色。首先，由於銀行在企業董監事會與企業的負債比例為內生變數且彼此會相互影響，故在方法上將使用聯立迴歸模式（simultaneous regression models）同時考慮企業負債與銀行進入董監事會的關係。此外，本文除了考慮銀行進入企業董監事會之虛擬變數外，也將進一步探討董事銀行比例、非董事銀行比例、保險公司與投資銀行比例、其他投資者比例與企業負債比例之關係，以暸解上述董監事會成員之間的關係是否具有替代或互補關係。最後，本文也預計探討銀行進入企業董監事會的持續時間（tenure）及加入企業財務危機對銀行在董監事會所扮演的角色之影響，因為企業財務危機也可能會影響銀行加入企業董監事會的行為。本研究計畫預計在第一年首先進行銀行在企業董監事會與放款契約條件關係之研究，第二年則將進ㄧ步探討銀行在企業董監事會與企業資本結構之關係...|$|R

25|$|A {{successful}} ramming {{was difficult}} to achieve; {{just the right amount}} of speed and precise maneuvering were required. Fleets that did not have well-drilled, experienced oarsmen and skilled commanders relied more <b>on</b> <b>boarding</b> with superior infantry (such as increasing the complement to 40 soldiers). Ramming attempts were countered by keeping the bow towards the enemy until the enemy crew tired, and then attempting to board as quickly as possible. A double-line formation could be used to achieve a breakthrough by engaging the first line and then rushing the rearguard in to take advantage of weak spots in the enemy's defense. This required superiority in numbers, though, since a shorter front risked being flanked or surrounded.|$|E

Following the {{embarkation}} {{of the crew}} the passengers began arriving from 9:30a.m., when the London and South Western Railway's boat train from London Waterloo station reached Southampton Terminus railway station on the quayside, alongside Titanics berth. In all, 923 passengers boarded Titanic at Southampton, 179 First Class, 247 Second Class and 494 Third Class. The large number of Third Class passengers meant {{they were the first}} to board, with First and Second Class passengers following up to an hour before departure. Stewards showed them to their cabins, and First Class passengers were personally greeted by Captain Smith <b>on</b> <b>boarding.</b> Third Class passengers were inspected for ailments and physical impairments that might lead to their being refused entry to the United States – a prospect the White Star Line wished to avoid, as it would have to carry anyone who failed the examination back across the Atlantic. 922 passengers were recorded as having embarked Titanic at Southampton. Additional passengers were to be picked up at Cherbourg and Queenstown.|$|E
25|$|The {{cash fare}} for Muni Metro, like Muni buses, {{effective}} July 1, 2017, is $2.75 {{for adults and}} $1.35 for youth ages 5–17, seniors, and the disabled. Like Muni buses, the Muni Metro operates on a proof-of-payment system; on paying a fare, the passenger will receive a ticket good for travel on any bus, historic streetcar, or Metro vehicle for 90 minutes. Payment methods depend <b>on</b> <b>boarding</b> location. On surface street sections {{in the south and}} west of the city, passengers can board {{at the front of the}} train and pay their fare to the train operator to receive their ticket; those who already have a ticket, or who have a daily, weekly, or monthly pass, can board at any door of the Metro streetcar. Subway stations have controlled entries via faregates, and passengers usually purchase or show Muni staff a ticket in order to enter the platform area. Faregates closest to an unmanned Muni staff booth open automatically if a passenger has a valid pass or transfer that cannot be scanned. Muni's fare inspectors may board trains at any time to check for proof of payment from passengers.|$|E
25|$|The {{flotilla}} {{attacked the}} carrack {{in the morning}} of October 18, when most of the crew was on the shore and could not return to the ship in time. This left only about 80 Europeans on the flagship, along with an uncounted number of black slaves and Chinese merchants taking refuge on board. The Japanese boats focused <b>on</b> <b>boarding</b> the larger carrack, and at one point climbed aboard from the stern and shot a musket at Pereira, denting his helmet. The Japanese then made their way into the great cabin, briefly holding the captain-major hostage and carrying off his writing desk before being repelled. The flotilla's focus on the carrack left it exposed to the Portuguese galleon, which was able to support the carrack by catching the Japanese flotilla in the two ships' crossfire. The cannons wrought much havoc in the frail Japanese boats that the Hirado forces, after losing 3 ships and over 70 men, in addition to over 200 wounded, withdrew to their base crestfallen. The battle lasted two hours. The victorious carrack, suffering only 8 lives lost, set sail for Macao at the end of November.|$|E

500|$|Between the two work-ins, {{the rear}} dormer was {{completed}} and the fitting of noggings to the cap frame completed. This enabled a start {{to be made}} <b>on</b> <b>boarding</b> the cap on the Monday of the second work-in. The boards for the cap are ½ inch (13mm) thick and [...] wide at the petticoat, tapering towards the top. A new neck bearing was installed under the windshaft, not without difficulty and much machining before it would fit. When the boarding of the cap was completed, the cover strips were fitted over the joints. The petticoat was drawn into position using a rope and windlass, and the galvanised steel reinforcing band screwed into position, producing a sturdy structure. The striking rod was fitted through the windshaft and the axle for the fantail fitted in position {{on top of the}} fantail posts. At the top of the mill tower, the curb was prepared to accept the cap, and the cast iron curb track plates bolted into position. Repointing of the brickwork of the tower continued, with nearly half of it completed {{at the end of the}} second work-in.|$|E
500|$|After a {{particularly}} bad round of delays in May 2017, the MTA devised a [...] "six-point plan" [...] to reduce subway delays. It planned to hasten {{the delivery of}} new R211 cars; perform testing <b>on</b> <b>boarding</b> and alighting patterns at stations; post emergency medical technicians at key stations to treat sick passengers; double {{the frequency of the}} monthly track-defect detection tests; reduce bottlenecks at junctions; and reorganize the leadership hierarchy. The plan would cost $20 million and be implemented at 21 stations as a trial: nineteen stations on the heavily used IND Eighth Avenue Line between 125th Street and Fulton Street, as well as the 149th Street–Grand Concourse and Third Avenue–138th Street stations in the Bronx. These locations were chosen since they were the source of frequent bottlenecks. On the Eighth Avenue Line especially, there are an average of 25 subway-car breakdowns per month, with the average such delay lasting 19 minutes. The EMTs would be posted in five Eighth Avenue Line stations: 125th Street, 59th Street, 14th Street, West Fourth Street, and Fulton Street. There would also be an increased police presence. The improved boarding and alighting patterns might include color-coded platforms and subway cars, as well as additional signage. Finally, there would be a new chairman position to be split off of the existing CEO position. Transit commentators viewed the plan positively, regarding the plan as a small step toward increasing the subway's reliability.|$|E
