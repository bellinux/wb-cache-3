In 2002 he showed Esther Schapira, a German journalist, post-mortem images of Muhammad next to cards identifying him by name. Schapira also <b>obtained,</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> Palestinian journalist, {{what appeared to be}} footage of him arriving at the hospital on a stretcher. During an emotional public funeral in the Bureij refugee camp, Muhammad was wrapped in a Palestinian flag and buried before sundown on the day of his death, in accordance with Muslim tradition.|$|E

5|$|Earl Thomas {{granted the}} manor to his steward, Robert de Holland, in February 1308. In 1311, Robert {{obtained}} a licence to crenellate from Edward II {{in order to}} fortify the manor house, and the more modest earlier building was converted into a castle between 1311 and 1322. Local tradition says that the stone was <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> quarry {{on the site of}} what is now Melbourne Pool. The records show £1,313 was spent on the project in the year 1313–14, of which £548 was paid to masons for dressing stone. Several masons working on the project were involved in an affray at Ravenstone in 1315. The important medieval buildings in Melbourne were constructed from the local bedrock, Millstone Grit. This is a coarsely grained sandstone which can be worked to produce good-quality ashlar. The village was centred around the church, castle and High Street until the late eighteenth century.|$|E
