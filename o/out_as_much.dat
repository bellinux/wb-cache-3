5|$|On 3 August 1941, Berryman became Brigadier, General Staff (chief of staff) of I Corps under Lieutenant General John Lavarack, {{again in}} {{succession}} to Rowell, who became Deputy Chief of the General Staff (DCGS). Berryman arrived in Jakarta by air with the advanced party of the I Corps headquarters staff on 26 January 1942 to plan its defence. Berryman reconnoitred Java and prepared {{an appreciation of the}} situation. Berryman also attempted to find <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as possible about Japanese tactics through interviewing Colonel Ian MacAlister Stewart. This information found its way into papers circulated throughout the Army in Australia. It soon became apparent that the situation was hopeless and any troops committed to the defence of Java would be lost.|$|E
5|$|The Mauna Ulu {{eruption}} of Kīlauea began on May 24, 1969, and ended on July 22, 1974. At the time, Mauna Ulu {{was the longest}} flank {{eruption of}} any Hawaiian volcano in recorded history. The eruption created a new vent, covered a large area of land with lava, and added new land to the island. The eruption started as a fissure between two pit craters, Āloi and Alae, where the Mauna Ulu shield would eventually form. Both pāhoehoe and aā lava erupted from the volcano. Early on, fountains of lava burst <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as 540meters (1772ft) high. In early 1973, an earthquake occurred that caused Kīlauea to briefly stop erupting near the original Mauna Ulu site and instead erupt near the craters Pauahi and Hiiaka.|$|E

The triangular marking and the silvery band are only aligned on abdominal segment VII. The transparent wings have white spots {{on the base of}} the costae. With older mosquito specimens, the scales could be partially worn off, making these characteristics not stand <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>much.</b>|$|E

In some places, like west of Ireland, the geoid—mathematical mean sea level—sticks <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as 100 m above the regular, rotationally symmetric reference ellipsoid of GRS80; in other places, like close to Ceylon, it dives under the ellipsoid by nearly the same amount. The separation between these two surfaces is called the undulation of the geoid, symbol , and {{is closely related to}} the disturbing potential.|$|E

Older shrines are often seen incorporating Islamic elements such as the crescent moon and inscriptions in jawi. Inside the simple room, a small, decorated statue depicting the Datuk is venerated.

25|$|As a writer, {{poetry is}} {{basically}} Changmarín's fundamental tool of expression. Once {{established as a}} consecrated poet, he reached an outstanding moment in his creation with the book of poetry entitled Poemas Corporales (Corporeal Poems), which was awarded the Ricardo Miró National Award in 1955. With this work, Changmarín showed himself as a developed poet who has achieved great control over this literary form. Changmarín leaves <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as possible, which mirrors the trends of the time. This clarity serves as a method to deliver {{the social and political}} messages, as most of his works are fundamental. His mastery of the decasyllable writing imprints Poemas Corporales with a classical accent comparable to the Quevedo Verses.|$|E
25|$|An archaeological {{investigation}} {{usually involves}} several distinct phases, {{each of which}} employs its own variety of methods. Before any practical work can begin, however, a clear objective {{as to what the}} archaeologists are looking to achieve must be agreed upon. This done, a site is surveyed to find <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as possible about it and the surrounding area. Second, an excavation may take place to uncover any archaeological features buried under the ground. And, third, the data collected from the excavation is studied and evaluated in an attempt to achieve the original research objectives of the archaeologists. It is then considered good practice for the information to be published so that it is available to other archaeologists and historians, although this is sometimes neglected.|$|E
25|$|This {{challenge}} {{was an early}} start for the 4 remaining finalists Bill, Sophie, Fenton and David. It began at the fish markets in Sydney's Chinatown where Ben explained the art of finding a fresh fish. Each finalist asked around to find <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> information as they could about a fish they had never cooked before. Fenton {{was so impressed with}} the filleting of the salmon that he wanted to meet the man responsible. Turned out it was the No. 1 salmon filleter in NSW. At the docks, 4 BBQ's were set up and each contestant was given 60 seconds to look down the barrel of the camera and talk about how they would prepare this fish, as though they were hosting a show. This was a test to see how much of the information they could retain and deliver to an audience in a simple to understand language. A Teppanyaki Chef came out and gave the finalists a crash course in the ancient Japanese technique. For the final challenge the remaining 4 were taken to a Teppanyaki restaurant and asked to cook a meal for the judges using the technique. Each contestant was judged on the ability to talk and cook at the same time while using techniques that they were all unfamiliar with. The judges then decided they would send one home who they thought was 'throwing' the contest.|$|E

500|$|Chris Greening of Square Enix Music Online, in {{his review}} of the album, reacted {{positively}} to the score, calling it a [...] "colourful, diverse, and rich experience overall". He called the tracks by Iwata and Aikara the [...] "core" [...] of the album, saying that the tracks by Ito felt [...] "banal" [...] and [...] "formulaic" [...] which he attributed to Ito being too overworked {{to focus on the}} album. RPGamer, in their review of the game, called the music [...] "pretty nice". They noted that the music did not stand <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as the visuals of the game, though they still [...] "conveyed the theme", and that the [...] "town" [...] tracks were in their opinion weaker {{than the rest of the}} soundtrack.|$|E

Burns has said commented the episode [...] "ended up being incredibly short because when you do an episode where there's really just one good side of an argument , you don't fill <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> time as you need to." [...] The opening sequence features {{a large number of}} allusions to popular culture, including references to The Natural (1984 film), Happy Days (television sitcom), and Men in Black (1997 film).|$|E

The Simpson trial was the number-one news story for NBC and CBS in 1995, while at ABC, coverage of the War in Bosnia and Herzegovina dominated the newscast. Jennings stated in a 1996 interview that he was satisfied that ABC came in third in terms of O.J. coverage. [...] "I'm very pleased that it didn't crowd <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> {{of the rest of}} the world on World News Tonight as it did on other broadcasts," [...] he said.

500|$|Penn's captain, Bill Hollenback, said: “This fellow Schulz is {{a monster}} {{in size and}} a perfect athlete. [...] He is both wonderfully agile and fast {{for a man of}} his size. [...] In our game with Michigan, we had two men {{instructed}} to play against Schulz and at times three and four were opposed to him. [...] For some time, he handed <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as we passed to him in the roughing end of the game. [...] He was here, there and everywhere. He did most of the tackling. [...] He broke up innumerable plays. [...] He was the star of the contest until the continued battering of our men injured him {{to such an extent that}} he had to retire. [...] The rest was easy". [...] Coach Yost said of Schulz's performance: [...] "He gave the greatest one-man exhibition of courage I ever saw on a football field".|$|E
500|$|The whole {{song was}} written without that main sample; {{it was a}} last-minute thing. The song had kind {{of a lot of}} R music in it. And Kanye gave marching orders of [...] "Take out {{anything}} you want, but don't add. Just take away." [...] Like, [...] "OK." [...] And before that, we listened to the sample together and thought, [...] "Hmm, maybe there's a way to integrate this into the song." [...] So we started by getting the sample to work in the song, and then taking <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> stuff as we could, and then in the chorus reducing what was this whole musical thing, just this sort of one ugly, distorted bass note. I was thinking like Alan Vega and Suicide, that kind of noise-synth minimal vibe. So that was the idea behind the chorus: Take it from this sort of R thing and turn it into this kind of post-punk, edge thing. And the lyrics he wrote were so good and funny. It just turned into a really good record. The sample is so good.|$|E

In MSN Music, Robert Christgau deemed Drake [...] "neither thug nor thug wannabe ... plenty talented, but pretty shallow and without much focus as a mack". He wrote of the record: [...] "Pleasing and hookful though it be, [...] consistently bemoans the confusing emoluments and accoutrements of fame". Pete Cashmore from NME believed [...] "it's those constant and predictable superstar interjections that prevent the album from standing <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as it had potential to do." [...] Slant Magazines Jesse Cataldo viewed Drake's [...] "insistent navel-gazing" [...] as a flimsy [...] "concept", but commended the album for [...] "nail confused introspection in a genre famous for willful misrepresentation of self." ...|$|E

Armed guards were stationed around the palace, ostensibly for [...] "the group's own danger from British secret agents", and armed guides escorted them on their journeys. For nearly three weeks, Emir Habibullah, reportedly in his summer palace at Paghman, responded with only polite noncommittal replies to requests for an audience. An astute politician, he was in no hurry to receive his guests; he used the time to find <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as he could about the expedition members and liaised with British authorities at New Delhi. It was only after Niedermayer and von Hentig threatened to launch a hunger strike that meetings began. In the meantime, von Hentig learnt {{as much as he could}} about his eccentric host. Emir Habibullah was, by all measures, the lord of Afghanistan. He considered it his divine right to rule and the land his property. He owned the only newspaper, the only drug store, and all the automobiles in the country (all Rolls Royces).|$|E
500|$|Their {{grandmother}} {{preferred to}} raise them simply, and they made their own clothes. A new governess from Switzerland, Madame Gelieux, was appointed, giving the children lessons in French; as was common for royal and aristocratic children of the time, Louise became fluent and literate in the language, while neglecting her own native German. She received religious instruction from a clergyman of the Lutheran Church. Complementary to her lessons was an emphasis on charitable acts, and Louise would often accompany her governess when visiting the houses {{of the poor and}} needy. Louise was encouraged to give <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as was in her means, although she often got into trouble with her grandmother for donating too much for charity. From the age of ten until her marriage at 17, Louise spent most of her time in the presence of her grandmother and governess, both well-educated and refined. When only nine years old, Louise was present when the poet Friedrich Schiller read from the first act of [...] "Don Carlos" [...] for the entertainment of the assembled court, thus sparking her love for German as a literary language, especially works of Schiller. Louise loved history and poetry, and not only enjoyed reading Schiller, but also came to like the works of Goethe, Paul, Herder and Shakespeare, as well as ancient Greek tragedies.|$|E

Sandy Masuo of the Los Angeles Times likened [...] "Worry Rock" [...] to the music of Elvis Costello. [...] "Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)" [...] has been referred to as a [...] "pop-punk campfire singalong ballad".

[...] "Last Ride In" [...] is a surf rock-influenced instrumental, and [...] "King for a Day" [...] is a ska punk song featuring a horn section. [...] Armstrong compared the song to the Oi! genre, and noted [...] "It would be funny for a bunch of macho fraternity guys to be singing along and, little do they know, the song's about being in drag."
