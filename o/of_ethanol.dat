40|$|Abstract. This paper {{analyzes}} {{the relationship between}} crude oil price and fuel ethanol firm profit. Corn is the main raw material for fuel ethanol in China. According to our survey <b>of</b> fuel <b>ethanol</b> firms, three tons of corn input can produce one ton <b>of</b> fuel <b>ethanol</b> output technically, so we can estimate cost <b>of</b> fuel <b>ethanol</b> firms. Government <b>of</b> some provinces mandated gasoline with 10 % ethanol fuel for environmental protection. Sinopec and PetroChina paid to the fuel ethanol firms in accordance with 0. 911 times of gasoline price, so we can estimate earnings. Government can determine the subsidies <b>of</b> fuel <b>ethanol</b> firms based on estimation of their profit...|$|R

5|$|He {{favors a}} strong {{immigration}} border policy and a guest worker program. In terms of energy policy, he's argued {{in favor of}} flex-fuel mandates for cars sold in the U.S. and promoted the use <b>of</b> <b>ethanol</b> generally.|$|E
5|$|The E85 blend {{is used in}} {{gasoline}} engines modified to accept such higher concentrations <b>of</b> <b>ethanol,</b> and the fuel injection is regulated through a dedicated sensor, which automatically detects the amount <b>of</b> <b>ethanol</b> in the fuel, allowing to adjust both fuel injection and spark timing accordingly to the actual blend available in the vehicle's tank. Because ethanol contains close to 34% less energy per unit volume than gasoline, E85 FFVs have a lower mileage per gallon than gasoline. Based on EPA tests for all 2006 E85 models, the average fuel economy for E85 vehicles was 25.56% lower than unleaded gasoline.|$|E
5|$|Brazil {{has one of}} {{the largest}} {{renewable}} energy programs in the world, involving production <b>of</b> <b>ethanol</b> fuel from sugar cane, and ethanol now provides 18 percent of the country's automotive fuel. As a result of this and the exploitation of domestic deep water oil sources, Brazil, which for years had to import a large share of the petroleum needed for domestic consumption, recently reached complete self-sufficiency in liquid fuels.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{serviceability}} <b>of</b> hydrous <b>ethanol</b> as a clean, cheap and green renewable substitute fuel for spark ignition engines and discusses the comparative chemical and physical properties <b>of</b> hydrous <b>ethanol</b> and gasoline fuels. The {{significant differences in}} the properties <b>of</b> hydrous <b>ethanol</b> and gasoline fuels are sufficient to create a significant change during the combustion phase of engine operation and consequently affect the performance of spark-ignition (SI) engines. The stability of ethanol-gasoline-water blends is also discussed. Furthermore, the effects <b>of</b> hydrous <b>ethanol,</b> and its blends with gasoline fuel on SI engine combustion characteristics, cycle-to-cycle variations, engine performance parameters, and emission characteristics have been highlighted. Higher water solubility in ethanol‑gasoline blends may be obviously useful and suitable; nevertheless, the continuous ability of water to remain soluble in the blend is significantly affected by temperature. Nearly all published engine experimental results showed a significant improvement in combustion characteristics and enhanced engine performance for the use <b>of</b> hydrous <b>ethanol</b> as fuel. Moreover, carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen emissions were also significantly decreased. It is also worth pointing out that unburned hydrocarbon and carbon dioxide emissions were also reduced for the use <b>of</b> hydrous <b>ethanol.</b> However, unregulated emissions such as acetaldehyde and formaldehyde were significantly increased...|$|R

5|$|Brazil’s {{production}} <b>of</b> <b>ethanol</b> {{fuel from}} sugarcane {{dates back to}} the 1970s, as a governmental response to the 1973 oil crisis. Brazil is considered the biofuel industry leader and the world's first sustainable biofuels economy. In 2010 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency designated Brazilian sugarcane ethanol as an advanced biofuel due to EPA's estimated 61% reduction of total life cycle greenhouse gas emissions, including direct indirect land use change emissions.|$|E

50|$|Alcohol {{by volume}} (abbreviated as ABV, abv, or alc/vol) is a {{standard}} measure of how much alcohol (ethanol) is contained in a given volume of an alcoholic beverage (expressed as a volume percent). It {{is defined as the}} number of millilitres (mL) <b>of</b> pure <b>ethanol</b> present in 100 mL of solution at 20 C. The number of millilitres <b>of</b> pure <b>ethanol</b> is the mass <b>of</b> the <b>ethanol</b> divided by its density at 20 °C, which is 0.78924 g/mL. The ABV standard is used worldwide.

Brazilian carmakers modified gasoline engines to support ethanol characteristics and changes included compression ratio, amount of fuel injected, replacement of materials that would get corroded by the contact with ethanol, use of colder spark plugs suitable for dissipating heat due to higher flame temperatures, and an auxiliary cold-start system that injects gasoline from a small tank in the engine compartment to help starting when cold.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture has {{historically}} been {{a key component of}} the South Dakota economy. Although other industries have expanded rapidly in recent decades, agricultural production is still very important to the state's economy, especially in rural areas. The five most valuable agricultural products in South Dakota are cattle, corn (maize), soybeans, wheat, and hogs. Agriculture-related industries such as meat packing and ethanol production also have a considerable economic impact on the state. South Dakota {{is one of the largest}} producers <b>of</b> <b>ethanol</b> in the nation.|$|E

30|$|Large-scale {{production}} <b>of</b> lignocellulosic <b>ethanol</b> {{including both}} bagasse and SCAR energy. FSOTD second-generation ethanol maximization variant hereafter is referred also as FSOTDethanol. The second pathway of sugar factory FSOTDethanol {{will be possible}} by the large-scale production <b>of</b> lignocellulosic <b>ethanol</b> in sugar facilities. Lignocellulosic ethanol is produced initially from sugarcane solid residues (bagasse and SCAR). Lignocellulosic ethanol is also called second-generation ethanol because its production does not compete with sugar produced from sugarcane juice {{such as in the}} case <b>of</b> traditional <b>ethanol.</b> In this case, unlike the first pathway, it maximizes ethanol production. The advantage of this scheme is that residue energy can be stored and used in the off-season period or anytime independently from its production date. The disadvantage <b>of</b> lignocellulosic <b>ethanol</b> is that ethanol production requires large quantities of water and the disposal of vinasse.h Figure  6 shows the scheme of an FSOTDethanol factory.|$|R

5|$|Silver fulminate, AgCNO, a powerful, touch-sensitive {{explosive}} used in percussion caps, {{is made by}} {{reaction of}} silver metal with nitric acid in the presence <b>of</b> <b>ethanol.</b> Other dangerously explosive silver compounds are silver azide, AgN3, formed by reaction of silver nitrate with sodium azide, and silver acetylide, Ag2C2, formed when silver reacts with acetylene gas in ammonia solution. In its most characteristic reaction, silver azide decomposes explosively, releasing nitrogen gas: given the photosensitivity of silver salts, this behaviour may be induced by shining a light on its crystals.|$|E
5|$|The {{flexibility}} of Brazilian FFVs empowers the consumers {{to choose the}} fuel depending on current market prices. As ethanol fuel economy is lower than gasoline because of ethanol's energy content is close to 34% less per unit volume than gasoline, flex cars running on ethanol get a lower mileage than when running on pure gasoline. However, this effect is partially offset by the usually lower price per liter <b>of</b> <b>ethanol</b> fuel. As a rule of thumb, Brazilian consumers are frequently advised by the media to use more alcohol than gasoline in their mix only when ethanol prices are 30% lower or more than gasoline, as ethanol price fluctuates heavily depending on the result of seasonal sugar cane harvests.|$|E
