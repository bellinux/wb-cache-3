They also competed in Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling, where they became the inaugural NWA Atlantic Coast Tag Team Champions. They held the title belts four times between 1968 and 1971 while feuding with George Becker and Johnny Weaver. During that time, they also won the IWA World Tag Team Championship while competing in Tasmania. While in the Carolinas, Hanson and Hawk {{spent a lot of}} time with Ric Flair when Flair entered the wrestling business. Hawk stated that Flair used to cause trouble for the group, including one incident in which Flair flirted with the girlfriend of a Mafia member. Hanson and Hawk used their friendship with the Mafia member to help Flair escape from being killed in revenge.|$|E

25|$|With the {{outbreak}} of the Korean War and McCarthyism in the early 1950s, Vietnamese anti-communists were a sought-after commodity in the United States. Diệm and Thục were given a reception at the State Department with the Acting Secretary of State James Webb, where Thục did much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>talking.</b> Diệm also made links with Cardinal Francis Spellman, the most politically influential cleric of his time. Spellman had studied with Thục in Rome in the 1930s and became one of Diệm's most powerful advocates. Diệm managed an audience with Pope Pius XII in Rome with his brother's help. Spellman helped Diệm to garner support among right-wing and Catholic circles. As French power in Vietnam declined, Diệm’s support in America, which Thục helped to nurture, made his stock rise. Bảo Đại made Diệm the Prime Minister of the State of Vietnam because he thought Diệm's connections would secure funding.|$|E

It is obvious that Mary has already taken some of her “prescription.” She talks about her past in a Catholic convent and the promise she once had as a pianist {{and the fact that it}} was once thought that she might become a nun. She also makes it clear that while she fell in love with her husband from the time she met him, she had never taken to the theatre crowd. She shows her arthritic hands to Cathleen and explains that the pain in her hands is why she needs her prescription – an explanation which is untrue and transparent to Cathleen.|$|E

[...] When Ferb does speak, it is almost always a single sentence.

500|$|The {{issue of}} trust was {{difficult}} to overcome. [...] Wooden Leg himself relates {{the attitudes of the}} Cheyenne at a peace feast organised to commemorate the 30th anniversary (1906) of the Battle of the Little Bighorn. [...] In the presence of many United States soldiers, the Cheyenne were questioned about the battle. [...] They answered with extreme caution; many facts, particularly regarding the deaths of US soldiers, were avoided. [...] Despite the long passage of time since the battle, they feared that they were being trapped into incriminating admissions. [...] They also chose not to reveal that they believed that many soldiers had died through suicide or at the hands of their comrades, as they knew this issue had made soldiers angry in the past. [...] They left most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>talking</b> to one boastful Indian, Two Moons, who gave a colourful—but entirely inaccurate—account. [...] The others elected not to contradict him since this allowed them to remain silent. [...] Marquis slowly broke down the barriers and eventually persuaded all the Cheyenne survivors he was in contact with, not just Wooden Leg, to open up to him.|$|E
500|$|In the {{original}} pitch to overseas The Walt Disney Company executives, Povenmire and Marsh constructed storyboards and recorded them with dialogue and sound-effects.

Although Ferb's taciturnity is generally not commented on in the series, Phineas mentions it while he and his brother were in England on the episode [...] "A Hard Day's Knight": [...] "I'll be the top half since I tend to do more <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>talking</b> and you will be on the bottom part because of your long spindely legs".
