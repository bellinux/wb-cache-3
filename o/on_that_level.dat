5|$|The player {{generally}} has {{to explore the}} dungeon to reveal its contents similar to a fog of war. Many roguelikes include factors related to light sources such as a torch to provide illumination to see monsters in nearby squares, and line of sight can also limit what monsters are visible. Dungeons tend to be connected by stairs; lower dungeon levels generally are more difficult than higher ones, so that a character that is underdeveloped may have difficulty by progressing too fast. Dungeon levels and the population of monsters and treasure within them are generated randomly using procedural generation, so that no game is the same on subsequent playthroughs. Most roguelikes have an ultimate goal of either claiming an item located at the deepest level of the dungeon, or to defeat a specific monster that lives <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>level.</b> Typical roguelikes include a scoreboard, ranking the player's performance once their game is over (be it through permadeath or completing the objective) based {{on the amount of}} treasure, money, and experience earned, and how fast the player completed the game in such cases.|$|E

50|$|Recording for Grip It! <b>On</b> <b>That</b> Other <b>Level</b> {{began in}} 1988, and reached {{completion}} in early 1989. The album was well {{received in the}} Hip hop community, and gave the group exposure in the east coast and west coast, where southern hip hop was previously ignored.

25|$|As {{soon as the}} Basinghall Mining Syndicate {{took control}} of the mine in 1936 urgent repair work was done on both Smith's Shaft and Murray's Shaft. The 150Fathom Level had flooded and needed to be pumped out, and roof falls on other levels needed {{clearing}}. After buying the mine in 1937 the Lucy Tongue Level was refurbished. Roof falls needed clearing and retimbering, the worst of the sharp bends were straightened out, and some narrow stone-arched sections were rebuilt. All the rails were replaced, as was the nearly fifty-year-old locomotive, and new side-tipping wagons were introduced. At the same time Murray's Shaft was deepened and a new 175Fathom Level was begun from the bottom. A small battery locomotive was installed for tramming <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>level.</b> Horses were still used on the other levels, but in time they too were replaced by battery locomotives.|$|E
500|$|Overall, reviewers saw Flow {{as being}} more akin to an art piece than a game. Navarro called it an [...] "arty piece of gaming", and complimentarily said that it had the [...] "vibe of an art-school project".

Roper summarized Flow as [...] "not so much a game as it is an experience", and Mitchell claimed that it [...] "tries to do something entirely unique and experimental, and <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>level,</b> it succeeds".|$|E

The song [...] "Do it Like a G.O." [...] was the album's only single used for promotion. Grip It! was well {{received}} in the hip hop community, and {{was considered to be}} the group's breakout album, as it gave them national exposure and eventually sold 500,000 copies. A year after its release, super-producer Rick Rubin remixed 10 of its tracks for the 1990 remix album The Geto Boys.

500|$|Some have {{suggested}} that Plath had not intended to kill herself. That morning, she asked her downstairs neighbor, a Mr.Thomas, what time he would be leaving. She also left a note reading [...] "Call Dr.Horder," [...] including the doctor's phone number. Therefore, it is argued Plath turned on the gas {{at a time when}} Mr.Thomas {{would have been able to}} see the note. However, in her biography Giving Up: The Last Days of SylviaPlath, Plath's best friend, Jillian Becker wrote, [...] "According to Mr.Goodchild, a police officer attached to the coroner's office... had thrust her head far into the gas oven... had really meant to die." [...] Dr.Horder also believed her intention was clear. He stated that [...] "No one who saw the care with which the kitchen was prepared could have interpreted her action as anything but an irrational compulsion." [...] Plath had described the quality of her despair as [...] "owl's talons clenching my heart." [...] In his 1971 book on suicide, friend and critic Al Alvarez claimed that Plath's suicide was an unanswered cry for help, and spoke, in a BBC interview in March2000, about his failure to recognize Plath's depression, saying he regretted his inability to offer her emotional support: [...] "I failed her <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>level.</b> I was thirtyyears old and stupid. What did I know about chronic clinical depression? [...] She kind of needed someone to take care of her. And that was not something I could do." ...|$|E
500|$|McFeely {{said that}} the idea of basing a film on [...] "Civil War" [...] had [...] "been on and off the table for a while" [...] at Marvel Studios, explaining, [...] "it's a {{challenge}} to do it and make sure that all the characters that we've established, and everyone's established in the MCU are serviced and sound correct. Because there's a difference between the characters in [...] "Civil War", which was written in 2006, 2007. The MCU doesn't exist [...] There isn't a Robert Downey, Jr. or Chris Evans who has helped create the character so {{we need to make sure}} that that template gets adjusted". Joe Russo added that the [...] "essence" [...] of [...] "Civil War" [...] was used, such as [...] "the concept of registration, the notion that heroes need to be either monitored or controlled because their power can be scary" [...] being applicable. Anthony Russo expanded, [...] "in a lot of ways [...] can be a political issue, and we didn't want the conflict of the movie to solely exist <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>level.</b> We wanted to figure out very personal reasons why everyone's relationship to this idea of registration is going to become complicated. That's what the relationship between Steve and Bucky allowed us to do, to get very personal in terms of why people would lean one way or the other." [...] Executive producer Nate Moore added that [...] "it felt like it was kind of the right time" [...] to adapt [...] "Civil War" [...] given The Avengers, plus many of the Phase Two films ( [...] , The Winter Soldier, and Avengers: Age of Ultron), all dealt with [...] "world-ending experiences. We felt like we had to tell the next step in that story, which is ... what is the world's reaction?" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} was filmed on August 6, 7 and 8, 1998, and was {{directed}} by Nigel Dick. After being chosen, Dick received criticism from his colleagues about wanting to work with Spears. He responded saying, [...] "It's a great song. I don't know anything about Britney. I never watched The Mickey Mouse Club. She seems like a great kid and she's very enthusiastic, but I just love the song. It's just a great song". The video's original setup was in high contrast to what eventually became the final product. The plan {{was to have the}} video in a cartoon-like environment, in a likely attempt to attract the audience of younger children. Spears was unhappy with this, and argued that she wanted her video to reflect the lives of her fans and wanted to set the video in a school. Spears pitched this idea to Dick, and further explained she wanted the video to have dance scenes. The original setting was scrapped and replaced with Spears's concept. Dick's original idea for the wardrobe was jeans and a T-shirt, but during the wardrobe fitting Spears decided to change it for a schoolgirl outfit. Dick said that [...] "Every piece of wardrobe in the video came from Kmart, and I was told at the time not one piece of clothing in the video cost more than $17. <b>On</b> <b>that</b> <b>level,</b> it's real. That probably, in retrospect, is a part of its charm." [...] The knotted shirt design was Spears's idea, she recollects saying, [...] "The outfits looked kind of dorky, so I was like, 'Let's tie up our shirts and be cute'". About the experience of shooting her first music video, Spears said, [...] "It was a wonderful experience. All these people there, working for you. I had my own trailer. It was an amazing experience". The music video was shot at Venice High School, the same school used to film the movie Grease. The video premiered on MTV and other video stations in November 1998.|$|E

2500|$|Philip W. Chung of AsianWeek {{said that}} Eastwood, portraying a White man, was the [...] "main weapon" [...] {{of the film}} even though screenwriter Nick Schenk [...] "does his best to portray Hmong culture and the main Hmong {{characters}} with both depth and cultural sensitivity". Chung argued that [...] "Gran Torino might have been another [...] "“white man saves the day” story" [...] but that [...] "What Eastwood has really created is not {{a story about the}} white man saving the minority (though it can be read <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>level</b> and I’m sure some will) but a critical examination of an iconic brand of white macho maleness that he played a significant part in creating." ...|$|E

[...] The old House Chamber is larger, with a curvilinear mezzanine on three walls that merges into each side wall before reaching the lectern platform wall.|$|E
2500|$|Owen Gleiberman, {{writing for}} Entertainment Weekly, gave the film a B+ and said, [...] "Set {{in the early}} '50s, in the New Zealand village of Christchurch, this ripe {{hallucination}} of a movie — a rhapsody in purple — has been photographed in sun-drenched candy color that lends it the surreal clarity of a dream... There's something bracing about the way that Heavenly Creatures serves up its heroines' fantasies with literal-minded brute force." [...] Gleiberman complains that Jackson never quite explains [...] "why the two girls have metamorphosed into the '50s teenybop answer to Leopold and Loeb," [...] yet concludes, [...] "Still, if the pleasures of Heavenly Creatures remain defiantly on the surface, <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>level</b> the movie is a dazzler." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{stretch of}} canal between locks {{is called a}} level. Canalers called these levels by their lengths; for instance, the longest level was the 14 mile level, which was about 14 miles long, and ran from Lock 50 (at 4 locks) to Lock 51 in Hancock. Some levels had {{additional}} nicknames (since some had similar lengths), e.g. [...] "Four Mile Level below Dam 6", [...] "Four Mile Level Big Slackwater", or [...] "Four Mile Level of the Log Wall" [...] (which is between locks 14 and 15, includes Widewater, Anglers, Carderock, Billy Goat Trails B, and C, and the downstream entrance to Trail A, all connect <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>level)</b> Levels {{less than a mile}} between locks were called short levels.

2500|$|AllMusic, however, gave a more lukewarm review, {{giving it}} 3/5 stars, saying: [...] "It's what Kelly wanted to do, so <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>level</b> it's a success, {{and one that}} {{listeners}} who share her viewpoint (and quite likely her age) will respond to but for everybody else, My December is a disappointment." [...] Commenting on Clarkson's feud with her record label, they also claimed: [...] "My December proves that both camps were correct: Davis is correct {{that there are no}} big crossover hits here, yet it's also true that this is an artistic move that Clarkson needed to make. If left up to Davis, she would simply be another vocalist singing professional product." [...] Rolling Stone, giving a similar lukewarm review, wrote: [...] "Clarkson clobbers you over the head with her emotions and arena-ready choruses.

Orchard wrote {{that he had been}} paid to plant the dynamite by Mr. Davis, the president of the Altman local, one of the WFM locals in the Cripple Creek district. When they heard nothing about an explosion during the next few days, they assumed that their bomb had failed to explode. But they had mistakenly set the bomb on an inactive level, and it did not go off until some time later, when the superintendent and the shift boss got off to inspect the 600-foot level, and set off the dynamite.|$|E

2500|$|In early 1983, Mitchell began a world tour, visiting Japan, Australia, Ireland, the United Kingdom, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy and Scandinavia {{and then}} {{going back to the}} United States.

As 1984 ended, Mitchell was writing new songs, when she received a suggestion from Geffen that perhaps an outside producer with experience in the modern technical arenas that they wanted to explore might be a worthy addition. British synthpop performer and producer Thomas Dolby was brought on board. Of Dolby's role, Mitchell later commented: [...] "I was reluctant when Thomas was suggested because he had been asked to produce the record , and would he consider coming in as just a programmer and a player?

2500|$|Stephen Holden in The New York Times {{praised the}} [...] "taut, {{economical}} screenplay" [...] that [...] "digs into its characters' marrow (and into the perfectly selected details of domestic life) without wasting a word. That screenplay helps to ground a film whose visual imagination hovers somewhere between soap opera and a portentous pop surrealism." [...] USA Today gave the film three-and-a-half stars {{out of four}} and Mike Clark wrote, [...] "Diane Lane also reaches a new career plateau with her best performance since 1979's A Little Romance." [...] In his review for the Washington Post, Stephen Hunter wrote, [...] "In the end, Unfaithful leaves you dispirited and grumpy: All that money spent, all that talent wasted, all that time gone forever, and for what? It's an ill movie that bloweth no man to good." [...] David Ansen, in his review for Newsweek, wrote, [...] "Unfaithful shows what a powerful, sexy, smart filmmaker Lyne can be. It's a shame he substitutes the mechanics of suspense for the real suspense {{of what goes on}} {{between a man and a}} woman, a husband and a wife." [...] Andrew Sarris, in his review for The New York Observer, wrote, [...] "Ultimately Unfaithful is escapism in its purest form, and I am willing to experience it <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>level,</b> even though with all the unalloyed joy on display, there's almost no humor," [...] and concluded that it was [...] "one of the very few mainstream movies currently directed exclusively to grown-ups." ...|$|E

I had always found him a very interesting and innovative filmmaker. I liked the script very much and I liked the group involved and the process interested me a great deal also." [...] He found the experience of working with motion capture to be similar to his experiences working in the theater. He also found the process intriguing: [...] "Say you do a normal day of filmmaking. Sometimes that’s 1/8 of a page, sometimes it’s 3/8th of a page, normally let’s say it’s 2½ pages, maybe 3. Now it’s probably a little more {{than it used to be}} but not always. So you may be acting for a total of 20 minutes a day. In this, you act the entire day all the time except for the tiny amount of time it takes them to sort of coordinate the computer information, let’s say, and make sure that the computers are reading the data and that you’re transmitting the data. It interests me <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>level</b> because I’m a professional actor so I’d just as soon act as sit around."
