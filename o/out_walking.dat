5|$|Within the verse, Coleridge {{seeks to}} {{discover}} the environment that his friends are exploring because {{he is unable to}} join them. The poem links the lime-tree bower to the Quantocks where the Wordsworths, Lamb and Fricker were <b>out</b> <b>walking.</b> Although he is separated from them, the poet connects to his distant friends and they are able to share in a common view on life. The poem describes Coleridge's loneliness and solitude throughout, yet he is glad that his friends are able to experience nature. Because of this, he is able to tolerate his prison, which he views as merely physical rather than intellectual.|$|E
5|$|During {{a welcome}} dinner at Barton Park, Sir John {{introduces}} the Dashwoods to his wife, Lady Middleton (Rosanna Lavelle); her mother, Mrs. Jennings (Linda Bassett); {{and their family}} friend, Colonel Brandon (David Morrissey). Brandon instantly {{falls in love with}} Marianne, but she believes he is too old for her. While <b>out</b> <b>walking</b> with Margaret, Marianne falls and twists her ankle. She is rescued by a young man, who carries her back to the cottage. He introduces himself as John Willoughby (Dominic Cooper), and states that he will return to check on Marianne the following day. Brandon also comes to visit, but upon seeing Willoughby, he quickly departs. Willoughby and Marianne grow close through their mutual love of poetry, and he later takes a lock of her hair. Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor begin to speculate on whether they have become secretly engaged.|$|E

5|$|Elfriede died in October 1970, and Segrè married Rosa Mines in February 1972. That year {{he reached}} the University of California's {{compulsory}} retirement age. He continued teaching the history of physics. In 1974 {{he returned to the}} University of Rome as a professor, but served only a year before reaching the mandatory retirement age. Segrè died from a heart attack at the age of 84 while <b>out</b> <b>walking</b> near his home in Lafayette. Active as a photographer, Segrè took many photos documenting events and people in the history of modern science. After his death Rosa donated many of his photographs to the American Institute of Physics, which named its photographic archive of physics history in his honor. The collection was bolstered by a subsequent bequest from Rosa after her death from an accident in Tivoli in 1997.|$|E

25|$|The next Phillip St revue was Around the Loop, {{which again}} teamed Oldaker, Gordon Chater, Blacklock and Humphries, plus {{newcomer}} June Salter. Humphries revived the Edna character (for {{what he said}} {{would be the last}} time) and the revue proved to be a major hit, playing eight shows a week for 14 months. During this period Humphries was living near Bondi and while <b>out</b> <b>walking</b> one day he had a chance meeting with an elderly man who had a high, scratchy voice and a pedantic manner of speech; this encounter inspired the creation of another of Humphries' most enduring characters, Sandy Stone.|$|E
25|$|Some psychiatrists {{regarded}} seizures as therapeutic {{and patients}} were sometimes also given electroconvulsive therapy or cardiazol/metrazol convulsive therapy during the coma, {{or on the}} day of the week when they didn’t have insulin treatment. When they were not in a coma, insulin coma patients were kept together in a group and given special treatment and attention. One handbook for psychiatric nurses, written by British psychiatrist Eric Cunningham Dax, instructs nurses to take their insulin patients <b>out</b> <b>walking</b> and occupy them with games and competitions, flower-picking and map-reading, etc. Patients required continuous supervision as there was a danger of hypoglycemic aftershocks after the coma.|$|E
25|$|Cúirt An Mheán Oíche (The Midnight Court) by Brian Merriman (17471805) is {{something}} of an oddity in 18th-century Irish poetry in Irish. Merriman was a teacher of mathematics who lived and worked in the Munster counties of Clare and Limerick. Cúirt An Mheán Oíche, effectively his only poetic work, was written around 1780. The poem begins by using the conventions of the Aisling, or vision poem, in which the poet is <b>out</b> <b>walking</b> when he has a vision of a woman from the other world. Typically, this woman is Ireland and the poem will lament her lot and/or call on her 'sons' to rebel against foreign tyranny.|$|E

25|$|He has {{described}} himself as a psychogeographer and modern flâneur and has written about walks he has taken. In December 2006, he walked 26 miles from his home in South London to Heathrow Airport. Upon arriving at Kennedy Airport he walked 20 miles from there to Manhattan. In August 2013, Self wrote of his anger following an incident in which he was stopped and questioned by police in Yorkshire while <b>out</b> <b>walking</b> with one of his sons, on suspicion of being a paedophile. The police were alerted by a security guard at Bishop Burton College. He had asked the security guard for permission to cross the school grounds.|$|E
25|$|Now it {{happened}} that on a cold and wintry day, as Lillinonah was <b>out</b> <b>walking</b> in the woods high above the swift rapids of the Housatonic, she came upon a handsome young white man wandering aimlessly through the forest, stumbling occasionally and falling to his knees before rising once more and continuing on. It was obvious to the Indian maiden {{that the man was}} sick with cold and fever, weak of body and confused of mind. With pity in her heart for the suffering stranger, she offered to assist him back to the village of the Pootatucks, where he might find rest and treatment for his illness. When the white man nodded his assent, she slowly walked him to her home, though he had to lean heavily upon her for support, lest he collapse in the effort.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, British {{musician}} and artist Jimmy Cauty was the guitarist in an underachieving pop/rock band, Brilliant. Brilliant had been signed to WEA Records by A man Bill Drummond, formerly {{a member of}} the Liverpool group Big in Japan, the manager of The Teardrop Explodes and Echo & the Bunnymen, and co-founder of the independent record label Zoo Records. In 1986, Brilliant released their one and only album - Kiss The Lips Of Life - before splitting up. In the same year, Drummond left WEA Records to record a solo album. Whilst <b>out</b> <b>walking</b> on New Year's Day, 1987, Drummond hit upon an idea for a hip-hop record but, he said, knowing [...] "nothing, personally, about the technology", he needed a collaborator. Drummond called Jimmy Cauty who agreed to join him in a new band called The Justified Ancients of Mu-Mu (The JAMs).|$|E
500|$|The U.S. government's National Center for Health Statistics {{reported}} 33,736 {{motor vehicle}} traffic deaths in 2014. This exceeded {{the number of}} firearm deaths, which was 33,599 in 2014. According to another U.S. government office, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, motor vehicle crashes on U.S. roadways claimed 32,744 lives in 2014 and 35,092 in 2015. (The National Center for Health Statistics may have different criteria for inclusion or a slightly different methodology from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.) The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration report comparing 2015 to 2014 noted that fatalities increased from 2014 to 2015 in almost all segments of the population: passenger vehicle occupants, passengers of large trucks, pedestrians, pedalcyclists (commonly referred to as cyclists), motorcyclists, alcohol-impaired driving fatalities, male/female, daytime/nighttime. Fatalities of drivers of large trucks remained unchanged. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration performed a regression analysis between monthly roadway fatalities and various possible explanatory variables over the five-year period 2011–2015. The strongest correlation was with vehicle miles traveled (VMT), which had a correlation of [...]80, followed by average monthly temperature, which had a correlation of [...]74, meaning that higher temperatures were associated with increased fatalities. Part {{of the reason for}} that pattern may be that more people are <b>out</b> <b>walking</b> and biking in the warmer months, and pedestrians and cyclists are often victims of collisions with motor vehicles. The report also suggests that there may be more vacation travel during warmer months. (It is not stated whether the analysis used annual vehicle miles traveled or monthly vehicle miles traveled.) Although not mentioned, motorcycle use, and therefore motorcyclist fatalities, may also increase in warmer months.|$|E
500|$|Three {{days later}} Turpin, {{accompanied}} by the same men along with William Saunders and Humphrey Walker, brutally raided a farm in Marylebone. [...] The attack netted the gang just under £90. [...] The next day the Duke of Newcastle offered a reward of £50 in exchange {{for information leading to}} the conviction of the [...] "several persons" [...] involved in the two Woodford robberies, and the robberies of the widow Shelley and Reverend Dyde. [...] On 11February Fielder, Saunders, and Wheeler, were apprehended. [...] Two accounts of their capture exist. [...] One claims that on their way to rob the Lawrence household the gang had stopped at an alehouse in Edgware, and that on 11February, while <b>out</b> <b>walking,</b> the owner noticed a group of horses outside an alehouse in Bloomsbury. [...] He recognised these horses as those used by the same group of men who had stopped at his alehouse before the Lawrence attack, and called for the parish constable. [...] Another account claims that two of the gang were spotted by a servant of Joseph Lawrence. [...] Regardless, the three, who were drinking with a woman (possibly Mary Brazier) were promptly arrested and committed to prison. [...] Wheeler, who may have been as young as15, quickly betrayed his colleagues, and descriptions of those yet to be captured were circulated in the press. [...] In the London Gazette, Turpin was described as [...] "Richard Turpin, a butcher by trade, is a tall fresh coloured man, very much marked with the small pox, about 26 years of age, about five feet nine inches high, lived some time ago in Whitechapel and did lately lodge somewhere about Millbank, Westminster, wears a blue grey coat and a natural wig".|$|E
