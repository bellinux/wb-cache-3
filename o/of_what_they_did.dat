25|$|The older Calvinistic {{emphasis}} on free grace was given {{new life in}} Methodist publications, preaching God's wonderful method of saving even the worst of sinners. It was viewed with suspicion and distrust by mid and late 18th century Anglican priests, since it carried with it the belief that salvation could be obtained without adherence to the moral law as delivered in the Ten Commandments. Men were not damned for the crimes they committed but for not believing in the great truths of the Gospel. If men had faith in the efficacy of Christ's sacrifice, they might be under no dread <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>did,</b> because he stood clean before the eyes of God from the day in which Christ died upon the cross.|$|E
25|$|Ranatunga {{went on to}} captain Sri Lanka in 1988, {{taking control}} of the {{national}} team for the next 11 years, transforming it from a weak, routinely defeated team into a competitive and successful unit. He led the team to their greatest cricketing triumph, 1996 World Cup. His innovative captaincy took a Sri Lanka team, given little chance prior to the competition, for cricket's greatest prize. His strategies was commended by many cricketing greats and followed by other teams. He was the brain behind the strategy of scoring as many runs as possible in the first 15 overs of an ODI match in which there are field restrictions. This strategy was perfectly executed by Sanath Jayasuriya. This strategy was still followed by the batsmen in the Powerplays. He was widely recognised as a belligerent leader and was famous for defending his players at all costs regardless <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>did.</b>|$|E

[...] Crane returned to these magazines during subsequent visits to Linson's studio, and eventually the idea of writing a war novel overtook him.

[...] This novel would ultimately become The Red Badge of Courage.|$|E

500|$|Stephen Crane {{published}} his first novel, , in March 1893 {{at the age}} of 22. Maggie was not a success, either financially or critically. Most critics thought the unsentimental Bowery tale crude or vulgar, and Crane chose to publish the work privately after it was repeatedly rejected for publication. Crane found inspiration for his next novel while spending hours lounging in a friend's studio in the early summer of 1893. There, he became fascinated with issues of Century Magazine that were largely devoted to famous battles and military leaders from the Civil War. Frustrated with the dryly written stories, Crane stated, [...] "I wonder that some of those fellows don't tell how they felt in those scraps.

500|$|One Day in History was {{launched}} {{as a part}} of History Matters, a campaign led by several heritage organisations such as the National Trust, English Heritage and the Historic Houses Association, in order to draw attention towards the importance of history in everyday life. Its aim was to record for posterity what day-to-day life was like in the UK during 2006. British people were invited to write a blog <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> on 17 October 2006, and to submit it {{to become a part of}} a large online diary. The project was open to all UK citizens and individuals of British origin, and was inspired by Mass Observation, a similar social research project founded in 1937. The date was chosen to be 17 October by History Matters in the hope that it would be [...] "an ordinary day much like any other of no particular national significance", and would therefore reflect the everyday life of its participants. Historian Dan Snow explained that the project was intended to be [...] "a detailed account of people's normal lives when they're doing nothing out of the ordinary. ... It's those mundane details, those boring details that will seem extraordinary to people hundreds of years in the future." [...] The organisers hoped that the contributors could also discuss the impact of history or heritage on their lives that day in their submissions.|$|E
2500|$|The Daughters of Bilitis , {{also called}} the DOB or the Daughters, was the first lesbian civil and {{political}} rights organization in the United States. The organization, formed in San Francisco in 1955, was conceived as a social alternative to lesbian bars, which were subject to raids and police harassment. As the DOB gained members, their focus shifted to providing support to women who were afraid to come out. The DOB educated them about their rights, and about gay history. The historian Lillian Faderman declared, [...] "Its very establishment in the midst of witch-hunts and police harassment was an act of courage, since members always had to fear that they were under attack, not because <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>did,</b> but merely because of who they were." [...] The Daughters of Bilitis endured for 14 years, becoming an educational resource for lesbians, gay men, researchers and mental health professionals.|$|E

2500|$|According to Robert Southey, poet laureate, in his {{response}} to Charlotte, ladies from a good background should be content with an education and a marriage embellished with some decorative talents. Mr Brontë also said {{to one of the}} characters in his The Maid of Kilarney, without one knowing whether it truly reflected a widespread opinion in order to support it or to condemn it: [...] "The education of female ought, most assuredly, to be competent, in order that she might enjoy herself, and be a fit companion for man. But, believe me, lovely, delicate and sprightly woman, is not formed by nature, to pore over the musty pages of Grecian and Roman literature, or to plod through the windings of Mathematical Problems, nor has Providence assigned for her sphere of action, either the cabinet or the field. Her forte is softness, tenderness and grace." [...] In any case, it seemed to contradict his attitude towards his daughters whom he encouraged even if he was not completely aware <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> with their time.|$|E
2500|$|Judaism posits a {{creation}} narrative [...] "In the beginning" [...] and a redeemed Olam Haba at the end, which means Judaism has a linear, not a cyclical concept of time, at least regarding the physical world. However, as the Creator is eternal and without beginning or end, things in time attain {{some form of}} eternal-ity through a relationship with Him. Additionally, the Midrash posits that historical events {{in the history of}} the Jewish people repeat themselves. [...] There is a spiritual repetition, too, and the influence is transmitted year after year, no matter the [...] "distance" [...] from the original event. As a result, the actions in a person's life directly affect their life in the next world, or after death, and are direct manifestations of the spiritual influences <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> in this world (see the Kabbalah of the Ariza'l). There is also a perspective that time is composed of seven cycles, which repeat every seven thousand years (a view rejected by Isaac Luria). These concepts give human choices to do good deeds in Olam HaZeh — [...] "this world" [...] - some of what Nietzsche called the eternal recurrence's [...] "infinite weight".|$|E

The two that were slain were Dardinel, king of Zumara, and Cloridan, one of his followers; and the wounded survivor was another, whose name was Medoro. Cloridan and Medoro had been loving and grateful servants of Dardinel, and very fast friends of one another; such friends, indeed, that on their own account, as well as in honour <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> for their master, their history deserves a particular mention.|$|E

60|$|That {{this was}} not his private view Shelton {{inferred}} by studying Mr. Dennant's manner {{in the presence of}} the vagabond. Underlying the well-bred banter of the tranquil voice, the guarded quizzicality of his pale brown face, it could be seen that Algernon Cuffe Dennant, Esq., J.P., accustomed to laugh at other people, suspected that he was being laughed at. What more natural than that he should grope about to see how this could be? A vagrant alien was making himself felt by an English Justice of the Peace--no small tribute, this, to Ferrand's personality. The latter would sit silent through a meal, and yet make his effect.
