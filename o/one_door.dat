5|$|God of War is a third-person single player action-adventure {{video game}} with hack and slash elements, viewed from a fixed camera perspective. The player {{controls}} the character Kratos in combo-based combat, platforming, and puzzle game elements, and battles foes who primarily stem from Greek mythology, including undead soldiers, harpies, minotaurs, Medusa and her Gorgons, cyclopes, wraiths, Sirens, satyrs, centaurs, cerberuses, and boss opponents—the Hydra {{and a giant}} minotaur known as Pandora's Guardian. Platforming elements require the player to climb walls and ladders, jump across chasms, swing on ropes, and balance across beams to proceed through sections of the game. Some puzzles are simple, such as moving a box so that the player can {{use it as a}} jumping-off point to access a pathway unreachable with normal jumping, but others are more complex, such as finding several items across different areas of the game to unlock <b>one</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
5|$|God of War: Chains of Olympus is a third-person single-player {{video game}} viewed from a fixed camera perspective. The player {{controls}} the character Kratos in combo-based combat, platforming, and puzzle game elements, and battles foes who primarily stem from Greek mythology, including cyclopes, Gorgons, satyrs, harpies, minotaurs, hoplites, and sphinxes. Morpheus beasts, shades, banshees, fire guards, fire sentries, hyperion guards, and death knights were created {{specifically for the}} game.

5|$|The trams are bidirectional, with a driver's cab at each end. These cabs {{are built}} so the {{motorman}} can also sell tickets. The cab's have {{a door to}} close them off, so the riders cannot access rear cab. There are four doors on both sides; the front door is single while the three back doors are double. In addition to the front door, there is <b>one</b> <b>door</b> in each section. To operate the doors on the left side, the motorman must engage a security switch. It is also possible to open each individual door {{on the right side}} from the driver's cab. Half the length is low-floor, with an entry height at , including three of the four doors. There are 88 seats, of which 64 are on the high-floor section, giving a total capacity of 212 riders.|$|E

5|$|George W. Jones, {{who would}} later become a U.S. Senator from Iowa, arrived in the Sinsinawa Mound area in 1827, and in 1828 {{established}} a mining settlement there. The first structure at the settlement was Jones's own log cabin, built {{during the spring of}} 1828 in two days. The cabin measured 49 feet (14.9 m) by 17feet (5.2m) and each room had <b>one</b> <b>door</b> and one window. When the Black Hawk War began four years later he also built a small fort at the site. The remains of the fort, one of many constructed in the region to protect local residents, are said to still stand {{at the entrance to the}} Sinsinawa Dominican complex. One of the men who assisted Jones in building the fort's blockhouse was Enoch Robinson, a soldier who later helped bury the victims of the Sinsinawa Mound raid. At the time of the attack Jones was with Henry Dodge's militia volunteers, on the way to meet overall commander General Henry Atkinson at Lake Koshkonong, then a marsh region.|$|E

The {{opposite}} doors {{lead to the}} small dining chamber (rebuilt by Ahmed III) and the great bedchamber, while the other admits {{to a series of}} ante-chambers, including the room with the fountain (Çeşmeli Sofa), which were all retiled and redecorated in the 17th century.|$|E
25|$|All {{other local}} bus {{services}} are now operated by modern low-floor buses, {{which may be}} single-deck or double-deck. Most buses operating in London have two sets of doors, and passengers board the bus using {{the front door and}} alight using the rear door, whilst some buses on less busy routes have only <b>one</b> <b>door.</b> All these buses conform to the Disability discrimination act, and can accept passengers in wheelchairs and other mobility impaired passengers.|$|E

50|$|The ivy is a {{very common}} plant in Póvoa de Varzim, often found in granite walls that divide farmlands and, on Easter Sunday, {{with the arrival of}} Spring, they become {{symbolic}} and interweaved with Christian beliefs: the population picks ivy leaves and spreads them in the streets, especially near <b>one's</b> <b>door</b> or forming corridors meant to be stepped on by the compasso pascal, a Catholic parade that brings the Lord in the Crucifix into one's home.|$|R
25|$|Like their Irish neighbours, the Norsemen of Dublin {{used the}} post-and-wattle method to {{construct}} their dwellings. A series of sturdy vertical posts were first {{driven into the}} ground; these were then interlaced with horizontal osiers, as in basketwork. A plaster of mud and dung was generally applied to the outer surfaces of the walls to seal them (wattle-and-daub). Finally, the roofs were thatched with straw. There was usually just <b>one</b> <b>door,</b> and no windows.|$|E
25|$|Structures or {{objects such}} as {{furniture}} created using bush carpentry techniques often have minimal or even an ad hoc design. Projects built according to properly drawn plans, for example, architectural blueprints, cannot be called examples of bush carpentry. The design of a barn or shed {{is likely to be}} intuitive and functional; the settler's slab hut derived from the vernacular English crofter's hut, a simple rectangular walled shelter with <b>one</b> <b>door,</b> and perhaps holes to allow air to enter.|$|E
25|$|Once in the water, the {{occupants}} disembarked {{from the sea}} side down steps into the water. Many machines had doors front and back; those with only <b>one</b> <b>door</b> would be backed into the sea or need to be turned around. It was considered essential that the machine blocked any view of the bather from the shore. Some machines were equipped with a canvas tent lowered from the seaside door, sometimes capable of being lowered to the water, giving the bather greater privacy.|$|E

50|$|Another {{supposed}} {{method of}} protection from kallikantzaroi {{was to leave}} the fire burning in the fireplace, all night, {{so that they could}} not enter through it. In some areas, people would burn the Yule log {{for the duration of the}} twelve days. In other areas, people would throw foul-smelling shoes into the fire, as the stench was believed to repel the kallikantzaroi and thus force them to stay away. Additional ways to keep them away included marking <b>one's</b> <b>door</b> with a black cross on Christmas Eve and burning incense.|$|R
25|$|On 3 March 1974, Turkish Airlines Flight 981, a McDonnell Douglas DC-10 {{registered}} as TC-JAV, crashed into Ermenonville Forest, Fontaine-Chaalis, Oise, France due to explosive decompression, killing all 335 passengers and 11 crew on board. The main cause was a design fault on the cargo {{doors of the}} McDonnell Douglas DC-10 which led to incomplete engagement of the door locking mechanism on the aircraft in question, and consequent opening of <b>one</b> <b>door</b> in flight. Until the Tenerife airport disaster (27 March 1977), it was the deadliest aviation disaster in the world.|$|E
25|$|The chapel is a plain structure, {{built of}} gritstone with quoins {{at the corners}} and a slate roof. It has a small, {{hexagonal}} bellcote on the west gable. The side walls have two cross-windows with rectangular panes of glass and the gable walls have windows with small diamond-latticed panes of glass. On the south side are two doorways with chamfered surrounds; over <b>one</b> <b>door</b> is a lintel dated 1703. At the north-west corner is a two-storey wing with a tall chimney stack, which was the school house. The building {{is surrounded by a}} drystone wall and the chapel's original cast iron gates survive.|$|E
25|$|At {{the main}} {{entrance}} are three doors. Apart from {{the main entrance}}, all other entrances, except for the one fronting Victoria Street, have only <b>one</b> <b>door.</b> The entrance fronting Victoria Street had three doors initially until the walling up of the centre door. All doors are double-leaf, of timber construct and, except for the two fronting Victoria Street, all are panelled. While {{the doors of the}} two side entrances at the nave are double the height of the doors found at the ends of the transept, these four doors have each a stained-glass window over them.|$|E
50|$|The ZiU-9 was a quite {{successful}} attempt {{to solve these}} problems. It has <b>one</b> extra <b>door</b> compared to the ZiU-5. Two doors are wide {{and placed in the}} middle and rear end of the vehicle hull. <b>One</b> small <b>door</b> in {{the front end of the}} vehicle was/is comfortable for the driver and for outgoing passengers. The hull of the ZiU-9 is a welded steel one and it is significantly cheaper and simpler in production than the hull of the ZiU-5. The external appearance of the ZiU-9 was influenced by contemporary German-made MAN trolleybuses.|$|R

My friend went out, of course, in spite of the faithful fellow's entreaties; and found, as he expected, a bottle containing the usual charms, and round it--sight of horror to all Negroes of the old school--three white cocks' heads--an old remnant, it is said, of a worship 'de quo sileat musa'--pointing their beaks, <b>one</b> to his <b>door,</b> <b>one</b> to the <b>door</b> of each of his friends. He picked them up, laughing, and threw them away, to the horror of his servant.|$|R

25|$|At the time, Portland {{was merely}} a hamlet, with fewer than 500 residents. He and his father {{established}} a general merchandising business, J. Failing & Co., on Front Street (now Naito Parkway), <b>one</b> <b>door</b> south of Oak Street. The business grew rapidly in its first few years. In 1853, Josiah was elected as Portland's fourth mayor, serving until 1854. Henry also became majority owner in the family business in that year. Josiah retired in 1864, and Henry narrowed the business's focus to hardware and iron supplies in 1868. He would remain associated with the business until January 1893.|$|E
25|$|Two schools {{under one}} roof refers to the schools in Bosnia and Herzegovina based on the ethnic {{segregation}} of children. Children from two ethnic groups, Bosniaks and Croats, attend classes in the same building, but physically separated {{from each other and}} taught separate curricula. Children from one ethnic group enter the school through <b>one</b> <b>door,</b> while children from other ethnic group through another. In the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina there are currently 57 schools which operate in this way. This phenomenon of ethnic separation is attributed to the Croat-Bosniak war (1992-1994) and the creation of Herzeg-Bosnia on the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina.|$|E
25|$|GO Transit, the {{regional}} transportation authority serving the Greater Toronto Area in Ontario, currently operates 127 12.8-metre-long Enviro500s in its fleet. Like its fleet of coach buses, {{they have only}} <b>one</b> <b>door</b> in the front. Earlier, it tested a double-decker Trident 3 on loan from Victoria in May 2002, which had an extra rear door. However, it did not place any orders until early 2008, when it introduced twelve commuter-type Enviro500s (numbered 8000-8011), Ten extra units (8012-8021) entered service in early 2009. Both of these batches have a height of 4.2 metres, making them too high to meet bridge clearance requirements in the province.|$|E

Why travel? Why {{have to put up with}} all this useless expense and worry and waste of time? Why not have one's divorce sent, C.O.D., to <b>one's</b> <b>door,</b> or establish a new branch of the Post-office Department? American enterprise has surely lagged in this.|$|R
