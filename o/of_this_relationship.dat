Details about the reason and talks <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>relationship</b> are unknown, but they would be productive, since Przemysł II decided to give the Kraków voivode Żegota three villages (Nieczajno, Wierzbiczany and Lulin).|$|E
5|$|After being {{assigned}} to cover Roosevelt during her husband's first presidential campaign, Hickok {{struck up a}} close relationship with the soon-to-be First Lady. For several years, the two corresponded almost every day, traveled together, and professed emotional and physical affection for one another. The exact nature <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>relationship</b> has been widely discussed by historians; some have argued that the relationship was clearly romantic or erotic, while others have argued that historians have been misled by Roosevelt's exuberant letters. It is known, and was known in the White House press corps at the time, that Hickok was a lesbian. More than 3,000 letters from the pair's correspondence are preserved at the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum.|$|E
5|$|Averianov, Archibald, and Martin instead placed UA 8699 in {{the context}} of faunal {{similarity}} and exchange between the late Cretaceous faunas of Europe and Africa, noting the presence of similar animals, such as snakes (Medtsoia) and sauropods (Lirainosaurus and Repetosaurus), in the Cretaceous faunas of Madagascar and the Spanish locality Laño. They proposed the relationship between Lainodon, which is from Laño, and UA 8699 as another example <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>relationship</b> and cited a previous prediction by Gheerbrant and Astibia that zhelestids similar to Lainodon would be found in Africa.|$|E

5|$|Other {{scholars}} {{have identified the}} text's tone as satirical and mildly obscene, locating it among a movement of pamphlets influenced by a counter-trend promoting greater sympathy for prostitution. Linda Dowling interprets the pamphlet less a broadside against sodomites, and more as evidence of a strand in rhetoric that valorized Britain's martial past and saw {{lack of respect for}} it as a precondition for vice. Ian Bell considers the causality <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>relationship</b> between moral collapse and vice, characterizing the book as part of strand that saw vice as a product, not a cause, of a fundamental collapse in morality in Augustan London.|$|E
5|$|The well-characterized {{interactions}} between archaea and other organisms are either mutual or commensal. There are no clear examples of known archaeal pathogens or parasites. However, some species of methanogens {{have been suggested}} {{to be involved in}} infections in the mouth, and Nanoarchaeum equitans may be a parasite of another species of archaea, since it only survives and reproduces within the cells of the Crenarchaeon Ignicoccus hospitalis, and appears to offer no benefit to its host. In contrast, Archaeal Richmond Mine Acidophilic Nanoorganisms (ARMAN) occasionally connect with other archaeal cells in acid mine drainage biofilms. The nature <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>relationship</b> is unknown. However, it is distinct from that of Nanarchaeaum–Ignicoccus in that the ultrasmall ARMAN cells are usually seen independent of the Thermoplasmatales cells.|$|E
5|$|The {{major theme}} of Buffy's dream is {{her fear of}} the {{personal}} cost of {{her life as a}} Slayer, the isolation and loneliness she is forced to endure. This theme of aloneness is reiterated by several shots in which she is alone in the frame, most notably the wide shot of her in the vast and empty desert. Another source of anxiety is her relationship with her current boyfriend, Riley, whom she finds plotting world domination with Adam in his original, human, form. She fears what Riley could turn into {{as a result of his}} alliance with the military. She also fears the destabilizing effect of this alliance on their relationship, and the destabilizing effect <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>relationship</b> on her life as the slayer. She is shown putting mud on her face, mimicking the mud mask of the primal, First Slayer. By the end of her encounter in the desert with the First Slayer, Buffy realizes that she does not have to be entirely alone, that it is her closeness to friends and family that makes her a great Slayer, and once she experiences this revelation, the efforts of the First Slayer to continue to engage her in battle become fruitless and increasingly comical. The dream finally ends in a mundane way, as Buffy refuses to accept a tragic climax and instead insists on normality in her life.|$|E

25|$|The {{principle}} in classical mechanics that E ∝ mv2 was first developed by Gottfried Leibniz and Johann Bernoulli, who described kinetic energy as the living force, vis viva. Willem 's Gravesande of the Netherlands provided experimental evidence <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>relationship.</b> By dropping weights from different heights into {{a block of}} clay, Willem 's Gravesande determined that their penetration depth was proportional to the square of their impact speed.

25|$|To formalize his own {{relationship}} with the Mongols, in 1247 Hethum I sent his elder half-brother Sempad the Constable to the Mongol court in Karakorum. Sempad met with Güyük Khan and his successor, Kublai Khan's brother Möngke Khan, and made an agreement of cooperation, against their common enemy the Muslims. The nature <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>relationship</b> is disputed by historians, some of whom call it an alliance, and others {{who say that the}} Armenians had submitted to Mongol overlordship, and become a vassal state similar to any other conquered region.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} between priests and warriors was important, because {{the concept of}} Ērānshahr had been revived by the priests. Without this relationship, the Sassanid Empire would not have survived in its beginning stages. Because <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>relationship</b> between the warriors and the priests, religion and state were considered inseparable in the Zoroastrian religion. However, it is this same relationship that caused the weakening of the Empire, when each group tried to impose their power onto the other. Disagreements between the priests and the warriors led to fragmentation within the empire, which led to its downfall.|$|E

Because <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>relationship</b> the regional library system received higher financial aid from the State Department of Education. By 1952 Glascock County also joined the system, and the Augusta Library assumed responsibility for the library in the negro community, changing {{its name to the}} Wallace branch.|$|E

25|$|The UUA {{is not a}} {{denomination}} in {{the traditional}} sense; the UUA is an association of congregations with no one organization able to speak authoritatively for the whole. It is the congregations that have authority over the larger body, through the annual General Assembly of the Unitarian Universalist Association. Since the general public understands denomination much more readily than association of congregations, the distinction is generally omitted in conversation. Because <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>relationship</b> between the congregations and the association, Unitarian Universalist congregations have a congregationalist polity of governance. However, day-to-day decisions are made by the president, the moderator, and the Board of Trustees.|$|E
25|$|David Cass was outspoken about {{academic}} and personal freedom.

At this time he had a consensual relationship with a then-graduate student. When a university policy on faculty-student relationships was adopted Cass was denied the appointment as Chair of the graduate program of the Department of Economics because <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>relationship.</b> As the graduate student in question graduated before the planned appointment of Cass as Chair of the department, the timeline of the administrative action rendered the initial objection moot.|$|E
25|$|Biodiversity {{inventory}} – An interspecific O–A relationship {{implies that}} those species {{that have a}} restricted distribution (and hence will be important for conservation reasons) will also have low abundance within their range. Thus, when {{it is especially important}} that a species be detected, that species may be difficult to detect. Gaston et al. note that because <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>relationship,</b> the intensiveness of a sampling scheme cannot be traded off for extensiveness. In effect, an intensive survey of a few sites will miss species with restricted distribution occurring at other sites, while an low-intensity extensive survey will miss species with low densities across most sites.|$|E
