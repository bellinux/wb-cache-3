5|$|Cornering weave tendencies are {{amplified by}} {{degraded}} damping <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> suspension. Cornering, camber stiffnesses and relaxation length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> tire make the largest contribution to weave damping. The same {{parameters of the}} front tire have a lesser effect. Rear loading also amplifies cornering weave tendencies. Rear load assemblies with appropriate stiffness and damping, however, were successful in damping out weave and wobble oscillations.|$|E

40|$|Animal {{societies}} vary in <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> breeders per group, {{which affects}} many socially and ecologically relevant traits. In several social insect species, including our study species Formica selysi, <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> either one or multiple reproducing females per colony is generally associated with differences in {{a suite of}} traits such as <b>the</b> body size <b>of</b> individuals. However, <b>the</b> proximate mechanisms and ontogenetic processes generating such differences between social structures are poorly known. Here, we cross-fostered eggs originating from single-queen (= monogynous) or multiple-queen (= polygynous) colonies into experimental groups of workers from each social structure to investigate whether differences in offspring survival, development time and body size are shaped by the genotype and/or prefoster maternal effects present in the eggs, or by <b>the</b> social origin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rearing</b> workers. Eggs produced by polygynous queens {{were more likely to}} survive to adulthood than eggs from monogynous queens, regardless <b>of</b> <b>the</b> social origin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rearing</b> workers. However, brood from monogynous queens grew faster than brood from polygynous queens. <b>The</b> social origin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rearing</b> workers influenced <b>the</b> probability <b>of</b> brood survival, with workers from monogynous colonies rearing more brood to adulthood than workers from polygynous colonies. <b>The</b> social origin <b>of</b> eggs or rearing workers had no significant effect on <b>the</b> head size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> resulting workers in our standardized laboratory conditions. Overall, <b>the</b> social backgrounds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parents and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rearing</b> workers appear to shape distinct survival and developmental traits of ant brood...|$|R
5|$|Early {{versions}} of the Su-25 were equipped with two R95Sh non-afterburning turbojets, in compartments on either side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> fuselage. The engines, sub-assemblies and surrounding fuselage are cooled by air provided by the cold air intakes {{on top of the}} engine nacelles. A drainage system collects oil, hydraulic fluid residues and fuel from the engines after flight or after an unsuccessful start. The engine control systems allows independent operation of each engine. The latest versions (Su-25T and TM) are equipped with improved R-195 engines.|$|E
5|$|Fourth, camber thrust {{contributes}} to the centripetal force necessary to cause the bike to deviate from a straight path, along with cornering force due to the slip angle, and can be the largest contributor. Camber thrust {{contributes to}} the ability of bikes to negotiate a turn with the same radius as automobiles but with a smaller steering angle. When a bike is steered and leaned in the same direction, the camber angle of the front tire is greater than that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> and so can generate more camber thrust, all else being equal.|$|E

40|$|Transhumance is <b>the</b> {{seasonal}} movement <b>of</b> herds {{between different}} {{summer and winter}} pastures. <b>The</b> main reason <b>of</b> practice of this farming system {{is the need for}} a more efficient exploitation of vegetation to meet <b>the</b> nutritional needs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reared</b> animals. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> this paper is to investigate nutritional management practices of transhumant herds in <b>the</b> region <b>of</b> Sterea Ellada.   In the analysis, emphasis is given in <b>the</b> calculation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coverage <b>of</b> nutritional needs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reared</b> animals by supplementary feed, translated as Metabolized energy (ME), Digestible Crude Protein (DGP) and Dry Matter (DM).

All necessary data were collected from a sample of 140 transhumant herders, via an exhaustive questionnaire that covered all aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> production <b>of</b> <b>the</b> farms and managerial practices. Data were subsequently analyzed with descriptive statistic methods. Analysis reveals that grazing tends to be the main nutritional source as approximately 30 - 50 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> needs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reared</b> animals on lowlands and more than 90 % on uplands is considered to be covered by grazin...|$|R

The second landed atop the rear turret itself, but little damage was suffered {{due to the}} heavy armor in that location. This attack did not seriously damage Roma or cause any flooding, but she nevertheless sailed to Genoa for repairs. Roma reached the city on 1 July, and returned to La Spezia, on 13 August, once repairs were complete.|$|E
5|$|Several species coined in genera {{other than}} Allosaurus are also now {{thought to be}} synonymous with A. fragilis.

5|$|The French Navy {{decided to}} {{reinforce}} her anti-aircraft armament {{in light of}} its wartime experience.

Two more Mle 1933 mounts were to fitted on each side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> deckhouse and a fourth mount was to replace the 13.2Hotchkiss machine guns forward of the bridge.

This plan was later amended to add a degaussing cable, replacement of the SS-6 sonar by a French copy of the British ASDIC and six of the new mitrailleuse de 25 mm contre-aéroplanes Modèle 1940 anti-aircraft guns, plus two more 13.2mm Brownings mounted on the forward corners of the center deck house.|$|E

5|$|Wobble, shimmy, tank-slapper, speed wobble, {{and death}} wobble are all {{words and phrases}} used to {{describe}} a rapid (410Hz) oscillation of primarily just the front end (front wheel, fork, and handlebars). Also involved is the yawing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> frame which {{may contribute to the}} wobble when too flexible. This instability occurs mostly at high speed and is similar to that experienced by shopping cart wheels, airplane landing gear, and automobile front wheels. While wobble or shimmy can be easily remedied by adjusting speed, position, or grip on the handlebar, it can be fatal if left uncontrolled.|$|E
5|$|After a {{farewell}} {{visit from the}} Eastern Fleet commander, Admiral Sir James Somerville on 12 January 1943, Illustrious sailed for home the next day. She flew off her aircraft to Gibraltar on 31 January and continued on to the Clyde where she arrived five days later. She conducted deck-landing trials for prototypes of the Blackburn Firebrand and Fairey Firefly fighters, {{as well as the}} Fairey Barracuda dive/torpedo bomber from 8 to 10 February. On 26 February she began a refit at Birkenhead that lasted until 7 June during which her flight deck was extended, new radars were installed, her light antiaircraft armament was augmented, and two new arrestor wires were fitted aft <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> lift which increased her effective landing area. While conducting her postrefit trials, she also conducted flying trials for Martlet Vs and Barracudas. Both sets of trials were completed by 18 July, by which time the Illustrious had joined the Home Fleet.|$|E
5|$|Allosaurus is {{regarded}} as senior synonym of the genera Creosaurus, Epanterias, and Labrosaurus.
