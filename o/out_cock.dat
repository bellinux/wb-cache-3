It might be palace without, but it was wigwam within; so that, between the stateliness of his mansion and the squalidness of his furniture, the gallant White Plume presented some such whimsical incongruity as {{we see in the}} gala equipments of an Indian chief on a treaty-making embassy at Washington, who has been generously decked <b>out</b> in <b>cocked</b> hat and military coat, in contrast to his breech-clout and leathern legging; being grand officer at top, and ragged Indian at bottom.|$|R

He cocked his rifle, holding it with the muzzle {{directed}} anywhere, but principally our way; grasped his bowie-knife between his teeth, and cut his tongue trying to talk; spurred his nag into the fire, and backed him out across our blankets; and finally sat still, utterly unnerved, while we roared with the laughter we could no longer suppress.|$|R
5|$|Suspicion {{continued}} to grow, and Maria's stepmother began talking of dreams that Maria {{had been murdered}} and buried in the Red Barn.

She was badly decomposed but still identifiable. An inquest was carried <b>out</b> at the <b>Cock</b> Inn at Polstead (which still stands today), where Maria was formally identified by her sister Ann from some physical characteristics. Her hair and some clothing were recognisable, and she was known to be missing a tooth which was also absent from the jawbone of the corpse. Evidence was uncovered to implicate Corder in the crime: his green handkerchief was discovered around the body's neck.|$|R

Jack offered spirits from his cellar, and planned on getting the merman drunk while he sneaked <b>out</b> with the <b>cocked</b> hat and go rescue the souls. The first day did not succeed because Jack himself got drunk forgetting he didn't have the coolness of the sea above his head as when he was drinking undersea. The next day, he offered the mermaid the powerful poteen he obtained from his brother-in-law, and watered down his own drinking. Jack succeeded in releasing some souls, but his wife returned before Jack did and saw the merman. Jack told his wife his story and was forgiven for the good deed.|$|R

60|$|As {{the gentleman}} in blue went home {{the same way}} as Mr. Tuckle, he was prevailed upon to stop too. When the punch was about half gone, Sam ordered in some oysters from the green-grocer's shop; and the effect of both was so {{extremely}} exhilarating, that Mr. Tuckle, dressed <b>out</b> with the <b>cocked</b> hat and stick, danced the frog hornpipe among the shells on the table, while the gentleman in blue played an accompaniment upon an ingenious musical instrument formed of a hair-comb upon a curl-paper. At last, when the punch was all gone, and the night nearly so, they sallied forth to see each other home. Mr. Tuckle no sooner got into the open air, than he was seized with a sudden desire to lie on the curbstone; Sam {{thought it would be a}} pity to contradict him, and so let him have his own way. As the cocked hat would have been spoiled if left there, Sam very considerately flattened it down on the head of the gentleman in blue, and putting the big stick in his hand, propped him up against his own street-door, rang the bell, and walked quietly home.|$|R
40|$|The main {{aim of the}} diploma thesis was {{to analyze}} the use {{characteristics}} of chicken hybrids with slow growth rate. Following hybrids were analyzed: combination of JA 757, who were fed until 49 days of their age and combination of Pac JA with feed length of 56 days. The average live weight of hybrid combination JA 757 was 2 169 g, the feed consumption per kg of weight gain averaged at 2 119 g and the selection rate reached 0. 5 %. The combination Pac JA reached live weight at slaughter date of 2 109 g, the feed consumption was 2 366 g and 0. 88 % chickens was selected. The value of Production Efficiency Factor was higher for the hybrid JA 757 (208) compared with the hybrid Pac JA (158). It was {{found out that the}} carcass yield of the hybrid JA 757 was about 3. 8 % higher (74. 7 % vs. 70. 9 %) compared to the hybrid Pac JA. Similarly the weight of the breast muscles reached the weight of 405 g in case of the JA 757 which was 53 g more than in case of the Pac JA (352 g). The leg muscle difference was 132 g in favor of the JA 757 (499 g vs. 367 g) while the weight of abdominal fat was lower by 5. 5 g (44 vs. 49. 5 g). Therefore it can be stated that the difference was statistically highly significant. Furthermore it was found <b>out</b> that <b>cocks</b> reached higher breast and leg muscle weight than hens of both hybrids. The difference was 33 g and 106 g for JA 757 hybrids and 57 g and 79 g for Pac JA hybrids respectively. Also here the difference was statistically highly significant and statistically significant respectively. Overall the hybrid JA 757 proved to have higher genetic potential in intensity growth and also in carcass utility...|$|R
5000|$|After {{some months}} of stalemate, one of Kyteler's servants, Petronella de Meath, was tortured, and confessed to witchcraft. Her {{confession}} detailed her involvement, along with Alice's, in {{six out of}} seven of the above listed crimes. It would seem, although her testimony was likely forced and unreliable, that the accusers gained most of their information from this confession. Although the testimony did implicate Kyteler to performing heresy, questions concerning Petronella's credibility come into light, especially when examining the contents of her confession. In Ledrede's retelling of Petronella's confession, he writes:"On one of these occasions, by the crossroads outside the city, she had made an offering of three cocks to a certain demon whom she called Robert, son of Art (Robertum filium Artis), {{from the depths of}} the underworld. She had poured <b>out</b> the <b>cock's</b> blood, cut the animals into pieces and mixed the intestines with spiders and other black worms like scorpions, with a herb called milfoil as well as with other herbs and horrible worms. She had boiled this mixture in a pot with the brains and clothes of a boy who had died without baptism and with the head of a robber who had been decapitated ... Petronella said she had several times at Alice's instigation and once in her presence, consulted demons and received answers. She had consented to a pact whereby she would be the medium between Alice and the said Robert, her friend. In public, she said that with her own eyes she had seen the aforesaid demon as three shapes (praedictus daemon tertius), in the form of three black men (aethiopum) each carrying an iron rod in the hand. This apparition happened by daylight (de die) before the said Dame Alice, and, while Petronella herself was watching, the apparition had intercourse with Alice. After this disgraceful act, with her own hand she (Alice?) wiped clean the disgusting place with sheets (kanevacio) from her own bed."Given that ergot poisoning was prevalent in 14th century Europe, scholars argue that Petronella could have suffered from an ergot-induced fever dream, whose effects would be similar to that of LSD's. In other words, Petronella may have believed to have seen these events because she was hallucinating. However, in spite of this, Petronella's testimony in the trial lead to her death. Petronilla was burnt at the stake for witchcraft and heresy. She was the first person in Ireland to be burnt at the stake for these crimes, and the first sentenced to death for heresy. Her testimony was also enough to lead prosecutors to move forward against Kyteler.|$|R
60|$|On {{the night}} {{arranged}} I turned up about eight, {{and found the}} leader sitting alone in almost total darkness in a small back room. He {{was dressed in a}} black gown, like an inquisitor's dress in an old drawing, that left nothing of him visible: except his eyes, which peered out through two small round holes. Upon {{the table in front of}} him was a brass dish of burning herbs, a large bowl, a skull covered with painted symbols, two crossed daggers, and certain implements shaped like quern stones, which were used to control the elemental powers in some fashion I did not discover. I also put on a black gown, and remember that it did not fit perfectly, and that it interfered with my movements considerably. The sorcerer then took a black <b>cock</b> <b>out</b> of a basket, and cut its throat with one of the daggers, letting the blood fall into the large bowl. He opened a book and began an invocation, which was certainly not English, and had a deep guttural sound. Before he had finished, another of the sorcerers, a man of about twenty-five, came in, and having put on a black gown also, seated himself at my left band. I had the invoker directly in front of me, and soon began to find his eyes, which glittered through the small holes in his hood, affecting me in a curious way. I struggled hard against their influence, and my head began to ache. The invocation continued, and nothing happened for the first few minutes. Then the invoker got up and extinguished the light in the hall, so that no glimmer might come through the slit under the door. There was now no light except from the herbs on the brass dish, and no sound except from the deep guttural murmur of the invocation.|$|R
