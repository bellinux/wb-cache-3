5|$|In the 1990s, Hezbollah {{transformed}} from a revolutionary group into a political one, in a process which is described as the Lebanonisation <b>of</b> <b>Hezbollah.</b> Unlike its uncompromising revolutionary stance in the 1980s, Hezbollah conveyed a lenient stance towards the Lebanese state.|$|E
5|$|On 28 July 1989, Israeli commandos kidnapped Sheikh Abdul Karim Obeid, {{the leader}} <b>of</b> <b>Hezbollah.</b> This action {{led to the}} {{adoption}} of UN Security Council resolution 638, which condemned all hostage takings by all sides.|$|E
5|$|On 30 June 2011, the Special Tribunal for Lebanon, {{established}} {{to investigate the}} death of Hariri, issued arrest warrants against four senior members <b>of</b> <b>Hezbollah,</b> including Mustafa Badr Al Din.

5|$|Back in the 1980s, the {{ideology}} <b>of</b> <b>Hezbollah</b> {{was described as}} radical. It {{is presented in the}} 1985 manifesto. The first objective was fighting against American and Israeli imperialism, freedom of the occupied Southern Lebanon and all other occupied territories. The second objective was to gather all Muslims in the concept of ummah; then Lebanon would continue the 1979 Revolution of Iran. It also declared it would protect all Lebanese communities except the ones which collaborated with Israel, and supported all national movements—Muslim or non-Muslim—throughout the world. The Ideology has been changed, and today Hezbollah is a left-wing political entity focused on social injustice.|$|E
5|$|Capturing bin Laden {{had been}} an {{objective}} of the U.S. government from the presidency of Bill Clinton {{until his death in}} 2011. Ijaz asserted that in 1996, prior to bin Laden's expulsion from Sudan, the Sudanese government allegedly offered to arrest and extradite him to the United States. Khartoum's offer included detailed intelligence about the growing militancy <b>of</b> <b>Hezbollah,</b> Hamas, Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood and Iran's Revolutionary Guard, among other groups operating in the region. Ijaz further asserted that U.S. authorities allegedly rejected each offer despite knowing of bin Laden's involvement in training terrorists in Somalia, some of whom were allegedly involved in supporting militia members that downed U.S. Black Hawk helicopters in Mogadishu in October 1993. Any evidence of bin Laden's involvement in criminal activity against U.S. interests, such as training militia members who attacked U.S. troops in 1993, could have been grounds for indicting him far before Sudan expelled the Saudi fugitive in May 1996.|$|E

5000|$|According to Israel, the {{relation}} between the PRC and Hezbollah is more than coincidental. Israel alleges the organization enjoys financing and technical support from Hezbollah since its founding, and is a sort <b>of</b> proxy <b>of</b> <b>Hezbollah's</b> influence in the Gaza Strip. [...] The organization outwardly projects this relation through its mimicry <b>of</b> the <b>Hezbollah</b> flag which also bears a fist clenching a Kalashnikov rifle and stylized writing.|$|R
25|$|The foreign {{relations}} <b>of</b> <b>Hezbollah</b> involve {{relations with other}} particularly Shia states, but also Sunni groups like those affiliated with the Palestinian cause; the group is also suggested to have operations outside the Middle East {{in places such as}} Latin America.|$|E

25|$|The {{incident}} {{prompted the}} start of the 2006 Lebanon War. Israel responded with airstrikes and artillery shelling <b>of</b> <b>Hezbollah</b> targets, and a naval blockade against Lebanon, followed by a ground invasion.

5000|$|In {{exceptional}} cases, bunkers {{have been}} found buried hundreds of feet underground, with several feet of concrete protection and enough food and living space to last for weeks without resupply. Some <b>of</b> <b>Hezbollah's</b> tunnels have been thousands of meters long. Israeli sources say that North Korean instructors traveled to Lebanon in 2004 and oversaw construction <b>of</b> <b>Hezbollah's</b> underground infrastructure. In 2013, a United States federal court found that North Korea gave Hezbollah [...] "advanced weapons, expert advice and construction assistance" [...] in building [...] "a massive network of underground military installations, tunnels, bunkers, depots and storage facilities in southern Lebanon." ...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{endeavour}} {{to shed light}} on the macro- and the microstructure of the fighters‟ testament videos of “The Islamic Resistance” – the military arm <b>of</b> Lebanese <b>Hezbollah.</b> The significance <b>of</b> this paper has been derived from {{the fact that there is}} a paucity of research in this precise field. As a result of the dearth in studies about the fighters‟ testament videos broadcast by militant organisations in the Middle East, this paper provides illumination on this genre in the media discourse <b>of</b> <b>Hezbollah's</b> military arm. Thus, this paper contributes to the existing knowledge by analysing a sample of fighters‟ testament videos broadcasted by “The Military Media Unit” of “The Islamic Resistance. ” The testaments constitute a part of the media discourse <b>of</b> <b>Hezbollah's</b> military arm. By utilising critical discourse analysis, the paper aims to show the structures of the testaments investigated, their forms of signification, how the image of the fighters is presented and how these testaments are embedded with religious beliefs. Thus, this paper illuminates how the fighters frame 'the self'. The results of the paper show the objectives of the testaments and provide an insight into the overall aims of the media discourse <b>of</b> <b>Hezbollah's</b> military arm...|$|R
