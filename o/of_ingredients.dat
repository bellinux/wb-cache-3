40|$|Branding can be {{utilized}} to build profitable customer relationships and to differentiate companies {{in a competitive}} market. In the vast expanding growth of companies’ competitiveness on the marketplace, there have been increases of attention towards the concept <b>of</b> <b>ingredient</b> branding. Majority <b>of</b> studies which examines the concept <b>of</b> <b>ingredient</b> branding mainly focuses on the manufacturing industry, and although much research have been done, there is a limited focus within the service environment. Purpose: To assess the relationship between consumers intention to purchase and brand knowledge in the context <b>of</b> <b>ingredient</b> branding within a service environment H 1 = Ingredient branding is predicted to generate a positive relation on consumers’ purchase intention.   H 2 = There is {{a positive relationship between}} brand awareness and consumers’ purchasing intention in the context <b>of</b> <b>ingredient</b> branding. H 3 = There is a positive relationship between brand image and consumers’ purchasing intention in the context <b>of</b> <b>ingredient</b> branding. The thesis was conducted as a quantitative research {{with the use of a}} questionnaire and later analyzed with the use of the statistical software program: SPSS. Ingredient branding and consumers’ intention to purchase did not indicate a relation. However, brand awareness and brand image illustrated a positive outcome in the context <b>of</b> <b>ingredient</b> branding within a service environment...|$|R

30|$|Summarising, {{the effect}} of COOL <b>of</b> main <b>ingredients</b> on the {{perceived}} quality of a finished product depends on the characteristics <b>of</b> the main <b>ingredient</b> and the reputation of its producing country in the agri-food sector. If the producing country <b>of</b> an <b>ingredient</b> has a poor reputation, the origin statement will lower {{the image of the}} finished product made in another country; if an ingredient is recognised for good quality, COOL <b>of</b> <b>ingredient</b> can improve the image of the finished product, becoming a marketing instrument. In other ordinary cases, {{the effect of}} COOL would not be evident.|$|R
5|$|Another {{clinical}} {{and public health}} concern is the proliferation of substandard antimalarial medicines resulting from inappropriate concentration <b>of</b> <b>ingredients,</b> contamination with other drugs or toxic impurities, poor quality ingredients, poor stability and inadequate packaging. A 2012 study demonstrated that roughly one-third of antimalarial medications in Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa failed chemical analysis, packaging analysis, or were falsified.|$|E
5|$|Cubeb reached Africa {{by way of}} the Arabs. In Moroccan cuisine, cubeb is used in savory {{dishes and}} in {{pastries}} like markouts, little diamonds of semolina with honey and dates. It also appears occasionally in the list <b>of</b> <b>ingredients</b> for the famed spice mixture Ras el hanout. In Indonesian cuisine, especially in Indonesian gulés (curries), cubeb is frequently used.|$|E
5|$|English cuisine {{encompasses}} the cooking styles, traditions and recipes associated with England.

Some experts answered “No”, while some said “Yes” or “possible”. One expert made a general affirmation: “It could either lower or increase it - depends on the products and the countries involved”. Moreover, three experts respectively said: “The quality <b>of</b> <b>ingredient</b> may be more important than the processing”; “COOL <b>of</b> main <b>ingredients</b> would just provide accurate information about where ingredients come from”; when a producing country <b>of</b> main <b>ingredients</b> has a poor reputation, “such labeling would encourage countries with weaker food safety regulations to step up and change their regulations for the better.” [...]...|$|R

5|$|The player {{starts the}} game with three lives. Several {{ingredients}} will fly around the screen simultaneously, and if the player touches an ingredient with their body, a life will be deducted. The player's objective {{is to put the}} ingredients into the cooking bowl before they either fall into the dustbins on either side or knock the player into the bowl. As a defence, Charlie the Cook can shoot flour sacks, which will push the ingredients further in the direction they are moving in. Bombs may also spawn in the game, which will allow the player to push the ingredients further than conventional flour sacks. The player has to push the right variety <b>of</b> <b>ingredients</b> into the bowl, which changes for each level. When the right amount <b>of</b> <b>ingredients</b> has been put in the bowl, a cake is baked and a new level begins.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, a {{researcher}} in Devon discovered a list <b>of</b> <b>ingredients</b> for a pasty tucked inside an audit book and dated 1510, calculating {{the cost of}} making a venison pasty. This replaced the previous oldest recipe, dated 1746, held by the Cornwall Records Office in Truro, Cornwall. The dish {{at the time was}} cooked with venison, in this case from the Mount Edgcumbe estate, as the pasty was then considered a luxury meal. Alongside the ledger, which included the price of the pasty in Plymouth, Devon, in 1509, the discovery sparked a controversy between the neighbouring counties of Devon and Cornwall as to the origin of the dish. However, the term pasty appears in much earlier written records {{from other parts of the}} country, as mentioned above.|$|E
5|$|Rice is {{the basic}} {{ingredient}} in ceremonial dishes, and {{is a very important}} element of Palestinian meals. Rice dishes are usually the main dish of Palestinian dinner, because they consist of a variety <b>of</b> <b>ingredients</b> commonly found within the Palestinian land. Rice is usually not served alone or as a side dish (see ruz ma lahma below), but rather it is incorporated within a larger dish or tabeekh (dish), that would include soups, vegetables, and meat (chicken or lamb). Meat is almost always present in Palestinian dishes.|$|E
5|$|Since Madagascar gained {{independence}} from French colonial rule in 1960, Malagasy cuisine has reflected the island's diverse cultures and historic influences. Throughout the country, rice {{is considered the}} preeminent food and constitutes the main staple of the diet {{in all but the}} most arid regions of the south and west. Accompanying dishes served with rice vary regionally according to availability <b>of</b> <b>ingredients</b> and local cultural norms. Outside the home, Malagasy cuisine is served at simple roadside stalls (gargottes) or sit-down eateries (hotely). Snacks and rice-based meals may also be purchased from ambulatory street vendors. Upscale restaurants offer a wider variety of foreign cuisine and Malagasy dishes bearing French and other outside influences in preparation technique, ingredients and presentation alike.|$|E

50|$|In this formula, A is {{the volume}} <b>of</b> <b>ingredient</b> A and a is its mixture {{coefficient}} (i.e. a= 3%); B is volume <b>of</b> <b>ingredient</b> B and b is its mixture coefficient; and C is the desired volume C, and c is its mixture coefficient. So {{in the above}} example we get: A(0.03) + B(0.005) = 8oz(0.01). We know B = (8oz-A), and so can easily solve for A and B to get 1.6 and 6.4oz, respectively. Using this formula you can solve {{for any of the}} 6 variables A,a,B,b,C,c, regardless of whether you're dealing with medial, alternate, etc.|$|R

5|$|Some {{versions}} may use mayonnaise, {{other types}} of cheese, such as pepper jack cheese, brie cheese or Cheddar cheese instead of cream cheese as primary ingredients. Some may incorporate other seafoods in addition to crab, such as imitation crab, lobster, shrimp and surimi. Additional ingredients may include mushrooms, artichoke, onion, green onion, shallot, green pepper, bread crumbs (such as panko), heavy cream and others. Bread crumbs {{may be used to}} top the dish, which may be browned during the cooking process creating a crust. Sometimes Parmesan cheese is combined with the bread crumbs. Some versions use Old Bay Seasoning as an ingredient to add flavor, and some are prepared spicy with the addition <b>of</b> <b>ingredients</b> such as hot sauce and red pepper.|$|E
5|$|When being cooked, {{fried chicken}} is often divided into smaller pieces. The chicken is then {{generally}} {{covered in a}} batter, often consisting <b>of</b> <b>ingredients</b> such as eggs or milk, and a thickener such as flour. This is {{used to create a}} crust on the exterior of the meat. In addition, seasoning is often added at this stage. Once the chicken is ready to be cooked, it is placed in a deep fryer, frying pan or pressure cooker (depending on the method used) and fried in lard or a type of oil.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there were}} many other small {{pharmaceutical}} companies in the United States, Eli Lilly and Company distinguished itself from the others by having a permanent research staff, inventing superior techniques for the mass production of medicinal drugs, and its strong focus on quality. At first, Lilly was the company's only researcher, but as the business grew, he established a research laboratory and employed others who were dedicated to creating new drugs. Lilly hired his first full-time research chemist, Ernest G. Eberhards, and botanist, Walter H. Evans, in 1886. The department's methods of research were based on Lilly's. He insisted on quality assurance and instituted mechanisms {{to ensure that the}} drugs being produced would be effective and perform as advertised, had the correct combination <b>of</b> <b>ingredients,</b> and had the correct dosages of medicines in each pill. He was aware of the addictive and dangerous nature of some of his drugs, and pioneered the concept of giving such drugs only to people who had first seen a physician to determine if they needed the medicine.|$|E
