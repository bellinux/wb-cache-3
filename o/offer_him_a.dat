5|$|Following his release, O'Keefe {{spent one}} month on trial at Aston Villa and {{impressed}} the club's coaching staff, including youth coach Gordon Cowans, but {{was forced to}} leave the club, who were only willing to <b>offer</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> one-year youth contract, after struggling to travel to the Midlands-based club on a regular basis as he continued to prepare for his GCSEs. He was also offered a trial with Nottingham Forest, scoring during a friendly match with the club but O'Keefe again moved on after the club stalled over offering him a contract, with Forest only willing to <b>offer</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> one-year youth deal.|$|E

5|$|In Bauer's view, the {{presence}} {{at one of}} the meetings of Gerhard Clages of the SS signals that Himmler was focusing on secret peace talks. Brand and Grosz arrived in Istanbul just two months before the attempted assassination of Adolf Hitler on 20 July 1944. Himmler knew that attempts might be made on Hitler's life, though not where and when. It is possible that he wanted to broker for peace in case Hitler did not survive, using low-level agents for plausible deniability, and if Hitler did survive, Bauer argues, Himmler could <b>offer</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> peace deal with the West that excluded the Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|Juventus {{confirmed}} on 18 October 2011 {{that the}} 2011–12 season would be Del Piero's last with the club. The 2011–12 season under new manager Antonio Conte, his former Juventus teammate, saw Del Piero being used sparingly, and mainly as a substitute, {{because of the}} summer arrival of forward Mirko Vučinić from Roma. Del Piero scored his first goal in the new Juventus Stadium on 24 January 2012, in a 3–0 win over Roma in the quarter-finals of the Coppa Italia. Later in the season, Del Piero stated that he was surprised at Juventus president Andrea Agnelli's announcement regarding the club's decision not to <b>offer</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> new contract.|$|E

5|$|Performances for St Helens gained Trautmann a {{reputation}} as an able goalkeeper, resulting in interest from Football League clubs. As the following season commenced, a number of League clubs showed interest in signing him. The first to <b>offer</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> contract was Manchester City, a club playing in {{the highest level of}} football in the country, the First Division. On 7 October 1949 Trautmann signed for the club as an amateur and turned professional shortly after.

5|$|The History of Yuan (chapter 134) {{records that}} a certain Ai-sie (transliteration of either Joshua or Joseph) from the country of Fu lin (i.e. the Byzantine Empire), {{initially}} {{in the service of}} Güyük Khan, was well-versed in Western languages and had expertise in the fields of medicine and astronomy that convinced Kublai Khan to <b>offer</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> position as the director of medical and astronomical boards. Kublai Khan eventually honored him with the title of Prince of Fu lin (Chinese: 拂菻王; Fú lǐn wáng). His biography in the History of Yuan lists his children by their Chinese names, which are similar to the Christian names Elias (Ye-li-ah), Luke (Lu-ko), and Antony (An-tun), with a daughter named A-na-si-sz.|$|E
5|$|The {{margin of}} the Empress Eudocia's copy of the Iliad has a note {{summarizing}} a Hellenistic poet who tells a different story of Orion's birth. Here the gods Zeus, Hermes, and Poseidon come to visit Hyrieus of Tanagra, who roasts a whole bull for them. When they <b>offer</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> favor, he asks {{for the birth of}} sons. The gods take the bull's hide and ejaculate or urinate into it and bury it in the earth, then tell him to dig it up ten months later. When he does, he finds Orion; this explains why Orion is earthborn.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the court {{vacation}} in August 1904, Hastings decided that {{it would be best to}} find a tenancy in a more prestigious set of chambers; Corbet only dealt with two or three cases a year, and solicitors were unlikely to give briefs to a barrister of whom they had never heard. The set of chambers below Corbet's was run by Charles Gill, a well-respected barrister. Hastings would be able to improve his career through an association with Gill, but Gill did not actually know Hastings and had no reason to <b>offer</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> place in his chambers. Hastings decided he would spend the court vacation writing a law book, and introduce himself to Gill by asking if he would mind having the book dedicated to him. Hastings wrote the book on the subject of the law relating to money-lending, something he knew very little about. He got around this by including large extracts from the judgements in cases related to money-lending, which increased the size of the book and reduced how much he would actually have to write.|$|E

5|$|For {{the next}} two seasons, after Sheffield Wednesday signed an influx of foreign players such as Paolo Di Canio and Benito Carbone, Humphreys failed to hold down a regular place and he only played a total of 31 matches in those two seasons. Humphreys was sent on loan to Scunthorpe United on 13 August 1999, where he played six matches and again scored twice. He was then sent on loan to Cardiff City where he played 11 matches, scoring twice. After a brief return to the Wednesday team for the 2000–01 season, Humphreys decided to leave Wednesday to play more first team {{football}} was allowed to join Cambridge United on trial. Humphreys impressed on trial, scoring 3 goals in 7 appearances, and it looked likely that Cambridge manager Roy McFarland was going to <b>offer</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> contract. However, Humphreys' trial was cut abruptly after he broke his foot. After the sacking of Roy McFarland, new Cambridge manager John Beck was reluctant to offer Humphreys a new contract until he had seen him play.|$|E
5|$|In July 2009, Port Vale's Micky Adams {{appointed}} Horsfield as player-assistant manager. He {{aimed to}} play a majority of Vale's games in the 2009–10 season while learning the ropes of management. He played in the opening four {{games of the season}} despite needing painkillers for a cracked rib and a cracked bone in his hand, the first broken bones he had ever suffered. The club reached the third round of the League Cup, but after three consecutive defeats, Adams placed the entire squad on the transfer list. He suffered from niggling injuries, in addition to a torn hamstring, which limited his appearances. This caused him to consider his retirement in the summer of 2010. Port Vale did not <b>offer</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> new playing contract, but did retain him on the coaching staff.|$|E
5|$|On July 1, 2010, Hamhuis {{became an}} {{unrestricted}} free agent {{and signed a}} six-year, $27 million contract with the Vancouver Canucks. Growing up in Smithers, British Columbia, he was specifically interested in signing with the Canucks during his pending free agency, which factored into his decision to sign with neither Philadelphia nor Pittsburgh. The Canucks had reportedly tried to acquire Hamhuis previously at the 2009–10 trade deadline, with Nashville asking for prospect Cody Hodgson and a first-round draft pick in exchange. Several days prior to his free agency, the Canucks traded for defenceman Keith Ballard from the Florida Panthers, which initially led Hamhuis to believe the Canucks would be no longer interested in him. However, on July 1, the Canucks were one of ten teams to <b>offer</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> contract and he signed with the club despite more lucrative deals of up to $5 million in salary and terms of seven years.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins with}} Ryan Key {{lying on his}} bed in an apartment. Suddenly, he gets {{swallowed}} by the bedsheets (this is where the track starts to play). The scene then shifts to Key in another dimension, ending {{up next to the}} wife of another man. The man notices Key, and he runs away from the man. Hiding in the bathroom, Key escapes through a window, where he ends up on a neighborhood street. Someone dressed in dark clothing gestures to <b>offer</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> drink, when Key notices he is in a bar filled with Asian people. During part of the video, it features the band performing in front of a crowd wearing suits. The chase continues through a hallway, underwater, to a hospital bed, and back. The video is based in a scene of the 1999 film Being John Malkovich, where Cameron Diaz chases Catherine Keener within the subconscious of Malkovich.|$|E
5|$|Tsutomu Satō {{published}} {{his work on}} the online web novel website, Shōsetsuka ni Narō, between October 12, 2008 and March 21, 2011. At some point during his publication on Syosetu, Satō sent an original work to Dengeki Bunko under a pseudonym. The original work's setting shared similarities to The Irregular at Magic High School causing an editor to deduce his identity and <b>offer</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> publication deal. On March 11, 2011, the author announced his work is going to be published as a light novel under the Dengeki Bunko imprint. The author expressed some regret turning free content into paid commodity and cited his financial needs as the reason. The illustrations accompanying the light novels were done by Kana Ishida. The first light novel volume was unable to accommodate the first story arc; deciding against cutting content from the web novel, it was split into two volumes and released a month later. On March 9, 2015, Yen Press announced its licensing of the light novels for English localization through Twitter. Yen Press' first volume is slated for April 2016.|$|E
5|$|Đuric's {{relationship}} with Singapore Armed Forces had been damaged with his attempted transfer to Sriwijaya. Following their {{decision not to}} <b>offer</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> new contract, he signed for Tampines Rovers in 2010. He scored 20 league goals {{in his first season}} there as the club finished in second place. He clinched three consecutive S.League titles with Tampines Rovers from 2011 to 2013, and four Charity Shield honours from 2011 to 2014. He became the first player to reach a milestone 300th goal on 27 September 2010 with two goals against Balestier Khalsa in the Singapore Cup. With 328 goals in 444 top division club appearances, Đuric was ranked by IFFHS as the world top scorer in July 2011.
