2500|$|In an {{interview}} <b>on</b> <b>All</b> <b>Things</b> <b>Considered,</b> Yale University history professor Beverly Gage, {{who is writing}} a biography of Hoover, stated that the film accurately conveys that Hoover came to the FBI as a reformer seeking [...] "to clean it up, to professionalize it," [...] and to introduce scientific methods to its investigation, eventually including such practices as fingerprinting and bloodtyping. She praises DiCaprio for conveying the tempo of Hoover's speech. However, she notes that the film's central narrative device in which Hoover dictates his memoirs to FBI agents chosen as writers, is fictitious: [...] "He didn't ever have the sort of formal situation that you see in the movie where he was dictating a memoir to a series of young agents, and that that is the official record of the FBI." [...] Historian Aaron J. Stockham of the Waterford School, whose dissertation was on the relationship of the FBI and the US Congress during the Hoover years, wrote on the History News Network of George Mason University, [...] "J. Edgar portrays Hoover as the man who successfully integrated scientific processes into law enforcement investigations.... There is no doubt, from the historical record, that Hoover was instrumental in creating the FBI's scientific reputation." [...] Stockham notes that Hoover probably did not write the FBI–King suicide letter to Martin Luther King, Jr., as the film portrays: [...] "While such a letter was written, Hoover almost certainly delegated it to others within the Bureau." ...|$|E

60|$|I was wonderfully {{relieved}} {{to find that}} my aunt and Dora's aunts rubbed <b>on,</b> <b>all</b> <b>things</b> <b>considered,</b> much more smoothly than I could have expected. My aunt made her promised visit {{within a few days}} of the conference; and within a few more days, Dora's aunts called upon her, in due state and form. Similar but more friendly exchanges took place afterwards, usually at intervals of three or four weeks. I know that my aunt distressed Dora's aunts very much, by utterly setting at naught the dignity of fly-conveyance, and walking out to Putney at extraordinary times, as shortly after breakfast or just before tea; likewise by wearing her bonnet in any manner that happened to be comfortable to her head, without at all deferring to the prejudices of civilization on that subject. But Dora's aunts soon agreed to regard my aunt as an eccentric and somewhat masculine lady, with a strong understanding; and although my aunt occasionally ruffled the feathers of Dora's aunts, by expressing heretical opinions on various points of ceremony, she loved me too well not to sacrifice some of her little peculiarities to the general harmony.|$|E
