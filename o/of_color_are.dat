In 2005, the media criticism organization Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR) released a study of C-SPAN's morning telephone call-in show Washington Journal, showing that Republicans were favored as guests over Democrats by a two-to-one margin during a six-month period that year, and that people <b>of</b> <b>color</b> <b>are</b> underrepresented. A 2007 survey released by the Center for Economic and Policy Research reported that C-SPAN covered conservative think tanks more than left-of-center think tanks.|$|E
5|$|Hebron Church is {{surrounded}} {{on three sides}} by a graveyard, consisting of about 700 granite, marble, slate and wooden headstones laid in semi-regular rows running northeast to southeast. The graveyard also abuts the northeastern elevation of the community building. Its interments date from about 1806 to the present; early headstones have deteriorated beyond recognition, and may be older than 1806. Slaves and other people <b>of</b> <b>color</b> <b>are</b> interred in a small area of the graveyard's southeastern section, with simpler markers than the cemetery's other headstones. Although its headstones are generally rectangular granite stones and large obelisks, the graveyard's earliest headstones were simple wooden boards. Several gravestones are ornately carved, including one modeled on a tree stump. The graveyard is active, with the most recent burials at the property's northern end. Dr. William Blum, Sr., an electrochemist at the National Bureau of Standards who invented a chrome plating technique used in banknote printing, is interred at the cemetery.|$|E

Throughout the video bursts <b>of</b> <b>color</b> <b>are</b> shown theatrically. As Gaga sings the line [...] "One second I'm a Koons then suddenly the Koons is me", she is transformed into a black swan/human hybrid. Gaga also wears hand-shaped lingerie and a seashell bra with matching shell decoration. Near the climax, the singer features in a violet, crystal-like scene, and at the end, Artpop is spelled using hand gestures.|$|E

500|$|The {{story and}} script {{were created by}} Suguro and Masaki Norimoto, and the script was written by Norimoto and Yasushi Otake. For Norimoto, his primary {{challenge}} was taking the story's themes—conflicts between justice and evil, the nature of God, and destiny—which were fairly common in RPGs, and put an original spin on them. He {{did not want to}} create specific heroes and villains, blurring the lines between friend and foe and having each character following their own understandable agenda. The team decided upon a steampunk aesthetic over a science fiction setting as the latter would necessitate an overly-distant future setting. It was also chosen as steampunk was a rarity in video games. The gun-based gameplay likewise drove the game to a more realistic setting. The Zenith System was conceived as equivalent to a supercomputer from science fiction, which ties into the story elements surrounding Zenith's control of humanity. The choice to make Zenith an impartial machine stems from the team not wanting an off-screen third party force to distract the player from the main narrative. The writers decided to make Zenith the product of an earlier culture rather than a contemporary creation. The Zenith System's influence over the fate of its people gave rise to the design motif of cogs, creating a [...] "world of clockwork". This motif of an inorganic force controlling humanity fits in with the theme of human strength finding expression, acting as a counterweight against Zenith's influence. The overall design of Basel mirrors its mechanical nature, being grim and inorganic, but dashes <b>of</b> <b>color</b> <b>are</b> present through references to the city's religion to balance this out.|$|E

By being studious of color they are studious of division; and while the chiaroscurist devotes himself to the {{representation}} of degrees of force in one thing--unseparated light, the colorists have for their function the attainment of beauty by arrangement of the divisions of light. And therefore, primarily, they {{must be able to}} divide; so that elementary exercises in color must be directed, like first exercises in music, to the clear separation of notes; and the final perfections <b>of</b> <b>color</b> <b>are</b> those in which, of innumerable notes or hues, every one has a distinct office, and can be fastened on by the eye, and approved, as fulfilling it.|$|E

Pure earths are without exception white when in powder; and the same earths which are the constituents of clay and sand, form, when crystallized, the emerald, ruby, sapphire, amethyst, and opal.

There is, however, I think, one law about distance, {{which has}} some {{claims to be}} {{considered}} a constant one: namely, that dullness and heaviness <b>of</b> <b>color</b> <b>are</b> more or less indicative of nearness. All distant color is pure color: it may not be bright, but it is clear and lovely, not opaque nor soiled; for the air and light coming between us and any earthy or imperfect color, purify or harmonize it; hence a bad colorist is peculiarly incapable of expressing distance. I do not of course mean that you are to use bad colors in your foreground by way of making it come forward; but only that a failure in color, there, will not put it out of its place; while a failure in color in the distance will at once do away with its remoteness; your dull-colored foreground will still be a foreground, though ill-painted; but your ill-painted distance will not be merely a dull distance,--it will be no distance at all.|$|E
