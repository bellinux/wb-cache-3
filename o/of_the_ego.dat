5|$|The Discourses are a {{collection}} of explanations and elucidations that Meher Baba has given on many topics that concern the advancement of the spiritual aspirant. Some {{of the most important}} topics treated are: sanskaras (mental impressions), Maya (the principle of illusion), the nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ego,</b> reincarnation, karma, violence and non-violence, meditation, love, discipleship, and God-realization. His explanations often include stories from the lore of India and the Sufi culture. One such story, the wise man and the ghost, shows the power that superstitious beliefs can have on a person, while another, Majnun and Layla, show how selfless love, even in human relations, can lead one to discipleship.|$|E

25|$|Jung's {{theory of}} {{neurosis}} {{is based on}} a psyche that consists of tensions between various opposite attitudes in a self-regulating dynamic. <b>The</b> <b>ego,</b> being <b>the</b> center <b>of</b> consciousness, represents <b>the</b> coalescing attitude <b>of</b> consciousness. <b>The</b> <b>ego's</b> attitude is in tension with a complementary and balancing attitude in the unconscious.|$|R
50|$|<b>Ego</b> {{integrity}} is <b>the</b> psychological concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ego's</b> accumulated assurance <b>of</b> its capacity for order and meaning. <b>Ego</b> identity is <b>the</b> accrued {{confidence that the}} inner sameness and continuity prepared in the past are matched by the sameness and continuity of one's meaning for others, as evidenced in <b>the</b> promise <b>of</b> a career. Body and ego control organ expressions. and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other attributes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dynamics <b>of</b> a physical system to face <b>the</b> emotions <b>of</b> <b>ego</b> death in circumstances which can summon, sometimes anti-theonymistic, self-abandonment.|$|R
25|$|Freud had {{likened the}} state of melancholia to {{mourning}} in his 1917 paper Mourning and Melancholia. He theorized that objective loss, such as {{the loss of a}} valued relationship through death or a romantic break-up, results in subjective loss as well; the depressed individual has identified with the object of affection through an unconscious, narcissistic process called the libidinal cathexis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ego.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} {{aspect of}} Jung's theory of neurosis is how symptoms can vary by psychological type. The hierarchy of discriminating psychological functions gives each individual a dominant sensation, intuition, feeling, or thinking function preference with either an extroverted or introverted attitude. The dominant is quite {{under the control}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ego.</b> But the inferior function remains a gateway for unconscious contents. This creates typical manifestations of inferior insight and behavior when extreme function one-sidedness accompanies the neurosis.|$|E
25|$|Self-{{consciousness}} and {{the consciousness}} of the apparent universe do not end after the dissolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ego</b> and several chapters of the book are dedicated to the states of consciousness gained by those who have transcended the ego. Also, most chapters of the book get into particular practices for the emancipation of consciousness from the ego, qualities that have to be developed by the individual, and examine important issues that have to be confronted in the process.|$|E
30|$|Goaded by <b>the</b> selfish impulses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> id, {{hemmed in}} by <b>the</b> moral {{constraints}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> superego, rebuffed by reality, <b>the</b> <b>ego</b> struggles to cope and to reduce the forces that work on it to some kind <b>of</b> harmony. <b>The</b> <b>ego</b> institutes delay in our instinctual behaviour: Look before you leap (Vaillant, [1995], p. 7).|$|R

50|$|Baer {{has also}} painted several autobiographical meditations on {{the twists and}} turns of her own life, most notably Altar <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Egos</b> (Through a Glass Darkly), (2004; {{collection}} Kröller-Müller Museum, Otterlo), Memorial for an Art World Body (Nevermore) (2009; collection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> artist), and a series of 6 works slated for exhibition at the Stedelijk Museum in 2013, provisionally titled In <b>the</b> Land <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Giants (2011; collection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> artist). Baer's writings over the years were brought together in Broadsides & Belles Lettres: Selected Writings and Interviews 1965-2010, which provide a general commentary on art as well as her own attitudes to her work.|$|R
25|$|The {{highlighting}} of {{the fact}} that corporeity intrinsically has a dimension of expressivity which proves to be fundamental to the constitution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ego</b> is one of the conclusions of The Structure of Behavior that is constantly reiterated in Merleau-Ponty's later works. Following this theme of expressivity, he goes on to examine how an incarnate subject {{is in a position to}} undertake actions that transcend the organic level of the body, such as in intellectual operations and the products of one's cultural life.|$|E
25|$|Resolution of {{the tension}} causing this type of {{neurosis}} involves a careful constructive study of the fantasies. The seriousness with which the individual (ego) must take the mythological aspects of the fantasies may compare with the regard that devoted believers have toward their religion. It is not merely an intellectual exercise, but requires {{the commitment of the}} whole person and realization that the unconscious has a connection to life-giving spiritual forces. Only a belief founded on direct experience with this process is sufficient to oppose, balance, and otherwise adjust the attitude <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ego.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{specific}} functions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ego,</b> {{as determined}} by the relative predominance of sense or intellect, are either functions of the senses (or organism) or functions of the intellect. The former fall into the two classes of feelings (subjective) and perceptions (objective); the latter, according as the receptive or the spontaneous element predominates, into cognition and volition. In cognition, thought is ontologically oriented to the object; and in volition it is the teleological purpose of thought. In the first case we receive (in our fashion) the object of thought into ourselves. In the latter we plant it out into the world. Both cognition and volition are functions of thought as well as forms of moral action.|$|E
50|$|Freud also {{explored}} how 'in cases <b>of</b> mania <b>the</b> <b>ego</b> and ego ideal have fused together...in a mood {{of triumph}} and self-satisfaction'. Grunberger considered such states as reaching back to the primal narcissistic elation, and as drawing on 'traces of this state of elation and megalomania, based on <b>the</b> notions <b>of</b> harmony and omnipotence'.|$|R
50|$|Huxley {{sounds in}} his book like Bates out of Oxford with a major in {{psychology}} and metaphysics. Bates wrote of relaxation but Huxley brings in transcendentalism. Tension and poor vision are caused by <b>the</b> refusal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individual <b>ego</b> to surrender to Nature.|$|R
50|$|Dr. Ormont's concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> observing <b>ego</b> extends {{familiar}} {{concepts in}} ego psychology and incorporates thinking from eastern philosophy. He has developed group leadership techniques {{to use the}} collective and individual observing egos within a group {{as a source of}} strength and potentiation for all group members.|$|R
25|$|Jung's {{theory of}} {{neurosis}} {{is based on}} the premise of a self-regulating psyche composed of tensions between opposing attitudes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ego</b> and the unconscious. A neurosis is a significant unresolved tension between these contending attitudes. Each neurosis is unique, and different things work in different cases, so no therapeutic method can be arbitrarily applied. Nevertheless, there is a set of cases that Jung especially addressed. Although adjusted well enough to everyday life, the individual has lost a fulfilling sense of meaning and purpose, and has no living religious belief to which to turn. There seems to be no readily apparent way to set matters right. In these cases, Jung turned to ongoing symbolic communication from the unconscious in the form of dreams and visions.|$|E
25|$|The Scottish born German writer John Henry Mackay {{found out}} about Stirner while reading a copy of Friedrich Albert Lange's History of Materialism and Critique of its Present Importance. Later he looked for a copy <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Ego</b> and Its Own and after being fascinated with it he wrote a {{biography}} of Stirner (Max Stirner – sein Leben und sein Werk), published in German in 1898. Mackay's propaganda of stirnerist egoism and of male homosexual and bisexual rights affected Adolf Brand who published the world's first ongoing homosexual publication, Der Eigene in 1896. Another later German anarchist publication influenced deeply by Stirner was Der Einzige. It appeared in 1919, as a weekly, then sporadically until 1925 and was edited by cousins Anselm Ruest (pseud. for Ernst Samuel) and Mynona (pseud. for Salomo Friedlaender).|$|E
25|$|It is {{in those}} two {{functions}} that the real life <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ego</b> is manifested, but behind them is self-consciousness permanently present, which is always both subjective and objective — consciousness of ourselves and of the non-ego. This self-consciousness is the third special form or function of thought — which is also called feeling and immediate knowledge. In it we cognize our own inner life as affected by the non-ego. As the non-ego helps or hinders, enlarges or limits, our inner life, we feel pleasure or pain. Aesthetic, moral and religious feelings are respectively produced by the reception into consciousness of large ideas — nature, mankind and the world; those feelings are {{the sense of being}} one with these vast objects. Religious feeling therefore is the highest form of thought and of life; in it we are conscious of our unity with the world and God; it is thus the sense of absolute dependence.|$|E
2500|$|According to Washburn transpersonal {{development}} follows <b>the</b> principles <b>of</b> a spiraling path. Central to {{his model}} is <b>the</b> understanding <b>of</b> a dynamic ground; a deep level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unconscious, with spiritual qualities, {{that the person}} is in contact with in <b>the</b> prepersonal stage <b>of</b> development. According to commentators Washburn describes three stages <b>of</b> human development; <b>the</b> pre-personal, the personal and the transpersonal, also described as; pre-egoic, egoic and trans-egoic. In the pre-stage (up to age 5) the child is integrated with the dynamic ground. Later in life this contact is weakened, and the prepersonal stage is followed by a new stage <b>of</b> development where <b>the</b> <b>ego</b> is dissociated from the dynamic ground. This happens through <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> repression, and marks <b>the</b> stage <b>of</b> adulthood, and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mental <b>ego</b> (egoic stage) ...|$|R
50|$|Harris also {{identifies}} {{from his}} medical practice examples {{of individuals with}} blocked out Adult ego states, who were psychotic, terrified and varied between <b>the</b> Parent <b>ego</b> state's archaic admonitions about {{the world and the}} raw emotional state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Child, making them non-treatable by therapy. For such cases, Harris endorses drug treatments, or electro-convulsive therapy, as a way to temporarily disrupt <b>the</b> disturbing <b>ego</b> states, allowing <b>the</b> “recommissioning” <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Adult <b>ego</b> state by therapy. Harris reports a similar approach to treating Manic Depression.|$|R
2500|$|Kaivalya Pada (34 sutras). Kaivalya {{literally}} means [...] "isolation", but {{as used in}} the Sutras {{stands for}} emancipation or liberation and is used interchangeably with moksha (liberation), which is <b>the</b> goal <b>of</b> yoga. <b>The</b> Kaivalya Pada describes <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> liberation and <b>the</b> reality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transcendental <b>ego.</b>|$|R
25|$|The mirror stage {{describes}} the formation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ego</b> via {{the process of}} objectification, the Ego being {{the result of a}} conflict between one's perceived visual appearance and one's emotional experience. This identification is what Lacan called alienation. At six months, the baby still lacks physical co-ordination. The child is able to recognize themselves in a mirror prior to the attainment of control over their bodily movements. The child sees their image as a whole and the synthesis of this image produces a sense of contrast with the lack of co-ordination of the body, which is perceived as a fragmented body. The child experiences this contrast initially as a rivalry with their image, because the wholeness of the image threatens the child with fragmentation—thus the mirror stage gives rise to an aggressive tension between the subject and the image. To resolve this aggressive tension, the child identifies with the image: this primary identification with the counterpart forms the Ego. Lacan understands this moment of identification as a moment of jubilation, since it leads to an imaginary sense of mastery; yet when the child compares their own precarious sense of mastery with the omnipotence of the mother, a depressive reaction may accompany the jubilation.|$|E

50|$|Existential {{phenomenology}} {{differs from}} transcendental phenomenology by its rejection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transcendental <b>ego.</b> Merleau-Ponty objects to <b>the</b> <b>ego's</b> transcendence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world, which for Husserl leaves the world {{spread out and}} completely transparent before the conscious. Heidegger thinks of a conscious being as always already in the world. Transcendence is maintained in existential phenomenology {{to the extent that}} <b>the</b> method <b>of</b> phenomenology must take a presuppositionless starting point - transcending claims about the world arising from, for example, natural or scientific attitudes or theories <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ontological nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world.|$|R
30|$|Reach {{centrality}} counts <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> actors that <b>the</b> <b>ego,</b> <b>the</b> actor <b>of</b> interest, {{can contact}} within k ties. This metric suggests <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> messages traveling between actors (Wasserman and Faust 1994). We anticipated {{that this would}} be an important measure because <b>the</b> <b>ego’s</b> ideas can travel indirectly to more actors. Figure  1, the red actor has a two-step reach of three because it has two direct ties plus one tie that can be reached through two steps.|$|R
500|$|Sigmund Freud {{viewed the}} {{struggle}} to delay gratification as a person's efforts to overcome the instinctive, libidinal drive <b>of</b> <b>the</b> id. According to classic psychoanalytic theory, a person's psyche is composed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> id, <b>ego</b> and superego. <b>The</b> id {{is driven by the}} pleasure principle: it wants physical pleasure, and it wants it now. <b>The</b> <b>ego,</b> operating under <b>the</b> reality principle, serves to moderate the id's desire for instant gratification against the superego, which is guided by a person's internalized sense of morality. According to psychoanalytic theory, a person with difficulty delaying gratification is plagued by intrapsychic conflict – <b>the</b> <b>ego</b> cannot adequately regulate the battle between the id and the superego – and experiences psychological distress, often in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> anxiety or [...] "neurosis".|$|R
500|$|According to author Santiago Fouz-Hernández, {{the video}} {{employed}} an identity-splitting strategy {{in which the}} two Madonnas fight each other. With this she was referencing her previous videos where such tactics have been employed, like the one for [...] "Music", [...] "Papa Don't Preach" [...] and [...] "Human Nature". Joanna Rydzewska, {{one of the authors of}} the book Representing Gender In Cultures analyzed that the violent imagery in the video was Madonna's way of portraying the violence she had faced during her [...] "tumultuous" [...] marriage with actor Sean Penn; she added that the video was a contrast to the [...] "tremendously independent artist she is". The end of the video sparked discussion about the words imprinted on the electric chair, a phrase that can be interpreted as [...] "great escape" [...] or [...] "freedom". According to The Sydney Morning Herald, some scholars of Judaism were riled by the Jewish religious texts and objects appearing in the video. One of Madonna's Kabbalah advisors, Michael Berg, explained that [...] "Hebrew letters Madonna displays, lamed, aleph, vov—roughly equivalent to L, A, V—form one of the 72 names of God and denote a diminishing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ego</b> to connect with joy and fulfillment." [...] According to him, donning tefillin represented [...] "diminution of the desire to receive and a strengthening of the desire to share. But for a woman to don tefillin is still not a common practice, and for a gentile to wear tefillin might be regarded by some Jews as sacrilege." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{black or}} red {{coloured}} Chamunda {{is described as}} wearing a garland of severed heads or skulls (Mundamala). She is described as having four, eight, ten or twelve arms, holding a Damaru (drum), trishula (trident), sword, a snake, skull-mace (khatvanga), thunderbolt, a severed head and panapatra (drinking vessel, wine cup) or skull-cup (kapala), filled with blood. Standing on a corpse of a man (shava or preta) or seated on a defeated demon or corpse (pretasana). Chamunda is depicted adorned by ornaments of bones, skulls, serpents. [...] She also wears a Yajnopavita (a sacred thread worn by mostly Hindu priests) of skulls. She wears a jata mukuta, that is, headdress formed of piled, matted hair tied with snakes or skull ornaments. Sometimes, a crescent moon is seen on her head. Her socket eyes are described [...] as so intense that it burns the evil of all three worlds. She is accompanied by fiends and goblins. She is also shown {{to be surrounded by}} skeletons or ghosts and beasts like jackals, who are shown eating the flesh of the corpse which the goddess sits or stands on. The jackal are her fearsome companions. The severed head and corpse represents the severing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ego.</b> The corpse hence is conquered by the Devi, showing that the Ego is conquered. The symbolism of the Devi is made as to where one is given the impression of the reality of life. This form as well as many of the other Eight Matrikas all show the reality of life. They show the bareness, non sugar coated version of reality. At times, she is depicted seated on a Preta, her vahana (mount or vehicle).|$|E
500|$|According to Crowley, every {{individual}} has a True Will, to {{be distinguished from}} the ordinary wants and desires <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ego.</b> The True Will is essentially one's [...] "calling" [...] or [...] "purpose" [...] in life. Some later magicians have taken this to include the goal of attaining self-realization by one's own efforts, {{without the aid of}} God or other divine authority. This brings them close to the position that Crowley held just prior to 1904. [...] Others follow later works such as Liber II, saying that one's own will in pure form is nothing other than the divine will. [...] Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law for Crowley refers not to hedonism, fulfilling everyday desires, but to acting in response to that calling. [...] The Thelemite is a mystic. [...] According to Lon Milo DuQuette, a Thelemite is anyone who bases their actions on striving to discover and accomplish their true will, when a person does their True Will, it is like an orbit, their niche in the universal order, and the universe assists them. [...] In order for the individual to be able to follow their True Will, the everyday self's socially-instilled inhibitions may have to be overcome via deconditioning. [...] Crowley believed that in order to discover the True Will, one had to free the desires of the subconscious mind from the control of the conscious mind, especially the restrictions placed on sexual expression, which he associated with the power of divine creation. He identified the True Will of each individual with the Holy Guardian Angel, a daimon unique to each individual. [...] The spiritual quest to find what you are meant to do and do it is also known in Thelema as the Great Work.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{contrasts}} two relatively independent {{forms of}} human development: waking up, {{the process and}} practices of psychospiritual awakening, and growing up, <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> moving from lesser narcissistic and ethnocentric self-identities towards mature postconventional self-identities with greater degrees of inclusion, perspective-taking, caring, and compassion. Each is a unique type of growth, contemplative and transformative, with different ways of engaging and differing goals and results. The former is about transcending or deconstructing <b>the</b> <b>ego</b> and <b>the</b> latter about building, strengthening, and diversifying <b>the</b> <b>ego.</b> Whereas <b>the</b> Buddhist tradition and contemplative practices aim at awakening and transcending samsara (worldly conditions) by cultivating compassion and taming the mind, the Western tradition cultivates greater degrees of care and compassion by developing a mature ego within samsara that is both social-justice and eco-justice informed. <b>The</b> project <b>of</b> transcending <b>the</b> <b>ego</b> {{should not be confused}} with growing and maturing <b>the</b> <b>ego.</b> Self-transcendence and self-development must inform each other, and both are necessary for realizing our full human potential...|$|R
