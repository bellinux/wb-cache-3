5|$|Although {{the central}} and local governments kept an {{enormous}} number <b>of</b> <b>records</b> about land property {{in order to assess}} taxes, it became common practice in the Tang for literate and affluent people to create their own private documents and signed contracts.

The prototype of this actually existed since the ancient Han dynasty, while contractual language became even more common and embedded into Chinese literary culture in later dynasties.|$|E
