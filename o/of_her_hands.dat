5|$|Saxobeats was commercialized {{with three}} {{different}} covers shot by Andrei Nemirschi. For European standard releases, it featured Stan wearing a bob {{in front of a}} black-white backdrop, with one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> being attached to her head. In Japan, the release was accompanied by a photograph of the singer standing with headphones on her shoulders against a black background. All deluxe editions featured Stan leaning on a plastic mannequin, sporting a blue blouse along with various accessories on her hand.|$|E
5|$|Schuur {{first learned}} {{to play the piano}} by ear. Though she later learned to read braille-written music, she found its use {{frustrating}} and impractical since it took away use of one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> while playing the piano; however, she frequently used braille-transcribed lyrics in performances and during recording sessions. One of her first public performances was at age ten, singing country music at Tacoma's Holiday Inn; a booking arranged by her aunt. Even when she was a student at the Washington School for the Blind, she would come home on weekends, perform on Friday and Saturday nights and take a train back to school for Monday classes.|$|E
5|$|The goddess {{carries her}} own severed head– {{sometimes}} {{on a platter}} or in a skull-bowl– in her left hand. Though no legend mentions a specific weapon for the beheading, she holds a scimitar, a knife or a scissor-like object in her right hand. Though generally depicted with two arms, manifestations of the goddess with four arms also exist. While her own severed head and the sword appear in two <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> the implements in the remaining arms vary: a scissor-like object, a skull-bowl collecting the dripping blood from her head or blood stream from her neck, or a severed head, sometimes identified {{as that of the}} god Brahma.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins with}} a scene of a leopard with glowing blue eyes (later {{revealed}} to be Kesha) walking down an alleyway. The song's title flashes {{on the screen and}} the video pans to Kesha. She walks down the alleyway with two men who grab another man. Kesha spray-paints a dollar sign on his chest. They come to a party where she and her friends flash their tattooed dollar signs on their wrists and forearms in order to enter. As they enter, everyone starts dancing and the party-goers' faces are shown changing into different animals'. In the following scene, Kesha is seen sitting on a chair with two men by her side. Jeffree Star then approaches Kesha. Kesha and Star engage in a choreographed dance battle; Star then shoots Kesha with a laser chain saw which she deflects with her bracelet, Kesha responds by shooting lasers out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> killing Star. After the battle the party-goers crawl around Kesha and she is seen holding a gold cup with a blue foaming liquid spilling {{over the top of the}} glass. As Kesha gives the party goers a drink, their faces turn into different kinds of animals. The video ends with everyone dancing and turning into half animal humans, Kesha however, drinks from the cup and turns back into a leopard.|$|E
25|$|Julia Pastrana (1834–1860) {{travelled}} {{throughout the}} United States in a freak show as the bearded lady, capturing {{the attention of}} many artists. She is portrayed as having dark extensive hairs distributed equally throughout the surface of her body, even on the palms <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands.</b> Originally, she was believed to have congenital hypertrichosis lanuginosa; however, the generalized form of the syndrome coupled with her gingival hyperplasia indicated that her condition was congenital terminal hypertrichosis. This was not confirmed until after her death, {{when it became clear}} that her X-linked syndrome resulted in terminal hairs.|$|E
25|$|A {{locomotive}} cut {{the car in}} half, killing {{my father}} instantly. When two brakemen jumped from the halted train, they saw a woman standing – dazed but erect – beside a mangled machine; with blood spouting (as the older said to me) out of her head. One <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> (the younger added) kept feeling her dress, {{as if trying to}} discover why it was wet. These men took my sixty-six year old mother by the arms and tried to lead her toward a nearby farmhouse; but she threw them off, strode straight to my father's body, and directed a group of scared spectators to cover him. When this had been done (and only then) she let them lead her away.|$|E

25|$|During the Spanish Second Republic, apparitions of the Virgin Mary {{were seen}} on Spanish soil at Ezquioga. Ramona Olazabal said that Mary had marked the palms <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> with a sword. Seers gained much {{credence}} in Integrist and Carlist circles. The visions at Ezquioga were widely {{covered in the}} press, as were sixteen other visitations of the Virgin reported in 1931 in Spain. Conservative elements in the Spanish Church actively encouraged the Fátima devotion {{as a way of}} countering the perceived threat of atheistic Communism. In Portugal and its former colony of Brazil, conservative groups were sometimes associated with the cult of Fátima. When Germany invaded Russia in 1941, some Catholics interpreted this in terms of the Fátima apparitions, and believed that the Virgin's prophecy was about to be fulfilled.|$|E
25|$|Antony and Cleopatra {{was never}} {{intended}} to be a tragedy; instead, Shakespeare gave the illusion of the tragedy as the two protagonists set out to become the heroes of the play and neither succeeded. Antony and Cleopatra are seen to have a passionate love for each other up till their demise as both are seen ending their lives for the other. Although the couple was seen as a pair that could not live without the other, it does not take much to be able {{to point out that the}} basis of their relationship lies on manipulation and lust. Enobarbus was able to see this as he never believed their love was true but instead a contradiction. Cleopatra always wanted Antony to be in the palm <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> to always be in control of his emotions and would thus manipulate him by dancing whenever he was sad or fake a sickness if he were to be happy. This makes Antony only chase after Cleopatra even more in a never-ending cycle. They both try to be much more than they are and show their enemies and the world that they are invincible. Rather than them sacrificing themselves for the other, the two protagonists set out to become the hero of the play and to show that being the last one standing, no hand will bring them down but their own. They did not die for love but for the fame that would come behind that sacrifice and in the end are seen as being noble and self-sacrificing. It does not end in a tragedy but in a bittersweet and almost happy ending.|$|E

500|$|... 'Fly Like A Bird', is a kitchen-sink, hyper-produced gospel number, but {{is really}} quite moving. There is a real, human yearning for mercy in it — Mariah’s true cry for help from a place of near-suicidal despair: 'Sometimes this life can be so cold /(Lord) I pray you'll come and [...] carry me home'. But there’s {{a lot of hope}} and faith in this wounded voice: Carey keeps, with {{touching}} conviction, a firm grip on the idea that some higher, divine intelligence out there loves her, even if nobody else does; even if she is lost to herself. It comes across emotionally, because her heart is fully in it — Mimi has been beaten, humiliated, heartbroken; joys have been slapped out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> quicker than she could appreciate them. She’s deeply confused, and God, she really needs help. Hell: We’ve all been there.|$|E
500|$|Charles Dickens, {{who visited}} in 1842, remarked favorably on the conditions: [...] "I cannot recall or {{separate}} one young face {{that gave me}} a painful impression; not one young girl whom, assuming it to be matter of necessity that she should gain her daily bread by the labour <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> I would have removed from those works if I had had the power"" [...] However, there was concern among many workers that foreign visitors were being presented with a sanitized view of the mills, by textile corporations who were trading on {{the image of the}} ‘literary operative’ to mask the grim realities of factory life. “Very pretty picture,” wrote an operative in the Voice of Industry, responding to a rosy account of life and learning in the mills, “but we who work in the factory know the sober reality to be quite another thing altogether”. The “sober reality” was twelve to fourteen hours of dreary, exhausting work, which many workers experienced as hostile to intellectual development.|$|E
500|$|Soon after {{composing}} [...] "Halo", Tedder {{worked with}} Kelly Clarkson on her fourth studio album, All I Ever Wanted (2009), {{for which they}} wrote [...] "Already Gone" [...] together. When the song came out, critics noted a resemblance to Beyoncé's [...] "Halo". Clarkson, however, initially stated that she was unaware of any similarities between the two songs. She eventually realized their resemblance when she listened to both recordings closely; the similarities are most notable in the backing tracks, which in both cases feature a melancholy piano, loud drums, and handclaps. Clarkson tried to prevent [...] "Already Gone" [...] from being included on All I Ever Wanted, but the decision was out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> as her album was already being printed when I Am... Sasha Fierce came out. She accused Tedder of using the same arrangement on both [...] "Already Gone" [...] and [...] "Halo", and complained that people would, incorrectly, assume she was stealing it from Beyoncé.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you!" [...] Her warm {{pressure}} {{on his hand}} tightened.

500|$|A.C. Bradley notes that, {{with the}} {{exception}} of the scene's few closing lines, the scene is entirely in prose with Lady Macbeth being the only major character in Shakespearean tragedy to make a last appearance [...] "denied the dignity of verse." [...] According to Bradley, Shakespeare generally assigned prose to characters exhibiting abnormal states of mind or abnormal conditions such as somnambulism, with the regular rhythm of verse being inappropriate to characters having lost their balance of mind or subject to images or impressions with no rational connection. Lady Macbeth's recollections – the blood on her hand, the striking of the clock, her husband's reluctance – are brought forth from her disordered mind in chance order with each image deepening her anguish. For Bradley, Lady Macbeth's [...] "brief toneless sentences seem the only voice of truth" [...] with the spare and simple construction of the character's diction expressing a [...] "desolating misery." [...] Lady Macbeth's compulsive washing <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> to rid them of blood is reminiscent of hand washing common among sufferers from Obsessive-compulsive disorder.|$|E
500|$|Capper had not died {{immediately}} as her murderers believed, {{and after}} they left she managed to scramble back up the embankment and stagger along the lane for approximately {{a quarter of a}} mile (400 m) to Compstall Road before being found at 06:10 by Barry Sutcliffe and two of his colleagues on their way to work. She told them: [...] "Over there, in the field. They burnt me, they put petrol on me." [...] They immediately took her to a nearby house and roused the residents, Michael and Margaret Coop, to call for an ambulance. Michael Coop said: [...] "Both her hands appeared like ash. Her legs were just like raw meat and her feet appeared to be badly charred. I was struck by how polite the victim was. She was constantly thanking my wife for her assistance." [...] Margaret Coop said: [...] "I instinctively went to put my arms around her but she pulled away because she could not bear to be touched. Her head was shaved and there were recent, not new, cuts to her head. Her face was almost featureless. Her hands were red raw and black at the fingertips. Her legs were red from top to bottom. She couldn't bear anything near her legs." [...] Capper drank six glasses of water, but was unable to hold the glass herself because of the injuries to her hands. Margaret Coop said: [...] "She looked like the victim of an attack in the Vietnam war. But I felt she would survive. I had this theory that, now she had got to somewhere she could be helped, she would live." [...] Capper was rushed to the hospital and was able to give the names of her six assailants and Powell's address before falling into a coma. The extent of her burns was such that her mother and stepfather were unable to recognise her, and she was positively identified by a partial fingerprint from her thumb, the only part <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> not severely burned. She died on 18 December 1992, without regaining consciousness.|$|E
500|$|Peter and Chris set up traps {{for each}} other as they fight. Lois then gets sick of the boys fighting, so the monkey tricks Peter and Chris into coming to dinner together. Chris and Peter admit they don't hate each other and vow to spend more time together. As they are doing this, they see Brian and Stewie running away from the chaotic Miley who is smashing vehicles, shops and houses. The monkey confronts her, and {{attempts}} to talk her out of her rampage (as well as her career), but Miley ends up kidnapping him and takes him {{to the top of a}} nearby skyscraper. Fortunately, Peter is able to recruit his neighbor, Quagmire, to shoot her down in a biplane, and a battle with Miley starts escalating. The monkey falls out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> and he grips onto a narrow ledge with one hand. Miley's skin, hair and clothes peel off, revealing her android skeleton and she tries to kill Peter and Quagmire with a rock, but fails. Eventually, she is pummelled off the top. Afterwards, the monkey falls off the ledge but is saved by Peter just before he hits the road far below. Stewie and Brian then see the broken Miley, where Stewie says Brian can now have sex with her, but Miley blows up seconds later. Stewie apologizes to Brian for missing his chance for sexual intercourse with Miley but then her dismembered arm falls back out of the sky in front of them and Brian wags his tails in excitement and tells Stewie that it's not too late to have sex with her, anticipating what's to happen with him next with her hand. Monkey then moves out of Chris's closet, and his friendly attitude also parts ways with him, saying he will [...] "go where he's needed", and moves to Tom Tucker's upside-down-faced son Jake's closet as his new haunt.|$|E

2500|$|By {{this time}} the rash had spread and covered all Parker's body, {{including}} the palms <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> and soles of her feet, and it was confluent on her face. [...] At 10pm {{she was on her}} way to Catherine-de-Barnes Isolation Hospital near Solihull. By 11pm all her close contacts, including her parents, were placed in quarantine. Her parents were later also transferred to Catherine-de-Barnes. The next day, poxvirus infection was confirmed by electron microscopy of vesicle fluid. Parker died of smallpox at Catherine-de-Barnes on 11 September 1978.|$|E
2500|$|... "Aristocratic cool", {{known as}} sprezzatura, has existed in Europe for centuries, {{particularly}} when relating to frank amorality and love or illicit pleasures behind closed doors; Raphael's [...] "Portrait of Baldassare Castiglione" [...] and Leonardo da Vinci's [...] "Mona Lisa" [...] are classic examples of sprezzatura. The sprezzatura of the Mona Lisa {{is seen in}} both her smile and the positioning <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands.</b> Both the smile and hands are intended to convey her grandeur, self-confidence and societal position. Sprezzatura means, literally, disdain and detachment. It {{is the art of}} refraining from the appearance of trying to present oneself in a particular way. In reality, of course, tremendous exertion went into pretending not to bother or care.|$|E
