Depth of incorporation in the top 30 cm of soil was evaluated by (1) recovery of incorporated spheres in 2 cm increments, (2) biocidal activity in 6 cm increments, and (3) cone resistance by 1. 5 cm increments to 45 cm.

Because all but two isolates were sensitive to dimethomorph and ametoctradin, the ability of these chemicals to manage Phytophthora is promising. Nevertheless, the presence of two insensitive isolates could portend general insensitivity to these chemicals as well.

40|$|A {{molecular}} approach {{based on}} the use of genus-specific nested-PCR primers (Scibetta et al., 2012; J. Microbiol. Meth. 88 : 356 - 368) was utilized to detect Phytophthora species in soil and root samples of potted ornamentals, collected across Apulia and Calabria, Southern Italy. Analyzed samples comprised many plant species with different levels of symptoms of decline on the canopy and root rots. Extraction protocols were optimized to obtain DNA samples of appropriate quality from soil and roots. The analysis of sequences after cloning of nested-PCR amplicons enabled the identification of different Phytophthora species including P. nicotianae, P. cinnamomi, P. cryptogea, P. palmivora and P. niederhauserii. Interestingly, a higher level of intraspecific variability was detected within each Phytophthora species if compared with results of previous reports obtained using the same method in natural ecosystems. Although, the existence of PCR artifacts due to Taq DNA polymerase errors cannot be completely excluded, the detection of the same genotypes (commonly differentiated by one or few polymorphic nucleotides) in different soil and/or root samples, confirmed the reliability of results. As a consequence the higher intraspecific variability detected in <b>ornamental</b> <b>nurseries</b> seem to be the results of a more intensive sexual recombination favored by the concurrent cultivation of many plant species which increases the meeting of different genetically distant isolates of the pathogens...|$|E

40|$|Agricultural water {{consumption}} accounts for 70 % {{of the total}} available freshwater. Because the competition for this limited resource is increasing dramatically, optimising agricultural Water Use Efficiency (WUE) is a necessity. Achieving this target requires a shift from maximizing productivity per unit of land area to maximizing productivity per unit of water consumed. In commercial <b>ornamental</b> <b>nursery</b> production, irrigation is crucial to achieve the crop return, both in term of yield quantity and quality. Therefore, irrigation is often performed inefficiently since nurseries tend to over-irrigate plants. The difficulty in estimating the water requirements of ornamentals, the irrigation systems utilized, {{the large number of}} plant species/cultivars, and the production conditions (high-intensive cultivation methods, pot plants) are other variables that contribute to such inefficiency. Maximizing WUE, can be achieved by reducing water losses and promoting crop growth. New precision irrigation technologies and up-to-dated irrigation systems would enable growers to apply water and agrochemicals more efficiently.

The research has been divided into four phases which chronologically followed one another: composts production; growing media preparation and characterization; environmental analysis; rosemary bio-agronomical evaluation. Six different biomasses, mixed with different percentage relations, were composted for 4 months, obtaining eight composts with which as much peat free growing media have been prepared (SC 1 - SC 8). LCA of growing media production in Southern Italy has been carried out to gain more knowledge about the environmental impact and resource use along the substrata chain.

Furthermore, a bio-agronomical trial has been conducted comparing the eight peat-free growing media with the conventional peaty one (Speat), in order to evaluate the visual quality in rosemary containerised plants. The original hypothesis has turned out, in the experimental conditions in which we have worked, only partly valid.

Nine had ITS sequences that grouped them in defined taxonomic groups (P. nicotianae, P. citrophthora, P. meadii, P. taxon Pgchlamydo, P. cinnamomi, P. parvispora, P. cambivora, P. niederhauserii and P. lateralis) whereas three phylotypes were associated to two or more taxa (P. citricola taxon E or III; P. pseudosyringae, P. ilicis or P. nemorosa; and P. cryptogea, P. erythroseptica, P. himalayensis or P. sp. ‘kelmania’) that can be challenging to resolve with ITS 1 sequences alone.

Although populations of P. ramorum in Europe and the United States are largely distinct from one another, the organism is considered invasive in both locations with an operating hypothesis that it was introduced on both continents (Brasier and others 2004). It is possible that P. ramorum may have originated somewhere in Asia and was unknowingly transported on commercial or privately collected ornamental plants. Asia is a center of diversity for many genera of plants that are P. ramorum hosts. More specifically, northern Yunnan Province in the People’s Republic of China has an abundance of oaks and tanoaks in a variety of forest ecosystems. Rhododendrons and azaleas, among others, have been widely collected in this region for at least 150 years by plant enthusiasts from across the globe. Furthermore, the climatic conditions {{in this part of the}} Province correlate well with those predicted to be favorable for P. ramorum...|$|R
40|$|In 2007, Phytophthora {{isolates}} with atypical morphological {{and biological}} characteristics were found associated with root and collar rot of potted plants of Stoechas lavender (Lavandula stoechas) in an <b>ornamental</b> <b>nursery</b> in Italy. A polyphasic approach, including morphological and cultural observations, sequencing the ITS-rDNA region, the Pheca and the mitochondrial coxI genes, multiplex PCRs with primers specific for P. nicotianae or P. cactorum, {{as well as}} random amplified polymorphic DNA–polymerase chain reaction, was used to characterize these isolates. On the basis of morpho-cultural and molecular analyses, the isolates from Stoechas lavender were identified as Phytophthora × pelgrandis, a natural hybrid of P. nicotianae × P. cactorum previously reported in other European countries, the Americas, and Taiwan, as a pathogen of ornamentals and loquat plants. In pathogenicity tests using potted plants of Stoechas lavender, the P. × pelgrandis isolates, similarly to the parental species P. nicotianae, induced the symptoms observed on plants with natural infections and were reisolated only from artificially inoculated plants. Dispersal of P. × pelgrandis on this host could exacerbate {{the damage caused by}} Phytophthora root and collar rot, of which the main causal agent presently is P. nicotianae on lavender in Europe. Application of hygienic measures is important to reduce the proliferation and spread of the Phytophthora hybrids...|$|R
