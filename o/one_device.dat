5|$|The 5th {{generation}} iPad and 2nd generation iPad mini introduced {{support for}} many additional LTE bands worldwide. The iPad Air and Mini with Retina display cellular models {{come in two}} variants each, all of which support nano-SIMs, quad-band GSM, penta-band UMTS, and dual-band CDMA EV-DO Rev. A and B. Additionally, one variant of each iPad also supports LTE bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25 and 26 while the other variant supports LTE bands 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 18, 19, 20 and TD-LTE bands 38, 39 and 40. Apple's ability to handle many different bands in <b>one</b> <b>device</b> allowed it to offer, for the first time, a single iPad variant which supports all the cellular bands and technologies deployed by all the major North American wireless providers {{at the time of}} the device's introduction. Moreover, with T-Mobile USA selling the iPad Air and Mini with Retina display, these models became the first iPads that were made available for purchase directly from all four nationwide U.S. wireless carriers (and, as previously indicated, with all U.S. carriers now selling the same hardware variant of the device).|$|E

25|$|Because of {{the toxic}} {{materials}} used {{in the production of}} modern computers, obsolescence, if not properly managed, may lead to harmful environmental impacts.

The {{latest version of}} Cyanogen OS for this phone is 13.1.2-ZNH2KAS3P0-bacon based on Android Marshmallow 6.0.1(AOSP), released in August 2016. This brings latest September Security Patches for Android and improves the deep integration of [...] "Cortana"-Microsoft's Digital Assistant into Cyanogen OS due to strategic partnership between Microsoft and Cyanogen; Microsoft also being an important investor in the company. [...] Two in-house Lollipop-based distributions, OxygenOS and HydrogenOS, were released earlier, on 4 April 2015, outside and inside China respectively. On 9 April 2016, OnePlus <b>One</b> <b>devices</b> running Cyanogen OS started receiving Cyanogen OS 13.0.1 based on Android Marshmallow 6.0.1. Team Cyanogen started rolling out Cyanogen OS 13.1 on 10 June 2016. CyanogenOS 13.1 for OnePlus One includes mods for Skype, OneNote, Microsoft Hyperlapse and an updated Cortana mod.|$|R
25|$|When a {{compatible}} {{device is}} plugged in, the Windows AutoPlay dialog offers an additional option {{to use the}} flash drive {{to speed up the}} system; an additional ReadyBoost tab is added to the drive's properties dialog where the amount of space to be used can be configured. The minimum cache size is 250MB. In Vista or with FAT32 formatting of the drive, the maximum is 4GB. In Windows 7 with NTFS or exFAT formatting, the maximum cache size is 32GB per device. Windows Vista allows only <b>one</b> <b>device</b> to be used, while Windows 7 allows multiple caches, one per device, up to a total of 256GB.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to Ground Fault Circuit Interrupters (GFCIs), Arc-fault circuit interrupter devices (AFCI) are equally important as they offer added protection from potentially hazardous arc-faults resulting from damage in branch circuit wiring {{as well as}} extensions to branches such as appliances and cord sets. By detecting hazardous arc-faults and responding by interrupting power, AFCIs helps {{reduce the likelihood of}} the home's electrical system being an ignition source of a fire. Dual Function AFCI/GFCI devices offer both electrical fire prevention and shock prevention in <b>one</b> <b>device</b> making them a solution for many rooms in the home, especially when replacing an existing standard receptacle or existing ungrounded receptacle.|$|E
25|$|Different {{power supply}} types result in many {{different}} methods of bias. Bias is a technique by which active devices are set to operate in a particular region, or by which the DC component of the output signal is set to the midpoint between the maximum voltages available from the power supply. Most amplifiers use several devices at each stage; they are typically matched in specifications except for polarity. Matched inverted polarity devices are called complementary pairs. Class-A amplifiers generally use only <b>one</b> <b>device,</b> unless the power supply is set to provide {{both positive and negative}} voltages, in which case a dual device symmetrical design may be used. Class-C amplifiers, by definition, use a single polarity supply.|$|E

25|$|In February 2011, Nokia CEO Stephen Elop and Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer jointly {{announced}} a major business {{partnership between the}} two companies, which would see Nokia adopt Windows Phone as the primary platform for its future smartphones, replacing both Symbian and MeeGo. The deal also included the use of Bing as the search engine on Nokia devices, and the integration of Nokia Maps into Microsoft's own mapping services. Nokia {{announced that it would}} still release <b>one</b> <b>device</b> running the MeeGo platform in 2011, but that it would devote fewer resources to future development of the platform, and would phase out Symbian entirely. Aligning with Microsoft had been considered a possibility by analysts, due to Elop's prior employment with the company.|$|E
25|$|A {{microprocessor-based}} digital {{protection relay}} can replace {{the functions of}} many discrete electromechanical instruments. These relays convert voltage and currents to digital form and process the resulting measurements using a microprocessor. The digital relay can emulate functions of many discrete electromechanical relays in <b>one</b> <b>device,</b> simplifying protection design and maintenance. Each digital relay can run self-test routines to confirm its readiness and alarm if a fault is detected. Digital relays can also provide functions such as communications (SCADA) interface, monitoring of contact inputs, metering, waveform analysis, and other useful features. Digital relays can, for example, store multiple sets of protection parameters, which allows {{the behavior of the}} relay to be changed during maintenance of attached equipment. Digital relays also can provide protection strategies impossible to implement with electromechanical relays. This is particularly so in long distance high voltage or multi-terminal circuits or in lines that are series or shunt compensated They also offer benefits in self-testing and communication to supervisory control systems.|$|E
25|$|In September 2016, the BBC also {{announced}} that users {{would eventually be}} required to sign in with a BBC ID account to use the service. CBBC and CBeebies television content is exempt from the login requirement, but all other content requires a user login. In May 2017, iPlayer began to encourage users to login with a BBC ID in preparation for this change. Media outlets suggested that the account requirement was intended to help the BBC collect personal information {{that could be used}} to trace those who are evading TV Licensing whilst using iPlayer; Andrew Scott, launch director of the ongoing myBBC initiative, stated that the BBC may use account email addresses, along with existing methods, to help identify iPlayer users who do not hold a television licence. However, he noted the account system was primarily intended to provide personalization features across BBC properties, such as content recommendations on iPlayer, and the ability to continue watching a programme on <b>one</b> <b>device</b> from where it was left off on another.|$|E
