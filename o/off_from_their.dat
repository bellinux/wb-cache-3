However, the relationships between many of the species were not fully resolved in the study, so in the future, new species may be described.|$|E
5|$|East German {{citizens}} {{could also}} emigrate through the semi-secret route of being ransomed by the West German {{government in a}} process termed Freikauf (literally the buying of freedom). Between 1964 and 1989, 33,755political prisoners were ransomed. A further 2,087prisoners were released to the West under an amnesty in 1972. Another 215,000people, including 2,000children cut <b>off</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> parents, were allowed to leave East Germany to rejoin their families. In exchange, West Germany paid over 3.4 billion DM– nearly $2.3billion at 1990 prices– in goods and hard currency.|$|E

5|$|In December 1447, {{after leaving}} a {{protective}} force {{of three to}} four thousand men under Vrana Konti to guard the frontier {{in the event of}} an Ottoman incursion, Skanderbeg turned towards Dagnum with a force of 14,000 men. Initially offering the garrison at Dagnum the opportunity to surrender, he promptly besieged the fortress upon rejection. In order to pressure the Venetians, Skanderbeg also turned towards Durazzo, then another possession of Venetian Albania, and cut the city <b>off</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> local resources and trade. This move forced Venice to redirect to Durazzo two galleys, which initially were bound for Crete, in order to watch over the events there.|$|E
5|$|Swells from Fred reached wide {{stretches}} of the West African coastline, stirring up high seas {{as far north as}} Senegal. Along the shorelines between Dakar and M'Bour, rough surf devastated entire fishing districts and harbor towns, stranding boats and damaging roads and bridges. About 200houses were demolished in the district of Hann, many of which experienced total wall collapse; dwellings in the town of Bargny endured similar destruction. In the suburb of Rufisque, the waves overtopped dams, entered homes and cemeteries, and destroyed a mosque. Outside the capital area, several villages were completely cut <b>off</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> surroundings. Victims across the affected region received more than 100tons (220,000lbs) of rice and 12million CFA francs (US$20,000) in government relief funds.|$|E

5|$|The new Commander in Chief of the Polish Army, Jan Zygmunt Skrzynecki, {{was also}} {{hesitant}} {{to fight a}} major battle. Instead, he ordered Warsaw to be fortified and allowed the Russians to cross the Vistula unopposed. In his opinion, the war could only be won diplomatically, by interventions of the United Kingdom, Austria and France. Should those fail, Skrzynecki believed Warsaw would hold out at least several weeks under a siege, after which the main bulk of the Polish Army would still be intact to fight a decisive battle against the Russians, who by then would be cut <b>off</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> rear by the Vistula. On 10 August 1831 Skrzynecki {{was forced to resign}} and was replaced by Henryk Dembiński, the military governor of Warsaw.|$|E
5|$|An {{arrangement}} was negotiated whereby al-Adil was to administer Aleppo {{in the name}} of Saladin's son al-Afdal, while Egypt would be governed by al-Muzaffar Umar {{in the name of}} Saladin's other son Uthman. When the two sons were to come of age they would assume power in the two territories, but if any died, one of Saladin's brothers would take their place. In the summer of 1183, after ravaging eastern Galilee, Saladin's raids there culminated in the Battle of al-Fule in the Jezreel Valley between him and the Crusaders under Guy of Lusignan. The mostly hand-to-hand fighting ended indecisively. The two armies withdrew to a mile from each other and while the Crusaders discussed internal matters, Saladin captured the Golan Plateau, cutting the Crusaders <b>off</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> main supplies source. In October 1183 and then on 13 August 1184, Saladin and al-Adil besieged Crusader-held Karak, but were unable to capture it. Afterward, the Ayyubids raided Samaria, burning down Nablus. Saladin returned to Damascus in September 1184 and a relative peace between the Crusader states and the Ayyubid empire subsequently ensued in 1184–1185.|$|E
5|$|In July 2003 general {{elections}} were held again, and the CPP won. However, {{they failed to}} secure two-thirds of all parliamentary seats, {{as required by the}} constitution to form a new government. The two runner-up parties of the election, FUNCINPEC and SRP, blocked the CPP from doing so. Instead, in August 2003 they filed complaints with the Constitutional Council over alleged electoral irregularities. After their complaints were rejected, FUNCINPEC and SRP threatened to boycott the swearing-in ceremony of parliamentarians. Sihanouk coaxed both parties to change their decision, stating that he would abstain from presiding over the ceremony as well if they did not comply with his wishes. Both parties eventually backed <b>off</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> threats, and the swearing-in ceremony was held in October 2003, with Sihanouk in attendance. The CPP, FUNCINPEC, and SRP held additional talks into 2004 to break the political stalemate, but to no avail. At the same time, Sihanouk proposed a unity government jointly led by politicians from all three political parties, which Hun Sen and Ranariddh both rebuffed.|$|E

5|$|It {{was normal}} in fleet {{actions of the}} 18th century for the two lines of battle to pass one another sedately, exchanging fire at long ranges and then wearing away, often without either side losing a ship or taking an enemy. In contrast, Howe was {{counting}} on the professionalism of his captains and crews combined with {{the advantage of the}} weather gage to attack the French directly, driving through their line. However, this time he did not plan to manoeuvre in the way he had during the two previous encounters; each ship following in the wake of that in front to create a new line arrowing through his opponent's force (as Rodney had done at the Battle of the Saintes 12years earlier). Instead, Howe ordered each of his ships to turn individually towards the French line, intending to breach it at every point and rake the French ships at both bow and stern. The British captains would then pull up on the leeward side of their opposite numbers, cutting them <b>off</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> retreat downwind, and engage them directly, hopefully forcing each to surrender and consequently destroying the French Atlantic Fleet.|$|E
5|$|The {{pre-season}} saw no new signings as the young, mostly local squad {{that had}} {{finished second in}} the 1952–53 campaign was enough for manager Freddie Steele. Steele signed a three-year contract following his success the previous season. He considered signing Stoke City goalkeeper Dennis Herod, and the two parties held talks before he was instead sold to Stockport County for £500. Alf Jones was given his first professional contract, whilst Selwyn Whalley (who was training to become teacher), Harry Oliver and John Poole (both engineering apprentices) all were given part-time professional contracts. Don Bould and Ron Fitzgerald returned from national service to become full-time professionals. This gave the club a total of 21 full-time professionals, six part-time players and ten players aged 17–21 who could only play and train if they could find time <b>off</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> compulsory two-year national service. The strip was a traditional white shirt with black shorts, whilst the change kit of red and white stripes were donated by a friend of one of the club's directors, who was a Sunderland supporter.|$|E
5|$|The Hawaii hotspot is a {{volcanic}} hotspot {{located near the}} namesake Hawaiian Islands, in the northern Pacific Ocean. One of the most well-known and heavily studied hotspots in the world, the Hawaii plume {{is responsible for the}} creation of the Hawaiian – Emperor seamount chain, a chain of volcanoes over 5,800 kilometres (3,600mi) long. Four of these volcanoes are active, two are dormant, and more than 123 are extinct, many having since been ground beneath the waves by erosion as seamounts and atolls. The chain extends from south of the island of Hawaii {{to the edge of the}} Aleutian Trench, near the eastern edge of Russia. While most volcanoes are created by geological activity at tectonic plate boundaries, the Hawaii hotspot is located far from plate boundaries. The classic hotspot theory, first proposed in 1963 by John Tuzo Wilson, proposes that a single, fixed mantle plume builds volcanoes that then, cut <b>off</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> source by the movement of the Pacific Plate, become increasingly inactive and eventually erode below sea level over millions of years. According to this theory, the nearly 60° bend where the Emperor and Hawaiian segments of the chain meet was caused by a sudden shift in the movement of the Pacific Plate. In 2003, fresh investigations of this irregularity led to the proposal of a mobile hotspot theory, suggesting that hotspots are mobile, not fixed, and that the 47-million-year-old bend was caused by a shift in the hotspot's motion rather than the plate's.|$|E
