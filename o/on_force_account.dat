The governing equations of electro-mechanical characteristics are expressed by extended Stroh formalism. The boundary element method is applied to solve the finite domain problem in which the Green function derived according to boundary conditions is embedded. The essential nonlinear identification problem is solved by using the multiple loading modes and stepwise optimization to search for the global minimum solution. This paper successfully identifies the hole/crack size, location, and orientation in finite circular piezoelectric plates by using the strain/electric field data, stress/electric displacement data, or displacement/electric charge data from static loadings. The numerical results that confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method for hole/crack identification in circular piezoelectric plates are presented in details...|$|R

A compact brightening feature with a dimension of ¸ 12 Θ 5 arcsec 2 is observed in Soft X-rays.

Analysis of the sloshing motion of a contained liquid is of great practical importance. Motion of a fluid can persist beyond application of a direct load to the container; the inertial load exerted by the fluid is time-dependent and can be greater than the load exerted by a solid of the same mass. Hence the associated structural behavior must be investigated in the design of tanks. The container design (shape, materials with elastic, viscoelastic and elastoplastic behavior) can have a considerable effect on the dynamic damping of the sloshing waves. Internal baffles in tanks are also widely used for efficient sloshing wave damping. This paper describes the design and analysis of Water tank mounted on Heavy commercial vehicle (HCV) ...|$|R

This {{is the way to}} begin; but you can not begin unless you are at the beginning. If your children are partly grown, and you find that they are not under your command, the difficulty is much greater. The principles which should govern the management are the same, but they can not be applied by means so gentle.

40|$|Abstract What are {{we doing}} when we make {{inference}}s? I argue that to make an inference is to attach inferential force to an argument. Inferential force must be understood in analogy to assertoric force, and an argument is a structure of contents. I call this the “Force Account of inference. ” I develop this account by first establishing two criteria of adequacy for accounts of inference. First, such accounts must explain why it is absurd to make an inference one believes to be bad. The upshot is that if someone makes an inference, she must take her inference to be good. Second, accounts of inference must explain why we cannot take our inferences to be good [...] -in the sense that matters for inference [...] -by merely accepting testimony {{to the effect that}} they are good. Next, I spell out the <b>Force</b> <b>Account</b> in detail, and I show that it meets these two criteria of adequacy. According to the <b>Force</b> <b>Account,</b> we make an inference by reflectively endorsing the inference as good. That allows us to understand in what sense inference is a self-conscious and active manifestation of reason. I then demonstrate that the account can be fruitfully applied to debates in epistemology and practical philosophy. In particular, I show that the <b>Force</b> <b>Account</b> gives us the resources to settle debates about inferential internalism and pure moral testimony...|$|R
