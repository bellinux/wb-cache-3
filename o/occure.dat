In the costal city drug trafficking, gang violence and turf wars primarily between right-wing paramilitary networks and leftist rebels are rampant. The streets are regularly patrolled by soldiers. Abductions and sexual violence committed against girls <b>occure</b> regularly. Unemployment rates are high and wages are very low. The community largely consists of afro-colombians. Additionally Colombia has been dealing with an armed conflict between the FARC militia and the government. During this conflict crimes against humanity such as genocide, hostage-taking or other serious violations of liberty, torture, forced displacement, forced disappearance, extrajudicial executions and sexual violence have been taking place over and over again. Last year, 5% of the port city's population of 370,000 was forced to flee for their lives, according to Human Rights Watch. According to UNHCR since 1995 147,000 people have been displaced in the city. Human Rights Watch (HRW) stated that in 2013 violence drove more than 19,000 people from their homes in Buenaventura, more {{than in any other}} municipality in Colombia. Also according to human rights watch there had been 2.000 investigations on disappearances and forced displacements with no convictions.A report by the Norwegian Refugee Council stated: “Due to the sexual assault and abuse of women and girls in their homes or in public places, such as stores and on the way to school, women live in a state of fear. Mothers are afraid to let their daughters out alone. In Buenaventura, there is a sustained collective fear that undermines the community’s social welfare.” ...|$|E
