40|$|Multidisciplinary design {{optimisation}} (MDO) {{can be used}} as an effective tool to improve the design of automotive structures. Large-scale MDO problems typically involve several groups who must work concurrently and autonomously {{in order to make the}} solution process efficient. In this article, the formulations of existing MDO methods are compared and their suitability is assessed in relation to the characteristics of automotive structural applications. Both multi-level and single-level <b>optimisation</b> <b>methods</b> are considered. Multi-level <b>optimisation</b> <b>methods</b> distribute the design process but are complex. When optimising automotive structures, metamodels are often required to relieve the computational burden of detailed simulation models. The metamodels can be created by individual groups prior to the optimisation process, and thus offer a way of distributing work. Therefore, it is concluded that a single-level method in combination with meta-models is the most straightforward way of implementing MDO into the development of automotive structures. If the benefits of multi-level <b>optimisation</b> <b>methods,</b> in a special case, are considered to compensate for their drawbacks, analytical target cascading has a number of advantages over collaborative <b>optimisation,</b> but both <b>methods</b> are possible choices...|$|R

40|$|Heavy haul {{trains are}} a very {{efficient}} way to transport bulk material over land. One way to increase network capacity and reduce operating costs is to use longer and heavier trains. Worldwide, railway operators are increasing the length and weight of heavy haul trains. However, longer trains tend to exhibit larger steady state and dynamic longitudinal coupler forces. Large coupler forces can increase the probability of derailments, and cause increased wear and damage to coupling components. Driving strategies need to be determined {{to ensure that the}} train is operated efficiently, safely, without excessive wear and in a timely manner. Improved driving strategies can be created by using experienced drivers, field tests and simulator trials. Recently some computer based <b>optimisations</b> <b>methods</b> have been developed to also improve driving strategies. Computer based <b>optimisation</b> <b>methods</b> have the advantage that they can be used to more easily assess the effect of changing train configurations, track topography or speed restrictions. Current computer based optimisations are good at optimising energy and time but {{there is a lack of}} <b>optimisation</b> <b>methods</b> that also consider longitudinal train forces.

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is to address the urgent {{industrial}} need for energy efficient Computer Numerical Control machining systems by developing effective empirical energy consumption models and optimisation approaches for energy efficient machining processes. In the thesis, a comprehensive literature survey has been conducted to identify industrial needs, the state-of-the-art energy consumption modelling and <b>optimisation</b> <b>methods.</b> Related research has been analysed and benchmarked. Based on the survey, research gaps have been identified. To develop effective energy consumption models is {{an essential step to}} achieve sustainable machining processes. Based on literature survey, it is recognised that {{there is a lack of}} models suitable for various types of machining processes, in particular, milling processes. In this thesis, based on Main Effect and Interaction Plots techniques, qualitative analysis has been made to establish relationships between critical machining parameters (including spindle speed, feed rate, depth of cut and width of cut) and the energy required for machining. Effective energy consumption models that can be configurable for various machining processes have been developed. Two different model structures are proposed according to the model selection criteria used. Application of sensible <b>optimisation</b> <b>methods</b> will be imperative for implementing energy efficient machining processes. In this thesis, based on the energy consumption models, two <b>optimisation</b> <b>methods</b> have been developed to identify optimal machining parameters to achieve the minimum energy consumption during machining processes.

40|$|Cable-stayed bridges {{are one of}} {{the most}} popular types of long-span bridges. The {{structural}} behaviour of cable-stayed bridges is sensitive to the load distribution between the girder, pylons, and cables. The determination of pretensioning cable stresses is critical in the cable-stayed bridge design procedure. By finding the optimum stresses in cables, the load and moment distribution of the bridge can be improved. In recent years, different research works have studied iterative and modern methods to find optimum stresses of cables. However, most of the proposed methods have limitations in optimising the structural performance of cable-stayed bridges. This paper presents a multiconstraint <b>optimisation</b> <b>method</b> to specify the optimum cable forces in cable-stayed bridges. The proposed <b>optimisation</b> <b>method</b> produces less bending moments and stresses in the bridge members and requires shorter simulation time than other proposed methods. The results of comparative study show that the proposed method is more successful in restricting the deck and pylon displacements and providing uniform deck moment distribution than unit load method (ULM). The final design of cable-stayed bridges can be optimised considerably through proposed multiconstraint <b>optimisation</b> <b>method...</b>|$|E
40|$|Standard {{methods for}} {{computing}} the fractal dimensions of time series are usually tested with continuous nowhere differentiable functions, but not benchmarked with actual signals. Therefore they can produce opposite results in extreme signals. These methods also use different scaling methods, that is, different amplitude multipliers, {{which makes it}} difficult to compare fractal dimensions obtained from different methods. The purpose of this research was to develop an <b>optimisation</b> <b>method</b> that computes the fractal dimension of a normalised (dimensionless) and modified time series signal with a robust algorithm and a running average method, and that maximises the difference between two fractal dimensions, for example, a minimum and a maximum one. The signal is modified by transforming its amplitude by a multiplier, which has a non-linear effect on the signal&# 039;s time derivative. The <b>optimisation</b> <b>method</b> identifies the optimal multiplier of the normalised amplitude for targeted decision making based on fractal dimensions. The <b>optimisation</b> <b>method</b> provides an additional filter effect and makes the fractal dimensions less noisy. The method is exemplified by, and explained with, different signals, such as human movement, EEG, and acoustic signals...|$|E
