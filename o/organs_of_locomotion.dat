Differences in the larva might, also, become correlated with successive stages of its development; so that the larva, in the first stage, might come to differ greatly from the larva in the second stage, as is the case with many animals. The adult might also become fitted for sites or habits, in which <b>organs</b> <b>of</b> <b>locomotion</b> or of the senses, etc., would be useless; and in this case the metamorphosis would be retrograde.|$|E
60|$|In {{certain cases}} the {{successive}} steps of variation might supervene, from causes {{of which we}} are wholly ignorant, at a very early period of life, or each step might be inherited at an earlier period than that at which it first appeared. In either case (as with the short-faced tumbler) the young or embryo would closely resemble the mature parent-form. We have seen that this is the rule of development in certain whole groups of animals, as with cuttle-fish and spiders, and with a few members of the great class of insects, as with Aphis. With respect to the final cause of the young in these cases not undergoing any metamorphosis, or closely resembling their parents from their earliest age, we can see that this would result from the two following contingencies: firstly, from the young, during a course of modification carried on for many generations, having to provide for their own wants at a very early stage {448} of development, and secondly, from their following exactly the same habits of life with their parents; for in this case, it would be indispensable for the existence of the species, that the child should be modified {{at a very early age}} in the same manner with its parents, in accordance with their similar habits. Some further explanation, however, of the embryo not undergoing any metamorphosis is perhaps requisite. If, on the other hand, it profited the young to follow habits of life in any degree different from those of their parent, and consequently to be constructed in a slightly different manner, then, on the principle of inheritance at corresponding ages, the active young or larvæ might easily be rendered by natural selection different to any conceivable extent from their parents. Such differences might, also, become correlated with successive stages of development; so that the larvæ, in the first stage, might differ greatly from the larvæ in the second stage, as we have seen to be the case with cirripedes. The adult might become fitted for sites or habits, in which <b>organs</b> <b>of</b> <b>locomotion</b> or of the senses, &c., would be useless; and in this case the final metamorphosis would be said to be retrograde.|$|E
60|$|The boy {{was educated}} (so they call it) at Shrewsbury Grammar School, under sturdy Sam Butler, {{afterwards}} Bishop of Lichfield; {{and there he}} picked up so much Latin and Greek as was then considered absolutely essential to the due production of an English gentleman. Happily for the world, having no taste for the classics, he escaped the ordeal with little injury to his individuality. His mother had died {{while he was still}} a child, but his father, that 'acute observer,' no doubt taught him to know and love nature. At sixteen he went to Edinburgh University, then rendered famous by a little knot of distinguished professors, and there he remained for two years. Already at school he had made himself notable by his love of collecting--the first nascent symptom of the naturalist bent. He collected everything, shells, eggs, minerals, coins, nay, since postage stamps were then not yet invented, even franks. But at Edinburgh he gave the earliest distinct evidence of his definite scientific tastes by contributing to the local academic society a paper on the floating eggs of the common sea-mat, in which he had even then succeeded in discovering for the first time <b>organs</b> <b>of</b> <b>locomotion.</b> Thence he proceeded to Christ's College, Cambridge. The Darwins were luckily a Cambridge family: luckily, let us say, for had it been otherwise--had young Darwin been distorted from his native bent by Plato and Aristotle, and plunged deep into the mysteries of Barbara and Celarent, as would infallibly have happened to him at the sister university--who can tell how long we might have had to wait in vain for the 'Origin of Species' and the 'Descent of Man'? But Cambridge, which rejoiced already in the glory of Newton, was now to match it by the glory of Darwin. In its academical course, the mathematical wedge had always kept open a dim passage for physical science; and at the exact moment when Darwin was an undergraduate at Christ's--from 1827 to 1831--the university had the advantage of several good scientific teachers, and amongst them one, Professor Henslow, a well-known botanist, who took a special interest in young Darwin's intellectual development. There, too, he met with Sedgwick, Airy, Ramsay, and numerous other men of science, whose intercourse with him must no doubt have contributed largely to mould and form the future cast of his peculiar philosophical idiosyncrasy.|$|E

60|$|As the chelae of Crustaceans {{resemble}} in {{some degree}} the avicularia of Polyzoa, both serving as pincers, {{it may be}} worth while to show that with the former {{a long series of}} serviceable gradations still exists. In the first and simplest stage, the terminal segment of a limb shuts down either on the square summit of the broad penultimate segment, or against one whole side, and is thus enabled to catch hold of an object, but the limb still serves as an <b>organ</b> <b>of</b> <b>locomotion.</b> We next find one corner of the broad penultimate segment slightly prominent, sometimes furnished with irregular teeth, and against these the terminal segment shuts down. By an increase in the size of this projection, with its shape, {{as well as that of}} the terminal segment, slightly modified and improved, the pincers are rendered more and more perfect, until we have at last an instrument as efficient as the chelae of a lobster. And all these gradations can be actually traced.|$|R

In the twelfth edition of the "Syslema Naturae" Linne (1767) grouped all Branchiopoda known lo him under one genus, Monoculus (= wilh one eye). But the outline of our present systematical arrangement was given by Huller (1785), who was the first to subdivide Linne's Honoculus into several genera: Daphnia, Lynceus and Polyphemus. Latreille (1817) used Huller's syslem and called the Branchiopoda (= Entomostraca Huller) the fifth order of lhe Crustacea.

6000|$|Suppose that we {{had known}} nothing of the lobster but as an inert mass, an organic crystal, if I may use the phrase, and that we could {{suddenly}} see it exerting all these powers, what wonderful new ideas and new questions would arise in our minds!

[...] the chief new idea would be, the idea of adaptation to purpose,--the notion, that the constituents of animal bodies are not mere unconnected parts, but organs working together to an end. Let us consider {{the tail of the}} lobster again from this point of view. Morphology has taught us that it is a series of segments composed of homologous parts, which undergo various modifications--beneath and through which a common plan of formation is discernible.

60|$|Summary and Concluding Remarks on Insects.—Looking back to {{the several}} Orders, {{we have seen that}} the sexes often differ in various characters, the meaning of which is not understood. The sexes, also, often differ in their <b>organs</b> <b>of</b> sense or <b>locomotion,</b> so that the males may quickly {{discover}} or reach the females, and still oftener in the males possessing diversified contrivances for retaining the females when found.

60|$|With animals {{which have}} their sexes separated, the males {{necessarily}} {{differ from the}} females in their <b>organs</b> <b>of</b> reproduction; and these afford the primary sexual characters. But the sexes often differ in what Hunter has called secondary sexual characters, which are not directly connected with the act of reproduction; for instance, in the male possessing certain <b>organs</b> <b>of</b> sense or <b>locomotion,</b> <b>of</b> which the female is quite destitute, or in having them more highly-developed, in order that he may readily find or reach her; or again, in the male having special <b>organs</b> <b>of</b> prehension so as to hold her securely. These latter <b>organs</b> <b>of</b> infinitely diversified kinds graduate into, {{and in some cases}} can hardly be distinguished from, those which are commonly ranked as primary, such as the complex appendages at the apex of the abdomen in male insects. Unless indeed we confine the term “primary” to the reproductive glands, it is scarcely possible to decide, as far as the <b>organs</b> <b>of</b> prehension are concerned, which ought to be called primary and which secondary.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} {{an approach to}} the devel-opment of bipedal robotic control techniques for multiple locomotion behaviors. Insight into the fundamental behaviors <b>of</b> human <b>locomotion</b> is obtained through the examination of experimental human data for walking on flat ground, upstairs and downstairs. Specifically, it is shown that certain outputs of the human, independent <b>of</b> <b>locomotion</b> terrain, can be char-acterized by a single function, termed the extended canonical human function. Optimized functions of this form are tracked via feedback linearization in simulations of a planar robotic biped walking on flat ground, upstairs and downstairs — these three modes <b>of</b> <b>locomotion</b> are termed “motion primitives. ” A second optimization is presented, which yields controllers that evolve the robot from one motion primitive to another — these modes <b>of</b> <b>locomotion</b> are termed “motion transitions. ” A final simulation is given, which shows the controlled evolution of a robotic biped as it transitions through each mode <b>of</b> <b>locomotion</b> over a pyramidal staircase.
