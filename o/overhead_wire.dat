5|$|Traces of {{the railway}} {{can still be}} seen, {{including}} a cast iron pole that supported the <b>overhead</b> <b>wire,</b> {{the remains of the}} engine shed (burnt down in 2004), and a short section of track. Hellingly Hospital is now closed Approval for redevelopment as a housing complex was obtained in 2009.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{proposal}} {{had called}} for 22units, to replace all of the Kolsås and Holmenkoll Line stock. However, the Sognsvann and Røa Line was upgraded to metro standard between 1992 and 1995, and could start using T1000 stock with only third-rail support. At the time, the eastern network used third-rail, while the western network used <b>overhead</b> <b>wire.</b> The upgrade used non-utilised stock, so the order for T2000 was reduced to 12units.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{versions}} of the T1000 stock have earlier been used on the Oslo metro. This includes 146 cars of the types T1 through T4, that have third-rail only operation, and thus did not run on the Holmenkollen and Kolsås lines. These ran usually in units of three or six (sometimes four or five) cars. Types T5 to T8, 49 in total, delivered with both third-rail and <b>overhead</b> <b>wire</b> equipment, normally ran on the Holmenkollen line (two cars) and Kolsås line (three cars).|$|E
50|$|The French Culoz-Modane railway was {{electrified}} with 1500 V DC third rail, later {{converted to}} <b>overhead</b> <b>wires</b> {{at the same}} voltage. Stations had <b>overhead</b> <b>wires</b> from the beginning.|$|R
50|$|Until May 1911, part of {{the system}} was {{equipped}} with conduit supply to avoid unsightly <b>overhead</b> <b>wiring</b> on the central section of the tramway. From May 1911, <b>overhead</b> <b>wiring</b> was introduced.|$|R
2500|$|Since {{electrification}} generally predated double-stacking, the <b>overhead</b> <b>wiring</b> was too low {{to accommodate}} it. However, India is building some freight-only corridors with the <b>overhead</b> <b>wiring</b> at [...] above rail, which is high enough.|$|R
5|$|The T2000 {{operated}} on Line 1 of the T-bane, and replaced the aging HkB 600 teak wagons {{used on the}} Holmenkoll Line. The units were equipped with both third rail and <b>overhead</b> <b>wire</b> collectors, so they could operate on the Common Line and on the Holmenkoll Line. The trains were a prototype for a new design intended to replace the aging T1000 stock, but the MX3000 was chosen instead, as the T2000 did not perform satisfactorily. The T2000 were taken out of service in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Engineers Robert W. Blackwell & Co {{provided}} a small 0-4-0 electric locomotive capable of pulling two loaded coal wagons. It {{is not known}} where the locomotive was manufactured, as the company has no record, but {{the design of the}} controls suggests that it may have been imported from Germany. A small railcar with space for 12passengers was also provided. The locomotive and the railcar were each fitted with a single trolley pole to collect electricity from the <b>overhead</b> <b>wire.</b> The passenger car was used for the duration of passenger services on the line, and the locomotive from the electrification of the line until closure in 1959. At that time, it was the oldest operational electric locomotive in the British Isles.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, {{it was decided}} to upgrade the Røa and Sognsvann Lines to metro standard. This would allow them to use T1000 stock. Twelve T2000 were ordered in 1991, and would be {{sufficient}} to operate the services on the Holmenkollen and Kolsås Lines, that would retain an <b>overhead</b> <b>wire.</b> The development costs for the T2000 were in part subsidized by the government, as the high-tech product from Strømmens Verksted (by then part of the ABB Group) and AEG was seen as a future export product. The trains were delivered in 1994 and taken into use in 1995. The same year, the metro started operating all services through the city center, connecting the western and eastern networks.|$|E
50|$|For the {{purposes}} of inspection of <b>overhead</b> <b>wiring,</b> carriage 3CM was constructed to a modified design with an overhead compartment for inspectors to watch {{the way that the}} <b>overhead</b> <b>wiring</b> reacted to contact with pantographs.|$|R
50|$|The rail {{was removed}} in 2003-2004, {{and ended up}} at the Yarra Valley Tourist Railway, with all <b>overhead</b> <b>wiring</b> on the siding gone by this time. A dwarf signal and <b>overhead</b> <b>wiring</b> {{stanchions}} remain in the paper mill grounds themselves. The paper mill was closed in 2012.|$|R

5|$|Laying of {{the track}} was {{performed}} by Wiebe, signaling was installed by Norsk Jernbanedrift, Structon Rail installed the <b>overhead</b> <b>wire,</b> and YIT installed the power supply and telecommunications systems. The tunnel has the NSI-63 relay-based signaling system, although it {{was scheduled to be}} replaced by European Rail Traffic Management System shortly after 2015. The last six weeks before opening, the Vestfold Line was closed to allow the new and old sections to be connected. This was the most hectic part of construction, as it saw the tracks south of the tunnel be rearranged to allow trains to operate the opposite direction through the loop in Tønsberg. The work was performed by Reinertsen and took 100,000 man-hours.|$|E
5|$|By 1944, {{by which}} time Norway was {{occupied}} by Germany {{as part of the}} Second World War, <b>overhead</b> <b>wire</b> had been installed on the Flåm Line. The locomotives at Thune and nearly completed, except for the transformers, which were at Per Kure. This was during the height of resistance sabotage, and workers at Per Kure had joined the communist resistance group Osvald. Because of the Allied bombing of Germany, Per Kure was thought to become part of a decentralized production chain and would be set to assemble aircraft engines. Osvald considered the plant a legitimate target and on 30 May 1944, the factory was blown up and the transformers severely damaged. Reconstruction of them took considerable time, {{in part because of the}} general lack of materials, and in part because the head engineer for the project disappeared during late 1944. In 1945, all three locomotives were sent to Myrdal Station for storage until the transformers were finished.|$|E
5|$|During the 1980s, {{the city}} decided {{to connect the}} four {{suburban}} lines west of the city center with the Oslo Metro. The Sognsvann Line {{was selected as the}} first line to be upgraded, so the two systems would become compatible. The line was upgraded to metro standard by replacing the <b>overhead</b> <b>wire</b> with a third-rail power supply and installing automatic train protection. All the stations were rebuilt, with platforms lengthened from fitting two-car to fitting four-car trains, and the platform height increased. The third rail required all level crossings to be removed, resulting in the line being rebuilt several places to allow the road to underpass or overpass. The light rail permitted passengers to cross the lines at the stations, but this was made impossible with metro standard. Because of this, underpasses or overpasses were built at the stations.|$|E

50|$|The use of <b>overhead</b> <b>wires</b> allows {{higher power}} supply {{voltages}} to be used. Although <b>overhead</b> <b>wires</b> {{are more likely}} to be used on metro systems without many tunnels, an example of which is the Shanghai Metro, <b>overhead</b> <b>wires</b> are employed on some systems that are predominantly underground, as in Madrid. Lines that utilize street running while on the surface (such as Boston's Green Line) tend to derive power completely from <b>overhead</b> <b>wires,</b> both while traveling in a tunnel in the central city and at street level in the suburban areas, as a third rail would make the track unsafe for road vehicles, especially at level crossings. There are transit lines that make use of both rail and overhead power, with vehicles able to switch between the two (an example of this being in Rotterdam and formerly in Chicago).|$|R

5000|$|The Galveston Island Trolley cars {{look like}} vintage {{electric}} trolleys, but actually they are modern build and diesel-electric powered. Therefore, {{there are no}} <b>overhead</b> <b>wires</b> in Galveston.

25|$|On July 26, 1886, the Flushing and College Point Street Railway was incorporated, {{with the}} intent of {{building}} what became the College Point Line. The then-villages of Flushing and College Point granted franchises to the company in summer 1887, with the provision of only employing overhead trolley wire for five years before switching to battery power. The line began operation on April 7, 1891, running on batteries instead of <b>overhead</b> <b>wire.</b> Because of the expenses of battery power, the railroad went bankrupt and was sold at auction on April 4, 1892. The line was later equipped with <b>overhead</b> <b>wire,</b> improving profits and patronage. On December 31, 1896, the line became part of the New York and Queens County Railway system.|$|E
25|$|However, on most railway {{vehicles}} using <b>overhead</b> <b>wire,</b> {{the trolley}} pole {{has given way}} to the bow collector or, later, the pantograph, a folding metal device that presses a wide contact pan against the <b>overhead</b> <b>wire.</b> While more complex than the trolley pole, the pantograph has the advantage of being almost free from dewiring, being more stable at high speed, and being easier to raise and lower automatically. Also, on double-ended trams, they eliminate the need to manually turn the trolley pole when changing direction (although this disadvantage can be overcome to some extent through the use of trolley reversers). The use of pantographs (or bow collectors) exclusively also eliminates the need for wire frogs (switches in the overhead wiring) to make sure the pole goes in the correct direction at junctions.|$|E
