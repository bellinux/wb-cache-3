5|$|By 1909, {{the bulk}} of the castle was {{considered}} obsolete and the War Office transferred it to the Office of Works, who carried out restoration work and <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> visitors. It reentered service during the First World War, equipped with two quick-firing guns to protect the harbour, but they did not see service during the conflict. After the war, the castle was restored and leased to the town, who again <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> visitors. Between 1940 and 1943, during the Second World War, it was rearmed with two 4.7-inch (11.9 cm) quick-firing guns, dating from the First World War and housed in concrete gun houses, to protect merchant convoys and the Philips' shipyard. The castle was manned by members of the British Army; officers lived in a nearby cottage, non-commissioned officers in the castle itself, and other ranks in the 19th century fortifications, and later in temporary Nissen huts.|$|E
5|$|On July 4, 1916, the Webb {{house was}} {{opened to the}} public with a 25 cent {{admission}} charge, but the American entry into World War I and the rationing of gasoline took its toll on Nutting's business. Nutting sold the house in 1919 to The National Society of the Colonial Dames of America in Connecticut, which <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the public as a historic house museum.|$|E
5|$|The castle saw service {{during the}} English Civil War of 1642 to 1646, during which its {{vulnerability}} to {{attack from the}} land became apparent, resulting in the Gallants Bower defensive work above it being used to provide additional protection. In 1748, a new gun position called the Grand Battery {{was added to the}} castle, equipped with twelve guns. After years of neglect in the early 19th century, the castle was upgraded in 1859 with modern artillery, but defending the port of Dartmouth was no longer a military priority. By {{the early years of the}} 20th century the castle was considered redundant by the authorities, who <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> visitors. It was brought back into use during the First and Second World Wars, but in 1955 it was finally retired from service. In the 21st century, it is managed by English Heritage and the castle received 37,940 visitors in 2007.|$|E

25|$|Inside {{the temple}} chamber was a Chac Mool statue and a throne {{in the shape}} of Jaguar, painted red and with spots made of inlaid jade. The Mexican {{government}} excavated a tunnel {{from the base of the}} north staircase, up the earlier pyramid's stairway to the hidden temple, and <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> tourists.

25|$|Toronto's {{third and}} current Union Station was {{constructed}} between 1914–1920 by the TTR. Prince Edward, Prince of Wales officially <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> {{the public on}} August 6, 1927, in a lavish ribbon cutting ceremony using a pair of gold scissors. In attendance were Prince George, Lieutenant Governor of Ontario William Donald Ross and his wife, Prime Minister of Canada William Lyon Mackenzie King, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Stanley Baldwin and Mrs. Baldwin, Premier of Ontario George Howard Ferguson, and many {{other members of the}} Government of Ontario and Government of Canada.|$|E
25|$|Several initial assaults failed {{until the}} Doge had the ships tied into pairs, thus {{doubling}} their momentum as the sailed against the fortifications. As the Venetians seized two towers, the Frankish Crusaders took a gate and <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> their comrades. Alexios V tried to rally a counter-attack but when this failed, he fled to Thrace with his mistress Eudokia Angelina {{and her mother}} Euphrosyne Doukaina Kamatera. There Alexios V and Eudokia were married, solidifying hie relation to the Angeloi. He was later captured by the Crusaders in 1205 and flung to death.|$|E
25|$|In 1986, Anderson's husband, Orpheus Fisher, {{died after}} 43 years of marriage. Anderson {{remained}} {{in residence at}} Marianna Farm until 1992, one year before her death. Although the property was sold to developers, various preservationists {{as well as the}} City of Danbury fought to protect Anderson's studio. Their efforts proved successful and the Danbury Museum and Historical Society received a grant from the State of Connecticut, relocated the structure, restored it, and <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the public in 2004. In addition to seeing the studio, visitors can see photographs and memorabilia from milestones in Anderson's career.|$|E

25|$|On 18 March 1808, 200 Imperial French {{soldiers}} {{asked to}} be admitted within the precincts of the fortress and were allowed in, since the French {{were believed to be}} allies. Once inside, they seized the main gate and <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> an entire regiment. The stunned Spanish garrison was quickly expelled. Since its capture, the French had used Sant Ferran as a major supply base for the sieges of Roses in 1808 and Gerona in 1809. But after three years, the French generals grew complacent and in April 1811 the key fort was only held by an Italian provisional battalion.|$|E
25|$|The Library Company {{suffered}} financial troubles {{during the}} Great Depression {{and was forced}} to sell the Locust Street building and consolidate the collections in the Ridgway Library on South Broad Street. As its fortunes improved after the war, the institution focused on its mission as a scholarly research library. In {{the second half of the}} 20th century, under the direction of Edwin Wolf, an energetic program of renewal brought the Library Company once more into a busy and vital center of national importance for research and education. The Library Company completed a new building on Locust Street, also named the Ridgway Library, in 1965, and <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the public in April 1966.|$|E
25|$|In 2005 Vitter {{introduced}} a resolution supporting prayer at school board meetings {{in response to}} an earlier district court decision that the Louisiana's Tangipahoa Parish practice of opening meetings with Christian prayers was unconstitutional. The bill died in committee after receiving little support from colleagues {{on both sides of the}} aisle. Vitter later reintroduced the resolution in January 2007 after a panel of the Fifth Circuit Court concluded that Christian prayers were unconstitutional but was undecided whether nonsectarian prayers were allowed. In July 2007, the full Fifth Circuit dismissed the case because of a lack of standing. The school board subsequently resumed prayer evocations but <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> diverse community religions. Vitter's bill died in committee.|$|E

25|$|When Mrs. Brehm died in 1962, the Old Mill was willed to the City of San Marino. The {{city has}} {{preserved}} {{the building and}} <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the public as a museum and art gallery (California Art Club Gallery), operated first by the California Historical Society and later by the Old Mill Foundation. The museum is open Tuesday through Sunday from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. A model showing how the mill operated {{is located on the}} ground floor of the museum. While nothing remains of the waterwheel, two of the millstones (pictured above) are displayed in the garden area. The millstones were found more than a century after the mill closed on the grounds of the Huntington Library by General George S. Patton, who grew up in the area and recalled seeing them used as blocks for mounting horses. There is also a 16th-century volcanic rock fountain in the patio to the east of the mill. The fountain was acquired in Mexico by Mrs. Brehm's daughter, Mrs. Albert Doerr.|$|E
25|$|The {{owner of}} the {{property}} in 1614 did not alter or further publicize the tomb. He must have resealed it, hid the entrance and kept its location a secret, for whatever reasons, as it disappeared from public knowledge and was lost again, despite publication of the inscription. In 1780 the then owners of the vineyard, the brothers Sassi, who apparently {{had no idea it}} was there, broke into the tomb again during remodelling of their wine cellar. They <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the leading scholars of the day. Someone, perhaps them, fragmented the slabs covering the loculi, with the obvious intent of accessing the contents, being careful to preserve the inscriptions. If the act is to be attributed to the Sassi, and if the motive of treasure-hunting is to be imputed to them, they found no treasure. What they did find they turned over to the Vatican under Pope Pius VI, including the gold signet ring taken off the finger bone of Barbatus. Apparently some masonry was placed in the tomb with an obscure intent.|$|E
25|$|In 1901, in Scotland, he gave $10 {{million to}} {{establish}} the Carnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland. It was created by a deed which he signed on June 7, 1901, and it was incorporated by Royal Charter on August 21, 1902. The establishing gift of $10 million was, then, an unprecedented sum: at the time, total government assistance to all four Scottish universities was about £50,000 a year. The aim of the Trust was to improve and extend the opportunities for scientific research in the Scottish universities and to enable the deserving and qualified youth of Scotland to attend a university. He was subsequently elected Lord Rector of University of St. Andrews in December 1901. He also donated {{large sums of money}} to Dunfermline, the place of his birth. In addition to a library, Carnegie also bought the private estate which became Pittencrieff Park and <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> all members of the public, establishing the Carnegie Dunfermline Trust to benefit the people of Dunfermline. A statue of him stands there today.|$|E

25|$|Prior to 1922, Woodhaven Boulevard was {{the only}} {{important}} north-south street in town. However, it ended at Liberty Avenue. Then officials decided to expand Woodhaven Boulevard all the way south to the Rockaways and finally <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> traffic in 1925. This made Ozone Park more accessible by both bus and car. Since cars were also becoming more popular at that time, the land became much more valuable, leading to a construction boom {{in an attempt to}} fill any empty lot. Between 1921 and 1930, Ozone Park saw a population increase of over 180% from 40,000 to 112,950 people. With this extraordinary increase in population came the need for schools and sources of entertainment. In response to this demand came the construction of John Adams High School in 1930. This school was built just as the construction boom slowed down and right before the Great Depression. Furthermore, in 1925 the development of the Cross-Bay Movie Theatre gave residents the ability to go and see a show while also connecting with neighbors.|$|E
25|$|The Walnut Depot or Walnut Avenue Depot {{was located}} {{on the south side}} of 132nd Street at Walnut Avenue east of the Hell Gate Bridge in Port Morris, Bronx, on the {{coastline}} of the East River and the mouth of the Bronx Kill. The address was 900 East 132th Street. NYCTA bought the former warehouse from the F. W. Woolworth Company for $1.8 million in 1979, and rebuilt it into an operating bus depot, and <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> buses on April 3, 1983, replacing the old and dilapidated West Farms Depot which was closed on the same date, and also to relieve overcrowding at the existing Coliseum and Kingsbridge Depots. On February 21, 1993, the Walnut depot closed for rehabilation and was replaced by the current Kingsbridge Depot which reopened that same day after undergoing reconstruction. Walnut reopened in 1995 and replaced the Coliseum Depot, which by then closed for rehabilitation as well. The depot was planned to be closed around 2000, but was abruptly sold in early 1998 to the Empire State Development Corporation and later the Galesi Group for the construction of a new printing plant for the New York Post. Walnut Depot permanently closed in spring 1998, replaced by the Michael J. Quill Depot. At the time of its closure, it housed 220 buses, and operated the following Bronx routes, Bx4/4A, Bx6, Bx11, Bx13, Bx15, Bx17, Bx19, Bx33, Bx35, Bx41, and Bx55 Limited which was later discontinued, and replaced with a Bx15 Limited in 2013 instead. The depot was demolished in order to construct the Post printing plant.|$|E
500|$|The Pell family, a {{politically}} important clan with influence throughout American history (from William C. C. Claiborne, the first Governor of Louisiana, to a Senator from Rhode Island, Claiborne Pell), restored the fort in 1909 and formally <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the public. [...] The ceremonies, which commemorated the 300th {{anniversary of the}} discovery of Lake Champlain by European explorers, were attended by President William Howard Taft. [...] Stephen Hyatt Pell, who spearheaded the restoration effort, founded the Fort Ticonderoga Association in 1931, which is now responsible for the fort. Funding for the restoration also came from Robert M. Thompson, the father of Stephen's wife Sarah Gibbs Thompson.|$|E
