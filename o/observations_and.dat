40|$|AbstractDeveloping <b>observation</b> <b>and</b> {{reflection}} competences within {{school experience}} process {{is crucial in}} order to gain teaching profession. In fact, in merging practical and theoretical knowledge through teaching practice requires in-depth <b>observation</b> <b>and</b> reflection competences. Teaching practicum and school experience courses have aims to develop field knowledge, plan and preparation, teaching methods and techniques, communication, classroom management, evaluation, professionalism by developing <b>observation</b> <b>and</b> reflection competences. Significantly, portfolio is a kind of progress tool to make prospective teachers to report on teaching practicum. In this respect, this study aims to evaluate the development of <b>observation</b> <b>and</b> reflection competences of prospective teachers on school experience courses. The qualitative research design was employed in this study that case study approach was implemented within an inductive process. Self-reports of 65 prospective teachers helped to gather qualitative data that were analyzed based on thematic analysis. This research process yielded how <b>observation</b> <b>and</b> reflection, self-determination competences are significant and are developed through teaching practicum...|$|R

5|$|A second {{competing}} {{theory for}} extratropical cyclone development over the oceans is the Shapiro-Keyser model, developed in 1990. Its main {{differences with the}} Norwegian Cyclone Model are the fracture of the cold front, treating warm-type occlusions and warm fronts as the same, and allowing the cold front to progress through the warm sector perpendicular to the warm front. This model was based on oceanic cyclones and their frontal structure, as seen in surface <b>observations</b> <b>and</b> in previous projects which used aircraft to determine the vertical structure of fronts across the northwest Atlantic.|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, many neuroimaging studies have {{assessed}} {{the human brain}} networks underlying action <b>observation</b> <b>and</b> imitation {{using a variety of}} tasks and paradigms. Nevertheless, questions concerning which areas consistently contribute to these networks irrespective of the particular experimental design and how such processing may be lateralized remain unresolved. The current study aimed at identifying cortical areas consistently involved in action <b>observation</b> <b>and</b> imitation by combining activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis with probabilistic cytoarchitectonic maps. Meta-analysis of 139 functional magnetic resonance and positron emission tomography experiments revealed a bilateral network for both action <b>observation</b> <b>and</b> imitation. Additional subanalyses for different effectors within each network revealed highly comparable activation patterns to the overall analyses on <b>observation</b> <b>and</b> imitation, respectively, indicating an independence of these findings from potential confounds. Conjunction analysis of action <b>observation</b> <b>and</b> imitation meta-analyses revealed a bilateral network within frontal premotor, parietal, and temporo-occipital cortex. The most consistently rostral inferior parietal area was PFt, providing evidence for a possible homology of this region to macaque area PF. The <b>observation</b> <b>and</b> imitation networks differed particularly with respect to the involvement of Broca's area: whereas both networks involved a caudo-dorsal part of BA 44, activation during observation was most consistent in a more rostro-dorsal location, i. e., dorsal BA 45, while activation during imitation was most consistent in a more ventro-caudal aspect, i. e., caudal BA 44. The present meta-analysis thus summarizes and amends previous descriptions of the human brain networks related to action <b>observation</b> <b>and</b> imitation...|$|R

40|$|Background. Action <b>observation</b> <b>and</b> motor imagery {{activate}} neural structures {{involved in}} action execution, thereby facilitating movement and learning. Although some benefits of action <b>observation</b> <b>and</b> motor imagery {{have been reported}} in Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD), methods have been based on stroke rehabilitation and may be less suitable for PD. Moreover, previous studies have focused on either observation or imagery, yet combining these enhances effects in healthy participants. The present study explores the feasibility of a PD-specific home-based intervention combining <b>observation,</b> imagery, <b>and</b> imitation of meaningful everyday actions. Methods. A focus group was conducted with six people with mild to moderate PD and two companions, exploring topics relating to the utility and feasibility of a home-based <b>observation</b> <b>and</b> imagery intervention. Results. Five themes were identified. Participants reported their experiences of exercise and use of action <b>observation</b> <b>and</b> motor imagery in everyday activities, and the need for strategies to improve movement was expressed. Motivational factors including feedback, challenge, and social support were identified as key issues. The importance of offering a broad range of actions and flexible training was also highlighted. Conclusions. A home-based intervention utilising action <b>observation</b> <b>and</b> motor imagery would be useful and feasible in mild to moderate PD...|$|R
