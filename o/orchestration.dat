5|$|Offenbach often {{composed}} amidst {{noise and}} distractions. According to Keck, Offenbach would first {{make a note}} of melodies a libretto suggested {{to him in a}} notebook or straight onto the librettist’s manuscript. Next using full score manuscript paper he wrote down vocal parts in the centre, then a piano accompaniment at the bottom possibly with notes on <b>orchestration.</b> When Offenbach felt sure the work would be performed, he began full <b>orchestration,</b> often employing a codified system.|$|E
5|$|Another death {{brought about}} a {{creative}} renewal. The passing of Tchaikovsky presented a twofold opportunity—to write for the Imperial Theaters and to compose an opera based on Nikolai Gogol's short story Christmas Eve, a work on which Tchaikovsky had based his opera Vakula the Smith. The success of Rimsky-Korsakov's Christmas Eve encouraged him to complete an opera approximately every 18 months between 1893 and 1908—a total of 11 during this period. He also started and abandoned another draft of his treatise on <b>orchestration,</b> but made a third attempt and almost finished it {{in the last four}} years of his life. (His son-in-law Maximilian Steinberg completed the book in 1912.) Rimsky-Korsakov's scientific treatment of <b>orchestration,</b> illustrated with more than 300 examples from his work, set a new standard for texts of its kind.|$|E

5|$|For {{much of his}} life, Rimsky-Korsakov {{combined}} his {{composition and}} teaching with {{a career in the}} Russian military—at first as an officer in the Imperial Russian Navy, then as the civilian Inspector of Naval Bands. He wrote that he developed a passion for the ocean in childhood from reading books and hearing of his older brother's exploits in the navy. This love of the sea might have influenced him to write two of his best-known orchestral works, the musical tableau Sadko (not to be confused with his later opera of the same name) and Scheherazade. Through his service as Inspector of Naval Bands, Rimsky-Korsakov expanded his knowledge of woodwind and brass playing, which enhanced his abilities in <b>orchestration.</b> He passed this knowledge to his students, and also posthumously through a textbook on <b>orchestration</b> that was completed by his son-in-law, Maximilian Steinberg.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, Khachaturian {{entered the}} Moscow Conservatory to study {{composition}} under Nikolai Myaskovsky and <b>orchestration</b> under Sergei Vasilenko. In 1933, he married the composer Nina Makarova, {{a fellow student}} from Myaskovsky's class. He finished the conservatory in 1934 {{and went on to}} complete his graduate work in 1936.|$|E
5|$|Musical {{instrument}} {{development was}} dominated by the Occident from 1400 on, indeed, the most profound changes occurred during the Renaissance period. Instruments took on other purposes than accompanying singing or dance, and performers used them as solo instruments. Keyboards and lutes developed as polyphonic instruments, and composers arranged increasingly complex pieces using more advanced tablature. Composers also began designing pieces of music for specific instruments. In {{the latter half of}} the sixteenth century, <b>orchestration</b> came into common practice as a method of writing music for a variety of instruments. Composers now specified <b>orchestration</b> where individual performers once applied their own discretion. The polyphonic style dominated popular music, and the instrument makers responded accordingly.|$|E

5|$|A {{trend towards}} greater {{authenticity}} began after Hammond's orchestrations in the 1970s provided {{a basis for}} staging the work in its original form. This process was further aided by the discovery in the 1990s of Bizet's 1863 conducting score. In this, the orchestral parts were reduced to six staves, but notes and other markings in the manuscript provided additional clues to the original <b>orchestration.</b> These new finds {{became the basis for}} Brad Cohen's critical edition of the score, published by Edition Peters in 2002.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Currently {{exception}} handling for web service <b>orchestrations</b> is {{performed on the}} client side. We have defined composite web services [11] that are not single <b>orchestrations</b> but complete web services that contain all possible <b>orchestrations</b> of their sub-services. Our composite web services can therefore define and perform {{exception handling}} just once for all such <b>orchestrations,</b> on the server side. In this paper we explain and discuss our approach to server-side exception handling by composite services. ...|$|R
50|$|In a sense, service choreography and <b>orchestrations</b> are two flips of {{the same}} coin. On one hand, the roles of a service choreography can be {{extracted}} as service <b>orchestrations</b> through a process called projection. Through projection {{it is possible to}} realize skeletons, i.e. incomplete service <b>orchestrations</b> that can be used as baselines to realize the web services that participate to the service choreography. On the other hand, already existing service <b>orchestrations</b> may be composed in service choreographies.|$|R
40|$|International audienceServices Oriented Architectures have {{provided}} flexibility and agility for service consumers {{to build their}} business processes. An important issue concerning the service <b>orchestrations</b> supporting business processes is the Quality of Service (QoS). Service consumers put more and more importance to the QoS of their service <b>orchestrations</b> to be more competitive. Therefore, {{they need to know}} how much the service <b>orchestrations</b> fit their QoS expectations in order to measure their satisfaction. In this context, we propose an approach to evaluate the satisfaction degree of service <b>orchestrations</b> according to the service consumers expectations from QoS point of view. This approach is based on Workflow patterns aggregation rules and on the application of a Multi- Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) method. It helps service consumers to interpret the Quality of Service of their service <b>orchestrations</b> and to make a decision whenever they are no longer satisfied...|$|R
5|$|After he had {{recorded}} his <b>orchestration</b> of the chorale prelude Christ lag in Todesbanden, BWV718, in 1931, Leopold Stokowski recorded his arrangement for symphonic orchestra of BWV4's fourth movement in 1937. As Chorale from the Easter cantata Christ lag in Todesbanden the arrangement's score was copyrighted in 1950 {{and published by}} Broude Brothers. Later the arrangement was also recorded by José Serebrier and Robert Pikler.|$|E
5|$|Another {{influence}} of the Liao cultural tradition {{is seen in the}} Yuan dynasty's zaju (杂剧) theater, its associated <b>orchestration,</b> and the qu (曲) and sanqu (散曲) forms of Classical Chinese poetry. One documented way in which this influence occurred was through the incorporation of Khitan officers and men into the service of the Mongol forces during the first Mongol invasion of 1211 to 1215. This northern route of cultural transmission of the legacy of Liao culture was then returned to China during the Yuan dynasty.|$|E
5|$|His compositions, {{particularly}} those of his later period, are notable for their complex textures, rich harmonies and <b>orchestration,</b> and the elaborate use of leitmotifs—musical phrases associated with individual characters, places, ideas, or plot elements. His advances in musical language, such as extreme chromaticism and quickly shifting tonal centres, greatly influenced the development of classical music. His Tristan und Isolde is sometimes described as marking the start of modern music.|$|E

5|$|In 1871, Nikolai Zaremba {{resigned}} from the directorship of the Saint Petersburg Conservatory. His successor, Mikhaíl Azanchevsky, was more progressive-minded musically and wanted new blood to freshen up teaching in the Conservatory. He offered Rimsky-Korsakov a professorship in Practical Composition and Instrumentation (<b>orchestration),</b> as well as leadership of the Orchestra Class. Balakirev, who had formerly opposed academicism with tremendous vigor, encouraged him to assume the post, thinking it might be useful having {{one of his own}} {{in the midst of the}} enemy camp.|$|E

With Wyble, Lukather expanded his knowledge of wider aspects of music, including <b>orchestration.</b> It was during this period in the early 1970s that Lukather became interested in the idea of becoming a session musician, a vocation that provided opportunities to play with a variety of famous musicians.|$|E
5|$|In {{the view}} of his biographer Hugh Macdonald, Massenet's main {{influences}} were Gounod and Thomas, with Meyerbeer and Berlioz also important to his style. From beyond France he absorbed some traits from Verdi, and possibly Mascagni, and above all Wagner. Unlike some other French composers of the period, Massenet never fell fully under Wagner's spell, but he took from the earlier composer a richness of <b>orchestration</b> and a fluency in treatment of musical themes.|$|E
5|$|The Symphony No. 1 in C minor for {{full-scale}} orchestra {{was written}} in 1824, when Mendelssohn was aged 15.

For the third movement he substituted an <b>orchestration</b> of the Scherzo from his Octet. In this form the piece was a success, and laid the foundations of his British reputation.|$|E
