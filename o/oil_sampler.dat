5000|$|Oil Monitoring Analyst (OMA) is the {{certification}} for the Predictive Maintenance Professional that demonstrates {{competence in the}} field of machinery oil monitoring. Oil monitoring in this context consists of sampling and analyzing the oil properties to assess whether the oil needs service and/or to assess the mechanical health of the equipment being monitored. There are two types of OMA certifications. OMA I is for the <b>oil</b> <b>sampler,</b> the individual on the shop floor with responsibility for sampling the oil and the overall care of the equipment. OMA II is for the oil analyzer, the individual in the laboratory responsible for properly running the appropriate tests, data interpretation, program management, and related activities.|$|E

It was observed that the palm <b>oil</b> <b>samples</b> exhibit shear thinning property as a non-Newtonian fluid and its rheological properties like viscosity, shear stress and shear rate were affected by temperature as indicated on the experimental result. The viscosity of the <b>oil</b> <b>samples</b> were observed to decrease with increasing temperature, it was also observed that the variation of the viscosity of the <b>oil</b> <b>samples</b> could be attributed to the degree of purity of the <b>oil</b> <b>samples.</b> The degree of purity also depends on the method of preparation of the <b>oil</b> <b>samples.</b> Newtonian behavior occurs at low shear rate when the shear stress and shear rate relationship is linear.

If deepfryer oils are not managed appropriately, undesirable breakdown products accumulate. When 23 used <b>oil</b> <b>samples</b> and paired unused control <b>oil</b> <b>samples</b> from takeaway food outlets in north-eastern Australia were analysed for fatty acid profile and indicators of deterioration, oil identity and condition were found to differ greatly. Trans-fatty acid content was generally low, although one unused <b>oil</b> <b>sample</b> contained 43. 8 % (w/w). Two <b>oil</b> <b>samples</b> had polar compound contents above 25 %, the highest being 28. 7 %. Peroxide values and acid values, both singularly and in combination, correlated poorly with polar compound levels.

30|$|Figure  11 a, b compares gas {{condensate}} and volatile <b>oil</b> <b>samples</b> {{with the same}} permeability (k[*]=[*] 1 md). It is obviously that trend lines in {{gas condensate}} sample are sharper in vertical whereas there are more linear in horizontal direction in volatile oil. Results show that from left-top towards right-bottom corner, methane composition varies about 5.2  mol% in gas condensate sample, whereas this value is about 0.45  mol% in volatile <b>oil</b> <b>sample.</b> Hence, volatile <b>oil</b> <b>sample</b> becomes more uniform in comparison with gas condensate in the same magnitude of permeability. In Fig.  12 a, b, which demonstrates variations of density in both gas condensate and volatile <b>oil</b> <b>samples,</b> {{it is obvious that}} in gas condensate fluid, density has higher gradient from right-top to left-bottom corner, more than 350  kg/m 3 versus 150  kg/m 3 in volatile oil; it means that there is more turbulence in gas <b>sample</b> compared with <b>oil</b> <b>sample</b> causing to have higher gradient of C 1 in gas condensate. On the other hand, more uniformity in density of volatile <b>oil</b> <b>sample</b> has caused to have almost flat trends of C 1 composition. It seems that one logical reason is due to bulk velocity. Figure  13 a, b shows contour plot of bulk velocity for two samples. As it is expected, bulk velocity magnitude is higher in gas condensate with respect to volatile <b>oil</b> <b>sample.</b> Magnitude of bulk velocity varies more than 3 e− 6  m/s from right-top to left-bottom corner in comparison with 3 e− 7  m/s. Consequently, uniformity in flow streams resulted from lower bulk velocity and higher mixture density in <b>oil</b> <b>sample</b> causes to have almost no significant C 1 gradient in volatile <b>oil</b> <b>sample.</b>|$|R

The densities of the crude <b>oil</b> <b>samples</b> range from 0.9394 to 0.9698  gm/cm 3. Crude <b>oil</b> <b>sample</b> C has higher densities than those of sample A and B at all temperatures. The SARA analysis shows that sample C has the lowest saturate and resin contents, and the highest asphaltene content. The SARA analysis, which is related to rheological properties such as viscosity, reveals that the sample with the lowest dynamic viscosity (sample B) has the lowest asphaltene content. The analysis also reveals that the asphaltene content in the three crude <b>oil</b> <b>samples</b> {{is lower than the}} contents of the resins and saturates, and that sample B has the highest resin content.
