In an interview with Tom Fordyce, Chambers stated that Maurice Greene's strong presence and mind games undermined the competition both physically and mentally. [...] "You {{have to get out}} in front of him and hold <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>dear</b> life" [...] he said of the world record holder.|$|E
2500|$|The premiere {{received}} mixed {{response from}} critics, with some finding {{it hard to}} get used to a reboot, while others praised the new directions. Paul Dailly of TV Fanatic wrote a positive review for the episode, giving it a 4.2 out of 5 stars rating and stating, [...] "With a new location and characters, the show is returning to its former glory. My only hope is that if this season {{turns out to be a}} success, they do not drag the stories <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>dear</b> life." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Justin Kirkland gave a A- letter rating along with a favorable commentary. Emmaline Harvey of SpoilerTV eulogized the reboot, saying, [...] "I felt Once was starting to get repetitive the last few seasons, and while this is nearly identical to the plot in the plot, I'm really encouraged by the new characters. I think it's a fun, fresh new start to the series." [...] Nick Hogan of TVOvermind gave the episode a 4 out of 5 stars rating, labeling it as a new pilot and glorifying Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz's ability of [...] "make a quality episode of television." [...] Conversely, Gwen Ihnat of The A.V. Club deemed the new settings and storylines [...] "hard to sell," [...] providing a C letter rating.|$|E
60|$|Betsy Bobbin had tired {{her feet}} by walking, {{so she was}} now riding upon {{the back of the}} stout little mule, facing {{backward}} and talking to Shaggy and Polychrome, who were just behind. Suddenly Hank pitched forward and began falling and Betsy would have tumbled over his head had she not grabbed the mule's shaggy neck with both arms and held <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>dear</b> life.|$|E

60|$|But I {{forgot all}} this, when, nearly at the top, I was thrown {{up the hill}} of the stairs {{as if it had}} {{suddenly}} become downhill. My feet flew from stair to stair to escape falling, and I flew, or fell, apparently upward, until, at the top, I hung <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>dear</b> life while the stern of the Elsinore flung skyward on some mighty surge.|$|E
60|$|For {{the horse}} had {{suddenly}} stopped pivoting and started {{off like a}} streak, not up or down the trail, but across a stretch of prairie grass. On and on he went, the bit between his teeth and gaining speed at every step. In vain Dick yelled at him, kicked him and banged him on the head. It was of no use, {{and he had to}} cling <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>dear</b> life.|$|E

[...] He glanced at the old captain, {{shivering}} in oilskins at the binnacle and holding <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>dear</b> life.

50|$|Donald and Goofy race {{up a tree}} as the two bulls {{prepare to}} fight. After the moose sharpen their antlers, they clash and the earthshaking body slams after that cause Goofy and Donald to fall off the tree they were hanging <b>on</b> to <b>for</b> <b>dear</b> life, landing in between the two bulls. After a futile April fool's joke meant to make the antlered beasts forget about the whole costume incident, Donald and Goofy run for their lives while the angry moose chase them. Mickey soon joins them as they run for their lives, going on a boat and racing away, {{concluding}} the cartoon.|$|R
60|$|It {{might have}} been {{half an hour later}} when another sea swept the deck. Jim took shelter under the stump of the mast and held <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>dear</b> life. Charlie got inside the coil of the derrick-fall and so was saved, while the others dived into the cabin. When that sea had passed they found no one at the tiller. Poor King had been washed overboard. Nothing {{whatever}} could be done for him, even if he had been seen, but the greedy sea had swallowed him, and he was taken to swell with his tuneful voice the company of those who sing on high the praises of redeeming love.|$|E
6000|$|... "All ready, then!" [...] {{cried the}} Ork, {{and at once}} his {{whirling}} tail began to revolve. Trot felt herself rising into the air; when the creature's legs left the ground Cap'n Bill grasped two of them firmly and held <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>dear</b> life. The Ork's body was tipped straight upward, and Trot had to embrace the neck very tightly to keep from sliding off. Even in this position the Ork had trouble in escaping the rough sides of the well. Several times it exclaimed [...] "Wow!" [...] as it bumped its back, or a wing hit against some jagged projection; but the tail kept whirling with remarkable swiftness and the daylight grew brighter and brighter. It was, indeed, a long journey from the bottom to the top, yet almost before Trot realized they had come so far, they popped {{out of the hole}} into the clear air and sunshine and a moment later the Ork alighted gently upon the ground.|$|E
6000|$|They had {{not very}} far to go, but Moti's little pony, {{weighted}} with a heavy man and two big rocks, soon began to lag behind the cavalry, and would have lagged behind the infantry too, only they were not very anxious to be {{too early in the}} fight, and hung back so as to give Moti plenty of time. The young man jogged along more and more slowly for some time, until at last, getting impatient at the slowness of the pony, he gave him such a tremendous thwack with his staff that the pony completely lost his temper and bolted. First one stone became untied and rolled away in a cloud of dust {{to one side of the}} road, whilst Moti nearly rolled off too, but clasped his steed valiantly by its ragged mane, and, dropping his staff, held <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>dear</b> life. Then, fortunately the other rock broke away from his other leg and rolled thunderously down a neighbouring ravine. Meanwhile the advanced cavalry had barely time to draw to one side when Moti came dashing by, yelling bloodthirsty threats to his pony: ...|$|E

60|$|It {{looked very}} much {{as if he had}} gone down in the grass to warn Mrs. Bob. Evidently Jimmy thought so, for he at once headed that way. When Bubbling Bob did the same thing all over again. Peter grew anxious. He knew just how patient Jimmy Skunk could be, and he very much feared that Jimmy would find that nest. Presently he grew tired of {{watching}} and started <b>on</b> <b>for</b> the <b>dear</b> Old Briar-patch. Just before he reached it a brown bird, who reminded him somewhat of Mrs. Redwing and Sally Sly the Cowbird, though she was smaller, ran across the path {{in front of him and}} then flew up to the top of a last year's mullein stalk. It was Mrs. Bobolink. Peter knew her well, for he and she were very good friends.|$|R
6000|$|... "About midnight of the 28th the gale {{was at its}} worst. Darkness {{that could}} be felt between the flashes of lightning. Thunder that was nearly drowned by the roaring of the wind an' the {{crashing}} of everything all round. To save their lives the people had to fling themselves into ditches and hollows of the ground. Mr Ross {{and some of his}} people were lying in the shelter of a wall near his house. There had been a schooner lying not far off. When Mr Ross raised his head cautiously above the wall to have a look to wind'ard he saw the schooner comin' straight for him {{on the top of a}} big wave. `Hold on!' he shouted, fell flat down, and laid hold o' the nearest bush. Next moment the wave burst right over the wall, roared on up to the garden, 150 yards above high-water mark, and swept his house clean away! By good fortune the wall stood the shock, and the schooner stuck fast just before reachin' it, but so near that the end of the jib-boom passed right over the place where the household lay holdin' <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>dear</b> life and half drowned. It was a tremendous night," [...] concluded the captain, [...] "an' nearly everything on the islands was wrecked, but they've survived it, as you'll see. Though it's seven years since that cyclone swep' over them, they're all right and goin' ahead again, full swing, as if nothin' had happened." ...|$|E
6000|$|Another sea {{swept over}} them, and the skiff, which {{had long since}} been swamped, dashed itself to pieces against the stern. Then the Reindeer towered above them on a {{mountain}} of water. Joe caught himself half shrinking back, for it seemed she would fall down squarely on top of them; but the next instant she dropped into the gaping trough, and they were looking down upon her far below. It was a striking picture--one Joe was destined never to forget. The Reindeer was wallowing in the snow-white smother, her rails flush with the sea, the water scudding across her deck in foaming cataracts. The air was filled with flying spray, which made the scene appear hazy and unreal. One of the men was clinging to the perilous after-deck and striving to cast off the water-logged skiff. The boy, leaning far over the cockpit-rail and holding <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>dear</b> life, was passing him a knife. The second man stood at the wheel, putting it up with flying hands and forcing the sloop to pay off. Beside him, his injured arm in a sling, was Red Nelson, his sou'wester gone and his fair hair plastered in wet, wind-blown ringlets about his face. His whole attitude breathed indomitability, courage, strength. It seemed almost as though the divine were blazing forth from him. Joe looked upon him in sudden awe, and, realizing the enormous possibilities of the man, felt sorrow for {{the way in which}} they had been wasted. A thief and a robber! In that flashing moment Joe caught a glimpse of human truth, grasped at the mystery of success and failure. Life threw back its curtains that he might read it and understand. Of such stuff as Red Nelson were heroes made; but they possessed wherein he lacked--the power of choice, the careful poise of mind, the sober control of soul: in short, the very things his father had so often [...] "preached" [...] to him about.|$|E
6000|$|For Bryan I now got a young {{gentleman from}} Oxford, the Rev. Edmund Lavender, who was {{commissioned}} {{to teach him}} Latin, when the boy was in the humour, and to ground him in history, grammar, and the other qualifications of a gentleman. Lavender was a precious addition to our society at Hackton. He was the means of making a deal of fun there. He was the butt of all our jokes, and bore them with the most admirable and martyrlike patience. He was one {{of that sort of}} men who would rather be kicked by a great man than not be noticed by him; and I have often put his wig into the fire {{in the face of the}} company, when he would laugh at the joke as well as any man there. It was a delight to put him on a high-mettled horse, and send him after the hounds,--pale, sweating, calling on us, for Heaven's sake, to stop, and holding <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>dear</b> life by the mane and the crupper. How it happened that the fellow was never killed I know not; but I suppose hanging is the way in which HIS neck will be broke. He never met with any accident, to speak of, in our hunting-matches: but you were pretty sure to find him at dinner in his place at the bottom of the table making the punch, whence he would be carried off fuddled to bed before the night was over. Many a time have Bryan and I painted his face black on those occasions. We put him into a haunted room, and frightened his soul out of his body with ghosts; we let loose cargoes of rats upon his bed; we cried fire, and filled his boots with water; we cut the legs of his preaching-chair, and filled his sermon-book with snuff. Poor Lavender bore it all with patience; and at our parties, or when we came to London, was amply repaid by being allowed to sit with the gentlefolks, and to fancy himself in the society of men of fashion. It was good to hear the contempt with which he talked about our rector. 'He has a son, sir, who is a servitor: and a servitor at a small college,' he would say. 'How COULD you, my dear sir, think of giving the reversion of Hackton to such a low-bred creature?' ...|$|E

He leads Elmer off a cliff edge. Elmer looks at the miraculous view of the Grand Canyon, but then realizes he's in midair. He runs back to safety and holds <b>on</b> to Bugs <b>for</b> <b>dear</b> life. Bugs then admits he's the one pulling these gags and runs off, with a furious Elmer giving chase after retrieving a gun from his tent. However, he runs into a black bear. The bear starts growling, and so Elmer turns to a wildlife handbook for advice, which directs him to play dead.|$|R
60|$|Peter {{said that}} he {{certainly}} should, and then started <b>on</b> <b>for</b> the <b>dear</b> Old Briar-patch to think things over. The discovery that already the nesting season of a new year had begun turned Peter's thoughts towards the coming of sweet Mistress Spring {{and the return of}} his many feathered friends who had left for the far-away South so long before. A great longing to hear the voices of Welcome Robin and Winsome Bluebird and Little Friend the Song Sparrow swept over him, and a still greater longing for a bit of friendly gossip with Jenny Wren. In the past year he had learned much about his feathered neighbors, but there were still many things he wanted to know, things which only Jenny Wren could tell him. He was only just beginning to find out that no one knows all there is to know, especially about the birds. And no one ever will.|$|R
