There is thus common ground for the two opposing schools of moralists to join issue. The question between them is, Do such laws exist <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>they</b> not? In reasoning thus Cumberland obviously forgot what the position maintained by his principal antagonist really was.|$|E
25|$|Some natural {{questions}} are: {{under what}} circumstances does this formalism work, and for what operators L are expansions in series of other operators like this possible? Can any function f be {{expressed in terms of}} the eigenfunctions (are they a Schauder basis) and {{under what circumstances}} does a point spectrum or a continuous spectrum arise? How do the formalisms for infinite-dimensional spaces and finite-dimensional spaces differ, <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>they</b> differ? Can these ideas be extended to a broader class of spaces? Answering such questions is the realm of spectral theory and requires considerable background in functional analysis and matrix algebra.|$|E

2500|$|Dewey sees paradox in {{contemporary}} logical theory. Proximate subject matter garners general agreement and advancement, while the ultimate {{subject matter of}} logic generates unremitting controversy.

2500|$|Analyzing and {{quantifying}} {{the observation}} that the simplex algorithm is efficient in practice, {{even though it has}} exponential worst-case complexity, has {{led to the development of}} other measures of complexity. The simplex algorithm has polynomial-time average-case complexity under various probability distributions, with the precise average-case performance of the simplex algorithm depending on the choice of a probability distribution for the random matrices. Another approach to studying [...] "typical phenoma" [...] uses Baire category theory from general topology, and to show that (topologically) [...] "most" [...] matrices can be solved by the simplex algorithm in a polynomial number of steps. Another method to analyze the performance of the simplex algorithm studies the behavior of worst-case scenarios under small perturbation – are worst-case scenarios stable under a small change (in the sense of structural stability), <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>they</b> become tractable? Formally, this method uses random problems to which is added a Gaussian random vector ("smoothed complexity").|$|E
2500|$|When {{looked at}} philosophically, qualia become {{a tipping point}} between {{physical}}ity and the metaphysical, which polarizes the discussion, as we've seen above, into [...] "Do they <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>they</b> not exist?" [...] and [...] "Are they physical or beyond the physical?" [...] However, from a strictly neurological perspective, they can both exist, and be {{very important to the}} organism's survival, and be the result of strict neuronal oscillation, and still not rule out the metaphysical. A good example of this pro/con blending is in Rodolfo Llinás's I of the Vortex (MIT Press, 2002, pp.202–207). Llinás argues that qualia are ancient and necessary for an organism's survival and a product of neuronal oscillation. Llinás gives the evidence of anesthesia of the brain and subsequent stimulation of limbs to demonstrate that qualia can be [...] "turned off" [...] with changing only the variable of neuronal oscillation (local brain electrical activity), while all other connections remain intact, arguing strongly for an oscillatory—electrical origin of qualia, or important aspects of them.|$|E

2500|$|When the McKenzie {{arrived on}} campus in 1915, he was {{informed}} that the Fisk Herald was so deeply in debt {{that it could not}} proceed. McKenzie outlined his plan for the merger in the Fisk News and declared the News would assume the existing debt of the Herald if two hundred undergraduates subscribed to the News at an annual cost of 50 cents. The combined publication would feature a regular [...] "Student Department" [...] under editorial [...] management of the old Herald board. McKenzie also asked alumni if they wished the publication sent to them [...] "entirely without charge, <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>they</b> prefer to subscribe to it?" [...] In a strategy to raise funds, if not sympathy over the cost of publishing and mailing the News, McKenzie suggested if the [...] "Alumni would like to create a Living Endowment Fund by subscribing two dollars or more per year to such a fund," [...] they would receive the Herald [...] "free of extra charge." [...] Unable to raise money endowment from students or alumni, he decided to suspend the Herald, and merge it with Fisk's alumni publication, the Fisk University News. Du Bois and some contemporary scholars cite McKenzie's decision as an example of his desire to suppress student criticism.|$|E
