5|$|Although Nepenthes rajah is {{most famous}} for {{trapping}} and digesting animals, its pitchers are also host {{to a large}} number of other organisms, which are thought to form a mutually beneficial (symbiotic) association with the plant. Many <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>animals</b> are so specialised that they cannot survive anywhere else, and are referred to as nepenthebionts. N. rajah has two such mosquito taxa named after it: Culex rajah and Toxorhynchites rajah.|$|E
5|$|Another major {{infusion}} of Arabian horses into Europe {{occurred when the}} Ottoman Turks sent 300,000 horsemen into Hungary in 1522, {{many of whom were}} mounted on pure-blooded Arabians, captured during raids into Arabia. By 1529, the Ottomans reached Vienna, where they were stopped by the Polish and Hungarian armies, who captured these horses from the defeated Ottoman cavalry. Some <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>animals</b> provided foundation bloodstock for the major studs of eastern Europe.|$|E
50|$|There {{have been}} studies {{on a variety}} <b>of</b> <b>animals.</b> <b>These</b> <b>animals</b> include rats, mice, Macaca mulatta and rabbits.|$|R
5000|$|While {{some authors}} make use <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>animal</b> {{stereotypes}} [...] "as is", others undermine reader expectations by reversing them, developing the animal character in contrasting ways to foil expectations or create amusement, like a [...] pig or cowardly lion.|$|R
5000|$|The sticks {{were once}} plain, but {{recently}} Meiji has placed pictures of various animals on them with quotes relating to that animal. The quotes are in English, but often appear unorthodox to native English speakers. Examples <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>animal</b> quotes include: ...|$|R
5|$|As an apex predator, Daspletosaurus {{was at the}} top of {{the food}} chain, {{probably}} preying on large dinosaurs like the ceratopsid Centrosaurus and the hadrosaur Hypacrosaurus. In some areas, Daspletosaurus coexisted with another tyrannosaurid, Gorgosaurus, though there is some evidence of niche differentiation between the two. While Daspletosaurus fossils are rarer than other tyrannosaurids', the available specimens allow some analysis of the biology <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>animals,</b> including social behavior, diet and life history.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1920s, {{there was an}} {{outbreak}} of a previously unrecognized cattle disease in the northern United States and Canada. Cattle were haemorrhaging after minor procedures and on some occasions, spontaneously. For example, 21 out of 22 cows died after dehorning and 12 out of 25 bulls died after castration. All <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>animals</b> had bled to death.|$|E
5|$|The first Devonian {{tetrapod}} identified from Asia {{was recognized}} from a fossil jawbone reported in 2002. The Chinese tetrapod Sinostega pani was discovered among fossilized tropical plants and lobe-finned {{fish in the}} red sandstone sediments of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region of northwest China. This finding substantially extended the geographical range <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>animals</b> and has raised new questions about the worldwide distribution and great taxonomic diversity they achieved within a relatively short time.|$|E
50|$|Zoonotic diseases, {{ones that}} are found in animals and {{transmitted}} to people, are a concern, specifically, for those that question animal agriculture. It was found that intensification of livestock production is related {{to an increase in}} disease transmission from animals like pigs and poultry due to a high density <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>animal</b> populations with low genetic diversity.|$|R
5000|$|To {{assess the}} {{environmental}} impact C-Power has enlisted {{the assistance of the}} Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO [...] ) and the Institute for Agricultural and Fisheries Research (ILVO [...] ) to obtain the most detailed possible information on the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>animal</b> species at Thornton Bank and to assess the possible effect of a wind farm on them.|$|R

5|$|Amino acids {{are used}} {{for a variety of}} {{applications}} in industry, but their main use is as additives to animal feed. This is necessary, since many of the bulk components of these feeds, such as soybeans, either have low levels or lack some of the essential amino acids: lysine, methionine, threonine, and tryptophan are most important in the production of these feeds. In this industry, amino acids are also used to chelate metal cations in order to improve the absorption of minerals from supplements, which may be required to improve the health or production <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>animals.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, after the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 and {{the ban on}} hunting Killer Whales in Washington in 1976 as {{discussed}} later in this article, the hunting of Killer Whales in Iceland resumed, this time aiming to capture live animals for the entertainment industry. The first two Killer Whales captured went to Dolfinarium Harderwijk in the Netherlands. One <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>animals</b> was soon after transferred to SeaWorld. These captures continued until 1989, with the additional animals going to SeaWorld, Marineland Antibes, Marineland Canada, Kamogawa Sea World, Ocean Park Hong Kong and Conny-Land.|$|E
5|$|It {{appears that}} {{predation}} by invasive mammalian species including ship rats, cats, and mustelids was an additional {{factor in the}} decline in huia numbers – introduction <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>animals</b> by New Zealand acclimatisation societies peaked in the 1880s and coincided with a particularly sharp decline in huia populations. Because it {{spent a lot of}} time on the ground, the huia would have been particularly vulnerable to mammalian predators. Another hypothetical cause of extinction is exotic parasites and disease introduced from Asia with the common myna.|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, the {{conservation}} of local breeds and of their genetic resources has gained more and more importance (Notter, 1999). In fact, the safeguard of animal genetic variability is determinant to maintain ecosystem equilibriums {{but it is also}} essential to guarantee future economic potentials <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>animal</b> resources. Moreover, biodiversity has a great cultural value and it can be also used for scientific purposes (FAO, 1992) ...|$|R
5|$|No skull {{has ever}} been found that can be {{confidently}} said to belong to Diplodocus, though skulls of other diplodocids closely related to Diplodocus (such as Galeamopus) are well known. The skulls of diplodocids were very small compared with the size <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>animals.</b> Diplodocus had small, 'peg'-like teeth that pointed forward and were only present in the anterior sections of the jaws. Its braincase was small. The neck was composed of at least 15 vertebrae {{and may have been}} held parallel to the ground and unable to be elevated much past horizontal.|$|E
5|$|Of vertebrates, {{numerous}} {{species of}} frog, salamander, snake, turtle, and alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) proliferate in marsh waters. Most <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>animals</b> are active at night. Frog choruses are overwhelming; during alligator mating season the grunts of bulls join in. The marshes around the St. Johns River upper basin teem with birds. A recent study counted 60,000 birds in one month, nesting or feeding {{in the upper}} basin. Wading and water birds like the white ibis (Eudocimus albus), wood stork (Mycteria americana), and purple gallinule (Porphyrio martinicus) depend on the water for raising their young: they prey upon small fish and tadpoles in shallow water and puddles in the dry season. In successful seasons, their colonies can number in the thousands, creating a cacophony of calls and fertilizing trees with their droppings.|$|E
5|$|Other {{members of}} the clade may include Eoraptor from the same Ischigualasto Formation of Argentina as Herrerasaurus, Chindesaurus from the Upper Petrified Forest (Chinle Formation) of Arizona, and {{possibly}} Caseosaurus from the Tecovas Formation of the Dockum Group in Texas, although the relationships <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>animals</b> are not fully understood, and not all paleontologists agree. Other possible basal theropods, Alwalkeria from the Late Triassic Maleri Formation of India, and Teyuwasu, known from very fragmentary remains from the Late Triassic of Brazil, might be related. Paul (1988) noted {{that it had been}} incorrectly suggested that Staurikosaurus pricei was a juvenile Herrerasaurus. This claim was refuted when pelvic bones from a juvenile Herrerasaurus were discovered, which upon examination did not resemble the pelvic bones of Staurikosaurus.|$|E
50|$|Prior to the {{discovery}} of SARS-CoV, MHV had been the best-studied coronavirus both in vivo and in vitro {{as well as at the}} molecular level. Some strains of MHV cause a progressive demyelinating encephalitis in mice which has been used as a murine model for multiple sclerosis. Significant research efforts have been focused on elucidating the viral pathogenesis <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>animal</b> coronaviruses, especially by virologists interested in veterinary and zoonotic diseases.|$|R
40|$|Rodent pests cause heavy {{damage to}} the crops of Utah. The four most {{destructive}} <b>of</b> <b>these</b> pests are ground squirrels, pocket gophers, rabbits, and field mice. The most effective method for the destruction <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>animal</b> pests {{is the use of}} poisoned baits. A very important factor in their control is the natural enemies. The formulae recommended in the following pages have been, and are now being, used with excellent success in this and neighboring states...|$|R
50|$|Although the {{protocol}} summary reports no animal deaths during the studies, the ANSM expert committee {{reported that in}} fact several monkeys died or had to be euthanised during the dose escalation studies and that an explanation from Bial was pending. Also, two animals had to be euthanised in the 13-week dog study due to lung lesions - both from the top dose group. None <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>animal</b> deaths were described in the trial protocol.|$|R
5|$|Several {{species of}} Malagasy {{hippopotamus}} (also known as Malagasy dwarf hippopotamus or Malagasy pygmy hippopotamus or Madagascan instead of Malagasy) {{lived on the}} island of Madagascar but are now believed to be extinct. The animals were very similar to the extant hippopotamus and pygmy hippopotamus. The fossil record suggests that at least one species of hippopotamus lived until about 1,000 years ago, and other evidence suggests that the species may have survived until much more recently. The taxonomy <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>animals</b> is not resolved and not widely studied. The various species are believed to have survived into the Holocene era.|$|E
5|$|Some temples kept sacred animals, {{which were}} {{believed}} to be manifestations of the temple god's ba {{in the same way that}} cult images were. Each of these sacred animals was kept in the temple and worshipped for a certain length of time, ranging from a year to the lifetime of the animal. At the end of that time, it was replaced with a new animal of the same species, which was selected by a divine oracle or based on specific markings that were supposed to indicate its sacred nature. Among the most prominent <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>animals</b> were the Apis bull, worshipped at Memphis as a manifestation of the Memphite god Ptah, and the falcon at Edfu who represented the falcon god Horus.|$|E
5|$|This strong odour can be {{detected}} {{half a mile away}} by animals, thus luring them. In addition, the fruit is extremely appetising to a variety of animals, including squirrels, mouse deer, pigs, orangutan, elephants, and even carnivorous tigers. While some <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>animals</b> eat the fruit and dispose of the seed under the parent plant, others swallow the seed with the fruit and then transport it some distance before excreting, with the seed being dispersed as a result. The thorny, armoured covering of the fruit discourages smaller animals; larger animals are more likely to transport the seeds far from the parent tree.|$|E
40|$|In this episode, Chris Gaiser ({{professor}} {{of biology}} at Linfield College) and Mike Crosser (professor of physics at Linfield College) invite Chad Tillberg (associate professor {{of biology at}} Linfield College) into the studio to discuss eusocial animals: bees, ants, termites, and, of course, naked mole-rats. Each <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>animal</b> groups lives in a nest and has distinct classes of individuals, from workers to queens.

25|$|The Cretaceous–Paleogene {{boundary}} {{marks the}} Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event which saw the extinction <b>of</b> many <b>of</b> <b>these</b> prehistoric <b>animals</b> which remain only as fossil remnants.|$|R
50|$|The {{normal length}} of a colony <b>of</b> <b>these</b> leaf-shaped <b>animals</b> could reach a length of 3.5 cm. They were passively mobile planktonic {{suspension}} feeders.|$|R
5|$|Dinosaurs diverged {{from their}} archosaur {{ancestors}} {{during the middle}} to late Triassic period, roughly 20million years after the Permian–Triassic extinction event wiped out an estimated 95% of all life on Earth. Radiometric dating of the rock formation that contained fossils from the early dinosaur genus Eoraptor at 231.4 million years old establishes its presence in the fossil record at this time. Paleontologists think that Eoraptor resembles the common ancestor of all dinosaurs; if this is true, its traits suggest that the first dinosaurs were small, bipedal predators. The discovery of primitive, dinosaur-like ornithodirans such as Marasuchus and Lagerpeton in Argentinian Middle Triassic strata supports this view; analysis of recovered fossils suggests that these animals were indeed small, bipedal predators. Dinosaurs may have appeared as early as 243 million years ago, as evidenced by remains of the genus Nyasasaurus from that period, though known fossils <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>animals</b> are too fragmentary to tell if they are dinosaurs or very close dinosaurian relatives.|$|E
5|$|Many {{plants and}} animals have been {{introduced}} to Newfoundland, either by chance or deliberately. Moose, snowshoe hare, American red squirrel, eastern chipmunk, and masked shrew, and others, {{were brought to the}} island through specific wildlife mandates. Moose were introduced in 1904 and are now the dominant ungulate on the island. An unusual experiment conducted in 1964 involved relocating a small herd of bison onto Brunette Island in Fortune Bay. The last <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>animals</b> is thought to have died by 1994. Rats and mice were unintentionally introduced while mink escaped from fur farms. Coyotes are a very recent addition to the fauna of Newfoundland. How coyotes got onto the island is still debated by wildlife officials, but it is probable that they crossed the ice from Cape Breton Island in the 1980s. Newfoundland has no native amphibians, but frogs were introduced onto the island in the 1860s and toads almost a century later.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{recognizable}} of all dinosaurs, Stegosaurus has been depicted on film, in cartoons and comics, as children's toys, and was even declared the State Dinosaur of Colorado in 1982. Due to the fragmentary nature of most early Stegosaurus fossil finds, it took many years before reasonably accurate restorations <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>animals</b> could be produced. The earliest popular image of Stegosaurus was an engraving produced by A. Tobin for the November 1884 issue of Scientific American, which included the dinosaur amid a speculative Morrison age landscape. Tobin restored the Stegosaurus as bipedal and long-necked, with the plates arranged along the tail and the back covered in spikes. This covering of spikes might {{have been based on}} a misinterpretation of the teeth, which Marsh had noted were oddly shaped, cylindrical, and found scattered, such that he thought they {{might turn out to be}} small dermal spines.|$|E
50|$|Monobrachium is a genus <b>of</b> hydroids (Hydrozoa). <b>These</b> <b>animals</b> are marine cnidarians in {{the family}} Monobrachiidae.|$|R
50|$|Wild boar {{roam the}} {{mountain}} sides, {{but have been}} coming down to the city centers in search <b>of</b> food. <b>These</b> <b>animals</b> are big, strong, and fast and can potentially be fatal to humans.|$|R
40|$|Pathophysiological {{mechanisms}} {{involved in}} dry eye {{are complex and}} multifactorial. Dry eye models could be generated as lacrimal insufficiency (Sjögren’s syndrome like), evaporative dry eye syndrome (DES) or evaporative DES with lacrimal insufficiency. In order to perform a stem cell research study in rats with DES, researchers should firstly know which DES model is appropriate for their studies. In this study, we have reviewed different pathogenic mechanisms and clinical relevance <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>animal</b> models for DES...|$|R
