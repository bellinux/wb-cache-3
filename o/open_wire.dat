This does not imply an industry preference, although planar transmission line formats (that is, formats where conductors consist of flat strips) are popular because they can be implemented using established printed circuit board manufacturing techniques. The structures shown can also be implemented using microstrip or buried stripline techniques (with suitable adjustments to dimensions) and can be adapted to coaxial cables, twin leads and waveguides, although some structures are more suitable for some implementations than others. The <b>open</b> <b>wire</b> implementations, for instance, of a number of structures are shown in the second column of figure 3 and <b>open</b> <b>wire</b> equivalents can be found for most other stripline structures. Planar transmission lines are also used in integrated circuit designs.|$|E

25|$|<b>Open</b> <b>wire</b> {{test leads}} (flying leads) {{are likely to}} pick up interference, so they are not {{suitable}} for low level signals. Furthermore, the leads have a high inductance, so they are not suitable for high frequencies. Using a shielded cable (i.e.,coaxial cable) is better for low level signals. Coaxial cable also has lower inductance, but it has higher capacitance: a typical 50ohm cable has about 90pF per meter. Consequently, a one-meter direct (1X) coaxial probe will load a circuit with a capacitance of about 110pF and a resistance of 1megohm.|$|E
2500|$|If {{the signal}} source {{has its own}} coaxial connector, then a simple coaxial cable is used; otherwise, a {{specialized}} cable called a [...] "scope probe", supplied with the oscilloscope, is used. In general, for routine use, an <b>open</b> <b>wire</b> test lead for connecting to the point being observed is not satisfactory, and a probe is generally necessary.|$|E

50|$|A pole route (or {{pole line}} in the US) is a {{telephone}} link or electrical power line between two or more locations by way of multiple uninsulated wires suspended between wooden utility poles. This method of link is common especially in rural areas where burying the cables would be expensive. Another situation in which pole routes were extensively used were on the railways to link signal boxes. Traditionally, prior to around 1965, pole routes were built with <b>open</b> <b>wires</b> along non-electrical operated railways; this necessitated insulation when the wire passed over the pole, thus preventing the signal from becoming attenuated.|$|R

50|$|The cost of conduit {{installation}} {{is higher}} than other wiring methods due {{to the cost of}} materials and labor. In applications such as residential construction, the high degree of physical damage protection may not be required, so the expense of conduit is not warranted. Conductors installed within conduit cannot dissipate heat as readily as those installed in <b>open</b> <b>wiring,</b> so the current capacity of each conductor must be reduced (derated) if many are installed in one conduit. It is impractical, and prohibited by wiring regulations, to have more than 360 degrees of total bends in a run of conduit, so special outlet fittings must be provided to allow conductors to be installed without damage in such runs.|$|R

5000|$|The twelve channel scheme, {{in order}} to {{maintain}} some bandwidth and routing compatibility, was carried through to the short haul carriers, as well, as they started developing to eliminate voice band <b>open</b> <b>wire</b> trunk lines in the 1950s. The Bell System vacuum-tube driven N-1 Carrier of the early 1950s was the most used twelve channel carrier system, using double sideband/unsuppressed carrier operation which didn't need network timebase synchronization to maintain frequency accuracy. N-2 was similar in heterodyning scheme, but in discrete transistorized [...] "plug-in unit" [...] architecture, while N3 used the same frequency plan but a scheme of using single sideband with a different voice channel {{on each side of the}} carrier, a technique first seen on the 16 channel Type [...] "O" [...] <b>open</b> <b>wire</b> short haul carrier of the 1950s. This doubled the capacity to 24 channels, the same as a basic digital Type T PCM carrier introduced in the late 1950s, which became the now-ubiquitous [...] "T-1" [...] of the digital world.|$|E
50|$|The first {{application}} for balanced lines was for telephone lines. Interference that was of little consequence on a telegraph system (which is in essence digital) {{could be very}} disturbing for a telephone user. The initial format was to take two single-wire unbalanced telegraph lines and use them as a pair. This proved insufficient, however, {{with the growth of}} electric power transmission which tended to use the same routes. A telephone line running alongside a power line for many miles will inevitably have more interference induced in one leg than the other since one of them will be nearer to the power line. This issue was addressed by swapping the positions of the two legs every few hundred yards with a cross-over, thus ensuring that both legs had equal interference induced and allowing common-mode rejection to do its work. As the telephone system grew, it became preferable to use cable rather than <b>open</b> <b>wires</b> to save space, and also to avoid poor performance during bad weather. The cable construction used for balanced telephone cables was twisted pair; however, this did not become widespread until repeater amplifiers became available. For an unamplified telephone line, a twisted pair cable could only manage a maximum distance of 30 km. <b>Open</b> <b>wires,</b> on the other hand, with their lower capacitance, had been used for enormous distances—the longest was the 1500 km from New York to Chicago built in 1893. Loading coils were used to improve the distance achievable with cable but the problem was not finally overcome until amplifiers started to be installed in 1912. Twisted pair balanced lines are still widely used for local loops, the lines that connect each subscriber's premises to their respective exchange.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} transformerless multilevel converters as {{an application}} for high-power hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) motor drives. Multilevel converters: 1) can gen-erate near-sinusoidal voltages with only fundamental frequency switching; 2) have almost no electromagnetic interference or common-mode voltage; and 3) make an HEV more acces-sible/safer and <b>open</b> <b>wiring</b> possible for most of an HEV’s power system. The cascade inverter is a natural fit for large automotive hybrid electric drives because it uses several levels of dc voltage sources, which would be available from batteries, ultracapacitors, or fuel cells. Simulation and experimental results show how to operate this converter {{in order to maintain}} equal charge/discharge rates from the dc sources (batteries, capacitors, or fuel cells) in an HEV.
