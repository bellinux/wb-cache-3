At the leading strand, loading of the PCNA is an infrequent process, because DNA replication on the leading strand is continuous until replication is terminated.

25|$|Flap {{endonuclease}} 1 (FEN1) {{is responsible}} for processing Okazaki fragments. It works with DNA polymerase to remove the RNA primer of an <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragment</b> and can remove the 5' ribonucleotide and 5' flaps when DNA polymerase displaces the strands during lagging strand synthesis. The removal of these flaps involves a process called nick translation and creates a nick for ligation. Thus, FEN1's function is necessary to <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragment</b> maturation in forming a long continuous DNA strand. Likewise, during DNA base repair, the damaged nucleotide is displaced into a flap and subsequently removed by FEN1.|$|E

In untreated cells, <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragments</b> and 10 -kilobase (kb) DNA intermediates are formed. In aphidicolin-treated cells, the replication fork is stopped {{and there is no}} formation of DNA replication intermediates. However, 10 -kb DNA intermediates formed before the drug blockade are ligated to high molecular weight DNA whereas already formed <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragments</b> accumulate in the cell. Moreover, in cells released from aphidicolin inhibition there is preferential labeling of 10 -kb DNA compared to <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragments.</b> The 10 -kb DNA and the <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragments,</b> therefore, respond differently to aphidicolin...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe correct {{processing}} of <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragments</b> during lagging-strand DNA replication has {{a vital role}} in maintaining genome integrity. Recent findings suggest that, in eukaryotes, the {{processing of}} <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragments</b> occurs by a two-step mechanism governed by the single-stranded DNA binding factor RPA...|$|R
25|$|Each <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragment</b> is {{preceded by}} an RNA primer, which is {{displaced}} by the procession of the next <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragment</b> during synthesis. RNase H recognizes the DNA:RNA hybrids that are created {{by the use of}} RNA primers and is responsible for removing these from the replicated strand, leaving behind a primer:template junction. DNA polymerase α, recognizes these sites and elongates the breaks left by primer removal. In eukaryotic cells, a small amount of the DNA segment immediately upstream of the RNA primer is also displaced, creating a flap structure. This flap is then cleaved by endonucleases. At the replication fork, the gap in DNA after removal of the flap is sealed by DNA ligase I, which repairs the nicks that are left between the 3'-OH and 5'phosphate of the newly synthesized strand. Owing to the relatively short nature of the eukaryotic <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragment,</b> DNA replication synthesis occurring discontinuously on the lagging strand is less efficient and more time consuming than leading-strand synthesis. DNA synthesis is complete once all RNA primers are removed and nicks are repaired.|$|E
25|$|In the {{presence}} of a single stranded DNA-binding protein RPA, the DNA 5' flaps become too long, and the nicks no longer fit as substrate for FEN1. This prevents the FEN1 from removing the 5′-flaps. Thus, Dna2's role is to reduce the 3′ end of these fragments, making it possible for FEN1 to cut the flaps, and the <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragment</b> maturation more efficient.|$|E
25|$|Although {{synthesis}} of the lagging strand involves only half the DNA in the nucleus, the complexity associated with processing Okazaki fragments is about twice that required to synthesize the leading strand. Even in small species such as yeast, <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragment</b> maturation happens approximately a million times during a single round of DNA replication. Processing of Okazaki fragments is therefore very common and crucial for DNA replication and cell proliferation.|$|E
25|$|Further {{research}} implicates the supplementary role of {{proliferating cell}} nuclear antigen (PCNA) to DNA ligase I's function of joining <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragments.</b> When the PCNA binding site on DNA ligase I is inactive, DNA ligase I's {{ability to connect}} <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragments</b> is severely impaired. Thus, a proposed mechanism follows: after a PCNA-DNA polymerase δ complex synthesizes <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragments,</b> the DNA polymerase δ is released. Then, DNA ligase I binds to the PCNA, which is clamped to the nicks of the lagging strand, and catalyzes the formation of phosphodiester bonds.|$|R

25|$|Because DNA {{polymerase}}s {{require a}} primer {{on which to}} begin DNA synthesis, polymerase α (Pol α) acts as a replicative primase. Pol α is associated with an RNA primase and this complex accomplishes the priming task by synthesizing a primer that contains a short 10 nucleotide stretch of RNA followed by 10 to 20 DNA bases. Importantly, this priming action occurs at replication initiation at origins to begin leading-strand synthesis and also at the 5' end of each <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragment</b> on the lagging strand.|$|E
25|$|Initiation of {{eukaryotic}} DNA replication is {{the first}} stage of DNA synthesis where the DNA double helix is unwound and an initial priming event by DNA polymerase α occurs on the leading strand. The priming event on the lagging strand establishes a replication fork. Priming of the DNA helix consists of synthesis of an RNA primer to allow DNA synthesis by DNA polymerase α. Priming occurs once at the origin on the leading strand and at the start of each <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragment</b> on the lagging strand.|$|E
25|$|Okazaki {{fragments}} are short, newly synthesized DNA fragments {{that are}} formed on the lagging template strand during DNA replication. They are complementary to the lagging template strand, together forming short double-stranded DNA sections. Okazaki fragments are between 1000 and 2000 nucleotides long in prokaryotes (e.g. Escherichia coli) and are roughly 100 to 200 nucleotides long in eukaryotes. They {{are separated by}} ~120-nucleotide RNA primers and are unligated until RNA primers are removed, followed by enzyme ligase connecting (ligating) an <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragment</b> onto the (now continuous) newly synthesized complementary strand.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. This {{paper is}} a {{continuation}} of [1] which provides formulae for the probability distributions of the number of <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragments</b> at time t during the process of DNA replication. Given the expressions for the moments of the probability distribution of the number of <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragments</b> at time t in the recursive form, we evaluated formulae for the third and fourth moments, using Mathematica, and obtained results in explicit form. Having done this, we calculated the distribution’s skewness and kurtosis. <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragments</b> are small fragments of DNA remaining after the process of DNA replication. Denote the number of <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragments</b> at the time t ≥ 0 by N t �Ω�.

DNA Pol α elongates the newly formed primer with DNA nucleotides. After around 20 nucleotides, elongation is taken over by Pol ε on the leading strand and Pol δ on the lagging strand.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragment</b> synthesis, DNA {{polymerase}} δ {{runs into}} the previous <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragment</b> and displaces its 5' end containing the RNA primer and a small segment of DNA. This generates an RNA-DNA single strand flap, which must be cleaved, and the nick between the two Okazaki fragments must be sealed by DNA ligase I. This process is known as <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragment</b> maturation and can be handled in two ways: one mechanism processes short flaps, while the other deals with long flaps. DNA polymerase δ is able to displace up to 2 to 3 nucleotides of DNA or RNA ahead of its polymerization, generating a short [...] "flap" [...] substrate for Fen1, which can remove nucleotides from the flap, one nucleotide at a time.|$|E
2500|$|During this process, RNA and DNA primers are removed, {{allowing}} the Okazaki fragments to {{attach to the}} lagging DNA strand.

Severe defects of <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragment</b> maturation may halt DNA replication and induce cell death. However, while subtle defects do not affect growth, they do result in future varying forms of genome instabilities. Based on the dangers associated with a failure in the DNA process, Okazaki fragments maintain our evolutionary development.|$|E

2500|$|Although cells undergo {{multiple}} {{steps in}} order to ensure there are no mutations in the genetic sequence, sometimes specific deletions and other genetic changes during <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragment</b> maturation go unnoticed. Because Okazaki fragments are the set of nucleotides for the lagging strand, any alteration including deletions, insertions, or duplications from the original strand can cause a mutation if it is not detected and fixed. Other causes of mutations include problems with the proteins that aid in DNA replication. [...] For example, a mutation related to primase affects RNA primer removal and can make the DNA strand more fragile and susceptible to breaks. Another mutation concerns polymerase α, which impairs the editing of the <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragment</b> sequence and incorporation of the protein into the genetic material. Both alterations can lead to chromosomal aberrations, unintentional genetic rearrangement, and a variety of cancers later in life.|$|E

In the event of deregulated Fen1/DNA polymerase δ activity, the cell uses an alternative mechanism to generate and process long flaps by using Dna2, which has both helicase and nuclease activities. The nuclease activity of Dna2 is required for removing these long flaps, leaving a shorter flap to be processed by Fen1. Electron microscopy studies indicate that nucleosome loading on the lagging strand occurs very close to the site of synthesis. Thus, <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragment</b> maturation is an efficient process that occurs immediately after the nascent DNA is synthesized.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{types of}} strands are created {{simultaneously}} during replication: the leading strand, which is synthesized continuously and grows towards the replication fork, and the lagging strand, {{which is made}} discontinuously in <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragments</b> and grows away from the replication fork.

2500|$|To {{test the}} effects of the protein {{mutations}} on living organisms, researchers genetically altered lab mice to be homozygous for another mutation in protein related to DNA replication, flap endonuclease 1, or FEN1. The results varied based on the specific gene alterations. Homozygous knockout mutant mice experienced a [...] "failure of cell proliferation" [...] and [...] "early embryonic lethality" [...] (27). Mice with mutation F343A and F344A (also known as FFAA) died directly after birth due to complications including pancytopenia and pulmonary hypoplasia. This is because the FFAA mutation keeps FEN1 from interacting with PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen), consequently not allowing it to complete its purpose during <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragment</b> maturation. Under careful observation, cells homozygous for FFAA FEN1 mutations seem to display only partial defects in maturation, meaning mice heterozygous for the mutation would be able to survive into adulthood, despite sustaining multiple small nicks in their genomes. Inevitably however, these nicks prevent future DNA replication because the break causes the replication fork to collapse and causes double strand breaks in the actual DNA sequence. In time, these nicks also cause full chromosome breaks, which could lead to severe mutations and cancers. Other mutations have been implemented with altered versions of Polymerase α, leading to similar results.|$|E

5000|$|DNA {{molecules}} in eukaryotes {{differ from the}} circular molecules of prokaryotes {{in that they are}} larger and usually have multiple origins of replication. This means that each eukaryotic chromosome is composed of many replicating units of DNA with multiple origins of replication. In comparison, the prokaryotic E. coli chromosome has only a single origin of replication. In eukaryotes, these replicating forks, which are numerous all along the DNA, form [...] "bubbles" [...] in the DNA during replication. The replication fork forms at a specific point called autonomously replicating sequences (ARS). Eukaryotes have a clamp loader complex and a six-unit clamp called the proliferating cell nuclear antigen. The efficient movement of the replication fork also relies critically on the rapid placement of sliding clamps at newly primed sites on the lagging DNA strand by ATP-dependent clamp loader complexes. This means that the piecewise generation of <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragments</b> can keep up with the continuous synthesis of DNA on the leading strand. These clamp loader complexes are characteristic of all eukaryotes and separate some of the minor differences in the synthesis of <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragments</b> in prokaryotes and eukaryotes.The lengths of <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragments</b> in prokaryotes and eukaryotes are different as well.
