5|$|Indium(III) oxide and indium {{tin oxide}} (ITO) are used as a {{transparent}} conductive coating <b>on</b> <b>glass</b> substrates in electroluminescent panels. Indium tin oxide {{is used as a}} light filter in low-pressure sodium-vapor lamps. The infrared radiation is reflected back into the lamp, which increases the temperature within the tube and improves the performance of the lamp.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} other {{techniques}} developed in parallel {{with the use of}} daguerreotypes. The ambrotype, using collodium to produce a positive image <b>on</b> <b>glass,</b> and the pannotype, also collodium-based, were both used in Denmark from around 1855. Negative-based paper prints, used {{from the beginning of the}} 1850s, were produced on salt paper until around 1857 when salt was replaced by albumen. Collodion emulsion chloride paper was used from 1865 and in 1880 gelatin emulsion paper was introduced.|$|E

5|$|Indium {{is a minor}} {{component}} in zinc sulfide ores and is produced as a byproduct of zinc refinement. It is most notably used in the semiconductor industry, in low-melting-point metal alloys such as solders, in soft-metal high-vacuum seals, and {{in the production of}} transparent conductive coatings of indium tin oxide (ITO) <b>on</b> <b>glass.</b> Indium has no biological role, though its compounds are somewhat toxic when injected into the bloodstream. Most occupational exposure is through ingestion, from which indium compounds are not absorbed well, and inhalation, from which they are moderately absorbed.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Surface {{treatment}} before {{glass bonding}} {{is an important}} and critical issue for glass-based lab-on-chip fabrication. In the present article we verified five different activation methods for obtaining sound thermal assisted direct bonding (TADB) <b>on</b> <b>glasses.</b> Glass surface has been investigated by means of water contact angle, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The optimum surface activation method for TADB <b>on</b> <b>glasses</b> {{was found to be}} H 2 SO 4 :H 2 O 2 (3 : 1 by volume) followed by HNO 3. By using the TADB optimized activation method, the glass bonding strength higher than 32 MPa was obtained with a glass the roughness of 50 nm...|$|R

5|$|Next {{studies of}} the {{chemistry}} of dubnium were reported over a decade later, in 1988. Studies at Berkeley examined whether the most stable oxidation state of dubnium in aqueous solution was +5. Dubnium was fumed twice and washed with concentrated nitric acid; then, its sorption of dubnium <b>on</b> <b>glass</b> cover slips was {{compared with that of}} tracers of the group 5 elements niobium and tantalum and the group 4 elements zirconium and hafnium produced on‐line under similar conditions. The group 5 elements are known to sorb <b>on</b> <b>glass</b> surfaces while the group 4 elements do not. Dubnium was confirmed as a group 5 member. However, it was surprising that behavior on extraction from mixed nitric acid/hydrofluoric acid solution into methyl isobutyl ketones differed between dubnium, tantalum, and niobium. Dubnium did not extract and its behavior resembled niobium more closely than tantalum, indicating that details of complexing behavior could not be predicted based only on simple extrapolations of trends within a group in the periodic table.|$|E
5|$|Tange further {{developed}} his ideas for expandable urban forms in 1966 when he designed the Yamanashi Broadcasting and Press Centre in Kōfu.

The newspaper printing machinery {{was on the ground}} floor, sealed studios on the upper floors and offices <b>on</b> <b>glass</b> walled floors surrounded by balconies. The services, including stairs and lifts, are housed in 16reinforced concrete columns that are of five-metre (17ft) diameter. Space was left between the cluster of functional space to allow for future expansion, although these have been used for gardens and terraces.|$|E

40|$|Growth of conical {{particles}} in carbon films deposited <b>on</b> silica <b>glass</b> fibers prepared by thermal {{chemical vapor deposition}} is investigated. The {{results show that the}} size and number of conical particles <b>on</b> the silica <b>glass</b> fiber increase with the film thickness and deposition temperature, but this effect is reduced when the carbon films are deposited <b>on</b> silica <b>glass</b> plates. The growth of conical particles <b>on</b> the silica <b>glass</b> fiber is mainly due to the small cross-sectional area of the fibers. These conical particles are against the hermetic property of carbon-coated optical fibers. We propose a method to minimize conical {{particles in}} carbon films <b>on</b> silica <b>glass</b> fibers.
