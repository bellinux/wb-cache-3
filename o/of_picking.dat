40|$|PICK 1 is a {{peripheral}} membrane protein conserved from Caenorhabditis elegans to the human. It {{is expressed in}} many tissues with high levels in brain and testis. Inside cells, PICK 1 is localized at the perinuclear region as well as specialized structures such as synapses <b>of</b> neurons. <b>PICK</b> 1 contains a PDZ domain and a BAR domain. The PDZ domain <b>of</b> <b>PICK</b> 1 binds to {{a large number of}} membrane proteins, especially proteins with C-terminal type II PDZ-binding motifs. The BAR domain <b>of</b> <b>PICK</b> 1 binds to lipid molecules, mainly phosphoinositides. While the PDZ domain and the linker region <b>of</b> <b>PICK</b> 1 enhance BAR domain's lipid binding, the C-terminal region <b>of</b> <b>PICK</b> 1 inhibits its lipid binding. PICK 1 regulates the subcellular localization and surface expression of its PDZ-binding partners. Lipid binding <b>of</b> <b>PICK</b> 1 's BAR domain is important for this regulation. With its PDZ domain interacting with membrane proteins and its BAR domain binding to lipids, the unique structure <b>of</b> <b>PICK</b> 1 enables it to couple membrane proteins to protein-trafficking machinery.

5|$|Leeman Bennett, {{the former}} {{head coach of the}} Atlanta Falcons and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, served as {{chairman}} of the selection committee, which had the task <b>of</b> <b>picking</b> the best teams from those made available by the selection criteria set by the two conferences. The committee would have approximately onemonth to select the twoteams that would attract the most people to the game and generate the largest possible television audience. This fact helped eliminate ACC runner-up Georgia Tech from the selection process, as the Yellow Jackets had already played Georgia earlier in the season, thus making a potential Georgia-Georgia Tech showdown less attractive. In addition, that matchup, while attractive to football fans in the Atlanta area (the site of the Chick-fil-A Bowl and home to Georgia Tech), would have less appeal to television viewers outside the Georgia area. Supervising the selection committee was the Chick-fil-A Bowl Executive Committee, which consisted of representatives from various Atlanta businesses and the Chick-fil-A corporation.|$|E
5|$|The coffee {{farmers of}} Maraba first needed a washing station to remove sugar from the coating {{of the coffee}} bean, under the skin.

5|$|On September 26, 1964, Nguyễn Khánh and {{the senior}} {{officers}} in his military junta created a semblance of civilian rule by forming the High National Council (HNC), an appointed advisory body akin to a legislature. This came after lobbying by American officials—led by Ambassador Maxwell Taylor—in Vietnam, as they placed great value in the appearance of civilian legitimacy, which they saw as vital to building a popular base for any government. Khánh put his rival General Dương Văn Minh—who he had deposed in a January 1964 coup—in charge <b>of</b> <b>picking</b> the 17 members of the HNC, and Minh filled it with figures sympathetic to him. The HNC then made a resolution to recommend a political model with a powerful head of state, which would likely be Minh, given their sympathy towards him. Khánh did not want his rival taking power, so he and the Americans convinced the HNC to dilute {{the powers of the}} position to make it unappealing to Minh, who was then sent on an overseas diplomatic goodwill tour to remove him from the political scene. However, Minh was back in South Vietnam after a few months and the power balance in the junta was still fragile.|$|E
5|$|The Jain texts further {{illustrate}} {{the effects of}} leśyās on the mental dispositions of a soul, using {{an example of the}} reactions of six travellers on seeing a fruit-bearing tree. They see a tree laden with fruit and begin to think of getting those fruits: one of them suggests uprooting the entire tree and eating the fruit; the second one suggests cutting the trunk of the tree; the third one suggests simply cutting the branches; the fourth one suggests cutting the twigs and sparing the branches and the tree; the fifth one suggests plucking only the fruits; the sixth one suggests picking up only the fruits that have fallen down. The thoughts, words and bodily activities of each of these six travellers are different based on their mental dispositions and are respectively illustrative of the six leśyās. At one extreme, the person with the black leśyā, having evil disposition, thinks of uprooting the whole tree even though he wants to eat only one fruit. At the other extreme, the person with the white leśyā, having a pure disposition, thinks <b>of</b> <b>picking</b> up the fallen fruit, in order to spare the tree.|$|E
5|$|Through {{the first}} three innings of the fifth game, both {{pitchers}} held the opposing team to no runs and {{a limited number of}} hits. In the bottom of the fourth inning, the Cardinals cracked through Pennock's tough pitching. Jim Bottomley began by hitting a one-out double past left fielder Babe Ruth. Les Bell followed with a single to right field, scoring Bottomley. Chick Hafey then hit a fly ball caught in foul territory by Ruth, and Bell was called out while attempting to steal second base. In the top of the sixth inning, Pennock hit a line drive double into left field past Hafey. Cardinals' catcher Bob O'Farrell threw to Tommy Thevenow in hopes <b>of</b> <b>picking</b> off Pennock, who was standing a considerable distance away from second base. Thevenow made an error with his tag on Pennock, and Pennock was safe at second base. Earle Combs, the Yankees leadoff hitter, followed by drawing a walk. With runners at first and second base, Koenig hit a single to left fielder Hafey. Pennock scored on the play, and Combs moved to second base. Ruth then struck out, and Bob Meusel followed by hitting a sacrifice fly to right fielder Billy Southworth, on which Combs promptly advanced to third base. Lou Gehrig drew a walk to load the bases for Tony Lazzeri, who ended the inning by hitting a fly ball to center fielder Wattie Holm.|$|E

5|$|While 18thcentury metal mines {{had worked}} on the {{principle}} of adult men digging the ore and women and children picking and cobbing the ore ready for smelting, in the new large-scale mines of the early 19thcentury working practices changed. The strenuous underground work was still carried out by male workers, as was breaking large rocks with heavy hammers ('ragging'). In copper mines, very young girls, and sick and injured older women, carried out the simple work <b>of</b> <b>picking.</b> Girls in their late teens forced the broken ore through a broad mesh to sort the ore ('riddling'), and used hammers to break the large chunks of ore left by the riddling process into smaller chunks. Girls in their mid-teens cobbed the resulting chunks, separating the valuable ore from waste rock. Grown women would carry out the heavy manual labour of breaking rocks with hammers ('spalling'), of crushing sorted ore to small grains ready for smelting ('bucking') and of transporting ore between various pieces of apparatus. An experienced bal maiden working as a spaller would produce approximately one ton (2240lb; 1016kg) of broken ore per day, {{depending on the type of}} stone. In the tin mines, in which ore could be crushed far more finely than copper before smelting, cobbing and bucking did not take place. Instead, the chunks of spalled ore were mechanically stamped to fine grains, and washed into a series of collecting pits to separate the coarse 'rough' from the fine 'slimes'. The resulting rough and slimes were separated out on large wooden frames ('buddling' and 'framing' respectively), to extract the tin ore from the surrounding dust and grit.|$|E

40|$|SummaryPICK 1 is a calcium-sensing, PDZ domain-containing {{protein that}} interacts with GluR 2 and GluR 3 AMPA {{receptor}} (AMPAR) subunits and regulates their trafficking. Although PICK 1 has been principally implicated in long-term depression (LTD), PICK 1 overexpression in CA 1 pyramidal neurons causes a CaMK- and PKC-dependent potentiation of AMPAR-mediated transmission {{and an increase}} in synaptic GluR 2 -lacking AMPARs, mechanisms associated with NMDA receptor (NMDAR) -dependent long-term potentiation (LTP). Here, we directly tested whether PICK 1 participates in both hippocampal NMDAR-dependent LTP and LTD. We show that the <b>PICK</b> 1 potentiation <b>of</b> AMPAR-mediated transmission is NMDAR dependent and fully occludes LTP. Conversely, blockade <b>of</b> <b>PICK</b> 1 PDZ interactions or lack <b>of</b> <b>PICK</b> 1 prevents LTP. These observations demonstrate an important role for PICK 1 in LTP. In addition, deletion <b>of</b> <b>PICK</b> 1 or blockade <b>of</b> <b>PICK</b> 1 PDZ binding prevented NMDAR-dependent LTD. Thus, PICK 1 plays a critical role in bidirectional NMDAR-dependent long-term synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus...|$|R
40|$|Trafficking of AMPA receptors to {{and from}} synapses and their final localizations are {{critical}} {{for the expression of}} synaptic plasticity, which is regarded as the cellular basis of learning and memory. Protein that interacts with C Kinase 1 (PICK 1), is one of the scaffolding proteins that interacts with AMPA receptors and regulates their trafficking in synaptic plasticity. In this study, we found that PICK 1 could be a threonine-phosphorylated protein and identified threonine 82 (T 82) in the PDZ domain <b>of</b> <b>PICK</b> 1 as a potential phosphorylation site based on sequence and structural modeling analysis. We further performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments to confirm that T 82 was indeed critical for the interaction between PICK 1 and GluR 2. In addition, T 82 E mutation mimicking the phosphorylation <b>of</b> <b>PICK</b> 1 dispersed the colocalization <b>of</b> <b>PICK</b> 1 and GluR 2 in heterologous cells. Finally, the phosphorylated analog, T 82 E, inhibited PICK 1 's effect in regulating surface distribution of GluR 2 and current mediated by GluR 2. In summary, our data suggest that T 82 is a potential phosphorylation site <b>of</b> <b>PICK</b> 1 and is critical for the interaction <b>of</b> <b>PICK</b> 1 with AMPA receptors and PICK 1 -regulated AMPA receptor localization.
