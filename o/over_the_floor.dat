5|$|Gautier thought Heine's Wilis and Hugo's fifteen-year-old Spanish {{girl would}} make a good ballet story. His first idea was to present an empty ballroom {{glittering}} with crystal and candlelight. The Wilis would cast a spell <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> Giselle and other dancers would enter and whirl through the room, unable to resist the spell to keep them dancing. Giselle would try to keep her lover from partnering other girls. The Queen of the Wilis would enter, lay her cold hand on Giselle's heart and the girl would drop dead.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the quality}} of his {{maritime}} illustrations, Coggins was invited by publisher Doubleday to provide artwork for a children's book about the U.S. Navy; the author being Fletcher Pratt, the well known military historian. Coggins was invited to participate in Pratt's Naval Game, based on a wargame developed by Fred T. Jane involving dozens of tiny wooden ships, built {{on a scale of one}} inch to fifty feet. These were spread <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> of Pratt's apartment and their maneuvers were calculated via a complex mathematical formula. The result of Pratt and Coggins's first collaboration, published in 1941, was Fighting Ships of the U.S. Navy, a volume that described in text and illustrated in full color every class of ship in the Navy.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} {{numerous}} theatrical triumphs, Mahler's Vienna years were rarely smooth; his battles with singers {{and the house}} administration continued {{on and off for}} the whole of his tenure. While Mahler's methods improved standards, his histrionic and dictatorial conducting style was resented by orchestra members and singers alike. In December 1903 Mahler faced a revolt by stagehands, whose demands for better conditions he rejected in the belief that extremists were manipulating his staff. The anti-Semitic elements in Viennese society, long opposed to Mahler's appointment, continued to attack him relentlessly, and in 1907 instituted a press campaign designed to drive him out. By that time he was at odds with the opera house's administration over the amount of time he was spending on his own music, and was preparing to leave. In May 1907 he began discussions with Heinrich Conried, director of the New York Metropolitan Opera, and on 21 June signed a contract, on very favourable terms, for four seasons' conducting in New York. At {{the end of the summer}} he submitted his resignation to the Hofoper, and on 15 October 1907 conducted Fidelio, his 645th and final performance there. During his ten years in Vienna, Mahler had brought new life to the opera house and cleared its debts, but had won few friends—it was said that he treated his musicians in the way a lion tamer treated his animals. His departing message to the company, which he pinned to a notice board, was later torn down and scattered <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> After conducting the Hofoper orchestra in a farewell concert performance of his Second Symphony on 24 November, Mahler left Vienna for New York in early December.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the murder}} of 18-year-old Juanita Mott in April 1975, Fred concreted <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> of the entire cellar. He would later convert {{this section of the}} {{household}} into a bedroom for his oldest children, and he and his wife are not known to have committed any further murders until May 1978, when Fred—either with or without Rose's participation but certainly with her knowledge—murdered an 18-year-old lodger named Shirley Robinson. Robinson had taken lodgings with the Wests in April 1977, and was heavily pregnant with a baby son {{at the time of her}} murder. Although Rose—herself pregnant at the time—is known to have initially boasted to neighbours the child Robinson was carrying was her husband's, she soon developed a deep resentment of Robinson, and the motive for her murder is likely to have been the removal of a threat to the stability of the Wests' relationship. Her body was buried in the garden of 25 Cromwell Street, and although extensively dismembered, no restraining devices were found with Robinson's remains, thus making a sexual motive for this murder unlikely. Shortly thereafter, Rose unsuccessfully submitted a claim for maternity benefit in Shirley's name with Gloucester social services. As had earlier been the case with Charmaine and Lynda, Fred and Rose allayed the suspicions of anyone who enquired as to Robinson's whereabouts by claiming she had relocated to live with her father in West Germany.|$|E

He is a clumsy character too, mistaking the table-cloth for a napkin and dropping the entire contents of the table all <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> when he stands up, and breaking a mirror {{in the middle of}} the night after mistaking his own reflection for a burglar. Victor starts to warm to Alfred towards the end of his visit, but Alfred leaves early the next day after finding an unpleasant message about him that Victor had accidentally recorded on a dictaphone.

Ronnie enters, with glowing green eyes, and prepares to attack Mulder, but Mulder manages to postpone his demise by scattering sunflower seeds all <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> which Ronnie compulsively starts to pick up. Scully enters and shoots Ronnie, but the bullets have no effect, and Ronnie runs out with Scully in pursuit. Mulder recovers from being drugged and chases after Ronnie.|$|E

500|$|Immediately {{after the}} badnjak {{has been brought}} in, or {{immediately}} before in some places, an armful of straw is spread <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> The straw is usually brought in with the same greetings and throwing of grain as the badnjak. The person spreading it may imitate a hen clucking to call her chicks, [...] "Kvo, kvo, kvo", with the family's children imitating chicks, [...] "Piju, piju, piju", while they pick at the straw. In Čečava, northern Bosnia, the children then {{lie down on the}} straw, before closing their eyes and picking a stalk with their lips: the child that picked the longest stalk will supposedly be the luckiest in the following year. In the Bay of Kotor, the ceremony is accompanied by the words [...] "Kuda slama, tuda slava"—"Whither straw, thither celebration." [...] A common custom is to scatter a handful of walnuts over the straw. It will be collected and taken out of the house {{on the morning of the}} second day after Christmas. Some of the straw may be set aside and used in apotropaic practices in the coming year.|$|E
500|$|Fire {{from the}} {{domestic}} hearth was {{under no circumstances}} given {{out of the house}} on Christmas Eve, not even to a neighbor whose fire had gone out. The reason for this prohibition, according to Čajkanović, was the belief that the Eve is a time when the ancestral spirits, guardians of the family's happiness and prosperity, are especially active in this world. Christmas Eve dinner is a feast prepared in their honor, and they join the family at it. They gather on the straw spread <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> and on the hearth. These spirits could be removed from the family if any piece of their fire were taken away by an outsider. In people's words, fire should not be given lest the luck be taken away from the house, or for better crops, or because of bees. Referring to the latter explanation, Čajkanović argues that, in the old religion of the Serbs, the bees were regarded as pure and sacred insects, in whom ancestral spirits could dwell. The same explanation, [...] "because of bees", is also given for the aforementioned custom of putting a piece of the badnjak's first splinter in the dough for the česnica.|$|E
500|$|The house {{stands on}} an island {{surrounded}} by a 33-foot (10 m) wide moat, which was probably dug in the 13th or 14th century to enclose an earlier building on the site. There {{is no evidence that}} the moat served any defensive purpose, and as with many other moated sites it was probably intended as a status symbol. A sandstone bridge leads to a gatehouse in the three-storey south range, which has each of its two upper floors jettied out <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> beneath. As is typical of Cheshire's timber-framed buildings the overhanging jetties are hidden by coving, which has a recurring quatrefoil decoration. The Gatehouse leads to a rectangular courtyard, with the Great Hall at the northern end. The two-storey tower to the left of the Gatehouse contains garderobes, which empty directly into the moat. [...] Architectural historian Lydia Greeves has described the interior of Little Moreton Hall as a [...] "corridor-less warren, with one room leading into another, and four staircases linking different levels". Some of the grander rooms have fine chimneypieces and wood panelling, but others are [...] "little more than cupboards". The original purpose of some of the rooms in the house is unknown.|$|E
