5|$|Green-flowered helleborine {{is found}} {{on the western side}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gorge,</b> in a wooded area next to the towpath below Leigh Woods. lady orchid was {{discovered}} here in 1990, in Nightingale Valley {{on the west side of}} the Gorge; there is some doubt as to whether this was a wild plant or an introduction. fly orchid and bee orchid are found in the gorge, along with their hybrid. A single plant of lesser meadow-rue is present in the gorge. Bristol rock-cress occurs here, and at nearby Penpole Point; in the gorge, there are about 3,000 plants on the Bristol side, and about 2,000 below Leigh Woods. Hutchinsia is found on both sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gorge.</b> Bloody crane's-bill grows on the Bristol side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gorge,</b> where it is believed to be native.

5|$|The Hermitage is a {{small stone}} shelter built into the side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gorge,</b> above the river. It was {{designed}} by James Hamilton in the 1770s as a place for ladies to shelter while the men fished in the river.|$|E
5|$|The steep walls <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gorge</b> support some rare fauna and flora, {{including}} species {{unique to}} the gorge. There are a total of 24 rare plant species and two unique trees: the Bristol and Wilmotts's whitebeams. Other notable plants include Bristol rock cress, Bristol onion, spiked speedwell, autumn squill and honewort. Because of its steep sides, there are many parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gorge</b> on which trees cannot grow, making way for smaller plants. The gorge {{is also home to}} rare invertebrate species. The gorge has a microclimate around 1 degree warmer than the surrounding land. The steep south-west facing sides receive the afternoon sunlight, but are partially sheltered from the prevailing winds. When winds come from the Bristol Channel in the north west they may be funnelled into the gorge, creating harsh and wet conditions.|$|E
5|$|Two {{railways}} {{still run}} through the gorge. On the east side the Severn Beach Line to Avonmouth and Severn Beach uses the remaining part of the Bristol Port Railway through part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gorge,</b> and through a tunnel under the Downs. On the west side the Portishead Railway was closed by the Beeching Axe in the 1960s, but has now been reopened for freight traffic as far as Royal Portbury Dock, 2.5miles (4km) downstream. Between 1893 and 1934, the Clifton Rocks Railway linked the passenger steamer pier at Hotwells with Clifton on the rim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gorge.</b>|$|E

50|$|In 1890 wood {{stocks were}} laid on <b>the</b> harbour <b>of</b> Fiskieiði, {{so that it}} would be easier to drag the boats to and from the sea. These stocks were there until 1973, when they were taken away, because they were in bad shape. The stocks from one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gorges</b> were replaced, but the ones from <b>the</b> other <b>gorge</b> were not replaced.|$|R
5|$|In 1909 {{part of the}} {{woodland}} was {{donated to}} the National Trust by the tobacco company owner George Alfred Wills. He did this to prevent housing development {{on the western side}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gorge</b> as Bristol grew in size and population. In 1974 the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food bought the woodland associated with the Leigh Court estate. Areas not owned by the National Trust have since been taken over by the Forestry Commission.|$|E
5|$|The gorge {{area was}} {{inhabited}} {{at least as}} early as the Iron Age, probably by the Dobunni tribe. In Leigh Woods above Nightingale Valley, a steep dry valley beside the suspension bridge, is Stokeleigh Camp, one of three Iron Age hill forts in the area. Stokeleigh was occupied from 3BCE to 1CE, and was also used in the Middle Ages. The camp was protected on two sides by the cliff faces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gorge</b> and Nightingale Valley, and was also protected by earthworks, and is now a scheduled ancient monument. A second hill fort was situated across Nightingale Valley, but has since been built on, and bridge road cuts through it. The third hill fort was situated on the opposite side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gorge,</b> in what is now observatory green. Archaeology, plus the configuration of the three forts, suggest they played a role in defending the gorge.|$|E
5|$|The {{two main}} caves {{open to the}} public are on the southside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gorge,</b> owned by Longleat Estate. The {{extensive}} Gough's Cave and the smaller Cox's Cave are both named after their respective discoverers. Both are known for their geology, and {{it has been suggested that}} the caves were used for maturing cheese in prehistoric times.|$|E
5|$|The Jadovno camp site {{remained}} unexplored {{after the}} war due to <b>the</b> depth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gorges</b> where bodies were disposed <b>of</b> and <b>the</b> {{fact that some of}} these had been filled with concrete by Yugoslavia's Communist authorities.

5|$|Fishers, {{medium-sized}} weasels, were reintroduced to Pine Creek Gorge {{as part of}} {{an effort}} to establish a healthy population of fishers in Pennsylvania. Prior to the lumber era, fishers were numerous throughout the forests of Pennsylvania. They are generalized predators and will hunt any smaller creatures in their territory, including porcupines. Elk have been reintroduced west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gorge</b> in Clinton County and occasionally wander near the west rim of the canyon. Coyotes have come back on their own. Invasive insect species in the gorge include gypsy moth larvae, which eat all the leaves off trees, especially oaks, and hemlock woolly adelgids, which weaken and kill hemlocks. Invasive plant species include purple loosestrife and Japanese knotweed.|$|E
5|$|Hemlock trees form {{a canopy}} over Big Wapwallopen Creek in some places. The Wapwallopen Gorge {{is listed as}} a Locally Significant site on the Luzerne County Natural Areas Inventory. Hemlock and yellow birch are common at the gorge's upper end. However, river birch and {{sycamore}} are more common {{at the lower end}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gorge.</b> There are riparian forests along Big Wapwallopen Creek in the American Legion Post 781 land tract. The tract of land also contains some wet areas such as vernal pools and marshes. These areas provide breeding grounds for reptiles, amphibians, fish, and aquatic invertebrates.|$|E
5|$|In 1883, Cornell {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{university}} campuses to use electricity to light the grounds from a water-powered dynamo. In 1904, a hydroelectric plant was built in the Fall Creek gorge. The plant takes water from Beebe Lake through a tunnel in the side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gorge</b> to power up to 1.9 megawatts of electricity. The plant continued to serve the campus's electric needs until 1970, when local utility rates placed a heavy economic penalty on independently generating electricity. The abandoned plant was vandalized in 1972, but renovated and placed back into service in 1981.|$|E

25|$|Subsequent marine transgressions were {{responsible}} for secondary sedimentation in the basins. There was widening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gorges</b> and erosion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cliffs from runoff, leading to <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Molasses in the Royans and also in <b>the</b> valleys <b>of</b> Lans, Autrans, and Rencurel. At <b>the</b> close <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Miocene, a new period of uplifting brought about <b>the</b> final receding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sea.|$|R
25|$|The recent {{geological}} {{history of}} Victoria Falls {{can be seen}} in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gorges</b> below <b>the</b> falls. The basalt plateau over which the Upper Zambezi flows has many large cracks filled with weaker sandstone. In <b>the</b> area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> current falls the largest cracks run roughly east to west (some run nearly north-east to south-west), with smaller north-south cracks connecting them.|$|R
5|$|In the 18th {{century the}} gorge was quarried to produce {{building}} stone for the city. Stone {{was taken by}} boat into the floating harbour. In the 19th century celestine was discovered in Leigh Court estate and the Miles family authorised quarrying. Between 1880 and 1920 Bristol was producing 90% of the world's Celestine, but the enterprise {{did not last long}} into the 20th century. Bristol Diamonds, brilliant quartz crystals found in geodes in dolomitic conglomerate in the gorge, were popular souvenirs for visitors to the Hotwells spa in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Quarries on the Bristol side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gorge</b> are now popular with climbers and are a habitat for Peregrine falcons and other wildlife.|$|E
5|$|Longleat Estate has fenced off a {{large part}} of its land and has {{introduced}} goats, as part of a programme to encourage the biodiversity of the area; the goats were intended to replace the sheep that grazed in the gorge until the 1970s. The National Trust announced in March 2007 that it plans to release a flock of sheep on its side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gorge</b> for the same purpose, but will first consult local residents and interested parties on whether to fence off the gorge or introduce cattle grids to prevent the sheep from straying. There is already a small flock of feral Soay sheep in the gorge.|$|E
5|$|State Route 133, locally called Laguna Canyon Road, {{winds through}} Laguna Canyon {{for the entire}} length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gorge.</b> California State Route 73 bisects the gorge east-west. The lower section of the canyon {{is part of the}} Laguna Coast Wilderness, while the upper section also has a few smaller {{wilderness}} preserves. The upper section contains the Laguna Lakes, a series of small natural lakes formed by groundwater rising along a local fault line, which are the namesake of the canyon. A section of the lower canyon within the city limits of Laguna Beach is heavily developed. The northernmost extreme of the canyon lies near a residential area that adjoins Interstate 405.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe Three Gorges Reservoir {{project is}} a famous project {{in the world for}} the {{profound}} and long-term effect.
