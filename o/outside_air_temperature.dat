40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to find time lag (TL), {{decrement}} factor (DF) and total equivalent temperature difference (TETD) values for multilayer walls and flat roofs of buildings using experimental and theoretical methods, and to compare the experimental results with theoretical ones. The TETD is a method for calculating cooling load due to heat gain from the walls or flat roofs, and it can be obtained using values of inside and <b>outside</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperatures,</b> solar radiation, TL and DF. The TL and DF depend on the highest and the lowest temperatures at the inner and outer surfaces of the walls or flat roofs, and the time periods involved in reaching these temperatures. Hence, two testing rooms each consisting of four multilayered walls and a flat roof, air conditioner, measuring elements are built to measure all required temperatures. The required temperatures, which are hourly inside and <b>outside</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperatures,</b> and surface temperatures of each structure layer, are measured in every minute during testing periods of the 2007 summer season of Gaziantep, Turkey. Hourly solar radiation values on the walls are computed using hourly measured solar radiation on a horizontal surface. The TL, DF and TETD values of eight different walls and two different flat roofs commonly used in Turkey are computed utilizing the measured temperature and solar radiation values.

40|$|In {{developing}} countries like India, where electrical energy is not universally available, “free running ” buildings are common (Nicol & Pagliano, 2007). Such buildings are not heated or cooled electrically, {{meaning that the}} indoor <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> changes in response to ambient <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> changes (Givoni, 1994 b). In hot climates, passive techniques {{can be used to}} control this response. These include radiant and evaporative cooling, comfort and nocturnal ventilation, and the use of insulation and high thermal mass construction materials. Where such measures are not employed, and there is no reliable electricity source to provide ‘active’ cooling, indoor <b>air</b> <b>temperatures</b> can exceed the limits of thermal comfort for inhabitants.

40|$|A {{prototype}} of a monovalent air-to-water {{absorption heat pump}} is developed with a heating capacity rating of 25 kW for residential heating systems. The ambient air supplies the external enrgy, and the driving energy comes from a two-stage adjustable oil burner. As the <b>temperature</b> of the <b>outside</b> <b>air</b> rises, residential heating requirements drop, but the output heat of the heat pump remains constant. Therefore heat pumps have to turn on and off in fixed- cycles. The intermittent losses caused by the fixed-cycle operation of conventional absorption heat pumps have been avoided by a new, patented operating method. This makes this absorption heat pump particularly suitable for use in residential heating systems. Based on this system we developed a procedure that makes a controllable cycle possible for a sorption heat pump, which is suited to actual heating requirements without fixed-cycles. The significant improvement {{is the possibility of}} year-round operation in heat pump modem whereby ambient heat can be fed to the evaporator even when the <b>outside</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperatures</b> are below - 3 C and the sorption heat pump can operate at his optimal COP.

The results show that both ventilation rate and uniformity of indoor climate were influenced by the roof shape.

At low wind speeds the ventilation rate depends on both wind direction and <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> differences; while at high wind speeds the most important factor seems to be the wind direction. For all the cases the ventilation rate at the cow level is different than the ventilation rate calculated for the overall house.
