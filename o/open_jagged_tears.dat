50|$|Severe crush injuries, {{multilevel}} injuries, avulsion injuries, and in {{some cases}} <b>jagged</b> <b>tearing</b> of tissue, can preclude replantation and salvage, requiring revision amputation of the stump.|$|R
60|$|This was different. This {{had nothing}} to do with {{moonlight}} and soft music. It was raw and hard. It hurt. It was a thing sharp and <b>jagged,</b> <b>tearing</b> at the roots of his soul.|$|R
60|$|The {{thing was}} still {{seated in the}} chair, {{straining}} over the table with bowed head, and humped back, and long fantastic arms. Had {{it not been for}} the red <b>jagged</b> <b>tear</b> in the neck, and the clotted black pool that was slowly widening on the table, one would have said that the man was simply asleep.|$|R
500|$|Early Concepts for the Gravemind {{were done}} by Bungie artist Robert McLees. McLees is known at Bungie as the [...] "architect of the Flood", and {{had done the}} early {{concepts}} for the Flood forms in Halo: Combat Evolved. McLees' original drawings were then added to by Juan Ramirez. The Gravemind's form and design constantly changed during development. Early versions of the creature had a basic shape of a mass of tentacles, with a <b>jagged</b> <b>tear</b> in one large appendage forming a rudimentary mouth. Later on, the mouth was studded with the skulls of human and Covenant corpses for teeth. This design was later revised due to practical considerations about lip syncing the character for speech. Despite these design changes, the Gravemind's size was always meant to be huge; early concepts showed the Master Chief dwarfed by the Flood intelligence.|$|R
60|$|Shefford was {{the first}} to ride up out of the draw, and once upon the top of the ridge he halted to gaze, wide-eyed and entranced. A rolling, endless plain sloped down beneath him, and led him on to a distant round-topped mountain. To the right a red cañon <b>opened</b> its <b>jagged</b> jaws, and away to the north rose a whorled and strange sea of curved ridges, crags, and domes.|$|R
2500|$|A hole, 24 feet by 27 feet, {{had been}} torn in the port side of the midships pump-room. The {{explosion}} had also blown another hole in the starboard side, flooding the compartment. There were <b>jagged</b> <b>tears</b> in the bulkheads and kerosene was spurting up from adjoining tanks, seeping in a film up through {{the holes in the}} hull. The deck had been broken open, so that one could look down into the ship. From beam to beam the deck was buckled, but the ship held together. Another sixty Junkers 87 Stuka dive bombers attacked the convoy, focusing on Ohio. A series of near misses ensued as the tanker approached the island of Pantelleria. Bombs threw spray over the decks of the tanker, while aircraft used their machine guns. One near-miss buckled the ship's plates and the forward tank filled with water. The 3-inch (76mm) gun at the bows was twisted in its mountings and put out of action. A formation of five Junkers 88s was broken up by the tanker's anti aircraft guns, with the bombs falling harmlessly into the sea. Another plane, this time a Junkers 87, was shot down by an Ohio gunner; however, the aircraft crashed into Ohios starboard side, forward of the upper bridge, and exploded. Half a wing hit the upper work of the bridge and a rain of debris showered the tanker from stem to stern. The plane's bomb fortunately failed to detonate. Captain Mason was telephoned from aft by the chief officer, who told Mason that the Junkers 87 had crashed into the sea and then bounced onto the ship. Mason 'rather curtly' replied: [...] "Oh that's nothing. We've had a Junkers 88 on the foredeck for nearly half an hour." ...|$|R
5000|$|Astragalus casei is a wiry, {{branching}} perennial herb {{forming an}} <b>open</b> clump of <b>jagged</b> stems up to 40 centimeters long. Leaves {{are up to}} 10 centimeters long and made up of thin, narrow, lance-shaped leaflets. The plant bears an inflorescence of up to 25 pink, lilac, or white flowers. Each flower is between 1 and 2 centimeters long.|$|R
50|$|It is so near a {{perpendicular}} that {{it would}} have appeared to fall--but it is indeed so fearfully savage, & black, & <b>jagged,</b> that it <b>tears</b> the flood to pieces--and one great black Outjutment divides the water, & overbrows & keeps uncovered a long slip of jagged black Rock beneath, which gives a marked character to the whole force. What a sight it is to look down on such a Cataract!--the wheels, that circumvolve in it--the leaping up & plunging forward of that infinity of Pearls & Glass Bulbs--the continual change of the Matter, the perpetual Sameness of the Form-it is an awful Image & Shadow of God & the World.|$|R
6000|$|The {{guns were}} run into their {{position}} on the broadside. [...] "Don't hurry over it," [...] Nat said; [...] "let each fire as his gun comes to bear." [...] There was a crash and a cry as he spoke; a ball {{had gone through the}} Arrow from side to side, <b>tearing</b> <b>jagged</b> holes through her bulwarks, one of the sailors being struck to the deck by a splinter. No one spoke, every eye being fixed on the guns. These were fired almost together. There was a pause for a second or two, and then a burst of cheering as the gaff of the great mainsail of the brigantine was seen to collapse.|$|R
50|$|On 10 May 1842, {{at the age}} of five years, Fashion met Boston in a well-publicized match race at the Union Course on Long Island, New York, with 70,000 people {{witnessing}} the event. In the first heat, the nine-year-old Boston (carrying 126 pounds) cut <b>open</b> a long, <b>jagged</b> gash on his hip against a rail. He and five-year-old Fashion (carrying 124 pounds) were upset by the crowd often surging onto the track. Boston led for three miles, but Fashion won by 35 lengths setting a new world record of 7:32½ for a four-mile race.|$|R
50|$|The {{accepted}} {{wisdom is}} that Boston lost on his merit only once. In May 1842, he met the filly Fashion, the daughter of Trustee and Bonnets o' Blue, in a well-touted match race at the Union Course on Long Island, New York. Seventy thousand people witnessed the event. In the first heat, the nine-year-old Boston (carrying 126 pounds) cut <b>open</b> a long, <b>jagged</b> gash on his hip against a rail, and both he and five-year-old Fashion (carrying 111 pounds) were upset by the crowd often surging onto the track. Boston led for three miles, but Fashion won by 60 yards, setting a new world record of 7:32½ for a four-mile heat.|$|R
