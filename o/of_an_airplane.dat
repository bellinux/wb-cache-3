5|$|Max Fenig (Scott Bellis), a Mutual UFO Network member, {{has been}} {{repeatedly}} abducted by aliens throughout his life. After meeting with FBI agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny), Fenig was abducted once again, and {{thought to have}} been lost entirely. Several years later, Fenig is found dead amongst the victims <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>airplane</b> crash. Investigating the disaster, Mulder and his partner Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) learn that the airplane crashed after being intercepted by a military jet—and possibly by an alien spacecraft. Mulder's search for evidence of such a craft leads to him diving to the bottom of Great Sacandaga Lake to find it; while Scully is ambushed by an assassin seeking to kill a military witness, leading to her colleague Pendrell (Brendan Beiser) being shot.|$|E
5|$|Petersen {{has claimed}} in an {{interview}} that one of the film's scenes forced the crew to adopt a guerrilla filmmaking approach. The scene in which Petersen's character Will Graham falls asleep while studying crime scene photographs during a flight required the use <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>airplane</b> during shooting. Michael Mann had been unable to gain permission to use a plane for the scene and booked tickets for the crew on a flight from Chicago to Florida. Once on board, the crew used their equipment, checked in as hand luggage, to shoot the scene quickly, while keeping the plane's passengers and crew mollified with Manhunter crew jackets.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} {{begins with an}} open shot <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>airplane</b> flying {{surrounded}} by many doves, referencing the works of Hong Kong director John Woo. Spears appears with blond hair dressed as a flight attendant, receiving a phone call. After serving some of the passengers, she leads a middle aged overweight man {{to the bathroom and}} seduces him. She peels off the man's mask to reveal an attractive man (Matthew Felker) hiding underneath it and steals a black pass from his pocket when they resume kissing. Spears is then dropped {{into the back of a}} Ducati 999, driven by a shirtless male (Tyson Beckford) in a futuristic Paris, that was compared to the 1982 film Blade Runner. She wears a tight black catsuit and sports red hair, inspired by the character of Sydney Bristow from television series Alias. They pass a woman and lift up her dress, a homage to the iconic Marilyn Monroe scene in the 1955 film The Seven Year Itch. They also pass two women frolicking in a store window.|$|E

25|$|The couple cared {{little for}} the future, spent their money recklessly, and {{never tried to}} live on a budget. This was {{in part because they}} had pledged a mutual suicide pact, in which they planned on October 31, 1942, when the earth would be closest to the sun in several decades, to jump out <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>airplane</b> together.

25|$|He also {{retained}} {{an interest}} in navigational devices, and with Paul R. Heyl invented the Heyl–Briggs earth inductor compass. The compass used a spinning electric coil subjected to the magnetic field of the Earth to determine the bearing <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>airplane</b> {{in relation to the}} Earth's magnetic field. For this invention, they received the Magellan Medal of the American Philosophical Society in 1922. This type of compass was used by Admiral Byrd in his flight to the North Pole and by Charles Lindbergh on his 1927 trans-Atlantic flight.|$|E

25|$|In The Accountant's Story, Roberto Escobar {{discusses}} {{the means by}} which Pablo rose from middle-class simplicity and obscurity to one of the world's wealthiest men. Beginning in 1975, Pablo started developing his cocaine operation, flying out planes several times, mainly between Colombia and Panama, along smuggling routes into the United States. When he later bought fifteen bigger airplanes, including a Learjet and six helicopters, according to his son, a dear friend of Pablo's died during the landing <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>airplane,</b> and the plane was destroyed. Pablo reconstructed the airplane from the scrap parts that were left and later hung it above the gate to his ranch at Hacienda Nápoles.|$|E
25|$|The {{life cycle}} {{considered}} usually {{consists of a}} number of stages including: materials extraction, processing and manufacturing, product use, and product disposal. If the most environmentally harmful of these stages can be determined, then impact on the environment can be efficiently reduced by focusing on making changes for that particular phase. For example, the most energy-intensive life phase <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>airplane</b> or car is during use due to fuel consumption. One of the most effective ways to increase fuel efficiency is to decrease vehicle weight, and thus, car and airplane manufacturers can decrease environmental impact in a significant way by replacing heavier materials with lighter ones such as aluminium or carbon fiber-reinforced elements. The reduction during the use phase should be more than enough to balance additional raw material or manufacturing cost.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} better {{determine}} whether a fuel/air vapor explosion in the CWT would generate sufficient pressure to break apart the fuel tank and lead {{to the destruction of}} the airplane, tests were conducted in July and August 1997, using a retired Air France 747 at Bruntingthorpe Airfield, England. These tests simulated a fuel/air explosion in the CWT by igniting a propane/air mixture; this resulted in the failure of the tank structure due to overpressure. While the NTSB acknowledged that the test conditions at Bruntingthorpe were not fully comparable to the conditions that existed on TWA 800 {{at the time of the}} accident, previous fuel explosions in the CWTs of commercial airliners such as Avianca Flight 203 and Philippine Airlines Flight 143 confirmed that a CWT explosion could break apart the fuel tank and lead to the destruction <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>airplane.</b>|$|E

25|$|In 1932, Bossi heard <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>airplane</b> {{which had}} {{successfully}} flown while powered {{only by a}} 1-horsepower (0.75kW) engine. This prompted Bossi to calculate the minimum power that a manned aircraft would need to fly. The calculation yielded a value of approximately 0.94-horsepower (0.70kW), which convinced Bossi that Human-powered flight might be possible. During a trip to Philadelphia, Bossi tested {{the speed at which}} a glider would take off under tow. The experiment consisted of hiring a professional bicyclist to tow a glider. A spring scale was attached to the tow line to sense the force exerted by the bicyclist. This same experiment procedure was later repeated as part of the development of the Gossamer Condor and the Gossamer Albatross. The results confirmed that a speed at which the necessary lift could be obtained was indeed attainable.|$|E
25|$|Sigurd was {{interested}} in all-weather navigation systems, and suggested to Russell that together they could create a radio-based technology using microwaves that could detect airplanes at night or in clouds. Russell agreed, and they both quit their jobs, {{set up their own}} lab at Halcyon, and began developing plans for a device that could precisely determine the location and direction <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>airplane.</b> They initially attempted to create a radio compass, but could not develop a successful design, partly as a consequence of their isolation. They ultimately sought assistance from Russell's college roommate, William Webster Hansen, who was by then a professor at Stanford. With Hansen's help, they {{came to the attention of}} the head of the Stanford physics department, David Webster, who hired them in 1936 to work at the University in exchange for lab space, $100 a year for supplies, and an agreement that Stanford University would have half of the royalties for any patents they obtained.|$|E
25|$|To {{the upper}} right of the horse, a frightened female figure, {{who seems to be}} {{witnessing}} the scenes before her, appears to have floated into the room through a window. Her arm, also floating in, carries a flame-lit lamp. The lamp is positioned very close to the bulb, and is a symbol of hope, clashing with the lightbulb. From the right, an awe-struck woman staggers towards the center below the floating female figure. She looks up blankly into the blazing light bulb. Daggers that suggest screaming replace the tongues of the bull, grieving woman, and horse. A dove is scribed on the wall behind the bull. Part of its body comprises a crack in the wall through which bright light (hope, or the outside world) can be seen. On the far right, a woman with arms raised in terror is entrapped by fire from above and below; her right hand suggests the shape <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>airplane.</b> A dark wall with an open door defines the right end of the mural.|$|E
50|$|During takeoff and landing, an aircraft's wake sinks {{toward the}} ground and moves {{laterally}} away from the runway when the wind is calm. A 3 to 5 knot crosswind will tend to keep the upwind side of the wake in the runway area and may cause the downwind side to drift toward another runway. Since the wingtip vortices exist at the outer edge <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>airplane's</b> wake, this can be dangerous.|$|R

25|$|In 1932 Wilson Advisory {{staff member}} Gene Sarazen was {{inspired}} by the aerodynamics <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>airplane's</b> wing to create a club head that would glide smoothly through sand.

50|$|Within the 456th Group, {{individual}} aircraft were identified initially by numbers painted on their noses, with sets of two-digit numbers assigned to squadrons ("numbers in squadron"), but this system was later discontinued and <b>a</b> non-standard pattern <b>of</b> three-digit numbers employed (usually, but not always, {{the last three}} numbers <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>airplane's</b> USAAF serial number).
