5|$|Many {{traditional}} rugs, whether pile carpets or flatweave kilims, {{are divided}} into a central field and a framing border; both can have symmetries, though in handwoven carpets these are often slightly broken by small details, variations of pattern and shifts in colour introduced by the weaver. In kilims from Anatolia, the motifs used are themselves usually symmetrical. The general layout, too, is usually present, with arrangements such as stripes, stripes alternating with rows of motifs, and packed arrays of roughly hexagonal motifs. The field is commonly laid <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> wallpaper with a wallpaper group such as pmm, while the border may be laid <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> frieze of frieze group pm11, pmm2 or pma2. Turkish and Central Asian kilims often have three or more borders in different frieze groups. Weavers certainly had the intention of symmetry, without explicit knowledge of its mathematics.|$|E

5|$|A post-war {{review by}} the Australian government's Defence Committee {{recommended}} that the RAN be restructured around a task force incorporating multiple aircraft carriers. Initial plans were for three carriers, with two active and a third in reserve at any given time, although funding cuts led to the purchase of only two carriers in June 1947; Terrible and sister ship Majestic, for the combined cost of AU£2.75 million, plus stores, fuel, and ammunition. As Terrible was fitted <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> flagship and was the closer of the two ships to completion, construction was finished without major modification. Although Terrible was due for completion on 24 June 1948, a skilled labour shortage affected {{the installation of the}} ship's boilers, causing the Admiralty to revise the delivery date to October 1948.|$|E
5|$|Adrian Paul {{said that}} Vandernoot portrayed Lisa as a smoker to mark her <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{different}} character from Tessa.

According to Paul, Lisa {{was more like a}} temptress to MacLeod than was Tessa. According to Panzer, the original script featured Horton sending Lisa to kill MacLeod on the latter's barge. After reading the draft script, Adrian Paul thought the idea of Lisa trying to kill MacLeod on Tessa's grave would have a more dramatic effect.|$|E
5|$|After gaining {{tropical}} characteristics {{throughout most}} of the day on November3, the storm was designated Tropical Depression Eleven. The depression quickly strengthened into Tropical Storm Florence, the sixth named storm of the season. The storm briefly underwent rapid intensification, strengthening into a hurricane, before leveling <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Category 1 hurricane. Florence was subsequently upgraded to a Category 2 hurricane on November7. However, a large extratropical cyclone located to the north caused the hurricane to rapidly accelerate, with forward speeds reaching 58mph (93km/h). By the next day, Florence lost its identity, while still producing hurricane-force winds, as it was absorbed by the extratropical cyclone.|$|E
