In part one, he sets out to define passion as the noninstrumental dealings that we have with others; they organize and are organized around the need and danger {{that is at the}} heart of <b>our</b> <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> others. This definition is developed out of the argument that the individual is in constant conflict in the world: at once attempting to assert the self as individual and establish difference, but at same time to gain acceptance by others. We are thus defined by the mutual need and reliance upon each other, and the mutual fear of each other in acceptance or rejection. Passion {{is at the heart of}} this reciprocal and infinite terror and longing for each other.|$|E

When Justice William O. Douglas traveled to India in 1950, the first question he was asked was, [...] "Why does America tolerate the lynching of Negroes?"

40|$|A {{striking}} {{aspect of}} current debt {{is that it}} seems characterized by limitlessness in space and time. Benjamin’s account of capitalism as a permanent cult gives a clue to its peculiar infinity. Debt shows the traits of a messianic time. More precisely, it partakes in the increasingly dominative temporality of preemption, where a catastrophic future is endlessly postponed by a homeopathic kathecon which in its action remoulds also the past. Disentangling from this logic through its intensification can hardly be successful, if anything because the capitalist engine is running idle at faster and faster speed. Alternatively, one should look for an interruption, a disengagement from the thrust to infinite valorization, {{in the direction of}} inoperosity, as a possibility that messianic time also discloses. To redeem our enslavement to debt, however, we have not to look at <b>our</b> <b>relation</b> <b>with</b> money, but at <b>our</b> <b>relation</b> <b>with</b> the world...|$|R

From an aesthetic standard that relates body to beauty and success, we intend to put in question the social context where eating disorders have been produced. To achieve this objective, we base our study on anorexia and bulimia analysis. The symptoms of these psychopathologies have difficult treatment and reflect an excessive worry about weight, corporal image and fattening up. Our interest is to contribute to this discussion, avoiding an individualized perspective, focused on anorexic and/or bulimic young boy or girl and on the dysfunctional interactions of his/her familiar system, but shifting the focus on eating disorders as devices that denunciate the extremism of the way of thinking, feeling and experiencing body in our society.

2500|$|By {{the time}} of the German {{invasion}} in 1939, antisemitism was escalating, and hostility towards Jews was a mainstay of the right-wing political forces post-Piłsudski regime and also the Catholic Church. Discrimination and violence against Jews had rendered the Polish Jewish population increasingly destitute, as was the case throughout much of Central and Eastern Europe. Despite the impending threat to the Polish Republic from Nazi Germany, there was little effort seen in the way of reconciliation with Poland's Jewish population. In July 1939 the pro-government Gazeta Polska wrote, [...] "The fact that <b>our</b> <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> the Reich are worsening does not in the least deactivate our program in the Jewish question—there is not and cannot be any common ground between our internal Jewish problem and Poland's relations with the Hitlerite Reich." [...] Escalating hostility towards Polish Jews and an official Polish government desire to remove Jews from Poland continued until the German invasion of Poland.|$|E

In addition, Rhodes was an early architect of the Natives Land Act, 1913, which would limit the areas of the country that black Africans were allowed to less than 10%.

Administratively, it is, if one can say so, a confederation of autocephalous, that is, completely independent of one another, Orthodox Churches. (...) Problems arising in relations between Orthodox Churches are not theological or dogmatic in nature, but rather pertaining, for instance, to who should govern particular territories. Historically, some regions in different times were parts of different Local Churches. And today there may be two Churches who claim a particular region. (...) In the 1990s, we had a very difficult streak in relations with the Patriarchate of Constantinople, who unilaterally created its own church jurisdiction in our canonical territory, namely, in Estonia. It happened because in the 20s and 30s the Estonian Orthodox Church was temporarily part of the Patriarchate of Constantinople. Because of this, <b>our</b> <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> Constantinople were suspended for several months. They were restored later but remained tense.

40|$|According to the {{systematic}} approach, solitude {{corresponds to a}} lack of communication between a singular system (a human being) and its surroundings (be they another human being, society, or space). Taking this definition axiomatically, the following hypotheses and the main thesis may be formed: solitude can be studied through <b>our</b> <b>relation</b> <b>with</b> space and built environment; solitude is a condition capable of disconnecting us with our surroundings; solitude can either depreciate or give value to the way we experience and interact with our surroundings; solitude can either be enforced and depreciated, or mitigated by our interaction with space, and therefore appreciated. The aim of this research was to investigate if, why, and how this ontological and existential concern may become part of architectural design.

40|$|This {{text was}} {{conceived}} as {{a dialogue with the}} preceding text by Gérard Wacjman, entitled "Intimate Exposed, Intimate Extorted. " Three psychoanalytic paradigms of 'the intimate' are identified throughout Lacan's teachings: the unconscious, the fantasy and the sinthome. First I show that each of them is already in itself characterized by a particular form of atopia, meaning {{that it is impossible to}} localize their particular version of 'the intimate'. This atopia goes for the subject as well as for the Other, but neither of them is conscious of this. &# 13; &# 13; This is where art comes in. In accordance with Wacjman's fundamental idea of art as an "exposition of the intimate", I show how this exposition of the atopia of the three Lacanian versions of 'the intimate' has to assume three different forms in order to convince both parties that 'it' really is beyond any grasp. 1. Art once used to stage the atopia of the 'intimate' of the unconscious, of <b>our</b> <b>relation</b> <b>with</b> language. 2. Nowadays the plastic arts continue to occupy themselves with extimising the atopia of the intimate of the fantasy, of <b>our</b> <b>relation</b> <b>with</b> the object of enjoyment. 3. Meanwhile the most interesting forms of plastic arts, for the future, are starting to monstrate the atopia of 'the intimate' of the sintom. Can we be confident that psychoanalysis will survive long enough in order to discover and conceptualize a fourth form of the intimate in time – and that some form of the plastic arts once again will able be able to expose the atopia of this intimacy in a way that once again reveals the utter impossibility of grasping it...|$|R
