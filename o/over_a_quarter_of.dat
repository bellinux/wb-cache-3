5|$|Outside {{the city}} walls, suburbs had sprung up {{providing}} {{homes for the}} craftsmen and tradespeople who flocked to the already overcrowded city. These were shanty towns with wooden shacks and no sanitation. The government had tried to control this development but had failed and <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> a million people lived here. Other immigrants had taken over fine town houses, vacated by Royalists who had fled the country during the Commonwealth, converting them into tenements with different families in every room. These properties were soon vandalised and became rat-infested slums.|$|E

In 1842, Dr. James Wilson and Dr. James Manby Gully, leading exponents of hydrotherapy, set up clinics in Malvern (Holyrood House {{for women and}} Tudor House for men). Malvern expanded rapidly as a residential spa. Several large hotels {{and many of the}} large villas in Malvern date from its heyday. Many smaller hotels and guest houses were built between about 1842 and 1875. By 1855 there were already 95hotels and boarding houses and by 1865 <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> the town's 800houses were boarding and lodging houses.

Jack jumper stings are the single {{most common cause of}} anaphylaxis in patients at the Royal Hobart Hospital. The ant has also been a major cause of anaphylaxis outside Tasmania, notably around Adelaide and the outskirts of Melbourne, while cases in New South Wales and Western Australia have been more distributed. One in 50 adults have been reported to suffer anaphylaxis due to the jack jumper or other Myrmecia ants.|$|E
5|$|The film {{received}} positive reviews {{upon its}} release in December 1939, although some reviewers found it overlong. The casting was widely praised and many reviewers found Leigh especially suited to {{her role as}} Scarlett. At the 12th Academy Awards, it received ten Academy Awards (eight competitive, two honorary) from thirteen nominations, including wins for Best Picture, Best Director (Fleming), Best Adapted Screenplay (posthumously awarded to Sidney Howard), Best Actress (Leigh), and Best Supporting Actress (Hattie McDaniel, becoming the first African-American to win an Academy Award). It set records for {{the total number of}} wins and nominations at the time. The film was immensely popular, becoming the highest-earning film made up to that point, and retained the record for <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> a century. When adjusted for monetary inflation, it is still the most successful film in box-office history.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary sector}} of the economy {{accounts}} for most of the Falkland Islands' gross domestic product, with the fishing industry alone contributing between 50% and 60% of annual GDP; agriculture also contributes significantly to GDP and employs about a tenth of the population. A little <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> the workforce serves the Falkland Islands government, making it the archipelago's largest employer. Tourism, part of the service economy, has been spurred by increased interest in Antarctic exploration and the creation of direct air links with the United Kingdom and South America. Tourists, mostly cruise ship passengers, are attracted by the archipelago's wildlife and environment, as well as activities such as fishing and wreck diving; the majority are based in accommodation found in Stanley. The islands' major exports include wool, hides, venison, fish and squid; its main imports include fuel, building materials and clothing.|$|E

The temporary increases in blood pressure caused by the drug can be {{a risk factor for}} users with pre-existing hypertension. These qualitative somatic effects caused by psilocybin have been corroborated by several early clinical studies. A 2005 magazine survey of club goers in the UK found that nausea or vomiting was experienced by <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> those who had used psilocybin mushrooms in the last year, although this effect is caused by the mushroom rather than psilocybin itself. In one study, administration of gradually increasing dosages of psilocybin daily for 21 days had no measurable effect on electrolyte levels, blood sugar levels, or liver toxicity tests.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, {{efforts were}} {{initiated}} to avert Belfast expected scrapping and to preserve {{her as a}} museum ship. A joint committee of the Imperial War Museum, the National Maritime Museum, and the Ministry of Defence were established and then reported in June 1968 that preservation was practical. In 1971, the government decided against preservation, prompting {{the formation of the}} private HMS Belfast Trust to campaign for her preservation. The efforts of the Trust were successful, and the government transferred the ship to the Trust in July 1971. Brought to London, she was moored on the River Thames near Tower Bridge in the Pool of London. Opened to the public in October 1971, Belfast became a branch of the Imperial War Museum in 1978. A popular tourist attraction, Belfast receives <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> a million visitors per year.

In Miyazaki City, 21,483households were evacuated following reports of significant overflow on the nearby river. Another 10,000residences were vacated in Nobeoka following similar reports. The entirety of the West Japan Railway Company was shut down. Canceled train services affected 77,800people on Shikoku. Ferry service was also shut down, cutting off transportation {{for tens of thousands of}} people. In addition, at least 723flights were cancelled because of the storm. Japan's second-largest refinery, Idemitsu Kosan, stopped shipments to other refineries across the area, and Japan's largest refinery, Nippon Oil, stopped all sea shipments. The Cosmo Oil Company, Japan's fourth largest refinery, stopped all shipments to Yokkaichi and Sakaide refineries. About 700schools in the country were closed. Approximately 1,500soldiers were dispatched to Tokyo to help coastal areas prepare for Typhoon Nabi's arrival, and to clean up after the storm.
