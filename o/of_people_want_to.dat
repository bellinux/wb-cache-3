Several agents pursued him, {{as he ran}} directly towards the North Portico doors, which were unlocked. President Barack Obama and his daughters had just left the White House and were heading to Camp David {{at the time of}} the incident. Michelle Obama was also not home, having travelled to the retreat earlier. Agents stated they chose not to shoot at Gonzalez as he did not have a weapon in his hands, and was not wearing clothing that could conceal a significant amount of explosives; the possibility of accidentally hitting civilians beyond the fence was also cited. A senior official stated: [...] "A lot <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> judge the Secret Service for not shooting, but [...] number of things have to be considered in this situation, including whether or not the principal is in the residence" [...] adding, [...] "given what's emerged about [...] since the arrest, maybe we'll look back and say the Secret Service played a role in saving his life." ...|$|E

We don't want to bring a horn section or a violin player out with us. A lot <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> hear the old stuff, and that stuff is still just as significant to us." [...] The band also decided to play small theaters instead of stadiums and festivals, as Armstrong explained that they felt better to [...] "go to a place like The Fillmore and The Warfield and know it's actually going to sell out" [...] instead of playing to half-empty large venues. The Nimrod tour marked the first time the band performed its now-routine ritual of inviting audience members onstage to play instruments. [...] During the tour, Armstrong felt that he became a better performer, noting, [...] "I think some people walk away from a Green Day concert with the emotions you would get from some kind of theater performance where the crowd feels involved — where it's not just about the singer. It's not just about the band." ...|$|E

She chose to sell the rights to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), Hollywood's number one studio, {{on the condition that}} she be the star. As part of the deal she also received the director of her choice, George Cukor, and picked James Stewart and Cary Grant (to whom she ceded top-billing) as co-stars. Before filming began, Hepburn shrewdly noted, [...] "I don't want to make a grand entrance in this picture. Moviegoers... think I'm too la-di-da or something. A lot <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> see me fall flat on my face." [...] Thus the film began with Grant knocking the actress flat on her backside. Berg describes how the character was crafted to have audiences [...] "laugh at her enough that they would ultimately sympathize with her", which Hepburn felt was crucial in [...] "recreating" [...] her public image. The Philadelphia Story {{was one of the biggest}} hits of 1940, breaking records at Radio City Music Hall. The review in Time declared, [...] "Come on back, Katie, all is forgiven." [...] Herb Golden of Variety stated, [...] "It's Katharine Hepburn's picture... The perfect conception of all flighty but characterful Main Line socialite gals rolled into one, the story without her is almost inconceivable."
