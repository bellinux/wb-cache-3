Prisoners were not allowed to speak to each other, and, when out of their cells, were required to wear a cap with a thick veil so they would not be recognised by other prisoners.|$|E

In the years since, it {{has sold more than}} 30million copies and been translated into more than 40 languages. The novel has never been out of print in hardcover or paperback, and {{has become part of the}} standard literature curriculum. A 2008 survey of secondary books read by students between grades 9–12 in the U.S. indicates the novel is the most widely read book in these grades. A 1991 survey by the Book of the Month Club and the Library of Congress Center for the Book found that To Kill a Mockingbird was rated behind <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bible</b> in books that are [...] "most often cited as making a difference". It is considered by some to be the Great American Novel.|$|E
2500|$|The Evangelical Christian Church, {{also known}} as [...] "Christian Disciples" [...] became the Stone-Campbell Movement, also called the Restoration Movement [...] which arose on the frontiers of early 19th-century America. Like minded Methodists, Baptists, and Presbyterians {{abandoned}} denominational labels {{in order to be}} [...] "Christians only" [...] from the Stone group, and [...] "Disciples" [...] from the Campbell group. They called followers from both groups to join in Christian unity and restore the ideals of the primitive New Testament church, holding <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bible</b> as authoritative.|$|E

2500|$|Seventh-day Adventists believe church co-founder Ellen G. White (1827–1915) was {{inspired}} by God as a prophet, today understood {{as a manifestation of}} the New Testament [...] "gift of prophecy", as described in the official beliefs of the church. [...] Her works are officially considered to hold a secondary role to the Bible, but in practice there is wide variation among Adventists as to exactly how much authority should be attributed to her writings. With understanding she claimed was received in visions, White made administrative decisions and gave personal messages of encouragement or rebuke to church members. Seventh-day Adventists believe that <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bible</b> is sufficient for forming doctrines and beliefs, a position Ellen White supported by statements inclusive of, [...] "the Bible, and the Bible alone, is our rule of faith".|$|E
2500|$|Studd {{believed}} that God's purposes could be confirmed through providential coincidences, {{such as a}} sum of money being donated spontaneously {{at just the right}} moment. He encouraged Christians to take risks in planning missionary ventures, trusting in God to provide. His spirituality was intense, and he mostly read <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bible.</b> Another work that influenced him was The Christian's Secret of a Happy Life. Although he {{believed that}} God sometimes healed physical illnesses through prayer and the anointing of oil, he also accepted that some ailments were chronic, and in his last years he regularly took morphine, causing some controversy. Studd also believed in plain speaking and muscular Christianity, and his call for Christians to embrace a [...] "Don't Care a Damn" [...] (DCD) attitude to worldly things caused some scandal. He believed that missionary work was urgent, and that those who were unevangelised would be condemned to hell.|$|E
