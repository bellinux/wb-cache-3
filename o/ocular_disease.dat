25|$|Prior to any {{physical}} examination, {{the diagnosis of}} keratoconus frequently begins with an ophthalmologist's or optometrist's assessment of the person's medical history, particularly the chief complaint and other visual symptoms, the presence of any history of <b>ocular</b> <b>disease</b> or injury which might affect vision, {{and the presence of}} any family history of <b>ocular</b> <b>disease.</b> An eye chart, such as a standard Snellen chart of progressively smaller letters, is then used to determine the person's visual acuity. The eye examination may proceed to measurement of the localized curvature of the cornea with a manual keratometer, with detection of irregular astigmatism suggesting a possibility of keratoconus. Severe cases can exceed the instrument's measuring ability. A further indication can be provided by retinoscopy, in which a light beam is focused on the person's retina and the reflection, or reflex, observed as the examiner tilts the light source back and forth. Keratoconus is amongst the ophthalmic conditions that exhibit a scissor reflex action of two bands moving toward and away from each other like the blades of a pair of scissors.|$|E
25|$|Small {{peptides}} can specifically {{inhibit the}} RNR2 subunits from binding with RNR1 when {{they share a}} significant similarity with the normal RNR2 C-terminus. This inhibition RNR2 binding to RNR1 has been tested successfully in herpes simplex virus (HSV) RNR. When a 7 amino acid oligomer (GAVVNDL) truncated from the C-terminus of the RNR2 subunit was used in competition assays, it prevented the normal RNR2 from forming an enzymatically active complex with RNR1. Other small peptide inhibitors similar to the RNR2 C-terminus have also been used successfully to inhibit HSV RNR enzymatic activity and thus HSV replication. In mice models of stromal keratitis and corneal neovascularization (HSV <b>ocular</b> <b>disease),</b> a small RNR2 C-terminal analog BILD 1263 {{has been reported to}} inhibit RNR and is effective in preventing these diseases. In some cases, although treatment with small C-terminal analogs may not stop disease spreading, they can still help in healing. In the acyclovir-resistant HSV (PAAr5), a small peptide inhibitor BILD 1633 has been reported to be 5 to 10 times more potent than BILD 1263 against cutaneous PAAr5 infection. A combination therapy approach (BILD 1633 and acyclovir) is more effective to heal topical lesions in mice. These data suggest that small peptide inhibitors that compete with RNR2 for binding to RNR1 are useful in preventing the spread of HSV.|$|E

HIV- 1 -infected patients aged over 17 years who visited our clinic {{for the first time}} between January 2004 and December 2013 and underwent full ophthalmologic examination were enrolled. At our clinic, ophthalmologic examination, including dilated retinal examination by indirect ophthalmoscopy was routinely conducted by ophthalmologists on the first visit. The prevalence of ophthalmologic diseases and associated factors including the existence of ocular symptoms were analyzed. Of the 1, 515 study patients, cytomegalovirus retinitis (CMV-R) was diagnosed in 24 (2 %) patients, HIV retinopathy (HIV-R) in 127 (8 %), cataract in 31 (2 %), ocular syphilis in 4 (0. 3 %), and uveitis with unknown cause in 8 (0. 5 %). Other <b>ocular</b> <b>diseases</b> were diagnosed in 14 patients. The CD 4 count was < 200 /μL in all CMV-R cases and 87 % of HIV-R.

40|$|The eye is {{continuously}} {{exposed to}} solar UV radiation and pollutants, making it prone to oxidative attacks. In fact, oxidative damage {{is a major}} cause of age-related <b>ocular</b> <b>diseases</b> including cataract, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. Since the nature of lens cells, trabecular meshwork cells, retinal ganglion cells, retinal pigment epithelial cells and photoreceptors is post-mitotic, autophagy plays a critical role in their cellular homeostasis.

This review discusses various barriers to {{drug delivery}} and provides comprehensive information for designing nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery systems for the treatment of <b>ocular</b> <b>diseases.</b> Nanoparticles can be designed to improve penetration, controlled release, and drug targeting. As highlighted in this review, the therapeutic efficacy of drugs in <b>ocular</b> <b>diseases</b> has been reported to be enhanced by the use of nanoparticles such as liposomes, micro/nanospheres, microemulsions, and dendrimers.

40|$|Purpose: Alcohol {{consumption}} is inversely {{correlated with the}} incidence of cardiovascular disease. It is thought that red wine is specifically responsible for these cardiovascular benefits, due to its ability to reduce vascular inflammation, facilitate vasorelaxation, and inhibit angiogenesis. This is because of its high polyphenolic content. Resveratrol is the main biologically active polyphenol within red wine. Owing to its vascular-enhancing properties, resveratrol may be effective in the microcirculation of the eye, thereby helping prevent <b>ocular</b> <b>diseases</b> such as age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and glaucoma. Such conditions are accountable for worldwide prevalence of visual loss. Method: A review of the relevant literature {{was conducted on the}} ScienceDirect, Web of Science, and PubMed databases. Key words used to carry out the searches included 'red wine', 'polyphenols', 'resveratrol', 'eye' and 'ocular'. Articles relating to the effects of resveratrol on the eye were reviewed. Results: The protective effects of resveratrol within the eye are extensive. It has been demonstrated to have anti-oxidant, anti-apoptotic, anti-tumourogenic, anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenic and vasorelaxant properties. There are potential benefits of resveratrol supplementation across a wide range of <b>ocular</b> <b>diseases.</b> The molecular mechanisms underlying these protective actions are diverse. Conclusion: Evidence suggests that resveratrol may have potential in the treatment of several <b>ocular</b> <b>diseases.</b> However, while there are many studies indicating plausible biological mechanisms using animal models and in-vitro retinal cells there is a paucity of human research. The evidence base for the use of resveratrol in the management of <b>ocular</b> <b>diseases</b> needs to be increased before recommendations can be made for the use of resveratrol as an ocular supplement. © 2014 Springer-Verlag...|$|R
