5|$|On 2 October 1998, the TSB {{initiated}} a heavy lift operation {{to retrieve the}} major portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wreckage</b> from the deep water before the expected winter storms began. By 21 October, an estimated 27% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wreckage</b> was recovered.|$|E
5|$|Glasnost {{reforms in}} the same year brought about a {{relaxation}} of press censorship; consequently reports started to appear in the Soviet press suggesting that the Soviet military knew the location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wreckage</b> and had possession of the flight data recorders. On December 10, 1991, Senator Jesse Helms of the Committee on Foreign Relations, wrote to Boris Yeltsin requesting information concerning the survival of passengers and crew of KAL007 including the fate of Congressman Larry McDonald.|$|E
5|$|The 2002 {{documentary}} , {{directed by}} James Cameron and filmed in May–June 2002 using {{smaller and more}} agile Mir submersibles, reconstructed the events leading to the sinking. These provided the first interior shots. His findings were {{that there was not}} enough damage below the waterline to confirm that she had been sunk rather than scuttled. Close inspection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wreckage</b> confirmed that none of the torpedoes or shells had penetrated the second layer of the inner hull. Using small ROVs to examine the interior, Cameron discovered that the torpedo blasts had failed to shatter the torpedo bulkheads.|$|E
2500|$|All 25 {{people on}} board the {{aircraft}} perished. [...] The crash was the deadliest crash in 2011 in Indonesia and <b>the</b> first crash <b>of</b> a Xi'an MA60 involving fatalities. <b>The</b> <b>wreckage</b> {{was found to be}} submerged and broke into few pieces. The accident site was about 800 meters south west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> runway 01 or 550 meters from <b>the</b> coastline. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wreckages</b> were submerged in the shallow sea between 7 down to 15 meter deep.|$|R
5|$|Stock footage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plane <b>wreckage</b> was {{utilized}} in the 2004 film, The Day After Tomorrow.|$|R
50|$|During October 2000 {{a survey}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dakar <b>wreckage</b> and <b>the</b> <b>wreckage</b> site was {{undertaken}} by Nauticos corporation and the Israeli navy, some artifacts were recovered, including the submarine's bridge, the boat's gyrocompass and many small items.|$|R
5|$|The {{stricken}} airliner crashed onto Mount Bliss in the San Gabriel Mountains at {{an elevation}} of approximately , where the bulk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wreckage</b> landed in a gorge. Fire department officials sent search and rescue helicopters to the crash site, but efforts were hampered by thick fog. Nine bodies were initially found at the crash site, {{a number of them}} intact and still strapped into their seats. News reports indicated that these bodies had apparently been thrown clear on impact, and had come to rest alongside the tail section of the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|After Reggie catches Delsin vandalizing a billboard, their {{subsequent}} argument is interrupted when a military truck carrying three Conduit prisoners crashes on the Akomish reservation. Two of the Conduits escape, but Delsin manages {{to pull the}} third one, Hank, out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wreckage,</b> and inadvertently absorb his smoke powers. Shocked and frightened, Delsin pursues Hank {{in an effort to}} figure out what has happened and how to control his powers. However, they are both cornered by Brooke Augustine. She encases Hank in concrete and questions Delsin, suspecting him of hiding something. Delsin can choose to either tell Augustine the truth about his powers or reveal nothing. Regardless, Augustine renders him unconscious before moving on to the other tribe members.|$|E
5|$|Examination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wreckage</b> {{revealed}} that {{large portions of}} the wings' skin were badly glued and {{that a number of}} rib caps and stringers were not glued at all. Many panel pins were not connected to the structure at all and many of the bradawl holes necessary to equalize pressure between the inside of the wing and the outside were missing entirely. The crash of such an advanced aircraft shocked the entire industry and caused a six-month hiatus in design work. Polikarpov overreacted to its loss and built the structure of a number of his subsequent aircraft stronger, and thus, heavier, than it needed to be. All further work on the project was abandoned following the crash, nominally for lack of a suitable engine.|$|E
50|$|Due to <b>the</b> {{remoteness}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crash, <b>the</b> <b>wreckage</b> was not recovered but secured on site by the New Zealand Army in 1964. This {{is similar}} to New Zealand's other major air disaster, Air New Zealand Flight 901, which remains on <b>the</b> slopes <b>of</b> Mount Erebus in Antarctica where it crashed.|$|R
50|$|Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lack <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plane's <b>wreckage</b> {{and other}} {{sufficient}} information, probable cause for <b>the</b> loss <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aircraft {{could not be}} determined.|$|R
25|$|In 1958 {{the wreck}} was raised and transported to Moss in Norway, {{where it was}} {{scavenged}} due to its valuable contents such as tungsten in the keel, natural rubber and one metric ton <b>of</b> opium. <b>The</b> <b>wreckage</b> was then broken up at Gothenburg.|$|R
5|$|In August 2001, an {{expedition}} {{headed by the}} marine archaeologist and author Clive Cussler announced that they had found {{the remains of a}} ship embedded in the Rochelois reef. Only a few pieces of timber and some metal artifacts could be salvaged, the remainder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wreckage</b> being lost within the coral. Initial tests on the wood indicated that it was the type extensively used in New York shipyards at the time of Mary Celestes 1872 refit, and it seemed the remains of the Mary Celeste had been found. However, dendrochronological tests carried out by Scott St George of the Geological Survey of Canada showed that the wood came from trees, most probably from the US state of Georgia, that would still have been growing in 1894, about ten years after the Mary Celestes demise.|$|E
5|$|Investigators {{believed}} the aircraft captain survived {{for a short}} time after the crash. His body was a short distance away from his seat and both were a few metres ahead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wreckage</b> where they had been thrown after the nose of the aircraft was split open in the impact with a large tree. The seat belt had not broken, but it had been undone. The captain's tunic was pulled up over his head as though to protect his face from the heat of the nearby inferno. Investigators believed he survived the crash and undid his seat belt to drag himself away from the fire. His body was not burnt, but autopsy showed both his legs were broken and he died from a fractured skull.|$|E
5|$|James Polehinke, {{the first}} officer, {{suffered}} serious injuries, including multiple broken bones, a collapsed lung, and severe bleeding. Lexington-Fayette and airport police officers pulled Polehinke out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wreckage.</b> Polehinke underwent surgery for his injuries, including an amputation {{of his left}} leg. Doctors later determined that Polehinke had suffered brain damage and has no memory of the crash or the {{events leading up to}} it. , Polehinke was a wheelchair user. During the same month, Polehinke filed a lawsuit against the airport and the company that designed the runway and taxi lights. A January 2014 episode of Piers Morgan Live reported that Polehinke was paraplegic.|$|E

500|$|In 1998, two Argentine mountaineers {{climbing}} Mount Tupungato—about [...] west-southwest of Mendoza City, {{and about}} [...] east <b>of</b> Santiago—found <b>the</b> <b>wreckage</b> <b>of</b> a Rolls-Royce Merlin aircraft engine, along with twisted {{pieces of metal}} and shreds <b>of</b> clothing, in <b>the</b> Tupungato Glacier at an elevation of [...]|$|R
25|$|At {{the time}} it was speculated that Thomas may have been decapitated by the drive chain. Later {{investigation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recovered <b>wreckage</b> suggested instead, that the rear right-hand wheel had failed, overturning Babs.|$|R
5|$|Shortly after 15:25, {{and without}} warning, {{a series of}} violent explosions tore through the rear part of the ship. She capsized five minutes later. Some thought {{that she had been}} torpedoed by a German U-boat or detonated a submarine-laid mine, but {{examination}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wreckage</b> revealed that the explosions were internal. The divers sent to investigate the ship reported that the explosions began in either the rear 9.2-inch shellroom or the 3-pounder and small arms magazine. The Admiralty court-martial into the causes of her loss concluded that it was caused by an internal ammunition explosion, possibly due to faulty cordite. The Admiralty issued a revised list of the dead and missing that totaled 390 in January 1916, but did not list the women and children on board that day. Losses are listed from 390 to 421.|$|E
5|$|Of the 56 {{people on}} board, 38, {{including}} Hood and Beaumont, {{died in the}} crash. Eighteen survived, albeit with injuries, and climbed out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wreckage.</b> After briefly settling the others, one of the passengers, Dr Cecil MacLaren, led four others—young newlyweds Robert and Shannon Hargreaves, Mrs Sharon Coles, and her four-year-old daughter Tracey—off {{in the direction of}} a nearby village in search of water. The other 13 remained close to the wreckage. Meanwhile, nine guerrillas made their way towards the crash site, and reached it at about 17:45. Three of the 13 survivors remaining at the crash site hid on seeing figures approaching: Rhodesian Army reservist Anthony Hill, 39, took cover in the surrounding bush, while businessman Hans Hansen and his wife Diana did the same. This left 10 passengers in full view near the wreckage, including four women and two girls (aged 11 and 4).|$|E
5|$|On 11 April 1939 he {{narrowly}} {{escaped with}} his life alongside Geoffrey de Havilland; both men parachuting to safety. They had taken a Moth Minor into the air to test its response to spins. The prototypes had an anti-spin parachute but preceding tests had been carried out without the need to resort to the safety measure. Geoffrey put the aircraft into a left-hand spin which was recovered. Climbing back to 8,000 feet the aircraft was put into it a right-hand spin. The engine cut out, the nose reared-up and the aircraft stalled and entered a flat spin. Geoffrey asked John through the Gosport tube to try to escape their perilous situation after the controls proved non-responsive to de Havilland's efforts. Both decided to parachute out. Upon doing so the Moth declined its nose and recovered from the spin. The engine ignition had been left on and the wind-milling propeller started the engine. The aircraft began circling the descending airmen at dangerously close range. Fortunately it descended {{at a faster rate}} and was destroyed when it hit the ground. Cunningham casually took pictures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wreckage</b> and his parachute which exemplified his cool nature.|$|E
25|$|In July 2015, News Corp Australia {{published}} <b>the</b> transcript <b>of</b> a 17-minute video {{recorded at}} the scene shortly after the crash. The transcript and published segments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> video indicated that Russian-backed rebels arrived at the crash site in <b>the</b> expectation <b>of</b> finding <b>the</b> <b>wreckage</b> <b>of</b> a military aircraft and of locating crew that had parachuted from the aircraft.|$|R
25|$|Almost all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aircraft's <b>wreckage</b> still lies {{where it}} {{came to rest on}} <b>the</b> slopes <b>of</b> Mount Erebus, under a layer of snow and ice. During warm periods, when snow recedes, it is visible from the air.|$|R
2500|$|The {{area around}} Minong Mine sports small prehistoric pits, {{as well as}} the larger pits (now filled with water) and shafts from the 1870s mine. [...] Piles <b>of</b> tailings, <b>the</b> <b>wreckage</b> <b>of</b> a smithy, {{railroad}} tracks, and ore carts also are at the site. [...] As <b>of</b> 1994, <b>the</b> dam near McCargoe Cove was still intact.|$|R
5|$|A rocket-ship {{carrying}} astronaut John Corcoran (Michael Emmet) launches and orbits the Earth, {{marking the}} United States' first manned space launch. Shortly after taking off, {{the ship is}} struck by an unknown object, forcing Corcoran to abort the mission and land. However, the equipment cannot handle the fast descent back into the atmosphere and the ship crash lands in the woods, killing Corcoran. Dave Randall (Ed Nelson) and Donna Bixby (Georgianna Carter), two technicians from a nearby space agency tracking station, locate the crashed ship and recover Corcoran's body. They are baffled, however, by {{what appears to be}} a giant tear in the side of the destroyed spacecraft and a mud-like substance covering some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wreckage.</b> Randall and Bixby are joined by lead scientist Dr. Alex Wyman (Tyler McVey), technician Steve Dunlap (John Baer) and physician Julie Benson (Angela Greene), who was also Corcoran's fiancee. Wyman observes that Corcoran's body exhibits no signs of rigor mortis, and that the blood pooling beside him is not livid as it should be. The team brings the corpse back to their lab to run tests and find further irregularities. Although the body lacks a heartbeat or pulse, it maintains the blood pressure of a living human being. After looking at his blood in a microscope, they find unusual, unidentifiable cells that seem resistant to destruction from human white blood cells.|$|E
