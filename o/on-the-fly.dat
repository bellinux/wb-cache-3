5|$|The Pendolino has {{received}} bad publicity {{since the first}} units were taken in service for its serious reliability issues, mostly caused by technical problems with the tilting system and the couplers. The coupling problems grew particularly important with {{the expansion of the}} Pendolino network in 2006, requiring rapid <b>on-the-fly</b> coupling of two trains at intersection stations. Because the units often could not be coupled the train units had to be run as two separate trains running one after another. This consumed one extra train slot on the heavily used rail sections causing cascading timetable delays. Sometimes two trains would not separate after coupling them, caused by moisture in the couplers. Due to the problems VR ended the practice of coupling Pendolino trains <b>on-the-fly</b> at the two intersection stations; in Tampere in late 2007 and in Kouvola during autumn 2008.|$|E
5|$|Norton AntiSpam, the renamed spam {{filtering}} feature, has {{a set of}} spam rules, which {{cannot be}} viewed or edited. Whitelists and blacklists of senders can be created. Users may also create their own spam definitions. AntiSpam integrates with Outlook, Outlook Express, and Eudora, allowing users to tag e-mail as spam <b>on-the-fly.</b> E-mail identified as spam are either quarantined by default, however the feature can be configured to delete such messages automatically. In CNET testing, AntiSpam correctly identified 94 percent of spam messages.|$|E
5|$|After the {{founding}} of Night School Studio, the team set up a casting call for voice actors on Backstage. Prior to actors being cast and their lines recorded, the team had placeholder subtitles in the game. Lead engineer Bryant Cannon recalled that without the voices, he was unsure whether the game {{would be fun to}} play; after the voices were added, he could see the characters as believable people having conversations. Hines directed recording sessions, allowing him to change dialogue <b>on-the-fly</b> if he felt material did not work when voiced by the actors. All of the actors voiced their lines separately, with their conversations in-game stitched together in post-production.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, an Atari Jaguar port of Another World was {{confirmed}} {{and approved by}} Chahi. It was released as a limited collector's item in cartridge form, complete with a box and manual published by the association Retro-gaming Connexion (RGC) in 2013. The game engine was rewritten especially for the Atari Jaguar {{to make use of}} the console's several processors: the GPU and blitter perform polygon rendering; the GPU performs <b>on-the-fly</b> data decompression; the DSP plays stereo music and sound effects; and the 68000 CPU performs JIT compilation and execution of the scripts. The Jaguar version is playable in the original graphics 16-color mode and Deluxe 15th Anniversary graphics 256-color mode. It can be played in normal and speed-run modes. It supports five languages: English, German, French, Italian, and Spanish.|$|E
5|$|On 19 August 2011, VR {{announced}} it would start a refurbishment of all its Sm3 units to improve the operating conditions during winter. The work will be done between 2012 and 2014 and will cost 10 million Euros. Alstom will cover half of the expenses. The problematic couplers will be changed to allow trains to be coupled <b>on-the-fly</b> again at intermediate stations. Heaters will be installed in the trains' undercarriages to prevent the formation of ice during the winter. In addition to these modifications, the tilt angle of the bogies will be lowered from the current eight degrees. The operating speed of the train will remain the same. , new couplers have been installed in at least Sm3 units 7x12 and 7x18.|$|E
5|$|Cyan playtested {{the game}} with two people {{sitting in front of}} the game, finding that they would {{converse}} with each other and vocalize their likes and dislikes compared to one person silently playing. Rand and Robyn sat behind the testers taking notes, and could make <b>on-the-fly</b> changes and fixes. Cyan wanted the interface of the game to be invisible, and to craft a game that all kinds of people would enjoy. Early on they had decided that there would be no inventory, enemies, or ways to die; eventually they included a save system as a concession to the fact that it would take most players months to complete the game. Among the problems testers discovered with the story was that Myst initially had no inciting incident. In response, Cyan added a note from Atrus to Catherine that clued players into the existence of a chamber by the dock that played a message from Atrus and explained the game's objectives.|$|E

25|$|Other new {{features}} included its <b>on-the-fly</b> file encryption software with code signing and Keychain technologies, Remote Networking and File Server packages, and much improved list of USB drivers.|$|E
25|$|Dynamic DNS (DDNS) updates a DNS server with {{a client}} IP address <b>on-the-fly,</b> for example, when moving between ISPs or mobile hot spots, or when the IP address changes administratively.|$|E
25|$|In April 2008, TVNZ {{made another}} {{purchase}} of even more expensive Harmonic branded H.264 encoding {{equipment for the}} upcoming Freeview HD DTT service, which are the Electra 7000 for HD and Electra 5400 for SD <b>on-the-fly</b> video re-encoders.|$|E
25|$|Unlike FreeOTFE, FreeOTFE Explorer {{does not}} provide <b>on-the-fly</b> {{encryption}} through a virtual drive. Instead it lets files be stored and extracted from encrypted disk images, {{in a similar manner}} as ZIP and RAR archives, by using a Windows Explorer like interface.|$|E
25|$|The {{system allows}} for the GPU to {{directly}} read data produced by the CPU without going to main memory. In this specific case of data streaming, called Xbox procedural synthesis (XPS), the CPU is effectively a data decompressor, generating geometry <b>on-the-fly</b> for consumption by the GPU 3D core.|$|E
25|$|In late 1989, Kevin Calhoun, then a HyperCard {{engineer}} at Apple, led {{an effort to}} upgrade the program. This resulted in HyperCard 2.0, released in 1990. The new version included an <b>on-the-fly</b> compiler that greatly increased performance of computationally intensive code, a new debugger and many improvements to the underlying HyperTalk language.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to PBFT and UpRight, {{there is the}} BFT-SMaRt library, a high-performance Byzantine fault-tolerant state machine replication library developed in Java. This library implements a protocol very similar to PBFT's, plus complementary protocols which offer state transfer and <b>on-the-fly</b> reconfiguration of hosts. BFT-SMaRt is the most recent effort to implement state machine replication, still being actively maintained.|$|E
25|$|The Sequential window shows {{events in}} date-timestamp order, {{one or more}} other windows in various orders as the CVE works through the list of rules and creates implied {{relationships}} between the events. Various buttons and controls exist in the console application that enable the business analysts to create relationships between events <b>on-the-fly</b> and define rules that respond to these relationships.|$|E
25|$|FreeOTFE is a {{discontinued}} {{open source}} computer program for <b>on-the-fly</b> disk encryption (OTFE). On Microsoft Windows, and Windows Mobile (using FreeOTFE4PDA), it {{can create a}} virtual drive within a file or partition, to which anything written is automatically encrypted before being stored on a computer's hard or USB drive. It is similar in function to other disk encryption programs including TrueCrypt and Microsoft's BitLocker.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{three-dimensional}} graphics {{has become}} increasingly common in mainstream operating systems, from creating attractive interfaces, termed eye candy, to functional purposes only possible using three dimensions. For example, user switching is represented by rotating a cube which faces are each user's workspace, and window management is represented via a Rolodex-style flipping mechanism in Windows Vista (see Windows Flip 3D). In both cases, the operating system transforms windows <b>on-the-fly</b> while continuing to update the content of those windows.|$|E
25|$|The Burroughs/Unisys APLB {{interpreter}} (1982) was {{the first}} to use dynamic incremental compilation to produce code for an APL-specific virtual machine. It recompiled <b>on-the-fly</b> as identifiers changed their functional meanings. In addition to removing parsing and some error checking from the main execution path, such compilation also streamlines the repeated entry and exit of user-defined functional operands. This avoids the stack setup and take-down for function calls made by APL's built-in operators such as Reduce and Each.|$|E
25|$|With wide deployment(s) of flash drives {{being used}} in various environments (secured or otherwise), the issue of data and {{information}} security remains important. The use of biometrics and encryption is becoming the norm {{with the need for}} increased security for data; <b>on-the-fly</b> encryption systems are particularly useful in this regard, as they can transparently encrypt large amounts of data. In some cases a secure USB drive may use a hardware-based encryption mechanism that uses a hardware module instead of software for strongly encrypting data. IEEE 1667 is an attempt to create a generic authentication platform for USB drives. It is supported in Windows 7 and Windows Vista (Service Pack 2 with a hotfix).|$|E
25|$|Today, being drum major for the OSUMB {{is one of}} {{the hardest}} collegiate drum major {{positions}} to achieve in the country. It {{is one of the}} most physically and mentally challenging, and requires the utmost in flexibility, concentration, and <b>on-the-fly</b> thinking and creativity. Typically, there is only one Drum Major and one Assistant Drum Major for the season. The Assistant Drum Major will often wear a different uniform, representative of the uniform that the Drum Major of the OSU Military Band wore. The Military Band was a marching band run separately from the OSUMB that allowed woodwind instruments, and played at mainly ROTC parades and other campus events when the Marching Band was unable to perform or during the off-season of the Marching Band.|$|E
25|$|IBM-PC Emulation on the 8086-based Wang PC {{was working}} fairly {{reliably}} when IBM released their 80286-based PC-AT. Wang's answer was the 80286-based Wang APC (Advanced Professional Computer) {{which not only}} perpetuated the PC incompatibility at the hardware level but revealed an unexpected wrinkle in the hitherto successful PC emulation strategy: the 8086 decoded and executed instructions <b>on-the-fly</b> and was therefore {{able to respond to}} NMI on every instruction boundary, but the 80286 decoded and queued instructions in a pipeline whose depth varied with each CPU-mask stepping but which always prevented timely NMI execution. Wang's engineers came up with (and later patented) a rather devious instruction-prefetch monitor that managed to cope with that challenge at the expense of a modest performance penalty.|$|E
25|$|Systems as {{complicated}} as computers require very high reliability. ENIAC remained on, in continuous operation from 1947 to 1955, for eight years before being shut down. Although a vacuum tube might fail, it would be replaced without bringing down the system. By the simple strategy of never shutting down ENIAC, the failures were dramatically reduced. The vacuum-tube SAGE air-defense computers became remarkably reliable – installed in pairs, one off-line, tubes likely to fail did so when the computer was intentionally run at reduced power to find them. Hot-pluggable hard disks, like the hot-pluggable vacuum tubes of yesteryear, continue the tradition of repair during continuous operation. Semiconductor memories routinely have no errors when they operate, although operating systems like Unix have employed memory tests on start-up to detect failing hardware. Today, the requirement of reliable performance is made even more stringent when server farms are the delivery platform. Google has managed this by using fault-tolerant software to recover from hardware failures, and is even working {{on the concept of}} replacing entire server farms <b>on-the-fly,</b> during a service event.|$|E

In a comparison between the ZX81 and IBM PC published in Which Micro?, he commended the ZX81's user-friendliness and its <b>on-the-fly</b> syntax checking of BASIC programs, which he described as [...] "the feature that I, as a newcomer to computing, want to see incorporated into every micro." ...|$|E
500|$|The original, only {{complete}} and {{most widely used}} PHP implementation is powered by the Zend Engine and known simply as PHP. To disambiguate it from other implementations, it is sometimes unofficially referred to as [...] "Zend PHP". The Zend Engine compiles PHP source code <b>on-the-fly</b> into an internal format that it can execute, thus it works as an interpreter. It is also the [...] "reference implementation" [...] of PHP, as PHP has no formal specification, and so the semantics of Zend PHP define the semantics of PHP itself. Due to the complex and nuanced semantics of PHP, defined by how Zend works, {{it is difficult for}} competing implementations to offer complete compatibility.|$|E
500|$|Raposo {{was brought}} to Sesame Street by {{producer}} Tom Whedon, who was his friend and college roommate, and by Stone, {{who had worked with}} Raposo on other productions. [...] Stone found Raposo's music brilliant, melodic, and simple enough for children to recognize and sing with, but sophisticated. [...] According to writer Michael Davis, Sesame Street's signature sound grew out of sessions with a seven-piece band consisting of a keyboardist, drummer, electric bass player, guitarist, trumpeter, a winds instrumentalist, and a percussionist. One of these musicians was drummer Danny Epstein, who became the show's music coordinator in 1970 and performed for the show since its inception. [...] Stone reported that a typical recording session with Raposo, which would often last three days, was [...] "an <b>on-the-fly,</b> off-the-cuff experience".|$|E
500|$|The {{first season}} was {{received}} well by critics. Keith Uhlich of Salon magazine called {{the season and}} series [...] "Carter's greatest series", and that, [...] "television work always improves in retrospect; his seemingly haphazard, <b>on-the-fly</b> narratives become more coherent when {{taken out of the}} hellish, commercial break-happy context wherein they spawned". Paul Katz of Entertainment Weekly said, [...] "Despite the unapologetic bleakness" [...] of the show, it was Lance Henriksen performance that was the [...] "real killer". Mark Rahner from The Seattle Times said the [...] "X-Files follow-up was uncompromisingly grim, fascinating, cinematically crafted", and that the show was [...] "years ahead" [...] of such [...] "forensic mysteries" [...] as [...] USA Today writer Matt Roush said [...] "With nightmare visions of bleeding walls, charred bodies, decapitations and a grisly live burial", the show took a new [...] "grim view" [...] on [...] "drama".|$|E
500|$|The {{sessions}} for the album began with strife and tension. Bassist Jeff Ament wasn't made {{aware that the}} band was recording until three days into the sessions, {{and said that he}} [...] "wasn't super involved with that record on any level." [...] Guitarist Mike McCready said, [...] "I'm sure Jeff was pissed, but it was more about separating, because if we played all together nothing would get done. We'd all just get pissed off at each other." [...] At one point Ament even walked out of the recording sessions, and considered quitting the band due to lead vocalist Eddie Vedder's control of the creation process. Due to Pearl Jam balancing recording and touring, Irons commented that the band was [...] "more <b>on-the-fly</b> during the making of No Code, and some good things happened out of that, but we were also really tired. It was difficult to tour and play these shows that were two or three hours long and then force ourselves to produce something in a studio." ...|$|E
500|$|Compared to the {{original}} StarCraft, StarCraft II was designed to focus more heavily on the multiplayer aspect, with changes that include major improvements to Battle.net, a new competitive [...] "ladder" [...] system for ranked games, and new matchmaking mechanics {{that are designed to}} [...] "match-up" [...] players of equal skill level. In addition, the replay function, which allows players to record and review past games, was improved. Blizzard also stated that they incorporated changes to the game that were suggested by fans. StarCraft II continues its predecessor's use of pre-rendered cinematic cut scenes to advance the plot while also improving the quality of in-game cut scenes within the levels themselves, which are rendered <b>on-the-fly</b> using the same game engine as the graphics in the game proper. [...] Blizzard stated that, with the new graphics engine that StarCraft II uses to render the gameplay, they [...] "can actually create in-game cut-scenes of near-cinematic quality". [...] Improvements include advanced scenery allocation and more detailed space terrain, such as floating space platforms with planets and asteroids in the background. Small cliffs, extensions, and even advertising signs were also shown to have been improved and refined.|$|E
500|$|Live {{shows on}} Tool's {{headline}} tour incorporate an unorthodox stage setting and video display. Keenan and Carey {{line up in}} the back on elevated platforms, while Jones and Chancellor stand in the front, toward the sides of the stage. Keenan often faces the backdrop or the sides of the stage rather than the audience. No followspots or live cameras are used; instead, the band employs extensive backlighting to direct the focus away from the band members and toward large screens in the back and the crowd. Breckinridge Haggerty, the band's live video designer, says that the resulting dark spaces on stage [...] "are mostly for Maynard". He explains, [...] " [...] lot of the songs are a personal journey for him and he has a hard time with the glare of the lights when he's trying to reproduce these emotions for the audience. He needs a bit of personal space, and he feels more comfortable in the shadows." [...] The big screens are used to play back [...] "looped clips that aren't tracked to a song like a music video. The band has never used any sort of timecode. They’ve always made sure the video can change <b>on-the-fly,</b> in a way that can be improvised. ... The show is never the same twice." [...] During the 10,000 Days tour, the video material consisted of over six hours of material, created by Jones, his wife Camella Grace, Chet Zar, Meats Meier, and Haggerty. Some of the material created by Zar has been released on his DVD Disturb the Normal.|$|E
500|$|The {{game had}} {{received}} mainly positive reviews. Final Fantasy [...] Dimensions received an aggregated score of 78 on Metacritic based on 10 reviews and 74.43% on GameRankings based on seven reviews. Slide to Play {{gave it a}} perfect score of 4 out of 4 stating, [...] "Square Enix has made a truly masterful game here. The story is huge, the characters enjoyable and fun to play, and other than the iffy controls, the game works fantastically well on the touchscreen. The menus in particular are elegantly designed. The music and graphics are even great in creating a world that reminds us that {{the old and new}} can coexist, and do so with aplomb". Justin Davis of IGN criticized the episodic structure of the game however [...] "Players can't fully explore the game world until they're almost at the end – over 30 hours in!", however also praises the gameplay stating, [...] "What Dimensions lacks in scenario & story flexibility it makes up for with sheer depth and flexibility in its job system. Players can assign any party member to any available job <b>on-the-fly,</b> with more opening up as the story progresses." [...] Joe Juba of Game Informer praised the gameplay but criticized the lack of fanfare stating, [...] "Despite the fun job system and classic vibe to the combat, Dimensions seems like it was set up to fail. It released to little fanfare at a prohibitive price point for mobile games." [...] Tof Eklund of TouchArcade praised the games features stating, [...] "There's an epic, high fantasy plot with lots of twists, a large cast of characters whose appearance and abilities vary wildly, tons of random combat, lots of leveling-up and abilities to unlock, a gradual opening up of the world, secret items, bonus dungeons, and a lot of looking inside pots and barrels in order to pilfer the worldly goods of the townspeople you run across." [...] GamesTM praised the game for resembling previous Final Fantasy games.|$|E
