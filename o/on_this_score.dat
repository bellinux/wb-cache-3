According to Professor Stephen Railton of the University of Virginia, Twain was unable to fully rise above the stereotypes of black people that white readers of his era expected and enjoyed, and, therefore, resorted to minstrel show-style comedy to provide humor at Jim's expense, and ended up confirming rather than challenging late-19th century racist stereotypes.|$|E

The most important initial work <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>score</b> was Claude Lévi-Strauss's 1949 volume The Elementary Structures of Kinship. Lévi-Strauss had known Jakobson during their time together at the New School in New York during WWII and was influenced by both Jakobson's structuralism {{as well as the}} American anthropological tradition. In Elementary Structures he examined kinship systems from a structural point of view and demonstrated how apparently different social organizations were in fact different permutations of a few basic kinship structures. In the late 1950s he published Structural Anthropology, a collection of essays outlining his program for structuralism.|$|E

2500|$|The double slit experiment, {{like the}} other six {{idealized}} experiments (microscope, split beam, tilt-teeth, radiation pattern, one-photon polarization, and polarization of paired photons), imposes a choice between complementary modes of observation. In each experiment we {{have found a way}} to delay that choice of type of phenomenon to be looked for up to the very final stage of development of the phenomenon, and it depends on whichever type of detection device we then fix upon. That delay makes no difference in the experimental predictions. <b>On</b> <b>this</b> <b>score</b> everything we find was foreshadowed in that solitary and pregnant sentence of Bohr, [...] "...it...can make no difference, as regards observable effects obtainable by a definite experimental arrangement, whether our plans for constructing or handling the instruments are fixed beforehand or whether we prefer to postpone the completion of our planning until a later moment when the particle is already on its way from one instrument to another." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{approach}} and a new benchmark for video summarization. Thereby we focus on user videos, which are raw videos containing a set of interesting events. Our method starts by seg-menting the video by using a novel “superframe ” segmentation, tailored to raw videos. Then, we estimate visual interestingness per superframe using a set of low-, mid- and high-level features. Based <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>scoring,</b> we select an optimal subset of superframes to create an informative and interesting summary. The introduced benchmark comes with multiple human created summaries, which were acquired in a controlled psycho-logical experiment. This data paves the way to evaluate summarization methods objectively and to get new insights in video summarization. When evaluating our method, we find that it generates high-quality re-sults, comparable to manual, human-created summaries...|$|R

2500|$|An early American {{example is}} Harriet Beecher Stowe's anti-slavery novel Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852), The term thesis, or {{propaganda}} novel {{is also used}} for the latter novel, because it is [...] "strongly weighted to convert the reader to the author's stand" [...] {{on the subject of}} slavery. There is an apocryphal tale told that when Stowe met Abraham Lincoln in Washington in November 1862, the president greeted her by saying, [...] "So you are the little woman who wrote the book that started this great war." [...] Mark Twain's work Huckleberry Finn (1884) is another early American social protest novel. Much of modern scholarship of Huckleberry Finn has focused on its treatment of race.

[...] After moving the ball down the field, South Carolina attempted, and made, a 44-yard field goal with 10:17 remaining in the third quarter. [...] Florida responded with a drive that took less than four minutes and topped off with a 38-yard Jeff Demps rushing touchdown. [...] This was Jeff Demps' fifth rushing touchdown of the season and all of which were runs of more than 35 yards. [...] On the first play of the fourth quarter, Tim Tebow threw a TD pass to TE Aaron Hernandez, who controlled the catch with one hand, extending their lead 49-6. [...] On the following Gator offensive possession, redshirt freshman QB John Brantley took over for Tim Tebow to close out the game. [...] Florida's defense still did not let up. [...] True freshman Gator Will Hill picked off a Stephen Garcia pass attempt making it the third Gator interception of the game. [...] This turnover led to another Gator score when true freshman Chris Rainey put together two runs with the second being the touchdown score that put the Gators over the 50-point mark. [...] The Gators finished the game holding South Carolina's offense to 173 yards while the Gator offense amassed over 519 yards with 346 of those yards coming on the ground.|$|E
