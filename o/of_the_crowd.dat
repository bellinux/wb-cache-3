5|$|Due to {{the strong}} celebrity {{influence}} expected at the Indian Super League final {{it was reported that}} over 250 police officers would be in attendance at the stadium to maintain order <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd.</b> It was also reported that over 150 personnel would be brought in to man the streets outside the stadium.|$|E
30|$|To {{compensate}} for <b>the</b> lack <b>of</b> “wisdom” {{of an average}} <b>crowd</b> member, <b>the</b> platform often leverages <b>the</b> wisdom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowds</b> by, for example, instituting a “provision point mechanism” such that project creators will not receive funds unless the target investment is reached (Agrawal et al. 2013; Belleflamme and Lambert 2014). Crowdfunding platforms allow individual investors to leverage <b>the</b> wisdom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowds</b> through observational learning (Zhang and Liu 2012), by highlighting <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> existing investors and overall progress towards the funding goal (Ahlers et al. 2015). However, <b>the</b> wisdom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowds</b> {{is not without its}} limitations, as discussed in Pure <b>Crowds</b> and <b>the</b> Limitations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Wisdom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Crowds.</b>|$|R

30|$|Surowiecki (2004) {{suggests}} that <b>the</b> wisdom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowds</b> requires three key conditions: <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> must be diverse, its members must be independent, {{and it must}} have {{a particular kind of}} decentralization. To fully achieve <b>the</b> wisdom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowds,</b> a crowd should make independent decisions, free of predecessors’ investment decisions, cognitive bias, emotional hindrance, and psychological influence (Lin and Viswanathan 2015). However, in practical pure crowd designs, these assumptions are inevitably violated, raising questions about <b>the</b> efficiency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pure <b>crowd</b> design.|$|R
5|$|In {{the group}} of people {{gathered}} below the king, in another acknowledgement of the burghers' importance, is burgher Jan Kiliński (24), {{one of the leaders}} of the Kościuszko Uprising. To his right, at the edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd,</b> is the priest Clemens Maria Hofbauer (25), who ran an orphanage and a school in Warsaw and is canonized as a saint in the Catholic church.|$|E
5|$|Monday, 16 August 1819, {{was a hot}} summer's day, with a {{cloudless}} blue sky. The fine weather {{almost certainly}} increased the size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> significantly; marching from the outer townships {{in the cold and}} rain would have been a much less attractive prospect.|$|E
5|$|The 250 {{officers}} from Wandsworth Police lining the embankments {{were able to}} replace their traditional helmets for peaked caps for the first time, in order to discourage members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> from removing them and throwing them into the river. The race was sponsored for the tenth consecutive year by Beefeater Gin, and umpired by former Cambridge Blue Mike Sweeney.|$|E

5|$|The {{man holding}} up a sword is Hieronymus Jaroslaw Łaski, a diplomat and nephew of Archbishop Jan Łaski. Both men are shown {{to the right of}} the king, at the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd.</b> Jan is {{separated}} from Hieronymous by Bishop Tomicki. Hieronymous is holding the sword with which Albrecht will be knighted stiffly as a warning to the Prussian ruler.|$|E
5|$|The {{men of the}} 5th and 6th {{stayed at}} the depot {{throughout}} the night and into the next morning. If any individual needed to leave, they did so in civilian clothes and unarmed, for fear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> should they be discovered {{to be a member}} of the militia. Camden Street remained under constant guard by 16 sentinels. They served in two-hour shifts, with four-hours' rest in between.|$|E
5|$|A video {{album was}} {{released}} {{for the special}} and includes extra footage like a capella performances and photo gallery. The 5.1 surround sound of the release utilized DTS-HD Master Audio and new technology to provide the viewer an optimum experience of watching the live concert. Emphasis was given on the main music and the vocals sung during the concert, while adjusting them against the screaming and the cheering <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd.</b> The release was a commercial success, reaching {{the top of the}} DVD charts in the United States, France and Italy and the top-ten in other nations. It received double platinum certifications in Australia and France, while in the United Kingdom, it was certified gold.|$|E

5|$|As {{the torch}} bearer {{approaches}} the Olympic Stadium he collapses, and the Doctor promptly and suddenly appears, {{picks up the}} torch, and completes the run to light the Olympic Flame. The heat of the flame and the emotion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> power the pod, allowing the Isolus to leave Chloe and return home. The Doctor and Rose walk off to watch the games, and Rose remarks that nothing will ever split {{the two of them}} up. The Doctor becomes uneasy and muses that a storm is approaching.|$|E
5|$|At about noon, {{several hundred}} special constables were led onto the field. They formed two {{lines in the}} crowd a few yards apart, {{in an attempt to}} form a {{corridor}} through the crowd between the house where the magistrates were watching and the hustings, two waggons lashed together. Believing that this might be intended as the route by which the magistrates would later send their representatives to arrest the speakers, some members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> pushed the waggons away from the constables, and pressed around the hustings to form a human barrier.|$|E

5|$|At {{about six}} {{o'clock in the}} morning, some of the protesters {{discovered}} a small gate to the palace was unguarded. Making their way inside, they searched for the queen's bedchamber. The royal guards raced throughout the palace, bolting doors and barricading hallways {{and those in the}} compromised sector, the cour de marbre, fired their guns at the intruders, killing a young member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd.</b> Infuriated, the rest surged towards the breach and streamed inside.|$|E
5|$|At the US Open, Del Potro {{defeated}} Henri Laaksonen, Adrián Menéndez-Maceiras and Roberto Bautista Agut {{in straight}} sets, putting his best year performance to date against Bautista Agut. He began his fourth round match against Dominic Thiem greatly struggling, falling 1-6, 2-6 behind. However, he then raised his level and, {{with the help}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd,</b> he eventually prevailed in five sets, including saving two match points in the fourth set with two aces. In the post match interview he admitted he considered retiring from the match during the second set.|$|E
5|$|At the foundry {{near the}} Carey Street Bridge, {{a crowd of}} more than 100 {{gathered}} and threatened to {{set fire to the}} area. A contingent of the 5th under Captain Lipscomb arrived, and a volley fired over the heads <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> was sufficient to dissuade the crowd. An unsuccessful attempt was also made to burn a B transportation barge at Fell's Point. The news reported that 16 were arrested in a confrontation between citizens and the police at Lee and Eutaw, and that during the night, three separate attempts were made to set fire the 6th Regiment armory, but all were frustrated by the remaining garrison there.|$|E

5|$|Betances' remains {{arrived in}} San Juan, Puerto Rico on August 5, 1920, and were honored upon arrival by a crowd then {{estimated}} at 20,000 mourners. The large crowd, which had assembled near {{the port of}} San Juan as early as 4:00a.m. (AST) that morning, was the largest ever assembled for a funeral in Puerto Rico {{since the death of}} Luis Muñoz Rivera three years earlier. Media reporters of the day were surprised by the size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd,</b> given the fact that Betances had not visited Puerto Rico (at least in the open) for the 31 years before his death, and had been dead over 21 years afterwards.|$|E

The historic occasion for Bradford {{was reflected in the}} ticket sales, with City fans outnumbering their opponents nearly three-to-one with 28,000 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> of 39,972 coming from Bradford.|$|E
5|$|During this {{stint in}} Florida, LeDuc made a scripted turn from face to heel. Garvin claimed that LeDuc was aligned with heel manager Sonny King, but LeDuc denied the claim. Garvin then showed video footage {{to prove that}} LeDuc had secret {{dealings}} with King. LeDuc responded by attacking Garvin in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd,</b> solidifying a heel turn for LeDuc. In a storyline several months later, LeDuc and King Curtis Iaukea attacked Buddy Rogers, a veteran then working as a face. The injuries Rogers received {{were said to be}} so severe that he was forced to retire, although, in reality, Rogers had simply moved to another wrestling promotion.|$|E
