40|$|Introduction: Australian Government {{initiatives}} promote rural training placements, supported {{medical school}} places, and incentives that attract doctors to areas of need. The {{purpose of this}} study was to report on the preparedness of medical students and junior doctors to commit to working in areas of workforce shortage. Methods: Medical students and junior doctors across all Australian states and territories completed a web-based survey assessing career attitudes and intentions. Participants were asked to indicate their level of preparedness to commit to working in an area of need. Results: Completed surveys were received from 760 medical students and 264 junior doctors. A substantial proportion of this sample were prepared to make some form <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> to providing medical services in a rural area. The greatest proportion (38. 3 %) was prepared to make a small commitment equal to an irregular locum service of 1 week or 1 month per year. Conclusion: Government policies and incentives may be having an effect on medical students' and junior doctors' preparedness to work in rural and remote areas. Medical educators should encourage students and junior doctors to take up short-term placements/opportunities and to maintain links with rural communities. Practice opportunities that <b>offer</b> varying lengths <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> should be advertised widely so junior doctors are aware of them and can apply.

40|$|I am {{on record}} as objecting {{to many of the}} claims made in recent years about the use of {{argument}} schemes (see Pinto 2001, chapters 10 - 12). At the same time, I have endorsed the idea that schemes and the critical questions associated with them are a valuable component of our critical practice (Pinto 2001, 124). As a result, I find myself particularly interested in the suggestions Reed and Walton (henceforth, R&W) make in this paper about the possible uses of argument schemes. They discuss the use of schemes in four areas: (1) the reconstruction of arguments (2) the determination of dialectical relevance (3) the generation of arguments to defend commitments (4) the generation of responses to arguments that have been <b>offered</b> in defense <b>of</b> <b>commitments.</b> I’m skeptical about the claims that R&W appear to make about the use of schemes in areas (1) and (2), but I’m quite intrigued by their suggestions about the use schemes in areas (3) and (4). In this response, I must limit myself to a few observations about two matters...|$|R

This doctoral dissertation proposes a bottom-up model of the Russian electricity sector that enables the study of the behaviour of short-term electricity market prices and revenues of electric producers in Russia under conditions of limited information about parameters and operational constraints of the actual electricity market. The modelling procedure covers identification of unobserved parameters of the Russian electricity system using available historical market data, modelling <b>of</b> generators’ <b>offers,</b> simulation <b>of</b> unit <b>commitment</b> and day-ahead energy market operation, and conducting a sensitivity analysis of the model results. The use of the developed market model is demonstrated by its application to study the impacts of the real-life market design and regulatory changes on profits of generators obtained from the day-ahead energy market in Russia...|$|R

5|$|Ilya Salkind {{had first}} {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} a Superman film in late 1973. In November 1974, after a long, difficult process with DC Comics, the Superman film rights were purchased by Ilya, his father Alexander Salkind, and their partner Pierre Spengler. DC wanted a list of actors that were to be considered for Superman, and approved the producer's choices of Muhammad Ali, Al Pacino, James Caan, Steve McQueen, Clint Eastwood and Dustin Hoffman. The filmmakers felt it was best to film Superman and Superman II back-to-back, simultaneously, and to make a negative pickup deal with Warner Bros. William Goldman was approached to write the screenplay, while Leigh Brackett was considered. Ilya hired Alfred Bester, who began writing a film treatment. Alexander felt, however, that Bester was not famous enough, so he hired Mario Puzo (The Godfather) to write the screenplay at a $600,000 salary. Francis Ford Coppola, William Friedkin, Richard Lester, Peter Yates, John Guillermin, Ronald Neame and Sam Peckinpah were in negotiations to direct. Peckinpah dropped out when he produced a gun during a meeting with Ilya. George Lucas turned down the <b>offer</b> because <b>of</b> his <b>commitment</b> to Star Wars.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{extends the}} {{standard}} model of self-enforcing dynamic international environmental agreements by allowing {{the length of the}} period <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>of</b> such agreements to vary as a parameter. It analyzes the pattern of behavior of the size of stable coalitions, the stock of pollutant and the emission rate {{as a function of the}} length of the period <b>of</b> <b>commitment.</b> It is shown that the length of the period <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> can have very significant effects on the equilibrium. Three distinct intervals for the length of the period <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> are identified, across which the equilibrium and its dynamic behavior differ considerably. Whereas for sufficiently high values of the period <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> only self-enforcing agreements of two countries are possible, for sufficiently low such values full cooperation can be generated. Lengths <b>of</b> periods <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> between those two thresholds are characterized by an inverse relationship between the length <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> and the membership size of the agreement. This suggests that considerable attention should be given to the determination of the length of such international agreements.

40|$|Background Treatment {{for tobacco}} {{dependence}} {{is not available}} in many low-resource settings, especially in developing countries. Purpose To test {{the impact of a}} novel mix of monetary and social incentives on smoking abstinence in rural communities of Thailand. Design An RCT <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> contracts and team incentives for rural smokers to quit smoking. Smokers were not blinded to treatment status, although the assessor of the biochemical urine test was. Setting/participants All adult smokers living in the study area were eligible to participate; 215 adult smokers from 42 villages in Nakhon Nayok province, Thailand, participated. Fourteen smokers who lacked teammates were dropped. Intervention A total of 201 smokers were assigned to a two-person team, and then randomly assigned by team (in a 2 : 1 ratio) with computer-generated random numbers to receive smoking-cessation counseling (control group) or counseling plus <b>offer</b> <b>of</b> a <b>commitment</b> contract, team incentives, and text message reminders for smoking cessation at 3 months (intervention group). Main outcome measures The primary outcome was biochemically verified 7 -day abstinence at 6 months, assessed on an intention-to-treat basis. Secondary outcomes include study participation, biochemically verified abstinence at 3 months, self-reported abstinence at 14 months, and the incremental cost per quitter of the intervention, nicotine gum, and varenicline in Thailand. Data were collected in 2010 - 2011 and analyzed in 2012. Results The trial enrolled 215 (10. 5 %) of 2055 smokers. The abstinence rate was 46. 2 % (61 / 132) in the intervention group and 14. 5 % (10 / 69) in the control group (adjusted OR 7. 5 [3. 0 - 18. 6]) at 3 months; 44. 3 % (58 / 131) and 18. 8 % (13 / 69) at the primary end point of 6 months (adjusted OR 4. 2 [1. 8 - 9. 7]); and 42. 0 % (55 / 131) and 24. 6 % (17 / 69) at 14 months (adjusted OR 2. 2 [1. 0 - 4. 8]). The purchasing power parity-adjusted incremental cost per quitter from the intervention is $ 281 (95 % CI=$ 187, $ 562), less than for nicotine gum ($ 1780, 95 % CI=$ 1414, $ 2401) or varenicline ($ 2073, 95 % CI=$ 1357, $ 4388) in Thailand. Conclusions The intervention enhanced abstinence by 91 %- 136 % at 6 months, relative to the control group, although self-reports at 14 months suggest tapering of the treatment effect. The intervention may offer a viable, cost-effective alternative to current smoking-cessation approaches in low-resource settings.
