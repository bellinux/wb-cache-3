25|$|Christians {{believe that}} the Holy Spirit gives 'gifts' to Christians. These gifts consist of {{specific}} abilities granted to the individual Christian. They are frequently known by the Greek word for gift, Charisma, from which the term charismatic derives. The New Testament provides three different lists of such gifts which range from the supernatural (healing, prophecy, tongues) through those associated with specific callings (teaching) to those expected of all Christians in some degree (faith). Most consider these lists not to be exhaustive, and other have compiled their own lists. Saint Ambrose wrote of the Seven Gifts <b>of</b> the Holy <b>Spirit</b> poured out on a believer at baptism: 1. <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> Wisdom; 2. <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> Understanding; 3. <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> Counsel; 4. <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> Strength; 5. <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> Knowledge; 6. <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> Godliness; 7. <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> Holy Fear.|$|R

5|$|Among the Fundamental Truths was a {{statement}} regarding speaking in tongues as the initial physical evidence <b>of</b> <b>Spirit</b> baptism. Its inclusion was challenged by F.F. Bosworth, an executive presbyter, who argued that while for many speaking in tongues was an evidence of the baptism {{it was not the}} only evidence. The issue was decided at the General Council of September 1918 where Bosworth, who two months earlier had resigned so as not to damage the fellowship, was present and invited to address the council. Following debate two resolutions were passed which assured that initial evidence would remain an official teaching of the fellowship.|$|E
5|$|Harry Randall Truman (October 30, 1896 â€“ May 18, 1980) was a {{resident}} of the U.S. state of Washington who lived on Mount St. Helens. He came to brief fame in the months preceding the volcano's 1980 eruption after he stubbornly refused to leave his home despite evacuation orders, and he is presumed to {{have been killed in the}} eruption. He was the owner and caretaker of Mount St. Helens Lodge at Spirit Lake, located at the south end <b>of</b> <b>Spirit</b> Lake at the foot of the mountain in the danger zone at the time of the eruption.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1890s, R.C. Horner, a Canadian holiness evangelist, {{introduced}} a theological distinction {{that would be}} important {{for the development of}} Pentecostalism. He argued in his books Pentecost (1891) and Bible Doctrines (1909) that the baptism in the Holy Spirit was not synonymous with the second blessing but was actually a third work of grace subsequent to salvation and sanctification that empowered the believer for service. Charles Fox Parham would build on this doctrinal foundation when he identified speaking in tongues as the Bible evidence <b>of</b> <b>Spirit</b> baptism.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To describe, evaluate, {{and suggest}} interpretations for an {{observed}} aggregate-level relation between trends in mortality from cirrhosis and {{per capita consumption}} <b>of</b> distilled <b>spirits</b> in the United States. DESIGN: Trend analysis using data on US cirrhosis mortality and per capita alcohol consumption. RESULTS: There is a consistent long-term trend relation between mortality from cirrhosis and per capita consumption <b>of</b> distilled <b>spirits</b> in the United States from 1949 to 1994. Two instances of comparatively sharp drops in the consumption <b>of</b> <b>spirits</b> in the 1940 s generated mixed results in predicting changes in cirrhosis mortality. CONCLUSIONS: An aggregate-level relation between trends in long-term cirrhosis mortality and the consumption <b>of</b> <b>spirits</b> falls considerably short of establishing a direct causal link between the two for individuals. Moreover, two sharp drops in the consumption <b>of</b> <b>spirits</b> generated only mixed results {{with respect to the}} short-term trend in cirrhosis. Nevertheless, the observed relation between the consumption <b>of</b> <b>spirits</b> and cirrhosis mortality merits further investigation...|$|R

5|$|Upon {{the release}} <b>of</b> <b>Spirit</b> in November 2007, the song peaked at number 160 on the UK Singles Chart due to strong digital {{download}} sales. It was released for US Contemporary hit radio airplay on 6 January 2009. Throughout January to March 2009, {{it also made}} {{an impact on the}} Canadian and United States charts; in the former it peaked at number 83, while it peaked at number 66 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the latter. However, it was more successful on the US Adult Pop Songs and Pop Songs charts, peaking at numbers 23 and 24, respectively. As part of promotion, a music video was shot in New York City and featured Chace Crawford as Lewis's love interest. In January 2009, she performed the song on the Late Show with David Letterman.|$|E
5|$|A new Zelda {{title was}} first hinted at in April 2008, when Miyamoto {{stated that the}} Zelda {{development}} team were reforming to create new games. Miyamoto later confirmed at the 2008 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) that a new Zelda was in development for the Wii. The game was officially unveiled at E3 2009, although its official title remained unknown. Due to its in-development state, Miyamoto could not show off gameplay as he had wished. Instead, he showed promotional art featuring Link and Fi. He also announced the game's use of Wii MotionPlus, along with its planned 2010 release window. In a later interview, Aonuma's comments on the game's playability brought this release window into doubt. He also noted that his wish {{to focus on the}} new game meant that the release date <b>of</b> <b>Spirit</b> Tracks was shifted to the end of 2009 rather than its initial projected release in early 2010. The game's official title was announced at the event, along with its revised release period in 2011 and a playable demonstration. According to Miyamoto, the game was delayed from its planned 2010 release window as the staff felt that they would be releasing an unfinished product if they put the convenience of the company ahead of creating a quality experience. They used the extra year to both finish the core elements and polish up the game as a whole.|$|E

5|$|In 1869 Dunford House was let. Catherine and {{her four}} younger daughters {{moved to a}} house in South Kensingtonâ€”the eldest, Kate, had married in 1866. The mÃ©nage proved unsatisfactory; Ellen, Jane and Anne were now {{displaying}} considerable independence <b>of</b> <b>spirit,</b> and differences of opinion arose between mother and daughters. Catherine moved out, taking the youngest daughter Lucy, and went to Wales where she lived until her death in 1877. In South Kensington, Ellen, Jane and Anne, often joined by Kate, established a sisterhood determined both to preserve Richard Cobden's memory and works and to uphold his principles and radical causes by actions of their own. Together they stopped publication of a memoir of their father, sponsored by his former colleagues and compiled by a family friend, Julie Salis Schwabe. This caused some offence; Schwabe had given the family financial and emotional support after Richard's death. However, Jane in particular wanted a more substantial memorial, and secured the services of John Morley, whose biography of Richard Cobden was published in 1881.|$|E
