The book 2 Esdras, a non-canonical book attributed to Babylonian captivity, associates a near-divine or angelic status to Ezra. Mark Lidzbarski and Michael Lodahl have also hypothesized existence of an Arabian Jewish sect whose veneration of Ezra bordered on deification.|$|E

5|$|Edward {{was born}} at Windsor Castle on 13 November 1312, and was often {{referred}} to as Edward of Windsor in his early years. The reign of his father, EdwardII, was a particularly problematic period of English history.

Another controversial issue was the king's exclusive patronage <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>group</b> of royal favourites. The birth of a male heir in 1312 temporarily improved EdwardII's position in relation to the baronial opposition. To bolster further the independent prestige of the young prince, the king had him created Earl of Chester at only twelve days of age.|$|E
