This paper identifies constraints on and opportunities for CDM project development in PICs, and proposes a range of specific policy reform measures that could alter existing negative investment profiles. Key findings are that small-scale agricultural projects providing renewable energy from existing sources of biomass (currently seen as waste) are ideal candidates for CDM investment in PICs, and that the single most important reform to facilitate CDM activity and contribute to achieving the MDGs would be the implementation of a regional approach to CDM administration, in which a regional body became the designated CDM Authority for all states in the region.

40|$|Carbon offset {{projects}} {{are an important}} component of international efforts to address climate change under the Kyoto Protocol. Nonetheless, their contribution to the transfer of technology and sustainable development benefi ts to poor countries is the subject of considerable debate. Among the reforms that have been proposed to address these concerns is the introduction of policies whereby offset projects would receive tradable credits for {{only a fraction of the}} emissions that they actually reduce. A system of partial crediting, it has been argued, could be used to direct investment toward particular project types and locations while producing additional atmospheric benefi t. At last year’s research conference, the author presented the results of a theoretical investigation of partial crediting that used mathematical analysis to test for the existence of optimal rates of partial crediting. In this year’s presentation, the author will discuss the results the next steps of that research: an empirical analysis of partial crediting policies using global abatement data and non-linear mathematical optimisation techniques. The author used submissions to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to define a set of 19 policies that represented various arguments about if and how partial crediting should be used. The author then simulated the equilibrium outcomes of each policy with regard to investment decisions in the global carbon market and used multi-criteria analysis to compare and rank the outcomes. The results were revealing. When multiple criteria including costs, sustainable development outcomes, investment in Least Developed Countries, and atmospheric benefi ts were considered together, the policies that performed the worst were the former and current European Union policies for carbon offset use.

40|$|In {{states without}} robust {{democratic}} institutions, public resources are often allocated {{on the basis}} of patronage. This distribution of patronage, along with the manipulation of official institutions (such as electoral systems and the judiciary) and the deployment of the coercive arms of the state provided the formula for authoritarian longevity in the Arab World. However, much regional scholarship continues to focus on the process through which patronage is distributed with little reference to how the underlying resources accrue to Arab regimes in the first place. Such studies fail to interrogate the organizational and financial interests of the external institutions (such as oil markets and aid organizations) that mediate this transfer of resources, and how those interests shape methods and patterns of resource distribution within Arab States. This paper is an attempt to identify some of these institutions and patterns by focusing on the array of patronage resources made available through the arms purchases executed by regional governments. The specific class of resources examined here is reciprocal investment contracts that U. S. defense firms negotiate with procuring country governments in order to facilitate arms sales, known in industry parlance as `defense offsets. ' Procuring states design their own offset policies, including the amount of investment that foreign arms manufacturers are required to make and the domestic enterprises where those funds must be allocated. The procuring state's discretion over the process allows us to draw some conclusions about how these governments distribute <b>offset</b> <b>investment</b> to strengthen incumbents' patronage-based support networks. This analysis also reveals how U. S. defense firms are able to influence the negotiation process in order to secure their own financial benefits. By examining how defense firms and their customers in the Middle East collude to structure weapons contracts in order to generate offset agreements that are mutually beneficial, we {{gain a better understanding of}} how patronage politics operates in the contemporary regional context. We are likewise alerted to the subtle ways in which influential external actors can insinuate their own interests into the process, and how the interactions between these groups create ever-evolving new opportunities for patronage politics...|$|E

In such cases, investors, governments, {{or even a}} company's own standards increasingly require implementation of biodiversity <b>offsets</b> (<b>investment</b> in conservation with a measurable outcome) {{with the aim of}} achieving 'no net loss' or even a 'net gain' of biodiversity. Where conservation is achieved by changing the behaviour of people directly using natural resources, the offset might be expected to have social impacts but such impacts have received very little attention. Using the case study of Ambatovy, a major nickel mine in the eastern rainforests of Madagascar and a company at the vanguard of developing biodiversity offsets, we explore local perceptions of the magnitude and distribution of impacts of the biodiversity offset project on local wellbeing. We used both qualitative (key informant interviews and focus group discussions) and quantitative (household survey) methods. We found that the biodiversity offsets, which comprise both conservation restrictions and development activities, influenced wellbeing in a mixture of positive and negative ways. However, overall, respondents felt that they had suffered a net cost from the biodiversity offset. It is a matter of concern that benefits from development activities do not compensate for the costs of the conservation restrictions, that those who bear the costs are not the same people as those who benefit, {{and that there is a}} mismatch in timing between the immediate restrictions and the associated development activities which take some time to deliver benefits.

40|$|AbstractIntroduction. One of the {{barriers}} to meeting Millennium Development Goal Number 4 is access for large populations of developing countries to vaccines against their most serious and common diseases. Innovative vaccines have been more readily available at affordable prices once more producers enter the market, but this means {{that there will be}} a delay in access until these manufacturers can access the technology. Several solutions to enhance access have been proposed; none so far is optimal. Methods. The factors relating to competition in the market and an affordable price were examined. Historical price data to countries were reviewed. Various explanations for lack of competition were also analyzed, including unequal access to financing, lack of optimal research and development capacity, barriers to technology transfer, issues in accessibility to intellectual property. Results. Differences in vaccine scale up, know-how, GMP practices and regulatory oversight are decreasing between emerging suppliers and established multinationals. Developing country vaccine prices are at about the same levels for all manufacturers, but the level of vaccine development is lower for emerging suppliers who have few high priced markets to <b>offset</b> <b>investments.</b> There appear to be three major differences between multinational manufacturers and emerging suppliers:(1) limited access to research results that lead to new vaccine constructs;(2) barriers to vaccine technology development relating to blocking intellectual property;(3) inability to spread the investments that would be incurred in addressing issues (1) and (2) over a large enough financial base. In terms of pricing, experience with early adopting countries has shown that other factors may overcome the perceived pricing barrier: that is, willingness to pay appears not to correlate with country wealth. Conclusions. Based on these analyses it appears that the interventions of the international community might be better directed to achieve vaccine access...|$|R

Before trade liberalization, the sector productivity and the competition intensity is higher in this country. However, when trade liberalization occurs, fiercer competition can more than <b>offset</b> the <b>investment</b> advantage. Hence, firms from the disadvantaged country may invest relatively more in R&D than firms from the advantaged country.
