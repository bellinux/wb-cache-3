25|$|The archetypical {{selection}} process {{for entry into}} a collegiate secret society began at Yale University by a process called tapping. On a publicly announced evening, Yale undergraduates would assemble informally in the College Yard. Current members of Yale's secret societies would walk {{through the crowd and}} literally tap a prospective member <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> then walk with him up to the tapped man's dorm room. There, in private, they would ask him to become a member of their secret society; the inductee had the choice of accepting or rejecting the offer of membership. During this process, it was publicly known who was being tapped for the coming year. Today, the {{selection process}} is not quite as formal, but is still public. Formal tapping days used to exist at Berkeley, and still exist in a much more formal setting at Missouri.|$|E

500|$|The {{contest between}} St-Pierre and Penn {{was a source}} of {{significant}} controversy. In between rounds one and two, as well as round three, one of St-Pierre's cornermen, Phil Nurse, was seen applying petroleum jelly (brand name Vaseline) <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> the back of St-Pierre by members of the Nevada State Athletic Commission (NSAC). Vaseline is used to aid cuts in boxing as well as MMA, but applying it to parts of the body other than the face is illegal because of the element of grappling in the sport. A fighter that is [...] "slippery" [...] {{as a result of the}} vaseline will have an added advantage, because friction and grip are compromised. UFC President Dana White addressed the issue during a radio appearance in Boston, Massachusetts. He indicated that he did not believe the vaseline influenced the outcome of the fight, but still expected Nurse to be punished.|$|E

500|$|Hutton was {{selected}} for the first Test, but England were overwhelmed by the Australian fast bowlers and lost the match. After a failure in the first innings, Hutton scored 74 in the second, and briefly established dominance over Miller, who responded {{with a series of}} bouncers, one of which struck Hutton <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> provoked an angry reaction from the crowd. Miller [...] him in very poor light {{at the start of the}} fourth day's play. At Lord's in the second Test, also lost by England, Hutton scored 20 and 13, but of more concern to critics was the manner in which he batted. In the second innings, England had to bat for a long time to save the game, Wisden noted that Hutton, in contrast to his opening partner Washbrook, looked [...] "plainly uncomfortable". He was nearly dismissed several times before he was out for 13, and returned to the pavilion to an uncomfortable silence from the crowd. The former Australian batsman Jack Fingleton, covering the tour as a journalist, described it as Hutton's worst effort in a Test. Bill O'Reilly, another former Australian player working as a journalist, said Hutton seemed to be struggling with concentration and was a shadow of his former self.|$|E

2500|$|Already drunk {{before he}} got to the Emerson Hotel that night, the 6'2" [...] Zantzinger had {{assaulted}} employees at Eager House, a prestigious Baltimore restaurant, with the same cane. The cane was a 25-cent toy. At the Spinsters' Ball, he called a 30-year-old waitress a [...] "nigger" [...] and hit her with the cane; she fled the room in tears. Moments later, after ordering a bourbon that Carroll did not bring immediately, Zantzinger cursed her, called her a [...] "nigger", then [...] "you black son of a bitch", and struck her <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> across the head with the cane. In the words of the court notes: [...] "He asked for a drink and called her 'a black bitch', and 'black s.o.b'. She replied, 'Just a moment' and started to prepare his drink. After a delay of perhaps a minute, he complained about her being slow and struck her a hard blow on her shoulder about half-way between the point of her shoulder and her neck." [...] She handed him his drink. After striking Carroll, he attacked his own wife, knocking her to the ground and hitting her with his shoe.|$|E
2500|$|A man {{who flew}} with him {{claimed that he}} would often [...] "give" [...] a victory to a new, green pilot, just to bolster his confidence. The new pilot would be taken out by the renowned Collishaw to [...] "bag one". Anxiously {{following}} the leader, he would find himself diving on {{the tail of a}} German reconnaissance plane. Trying to control the machine, so that the nose would stay still, he would find his gun-sight wobbling all over the sky. He would press the firing button, spraying bullets like a lawn sprinkler. Then suddenly Collishaw would appear alongside; there would be a short, deadly burst, and the new pilot would turn sick as he saw the enemy plane catch fire and plunge to earth. He would fly back to the aerodrome, where the flight commander would clap him heartily <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> insist [...] "You got one! Grand show, old boy!" [...] The new pilot, unable to speak, would nod timidly, and thereafter he would fly into battle with Collishaw anywhere. That was – according to the story – part of Collishaw's great quality of leadership.|$|E
2500|$|According to Feigl (as {{reported}} by Monk), upon attending {{a conference in}} Vienna by [...] mathematician Brouwer, Wittgenstein remained quite impressed, taking into consideration the [...] possibility of a [...] "return to Philosophy". At the urging of Ramsey and others, Wittgenstein returned to Cambridge in 1929. Keynes {{wrote in a letter}} to his wife: [...] "Well, God has arrived. I met him on the 5.15 train." [...] Despite this fame, he could not initially work at Cambridge as he did not have a degree, so he applied as an advanced undergraduate. Russell noted that his previous residency was sufficient to fulfill eligibility requirements for a PhD, and urged him to offer the Tractatus as his thesis. It was examined in 1929 by Russell and Moore; at the end of the thesis defence, Wittgenstein clapped the two examiners <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> said, [...] "Don't worry, I know you'll never understand it." [...] Moore wrote in the examiner's report: [...] "I myself consider that this is a work of genius; but, even if I am completely mistaken and it is nothing of the sort, it is well above the standard required for the Ph.D. degree." [...] Wittgenstein was appointed as a lecturer and was made a fellow of Trinity College.|$|E

2500|$|In the Middle-earth storyverse, Hobbits are [...] tall, Dwarves are taller {{at about}} , and Men and Elves are average human height, about [...] However, the films used two scale sets instead of three by casting taller than average actors to play Dwarves, then {{combining}} Dwarves and Hobbits into one size scale. For example, John Rhys-Davies, who played Gimli, is taller than Elijah Wood, who played Frodo. Thus in the ending {{shot of the}} Council of Elrond scene when all nine members of the Fellowship of the Ring are standing together, Rhys-Davies and the four Hobbit actors were filmed all at once, then the human-sized characters (Gandalf, Aragorn, Boromir, Legolas) were filmed in a second take, then the two shots were composited at different scale to make one image, with the initial Dwarf/Hobbit character shot made smaller. A practical upshot of not creating a third scale for Dwarves {{is that in a}} scene in which only Dwarves and Hobbits interact, no scale doubles are needed. For example, when they are entering Lothlórien {{for the first time and}} Gimli claps Frodo <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> says [...] "stay close, young hobbits", the entire scene employs no size doubles, because Rhys-Davies is naturally the proportionately taller height needed between Dwarves and Hobbits.|$|E

Ken Tucker's review shortly after the show's debut awarded it a B+; he stated the show's writing wasn't [...] "top-notch", but [...] "Romano manages to {{communicate}} something distinctive." [...] A 1997 review by Bruce Fretts, which gave the show the same score, said that the show [...] "may now be the best sitcom on the air." [...] Common Sense Media's Betsy Wallace, who awarded the show {{four out of five}} stars, wrote: [...] "the cast is stellar and plotlines shed light on universal human insecurities, such as doubting that your spouse still finds you attractive as you grow older." [...] However, she warned that the show's [...] "intimacy issues of married couples -- including (in)frequency of sex -- often take center stage," [...] as well as the show's mild language. Plugged In said in their review, [...] "Seven years and a mantle full of Emmys later, Raymond is still smartly scripted, now with new characters added to a maturing, expanding family." [...] In 2013, Complex ranked the show as 49th of [...] "The 50 Funniest TV Comedies of All Time", with writer Matt Barone saying that [...] "You'd want to pat Ray <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> say, 'We feel for you, man,' if you weren't laughing so hard."
