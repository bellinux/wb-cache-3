25|$|Characters on {{reaching}} Level 15 {{can purchase}} {{a house in}} instanced neighborhoods. Neighbourhoods and houses have different themes depending on setting (there are four settings: Man, Elf, Dwarf, Hobbit). Decorations/furniture may be purchased or acquired as rewards in certain in-game activities such as quests, deeds or festivals. The items are displayed via item hooks and may be either cosmetic or functional. Houses come in three different sizes and include chests for additional player storage. Houses require weekly maintenance rent (using in-game currency) with houses locked <b>on</b> <b>failure</b> to pay upkeep. The largest size house is reserved for kinships (player guilds). Players can own one personal house per server, and restrict the level of access to himself only, kinship members, or make it publicly accessible.|$|E

25|$|The program's focus <b>on</b> <b>failure</b> {{and those}} {{at the bottom of}} the social scale is pronounced, very much in {{contrast}} to Bochco's later project L.A. Law. Inspired by police procedural detective novels such as Ed McBain's 1956 Cop Hater, the show has been described as Barney Miller out of doors; the focus on the bitter realities of 1980s urban living was revolutionary for its time (later seasons were accused of becoming formulaic). Some trace the origins of this shift to the death of Michael Conrad (Sgt. Phil Esterhaus) midway through season four, leading to the replacement of the beloved Sgt. Esterhaus by Sgt. Stan Jablonski, played by Robert Prosky. In this respect, the series that broke the established rules of television could be said to have ultimately failed to break its own rules. Nonetheless, it is a landmark piece of television programming, the influence of which was seen in such series as NYPD Blue and ER. In 1982, St. Elsewhere was hyped as Hill Street Blues in a hospital. The quality work done by MTM led to the appointment of Grant Tinker as NBC chairman in 1982.|$|E
500|$|The French {{expression}} , {{which is}} the equivalent of [...] "a promise is a promise" [...] in English, and to which Chose Promise responds, dates from the 17th century. After his first show Réflexions profondes sur pas mal de trucs (Profound reflections on quite a few things), written with Arnaud Joyet and inspired by a videotape of François Rollin, Tsamere met Rollin at the Dinard Comedy Festival. He joined Tsamere and Joyet to write a new show. Rollin had seen his previous show, which played on theatrical [...] "flops", and told Tsamere that he could not perform this humour as himself without showing at the end that he could really do ventriloquism and play the guitar, which he could not. Therefore, the character of a teacher was created to play <b>on</b> <b>failure.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Kevin Young, an African-American {{poet who}} edited a Selected Poems of Berryman for Library of America, commented on this issue: [...] use of [...] "black dialect" [...] is {{frustrating}} and even offensive at times, as many have noted, and deserves examination at length. Nonetheless, the poems are, in part, about an American light {{that is not}} as pure as we may wish; or whose purity may rely not just on success (the dream) but <b>on</b> <b>failure</b> (the song)[...] [...]In turn, the poems are not a song of [...] "myself" [...] but a song of multiple selves. Instead of a cult of personality, we have a clash of personalities—the poems' protagonist Henry speaks not just as [...] "I" [...] but as [...] "he," [...] "we," [...] and [...] "you"[...] [...]Berryman relied on the shifting form to explain in part his disparate personalities[...] [...]The voice shifts from high to low, from archaic language to slang, slant rhyme to full, attempting to render something of jazz or, more accurately, the blues—devil's music. What emerges and succeeds {{is something of a}} sonnet plus some—a devil's sonnet, say (the three sixes stanzas too obvious to be ignored). Berryman's heresy is against the polite modernism that preceded him. That the poem can let in all sorts of Americanisms—not just Greek, as Eliot would have it—and not as signs of culture's decay, but of its American vitality, is fearless and liberating.|$|E
2500|$|... "Tarry this night": Or [...] "lodge here tonight", {{where she}} was. This he said not from any design upon her, {{but for her}} own safety and honour, that she might not be exposed to danger or disgrace, by {{returning}} home at such an unseasonable time of night. The Hebrew letter נ [...] "nun" [...] in the word ליני lî-nî for [...] "tarry" [...] is larger than usual in the Hebrew text; which may be done to raise {{the attention of the}} reader, to observe it as a thing very singular, that a widow should lodge with a man without any diminution of her chastity; so Buxtorf says, that hereby attention is noted, even the honesty of Boaz ordering Ruth to lodge without a man, and wait until a nearer kinsman, according to the law, should come, and promising that <b>on</b> <b>failure</b> thereof he would be the lawful redeemer. But Dr. Lightfoot observes, that as there is a special mark over a word in the story of Lot's eldest daughter lying with her father (a dot above the letter י [...] "yod" [...] of last Hebrew word in Lot's eldest daughter gave birth to Moab, the progenitor of Ruth's tribe) and a special mark on this word here, in the story of Ruth going to Boaz his bed, seems to relate one to the other, and both together to point at the great providence of God in bringing light out of darkness, Ruth, a (fore)mother of Jesus Christ, out of the incest of Lot.|$|E
2500|$|Presumed {{resulting}} trusts do arise, however, in one {{of three}} situations; where it is a voluntary gift, where there is a contribution to purchase price, and where the presumption that it was an outright gift can be rebutted. Where a gift is voluntary, the assumption for personal property is that it creates a resulting trust <b>on</b> <b>failure,</b> as in Re Vinogradoff. For real property, Section 60(3) of the Law of Property Act 1925 prevents the creation of automatic resulting trusts, but does not comment on presumed trusts. In Hodgson v Marks, it is generally agreed that a presumed resulting trust was created over a transfer of real property, although there is some dispute. Where a person contributed to the price of a piece of property, they are presumed to take an equivalent equitable interest in that property; this is the [...] "clearest form of presumed resulting trust", and was recognised by both Browne-Wilkinson in Westdeutsche Landesbank and Megarry in Vandervell (No. 2). These principles originated with Eyre CB's judgment in Dyer v Dyer, where he said that: [...] Thus, where a person contributes to the purchase of the property, they will receive an equivalent equitable interest in any resulting trust that arises. For trusts over homes, a distinct set of rules have arisen that do not apply to other land, because of the additional concerns. For example, while contributing to the mortgage will create an equitable interest, as in Lloyds Bank v Rosset, contributing to domestic expenses will not, as in Burns v Burns. It must also be demonstrated that the contribution was not made for any purpose other than acquiring an equitable interest; in Sekhon v Alissa, for example, a mother transferred a house into her daughter's name to avoid capital gains tax. The court ruled that this created a resulting trust; because tax avoidance was the main objective, the mother could not possibly have intended it to be an outright gift.|$|E
