50|$|Following Royce's {{introduction}} in Season 3, city {{voters are}} {{angered by the}} rise in crime and <b>other</b> <b>negative</b> <b>attributes</b> from Royce's office. Royce appeases the voters through criticizing and threatening to demote his subordinates such as Burrell to make the city look better. Royce is actually more concerned about creating a good image amongst city voters temporarily {{as a means of}} winning the election and is not as concerned about having his office create good permanent changes that occur based on the voter's actual needs. To win against Tommy Carcetti and Tony Gray, Royce plays the race card in the election in Season 4 relying on Baltimore's black majority to vote for him. Royce's office figures that with their funding, Carcetti's race, black flag campaign colors, and Marcus Garvey posters that Royce appears as the best candidate amongst black voters. Odell Watkins however sees through Royce's scheme pointing out that his interest in the voters' safety is not as high as his interest in the property developers' security causing him to move his support to Tommy Carcetti which becomes the turning point during re-election.|$|E
5000|$|In {{contexts}} {{where their}} differences are visible, {{persons with disabilities}} often face stigma. People frequently react to disabled presence with fear, pity, patronization, intrusive gazes, revulsion, or disregard. These reactions can, and often do, exclude persons with disabilities from accessing social spaces along with the benefits and resources these spaces provide. Disabled writer/researcher Jenny Morris describes how stigma functions to marginalize persons with disabilities: “Going out in public so often takes courage. How many of us find that we can't dredge up the strength to do it day after day, week after week, year after year, a lifetime of rejection and revulsion? It is not only physical limitations that restrict us to our homes and those whom we know. It is the knowledge that each entry into the public world will be dominated by stares, by condescension, by pity and by hostility.” Additionally, facing stigma can cause harm to psycho-emotional well-being of the person being stigmatized. One {{of the ways in}} which the psycho-emotional health of persons with disabilities is adversely affected is through the internalization of the oppression they experience, which can lead to feeling that they are weak, crazy, worthless, or any number of <b>other</b> <b>negative</b> <b>attributes</b> that may be associated with their conditions. Internalization of oppression damages the self-esteem of the person affected and shapes their behaviors in ways that are compliant with nondisabled dominance. Ableist ideas are frequently internalized when disabled people are pressured by the people and institutions around them to hide and downplay their disabled difference, or, [...] "pass". According to writer Simi Linton, the act of passing takes a deep emotional toll by causing disabled individuals to experience loss of community, anxiety and self-doubt. The media play a significant role in creating and reinforcing stigma associated with disability. Media portrayals of disability usually cast disabled presence as necessarily marginal within society at large. These portrayals simultaneously reflect and influence popular perception of disabled difference.|$|E

This essay uses quantitative content analysis to examine news articles published between 2002 and 2016 to investigate changes in how the Sami minority is depicted in local media. This topic is influenced due to the Culture Capital event of 2014 {{that took place in the}} city of Umeå, located in northern Sweden. The event involved a lot of Sami culture, tradition and performances which might have had an effect on the type of news that local newspapers published. The results show that articles that involve news about conflicts, discrimination and <b>other</b> <b>negative</b> <b>attributes</b> have lowered throughout the years since 2002. The biggest change can however be seen in the period after 2009 where the negative articles lowered to a much higher degree than the years before.

40|$|Despite the {{profound}} impact and pervasiveness of white-collar crime, {{few studies have}} assessed how white-collar criminals? personality affects juror perceptions of defendants. The current study aimed to provide insight regarding layperson perceptions of white-collar criminal defendants by examining how those views are impacted by manipulating {{the presentation of the}} defendant?s personality traits (i. e., boldness and disinhibition). Although typically regarded as an adaptive and socially desirable trait, it was hypothesized that boldness would be perceived negatively within the context of deviant behavior (i. e., white-collar crimes). To examine these issues, participants (330 community members, recruited via Amazon?s Mechanical Turk website) read a short vignette about a white-collar criminal defendant, in which the defendant?s degree of boldness and disinhibition was manipulated, then provided sentence recommendations and rated the defendant?s level of psychopathy and <b>other</b> <b>negative</b> <b>attributes.</b> As hypothesized, manipulating boldness and disinhibition impacted negative views toward the defendant with the boldness manipulation more consistently predicting higher psychopathy, ?evil,? and meanness ratings. Surprisingly, neither manipulation predicted more punitive sentence recommendations, but higher psychopathy and ?evil? ratings did correlate with more punitive sentence recommendations. The present results are consistent with prior research on juror perceptions within the context of violent crime, such that perceiving the defendant as more psychopathic correlated with more punitive views. These findings also suggest that the presence of personality traits that typically are seen as advantageous or socially desirable can be perceived as more dysfunctional when they occur in the context of criminal behavior...|$|E

40|$|International audiencePsycho-neuro-endocrine-immune {{modulation}} {{through the}} brain-gut axis likely has {{a key role}} in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The brain-gut axis involves interactions among the neural components, including (1) the autonomic nervous system, (2) the central nervous system, (3) the stress system (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis), (4) the (gastrointestinal) corticotropin-releasing factor system, and (5) the intestinal response (including the intestinal barrier, the luminal microbiota, and the intestinal immune response). Animal models suggest that the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway through an anti-tumor necrosis factor effect of the efferent vagus nerve could be a therapeutic target in IBD through a pharmacologic, nutritional, or neurostimulation approach. In addition, the psychophysiological vulnerability of patients with IBD, secondary to the potential presence of any mood disorders, distress, increased perceived stress, or maladaptive coping strategies, underscores the psychological needs of patients with IBD. Clinicians need to address these issues with patients because there is emerging evidence that stress or <b>other</b> <b>negative</b> psychological <b>attributes</b> may have an effect on the disease course. Future research may include exploration of markers of brain-gut interactions, including serum/salivary cortisol (as a marker of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis), heart rate variability (as a marker of the sympathovagal balance), or brain imaging studies. The widespread use and potential impact of complementary and alternative medicine and the positive response to placebo (in clinical trials) is further evidence that exploring other psycho-interventions may be important therapeutic adjuncts to the conventional therapeutic approach in IBD...|$|R

We proposed, drawing from Construal Level Theory, that temporally distant (vs. near) predictions reflect the “gist” self-attributes, rather than other attributes (“noise”). Based on the self-enhancement literature, positive (vs. <b>negative)</b> <b>attributes</b> will be perceived as the “gist. rdquo; In three studies, we tested the hypothesis that positive attributes are more prominent in distant predictions. Distant (compared to near) predictions reflect the “gist” attributes, are more positive and confident (Study 1).

Distant predictions reflect a greater better-than-average effect, better ratings on positive (and not-as-bad on <b>negative)</b> <b>attributes</b> in comparison to peers (Study 3). These tendencies hold true for individuals with varying levels of self-esteem (Studies 1, 3).

5000|$|From {{the notion}} of {{absolute}} unity results the conception of the uniqueness of God; for if two beings of this kind could exist, the unity of God would be nullified, since to one, at least, of the units a special character must be attributed so as to distinguish it from the other (ib.). With {{the doctrine of the}} unity of God is connected the doctrine of the divine attributes, which is preceded in Abraham ibn Daud's system by the doctrine of the <b>negative</b> <b>attributes,</b> already accepted by Bahya ibn Paquda ("Ḥobot ha-Lebabot," [...] i. 10) and by Judah ha-Levi (Kuzari, ii. 2) from the older Arabic theology. According to Ibn Daud, only <b>negative</b> <b>attributes,</b> in the strict and proper sense, can be imputed to God; so that, whatever multiplicity of these <b>negative</b> <b>attributes</b> may be ascribed to Him, no multiplicity in the essence of God can result. Certainly this is equivalent to a renunciation of a positive conception of the Divine Being; for negative statements may suffice to prevent erroneous ideas, but a positive knowledge can never be obtained through them alone (ib. p. 5; German trans., p. 65). Indeed, our whole knowledge of God is limited to two certainties, (1) that He exists and (2) that His essence is incomprehensible (ib. p. 56; German trans., p. 71).
