500|$|Co-creator J. J.

The specific story for Fringe was developed during long conversations between series creators Abrams, Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman. The team was discussing several different options, and the idea behind Fringe appealed to them most because it contained a long-term story and characters' backstories which were not [...] "evident but alluded to in the pilot". The team spent a lot <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> the [...] "trifecta of characters" [...] that they needed to have in the series, and why there were uniquely interesting.

And I think for us it's always about coming into it through character". Orci stated that the series is a combination of a procedural and an [...] "extremely serialized and very culty" [...] series, quoting as examples of each, Law & Order and Lost.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{begins by}} problematizing the `taken for granted' status <b>of</b> Newtonian linear <b>time</b> {{at the heart}} of (social) psychology. Borrowing from Adam, the paper makes a {{distinction}} between an `events in time' and `time in events' approach to social psychology. It argues that a `time in events' approach helps to reveal the importance <b>of</b> multiple <b>times</b> for social psychological theories and practices. To demonstrate this approach, it considers some <b>of</b> the multiple <b>times</b> that are relevant for analysing the concept of `identity'. It also explores the multiple <b>times</b> <b>of</b> the research encounter. In doing so, it suggests that traditional dichotomies in social psychology between synchronic and diachronic methods, and between experimental and qualitative methods, can be dissolved by this focus on the temporal. The paper concludes with some observations about the importance <b>of</b> <b>time</b> for <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> social psychology as a knowledge-producing practice...|$|R
30|$|It {{has long}} been {{recognized}} that attentional disengagements in educational contexts (i.e., while studying or in class) are a major hindrance to students’ ability to learn and retain information. For example, early reports suggested that students spend 10 – 40 % <b>of</b> class <b>time</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> topics unrelated to the class (Schoen, 1970). Furthermore, recent {{research has suggested that}} students begin to experience disengagements (mind-wandering or external distraction) within the first 5 min of class with increasing frequency of disengagements as the lecture progresses (Bunce, Flens, & Neiles, 2010). Additionally, recent research suggests that roughly 76 % of college students’ disengagements occur either in class or while studying (Unsworth, McMillan, et al., 2012). Clearly, understanding the nature of the these attentional disengagements and for whom, and under what circumstances, they are most frequent is important in order to not only understand how the attentional system operates in the real world but to also devise better interventions to keep students focused in class and while studying to ensure better learning and retention of material.|$|R
