5|$|After the Cultural Revolution, Xin Fengxia was {{politically}} rehabilitated in 1979, {{but was unable}} to return to the stage because of her disability. Her performance in Flowers as Matchmakers in 1964 proved to be her last. She devoted her energy to writing, painting, and training the younger generation of pingju performers. In 1997, she published her two-million-word memoir, which has been translated into English and Urdu. Ye Shengtao, the renowned writer and publisher, greatly encouraged her to write. He composed two poems praising her courage and talent. Her paintings, which were decorated with her husband's calligraphy, were also popular, and an exhibition <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>was</b> held at the China Military Museum in 1994. She was elected {{as a member of the}} Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.|$|E

Only one <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>was</b> captured, the remainder were killed. The amount of damage the Germans inflicted made up for the losses; the Evere strike was a success.|$|E
5|$|Although {{in places}} {{there was a}} mixture of {{different}} companies and platoons dug in together, the Australians were deployed with the 8th Battalion in the south still centred on Bolton's Ridge.

North <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>was</b> the 5th Battalion, and the 10th Battalion covered the northern sector of 400 Plateau at Johnston's Jolly. But by now they were battalions in name only, having all taken heavy casualties; the commanders had little accurate knowledge of where their men were located.|$|E

5|$|Before Báthory's {{election}} to the throne of the Commonwealth, Ivan the Terrible of Russia had begun encroaching on its sphere {{of interest in the}} northeast, eventually invading the Commonwealth borderlands in Livonia; the conflict would grow to involve a number of nearby powers (outside Russia and Poland-Lithuania, also Sweden, the Kingdom of Livonia and Denmark-Norway). Each <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>was</b> vying for control of Livonia, and the resulting conflict, lasting for several years, became known as the Livonian War. By 1577 Ivan was in control of most of the disputed territory, but his conquest was short-lived. In 1578 Commonwealth forces scored a number of victories in Liviona and begun pushing Ivan's forces back; this marked the turning point in the war. Báthory, together with his chancellor Zamoyski, led the army of the Commonwealth in a series of decisive campaigns taking Polotsk in 1579 and Velikiye Luki in 1580.|$|E
5|$|By late 2011, {{there were}} ten {{different}} routes under consideration, and an assessment <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>was</b> {{expected to be}} delivered in spring 2012. Halcrow Group, the engineering consultancy, were responsible for carrying out the assessment, which looked at the benefits that each route might provide, not only for navigation but also for water quality, water resources and habitat for wildlife. The study was expected to provide a short-list of routes, which would then {{be the subject of}} further consultation.|$|E
5|$|By the 9th century, the Slavs {{had settled}} the Baltic coast in Pomerania, which {{subsequently}} {{developed into a}} commercial and military power. Along the coastline, remnants of Scandinavian settlements and emporia were to be found. The most important <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>was</b> probably the trade settlement and seaport of Truso, located in Prussia. Prussia itself was relatively unaffected by Slavic migration and remained inhabited by Baltic Old Prussians. During the same time, the tribe of the Vistulans (Wiślanie), based in Kraków and the surrounding region, controlled a large area in the south, which they developed and fortified with many strongholds.|$|E

5|$|Contador faced {{repeated}} {{challenges from}} Riccardo Riccò and Danilo Di Luca in the race's final week. They {{were separated by}} {{less than a minute}} after stage 15, and though Di Luca would falter slightly in the Giro's second individual time trial, the time gap among the three <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>was</b> just 21 seconds heading in to the Giro's final mountain stage. Di Luca faltered further in that last mountain stage, losing almost five minutes and any chance to repeat as Giro champion, but Contador and Riccò finished together and were separated by only four seconds going into the Giro's final stage, another individual time trial. Contador's superior time trial skills provided the difference in the Giro's finale. Though he finished 11th on the stage, he gained almost two minutes over Riccò, winning the Giro overall without taking any individual stage.|$|E

One <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>was</b> given to the camp Commandant as promised and another puppy was smuggled into the women's camp along with any food that the men could spare. A further puppy was given to the Red Cross in Medan, one more was beaten to death by a drunken guard, and the final one remained in the camp after Judy and Williams left.|$|E

5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the 1990s, construction of the motorway was further postponed because of onset of the Croatian War of Independence. The decade saw renewed discussion regarding construction of the motorway, including renewed considerations of its route. Soon, the originally devised route running through Bihać was set aside and two new routes were considered: One <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>was</b> {{a modified version of the}} original route, bypassing Bihać and running through the Plitvice Lakes region while the other was a completely new route further to the west via Gospić and Zadar, which was eventually accepted for construction. Both of the alternative routes proposed that the Zagreb–Karlovac motorway already completed in 1972 were to be used as the northernmost section of the Zagreb–Split and Zagreb–Rijeka motorways.|$|E
