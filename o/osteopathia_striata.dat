40|$|<b>Osteopathia</b> <b>striata</b> with cranial {{sclerosis}} (OSCS) is an X-linked dominant condition {{marked by}} linear striations mainly affecting the metaphyseal {{region of the}} long bones and pelvis in combination with cranial sclerosis. Recently, the disease-causing gene was identified as the WTX gene (FAM 123 B), an inhibitor of WNT signaling. A correlation was suggested between {{the position of the}} mutation and male lethality. We performed genotype and phenotype studies using 18 patients from eight families with possible WTX gene defects and expanded the clinical spectrum of the affected females. All investigated families diagnosed with OSCS had WTX gene defects. One family had a WTX gene deletion; three of four point mutations were novel. The earlier reported WTX c. 1072 C>T was detected in four sporadic patients and appears to be a hotspot for mutations. Based {{on the nature of the}} mutation present in a surviving male patient, our data do not support the hypothesis raised by Jenkins et al. (2009) regarding a genotype-phenotype correlation for male lethality. The finding of a gene involved in WNT signaling as the cause of this sclerosing bone phenotype is not unexpected, but further functional studies are needed to explain the specific features. The WTX gene is mutated in different types of cancer, and it remains to be explained why <b>osteopathia</b> <b>striata</b> patients appear not to have an increased risk of cancer.

40|$|Sclerosing bone {{disorders}} can be subdivided {{according to}} their clinical presentation, the primarily affected cell type, and the cellular pathways. Osteoclast-rich osteopetrosis and related disorders have been related in most cases to mutations in genes required for osteoclast function. More recently, osteoclast-poor forms of osteopetrosis {{have been described as}} being connected to factors that govern osteoclast differentiation. However, increased bone formation can also cause osteosclerosis. Camurati-Engelman disease and osteopoikilosis are both related transforming growth factor-beta signaling. Rare recessive or dominant sclerosing disorders, such as endosteal hyperostosis, sclerosteosis, van Buchem disease, high bone-mass syndrome, and <b>osteopathia</b> <b>striata,</b> are caused by mutations in genes involved in the Wnt pathway, which regulates osteoblast differentiation.

40|$|<b>Osteopathia</b> <b>striata</b> congenita with cranial {{sclerosis}} (OSCS) is a skeletal dysplasia {{caused by}} germline deletions of or truncating point mutations in the X-linked gene WTX (FAM 123 B, AMER 1).

40|$|SummaryWTX is an X-linked tumor {{suppressor}} {{targeted by}} somatic mutations in Wilms tumor, a pediatric kidney cancer, and by germline inactivation in <b>osteopathia</b> <b>striata</b> with cranial sclerosis, a bone overgrowth syndrome. Here, {{we show that}} Wtx deletion in mice causes neonatal lethality, somatic overgrowth, and malformation of multiple mesenchyme-derived tissues, including bone, fat, kidney, heart, and spleen. Inactivation of Wtx at different developmental stages and in primary mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs) reveals that bone mass increase and adipose tissue deficiency are due to altered lineage fate decisions coupled with delayed terminal differentiation. Specification defects in MPCs result from aberrant β-catenin activation, whereas alternative pathways contribute to the subsequently delayed differentiation of lineage-restricted cells. Thus, Wtx is a regulator of MPC commitment and differentiation with stage-specific functions in inhibiting canonical Wnt signaling. Furthermore, the constellation of anomalies in Wtx null mice suggests that this tumor suppressor broadly regulates MPCs in multiple tissues...|$|E
40|$|Abnormalities in WNT {{signaling}} are {{implicated in}} {{a broad range of}} developmental anomalies and also in tumorigenesis. Here we demonstrate that germline mutations in WTX (FAM 123 B), a gene that encodes a repressor of canonical WNT signaling, cause an X-linked sclerosing bone dysplasia, <b>osteopathia</b> <b>striata</b> congenita with cranial sclerosis (OSCS; MIM 300373). This condition is typically characterized by increased bone density and craniofacial malformations in females and lethality in males. The mouse homolog of WTX is expressed in the fetal skeleton, and alternative splicing implicates plasma membrane localization of WTX as a factor associated with survival in males with OSCS. WTX has also been shown to be somatically inactivated in 11 - 29 % of cases of Wilms tumor. Despite being germline for such mutations, individuals with OSCS are not predisposed to tumor development. The observed phenotypic discordance dependent upon whether a mutation is germline or occurs somatically suggests the existence of temporal or spatial constraints on the action of WTX during tumorigenesi...|$|E
40|$|<b>Osteopathia</b> <b>striata</b> with cranial {{sclerosis}} (OSCS) is an X-linked disease {{caused by}} truncating mutations in WTX. Females exhibit sclerotic striations {{on the long}} bones, cranial sclerosis, and craniofacial dysmorphism. Males with OSCS have significant skeletal sclerosis, do not have striations but do display a more severe phenotype commonly associated with gross structural malformations, patterning defects, and significant pre- and postnatal lethality. The recent description of mutations in WTX underlying OSCS {{has led to the}} identification of a milder, survivable phenotype in males. Individuals with this presentation can have, in addition to skeletal sclerosis, Hirschsprung disease, joint contractures, cardiomyopathy, and neuromuscular anomalies. A diagnosis of OSCS should be considered in males with macrocephaly, skeletal sclerosis that is most marked in the cranium and the absence of metaphyseal striations.

40|$|Background: <b>Osteopathia</b> <b>striata</b> with cranial {{sclerosis}} (OS-CS) {{is a rare}} bone dysplasia {{that presents}} with variable symptoms mainly due to the associated CS. Methods: The otorhinolaryngologic clinical presentation and temporal bone computed tomography (CT) findings of a new case of OS-CS are presented. Differential diagnosis is also discussed. Results: Our study confirms the typical appearance {{of the temporal bone}} reported in previous CT studies and the utility of CT for evaluating the various etiologies of conductive-mixed hearing loss present in OS-CS. Radiographs of the femur and pelvis revealed the typical striations of OS-CS and allowed us to diagnose this rare form of generalized skeletal dysplasia involving the skull base. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the third reported case of OS-CS in which temporal bone CT evaluation corroborated the smallness of the middle ear cavities, abnormal ossicular fixation, and bone sclerosis of the mastoid cells. Other radiographic studies regarding the whole skeleton may, in combination, be very helpful in the differential diagnosis between the different forms of generalized skeletal diseases with bone sclerosis involving the skull base...|$|E

40|$|A {{previously}} well 13 -year-old boy {{presented with}} a 3 -month history of right-sided hip pain responding to simple analgesia. Physical examination and blood tests were unremarkable. A pelvic x-ray (fi gure 1) revealed multiple sclerotic lesions in both femora, worse on the asymptomatic left side (fi gure 2) with further lesions in the pelvis. Review of a previous x-ray taken for minor trauma 2 years earlier demonstrated similar lesions in the right humerus. Following discussion with radiology, a diagnosis of osteopoikilosis was made. Osteopoikilosis (osteopathia condensans or osteosclerosis fragilis con-genita) is an osteosclerotic dysplasia, seen in males and females of all ages but rarely before 3 years of age. 1 Inherited and sporadic cases have been identifi ed {{as well as a}} possible link to dwarfi sm and dystocia. Genetic stud-ies suggest autosomal dominant inheritance with possi-ble increasing penetrance. 2 The radiographic fi ndings of osteopoikilosis consist of multiple 3 – 10 mm, well-defi ned sclerotic foci 2 often symmetrically distributed and usually clustered in epiphyses and metaphyses of tubular long bones. Cases of osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma and giant cell tumours in patients with osteopoikilosis have been reported, although no defi nite association has been estab-lished. 1 While the imaging appearances of osteopoikilo-sis are pathognomonic, other conditions may give rise to similar appearances. These include melorrheostosis, <b>osteopathia</b> <b>striata,</b> enostoses, mastocytosis, tuberous sclerosis but also primary bone malignancy and metas-tases. Importantly, 25 % of osteopoikilosis patients also manifest cutaneous lesions (dermatofi brosis lenticularis disseminate). 1 Knowledge of the pathognomonic radio-graphic features of osteopoikilosis can avoid multiple investigations as well as unnecessary anxiety in patient and physician alike. 3 Acknowledgements The {{authors would like to thank}} the patient and family for giving consent for the images to be used...|$|E
