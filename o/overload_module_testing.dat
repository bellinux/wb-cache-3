We use this pass probability to exploit the abort-on-fail feature of automatic test equipment (ATE) and hence reduce the expected test time {{in the context of}} single-site testing. We present a model for calculation of expected test time, for which the abortable test unit can be a <b>module</b> <b>test,</b> a test pattern or a clock cycle. Given an SOC, with test architecture consisting of <b>module</b> <b>test</b> wrappers and test access mechanisms (TAMs), and given <b>module</b> <b>test</b> pass probabilities, we schedule the tests on each TAM to minimize the expected test time. We describe four scheduling heuristics, one without and three with preemption. Experimental results for the ITC’ 02 SOC Test Benchmarks show 3. 5 % and 20 % reduction of expected test time in SOCs with 0. 89 and 0. 71 SOC test pass probability respectively, without modification of SOC or ATE. Further experiments show how accurate estimates for the <b>module</b> <b>test</b> pass probability or the distribution of pass probability over test patterns need to be to lead to effective test schedulng...|$|R

In the <b>module</b> <b>testing</b> phase, single software modules are evaluated individually, which allows the identification of elementary errors like overflow, underflow, round-off, as well as discrepancies between algorithm model simulation results and the signals coming from the engine management system (EMS). The integration testing phase, performed afterwards, aims to verify whether the <b>tested</b> <b>module</b> is correctly integrated in the overall software system. Finally, functional testing (also called validation testing) is applied to validate the algorithms concerning functional requirements. This stage is usually performed after the calibration phase and characterizes an overall system testing, concluding the new software testing phase, and allowing, therefore, its release.|$|R

40|$|Today's {{business}} environment {{has become increasingly}} unexpected and fast changing because of the global competition. This new environment requires the companies to organize their control differently, e. g. by logistic process thinking. Logistic process thinking in software engineering applies the principles of production process to immaterial products. Processes must be optimized, so that every phase adds value to the customer, and the lead times can be cut shorter to meet the new customer requirements. The purpose of this thesis is to examine and optimize the testing processes of software engineering concentrating on <b>module</b> <b>testing,</b> functional testing and their interface. The concept of logistic process thinking is introduced through production process, value added model and process management. Also theory of testing based on literature is presented, concentrating on <b>module</b> <b>testing</b> and functional testing. The testing processes of the Case Company are presented together with the project models {{in which they are}} implemented. The real life practices in <b>module</b> <b>testing</b> and functional testing and their interface are examined through interviews. These practices are analyzed against the processes and the testing theory, through which ideas for optimizing the testing process are introduced.

This paper explores issues of isolating modules from the men-time environment, improving integration of testing into the development environment, automating resting, and improving test planning and documentation. Metrics were gathered throughout the project that allow a coarse cost-benefit evaluation. Code coverage metrics for statement and branch coverage were also gathered using a commercial code coverage analysis tool.

40|$|Graduation date: 1980 An {{individualized}} beginning construction course, CT 225, {{was developed}} to accommodate students entering the clothing course sequences with varying amounts of knowledge and skill {{in the area of}} construction. The faculty in the Clothing, Textiles & Related Arts Department at Oregon State University wanted to determine new students' skills and knowledge in the area of construction and give credit to the students who had already mastered the basics through other experiences. To accomplish this a diagnostic test was needed which would assess knowledge of the material covered in the seven modules or units of CT 225. The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop such a test to be used both as diagnostic and summative tests for the course. The CT 225 tests were developed for the course. Then, more specific objectives were written based on the general ones. Next, tables of specifications were written for each of the seven modules which identified the course content and the learning outcomes expected for the students. The test items were written. Then the behavioral objectives for the course, the tables of specifications, and the test items were given to two panels of judges who judged the questions for content validity, ambiguity, and correct course content. The test items were revised using the judges' comments as guidelines. The two revised forms of the diagnostic test were administered to students enrolled in CT 225 Winter term, 1980, at Oregon State University. Statistical analysis was done and results were compiled. Both Forms A and B of the CT 225 diagnostic test were found to be comparable in three of the four following areas: discrimination power, difficulty level, distracter effectiveness, and reliability. Difficulty levels of the two tests differed. Test B was somewhat more difficult than Test A. The reliability coefficients for both diagnostic Tests A and B were very satisfactory. The tests are comparable in this respect. The reliability of the diagnostic <b>tests,</b> subdivided into <b>module</b> <b>tests,</b> decreased when item analysis was run on the individual <b>module</b> <b>tests.</b> <b>Tests</b> for <b>modules</b> one and six, Form A, were in the acceptable reliability range; the same was true for <b>module</b> <b>tests</b> one and four of Form B. All the other <b>module</b> <b>tests,</b> Forms A and B, fell below the acceptable reliability level when analyzed as individual tests. When the tests were subdivided into <b>module</b> <b>tests</b> and the statistics run for each part, different results appeared. More of the test items in both Tests A and B were found to discriminate. The two forms of the test were still comparable, but more test items discriminated correctly between the low scoring and high scoring groups. Validity for both the whole and <b>module</b> <b>tests</b> was deemed acceptable. Both sets of judges found the tests to measure what the objectives stated. The tests covered the behavioral objectives thoroughly and the clothing and textile content was found to be accurate...|$|R
