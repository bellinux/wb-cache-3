25|$|Motion: Some things {{undoubtedly}} move, though cannot cause their <b>own</b> <b>motion.</b> Since {{there can}} be no infinite chain of causes of motion, there must be a First Mover not moved by anything else, and this is what everyone understands by God.|$|E
25|$|Because {{of their}} belief that the EC {{should be allowed to}} {{continue}} its reform work, Green and the PES announced that they would be voting against their <b>own</b> <b>motion</b> of censure – effectively trying to defeat a call for the sacking of the EC that they had made.|$|E
25|$|I cannot assent to that {{assertion}} {{of power in}} those terms. Sec. 38, par. (u), of the Act authorizes the Court to give all such directions and do all such things as it deems necessary or expedient in the premises. I apprehend that those words empower the President {{to deal with all}} matters incidental and ancillary, provided they are within the ambit of the dispute submitted to him. But the Court cannot of its <b>own</b> <b>motion</b> give directions in a matter not substantially involved in or connected with the disputes submitted to it.|$|E

25|$|Another {{example of}} {{filibuster}} in Canada federally came in early 2014 when NDP MP and Deputy Leader David Christopherson filibustered the government's bill C-23, the Fair Elections Act at the Procedure and House Affairs Committee. His filibuster lasted several meetings {{the last of}} which he spoke for over 8 hours and was done to support his <b>own</b> <b>motion</b> to hold cross country hearings on the bill so MPs could hear what the Canadian public thought of the bill. In the end, given that the Conservative government had a majority at committee, his motion was defeated and the bill passed although with some significant amendments.|$|E
25|$|Notice that {{to send a}} {{laser pulse}} toward the {{stationary}} observer S at R = 0, the Langevin observer L has to aim slightly behind to correct for its <b>own</b> <b>motion.</b> Turning things around, just as a duck hunter would expect, to send a laser pulse toward the Langevin observer riding a counterclockwise rotating ring, the central observer has to aim, not at this observer's current position, but at the position at which he will arrive {{just in time to}} intercept the signal. These families of inward and outward bound radial null geodesics represent very different curves in spacetime and their projections do not agree for ω > 0.|$|E
25|$|The High Court {{may call}} for {{and examine the}} record of any civil {{proceedings}} before any subordinate court to satisfy itself that any decision made was correct, legal and proper, and that the proceedings were not irregular. Having called for the records, the Court may give orders, including directing that a new trial be held, as seem necessary to secure that substantial justice is done. Although the Court can either act on its <b>own</b> <b>motion</b> or at the instance of a party, it will not entertain a request by a party to exercise its power of revision if the party could have appealed from the subordinate court decision but failed to do so.|$|E

'Mr. Waverley, sir, regulates his <b>own</b> <b>motions.</b> You {{will follow}} me, I suppose, to Pinkie,' said Fergus, turning to Edward, 'when you have {{finished}} your discourse {{with this new}} acquaintance?' So saying, the Chief of Glennaquoich adjusted his plaid with rather more than his usual air of haughty assumption and left the apartment.|$|R
50|$|Ironically, the {{tendency}} to build robots has been to minimize the degrees of freedom because that reduces the control problems. Recent improvements in computers has shifted the emphasis to more degrees of freedom, allowing robotic devices that seem more intelligent and more human in their motions. This also allows more direct teleoperation as the user can control the robot with their <b>own</b> <b>motions.</b>|$|R

"All that I ask, my lord," [...] said Richie, gravely, {{and with}} a tone of great moderation, [...] "is to have the {{uninterrupted}} command of my <b>own</b> <b>motions,</b> for certain important purposes which I have now in hand, always giving your lordship the solace of my company and attendance, at such times as may be at once convenient for me, and necessary for your service." ...|$|R
25|$|In 1983, Safia Bibi, {{a nearly}} blind teenaged {{domestic}} servant was allegedly raped by her employer and his son. Due {{to lack of}} evidence, she was convicted for adultery under the Zina ordinance, while the rapists were acquitted. She was sentenced to fifteen lashes, five years imprisonment, and a fine of 1000 rupees. The decision attracted so much publicity and condemnation from {{the public and the}} press that the Federal Shariah Court of its <b>own</b> <b>motion,</b> called for the records of the case and ordered that she should be released from prison on her own bond. Subsequently, on appeal, the finding of the trial court was reversed and the conviction was set aside.|$|E
25|$|A {{story is}} told of the young duke of Burgundy, Fénelon's pupil, who was then only eleven years old, sending 50 louis to La Fontaine as a present of his <b>own</b> <b>motion.</b> But, though La Fontaine {{recovered}} for the time, he was broken by age and infirmity, and his new hosts had to nurse rather than to entertain him, which they did very carefully and kindly. He did a little more work, completing his Fables among other things; {{but he did not}} survive Madame de la Sablière much more than two years, dying on 13 April 1695 in Paris, at the age of seventy-three. When the Père Lachaise Cemetery opened in Paris, La Fontaine's remains were moved there. His wife survived him nearly fifteen years.|$|E
25|$|As we now know, {{the fixed}} stars are not fixed. Those that {{reside in the}} Milky Way turn with the galaxy, exhibiting proper motions. Those that are outside our galaxy (such as nebulae once mistaken to be stars) {{participate}} in their <b>own</b> <b>motion</b> as well, partly due to expansion of the universe, and partly due to peculiar velocities. The Andromeda galaxy is on collision course with the Milky Way at a speed of 117km/s. The concept of inertial frames of reference is no longer tied to either the fixed stars or to absolute space. Rather, the identification of an inertial frame {{is based upon the}} simplicity of the laws of physics in the frame. In particular, the absence of fictitious forces is their identifying property.|$|E

50|$|The texture {{is created}} during the glass sheet-forming process. A sheet is formed from molten glass with a roller that spins on itself, while {{travelling}} forward. Normally the roller spins {{at the same}} speed as its <b>own</b> forward <b>motion,</b> and the resulting sheet has a smooth surface. In the manufacture of rippled glass, the roller spins faster than its <b>own</b> forward <b>motion.</b> The rippled effect is retained as the glass cools.|$|R
25|$|The High Court has general {{supervisory}} and revisionary {{jurisdiction over}} all subordinate courts. If {{the interests of}} justice appear to require it, the Court may, either of its <b>own</b> <b>motion</b> or if requested by any interested person, call for the records of any matter or proceeding in a subordinate court, whether civil or criminal, at any stage. It may then order that the matter {{be transferred to the}} High Court or give the subordinate court directions regarding how the matter should be conducted, as justice may require. When exercising supervisory or revisionary jurisdiction, it is for the Court {{to decide whether or not}} to hear submissions from any party to the proceedings; no party has a right to be heard before the Court. However, if the Court intends to make a final order that is to the prejudice of any person, that person must first be given an opportunity of being heard.|$|E
25|$|The {{grant of}} {{probation}} {{may be made}} on the court's <b>own</b> <b>motion.</b> Because the power of pardoning offenders is vested in the President of the United States only, probation is not considered a pardon of any kind, but rather an authorized form of punishment of mild nature, and unlike a pardon, it cannot be refused by the convicted person. Federal courts have an inherent power to reduce a sentence, but without Congressional authorization, a federal court has no power to suspend the execution of a sentence which it has imposed or to place the defendant on probation. When this was first announced by the Supreme Court in 1916 in the case of Ex Parte United States, an abrupt halt was brought to a practice which, by then, had become widespread in the federal system, and which had existed for more than 70 years. A sentence for a period of one year with an order that, after the defendant had served three months of his sentence, probation was to be granted on the condition that the defendant abide by laws, was void for want of jurisdiction, since it was in effect an exercise of pardoning power.|$|E
25|$|In response, on {{the basis}} it was {{tantamount}} to a vote of no confidence, the President of PES, Pauline Green, announced she would put forward a motion of censure. However PES would vote against its <b>own</b> <b>motion,</b> {{as there is no}} method for a motion of confidence. During this period, the Parliament took on an increased government-opposition dynamic, with PES as a party supporting the Commission and the EPP renouncing its support and acting as a de facto opposition party to the executive. This is in part because the allegations centred on Édith Cresson and Manuel Marín, both from the Socialist party (PES). It was seen by some that it was an attempt by the People's party (EPP) to discredit PES ahead of the 1999 elections. This led to hesitation from the PES leadership, who were the largest group in Parliament, to support the allegations. Motions tabled by the two groups outlined the differing stances the EPP favouring individual responsibility (just those whom the main allegations are against) and PES favouring an emphasis on collective responsibility (so EPP members such as the President, as well as PES members, would be forced to resign). The PES resolution also proposed establishing a committee of independent experts to investigate the allegations.|$|E

It took him two years to make the film—twice as long as expected—as he was perfecting new ink wash painting techniques in order to not repeat his earlier films. He was also absorbed in exploring human movements and behaviour, even setting up mirrors in his small studio to study his <b>own</b> <b>motions.</b>|$|R

500|$|In his Planetary Hypotheses, Ptolemy (c.90–168) {{rejected}} the Aristotelian {{concept of an}} external prime mover, maintaining instead that the planets have souls and move themselves with a voluntary motion. [...] Each planet sends out motive emissions that direct its <b>own</b> <b>motion</b> and the motions of the epicycle and deferent that make up its system, just as a bird sends out emissions to its nerves that direct the motions of its feet and wings.|$|E
500|$|After {{sidestepping}} {{the political}} landmine {{for most of}} the first year of his time as prime minister, much as all the post-Charlottetown Accord prime ministers had done, Harper's hand was forced to reopen the Quebec sovereignty debate after the opposition Bloc Québécois were to introduce a motion in the House that called for recognition of Quebec as a [...] "nation". On November 22, 2006, Harper introduced his <b>own</b> <b>motion</b> to recognize that [...] "the Québécois form a nation within a united Canada." [...] Five days later, Harper's motion passed, with a margin of 266–16; all federalist parties, and the Bloc Québécois, supported it.|$|E
500|$|President Lincoln {{learned of}} Frémont's {{proclamation}} by reading {{it in the}} newspaper. [...] Disturbed by Frémont's actions, Lincoln felt that emancipation was [...] "not {{within the range of}} military law or necessity" [...] and that such powers rested only with the elected federal government. [...] Lincoln also recognized the monumental political problem that such an edict posed to his efforts to keep the border states in the Union. [...] He was particularly worried about reports he heard of the furor in Kentucky over the edict, writing, [...] "I think to lose Kentucky is nearly the same as to lose the whole game." [...] According to Lincoln in a letter to a supporter of Frémont, a unit of Kentucky militia fighting for the Union, upon hearing of Frémont's proclamation, threw down their weapons and disbanded. Lincoln determined the proclamation could not be allowed to remain in force. However, to override the edict or to directly order Frémont to strike out or modify the paragraph had its own political dangers—such an act would outrage abolitionists throughout the North. [...] Sensitive to the political pitfalls on all sides, Lincoln wrote to Frémont, [...] "Allow me to therefore ask, that you will, as of your <b>own</b> <b>motion,</b> modify that paragraph..." ...|$|E

2500|$|His {{faith as}} a Christian Scientist, which {{was said to}} be [...] "unshakable", led Edwards to get {{involved}} in a prolonged dispute over whether Christian Science 'nurses' should be able to use that title despite not being State Registered Nurses.

When the Ministry of Health acquired the power to control the title 'nurse', he moved his <b>own</b> <b>motion</b> to allow the Christian Science use to continue, arguing that it had been stopped through a loophole in the law.|$|E
2500|$|Independently {{from the}} {{possibility}} to intervene in opposition proceedings (and then to become party to the proceedings), anyone may also file observations under [...] After publication of a European patent application, and a fortiori after grant of a European patent, anyone may file observations regarding the patentability of the invention which {{is the subject of}} the application (during examination proceedings) or patent (during opposition proceedings). In contrast to an intervener however, a person filing observations during opposition proceedings does not become party to the proceedings. This notably means that such person does not acquire the [...] "bundle of procedural rights" [...] created [...] "in respect of the opponent", such as the right to be heard before any decision is taken. Observations by third parties, which must be filed in writing, may be filed by post or online. According to Board of Appeal 3.3.08, the observations have to be signed [...] "in order to allow an identification of the third party" [...] and, unless [...] "adopted by a party to the proceedings as its own" [...] or by the competent organ of the EPO of its <b>own</b> <b>motion,</b> [...] "anonymous third party observations are to be disregarded altogether." ...|$|E
