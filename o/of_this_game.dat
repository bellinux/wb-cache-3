5|$|In April 2009, he {{was named}} in the {{preliminary}} 25 man squad to represent Queensland in the opening State of Origin match for 2009 and was subsequently picked on the interchange bench for the opening State of Origin match on 3 June. Hunt came on in the 25th minute of the game to replace the injured Justin Hodges and played in his centre position {{for the remainder of}} the match which Queensland won.

The portal system and the unusual physics it creates are the emphasis <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>game.</b> Portal was a surprise favorite of The Orange Box, receiving widespread praise and several Game of the Year awards.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} {{to release a}} Game Boy incarnation of the Mega Man series came {{after the release of}} Mega Man 3 on the NES. Early reports of Dr. Wily's Revenge were made in February 1991 in both the magazine GamePro and Steven A. Schwartz's book The Official Guide to Mega Man. The North American version <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>game</b> and the first DOS Mega Man game share a similar cover art. Instead of being an all new illustration, the Dr. Wily's Revenge North American artwork is a simple touch-up of Mega Man 3s regional cover, with the surrounding landscape and robot masters cropped out of the picture.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{loosely based}} on the novel Never Deal with a Dragon by Shadowrun co-creator Robert N. Charrette and set in the year 2050. The player takes on the role of Jake Armitage, a man {{suffering}} from amnesia after having been critically wounded by assassins. The plot then follows Jake as he attempts to uncover his own identity and the identity of the mysterious figure who wants him dead, and eventually complete his mission. Harebrained Schemes' 2013 Shadowrun Returns links the stories <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>game</b> and of Shadowrun for the Sega Genesis.|$|E

50|$|These were {{staged in}} the five seasons from 1996 to 2000 to {{determine}} which team was directly promoted. From 1998, the loser <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>games</b> got a second chance for promotion by playing the runners-up {{of the other two}} Regionalligas.|$|R

5|$|The {{game with}} no {{government}} subsidy {{to the domestic}} firm is shown in Figure 1 on the left. If both firms enter, they each suffer a loss of 10 million dollars and if they both {{stay out of the}} market neither firm makes a profit or a loss. If only one firm enters however, that firm will realize a profit of 50 million dollars while the other firm will make nothing. The two Nash equilibria <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>game</b> (marked in purple) are the situations in which only one firm enters – but which firm, domestic or foreign, is indeterminate. In such a situation if the foreign firm has a slight initial advantage over the domestic firm (perhaps because it began product development earlier) the domestic firm will stay out and the foreign firm will enter.|$|E
5|$|The only UEFA European Fixture to {{take place}} at Prenton Park was a UEFA Cup first {{qualifying}} round tie between Irish team Shelbourne and Scottish team Rangers, on 22 July 1998. Due to fears of sectarian violence, and after discussions between the two clubs and UEFA, Prenton Park {{was chosen as the}} venue for the first leg, with Shelbourne as the home team. The match finished 3–5 in favour of Rangers after Shelbourne (at the time a semi-professional side) had earlier taken a 3–0 lead. As a result <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>game,</b> Rangers were fined 25,000 Swiss Francs and warned by UEFA for their fans' behaviour at the game.|$|E
5|$|Two other Mad Max games, {{developed}} by Cory Barlog and Interplay Entertainment respectively, were in production before the announcement <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>game,</b> {{but neither of}} them were successfully released. Although Mad Max {{is not based on}} the film series, it was inspired by its universe, and franchise creator George Miller was consulted during the game's pre-production. Avalanche Studios found developing a vehicular-combat video game a challenge because of their inexperience with creating that type of game. Announced at the 2013 Electronic Entertainment Expo, the game was re-tooled during development and the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions were canceled.|$|E

5|$|Virginia Tech- The Georgia Tech – Virginia Tech (V.P.I. – Virginia Polytechnic Institute) rivalry {{has grown}} {{considerably}} since Virginia Tech entered the ACC. In previous years, the teams played infrequently. The intra-conference game has often seen both teams ranked {{and the outcome}} has played a key part in determining {{the winner of the}} ACC Coastal Division. Since the ACC switched to Division format in 2005, the winner <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>game</b> has gone on to win the Coastal Division all but once, with VT winning six times and GT winning four times. Dubbed the Battle of the Techs, the game has seen some very close, very intense match-ups.|$|E

Hall in 2007 and 1,056 yards by Hall in 2006. The loss ended a 20-game home winning streak for the Tide {{dating back to}} the 2007 loss to Louisiana–Monroe, and brought Alabama's all-time record against the Tigers to 40–34–1. The CBS telecast <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>game</b> earned a 7.5 rating, the highest for any game of the 2010 college football season through week 13.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{commercial}} success <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>game,</b> Nintendo released several follow-up {{titles in the}} Dr. Mario series. Dr. Mario 64, released in 2001 for the Nintendo 64, features Wario and several Wario Land 3 characters, and offers numerous game modes, including a story-focused single-player mode.

Dr. Luigi, released in 2013, features Luigi as a playable character and has all the modes in Dr. Mario Online Rx, {{as well as a}} new mode with L-shaped capsules. The latest installment, , was released in 2015 and introduced power-ups to the series.|$|E
50|$|Though genres {{were mostly}} just {{interesting}} for game {{studies in the}} 1980s, the business of video games expanded in the 1990s and both smaller and independent publishers had little chance of surviving. Because <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> <b>games</b> settled more into set genres that larger publishers and retailers could use for marketing.|$|R

5|$|The {{events of}} Mortal Kombat II, {{along with the}} first Mortal Kombat and Mortal Kombat 3 (including its expansions), were later retold in the 2011 {{fighting}} game Mortal Kombat, which was as an effective reboot of the series. In it, Raiden uses time travel to revisit the tournaments from the original games in the series in order to change the future {{in the aftermath of}} Armageddon. The ladder/arcade mode <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>game</b> can follow the same order of bosses as in MKII (with Shang Tsung, Kintaro and Shao Kahn as the final three opponents, although Goro will often be the ninth opponent instead of Kintaro) and its controls and Fatality system are most reminiscent of MKII. Classic costumes from MKII were also brought back as alternate outfits for female ninja characters in the PlayStation Vita version.|$|E
5|$|The {{objective}} in a detonation level is to plant and detonate explosive devices {{on a number}} of enemy positions, which can consist of anti-aircraft guns, tanks and armored cars. Some positions must be hit twice for them to be destroyed. Players can protect their positions by defusing the explosives before they detonate. In one variation <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>game</b> mode, one side has to defend their positions for a set amount of time, with the destruction of each piece of equipment giving the enemy team more time. The defenders win if they can hold their positions long enough for the time to run out, while the attackers win when all objectives have been destroyed. In the alternate version, both teams must attack the other's objectives while defending their own. The first team to destroy all of the enemy's equipment wins.|$|E
5|$|At a Nintendo {{press conference}} in Tokyo, Japan on October 5, 2005, the company {{announced}} several games {{that it would be}} releasing in 2006 in Japan. The list included Brain Age 2, with a release date set for December 29, 2005. Nintendo later announced that the game would be released in Europe on June 29, 2007 for €30, and in Australia on July 5, 2007 for A$49.95. The American version of Brain Age 2 was first revealed in May 2007. The game is targeted to casual gamers, similar to its predecessor; its basic concepts stay the same as in , along with the graphics, menu, and presentation. Brain Age 2 also uses the same Sudoku engine, an addition in the original Brain Age that has been applauded for being one of the best handheld Sudoku games available; Brain Age 2s rendition of Sudoku introduces 100 new puzzles. All of the minigames in the game are new to the series; however, some of them are derived from exercises in Brain Age. One of the challenges in the first game, Head Count, requires that the player count how many people are shown on the screen; after a few seconds, a house falls on top of them, and then several people leave and enter the house. Afterward, the player must write down how many people they think are still in the house. A variation <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>game</b> is available in Brain Age 2, called Memory Sprint, which asks the player to observe a specific sprinter in a race as they pass other sprinters and are passed themselves, and then determine which place they finished in after they cross the finish line. The game's voice recognition technology has improved since the last game. The only challenge that uses the feature, Rock, Paper, Scissors, requires that the player speak the correct answer into the microphone as soon as possible.|$|E
50|$|Incantation was {{released}} in late 1996, {{near the end of}} the lifetime of the Super NES. Releases for 16-bit consoles were no longer highly anticipated, and the game's developer, Titus, had a poor reputation among players at the time <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>game's</b> release, all <b>of</b> which combined to bury the release in obscurity.|$|R
