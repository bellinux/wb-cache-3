40|$|Land {{management}} practices on tropical soils {{have been studied}} extensively during the past decades. However, assessments of their impact on field-scale spatial variability in crop performance are rare. A case of practices affecting spatial crop response at field level in a systematic way is the contour hedgerow system, a widespread soil conservation technique on steep lands in the tropics. <b>The</b> objectives <b>of</b> this study were to assess: (i) spatial variability in crop response under contour hedgerow systems in the Andes and (ii) implications for management of steep land alley farming. In order to measure spatial variability in crop response, Triticum aestivum was sown in rows following the contours, placed every 25 cm along the slope direction. Grain yield was monitored on eight alleys, having slopes from 15 to 30 %, a length of 4 – 8 m and soils ranging from Dystri-Vertic Cambisols to Haplic Phaeozem, in <b>the</b> Andes region <b>of</b> Ecuador. In order to relate crop response with soil fertility, soil sampling {{was carried out in}} bands following the contour. Top soil properties, such as organic carbon, NTotal, NO 3 −, P, exchangeable Aluminium, P fixation, exchangeable bases, CEC and texture, were analysed. <b>The</b> barrier strips <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contour hedgerow systems were composed of: (i) Pennisetum clandestinum and Lolium multiflorum or (ii) Phalaris tuberosa. Spatial variability in crop response was described by fourth-order polynomial equations, where position in <b>the</b> <b>alley</b> was <b>the</b> independent variable and plant characteristics were the dependent variables. Grain yield ranged from 0. 8 to 4. 0 t ha− 1 (net area). Clear and significant patterns of spatial variability in crop response were found in all alleys, with R 2 varying from 0. 55 to 0. 90. Crop response was strongly and positively correlated with NO 3 −, P, exchangeable bases or organic carbon, dependent on the management, age and soil conditions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>alleys.</b> Tillage erosion and soil accumulation on respectively the upper and lower elevations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>alleys</b> were <b>the</b> main causes for a tendency to a significantly increased crop response along the slope direction. However, according <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> grass used in the barrier strip, competition for soil fertility and soil moisture occurred and influenced in negative way crop productivity in <b>the</b> lower elevations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>alleys.</b> An index is proposed to assess <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> contour hedgerows on crop response. The present study shows that contour hedgerow systems cannot always be evaluated as completely positive. Soil fertility improvement on <b>the</b> upper part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>alleys</b> and a better management <b>of</b> <b>the</b> barrier strip are suggested to enhance crop productivity of contour hedgerow systems.

25|$|This rite was {{supposed}} to commemorate the expiation {{of the murder of}} his own sister by Marcus Horatius. The young hero with his head veiled had to pass under a beam spanning an alley. The rite was repeated every year on 1 October. The tigillum consisted of a beam on two posts. It was kept in good condition at public expenses to the time of Livy. Behind the tigillum, on opposite sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>alley,</b> stood the two altars of Janus Curiatius and Juno Sororia. Its location was on the vicus leading to the Carinae, perhaps at the point of the crossing of the pomerium. The rite and myth have been interpreted by Dumezil as a purification and desacralization of the soldiers from the religious pollution contracted in war, and a freeing of the warrior from furor, wrath, as dangerous in the city as it is necessary on campaign.|$|E
25|$|The Tigillum Sororium was a rite (sacrum) of the gens Horatia {{and later}} of the State. In it Janus Curiatius was {{associated}} to Juno Sororia: {{they had their}} altars on opposite sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>alley</b> behind the Tigillum Sororium. Physically this consisted of a beam spanning the space over two posts. It was kept in good condition down {{to the time of}} Livy at public expenses. According to tradition it was a rite of purification that served at the expiation of Publius Horatius who had murdered his own sister when he saw her mourning the death of her betrothed Curiatius. Dumézil has shown in his Les Horaces et les Curiaces that this story is in fact the historical transcription of rites of reintegration into civil life of the young warriors, in the myth symbolised by the hero, freed from their furor (wrath), indispensable at war but dangerous in social life. What is known of the rites of October 1 shows at Rome the legend has been used as an aetiological myth for the yearly purification ceremonies which allowed the desacralisation of soldiers {{at the end of the}} warring season, i.e. their cleansing from the religious pollution contracted at war. The story finds parallels in Irish and Indian mythologies. These rites took place in October, month that at Rome saw the celebration of the end of the yearly military activity. Janus would then the patron of the feria as god of transitions, Juno for her affinities to Janus, especially on the day of the kalendae. It is also possible though that she took part as the tutelary goddess of young people, the iuniores, etymologically identical to her. Modern scholars are divided on the interpretation of J. Curiatius and J. Sororia. Renard citing Capdeville opines that the wisest choice is to adhere to tradition and consider the legend itself as the source of the epithets.|$|E

2500|$|In [...] "Accelerate", Entity FX {{was able}} to create a visual effect of Clark superspeeding through the rain—something Gough and Millar had wanted to see since season one—that {{eventually}} won them a Visual Effects Society award. Gough and Millar had always wanted to see Clark superspeeding through a rain shower, but [...] "the opportunity, [...] money" [...] never presented itself, until now. Entity FX had {{an extended period of time}} to research the kinetics of the cemetery scene, where Clark would speed through rain drops, because there were limited effects done for the episodes [...] "Precipice" [...] and [...] "Witness". Using HoudiniTM, Mat Beck and his team began creating their digital raindrops: [...] "Each raindrop can be thought of as a lens, as a mirror, and an object in itself. The entire backdrop is refracted through it like a lens, and the area behind the camera is being reflected in it. By adjusting those parameters, we were able to give it a brilliant jewel-like magical quality." [...] When trying to decide on the shape of the raindrops, Beck explains: [...] "We figured that round drops weren't that interesting, and teardrop ones looked a little silly and over the top, so we settled on this round diamond shape." [...] Entity FX created [...] "collision events" [...] as Clark ran through the raindrops, breaking them up. Beck remembered watching the cars on the freeway, during a rainstorm, [...] "throwing up these loose trails of spray". Eli Jarra added a similar mist trail to Clark as he ran through the cemetery to give a more realistic effect, although Beck admits to taking a few liberties with the final look of the mist. Occasionally, Mat Beck and his team have to stretch the limits of the realistic physics they try and create when illustrating Clark’s abilities. While creating the alley scene in [...] "Prodigal" [...] where Lucas Luthor is attacked by an assassin with an Uzi 9mm, Mat Beck had to [...] "cheat" [...] the realism on the special effects used. First, the length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>alley</b> is exaggerated in order to create enough time to show Clark stopping the bullets from hitting Lucas. Based on the calculations of how fast an Uzi 9mm fires, and the muzzle velocity, they estimated that the bullets would be approximately twenty to thirty feet apart; four alleys would have been needed for Clark to catch up to all of the bullets in time. Second, the bullets themselves were enlarged so that audiences would be able to see them.|$|E
