25|$|In 1901 Balmont and Lokhvitskaya met, apparently, for {{the last}} time. Since then their {{relationship}} has been confined to enigmatically constructed poetic dialogues, full of demands and threats on his part and pleas for mercy <b>on</b> <b>hers.</b> Apparently both were taking their shared self-created world of horror and passion seriously. Balmont was continuously complaining in his letters of being 'possessed', while Lokhvitskaya submerged herself in a quagmire of violent visions which, coupled with feelings of guilt towards her family, might have led to an illness the roots of which were obviously psychosomatic. Some (Alexandrova included) regard the involvement of Valery Bryusov, Balmont's close rival/friend {{to be the most}} damaging factor. The well-publicized fact that Bryusov (who hated Lokhvitskaya, thinking she was trying to 'steal' a friend of his) dabbled in black magic added a gothic touch to the whole affair.|$|E
2500|$|Warwick {{weathered}} the British Invasion {{better than most}} American artists. Her UK hits were most notably [...] "Walk On By" [...] and [...] "Do You Know the Way to San Jose?" [...] In the UK, a number of Bacharach-David-Warwick songs were recorded by British singers Cilla Black, Sandie Shaw and Dusty Springfield, most notably Black's [...] "Anyone Who Had a Heart" [...] which went to No. 1 in the UK. This upset Warwick, who described feeling insulted when told that in the UK, record company executives wanted her songs recorded by someone else. Warwick even met Cilla Black while on tour in Britain. She recalled what she said to her: [...] "I told her that [...] "You're My World" [...] would be my next single in the States. I honestly believe that if I'd sneezed on my next record, then Cilla would have sneezed <b>on</b> <b>hers</b> too. There was no imagination in her recording." [...] Warwick later covered two of Cilla's songs - [...] "You're My World" [...] appeared on Dionne Warwick in Valley of the Dolls, released in 1968 and on the soundtrack to Alfie.|$|E
2500|$|Barry Allen / Flash investigates {{a meteor}} crash outside Central City {{that turns out}} to be a {{spaceship}} from which aliens emerge. Lyla Michaels tells the team that the [...] "Dominators" [...] landed previously in the 1950s, but then mysteriously departed. Needing help, Barry assembles the original members of Team Arrow, Thea Queen, the Legends, and Kara Danvers, Supergirl of Earth-38. The assembled team begins training at a S.T.A.R. Labs facility, sparring against Supergirl to prepare against the aliens. Kara struggles to earn Oliver Queen's trust, seeing that the Green Arrow is the most revered hero in the superhero community of this world paralleling her cousin's (Superman) status <b>on</b> <b>hers</b> despite not having any powers. Cisco Ramon finds and reveals a message Barry's future self sent to Rip Hunter, which exposes Barry's manipulation of the timeline and how it affected other team members; only Oliver, Kara, Felicity Smoak, Martin Stein and Jefferson [...] "Jax" [...] Jackson still trust him. After the Dominators abduct the President of the United States, the team goes to rescue him, but Barry is forced to remain behind as the majority of them distrust him. Oliver is also forced to stay behind when he attempts to stand up for Barry. Kara leads the group, finding the President but the Dominators kill him as soon as they find him and affect the group with a mind control device. The controlled heroes return and attack S.T.A.R. Labs, forcing Barry and Oliver to confront them. While Oliver holds them off, Barry lures Kara to the device and manipulates her into destroying it, freeing everyone from the Dominators' control. Once the team regroups, as Ray Palmer tells Barry that everyone on the team forgives and still trusts him, Sara Lance, Ray, John Diggle, Thea, and Oliver are abducted by the Dominators.|$|E

2500|$|In 1905, Onerva {{began to}} write short stories that {{eventually}} became parts of a novel. The novel was named , after its protagonist. Onerva was interested in symbolism and decadence and those influences {{can be seen in}} Mirdja. The novel embodies decadent narcissism: Mirdja admires her own beauty and longs for a man to admire her as well. Mirdja encounters problems trying to reconcile the individuality of an independent woman with love. Mirdja experiments with several female roles and ways to love. Her experimentation and relationships, however, turn out unsuccessful. Mirdja parallels many aspects of Onerva's life: Mirdja marries Runar and Onerva marries Väinö Streng, and both Mirdja and Onerva notice that married life does not meet their expectations. Furthermore, Mirdja features the character Rolf Tanne, who has been speculated to be based on Eino Leino. Mirdja was published in 1908 and, initially, it caused a lot of reprehension Mirdjas content advocating for erotic freedom and its contempt for traditional family values attracted frown from, for instance, some women. The novel was positively received by young intellectuals, who liked its depiction of the thoughts and emotions of an independent-minded woman. Mirdja earned Onerva the 1908 State Literature Prize with 1,000 Finnish marks worth of prize money. Conferring the prize on Onerva incited opposition, and the [...] magazine published a womens' objection in response to the nomination. Onerva utilized her own life experiences also in a novel published in 1913 called Inari. In it, Inari is a woman whose love wavers between two men, the artist Porkka and the pianist Alvia. The men are based on Eino Leino and Leevi Madetoja. Onerva made the admission that Inari's love life and fate were based <b>on</b> <b>hers.</b>|$|E
