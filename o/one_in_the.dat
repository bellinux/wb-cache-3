5|$|Typhoon Ivan {{originated}} {{from an area}} of disturbed weather near the equator {{during the first week}} of October 1997. Two equatorial troughs, <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Northern Hemisphere and <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Southern Hemisphere developed from this system. Three resultant areas of low pressure formed; <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Southern Hemisphere developed into Tropical Cyclone Lusi on October8, and two north of the equator steadily tracked westward. The eastern low developed into Typhoon Joan, while the western cyclone became the system that would intensify into Typhoon Ivan. Situated in an environment without significant convective activity, this system initially struggled to become organized. However, the disturbance began to mature, and by October11, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) discovered a low-level circulation center, prompting the issuance of a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert the following day.|$|E
