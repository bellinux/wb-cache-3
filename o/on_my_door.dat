500|$|An Argyle Hall of Famer {{returned}} to Home Park on 18 October 2009, when former England international Paul Mariner was appointed as the club's new head coach. [...] "In football, {{there is not}} much sentiment. But, if sentiment is involved in this scenario, then they gave me my very first chance as a player so I grabbed it with both hands," [...] said Mariner on the New England Revolution website, the club he left to rejoin Argyle. [...] "Plymouth Argyle are in my blood. Obviously the teams you're associated with are the ones you look for every week, and when they came knocking <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>door</b> asking me to be employed there, I was delighted." [...] His first match in the dugout alongside Sturrock ended in disappointment as Argyle lost 3–1 to Bristol City at Ashton Gate. They faced Ipswich Town, another side struggling for form, at home in their next match and a first-half goal from Fletcher put Argyle ahead, but their hopes of claiming three points were dented when the visitors equalised through striker Jon Stead, who capitalised on a poor back pass from Gary Sawyer. Welshman Darcy Blake, on loan from Cardiff City, was shown a straight red card late in the game as it ended all square. Their final game of October took place on Halloween against Middlesbrough, in Gordon Strachan's first game as their new manager. Argyle came away from the Riverside Stadium with all three points, in a game that saw Adam Johnson miss from the penalty spot, thanks to a second-half goal from Mackie to lift them to 22nd in the league table, within three points of Doncaster Rovers.|$|E
2500|$|On June 25, 2009, American {{recording}} artist, Michael Jackson, {{died from}} cardiac arrest {{at the age}} of 50, later revealed to be from a drug intoxication of the anesthetic drug Propofol (also known as [...] "Diprivan"). Jackson was friends with musicians Chris Brown, Diddy, Boyz II Men and The Game. Aside from being friends with some of the musicians involved on the song, others involved had also respected and admired Jackson. According to The Game, prior to Jackson's death Jackson, Diddy and Eminem had tried to end the feuding and tension between rapper 50 Cent and The Game in 2005. The Game stated that in 2005, Jackson called him and offered to help end the feud, remembering [...] "I was on tour in Canada, sitting in my room, cutting my hair [...] I was messing my hair up.

40|$|Self-management {{techniques}} {{have a long}} history in behavior analysis (Skinner, 1967). More than anything else, my passion for the field was prompted by Skinner’s devotion to managing his own behavior. When I wanted to lose weight, it was only natural to resort to the same methods. Malott and Harrison’s (2005) workbook “I’ll Stop Procrastinating…When I Get Around to It ” offers many examples of self-management techniques, and served as a starting point in my quest to lose weight. Tracking the amount of calories consumed and minutes of exercise performed are direct measures of behaviors necessary for weight loss, but I decided to simply track my weight and post the results publicly each week. I began by constructing a graph template with weight on the ordinate, 52 weeks on the abscissa, and a bold horizontal line in-tersecting at my goal (179 lbs). The goal was determined by referring to a BMI of healthy weights, using height, body type, and sex. A title across the top read, “Dr. Clayton’s Weight ” in large type. The graph was posted <b>on</b> <b>my</b> office <b>door</b> in the Psychology depart-ment where both colleagues and students could see it. At the same day and time each week, I added my weight to the graph and connected the line. The graph then went back <b>on</b> <b>my</b> office <b>door</b> for all to see. As {{can be seen in the}} Figure, this simple proce-dure was very effective and has been maintained for over two years (currently in the third year) ...|$|R

My flaxen hair was plaited German-wise, and tied in two thumping pigtails with a green ribbon; I stood and looked at him. He fumblingly folded his hands in front of him as he stood and looked back at me. I was quivering like a flame in a lamp. And never have I been so much flattered as by the silly, stupefied stare on his face.|$|R

Thats how we first got acquainted. I came into this work with Mr. Graham in 1947 after we had exchanged letters and talked on the phone. He said he wanted me to be his gospel singer. I thanked him but told him the only gospel singers Ive ever heard about would sing a verse or two and stop and talk a while. Would I have to do that? I asked him. He chuckled and said, I hope not. With that, I said, Well, Id like to come with you. That was in November of 1947 and Ive been with him ever since." ...|$|R
