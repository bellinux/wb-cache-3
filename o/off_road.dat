5|$|The tornado {{touched down}} at 6:18p.m. CST (00:18UTC) near Castleberry High School {{northwest}} of downtown Fort Worth. Initially, the tornado lacked a condensation funnel, and {{could only be}} visually identified as dust swirls near the ground beneath the rotating wall cloud aloft; the tornado maintained this appearance {{for the first five}} minutes of its lifespan, after which a condensation funnel eventually developed. The first signs of damage occurred in the River Oaks area along Texas State Highway 183 where metal roof panels were stripped off of a vacant fast food restaurant. After crossing the highway, the tornado inflicted sporadic F0damage to an older residential area, breaking tree branches and causing some damage to outbuildings; a few chimneys were toppled off of homes. At the time, the tornado's damage path was only a few hundred feet wide. A roof of a home near Roberts Cut <b>Off</b> <b>Road</b> was partially removed, signifying the first instance of F1damage. Several large and rotted trees were uprooted by the tornado's strong winds as it moved through the area. The tornado then passed directly over Castleberry High School, causing significant damage to the school's field house. Tornadic debris—including rooftop air conditioning units, gravel, and other detached construction—was thrown by the tornado at the school's western façade, causing minor damage. Throughout River Oak, three homes sustained major damage while 51others experienced minor damage.|$|E
25|$|The FJ debuted to both {{criticism}} and acclaim from the automotive press.

The <b>off</b> <b>road</b> community widely embraced the new addition of another Toyota <b>off</b> <b>road</b> vehicle and many different groups and forums were created specifically with the FJ Cruiser at their center.|$|E

25|$|Regional Clubs in the UK {{break down}} into two groups, {{competitive}} and non-competitive. The non-competitive clubs activities generally relate to social events, <b>off</b> <b>road</b> driving or green laning on un-surfaced public highways or 'pay and play' days at <b>off</b> <b>road</b> centres. Competitive clubs are a phenomenon almost exclusively {{found within the}} UK, who {{as well as the}} non-competitive activities detailed above run competitive events such as Tyro, Road Taxed Vehicle (RTV) and Cross Country Vehicle (CCV) trials, winch and recovery challenges or speed events such as Competitive Safaries. All UK competitive events are run within the framework of rules created by the Motor Sports Association (MSA) with further vehicle specific rules applied by the host club or association. Outside of the UK regional clubs are independent and mostly non-competitive.|$|E

25|$|Though {{all this}} it still {{remained}} {{the larger of}} the two major bodies. The ABA has demonstrated over the years the desire to become even larger. In a plan to diversify and not rely on its BMX income totally for its survival, the ABA purchased the National <b>Off</b> <b>Road</b> Bicycle Association (NORBA) in the summer of 1986 (The ABA later sold NORBA to the United States Cycling Federation (USCF) in 1989). It also acquired from Hutch Hi-Performance Products, a respected BMX bicycle manufacturer, the National Freestyle Association (NFA) a BMX Freestyle sanctioning body. Hutch had recently reacquired the body back from the USBA which it had sold it to a few months prior. Hutch, which had started the NFA in the first place, sold it to the USBA because competing manufactures were reluctant to send their freestyle teams to a sanctioning body run by a competitor, therefore helping him financially. The USBA suffering its own financial dire straits sold it back to Hutch who in turn sold it to the ABA.|$|E

500|$|Listed by {{video game}} reviewers {{as one of}} Rare's first {{successful}} NES titles, R.C. Pro-Am was well-received for its visuals, sound, gameplay, and enjoyability. The game distanced itself from earlier racing titles by using an overhead, instead of a first-person, perspective. Reviews have cited it as inspiration for future games such as Super <b>Off</b> <b>Road,</b> Rock n' Roll Racing, and the Mario Kart series. It has appeared in many [...] "top games of all time" [...] lists and is {{regarded as one of}} the best titles in the NES library.

500|$|The Anasazi ruins were {{constructed}} in Anza-Borrego Desert State Park. Location manager Mac Gordon later noted that, {{due to the}} presence of a rare [...] "spiny black horned toad" [...] in the area, he and his crew were forced to hire several biologists to locate any lizards in the area and move them elsewhere. In addition, Gordon had a difficult time persuading the park rangers to build and then blow up faux-ruins. He explained, [...] "we were on a state park property that was an <b>off</b> <b>road</b> park, with motorcycles and [...] flying all over the place, but they still blanched when I said we have to build Indian ruins and then blow it up." [...] However, the cameo of The Smoking Man was filmed on a sound stage back at 20th Century Fox. Manners noted that Davis had [...] "a hell of a time" [...] trying to smoke his cigarettes through a hole in his neck, because the hole was fake. The scene featuring The Smoking Man being burnt up by the fire from a missile was done via computer animation. The missiles were created via CGI technology by animator Mat Beck. The helicopter, however, included real smoke bombs. A shot of William B. Davis was overlapped with fire, and eventually a skull to give the effect that The Smoking Man's flesh was burnt away. Paul Rabwin later called the scene a [...] "great sequence".|$|E
500|$|R.C. Pro-Am has {{appeared}} many times on various [...] "best games" [...] lists over the years.

Game Informer put the game at number 84 on its [...] "Top100 Games of All Time" [...] list in August2001. Paste magazine placed it as the 8th greatest NES game ever, {{saying that it is}} [...] "way more fun than real remote-control cars, which never seemed to be equipped with missile capabilities". IGN listed the game as the 13th-best NES game of all time, citing its popularity amongst players as well as good sales. Executive Editor Craig Harris said {{that it was one of}} the first games to introduce the concept of vehicular combat, inspiring other titles such as Super R.C. Pro-Am, R.C. Pro-AmII, and the Mario Kart series. 1UP.com listed it as the 14th best NES title, citing the game's good graphics and gameplay elements, though it said that the difficulty level was too high. As with other retrospectives, the website staff listed the game as inspiration for future series such as Super <b>Off</b> <b>Road</b> and Rock n' Roll Racing. In a look back at Rare as part of the company's 25th anniversary, GamePro listed R.C. Pro-Am as one of Rare's best games, calling the release [...] "one of Rare's finest moments". The NES version of R.C. Pro-Am is one of the 30 games selected for the upcoming Xbox One compilation Rare Replay.|$|E
