Enrolment grew from 1,089students upon his arrival in 1961 to 5,503students on his departure in 1971. In 1959, there were two degrees and five programs available; in 1969–70 there were seven degrees and 45programs. There were 94graduate students in 1961; the first master's programs were offered in 1967, and by 1969 the number of graduate students had risen to 741. In 1969 alone, 80new faculty members were hired, a number larger than the total number <b>of</b> <b>faculty</b> <b>members</b> a decade earlier. Several new buildings were constructed, including nine dormitories and five academic buildings. Policy changes occurred as well: in 1966, the curfew for junior and senior women was abolished, and fraternities and sororities were allowed on campus. In 1970, Boyd was named the University System of Georgia's first vice chancellor for academic development, effective once his successor (Emory graduate Ward B. Pafford) was appointed in 1971.|$|E

40|$|The American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy (AACP) has {{identified}} faculty retention {{as a top}} concern since 76 colleges of pharmacy reported a total of 406 vacant and/or lost positions in the 2004 - 2005 academic year. Since today's junior <b>faculty</b> <b>members</b> are tomorrow's leaders in pharmacy education, retention <b>of</b> quality <b>faculty</b> <b>members</b> is critical to our future.

However, in the last decade, the disproportionate increase <b>of</b> junior <b>faculty</b> <b>members</b> to the number <b>of</b> senior <b>faculty</b> <b>members</b> employed has resulted in a major limitation of the dyad (mentor and protégé) mentoring process. One effective method of overcoming this limitation is the use of the triad mentoring model (organization, mentor, and protégé). Colleges of pharmacy that consider adopting this triad model will likely promote an environment that nurtures relationships, resulting in job satisfaction, and thereby leading to retention <b>of</b> junior <b>faculty</b> <b>members...</b>|$|R

40|$|While {{there is}} {{significant}} interest in improving university-industry interaction, literature on the university side has tended not {{to focus on the}} characteristics of the personnel involved and has largely ignored the issue that there are differences between types <b>of</b> <b>faculty</b> <b>member</b> in their degrees of interaction. This question is especially relevant at regional level, as those <b>faculty</b> <b>members</b> who do interact with industry may show a preference for firms that are larger and technologically superior to those in the region. Most analysts, though, have tended to focus on the national level, particularly on those countries at the forefront of technological innovation. In the absence of any formal theory, we propose a two-step method to formulate the hypothesis that only selected <b>faculty</b> <b>members</b> interact with selected firms. First, we identify the type <b>of</b> <b>faculty</b> <b>member</b> who interacts with firms. Second, we examine whether this type <b>of</b> <b>faculty</b> <b>member</b> interacts with every type of firm. A test sample is drawn from the Valencian Community of Spain, a region with low absorptive capacity, where firms may show undesirable properties for university interaction. The results allow us to challenge the view that certain individual universities may show a higher propensity for interaction once we take into account differences between the individual characteristics <b>of</b> their <b>faculty</b> <b>members.</b> We also claim that in a region like the Valencian Community, <b>faculty</b> <b>members</b> who usually participate in contracts (male, holding an administrative position) do so mainly with larger firms, but not with firms from their own region, where they find lower technological standards. This partly explains the delocalisation of university-industry interaction. JRC. J. 3 -Knowledge for Growt...|$|R

25|$|This {{sophisticated}} form of hazing {{was played}} out {{each year in}} September. This elaborate hoax often gained the cooperation <b>of</b> <b>faculty</b> <b>members</b> {{and people in the}} town. During Freshman Week, the first-year students were informed about several student romances on campus through planned gossip. The story went that there was one ardent couple who were constantly together when not in class, but the girl had another upperclassman admirer. The couple argued over the love triangle and it ended in the girl walking off with her new boy. After that, there were public acts that involved the two boys fighting. The affair was all anyone would talk about. Then on a certain pre-arranged night, all freshmen were ordered to stay in their rooms by student governing bodies. At 10 pm, a drunk ex-boyfriend appeared at the men's dorm. He brandished a gun and staggered through the halls in search of his rival. He finally found him in one of the public archways of the building. Soon, several shots rang out and the victim fell to the floor with blood (ketchup) flowing from his mouth. Other upperclassmen took charge, sending confused and panicked freshmen in pursuit of the killer or for a doctor. A town physician would appear and call for an ambulance, only adding to the theatrics of the evening. Most other freshmen were rounded up and sent in groups to nearby hospitals to offer their blood for transfusion, but were left stranded. At the same time, the freshmen girls witnessed the girl in the triangle see the unconscious victim being taken away and go into a fit of hysterics. During the 1930s, a member of the staff was a Justice of the Peace. He presided over a fake hearing in a large classroom where freshman girls tearfully testified to what they thought they saw happen on campus that night. It was during that hearing that the truth was revealed when the three main actors walked into the room, arm in arm. The next day, the freshmen felt young and foolish, but were looking forward to the next year when they were able to play the same prank on new freshmen. The tradition died in 1946, when its last performance narrowly escaped tragedy when some ex-servicemen studying at LVC under the G.I. Bill threatened {{to take care of the}} villain causing trouble between the lovers.|$|E

[...] Meanwhile, Robert P. George, a conservative Catholic professor at Esolen's alma mater, Princeton University, defended him.

The Union of Concerned Scientists was founded on March 4, 1969 during a meeting <b>of</b> <b>faculty</b> <b>members</b> and students seeking to shift the emphasis on military research toward environmental and social problems.
