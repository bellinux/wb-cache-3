5|$|The {{number of}} works {{attributed}} to the trobairitz is estimated at thirty-two songs, but ranges anywhere from 23 to 46. There are a number <b>of</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> an exact number is not known. In the courtly love tradition it was common for poems to be written as an exchange of letters, or a debate, as in a tenso. Some of these may have been originally written by one poet; however, some were originally an actual exchange of epistles, later gathered together in a manuscript. Some of these were between men, and some were {{between a man and}} a woman. Some modern editors attribute these solely to the man who originated the exchange, and some attribute them to both the man and the woman involved. There is a long history of attributing these solely to men, even when all evidence points to the contrary.|$|E

Patients need to be told of the importance of taking their tablets regularly, and the importance of completing treatment, because of the risk of relapse or drug-resistance developing otherwise.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, losses (especially in {{aircraft}} {{as opposed to}} personnel) are sometimes recorded inaccurately, for various reasons.

25|$|Nobility's marriages became restricted: generally, only a noblewoman was {{eligible}} for valid marriage of a nobleman {{in order to}} transmit the noble status to children. Because before 17th-century mass ennoblements, the number of nobles was actually only in hundreds, daughters of lower nobility became more often brides for wealthy Swedish noble families and even for magnate families. This was one <b>of</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> many Swedish family of high nobility got also one or more Finnish foremothers (a phenomenon very rare in medieval centuries when already geography {{was a sort of}} obstacle).

Fifty-two percent of Egyptian female workers have their own business ventures. Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Indonesia have {{the highest rates of}} female self-employment with 86.7%, 77.9%, and 68.3%, respectively. Very few women are involved in the formal labor market in Pakistan but more than three fourths of them are self-employed.

25|$|The {{letter was}} most {{probably}} written while Paul was in Corinth, probably {{while he was}} staying {{in the house of}} Gaius, and transcribed by Tertius his amanuensis. There are a number <b>of</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> Corinth is considered most plausible. Paul was about to travel to Jerusalem on writing the letter, which matches Acts where it is reported that Paul stayed for three months in Greece. This probably implies Corinth as it was the location of Paul’s greatest missionary success in Greece. Additionally Phoebe was a deacon of the church in Cenchreae, a port to the east of Corinth, and {{would have been able to}} convey the letter to Rome after passing through Corinth and taking a ship from Corinth’s west port. Erastus, mentioned in , also lived in Corinth, being the city's commissioner for public works and city treasurer at various times, again indicating that the letter was written in Corinth.|$|E
25|$|While {{some teams}} have enjoyed {{considerable}} on-field and even financial success, many {{teams in the}} history of the league have enjoyed little success either on or off of the field of play. There were a number of franchises which existed in the form of a series of largely-unrelated teams with little to no continuity of either coaching staffs or players under numerous management groups until they folded. One example of several which could be cited is the New York CityHawks, whose owners transferred the team from New York City to Hartford to become the New England Sea Wolves after two seasons, then after another two seasons were sold and became the Toronto Phantoms, which lasted another two seasons until folding. There are a number <b>of</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> these teams failed, including financially weak ownership groups, lack of deep financial support from some owners otherwise capable of providing it, lack of media exposure, and the host city's evident lack of interest in its team or the sport as a whole.|$|E

25|$|One might further {{hypothesize that}} the {{experimental}} treatment regulates cholesterol, because the treatment seems to selectively regulate genes associated with cholesterol. While {{this may be}} true, {{there are a number}} <b>of</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> making this a firm conclusion based on enrichment alone represents an unwarranted leap of faith. One previously mentioned issue {{has to do with the}} observation that gene regulation may have no direct impact on protein regulation: even if the proteins coded for by these genes do nothing other than make cholesterol, showing that their mRNA is altered does not directly tell us what is happening at the protein level. It is quite possible that the amount of these cholesterol-related proteins remains constant under the experimental conditions. Second, even if protein levels do change, perhaps there is always enough of them around to make cholesterol as fast as it can be possibly made, that is, another protein, not on our list, is the rate determining step in the process of making cholesterol. Finally, proteins typically play many roles, so these genes may be regulated not because of their shared association with making cholesterol but because of a shared role in a completely independent process.|$|E
500|$|In January 1998, 16-year-old Mario Padilla and his 14-year-old cousin, Samuel Ramirez stabbed Mario's mother, Gina Castillo, 45 times, killing her. The case {{became known}} as the [...] "Scream murder" [...] and fell under intense media {{scrutiny}} after the boys claimed they were inspired by Scream and Scream 2. The pair confessed to needing the money acquired from Gina's murder to fund a killing spree, which would include purchasing two Ghostface costumes, as well as a voice-changer used by the character in the film. During their trial, psychologist Madeline Levine who studied the effect of violence on children, stated, [...] "There were a whole bunch <b>of</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> they acted out that way. But did the movie provide a blueprint? Absolutely." [...] The case was expected to highlight the effect of violent films on teenagers. [...] However, presiding judge John Cheroske ordered that evidence pertaining to Scream be barred and that the case not be referred to as the [...] "Scream murder", refusing media access to the courtroom, intending that the case was tried as murder and nothing else.|$|E

[...] Hedren alleged in Spoto's 2009 book, Spellbound by Beauty: Alfred Hitchcock and His Leading Ladies, that Hitchcock actually asked her to [...] "make myself sexually available and accessible to him – however and whenever and wherever he wanted." [...] Spoto was the first person Hedren told her story to. She said: [...] "It was embarrassing and insulting—there were a lot <b>of</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> I didn’t want to tell the story. I didn’t want it to be taken advantage of, twisted, turned and made into an even uglier situation than it was. It wasn’t until years later that I told Donald the story. (...) He is absolutely true and honest in this book." [...] She previously said, in 1973, while Hitchcock was still alive, that a major life-style difference caused a split in their relationship. [...] "He was too possessive and too demanding. I cannot be possessed by anyone. But, then, that's my own hangup." ...|$|E

Luongo handled his demotion with class and remained supportive of Schneider, soon calling the Canucks [...] "Cory's team." [...] Head coach Alain Vigneault said [...] "Cory is our MVP and one <b>of</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> we got into playoffs. I've {{got a lot of}} faith in him and that's why we're going with him". In the opening playoff round facing the San Jose Sharks, as Schneider had been injured {{near the end of the}} regular season, Luongo started the first two games and played well but his team lost both. Luongo came off the bench in game three after Schneider was pulled in the third period. Luongo was the backup in game four as the Canucks lost in overtime, ending his team's postseason in four straight games. Luongo put his penthouse up for sale, as it was accepted that he had played his final game as a Canuck. Although he had nine years left on a 12-year, $64-million contract, which represented a $5.33 million salary cap hit, general manager Mike Gillis remained confident of making a deal in the summer.|$|E
500|$|Former {{executives}} at Sega have mixed {{opinions of the}} 32X.

[...] Franz places the 32X's commercial failure on its inability to function without an attached Genesis and lack of a CD drive, despite its compatibility with the Sega CD, stating, [...] "The 32X was destined to die because it didn't have a CD drive and was an add-on. [...] An add-on device is never as well thought out as a built-from-scratch device." [...] Miller, on the other hand, remembers the 32X positively, stating, [...] "I think the 32X actually was an interesting, viable platform. The timing was wrong, and certainly our ability to stick with it, given what we did with Saturn, was severely limited. There were a whole bunch <b>of</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> we couldn’t ultimately do what we had to do with that platform, without third party support and with the timing of Saturn, but I still think the project was a success for a bunch of other reasons.
