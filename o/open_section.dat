5|$|The <b>open</b> <b>section</b> of {{the tournament}} was contested by {{a record number of}} 180 teams {{representing}} 175 nations. Azerbaijan, as host nation, fielded three teams, whilst the International Braille Chess Association (IBCA), the International Physically Disabled Chess Association (IPCA), and the International Chess Committee of the Deaf (ICCD) each provided one team.|$|E
5|$|The {{total number}} of {{participants}} was 1,587, with 894 in the Open and 693 in the Women's event. The number of registered teams was 180 from 175 countries in the <b>Open</b> <b>section</b> and 142 from 138 countries in the Women's section. Both sections set team participation records. Eritrea, Kosovo, and South Sudan competed in the tournament for the first time. The venue of the Chess Olympiad was the Baku Crystal Hall. The Chief Arbiter of the event was Azerbaijan's International Arbiter Faiq Hasanov.|$|E
5|$|The final {{part of the}} {{ceremony}} was marked with the drawing of lots. It was assisted by Vladimir Kramnik and Hou Yifan as the highest-rated players of the highest-ranked teams in the open and women's event, respectively, who joined the Chief Arbiter Faiq Hasanov for the drawing of colours. The draw resulted in Hou picking the White pieces, meaning that all players in the women's section with odd board numbers (1 or 3) will be White in the first round; and Kramnik picking the Black pieces, meaning that all players in the <b>open</b> <b>section</b> with odd board numbers (1 or 3) will have the Black pieces in the opening round.|$|E

5|$|The tournament {{featured}} {{eight out}} of the top ten players from the FIDE rating list published in August 2016; only former World Champion Vishwanathan Anand and Levon Aronian were missing the Olympiad. Among the players who were playing in the <b>open</b> <b>section</b> were the World Champion and highest rated player in the world Magnus Carlsen, the challenger in the World Chess Championship 2016 Sergey Karjakin as well as the former World Champions Vladimir Kramnik and Veselin Topalov. Grandmaster Eugenio Torre was in the line-up of the Philippines for the record twenty-third time, having played on each Chess Olympiad since 1970 except in Dresden in 2008. On the other hand, Ukraine were weaker for missing Vassily Ivanchuk, who did not play for the first time after 14 consecutive Olympiads (1988–2014) and 13 appearances on board one (1990–2014). The former World Champion Challenger and leader of the Israeli team in 8 consecutive Olympiads (2000–2014) Boris Gelfand was also missing the Olympiad following a conflict with the Israeli Chess Federation management.|$|E

25|$|A {{total number}} of 1,570 players participated at the Olympiad, with 881 in the men and 689 in the women's section.

The main competitive events were held at Mackhallen. The Chief Arbiter of the event was Greece's International Arbiter Panagiotis Nikolopoulos.

25|$|At its {{northern}} end, the ECR (A12) follows {{part of the}} route of the former North London Railway between the closed Victoria Park and Old Ford stations. The railway junction at Victoria Park, where the still <b>open</b> <b>section</b> of the North London Line to Stratford station diverged, was reconstructed to permit the construction of the junction with the non-dual carriageway section of the A102 and the A106 and A115 roads, above which the line passes. The branch track to the docks that ran alongside the ECR to Old Ford, which had been used only for freight since the 1940s, was subsequently closed and lifted in the early 1980s.|$|E

25|$|When a simply {{supported}} beam is loaded in flexure, the top side is in compression, and the bottom side is in tension. If the beam is not supported in the lateral direction (i.e., perpendicular to the plane of bending), and the flexural load increases to a critical limit, the beam will experience a lateral deflection of the compression flange. The lateral deflection of the compression flange is restrained by the beam web and tension flange, but for an <b>open</b> <b>section</b> the twisting mode is more flexible, hence the beam both twists and deflects laterally in a failure mode known as lateral-torsional buckling. In wide-flange sections (with high lateral bending stiffness), the deflection mode will be mostly twisting in torsion. In narrow-flange sections, the bending stiffness is lower and the column's deflection will be closer to that of lateral bucking deflection mode.|$|E

The tunneling cost NOK370 million, including the <b>open</b> <b>section</b> between Solstad and Åstad, but excluding superstructure. The {{main part of the}} tunnel was built using the drilling and blasting method, using two points of entry. [...] Work on the tunneling started in 2002 and was concluded in February 2004. Construction included the removal of [...] of earthwork and the laying of [...] of ballast. Laying of tracks, signaling, power supply and other superstructures were done by Baneservice. The cost of superstructures for the entire section from Asker to Sandvika was NOK70 million. The work was completed by November 2004.
