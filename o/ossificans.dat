Isotretinoin has been used to treat the extremely rare condition fibrodysplasia <b>ossificans</b> progressiva. It is also used for treatment of neuroblastoma, a form of nerve cancer.|$|E
2500|$|During this period, {{like most}} amateur triathletes, {{she had also}} {{continued}} entering running races. She had previously run the London Marathon for charity in 2002, finishing in 3:08:17, making her the fastest woman from her running club in that race. That result prompted her to get a running coach, Frank Horwill – whom she regarded as [...] "legendary and ever inspiring" [...] – and to take her running training much more seriously. She had hoped to improve her marathon time in the April 2003 London Marathon, but in March she collided with a car while riding her commuter bike in Clapham. The accident resulted in a haematoma in her left thigh, causing – in an example of myositis <b>ossificans</b> – a 5cm spur of bone to grow from her femur. Unable to run the marathon, she took up swimming again, leading her to try triathlon racing in 2004. After her ITU victory, she took up cross-country racing for the first time, {{as a means of}} building strength for her triathlon races. She enjoyed some success in B and C grade cross-country events around London, winning several races including the South of Thames Championship in December 2006.|$|E
5000|$|The term {{myositis}} <b>ossificans</b> traumatica {{is sometimes}} used when {{the condition is}} due to trauma. Also Myositis <b>ossificans</b> circumscripta is another synonym of myositis <b>ossificans</b> traumatica refers to the new extraosseous bone that appears after trauma.|$|E

5000|$|The second condition, {{myositis}} <b>ossificans</b> progressiva (also {{referred to}} as fibrodysplasia <b>ossificans</b> progressiva) is an inherited affliction, autosomal dominant pattern, in which the ossification can occur without injury, and typically grows in a predictable pattern. Although this disorder can be passed to offspring by those afflicted with FOP, it is also classified as nonhereditary, as it is most often attributed to a spontaneous genetic mutation upon conception.|$|E

50|$|The {{differential}} diagnosis includes many tumoral and nontumoral pathologies. A {{main concern is}} to differentiate early myositis <b>ossificans</b> from malignant soft-tissue tumors, and the latter is suggested by a fast-growing process. If clinical or sonographic findings are dubious and extraosseous sarcoma is suspected, biopsy should be performed. At histology, detection of the typical zonal phenomenon is diagnostic of myositis <b>ossificans,</b> though microscopic findings may be misleading during the early stage.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are many}} other rare causes of torticollis. A very rare cause of {{acquired}} torticollis is fibrodysplasia <b>ossificans</b> progressiva (FOP), the hallmark of which is malformed great toes.|$|E
50|$|The {{radiological}} {{features of}} myositis <b>ossificans</b> are ‘faint soft tissue calcification within 2-6 weeks, (may have well-definedbony margins by 8 weeks) separated from periosteum by lucent zone and on CT, the characteristic feature is peripheral ossification’.|$|E
50|$|The International Fibrodysplasia <b>Ossificans</b> Progressiva Association (IFOPA) is a US-based 501(c)(3) {{non-profit}} organization supporting medical research, education and communication for those afflicted by the rare genetic condition Fibrodysplasia <b>Ossificans</b> Progressiva (FOP). IFOPA’s {{mission is to}} fund research {{to find a cure}} for FOP while supporting, connecting, and advocating for individuals with FOP and their families, and raising awareness worldwide. IFOPA is governed by a volunteer board of directors which may range in number from 9 to 15, at least one of whom must have FOP. The association's location is 1520 Clay St., Suite H2, North Kansas City, MO, 64116, part of the Kansas City, Missouri metropolitan area.|$|E
50|$|For the <b>ossificans</b> {{form of the}} condition, {{unenhanced}} CT may better {{show the}} presence and extent of arachnoid ossifications, and is complementary to MRI, as MRI can be less specific and findings can be confused with regions of calcification or hemosiderin.|$|E
50|$|Palovarotene is {{a highly}} {{selective}} retinoic acid receptor gamma (RAR-γ) agonist that is under investigation as a potential treatment for fibrodysplasia <b>ossificans</b> progressiva (FOP), an ultra-rare and severely disabling genetic disease characterized by extra-skeletal bone formation (heterotopic ossification or HO) in muscle and soft tissues.|$|E
5000|$|In the first, and by far {{most common}} type, nonhereditary {{myositis}} <b>ossificans</b> (commonly referred to simply as [...] "myositis ossificans", {{as in the}} remainder of this article), calcifications occur at the site of injured muscle, most commonly in the arms or in the quadriceps of the thighs.|$|E
5000|$|Calcification {{of muscle}} can occur after {{traumatic}} injury {{and is known}} as myositis <b>ossificans.</b> It can be recognized by muscle tenderness and loss of stretch in the affected area. To {{reduce the risk of}} calcification after an injury, initiate what is commonly known as [...] "RICE" [...] (rest, ice, compression, and elevation).|$|E
50|$|FOP Friends, {{formerly}} Friends of Oliver, is {{a registered}} charity in the United Kingdom established on 1 March 2012. It aims to raise funds that are needed to find effective treatments for the rare genetic condition Fibrodysplasia <b>Ossificans</b> Progressiva (FOP). The charity also works to raise awareness and understanding of FOP amongst medical communities and the general public.|$|E
50|$|It is also {{somewhat}} {{effective for}} hidradenitis suppurativa and some cases of severe acne rosacea.

50|$|A {{large number}} of {{conditions}} may cause symptoms and signs similar to diabetic myonecrosis and include: deep vein thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, cellulitis, fasciitis, abscess, haematoma, myositis, pseudothrombophlebitis (ruptured synovial cyst), pyomyositis, parasitic myositis, osteomyelitis, calcific myonecrosis, myositis <b>ossificans,</b> diabetic myotrophy, muscle strain or rupture, bursitis, vasculitis, arterial occlusion, haemangioma, lymphoedema, sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, cat-scratch disease, amyloidosis, as well as tumours of lipoma, chondroma, fibroma, leiomyoma and sarcoma.|$|E
50|$|In a game {{versus the}} Boston Bruins during the 1991 Stanley Cup Playoffs, Samuelsson hit Bruins' star forward Cam Neely {{with a body}} check that injured Neely and caused him to develop a {{condition}} called myositis <b>ossificans,</b> which ultimately ended his career. Many Bruins fans still consider {{this to be a}} deliberate play. It was partially responsible for shortening Neely's hall of fame career.|$|E
50|$|Medical reports {{describing}} individuals {{affected by}} FOP date {{back as far}} as the seventeenth century. FOP was originally called myositis <b>ossificans</b> progressiva and was thought to be caused by muscular inflammation (myositis) that caused bone formation. The disease was renamed by Victor A. McKusick in 1970 following the discovery that soft tissue other than muscles (e.g., ligaments) were also affected by the disease process.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} rare genetic {{disorders}} causing heterotopic ossification such as fibrodysplasia <b>ossificans</b> progressiva (FOP), {{a condition that}} causes injured bodily tissues {{to be replaced by}} heterotopic bone. Characteristically exhibiting in the big toe at birth, it causes the formation of heterotopic bone throughout the body {{over the course of the}} sufferer's life, causing chronic pain and eventually leading to the immobilisation and fusion of most of the skeleton by abnormal growths of bone.|$|E
50|$|In {{traumatic}} heterotopic ossification (traumatic myositis <b>ossificans),</b> {{the patient}} may complain of a warm, tender, firm swelling in a muscle and decreased {{range of motion}} in the joint served by the muscle involved. There is often a history of a blow or other trauma to the area {{a few weeks to}} a few months earlier. Patients with traumatic neurological injuries, severe neurologic disorders or severe burns who develop heterotopic ossification experience limitation of motion in the areas affected.|$|E
