This feature allowed for the image being displayed on the television screen to be zoomed into, by <b>overscanning</b> the raster of the CRT so that {{the middle of the}} image would be displayed.|$|R
50|$|The {{advantage}} of a 720 × 480i <b>overscanned</b> computer was an easy interface with interlaced TV production, leading {{to the development of}} Newtek's Video Toaster. This device allowed Amigas to be used for CGI creation in various news departments (example: weather overlays), drama programs such as NBC's seaQuest, WB's Babylon 5, and early computer-generated animation by Disney for The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin.|$|R
2500|$|The {{earliest}} Amiga 500 models use {{nearly the}} same Original Amiga chipset as the Amiga 1000. So graphics can be displayed in multiple resolutions and color depths, even on the same screen. Resolutions vary from 320×200 (up to 32 colors) to 640×200 (up to 16 colors) for NTSC (704×484 <b>overscan)</b> and 320×256 to 640×256 for PAL (704×576 <b>overscan.)</b> The system uses planar graphics, with up to five bitplanes (four in high resolution) allowing 2-, 4-, 8-, 16-, and 32-color screens, from a palette of 4096 colors. Two special graphics modes are also available: Extra HalfBrite, which uses a 6th bitplane as a mask to cut the brightness of any pixel in half (resulting in 32 arbitrary colors plus 32 more colors set at half {{the value of the}} first 32), and [...] which allows all 4096 colors to be used on screen simultaneously. Later revisions of the chipset are PAL/NTSC switchable in software.|$|E
50|$|Different {{video and}} {{broadcast}} television systems require differing amounts of <b>overscan.</b> Most figures serve as recommendations or typical summaries, as {{the nature of}} <b>overscan</b> is to overcome a variable limitation in older technologies such as cathode ray tubes.|$|E

50|$|Virtually all {{the designs}} and {{patterns}} on the card have some significance. Along the top (see above) are 95% saturation colour-bars in descending order of luminance—white, yellow, cyan, green, magenta, red, blue and black. There are triangles {{on each of the}} four sides of the card to check for correct <b>overscanning</b> of the picture. Standard greyscale and frequency response tests are found on the left and right respectively of the central picture. On the updated Test Card J, the X on the noughts-and-crosses board is an indicator for aligning the centre of the screen.|$|R
50|$|The window {{addressable}} area {{should always}} be within the Safe-Title area, so that all addressable locations are within the display window if the monitor <b>overscans</b> the image onto a non-rectangular screen. If the video stream has a 16:9 aspect ratio the addresses {{should be in the}} range 0..74 for the vertical addresses, and 0..209 for the horizontal addresses. If the video stream has a 4:3 aspect ratio the addresses should be in the range 0..74 for the vertical addresses, and 0..159 for the horizontal addresses. For other aspect ratios relative addressing should be used and both vertical and horizontal addresses should be in the range 0..99%.|$|R
50|$|Some Professional video {{broadcast}} monitors display information on screen, the current video signal format, {{they might be}} receiving i.e.: standard definition formats like 576i, 480i or high definition formats like 720p or 1080p. They also have mechanical buttons to toggle common aspect ratios like (4:3 or 16:9), and underscanning or <b>overscanning</b> a picture to see lines in the vertical blanking interval (VBI) of video, and check if subtitles in VBI were inserted properly or not. Modern broadcast grade professional monitors also have safe area grid generators, to help position television graphics, lower thirds, within their respective areas i.e. graphics safe, title safe or action safe.|$|R
50|$|The {{vertical}} display resolutions for HAM8 are {{the same}} as for HAM6. The horizontal resolution can be 320 (360 with <b>overscan)</b> as before, doubled to 640 (720 with <b>overscan)</b> or even quadrupled to 1280 pixels (1440 with <b>overscan).</b> The AGA chipset also introduced even higher resolutions for the traditional planar display modes. The total number of pixels in a HAM8 image cannot exceed 829,440 (1440×576) using PAL modes but can exceed 1,310,720 (1280×1024) using third-party display hardware (Indivision AGA flicker-fixer).|$|E

40|$|Overranging or <b>overscanning</b> {{increases}} the dose delivered to patients undergoing helical Computed Tomography examinations. In {{order to reduce}} it, nowadays most of the multidetector tomographs close the X-ray beam aperture at the scan extremes. This technical innovation, usually referred to as dynamic or adaptive collimation, also influences the overranging assessment methods. In particular, the film free approach proposed in previous studies is not suitable for these modern tomographs. The present study aims to introduce a new method of estimating overranging with real time dosimetry, even suitable for tomographs equipped with adaptive collimation. The approach proposed {{is very easy to}} implement and time saving because only a pencil chamber is required. It is also equivalent in precision and in accuracy to the film based one, considered an absolute benchmark. Comment: 5 figures, 3 table...|$|R
40|$|Large {{areas of}} regular {{diffraction}} nanogratings were produced consisting of so-called laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS) on thin molybdenum layers (< 400 [*][*]nm) deposited on a borosilicate glass substrate. The {{aim was to}} produce these structures without ablating nor cracking the molybdenum layer. Ultra short laser pulses were applied using a focused Gaussian beam profile. Processing parameters such as laser fluence, pulse overlap, number of <b>overscans,</b> repetition frequency, wavelength and polarization were varied to study the effect on periodicity, height, and especially regularity of the obtained LIPSS. It was found that a careful choice of the correct laser parameters is required to avoid detrimental mechanical stresses, cracking, and delamination during the laser processing of the layer {{in order to remain}} in its correct range of ductility as well as to ensure regular LIPSS. A possible photovoltaic application of these nanogratings could be found in texturing of thin film cells to enhance light trapping mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{we studied}} the {{feasibility}} of surface texturing of thin molybdenum layers on a borosilicate glass substrate with Ultra-Short Laser Pulses (USLP). Large areas of regular diffraction gratings were produced consisting of Laserinduced periodic surface structures (LIPSS). A short pulsed laser source (230 fs- 10 ps) was applied using a focused Gaussian beam profile (15 - 30 ?m). Laser parameters such as fluence, overlap (OL) and <b>Overscans</b> (OS), repetition frequency (100 200 kHz), wavelength (1030 nm, 515 nm and 343 nm) and polarization were varied to study the effect on periodicity, height and especially regularity of LIPSS obtained in layers of different thicknesses (150 - 400 nm). The aim was to produce these structures without cracking the metal layer and with as little ablation as possible. It was found that USLP are suitable to reach high power densities at {{the surface of the}} thin layers, avoiding mechanical stresses, cracking and delamination. A possible photovoltaic (PV) application could be found in texturing of thin film cells to enhance light trapping mechanisms.

50|$|Many 1980s 8-bit home {{computers}} feature gutterboxing display mode, because the TV screens normally used as monitors {{at that time}} tended to distort the image near {{the border of the}} screen, {{to such an extent that}} text displayed in that area became illegible. Moreover, due to the <b>overscanned</b> nature of television video, the precise edges of the visible area of the screen varied from television set to television set, so characters near the expected border of the active screen area might be behind the bezel or off the edge of the screen. The Commodore 64, VIC-20, and Commodore 128 (in 40-column mode) featured coloured gutterboxing of the main text window, while the Atari 8-bit family featured a blue text window with a black border. The original IBM PC CGA display adapter was the same, and the monochrome MDA, the predecessor of the CGA, as well as the later EGA and VGA, also featured gutterboxing; this is also called underscanned video. The Fisher-Price PXL-2000 camcorder of the late 1980s recorded a windowboxed image to compensate partially for low resolution.|$|R
40|$|Noninvasive {{coronary}} angiography with multislice computed tomography (CT) scanners is feasible with high sensitivity and negative predictive value. The radiation exposure {{associated with this}} technique, however, is high and concerns in {{the widespread use of}} CT have arisen. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of {{coronary angiography}} using 320 -row CT, which avoids exposure-intensive <b>overscanning</b> and overranging. We prospectively studied 118 unselected consecutive patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) referred for invasive coronary angiography (ICA). All patients had 320 -row CT within 1 week of ICA, which, together with quantitative analysis, served as the reference standard. Of the 65 out of 118 patients who were diagnosed as having CAD by ICA, 64 (98 %) were correctly identified at 320 -row CT. Noteworthy, 320 -row CT correctly detected CAD in 3 patients with atrial fibrillation and ruled out the disease in the other 8 patients. From 151 significant coronary stenoses detected on ICA, 137 (91 %) were correctly identified with 320 -row CT. In the per-patient analysis, sensitivity and specificity of 320 -row CT were 98 and 91 %, respectively. In the per-vessel analysis, sensitivity and specificity of 320 -row CT were 93 and 95 %, respectively. In the per segment analysis, sensitivity and specificity of 320 -row CT were 91 and 99 %, respectively. Diameter stenosis determined with the use of CT showed good correlation with ICA (P < 0. 001, R = 0. 81) without significant underestimation or overestimation (− 3. 1 ± 24. 4 %; P = 0. 08). Comparison of CT with ICA revealed a significantly smaller effective radiation dose (3. 1 ± 2. 3 vs. 6. 5 ± 4. 2 mSv; P < 0. 05) and amount of contrast agent required (99 ± 51 vs. 65 ± 42 ml, P < 0. 05) for 320 row CT. The present study in an unselected population including patients with atrial fibrillation demonstrates that 320 -row CT may significantly reduce the radiation dose and amount of contrast agent required compared with ICA while maintaining a very high diagnostic accuracy...|$|R
5000|$|Analog TV <b>overscan</b> {{can also}} be used for datacasting. The {{simplest}} form of this is closed captioning and teletext, both sent in the vertical blanking interval (VBI). Electronic program guides, such as TV Guide On Screen, are also sent in this manner. Microsoft's HOS uses the horizontal <b>overscan</b> instead of the vertical to transmit low-speed program-associated data at 6.4 kbit/s, which is slow enough to be recorded on a VCR without data corruption. [...] In the U.S., National Datacast used PBS network stations for <b>overscan</b> and other datacasting, but they migrated to digital TV due to the digital television transition in 2009.|$|E
