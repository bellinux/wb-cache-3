25|$|The Tibitoc water {{production}} plant, {{located in}} the suburbs of Bogota, supplies almost 30% of Bogota's residents. To ensure continuous water supply, a rehabilitation project of the water plant and water mains was carried out. This is a 20-year project that began in 1998. An investment of US$22 million over three years was made by Veolia Water Solutions & Technologies to rehabilitate the entire water treatment process including physical pretreatment, coagulation, flocculation, sand filtration, neutralization and disinfection. Additionally, there was an investment of US$35 million to rehabilitate the Tibitoc water production plant water main lines. Other improvements were made to <b>operating</b> <b>guidelines</b> and the monitoring of the facility.|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{the concept of}} an <b>operating</b> <b>guideline</b> for an arbitrary finite-state service P, extending the work of [1, 2] which was restricted to acyclic services. An <b>operating</b> <b>guideline</b> gives complete information about how to correctly (in this paper: deadlock-free) communicate with P. It can further be executed or used for service discovery. An <b>operating</b> <b>guideline</b> for P is a particular service S that is enriched with annotations. S communicates deadlock-free with P and is able to simulate every other service that communicates deadlock-free with P. The attached annotations give complete information about whether or not a simulated service is deadlock-free, too...|$|R

40|$|We study {{services}} modeled as open workflow nets (oWFN) {{and describe}} their behavior as service automata. Based on arbitrary finite-state service automata, we introduce {{the concept of}} an <b>operating</b> <b>guideline,</b> generalizing the work of [1, 2] which was restricted to acyclic services. An <b>operating</b> <b>guideline</b> gives complete information about how to properly interact (in this paper: deadlock-freely and with limited communication) with an oWFN N. It can be executed, thus forming a properly interacting partner of N, or {{it can be used to}} support service discovery. An <b>operating</b> <b>guideline</b> for N is a particular service automaton S that is enriched with Boolean annotations. S interacts properly with the service automaton Prov, representing the behavior of N, and is able to simulate every other service that interacts properly with Prov. The attached annotations give complete information about whether or not a simulated service interacts properly with Prov, too...|$|R
