500|$|Anna Wintour {{attended}} the film's New York premiere, wearing Prada. Her friend Barbara Amiel {{reported that she}} said shortly afterward that the movie would go straight to DVD. But {{in an interview with}} Barbara Walters that aired the day the DVD was released, she called the film [...] "really entertaining" [...] and said she appreciated the [...] "decisive" [...] nature of Streep's portrayal. [...] "Anything that makes fashion entertaining and glamorous and interesting is wonderful for our industry. So I was 100 percent behind it." [...] Streep said Wintour was [...] "probably more upset by the book than the film". Anna Wintourâ€™s popularity skyrocketed after her portrayal in The Devil Wears Prada. She was happy with the portrayal she got from Meryl Streep that did not place her in a position of complete villainy in which she felt was an unfair representation of her. [...] Meryl Streep said she did't base her character in the The Devil Wears Prada on Anna Wintour, instead saying she was inspired by men she had known previously: [...] "Unfortunately you don't have enough women in power, <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> don't know them, to copy." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with the Sheffield University Paper in May 1965, Dylan explained the change that had occurred in his songwriting over the previous twelve months, noting [...] "The big difference is that the songs I was writing last year ... they were what I call one-dimensional songs, but my new songs I'm trying to make more three-dimensional, you know, there's more symbolism, they're written on more than one level." [...] In late 1965, Dylan commented on the writing of [...] "My Back Pages" [...] specifically during {{an interview}} with Margaret Steen for The Toronto Star: [...] "I was in my New York phase then, <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>I</b> was just coming out of it. I was still keeping the things that are really really real out of my songs, for fear they'd be misunderstood. Now I don't care if they are." [...] As Dylan stated to Nat Hentoff at the time that [...] "My Back Pages" [...] and the other songs on Another Side of Bob Dylan were written, [...] "There aren't any finger pointing songs ... Now {{a lot of people are}} doing finger pointing songs. [...] You know, pointing to all the things that are wrong. [...] Me, I don't want to write for people anymore. You know, be a spokesman." ...|$|E

2500|$|.....a pianist {{who appears}} to be {{something}} really quite extraordinary. [...] I had to overcome great resistance in order to go at all, for the description I'd heard from Dr. Hoffmann and from Maurice Zam had made me very skeptical. [...] But I must say that I have never heard such a pianist before...First, [...] he does not play at all in the style you and I strive for. [...] And just as I did not judge him on that basis, I imagine that when you hear him, you too will be compelled to ignore all matters of principle, and probably will end up doing just as I did. [...] For your principles would not be the proper standard to apply. [...] What he plays is expression in the older sense of the word, nothing else; but such power of expression I have never heard before. [...] You will disagree with his tempis as much as I did. [...] You will also note that he often seems to give primacy to sharp contrasts at the expense of form, the latter appearing to get lost. [...] I say appearing to; for then, in its own way, his music surprisingly regains its form, makes sense, establishes its own boundaries. [...] The sound he brings out of the piano is unheard of, <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> have never heard anything like it. [...] He himself seems not to know how he produces these novel and quite incredible sounds - although he appears to be a man of intelligence and not just some flaccid dreamer. [...] And such fullness of tone, achieved without ever becoming rough, I have never before encountered. [...] For me, and probably for you too, it's really too much fullness, but as a whole it displays incredible novelty and persuasiveness. [...] And above all he's only [...] old, so he's still got several stages of development before him, from which one may expect great things, given his point of departure... it is amazing what he plays and how he plays it. [...] One never senses that it is difficult, that it is technique - no, it is simply a power of the will, capable of soaring over all imaginable difficulties in the realization of an idea. - You see, I'm waxing almost poetic.|$|E

60|$|To {{dive into}} it from this great height was beyond her. I couldn't wonder, either. To have {{attempted}} it myself seemed too preposterous even for thought.

6000|$|... "Oh! Margaret, {{and what}} if your father should die in the meanwhile? Perhaps he knows better how deep his hurts are than does this leech. If so, {{you would have a}} sore heart for all your life. Sure you had better go, <b>or</b> <b>at</b> the <b>least</b> <b>I</b> will." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Thanks!" [...] said Austin. [...] "I suppose in {{one respect}} that's a compliment. Still, I almost think, <b>or,</b> <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>I</b> did when I first went down there, that if I'd known what {{was in front of}} me I'd have stayed in Grand Canary." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{she only}} smiled and, {{shaking her head}} in a {{fascinating}} way that was peculiar to her, remarked that I could not deceive her as I did the Kaffirs. After this the solid Kaatje brought the food and we breakfasted very heartily, <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> did.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, I do not understand; <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> cannot explain it.

60|$|We {{found the}} night-air keen; <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> did: {{he did not}} seem to feel it; but it was very still, and the star-sown sky spread cloudless.

6000|$|... "It {{ought to}} be reckoned, perhaps," [...] replied Mr. Porson gravely; adding {{in a kind of}} burst, with an air of {{complete}} conviction: [...] "I believe in Morris's machine, <b>or,</b> <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>I</b> believe in Morris.

"If it {{had been}} a {{question}} of making 'Every Other Week' the vehicle of Lindau's peculiar opinions--though they're not so very peculiar; he might have got the most of them out of Ruskin--I shouldn't have had any ground to stand on, <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> then <b>I</b> should have had to ask myself whether his opinions would be injurious to the magazine or not." ...|$|R
60|$|Prayers were over; it was bed-time; my co-inmates {{were all}} retired. I still {{remained}} in the gloomy first classe, forgetting, <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> disregarding, rules <b>I</b> had never forgotten or disregarded before.|$|R
6000|$|Thus {{would he}} while his lonely hours away [...] Dissatisfied, nor {{knowing what he}} wanted; [...] Nor glowing reverie, nor poet's lay, [...] Could yield his spirit that for which it panted, [...] A bosom whereon he his head might lay, [...] And hear the heart beat with the love it granted, [...] With--several other things, which I forget, [...] <b>Or</b> which, <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>I</b> need not mention yet.|$|R

60|$|Surely {{this was}} putting it fairly, {{and we tried}} to follow the old man's advice, <b>or,</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> did; but without {{arriving}} at any satisfactory conclusion.

6000|$|Shortly afterwards, {{when the}} mist lifted a little, {{we went out}} in a line to [...] "retrieve the Kalubi," [...] and found--well, I won't {{describe}} what we found.

6000|$|But {{thinking}} {{over this}} matter, and reading over, too, that which Mr. Ruskin has written thereon in his [...] "Stones of Venice," [...] vol. ii. cap. vi., {{on the nature}} of Gothic, I came to certain further conclusions-- <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> surmises--which <b>I</b> put before you to-night, in hopes that if they have no other effect on you, they will <b>at</b> <b>least</b> stir some of you up to read Mr. Ruskin's works.|$|R
