He wrote that his design might be considered post-high-tech: rather than exhibiting the building's inner workings, he chose to adorn a finished product with the abstractions of mechanical parts. His building, he argued, struck against the 20th century vision of the machine as a [...] "separate entity" [...] often [...] "elevated on a pedestal for worship" [...] and, by becoming [...] "a part <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>daily</b> lives, a friend, ourselves", cleared the way for the 21st century amalgam of machine and man.|$|E
500|$|Noting the realism in {{the writing}} for the series, Gilchrist stated: [...] "It's as if Rhimes and Co. {{harnessed}} the sublime and the mundane <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>daily</b> experiences, that strange sense of drama that emerges from even the most unimportant daily conflicts, and it transported it on {{a world that is}} legitimately fraught with life and death decisions." [...] However, he expressed disappointment in {{the end of the second}} season, which he deemed surprisingly less strong, compared to the [...] "powerful" [...] first half and the [...] "immaculate" [...] first season, describing Stevens' [...] "awkward and self-destructive" [...] relationship with a patient as a way to [...] "slow episodes to a screeching halt with maudlin and painfully underdeveloped turns towards melodrama", while expressing the predictability of Duquette's death. Gilchrist stated in response to Stevens' development in the last part of the second season: [...] "Izzie's descent into abject hysteria, which followed her season-long sanctimoniousness about everything, actually made me want something terrible to happen to her too." [...] He described how some episodes were not among the show's strongest, noting that the some plot lines created poignancy, and connected in an unfamiliar way.|$|E

2500|$|Lipids are an {{integral}} part <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>daily</b> diet. Most oils and milk products that we use for cooking and eating like butter, cheese, ghee etc., are composed of fats. Vegetable oils are rich in various polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Lipid-containing foods undergo digestion within the body and are broken into fatty acids and glycerol, which are the final degradation products of fats and lipids. [...] Lipids, especially phospholipids, are also used in various pharmaceutical products, either as co-solubilisers (e.g., in [...] infusions) or else as drug carrier components (e.g., in a liposome or transfersome).|$|E

Emanuel, is a Jerusalem-born {{pediatrician}} who {{was once}} a member of the Irgun, a Jewish paramilitary organization that operated in Mandate Palestine. He provided free care to poor immigrants and led efforts to get rid of lead paint due to its negative consequences for children and as of 2010 lived in a suburb of Chicago. [...] Emanuel’s mother, Marsha, a nurse and psychiatric social worker who was raised in the North Lawndale community on Chicago's West Side, was active in civil rights, including the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE).

But these characteristics need not prevent an activity that is normally devoid of expressive purpose from {{being used as a}} novel mode of communication. Sitting or standing in a library is a common-place activity necessary to facilitate ends usually having nothing to do with making a statement. Moreover, sitting or standing is not conduct that an observer would normally construe as expressive conduct. However, for Negroes to stand or sit in a [...] "whites only" [...] library in Louisiana in 1965 was powerfully expressive; in that particular context, those acts became [...] "monuments of protest" [...] against segregation.|$|E
2500|$|Sharon Willis {{focuses on}} the way a {{television}} show (Clutch Cargo) marks the beginning of, and plays on through, the scene between young Butch and his father's comrade-in-arms. The Vietnam War veteran is played by Christopher Walken, whose presence in the role evokes his performance as a traumatized G.I. in the Vietnam War movie The Deer Hunter (1978). Willis writes that [...] "when Captain Koons enters the living room, we see Walken in his function as an image retrieved from a repertoire of 1970s television and movie versions of ruined masculinity in search of rehabilitation... he gray light of the television presiding over the scene seems to inscribe the ghostly paternal gaze." [...] Miklitsch asserts that, for some critics, the film is a [...] "prime example of the pernicious ooze-like influence of mass culture exemplified by their bête noire: TV." [...] Kolker might not disagree, arguing that [...] "Pulp Fiction is a simulacrum <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>daily</b> exposure to television; its homophobes, thugs and perverts, sentimental boxers and pimp promoters move {{through a series of}} long-take tableaux: we watch, laugh, and remain with nothing to comprehend." ...|$|E
