40|$|A {{generalization}} of the well-known relationship between geometric and <b>orthometric</b> <b>heights</b> {{is presented in}} this paper. The advantage of our revised formulation is that, instead of the non-determinable true <b>orthometric</b> <b>heights,</b> it employs the (most commonly used in geodetic practice) Helmert <b>orthometric</b> <b>heights.</b> Based on standard concepts from physical geodesy theory and straightforward analytical derivations, we obtain a set of linearized constraints relating the geometric and Helmert <b>orthometric</b> <b>heights</b> {{in the presence of}} a geoid or quasi-geoid model. These constraints should be theoretically satisfied in the case of errorless data and thus they provide a standard framework for the joint analysis and the quality testing of heterogeneous heights in a terrestrial network...|$|R
30|$|Three {{techniques}} {{have been proposed}} and used in practice for the approximation of the integral-mean value of gravity between the geoid and the Earth’s surface along the plumbline. These include the Helmert method (Helmert 1890; Heiskanen and Moritz 1967), Mader method (Mader 1954) and Niethammer method (Niethammer 1932). Although Mader and Niethammer <b>orthometric</b> <b>heights</b> seem to be slightly more accurate than the Helmert <b>orthometric</b> <b>heights,</b> they are rarely used in practice; probably because of difficulty in the computations of the terrain correction, instead Helmert <b>orthometric</b> <b>heights</b> are in common use.|$|R
50|$|Since {{gravity is}} not {{constant}} over large areas the <b>orthometric</b> <b>height</b> of a level surface is not constant, and NGS orthometric heights are corrected for that effect. For example, gravity is 0.1% stronger {{in the northern}} United States than in the southern, so a level surface that has an <b>orthometric</b> <b>height</b> of 1000 meters in Montana will be 1001 meters high in Texas.|$|E

30|$|Recovery of <b>orthometric</b> <b>heights</b> from {{ellipsoidal}} heights using offsets {{method is}} found to perform better than planar fitting. In addition, this method does not constrain the gravimetric geoid model to fit onto the local vertical datum. The standard deviations {{of the differences between}} established and converted <b>orthometric</b> <b>heights</b> at randomly selected GPS/levelling test points over Japan are ± 4 and ± 3  cm for planar fitting and offsets methods, respectively. The offsets method is therefore more appropriate for converting ellipsoidal <b>heights</b> to <b>orthometric</b> <b>heights</b> over Japan than planar fitting. It is expected that this accuracy would improve with improvements in geoid modelling and modernisation of local vertical datum.|$|R
30|$|Table  2 {{shows that}} there is a slight {{improvement}} in the standard deviation in all the regions (Hokkaido, North Honshu, Central Honshu, West Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu), with Central Honshu (a mountainous region) having the largest improvement (from ± 7.1 to ± 6.9  cm), when rigorous <b>orthometric</b> <b>heights</b> are used. The standard deviation improves from ± 7.5 to 7.3  cm in the whole area of study. This shows that the rigorous <b>orthometric</b> <b>heights</b> are more consistent with the determined gravimetric geoid model than Helmert <b>orthometric</b> <b>heights</b> over Japan.

40|$|Determining the geoid in Saudi Arabia {{is not an}} easy matter, {{mainly because}} of the lack of {{necessary}} data at the present time. The global positioning system (GPS) is being used extensively in the country and seems to have alleviated this problem.

40|$|ABSTRACT. During {{the past}} decade, global {{positioning}} system (CPS) survey data {{have been used to}} establish precise relative positioning in a three-dimensional system. CPS survey methods can and have been used to replace classical horizontal control terrestrial survey methods. However, it was only during the last few years that these techniques have been applied to classical leveling (vertical control) applications. CPS-derived <b>orthometric</b> <b>heights</b> were computed for 18 monuments of the Baltimore County, Maryland, geodetic control network following the NCS guidelines. Comparisons were made between six second-order leveling-derived NAVD 88 stations and CPS-derived <b>orthometric</b> <b>heights</b> computed using adjusted ellipsoid heights and a high-resolution geoid model.

30|$|It is {{interesting}} to note that the biggest problem in geoid determination is also encountered in the mountainous areas. This brings to question the use of Helmert <b>orthometric</b> <b>heights</b> in validating gravimetric geoid models in general and specifically in mountainous areas, in view of the increasing accuracy in geoid modelling. It may be interesting to find out the contribution of the differences between rigorous and Helmert’s <b>orthometric</b> <b>heights</b> on downward continuation of gravity anomalies onto the geoid, especially in mountainous areas, where there are significant differences.|$|R

40|$|The state {{network of}} {{geodetic}} stations {{by means of}} the GPS measurements was created in Israel in 1990 - 2000. These geodetic stations were connected with the acting permanent network (APN) and high-grade GPS stations. Geographic coordinates of 7 APN stations in datum ITRF- 2000 were used for the network adjustment. The ellipsoidal heights resulting from this adjustment are applied in the given model. Since the beginning of the project, the task of this network application was formulated so as to enable the network to determine the values of <b>orthometric</b> <b>heights</b> {{by means of the}} GPS measurements.

40|$|AbstractThough {{considered}} the easiest in 3 -Dimensional Point Positioning, {{the choice of}} a height system especially in areas with spatially-vast land mass is rather a complicated choice. <b>Orthometric</b> <b>heights</b> are naturally and fully referenced to the actual earth gravity field but laborious to compute considering the required approximations of gravity variation along the plumb-line from the surface to the geoid. Normal heights on the other hand are less laborious to compute and do not require actual gravity observations. Unfortunately, natural height systems are the only systems that can efficiently predict fluid flows. This paper has therefore examined the theory and practical possibility of replacing the use of Helmert <b>Orthometric</b> <b>Heights</b> with Normal <b>Orthometric</b> <b>heights</b> within Lagos State. A maximum height discrepancy of 1 mm was obtained in the comparison of both systems and thus their replaceability found suitable to within 3 rd order geodetic accuracy...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{introduction}} of a new national height system, as it is prepared now in Switzerland, arises the problem of an accurate and efficient transformation method between various data sets containing height information. The same problem occurs in the data exchange between neighbouring countries or in the continental unification of vertical reference systems. The combination of GPS deter-mined heights with levelling measurements causes discrepancies between the two data sets even by using a very accurate geoid model. In this paper, the approach we use in Switzerland to model differences of height systems is presented. Especially the treatment of our old distorted level-ling network and its transition to a modern height system, such as normal <b>heights</b> and <b>orthometric</b> <b>heights,</b> is discussed. A further problem is the calculation of the mean gravity along the plumbline, as it {{is used in the}} determination of <b>orthometric</b> <b>heights.</b> Instead of an approximation formula, we use a method of using 3 D mass models. We present the influence of the different approaches on the <b>orthometric</b> <b>heights...</b>|$|R
