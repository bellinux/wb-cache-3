50|$|Cladistic {{arrangement}} {{of this group}} of plants has been recognized {{as far back as}} Andrea Cesalpino in the 1630s and again by Giulio Pontedera in the 1720s, but the official nomenclature arose after Cassini's work within the family. Early 20th-century botanists placed this tribe as sister to the Senecioneae; however, there has been molecular evidence of closer relationships between the Astereae and the Calenduleae. This tribe has demonstrated monophyly through chemical analysis of the similar pimerane diterpenes found within all tested species. <b>Osteospermum</b> and Garuleum share the highest number of identical chemical signatures, indicating close phylogenetic relationship and a more recent divergence than other genera of the tribe. One of the newly discovered <b>Osteospermum</b> has provided evidence of a link between <b>Osteospermum</b> and Chrysanthemoides.|$|E

50|$|Plants in Calenduleae {{vary from}} herbs to shrubs and usually exhibit showy flower heads. The {{defining}} characteristics separating {{members of this}} tribe from others within the family are a dimorphism of the cypselae {{and the fact that}} each cypselae lacks a pappus.2 Calenduleae is named for its most economically important genus, Calendula, known in homeopathic remedies and as a common ornamental. Other genera from Calenduleae produce ornamentals as well, including <b>Osteospermum</b> and Dimorphotheca (see Asteraceae for a more general description).|$|E
5000|$|Dimorphotheca is a genus {{of plants}} in the {{sunflower}} family, native to Africa and Australia. is one of eight genera of the Calenduleae, with a centre of diversity in Southern Africa. Some species can hybridize with <b>Osteospermum,</b> and crosses are sold as cultivated ornamentals. The name [...] "Dimorphotheca" [...] comes from the Greek [...] "Dis" [...] "Morphe" [...] and [...] "Theka", meaning [...] "two shaped fruit", referring to the dimorphic cypselae, a trait inherent {{to members of the}} Calenduleae. Plants of this genus usually have bisexual flowers.|$|E
50|$|Like all plant viruses, LMV {{is totally}} {{harmless}} {{to the consumer}} but causes defects in heading, leaf distortions and leaf colour anomalies, which altogether result in the infected lettuce plants to be unmarketable. Disease rates can reach 100% locally, and therefore cause complete loss of the harvest. LMV can also infect other crops such as spinach and peas, as well as ornamentals (especially the Cape Daisy <b>Osteospermum</b> spp) and wild plants (especially the prickly lettuce Lactuca serriola and the oxtongue Helminthia echioides). All these plants, and probably others, can serve as local sources from which LMV can spread to crops.The virus typically targets the plant's nerve cells.|$|E
