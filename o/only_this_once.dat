2500|$|After Cleon's speech, Thucydides {{presents}} {{a speech by}} Diodotus, a politician who appears <b>only</b> <b>this</b> <b>once</b> in recorded history, but who, Thucydides reports, had also spoken against Cleon's proposal the previous day. [...] He is identified as [...] "Diodotus, son of Eucrates"; the Eucrates in question is presumably a fairly prominent lieutenant of Pericles mentioned on several occasions before this. [...] The early portion of Diodotus' speech is devoted to refuting the charges that Cleon had preemptively levelled against those who would speak after him, principally by arguing that the assembly would deprive itself of wise counsel if it constantly examined the motives of speakers instead of the arguments they presented. [...] Next Diodotus attacks Cleon's claim that harshness would deter future revolts, {{on the grounds that}} no state revolts in the expectation of failure, and that the more useful countermeasure, therefore, is a mild punishment that will allow for reconsideration when the revolt appears likely to fail. [...] Throughout the speech, Diodotus refuses to stray from the grounds of expediency, reminding the Athenians that they sit not as a court of law but as political assembly, dedicated to determining what action is most advantageous for Athens. [...] On the issue of culpability, however, he flatly denies that the demos shares in the guilt of the oligarchs, and warns the assembly against alienating its potential friends throughout the empire.|$|E

6000|$|So they {{wandered off}} lovingly together, {{in among the}} buttercups, each with an arm twined round the other, {{whispering}} and laughing as they went, and never so much as once looked back at poor me. Yes, once, just before I quite lost sight of them, Bruno half turned his head, and nodded me a saucy little good-bye over one shoulder. And {{that was all the}} thanks I got for my trouble. The very last thing I saw of them was this-- Sylvie was stooping down with her arms round Bruno's neck, and saying coaxingly in his ear, [...] "Do you know, Bruno, I've quite forgotten that hard word. Do say it once more. Come! <b>Only</b> <b>this</b> <b>once,</b> dear!" ...|$|E

But I shall spare you <b>only</b> <b>this</b> <b>once</b> on her account.

6000|$|He spoke there,--rugged {{bursts of}} earnestness, of a self-seen truth, {{where we get}} a glimpse of them. He worked there; he fought and strove, like a strong true giant of a man, through cannon-tumult and all else,--on and on, till the Cause triumphed, its once so {{formidable}} enemies all swept from before it, and the dawn of hope had become clear light of victory and certainty. That he stood there as the strongest soul of England, the undisputed Hero of all England,--what of this? It was possible that the Law of Christ's Gospel could now establish itself in the world! The Theocracy which John Knox in his pulpit might dream of as a [...] "devout imagination," [...] this practical man, experienced in the whole chaos of most rough practice, dared to consider as capable of being realized. Those that were highest in Christ's Church, the devoutest wisest men, were to rule the land: in some considerable degree, it might be so and should be so. Was it not true, God's truth? And if true, was it not then the very thing to do? The strongest practical intellect in England dared to answer, Yes! This I call a noble true purpose; is it not, in its own dialect, the noblest that could enter into the heart of Statesman or man? For a Knox to take it up was something; but for a Cromwell, with his great sound sense and experience of what our world was,--History, I think, shows it <b>only</b> <b>this</b> <b>once</b> in such a degree. I account it the culminating point of Protestantism; the most heroic phasis that [...] "Faith in the Bible" [...] was appointed to exhibit here below. Fancy it: that it were made manifest to one of us, how we could make the Right supremely victorious over Wrong, and all that we had longed and prayed for, as the highest good to England and all lands, an attainable fact! ...|$|E

5000|$|Using a dried gourd {{hanging from}} the rafters, Dürer memorializes Jerome's courage, {{in the face of}} long brewing {{philological}} controversy with St. Augustine in his preference for Greek over Latin nomenclature for the fast-growing plant known in Hebrew as קיקיון (qiyqayown) encountered <b>only</b> <b>this</b> <b>once,</b> in the Book of Jonah. The Old Testament text closes abruptly (...) with an epistolary warning based on the emblematic trope of a fast-growing vine present in Persian narratives, and popularized widely in certain collections of Aesop's fables such as The Gourd and the Palm-tree. Jerome elected to use Hedera (from the Greek, meaning ivy) over the more common Latin cucurbita from which the related English plant name cucumber is derived, perhaps to avoid confusion while making a more perfect analogy to the typology of Christ [...] "I am the Vine you are the branches". In fact Augustine's view had already prevailed by Dürer's time.|$|E

5000|$|Different sources {{document}} this, as {{for example}} with Johann Wolfgang Goethe who was, on 3 April 1764, an eyewitness in Frankfurt during the coronation of the just 18-year-old Joseph, Duke of Lorraine to King in Germany {{who had been}} chosen to this function at the instigation of his father Emperor Francis I still while living {{what happened in the}} 18th century <b>only</b> <b>this</b> <b>once.</b> So that both majesties could appear in the dresses of the insignia, an imitation of the coronation mantle was manufactured which was worked after Goethe's deposing, moreover, comfortably and tastefully for Emperor Francis. However, the young king wore the real coronation vestments and Goethe wrote about it in his autobiography Dichtung und Wahrheit (From my Life: Poetry and Truth): The young king, on the contrary, in his monstrous articles of dress, with the crown-jewels of Charlemagne, dragged himself along {{as if he had been}} in a disguise; so that he himself, looking at his father from time to time, could not refrain from laughing. The crown, which it had been necessary to line a great deal, stood out from his head like an overhanging roof. The dalmatica, the stole, well as they had been fitted and taken in by sewing, presented by no means an advantageous appearance. The sceptre and imperial orb excited some admiration; but one would, for the sake of a more princely effect, rather have seen a strong form, suited to the dress, invested and adorned with it. J. W. Goethe ...|$|E
