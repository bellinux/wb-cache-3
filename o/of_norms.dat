5|$|Criminologists analyse the nature, causes, {{and control}} of {{criminal}} activity, drawing upon methods across sociology, psychology, and the behavioural sciences. The sociology of deviance focuses on actions or behaviours that violate norms, including both formally enacted rules (e.g., crime) and informal violations of cultural norms. It is the remit of sociologists to study why these norms exist; how they change over time; {{and how they are}} enforced. The concept of social disorganization is when the broader social systems leads to violations <b>of</b> <b>norms.</b> For instance, Robert K. Merton produced a typology of deviance, which includes both individual and system level causal explanations of deviance.|$|E
5|$|The AFIS air {{controller}} has {{a different}} role in Norway than in Russia, and the crew were not aware {{that they were being}} given information and advice, rather than orders. Communication with AFIS was left with the navigator, which is a breach <b>of</b> <b>norms.</b> Communication between air control and the crew was problematic, since the crew lacked sufficient English skills. The pilot in command had insufficient crew resource management. After the crew decided to carry out the approach to Runway 28, a new approach briefing was not accomplished. The aircraft overshot the approach centerline when turning inbound, because they did not try to intercept the outbound track from Advent. The crew showed a lack of situational awareness following their uncertainty of the aircraft position in relation to LLZ 28, caused by indications on the HSIs.|$|E

25|$|Macneil's work {{is often}} {{considered}} inaccessible {{and difficult to}} read. And Macneil himself has expressed some disappointment at the reception of the work among legal scholars: 'I have now had over a decade to accept that {{there had never been}} any race to a relational theory of contract, nor have the succeeding years seen either widespread acceptance of (or indeed much challenge to) my particular theory or the development of other relational theories.' However, the Northwestern symposium and other more recent work goes some way to correcting that omission. In particular, David Campbell has published an edited collection of Macneil's relational contract theory work. Macneil's work in particular has also been discussed by Richard Austen-Baker, who relates Macneil's system <b>of</b> <b>norms</b> to English contract law doctrine, and used Macneil's theory to discuss the need or otherwise of further regulation of consumer contracts.|$|E
25|$|Once girls enter school, patriarchal {{norms and}} values work against norms {{and values of}} modern {{education}} which aims to provide equal education for boys and girls. Parents may allow girls to attend school but still expect them to fulfill traditional duties rather than giving then time to do homework or arrive at school before school gates are shut. Girls are expected to participate in class contrary to their training for non-participation. If girls try to meet school norms for participation they are subjected to psychological violence reinforcing patriarchal norms. Girls may also be subjected to violence and abuse at home if they act on new school norms contrary to tradition. This clash <b>of</b> <b>norms</b> continues {{on the way to}} and from school with older boys and adult men seeing adolescent girls as unprotected by marriage. Consequently, girls experience physical and sexual violence and are at risk of abduction. Girls' attempts to cope with the educational system may increase their risk of violence and sexual abuse. Girl students were some of the main perpetrators of violence against other girls and they could act as go-betweens for boys in the hope that boys would favor them.|$|E

40|$|This study {{deals with}} the process <b>of</b> <b>norm</b> {{diffusion}} in international politics. It primarily analyses and explains the diffusion <b>of</b> the <b>norm</b> <b>of</b> ’good governance’ initiated by the World Bank in 1989. In so doing the study delivers an analysis <b>of</b> the <b>norm</b> entrepreneurship <b>of</b> the World Bank in this specific case <b>of</b> <b>norm</b> diffusion. Moreover, the analysis reflects on {{the capacity of the}} World Bank as a norm entrepreneur from a more general point of view. An analytical framework that mainly draws on social constructivist literature on norm evolution is developed and applied to the empirical case at hand. The analysis is divided into two parts. The first section focuses on normative structures and the second section concentrates on the norm entrepreneur. The last concluding part wraps up the analysis of the empirical case by explaining how the first and {{the second part of the}} inquiry relate. The present study suggests that social fitness is the key analytical concept to understand the process <b>of</b> <b>norm</b> diffusion in the case at hand. The analysis shows how the social fitness <b>of</b> the <b>norm</b> <b>of</b> ‘good governance’ and the social fitness of the World Bank as an international organisation are fundamental to understand the diffusion <b>of</b> the <b>norm</b> <b>of</b> ‘good governance’. The theoretical conception <b>of</b> <b>norm</b> diffusion delivered in the present study suggests that international organisations can be influential and powerful norm entrepreneurs. Furthermore, the study incorporates a theoretical conception of power into the analysis <b>of</b> <b>norm</b> diffusion and shows how power in different forms is a fundamental element to understand and analyse the social construction of intersubjectivity...|$|R
