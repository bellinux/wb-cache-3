5|$|The {{constitution}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Roman</b> Republic {{was a set}} of unwritten {{norms and}} customs, which together with various written laws, guided the manner by which the Roman Republic was governed. The constitution emerged out of that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Roman</b> kingdom, evolved over the almost five hundred years of the Republic, and was transformed into the constitution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Roman</b> Empire.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the Constitution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Roman</b> Republic is {{a study of the}} ancient Roman Republic that traces the {{progression}} of Roman political development from the founding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Roman</b> Republic in 509 BC until the founding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Roman</b> Empire in 27 BC. The constitutional history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Roman</b> Republic can be divided into five phases. The first phase began with the revolution which overthrew the Roman Kingdom in 510 BC, and the final phase ended with the revolution which overthrew the Roman Republic, and thus created the Roman Empire, in 27 BC. Throughout the {{history of the}} republic, the constitutional evolution was driven by the struggle between the aristocracy and the ordinary citizens.|$|E

5|$|Cannae {{played a}} major role in shaping the {{military}} structure and tactical organization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Roman</b> Republican army. At Cannae, the Roman infantry assumed a formation similar to the Greek phalanx. This left them vulnerable to Hannibal's tactic of double envelopment since their inability to maneuver independently from the mass of the army made it impossible for them to counter the strategic encirclement used by the Carthaginian cavalry. The laws <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Roman</b> state requiring command to alternate between the two consuls restricted strategic consistency.|$|E

On 11 May 330, Constantinople was proclaimed the capital <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Roman</b> Empire, which was later permanently divided between the two sons of Theodosius I upon his death on 17 January 395, when the city became {{the capital of the}} Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire.|$|E
