The monopoly was defended by an imperial decree, condemning to death anyone attempting to export silkworms <b>or</b> <b>their</b> eggs. Only around the year 300 CE did a Japanese expedition succeed in taking some silkworm eggs and four young Chinese girls, who were forced to teach their captors the art of sericulture. Techniques of sericulture were subsequently introduced to Japan on a larger scale by frequent diplomatic exchanges between the 8th century and 9th centuries.|$|E
5|$|Another {{threat to}} {{albatrosses}} is introduced species, such as rats or feral cats, which directly attack albatrosses <b>or</b> <b>their</b> chicks and eggs. Albatrosses {{have evolved to}} breed on islands where land mammals are absent and have not developed defences against them. Even species as small as mice can be detrimental; on Gough Island the chicks of Tristan albatrosses are attacked and eaten alive by introduced house mice. Introduced species can have other indirect effects: cattle overgrazed essential cover on Amsterdam Island, threatening the Amsterdam albatross; on other islands introduced plants reduce potential nesting habitat.|$|E
5|$|Around 1844, {{she married}} a free black man named John Tubman.

Such blended marriages – free people of color marrying enslaved people – were not uncommon on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, where by this time, half the black population was free. Most African-American families had both free and enslaved members. Larson suggests that they might have planned to buy Tubman's freedom.|$|E
