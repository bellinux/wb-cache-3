5|$|On July 11, 1914, Ruth {{arrived in}} Boston with Egan and Shore. Ruth later {{told the story}} <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>that</b> morning he had met Helen Woodford, who was the girl that would be his first wife. She was a 16-year-old {{waitress}} at Landers Coffee Shop, and Ruth related that she served him when he had breakfast there. Other stories, though, suggested that the meeting occurred on another day, and perhaps under other circumstances. Regardless of {{when he began to}} woo his first wife, he won his first game as a pitcher for the Red Sox that afternoon, 4–3, over the Cleveland Naps. His catcher was Bill Carrigan, who was also the Red Sox manager. Shore was given a start by Carrigan the next day; he won that and his second start and thereafter was pitched regularly. Ruth lost his second start, and was thereafter little used. As a batter in his major-league debut, Ruth went 0-for-2 against left-hander Willie Mitchell, striking out in his first at bat, before being removed for a pinch hitter in the seventh inning. Ruth was not much noticed by the fans, as Bostonians watched the Red Sox's crosstown rivals, the Braves, begin a legendary comeback that would take them from last place on the Fourth of July to the 1914 World Series championship.|$|E

For his expansionist policy, however, he had to reorganize the army to include, albeit in a subordinate position of light infantry, all {{ethnic groups in the}} kingdom. All free men of the kingdom, both those of Roman and Lombard origin, were to be subject to military obligations. The military standards promulgated by Aistulf mention several times the merchants, a sign <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>that</b> class had now become relevant.|$|E

25|$|From a {{macroscopic}} perspective, {{in classical}} thermodynamics the entropy is {{interpreted as a}} state function of a thermodynamic system: that is, a property depending only on {{the current state of}} the system, independent <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>that</b> state came to be achieved. In any process where the system gives up energy ΔE, and its entropy falls by ΔS, a quantity at least TR ΔS of that energy must be given up to the system's surroundings as unusable heat (TR is the temperature of the system's external surroundings). Otherwise the process cannot go forward. In classical thermodynamics, the entropy of a system is defined only if it is in thermodynamic equilibrium.|$|E

Scott won the role, but producer Chip Johannessen recalled that [...] "she wasn't what the network were looking, they wanted Heather Locklear or something to come. That was kind <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>that</b> went down." [...] Fox backed down, and Scott got the role.|$|E

500|$|Lehto {{recalled}} that making a character-driven story {{was a great}} challenge—players would come {{to know more about}} them as they progressed through the campaign, but the Spartan characters also had to behave intelligently. [...] "The Halo games consistently featured protagonists that were silent during gameplay sequences. Community manager Brian Jarrard pushed for allowing players to choose a female Noble Six and have the cinematics and dialogue change accordingly. The post-credit game sequence was the subject of intense discussion; some at Bungie wanted to remove it. Executive producer Joe Tung noted, [...] "the 'survive' component ... felt great to us. We definitely talked about different versions <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>that</b> was happening and different versions of ending [...] cinematically, but I think the way that it ultimately ended up is just a really well-paced, significant and emotionally impactful ending." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviewers have {{discussed}} {{the presence of a}} theme, with Milton Savage deducing that [...] "track titles would imply an underlying conceptual framework to Wavering Radiant, with 'Hall of the Dead' preceding 'Ghost Key', and 'Threshold of Transformation' closing the album in epic circumstances – Turner, it seems, has left our world behind for exploration of another beyond the lives led by mortal men." [...] Isis releases have always had a thematic basis; as Andrew Rennie dissects, [...] "Isis's four previous full-lengths have clear story arcs, but Wavering Radiant themes are open to interpretation, giving it added appeal." [...] Over time, Turner has become reluctant to divulge the thematic particulars of any given album and on Wavering Radiant he has been equivocal. The act of explaining the thematic basis of an album erodes Turner's [...] "connection" [...] with the music, and he has spoken <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>that</b> relationship is something he [...] "wishes to preserve". He also asserts that retaining this synergy with the music allows him to commit more to the album's live performances. Similarly, he has also spoken of how [...] "eople have a tendency to focus on one narrow aspect of the overall concept or misinterpret it." ...|$|E
500|$|Originally, the {{producers}} {{were looking for}} a white actress to play the part. Klea Scott's agent thought she was [...] "really right" [...] for the part. He then went down to {{the producers}} for the show and campaigned for her and guaranteed them if she did not fit for the role, he would never send another actor to the casting director of the show. Scott auditioned with four other actresses to get the part. Scott won the role, but producer Chip Johannessen recalled that [...] "she wasn't what the network were looking, they wanted Heather Locklear or something to come. That was kind <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>that</b> went down". Fox backed down, and Scott got the role. Scott had been living in Los Angeles, but relocated to the series' filming location in Vancouver when she joined the cast. Scott had little input in her character's development, and admitted feeling [...] "a little hurt" [...] to find that Hollis had joined the Millennium Group {{by the end of the}} series; however, Scott felt this development was [...] "believable and real". Scott's first day on set was during the filming of the final scene of [...] "The Innocents", the third season's opening episode. The actress found it difficult to adjust to the series' heavy workload, but found it enjoyable to work with co-star Lance Henriksen.|$|E

2500|$|William of Malmesbury, writing around 1120, {{says that}} King Athelstan of England (924–939) fixed Cornwall's eastern {{boundary}} {{at the east}} bank of the Tamar and the remaining Cornish were evicted from Exeter and perhaps the rest of Devon: [...] "Exeter was cleansed of its defilement by wiping out that filthy race". These British speakers were deported across the Tamar, which was fixed as {{the border of the}} Cornish; they were left under their own dynasty to regulate themselves with west Welsh tribal law and customs, rather like the Indian princes under the Raj in the 19th and early 20th centuries.

2500|$|The {{result was}} the Commission for Africa. [...] Blair invited Geldof and 16 other Commissioners, the {{majority}} from Africa {{and many of them}} politicians in power, to undertake a year-long study of Africa's problems. [...] They came up with two conclusions: that Africa needed to change, to improve its governance and combat corruption, and that the rich world needed to support that change in new ways. [...] That meant doubling aid, delivering debt cancellation, and reforming trade rules. [...] The Commission drew up a detailed plan <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>that</b> could be done. [...] It reported in March 2005. [...] To force the issue Geldof decided to create a new international lobby for Africa with eight simultaneous concerts around the world to put pressure on the G8. [...] He called it Live 8. [...] The Commission's recommendations later became the blueprint for the G8 Gleneagles African debt and aid package.|$|E
2500|$|Spinors are {{characterized}} by the specific {{way in which they}} behave under rotations. [...] They change in different ways depending not just on the overall final rotation, but the details <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>that</b> rotation was achieved (by a continuous path in the rotation group). [...] There are two topologically distinguishable classes (homotopy classes) of paths through rotations that result in the same overall rotation, as famously illustrated by the belt trick puzzle (below). [...] These two inequivalent classes yield spinor transformations of opposite sign. [...] The spin group is the group of all rotations keeping track of the class. It doubly covers the rotation group, since each rotation can be obtained in two inequivalent ways as the endpoint of a path. The space of spinors by definition is equipped with a (complex) linear representation of the spin group, meaning that elements of the spin group act as linear transformations on the space of spinors, in a way that genuinely depends on the homotopy class.|$|E

2500|$|Barboza has a {{prolific}} and {{wide range of}} both traditional and innovative works inspired by African-American thought, which have been exhibited {{in public and private}} galleries, and prestigious museums and educational institutions worldwide. [...] He is well known for his photographic work of jazz musicians from the 1970s – '80s. [...] Many of these works are in his book Black Borders, published in 1980 with a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts. [...] In an article printed in 1984 in The City Sun, he said, [...] "When I do a portrait, I’m doing a photograph <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>that</b> person feels to me; how I feel about the person, not how they look. [...] I find that in order for the portraits to work, they have to make a mental connection as well as an emotional one. [...] When they do that, I know I have it."

2500|$|The Tenderloin {{took its}} name from an older {{neighborhood}} in New York with similar characteristics. There are several explanations <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>that</b> neighborhood was named. Some {{said it was a}} reference to the neighborhood as the [...] "soft underbelly" [...] (analogous to the cut of meat) of the city, with allusions to vice and corruption, especially graft. Another popular explanation, probably folklore, attributes the name to a New York City police captain, Alexander S. Williams, who was overheard saying that when he was assigned {{to another part of the}} city, he could only afford to eat chuck steak on the salary he was earning, but after he was transferred to this neighborhood he was making so much money on the side soliciting bribes that now he could eat tenderloin instead. Another version of that story says that the officers who worked in the Tenderloin received a [...] "hazard pay" [...] bonus for working in such a violent area, and thus were able to afford the good cut of meat. Yet another story, also likely apocryphal, is that the name is a reference to the [...] "loins" [...] of prostitutes.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "false awareness" [...] (falsches Bewusstsein) in the {{classical}} sense used by Friedrich Engels does not necessarily refer to [...] "errors" [...] {{in the content of}} awareness. It refers rather to an absence of awareness of what is really behind the ideas being worked with, how they have originated, or what the real role or effect of the ideas is. The first result of that is, that the ideologists believe themselves to be performing certain intellectual operations with regard to an issue, which, in reality, have quite a different significance than what they imagine. The second result is that their intellectual creations can then function as a mask for what is really at stake, precisely because the issue is portrayed in a one-sided or distorted way – without the ideologists being aware <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>that</b> works. The ideologists are aware and unaware at the same time. The problem, says Engels, is that they exaggerate the power of ideas, even to the point where ideas seem to be the cause of all that happens. This occurs especially if the intellectual productions occur at quite some distance from the practical context to which they properly refer, or if they concern specialized, highly abstract ideas which cannot easily be verified (this concept differs from the Marxism–Leninism ideology, where [...] "false consciousness" [...] is thinking which deviates from the political line of the Communist Party).|$|E
