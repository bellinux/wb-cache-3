25|$|Peter Andreas Blix {{was hired}} as the {{national}} railway architect in 1873 and awarded the task of designing the stations on the Østfold Line. His designs drew inspiration from Medieval architecture, Gothic architecture and contemporary English villa styles. He let the interior plans dominate the <b>outer</b> <b>shape</b> and avoided symmetry. Most of the station buildings were in wood and standardized designs. Stations which were expected to have larger traffic received a separate goods sheds. The four main towns received brick stations. Halden Station was the most prominent, with an exterior which drew elements from a Medieval fortresses inspired from Fredriksten Fortress and the town's role as a border town. Moss, Fredrikstad and Sarpsborg received the same design with three gables on each facade.|$|E
2500|$|Persian domes from {{different}} historical eras {{can be distinguished}} by their transition tiers: the squinches, spandrels, or brackets that transition from the supporting structures to the circular base of a dome. Drums, after the Ilkanate era, {{tend to be very}} similar and have an average height of 30 to 35 meters from the ground. They are where windows are located. Inner shells are commonly semi-circular, semi-elliptical, pointed, or saucer shaped. The outer shell of a Persian dome reduces in thickness every 25 or 30 degrees from the base. Outer shells can be semi-circular, semi-elliptical, pointed, conical, or bulbous, and this <b>outer</b> <b>shape</b> is used to categorize them. Pointed domes can be sub-categorized as having shallow, medium, and sharp profiles, and bulbous domes as either shallow or sharp. Double domes use internal stiffeners with wooden struts between the shells, with the exception of those with conical outer shells.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA novel {{class of}} vivid motion and {{velocity}} illusions for contrast-defined shapes is presented and discussed. The illusions concern a starlike wheel that, physically, rotates with constant velocity between stationary starlike inner and <b>outer</b> <b>shapes</b> but that, perceptually, shows pulsations, jolts backwards, jolts forwards, and accelerations, {{each time it}} aligns with the inner and <b>outer</b> <b>shapes.</b> These dynamic effects turn from one into another when contrasts in the image change gradually, and seem {{to be caused by}} colour assimilation and ambiguous figure-ground segregation...|$|R

60|$|Awful it is; {{and should}} be. And, therefore, I at least do not regret that its very form, outside, should want those heaven-pointing spires, that {{delicate}} lightness, that airy joyousness, {{of many a}} foreign cathedral—even of our own Salisbury and Lichfield. You will see in its <b>outer</b> <b>shape</b> little, if any, of that type of architecture which was, as I believe, copied from scenery with which you, as Americans, must be even more familiar than were the mediæval architects who travelled through the German forests and across the Alps to Rome. True, we have our noble high-pitched snow-roof. Our architect, like the rest, had seen the mountain ranges jut black and bare above the snows of winter. He had seen those snows slip down in sheets, rush down in torrents from the sun, off the steep slabs of rock which coped the hill-side; and he, like the rest, has copied in that roof, for use as well as beauty, the mountain rocks.|$|E

A major ingredient to the design process is the numerical simulation of the external airflow. The capabilities to predict the flow not only near the design point but also under other challenging conditions in a given flight envelope is a prerequisite for optimization towards market requirements.|$|R
50|$|Michael Behrens began {{experimenting with}} glass in 2002. Nature and the {{surrounding}} environment, especially the underwater world, inspire his work. The reduction to few colors and the cell structures resulting from the fusion of the utilized glass pieces, are the main characteristics of his works. The relationship between shape and content is of high importance in Behrens' work. The <b>outer</b> <b>shapes</b> of his sculptures appear deliberately random, supported by the fine, relief-like crimped modeling of the edges and the interplay of matt and polished surfaces.|$|R
50|$|Lee {{concentrated}} {{mainly on}} residential housing, trying {{to consider the}} specifics of the respective location. The characteristics of his style include open and non-orthogonal floor plans and the interlocking of the buildings with their immediate and more distant surroundings. For this purpose he worked together with landscape architects for most of his projects from the very early planning stages on, among others with Hermann Mattern, Adolf Haag and Hannes Haag. With many of his buildings, inner and <b>outer</b> <b>shapes</b> interact by means of the continuation of lines of sight along sun rooms and water pools.|$|R

In all processes, the <b>outer</b> <b>shape</b> of the pin is stamped out from a sheet of steel, aluminum, copper, brass, or iron. In the case of cloisonne and soft enamel, the shape and the design are stamped out.|$|E
40|$|High {{expectations}} are {{being placed on}} bamboo fibers {{as an alternative to}} glass fibers for applications of industrial products. However, conventional bamboo fiber extraction techniques have problems that primarily involve quality, accuracy, and efficiency. To solve these problems, we propose a new method for obtaining bamboo fibers with a machining center (MC) using in-situ measurement. The bamboo pipe’s inner and <b>outer</b> <b>shapes</b> were measured with a touch probe. The fiber shape and its distribution were also investigated. Based on these bamboo properties, we propose a method to create a tool path. Key words: in-situ measurement, tool path, bamboo fiber, natural materia...|$|R

50|$|In 1705 the {{conversion}} of the Renaissance castle into a Baroque residence was started by state architect, Hermann Korb, on behalf of Duke Louis Rudolf of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel. The reconstruction resulted in a simpler and clearer structure of the <b>outer</b> <b>shape</b> and lasted until 1718. Also created were reception rooms (the Grey Hall, Reduten Hall and Imperial Hall) in the interior, and a multi-storey, octagonal royal church.|$|E

40|$|The optimum {{designs of}} headstocks of {{precision}} lathes are studied. Three different <b>outer</b> <b>shapes</b> of headstocks are explored. Thermal deformations due to heat generated by spindle bearings are considered. The {{objective is to}} minimise the overall deflection of the workpiece at the cutting point. The constraint is to force the fundamental natural frequency {{much greater than the}} working frequency in order to reduce dynamic deflections, The design variables include the shape dimensions, the locations of the spindle bearings, the stiffnesses of the spindle bearings, the dimensions of the fins and the locations of the fins. The genetic algorithm is utilised to solve these mixed-variable optimisation problems. Optimum solutions for the three different types of headstocks are found and discussed.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the bridges and tails seen in some {{multiple}} galaxies are just tidal relics of close encounters. These consequences of the brief but violent tidal forces are here studied in a deliberately simple-minded fashion. Each encounter is considered to involve only two galaxies and to be roughly parabolic; each galaxy is idealized as just a disk of noninteracting test particles which initially orbit a central mass point. As shown here, the two-sided distortions provoked by gravity alone in such circumstances can indeed evolve kinematically into some remarkably narrow and elongated features. Besides extensive pictorial survey of tidal damage, this paper offers reconstructions of the orbits and <b>outer</b> <b>shapes</b> of four specific interacting pairs: Arp 295, M 51 + NGC 5195, NGC 4676, and NGC 4038 / 9...|$|R

25|$|As with {{everything}} to do with sprung floors, a combination of types is often used. A core of softer durometer may have a harder <b>outer</b> layer <b>shaped</b> so that heavy falls encounter more resistance instead of 'bottoming out' to a concrete subfloor.

40|$|Precise {{control of}} the {{interior}} and <b>outer</b> <b>shapes</b> of polymer nanoparticles has found broad interest in nanosciences, for example, in fundamental studies of their physical properties, colloidal behavior, and corresponding applications. Realizing such control below the 50 nm scale (i. e., a size scale close to individual polymer chains) requires accurate manipulation of polymerization techniques and a judicious choice of the chemical structure in monomers and/or polymers. Here, we constructed a series of well-defined sub- 50 nm homopolymer nanoparticles with controllable shape and highly ordered, complex internal structures with sub- 5 nm domain spacings, starting from 1 -vinyl- 1, 2, 4 -triazolium-type ionic liquids in a one-pot dispersion polymerization. With cryogenic electron microscopy and tomography, a morphological evolution of particle shape and interior at this extremely small size end, unusual for polymer colloids, was identified and investigated in detail...|$|R

5000|$|Qin {{forms are}} shapes or styles which a qin {{can be made}} in. In the Wuzhi Zhai Qinpu {{there is a large}} number of qin forms listed with their origins. [...] The most popular form is the Zhongni 「仲尼式」 form, which is named after Confucius' style-name. It is the most simple yet elegant.

Although there is a dizzying array of forms a maker can use (which includes some rather bizarre ones), generally, makers stick to more usual and popular forms.

Also, in this time, the guitar went through many different <b>outer</b> <b>shapes,</b> and luthiers also had to cater for guitar demands from many amateurs at the time; so ultimately, for any given instrument from about 1800 to 1900, it could be one of high tonal quality, but might just as well be a mediocre instrument; or one with a design and tonal characteristic, that was later abandoned by the maker (though there are 19th-century guitar-makers such as Lacote and Scherzer, who are generally considered as having built guitars with high tonal quality).|$|R
