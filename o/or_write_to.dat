25|$|Typical {{computer}} systems today use hardware-enforced rules about what programs {{are allowed to}} access what data. The processor monitors the execution and stops a program that violates a rule (e.g., a user process that is about to read <b>or</b> <b>write</b> <b>to</b> kernel memory, and so on). In systems that lack support for capabilities, processes are isolated from each other by using separate address spaces. Calls from user processes into the kernel are regulated by requiring them {{to use one of}} the above-described system call methods.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{indication}} of Apple Inc.'s interest in ZFS was an April 2006 {{post on the}} opensolaris.org zfs-discuss mailing list where an Apple employee mentioned being interested in porting ZFS to their Mac OS X operating system. In the release version of Mac OS X 10.5, ZFS was available in read-only mode from the command line, which lacks the possibility to create zpools <b>or</b> <b>write</b> <b>to</b> them. Before the 10.5 release, Apple released the [...] "ZFS Beta Seed v1.1", which allowed read-write access {{and the creation of}} zpools,; however, the installer for the [...] "ZFS Beta Seed v1.1" [...] has been reported to only work on version 10.5.0, and has not been updated for version 10.5.1 and above. In August 2007, Apple opened a ZFS project on their Mac OS Forge web site. On that site, Apple provided the source code and binaries of their port of ZFS which includes read-write access, but there was no installer available until a third-party developer created one. In October 2009, Apple announced a shutdown of the ZFS project on Mac OS Forge. That is to say that their own hosting and involvement in ZFS was summarily discontinued. No explanation was given, just the following statement: [...] "The ZFS project has been discontinued. The mailing list and repository will also be removed shortly." [...] Apple would eventually release the legally required, CDDL-derived, portion of the source code of their final public beta of ZFS, code named [...] "10a286". Complete ZFS support was once advertised as a feature of Snow Leopard Server (Mac OS X Server 10.6). However, by the time the operating system was released, all references to this feature had been silently removed from its features page. Apple has not commented regarding the omission.|$|E
