5000|$|The {{following}} example shows why the [...] "faithfully flat topology" [...] {{without any}} finiteness conditions does not behave well. Suppose X is the affine line over an algebraically closed field k. For each closed point x of X we can consider the local ring Rx at this point, {{which is a}} discrete valuation ring whose spectrum has one closed point and one open (generic) point. We glue these spectra together by identifying their <b>open</b> <b>points</b> to get a scheme Y. There is a natural map from Y to X. The affine line X is covered by the sets Spec(Rx) which are open in the faithfully flat topology, and each of these sets has a natural map to Y, and these maps are the same on intersections. However they cannot be combined to give a map from X to Y, because the underlying spaces of X and Y have different topologies.|$|E
50|$|With 400+ {{teams and}} more than 8,900 riders, the IHSA divides the country into eight “Zones” {{organized}} geographically. Every Zone {{is divided into two}} to five regions, and each region ranges with approximately five to fifteen collegiate teams. The teams within the region compete against each other in eight to ten horse shows per year. Each place (first through sixth) has an assigned point value that accumulates throughout the seasons. When riders acquire thirty-six (or twenty-eight for <b>Open)</b> <b>points</b> in their division, they are then qualified to compete in the Regional Finals competition. The top two riders in each class move on to compete in the Zone Finals and the top rider from Zones move on to the national competition. The high-point team (and in some zones, the top two teams) from each region also compete in Zones for the chance to represent their zone at the National Competition. Nationals are when both hunt seat and western teams come together to compete with teams from across the country. Both the 2013 and 2014 National Competitions were held in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. In 2013, they were at the Farm Show Complex on May 2-5 and in 2014, they were at the Pennsylvania Farm and Exposition Center on May 1-4.

50|$|The Flexible Plug and Play project, {{according}} to the submission documents, will test a number of so called smart devices on a distribution network {{in order to improve}} its efficiency and to allow more power to flow through it without reinforcement.1) Dynamic Line Rating device. The maximum current an overhead power line can carry is an ever changing value affected by the weather. However, in distribution networks the conventional approach is to operate lines with static or seasonal limits. In theory dynamic line rating allows constant monitoring of a line’s capacity. Knowing the limits of a section of the network at any moment will help to operate the network at its peak.2) Automatic Voltage Control. An AVC device monitors voltage levels and automatically adjusts them within pre set limits. In the Flexible Plug and Play project it is envisaged AVCs will be working as part of an Automatic Network Management system.3) Modern Protection Relay. The existing network uses directional over-current (DOC) protection relays which cannot handle reverse power flows. It’s said the modern protection relay will be designed to overcome this problem. It will be tested at the March and Peterborough sub stations.4) Frequent Use Switches. The distribution network in the test area uses isolator switches at Normally <b>Open</b> <b>Points</b> (NOPs) however, they are not designed for frequent use and have to be reset manually. Frequent Use Switches would be controlled remotely, allowing different network configurations to be used.5) Quadrature Booster transformer. Quad Boosters are common on transmission networks but not on distribution grids. According to the Flexible Plug and Play progress report dated June 2012 a Quad Booster could be fitted at the British Sugar factory site in Wissington. Apparently the Combined Heat & Power plant operated by British Sugar has seasonal limits on generation export due to the suboptimal loading of the three incoming 33kV circuits. The Quadrature Booster will be connected to one of the circuits to ensure load balancing and it will enable the export of additional generation from the CHP unit onto the electricity grid.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{programming}} language concept called an open point is introduced and discussed. <b>Open</b> <b>points</b> are meant to cover a collection of behavioral parameters of executable programs. Such parameters add openness to a program, which {{may be used to}} specialize the program in a variety of directions, all of which are intended to preserve the basic flavor of the original application. The paper gives a survey of different mechanisms from existing programming languages that, in some way or another, may be used as <b>open</b> <b>points.</b> In particular, the paper elaborates on the hook mechanism, as used in several Lisp environments. It is argued that <b>open</b> <b>points</b> should be supported by a set of tools.

The critical modes prevention by means of a closed-loop control synthesis is also shown and the connection between flexible dynamics and capture system design is highlighted, giving engineering answers to most challenging <b>open</b> <b>points</b> to lead to a ready to flight solution.
