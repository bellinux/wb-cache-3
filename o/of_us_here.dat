25|$|Cemeteries for {{deceased}} {{prisoners were}} gradually opened near the camps. It {{was a point}} of honour for the survivors {{to take care of}} their comrades’ final resting places. Most often, each nationality had its own reserved patch. In certain camps, such as Gardelegen, veritable monuments were erected. Roger Pelletier motivated his comrades: “Doesn’t it fall to us, who have known them, to all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>here</b> who are their great family, to raise, in the cemetery where they rest, a monument of the French soul that, spreading above them like an aegis, will be above our dead, when we have left, as a memory and a goodbye?” Wilhelm Doegen estimates the number of dead in the camps at 118,159 but serious doubts surround this number, notably because Doegen failed to take certain diseases into account. Also according to Doegen, Russia suffered the heaviest losses (perhaps explained by the poorer nutrition of Russians, most of whom did not receive packages from their families) with a little over 70,000 dead, followed by France with 17,069 deaths, Romania with 12,512, and then Italy and the United Kingdom.|$|E
500|$|The series {{begins with}} opening credits that depict {{traditional}} Roman myths, such as Romulus and Remus, the city's foundation mythos. For inspiration, visual effects and design company A52 explored museums, {{read the script}} and researched Roman history. They created the opening sequence entirely in-house. VFX artist Kirk Balden said of production, [...] "On many projects, you start off with storyboards and everyone has {{a good idea of}} what it's going to look like when it's completed. This project was very experimental right to the very end. The tone of it is pretty much unlike anything we've done and most of what any <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>here</b> have seen. There's a lot there that creatively sets the stage for the series." ...|$|E

Ayyadurai later disputed how the event was characterized, tweeting that the [...] "establishment" [...] wanted to block attendance and media coverage, and sought a [...] "Race War to divide us". In his remarks, he said that [...] "all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>here,</b> in many ways, are true patriots because, {{in spite of that}} noise out there, we're here to stand up for something very fundamental, which is called free speech." ...|$|E

We told a story about a young girl coming out and her life around it. That was a big lesson to all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>here.</b> It's really all about the story. If you can make people care on a human level, it's not sexual preference. It's about the human experience." ...|$|E
2500|$|Over 1,000 people {{attended}} a vigil in commemoration of Morley's life at St Anne's Church, Soho on 5 November 2004. Speeches were given by his friends, {{and one on}} behalf of the Mayor of London Ken Livingstone. Those who could not get into the church due to overcrowding stood in the street with candles. Morley's friend said, [...] "This is the second time he was {{in the wrong place at}} the wrong time, but for all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>here</b> today he will be in the right place at the right time, which is a very special place in all of our hearts."

2500|$|While President Obama {{expressed}} {{surprise at}} the decision, stating [...] "I think all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>here</b> in the United States were surprised, disappointed and angry about the release", the U.S. government was aware that a release was possible. The deputy head of the U.S. embassy in London, Frank LeBaron, {{wrote in a letter}} to the Scottish first minister Alex Salmond that the U.S. believed al-Megrahi should remain in prison for his role in downing Pan Am flight 103 in 1988, and continued: [...] "Nevertheless, if Scottish authorities come to the conclusion that Megrahi must be released from Scottish custody, the U.S. position is that conditional release on compassionate grounds would be a far preferable alternative to prisoner transfer, which we strongly oppose." [...] This same letter stressed the importance to the United States of America of a 3-months prognosis, despite it not being a legal requirement in Scotland: [...] "any such release should only come after the results of independent and comprehensive medical exams clearly establishing that Megrahi's life expectancy is less than three months".|$|E

2500|$|Lorde's work {{on black}} {{feminism}} {{continues to be}} examined by scholars today. [...] Jennifer C. Nash examines how black feminists acknowledge their identities and find love for themselves through those differences. [...] Nash cites Lorde, who writes, [...] "I urge each one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>here</b> to reach down into that deep place of knowledge inside herself and touch that terror and loathing of any difference that lives there. See whose face it wears. Then the personal as the political can begin to illuminate all our choices." [...] Nash explains that Lorde is urging black feminists to embrace politics rather than fear it, which will lead to an improvement in society for them. [...] Lorde adds, [...] "Black women sharing close ties with each other, politically or emotionally, are not the enemies of Black men. Too frequently, however, some Black men attempt to rule by fear those Black women who are more ally than enemy." [...] Lorde’s 1979 essay “Sexism: An American Disease in Blackface” {{is a sort of}} rallying cry to confront sexism in the black community in order to eradicate the violence within it. Lorde insists that the fight between black women and men must end in order to end racist politics.|$|E
2500|$|McKinney gained {{national}} attention for remarks she made following the 2001 US attacks, {{charging that the}} United States had advance knowledge of the attacks and that US President George W. Bush may have been aware and allowed them to happen, allegedly due to his father's business interests: [...] "It is known that President Bush's father, through The Carlyle Group, had–at {{the time of the}} attacks–joint business interests with the bin Laden construction company and many defense industry holdings, the stocks of which have soared since September 11." [...] In the month that followed the attacks, when New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani refused to cash a $10 million check written by Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal in light of the Prince's suggestion that the attacks were an indication that the United States [...] "should re-examine its policies in the Middle East and adopt a more balanced stand toward the Palestinian cause," [...] McKinney published an open letter to the Saudi Prince. She expressed her disappointment at Giuliani's action and stated, [...] "Let me say that there are {{a growing number of people}} in the United States who recognize, like you, that U.S. policy in the Middle East needs serious examination...Your Royal Highness, many <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>here</b> in the United States have long been concerned about reports by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch that reveal a pattern of excessive, and often indiscriminate, use of lethal force by Israeli security forces in situations where Palestinian demonstrators were unarmed and posed no threat of death or serious injury to the security forces or to others." ...|$|E
2500|$|By the 83rd Minnesota Legislative Session Lindner {{had already}} faced an ethics {{complaint}} before. This {{was a result}} of his reaction to the request of Rep. Paymar. His first complaint stemmed from a May 2000 incident after the Republican Party took control of the House and some members felt that the prayers opening the session were becoming too sectarian. [...] "For many, things went too far when House leaders recently brought in a choir to open the day's session with a musical rendition of the Apostles' Creed." [...] In light of this Rep. Michael Paymar (DFL-St. Paul) who is Jewish said [...] "I would like {{to be part of that}} moment where a religious leader gets up before us and has a prayer. But I would like that to be non-denominational, and I would like it to be respectful of who I am." [...] In response to his and others' concerns a rule was passed [...] "requiring that in the future, prayer be non-denominational." [...] In responding to Paymar, Lindner said [...] "You know, we're told there's one God and one mediator between God and man. That man is Jesus Christ. And most <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>here</b> are Christians. And we shouldn't be left not able to pray in the name of our God....And if you don't like it, you may have to like it-Or just don't come. I don't come sometimes for some prayers here....We have that privilege, and you need to exercise it. But don't impose your irreligious left views on me." [...] Rep. Matt Entenza (DFL-St. Paul), called on Lindner [...] "to rethink his comments. When Lindner refused to reply, Entenza put forth a 'protest of dissent' petition asking the House Ethics Committee to reprimand Lindner. It was signed by 60 House members, including eight Republicans." [...] Later “The ethics panel found the comments ‘regrettable’, but took no disciplinary action.” ...|$|E

2500|$|The League of Women Voters had {{announced}} {{a schedule of}} debates similar to 1976, three presidential and one vice presidential. No one had {{much of a problem}} with this until it was announced that Rep. John Anderson might be invited to participate along with Carter and Reagan. Carter steadfastly refused to participate with Anderson included, and Reagan refused to debate without him. It took months of negotiations for the League of Women Voters to finally put it together. It was held on September 21, 1980 in the Baltimore Convention Center. Reagan said of Carter's refusal to debate: [...] "He [...] knows that he couldn't win a debate even if it were held in the Rose Garden before an audience of Administration officials with the questions being asked by Jody Powell." [...] The League of Women Voters promised the Reagan campaign that the debate stage would feature an empty chair to represent the missing president. Carter was very upset about the planned chair stunt, and at the last minute convinced the League to take it out. The debate was moderated by Bill Moyers. Anderson, who many thought would handily dispatch the former Governor, managed only a draw, according to many in the media at that time. The Illinois congressman, who had been as high as 20% in some polls, and {{at the time of the}} debate was over 10%, dropped to about 5% soon after. Anderson failed to substantively engage Reagan, instead he started off by criticizing Carter: [...] "Governor Reagan is not responsible for what has happened over the last four years, nor am I. The man who should be here tonight to respond to those charges chose not to attend," [...] to which Reagan added: [...] "It's a shame now that there are only two <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>here</b> debating, because the two that are here are in more agreement than disagreement." [...] In one moment in the debate, Reagan commented on a rumor that Anderson had invited Senator Ted Kennedy to be his running mate by asking the candidate directly, [...] "John, would you really prefer Teddy Kennedy to me?" ...|$|E

Tell my brother Two-Dogs to write to me again. Miss Hyde's father died two weeks ago, and I am very sorry. I remember all of my friends. If you don't answer my letter soon, I'll feel bad. I don't always answer your letter soon, but it is because I can not write. As soon as I get so that I can write myself, I will write as often as I can. Tell Brave Bull that Dora (Her Pipe) has been a little sick, but is most well now. Tell if my grandfather is well. If he gets sick tell me. You wrote to my cousin Robert and told him that you had a house to live in, and lots of pigs and cows and such things, and I was very glad. You've got a white man's house to live in now and I am anxious to learn all that I can, so that I can come home by and by and live with you. I hear that they have a big school out there and it makes me very glad. If you can, come again, and tell me if you can come again, when.
