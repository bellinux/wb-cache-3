5|$|A {{medical report}} {{documented}} that wearing an underwire bra in the Tropics, specifically East Africa, {{can lead to}} severe furuncular myiasis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>breast</b> caused by the Tumbu fly. The eggs and larvae from this fly are deposited in clothing, especially {{along the length of}} the metal wires of an underwire bra, and can only be killed by applying heat through ironing. It is almost impossible when ironing a traditional underwire bra to achieve the required heat to kill the larvae deposited along the underwire.|$|E
50|$|Anisomastia is {{a medical}} {{condition}} {{in which there is}} a severe asymmetry or unequalness in <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>breasts,</b> generally related to a difference in volume. In other words, when one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>breasts</b> is much larger than the other. In contrast to anisomastia, a slightly asymmetry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>breasts</b> is common. Anisomastia may be corrected by surgical breast augmentation or reduction.|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} authors {{have noted that}} the two explanations, as a {{chemical}} defence against predators and as a chemical defence against ectoparasites, are not mutually exclusive, and evidence for both explanations exists. The fact that the highest concentrations of toxins are bound in the feathers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>breast</b> and belly, in both pitohuis and ifrits, has caused scientists {{to suggest that the}} toxins rub off on eggs and nestlings providing protection against predators and nest parasites.|$|E
5|$|Sebaceous glands {{are also}} found in hairless areas (glabrous skin) of the eyelids, nose, penis, labia minora, the inner mucosal {{membrane}} of the cheek, and nipples. Some sebaceous glands have unique names. Sebaceous glands on the lip and mucosa of the cheek, and on the genitalia, are known as Fordyce spots, and glands on the eyelids are known as meibomian glands. Sebaceous glands <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>breast</b> are also known as Montgomery's glands.|$|E

5|$|The {{design of}} the medal is modeled after one used for the Hero of the Soviet Union. Unlike the Hero of the Soviet Union, Hero of Socialist Labor and the Hero of the Russian Federation titles, there is no {{engraving}} on the reverse of the star. The ribbon also copies the Soviet Hero medal's ribbon, since a flag design was also {{used to make the}} ribbon of that medal. The medal is always worn in full on the left side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>breast</b> above all other medals and orders. Chapter 4, Article 69 of Law N 288-З states that any awards and titles presented by the Soviet Union and the Byelorussian SSR must be placed after awards from the Republic of Belarus.|$|E
5|$|The {{face and}} {{surrounding}} areas, including the lores, supercilium, ear-coverts, cheeks and throat are a white buff-orange. Below, the belly and breast are a rich cinnamon, darkening to an orange-cinnamon {{at the sides}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>breast.</b> The rear flanks and undertail-covert feathers are rufous. In worn plumage, the color may be uneven in the lower parts and lighter in hue. The upper mandible of the bill is black, and the lower is gray with a black tip. The iris and legs are dark brown. Juveniles of the species resemble adults but for the base of their beaks being yellow, proportionately shorter, and their overall coloring being less vibrant.|$|E

25|$|Another {{reported}} symptom {{complex of}} breast cancer is Paget's disease <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>breast.</b> This syndrome presents as skin changes resembling eczema, such as redness, discoloration, or mild flaking of the nipple skin. As Paget's disease <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>breast</b> advances, symptoms may include tingling, itching, increased sensitivity, burning, and pain. There may also be discharge from the nipple. Approximately half of women diagnosed with Paget's disease <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>breast</b> also have a lump in the breast.|$|E
25|$|Pseudoptosis — The {{indication}} is {{the sagging}} {{of the skin}} of the lower half (inferior pole) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>breast,</b> featuring the nipple located either at or above the inframammary fold (IMF); as such, pseudoptosis is a usual consequence of postpartum milk-gland atrophy. The nipple is located either at or above the IMF, while the lower half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>breast</b> sags below the IMF. Pseudoptosis usually occurs when the woman ceases nursing, because the milk glands have atrophied, and so reduced the volume <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>breast,</b> thus the sagging of the breast-envelope skin.|$|E

50|$|Either {{pulling the}} skin too little or showing too much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peaks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bulges {{created by a}} skin pulling {{technique}} may cause <b>the</b> curvature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cleavage to be visibly different from the curve that would exist for real <b>breasts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same size. <b>The</b> parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>breasts</b> visible in <b>the</b> cleavage will appear to curve away {{in a manner that}} does not line up with <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>breasts.</b>|$|R
50|$|Making {{cleavage}} appear {{deeper and}} <b>the</b> <b>breasts</b> look fuller alongside the cleavage using makeup is achieved using shading effects. <b>The</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cleavage {{is made to}} look deeper by using a darker makeup colour than <b>the</b> base colour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> skin in a vertical line between <b>the</b> <b>breasts,</b> while <b>the</b> most prominent areas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>breasts</b> (either side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cleavage) are made to look larger or more protruding by <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> a paler colour.

25|$|The {{dimensions}} and weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>breast</b> vary widely among women. A small-to-medium-sized breast weighs 500grams (1.1 pounds) or less, {{and a large}} breast can weigh approximately 750 to 1,000 grams (1.7 to 2.2 pounds) or more. The tissue composition ratios <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>breast</b> also vary among women. Some women's breasts have varying proportions of glandular tissue than of adipose or connective tissues. The fat-to-connective-tissue ratio determines the density or firmness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>breast.</b> During a woman's life, her breasts change size, shape, and weight due to hormonal changes during puberty, the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, breastfeeding, and menopause.|$|E

40|$|<b>THE</b> {{total removal}} <b>of</b> <b>breasts</b> from small {{laboratory}} animals was first described by Long and McLean (1922). They attempted <b>the</b> removal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>breasts</b> from 8 -day-old rats, but succeeded {{in only a}} small number of cases. Fekete (1939) studied <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>breasts</b> in dba and C 57 B 1 mice, before attempting <b>the</b> total removal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>breasts</b> from 10 -day-old mice by extirpation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fat pads in <b>the</b> region <b>of</b> each nipple. There was a very high mortality rate in the operated animals. Amongst the survivors she reported a 75 per cent breast tumour incidence after their infection with mammary tumour agent (MTA). Faulkin and DeOme (1960) described a method for <b>the</b> removal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 4 th <b>breast</b> in 3 -week-old female mice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> C 3 H strain. They made an inverted " Y "-shaped incision along the abdominal midline and laterally between the 4 th and 5 th nipples midway down each hind leg. Then, by pinning back the skin flaps so obtained, they exposed <b>the</b> 4 th <b>breasts</b> and, after cauterisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main blood vessels, dissected them out of their fat pads.

25|$|Anaesthestic {{preparation}} — To limit bleeding {{during the}} liposuction, the proper degree of vasoconstriction of the breast's circulatory system is established with an anaesthetic solution (lidocaine + epinephrine in saline solution) that is infiltrated {{to the deep}} and the superficial plains of each breast. Using a blunt-tip, multi-perforation cannula, the anaesthetic infiltration begins at the deep plane <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>breast,</b> and continues as the cannula is withdrawn towards the superficial plane <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>breast.</b> The entire area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>breast</b> is infiltrated with the anaesthetic solution until the tissues become tumescent (firm). Moreover, {{as required by the}} patient's physique, an intravenous (IV) pressure bag can be applied to hasten the infiltration; after the anaesthetic has numbed the breast, the plastic surgeon begins the lipectomy breast-reduction.|$|E
