5|$|Between 1815 and 1850, some 800,000 {{immigrants}} came to {{the colonies}} of British North America, mainly from the British Isles {{as part of the}} Great Migration of Canada. These new arrivals included some Gaelic-speaking Highland Scots displaced by the Highland Clearances to Nova Scotia. The Irish Potato Famine of the 1840s significantly increased the pace of Irish immigration to Prince Edward Island and the Province of Canada, with over 35,000 distressed individuals landing in Toronto in 1847 and 1848. Descendants of Francophone and Anglophone northern Europeans who arrived in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries are often referred to as <b>old</b> <b>stock</b> Canadians.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, {{the section}} of the Kolsås Line in Bærum closed due to {{disagreements}} between the two counties of Oslo and Akershus on how much Akershus should pay to purchase services from Oslo Sporveier. After a year of replacement buses, the line was reopened, only to be closed again in 2006 for an upgrade to metro standard. Disagreements between the two counties means the upgrade will be done separately on {{the two sides of the}} municipal boundary, with the Oslo side opening first. By 2010, the upgraded part had reached Bjørnsletta station in Oslo. In 2003, the Ring Line opened from Ullevål Stadion station on the Sognsvann Line to Storo station. The line will create a loop, which will connect to neighbourhoods such as Nydalen and Bjerke north of the city centre. In July 2004, construction caused a tunnel to collapse on the Grorud Line—the system's busiest—forcing a shutdown of this line until December and creating havoc on the overloaded replacement buses. The ring was completed onwards to Carl Berners plass on the Grorud Line via Sinsen in 2006. In 2007, the system started taking delivery of the new MX3000 trains, which replaced all the <b>old</b> <b>stock.</b> By 2010, all T1000, T1300 and T2000 trains had been retired. In 2010, the Holmenkollen Line reopened with metro standard, after it had been closed for renovation for a year.|$|E

25|$|The <b>old</b> <b>Stock</b> Exchange Tower became largely {{redundant}} with Big Bang, which deregulated {{many of the}} Stock Exchange's {{activities as}} it enabled an increased use of computerised systems that allowed dealing rooms to take over work previously done by face-to-face trading.

25|$|To {{replace the}} last of the <b>old</b> <b>stock,</b> a pair of Class 458 Junipers were {{transferred}} from South West Trains for use as spares. They remained in their existing livery but with Gatwick Express branding. Their seating was modified from high density 3+2 seating configuration to 2+2 configuration, some seating being replaced with luggage racks. However, these units never entered service and returned to South West Trains. The Class 460s were withdrawn from service in September 2012 to be merged with the mechanically similar Class 458 units used by South West Trains in order to provide more stock at peak times.|$|E
25|$|In the mid 19th century {{politics}} in Delaware were {{divided between the}} majority Whigs and minority Democrats. The Whigs were the party in opposition to U.S. President Andrew Jackson, his political successors and their policies. They were for a strong Union, good banks and a protective tariff. As the primary heirs to the old Federalist Party in Delaware, their greatest strength was among the <b>old</b> <b>stock,</b> rural, agricultural population in Kent and Sussex County. Conversely, the Democrats were in support of Jacksonian policies, and found their strength in New Castle County and among Quakers, Ulster-Scots and the more recent immigrants.|$|E

25|$|The risk to sappers is {{far greater}} because they may {{be called upon to}} perform {{clearance}} as tactics dictate, including in all-weather conditions and on schedule. Command may accept casualties in the process. Furthermore, it is accepted that mine clearance will be imperfect and there may be casualties from undiscovered mines. One advantage is that, in military operations, sappers are dealing with recently laid mines that respond predictably to clearance, have not 'migrated', and have not degraded (unless <b>old</b> <b>stock</b> was used). In this they are often aided by technical intelligence on the current adversary's mines, which are usually of a single type.|$|E
25|$|The city is {{recognised}} for its mix {{of modern}} architecture which intersects with an extensive range of {{nineteenth and early twentieth}} century buildings. Some of the most architecturally noteworthy historic buildings include the World Heritage Site-listed Royal Exhibition Building, constructed over a two-year period for the Melbourne International Exhibition in 1880, A.C. Goode House, a Neo Gothic building located on Collins Street designed by Wright, Reed & Beaver (1891), William Pitt's Venetian Gothic style <b>Old</b> <b>Stock</b> Exchange (1888), William Wardell's Gothic Bank (1883) which features some of Melbourne's finest interiors, the incomplete Parliament House, St Paul's Cathedral (1891) and Flinders Street Station (1909), which was the busiest commuter railway station in the world in the mid-1920s.|$|E
25|$|From 2000 onwards, new {{trains in}} the form of Class 460 units were {{introduced}} to replace the <b>old</b> <b>stock.</b> By 2004 just six sets, formed into three 5-car rakes, were still in use with Gatwick Express. By January 2005 this had decreased to four sets. The sets were used sporadically during early 2005 but their use declined as the Class 460 reliability improved. Their final scheduled use was on 28 July following a special trip involving the two remaining Class 73 locomotives. They were replaced by two Class 458 units hired from South West Trains. They were used a few times after this date for emergency cover, but have now been withdrawn.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} settlers were roughly 250 Mdewakanton Dakota {{who lived}} permanently at Black Dog camp. Starting in the 1850s, <b>Old</b> <b>stock</b> Americans {{from the east}} coast and French Canadians moved into eastern Dakota County near Saint Paul. A decade later, major European immigration began with settlers from Ireland, Scotland, and Great Britain. By the 1900s {{there were a few}} Scandinavians from Sweden, Norway, and Denmark but these ethnic groups were mostly concentrated towards Lakeville. Those from Germany and Eastern Europe would gradually join the minority from the packing jobs in nearby South St. Paul. Irish descendants maintained the majority through the early 1950s owing to the town's origin, overall land ownership, and the practice of marrying within ethnic clans. The early 20th century's permanent population remained very low as the Minnesota River's lack of bridges and streetcar connection isolated the area from development, preventing people from moving south of the river. The lake-side houses around Crystal Lake and Orchard Lake however attracted several various immigrant and first-generation wealthier individuals to temporarily settle or own land in the town limits.|$|E

The Ring Line was opened from Carl Berners plass to Sinsen on 22 August 2006, and the section from Tøyen to Carl Berners plass started being served by lines 4 and 6. The metro system started taking delivery of the new MX3000 units in 2007, which would replace the <b>old</b> <b>stock.</b> From 18 August 2008, the line's frequency on Line 5 was increased from four to eight trains per hour, although the extra trains terminate at Stortinget. By 2010, all T1000 stock had been retired. From 9 December 2012 the Grorud Line has been connected with the Røa Line in the west. Meanwhile, all services on Line 5 were extended to Røa instead of half terminating at Stortinget.|$|E
