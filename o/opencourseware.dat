5|$|MIT <b>OpenCourseWare</b> – the <b>OpenCourseWare</b> {{movement}} {{started in}} 1999 when the University of Tübingen in Germany published videos of lectures online for its timms initiative (Tübinger Internet Multimedia Server). The OCW movement only took off, however, with {{the launch of}} MIT <b>OpenCourseWare</b> and the Open Learning Initiative at Carnegie Mellon University in October 2002. The movement was soon reinforced by the launch of similar projects at Yale, Utah State University, the University of Michigan and the University of California Berkeley.|$|E
5|$|MIT {{has kept}} pace with and helped to advance the digital age. In {{addition}} to developing the predecessors to modern computing and networking technologies, students, staff, and faculty members at Project MAC, the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, and the Tech Model Railroad Club wrote {{some of the earliest}} interactive computer video games like Spacewar! and created much of modern hacker slang and culture. Several major computer-related organizations have originated at MIT since the 1980s: Richard Stallman's GNU Project and the subsequent Free Software Foundation were founded in the mid-1980s at the AI Lab; the MIT Media Lab was founded in 1985 by Nicholas Negroponte and Jerome Wiesner to promote research into novel uses of computer technology; the World Wide Web Consortium standards organization was founded at the Laboratory for Computer Science in 1994 by Tim Berners-Lee; the <b>OpenCourseWare</b> project has made course materials for over 2,000 MIT classes available online free of charge since 2002; and the One Laptop per Child initiative to expand computer education and connectivity to children worldwide was launched in 2005.|$|E

It is suggested as a resource by the Sibley Music Library and by libraries at other universities such as Stanford University, University of California, Los Angeles, Brown University, University of Pennsylvania, University of Wisconsin–Madison, Oberlin Conservatory of Music, Manhattan School of Music University of Maryland, University of Washington, University of Cincinnati, University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee, Appalachian State University in the US, McGill University in Canada, University of Oxford, University of Cambridge, University of Edinburgh University of Bristol in the UK, University of Melbourne in Australia, and others.|$|E
500|$|In 2001, {{inspired}} by the open source and open access movements, MIT launched <b>OpenCourseWare</b> to make the lecture notes, problem sets, syllabuses, exams, and lectures from {{the great majority of}} its courses available online for no charge, though without any formal accreditation for coursework completed. While the cost of supporting and hosting the project is high, OCW expanded in 2005 to include other universities {{as a part of the}} <b>OpenCourseWare</b> Consortium, which currently includes more than 250 academic institutions with content available in at least six languages. In 2011, MIT announced it would offer formal certification (but not credits or degrees) to online participants completing coursework in its [...] "MITx" [...] program, for a modest fee. The [...] "edX" [...] online platform supporting MITx was initially developed in partnership with Harvard and its analogous [...] "Harvardx" [...] initiative. The courseware platform is open source, and other universities have already joined and added their own course content.|$|E

As {{a result of this}} conference, 12 universities petitioned the government to institute a program of <b>OpenCourseWare</b> in China.

50|$|As {{a result}} of this petition, the Chinese {{government}} approved to institute the CORE(China Open Resources for Education) to promote the <b>OpenCourseWare</b> in Chinese Universities, with Fun-Den Wang (the head of IETF) as chairman. The CORE is an NGO supported by Hewlett Foundation, Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and other foundations. According to CORE's website, it has nearly 100 Chinese universities as members, including the most prestigious universities in China, such as Tsinghua University, Peking University and Shanghai Jiaotong University. This organization organized volunteers to translate foreign <b>OpenCourseWare,</b> mainly MIT <b>OpenCourseWare</b> into Chinese and to promote the application of <b>OpenCourseWare</b> in Chinese universities. In February 2008, 347 courses had been translated into Chinese and 245 of them were used by 200 professors in courses involving a total of 8,000 students. It also tried to translate some Chinese courses into English, but the number is not too much and some are only title translated. There have also been produced 148 comparative studies comparing MIT curriculum with Chinese curriculum using the MIT <b>OpenCourseWare</b> material. CORE's offices are hosted within the China Central Radio and Television University, and they receive partial funding from the IETF and the Hewlett foundation. They also host annual conferences on open education, and the 2008 conference was co-located with the international <b>OpenCourseWare</b> Consortium conference, which brought a large amount of foreign participants. The website has been offline since 2013.|$|E
