5|$|A Paleolithic culture around 30,000BC {{constitutes}} {{the first known}} habitation of the Japanese archipelago. This was followed from around 14,000BC (the start of the Jōmon period) by a Mesolithic to Neolithic semi-sedentary hunter-gatherer culture characterized by pit dwelling and rudimentary agriculture, including by ancestors of contemporary Ainu people and Yamato people. Decorated clay vessels from this period {{are some of the}} oldest surviving examples <b>of</b> <b>pottery</b> in the world. Around 300 BC, the Yayoi people began to enter the Japanese islands, intermingling with the Jōmon. The Yayoi period, starting around 500BC, saw the introduction of practices like wet-rice farming, a new style <b>of</b> <b>pottery</b> and metallurgy, introduced from China and Korea.|$|E

5|$|Some 500fragments <b>of</b> <b>pottery</b> {{were found}} {{dating from the}} medieval period. Most of these were parts of jars, jugs or pipkins and {{were found in the}} area of the kitchen range. Most of it was {{produced}} locally, although 13sherds of Stamford Ware, fragments of two jugs from North France, and two small pieces of Saintonge pottery have been identified. Only a few wooden bowls were recovered. Much more pottery was found dating from the post-medieval period and later. Again most of this had been manufactured in England, especially in Staffordshire. Fragments <b>of</b> <b>pottery</b> from abroad included pieces from a Westerwald mug, a jug from Cologne and items of Chinese porcelain. The excavations produced over 4,000sherds of glass, dating from the 12th to the 20thcenturies, but only 16 of these came from the period before the dissolution. A total of 1,170fragments from clay tobacco pipes were found, dating from about 1580 to the early 20thcentury.|$|E

40|$|It is {{essentially}} and indispensably {{important for the}} research <b>of</b> ancient <b>potteries</b> to know the age of their manufacturing. Though the thermoluminescence method is a typical and well-used tool for estimating the age <b>of</b> <b>potteries,</b> {{it is not necessarily}} accepted by the researchers <b>of</b> <b>potteries,</b> especially those <b>of</b> art history. In the present work, we applied a thermoluminescence method to the shards of Tang dynasty three-color glazed pottery（Sancai, or tri-colors）which were provided by the Archaeological Institute of Henan Province. The results are consistent with the ages shown from the archaeological aspects of view. This work shows the effectiveness and validity of TL method to determine the age <b>of</b> ancient <b>potteries</b> for the researches of art histories...|$|R

5|$|Within {{the chamber}} were placed human remains, {{which have been}} {{discovered}} and removed at intervals during the {{nineteenth and early twentieth}} centuries. Early twentieth century excavation found two separate deposits of bone, each buried atop a stone slab, one higher than the other.

5|$|After 4500 BCE the Ertebølle {{culture of}} northwestern origin entered a ceramic phase {{with its own}} forms <b>of</b> <b>pottery</b> (characteristic pointed bottoms). They lived by the Baltic Sea shores and were {{specialized}} in utilizing {{the resources of the}} sea, thus still representing the Mesolithic ways of life. At their settlement in Dąbki near Koszalin Stroke-ornamented pottery was found, obtained probably through trade with the Danubian people.|$|E
5|$|After the Iron Age {{occupation}} {{may have}} {{continued into the}} Roman era indicated by the discovery <b>of</b> <b>pottery</b> fragments, a small stone statue of Mars possibly from a Roman temple and coins of Claudius Gothicus and Valentinian II. The site may still have been occupied into the Anglo-Saxon period. Several of the finds were uncovered during excavations by Harold St George Gray in 1922, although the coin dating from around 370 was discovered in 1945 and a Romano-British relief in the inner defensive ditch in 1974. The relief was given to North Somerset Museum, and loaned to Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{exterior}} of the Pont du Gard is rough and relatively unfinished, the builders took care to ensure that the interior of the water conduit was as smooth as possible so that the flow of water would not be obstructed. The walls of the conduit were constructed from dressed masonry and the floor from concrete. Both were covered with a stucco incorporating minute shards <b>of</b> <b>pottery</b> and tile. It was painted with olive oil and covered with maltha, a mixture of slaked lime, pork grease and the viscous juice of unripe figs. This produced a surface that was both smooth and durable.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{excavations}} {{of several}} sites in Tamil Nadu and Kerala have yielded remnants from the Sangam era, such as different kinds <b>of</b> <b>pottery,</b> pottery with inscriptions, imported ceramic ware, industrial objects, brick structures and spinning whorls. Techniques such as stratigraphy and paleography have helped establish {{the date of}} these items to the Sangam era. The excavated artifacts have provided evidence for existence of different economic activities mentioned in Sangam literature such as agriculture, weaving, smithy, gem cutting, building construction, pearl fishing and painting.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological finds {{unearthed}} in the Badajoz {{area have}} been dated to the Bronze Age. Megalithic tombs are dated {{as far back}} as 4000 BC, while many of the steles found are from the Late Bronze Age. Other finds include weapons such as axes and swords, everyday items <b>of</b> <b>pottery</b> and utensils, and various items of jewellery such as bracelets. Archaeological excavations have revealed remnants from the Lower Paleolithic period. Artifacts have also been found at the Roman town of Colonia Civitas Pacensis in the Badajoz area, although a significant number of larger artifacts were found in Mérida.|$|E

5|$|Decorative {{arts for}} luxury {{consumers}} included fine pottery, silver and bronze vessels and implements, and glassware. The manufacture <b>of</b> <b>pottery</b> {{in a wide}} range of quality was important to trade and employment, as were the glass and metalworking industries. Imports stimulated new regional centres of production. Southern Gaul became a leading producer of the finer red-gloss pottery (terra sigillata) that was a major item of trade in 1st-century Europe. Glassblowing was regarded by the Romans as originating in Syria in the 1st century BC, and by the 3rd century Egypt and the Rhineland had become noted for fine glass.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have lived}} {{in what is now}} Pennsylvania since at least 10,000 BC. The first {{settlers}} were Paleo-Indian nomadic hunters known from their stone tools. The hunter-gatherers of the Archaic period, which lasted locally from 7000 to 1000BC, used a greater variety of more sophisticated stone artefacts. The Woodland period marked the gradual transition to semi-permanent villages and horticulture, between 1000BC and 1500AD. Archeological evidence found in the state from this time includes a range <b>of</b> <b>pottery</b> types and styles, burial mounds, pipes, bows and arrow, and ornaments.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} known for some time that St Kilda was {{continuously}} inhabited for two millennia or more, from the Bronze Age to the 20th century. Recently, the first direct evidence of earlier Neolithic settlement emerged—shards <b>of</b> <b>pottery</b> of the Hebridean ware style, found to the east of the village. The subsequent discovery of a quarry for stone tools on Mullach Sgar above Village Bay led to finds of numerous stone hoe-blades, grinders and Skaill knives in the Village Bay cleitean—unique stone storage buildings (see below). These tools are also probably of Neolithic origin.|$|E
50|$|Several {{influences}} {{contributed to}} the emergence <b>of</b> studio <b>pottery</b> in the early 20th century: art pottery (for example {{the work of the}} Martin Brothers and William Moorcroft); the Arts and Crafts movement, the Bauhaus; a rediscovery <b>of</b> traditional artisan <b>pottery</b> and the excavation of large quantities <b>of</b> Song <b>pottery</b> in China.|$|R

5|$|The Maya {{developed}} their first civilization in the Preclassic period. Scholars continue to discuss when {{this era of}} Maya civilization began. Maya occupation at Cuello (modern-day Belize) has been carbon dated to around 2600 BC. Settlements were established around 1800 BC in the Soconusco region of the Pacific coast, and the Maya were already cultivating the staple crops of maize, beans, squash, and chili pepper. This period was characterized by sedentary communities and the introduction <b>of</b> <b>pottery</b> and fired clay figurines.|$|E

5|$|The {{campaigns of}} Attarsiya {{represent}} the earliest recorded Mycenaean Greek military {{activity on the}} Anatolian mainland, {{as well as the}} first conflict between Achaeans and Hittites. It appears that these military developments had a certain impact on the local populations. In this context, a decorated shard <b>of</b> <b>pottery</b> from the Hittite capital, Hattusa, depicts a warrior with body armor and boar's tusk helmet, typical of Achaean warfare, while the Hittite king offers a Mycenaean type thrusting sword to the Storm God, Teshub.|$|E
5|$|The {{death toll}} is unknown but {{traditionally}} {{thought to have}} been small, as only six verified deaths were recorded. This reasoning has recently been challenged {{on the grounds that the}} deaths of poor and middle-class people were not recorded, while the heat of the fire may have cremated many victims, leaving no recognisable remains. A melted piece <b>of</b> <b>pottery</b> on display at the Museum of London found by archaeologists in Pudding Lane, where the fire started, shows that the temperature reached 1250 °C.|$|E
5|$|The {{full extent}} of {{occupation}} and activity in the Motul de San José area is not well understood for the Postclassic Period. It is known {{that there was a}} moderate occupation of the area during the Early Postclassic period, between AD 1000 and AD 1250. Early Postclassic construction and ceramics have been identified at Motul de San José and all of its satellite sites, but construction was small scale and distribution <b>of</b> <b>pottery</b> was limited. La Trinidad de Nosotros was apparently a small village at this time and has produced some of the best examples of Early Postclassic ceramics.|$|E
50|$|The {{production}} of porcelain {{at the factory}} began in 1810.
