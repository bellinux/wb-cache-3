40|$|We {{apply the}} Morlet wavelet {{transform}} (MWT) for quantitatively analyzing proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic (MRS) signals, more precisely signals acquired at short echo time. These signals contain many resonating components whose frequencies {{are characteristic of}} the observed metabolites, and amplitudes {{are directly related to}} the concentrations of these metabolites. With these powerful properties, in vivo MRS can be considered as a unique non-invasive tool to explore biochemical compounds of living tissues. However, the analysis and quantification of these metabolite contributions are difficult due to the low signal-to-noise ratio, the number of <b>overlapping</b> <b>frequencies</b> and the contamination of the signal of interest with water and a baseline originating from macromolecules and lipids. The baseline is a major obstacle for MRS quantification as its shape and intensity are generally not known a priori. In this paper, we present the methodology to quantify the signals by the MWT. We assess the ability of the proposed method to recover parameters such as metabolite amplitudes, frequencies and damping factors while facing successively quantification challenges arising from the non-Lorentzian lineshapes, <b>overlapping</b> <b>frequencies,</b> and noise or baseline. Tests of the method are performed on simulated signals alone or combined with either in vitro acquisition and/or in vivo macromolecular signal acquired on a horizontal 4. 7 T scanner. In presence of the macromolecules, the amplitude parameter is correctly derived by the method, thanks to the time-scale representation of the wavelet which enables us to distinguish the two signals by their time decays and without any additional pre-processing...|$|E

40|$|For several years, {{the number}} of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) has been increasing, opening new {{perspectives}} {{in the field of}} precise positioning. Particularly, the European system, Galileo, is experiencing a prompt expansion with the launch, in 2015 and 2016, of 8 satellites belonging to the new Full Operational Capability (FOC) generation. Broadcasting new signals, with new modulations, the first studies addressing this system reveal promising level of precisions on both code and carrier phase observables. Yet, Galileo is far from being the only GNSS undergoing a noteworthy revolution. Alternatively, the Chinese program BeiDou, still in a developing phase, as well as the American GPS, currently undergoing a modernization of its signals, also knew major progress these last two years. Indeed, 7 new satellites have reached the initial BeiDou constellation, bringing to 20 {{the number of}} active satellites. Among them, 5 spacecraft inaugurated the Phase III generation, broadcasting the new B 1, B 2 and B 3 signals. Regarding GPS, the block IIF, made of L 5 signal broadcasting satellites, kept expanding but at a less steep rate than BeiDou or Galileo. In this study, we first estimated the individual precisions of each signals broadcast by the aforementioned GNSS. For this purpose, we created two short baselines of approximatively 5 meters between similar type receivers. We combined their measurements to form double differences, leaving in the position equations only multipath and receiver noise. The great expectations regarding Galileo’s quality turned into affirmations as long as we studied this system. As a matter of a fact, the code pseudoranges values of the 4 signals of Galileo we have considered (E 1, E 5 a, E 5 b, E 5 a+b) presented outstanding precisions (from 5 to 17 centimetres on code pseudoranges with an elevation mask of 10 degrees) when compared to GPS (from 12 to 20 centimetres on codes pseudoranges) and BeiDou (from 26 to 40 centimetres for codes and for phases) in identical conditions. Even though the precision of Galileo observables is noticeable, the influence of the poor geometry of the satellite constellation degrades in a significant way the resulting precision of the position estimated, no matter the recent {{increase in the number of}} satellites. Indeed, in this incomplete constellation, the addition of new satellites results in longer visibility period but not in larger number of satellites observed at a single epoch. Combining Galileo with GPS or BeiDou is a way to solve this issue, as the three systems have been designed to be compatible. Therefore, multi-GNSS relative positioning based on <b>overlapping</b> <b>frequencies</b> should entail better accuracy and reliability in position estimations. However, the differences between satellite systems induce inter-system biases (ISBs) inside the multi-GNSS equations of observation. The <b>overlapping</b> <b>frequencies</b> of these GNSS are the L 1 and L 5 frequencies of GPS with the E 1 and E 5 a signals of Galileo, respectively. As far as BeiDou is concerned, the B 2 signal of emitted by the Phase II BeiDou satellites corresponds to the E 5 b frequency of Galileo. Regarding the new Phase III satellites, the B 2 frequencies will correspond to the Galileo E 5 a+b signal and B 1 of BeiDou will be compatible with E 1 of Galileo and GPS. The combined use of these <b>overlapping</b> <b>frequencies</b> in zero baseline double differences (ZB DD) based on a unique pivot satellite is employed to resolve ISBs. This model removes all the satellite- and receiver-dependent error sources by differentiating and the zero baseline configuration allows atmospheric and multipath effects elimination. We conducted this study on the L 1 /E 1, L 5 /E 5 a, B 1 (phase II) /E 5 b <b>overlapping</b> <b>frequencies.</b> Our receivers were not able to receive the phase III signals of BeiDou satellites. An analysis of the long-term stability of ISBs (GPS- Galileo and Galileo - BeiDou) was conducted on various pairs of receivers over large time spans. The possible influence of temperature variations inside the receivers over ISB values was also investigated. Our study is based on the 6 multi-GNSS receivers (2 Septentrio PolaRx 4, 1 Septentrio PolaRxS, 1 Septentrio PolaRx 5 and 2 Trimble NetR 9) installed on the roof of our building in Liege. The estimated ISBs are then used as corrections in the multi- GNSS observation model and the resulting accuracy of multi-GNSS positioning is compared to GPS, Galileo and BeiDou standalone solutions...|$|E

Due to the unlicensed spectrum band growing needs and usage by many IEEE 802. 11 protocols, normal wireless radio operation sees high interference leading to high error rates on operational environments. We study the licensed bands and the char-acteristics of the unlicensed bands, as it is know that the licensed bands have a maximum limit of FCC interference for a licensed set of frequencies. The cognitive algorithm for this probabilistic model for the unlicensed users, uses a model which takes into account the threshold variable ratio Eb No and also calculates the lower-bound of the combined value of secondary user interference for <b>overlapping</b> <b>frequencies</b> with the primary user. By using simulation, we detect the primary user when the radio frequencies are known a priori and compare it when the frequencies are unknown and needs to cognitively detected.

40|$|A main {{parameter}} for {{the collision}} risk is the Passing Frequency. The collision risk model, originally developed by P. R. Reich for air routes uses besides other parameters the so-called probability of lateral overlap (Py). This parameter {{depends on the}} navigation behavior of aircraft. For estimating the collision risk due to loss of vertical separation a method is proposed which estimates directly the probability of occurances of horizontal overlaps. This method has the following advantages: 1. The estimated <b>overlap</b> <b>frequencies</b> are nearly independent {{of the behavior of}} aircraft concerning navigation on air routes. 2. The proposed method is suited for a system which determines automatically the <b>overlap</b> <b>frequencies</b> similar to a short term conflict probe. Using the proposed method <b>overlap</b> <b>frequencies</b> for northern and southern Germany were determined. For doing this radar data were available for one week separately for both parts of Germany. A main result of the study is that 88 % of the observed passing events are crossing events. But one has to consider the definition for crossings which was utilized. A great part of crossings occured on air routes possibly {{due to the fact that}} aircraft were not advised to fly accurately on centerlines. Concerning the collision risk the results are given in table 3. Only with MASPS certified aircraft the collision risk is well below the TLS in a future 1000 ft vertical seperation environment. This is also true for high density areas like the airspace around Frankfurt. The results of the study permit no clear answer about the necessity of using offsets when flying on air routes.

40|$|International audienceIn {{wireless}} communication, interference {{between two}} radio systems may occur when they operate at <b>overlapping</b> <b>frequencies,</b> {{sharing the same}} environment at the same time. Such systems coexist if both of them perform correctly with respect to its specifications {{in the presence of}} the other. To ensure the coexistence, the Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) is used to specify rules within standardization bodies. According to current EMC standards, the radio spectrum has been divided into non-overlapping bands often with exclusive access. However, nowadays there is a proliferation of new digital systems sharing common frequency bands because the spectrum is a limited resource. Many of them are operating in unlicensed bands regulated by The International Telecommunications Union (ITU), for example the 2. 45 GHz Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) band. The frequency allocation is also changing with the emergence of digital systems and this is the case for white spaces in the broadcast television (TV) spectrum. To avoid high interference levels, it is necessary to consider some parameters related to signals variations in the time domain, representing more accurately the environment. Some techniques have been proposed in the literature to reduce interference levels but they are applied to specific sharing studies. Hence, we evaluate in this paper the impact of time-domain considerations for radio coexistence. We show that systems sharing the same spectrum can coexist when additional parameters relevant to the time domain are included in the analysis framework.

40|$|My PhD thesis {{consists}} of two neuroimaging studies {{in the field of}} cognitive neuroscience of music and sound as following described. (1) In the first research, entitled “Moving soundscape: an fMRI study on auditory self- and object-motion perception”, I investigated the auditory perception related to the discrimination between self- and object-motion, using an fMRI technique. Among scientific literature, no previous imaging studies researched about these two different types of motion perception in the auditory domain. I explored brain activation induced by complex auditory scenes including 64 ecological and binaurally spatialized sound sources moving either coherently or randomly, thus mimicking ecological stimulation during self and object motion respectively. The moving soundscape stimulus was designed in a similar way as the optical “flowfields” which are routinely used to map visual regions specialized for self motion such as V 6 + (Pitzalis et al., 2010) and consisting of white dots moving across different trajectories and directions, either coherently or randomly. HYPOTHESES: I investigated if this novel kind of auditory stimulation is able to elicit activation in the visual motion region V 6 + and whether it is able to engage supposed functional analogues areas in the auditory network. A further hypothesis concerns the cross-modal sensitivity of para- hippocampal place area (PPA), a specialized visual area for scene recognition (Epstein and Kanwisher, 1998; Sulpizio et al., 2013). METHOD: 16 participants underwent six distinct 3 T Allegra-fMR acquisition scans: 4 of moving soundscape and 2 of flowfield localizer. For the main experiment, the initial analysis aimed at selecting a set of brain regions more implicated in at least one experimental condition (coherent, random, static) as compared to the baseline (silence condition). The resulting estimates entered a repeated-measures analysis of variance (RM-ANOVA) comparing activations between the three conditions. The same analysis was also applied to the V 6 +, as individually defined {{on the basis of the}} flowfield localizer by comparing the flowfields and the random motion conditions. The PPA region was probabilistically defined in Sulpizio and colleagues (Sulpizio et al. 2013) by contrasting passive viewing localizer blocks of scenes vs. faces pictures in a group of 34 subjects separate from the participants of the current study; this region also entered a RM-ANOVA. RESULTS: The main experiment allowed me to observe the involvement of several areas inside and – surprisingly – outside auditory cortex such as: planum temporale (PT:Griffith et al., 2002) in the auditory pathway; hMT/V 5 + (Braddick et al., 2001), lateral occipital region (LOR: Tootell et al., 2001), V 3 A and V 3 B (Larsson et al., 2006), in the dorsal visual motion pathway. Moreover I observed activations in regions involved in visual object recognition such as lateral occipital cortex (LOC: Kanwisher et al., 2001) and fusiform gyrus (FUS: Weiner and Zilles, 2015). The auditory motion coding could seem to have its core area in the right PT able to distinguish between moving and static stimuli, but unable to discriminate between coherent and random motion. V 6 + and the other dorsal visual motion areas surprisingly appeared more responsive to static sound rather than to moving sound stimuli. PPA, LOC and FUS showed the same trend. I supposed that the ecological fitness of moving soundscape has triggered a healthy synesthetic process: visual mental imagery induced by auditory stimuli. Referring to the synesthesia models (Ramachandran & Hubbard, 2001; Esterman et al. 2006; Hubbard et al. 2007; Hubbard et al. 2011), I supposed an inhibition process to motion induced by strongly <b>overlapping</b> <b>frequencies</b> (also caused by psycho-acoustic indexes) that could explain the greater responsiveness to static rather than to moving stimuli of the dorsal visual pathway areas. Data about PPA, LOC and FUS revealed the cross-modal sensitivity of these regions for object and scene recognition. (2) The second study was entitled “Different brain processes between musicians and non-musicians during preparation, perception and action in visual and auditory decision-making”. I investigated brain and behavioral plasticity induced by musical training and transferred to decision-making processes, using an ERP technique. From a theoretical perspective, I referenced to an adaptation of Moreno’s transfer-effect model (2013). Musical training and skills transfer-effects have been conceptualized as a multidimensional continuum defined by two orthogonal dimensions: 1) the level of affected processing (low-level: sensory; high-level: cognitive) and 2) the transfer domain’s distance (near = auditory; far = visual). Among perceptual decision-making tasks, the Go/No-go task has been chosen to compare musicians and non- musicians, because it requires inhibitory control, an executive function that could represent the link to transfer-effects induced by musical training; moreover I administered the Go/No-go task in two different modalities (visual and auditory) in order to verify the near and far skill’s transfer. HYPOTHESES: I hypothesized that musicians could show differences from non-musicians in premotor, early and late ERPs components and in behavioral performances, proportionally to the transfer-effect distance and to the level of affected processes. Therefore I expected that musicians could show smaller premotor components (reflecting less effort) and higher amplitude both in sensory and cognitive components, above all in the auditory task, with a mirrored behavioral performance. METHOD: 31 participants underwent two separate auditory and visual Go/No-go tasks each made by 10 runs during a 64 -channel EEG recording. The visual stimuli consisted of four squared configurations made by vertical and horizontal bars; the two Go and No-go stimuli were created by coupling line orientations with configuration complexity. The auditory stimuli consisted in four complex tones created by coupling two notes (F-sharp and C) with two ranges of harmonic octaves. Behavioral data analysis entered RM-ANOVAs aiming to detect differences between groups, modalities and conditions about response time (RT), intra-individual coefficient of variation (ICV), false alarms (FA), anticipations and omissions. ERP data analysis entered RM-ANOVAs aiming to detect differences between group, conditions, modalities and electrode sites in an wide window of components: BP, pN, P 1, N 1, P 2, N 2, P 3. RESULTS: I found several differences between musicians and non- musicians. Musicians showed less effort in motor preparation (smaller BP component), faster and more accurate performances in the auditory- domain (decreased false alarm rate, increased N 1 amplitude, increased P 3 amplitude). However, musicians were less accurate than non- musicians in the visual task (increased false alarm rate and decreased P 3 amplitude). Interpreted by means of the Moreno’s pyramidal model (2013), these results appeared only partly in line with this conceptualization, showing that the brain plasticity induced by musical training could transfer to a far domain (such as visual domain), not only in terms of advantages, but also as disadvantages.

Musical training and skills transfer-effects have been conceptualized as a multidimensional continuum defined by two orthogonal dimensions: 1) the level of affected processing (low-level: sensory; high-level: cognitive) and 2) the transfer domain’s distance (near = auditory; far = visual). Among perceptual decision-making tasks, the Go/No-go task has been chosen to compare musicians and non- musicians, because it requires inhibitory control, an executive function that could represent the link to transfer-effects induced by musical training; moreover I administered the Go/No-go task in two different modalities (visual and auditory) in order to verify the near and far skill’s transfer. HYPOTHESES: I hypothesized that musicians could show differences from non-musicians in premotor, early and late ERPs components and in behavioral performances, proportionally to the transfer-effect distance and to the level of affected processes. Therefore I expected that musicians could show smaller premotor components (reflecting less effort) and higher amplitude both in sensory and cognitive components, above all in the auditory task, with a mirrored behavioral performance. METHOD: 31 participants underwent two separate auditory and visual Go/No-go tasks each made by 10 runs during a 64 -channel EEG recording. The visual stimuli consisted of four squared configurations made by vertical and horizontal bars; the two Go and No-go stimuli were created by coupling line orientations with configuration complexity. The auditory stimuli consisted in four complex tones created by coupling two notes (F-sharp and C) with two ranges of harmonic octaves. Behavioral data analysis entered RM-ANOVAs aiming to detect differences between groups, modalities and conditions about response time (RT), intra-individual coefficient of variation (ICV), false alarms (FA), anticipations and omissions. ERP data analysis entered RM-ANOVAs aiming to detect differences between group, conditions, modalities and electrode sites in an wide window of components: BP, pN, P 1, N 1, P 2, N 2, P 3. RESULTS: I found several differences between musicians and non- musicians. Musicians showed less effort in motor preparation (smaller BP component), faster and more accurate performances in the auditory- domain (decreased false alarm rate, increased N 1 amplitude, increased P 3 amplitude). However, musicians were less accurate than non- musicians in the visual task (increased false alarm rate and decreased P 3 amplitude). Interpreted by means of the Moreno’s pyramidal model (2013), these results appeared only partly in line with this conceptualization, showing that the brain plasticity induced by musical training could transfer to a far domain (such as visual domain), not only in terms of advantages, but also as disadvantages...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{systematic}} design method of <b>overlap</b> <b>frequency</b> domain equalization (FDE) for single carrier (SC) transmission without a guard interval (GI). Based on {{the analysis of}} signal-tointerference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the equalizer output for each symbol, we adaptively determine the block of the overlap FDE, where the block {{is defined as a}} set of symbols at the equalizer output with sufficiently low error rate, for a certain fixed sliding window size, which corresponds to a fast Fourier transform (FFT) window size. The proposed method takes advantage {{of the fact that the}} utility part of the equalized signal is localized around the center of the FFT window. In addition, we also propose to adjust the block size in order to control the computational complexity of the equalization per processed sample associating with the average bit error rate (BER) of the system. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can achieve comparable BER performance to the conventional SC-FDE scheme with sufficient GI insertion for both the coded and uncoded cases with various modulation levels, while requiring lower computational complexity compared to the SC overlap FDE transmission with the fixed block.
