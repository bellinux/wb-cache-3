5|$|As part of Sabah area, Kota Kinabalu {{features}} a typical equatorial climate with constant temperature, {{considerable amount of}} rain and high humidity. Two prevailing monsoons characterise the climate <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Sabah are the Northeast Monsoon and the Southwest Monsoon. The Northeast Monsoon occurs between November and March, while the Southwest Monsoon occurs between May and September. There are also two successive inter-monsoons from April to May and from September to October.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} 2015–2019 MTA Capital Program, the 42nd Street Shuttle {{will become}} ADA accessible, and the shuttle will be reconfigured from three tracks to two tracks, and the trains will become six cars long. The whole project will cost $235.41 million. The {{platforms}} at Times Square will be extended {{to allow for a}} second point of entry at Sixth Avenue, with a connection to the IND Sixth Avenue Line. The Times Square station will be rehabilitated with congestion mitigation measures. A wider stairway would be installed from the shuttle mezzanine to street level, a new control area would be installed {{at the bottom of the}} stairway, and 21 columns would be removed. The cost <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the project is $28.93 million. Also included in the Capital Program is funding for a study that would develop the requirements for a second program to automate the shuttle. The cost <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the project is $30 million. The project is delayed, and construction will start in May 2018.|$|E

5|$|Furthermore, the {{political}} climate {{in the aftermath of}} Elagabalus' reign, as well as Dio's own position within the government of Alexander likely influenced the truth <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> his history for the worse. Dio regularly refers to Elagabalus as Sardanapalus, partly to distinguish him from his divine namesake, but chiefly to do his part in maintaining the damnatio memoriae and to associate him with another autocrat notorious for a dissolute life.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally, {{agriculture}} was {{the mainstay}} of the economy <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Wales, but with the Industrial Revolution, the North Wales Coalfield was developed and parts of eastern Clwyd around the Dee estuary and Wrexham became industrialised. The advent of the railway running from Chester along the North Wales coast {{in the mid-nineteenth century}} made it easy for urban dwellers from Lancashire and Cheshire to visit the seaside towns of North Wales, and nowadays, tourism is the main source of income in Clwyd.|$|E

5|$|In 2011, {{the habitat}} quality of upper Fishing Creek {{and its tributaries}} were rated {{on a scale of}} 1 to 200 (with a higher rating {{indicating}} better habitability) by Point Park University and the Fishing Creek Sportsmans' Association. Most <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the creek and its tributaries were rated 166 or higher, which was considered optimal. The waters near the mouths of West Branch and East Branch Fishing Creeks, and Fishing Creek near Benton, were rated 113 to 160, considered suboptimal. A portion of West Creek was rated 60–112, considered marginal.|$|E
5|$|Like most <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Borneo, {{this area}} was once {{under the control of}} the Bruneian Empire in the 15th century before being ceded to the Sultanate of Sulu between the 17th and 18th centuries as a gift for helping the Bruneian forces during a civil war in Brunei. The name Tawao was used on {{nautical}} charts by 1857, and there is evidence of a settlement by 1879. The East India Company had established a trading post in Borneo, though there was no significant activity by the Dutch on the east coast. In 1846, Netherlands signed a treaty with the Sultan of Bulungan, where the latter assured the Dutch control of the area. When the Dutch began to operate in 1867, the Sultan married his son to the daughter of the Sultan of Tarakan. Around this time, the Dutch sphere of influence reached Tawao. They controlled the area north of Tawao, overlapping an area controlled by the Sultan of Sulu.|$|E
5|$|Like the extinctions {{of other}} New Zealand birds {{such as the}} piopio in the 19th century, {{the decline of the}} huia was poorly studied. Massive {{deforestation}} occurred in the North Island at this time, particularly in the lowlands of southern Hawkes Bay, the Manawatu and the Wairarapa, as land was cleared by European settlers for agriculture. The huia was particularly vulnerable to this as it could only live in old-growth forest where there were abundant rotting trees filled with wood-boring insect larvae. It seems it could not survive in regenerating, secondary forests. Although the mountainous part of its former range was not deforested, the lowland forests of the valleys below were systematically destroyed. The destruction <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> its habitat would have undoubtedly had a severe impact on huia populations, but its removal would have been particularly dire if they did in fact descend to the lowlands as a winter refuge to escape snow at higher altitudes as some researchers including Oliver have surmised.|$|E

5|$|Perched on an {{isolated}} rocky eminence, inaccessible on three sides, the fortress overlooks Split, the ancient Roman settlement of Salona, Solin, Kaštela and Trogir, {{and most of}} the central Dalmatian islands. Historically, the fortress has controlled access to and from Bosnia, Dalmatia and inland Croatia. The importance of such a position was felt by every army that invaded, or held possession <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Croatia. Klis Fortress was a point against which their attacks were always directed, and it has been remarkable for the many sieges it withstood.
