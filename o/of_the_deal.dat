Those favouring a broad interpretation of fair dealing argue {{there ought to be}} reasonable unauthorized reproduction of works because it facilitates creativity and free expression.

Their economic argument is that fair dealing should not compensate for the market's inability to meet the demand for public knowledge.|$|R
