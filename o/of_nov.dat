40|$|AbstractBackgroundNoroviruses (NoVs) are {{a common}} cause of acute {{gastroenteritis}} (AGE) and until now, {{little is known about}} its ability to spread outside the gut. ObjectivesWe aim to investigate the role <b>of</b> <b>NoVs</b> causing viremia in children hospitalized for AGE, as well as to correlate the presence <b>of</b> <b>NoVs</b> RNA in serum with clinical severity and stool viral load. Study designPaired stool and serum samples were collected from 85 pediatric patients under 6 years hospitalized for AGE from March to September 2012 in Belém, Brazil. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (EIA) and reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) were used to detect and quantify NoVs, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis of the partial ORF 2 region was used to genotype the strains detected. ResultsNoVs were detected in 34. 1 % (29 / 85) of stool samples. By qRT-PCR, we found a high rate of NoVs’ RNA in serum samples (34. 5 %) among NoVs-positive AGE cases, and was associated with a longer hospitalization (6. 5 vs. 4. 0 days; p= 0. 006), as well as with a higher stool viral load (3. 9 × 1011 vs. 1. 1 × 1011 GC/g; p= 0. 0472). NoVs strains were classified as GII. 4 (90 % of genotyped strains) and GII. 7 (10 %). The same genotype was found in paired stool and serum samples. ConclusionDetection and molecular characterization <b>of</b> <b>NoVs</b> GII in paired stool and serum samples suggest that the dissemination <b>of</b> <b>NoVs</b> to the blood stream is not uncommon, but the role of viruses spread outside the gut and the relationship with disease severity need to be further addressed...|$|R
40|$|Norovirus (NoV) causes {{epidemic}} acute gastroenteritis in humans, whereby histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) play {{an important}} role in host susceptibility. Each of the two major genogroups (GI and GII) <b>of</b> human <b>NoVs</b> recognizes a unique set of HBGAs through a distinct binding interface that is conserved within a genogroup, indicating a distinct evolutionary path for each genogroup. Here, we characterize a Lewis a (Lea) antigen binding strain (OIF virus) in the GII. 21 genotype that does not share the conserved GII binding interface, revealing a new evolution lineage with a distinct HBGA binding interface. Sequence alignment showed that the major residues contributing to the new HBGA binding interface are conserved among most members of the GII. 21, as well as a closely related GII. 13 genotype. In addition, we found that glycerol inhibits OIF binding to HBGAs, potentially allowing production of cheap antivirals against human NoVs. Taken together, our results reveal a new evolutionary lineage <b>of</b> <b>NoVs</b> selected by HBGAs, a finding that is important for understanding the diversity and widespread nature <b>of</b> <b>NoVs...</b>|$|R

40|$|Introduction and {{aim of the}} study. Recently, novel enteric caliciviruses {{closely related}} to human {{norovirus}} (<b>NoVs)</b> <b>of</b> genogroup IV have been detected from the stools of carnivores (a captive lion cub and a young pup), suggesting {{the existence of a}} new clade <b>of</b> <b>NoVs</b> in carnivores. In order to investigate the prevalence <b>of</b> antibodies against <b>NoVs</b> in cats, we expressed in the baculovirus system the capsid protein VPI <b>of</b> the lion <b>NoV</b> strain (Pistoia/ 387 / 06 /ITA) and we used the recombinant antigen for the development of an ELISA test. Material and methods. For the expression <b>of</b> the lion <b>NoV</b> VPI capsid protein, the full-length ORF 2 gene was cloned into the BamHI site of the pRN 16 vector. The construct was used to transfect insect cells along with the baculovirus linearized DNA. The recombinant VPI protein was used to develop an ELISA test that was used to screen 211 sera of cat for the presence <b>of</b> antibodies against <b>NoVs.</b> Results and discussion. The overall prevalence of GIV NoV-specific antibodies was 16, 11 % (34 / 211). The prevalence was higher (32 %) in free-ranging cats living in Rome Bioparco than in domestic cats.
