50|$|Oil under {{constant}} pressure is supplied to the lifter via an <b>oil</b> <b>channel,</b> {{through a small}} hole in the lifter body. When the engine valve is closed (lifter in a neutral position), the lifter is free to fill with oil. As the camshaft lobe enters the lift phase of its travel, it compresses the lifter piston, and a valve shuts the oil inlet. Oil is nearly incompressible, so this greater pressure renders the lifter effectively solid during the lift phase.|$|E
50|$|The {{purpose of}} {{submarine}} power cables is {{the transport of}} electric current at high voltage. The electric core is a concentric assembly of inner conductor, electric insulation and protective layers. The conductor is made from copper or aluminum wires, the latter material having a small but increasing market share. Conductor sizes ≤ 1200 are most common, but sizes ≥ 2400 mm2 have been made occasionally. For voltages ≥ 12 kV the conductors are round. Three different types of electric insulation around the conductor are mainly used today.Cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) is used up to 420 kV system voltage. It is produced by extrusion in insulation thickness of up to about 30 mm. 36 kV class cables have only 5.5 - 8 mm insulation thickness. Certain formulations of XLPE insulation {{can also be used}} for DC.Low-pressure oil-filled cables have an insulation lapped from paper strips. The entire cable core is impregnated with a low-viscosity insulation fluid (mineral oil or synthetic). A central <b>oil</b> <b>channel</b> in the conductor facilitates oil flow when the cable gets warm. Rarely used in submarine cables due to oil pollution risk at cable damage. Is used up to 525 kV.Mass-impregnated cables have also a paper-lapped insulation but the impregnation compound is highly viscous and does not exit when the cable is damaged. MI insulation can be used for massive HVDC cables up to 525 kV. Cables ≥ 52 kV are equipped with an extruded lead sheath to prevent water intrusion. No other materials have been accepted so far. The lead alloy is extruded onto the insulation in long lengths (over 50 km is possible). In this stage the product is called cable core. In single-core cables the core is surrounded by a concentric armoring. In three-core cables, three cable cores are laid-up in a spiral configuration before the armoring is applied.The armouring consists most often of steel wires, soaked in bitumen for corrosion protection. Since the alternating magnetic field in ac cables causes losses in the armoring those cables are sometimes equipped with non-magnetic metallic materials (stainless steel, copper, brass). Modern three-core cables, e.g. for the interconnection of offshore wind turbines) carry often optical fibers for data transmission or temperature measurement.|$|E

Compact Heat Exchangers (CHEs) {{play an important role}} in a wide range of applications, e. g. in windmill gear units, machine tools, mobile hydraulic systems and so on. For each field, specific requirements are needed (i. e. heat transfer rate, mass, size and pressure drop), which are achieved also through different types of configuration for the fin geometry in both the oil and the air channel. By means of CFD simulations of a small part of the CHE core, it is possible to know how a certain coupling of air and oil channels performs. However, when the number of configurations to be analysed is consistent, it is preferable to choose the smallest meaningful computational domain, in order to reduce computational resources while keeping all important physical phenomena. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that, despite oil flow can lead to convective heat transfer coefficient several times higher with respect to air flow, a change in the fin geometry affects significantly the “conjugate heat transfer” and the CHE performance. Besides, it is presented a simplified model for the heat exchanger element where the <b>oil</b> <b>channel</b> conductive and convective heat exchange are modelled by using a fixed temperature boundary condition and an effective thermal resistance. 3 -D simulations were carried out considering a fixed fin geometry for the air channel and five different fin geometries for the <b>oil</b> <b>channel.</b> Two cases of operative conditions were taken into account. Furthermore, for each coupling of channels, the simplified model was applied. Results demonstrate that a change in the fin geometry for the <b>oil</b> <b>channel</b> affects the overall heat transfer, and this influence is greater or smaller depending on the operative conditions. Secondly, the reduced model is shown to yield results with a reduction in accuracy that can not be neglected. dc 201...|$|E

It is demonstrated that the oil displacement in a 6  nm channel is over 30 times larger than that in a 2  nm channel, and the diffusion coefficient of oil molecules {{at the center of}} the 6  nm channel is almost two times more than that near the channel surface, due to interaction difference between the <b>oil</b> molecules and <b>channels.</b> Besides, we find that both the polarity of <b>oil</b> molecules and <b>channel</b> component have great effects on the interaction between <b>oil</b> molecules and <b>channel</b> in the channels with same width; the larger the interaction between <b>oil</b> molecules and <b>channel</b> is, the smaller the oil displacement is.

5000|$|Generally, {{hydraulic}} tappets {{are more}} sensitive to engine oil quality and frequency of oil changes, as carbon sludge and residues may easily lock up the tappets or block <b>oil</b> <b>channels,</b> making the clearance setting ineffective. This has negative impact especially on the engine camshaft and valves due to excessive wear if the clearance setting is not working correctly. As mentioned, one may avoid this by using the manufacturer-recommended grade of engine oil, and by not exceeding the prescribed oil change interval. It is a myth that in certain circumstances, a lifter can [...] "pump up" [...] and create negative valve clearance. The engine oil pump cannot generate enough pressure to cause [...] "pump-up". The problem is due to weak valve springs which permit float at high engine speeds. The followers attempt to take up {{what they see as}} extra clearance. As this speed is maintained, the lifter will continue to expand until the valve is held off its seat when it should be closed. Maintenance of the valve springs at the correct strength is therefore very important to avoid engine damage.|$|R

The model was built up by {{combining}} models from several studies in both engine lubrication systems and pipe flow modal analysis.

40|$|Graduation date: 2012 Experiments on a novel, {{microscale}} hydrogen combustor {{heat exchanger}} (µCHX) {{are presented in}} this thesis. The µCHX {{has been designed to}} efficiently transfer thermal energy to a heat transfer fluid for use in desorption of hydrogen from a metal hydride storage system of a hydrogen-powered fuel cell vehicle. The experimental study demonstrates proof of concept for the design and examines the effect of varying selected fluidic and geometric conditions on the overall efficiency of the µCHX. The small-scale device characterized in this thesis is a unit cell consisting of a combustion channel, a recuperator channel and an oil heat exchange channel.

40|$|The {{potential}} of flexible micro pillars for measuring near wall flow phenom- ena was theoretically and experimentally investigated. The bending of the micro pillars {{is a measure}} for the local wall shear stress (WSS) or a visualisa- tion of near wall flow phenomena. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) was chosen as material for the sensor. Within the thesis the experimental work with the shear stress sensor mainly has {{the focus on the}} transition to turbulence. Closely connected are improvements of the measurement techniques. The transition is thereby investigated qualitatively and quantitatively. Another huge part of the thesis was the improvement of the reliability of the manu- facturing process of the micro pillars. For this purpose new manufacturing methods for single pillars and pillar arrays have been tested. Further on, dif- ferent detection methods for capturing the bending of the pillar were tested, too. The measurements of the transitional flow were performed at flat plate boundary layer in an <b>oil</b> <b>channel.</b> Ondina 913 was used as test fluid. The physical properties of the PDMS changed dramatically while longer exposed to Ondina 913. Hence, it was unfeasible to receive reproducible quantita- tive results. Better results were achieved if the pillars are used as flexible micro tufts revealing the flow and WSS topology directly at the wall quali- tatively.

A potential application field for the riblet surfaces is blades and vanes for aeroengines. Those parts require coatings that act as oxidation and corrosion protection and could additionally reduce skin friction drag on the surface when riblets are applied. This reduction in friction of the air flow would lead to higher efficiencies of the engines. The presented work deals with the fabrication, oxidation and characterization of riblet structures with micrometer dimensions on state-of-the-art engine materials for aerodynamically optimized high temperature applications. The necessary riblet sizes for compressor inlet, compressor outlet, turbine inlet, and turbine outlet are calculated {{on the basis of}} one example aeroengine. Based on these calculations, the feasibility of various riblet structure fabrication methods is investigated.

40|$|Flow boiling in mini-channels {{has been}} the most recent trend in high {{performance}} cooling techniques, in spite of an increased pressure drop. An experimental study of pressure and heat transfer characteristics of water in mini-channel evaporators was carried out in this study. The test section consisted of 6, U-shape, parallel, mini-channels. The mini-channels were formed by brazing an etched, flat, stainless steel plate. The hydraulic diameter of a single mini-channel was 0. 725 mm. Distilled water, used as the fluid medium, flowed in the mini-channels; while the heating oil flowed on the outside of mini-channel. The inlet temperature of the water was maintained at room temperature and the outlet pressure was ambient pressure. The mass flux was in the range of 87. 36 kg/m~ s to 656. 75 kg/m 2 In order to enhance the heat transfer of the oil side, offset-strip fins were applied on the stainless steel surface of the oil side channel. Parafherm heat transfer oil, the fluid medium, was used on the oil side. The inlet temperature of the <b>oil</b> <b>channel</b> was varied through a range of 100 C to 275 C. The heat transfer and pressure drop results were obtained as a function of water flow rate and inlet oil temperature. The results indicate that the heat transfer coefficient on the water side was a function of the water mass flow rate, the outlet steam quality, and the oil inlet temperature. The pressure drop of the water side increased with decreasing oil inlet temperature and increasing water mass flow rate in the single-phase flow region. In the two-phase flow region, the pressure drop behavior was more complex since a higher water mass flow resulted in a lower average quality in the evaporator. The vapor generation phenomena associated with boiling and the resultant two-phase flow gives the pressure drop and heat transfer 2 - 10 fold. The study of two-phase heat transfer visualization gives more detail of the mechanism of two-phase flow and heat transfer. The capillary phenomena play a very important role in the small size channel. In this study, four predominant flow patterns, isolated bubbles, confined bubbles, slug flow and annular flow were observed. As nucleating bubbles were generated and being confined, slug flow easily formed at lower wall temperatures in the mini-channel and resulted in a higher heat transfer coefficient...|$|E
40|$|Among other things, {{the high}} speed of sharks {{is caused by}} reduced {{friction}} between water and skin due to riblet structures on the shark scales. When using a surface with riblet structures, the turbulent momentum transfer at the wall, {{which is responsible for}} the skin friction, is hampered. This works for all turbulent flowing fluidic media such as liquids and gases. The effect of drag reduction has already been used for airfoil wings that were laminated with polymer based riblets. A reduced flow resistance was obtained, resulting in less fuel consumption. A potential new application field for riblet surfaces are blades and vanes for aeroengines. Riblet structured coatings on the blades would act as oxidation and corrosion protection and additionally reduce the skin drag on the surface. The reduced friction of the air flow would lead to higher efficiencies of engines. This dissertation deals with the fabrication, oxidation and characterization of riblet structures with micrometer dimensions for aerodynamically optimized high temperature applications. First, the necessary riblet sizes were calculated for the different areas in the aeroengine. The size of the riblets depends on the surrounding conditions, namely the velocity, temperature and pressure of the flowing gas. The necessary riblet sizes for compressor inlet, compressor outlet, turbine inlet and turbine outlet were calculated on the basis of one example aeroengine. Calculations show that riblet sizes on blades and vanes for aeroengines vary between single-digit micrometers up to several tens of micrometers, depending on local temperature, pressure and gas velocity. For studying the general oxidation behavior of the riblet candidate materials, different coating materials such as titanium, nickel, chromium, aluminium, silicon and platinum were deposited on high temperature substrate materials such as nickel and titanium based alloys and were oxidized at various temperatures between 400 and 1000 °C, depending on a later application in compressor or turbine. Based on the calculations of the necessary riblet dimensions, the feasibility of various methods for the fabrication of riblet structures was investigated. As riblet fabrication methods direct structuring methods such as laser material removal and diamond cutting were investigated as well as structuring methods via a mask. As masks metal masks and resist masks were applied. Different coatings were deposited via thermal evaporation, sputter deposition and electrodeposition. For the direct structuring, best results were obtained via laser structuring. Photolithography and subsequent electrodeposition of nickel showed the best results for the structuring methods {{with the help of a}} mask. All tested riblet fabrication methods were evaluated concerning their applicability for structuring parts in aeroengines. The fabricated riblets were oxidized between 900 and 1100 °C for simulating the high application temperatures. The structures were still intact after oxidation.

40|$|ABB {{is moving}} towards more {{powerful}} and compact transformers and an efficient cooling {{is of paramount importance}} in order to avoid overheating. In this master thesis, transformers without guides for the oil flow have been analysed: they allow a faster and cheaper manufacturing process, {{but at the same time}} the absence of guides makes the cooling design more difficult. In order to be able to perform several parametric studies, a script with the Pointwise mesher has been developed for the automatic generation of the geometry and mesh of transformer windings. This has allowed to analyse transformer windings with a different shape, assessing the effect of a certain number of geometrical parameters on the cooling efficiency. The software ANSYS Fluent was used to perform 2 D axisymmetric unsteady simulations on the company cluster and the simulation set up was validated thanks to comparison with experimental measurements in ABB in Vaasa (Finland), that showed an average relative error below 2 %. A remarkable result of this study is the identification of a periodic pattern in the temperature of the windings from the inlet to the outlet of the transformer, with hot spot locations every 10 - 20 disc windings. This conclusion has also been confirmed by the experimental measurements performed in Vaasa on a test transformer. Furthermore, a periodic behaviour of the temperature of the windings and of the oil in time has also been identified. Finally, transformers with an additional cooling channel in the disc windings have been studied, revealing that an accurate design is needed when adding <b>oil</b> <b>channels</b> through the windings in order to avoid the formation of unexpected hot spots...|$|R

He is also remembered as [...] "the man who turned the desert green," [...] because he invested oil revenues into projects to improve the harsh desert environment.|$|R

The performance of such systems highly depends on the source-channel bit allocation strategy. Rate-based error protection schemes, which maximize the expected source rate are very attractive for real-time applications because the optimization call be done very quickly and is independent of the source. In real-world communication, charnel conditions are varying in time. Thus, {{it is important to}} frequently update the error protection. For two state-of-the-art joint source-channel coding systems, we show that a charnel mismatch call lead to a poor performance. We study theoretically and experimentally the dependency of a rate-based optimal protection <b>oil</b> the <b>channel</b> statistics and provide an efficient strategy for adjusting the error protection when a channel mismatch occurs...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. To {{study the}} {{distribution}} of remaining <b>oil</b> inside meandering <b>channel</b> sand body, the size of sand body architecture was calculated {{by the use of}} sedimentary facies, dense well, river parameters, cores, well logs and other data. The architecture of meandering channel that was crescent-shaped in plane and diagonal type in section was identifiable. On the base of study of architecture, the shielding of interlayer was classified into four types by the observation of oiliness interlayer. Framework of seepage flow was identified in meandering channel sand body. Several lateral accretion bodies between the completely choked interlayer constituted the flow unit. Combined with core analysis, the remaining <b>oil</b> in meandering <b>channel</b> sand body distributed in the upper and the middle of flow unit which did not connect with production well. The oil displacement efficiency in the flow unit was a positive rhythm in the flow unit. The oil displacement efficiency was a high-contrast positive rhythm in the lateral accretion body shielded by completely choked interlayer. That was a low-contrast positive rhythm in the lateral accretion body shielded by partly choked or restricted interlayer. All of these would provide guidance for developing the remaining oil...|$|R
40|$|The {{situation}} of uncertainty the olive growing and oil systems are having nowadays can be explained, roughly speaking, by structural internal variables, some others regarding the olive <b>oil</b> distribution <b>channels,</b> and, finally, by variables {{dealing with the}} consumer knowledge and sensorial perception of the quality olive oil types. The results show scientific evidences on the short level of knowledge and sensory ability the andalusian people have {{on the characteristics of}} the different olive oil types. These results are based upon a survey made to consumers (overall consumers, agricultural technicians, and children), dealing with the olive oil consumption and purchasing behaviours, and a tasting test to measure their sensory capability. The main conclusions aim toward a pressing need to work in training and educational programs to reduce this lap, and favour the marginal and traditional olive grove, which is unable to be restructured otherwise...|$|R
