5|$|After the English Reformation, the North saw several Catholic uprisings, {{including}} the Lincolnshire Rising, Bigod's Rebellion in Cumberland and Westmorland, and largest of all, the Yorkshire-based Pilgrimage of Grace, all against Henry VIII. His daughter Elizabeth I faced another Catholic rebellion, the Rising <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>North.</b> The region {{would become the}} centre of recusancy as prominent Catholic families in Cumbria, Lancashire and Yorkshire refused to convert to Protestantism. Royal power over the region was exercised through the Council <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>North</b> at King's Manor, York, {{which was founded in}} 1484 by Richard III. The Council existed intermittently for the next two centuries – its final incarnation was created {{in the aftermath of the}} Pilgrimage of Grace and was chiefly an institution for providing order and dispensing justice.|$|E
