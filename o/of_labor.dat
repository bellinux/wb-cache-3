5|$|After the 1943 Argentine coup d'état, Juan Perón, {{a member}} of the United Officers Group that {{engineered}} the plot, became Minister <b>of</b> <b>Labor.</b> Campaigning among workers with promises of land, higher wages, and social security, he won a decisive victory in the 1946 presidential elections. Under Perón, the number of unionized workers expanded as he helped to establish the powerful General Confederation <b>of</b> <b>Labor.</b> Perón turned Argentina into a corporatist country in which powerful organized interest groups negotiated for positions and resources. During these years, Argentina developed the largest middle class on the South American continent.|$|E

5|$|The strike {{heightened}} public fear <b>of</b> <b>labor</b> {{unrest and}} the possible radicalism that lay behind it. It contributed to the public anxiety of the period known as the Red Scare of 1919–1920. The failure of this and other strikes {{in the years following}} World War I contributed to declining union membership in subsequent years. The American Federation <b>of</b> <b>Labor</b> responded to political pressure experienced during the strike and revoked the charters it had granted to police unions. That ended police unionism in the U.S. for two decades, as police would not try to organize until World War II.|$|E

5|$|A committee, {{headed by}} Thorpe, was {{established}} to recruit employees and headquartered itself at Labor Hall. Throughout September and October, many employees began to join the union, but the Terminal and Traction Company responded by firing employees who joined and refused to recognize the union. After the failure of their initial attempt to have the union recognized by the company, the committee petitioned the United States Department <b>of</b> <b>Labor</b> to mediate discussions {{between them and the}} management of the business. On October 27, 1913, the department offered Ethelbert Stewart, head of the Bureau <b>of</b> <b>Labor</b> Statistics, to mediate. To begin negotiations, the workers' committee submitted a list of grievances to the company and Stewart. The company, however, refused his services, denied there was a labor problem and said no attempt at unionizing was being made. They insisted that only a small minority of workers were behind the troubles and alleged that it was outside influences behind the unionizing effort. In a later report, the Department <b>of</b> <b>Labor</b> claimed that had their offer of mediation been accepted, the subsequent strike and riot could have been averted.|$|E
