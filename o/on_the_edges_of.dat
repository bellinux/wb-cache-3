5|$|Adar is {{predominantly}} inhabited by the Dinka people, who mainly cultivate crops and raise cattle. Many of the Dinka use riverine pastures {{along the east}} bank of the White Nile, but in dry seasons can usually find alternative pasturage along the Khor Adal and Khor Wol and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> the marshes.|$|E
5|$|Geothermal {{electric}} {{plants were}} traditionally built exclusively <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> tectonic plates where high temperature geothermal resources are available near the surface. The development of binary cycle {{power plants and}} improvements in drilling and extraction technology enable enhanced geothermal systems over a much greater geographical range. Demonstration projects are operational in Landau-Pfalz, Germany, and Soultz-sous-Forêts, France, while an earlier effort in Basel, Switzerland was shut down after it triggered earthquakes. Other demonstration projects are under construction in Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America.|$|E

5|$|In The Political Demands of Isolated Indian Bands in British Columbia, Thomson {{points out}} the {{benefits}} in some level (albeit small) of separatist policies. He argues the benefits of allowing ethnic groups, like the Amish and the Hutterites in the United States and Canada or the Sami in Norway, to live <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> governance. These are ethnic groups that would prefer to retain their ethnic identity and thus prefer separatist policies for themselves, as they do not require them to conform to policies for all ethnicities of the nation.|$|E
5|$|Inocybe godeyi {{leaves a}} snuff-brown spore print, while the {{individual}} spores themselves are smooth and almond-shaped. The spores measure 9 to 11.5 by 5.5 to 7micrometres. Each basidium bares four spores. Both the cheilocystidia (cystidia found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> the gills) and the pleurocystidia (cystidia {{found on the}} faces of the gills) are spindle- or bottle-shaped, with some kind of encrustation at the tip. They have thick cell walls.|$|E
5|$|Jews also {{spread across}} Europe during the period. Communities were {{established}} in Germany and England in the 11th and 12th centuries, but Spanish Jews, long settled in Spain under the Muslims, came under Christian rule and increasing pressure to convert to Christianity. Most Jews were confined to the cities, as they {{were not allowed to}} own land or be peasants. Besides the Jews, there were other non-Christians <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> Europe—pagan Slavs in Eastern Europe and Muslims in Southern Europe.|$|E
50|$|Holman House is sited <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> a 70 m cliff <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> Dover Heights, {{providing}} a view across the ocean. The house cantilevers 6 m from this edge {{and at its}} furthest corner one is over the sea.|$|R
50|$|Spye Park lies <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> Bowden Hill to the {{southeast}} of the village. Although most of Spye Park is in Bromham parish, the gatelodge at its northwest entrance (originally a 16th-century building) stands <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> Bowden Hill village.|$|R
50|$|In September 2010, a {{documentary}} about the making of Springsteen's 1978 album Darkness <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Edge</b> <b>of</b> Town premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. The film, The Promise: The Making <b>of</b> Darkness <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Edge</b> <b>of</b> Town, was included in a box set reissue of the album, entitled The Promise: <b>The</b> Darkness <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Edge</b> <b>of</b> Town Story, released in November 2010. Also airing <b>on</b> HBO, <b>the</b> documentary explored Springsteen's making of the album and {{his role in the}} production and development of the tracks.|$|R
5|$|Like other fairywrens, the red-backed fairywren is {{predominantly}} insectivorous; they eat {{a wide variety}} of insects, including beetles such as weevils, leaf-, jewel-, flea- and ground-beetles, bugs, grasshoppers, moths, wasps and cicadas. Insect larvae and eggs are eaten as well as spiders. Seeds and other plant material make up only a very small proportion of its diet. It can be found hunting for insects in leaf litter, shrubbery and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> bodies of water, mostly in the morning and late afternoon. Adults of both sexes as well as helper birds feed the young.|$|E
5|$|Russell Sage built {{a row of}} Gothic Revival {{houses on}} Second Street in 1846 that survives, albeit without some of their {{original}} ornamentation. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> town, some architects began exploring that style's Picturesque mode. A new row of townhouses at Washington Park went up, and another Second Street row followed in 1855. The following year, St. John's Episcopal Church, at First and Liberty Streets, was the first use of that style for a city church.|$|E
5|$|Terraces {{of shops}} were {{built around the}} fringes of the estate, both to cater for the {{residents}} of Noel Park and for residents of the expanding suburb of Wood Green and the users of the adjacent railway station. The designs of the terraces varied, from short terraces of small shops <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> the less-visited eastern portions of the estate, to parades of large shops on Wood Green High Road near the railway station.|$|E
50|$|Consistent hashing {{is based}} on mapping each object to a point <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> a circle (or equivalently, mapping each object to a real angle).The system maps each {{available}} machine (or other storage bucket) to many pseudo-randomly distributed points <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same circle.|$|R
50|$|The {{ruins of}} the ancient city are {{situated}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> modern city. The Sidhnai Canal and a point <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ravi river are also used for recreation. Other sites of interest are Darbar Mamon Sheer Bukhari and Darbar Rehmat Ali Shah.|$|R

5|$|For any graph G = (V,E), we may {{define a}} matroid <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> G, {{in which a}} set of edges is {{independent}} {{if and only if}} it forms a pseudoforest; this matroid is known as the bicircular matroid (or bicycle matroid) of G. The smallest dependent sets for this matroid are the minimal connected subgraphs of G that have more than one cycle, and these subgraphs are sometimes called bicycles. There are three possible types of bicycle: a theta graph has two vertices that are connected by three internally disjoint paths, a figure 8 graph consists of two cycles sharing a single vertex, and a handcuff graph is formed by two disjoint cycles connected by a path.|$|E
5|$|In eastern Europe, Romania built {{what were}} termed heroes' war grave cemeteries, either in {{existing}} heroes' cemeteries, on {{the sites of}} the World War I battles, or in new cemeteries symbolically placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> towns. The situation was somewhat different in Russia, however, where the Moscow City Fraternal Cemetery was used {{not just for the}} war dead of World War I, but also for the casualties of the Civil War, and then the victims of the secret police. It was finally closed by the Bolsheviks in 1925 and turned into a park; subsequently, possibly on the orders of Joseph Stalin, the Eastern Orthodox church and the headstones were systematically destroyed until almost no trace of the cemetery remained.|$|E
5|$|Parts of Juniata County {{are fairly}} flat, {{but there are}} areas in the county with slopes of 25% or greater. However, most {{development}} in the county is confined to areas with slopes of 15% or less. Many of the county's steepest slopes, with grades of 25% of more, are located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> the county. These slopes are generally found on mountainous ridges. However, there are some similarly steep slopes {{in the middle of}} the county. All four boroughs in the county have slopes with a grade of 25% or more near them. Slopes of 15% to 25% can be found throughout the county.|$|E

50|$|Bloxham is {{a village}} and civil parish in {{northern}} Oxfordshire <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cotswolds, about 3 mi southwest of Banbury. It is <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> a valley and overlooked by Hobb Hill. <b>The</b> village is <b>on</b> <b>the</b> A361 road. The 2011 Census recorded the parish's population as 3,374.|$|R
5|$|Relatively new {{cells in}} a groove <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> the mantle secrete {{material}} that extends the periostracum. These cells are gradually displaced to {{the underside of}} the mantle by more recent cells in the groove, and switch to secreting the mineralized material of the shell valves. In other words, {{on the edge of the}} valve the periostracum is extended first, and then reinforced by extension of the mineralized layers under the periostracum. In most species the edge of the mantle also bears movable bristles, often called chaetae or setae, that may help defend the animals and may act as sensors. In some brachiopods groups of chaetae help to channel the flow of water into and out of the mantle cavity.|$|E
5|$|Russula emetica {{produces}} a white to yellowish-white spore print. Spores are roughly elliptical to egg-shaped, with a strongly warted and partially reticulate (web-like) surface. They have dimensions of 8.8–11.0 by 6.6–8μm, and are amyloid, {{meaning that they}} will stain blue, bluish-grey, to blackish in Melzer's reagent. Basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, hyaline (translucent), and measure 32.9–50 by 9.0–11.6μm. Cystidia located on the gill face (pleurocystidia) are somewhat cylindrical to club-shaped or somewhat spindle-shaped, and measure 35–88 by 7.3–12.4μm. They are yellowish, and contain granular contents. Cheilocystidia (found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> the gills), which are similar in shape to the pleurocystidia, are thin-walled, hyaline, and measure 14–24 by 4.4–7.3μm. Clamp connections are absent from the hyphae.|$|E
5|$|The spore dust is olive to {{brownish}} olive. The spores are oval to somewhat -shaped, measuring 11–15μm long by 4.5–6.5μm wide. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped and four-spored, {{and measure}} 29.2–36.5 by 11.0–12.4μm. Cystidia {{on the sides}} of the tubes (pleurocystidia) are fuse-shaped with swollen middles and long necks, measuring 33–48 by 7.3–13.5μm; cheilocystidia (<b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> the pores) have a similar morphology. The cap cuticle is made of cylindrical hyphae 3.7–5.8μm wide that are interwoven compactly, and the hyphal tips are erect and arranged in bundles. In contrast, the hyphae of the cap flesh is loosely interwoven with hyphae that are cylindrical and branched, measuring 3.7–8.8μm. Hyphae do not contain clamp connections. The mycelium is an unusual yellow colour.|$|E
50|$|The {{territory}} of Lac-aux-Sables is mostly {{included in the}} Batiscanie, except the area of Missionary Lake at <b>the</b> western boundary, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> Sainte-Thèecle which flows in the sub-basin of the Mekinac River, unless another area <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> Saint-Ubalde, Quebec (East) which flows into the Charest river.|$|R

5|$|The {{spore print}} is purplish brown. Under the microscope, the spores appear dull purple-brown. They are {{ellipsoid}} to somewhat egg-shaped, and, according to Singer's original description, measure 8–10 by 4–5μm. A later study of specimens collected from British Columbia, Canada, instead reported a larger spore size range of 10–13 by 6–7μm. The spores have an apical germ pore. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored, hyaline (translucent), and measure 22–35 by 7–10μm. There are abundant cystidia that form a sterile band <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> the gills (cheilocystidia); these cystidia are smooth, inflated, and fusoid-ventricose (enlarged {{in the middle}} and tapered toward both ends) with an sharp tip, and measure 25–30 by 6–9μm. The cap cuticle (an ixocutis) is made of a layer of roughly horizontal, gelatinized, wavy, hyaline hyphae that are 0.8–5.5μm in diameter.|$|E
5|$|The spores are smooth, spindle-shaped, {{and measure}} 13.5–19.8 by 5.0–7.2µm—rather large for {{a member of}} the Boletaceae. Grayish-yellow or greenish yellow when mounted in a dilute {{potassium}} hydroxide, they are dextrinoid (yellowish- or reddish-brown) when stained with Melzer's reagent. The basidia (spore-bearing cells in the hymenium) are club-shaped, hyaline (translucent), four-spored, and measure 28.8–42.3 by 7.2–11.7µm. The hymenium contains basidioles (immature or aborted basidia), which are club-shaped and measure 20.7–35.1 by 7.2–9.0µm. Pleurocystidia (cystidia {{on the surface of the}} tubes) range in shape from somewhat spindle-shaped to cylindrical, and are hyaline, smooth, and thin-walled, with dimensions of 41.4–61.2 by 7.2–10.8µm. Cystidia <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> the pores (cheilocystidia) are 31.5–49.5 by 7.2–13.5µm, spindle-shaped to centrally swollen, hyaline, smooth, and thin-walled. Clamp connections are absent from the hyphae.|$|E
5|$|Urban red foxes {{are most}} active at dusk and dawn, {{doing most of}} their hunting and {{scavenging}} at these times. It is uncommon to spot them during the day, {{but they can be}} caught sunbathing on roofs of houses or sheds. Foxes will often make their homes in hidden and undisturbed spots in urban areas as well as <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> a city, visiting at night for sustenance. While foxes will scavenge successfully in the city (and the foxes tend to eat anything that the humans eat) some urban residents will deliberately leave food out for the animals, finding them endearing. Doing this regularly can attract foxes to one's home; they can become accustomed to human presence, warming up to their providers by allowing themselves to be approached and in some cases even played with, particularly young cubs.|$|E
