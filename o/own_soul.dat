5|$|Some ignorant clerics reject {{calculations}} {{of this kind}} (for shame!) and {{do not wish to}} keep their phylacteries, that is, they do not preserve the order, which they have received in the bosom of mother church, nor do they persist in the holy teaching of meditation. They should consider carefully the way of the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and they should spit out their doctrine like filth. A cleric ought to be the keeper of his <b>own</b> <b>soul,</b> just as a noble man subjects a young foal to the yoke, so he ought to subject his <b>own</b> <b>soul</b> to service, by filling the alabaster box with precious oil, that is, he ought to be inwardly subjected daily, by obeying the divine laws and admonitions of the Redeemer.|$|E
5|$|Depending {{upon his}} choice, the player {{character}} must assault or defend three key positions around the City of Judgment. After the battle, the player learns where his <b>own</b> <b>soul</b> is located and wrests {{it from the}} Wall of the Faithless. The player is then pulled into a dreamscape where he must battle Akachi's avatar, The Faceless Man, for control of his soul. After defeating the Faceless Man, Kelemvor narrates the ending, which varies based on the player's choices throughout the game.|$|E

The woman has not the courage {{to give up her}} hopeless insistence on love and her endless demand for love, demand of being loved.

Eventually, Warlock discovers that the Magus is a future version of himself who traveled back in time after being driven insane {{by the use of}} his Soul Gem. Warlock chooses to alter his timeline by visiting himself a few months into the future and steals his <b>own</b> <b>soul</b> to prevent the Magus from ever existing. Warlock then continues his journeys, knowing he has seen his own death but not knowing exactly when it will happen.|$|E

25|$|Although largely {{absent from}} his diocese between 1436 and 1445, his {{presence}} is on record for January 1439, February 1441, and February 1445. From 1445 onwards he appears settled in his diocese, {{and the evidence}} once again indicates Crannach's concern with securing the rights and privileges of his office and see. One of his earliest acts in this period was the purchase of land at Keithock (Angus). He endowed a chaplaincy on 11 June 1451 {{for the benefit of}} his <b>own</b> <b>soul,</b> and for the soul of his former lord Walter Stewart, despite the damnatio memoriae of the latter for regicide. The dispute with the archdeacon Gilbert Forrester continued, Forrester's excommunication being renewed on 30 July 1448. Forrester tried to secure exemption from episcopal authority at the Roman court. Although Crannach resisted Forrester, the bishop-archdeacon dispute was to continue after Crannach's death. Crannach also attacked his dean, John de Lichton (Leighton) for inefficiency and immorality.|$|E
25|$|Snape's {{memories}} then {{reveal that}} Dumbledore had impetuously {{tried to use}} the Gaunt ring which had been cursed by Voldemort, and had been suffering from a powerful curse. Snape's knowledge of the Dark Arts enabled him to slow {{the spread of the}} curse from Dumbledore's hand through his body, but he would have died within a year. Dumbledore, aware that Voldemort had ordered Draco to kill him, had asked Snape to kill him instead as a way of sparing the boy's soul and of preventing his own otherwise slow, painful death. Although Snape was reluctant, even asking about the impact of such an action on his <b>own</b> <b>soul,</b> Dumbledore implied that this kind of coup de grâce would not damage a human's soul in the same way murder would. Snape agreed to do as the Headmaster requested. Snape's memories also provide Harry with the information he needs to ensure Voldemort's final defeat, in the form of conversations Snape had with Dumbledore.|$|E
25|$|In Soul Reaver 2, {{while in}} pursuit of Kain, Raziel explores the past, {{learning}} more of his own history as {{a former member of}} the Sarafan, and discovering Kain's ultimate goal—to restore balance to Nosgoth. Kain had Raziel executed in Soul Reaver in order to create a temporal paradox. By exploiting Raziel's unique free will, Kain can defy the course of history and alter time. In hopes of learning more about his destiny, Raziel time travels back to the era of the Sarafan, where the ancient vampire Janos Audron gifts him the Reaver—a younger version of the Soul Reaver blade, before it housed a ravenous spirit. However, they are ambushed by the Sarafan leaders, including Raziel's former self, who slays Janos. Raziel renounces his heritage by using the Reaver to kill his former comrades and his younger self, thus providing the corpses for Kain to turn into vampires in the future. The Reaver then turns against Raziel, and he realizes that the entity destined to become trapped within the blade has always been him; the sword shattered against him in Soul Reaver because it could not consume its <b>own</b> <b>soul.</b> Kain saves Raziel from being absorbed by the Reaver, but this causes a temporal paradox which changes Nosgoth's history for the worse, and only postpones Raziel's fate.|$|E

25|$|Later, {{he finds}} out that Harry and his friends are hunting and {{destroying}} his Horcruxes. After offering the occupants of Hogwarts mercy if they give up Harry, he assembles a large army and launches an invasion of the castle, where Harry is searching for Ravenclaw's Lost Diadem, one of the Horcruxes. Voldemort orders his pet snake Nagini to execute Snape, believing it would make him the true master of the Elder Wand, since Snape killed Dumbledore. He then calls an hour's armistice, in exchange for Harry. When Harry willingly walks into Voldemort's camp in the Forbidden Forest, Voldemort strikes him down with the Elder Wand. However, the use of Harry's blood to resurrect Voldemort's body proves {{to be a major}} setback: while Harry's blood runs in Voldemort's veins, Harry cannot be killed as his mother's protection lives on now in Voldemort too. Instead, Voldemort destroys the part of his <b>own</b> <b>soul</b> that resides in Harry’s body. Voldemort forces Rubeus Hagrid to carry Harry's apparently lifeless body back to the castle as a trophy, sparking another battle during which Nagini, his last Horcrux, is destroyed by Neville Longbottom. The battle then moves into the Great Hall, where Voldemort fights Minerva McGonagall, Kingsley Shacklebolt, and Horace Slughorn simultaneously. Harry then reveals himself and explains to Voldemort that Draco became the true master of the Elder Wand when he disarmed Dumbledore; Harry, in turn, won the wand's allegiance when he took Draco's wand. Refusing to believe this, Voldemort casts the Killing Curse with the Elder Wand while Harry uses a Disarming Charm with Draco's, but the Elder Wand refuses to kill its master and the spell rebounds on Voldemort who, with all of his Horcruxes destroyed, finally dies. His body is laid in a different chamber from all the others who died battling him.|$|E
500|$|The seventh {{book of the}} Devi-Bhagavata Purana {{presents}} the theology of Shaktism. This book is called Devi Gita, or the [...] "Song of the Goddess". The Goddess explains she is the Brahman that created the world, asserting the Advaita premise that spiritual liberation occurs when one fully comprehends the identity of one's soul and the Brahman. This knowledge, asserts the Goddess, comes from detaching self from the world and meditating on one's <b>own</b> <b>soul.</b>|$|E

500|$|The Upanishad {{states that}} {{knowledge}} of Brahman results in knowing spiritual {{truth in the}} Paroksha (indirect cognition) way, but Sakshatkara (direct realization) results in knowing that his <b>own</b> <b>soul</b> is Brahman.
