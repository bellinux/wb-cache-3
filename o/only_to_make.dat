5|$|After a short honeymoon, Beatrice and {{her husband}} {{fulfilled}} their promise {{and returned to the}} Queen's side. The Queen made it clear that she could not cope on her own and that the couple could not travel without her. Although the Queen relaxed this restriction shortly after the marriage, Beatrice and Henry travelled <b>only</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> short visits with his family. Beatrice's love for Henry, like that of the Queen's for the Prince Consort, seemed to increase the longer they were married. When Henry travelled without Beatrice, she appeared happier when he returned.|$|E
5|$|Having overwintered in Isles, Magnús {{left for}} Norway in the summer, <b>only</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> his return {{nearly four years}} later, in 1102 or 1103. Once re-established on Mann, Magnús entered into an {{alliance}} with Ua Briain, formalised through the marriage between Magnús's young son, Sigurðr (died 1130), and Ua Briain's daughter, Bjaðmunjo (fl. 1102/1103). Magnús, therefore, appears to have intended for Sigurðr to rule over his recently-won territories. Unfortunately for Ua Briain, and his long-term ambitions in Ireland and the Isles, Magnús was slain in Ulster in 1103, whereupon Sigurðr immediately repudiated his bride and returned to Norway. Although Ua Briain was able {{to regain control of}} Dublin, and still held considerable influence in the Isles, Magnús' death appears to have left a power vacuum in the region that he was unable to fill.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{launched}} 21 June 1915 at the Denny shipyard in Dumbarton, Scotland. The launch had been delayed nine months, after the British Government ordered that all construction workers be pulled from non-military vessels {{after the start}} of the First World War, and work had been resumed <b>only</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> her slipway available for warships. She remained at anchor for the next year and a half. The Royal Navy purchased her on 27 February 1917 for completion as a combined landplane and seaplane carrier. The price of £138,118 included the cost of conversion to her new role. The ship was nearly complete when requisitioned, although her propelling machinery was not yet installed. Consequently, only limited internal modifications, notably the addition of three large workshops, could be made.|$|E

5|$|Almost {{the entire}} {{original}} cast from season two returned {{for the third}} season, including Amy Poehler, Rashida Jones, Aziz Ansari, Nick Offerman, Aubrey Plaza and Chris Pratt. The only permanent cast member not to return was Paul Schneider, who previously played city planner Mark Brendanawicz. Schneider departed from the series {{at the end of}} season two. Jim O'Heir and Retta, who made regular appearances as parks employees Jerry Gergich and Donna Meagle during the first two seasons, were considered members of the regular cast starting in season three, although they still do not appear in the opening credits. Adam Scott, who portrayed state auditor Ben Wyatt in the final two episodes of the second season, became a regular cast member starting in season three, and Rob Lowe, who appeared in the same two second-season episodes as state auditor Chris Traeger, also joined the cast in season three. Lowe was originally meant <b>only</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a string of performances in seasons two and three and then depart the show, but he instead become a regular cast member starting with the third season, having signed a multi-year contract to remain on the show. After actor Charlie Sheen was fired from the CBS comedy series Two and a Half Men in March 2011, rumors circulated that Rob Lowe would depart Parks and Recreation and replace Sheen, but they proved unfounded.|$|E
5|$|Within the year, Magnús himself {{arrived in}} the Isles, {{captured}} Lagmann, and conquered the kingdom. After overwintering in region, the Norwegian king left for Scandinavia in the summer, <b>only</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> his return nearly four years later, in 1102 or 1103. Once re-established on Mann, Magnús may well have seized control of Dublin before entering into an alliance with Muirchertach, formalised through the marriage between Magnús's young son, Sigurðr (died 1130), and Muirchertach's daughter, Bjaðmunjo (fl. 1102/1103). The arrangement seems to reveal that Magnús intended for Sigurðr to rule over his recently-won territories. Although it may have also meant that Norwegian sovereignty in the Isles was recognised by the Irish, {{it is also possible}} that Muirchertach intended to exert his own influence into the region through his new son-in-law. Unfortunately for Muirchertach, and his long-term ambitions in Ireland and the Isles, Magnús was slain in Ulster in 1103, whereupon Sigurðr immediately repudiated his bride and returned to Norway. Although Muirchertach was able to regain control of Dublin, and still held considerable influence in the Isles, Magnús' death appears to have left a power vacuum in the region that he was unable to fill.|$|E

25|$|After {{ten years}} of interregnum, {{the need for a}} strong {{centralized}} monarchy was clear even to the most independent of the dukes; Franks and Byzantines pressed and the Lombards could no longer afford a too fluid power structure, useful <b>only</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> forays in search of plunder. In 584 the dukes agreed to crown King Cleph's son, Autari, and delivered to the new monarch half of their property (and then probably getting even with a new crackdown against the surviving Roman property land).|$|E
25|$|In July 2016, Edward Snowden criticised Wikileaks for insufficiently curating its content. When Snowden made data public, {{he did so}} {{by working}} with the Washington Post, the Guardian and other news organisations, {{choosing}} <b>only</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> documents public which exposed National Security Agency surveillance programs. Content that compromised national security or exposed sensitive personal information was withheld. Wikileaks, on the other hand, makes little effort to remove sensitive personal information or withhold content with adverse national security implications. Wikileaks responded by accusing Snowden of pandering to Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.|$|E

Cassell was later traded to Dallas for all-star guard Jason Kidd. With a mostly small lineup, the Suns put {{together}} an 11-game win streak that put them in the playoffs, in a series that almost upset the highly favored Sonics. Despite the loss in the playoffs, the Suns became one of the few NBA teams, if not the <b>only,</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the playoffs after starting the season 0-10 or worse, {{and one of the few}} to make the playoffs after experiencing a 10+-game losing streak during the regular season (last until the 2002 Toronto Raptors).|$|E
25|$|Two {{competing}} {{proposals for}} an international body emerged during the Commission's meetings. The British proposed establishing an international parliament to enact labour laws which {{each member of the}} League would be required to implement. Each nation would have two delegates to the parliament, one each from labour and management. An international labour office would collect statistics on labour issues and enforce the new international laws. Philosophically opposed to the concept of an international parliament and convinced that international standards would lower the few protections achieved in the United States, Gompers proposed that the international labour body be authorized <b>only</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> recommendations, and that enforcement be left up to the League of Nations. Despite vigorous opposition from the British, the American proposal was adopted.|$|E
25|$|Shapland {{had murdered}} Springer, who had caught {{her while she}} was searching the Sports Pavilion for the jewels. She also murdered Mademoiselle Blanche, the would-be blackmailer. But she did not kill Miss Vansittart, and has a perfect alibi for that night. Vansittart was killed by Chadwick, in an unpremeditated fit of passion. Chadwick had found Vansittart, whom she disliked, in the Sports Pavilion the second night, {{kneeling}} in front of Shaista's locker. Chadwick was carrying a sandbag for protection, and there was Vansittart in a perfect position to be coshed. Chadwick apparently suffered a psychotic break and bludgeoned Vansittart. The same murderer committed {{the first and third}} murders, while the second and third murders were by the same method (a sandbag); Shapland had used the sandbag <b>only</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it seem that the second and third murders were linked.|$|E

25|$|The duty of {{good faith}} {{requires}} control persons to exercise care and prudence in making business decisions—that is, the care that a {{reasonably prudent person}} in a similar position would use under similar circumstances. Control persons fail to act in good faith, even if their actions are not illegal, when they take actions for improper purposes or, in certain circumstances, when their actions have grossly inequitable results. The duty to act in good faith is an obligation not <b>only</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> decisions free from self-interest, but also free of any interest that diverts the control persons from acting {{in the best interest}} of the company. The duty to act in good faith may be measured by an individual's particular knowledge and expertise. The higher the level of expertise, the more accountable that person will be (e.g., a finance expert may be held to a more exacting standard than others in accepting a third party valuation).|$|E
25|$|Although many {{companies}} offer courses in stock picking, and numerous experts report success through technical analysis and fundamental analysis, many economists and academics state {{that because of}} the efficient-market hypothesis (EMH) it is unlikely that any amount of analysis can help an investor make any gains above the stock market itself. In the distribution of investors, many academics believe that the richest are simply outliers in such a distribution (i.e. in a game of chance, they have flipped heads twenty times in a row). When money is put into the stock market, it is done with the aim of generating a return on the capital invested. Many investors try not <b>only</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a profitable return, but also to outperform, or beat, the market. However, market efficiency - championed in the EMH formulated by Eugene Fama in 1970, suggests that at any given time, prices fully reflect all available information on a particular stock and/or market.|$|E
