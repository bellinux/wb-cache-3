500|$|Emmerich and Devlin {{decided to}} expand on the idea by {{incorporating}} a large-scale attack, with Devlin saying he was bothered {{by the fact that}} [...] "for the most part, in alien invasion movies, they come down to Earth and they're hidden in some back field ...r they arrive in little spores and inject themselves into the back of someone's head." [...] Emmerich agreed by asking Devlin if arriving from across the galaxy, [...] "would you hide on a farm <b>or</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> make a big entrance?" [...] The two wrote the script during a month-long vacation in Mexico, and just one day after they sent it out for consideration, 20th Century Fox chairman Peter Chernin greenlit the screenplay. Pre-production began just three days later in February 1995. The U.S. military originally intended to provide personnel, vehicles, and costumes for the film; however, they backed out when the producers refused to remove the script's Area 51 references.|$|E

The study stated that most positive references to religion were on reality shows such as , while claiming that scripted shows {{tended to be more}} negative towards it. The report also ranked Fox as the [...] "most anti-religious network", followed by NBC, UPN, ABC, CBS, and the WB. In 2008, PTC published a report titled Happily Never After, using analysis of several primetime shows early in the 2007-2008 television season to assert that extramarital sex is favored on television shows. Ian O'Doherty of The Irish Independent asked regarding the PTC's marriage depiction study: [...] "After all, would you rather watch people having fun <b>or</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> rather watch a realistic depiction of marriage, which...would simply be an hour of two people sullenly chewing their food, pausing occasionally only to throw each other filthies and occasionally grumbling under their breath how the biggest regret of their life was ever setting eyes on you and that their mother was right all along?" [...] PTC released a report in October 2009 stating that prime-time television shows on broadcast networks had twice as many depictions of violence against women in 2009 than in 2004.|$|E
