5|$|Beginning in 1967, Como began {{reducing}} his TV appearances, gradually becoming {{limited to}} seasonal and holiday specials {{with the emphasis}} being on Christmas. Como had numerous Christmas television specials, beginning on Christmas Eve 1948, and continuing to 1994, when his final Christmas special was recorded in Ireland. They were recorded in many countries, including the Holy Land, Mexico, and Canada, {{as well as many}} locations throughout the United States. The 1987 Christmas special was cancelled at the behest <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>angry</b> Como; The American Broadcasting Company (ABC) was willing to offer him only a Saturday 10 PM time slot for it three weeks before the holiday. Perry filled the yearly gap for his fans with live Christmas concerts in various locations.|$|E
5|$|Plante was the Canadiens' {{number one}} goaltender at the {{beginning}} of the 1954–55 NHL season. On March 13, 1955, with only four games left in the season, an on-ice brawl resulted in the suspension of Montreal's leading scorer, Maurice Richard, for the rest of the season and the playoffs. Four nights later, playing in Montreal in front <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>angry</b> crowd, Plante was witness to the riot that followed. It began at the Forum by angry hockey game spectators and spread along Montreal's Ste. Catherine Street, causing injuries to police and fans and extensive damage to businesses and property. The Canadiens subsequently lost to the Detroit Red Wings in the finals.|$|E

500|$|Grrrrrrrrrrr!! is a 1965 oil and Magna {{on canvas}} {{painting}} by Roy Lichtenstein. Measuring , it was bequeathed to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum collection from Lichtenstein's estate. It depicts a head-on representation <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>angry</b> dog growling with the onomatopoeic [...] expression [...] "Grrrrrrrrrrr!!". The work {{was derived from}} Our Fighting Forces, which also served as the source for other military dog paintwork by Lichtenstein.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Peter {{watches a}} chick flick with Lois, and is deeply moved by it. After renting several other chick flicks, Peter decides {{to make one}} of his own with his friends, {{entitled}} Steel Vaginas. The plot stars Peter as a man who claims he does not care much for women until he meets [...] "Vageena Hertz", played by Lois, who is also his own daughter in the film. After Vageena almost drowns when she goes swimming too soon after eating, she is rushed to the hospital, but dies <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>angry</b> hymen. The film ends and is received badly by Peter's friends due to its poor plot outline, structure and not making any sense.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} months of 1950 Chance of a Lifetime was {{released}} into British cinemas; it was a film in which Jacques [...] "really made her mark", according to her biographer, Andy Merriman. Chance of a Lifetime is a social and industrial relations drama based in a plough factory whose manager cedes control to the workforce. Jacques played Alice, a welder: when she was offered her fee for 17 days filming, she replied [...] "I've done this job welding Bailey and Pontoon Bridges and I know how hard it is. That's not enough money!" [...] and the offer was raised accordingly. The film critic Geoff Mayer considered that Jacques had [...] "the best scene in the film with her mock seductive dance in front <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>angry</b> [...] MacGinnis".|$|E

500|$|When Lois {{is given}} her {{contract}} {{after getting a}} job at Fox News, she happily runs home in a way reminiscent of Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory when that film's protagonist, Charlie Bucket, runs home after receiving his golden ticket. She then falls and starts moaning, much like Peter did after he won {{a tour of the}} Pawtucket brewery in [...] "Wasted Talent", but instead of grabbing her kneecap as Peter did, she grabs her right breast. Later on at the studio, Stewie's broadcast on Fox News is a parody of a viral video clip <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>angry</b> Bill O'Reilly during a teleprompter malfunction. When Fred Savage is proven to be Rush Limbaugh and Michael Moore, he also reveals himself to be Tony Danza, Camryn Manheim, Malcolm-Jamal Warner, Kevin Nealon, John Forsythe, and Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich. After Savage confesses to his multiple identities, the voice-over from The Wonder Years is heard and Fred shouts at him, [...] "I don't need you anymore!".|$|E
500|$|The video {{opens with}} the view of a city {{populated}} with skyscrapers, intermingling railway lines and aero-crafts. Steam blows out of the funnels of a factory as big machines are shown. Madonna, wearing black lingerie, appears {{on the back of}} a statue <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>angry</b> looking swan, and utters the line: [...] "Come on girls, do you believe in love?" [...] This is followed by the chorus, showing the interiors of the factory where the workers slave at the machines, as rain pour incessantly on them. Amidst the smoke filled environment, the chiseled torso of the male workers are shown, as they strip off their shirts, with water splashing all around. Madonna is then shown in a light-green gown, holding a black cat in her lap, looking across the factory from her sitting room of her penthouse office. As she sings the first verse, the workers perform choreographed dance routine inside the factory. Madonna lies down on a sofa and the cat escapes from her lap, as her singing reaches the owner of the factory, through a series of speakers. He becomes nervous hearing her voice and looks down to find one of the workers staring up and looking for the source of the voice.|$|E
500|$|Many of {{the jokes}} {{used in the}} storyline of this episode were {{originally}} pitched for a subplot of this episode, which saw Stewie building a robot suit {{to make him look}} like an adult to woo Jillian's best friend Ana, but this particular subplot was never used. The scene showing a mayor advertising a 1980s-related CD was included in the original draft for the episode, and, as MacFarlane states, is one of the rare occasions that an act break that is unrelated entirely to the storyline can be included in an episode. Originally, the gag of Stewie using some of Brian's fur to pass it off as his pubic hair {{was going to be the}} only area of his body where he would tell Jillian about his hair, but MacFarlane states that the show was not allowed to mention only pubic hair, and had to steer to a different area on the body that would have hair too, if they wanted to include it. Broadcasting standards allowed the sketch where Peter says [...] "before, women only made me cry through my penis," [...] as he states they [...] "gave in." [...] Additionally, while on the version broadcast Lois dies <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>angry</b> hymen, on the DVD version she dies of a rotten vagina.|$|E

500|$|Castellaneta also {{provides}} the voices for numerous other characters, including Grampa Simpson, Barney Gumble, Krusty the Clown, Groundskeeper Willie, Mayor Quimby, Hans Moleman, Sideshow Mel, Itchy, Kodos, the Squeaky Voiced Teen and Gil Gunderson. Krusty's voice {{is based on}} Chicago television's Bob Bell, who had a very raspy voice and portrayed WGN-TV's Bozo the Clown from 1960 to 1984. Barney's trademark is a loud belch. During early recording sessions for the show, he recorded {{a new version of}} the belch for every episode but discovered that it was not easy for him to do it every time a script called for it. Castellaneta chose a recording of what he believed was his best belch and told the producers to make that the standard. Groundskeeper Willie's first appearance was in the season two episode [...] "Principal Charming". The character was written as an angry janitor and Castellaneta was assigned to perform the voice. He did not know what voice to use and Sam Simon, who was directing at the time, suggested he use an accent. Castellaneta first tried using a Hispanic voicing, which Simon felt was too clichéd. He then tried a [...] "big dumb Swede", which was also rejected. For his third try, he used the voice <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>angry</b> Scotsman, which was deemed appropriate enough and was used in the episode. The voice was based partially on Angus Crock, a kilt-wearing chef from the sketch comedy show Second City Television, who was portrayed by Dave Thomas. Mayor Quimby, who first appeared in [...] "Bart Gets an F", is a parody of various members of the Kennedy family. The episode script did not call for Quimby to be a parody of them, and Castellaneta improvised the accent. Sideshow Mel's voice is Castellaneta's impression of Kelsey Grammer, the voice of Sideshow Bob. Gil is a spoof of actor Jack Lemmon's portrayal of Shelley Levene in the 1992 film adaptation of the play Glengarry Glen Ross. Show runner Mike Scully thought that Gil would be [...] "a one-shot thing" [...] but [...] "Dan Castellaneta was so funny at the table read doing the character, we kept making up excuses in subsequent episodes to put him in." [...] The Blue-Haired Lawyer's voice, as well as his demeanor, is based on lawyer Roy Cohn.|$|E

40|$|Perception {{of facial}} {{expressions}} of emotion is generally assumed {{to correspond to}} underlying muscle movement. However, it is often observed that some individuals have sadder or angrier faces, even for neutral, motionless faces. Here, we report on one such effect caused by simple static configural changes. In particular, we show four variations in the relative vertical position of the nose, mouth, eyes, and eyebrows that affect the perception of emotion in neutral faces. The first two configurations make the vertical distance between the eyes and mouth shorter than average, resulting in the perception <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>angrier</b> face. The other two configurations make this distance larger than average, resulting {{in the perception of}} sadness. These perceptions increase with the amount of configural change, suggesting a representation based on variations from a norm (prototypical) face...|$|R
2500|$|Moral apologetics {{states that}} real moral {{obligation}} is a fact. Catholic apologist Peter Kreeft said, [...] "We are really, truly, objectively obligated {{to do good}} and avoid evil." [...] In moral apologetics, the arguments for man's sinfulness and man's need for redemption are stressed. Examples {{of this type of}} apologetic would be Jonathan Edwards's sermon [...] "Sinners in the Hands <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>Angry</b> God." [...] The Four Spiritual Laws religious tract (Campus Crusade for Christ) would be another example.|$|E
2500|$|Initially, the Awakening's strongest {{supporters}} {{came from}} Congregational ministers, {{who had already}} been working to foster revivals in their parishes. Itinerants and local pastors worked together to produce and nourish revivals, and often local pastors would cooperate together to lead revivals in neighboring parishes. The most famous sermon preached during the Great Awakening, for example, was [...] "Sinners in the Hands <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>Angry</b> God" [...] delivered by Edwards at Enfield, Connecticut, in July 1741. Many in the congregation were affected by Edwards's sermon with minister Stephen Williams reporting [...] "amazing shrieks and cries" [...] caused by the heightened religious excitement.|$|E
2500|$|Jonathan Edwards is {{considered}} to be [...] "America's most important and original philosophical theologian." [...] Noted for his energetic sermons, such as [...] "Sinners in the Hands <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>Angry</b> God" [...] (which is said to have begun the First Great Awakening), Edwards emphasized [...] "the absolute sovereignty of God and the beauty of God's holiness." [...] Working to unite Christian Platonism with an empiricist epistemology, with the aid of Newtonian physics, Edwards was deeply influenced by George Berkeley, himself an empiricist, and Edwards derived his importance of the immaterial for the creation of human experience from Bishop Berkeley.|$|E
