40|$|The method (100) {{involves}} generating (102) the <b>authentication</b> <b>certificate</b> for authenticating a user by {{a mobile}} terminal. The <b>authentication</b> <b>certificate</b> {{is generated by}} an identity administrator {{in response to a}} first certificate and a second certificate. The first certificate is based on a secure information of a physical identity. The physical identity is assigned to the user by the identity administrator and uniquely identifies the user by a third party. Independent claims are included for the following: (1) a computer program product with instructions; and (2) a computer program for executing the method.

40|$|Abstract- Portable {{communication}} system provides mobile users with global roaming services. Localized authentication protocol is presented for inter-network roaming across wireless LANS. Private authentication protocol {{is presented to}} prevent the home location register. The concept of delegation in wireless communication is used {{to solve the problems}} of data security, user privacy and efficiency in PCSs. Authentication protocol contains online and <b>off-line</b> <b>authentication</b> processes. In the on-line authentication process, VLR connects with HLR when MS accesses the network through VLR and demands authentication. HLR also leaves secure authentication tokens with MS and VLR in this process. The <b>off-line</b> <b>authentication</b> process means that VLR need not contact HLR frequently and can rapidly authenticate MS by verifying the secure token when MS accesses the network VLR again. Delegation is used to increase the communicational efficiency, and save the authentication time. Their protocol employs <b>off-line</b> <b>authentication</b> processes, such that VLR does not need to contact HLR frequently, and can rapidly re-authenticate MS. The protocol exhibits nonrepudiation in on-line authentication process, it still has a weakness in <b>off-line</b> <b>authentication</b> processes. Without the non-repudiation property, a protocol may inspire a mobile user to deny that was used its services and to pay, or inspire a service provider to over charge a mobile user for services that wont request...|$|R

40|$|In {{the chapter}} we present {{some of the}} {{techniques}} proposed for authenticating digital streams. We start with the so-called block signatures, where every packet contains full information needed for its authentication. Then, we describe two techniques based on a simple hash chain for an <b>off-line</b> <b>authentication</b> and its modification where one-time signatures are used for an on-line authentication. Later, we consider the TESLA scheme for authenticating streams in case of synchronous systems. This is followed by augmented hash chains with signature packets used once per a sequence of packets rather than for the whole stream. The chapter is concluded with a short comparison of the considered techniques...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{personal}} identification {{in mobile}} scenarios {{has attracted a}} lot of attention {{in the last few years}} due to the emergence of new communications paradigms that enable the establishment of ad hoc communications. These communications must be carried out in a secure way since they can be involved in applications such as payments and access systems. Consequently, new secure systems should be proposed for managing security in such complex, mobile and variable conditions. This paper proposes a new authentication system based on the Spanish ID card and the wireless NFC (Near Field Communication) technology. It uses cryptography techniques and <b>authentication</b> <b>certificates</b> to establish secure communications between two interlocutors. The proposed network oriented architecture enables the proposed authentication system to operate in both local and remote modes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. RFID-tags are {{becoming}} very popular tools for identification of products. As {{they have a}} small microchip on board, they offer functionality {{that can be used}} for security purposes. This chip functionality makes it possible to verify the authenticity of a product and hence to detect and prevent counterfeiting. In order to be successful for these security purposes too, RFID-tags have to be resistant against many attacks, in particular against cloning of the tag. In this paper, we investigate how an RFID-tag can be made unclonable by linking it inseparably to a Physical Unclonable Function (PUF). We present the security protocols that are needed for the detection of the authenticity of a product when it is equipped with such a system. We focus on <b>off-line</b> <b>authentication</b> because it is very attractive from a practical point of view. We show that a PUF based solution for RFID-tags is feasible in the off-line case...|$|R

The first approach implements a gateway service to handle <b>authentication</b> <b>certificates</b> and all communication with the grid. It reads the database to spawn web services for workflow elements which are in turn used by Taverna. The second approach lets Taverna communicate with the grid on its own, {{by means of a}} newly developed plug-in. It reads the database and executes the needed tasks directly on the grid. While the gateway service is non-intrusive, the plug-in has technical advantages, e. g. by allowing data to remain on the grid while being passed betweenworkflow elements...|$|R
