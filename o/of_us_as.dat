5|$|The Last of Us: Left Behind {{is similar}} to the basic {{gameplay}} of The Last <b>of</b> <b>Us.</b> <b>As</b> such, it is an action-adventure survival horror game that uses a third-person perspective. The game involves gunfights, melee combat and a cover system. Players control Ellie. An added feature in combat is the ability to focus the attention of the Infected towards human enemies, by throwing objects to distract them. This results in a lower number of enemies to encounter, giving players a tactical advantage. Throughout the game, players encounter locations and activities around the mall, such as a carousel, photo booth, video arcade, mask store and water guns. All of these locations and activities have some level of interactivity, allowing players to use them in different ways; for example, the photo booth allows players to select different mannerisms in which to pose for a picture, while using the water guns prompts players to soak Riley.|$|E

[...] The character treats men as dispensable entities, similar to how men usually treat women. She does not treat men as if they are {{the most important thing in}} her life because she is more focused on her work, with men just happen to come and go in her life. Chopra explained [...] "I think that's extremely empowering on her end. It may not be something I personally agree with or something I do, but I think different people have different individual choices that they make." ...|$|E

500|$|Druckmann views The Last <b>of</b> <b>Us</b> <b>as</b> {{a coming}} of age story, in which Ellie adapts to {{survival}} after spending time with Joel, {{as well as an}} exploration of how willing a father is to save his child. A major motif of the game is that [...] "life goes on"; this is presented in a scene in which Joel and Ellie discover a herd of giraffes, which concept artist John Sweeney explained was designed to [...] "reignite [...] lust for life", after her suffering following her encounter with David. The Infected, a core concept of the game, were inspired by a segment of the BBC nature documentary Planet Earth (2006), which featured the Cordyceps fungi. Though the fungi mainly infect insects, taking control of their motor functions and forcing them to help cultivate the fungus, the game explores the concept of the fungus evolving and infecting humans, and the direct results of an outbreak of this infection.|$|E

500|$|Critic Bill Wyman {{acknowledges}} that Lydon's [...] "fierce intelligence and astonishing onstage charisma" [...] were important catalysts, but ultimately finds the band's real meaning lies in McLaren's provocative media manipulations. While {{some of the}} Sex Pistols' public affronts were plotted by McLaren, Westwood, and company, others were evidently not—including what McLaren himself cites as the [...] "pivotal moment that changed everything", the clash on the Bill Grundy Today show. [...] "Malcolm milked situations", says Cook, [...] "he didn't instigate them; that was always our own doing." [...] It is also hard to ascribe {{the effect of the}} Sex Pistols' early Manchester shows on that city's nascent punk scene to anyone other than the musicians themselves. Matlock later wrote that at the point when he left the band, it was beginning to occur to him that McLaren [...] "was in fact quite deliberately perpetrating that idea <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>as</b> his puppets.... However, on the other hand, I've since found out that even Malcolm wasn't as aware of {{what he was up to}} as he has since made out." [...] By his absence, Matlock demonstrated how crucial he was to the band's creativity: in the eleven months between his departure and the Pistols' demise, they composed only two songs.|$|E
500|$|Pearl Jam {{commenced}} {{work on a}} {{new album}} following a year-long break after its full-scale tour in support of Binaural. McCready described the recording environment as [...] "a pretty positive one" [...] and [...] "very intense and spiritual." [...] Regarding the time period when the lyrics were being written, Vedder said, [...] "There's {{been a lot of}} mortality...It's a weird time to be writing. Roskilde changed the shape <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>as</b> people, and our filter for seeing the world changed." [...] Pearl Jam released its seventh album, Riot Act, on November 12, 2002. It included the singles [...] "I Am Mine" [...] and [...] "Save You". The album featured a much more folk-based and experimental sound, evident in the presence of B3 organist Boom Gaspar on songs such as [...] "Love Boat Captain". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said [...] "Riot Act is the album that Pearl Jam has been wanting to make since Vitalogy—a muscular art rock record, one that still hits hard but that is filled with ragged edges and odd detours." [...] The track entitled [...] "Arc" [...] was recorded as a vocal tribute to the nine people who died at the Roskilde Festival in June 2000. Vedder only performed this song nine times on the 2003 tour, and the band left the track off all released bootlegs.|$|E
500|$|For The Last of Us, {{the team}} had to create new engines to satisfy their needs. The {{artificial}} intelligence (AI) was created to coordinate with players on an intimate level, {{as opposed to the}} action elements from their previous projects; the addition of Ellie as AI was also a major contributor to the engine. The team intentionally added a feature in which Ellie remains close to Joel, in order to avoid being conceived as a [...] "burden". Programmer Max Dyckhoff stated that, when working on Ellie as AI, he tried to imagine her experiences throughout the game's events, in an attempt to achieve realism. The enemy AI, {{considered one of the most}} important features of the game, was developed to make random choices; they study their surroundings, finding tactics to attack the player. This uniqueness to gameplay was a factor into the attempt at making players feel emotions towards the enemies. The lighting engine was also re-created to incorporate soft light, in which the sunlight seeps in through spaces and reflects off surfaces. The team found great difficulty in developing the gameplay for The Last <b>of</b> <b>Us,</b> <b>as</b> they felt that every mechanic required thorough analysis. [...] "You feel a lot of pressure to add things to make it 'more fun' and it gets super difficult to keep those out sometimes," [...] Druckmann said. In The Last of Us, the weapon that players have equipped change the behavior of the human NPCs. In addition, the stealth system was intentionally developed to offer a sense of desperation, to make players feel the same.|$|E

500|$|To {{promote his}} {{developing}} ideas for an expedition that would overwinter on the Antarctic continent at Cape Adare, Borchgrevink hurried to London, where the Royal Geographical Society was hosting the Sixth International Geographical Congress. On 1 August 1895 {{he addressed the}} conference, giving {{an account of the}} Cape Adare foreshore as a location where a scientific expedition might establish itself for the Antarctic winter. He described the site as [...] "a safe situation for houses, tents and provisions", and said there were indications that in this place [...] "the unbound forces of the Antarctic Circle do not display the full severity of their powers". He also suggested that the interior of the continent might be accessible from the foreshore by an easy route—a [...] "gentle slope". He ended his speech by declaring his willingness to lead an expedition there himself. Hugh Robert Mill, the Royal Geographical Society's librarian, who was present at the Congress, reported reactions to the speech: [...] "His blunt manner and abrupt speech stirred the academic discussions with a fresh breeze of realism. Nobody liked Borchgrevink very much at that time, but he had a dynamic quality and a set purpose to get out again to the unknown South that struck some <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>as</b> boding well for exploration". The Congress did not, however, endorse Borchgrevink's ideas. Instead, it passed a general resolution in support of Antarctic exploration, to the effect that [...] "the various scientific societies throughout the world should urge, in whatever way seems to them most effective, that this work be undertaken before the close of the century".|$|E
500|$|On 4 July 1947, Liaquat asked Mountbatten on Jinnah's behalf to {{recommend}} to the British king, George VI, that Jinnah be appointed Pakistan's first governor-general. This request angered Mountbatten, who {{had hoped to}} have that position in both dominions—he would be India's first post-independence governor-general—but Jinnah felt that Mountbatten {{would be likely to}} favour the new Hindu-majority state because of his closeness to Nehru. In addition, the governor-general would initially be a powerful figure, and Jinnah did not trust anyone else to take that office. Although the Boundary Commission, led by British lawyer Sir Cyril Radcliffe, had not yet reported, there were already massive movements of populations between the nations-to-be, as well as sectarian violence. [...] Jinnah arranged to sell his house in Bombay and procured a new one in Karachi. On 7 August, Jinnah, with his sister and close staff, flew from Delhi to Karachi in Mountbatten's plane, and as the plane taxied, he was heard to murmur, [...] "That's the end of that." [...] On 11 August, he presided over the new constituent assembly for Pakistan at Karachi, and addressed them, [...] "You are free; you are free to go to your temples, you are free to go to your mosques or to any other place of worship in this State of Pakistan... You may belong to any religion or caste or creed—that {{has nothing to do with}} the business of the State ... I think we should keep that in front <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>as</b> our ideal and you will find that in course of time Hindus would cease to be Hindus and Muslims would cease to be Muslims, not in the religious sense, because that is the personal faith of each individual, but in the political sense as citizens of the State." [...] On 14 August, Pakistan became independent; Jinnah led the celebrations in Karachi. One observer wrote, [...] "here indeed is Pakistan's King Emperor, Archbishop of Canterbury, Speaker and Prime Minister concentrated into one formidable Quaid-e-Azam." ...|$|E
500|$|The lyrics on Riot Act {{were more}} direct than on {{preceding}} records, {{in response to}} the political climate after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Bassist Jeff Ament commented that he felt that love was a major theme of the album, and Vedder tried to convey themes such as love, loss and struggle to make a difference because of the difficulty in leading with events such as the September 11 attacks and the accidental death of nine fans during Pearl Jam's performance at the 2000 Roskilde Festival – [...] "You start feeling like, 'What do I have to say? What is my opinion?' Then I realized I did have an opinion. Not only did I have one, but I felt like it was formed by processing a lot of information and having good influences. Ament also told that [...] "I think the time's right to turn our voice up a bit [...] And Ed did it in a great way, with humour and a mystical, magical approach. It isn't just, 'We're pissed off, and fuck you! Riot! Anarchy!' Cos I don't think that's the method. At least at this point." [...] Vedder, however, said, [...] "I have to admit this record came out a bit one-sided. But I think we as a country need to understand why we're involved in the Middle East. This hollow patriotism frightens me." [...] The singer added that the Riot Act lyrics [...] "represent my state of mind these days. I'm optimistic yet disillusioned, hopeful yet frustrated." [...] Several songs on the album were inspired by Roskilde tragedy, with the album's first single, [...] "I Am Mine", being written by Vedder in 2000 in a hotel room before the band's first show after Roskilde, and [...] "Love Boat Captain" [...] including a brief lyrical reference ("Lost nine friends we'll never know... two years ago today"). Regarding the time period when the lyrics were being written, Vedder said, [...] "There's been a lot of mortality...It's a weird time to be writing. Roskilde changed the shape <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>as</b> people, and our filter for seeing the world changed." ...|$|E
