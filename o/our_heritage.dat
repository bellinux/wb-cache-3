5|$|This is no {{time for}} men who oppose Senator McCarthy's methods to keep silent, or for those who approve. We can deny <b>our</b> <b>heritage</b> and our history, but we cannot escape {{responsibility}} for the result. There is no way for a citizen of a republic to abdicate his responsibilities. As a nation we have come into our full inheritance at a tender age. We proclaim ourselves, as indeed we are, the defenders of freedom, wherever it continues to exist in the world, but we cannot defend freedom abroad by deserting it at home.|$|E
25|$|In 1972 Santa Fe {{proposed}} to demolish {{the station and}} replace it with two 12-story buildings. After protests from the Save <b>Our</b> <b>Heritage</b> Organization, the city's Historical Review Board, and Mayor Pete Wilson, Amtrak agreed to preserve the station if the city would redevelop the surrounding neighborhood.|$|E
25|$|In August 2010 a {{proposal}} was unveiled by then-Mayor Jerry Sanders and philanthropist Irwin M. Jacobs {{to divert traffic}} away from the central Prado areas of the park, such as the Plaza de Panama {{in front of the}} Art Museum and the California Quadrangle in front of the Museum of Man, and restore the areas to pedestrian use. The plan would provide replacement parking via a two-level parking garage {{at the site of the}} current Spreckles Organ Pavilion parking lot. The plan also called for changes in access to the park via the Cabrillo Bridge. The bridge would become one-way, eastbound only, so that people could enter the park via the Cabrillo Bridge but could exit only via Park Boulevard. Inbound traffic would be deflected via a new bridge offramp through the current Alcazar Gardens parking lot toward the new parking garage. The Alcazar Gardens parking lot would be for disabled parking only and for loading and unloading of passengers. The new parking garage would house 750–900 cars and would be landscaped on top. The plan became controversial because of its alteration to the appearance of the bridge and the possibility of charging for parking in the parking garage. In July 2012 the City Council voted to proceed with the Jacobs plan. Construction was due to begin in October 2012 and be completed in time for the park's centennial in 2015. However, the scheduled start of construction was pushed back to February 2013 due to a legal challenge from the Save <b>Our</b> <b>Heritage</b> Organization (SOHO). In February 2013 a judge voided the project, after which Jacobs withdrew his offer to finance it. Since the Park's master plan already called for removing the 67-space parking lot from the Plaza de Panama, the city went ahead with that portion of the proposal, removing all parking from the plaza and converting it into a pedestrian area with tree planters, seats, and tables.|$|E

It became a prominent issue after a nationally televised game against Notre Dame. The mouthpiece became a symbol for two opposing viewpoints: for Mexican-Americans, it was a symbol of unity—Sanchez accepting his heritage; for critics, the gesture symbolized a radical political statement. Sanchez, who {{was born and raised in}} the United States, received hate mail urging him to return to Mexico. Sanchez responded to the controversy stating, [...] "It’s not a Mexican power thing or anything like that. It’s just a little bit of pride in <b>our</b> <b>heritage.</b> Hopefully, it inspires somebody and it’s all for the best." [...] Overwhelmed by the attention and shying away from politics, Sanchez stopped wearing the mouthpiece, but began participating in other efforts to help the Hispanic community.|$|E
