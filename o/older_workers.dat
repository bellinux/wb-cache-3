5|$|Large green-head ant colonies exhibit age caste polyethism, {{where the}} younger workers act as nurses {{and tend to}} the brood and the <b>older</b> <b>workers</b> go out and forage. In smaller colonies, age caste polyethism does not occur, with nursing and {{foraging}} initiated by both younger and <b>older</b> <b>workers.</b> These results show that ageing is not the mechanism that drives labour among colonies. The emergence of age polyethism in larger colonies {{is a result of}} worker specialisation. Workers in small colonies usually tend to the brood much more than those in larger colonies, but {{this is due to the}} differentiated social environment between small and large societies. In contrast, old workers from large colonies forage for significant periods of time, and those in small colonies forage less. A predatory species such as the green-head ant may not be able to increase prey retrieval within its environment, even if there is a larger foraging force. This means that the workers may have to spend more time foraging to retrieve any prey item. Contact among nestmates also differs between small and large colonies, strongly suggesting that colony size regulates contact rates. Higher contact rates allow colonies to scan their environment and determine their needs more quickly, which makes a colony react faster. Task allocation patterns (referring to the way that tasks are chosen) are different in small and large colonies, which may determine the contact rate.|$|E
25|$|There {{is clear}} polyethism among A. pallipes where the young workers {{care for the}} larvae and <b>older</b> <b>workers</b> forage and defend the nest. It is {{hypothesized}} that the young workers are delegated {{to stay in the}} nest and care for larvae because it is significantly safer {{within the confines of the}} nest while the <b>older</b> <b>workers</b> are outside being exposed to predation in order to increase life expectancy of the workers. Other activities performed by the <b>older</b> <b>workers</b> include removing larvae from the nest, rubbing gaster on the nest and destroying cells. Intra-cell activities like checking cells, moving gaster and self-grooming were all-indicative of younger workers. Therefore, there is a clear relation between age and function thus implying that A. pallipes displays temporal polyethism behavior.|$|E
40|$|Current {{research}} into organizational age discrimination has placed {{a focus on}} the consequences of ageism and economic pressures of an ageing workforce, rather than endeavouring to understand the social processes that create and reproduce ageist ideologies within an organizational context. This article departs from mainstream approaches within age and employment studies in order to explore <b>older</b> <b>worker</b> identity as a discursive phenomenon. Analysis shows how the social construction of the `older worker' may in itself serve to marginalize and contribute towards age inequalities through three discursive strategies: contextualizing the problem, essentializing <b>older</b> <b>worker</b> characteristics and ventriloquizing the <b>older</b> <b>worker.</b> The conclusions seek to situate these findings within larger political and practitioner debates concerning the <b>older</b> <b>worker</b> agenda and how distancing the <b>older</b> <b>worker</b> from chronological or biological determinism may serve to further our understanding of organizational age inequality as a social process...|$|R

25|$|Temporal polyethism is not {{adaptive}} {{because of}} maximized efficiency; indeed <b>older</b> <b>workers</b> are actually more efficient at brood care than younger workers in some ant species.

If workers experience injuries, which shortens their life expectancies, they will start foraging sooner than healthy workers of the same age.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the paper is to summarize labor market implications of population aging and to discuss policy options to increase the employment of <b>old</b> <b>workers.</b> The paper argues that population aging and ensuing shrinking of the workforce will create a significant drag on the economies of developed, transition, and even some developing countries. Thus working longer is an imperative: unless countered by productivity increases, working longer, or both, population aging and ensuing shrinking of labor force will reduce economic growth and may jeopardize the economic well-being {{of some of the}} elderly. However, extending working lives has proven difficult, both because workers do not want to work longer and because employers are lukewarm about employment <b>old</b> <b>workers.</b> Among measures to motivate workers to work longer, the paper proposes providing retirement incentives and attractive, flexible working arrangements; and to stimulate employers to hire <b>old</b> <b>workers,</b> it argues for removing obstacles imposed by restrictive labor market institutions, for increasing human capital of workers via life-long learning, and for addressing age discrimination. Chances for extending working lives will also increase with improving health of <b>old</b> <b>workers.</b> The organization of the paper is as follows. Section 1 discusses the implications of population aging for economic growth. Section 2 examines factors that {{stand in the way of}} longer working lives - why workers opt for early exit from the labor market, and why employers are often lukewarm about employing <b>old</b> <b>workers.</b> In the policy part of the paper, Section 3 proposes possible measures to attract workers to work longer, and Section 4 describes how to remove institutional obstacles and introduce incentives that would make <b>old</b> <b>workers</b> more appealing to employers.

With most of these plans chronically underfunded in the late 1990s, the companies have tried to provide retirement packages to <b>older</b> <b>workers,</b> and made agreements with the UAW to transfer pension obligations to an independent trust.

25|$|As {{the size}} of a colony {{increases}} to the point where at least 30 workers are foraging at the same time, competition develops between workers. Often, one worker will attack the prey of another worker, resulting in neither worker bringing back prey. <b>Older</b> <b>workers</b> are more successful in attacking. They may also maul to exhibit dominance over nest mates; mauling entails one individual chewing another individual that remains motionless throughout. Generally, this occurs between two workers, with the aggressive worker beginning the mauling process when a returning forager enters or is near the entrance of the nest. At any given time, certain individuals repeatedly express mauling tendencies and recipients remain constant. Over time, the recipients become the maulers as they approach old age. As the colonies decline, mauling becomes less frequent.|$|E
25|$|Aside {{from the}} wage dispute, {{there were other}} {{elements}} of grievances {{that contributed to the}} strike of 1968. A change in the way trash was collected in the city reduced the amount of sanitation workers needed to perform the work.

The savings from this new system of garbage collection was to be passed onto the sanitation workers, which according to the workers never materialized. Furthermore, <b>older</b> <b>workers</b> with seniority in the department feared termination over the newly implemented trash containers as they were heavier and more difficult to handle.

The attitudes about old people and the <b>older</b> <b>worker</b> were measured both before and after instruction. Two questionnaires were used. The first questionnaire was about old people. It con-sisted of 137 statements regarding physical changes with age, mental deterioration, activities and interests, family relation-ships, conservatism, insecurity, etc. The second questionnaire was about the <b>older</b> <b>worker.</b> It consisted of 51 statements re-garding physicaI decline, mental decfine, attitudes toward supervisors, attitudes toward retirement, and resistance to change.

25|$|In areas it is native to, the red {{important}} {{fire ant}} {{is still a}} dominant species and coexists with 28 ant species in gallery forest gaps and ten species in xerophytic forest grassland, winning most aggressive interactions with other ants. However, some ants can be co-dominant in areas where they coexist such as the Argentine ant, where they compete symmetrically. Workers regularly engage in food competition with other ants, and can suppress the exploitation of food resources from honeydew-producing hemipterans (specifically from Phenacoccus solenopsis) from native ants; however, red important fire ants are unable to eliminate T. melanocephalum completely although they consume {{a higher proportion of}} food. Instead, the two ants may peacefully coexist and share the honeydew. When encountering neighboring fire ants, workers may take on death-feigning behaviours to avoid them with success. However, such behaviour is only seen in young workers, as <b>older</b> <b>workers</b> either flee or fight back when threatened.|$|E
25|$|Under Olof Palme's premiership tenure, matters {{concerned}} with child care centers, social security, {{protection of the}} elderly, accident safety, and housing problems received special attention. Under Palme the public health system in Sweden became efficient, with the infant mortality rate standing at 12 per 1,000 live births. An ambitious redistributive programme was carried out, with special help provided to the disabled, immigrants, the low paid, single-parent families, and the old. The Swedish welfare state was significantly expanded from a position already {{one of the most}} far-reaching in the world during his time in office. As noted by Isabela Mares, {{during the first half of}} the Seventies “the level of benefits provided by every subsystem of the welfare state improved significantly.” Various policy changes increased the basic old-age pension replacement rate from 42% of the average wage in 1969 to 57%, while a health care reform carried out in 1974 integrated all health services and increased the minimum replacement rate from 64% to 90% of earnings. In 1974, supplementary unemployment assistance was established, providing benefits to those workers ineligible for existing benefits. In 1971, eligibility for invalidity pensions was extended with greater opportunities for employees over the age of 60. In 1974, universal dental insurance was introduced, and former maternity benefits were replaced by a parental allowance. In 1974, housing allowances for families with children were raised and these allowances were extended to other low-income groups. Childcare centres were also expanded under Palme, and separate taxation of husband and wife introduced. Access to pensions for <b>older</b> <b>workers</b> in poor health was liberalised in 1970, and a disability pension was introduced for older unemployed workers in 1972.|$|E
25|$|Although {{workers could}} be redundant, the {{employer}} {{may still be}} liable for unfair dismissal by following an unfair procedure. The procedure the employer follows to select employees to make redundant must be procedurally fair. In Williams v Compair Maxam Ltd Browne-Wilkinson J held that the proper steps should be to (1) give all warning possible (2) consult the union (3) agree objective criteria (4) follow those criteria, and (5) always check there if there is alternative employment rather than dismissal. This meant that the managers, who had selected workers {{to lose their jobs}} based on personal preferences, had unfairly dismissed the workforce. The criteria that the employer uses must be observable, and reviewable. However, employers do not need to disclose to employees all the details of their reasoning when they select people for redundancy unless there is a specific complaint of unfairness. A last in, first out policy, as used in many collective agreements will be regarded as fair. For example, in Rolls Royce plc v Unite the Union, Rolls Royce plc challenged a collective agreement which gave extra points in a selection procedure for years of service as being unlawful discrimination against younger workers (who it wished to retain). The Court of Appeal agreed with the union that this represented a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim of rewarding seniority, particularly since <b>older</b> <b>workers</b> might find alternative employment much harder to secure. If possible, employers should attempt to redeploy redundant staff within their firm. Under ERA 1996 section 141 an employee should accept a suitable offer for redeployment, and will lose entitlement to redundancy if he or she declines it. 'Suitable' means substantially similar in terms of status, wages and types of duties. For example, in Thomas Wragg & Sons Ltd v Wood the Employment Appeal Tribunal held that it was reasonable for Mr Wood to refuse an alternative job offer the day before his termination took effect. He was therefore redundant. There is also, under section 138, a right to refuse an alternative job to which an employee is redeployed after a four-week trial period if it would be reasonable. However, redeployment remains an option for the employer that gives it greater scope to avoid redundancy payments. A right for the employee to be redeployed does not yet exist, except {{to the extent that the}} employer must consult about redeployment possibilities when more than 20 employees could be redundant.|$|E
