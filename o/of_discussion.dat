5|$|The {{concept of}} truthiness {{has emerged as}} a major subject <b>of</b> <b>discussion</b> {{surrounding}} U.S. politics during the 1990s and 2000s because of the perception among some observers of a rise in propaganda and a growing hostility toward factual reporting and fact-based discussion.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationships between undergraduate students' frequency <b>of</b> <b>discussions</b> <b>of</b> socio-cultural issues and their understanding of diversity and self-awareness. Differences in students' interaction patterns by race/ethnicity and gender were also explored. The data {{used in this study}} consisted of 48, 118 undergraduate students from 52 institutions of higher education across the country, and were collected in the spring of 2006 {{as a part of the}} Multi-Institutional Study of Leadership. Data were analyzed using a series of hierarchical multiple regressions to investigate the contribution <b>of</b> <b>discussions</b> <b>of</b> socio-cultural issues in explaining variance in the outcomes, and a series of analyses of variance (ANOVA) to compare group differences by race/ethnicity and gender. <b>Discussions</b> <b>of</b> socio-cultural issues emerged as a significant predictor of variance in the outcome variables for each of the six racial/ethnic groups studied, and various racial/ethnic and gender differences emerged in frequencies <b>of</b> <b>discussions.</b> Multiracial students reported significantly higher frequencies <b>of</b> socio-cultural issue <b>discussions</b> than most other racial/ethnic groups, whereas Asian American students reported significantly lower frequencies. For Multiracial and White students, females reported significantly higher frequencies <b>of</b> <b>discussions</b> than did males, while for African American/Black students, males reported higher frequencies...|$|R

5|$|After the war, {{increased}} wartime {{manufacturing and}} industrial growth {{ushered in a}} new era of economic prosperity, and Indianapolis's population increased from 8,000 in 1850 to 45,000 at the end of 1864. A real-estate boom led to the establishment of new residential suburbs, but the city retained its slums. Indianapolis also experienced improvements to its public services, such as health care, utilities, street railways, and public schools. By 1880 Indianapolis was Indiana's commercial and industrial center. Construction for the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument began in 1888, in the center of downtown Indianapolis, after decades <b>of</b> <b>discussion.</b> The city's iconic monument was dedicated on May 15, 1902.|$|E
5|$|Allegations {{have been}} made of {{omissions}} in the history described by the film. The absence <b>of</b> <b>discussion</b> of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was noticed by some viewers. Davis claimed that Leo Strauss's ideas had been formed by his experiences in Germany during the Weimar Republic, and alleged that the film's failure to mention this was motivated by a wish to portray Strauss as concerned with American suburban culture, like Qutb.|$|E
5|$|An item <b>of</b> <b>discussion</b> {{between the}} {{production}} staff was over who would rescue Rose; Davies and Julie Gardner wanted Pete to rescue her, while Clarke and Phil Collinson wanted Mickey. The role was ultimately given to Pete, to emphasise {{that he had}} accepted Rose as a surrogate daughter. The Doctor's intended reply to Rose was also discussed; Davies, who left the reply unspecified, stated he didn't know when asked by Collinson on the episode's commentary track, and Gardner vehemently believed the Doctor would reciprocate Rose's love.|$|E

5|$|Chavrusa {{learning}} {{tends to}} be loud and animated, as the study partners read the Talmudic text and the commentaries aloud {{to each other and}} then analyze, question, debate, and defend their points of view to arrive at a mutual understanding of the text. In the heat <b>of</b> <b>discussion,</b> they may wave their hands or even shout at each other. Depending {{on the size of the}} yeshiva, dozens or even hundreds of chavrusas can be heard discussing and debating each other's opinions. One of the skills of chavrusa learning is the ability to block out all other discussions in the study hall and focus on one's study partner alone.|$|E
5|$|Chopin's {{disease and}} the cause of his death have since been a matter <b>of</b> <b>discussion.</b> His death {{certificate}} gave the cause as tuberculosis, and his physician, Jean Cruveilhier, was then the leading French authority on this disease. Other possibilities have been advanced including cystic fibrosis, cirrhosis and alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency. In 2017, an autopsy was performed on Chopin's preserved heart, which confirmed that a rare case of pericarditis, caused by complications from chronic tuberculosis, was the likely cause of his death.|$|E
