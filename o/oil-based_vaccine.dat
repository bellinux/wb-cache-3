40|$|The immune response, as {{measured}} by the haemagglutination-inhibition test, to the simultaneous administration of live Hitchner B 1 and 2 commercially available, inactivated, oil-based, emulsified, Newcastle disease vaccines at day-old is described. The response was monitored from day-old to 18 weeks, when the birds were challenged with a standardized virulent virus. It was found that the haemagglutination-inhibition titre fell below log₂ 5 when the chicks were 10 weeks of age. Challenge at 18 weeks yielded a mortality rate of 25 % in the groups receiving both live Hitchner B 1 and an <b>oil-based</b> <b>vaccine</b> in comparison with 94 % in the group receiving Hitchner B 1 alone. Simultaneous application of live and oil-based vaccines at day-old is conclusively insufficient to maintain adequate protection until 18 weeks and it is recommended that a booster vaccine be administered at 10 weeks.

40|$|Porcine circovirus type- 2 (PCV 2) is {{widespread}} in domestic pig populations. It can be shed with boar semen, but the role boars have in epidemiology is still unclear. Vaccinating boars against PCV 2 can reduce disease and virus load in semen, but may have unwanted side effects, that is, impairment of spermatogenesis. Therefore, {{the aim of}} this study was to investigate the effect and impact of two different PCV 2 vaccines on boar semen quality and quantity. Healthy normospermic Large White boars in three groups of 12 each were vaccinated with either Circovac, Ingelvac CircoFLEX, or received NaCl. Eight ejaculates were collected starting 1 week after vaccination and assessed for quantitative traits. In general, sperm quantity and quality parameters did not change due to the vaccination (P > 0. 05). Only DNA integrity between the Circovac and control group was P < 0. 05 but remained at a low level (< 2 %). One boar showed clinical signs with body temperature up to 39. 9 °C and went off feed. For this animal, a clear relation between vaccination, fever period, and impaired sperm quality could be observed. The results indicate that both vaccines did not have a major impact on sperm quality or quantity. Therefore, vaccination of boars against PCV 2 seems to be feasible. However, one boar treated with the <b>oil-based</b> <b>vaccine</b> showed a temporarily impaired semen quality after elevated body temperature after vaccination. Thus, possible systemic reactions and the subsequent impact on sperm quality should be taken into account when choosing a PCV 2 vaccine for boars...|$|E
40|$|M. Tech. Veterinary Technology. Aims of {{this study}} were to: {{determine}} the suitable buffers and optimal concentrations of these buffers, {{to be used in the}} ISA 206 B <b>oil-based</b> <b>vaccine</b> formulations that will ensure pH levels of &#x 2265 %x; 7. 0; consistent emulsion type and particle sizes following a storage period of at least 24 months at 4 C; determine the effects of temperature on the stability of the vaccine formulation during storage; determine the optimal buffer antigen ratio in the water phase of the ISA 206 B oil-adjuvanted FMD vaccine containing SAT serotypes; determine the effects of saponin (Q-Vac trade mark) on the buffering capacity during storage, in the ISA 206 B oil-adjuvanted FMD vaccine containing the SAT serotypes; and determine the shelf life of this improved (stabilised) oil vaccine. Previous research by the ARC scientists has shown that the immunity elicited by the ISA 206 oil adjuvanted vaccines could persist up to 50 weeks post vaccination in cattle (Cloete et al., 2008; Hunter, 1996). However, they did not show if this immunity was protective or not. Although it is known within the FMD field that sometimes immunity levels do not always translate into protection against an infection, if protection can be shown - even after vaccination using a stored vaccines - achievement of the above mentioned objectives could enable a once-a-year vaccination regimen in the control zone of RSA. Moreover, this once-a-year vaccination regimen could also substantially reduce the logistical costs involved during vaccination campaigns, compared to the current biannual vaccination regimen. Once the shelf life of the vaccine has been established, the vaccine could also be registered as a stock remedy under the Fertilisers, Farm Feed, Agricultural Remedies and Stock Remedies Act, 36 of 1947, administered by DAFF. The registration of this vaccine could in turn enable the RSA to supply the vaccine to neighbouring South African Development Community (SADC) countries and the rest of African countries where the SAT serotypes occur...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Two {{decades after}} the {{introduction}} of <b>oil-based</b> <b>vaccines</b> in the control of bacterial and viral diseases in farmed salmonids, the mechanisms of induced side effects manifested as intra-abdominal granulomas remain unresolved. Side effects {{have been associated with}} generation of auto-antibodies and autoimmunity but the underlying profile of inflammatory and immune response has not been characterized. This study was undertaken with the aim to elucidate the inflammatory and immune mechanisms of granuloma formation at gene expression level associated with high and low side effect (granuloma) indices. Groups of Atlantic salmon parr were injected intraperitoneally with oil-adjuvanted vaccines containing either high or low concentrations of Aeromonas salmonicida or Moritella viscosa antigens in order to induce polarized (severe and mild) granulomatous reactions. The established granulomatous reactions were confirmed by gross and histological methods at 3 months post vaccination when responses were known to have matured. The corresponding gene expression patterns in the head kidneys were profiled using salmonid cDNA microarrays followed by validation by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). qPCR was also used to examine the expression of additional genes known to be important in the adaptive immune response. Results Granulomatous lesions were observed in all vaccinated fish. The presence of severe granulomas was associated with a profile of up-regulation of innate immunity-related genes such as complement factors C 1 q and C 6, mannose binding protein, lysozyme C, C-type lectin receptor, CD 209, Cathepsin D, CD 63, LECT- 2, CC chemokine and metallothionein. In addition, TGF-β (p = 0. 001), IL- 17 A (p = 0. 007) and its receptor (IL- 17 AR) (p = 0. 009) representing T H 17 were significantly up-regulated in the group with severe granulomas as were arginase and IgM. None of the genes directly reflective of T H 1 T cell lineage (IFN-γ, CD 4) or T H 2 (GATA- 3) responses were differentially expressed. Conclusions Granulomatous reactions following vaccination with <b>oil-based</b> <b>vaccines</b> in Atlantic salmon have the profile of strong expression of genes related to innate immune responses. The expression of TGF-β, IL- 17 A and its receptor suggests an involvement of T H 17 T cell lineage and is in conformity with strong infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages into inflamed areas. Arginase upregulation shows that macrophages in these reactions are alternatively activated, indicating also a T H 2 -profile. To what extent the expression of IL- 17 A and its receptor reflects an autoimmune vaccine-based reaction remains elusive but would be in conformity with previous observations of autoimmune reactions in salmon when vaccinated with <b>oil-based</b> <b>vaccines.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{incidence}} of needlestick injuries in farmers and veterinary surgeons is significant {{and the consequences}} of such an injection can be serious. Case presentation We report accidental injection of bovine vaccine into the base of the little finger. This resulted in increased pressure in the flexor sheath causing signs and symptoms of ischemia. Amputation of the digit was required despite repeated surgical debridement and decompression. Conclusion There have been previous reports of injection of <b>oil-based</b> <b>vaccines</b> into the human hand resulting in granulomatous inflammation or sterile abscess and causing morbidity and tissue loss. Self-injection with veterinary vaccines is an occupational hazard for farmers and veterinary surgeons. Injection of vaccine into a closed compartment such as the human finger can have serious sequelae including loss of the injected digit. These injuries are not to be underestimated. Early debridement and irrigation of the injected area with decompression is likely to give the best outcome. Frequent review is necessary after the first procedure because repeat operations may be required. </p...|$|R
40|$|A {{tobacco mosaic}} virus (TMV) -based vector was {{utilized}} for {{expression of a}} cytosolic form of the bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BHV- 1) protein glycoprotein D (gDc). Nicotiana benthamiana plants were harvested 7 days after inoculation with RNA transcripts derived from the TMV-gDc recombinant virus. Recombinant gDc protein of expected electrophoretic mobility accumulated in inoculated leaves to a concentration of about 20 μg/g of fresh leaf tissue. <b>Oil-based</b> <b>vaccines</b> were formulated with crude foliar extracts to immunize mice parentally. After a single injection, animals developed a sustained and specific response to both the isolated gD and native virus particles. Cattle vaccinated with the same gDc containing extracts developed specific humoral and cellular immune responses directed against both the viral gD and BHV- 1 particles. Most importantly, animals vaccinated with the plant-produced gDc showed good levels of protection after challenge with the virulent BHV- 1. Virus excretion was drastically reduced in these animals, reaching levels comparable to animals vaccinated with a commercial BHV- 1 vaccine. The positive immunological characterization obtained for the gDc, indicated that {{an important part of}} the natural conformation was retained in the plant recombinant protein...|$|R
40|$|Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis [MAP], the Causative {{agent of}} enteric Johne's disease, incurs {{significant}} economic losses to the livestock industry. Prophylactic vaccination {{can be employed}} as a control means, however mineral <b>oil-based</b> <b>vaccines</b> Currently in practice have limited efficacy, produce strong antibody responses that confound serological diagnostic testing, and cause severe injection site reactions. In the present study, the safety and efficacy of a commercial mineral oil-adjuvanted vaccine (Gudair (TM)) was compared with novel parenteral-route vaccines in sheep: these comprised live or heat-killed (HK) whole cell preparations of MAP strain 316 F, formulated into a food-grade lipid vaccine delivery matrix. Subcutaneous administration of lipid-formulated live or I HK 316 F-induced significantly fewer adverse injection site reactions than Gudair (TM); adverse injection site reactions were eliminated altogether by intraperitoneal (i. p.) injection of lipid-formulated live 316 F Injections of lipid-formulated 316 F-induced significant peripheral blood cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses {{in the absence of}} antibody, while Gudair (TM) -induced strong antibody and CMI reactivity. Vaccinated and non-vaccinated control sheep were challenged via oral inoculation of a virulent MAP isolate, and disease progress was monitored for 16 months, followed by necropsy. All vaccine regimes reduced the overall pathological grading of biopsied intestinal tract (IT) tissues; among these, only Gudair (TM) promoted a significant reduction in the incidence of histopathological IT lesions, while only i. p. injection of lipid-formulated live 316 F significantly reduced the incidence of gross IT lesions. All lipid-formulated vaccines (but not Gudair (TM)) significantly reduced the incidence of bacteriological culture-confirmed MAP infection. This study identifies a new vaccination strategy against Johne's disease in sheep using conventional MAP vaccine strains formulated in a metabolisable lipid delivery matrix.

40|$|Avian Influenza (AI) {{has been}} {{recognized}} as a highly contagious and lethal generalized viral disease of birds. In this study, immune response of layers to the commercial oil based and liposomal vaccines of avian influenza H 7 was evaluated. Thirty commercial layers were divided into three groups, T 1, T 2 and T 3 with 10 birds in each group. Group T 1 served as control, Group T 2 was immunized with conventional AI <b>oil-based</b> <b>vaccines,</b> 0. 5 mL/bird and Group T 3 was immunized with AI Liposomal vaccines 0. 5 mL/bird through sub/cut injection. Blood samples were taken and sera were separated at day 0, 7, 14, 21, 28 and day 35. Each time at least 6 samples were taken for antibody titration through AGPT. The geometric mean titre (GMT) of birds in T 1, T 2 and T 3 was 4 ± 1. 02 at day 0. No significant difference was observed in the titres at day 0 in all the groups. The GMT (Geometric Mean Titer) of control group was 4 ± 1. 02 at day 7, 6. 79 ± 1. 02 at day 14 and 8 ± 1. 02 from day 21 to 35. The antibody titre increased slowly from 32 on day 7 to 630. 3 on day 35 in birds vaccinated with oil based vaccine, whereas a somewhat quick increase in immune response from 64 on day 7 to 891. 4 on day 35 was observed in birds vaccinated with liposomal vaccine. The results showed that immune response of layers in term of GMT was well established with AI liposomal vaccine as {{compared to that of}} oil based vaccine. The present study will be helpful in preventing the commercial losses of the farmers and preventing the flock mortality due to the high efficacy of liposomal vaccine against avian influenza...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to standardize the Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) for the assessment of serological response of vaccinated chicks with avian adenovirus- 4 (AA V- 4).

40|$|Abstract: Fresh {{garlic powder}} was {{evaluated}} for ability to potentiate the immune response of broiler chicks to Avian Influenza Virus (AIV) vaccine. For this purpose, 280 day-old chicks (Ross 308) were randomly allocated to 4 groups A, B (52 each) C and D (88 each). The birds in groups A and B were given control diet during the experiment, but those in groups C and D received diet supplemented with 1 and 3 % garlic powder, respectively. After 2 nd bleeding, {{half of the}} chicks in groups C and D were separated as groups E and F and fed control diet thereafter. On 9 th day of age, the chicks in all groups except A were immunized subcutaneously against AIV (subtype H N) with a commercial <b>oil-based</b> inactivated <b>vaccine</b> (Merial, France). 9 2 Fifteen chicks from each group were bled on days 14, 24 and 34 post vaccination and also 5 just before vaccination. The sera were used for antibody titration against AIV by both HI and ELISA tests. The results showed that antibody levels were considerably higher in the vaccinated chicks {{than those in the}} non-vaccinated control throughout the experimental period (p 0. 05). In addition, the removal of garlic from diet had no significant (p> 0. 05) effect on serum titer. It is suggested that diet supplementation with garlic powder can not stimulate the humoral response of chickens against AIV vaccine...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFoot-and-mouth disease (FMD) {{vaccination}} in Argentina is compulsory {{for most}} of the cattle population and conducted by certified veterinarians. This organized campaign may facilitate the controlled application of other vaccines against endemic diseases, provided immune responses against FMD are not hindered. There is no published information on the interference of immunity against FMD vaccines when applied together with a live bacterial vaccine. In this study we evaluated if the simultaneous application of a Bacillus anthracis live vaccine with a commercial tetravalent <b>oil-based</b> FMD <b>vaccine</b> (FMD-vac) used in Argentina, modifies the antibody booster responses against FMD virus (FMDV) in cattle. Two groups of 16 heifers with comparable liquid phase blocking ELISA (LPBE) titers were immunized with the FMD-vac alone or simultaneously with a commercial attenuated bovine anthrax Sterne strain vaccine (ABV). Serum samples were obtained at 0, 25, 60 and 90 days post vaccination (dpv) and specific antibodies against two FMDV vaccine strains were assessed by LPBE, avidity and IgG-isotype ELISAs. Bovines immunized with FMD-vac or FMDV-V+ABV responded with a boost in the LPBE antibody titers and avidity at 25 dpv, and remained within similar levels up {{to the end of the}} study. Animals vaccinated with FMD-vac+ABV had significantly higher LPBE titers at 25 dpv, compared to those immunized with FMD-vac alone; which was due to an increase in IgG 2 titers. Overall, antibody titers elicited in both groups were similar and followed comparable kinetics over time. We conclude that the simultaneous application of a live anthrax vaccine with the current FMD tetravalent vaccine used in Argentina in cattle previously immunized against FMD, did not counteract the serological response induced by FMD vaccination...|$|R
40|$|The H 9 N 2 subtype low {{pathogenic}} {{avian influenza}} {{is one of}} the most prevalent avian diseases worldwide, and was first documented in 1996 in Korea. This disease caused serious economic loss in Korea's poultry industry. In order to develop an <b>oil-based</b> inactivated <b>vaccine,</b> a virus that had been isolated in 2001 (A/chicken/Korea/ 01310 / 2001) was selected based on its pathogenic, antigenic, and genetic properties. However, in animal experiments, the efficacy of the vaccine was found to be very low without concentration of the antigen (2 7 to 2 10 hemagglutinin unit). In order to overcome the low productivity, we passaged the vaccine candidate virus to chicken eggs. After the 20 th passage, the virus was approximately ten times more productive compared with the parent virus. For the most part, the passaged virus maintained the hemagglutinin cleavage site amino acid motif (PATSGR/GLF) and had only three amino acid changes (T 133 N, V 216 G, E 439 D, H 3 numbering) in the hemagglutinin molecule, as well as 18 amino acid deletions (55 - 72) and one amino acid change (E 54 D) in the NA stalk region. The amino acid changes did not significantly affect the antigenicity of the vaccine virus when tested by hemagglutination inhibition assay. Though not complete, the vaccine produced after the 20 th passage of the virus (01310 CE 20) showed good protection against a homologous and recent Korean isolate (A/chicken/Korea/Q 30 / 2004) in specific pathogen- free chickens. The vaccine developed in this study would be helpful for controlling the H 9 N 2 LPAI in Korea...|$|R
