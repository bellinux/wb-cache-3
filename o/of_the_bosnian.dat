5|$|Catherine of Bosnia (/Катарина Косача; 1424/1425 – 25 October 1478) was Queen of Bosnia as {{the wife}} of King Stephen Thomas, the {{penultimate}} Bosnian sovereign. She was born into the powerful House of Kosača, staunch supporters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> Church. Her marriage in 1446 was arranged to bring peace between the King and her father, Stjepan Vukčić. The queenship of Catherine, who at that point embraced Roman Catholicism, was marked with an energetic construction of churches throughout the country.|$|E
5|$|During the Siege of Sarajevo, Igman {{became part}} of the buffer zone between the belligerents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> {{government}} and the Army of Republika Srpska. The area around the ski jumping hill saw heavy fighting during the civil war and was also used for executions by the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH). Since, the structures have been littered with bullet holes. With the war, the hills were no longer able to be used.|$|E

25|$|The Ottoman Empire first reached Bosnia in 1388 {{where they}} were {{defeated}} by <b>Bosnian</b> forces in <b>the</b> Battle <b>of</b> Bileća and then was forced to retreat. After <b>the</b> fall <b>of</b> Serbia in 1389 Battle <b>of</b> Kosovo, where <b>the</b> <b>Bosnians</b> participated through Vlatko Vuković, the Turks began various offensives against <b>the</b> Kingdom <b>of</b> Bosnia. <b>The</b> <b>Bosnians</b> defended themselves but without much success. <b>The</b> <b>Bosnians</b> resisted strongly in <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> Royal castle <b>of</b> Jajce (<b>the</b> siege <b>of</b> Jajce), where <b>the</b> last <b>Bosnian</b> king Stjepan Tomašević tried to repel the Turks. The Ottoman army conquered Jajce {{after a few months}} in 1463 and executed <b>the</b> last King <b>of</b> Bosnia, ending Medieval Bosnia.|$|R

5|$|In 926, Simeon's troops under Alogobotur invaded Croatia, at {{the time}} a Byzantine ally, but were {{completely}} defeated by the army of King Tomislav in the Battle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> Highlands.

In the last months of his life, Simeon prepared for another conflict with Constantinople despite Romanos' desperate pleas for peace.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about Catherine's premarital life. The {{earliest}} source that mentions her is the will of her maternal great-grandmother Jelena Lazarević, dated 25 November 1442, in which she left her her gold earrings and a snake-shaped bracelet. Stjepan was a member and significant supporter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> Church, while her mother was an Eastern Orthodox Christian; Catherine was raised in her father's confession.|$|E
50|$|As <b>the</b> {{capital city}} <b>of</b> Bosnia and Herzegovina, Sarajevo {{was a central}} zone <b>of</b> {{conflict}} during <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> War. <b>The</b> <b>Bosnian</b> Serb Army deployed troops and artillery in the surrounding hills, and on 2 May 1992 began imposing a blockade on all traffic in and out the city, starting {{what was to be}} known as <b>the</b> siege <b>of</b> Sarajevo. <b>The</b> <b>Bosnian</b> Serb Army constantly bombarded the civilian population in the city in an effort to prevent the home army from deploying. It has been estimated that on an average day more than 300 shell rounds were fired into the city.|$|R

5|$|Operation Sana, {{as well as}} Operation Maestral 2, {{were crucial}} in {{applying}} pressure on the VRS in the final weeks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> War. A Central Intelligence Agency analysis comparing the effects of Operation Deliberate Force, Sana and Maestral 2 on the VRS noted that the NATO campaign did not degrade the combat capability of the VRS as much as was initially assumed, because the airstrikes were never primarily directed at field-deployed units, rather they targeted the command and control infrastructure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> Serb military. The analysis concluded that, while NATO degraded {{the capabilities of the}} VRS, the final HV, HVO and ARBiH offensives inflicted the most damage. It further noted that those offensives, rather than the NATO bombing, were responsible for bringing the Bosnian Serbs to the negotiating table and ending the war. Author Robert C. Owen argues that the HV, HVO and ARBiH would not have advanced as rapidly as they did had NATO not intervened and denied the VRS its long-range communications.|$|E
5|$|The 1995 NATO {{bombing of}} Bosnia and Herzegovina {{targeted}} the Bosnian Serb Army and together with international pressure {{led to the}} resolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> War and {{the signing of the}} Dayton Agreement in 1995. Since then, NATO has led the Implementation Force and Stabilization Force, and other peacekeeping efforts in the country. Bosnia and Herzegovina joined the Partnership for Peace in 2006, and signed an agreement on security cooperation in March 2007.|$|E
5|$|The book praises Dallaire's {{commitment}} to his peacekeeping mission, but {{is critical of}} MacKenzie, who is depicted as being ignorant <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> political situation. In response to Off's portrayal of him, MacKenzie considered suing for libel, but opted not to. The book praises Arbour's efforts at building the legitimacy of International Criminal Tribunals and her efforts in indicting alleged war criminals from the massacres in Rwanda and Bosnia. Through these biographies, the book addresses themes of morality and UN effectiveness.|$|E

The headquarters became partially operational on 7 October. <b>The</b> <b>Bosnians</b> did not leave Bácska immediately, and {{for a short period}} were garrisoned alongside Lombard's new 31st SS Volunteer Grenadier Division. In the meantime, the Red Army continued to advance into Hungary, and on 9 October 1944 a telegram was sent by <b>the</b> commander <b>of</b> Waffen-SS forces in Hungary to IX SS Mountain Corps in Bosnia announcing that [...] "battle ready units from SS Oberführer Lombard's division and <b>Bosnians</b> from <b>the</b> Division Kama had been thrown into the fighting in Bacska". <b>The</b> <b>Bosnian</b> elements were deployed along the Tisza (...) river for a week or so as part of Kampfgruppe Syr in an attempt to slow the Soviet advance.

2500|$|The larger HVO {{offensive}} on Jablanica {{had already}} started on 15 April [...] 1993.

At least 400 Bosnian Muslim civilians were detained and the HVO advance towards Jablanica was halted after a cease-fire agreement was negotiated.|$|R
5|$|The offensive, {{together}} with Operation Sana, caused controversy among military analysts regarding {{the issue of}} whether NATO airstrikes or the two ground offensives contributed more towards the resolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> War, and to what extent ARBiH, HVO and HV advances were helped by, or conversely the VRS hampered by, NATO bombing. In 2011, five former Croatian military personnel were convicted of war crimes for the summary execution of five Bosnian Serb soldiers and an unknown civilian during the offensive.|$|E
5|$|The {{operations}} of Deny Flight spanned {{more than two}} years <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> War and {{played an important role in}} the course of that conflict. The no-fly zone {{operations of}} Deny Flight proved successful in preventing significant use of air power by any side in the conflict. Additionally, the air strikes flown during Deny Flight led to Operation Deliberate Force, a massive NATO bombing campaign in Bosnia that played a key role in ending the war.|$|E

At about that time, likely in order to allow for a peaceful solution to his protracted war with the magnate Stjepan Vukčić Kosača, King Thomas requested from Pope Eugene IV an annulment of his union with Stephen's mother. Open warfare ended in 1446 with the marriage of Stephen's father to Kosača's daughter Catherine, by whom Stephen had a half-brother named Sigismund and a half-sister named Catherine.|$|E
5|$|Operation Mistral 2, officially codenamed Operation Maestral 2, was a Croatian Army (Hrvatska vojska – HV) and Croatian Defence Council (Hrvatsko vijeće obrane – HVO) {{offensive}} in western Bosnia and Herzegovina on 8–15 September 1995 as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> War.
