40|$|T H E use {{of calcium}} in <b>obliterative</b> <b>vascular</b> <b>diseases</b> {{is not a}} radically new departure. Its use in these conditions, by the venous route, has not to my {{knowledge}} been previously reported. Bernheim and London 4 have ad-ministered calcium orally in some cases and have reported some success in spastic conditions. The mode of action has, however, not been adequately explained. In order to reduce to a minimum the amount of fluid used in saline therapy of obliterative arterial diseases, calcium gluconate was employed, in 10 per cent solution, in amounts of either 10 or 20 cubic centimeters. This was substituted for the 300 cubic centimeters of 5 per cent sodium chloride solution commonly used in some clinics for peripheral arterial dis-ease. The idea was to find out, if possible, whether a salt, per se, exercised the main effect or whether a relatively large amount of fluid played any im-portant part in the results obtained. A report on this point will be made in the near future...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesIn {{response}} to injury, aging mediates exaggerated neointimal formation, the pathologic hallmark of <b>obliterative</b> <b>vascular</b> <b>diseases.</b> We assessed {{the development of}} neointima in a model of mechanical vascular injury in aging mice (18 months old) and young mice (2 months old). To investigate the mechanisms by which aging affects neointimal formation, we also carried out a set of in vitro studies to characterize the biologic properties of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) derived from aging and young mice. MethodsAging and young mice were subjected to wire injury to the carotid artery. Four weeks later injured arteries were harvested, and neointimal formation was histologically assessed. The profiles of angiogenesis-related genes between aortic VSMCs derived from aging and young mice were compared with complementary DNA arrays. Expression of platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α (PDGFR-α) and proliferation in {{response to}} platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) by VSMCs were assessed. Susceptibility to apoptosis in aging and young VSMCs in response to nitric oxide and serum starvation was investigated. In addition, the level of apoptosis in neointimal VSMCs (by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling assay) was compared between aging and young animals. ResultsWhen compared with young mice, aging mice exhibited exaggerated neointimal formation (intima-media ratio, 1. 17 ± 0. 57 vs 0. 49 ± 0. 16; P <. 0001). Aging VSMCs expressed higher levels of PDGFR-α (12. 0 % ± 2. 7 % vs 3. 2 ± 0. 67 %; P =. 034) and greater proliferative response (4 -fold increase) to PDGF-BB, compared with young VSMCs. However, aging VSMCs were less susceptible to apoptosis when subjected to serum starvation (75 % less) and exposure to nitric oxide (50 % less). Furthermore, there was more apoptosis in the neointima of young arteries than in their aging counterparts (8. 75 % ± 3. 3 % vs 2. 8 % ± 1. 9; P =. 021). ConclusionsAge-dependent increases in PDGFR-α may alter VSMC proliferation, and when coupled with resistance to apoptosis could contribute to exaggerated neointima formation in aging animals. Of significance, our findings in the mouse will enable application of abundant molecular tools afforded by this species to further dissect the mechanisms of exaggerated neointimal formation associated with aging. Clinical relevanceNeointimal formation is the pathologic hallmark of <b>obliterative</b> <b>vascular</b> <b>diseases,</b> including primary atherosclerosis, post stent restenosis, graft occlusion after vascular bypass procedures, and transplant allograft vasculopathy. Aging is an independent risk factor for development of cardiovascular diseases, and aging exaggerates neointimal formation after vascular injury. Understanding the mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon may facilitate prevention or provide new therapies for <b>vascular</b> occlusive <b>diseases,</b> which are so prevalent in the aging population. Our ability to reproduce the model in the mouse will no doubt facilitate such understanding...|$|R
40|$|Twenty-four {{patients}} over 35 {{years of}} age with a secundum atrial septal defect (ASD) had a clinical and hemodynamic assessment prior to surgical closure and a follow-up assessment an average of 6 years afterward. All were initially in functional class III or IV. Twenty-three patients had a moderate to large left-to-right shunt. Five had elevated pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR); all had moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension. Left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) was found in 17. Following surgical closure, 22 patients showed sustained clinical improvement and were in class I or II. The mean pulmonary artery pressure fell to normal or mildly elevated values in 21. The PVR was now elevated in 14 patients, suggesting con-tinued progression of <b>obliterative</b> pulmonary <b>vascular</b> <b>disease.</b> Three had small resid-ual shunts.

Cases of ventricular septal defect showed an appreciable increase in muscularity of both preacinar and intra-acinar (respiratory unit) arteries, and intimal proliferation was infrequent and mild. By contrast, cases of transposition of the great arteries with ventricular septal defect and atrioventricular septal defect showed an increase in preacinar muscularity, a short heavily muscularised arterial segment containing intimal proliferation {{at the entrance to}} the acinus, whereas the intra-acinar arteries beyond showed only a moderate increase in muscularity. In these children who were less than 1 year of age an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance was due to strategically placed small areas of intimal proliferation and not to widespread <b>obliterative</b> pulmonary <b>vascular</b> <b>disease.</b> The study demonstrated and explained differences in the appearance of the peripheral pulmonary arteries in different types of congenital heart disease, which help interpret the findings of lung biopsies...|$|R

40|$|The hemodynamic and {{clinical}} responses to calcium channel blockade with verapamil and nifedipine {{were compared with}} those of hydralazine in 12 patients with pulmonary hypertension secondary to <b>obliterative</b> pulmonary <b>vascular</b> <b>disease.</b> All three drugs produced a marked and similar decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance; however, this was accompanied by a significant increase in cardiac index with hydralazine (+ 0. 71 liter/min per m 2, p < 0. 01), no change in cardiac index with nifedipine and a significant decrease in cardiac index with verapamil (− 0. 25 liter/min per m 2, p < 0. 05). Mean pulmonary artery pressure decreased markedly with both calcium channel blocking drugs (− 16. 0 mm Hg with verapamil and − 14. 5 mm Hg with nifedipine, both p < 0. 01), but this was associated with a concomitant increase in mean right atrial pressure (+ 6. 2 mm Hg with verapamil and + 4. 4 mm Hg with nifedipine, both p < 0. 01); neither variable changed after hydralazine. Hence, right ventricular performance (as reflected by right ventricular stroke work index) deteriorated during treatment with both calcium channel blocking drugs, despite the decrease in resistance to right ventricular ejection; in contrast, right ventricular stroke work index increased after hydralazine. The unfavorable hemodynamic effects of calcium channel blockade were accompanied by severe adverse clinical events, including profound hypotension and cardiogenic shock during acute drug administration and the exacerbation of right heart failure during long-term treatment. These deleterious responses to verapamil and nifedipine are likely the result of a direct depressant effect exerted by these drugs on right ventricular function independent of their pulmonary vasodilatory actions...|$|R

Medium and small coronary arteries and arterioles of both infarcted and noninfarcted hearts had focal degenerative lesions consisting of deposits of periodic-acid [...] Schiff (PAS) -positive or eosinophilic {{material in the}} intima {{and to a lesser}} extent in the media, degenerative changes in the media without accompanying cellular inflammation, and occasional proliferation or swelling of intimal cells. These lesions often narrowed and, together with platelet aggregation, occasionally occluded the vascular lumens. Granular deposits of mouse immunoglobulin, C 3, and occasionally gp 70 were present in the walls of medium and small arteries, arterioles, and venules of both infarcted and noninfarcted myocardium. Dense deposits of foreign material were found by electron microscopy in areas corresponding to the immune deposits. These findings are consistent with the interpretation that these noninflammatory vascular lesions are caused by local deposition of antigen [...] antibody complexes.

40|$|Hypertension {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{vascular}} risk factors, and is an important cause of development of different <b>vascular</b> <b>diseases.</b> The main aim of this thesis was to determine the burden of hypertension-associated <b>vascular</b> <b>diseases</b> and end-organ damage in patients with manifest <b>vascular</b> <b>disease.</b> Patients with manifest <b>vascular</b> <b>diseases</b> are at high risk for recurrent <b>vascular</b> <b>diseases.</b> We studied the effect of the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus on the occurrence of cardiovascular events in patients with hypertension and manifest <b>vascular</b> <b>disease,</b> as well as in patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease. The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome among these patients was higher compared to patients without <b>vascular</b> <b>diseases.</b> Hypertensive patients with the metabolic syndrome but without type 2 diabetes mellitus had a 41 % higher risk of vascular death and a 40 % higher risk of myocardial infarction and sudden death. Among patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease, patients with the metabolic syndrome had a 51 % higher risk of vascular events compared to patients without the metabolic syndrome. A decreasing body mass index during follow-up highly influenced the development and resolution of the metabolic syndrome. In the general population, renal mass and renal function are declining during life, and elevated blood pressure is generally associated with renal function decline. A considerable decline in renal function was present among patients with <b>vascular</b> <b>disease,</b> and blood pressure was a strong risk factor for renal function deterioration in patients with albuminuria and atherosclerotic <b>vascular</b> <b>disease.</b> When separate and combined effects of decreased renal function and albuminuria on the occurrence of <b>vascular</b> <b>diseases</b> and mortality were investigated in patients with manifest <b>vascular</b> <b>disease,</b> the combination of decreased renal function and albuminuria accounted for a 2. 27 -fold increased risk of vascular events. When albuminuria or decreased renal function were present, this risk was only moderately increased. Vascular risk factors including elevated blood pressure have been identified as risk factors for cerebral white matter lesions (WML) and cerebral atrophy. Among patients with manifest <b>vascular</b> <b>disease,</b> blood pressure was not associated with the presence of WML, irrespective of the presence of diabetes or the localization of <b>vascular</b> <b>disease.</b> Also no association was present between blood pressure and the progression of cerebral atrophy. However, the magnitude of changes in brain tissue volume and ventricular volume in patients with <b>vascular</b> <b>disease</b> was comparable to the physiological changes described in healthy populations at a much higher age. In the last part of this thesis, we examined time trends in vascular risk factors and medication use in patients referred to a vascular specialist with manifest <b>vascular</b> <b>disease</b> or type 2 diabetes mellitus in the period of 1996 to 2007. From 1996 to 2007, the prevalence of obesity increased from 14 % to 24 %, and no change in smoking behaviour was observed. The prevalence of elevated cholesterol levels and elevated blood pressure declined during the observation period while the use of lipid-lowering, blood pressure-lowering and antithrombotic medication at referral increased...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: There is {{increasing}} evidence that <b>vascular</b> <b>disease</b> contributes to cognitive impairment and dementia. Clarification {{of the role}} of vascular risk factors in dementia is important because most are modifiable, in contrast to other risk factors such as age and genetics. METHODS: In 428 patients with mental illness we have investigated the relation of <b>vascular</b> <b>disease</b> to diagnoses, and a biochemical parameter, C-reactive protein (CRP), which is associated with inflammation and <b>vascular</b> <b>disease.</b> RESULTS: Patients with <b>vascular</b> <b>disease</b> showed higher CRP levels than patients without <b>vascular</b> <b>disease.</b> Furthermore, patients with Alzheimer's disease showed lower CRP levels than patients with vascular dementia, mild cognitive impairment or depression. There is no obvious reason for this finding, since it could not be attributed to drug treatment. CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that the control of conventional vascular risk factors and therapy could be guided by the level of CRP...|$|R
