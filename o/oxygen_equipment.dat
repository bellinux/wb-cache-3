25|$|Like the 1922 {{expedition}}, the 1924 expedition {{also brought}} bottled oxygen to the mountain. The <b>oxygen</b> <b>equipment</b> had been improved {{during the two}} intervening years, but was still not very reliable. Also {{there was no real}} clear agreement whether to use this assistance at all. It was the start of a discussion which still lasts today: the “sporting” arguments intend to climb Everest “by fair means” without the technical measure which reduces the effects of high altitude by a couple thousand metres.|$|E
25|$|The {{cantilever}} gulled wings followed {{normal practice}} with a plywood-covered torsion box leading edge, mainspar, ribs and false rear spar {{to support the}} full-span flaps and ailerons. DFS-style airbrakes were fitted {{at the rear of}} the mainspar with the upper plates hinging forwards and the lower plates hinging rearwards. A comprehensive instrument panel was fitted in the cockpit which included:-A large plaque on the instrument panel; AirSpeed Indicator (8), Vertical Speed Indicator to 5m/s, Vertical Speed Indicator to 15m/s, an artificial horizon with slip ball, altimeter, longitudinal clinometer, stopwatch, compass and oxygen pressure gauge (<b>oxygen</b> <b>equipment</b> was housed behind the pilots seat).|$|E
25|$|The {{expedition}} {{made two}} unsuccessful attempts {{on the summit}} in early June, and there was time for one more before the heavy snowfall {{that came with the}} summer monsoon would make climbing too dangerous. This last chance fell to the expedition's most experienced climber, George Mallory. To the surprise of other expedition members, Mallory chose the 22-year-old inexperienced Irvine above the older, more seasoned climber, Noel Odell. Irvine's proficiency with the <b>oxygen</b> <b>equipment</b> was obviously a major factor in Mallory's decision, but there has been some debate ever since about the precise reasons for his choice.|$|E

25|$|Odell {{discovered}} {{the first evidence}} which might reveal something about the climb of Mallory and Irvine among the equipment in camps V and VI. In addition to Mallory's compass, which normally was a critical component for climbing activities, he discovered some oxygen bottles and spare parts. This situation suggests {{the possibility that there}} had been a problem with the <b>oxygen</b> <b>equipment</b> which might have caused a delayed start in the morning. A hand-generator electric lamp also remained in the tent – it was still in working order when it was found by the Ruttledge expedition nine years later.|$|E
500|$|In 1956, the air force, in {{an effort}} to gain {{political}} support, planned a record flight from Córdoba to Buenos Aires to demonstrate the combat potential of the IAe 33. [...] The Pulqui II would fly 800km, strafe an air force practice range in the Buenos Aires area, and then return to Córdoba using only internal fuel. The only <b>oxygen</b> <b>equipment</b> available for such a long flight was scrounged from a FMA Meteor under repairs. Lt. Balado successfully completed the flight (including the strafing demonstration) at an average cruise speed of around 900km/h, but the oxygen system failed on the return leg. The semi-conscious pilot managed to perform an emergency landing at high speed, but the heavy landing and resulting stress broke the landing gear, with the Pulqui II overrunning the end of the runway, the aircraft being damaged beyond repair.|$|E
500|$|A final {{alteration}} was to fit {{a simpler}} shutter (radiator vent) which had the object of warming the cockpit by directing heat from the engine. For McCudden this aspect was very important. At high altitude McCudden was to spend {{long periods of time}} in an extremely chilly environment. Operating the D.H.2 in 1916, he suffered terrible agonies as adequate blood circulation returned to his muscles once he reached [...] McCudden reported few general side-effects from high flight. Dizziness was a feature but he put this down to the cold rather than any form of anoxia. High altitude oxygen was too thin for humans which induced breathlessness. Aviation medicine was still in its infancy meaning pilots were left to solve operational problems themselves. Only the high-altitude bombers were equipped with <b>oxygen</b> <b>equipment</b> to assist with breathing. Despite his circulation difficulties, McCudden proved remarkably resistant to the effects of high altitude flying without oxygen.|$|E

2500|$|The next {{expedition}} was in 1924. The initial {{attempt by}} Mallory and Geoffrey Bruce was aborted when weather conditions prevented {{the establishment of}} CampVI.

40|$|Background: Using pure oxygen (PO) in {{neonatal}} resuscitation increases oxidative stress and mortality in full-term hypoxic infants. International {{neonatal resuscitation}} guidelines recommend air or blended oxygen for resuscitation regardless of gestational age but this requires education and equipment {{that may not}} be globally available. Objective: To determine current neonatal resuscitation practices and availability of <b>oxygen</b> blending <b>equipment</b> in non-Western hospitals. Design: 196 email addresses were obtained through perinatal societies representing 45 hospitals in 14 countries in Asia, Africa and the Middle East. Results: 68 (34. 6 %) responses were received from all 14 countries. The majority (90 %, n = 61) of respondents were aware of recent guideline changes but continued to resuscitate with PO {{because of the lack of}} equipment and uncertainty about international guidelines (61 %, n = 41 for term, 44 %, n = 30 for preterm). Most (81 %, n = 55) believed that PO caused adverse effects in term neonates. The availability of <b>oxygen</b> blending <b>equipment</b> correlated significantly with the country's gross domestic product. Conclusion: The majority of the practitioners we surveyed in non-Western countries are aware of the most recent recommendations regarding oxygen use in neonatal resuscitation. However, lack of <b>oxygen</b> blending <b>equipment</b> remains a hindrance to the use of blended gas at resuscitation in low resource, non-western countries. Global guidelines from developed countries must take into account the resource limitations and implementation difficulties faced by countries with restricted resources, where the majority of the high-risk infants are born...|$|R
2500|$|The {{new members}} of the {{climbing}} team included Noel Odell, Bentley Beetham and John de Vars Hazard. Andrew [...] "Sandy" [...] Irvine, an engineering student whom Odell knew from an expedition to Spitsbergen, was a so-called [...] "experiment" [...] for the team and a test for “young blood” {{on the slopes of}} Mount Everest. Due to his technical and mechanical expertise, Irvine was able to enhance the capacities of the <b>oxygen</b> <b>equipment,</b> to decrease the weight, and to perform numerous repairs to it and other expedition equipment.|$|E
2500|$|On 5 June Mallory and Irvine were in Camp IV. Mallory {{spoke with}} Norton about his {{selection}} of Sandy Irvine as his climbing partner. Since Norton was the expedition leader after the illness of Bruce, and Mallory {{was the chief}} climber, {{he decided not to}} challenge Mallory’s plan, in spite of Irvine's inexperience in high-altitude climbing. [...] Irvine was not chosen primarily for his climbing abilities. Rather it was due to his practical skill with the <b>oxygen</b> <b>equipment.</b> Mallory and Irvine had also become fast friends since they shared a lot of time aboard ship to India, and Mallory considered the personable 22-year-old as “strong as an ox.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The most {{remarkable}} finding was {{the corpse of}} George Leigh Mallory at a height of [...] The lack of extreme injuries indicated he had not tumbled very far. His waist showed severe rope-jerk mottling, showing the two had been roped when they fell. Mallory's injuries were such that a walking descent was impossible: his right foot was nearly broken off {{and there was a}} golf ball-sized puncture wound in his forehead. Even though his unbroken leg was on top of the broken one, as if to protect it, Mass. General Hospital neurosurgeon Dr. Elliot Schwamm believes it not possible that he would have been conscious after the forehead injury. There was no <b>oxygen</b> <b>equipment</b> near the body, but the oxygen bottles would have been empty by that time and discarded at a higher altitude to relinquish the heavy load. Mallory was not wearing snow goggles, although a pair was stored in his vest, which may indicate that he was on the way back by night. However, a contemporary photograph shows he had two sets of goggles when he started his summit climb. The image of his wife Ruth which he intended to put on the summit was not in his vest. He carried the picture throughout the whole expedition—a sign that he might have reached the top. Since his Kodak pocket camera was not found, there is no proof of a successful climb to the summit.|$|E
50|$|Typically, a frogman with {{closed circuit}} <b>oxygen</b> {{rebreathing}} <b>equipment</b> will stay within a depth limit of 20 ft with limited deeper excursions {{to a maximum}} of 50 ft because of the risk of seizure due to acute oxygen toxicity. The use of nitrox or mixed gas rebreathers can extend this depth range considerably, but this may be beyond the scope of operations, depending on the unit.|$|R
