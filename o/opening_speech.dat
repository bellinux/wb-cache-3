Diefenbaker pledged to reduce taxes and castigated the Liberals for not reducing taxes despite the government surplus. St. Laurent also addressed tax policy in his <b>opening</b> <b>speech,</b> in Winnipeg. St. Laurent noted that since 1953, tax rates had declined, as had the national debt, and that Canada had a reputation as a good place for investments. The Prime Minister argued that the cost of campaign promises made by the Progressive Conservatives would inevitably drive up the tax rate. Diefenbaker also assailed tight-money monetary policies which kept interest rates high, complaining that they were hitting Atlantic and Western Canada hard.|$|E

25|$|The quorum for a Parliamentary sitting is {{one quarter}} {{of the total number of}} MPs, not {{including}} the Speaker. An MP begins a debate by moving a motion and delivering an <b>opening</b> <b>speech</b> explaining the reasons for the motion. The Speaker (or chairman, if Parliament is in committee) then puts the motion in the form of a question, following which other MPs may debate the motion. After that, the mover may exercise a right of reply. When the debate is closed, the Speaker puts the question on the motion to the House and calls for a vote. Voting is generally done verbally, and whether the motion is carried depends on the Speaker's personal assessment of whether more MPs have voted for than against the motion. MPs' votes are only formally counted if an MP claims a division.|$|E
25|$|In 1988, Kleinrock chaired a {{group which}} {{produced}} the report Toward a National Research Network.

Indeed, funding for the development of Mosaic in 1993, the World Wide Web browser which is often credited as leading to the Internet boom during the mid-1990s, came from the High-Performance Computing and Communications Initiative, a program created by the High Performance Computing Act of 1991., On January 11, 1994, as Vice-President, Gore gave the <b>opening</b> <b>speech</b> for The Superhighway Summit held at UCLA's Royce Hall.

25|$|Ion Petrovici's <b>opening</b> <b>speech</b> to the Romanian Academy in 1935 had Philippide as its theme. During the Communist period, Iordan {{published}} a biography in 1969.

Next came by a volume of studies that appeared in 1983 {{on the occasion of the}} semicentennial of his death, by a volume of his works the following year, and by a 1986 book recording dialogues with his contemporaries. Carmen-Gabriela Pamfil authored a 2008 biography in preparation for the 150th anniversary of Philippide's birth. In 2011, his edited course materials were {{published a}}s Istoria limbii române ("The History of the Romanian Language").

25|$|Urechia was {{vice-president}} of the Senate in 1896-1897. During those years, he became Chevalier of the Légion d'honneur, honorary member and later honorary {{president of the}} Conseil Héraldique de France, foreign member of the French Archaeological Society, and associate member of the Spanish Red Cross, and Ecuador's consul general to Romania. Attending the October 1899 International Congress of Orientalists in Rome, he organized a Pan-Latinist festivity centered on Trajan's Column, with the participation of Luigi Pelloux cabinet ministers and the Transylvanian peasant activist Badea Cârţan. Although the ceremony enjoyed popularity and coverage in the press, Urechia and his Cultural League were frustrated by lack of funds {{in their attempt to}} organize a living exhibit of Romanian customs. He attended the 1900 congress of the Union of Latin Students, meeting in the French town of Alès, and delivered an <b>opening</b> <b>speech</b> in which the main theme was Pan-Latinism. The same year, he published a series of memoirs and travel writing pieces, under the title Din tainele vieţii ("Some of Life's Secrets").|$|E
25|$|At the plenary sessions, {{addresses}} {{were made}} by the chairman of the year's annual meetings, as well as the heads of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank at SSICEC. The three parties stressed the need for the World Trade Organization's Doha Round talks to resume. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said that the impasse in the Doha Round of trade negotiations carries a heavy cost and a high risk, and will extend beyond economics. Lee added that good governance is the key to help economies to open up in the era of globalisation and improve the lives for the people. He also outlined the roles of a good government in managing the process of changes. Lee said that governments must win the support of globalisation from the people and give them better opportunities. At the <b>opening</b> <b>speech</b> of IMF managing director Rodrigo de Rato said the world leaders must quickly revive the Doha Round of trade talks to prevent a damaging shift towards protectionism. De Rato also said that the world is having a period of high growth and low inflation unseen since the 1960s, and a solid growth in the economy could be expected in the following year. He added that the global growth cycle may turn and the best hope for good performance lies in further increase in international trade. The three risks to world economic prospects include rising oil prices, disorderly unwinding of global payments imbalances, and the prevention of trade. World Bank president Paul Wolfowitz told donor countries to increase aid to poor nations, and wealthy nations to put Africa as the top of the priority list of poverty fighting.|$|E

Svinhufvud's parliamentary <b>opening</b> <b>speeches,</b> in which he laid emphasis on legality, led to the Tsar dissolving Parliament in both 1909 and 1910. He served as Speaker until 1912.
