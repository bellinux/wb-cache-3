5|$|Later, {{when they}} gather to congratulate {{the bride and}} groom, the friends joke {{that they should be}} able to kiss the bride. The husband says that anybody who wants to kiss the bride has to kiss him like that first. Ching-teng grabs the groom and pushes him <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> kissing him like he would kiss Chia-yi. During their kiss, he remembers how he regrets their fight from years ago, and what could have {{happened}} had he apologized for being childish.|$|E
5|$|One further {{variation}} {{places a}} 6-sided die (although other sided die {{could also be}} used) {{on top of the}} bottle. If the bottle is knocked over and the die knocked <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> the player is awarded points equal to whatever side of the die lies facing upward when the die comes to a stop. This adds a random effect to hitting the bottle and in practice often results in players only striking the bottle in combination with other point-scoring shots.|$|E
5|$|Randy Savage, who {{continued}} to sell his supposedly injured leg, lost the title to Ric Flair at a television taping on September 1, 1992 in Hershey, Pennsylvania. During the match Flair received help not only from Mr Perfect but also from newcomer Razor Ramon, igniting a feud between Savage and Ramon. Bret Hart claimed in a 2014 interview that WWF owner Vince McMahon had worked out the title-change match with Flair and Savage before hand, {{and that he was}} angry when they returned to the dressing room after the match because they had failed to do much of what was agreed upon. McMahon was that angry that he actually made them go straight back out and re-do the whole match. After producing much the same match that they had immediately prior, McMahon allegedly threw his headset <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> and stormed off in frustration.|$|E

5|$|The second chorus has {{the girls}} {{dancing on the}} table, {{knocking}} several pieces of food and tuppleware onto the ground. A-Chan is seen lying down on a pillow, whilst Kashiyuka balances a book and an apple on her head. Both of these scenes have them throwing several pieces of food <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> Nocchi is seen at the dining table, holding a fork and listen to music through her headphones. She witnesses a small door underneath a stool, opens it, and sees a small green room. In the room, a blurred image of a cup starts to become clear, and holds small candy. As the girls eat the pieces of candy, their cream-coloured dresses turn into the outfits from the cover sleeve from the single. The girls start dancing in the fish bowl, surrounded by glittery lights. The final scene has the girls looking through the small door again, only to witness {{the dining room table}} empty; the small cup with candy appears in beige colouring rather than full-on vibrancy.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} from Raw was a Last Man Standing match, where {{the goal is}} to {{incapacitate}} the opponent long enough for a 10-count. In his third match of the night, Triple H defended his WWE Championship against Randy Orton. Both men fought extensively outside the ring, both taking advantage of the match stipulations, where there are no countouts or disqualifications. At one point, both men were positioned on top of one of the broadcast tables, where Orton attempted an RKO on Triple H, who countered the move and sent Orton through another of the broadcast tables. Triple H followed this by striking Orton with the steel steps. The men returned to the ring, and Orton performed a DDT and an RKO on Triple H, both onto a steel chair. The competitors returned to the outside of the ring again, and Triple H struck Orton with a chair. They returned {{to the top of the}} broadcast table, and Triple H attempted a Pedigree through the table on Orton, who countered into an RKO <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> The referee began a count and reached ten before Triple H could rise; in result, Orton won the match and subsequently regained the WWE Championship.|$|E

Only his officers' assurances that the lamp had dropped by accident persuaded him to stay his hand and thus saved the château from a second burning.|$|E
25|$|Grissom and {{his team}} found the washed-up rock star dead in his kitchen in the episode Built to Kill, Part 2. His body was sprawled {{in a chair and}} leaning {{forwards}} <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> They determined that {{the cause of death was}} a single blow delivered to the back of a head with a rolling pin. The first miniature was found close by. It was a perfect diorama of the kitchen, and even included objects in the garbage and placement of Delancy's blood. In the model they also found a picture of a bloodied doll, hidden behind a mini photo frame, and a bleach container in the miniature garbage.|$|E
25|$|The fourth {{match was}} a Double Dog Collar match between The Nasty Boys (Brian Knobs and Jerry Sags) and Public Enemy (Rocco Rock and Johnny Grunge). Rock was {{connected}} to Sags, and Grunge {{was connected to}} Knobs. All four fought to the outside, and used several weapons on each other. Grunge performed a bulldog on Knobs on a steel chair. Rock performed a somersault legdrop on Sags and performed an axe handle to him through a table. All four eventually return to the ring, where The Public Enemy had the advantage. Rock went to the top turnbuckle, but Sags pulled the chain, and Rock fell <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> Knobs repeatedly attacked Grunge with the chain. Sags then hit an axe handle with the chain on Rock, who was on a table. Knobs hanged Grunge with the chain over the top rope as The Nasty Boys delivered a clothesline to Rock with the chain. Sags hit Rock with the chain, and pinned him for The Nasty Boys to win.|$|E

25|$|Composition on <b>the</b> <b>Table</b> (1998/99) {{comprises}} {{four white}} tables bearing physical interface components: switches, dials, and turntables. Computer graphics images are projected <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>tables</b> from ceiling-mounted video projectors, and loudspeakers are present. As the audience manipulates the interface elements, graphical and audio changes {{take place in}} a way that is intimately connected to the audience's input. The objective of this work was to create a mixed reality environment where multiple participants could create visuals and music together. Elements of this work are recognizable in Iwai's Nintendo DS videogame Electroplankton. The piece was presented as part of the Art Gallery at SIGGRAPH'99, Los Angeles.|$|R

[...] Levi Hunt of IGN gave it a 6.8 and said, [...] "Jorge Molina's art is once again the best thing about A-Force as the series hits its least narratively satisfying issue. The underserved nature of the book’s development has led to a conflict that has few real emotional stakes." [...] David Pepose of Newsarama gave it a 7 saying, [...] "It's a good thing this book looks so good, because the plot definitely feels flat, with the reveal of A-Force's traitor - and her endgame after being easily overcome - feels particularly undercooked." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gregory Doran's 2003 RSC {{production}} at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, starring Alexandra Gilbreath and Jasper Britton. This production was presented with Fletcher's The Tamer Tamed as a two-part piece, with Gilbreath also playing Maria, Petruchio's second wife, in Tamer Tamed. This was the first recorded production of Shrew and Tamer Tamed as a two piece since the seventeenth century. The play subsequently moved to the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Britton played Petruchio not as a swaggering bully but as a shy and somewhat insecure individual deeply saddened by his father's death. When he first meets Katherina, she is in turmoil regarding the recent actions of her own father, and they recognise a kindred psychology in one another. Michael Billington wrote of the first meeting, [...] "I have never seen the scene more breathtakingly played: instead of barbaric knockabout, we see a damaged couple finding mutual support [...] in place of an offensive comedy about [...] "curative" [...] wife-taming, we see Kate trying to rescue a madman she genuinely loves." [...] Doran himself said of the play [...] "This is a play about love between two misfits, about their private relationship versus their public carapaces." [...] As such, Katherina here delivered her final speech with warmth and real affection for Petruchio, who admired her throughout. When she was finished, he emptied his bag of gold <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> {{and left the room}} with Katherina, not the gold.|$|E

2500|$|As the {{shooting}} continued outside, nurses and medics entered the building. [...] An unidentified soldier secured the south double doors with his ACU belt {{and rushed to}} help the wounded. According to the responding nurses, {{there was so much}} blood covering the floor inside the building, that they were unable to maintain balance, and had difficulty reaching the wounded to help them. In the area outside the building, Hasan continued to shoot at fleeing soldiers. [...] Herman Toro, Director of the Soldier Readiness Processing Site, arrived at this time. [...] Hasan had gone around the building and was out of sight, but still shooting. Toro and another site worker rushed to assist Lieutenant Colonel Juanita Warman who was down on the ground north of the medical building. [...] They both took her by the arms and tried to carry her to safety when Hasan returned and aimed his red laser across Toro's chest, but did not fire. [...] Toro took cover behind an electrical box and saw civilian police Sergeant Mark Todd arrive and shout commands at Hasan to surrender. Todd said: [...] "Then he turned and fired a couple of rounds at me. I didn't hear him say a word, he just turned and fired." [...] The two exchanged shots, and then Hasan's pistol was empty. [...] He stopped, turned and reached into his pocket for a new magazine and was felled by five shots from Todd, who ran over to him, kicked the pistol out of his hand and put handcuffs on him as he fell unconscious. LTC Tom Eberhart, Deputy Director of Human Resources, Fort Hood, arrived and entered the Medical Building to help. [...] He had to step over bodies to enter the building's north entrance. He assisted another soldier in performing CPR on one of the wounded soldiers at the building's waiting area. [...] Folding chairs were scattered all around. [...] He noticed a soldier outside the south doors of the building and went to help. [...] He had to remove the belt from the door and went outside as others were arriving. [...] The downed soldier was Staff Sergeant Alonzo Lunsford, a medical assistant from the building. [...] He had two wounds in the abdomen and a wound to the scalp. He was unconscious and LTC Eberhart went back into the building to retrieve a folding table. [...] Other soldiers assisted getting SSG Lunsford <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> and around the building to the triage area.|$|E
