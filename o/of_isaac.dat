5|$|In rabbinical tradition, the age <b>of</b> <b>Isaac</b> at {{the time}} of binding is taken to be 37, which {{contrasts}} with common portrayals <b>of</b> <b>Isaac</b> as a child. The rabbis also thought that the reason for the death of Sarah was the news of the intended sacrifice <b>of</b> <b>Isaac.</b> The sacrifice <b>of</b> <b>Isaac</b> is cited in appeals for the mercy of God in later Jewish traditions. The post-biblical Jewish interpretations often elaborate the role <b>of</b> <b>Isaac</b> beyond the biblical description and primarily focus on Abraham's intended sacrifice <b>of</b> <b>Isaac,</b> called the aqedah ("binding"). According to a version of these interpretations, Isaac died in the sacrifice and was revived. According to many accounts of Aggadah, unlike the Bible, it is Satan who is testing Isaac as an agent of God. Isaac's willingness to follow God's command at the cost of his death has been a model for many Jews who preferred martyrdom to violation of the Jewish law.|$|E
