5|$|Stanton {{wished for}} {{a greater degree of}} {{scholarship}} in The Woman's Bible, but was unable to convince Bible scholars <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>day</b> to take part in what was expected to be a controversial project. Scholars continued to avoid addressing the subject of sexism in the Bible until 1964 when Margaret Brackenbury Crook published Women and Religion, a study of the status of women in Judaism and Christianity. In her 1973 book Beyond God the Father, Mary Daly discussed The Woman's Bible, and subsequent works by Letty Russell and Phyllis Trible furthered the connection between feminism and the Bible. Today, biblical scholarship by women has come into maturity, with women posing new questions about the Bible, and challenging the very basis of biblical studies.|$|E

25|$|The Monitors {{inception}} was, in part, {{a response}} by Eddy to the journalism <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>day,</b> which relentlessly covered the sensations and scandals surrounding her new religion {{with varying degrees}} of accuracy. In addition, Joseph Pulitzer's New York World was consistently critical of Eddy, and this, along with a derogatory article in McClure's, furthered Eddy's decision to found her own media outlet.|$|E

25|$|Mrs Marshall's Cookery Book, {{published}} in 1888, endorsed serving {{ice cream in}} cones, but the idea definitely predated that.

25|$|She wrote comedies, fiction, and memoirs, while {{cultivating}} Voltaire, Diderot, and d'Alembert—all French encyclopedists, {{who later}} cemented her reputation in their writings.

A widow again by 1830, she had the freedom not routinely granted to married women <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>day</b> to transact business in her own name. She secured these rights through legal documents signed by her husband before his death.|$|E

25|$|The {{first modern}} sealing ship was the SS Bear, built in Dundee, Scotland in 1874 as a steamer for sealing.

Heavy-built with six inch (15.2cm) thick wooden planks, Bear was rigged as a sailing barquentine but her main power was a steam engine designed to smash deep into ice packs to reach seal herds.|$|E
