5|$|The site of North {{station has}} {{significantly}} changed. The ornate mausoleum of Sharif Al-Hussein Ben Ali (d.1998) stands directly opposite {{the remains of}} the platform. The operators of the Shia Islamic section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cemetery</b> have planted Leylandii along the boundary of their section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cemetery,</b> which includes the platform of North station. Unless the trees are removed, {{the remains of the}} station will ultimately become hidden and destroyed by overgrowth.|$|E
5|$|A stuccoed brick {{fence with}} cast iron gates and an iron Star of David enclose the cemetery. Within the walls, {{there are two}} main {{pathways}} which meet in the center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cemetery</b> at a circular decorative piece including a fountain. The oldest graves are in the northern half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cemetery</b> while newer graves were added progressively south. Many grave sites are adorned with well-maintained Victorian era funerary art, which gives the cemetery its historic significance. Among the monuments include the grave enclosure of the Winner family, which includes a bronze bust of Mark Winner, and two marble angels at the entrance of the plot. Other examples include the grave of David L. Rosenbaum, topped with marble shoes and stockings, the grave of Julius Elson, marked by a carved marble fainting couch, and a memorial to Mattimore Meyer, featuring a marble angel.|$|E

50|$|Parchman {{also has}} three cemeteries; {{prisoner}}s are buried on-site. A dead prisoner may {{be buried in}} one <b>of</b> two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cemeteries.</b> Hundreds <b>of</b> prisoners had been buried at two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cemeteries.</b>|$|R

In Australia's bicentennial year, 1988, a $16,000 grant was awarded for restoration {{work in the}} cemetery, at which time some broken gravestones were cemented together, and some illegible ones were 'cut back' and the letters repainted.|$|E
5|$|Stretford Cemetery was {{designed}} by John Shaw and opened in 1885. Its chapel is in the Decorated style, designed by architects Bellamy & Hardy, and quite elaborate.

5|$|The two {{stations}} in the cemetery were very similar in design. North station served the Nonconformist section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cemetery,</b> and South station served the Anglican section. On William Cubitt's advice the two {{stations in}} the cemetery were built as temporary structures, in the expectation that {{they would need to}} be rebuilt once the railway was operational and the issues with operating a railway of this unique nature became clearer. Other than brick platform faces, chimneys and foundations, the stations were built entirely of wood. Each station held first class and ordinary reception rooms for mourners, a first class and an ordinary refreshment room, and a set of apartments for LNC staff. To provide an attractive first view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cemetery</b> for visitors arriving at the stations, the areas around the stations and their associated chapels were planted with groves of bay, Cedar of Lebanon, rhododendron and Portuguese laurel.|$|E
5|$|A final wave of war {{cemetery}} memorials {{were completed}} in the 1930s under the Fascist governments of Germany and Italy. The main Italian war cemeteries were not finished until 1938, and their positioning in some cases carried special political meaning, emphasising Italy's right to claim important, but ethnically diverse, border regions. In Germany, the same decade saw the completion of totenburgen, fortresses of the dead, used as war cemeteries and memorials. These were in some senses an extension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cemetery</b> designs of the 1920s, celebrating a natural German landscape, but included extensive modernist, monumental features, intending to highlight German artistic skill.|$|E
5|$|Although the Act of 1975 had {{specified}} that {{a portion of}} the profits from land sales be used to maintain the remaining cemetery, little restoration work was done and the cemetery continued to revert to wilderness. With the new owners of the land interested only in redeveloping those parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cemetery</b> not currently in use, the cemetery itself sank further into neglect.|$|E

5|$|Brookwood {{was one of}} the few cemeteries {{to permit}} burials on Sundays, which made it a popular choice with the poor as it allowed people to attend {{funerals}} without the need to take a day off work. As theatrical performances were banned on Sundays at this time, it also made Brookwood a popular choice for the burial of actors for the same reason, to the extent that actors were provided with a dedicated section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cemetery</b> near the station entrance.|$|E
5|$|In 1864 Brookwood (Necropolis) {{railway station}} on the LSWR opened, {{immediately}} east of Necropolis Junction. In conjunction with {{the building of the}} station a run-around loop was added at Necropolis Junction, allowing locomotives to reposition themselves from the front {{to the rear of the}} train. From then on, on arrival at Necropolis Junction from London the engine would not be repositioned, but would push the train into the cemetery from the rear, under the close supervision of LNC staff. This left the engine positioned to pull the train out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cemetery,</b> after which it would use the run-around loop to move to the other end of the train and pull it back to London. Between 1898 and 1904 the LSWR line through Brookwood was increased from two to four tracks; a thin slice of the northernmost part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cemetery</b> was ceded to the LSWR to allow the widening of the line. Brookwood station was rebuilt, and a new junction to the west of the station allowed trains to pass between the cemetery branch and all four of the LSWR lines.|$|E
5|$|In 1877 during {{construction}} of the Durley Hill Cemetery, {{the remains of a}} grand Roman villa with over 30 rooms was discovered. However, construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cemetery</b> went ahead, and the majority of the villa is now located beneath the Victorian cemetery and an adjacent road. The cemetery was expanded in 1922, and an archeological dig was carried out ahead of the interments, leading to the excavation of 17 rooms and the rescue of 10 elaborate mosaics.|$|E
5000|$|The {{sale was}} ordered by Dame Shirley Porter, <b>the</b> Conservative leader <b>of</b> WCC at <b>the</b> time, {{in order to}} save the annual {{maintenance}} costs <b>of</b> £422,000, with <b>the</b> upkeep <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cemeteries</b> passing to <b>the</b> new owner. However, the deal had been handled with such incompetence by WCC that the maintenance agreement only applied to <b>the</b> immediate purchaser <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cemeteries</b> and not to any subsequent owners; <b>the</b> <b>cemeteries</b> were re-sold by the purchaser for £1.25 million {{on the same day that}} he had acquired them. Without maintenance, <b>the</b> <b>cemeteries</b> soon became overgrown, headstones were vandalised, and they were frequented by drug addicts.|$|R

5|$|In 1899 the {{location}} of the terminus was blocking the expansion of Waterloo station. After much negotiation, the LSWR reached agreement with the London Necropolis Company, the owners <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cemetery</b> and the railway: in return for the existing site, the LSWR re-equipped the London Necropolis Railway and supplied it with a new station on Westminster Bridge Road. This new building was designed to contrast with other funeral directors' premises by being as attractive as possible. In 1902 the railway moved into the new building, and the earlier station was demolished.|$|E
5|$|In September 1945, {{following}} {{the end of}} hostilities, the directors of the LNC met to consider whether to rebuild the terminus and reopen the London Necropolis Railway. Although the main line from Waterloo to Brookwood had remained in use throughout the war and was in good condition, the branch line from Brookwood into the cemetery had been almost unused since the destruction of the London terminus. With the soil <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cemetery</b> causing the branch to deteriorate even when it had been in use and regularly maintained, the branch line was in extremely poor condition.|$|E
5|$|Mount Pleasant Road was {{constructed}} {{over the course}} of several years by interconnecting several existing streets as well as building a new road in other places; at that time, a road existed to the north and south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cemetery.</b> The road to the south, running between Clarence Street (renamed Heath Street on April 7, 1913) and Moore Avenue, was known as Lyle Street and Kinsman Avenue. The road to the north, running between Balliol Street and Merton Street, was known as Alberta Avenue.|$|E

5|$|The St Symphorien Military Cemetery is a First World War Commonwealth War Graves Commission {{burial ground}} in Saint-Symphorien, Belgium. It {{contains}} {{the graves of}} 284 German and 229 Commonwealth soldiers, principally those killed during the Battle of Mons. The cemetery was established by the German Army on land donated by Jean Houzeau de Lehaie.

5|$|The Warren Family Mortuary Chapel is a stone chapel {{built on}} a knoll near the center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cemetery.</b> It was {{designed}} by Henry Dudley of New York City and built in 1860 in the English country Gothic style, complete with a nave and transept floor plan. A tower was added in 1883, with great care placed on finding building material that matched the earlier structure. The Chapel contains stained glass windows above the altar designed by artist Robert Walter Weir. Former member of the United States House of Representatives Joseph Mabbett Warren (1813–1896) is interred in the chapel.|$|E
40|$|This article reads <b>the</b> design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British Imperial War Graves <b>cemeteries</b> in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{religious}} pluralism <b>of</b> <b>the</b> late Empire.

The paper argues that <b>the</b> choice <b>of</b> quotations specifically from the apocrypha was an important and deliberate aspect of this presentational strategy...|$|R
50|$|Once {{the initial}} land was secured the board hired Chislett's son, Frederick, as Crown Hill’s first superintendent.
