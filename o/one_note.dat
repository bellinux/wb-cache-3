In {{the description of the}} banknotes, the date in parentheses indicates the individual’s first appearance on a given note type and denomination. When multiple banknotes are listed, the order, though seeming random, is in accordance with the Friedberg Number, in ascending Friedberg order. The engraved portraits are from a virtual exhibit of bank notes which are part of the National Numismatic Collection at the Smithsonian Institution.|$|E
5|$|Another {{factor in}} the Mellotron's sound is that the {{individual}} notes were recorded in isolation. For a musician accustomed to playing in an orchestral setting, this was unusual, and meant that they had nothing against which to intonate. Noted cellist Reginald Kirby refused to downtune his cello to cover the lower range of the Mellotron, and so the bottom notes are actually performed on a double bass. According to Mellotron author Nick Awde, <b>one</b> <b>note</b> of the string sounds contains {{the sound of a}} chair being scraped in the background.|$|E
5|$|For {{the most}} part Cage avoids using lower {{registers}} of the piano, {{and much of the}} music's melodic foreground lies in the soprano range. Of the forty-five prepared notes, only three belong to the three lowest octaves below F#3: D3, D2 and D1. Furthermore, D2 is prepared {{in such a way that}} the resulting sound has the frequency of a D4 (resulting in two variants of D4 available, one more prepared than the other). The portion of the keyboard above F#3 is divided into roughly three registers: low, middle, and high. The low register has the heaviest preparation, and the high register the lightest. Different methods are used: certain notes produce sounds that retain the original frequency and a pianistic character; others become drum-like sounds, detuned versions of the original notes, or metallic, rattling sounds that have no sense of the fundamental frequency at all. The use of the soft pedal, which makes the hammers strike only two of the three strings of each note (or one, for notes with only two strings), complicates the matter further. For example, the note C5 is a metallic sound with no fundamental discernible when the soft pedal is depressed, but it sounds fairly normal if the pedal is released. It appears that Cage was fully aware of the implications of this: certain sonatas feature interplay between two versions of <b>one</b> <b>note,</b> others place special emphasis on particular notes, and still others are very dependent on particular note combinations.|$|E

25|$|The {{melodic line}} of the morna varies a lot through the song, with {{ascending}} and descending note sequences, and within a bar the notes generally {{do not have the}} same length.

The melody is accentuated on the first beat and the last half-beat of the bar.|$|E
25|$|Most admirable {{of all her}} qualities, however, {{were her}} taste, elegance and deeply musical use of {{ornamentation}} {{in all its forms}} and complications, the weighting and length of every appoggiatura, the smooth incorporation of the turn in melodic lines, the accuracy and pacing of her trills, the seemingly inevitable timing of her portamentos, varying their curve with enchanting grace and meaning. There were innumerable exquisite felicities—minuscule portamentos from <b>one</b> <b>note</b> to its nearest neighbor, or over widespread intervals—and changes of color that were pure magic. In these aspects of bel canto she was supreme mistress of that art.|$|E

25|$|The {{augmented}} unison, {{the interval}} {{produced by the}} augmentation, or widening by one-half step, of the perfect unison, does not occur between diatonic scale steps, but instead between a scale step and a chromatic alteration of the same step. It is also called a chromatic semitone. The augmented unison is abbreviated A1, or aug 1. Its inversion is the diminished octave (d8, or dim 8). The augmented unison is also the inversion of the augmented octave, because the interval of the diminished unison does not exist. This is because a unison is always made larger when <b>one</b> <b>note</b> of the interval is changed with an accidental.|$|E
25|$|The {{lengths of}} the neumes were given values by adding up the {{duration}} {{values for the}} separate neume elements, each time following a particular hypothesis concerning the rhythm of Gregoriant chant. Both the syllable lengths and the neume lengths were also expressed {{in relation to the}} total duration of the syllables, resp. neumes for a word (contextual variables). Correlating the various word and neume variables, substantial correlations were found for the word variables 'accented syllable' and 'contextual syllable duration'. Moreover, it could be established that the multiple correlation (R) between the two types of variables reaches its maximum (R is about 0.80) if the neumatic elements are evaluated according to the following rules of duration: (a) neume elements that represent short notes in neumes consisting of at least two notes have duration values of 1 time; (b) neume elements that represent long notes in neumes consisting of at least two notes have duration values of 2 times; (c) neumes consisting of only <b>one</b> <b>note</b> are characterized by flexible duration values (with an average value of 2 times), which take over the duration values of the syllables to match.|$|E
25|$|After {{the three}} beats of silence that open the score, a tubular bell is struck three times very quietly (pianissimo), with 12 beats between the strikes and gap of 18 beats {{between the groups}} of three. This bell tells {{of the death of}} Britten—it is the funeral bell. It {{continues}} to be struck in groups of three widely spaced intervals for most of the piece, fading out for a time in the last 21 bars, only to reappear at the last. After the bell has struck there is a brief pause for three beats of silence, and then the first violins begin setting the pattern which the rest of the ensemble will follow at slower speeds. Half of the first violins begin playing the descending A minor scale, playing first <b>one</b> <b>note</b> from the very top of their range, then returning to the beginning and playing two notes, and then three and four and so on. The other half of the violins play notes from an A minor chord. These notes start a fourth lower and drop in pitch only when it is overrun by the first. This creates a swirling effect of increasing tension which is relieved by dropping the note. They begin playing very quietly (pianississimo) but gradually over the piece build up until they are playing very loudly (fortississimo).|$|E

500|$|Willis has {{attracted}} detractors {{due to his}} somewhat melancholic style. The Independent commentated on the 1995 Texaco Trophy that Willis had [...] "trenchant content, dismal delivery.

[...] Andrew Smith wrote in 1999 that [...] "On Sky TV, Willis is often discourteous and unfair to players. Didn't he ever make a mistake?" [...] though the Daily Mail, for whom Willis had begun writing, defended his commentary style. CricInfo's launching of two polls on cricket commentary both returned negative views of Willis' [...] "hyper-critical" [...] commentary.

500|$|The A.V. Club writer Josh Modell {{said the}} episode [...] "was pretty damn funny, but I'm {{predisposed}} to Butters in general {{as well as}} the wide world of pimping." [...] Wired writer Chris Kohler said the topical and timely jokes in [...] "Butters' Bottom Bitch", such as the satire on ACORN, were a strong example of what kept South Park funny and relevant. Not all reviews were positive. Sean O'Neal, also of The A.V. Club, gave the episode a C grade, and said [...] "It was basically <b>one</b> <b>note</b> held for the run of the ep, in service of a simple little story without many surprises." [...] O'Neal said the subplot involving the police was [...] "similarly repetitious", but he liked how the two plots came together to resolve each other.|$|E
500|$|... "Live While We're Young" [...] is an uptempo, upbeat bubblegum pop song which {{features}} rock undertones, vocal harmonies, hand claps, prominent electric guitar riffs, and repetitive synthesizers, {{reminiscent of the}} musical structures of their debut album.

According to Alexis Petridis of The Guardian, the guitar is played thrice between the riff with the plectrum stroking the strings, while it is pressed. <b>One</b> <b>note</b> in the chord is changed, which Petridis surmised was probably to avoid paying any royalty to the Clash. Sam Lansky of Idolator noted that the song is musically similar to their breakthrough hit [...] "What Makes You Beautiful".
