40|$|There are {{examples}} of entry in two-sided markets, where first entrants occupy a `central location' and serve agents with `intermediate tastes', while later entrants are niche players. Why would the first entrant choose to become a `general' platform, given that later entrants will not have enough room for differentiation, resulting in an intense price competition? This <b>one-sided</b> <b>market</b> logic may not apply in a two-sided market. A key difference in a two-sided market, stemming from the presence of cross-group network externalities, is stronger demand creation. We develop a model which can deliver the above mentioned empirical observation, when the network externalities are intermediate. On the other hand, when externalities are low, our model predicts that differentiation will be maximum, {{as it would be}} in a <b>one-sided</b> <b>market.</b> Finally, for strong externalities only one platform is active and locates at the center.

40|$|No two crises are identical. As {{we learn}} from them, they evolve and change. This thesis {{is an attempt to}} {{understand}} some of their features. We discuss the abandonment of a peg (Chapter 2), full disruption of payments (Chapter 3) and illiquidity in <b>one-sided</b> <b>markets</b> (Chapter 4). Chapter 2 investigates the consequences of introducing uncertainty about the willingness of a central bank to defend the peg in an economy in which a government runs a persistent deficit. We analyze how not knowing when other arbitrageurs intend to attack a currency affects investors' decision to attack. Specifically, we show how the lack of common knowledge induces arbitrageurs to delay their attack on the currency, which in turn leads to a discrete devaluation of the exchange rate as it is generally observed during currency crises. In Chapter 3 we examine how financial integration of payment systems creates a feedback channel which might threaten the stability of financial markets. In payment systems, banks rely heavily on incoming transfers to finance outgoing payments requiring a high degree of coordination and synchronization. We study the response of the payment system to disruptions in payments and to changes in the precautionary demand for liquid balances targeted by the different institutions in a payment system. This work aims to shed light on the recent events in credit markets. The analysis of liquidity in <b>one-sided</b> <b>markets</b> is the focus of Chapter 4. When a market is in distress, liquidity typically vanishes playing {{a key role in the}} build-up of <b>one-sided</b> <b>markets.</b> We present an alternative view of market liquidity which results from a tradeoff between market externalities and a congestion effect.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three essays in the electronics market. The first essay studies a durable good monopolist 2 ̆ 7 s incentive to introduce a downgraded version of his product, which we call a 2 ̆ 2 damaged good, 2 ̆ 2 even {{when there is no}} cost advantage. We find that it is one way to mitigate the well known time inconsistency problem in the durable good market. When there are both high and low valuation consumers in the market, the monopolist wants to sell the damaged good to low valuation consumers and relieve the pressure to hold a sale in the future. The second and third essays study electronics {{in the form of a}} system, with a platform and various applications. The second essay focuses on the platform provider 2 ̆ 7 s choice of opening or closing the system. An open system is proved to be optimal when the substitutability among applications is big and vice versa. The third essay is devoted to the platform provider 2 ̆ 7 s optimal strategy in terms of market structures and pricing structures. The choice is determined by the degree of heterogeneity in consumers 2 ̆ 7 demand for applications. When the degree is high, two-sided market structure is better than a <b>one-sided</b> <b>market.</b> The platform provider makes profit from the application side. On the other hand, when the degree is low, the platform provider will turn the two-sided market into a <b>one-sided</b> <b>market</b> and make profit from the platform side. ...|$|E

This question is part of the larger debate on network neutrality. We compare a two-sided market where these charges are allowed and a <b>one-sided</b> <b>market</b> where such charges are prohibited by possible network neutrality regulations. We find the equilibrium levels of investment of content and access providers in both regimes, which allows us to compare the welfare of the regimes as a function of a few key parameters. Our results indicate that the two-sided (non-neutral) regime is more favorable in terms of social welfare when the ratio between parameters characterizing advertising rates and end user price sensitivity is either low or high. When the ratio is in the intermediate range, the one-sided (neutral) regime can be preferable. The degree by which the one-sided regime is preferable increases with the number of ISPs. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{profitability}} and the welfare implications of price discrimination in two-sided markets. Platforms have {{information about the}} preferences of the agents {{that allows them to}} price discriminate within each group. The conventional wisdom from <b>one-sided</b> horizontally differentiated <b>markets</b> is that price discrimination hurts the firms and benefits consumers, prisoners' dilemma. Moreover, it is well-known that the presence of indirect externalities in two-sided markets can intensify the competition. Despite all these, we show that the possibility of price discrimination, in a two-sided market, may actually soften the competition. Therefore, the implications of price discrimination from <b>one-sided</b> <b>markets</b> may not carry over to two-sided markets. This is the case regardless of whether prices are public or private, although private prices boost profits.

40|$|Abstract: The authors {{present a}} simple {{diagrammatic}} exposition of a pollution-permit market {{in which both}} firms that generate pollution and consumers who are harmed by pollution are allowed to purchase permits at a single market price. They show that the market equilibrium is efficient {{if and only if}} the endowment of permits is equal to the efficient level of pollution. Furthermore, if consumers actually participate in the market, then the equilibrium is not efficient. Welfare can be improved by decreasing the endowment of permits and thereby pricing consumers out of the market. Key words: diagrammatic, efficiency, environmental policy, pollution permit markets, retired permits JEL codes: H 41, Q 25 The analysis of pollution-permit markets has traditionally focused on markets in which polluting firms trade permits amongst themselves. Such markets are one sided in the sense that only those who generate pollution, not those who are harmed by it, participate in the market. The welfare properties of <b>one-sided</b> pol-lution-permit <b>markets</b> are well known. These markets generally enable firms to attain aggregate emission-reduction targets in the least-cost manner, that is, the manner that minimizes total abatement costs (Montgomery 1972). As discussed in the extant permit-market literature, Montgomery’s result indicates that <b>one-sided</b> <b>markets</b> attain a type of productive efficiency. However, <b>one-sided</b> <b>markets</b> do not generally attain full social efficiency (minimization of the sum of abate-ment costs and damages) because total emission of pollution is equal to the total number of permits issued. Unless the permit-issuing agency has perfect informa-tion about {{the costs and benefits of}} pollution, it is likely to issue a socially inef-ficient number of permits. Many real pollution-permit markets are two sided in that they allow both pol-luters and pollutees to purchase permits. For example, in the Environmental Pro-tection Agency’s (EPA) acid-rain program, some market participants buy, and then do not use, pollution permits. An unused permit is said to be “retired. ” Because the total availability of permits is fixed by the EPA, retiring a permit reduces the aggregate level of emissions.

The presence of asset {{managers in}} EMEs has grown considerably, and the concentrated use of benchmarks and the directional co-movement of investor flows can generate correlated investment patterns that may create <b>one-sided</b> <b>markets</b> and exacerbate price fluctuations.

JEL classification: G 11, G 15, G 23. In recent years, asset managers have become important players in emerging market economy (EME) asset markets. This shift has coincided with a prolonged period of very low interest rates in advanced economies, which has led investors to look for higher-yielding (but riskier or less liquid) assets in the hope of greater returns.

40|$|We propose both a {{monopoly}} and a duopoly {{model of a}} two-sided market. Both settings are fully comparable, as we impose a homogeneous good produced at zero costs without capacity constraints, as well as identical parameterization of market sizes. We determine the duopoly equilibrium and the monopoly optimum {{in terms of the}} parameters and obtain solutions with and without subsidization (prices below marginal cost) of one market side. We show that there exists a continuum of economically plausible parameter sets for which duopoly equilibrium prices exceed optimal monopoly prices and one with no observable price effect of competition, i. e. one where optimum and equilibrium prices become equal. Despite the fact that virtually everything except for the number of platform operators is identical in the latter situations, total demand on both market sides in the duopoly market exceeds total demand in the monopoly market. Furthermore, even though there is no observable price effect, there is still a competitive effect in so far that total profits in the duopoly equilibrium are strictly smaller than monopoly profits. The relationship of total welfare is ambiguous in subsidization cases, while it is strictly greater in duopoly, if no subsidization takes place.

40|$|Mechanism {{design for}} <b>one-sided</b> <b>markets</b> has been {{investigated}} for several decades in economics and in computer science. More recently, {{there has been an}} increased attention on mechanisms for two-sided markets, in which buyers and sellers act strategically. For two-sided markets, an impossibility result of Myerson and Satterthwaite states that no mechanism can simultaneously satisfy individual rationality (IR), incentive compatibility (IC), strong budget-balance (SBB), and be efficient. On the other hand, important applications to web advertisement, stock exchange, and frequency spectrum allocation, require us to consider two-sided combinatorial auctions in which buyers have preferences on subsets of items, and sellers may offer multiple heterogeneous items. No efficient mechanism was known so far for such two-sided combinatorial markets. This work provides the first IR, IC and SBB mechanisms that provides an O(1) -approximation to the optimal social welfare for two-sided markets. An initial construction yields such a mechanism, but exposes a conceptual problem in the traditional SBB notion. This leads us to define the stronger notion of direct trade strong budget balance (DSBB). We then proceed to design mechanisms that are IR, IC, DSBB, and again provide an O(1) -approximation to the optimal social welfare. Our mechanisms work for any number of buyers with XOS valuations - a class in between submodular and subadditive functions - and any number of sellers. We provide a mechanism that is dominant strategy incentive compatible (DSIC) if the sellers each have one item for sale, and one that is bayesian incentive compatible (BIC) if sellers hold multiple items and have additive valuations over them. Finally, we present a DSIC mechanism for the case that the valuation functions of all buyers and sellers are additive...|$|R
40|$|Chapter 1 studies how consumers’ {{switching}} costs affect the pricing and profits of firms competing in two-sided markets such as Apple and Google in the smartphone market. When two-sided markets are dynamic – {{rather than merely}} static – I show that {{switching costs}} lower the first-period price if network externalities are strong, which {{is in contrast to}} what has been found in <b>one-sided</b> <b>markets.</b> By contrast, switching costs soften price competition in the initial period if network externalities are weak and consumers are more patient than the platforms. Moreover, an increase in switching costs on one side decreases the first-period price on the other side. Chapter 2 examines firms’ incentives to invest in local and flexible resources when demand is uncertain and correlated. I find that market power of the monopolist providing flexible resources distorts investment incentives, while competition mitigates them. The extent of improvement depends critically on demand correlation and the cost of capacity: under social optimum and monopoly, if the flexible resource is cheap, the relationship between investment and correlation is positive, and if it is costly, the relationship becomes negative; under duopoly, the relationship is positive. The analysis also sheds light on some policy discussions in markets such as cloud computing. Chapter 3 develops a theory of sequential investments in cybersecurity. The regulator can use safety standards and liability rules to increase security. I show that the joint use of an optimal standard and a full liability rule leads to underinvestment ex ante and overinvestment ex post. Instead, switching to a partial liability rule can correct the inefficiencies. This suggests that to improve security, the regulator should encourage not only firms, but also consumers to invest in security...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{establishment}} of commercial sharing economy services like Uber, Blablacar, Lyft, Airbnb, TaskRabbit, etc., {{the debate about the}} sharing economy and its effects on competition has generated lively discussions, which have too often dangerously departed from a debate based on objective (market) observation to evolve into a quarrel among the supporters and opponents of the online platforms. Undoubtedly, the peculiar features of these new firms’ business models create frictions with the traditional regulatory environment, which currently appears to be incapable of framing them into models and schemes typical of a previous economic phase, such as, for example, <b>one-sided</b> <b>markets,</b> no externalities, and competition mainly on price. Nevertheless, setting aside the more or less impromptu debate about the “social goodness” of these firms, we argue that competition enforcers should look at their effective market power. In fact, as the basic principles of competition law teach us, only when those firms have (more or less legitimate) significant market power, will they be subject to special responsibilities and to stringent restrictions and obligations. Toward this aim, it is first necessary to define the relevant market. And, immediately afterwards, to delimit firms’ market position. This, in turn, should help to assess their compliance with the competition rules and the obligations that they are – or rather that they should be – subjected to. This exercise is not an easy one because the traditional regulatory concepts and definitions do not seem to reflect the competition dynamics that characterise the new markets on which we are reflecting. In this paper we focus on a number of challenges that are posed by the sharing economy businesses, suggesting that they could be solved with the traditional competition instruments, although adapted to the peculiar features of the markets that are at stake. These include, among others, multi-sidedness and the presence of different externalities...|$|R

Furthermore, a monopolist provider might choose to operate multiple networks. In those equilibria product differentiation is endogenized by the network choices of consumers...|$|R

As a first step towards designing a land redistribution mechanism, we consider {{the problem of the}} existence of equilibrium. Convexity and divisibility of commodities are basic assumptions in general equilibrium theory, while we cannot apply these assumptions to land. In Chapter 2, we propose a condition under which a Pareto optimal allocation can be supported by prices when commodities are indivisible. The proof follows the Second Welfare Theorem. We use the concept of equilibrium with transfers, under which there IS some initial endowment such that a particular allocation and a price vector constitute an equilibrium. We demonstrate that there is a threshold level of monetary endowments for each agent such that below that level, equilibrium exists, and above that level, equilibrium does not exist. Our model is more general than previous literature since agents face budget constraints in our model while the existing literature often assumes that budget constraints do not bind. In Chapter 3, we examine the performance of two-sided market mechanisms for redistributing land parcels by conducting experiments. We use the concept of competitive equilibrium, rather than equilibrium with transfers, in this chapter. Using equilibrium with transfers requires the government to have information on individuals' preferences {{and to be able to}} implement the wealth transfers. Both are idealistic assumptions. Instead of the redistribution of wealth by the government, we allow agents to obtain loans to purchase land. Under the parameters used in the experiment, competitive equilibrium prices exist. Theoretically speaking, we thus can expect efficient outcomes to emerge as a result of competition. We compare the performance of three alternative mechanisms; direct negotiation, a double auction, and a combinatorial call market. Direct negotiations can be considered a cooperative mechanism and double auctions a noncooperative mechanism. A combinatorial call market was designed to solve complex resource allocation problems, such as the allocation of spectrum, and is known to outperform other mechanisms in <b>one-sided</b> <b>markets.</b> We investigate the problems we face when we extend the study to two-sided markets...|$|R
40|$|Media firms {{compete in}} two {{connected}} markets. They face rivalry {{for the sale}} of content to consumers, and at the same time, they compete for advertisers seeking access to the attention of these consumers. We explore the implications of such two-sided competition on the actions and source of profits of media firms. One main conclusion we reach is that media firms may charge higher content prices in a duopoly than in a monopoly. This happens because competition for advertisers can reduce the return per customer impression from the ad market, making each firm less willing to underprice content to increase demand. Greater competitive intensity may thus increase content profits and decrease ad profits. These findings are in sharp contrast to those in a regular <b>one-sided</b> product <b>market,</b> in which competition typically lowers product prices and profits. We extend the framework to examine competition across different media (e. g., between magazines and cable TV) and show that firms in a duopolistic medium may benefit from more intense competition from a monopolist in another medium. We characterize the conditions for each firm in the duopoly medium to bundle more ads and earn greater total profits than the rival firm in the monopoly medium. media, advertising, two-sided markets, competitive strategy, game theory...|$|R
40|$|We study {{mechanism}} design {{problems in}} the ordinal setting wherein the preferences of agents are described by orderings over outcomes, as opposed to specific numerical values associated with them. This setting is relevant when agents can compare outcomes, but aren't able to evaluate precise utilities for them. Such a situation arises in diverse contexts including voting and matching markets. Our paper addresses two issues that arise in ordinal mechanism design. To design social welfare maximizing mechanisms, one {{needs to be able}} to quantitatively measure the welfare of an outcome which is not clear in the ordinal setting. Second, since the impossibility results of Gibbard and Satterthwaite Gibbard 73,Satterthwaite 75 force one to move to randomized mechanisms, one needs a more nuanced notion of truthfulness. We propose rank approximation as a metric for measuring the quality of an outcome, which allows us to evaluate mechanisms based on worst-case performance, and lex-truthfulness as a notion of truthfulness for randomized ordinal mechanisms. Lex-truthfulness is stronger than notions studied in the literature, and yet flexible enough to admit a rich class of mechanisms circumventing classical impossibility results. We demonstrate the usefulness of the above notions by devising lex-truthful mechanisms achieving good rank-approximation factors, both in the general ordinal setting, as well as structured settings such as (<b>one-sided)</b> matching <b>markets,</b> and its generalizations, matroid and scheduling markets.
