2500|$|Many power {{supplies}} use {{more than one}} regulating method in series. For example, the output from a switching regulator can be further regulated by a linear regulator. The switching regulator accepts {{a wide range of}} input voltages and efficiently generates a (somewhat noisy) voltage slightly above the ultimately desired output. That is followed by a linear regulator that generates exactly the desired voltage and eliminates nearly all the noise generated by the switching regulator. Other designs may use an SCR regulator as the [...] "pre-regulator", followed by another type of regulator. An efficient way of creating a variable-voltage, accurate <b>output</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> is to combine a multi-tapped transformer with an adjustable linear post-regulator.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{significant}} {{design challenges}} for MOSFET driver circuits in class-D amplifiers are keeping dead times and linear mode operation {{as short as}} possible. [...] "Dead time" [...] is the period during a switching transition when both output MOSFETs are driven into Cut-Off Mode and both are [...] "off". Dead times need to be as short as possible to maintain an accurate low-distortion output signal, but dead times that are too short cause the MOSFET that is switching on to start conducting before the MOSFET that is switching off has stopped conducting. The MOSFETs effectively short the <b>output</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> through themselves in a condition known as [...] "shoot-through". Meanwhile, the MOSFET drivers also need to drive the MOSFETs between switching states {{as fast as possible}} to minimize the amount of time a MOSFET is in Linear Mode—the state between Cut-Off Mode and Saturation Mode where the MOSFET is neither fully on nor fully off and conducts current with a significant resistance, creating significant heat. Driver failures that allow shoot-through and/or too much linear mode operation result in excessive losses and sometimes catastrophic failure of the MOSFETs.|$|E
