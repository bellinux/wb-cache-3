The typical method of cooking is by adding boiled water, but Thais typically add meat, pork, chicken or egg to spice up the instant noodles.

Another method is to stir fry the cooked noodles with pork, chicken, eggs, and vegetables to give the noodles extra flavor. They are sometimes consumed directly as a snack without further cooking by crushing the noodles in the packet, adding seasoning powder in the packet and shaking the packet to coat the crushed dried noodles evenly with the seasoning. Instant noodle products have become successful in Thailand, because they are cheap, easy to eat, can be easily found, and offer a range of flavors.

40|$|Carne salgada desidratada é um produto largamente usado no Brasil, como fonte de proteína animal. O {{principal}} objetivo deste tipo de processamento é a remoção de água, inicialmente por mudanças de pressão osmótica e, a seguir por secagem, levando a um produto com umidade intermediária, como o charque e o "jerked beef". O processo de desidratação osmótica, pela penetração do sal e saída de água, causa redução nos níveis de atividade de água. Alterações de cor também ocorrem durante o processamento. Neste trabalho, estas duas variáveis são avaliadas, em pedaços de carne submetidos à salga seca e úmida. Os valores de atividade de água iniciais foram reduzidos em ambas as etapas, sendo mais acentuado para salga seca, obtendo ao término desse experimento 0, 79 unidades a 10 ºC e 0, 75 a 20 ºC. Os efeitos do sal também alteraram os parâmetros de cor, afetando os valores de L* a* b*, e direta e diferentemente o valor de DE das salgas. O estudo dos parâmetros de cor e da atividade de água é útil para um melhor conhecimento e controle do processo de carne salgada desidratada. <b>Dehydrated</b> salted <b>meat</b> is {{a product}} largely used in Brazil {{and it is a}} very important animal protein source.

At first, a few experiments {{were carried out}} to test the newly installed Harrick Praying Mantis Set-up for in-situ UV-vis-NIR investigations of n-butane isomerization over the catalyst. In its initial state, i. e. after calcination and exposure to ambient conditions, the catalyst contains mainly Mn 3 + and presumably small amounts of Mn 2 + as well as adsorbed water. Activation in O 2 <b>only</b> <b>dehydrates</b> the catalyst, while activation in He additionally leads to partial reduction of manganese (formation of new species Mn 2 +).

40|$|Of {{the many}} {{methods used to}} {{dehydrate}} food none have the potential of producing nondegraded foodstuffs {{like that of a}} vacuum assisted conductive heater, however the system required is relatively complex and many critical design choices are required to make it marketable. Continuing from promising experimental findings (Mitra, Shrivastave, & Srinivasa Rao, 2011) and high fidelity simulations (Nadi, Rahimi, Younsi, Tavakoli, & Hamidi-Esfahanim, 2012) a prototype food drier has been developed. The viability of such a system has been analysed as well as the trade-offs of all envisaged critical design choices. Simulations of top level components were used to validate purchases and the observation of Maillard reaction severity on a range of food stuffs was used to determine the performance of the Vacuum Hot-Plate System (VHPS). This project was able to develop a working prototype that could achieve the following operating parameters 70 ˚C drying temperature and 10 kPa chamber pressure. This produced dried product that was observed to be of higher quality (less degraded) than the control tests, which operated at atmospheric pressure. Only a small amount of dried food could be produced in each batch. This was to minimise the vapour entering the vacuum pump if the cold trap and heat tracer were not working as intended. Further optimisation is needed to determine the maximum amount of dried food that can be produced from a single batch. Based on the conventional preserving requirement a reduction of 40 % mass used to determine if the product was dried (Ramesh, 2003), however the results indicate that many not be applicable for vegetable and fungus materials. Images of the dried food {{can be found in the}} results section. The aim of this project was to develop a functioning prototype and validate it by experimenting on a range of foods. In such a system, the optimum operating conditions for <b>dehydrating</b> <b>meat,</b> fruit, vegetable and fungus all differ. These differing conditions cannot be achieve with existing ‘vacuum ovens’ as they use forced convection. This report has developed system requirements so that food can be dehydrated solely by conduction in absence of either natural or forced convection. Further component requirements were determined by Maillard reaction, saturation temperature and presence of bacteria and pathogens. These factors justify an operating temperature range of 40 ˚C to 70 ˚C. The optimum temperature however is determined on the timely and unburnt delivery of the produce. Food degradation can cause loss of nutrients as well as physical appearance that would reduce the ‘eat-ability’ of the product. A VHPS also has the advantage of processing food in a low oxygen environment, which reduces the rate of nutrients oxidising. Outside the scope of this project was the effect or lack thereof by oxidation of psilocin in fungus, as investigated in studies (Horita, 1961). In order to materialise such a system a signification investment of a 2 stage rotary vane vacuum pump is needed. Although a vacuum injector & air compressor are a cheap alternative for a minimum chamber pressure of ~ 20 kPa and is not susceptible to water damage. To safeguard the longevity of this investment heat tracing and cold traps were investigated. For a small batched process a cold trap is not necessary as the mixed flow entering the pump was determined to be 0. 013 % vapour. The JAVAC pump used has the operation requirement that entering gas be 50 ˚C, so heat tracing is required as the gas will only reach saturation temperature (45 ˚C at 10 kPa). A vacuum assisted conductive heater is a viable method of food drying, which can be performed on foodstuffs with a very high moisture content. From the prototype developed, a refined product has potential for commercial success but an in-depth market study is needed. Further investigation is needed to numerically verify the nutritional content of the dried foo...|$|R

We looked for sea snakes at coastal sites near Playas del Coco, counted the numbers of snakes, measured water salinity, and determined whether captured snakes would drink fresh water during a 20 -h test period immediately following capture. Most snakes were observed on slicks or drift lines and were found in roughly equal abundance during early February and during mid-April, 2010. Contrary to expectation, snakes were less abundant near each of two rivers than at sites farther out from the coast. Water salinity varied from 32 - 34 PPT during February and from 34 - 35 PPT during April. Three of 25 snakes (12 %) returned to the laboratory in February drank fresh water, and 5 of 49 snakes (10. 2 %) drank freshwater when captured in April.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{the study of the}} {{electrochemical}} reduction behavior of glyoxylic acid and phenylglyoxylic acid at silver electrode in aqueous medium and phenylglyoxylic acid in non-aqueous medium. The earlier studies of these compounds were confined only with mercury electrode. These bifunctional organic compounds exist in hydrated from in aqueous conditions and <b>only</b> <b>dehydrated</b> molecules are electro active. The above organic acids are in disassociation equilibrium with their anions and due to above mentioned conditions the reduction behavior of these compounds are complex in nature. The electrochemical reduction behavior of glyoxylic acid and phenylglyoxylic acid has been studied using rotating disc electrode voltammetry, cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry and controlled potential electrolysis techniques. Reduction of glyoxylic acid : The limiting current was found to be non-linear with W 1 / 2 at neutral and alkaline pH. The current function values, ip/ACV 1 / 2 obtained from cyclic voltammetric study were not constant. These observations along with the current time relationship obtained from chronoamperometric study indicated that the process at the limiting current region is mixed controlled both by diffusion and kinetics of the preceding dehydration reaction even in highly alkaline medium. The overall process was found to be irreversible. Tafel slope value for the reduction of glyoxylic acid was found to be pH dependent. At neutral pH the tafel slope was 60 mV and 30 - 40 mV at alkaline pH. Reaction orders were fractional with respect to glyoxylic acid and protons. E 1 / 2 were found to shift in the cathodic direction with pH and reactant concentration glyoxylic acid was found to give tartaric acid as dimerized product-both at neutral and alkaline pH conditions. Based on the above observations the reduction mechanism at neutral medium and at alkaline medium involving Temkin type of adsorption was proposed for the reduction of glyoxylic acid. Reduction of phenylglyoxylic acid: Almost similar observations were made with phenylglyoxylic acid. At the limiting current region the process was found to be diffusion controlled irreversible process in the pH range 4 - 14. The reduction product was mandelic acid. The reduction mechanism {{at the foot of the}} wave in alkaline medium was proposed. Reduction of phenylglyoxylate in DMF: The electrochemical reduction of phenylglyoxylate was studied in dimethylformamide containing 0. 2 M NaClO 4. Single wave was observed with nearly half the wave height of the wave observed for the same concentration of phenylglyoxylic acid in aqueous alkaline medium. This observation gave an indirect indication that one electron transferred radical anion is formed as an intermediate. Addition of proton donors like water and phenol resulted in an additional wave formation at less negative potential. It was also observed that the wave height of the two waves (original wave in pure DMF and additional wave in presence of proton donors) observed in the presence of water was found to increase enormously when n-butyl bromide was added to the system. As n-butyl bromide is known to react with radicals and radical anions to regenerate the reactant, both the waves observed in presence of water were due to one electron reduction and the additional wave was due to the reduction of molecular form of phenylglyoxylic acid and the original wave was due to the reduction of phenylglyoxylate anion. In conclusion the reduction of phenylglyoxylate anion in DMF id found to undergo one electron transfer with coupled fast dimerization reaction which leads to phenyl substituted tartaric acid. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{chemistry}} of the Mg2+ ion, {{as applied to}} enzymes, uses {{the full range of}} this ion’s unusual reaction chemistry to fulfill a range of functions. Mg2+ interacts with substrates, enzymes, and occasionally both (Mg2+ may form part of the active site). In general, Mg2+ interacts with substrates through inner sphere coordination, stabilising anions or reactive intermediates, also including binding to ATP and activating the molecule to nucleophilic attack. When interacting with enzymes and other proteins, Mg2+ may bind using inner or outer sphere coordination, to either alter the conformation of the enzyme or take part in the {{chemistry of}} the catalytic reaction. In either case, because Mg2+ is <b>only</b> rarely fully <b>dehydrated</b> during ligand binding, it may be a water molecule associated with the Mg2+ that is important rather than the ion itself. The Lewis acidity of Mg2+ (pKa 11.4) is used to allow both hydrolysis and condensation reactions (most common ones being phosphate ester hydrolysis and phosphoryl transfer) that would otherwise require pH values greatly removed from physiological values.|$|R
40|$|Many {{cereal grains}} grown in Canada are damaged prior to {{harvesting}} and become available for animal feeding. There {{is a lack}} of information about the nutritive values of such grains. Wheat frozen prior to reaching maturity can safely be- fed to both laying hens and chicks (MacNaugh-ton, 1952) but such grain has a reduced energy digestibility coefficient (Bell and Gidyk, 1954; Whiting and Bezeau, 1954) possibly due to the failure of the kernels to develop fully. Grains which have sprouted tend to contain more B-vitamins and less dry matter than non-sprouted controls (Anon., 1943; Cheldelin and Lane, 1943). The present experiment was designed to study the nutritive worth of wheat dam-aged by sprouting, freezing and mould development after maturity had been reached. A sample of Avon wheat (52 lb. /bu.) was soaked for 8 hours in water and then spread in a thin layer between sacking in an atmosphere maintained at 22 °C. The grain was sprayed twice daily with water. After 60 hours two sub-samples of the wheat, which by this time had sprouted, were removed. The first sub-sample was placed in a drying oven (50 °C.) for 24 hours, while the second sub-sample was frozen and held at 0 °C. for 24 hours be-fore similar drying. The remaining wheat was left to sprout for a further 72 hours during which there occurred a growth of moulds but little change in sprout length. The mouldy grain and a sample of the untreated wheat were dried for 24 hours.

Ferruginous rocks can {{be divided}} into four groups, green, ochre-yellow, wine-red, and black. The author {{attempts}} to explain the presence of two or more of these in the same strata, for example, in the Devonian series. It is shown that the yellowish-brown rocks do not owe their colour merely to ferric hydroxide as previously supposed, but to a compound of ferric hydroxide with a colourless oxide such as silica, magnesia, lime, or alumina, and as these compounds are much more stable than ferric hydroxide, they retain their colour when <b>dehydrated,</b> <b>only</b> turning brick-red on calcination, {{and at the same time}} becoming magnetic; they also resist the action of saline waters better than the simple hydroxide. The green rocks do not owe their colour to a simple ferrous silicate, but to a ferroso-ferric silicate, they are thus a special group of the black rocks coloured by magnetite. Ferric hydroxide, when in a compact form, retains its water only in an atmosphere the humidity of which is equal to its dissociation tension and at not too high a temperature; in a light form, under water, it crystallises and becomes dehydrated.

40|$|International audienceThe {{hydration}} {{process of}} dehydrated vanadia-titania catalysts at low loading is investigated using periodic DFT calculations. We {{focus on the}} early stages of the hydration process of the vanadia-titania in order to shed light onto the structural and dynamical changes occurring at the molecular level. Hydration is modeled by addition of successive water molecules to the dehydrated models. Special attention is paid to the V-OH bond formation and the transformation between different surface species. It is found that at low vanadia coverage the predominant surface species are OV(OH) O 2 monomers with high affinity for water. Interestingly, OVO 3 pyramids are stable <b>only</b> under severe <b>dehydrating</b> conditions, and hydroxylated species are expected to be present even at low water content. While low water content leads to water dissociation and supports hydration, higher content leads to a dynamic equilibrium between hydrated vanadia surface species. Interconversion between different surface species is fast and depends on the water coverage, through a fast hydrogen transfer mechanism. Leaching of OV(OH) 3 species is observed in the case of high water content. The number of adsorbed water molecules depends on temperature, but even at high temperature, water adsorption is preferred, which is relevant to the state of titania-supported catalysts during reaction conditions in which water is fed or generated during reaction. Calculated harmonic vibrations are provided for the most stable surface species; their redshift upon coordination with water and their blueshift upon progressive dehydration are experimentally confirmed by in situ Raman spectra in dry and humid air at increasing temperatures...|$|R
40|$|The role of osmotic brain {{dehydration}} in {{the early}} reduction of intracranial pressure (ICP) following mannitol administration has recently been questioned {{and a decrease in}} cerebral blood volume (CBV) proposed as the mechanism of action. To evaluate this hypothesis, relative CBV changes before and after mannitol infusion were determined by collimated gamma counting across the biparietal diameter of the exposed skull in six dogs. Red blood cells were labelled with chromium- 51. Cerebral blood volume (CBV), total blood volume (TBV), ICP, mean arterial pressure (MAP), central venous pressure (CVP), haematocrit and osmolality were serially measured after infusions of 10 ml X kg- 1 of normal saline (control study) and of 20 per cent mannitol (mannitol study). The solutions were administered over a two-minute period; a 30 -minute equilibration period intervened between the saline and mannitol infusions. We demonstrated that the mannitol infusion was associated with significant increases in relative CBV (25 per cent), ICP (7 mmHg), CVP (11 cm H 2 O), and TBV (50 per cent). MAP declined significantly (14 per cent) after mannitol infusion. The administration of saline, although associated with an increase in TBV (18 per cent), was not associated with any significant change in CBV, ICP, MAP or CVP. The increase in relative CBV persisted for 15 minutes after mannitol infusion, while the ICP returned to control within five minutes and continued to decrease. This study supports the fact that after rapid mannitol infusion, ICP begins to decrease <b>only</b> once the <b>dehydrating</b> effect has counteracted the increase in brain bulk caused by the increase in cerebral blood volume...|$|R
40|$|Water and {{its major}} constituent, oxygen, in large {{specific}} quantities {{are essential for}} maintenance of human life. Providing them in adequate quantities is widely {{believed to be a}} major challenge for human exploration and settlement of Mars. The Martian regolith isn't known to bear either water or hydrogen, the ice-rich Martian polar regions are thermally inhospitable, and the measured water content of Mars' thin atmosphere represents a layer of liquid water of average thickness only {approx} 1 % that available on the Moon, or {approx} 0. 001 cm. Crucially, however, the atmospheric Martian water inventory is advected meteorologically to everyplace on Mars, so that the few cubic kilometers of liquid water-equivalent in the atmosphere are available anywhere when, merely for the effort of condensing it. Well-engineered apparatus deployed essentially anywhere on Mars can condense water from the atmosphere in daily quantities not much smaller than its own mass, rejecting into space from radiators deployed over the local terrain the water's heat-of-condensation and the heat from non-ideality of the equipment's operation. Thus, an optimized, photovoltaically-powered water-condensing system of {approx} 0. 3 tons mass could strip 40 tons of water each year from {approx} 10 {sup 4 } times this mass of thin, dry Martian air. Given a 490 set I{sup sp} of H{sub 2 }-O{sub 2 } propulsion systems exhausting into the 6 millibar Mars-surface atmosphere and the 5. 0 km/s Martian gravity well, {approx} 40 tons of water two-thirds converted into 5 : 1 O{sub 2 }/H{sub 2 } cryogenic fuel could support exploration and loft a crew-of-four and their 8 -ton ascent vehicle into Earth-return trajectory. The remaining H{sub 2 }O and excess O{sub 2 } would suffice for half-open-cycle life support for a year's exploration-intensive stay on Mars. A Mars Expedition thus needs to land <b>only</b> explorers, <b>dehydrated</b> food, habitation gear and unfueled exploration/Earth-return equipment [...] and a water/oxygen/fuel plant exploiting Martian atmospheric water. All of the oxygen, water and propellants necessary for life-support, extensive exploration and Earth-return can be provided readily by the host planet. Crewed exploration of Mars launched from LEO with on 1. V 2 Shuttle-loads of equipment and consumables [...] a commercial total cost-equivalent of {approx}$ 650 M [...] thereby becomes feasible. The most challenging current problem with respect to human expeditions to Mars is escape from Earth's deep, 11. 2 km/s gravity well, and is largely an economic issue. Living on Mars, exploring it extensively and returning to Earth, each hitherto major technical issues, are actually much less difficult, thanks in no small part to the effective ''wetness'' of Mars.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) -University of Natal, Durban, 2002. The {{current state}} of global {{biodiversity}} is one of sustained and increasing decline especially in developing countries such as South Africa, where, medicinal plants face a particular threat due the herbal medicine trade, and because in situ conservation measures have not stemmed the exploitation of these plants (Chapter 1). Furthermore, seed storage, which offers an efficient ex situ conservation technique, cannot presently be applied to many medicinal plants, either because these species produce short-lived, recalcitrant seeds, or the post-shedding behaviour of the seeds is altogether unknown. This study investigated three medicinal plant species indigenous to Kenya and South Africa: Trichilia dregeana and T. emetica, of which no population inventories exist and no wild populations were encountered locally {{during the course of}} this study; and Warburgia salutaris, one of the most highly-utilised medicinal plants in Africa, and which is currently endangered and virtually extinct in the wild in some countries such as South Africa. Aspects of post-shedding seed physiology (Chapter 2) and the responses of the germplasm of the three species to cryopreservation (Chapter 3) were studied using viability and ultrastructural assessment, with the aim of establishing methods for both short-term and the long-term preservation, via appropriate seed storage and cryopreservation, respectively. The effect of cryopreservation on genetic fidelity, a crucial aspect of germplasm conservation, was assessed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPDs), using W. salutaris as a case-study (Chapter 4). The seeds of all three species were found to exhibit non-orthodox behaviour. On relatively slow-drying, seeds of T. dregeana and T. emetica lost viability and ultrastructural integrity at axis water contents of 0. 55 g g-l (achieved over 6 d) and 0. 42 g g-l (after 3 d) respectively, while flash-drying of embryonic axes facilitated their tolerance of water contents as low as 0. 16 g g-l (T. dregeana, flash-dried for 4 h) and 0. 26 (T. emetica, flash-dried for 90 min). Seeds of W. salutaris were relatively more tolerant to desiccation, remaining viable at axis water contents below 0. 1 g g-l when desiccated for 6 d in activated silica gel. However, excised embryonic axes flash-dried to similar water contents over 90 min lost viability and were ultrastructurally damaged beyond functionality. In terms of storability of the seeds, those of T. dregeana could be stored in the fully hydrated state for at least 5 months, provided that the quality was high and microbial contamination was curtailed at onset of storage, while those T. emetica remained in hydrated storage for about 60 d, before all seeds germinated in storage. Seeds of W salutaris, even though relatively tolerant to desiccation, were not practically storable at reduced water content, losing viability within 49 d when stored at an axis water content of 0. 1 g g-l. The seeds of all three species were sensitive to chilling, suffering extensive subcellular derangement, accompanied by loss of viability, when stored at 6 °C. Thus, T. dregeana and T. emetica are typically recalcitrant, while those of W. salutaris are suggested to fit within the intermediate category of seed behaviour. For either recalcitrant or intermediate seeds, the only feasible method of long-term germpalsm preservation may be cryopreservation. Subsequent studies established that whole seeds of W. salutaris could be successfully cryopreserved following dehydration in activated silica gel. However, whole seeds of T. dregeana and T. emetica were unsuitable for cryopreservation, and excised embryonic axes were utilised. For these, in vitro germination methods, as well as cryoprotection, dehydration, freezing and thawing protocols were established. Post-thaw survival of the axes of both species was shown to depend on cryoprotection, rapid dehydration and cooling (freezing) in cryovials. Embryonic axes of T. dregeana regenerated only as callus after cryopreservation, while those of T. emetica generated into apparently normal plantlets. Thawing/rehydration in a 1 : 1 solution of 1 µM CaC 12. 2 H 2 O and 1 mM MgC 12. 6 H 2 O increased the percentage of axes surviving freezing, and that of T. emetica axes developing shoots. The effect of the extent of seed/axis development on onward growth after cryopreservation was apparent for seeds of W. salutaris and excised axes of T. emetica. The seeds of W. salutaris surviving after cryopreservation germinated into seedlings which appeared similar to those from non-cryopreserved seeds, both morphologically and in terms of growth rate. Analysis using PCR-RAPDs revealed that there were no differences in both nucleotide diversity or divergence, among populations of seedlings from seeds which had been sown fresh, or those which had either been <b>dehydrated</b> <b>only,</b> or <b>dehydrated</b> and cryopreserved. Thus, neither dehydration alone, nor dehydration followed by cryopreservation, was associated with any discernible genomic change. The above results are reported and discussed in detail in Chapters 2 to 4, and recommendations and future prospects outlined in Chapter 5...|$|R
