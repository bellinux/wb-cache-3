25|$|On 3 July 1968, Trident 1s G-ARPI and G-ARPT {{were struck}} by Airspeed Ambassador G-AMAD, which crashed at London Heathrow Airport due {{to the failure of}} a flap <b>operating</b> <b>rod.</b> G-ARPI was {{severely}} damaged, but repaired and returned to service, whereas G-ARPT was written off. However, 4 years later, G-ARPI would be lost.|$|E
25|$|An {{interesting}} {{point of the}} design was {{that it did not}} use a traditional helical coiled recoil spring, but used a spiral spring, much like a large clock spring, in a semicircular housing {{just in front of the}} trigger. The <b>operating</b> <b>rod</b> had a toothed underside, which engaged with a cog which wound the spring. When the gun fired, the bolt recoiled and the cog was turned, tightening the spring until the resistance of the spring had reached the recoil force of the bolt assembly. At that moment, as the gas pressure in the breech fell, the spring unwound, turning the cog, which, in turn, wound the <b>operating</b> <b>rod</b> forward for the next round. As with a clock spring, the Lewis gun recoil spring had an adjustment device to alter the recoil resistance for variations in temperature and wear. Unusual as it seems, the Lewis design proved reliable and was even copied by the Japanese and used extensively by them during the Second World War.|$|E
25|$|On 3 July 1968, {{the port}} flap <b>operating</b> <b>rod</b> of G-AMAD, an Airspeed Ambassador {{operated}} by BKS Air Transport failed due to fatigue thereby allowing the port flaps to retract. This {{resulted in a}} rolling movement to port {{which could not be}} controlled during the approach, causing the aircraft to contact the grass and swerve towards the terminal building. It hit two parked British European Airways Hawker Siddeley Trident aircraft, burst into flames and came to rest against the ground floor of the terminal building. Six of the eight crew died, as did eight horses on board. Trident G-ARPT was written off, and Trident G-ARPI was badly damaged, but subsequently repaired, only to be lost in the Staines crash in 1972.|$|E

50|$|Unskilled use of {{the tool}} will often detach the lock rods, leaving the lock {{inoperable}} even with the key. This is often a clue that someone has attempted to break into a car. Newer cars have also incorporated internal defenses against this tool such as barrier blocks {{on the bottom of}} the window, preventing entry, and also shrouding the <b>operating</b> <b>rods</b> and the lock cylinder to prevent manipulation of internal linkages. Others have designed the <b>operating</b> <b>rods</b> to be easily disconnected when engaged with a lateral force - as is often created by the lifting action of the tool.|$|R
25|$|Drive {{was from}} the {{camshaft}} <b>operating</b> <b>rods</b> of an Austro-Daimler engine via a wormgear. The early Schwarzlose gun had a synchronized rate of 360 rounds per minute with this gear – this was later boosted to 380 rounds with the MG16 model.|$|R
2500|$|A {{product of}} Troy Industries the CAR 14 (Carbine Assault Rifle 14) is a smaller and lighter {{tactical}} {{version of the}} M14. [...] Its barrel is 12.5 inches long and it weighs 7.9 pounds. The rifle has select fire ability, a threaded flash suppressor for a suppressor, a tactical rail on top for sights and other attachments, and the <b>operating</b> <b>rod</b> cover.|$|E
2500|$|In contrast, the T44 {{prototype}} service rifle was not principally {{designed by}} any single engineer at Springfield Armory, but rather was a conventional design developed {{on a shoestring}} budget {{as an alternative to}} the T47. With only minimal funds available, the earliest T44 prototypes simply used T20E2 receivers fitted with magazine filler blocks and re-barreled for 7.62×51mm NATO, with the long operating rod/piston of the M1 replaced by the T47's gas cut-off system. [...] Lloyd Corbett, an engineer in Harvey's rifle design group, added various refinements to the T44 design, including a straight <b>operating</b> <b>rod</b> and a bolt roller to reduce friction.|$|E
2500|$|The M14K is a {{commercial}} {{version of the}} M14 designed and built by Timothy F. LaFrance of La France Specialties of San Diego, California, most using forged receivers produced by Smith Enterprise of Tempe, Arizona. This rifle has a custom-made short barrel with a custom-made flash suppressor, shortened <b>operating</b> <b>rod,</b> and employs a unique gas tube system. [...] Fully automatic versions have a removable flash suppressor. [...] Semi-automatic versions (of which very few were made) have a silver-brazed flash hider {{to comply with the}} requirement that Title I firearms have a 16" [...] barrel. [...] Most M14Ks employ the M60 gas tube system. [...] Some late-model M14Ks employ a custom-designed and manufactured gas system. [...] Both are intended to control the rate of fire in fully automatic mode. [...] The rear sight is a custom-made National Match type aperture, and the front sight is a custom-made narrow blade, wing-protected sight {{to take advantage of the}} additional accuracy afforded by the special barrel.|$|E
50|$|The {{pantograph}} was, {{in keeping}} with most pantographs at the time, spring operated with an elementary head suspension. It featured needle roller bearings at the base and knuckle. The <b>operating</b> <b>rods</b> were cleverly hidden inside the hollow arms making an excellent aesthetically pleasing design.|$|R

5000|$|The pilot {{probably}} {{tried to}} overshoot {{and set the}} flaps to the correct 10 degrees, but due to the mechanism design this was not sufficient to cause the starboard flaps to retract (which would have taken 25 seconds in any event). The Department of Transport report concluded that whatever the pilot's actions, it was [...] "doubtful" [...] whether an accident could have been avoided. After the accident all Ambassadors were fitted with steel reinforcements to the flap <b>operating</b> <b>rods.</b>|$|R
2500|$|G36C (C="Compact", {{commonly}} {{mistaken for}} [...] "Commando", a term trademarked by Colt Firearms for the CAR-15): This subcarbine {{model is a}} further development of the G36K. It has a shorter barrel than the G36K, and a four-prong open-type flash hider or a birdcage type flash hider. The extremely short barrel forced designers to move the gas block closer to the muzzle end and reduce {{the length of the}} gas piston <b>operating</b> <b>rod.</b> The handguard and stock were also shortened and the fixed carry handle (with optics) was replaced with a carrying handle with an integrated MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rail. The dual optical sight found on the standard G36 and G36K models was replaced with a set of rail-mounted detachable iron sights that consist of a semi-shrouded front post and a flip-up rear sight with two apertures of different diameter. The short handguard has four accessory attachment points, one of which could be used for a vertical grip. The G36C was developed and produced in January 2001.|$|E

50|$|An M.L.S. multiple-valve {{regulator}} superheater header was fitted, {{arranged with}} the regulator valves located on its saturated steam side. The regulator spindle {{passed through the}} smokebox side and the <b>operating</b> <b>rods</b> were led along the left-hand side of the boiler to the cab. Steam was fed to the superheater header through a 7 in diameter internal steam pipe from a standpipe in the shallow dome. As an experiment, two of the engines were equipped with patent steam driers, fitted in the dome.|$|R
50|$|Brakes were conventional, {{consisting}} of 17 in drum brakes finned for improved cooling and <b>operated</b> by <b>rod.</b> Semi-elliptic leaf springs were used at front and rear.|$|R
50|$|A new {{smoother}} {{single plate}} spring-drive clutch was now fitted, the two friction rings {{carried by the}} centre plate were held apart by leaf springs. Other changes included Girling brakes with wedge and roller shoe expansion and balance lever compensation using <b>operating</b> <b>rods</b> in tension with automatic compensation between front and rear brakes all four of which might be applied by hand or foot. Drums were now 9 inches diameter. 16-inch steel disc wheels replaced the 18-inch wires Top speed rose to 60 mph.|$|R
5000|$|The M1 rifle is fed by an [...] "en bloc" [...] clip {{which holds}} eight rounds of [...]30-06 Springfield ammunition. When the last {{cartridge}} is fired, the rifle ejects the clip and locks the bolt open. The M1 is {{now ready to}} reload. Once the clip is inserted, the bolt snaps forward on its own as soon as thumb pressure is released from the top round of the clip, chambering a round and leaving it ready to fire. Although it is not absolutely necessary, the preferred method is to place {{the back of the}} right hand against the <b>operating</b> <b>rod</b> handle and press the clip home with the right thumb; this releases the bolt, but the hand restrains the bolt from slamming closed on the operator's thumb (resulting in [...] "M1 thumb"); the hand is then quickly withdrawn, the <b>operating</b> <b>rod</b> moves forward and the bolt closes with sufficient force to go fully to battery. Thus, after the clip has been pressed into position in the magazine, the <b>operating</b> <b>rod</b> handle should be released, allowing the bolt to snap forward under pressure from the <b>operating</b> <b>rod</b> spring. The <b>operating</b> <b>rod</b> handle may be smacked with the palm to ensure the bolt is closed.|$|E
50|$|The straight-line layout {{allowed the}} <b>operating</b> <b>rod</b> and buffer to run {{directly}} {{back into the}} buttstock and reduce the overall length of the weapon.|$|E
50|$|Garand's {{original}} {{design for the}} M1 used a complicated gas system involving a special muzzle extension gas trap, later dropped {{in favor of a}} simpler drilled gas port. Because most of the older rifles were retrofitted, pre-1939 gas-trap M1s are very rare today and are prized collector's items. In both systems, expanding gases from a fired cartridge are diverted into the gas cylinder. Here, the gases meet a long-stroke piston attached to the <b>operating</b> <b>rod,</b> which is pushed rearward by the force of this high-pressure gas. Then, the <b>operating</b> <b>rod</b> engages a rotating bolt inside the receiver. The bolt is attached to the receiver via two locking lugs, which rotate, unlock, and initiate the ejection of the spent cartridge and the reloading cycle when the rifle is discharged. The <b>operating</b> <b>rod</b> (and subsequently the bolt) then returns to its original position.|$|E

50|$|The port (left) flap <b>operating</b> <b>rod</b> {{had failed}} due to metal fatigue. While the {{mechanism}} had failed, the compensating mechanism {{between the two}} sets of flaps remained intact. The port flaps had retracted but the compensator caused the starboard ones to extend further. The resulting asymmetry of lift resulted in the roll to port.|$|E
50|$|The Mini Nimbus range all feature self-connecting controls, of Glasflügel design, {{for added}} safety {{and ease of}} rigging, and have been {{incorporated}} in all newer Schempp-Hirth models.

50|$|Several {{critical}} {{parts of}} early production M60s, {{such as the}} receiver cover and feed tray, were made from very thin sheet metal stampings and were prone to bending or breaking; sturdier parts were eventually available in the early 1970s. Early M60s also had driving spring guides and <b>operating</b> <b>rods</b> that were too thin and gas pistons that were too narrow behind the piston head (part {{of an attempt to}} save weight), leading to problems with breakage. Metallurgical problems also played a part, (blamed by some on low-bid contractors), but after 1970 a slightly heavier part was designed and slowly put into the supply chain. High-round-count weapons were also susceptible to stretching of the receiver and other parts.|$|R
50|$|The Railway <b>Operating</b> Division (<b>ROD)</b> was a {{division}} of the Royal Engineers formed in 1915 to operate railways in the many theatres of the First World War. It was largely composed of railway employees and operated both standard gauge and narrow gauge railways.|$|R
