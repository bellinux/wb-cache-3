5|$|Gilbert and Sullivan scored {{their first}} {{international}} hit with H.M.S. Pinafore (1878), satirising {{the rise of}} unqualified people to positions <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> <b>and</b> poking good-natured fun at the Royal Navy and the English obsession with social status (building on a theme introduced in The Sorcerer, love between members of different social classes). As {{with many of the}} Gilbert and Sullivan operas, a surprise twist changes everything dramatically {{near the end of the}} story.|$|E
5|$|Born in a {{small town}} in the state of Veracruz, Martínez Pérez left her {{hometown}} to study journalism at Universidad Veracruzana. After graduating from university, she went to work at a state-owned television company in Chiapas in the early 1980s, but she encountered various forms of censorship that convinced her to pursue a career in print media. After five years in Chiapas, Martínez Pérez relocated to Veracruz and worked for several local newspapers. In Veracruz, Martínez Pérez faced several challenges of censorship by the political establishment for her direct reporting, and particularly for being an outspoken critic of human rights violations, government corruption, abuse <b>of</b> <b>authority,</b> <b>and</b> for her in-depth coverage of the drug trafficking organizations that operate in Veracruz.|$|E
5|$|Originally under Colonel J. V. B. Jervis-Read, the {{department}} {{suffered from a}} lack <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> <b>and</b> resources. In December 1943, Jervis-Read was replaced by Colonel Noel Wild, {{a member of the}} middle eastern 'A' Force deception department, and expanded dramatically. Wild split {{the department}} into Operations and Intelligence sections. Lieutenant Colonel Roger Fleetwood-Hesketh retained charge of the latter, and Wild placed Jervis-Read in command of the former. Fleetwood-Hesketh immediately expanded his staff, bringing in his brother, an MI5 liaison officer and a secretary. The operations section was not expanded until May, with three American officers and Major S. B. D. (Sam) Hood (another 'A' Force alumnus) joining the department.|$|E

5|$|The King {{empowered}} the College to {{have and}} use only one common seal <b>of</b> <b>authority,</b> <b>and</b> also instructed them to find a chaplain to celebrate mass daily for himself, Anne Neville, the Queen Consort, and his heir, Prince Edward. The College was also granted a house named Coldharbour (formerly Poulteney's Inn) on Upper Thames Street in the parish of All-Hallows-the-Less, for storing records and living space for the heralds. The house, built by Sir John de Pulteney, four times Lord Mayor of London, {{was said to be}} one of the greatest in the City of London.|$|E
5|$|The second {{castle in}} Lydford was {{constructed}} in 1195 following a wave {{of law and order}} problems across England. It included a stone tower with a surrounding bailey, and rapidly became used as a prison and court to administer the laws in the Forest of Dartmoor and the Devon stannaries. The tower was rebuilt {{in the middle of the}} 13th century, probably in the 1260s by Richard, the Earl of Cornwall. It was redesigned to resemble a motte and bailey castle, an antiquated design for the period but one that was heavily symbolic <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> <b>and</b> power. In 1342 the castle, still being used as a prison and courtroom, passed to the Duchy of Cornwall, who owned it until the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|This {{conflict}} has led historians {{to take a}} number of positions on political arrangements in the province. Some have argued that Josephus' greater knowledge of Jewish affairs justifies favouring his account. M. Aberbach believes {{that there was a}} division of power, but that Tacitus reversed the governors' areas <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> <b>and</b> that Cumanus actually governed the south and Felix the north; this fits better with Josephus, who describes Cumanus as active in Jerusalem and nearby. Another suggestion is that part of the province was transferred to Felix after disturbances under Cumanus' rule.|$|E

40|$|The {{creation}} and maintenance <b>of</b> influential leaders <b>and</b> <b>authorities</b> is one <b>of</b> the key themes of archaeological and historical enquiry. However the social dynamics <b>of</b> <b>authorities</b> <b>and</b> {{leaders in the}} Mesolithic remains a largely unexplored area of study. The role <b>and</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>authorities</b> can be remarkably different in different situations yet they exist in all societies and in almost all social contexts from playgrounds to parliaments. Here we explore {{the literature on the}} dynamics <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> creation, maintenance <b>and</b> contestation in egalitarian societies, and discuss the implications for our interpretation and understanding of the formation <b>of</b> <b>authorities</b> <b>and</b> leaders and changing social relationships within the Mesolithic...|$|R

5|$|According to the seventeenth-century Annals of the Four Masters, he {{had secured}} the {{cooperation}} of Dublin, and perhaps gained the kingship of the town itself, through a stipend of 4,000 cows. In consequence, Dubliners formed part of Ua Conchobair's forces when he marched to Drogheda and Leinster, where he forced the submissions of the kings of Airgialla and Leinster respectively. In fact, Dublin appears to have formed {{a key part of}} Ua Conchobair's arsenal, and it is apparent that Mac Murchada was doomed without the support of this coastal-kingdom. Certainly, the twelfth–thirteenth-century La Geste des Engleis en Yrlande relates that Ascall ("MacTurkyl de Diveline") had abandoned his former overlord, and the eleventh–fourteenth-century Annals of Inisfallen specify that Mac Murchada was only expulsed from Ireland after the Leinstermen and Dubliners had turned against him. Although Ua Conchobair appears to have allowed Mac Murchada to retain his patrimonial lordship of Uí Chennselaig, the Annals of the Four Masters reveals that the Leinstermen and Dubliners assisted Tigernán Ua Ruairc, King of Bréifne (died 1172) in forcing Mac Murchada from this final vestige <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> <b>and</b> into exile.|$|E
5|$|Available {{evidence}} indicates that the real Lad was born in December 1902, and that unlike his fictional counterpart, Lad was a collie of unknown lineage with no American Kennel Club registration papers. After living five years with a heart tumor, the dog died on September 3, 1918 and his obituary was featured on a multi-page spread of the September 14, 1918 issue of Field and Fancy magazine. Terhune reported that he received hundreds of letters from fans asking him to publish more stories about Lad, and that over 1,700 people visit Lad's grave at Sunnybank. In 1922, he collected together eleven more short stories into a novel; the stories were published earlier in The Ladies' Home Journal, with some new stories and some from other magazines. The new set of stories primarily revolved around the themes of right and wrong, abuse <b>of</b> <b>authority,</b> <b>and</b> justice. Intending {{it to be the}} last book he would write about his late collie, Terhune killed the fictional Lad in the last chapter of the novel. The novel was published by George H. Doran as Further Adventures of Lad. Seven years and twenty other novels later, he would change his mind and release one more Lad novel, Lad of Sunnybank, which was published by HarperCollins.|$|E
5|$|Following the crisis, the Colonel Director of Retainers {{retained}} his privileged {{possession of}} the Staff <b>of</b> <b>Authority</b> <b>and</b> was granted the same investigative and censorial powers as the Chancellor and Imperial Counselor over officialdom. He routinely inspected the conduct of officials in the capital region and seven nearby commanderies. His investigative powers matched those of a provincial Inspector, although his Staff of Authority made him {{more powerful than the}} latter. The Colonel Director of Retainers was a personal servant of the emperor, answering only to him, allowing the emperor to greatly enhance his control over the bureaucracy. However, the Staff of Authority was removed from the Colonel in 45 BC, limiting his powers to inspection, investigation, and impeachment and he was distinguished from a provincial Inspector only by a higher salary-rank. The office of Colonel Director of Retainers was abolished in 9 BC, and reinstated once more as the Director of Retainers in 7 BC. He was now a subordinate of the new Excellency of Works and supervised convicts in public works projects, like his early Western Han counterpart. In Eastern Han, the Colonel Director of Retainers was reappointed without the Staff of Authority, with powers to inspect the capital region, but his salary-rank was reduced from 2000–dan to Equivalent to 2000–dan.|$|E

5|$|The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari {{was written}} by Hans Janowitz and Carl Mayer, {{both of whom were}} pacifists by the time they met {{following}} World War I. Janowitz served as an officer during the war, but the experience left him embittered with the military, which affected his writing. Mayer feigned madness to avoid military service during the war, which led him to intense examinations from a military psychiatrist. The experience left him distrustful <b>of</b> <b>authority,</b> <b>and</b> the psychiatrist served {{as a model for the}} Dr. Caligari character. Janowitz and Mayer were introduced in June 1918 by a mutual friend, actor Ernst Deutsch. Both writers were penniless at the time. Gilda Langer, an actress with whom Mayer was in love, encouraged Janowitz and Mayer to write a film together. She later became the basis for the Jane character. Langer also encouraged Janowitz to visit a fortune teller, who predicted that Janowitz would survive his military service during the war, but Langer would die. This prediction proved true, as Langer died unexpectedly in 1920, and Janowitz said it inspired the scene in which Cesare predicts Alan's death at the fair.|$|E
5|$|The emperor was the {{ultimate}} authority in policy- and decision-making, {{but in the early}} Principate he was expected to be accessible to individuals from all walks of life, and to deal personally with official business and petitions. A bureaucracy formed around him only gradually. The Julio-Claudian emperors relied on an informal body of advisors that included not only senators and equestrians, but trusted slaves and freedmen. After Nero, the unofficial influence of the latter was regarded with suspicion, and the emperor's council (consilium) became subject to official appointment for the sake of greater transparency. Though the senate took a lead in policy discussions {{until the end of the}} Antonine dynasty, equestrians played an increasingly important role in the consilium. The women of the emperor's family often intervened directly in his decisions. Plotina exercised influence on both her husband Trajan and his successor Hadrian. Her influence was advertised by having her letters on official matters published, as a sign that the emperor was reasonable in his exercise <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> <b>and</b> listened to his people.|$|E

40|$|The {{emergence}} of “Slippery Slope Framework” has attracted many researchers who examined the effect <b>of</b> trust in <b>authorities</b> <b>and</b> power <b>of</b> <b>authorities</b> on tax compliance using both the real taxpayer and student subjects. However, these researchers have neglected {{the use of}} cross country data to examine these effects. In line with prior empirical evidences that confirm the effect of trust <b>and</b> power <b>of</b> <b>authorities</b> on tax compliance, this study hypothesizes that both trust and power have association with tax compliance across countries. It further hypothesizes that trust has more association with tax compliance than power. This study is based on 49 Sub-Saharan African countries as the population, out of which 37 countries were selected using multi-stage random sampling. The empirical results from these countries reveal {{that there is an}} association between both trust in <b>authorities</b> <b>and</b> power <b>of</b> <b>authorities</b> <b>and</b> tax compliance across the 37 Sub-Saharan African countries, but the association between power <b>of</b> <b>authorities</b> <b>and</b> tax compliance is stronger than that <b>of</b> trust in <b>authorities</b> <b>and</b> tax compliance. Further, the result does not find any causing effect of both trust and power on tax compliance in the countries that constituted the study sample...|$|R
