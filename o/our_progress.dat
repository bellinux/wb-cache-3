The Institute promotes Engelbart's philosophy for boosting Collective IQ—the concept of dramatically improving how we can solve important problems together—using a strategic bootstrapping approach for accelerating <b>our</b> <b>progress</b> toward that goal. In 2005, Engelbart received a National Science Foundation grant to fund the open source HyperScope project. The Hyperscope team built a browser component using Ajax and Dynamic HTML designed to replicate Augment's multiple viewing and jumping capabilities (linking within and across various documents).|$|E

500|$|Originally, Descent 3 was {{intended}} to support both a software and a hardware renderer, implying that the rendering process of the game could take place either in the CPU or dedicated hardware like a video card. However, about six months after starting development, the team decided {{to go with a}} hardware-only renderer because it allowed them to create [...] "visually stunning" [...] graphics and maintain a solid frame rate without worrying about the limitations imposed by the software renderer. This was a difficult decision since the team had to scrap many tools and software rendering technology that were already developed. In addition, computers with hardware acceleration were not common at the time the decision was made. As the developers noted, [...] "We knew just by looking at <b>our</b> <b>progress</b> on the game under acceleration that we had a beautiful looking game with all the latest technologies — but would anyone actually be able to play it?" [...] Fortunately, as development progressed, hardware acceleration became more popular with each passing year. The game natively supports the Direct3D, Glide and OpenGL rendering APIs for graphics, and the A3D and DirectSound3D technologies for sound.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the STN, a distributed SDN control plane based on Software Transactional Memory principles that supports concurrent policy updates while ensuring consistent policy composition and high availability. In particular, STN gives network programmers an abstraction that guarantees (1) linearizability: any execution {{can be transformed}} into an equivalent sequential history and (2) wait-freeness: the control plane tolerates up to f node failures, for some parameter f. We describe an STN design using a number of tags which is asymptotically minimal to ensure the above properties. Also, we report <b>our</b> <b>progresses</b> in building an STN prototype based on the Pyretic modular programming language...|$|R

40|$|Vibration {{reduction}} {{is of great}} importance in various engineering applications, and a material that exhibits good vibration damping along with high strength and modulus has {{become more and more}} vital. Owing to the superior mechanical property of carbon nanotube (CNT), new types of vibration damping material can be developed. This paper presents recent advancements, including <b>our</b> <b>progresses,</b> in the development of high-damping macroscopic CNT assembly materials, such as forests, gels, films, and fibers. In these assemblies, structural deformation of CNTs, zipping and unzipping at CNT connection nodes, strengthening and welding of the nodes, and sliding between CNTs or CNT bundles are playing important roles in determining the viscoelasticity, and elasticity as well. Towards the damping enhancement, strategies for micro-structure and interface design are also discussed...|$|R
