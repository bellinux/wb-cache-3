5|$|Björk is a singer-songwriter from Reykjavík, Iceland. Her debut album, Björk, {{considered}} juvenilia, {{was released}} in 1977 by the Fálkinn record label. Her subsequent eight studio albums were released by <b>One</b> <b>Little</b> Indian Records: Debut (1993), Post (1995), Homogenic (1997), Vespertine (2001), Medúlla (2004), Volta (2007), Biophilia (2011) and Vulnicura (2015). Six of her albums have entered the top 10 in the UK Albums Chart, while Volta, is her only album {{to reach the top}} 10 in the Billboard 200. Björk's record label, <b>One</b> <b>Little</b> Indian Records, reported that she has sold more than 20 million albums worldwide.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} later than <b>One</b> <b>Little</b> Indian Records had intended. Björk was behind schedule and the album's cover design by Nick Knight needed a reshoot. Towards {{the end of}} August 1997, <b>One</b> <b>Little</b> Indian delayed the album by a month. Homogenic was released on September 22, 1997 on <b>One</b> <b>Little</b> Indian in the United Kingdom and on September 23 Elektra Records in North America on compact disc and cassette. The album was later issued on vinyl and DualDisc formats. The Japanese version of Homogenic included several bonus tracks and remixed versions of songs. The DualDisc release featured the full album on the CD side and the DVD side included the album with superior sound quality and the music videos for the singles.|$|E

5|$|By September 2001, {{the album}} had reached number 19 on the Billboard 200 {{and the top}} spot on the Top Electronic Albums chart, with <b>One</b> <b>Little</b> Indian head Derek Birket declaring that the album had sold over 1.2 million copies in Europe alone. That month, the album also became {{number one on the}} album charts in Iceland, Sweden, Denmark, France, Norway, Spain, and the European Top 100 Albums chart. In addition, Vespertine charted at the Top 10 of Canada, Italy, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, Finland, Belgium, Switzerland, Sweden, Austria and Australia. The album was {{certified}} Gold in Canada, France, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Homogenic is {{the third}} {{international}} solo album by Icelandic musician Björk, released in September 1997. Produced by Björk, Mark Bell, Guy Sigsworth, Howie B and Markus Dravs, it was released on <b>One</b> <b>Little</b> Indian Records. The music of Homogenic was a new style for Björk, focusing on similar-sounding music combining electronic beats and string instruments with songs in tribute to her native country Iceland. Homogenic was originally to be produced in her home in London, but was later recorded in Spain. Homogenic marked {{the first of several}} production collaborations between Björk and Mark Bell, whom Björk would cite as a major influence on her musical career. The album peaked at number twenty-eight on the Billboard 200, and at number four on the UK Albums Chart.|$|E
5|$|Post is {{the second}} solo studio album by Icelandic {{musician}} Björk. The album was released in June 1995 through <b>One</b> <b>Little</b> Indian in the United Kingdom and Elektra Records in the United States. Unlike her previous release Debut—which was almost entirely produced by Nellee Hooper—Post is characterised by more collaborative efforts, including production by Hooper, 808 State's Graham Massey, and former Massive Attack member Tricky. Moreover, Björk co-produced every song on the album. Post received widespread critical acclaim from reviewers and was a commercial success, charting at number 2 in the United Kingdom and 32 in the United States. It was certified gold in New Zealand and Sweden, and platinum in Australia, Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom. Telegram, a remix album of songs from Post, was released in 1996.|$|E

5|$|Surrounded is {{the third}} box set by Icelandic {{musician}} Björk. It was released on 27 June 2006 through <b>One</b> <b>Little</b> Indian. It {{is a collection of}} seven of her studio albums, issued in the DualDisc format—one side contains the original longplayers, while the other one includes their remastered versions in surround sound, in tandem with music videos and additional features. While the box set did not impact any record charts, music critics gave mixed to positive reviews to Surrounded. Most of them were positive towards its packaging and affirmed it was an effective showcase of Björk's catalogue. Nonetheless, criticism was targeted towards its opportunistic nature and technicalities.|$|E
5|$|Vespertine is {{the fourth}} solo album by Icelandic {{musician}} Björk, released on 27 August 2001, on <b>One</b> <b>Little</b> Indian Records. It was recorded at locations in Spain, Iceland, and the United States in 2000; production began during the filming of Dancer in the Dark, which was characterized by conflict between the singer and director Lars von Trier. Björk, a self-titled coffee table book containing photographs of the singer throughout her career, was released simultaneously with the album. Vespertines sound reflected Björk's newly found interest in the music of artists such as Opiate and Console, who were also enlisted as producers.|$|E
25|$|Volta is {{the sixth}} studio album by Icelandic singer Björk, {{released}} on 1 May 2007 by <b>One</b> <b>Little</b> Indian Records.
