25|$|In summer 1962, Lair {{arranged}} USAID air {{drops of}} food, medicine, and other essentials to Hmong uprooted {{by the growing}} war. In June, when The Saturday Evening Post ran an article <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>program,</b> Lair was content to let Edgar Buell be {{the public face of}} refugee relief, as a means of hiding CIA involvement. In October 1962, in accordance with the International Agreement on the Neutrality of Laos, the Americans in country drew down to two CIA agents left in Laos after evacuationTony Poe and Vint Lawrence. However, 100 PARU troopers also remained, still engaged in training the Hmong. Lair and Landry withdrew to Nong Khai, Thailand, just across the Mekong River from Vientiane. In turn, the Vietnamese Communists officially withdrew 40 soldiers, with at least 5,000 others remaining in Laos.|$|E

2500|$|As a {{hedge against}} the {{possibility}} of the Soviets [...] "breaking out" [...] of the ABM treaty, the Army was given the go-ahead to continue development of ABM technologies, focusing on the Safeguard-like concept of defending the missile fields. The Army responded with two concepts, updates to the original Safeguard using a new radar and upgraded Sprint II missile, and a new concept for a high-altitude interceptor that would use hit-to-kill instead of a nuclear warhead. Work on the former, known as Site Defence of Minuteman, went as far as building a radar at the Army's testing site on Meck Island in the Kwajalein Atoll, but work <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>program</b> ended in 1974 when it was clear the treaty was going to be followed by both countries.|$|E

2500|$|Thomas was a {{test pilot}} for Northrop from 1963 until he retired from flying in 1986. [...] He stayed with the company until 2000, his {{official}} retirement, and completed his career with Northrop as a Technical Director applying his knowledge to the B-2 flight test program. [...] He was recognized as a Pioneer of Stealth in 2000, for {{his involvement in the}} Tacit Blue program, a plane that utilized stealth technology. [...] All of the information gained <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>program</b> was directly transferred to the B-2 program, as well as other aircraft designs. Thomas also did many spin tests on the F-5 program, including the first flight on the F-5F, at Edwards AFB, September 25, 1974; with a total of 107 spin tests to his credit. His [...] "hazardous high-angle-of-attack stall and spin testing in the F-5 established procedures now followed by fighter pilots around the world." [...] Thomas flew envelope expansion flight tests on all models of the F-5 Freedom Fighter. [...] He also spent time in Madrid, Spain helping the Spanish Air Force flight test the CASA 101.|$|E
2500|$|Because Aretha Franklin {{made the}} song “Respect” a hit, many who sampled {{and cover the}} song {{referred}} to Franklin’s version rather than Otis’s. For instance, Diana Ross & The Supremes and the Temptations made a cover of this song in their collaborated LP “Diana Ross & the Supremes Join the Temptations." [...] The Supremes were a female group consisting of Diana Ross, Mary Wilson, and Florence Ballard. Later this group would be known as Diana Ross & The Supremes. The Temptations, on the other hand, were a male group consisting of Eddie Kendricks, Paul Williams, Otis Williams, Melvin Franklin and Elbridge “Al” Bryant.” Both groups were signed under Berry Gordy’s Motown Record Label and it was Gordy’s idea to pair up his two most successful artists. With this collaborative LP, Gordy also organized a prime-time special TV program titled “TCB,” a commonly used abbreviation standing for “Taking Care of Business.” [...] Among the songs on the LP that were performed <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>program</b> included a cover of Aretha Franklin’s version of “Respect.” The two groups took Franklin’s message to new heights as the male versus female duet illustrated a battle of each gender demanding their own respect. Additionally, this cover highlights the Supremes’ own battle for racial equality. Much like Aretha Franklin, The Supremes’ rise to fame coincided with the Civil Rights Movement, in which these ladies used their fame and status {{in the fight for}} racial equality. The Supremes were the most successful Motown group to break down racial boundaries within the popular music industry. They represented racial integration, black empowerment, and black womanhood and their cover of “Respect” with the Temptations illustrates that.|$|E
2500|$|Labor for Victory: [...] In April 1942, Time {{magazine}} {{reported that}} the AFL (AFL) and the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) had agreed to a joint radio production, called Labor for Victory. [...] NBC agreed to run the weekly segment as a [...] "public service". The AFL and CIO presidents William Green and Philip Murray agreed to let their press chiefs, Philip Pearl and Len De Caux, alternate weeks between them to narrate. [...] The show ran on NBC radio on Saturdays 10:15–10:30 PM, starting on April 25, 1942. [...] Time wrote, [...] "De Caux and Pearl hope to make the Labor for Victory program popular enough for an indefinite run, using labor news, name speakers and interviews with workmen. Labor partisanship, they promise, is out." [...] Writers for Labor for Victory included: Peter Lyon, a progressive journalist; Millard Lampell (born Allan Sloane), later an American movie and television screenwriter; and Morton Wishengrad, {{who worked for the}} AFL. [...] For entertainment on CIO episodes, De Caux asked Woody Guthrie to contribute to the show. [...] "Personally, I {{would like to see a}} phonograph record made of your [...] "Girl in the Red, White, and Blue."" [...] However, the title appears in at least one collection of Guthrie records. [...] Guthrie consented and performed solo two or three times <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>program</b> (among several other WWII radio shows, including Answering You, Labor for Victory, Jazz in America, and We the People). [...] On August 29, 1942, he performed [...] "The Farmer-Labor Train", with lyrics he had written to the tune of [...] "Wabash Cannonball". (In 1948, he transformed the [...] "Wabash Cannonball" [...] again into [...] "The Wallace-Taylor Train" [...] for the 1948 Progressive National Convention, which nominated former U.S. Vice President Henry A. Wallace for president.) [...] The Almanac Singers (of which Guthrie and Lampell were co-founders) did appear (as they did on the U.S. Navy's (or U.S. Treasury's) The Treasury Hour and CBS Radio's We the People, later a television show). (Also, Marc Blitzstein's papers show that he made unclear contributions to four CIO episodes (dated June 20, June 27, August 1, August 15, 1948) of Labor for Victory.) [...] While Labor for Victory was a milestone in theory as a national platform, in practice it proved less so. [...] Only 35 of 104 NBC affiliates carried the show. [...] Episodes included the announcement that the show represented [...] "twelve million organized men and women, united in the high resolve to rid the world of Fascism in 1942". [...] Speakers included Donald E. Montgomery, then [...] "consumer's counselor" [...] at the U.S. Department of Agriculture.|$|E
