50|$|Second-order Linkwitz-Riley {{crossovers}} (LR2) have a 12 dB/octave (40 dB/decade) slope. They can {{be realized}} by cascading two <b>one-pole</b> filters, or using a Sallen Key filter topology with a Q0 value of 0.5. There is a 180° phase difference between the lowpass and highpass output of the filter, which can be corrected by inverting one signal. In loudspeakers this is usually done by reversing the polarity of one driver if the crossover is passive. For active crossovers inversion is usually done using a unity gain inverting op-amp.|$|E
50|$|The <b>one-pole</b> {{representation}} of a port will start to fail if there are significant ground plane loop currents. The assumption in the model is that the ground plane is perfectly conducting {{and that there is}} no potential difference between two locations on the ground plane. In reality, the ground plane is not perfectly conducting and loop currents in it will cause potential differences. If there is a potential difference between the commoned poles of two ports then the port condition is broken and the model is invalid.|$|E

50|$|Moment {{matching}} is a {{more sophisticated}} analytical method. It {{can be thought of}} as either matching multiple moments in the time domain, or finding a good rational approximation (a Padé approximation) in the frequency domain. (These are very closely related - see Laplace transform.) It can also be thought of a generalization of Elmore delay, which matches the first moment in the time domain (or computes a <b>one-pole</b> approximation in the frequency domain - they are equivalent). The first use of this technique, AWE, used explicit moment matching. Newer methods such as PRIMA and PVL use implicit moment matching, based on Krylov subspaces. These methods are slower than Elmore but more accurate. Compared to circuit simulation they are faster but less accurate.|$|E
5000|$|A first-order filter, for example, {{reduces the}} signal {{amplitude}} by half (so power reduces {{by a factor}} of 4, or 6 dB), every time the frequency doubles (goes up one octave); more precisely, the power rolloff approaches 20 dB per decade in the limit of high frequency. The magnitude Bode plot for a first-order filter looks like a horizontal line below the cutoff frequency, and a diagonal line above the cutoff frequency. There is also a [...] "knee curve" [...] at the boundary between the two, which smoothly transitions between the two straight line regions. If the transfer function of a first-order low-pass filter has a zero as well as a pole, the Bode plot flattens out again, at some maximum attenuation of high frequencies; such an effect is caused for example by {{a little bit of the}} input leaking around the <b>one-pole</b> filter; this one-pole-one-zero filter is still a first-order low-pass. See Pole-zero plot and RC circuit.|$|E
50|$|Rogers-Altmann is the {{daughter}} of Arnold Karplus, a well-known architect of Red Vienna, and his wife Else. From 1933 to 1938 her parents and she lived in the Steiner House in Vienna's 13th district, Hietzing, designed in 1910 by Adolf Loos for Lilly and Hugo Steiner, who lived here until 1927 when they moved to Paris. At a young age Ruth studied dance, directing and music at the Kunsakademie and performed professionally in Vienna. Her fine arts training began at the Frauenakademie and continued at the Kunstgewerbeschule as a student of professor Albert Paris Gütersloh, a well-known exponent of Jugendstil (Art Nouveau). Her fashion training was under professor Wimer, an international authority in the fashion world. Her passion for spontaneity of performance, rhythm in dance, and artists of her period like Schiele, Kokoschka and Klimt - as well as Picasso, in some of her later African-themed work - are continuing influences in her painting. She was an enthusiastic skier up until she was 90 years old, learning to ski at the Mathias Zdarsky school of skiing, where the <b>one-pole</b> method was taught. Due to the notoriety of her father, Rogers-Altmann had many contacts with architects and artists throughout her childhood and youth.|$|E

40|$|It {{will not}} be {{possible}} in this brief chapter to discuss all forms of IIR (infinite impulse response) digital filters and how quantization takes place in them. With a few simple examples however, {{it should be possible}} for the reader to be able to model the quantization process and to evaluate the effects of quantization noise at the outputs of specific IIR filters that may be of interest. We assume in this chapter that the coefficients of the filter are infinitely precisely given. In digital implementation, this {{will not be}} true – the consequences of imperfect accuracy in the coefficients are discussed in Chapter 21. 16. 1 A <b>ONE-POLE</b> DIGITAL FILTER A simple <b>one-pole</b> digital filter can be represented by the following difference equation. y(k) − ay(k − 1) = x(k).

40|$|We reanalyse {{the time}} {{evolution}} of the K 0 − ¯ K 0 system {{in the language of}} certain spectral function whose Fourier transforms give the time dependent survival and transition amplitudes. The reanalysis turned out to be necessary in view of the astonishing theorem by Khalfin on the possibility of vacuum regeneration of KS and KL. The main reason for this unexpected behaviour is the non-orthogonality of |KS 〉 and |KL〉. As a result of this theorem new contributions to the well known oscillatory terms will enter the time dependent transition probabilities. These new terms are not associated with small/large time behaviour of the amplitudes and therefore their magnitude is apriori unknown. Approximating the spectral functions by an <b>one-pole</b> ansatz Khalfin estimated the new effect in transition probabilities to be 4 × 10 − 4. Whereas we agree with Khalfin on the general existence of vacuum regeneration of KS and KL we disagree {{on the size of the}} effect. A careful analysis of the onepole approximation reveals that the effect is eleven orders of magnitude smaller than Khalfin’s estimate and, in principle, its exact determination lies outside the scope of the <b>one-pole</b> ansatz. The present paper gives also insight into the limitation of the validity of <b>one-pole</b> approximation, not only for small/large time scales, but also for intermediate times where new effects, albeit small, are possible. It will be shown that the same validity restrictions apply to the known formulae of Weisskopf-Wigner approximation as well. 1...|$|E
40|$|A planar small-size eight-band {{frequency}} reconfigurable antenna for LTE/WWAN {{mobile handset}} applications is proposed. The proposed antenna {{consists of a}} feeding strip and a coupled strip, with a total dimension of 10 × 29. 5 [*]mm 2. Reconfigurability is realized by incorporating a <b>one-pole</b> four-throw RF switch, which {{is embedded in the}} coupled strip and changes the resonant modes for the lower band. By combining four different working modes, the proposed antenna successfully realize the eight-band operation, covering the operating bands of 700 ~ 787 [*]MHz, 824 ~ 960 [*]MHz, and 1710 ~ 2690 [*]MHz. In addition, the simple DC bias circuit of the RF switch has little effect on the antenna performances, with no significant reduction in antenna efficiency and variations in the radiation patterns. The measured antenna efficiencies are 40 %~ 50 % and over 60 % for the lower band and the upper band, respectively. Prototypes of the proposed frequency reconfigurable antenna incorporating the <b>one-pole</b> four-throw switch are fabricated and measured. The measured results including return losses and radiation characteristics are presented...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{instability}} of RC active circuits containing non-ideal op-amps. It is very often that, when we design a circuit with a prescribed transfer function, installed RC active circuits are unstable, even though the designed transfer function itself is stable.
