40|$|This paper empirically {{investigates the}} effects of <b>capital</b> <b>injections</b> into Japanese banks, which {{were based on the}} Financial Function Stabilization Law and the Early Strengthening Law, on the capital crunch. Using {{financial}} panel data for all of the Japanese commercial banks, we estimate dynamic panel models which investigate {{the effects of}} <b>capital</b> <b>injections</b> on banks’ lending behaviour. We find a negative impact of <b>capital</b> <b>injections</b> on their lending behaviour. This finding is different from that of previous studies, which concluded that <b>capital</b> <b>injections</b> had positive effects. Though the <b>capital</b> <b>injections</b> were expected to free banks from capital regulatory constraint, Japanese banks that had received <b>capital</b> <b>injections</b> became more sensitive about their capital adequacy ratios, and reduced their loans; the exception was the domestic banks that received <b>capital</b> <b>injection</b> based on the Early Strengthening Law. The difference between success and failure {{has a lot to do}} with the frameworks of <b>capital</b> <b>injection</b> policies, suggesting that the manner of conducting <b>capital</b> <b>injection</b> policies and banking supervision is a very crucial matter. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the optimal dividend problem with proportional reinsurance and <b>capital</b> <b>injection</b> {{for a large}} insurance portfolio. In particular, the reinsurance premium {{is assumed to be}} calculated via the variance principle instead of the expected value principle. Our objective is to maximize the expectation of the discounted dividend payments minus the discounted costs of <b>capital</b> <b>injection.</b> This optimization problem is studied in four cases depending on whether <b>capital</b> <b>injection</b> is allowed and whether there exist restrictions on dividend policies. In all cases, closed-form expressions for the value function and optimal dividend and reinsurance policies are obtained. From the results, we see that the optimal dividend distribution policy is of threshold type with a constant barrier, and that the optimal ceded proportion of risk exponentially decreases with the initial surplus and remains constant when the initial surplus exceeds the dividend barrier. Furthermore, we show that the optimization problem without <b>capital</b> <b>injection</b> is the limiting case of the one with <b>capital</b> <b>injection</b> when the proportional transaction cost goes to infinity. © 2011 Elsevier B.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the portfolio selection and <b>capital</b> <b>injection</b> {{problem for a}} diffusion risk model within the classical Black–Scholes financial market. It is assumed that the original surplus process of an insurance portfolio is described by a drifted Brownian motion, and that the surplus can be invested in a risky asset and a risk-free asset. When the surplus hits zero, the company can inject capital to keep the surplus positive. In addition, {{it is assumed that}} both fixed and proportional costs are incurred upon each <b>capital</b> <b>injection.</b> Our objective is to minimize the expected value of the discounted <b>capital</b> <b>injection</b> costs by controlling the investment policy and the <b>capital</b> <b>injection</b> policy. We first prove the continuity of the value function and a verification theorem for the corresponding Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation. We then show that the optimal investment policy is a solution to a terminal value problem of an ordinary differential equation. In particular, explicit solutions are derived in some special cases and a series solution is obtained for the general case. Also, we propose a numerical method to solve the optimal investment and <b>capital</b> <b>injection</b> policies. Finally, a numerical study is carried out to illustrate the effect of the model parameters on the optimal policies...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effectiveness of}} bank recapitalization policies in Japan. Based on {{a reading of the}} "business revitalization plan" submitted by banks requesting government funds, we identify four primary goals for the <b>capital</b> <b>injection</b> plan in Japan: (1) to increase the bank capital ratios; (2) to increase write-offs of non-performing loans; (3) to increase lending, in particular to small and medium enterprises, in order to avoid a "credit crunch"; (4) to encourage restructuring. Using a panel of individual bank data, we empirically estimate the effectiveness of the Japanese government policy of public fund injection in achieving the first three of these stated goals. Our empirical analysis reveals that, in general, the <b>capital</b> <b>injections</b> into the large internationally active banks were more effective than those into the smaller domestic banks in Japan. In addition, the second round <b>capital</b> <b>injection,</b> administered in 1998, was more effective than the first round, administered in 1997. The first <b>capital</b> <b>injection</b> in 1997 mostly served as a stop-gap measure to help the large international banks clear the 8 % capital adequacy ratio (BIS ratio) required under the Basel Accord and did not make much contribution to the other policy objectives. The second round of <b>capital</b> <b>injections</b> in 1998 were more effective, boosting capital adequacy ratios for the domestic as well as international banks and supporting other policy objectives as well by stimulating banks to write off bad loans and increase domestic lending, in particular to small and medium enterprises. <b>Capital</b> <b>injection</b> Japanese Bank Systemic crisis Credit crunch Capital crunch Basel accord BIS ratio Capital adequacy...|$|R

40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{the implications of}} spread-adjusted Taylor rules and <b>capital</b> <b>injection</b> policies in response to adverse shocks to the economy, using {{a variant of the}} financial accelerator model. Our model comprises the two credit-constrained sectors that raise external finance under credit market imperfection: financial intermediaries (FIs) and entrepreneurs. With the model estimated using the U. S. data, we find that a spread-adjusted Taylor rule mitigates (amplifies) the impact of adverse shocks when the shock is accompanied by a widening (shrinking) of the corresponding spread. We formalize a <b>capital</b> <b>injection</b> policy as a positive (negative) amount of injection to either of the two sectors in response to an adverse shock (a favorable shock). In contrast to a spread-adjusted Taylor rule, a positive injection boosts the economy regardless of the type of shock. The <b>capital</b> <b>injection</b> to the FIs has a greater impact on the economy compared with that to the entrepreneurs.

40|$|In this thesis, we {{consider}} optimisation problems of {{an insurance company}} whose risk reserve process follows the settings of the classical risk model. The insurer has the possibility to control its surplus process by paying dividends to the shareholders. Furthermore, the shareholders are allowed to make <b>capital</b> <b>injections</b> such that the surplus process stays nonnegative. A control strategy describes the decision on the times {{and the amount of}} the dividend payments and the <b>capital</b> <b>injections.</b> To measure the risk associated with a control strategy, {{we consider}} the value of the expected discounted dividends minus the penalised expected discounted <b>capital</b> <b>injections.</b> Because of the discounting, it can only be optimal to make <b>capital</b> <b>injections</b> at times when the reserve would become negative due to a claim occurrence. Our goal is to determine the value function, which is defined as the maximal value over all proper strategies, and to find an optimal strategy which leads to this maximal value. First, we solve the optimisation problem for the classical risk model when the <b>capital</b> <b>injections</b> are penalised by some proportional factor greater than one. We show that an optimal strategy exists and is of barrier type, i. e., all the surplus exceeding some barrier level is paid as dividend. In the second part, we extend this model by adding fixed costs incurring any time at which <b>capital</b> <b>injections</b> are made. The optimal strategy here is not of barrier type any more, but of band type. That is a strategy where the state space of the surplus process is partitioned into three types of sets where either dividends at the premium rate, or lump sum dividends, or no dividends at all are paid. In the third part, we allow the dynamics of the surplus process to depend on environmental conditions which are modelled by a Markov process. I. e., the frequency of the claim arrivals and the distribution of the claim amounts vary over time depending {{on the state of the}} environment process. We again maximise the difference between the expected discounted dividends and the (proportional) penalised <b>capital</b> <b>injections</b> and show that the optimal strategy for any fixed initial environment state is of barrier type with a barrier depending on the initial state. ...|$|R
