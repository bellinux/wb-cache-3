The virtuous declaimer will neither persuade himself nor any other person to be content with a double mess of porridge, instead of a reasonable stipend for his services. We might as soon reconcile <b>ourselves</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Spartan community of goods and wives, to their iron coin, their long beards, or their black broth. There is a total dissimulation in the circumstances, as well as the manners, of society among us; and it is as ridiculous to seek for models in the simple ages of Greece and Rome, as it would be to go in quest of them among the Hottentots and Laplanders.|$|E
25|$|It is true {{there are}} cases in which, if we confine <b>ourselves</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> effects of the first order, the good will have an incontestable {{preponderance}} over the evil. Were the offence considered only under this point of view, {{it would not be}} easy to assign any good reasons to justify the rigour of the laws. Every thing depends upon the evil of the second order; it is this which gives to such actions the character of crime, and which makes punishment necessary. Let us take, for example, the physical desire of satisfying hunger. Let a beggar, pressed by hunger, steal from a rich man's house a loaf, which perhaps saves him from starving, can it be possible to compare the good which the thief acquires for himself, with the evil which the rich man suffers? … It is not on account of the evil of the first order {{that it is necessary to}} erect these actions into offences, but on account of the evil of the second order.|$|E

500|$|The Santa Fe National Forest's rocky {{terrain and}} steep {{inclines}} proved difficult for conventional camera equipment—such as cranes and dollies—which resulted {{in much of}} the film's scenes being shot by the camera operators, who were rigged to aerial ski lifts above the action. [...] "The location we picked was on top of the ski area above 12,000 feet in Santa Fe, and the high altitude made it extremely physically demanding", Schleissler explained. [...] "All our equipment had to be hand-carried into some of our remote locations, which meant we had to limit <b>ourselves</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bare minimum...No one ever hiked to the set empty-handed, including our producers. It was one big team effort that made us a close film family." ...|$|E
500|$|Pinkner and Wyman {{brought back}} the [...] "Cortexiphan kids", {{introduced}} {{in the first two}} seasons, because they felt that part of the storyline was really interesting. They wanted {{the end of the season}} to be a [...] "beautiful culmination of everything" [...] while traveling to the Other Side. The show had been developing a parallel universe storyline since its conception, but [...] "Over There" [...] marked the longest time spent in that world thus far. Pinker explained the idea of two worlds: [...] "One of the big themes of the show is how small choices that you make define you as a person and can change your life in large ways down the line." [...] Wyman said that the parallel universe [...] "is a reminder to our viewers that your life is what your choices are." [...] The two began discussing details about the Other Side early on, especially what the differences between the two universes would be. Pinkner commented in an interview with the Los Angeles Times that [...] "a lot of them are ideas that we jokingly threw out. Some of them, like the notion of zeppelins or the Statue of Liberty if we didn't let it oxidize or the Grand Central Hotel, we're not making up. Had the Hindenburg not blown up, zeppelins would be passenger air ships docking at the Empire State Building. That was the plan. We opened <b>ourselves</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> standard that it had to be possible." [...] Pinkner later elaborated, [...] "We're interested in world building and all that stuff is the texture that actually makes it a world. The richness of detail is what makes it feel real." [...] They used comic books as one way to subtly differentiate the two worlds. Goldsman, Wyman, and actor Joshua Jackson are longstanding comic book fans and decided to make the character of Peter a fan as well. Goldsman called on his friend Geoff Johns, Chief Creative Officer at DC Comics. He arranged for DC to specially design ten alternate covers for some of their most iconic editions, which were displayed in Peter's apartment on the Other Side. Visual effects company Eden FX created Peter's apartment and the alternate New York skyline visible outside his window. When fans reacted positively to these detailed characteristics written into the parallel universe, the producers stated their intention to show a lot more similar details in the third season.|$|E
