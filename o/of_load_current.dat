50|$|The {{function}} of this capacitor, {{known as a}} reservoir capacitor (or smoothing capacitor) is to lessen the variation in (or 'smooth') the rectified AC output voltage waveform from the bridge. There is still some variation, known as ripple. One explanation of 'smoothing' is that the capacitor provides {{a low impedance path}} to the AC component of the output, reducing the AC voltage across, and AC current through, the resistive load. In less technical terms, any drop in the output voltage and current of the bridge tends to be cancelled by loss of charge in the capacitor. This charge flows out as additional current through the load. Thus the change <b>of</b> <b>load</b> <b>current</b> and voltage is reduced relative to what would occur without the capacitor. Increases of voltage correspondingly store excess charge in the capacitor, thus moderating the change in output voltage / current.|$|E
30|$|Assume I L equals to 1 p.u. and {{the ratio}} of the series {{transformer}} is 1 : 1. As shown in Figs.  4 and 5, when D = cosφ, I Sh achieves zero, and I S equals to I L. When D > cosφ, I S will be smaller than I L because reactive current is injected from shunt converter with the opposite phase to the reactive component <b>of</b> <b>load</b> <b>current</b> during the voltage compensation using UPQC-SRI. When D < cosφ, although UPQC-SRI could compensate the voltage sag by reactive power injection, the shunt converter will inject reactive current with the same phase as the reactive component <b>of</b> <b>load</b> <b>current.</b> Then, the magnitude of system current will become larger than the load current. As the result, I S is likely greater than I L using UPQC-SRI, which would cause the overcurrent of UPQC.|$|E
