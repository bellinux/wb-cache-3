5|$|Educator Daniel Challener, in his 1997 book Stories of Resilience in Childhood, {{analyzed}} {{the events in}} Caged Bird to illustrate resiliency in children. Challener states that Angelou's book provides a useful framework for exploring the obstacles many children like Maya face and how a community helps these children succeed as Angelou did. Psychologist Chris Boyatzis has used Caged Bird to supplement scientific theory and research in the instruction <b>of</b> <b>child</b> <b>development</b> topics such as the development of self-concept and self-esteem, ego resilience, industry versus inferiority, effects of abuse, parenting styles, sibling and friendship relations, gender issues, cognitive development, puberty, and identity formation in adolescence. He has called the book a highly effective tool for providing real-life examples of these psychological concepts.|$|E
5|$|Robert Frank, a {{professor}} <b>of</b> <b>child</b> <b>development</b> at Oakton Community College in Illinois, {{conducted a study}} comparing households with a stay-at-home dad and households with a stay-at-home mom. His study concluded that women were still able to form a strong bond with their children despite working full-time outside the home. Also, women working full-time were often more engaged with their children {{on a day-to-day basis}} than their male counterparts. His study concluded that in a family with a stay-at-home dad arrangement, the maternal and paternal influences are equally strong. This contrasts with the more traditional family structure where the father works outside the home and the mother stays home with the children. In this type of arrangement, the mother's influence is extremely strong, whereas the father's is relatively small. The study found that both parents play an equal role in a child's development, but the stay-at-home dad arrangement is the most beneficial for the child.|$|E

25|$|Attachment {{theory has}} led to a new {{understanding}} <b>of</b> <b>child</b> <b>development.</b> Children develop different patterns of attachment based on experiences and interactions with their caregivers at a young age. Four different attachment classifications have been identified in children: secure attachment, anxious-ambivalent attachment, anxious-avoidant attachment, and disorganized attachment. Attachment theory has become the dominant theory used today in the study of infant and toddler behavior and in the fields of infant mental health, treatment of children, and related fields.|$|E

Other promising interventions for the promotion <b>of</b> early <b>child</b> <b>development</b> include children’s educational media, interventions with children at high risk, and combining the promotion <b>of</b> early <b>child</b> <b>development</b> with conditional cash transfer programmes. Effective investments in early <b>child</b> <b>development</b> have the potential to reduce inequalities perpetuated by poverty, poor nutrition, and restricted learning opportunities. A simulation model of the potential long-term economic effects of increasing preschool enrollment to 25 % or 50 % in every low-income and middle-income country showed a benefit-to-cost ratio ranging from 6 · 4 to 17 · 6, depending on preschool enrollment rate and discount rate...|$|R

25|$|Steiner's {{division}} <b>of</b> <b>child</b> <b>development</b> {{into three}} major stages {{is reflected in}} the schools' approach to early childhood education, which focuses on practical, hands-on activities and creative play; to elementary education, which focuses on developing artistic expression and social capacities; and to secondary education, which focuses on developing critical reasoning and empathic understanding. The overarching goal is to develop free, morally responsible, and integrated individuals equipped {{with a high degree of}} social competence. Qualitative assessments of student work are integrated into the daily life of the classroom, with quantitative testing playing a minimal role in primary education and standardized testing usually limited to that required for college entry. Individual teachers and schools have a great deal of autonomy in determining curriculum content, teaching methodology, and governance.|$|E

25|$|One of Montessori's many accomplishments was the Montessori method. This is {{a method}} of {{education}} for young children that stresses {{the development of a}} child's own initiative and natural abilities, especially through practical play. This method allowed children to develop at their own pace and provided educators with a new understanding <b>of</b> <b>child</b> <b>development.</b> Montessori's book, The Montessori Method, presents the method in detail. Educators who followed this model set up special environments {{to meet the needs of}} students in three developmentally-meaningful age groups: 2–2.5 years, 2.5–6 years, and 6–12 years. The students learn through activities that involve exploration, manipulations, order, repetition, abstraction, and communication. Teachers encourage children in the first two age groups to use their senses to explore and manipulate materials in their immediate environment. Children in the last age group deal with abstract concepts based on their newly developed powers of reasoning, imagination, and creativity.|$|E

40|$|Background: The social {{environment}} {{is a fundamental}} determinant <b>of</b> early <b>child</b> <b>development</b> and, in turn, early <b>child</b> <b>development</b> is a determinant of health, well-being, and learning skills across the life course. Redistributive policies aimed at reducing social inequalities, such as a welfare state and labour market policies, have shown a positive association with selected health indicators. In this study, we investigated the influence of redistributive policies specifically on the {{social environment}} <b>of</b> early <b>child</b> <b>development</b> in five countries with different political traditions. The objective of this analysis was to highlight similarities and differences in social and health services between the countries and their associations with other health outcomes that can inform better global early <b>child</b> <b>development</b> policies and improve early <b>child</b> health and <b>development.</b> Methods: Four social determinants <b>of</b> early <b>child</b> <b>development</b> were selected to provide a cross-section of key time periods in a child's life from prenatal to kindergarten. They included: 1) prenatal care, 2) maternal leave, 3) child health care, and 4) child care and early childhood education. We searched international databases and reports (e. g. Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, World Bank, and UNICEF) to obtain information about early <b>child</b> <b>development</b> policies, services and outcomes. Results: Although a comparative analysis cannot claim causation, our analysis suggests that redistributive policies aimed at reducing social inequalities {{are associated with a}} positive influence on the social determinants <b>of</b> early <b>child</b> <b>development.</b> Generous redistributive policies are associated with a higher maternal leave allowance and pay and more preventive child healthcare visits. A decreasing trend in infant mortality, low birth weight rate, and under five mortality rate were observed with an increase in redistributive policies. No clear influence of redistributive policies was observed on breastfeeding and immunization rates. In the analysis <b>of</b> <b>child</b> care and early education, the lack of uniform measures <b>of</b> early <b>child</b> <b>development</b> outcomes was apparent. Conclusions: This paper provides further support for an association between redistributive policies and early <b>child</b> health and <b>development</b> outcomes, along with the organization <b>of</b> early <b>child</b> health and <b>development</b> services...|$|R
25|$|Over time, {{alternative}} theories <b>of</b> <b>Child</b> <b>Development</b> {{have been}} put forward, and empirical findings {{have done a lot}} to undermine Piaget's theories. For example, Esther Thelen and colleagues found that babies would not make the A-not-B error if they had small weights added to their arms during {{the first phase of the}} experiment that were then removed before the second phase of the experiment. This minor change should not impact babies' understanding of object permanence, so the difference that this makes to babies' performance on the A-not-B task cannot be explained by Piagetian theory. Thelen and colleagues also found that various other factors also influenced performance on the A-not-B task (including strength of memory trace, salience of targets, waiting time and stance), and proposed that this could be better explained using a dynamic systems theory approach than using Piagetian theory. Alison Gopnik and Betty Repacholi found that babies as young as 18 months old can understand that other people have desires, and that these desires could be very different from their own desires. This strongly contradicts Piaget's view that children are very egocentric at this age. In reaction to these challenges, it has been argued that their criticisms depend on a fundamental misreading of Piaget's theory (Lourenço & Machado, 1996).|$|E
