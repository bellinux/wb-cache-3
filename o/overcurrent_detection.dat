2500|$|Circuit {{breakers}} {{are manufactured}} in standard sizes, using {{a system of}} preferred numbers to cover a range of ratings. Miniature circuit breakers have a fixed trip setting; changing the operating current value requires changing the whole circuit breaker. Larger circuit breakers can have adjustable trip settings, allowing standardized elements to be applied but with a setting intended to improve protection. For example, a circuit breaker with a 400 ampere [...] "frame size" [...] might have its <b>overcurrent</b> <b>detection</b> set to operate at only 300 amperes, to protect a feeder cable.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} comprehensive and integrated design methodology to optimize both the electrical {{and the economic}} performance of a utility power distribution system. The proposal is structured to facilitate its adoption and incorporation into the existing utility infrastructure by allowing the various portions of the new design to be implemented gradually into the existing infrastructure without the need to abandon the portions of the existing system that are performing satisfactorily. The topology of the substation plays {{a vital role in}} determining both the reliability and the economy of the distribution system. The ring bus topology is offered as the best topology design, and its characteristics as seen at the distribution level are examined. A key concept presented in this dissertation is that the distribution system must be optimized as a whole, not subsystem by subsystem. Optimizing the substation and the primary feeder system separately does not assure an optimal system; in fact, independent design of the two subsystems is likely to produce a non-optimal system laden with operational problems. An integrated approach is essential to assure optimum performance, and the integration process requires an iterative approach. This iterative approach is presented using an example. Innovative changes to the protection strategy of the feeder system can greatly enhance the reliability of the distribution system. The use of communication-based <b>overcurrent</b> <b>detection</b> is presented. This transmission-like scheme, when applied at the distribution level, improves both the reliability and the economy of the system substantially over traditional time-coordinated overcurrent protection philosophies. An application of these proposed innovations leads to the design of a hypothetical system, which is in turn analyzed from both electrical and economic perspectives...|$|E

This paper presents overcurrent protection and fault classification approach for series compensated transmission line using support vector machine (SVM). Postfault three lines current samples for half cycle are used as inputs to SVMs. The time taken for fault classification is 10 ms after the fault inception. Four SVMs are used; three SVMs (SVMa, SVMb and SVMc) are used for faulty phase detection and last SVM (SVMg) is used for ground detection. The polynomial kernel SVM {{is designed to provide}} the optimal classification conditions. Wide variations of load angle, fault inception angle, fault resistance and fault location have been carried out with different types of faults using EMTDC program. Backward faults have also been included in the data sets. The proposed technique is tested and the results verify the fastness, accuracy and robustness of it.

The results {{of the effort to}} implement this monitor are presented. The PMAD DC testbed is a reduced-scale prototype of the electrical power system {{to be used in the}} Space Station Freedom. The power is controlled by smart switches known as power control components (or switchgear). The power control components are currently coordinated by five Compaq 382 / 20 e computers connected through an 802. 4 local area network. One of these computers is designated as the control node with the other four acting as subsidiary controllers. The subsidiary controllers are connected to the power control components with a Mil-Std- 1553 network. An operator interface is supplied by adding a sixth computer. The power system monitor algorithm is comprised of several functions including: periodic data acquisition, data smoothing, system performance analysis, and status reporting. Data is collected from the switchgear sensors every 100 milliseconds, then passed through a 2 Hz digital filter. System performance analysis includes power interruption and <b>overcurrent</b> <b>detection.</b> The reporting mechanism notifies an operator of any abnormalities in the system. Once per second, the system monitor provides data to the control node for further processing, such as state estimation. The system monitor required a hardware time interrupt to activate the data acquisition function. The execution time of the code was optimized using an assembly language routine. The routine allows direct vectoring of the processor to Ada language procedures that perform periodic control activities. A summary of the advantages and side effects of this technique are discussed...|$|E

The thesis {{presents a}} gate driver stage with an advanced control algorithm for automotive traction power converters. The advanced control algorithm for predictive gate driving and protection {{is based on}} the study of semiconductor physics and other converter parts that influence the switching behavior. The advanced control algorithm incorporates a state observer to deliver sensorless junction temperature and phase current measurement, a lifetime consumption model, advanced switch protections and gate drive strength control to optimize electromagnetic noise and power losses. Also a gate driver hardware design based on a PLD and fast current sources is presented that enables the implementation of the developed control algorithm. The state observer is based on a simplified switch model and is built using two two-dimensional lookup tables. It is built as a direct model so measured characteristics can be used. The principle of operation is based on a sliding mode estimator with two inner loops estimating the switch current based on the plateau voltage and the on-state voltage drop across the switch. These two voltages are sampled corresponding during switching and on-state of the switch. The lifetime model is based on a Coffin-Manson lifetime model and uses temperature cycle detection for calculating life consumption. The junction temperature is derived from the state observer. As advanced protection a dynamic overcurrent protection is presented that enables switch protection / <b>overcurrent</b> <b>detection</b> during the switching event by monitoring the gate voltage. The expected plateau voltage is calculated by knowing the switch junction temperature and the expected switch current. The calculated plateau voltage is used to set a trip level for the gate voltage comparator. If the trip level is hit during switching an overcurrent event is detected and the switch is turned off safely. In addition switching times are monitored to detect abnormal switch behavior. Also a method for measuring the internal gate resistance of the semiconductor switch is presented. The principle of operation is by charging the gate with a known controlled current until a defined gate voltage is reached. Based on the measured time and gate capacitance the internal gate resistance is calculated. The advanced control algorithm also incorporates a gate drive strength control that enables voltage and/or current slope control during switching to optimize for overshoot at turn-off, EMC and power losses. The gate current is selected based on lookup tables and corrected by the estimated junction temperature and switch current. The thesis also present an experimental gate driver that enables testing of the presented methods. The gate driver is build using simple fast analog current sources witch are controlled by the FPGA. Fast feedback loops are implemented with three fast comparators for the gate voltage and the voltage across the switch. The trip level of the gate voltage comparator is controlled by the FPGA. Also two sample and hold units are implemented to allow event triggered gate voltage and on-state voltage measurement...|$|E
