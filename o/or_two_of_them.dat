500|$|Griswold {{first met}} Edgar Allan Poe in Philadelphia in May 1841 {{while working for}} the Daily Standard. At the outset, their {{relationship}} was cordial, at least superficially. In a letter dated March 29, 1841, Poe sent Griswold several poems for The Poets and Poetry of America anthology, writing {{that he would be}} proud to see [...] "one <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> in the book". Griswold included three of these poems: [...] "Coliseum", [...] "The Haunted Palace", and [...] "The Sleeper". In November of that year, Poe, who had previously praised Griswold in his [...] "Autography" [...] series as [...] "a gentleman of fine taste and sound judgment", wrote a critical review of the anthology, on Griswold's behalf. Griswold paid Poe for the review and used his influence to have it published in a Boston periodical. The review was generally favorable, although Poe questioned the inclusion of certain authors and the omission of others. Poe also said that Griswold [...] "unduly favored" [...] New England writers. Griswold had expected more praise and Poe privately told others he was not particularly impressed by the book, even calling it [...] "a most outrageous humbug" [...] in a letter to a friend. In another letter, this time to fellow writer Frederick W. Thomas, Poe suggested that Griswold's promise to help get the review published was actually a bribe for a favorable review, knowing Poe needed the money.|$|E
2500|$|Boon {{is said to}} have {{consumed}} 52 cans of beer on {{a flight}} from Sydney to London in 1989. This has never been confirmed by Boon, although the feat was confirmed by his teammate Geoff Lawson. Responding to the story, Greg Chappell said, [...] "In my day 58 [...] beers between London and Sydney would have virtually classified you as a teetotaller." [...] Boon has always denied the story, adding [...] "If people haven’t got something else to talk about they have led a fucking boring life", but, as Rob Smyth reported in The Guardian, [...] "there are enough witnesses, one <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> sober, to suggest that it happened".|$|E
2500|$|On September 4, 2013, the UPP Chairwoman Lee Jung-hee {{convened a}} press conference and told reporters that {{everything}} Lee Seok-ki and RO members said at the May 12 meeting was a [...] "joke." [...] "Among the 130 attendees, only one <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> mentioned weapons or destroying facilities, {{but it was a}} kind of a joke, and although some said things like that, the others just laughed," [...] the chairwoman said. Her comments conflicted with previous ones. When the prosecution first revealed the insurrection allegation, She and other UPP members said they were [...] "fabricated" [...] and even denied that the May 12 meeting took place.|$|E

2500|$|In many cities, most drivers do not {{own their}} own cycle rickshaws; instead, they rent them from their owners, some of whom own many cycle rickshaws. Driver-{{ownership}} rates vary widely. [...] In Delhi, a 1980 study found only one percent of drivers owned their vehicles, but ownership rates in several other Indian cities were much higher, including fifteen percent in Hyderabad and twenty-two percent in Faridabad. A 1977 study in Chiang Mai, Thailand found that 44% of cycle rickshaw drivers were owners. In Bangladesh, driver-ownership is usually highest in rural areas and lowest in the larger cities. Most cycle rickshaws in that country are owned by individuals who have only one <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> but some owners in the largest cities own several hundred.|$|E
2500|$|About {{three months}} since died M. Robert Greene, leaving many papers in sundry booksellers' hands, among other his Groatsworth of Wit, {{in which a}} letter written to divers play-makers is offensively by one <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> taken, and because on the dead they cannot be avenged, they willfully forge in their conceits a living author [...] With neither of them that take offence was I acquainted, and {{with one of them}} I care not if I never be. The other, whom at that time I did not so much spare as since I wish I had, for that, as I have moderated the heat of living writers and might have used my own {{discretion}} (especially in such a case, the author being dead), that I did not I am as sorry as if the original fault had been my fault, because myself have seen his demeanor no less civil than he excellent in the quality he professes. Besides, divers of worship have reported his uprightness of dealing, which argues his honesty, and his facetious grace in writing that approves his art.|$|E
2500|$|The {{custom of}} singing Baqashot {{originated}} in Spain towards {{the time of}} the expulsion, but took on increased momentum in the Kabbalistic circle in Safed in the 16th century. Baqashot probably evolved out of the tradition of saying petitionary prayers before dawn and was spread from Safed by the followers of Isaac Luria (16th century). [...] With the spread of Safed Kabbalistic doctrine, and coffee consumption—which allowed devotees to stay awake through the night—the singing of Baqashot reached countries all round the Mediterranean and became customary in the communities of Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, Rhodes, Greece, Yugoslavia, Egypt, Turkey and Syria. [...] It also influenced the Kabbalistically oriented confraternities in 18th-century Italy, and even became customary for a time in Sephardic communities in western Europe, such as Amsterdam and London. [...] (In Amsterdam the Shabbat service still begins with a small number of baqashot. [...] In London the tunes for one <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> have been preserved in the literature but the practice no longer exists.) [...] By the turn of the 20th century Baqashot had become a widespread religious practice in several communities in Jerusalem as a communal form of prayer.|$|E
