40|$|Research Services has {{completed}} exploratory research examining {{characteristics of students}} who are <b>overage</b> for grade level. The report reviews national literature of the characteristics of <b>overage</b> students. Local research was also conducted to examine the characteristics of Broward’s <b>overage</b> students. Data analyses included examination of demographic characteristics, mobility, retention, and academic achievement, for all <b>overage</b> students in the Broward school district. For a selected group, additional data were collected through case study methods. Specifically, detailed psycho-social factors were measured and examined. Findings indicate that black male {{students are more likely to}} be <b>overage</b> for grade level than are their peers. <b>Overage</b> students were also more likely to be limited English proficient, to participate in exceptional student education, and to qualify for free or reduced price lunch status. The <b>overage</b> student was likely to become <b>overage</b> through retention at a grade level one or two times during his or her academic career. These students were more likely to change schools during the school year. In middle school, the <b>overage</b> student attended school on fewer days than non-overage students. On standardized measures of academic performance, <b>overage</b> students do not perform as well as the overall student population in mathematics, reading, or writing...|$|R

50|$|The {{retrogression}} and reage (RRA) temper is a multistage {{heat treatment}} temper. Starting {{with a sheet}} in the T6 temper, it involves <b>overaging</b> past peak hardness (T6 temper) to near the T7 temper.

50|$|Precipitation hardening—When {{properly}} aged, lithium forms a metastable Al3Li phase (δ') with {{a coherent}} crystal structure. These precipitates strengthen the metal by impeding dislocation motion during deformation. The precipitates are not stable however and {{care must be}} taken to prevent <b>overaging</b> with the formation of the stable AlLi (β) phase. This also produces precipitate free zones (PFZs) typically at grain boundaries and can reduce the corrosion resistance of the alloy.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two aspects}} to surface integrity: {{topography}} characteristics and surface layer characteristics. The topography {{is made up}} of surface roughness, waviness, errors of form, and flaws. The surface layer characteristics that can change through processing are: plastic deformation, residual stresses, cracks, hardness, <b>overaging,</b> phase changes, recrystallization, intergranular attack, and hydrogen embrittlement. When a traditional manufacturing process is used, such as machining, the surface layer sustains local plastic deformation.|$|E

5000|$|T7 temper has an {{ultimate}} tensile strength of [...] and a yield strength of [...] It has a failure elongation of 13%. T7 temper is achieved by <b>overaging</b> (meaning aging past the peak hardness) the material. This is often accomplished by aging at 100-120 °C for several hours and then at 160-180 °C for 24 hours or more. The T7 temper produces a micro-structure of mostly eta precipitates. In contrast to the T6 temper, these eta particles are much larger and prefer growth along the grain boundaries. This reduces the susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking. T7 temper is equivalent to T73 temper.|$|E
50|$|High {{strength}} {{beryllium copper}} alloys contain {{as much as}} 2.7% beryllium (cast), or 1.6-2% beryllium with about 0.3% cobalt (wrought). The strength is achieved by age hardening. The thermal conductivity of these alloys lies between steels and aluminium. The cast alloys are frequently formed with injection molds. The wrought alloys are designated by UNS as C17200 to C17400, the cast alloys are C82000 to C82800. The hardening process requires rapid cooling of the annealed metal, resulting in a solid state solution of beryllium in copper, which is then kept at 200-460 °C {{for at least an}} hour, producing a precipitation of metastable beryllide crystals in the copper matrix. <b>Overaging</b> beyond the equilibrium phase depletes the beryllide crystals and reduces the strength. The beryllides in cast alloys are similar to those in wrought alloys.|$|E
50|$|Maraging steel's {{strength}} and malleability in the pre-aged stage {{allows it to}} be formed into thinner rocket and missile skins than other steels, reducing weight for a given strength. Maraging steels have very stable properties, and, even after <b>overaging</b> due to excessive temperature, only soften slightly. These alloys retain their properties at mildly elevated operating temperatures and have maximum service temperatures of over 400 °C F. They are suitable for engine components, such as crankshafts and gears, and the firing pins of automatic weapons that cycle from hot to cool repeatedly while under substantial load. Their uniform expansion and easy machinability before aging make maraging steel useful in high-wear components of assembly lines and dies. Other ultra-high-strength steels, such as AerMet alloys, are not as machinable because of their carbide content.|$|E

Dry powder inhalers (DPI) for beclomethasone dipropionate were prepared with different grades of lactose monohydrate. The influence of carrier and <b>overages</b> on performance of DPI was studied. Metered dose inhalers (MDI) with HFA based propellants were formulated with various doses, <b>overages</b> and different concentrations of alcohol. Formulated DPI and MDI were evaluated for various official and unofficial quality control tests. The influence of over doses on valve delivery, effect of <b>overages</b> on emitted dose and influence of alcohol on spray pattern from MDI were studied. The better fine particle fraction and emitted dose were obtained from the DPI formulated with 10 : 90 ratio of fine lactose: coarse lactose and with 20 % w/w <b>overages.</b> The studies on MDI revealed that the 15 % of overdoses are required for effective valve delivery and 20 % <b>overages</b> are required for 100 % drug delivery. 5 - 10 %v/v alcohol was found to be preferable to get optimum emitted dose and fine particle fraction...|$|R
50|$|The {{steel is}} first {{annealed}} at approximately 820 C for 15-30 minutes for thin sections and for 1 hour per 25 mm thickness for heavy sections, to ensure {{formation of a}} fully austenitized structure. This is followed by air cooling to room temperature to form a soft, heavily-dislocated iron-nickel lath (untwinned) martensite. Subsequent aging (precipitation hardening) of the more common alloys for approximately 3 hours at a temperature of 480 to 500 °C produces a fine dispersion of Ni3(X,Y) intermetallic phases along dislocations left by martensitic transformation, where X and Y are solute elements added for such precipitation. <b>Overaging</b> leads {{to a reduction in}} stability of the primary, metastable, coherent precipitates, leading to their dissolution and replacement with semi-coherent Laves phases such as Fe2Ni/Fe2Mo. Further excessive heat-treatment brings about the decomposition of the martensite and reversion to austenite.|$|E
40|$|A {{controlled}} <b>overaging</b> {{process is}} proposed to increase region II fatigue crack propagation resistance of 2024 -T 3 aluminium alloy. <b>Overaging</b> {{was achieved by}} subjecting the material from the initial T 3 state to heat treatment at specific aging temperatures resulting in substantial reduction in hardness. Fatigue crack growth tests were subsequently performed in the intermediate region to assess the influence of aging treatment on fatigue crack propagation rate. The experimental results showed that <b>overaging</b> at high temperatures enhances the fatigue crack growth resistance of the material with regard to initial T 3 state. Fatigue crack growth rates were found to decrease with increasing <b>overaging</b> temperature.

The purpose of this bounded case study was to determine educators 2 ̆ 7 perspectives of possible intervention strategies to improve the academic performance of <b>overage</b> students in grades 9 and 10 at the school. Constructivism was used as the conceptual framework. The research questions were focused on what teachers, counselors, and administrators viewed as the best possible intervention for improving the academic performance of <b>overage</b> students at the school. Interviews were conducted with 4 classroom teachers, 2 counselors, and 2 administrators who had worked with <b>overage</b> students at the school. Interview data were coded and analyzed for common themes.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the relationship between plane strain fracture toughness, KIc, the tensile properties, and the microstructure of the overaged 7449 aluminum-plate alloy, and compares them to the 7150 alloy. The 7449 alloy has a higher content of ??/? precipitates; and, the 7150 alloy contains a greater amount of coarse intermetallic particles, as it contains an appreciable amount of coarse S phase (Al 2 CuMg), which is largely absent in the 7449 alloy. The toughness of the alloys shows an increase on <b>overaging,</b> and the 7449 alloy shows a reasonably linear toughness—yield strength relation on extended <b>overaging.</b> Several mechanisms of failure occur: coarse voiding at intermetallics and a combined intergranular/transgranular shear fracture mode, with the former becoming more important as <b>overaging</b> progresses. Drawbacks of existing models for toughness are discussed, and a new model for plane strain fracture toughness, based on the microstructurally dependent work-hardening factor, KA, introduced in Ashby's theory of work hardening, is developed.
