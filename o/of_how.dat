50|$|His primary aim in {{teaching}} was to provoke in his students {{a fundamental shift}} in sensibility and perspective from the mode of Critical intellection and reflection that characterizes Modernity and predominates in the academic world, to what he and Michael Polanyi called a Post-Critical mode of thinking. Instead of attending solely to the what of a topic (an item of content, a teaching, a matter {{to be subjected to}} intellectual mastery and critique as an indifferent object of thought), the shift involves becoming aware <b>of</b> the <b>how</b> <b>of</b> intellection itself — specifically <b>of</b> the <b>how</b> <b>of</b> one's responsive relationship as person in the world to the object <b>of</b> thought—of <b>how</b> one personally happens to be relating oneself to it. That <b>how</b> <b>of</b> intellection, the <b>how</b> <b>of</b> one's personal relation to the object of thought—in other words, the underlying relationship between knower and known—is predominantly tacit, difficult to articulate, and therefore not something on which one can easily reflect, which causes it to be all the more potentially consequential in the process of knowing.|$|R
