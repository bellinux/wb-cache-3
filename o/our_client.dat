500|$|The {{casting process}} {{continued}} into much of 2010, with the additions of Jeremy Renner, Mark Ruffalo, and Clark Gregg. Ruffalo replaced Edward Norton, whom Marvel declined to have back. [...] "We {{have made the}} decision to not bring Ed Norton back to portray the title role of Bruce Banner in The Avengers," [...] stated Feige. [...] "Our decision is definitely not one based on monetary factors, but instead rooted in the need for an actor who embodies the creativity and collaborative spirit of our other talented cast members. The Avengers demands players who thrive working as part of an ensemble, as evidenced by Robert, Chris H, Chris E, Samuel, Scarlett, and all of our talented casts. We are looking to announce a name actor who fulfills these requirements, and is passionate about the iconic role in the coming weeks." [...] In response, Norton's agent Brian Swardstrom decried Feige's statement, calling it [...] "purposefully misleading" [...] and an [...] "inappropriate attempt to paint <b>our</b> <b>client</b> in a negative light". In October 2014, Norton claimed it was his own decision never to play Hulk again because he [...] "wanted more diversity" [...] with his career, {{and did not want to}} be associated with only one character.|$|E

Allan reiterated her belief that Pistorius had taken acting lessons and highlighted his alleged relationship with a 19-year-old this year. A spokesperson for the Pistorius family has denied the claim that Pistorius took acting lessons. Anneliese Burgess, the media manager for the Pistorius family said the claims were [...] "fictitious" [...] and [...] "totally devoid of any truth". Burgess continued [...] "We deny in the strongest terms the contents of her letter in as far it relates to <b>our</b> <b>client</b> and further deny that <b>our</b> <b>client</b> has undergone any acting lessons or any form of emotional coaching." [...] Allan's claims have been reported internationally, appearing in respected newspapers such as France's Le Figaro, Spain's El País and Italy's La Stampa.|$|E
