40|$|The {{mitral valve}} is placed between the left atrium and ventricle. Both intra {{ventricular}} blood flow {{as well as}} valve dynamics are often subject to research. However, the inlet properties for such flows, which are created within the left atrium, are often replaced by simplified boundary conditions close to or on the mitral valve. As the number of pulmonary veins as well as orifice size and location is known to vary between individuals, this report aims to study the effect of altered pulmonary vein locations on the trans-mitral and intra atrial blood flow. This work is based on previous work and studies done by Sigrid Kaarstad Dahl and her colleagues, and the author himself. During previous studies, the pulmonary veins seemed {{to play an important}} role in the forming of the intra atrial vortices. Two dimensional simulations were extended to include variations of pulmonary vein size and location. Furthermore, a three dimensional model is created with the use of magnetic resonance imaging and three different pulmonary vein locations are tested. The atrial systole is simulated with the Fluent software with mass flow boundary inlets at the pulmonary veins and a simplified ventricle represented by a long <b>outlet</b> <b>funnel.</b> The simulations show clear differences in the formation of the intra atrial vortices, both in location and shape. Furthermore, trans-mitral flow pattern is showing to depend on the intra atrial vortices. </p...|$|E
40|$|Current {{wind power}} {{technology}} is not economically feasible {{throughout most of}} the United States due to low average wind speeds. A design for a small-scale wind concentrator device suitable for use in areas of low wind velocity was tested using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Using a novel approach, the device seeks to accelerate incoming air above minimum velocities required for economical power generation. The novel approach employs a funnel shaped inlet with relief vents along the circumference, so as to alleviate backpressure. Both inlet and <b>outlet</b> sections utilize <b>funnel</b> shapes with both parabolic and hyperbolic regions. All geometry and mesh models were created using ICEM 12. 1. Simulations were performed using Fluent 12. 1. 2. Turbulence was modeled using the standard k-epsilon model. All mesh models contained roughly 500, 000 unstructured computational cells. CFD simulations predict a 2. 53 X acceleration of incoming air through the throat of the device (based upon a 2 m/s ambient wind speed). Similar performance was seen across the range of 1 - 12 m/s. Analysis focused on testing various designs to reduce losses due to turbulent energy and backpressure, with a focus on maximizing the throat velocity where a turbine can be located. Tested variables include funnel shape, lengths of both inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>funnels,</b> and curvature of the inlet rim. In addition to design of the device, the effect on airflow through the relief vents by a surrounding casing was also analyzed...|$|R
40|$|The Central Wetlands Unit (CWU), {{covering}} 12, 000 hectares in St. Bernard and Orleans Parishes, Louisiana, {{was once}} a healthy baldcypressâ€“water tupelo swamp and fresh and low salinity marsh before construction of levees isolated the region from Mississippi River floodwaters. Construction of the Mississippi River Gulf <b>Outlet</b> (MRGO), which <b>funneled</b> saltwater inland from the Gulf of Mexico, resulted in a drastic ecosystem change and caused mortality of almost all trees and low salinity marsh, but closure of the MRGO has led to decreases in soil and surface water salinity. Currently, the area is open water, brackish marsh, and remnant baldcypress stands. We measured hydrology, soils, water and sediment chemistry, vegetation composition and productivity, accretion, and soil strength to determine relative health of the wetlands. Vegetation species richness is low and above- and belowground biomass is up to 50 % lower than a healthy marsh. Soil strength and bulk density are low {{over much of the}} area. A baldcypress wetland remains near a stormwater pumping station that also has received treated municipal effluent for about four decades. Based on the current health of the CWU, three restoration approaches are recommended, including: (1) mineral sediment input to increase elevation and soil strength; (2) nutrient-rich fresh water to increase productivity and buffer salinity; and (3) planting of freshwater forests, along with fresh and low salinity herbaceous vegetation...|$|R
