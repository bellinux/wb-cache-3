5|$|Conditions {{were dry}} for {{qualifying}} <b>on</b> <b>Saturday</b> <b>afternoon.</b> Qualifying {{consisted of three}} parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with five drivers eliminated from competing after {{each of the first}} two sessions. Only the two Mercedes drivers were capable of proceeding into the second part of qualifying (Q2) without having to use the faster, soft tyres. Nico Rosberg was fastest, ahead of Williams' Valtteri Bottas and Lewis Hamilton. As Carlos Sainz was unable to compete following his crash in practice, only four running drivers were eliminated. Those were both Marussia drivers, the Sauber of Marcus Ericsson and Fernando Alonso for McLaren.|$|E

5|$|Two {{practice}} sessions were held before the race; {{the first was}} held on Friday morning, with the second held on Saturday morning. Both were held in damp conditions due to overnight rain with the track drying towards {{the conclusion of the}} respective sessions. Both sessions lasted 1hour and 45minutes. Qualifying was split into two one-hour sessions; the first was held on Friday afternoon with the second held <b>on</b> <b>Saturday</b> <b>afternoon.</b> The fastest time from either of the two qualifying sessions counted towards their final grid position.|$|E
5|$|Qualifying {{got under}} way <b>on</b> <b>Saturday</b> <b>afternoon</b> with new rules in place. Just as in years before, the {{qualifying}} procedure was divided into three parts, with the first part (Q1) running for 16 minutes and {{the second and third}} parts (Q2 and Q3) being 15 and 14 minutes long respectively. All twenty-two cars contested the first part, with seven drivers eliminated from further contention in each of the first two parts of qualifying, leaving eight drivers to compete for pole position in Q3. However, in a change of rules, drivers were now eliminated during the session, with the slowest runner at a given point being taken out from contention every ninety seconds, beginning seven minutes into Q1, six minutes into Q2 and five minutes into Q3.|$|E

5|$|White never {{remarried}} {{following his}} wife's death in 1915. In addition to White's church activities, {{he served as}} a master of the Masonic Lodge, and was affiliated with the Odd Fellows. Beginning in 1934, White endured 18 months of illness, and on August 14, 1935, his physician Dr. R. W. Dailey reported to the Cumberland Evening Times that he was in critical condition and was unlikely to recover. White succumbed to his illness and died at his residence in Romney on August 15, 1935 at the age of 59 as a result of arteriosclerosis. Myocarditis also contributed to his prolonged illness but was not the cause of his death. White was interred with Masonic rites <b>on</b> <b>Saturday</b> <b>afternoon,</b> August 17, 1935 at Indian Mound Cemetery in Romney. A number of state officials attended his funeral.|$|E
5|$|In Mexico, tens of {{thousands}} of tourists and residents were evacuated from the beach resorts in and around Cancún, the Riviera Maya, and Cozumel. Hotel guests were evacuated <b>on</b> <b>Saturday</b> <b>afternoon,</b> and staff on Sunday afternoon. Though some hotel guests in second floor rooms and above were given the option to be bussed into the center of Cancun to safe houses and shelters or to stay and wait out the storm in only the modern built hotels and resorts. Most of the remaining guests were restricted to their rooms and were not allowed out on the beach areas. No alcohol was sold in Cancun for 36hours prior to the arrival of the storm, in an attempt to avoid drunken tourists being injured during the night. Two helicopter pilots were killed when their aircraft crashed while evacuating offshore oil platforms operated by Pemex. A German resident was electrocuted while on his roof in Playa del Carmen.|$|E
5|$|On Friday {{afternoon}} Kyle Busch was fastest in {{the second}} practice session {{with a time of}} 29.378 seconds, ahead of Kahne and Robby Gordon.

Travis Kvapil was fourth-fastest; David Gilliland was fifth and Biffle sixth. Johnson, Newman, Hornish and Edwards followed in the top ten. Kyle Busch scraped the outside wall while driving up the track; he sustained minor damage and did not switch to a back-up car. Later that day, Kahne paced the final practice session with a time of 30.580 seconds; Edwards was second and Paul Menard third. Gordon was fourth-fastest, ahead of Hendrick Motorsports teammates Johnson and Earnhardt. Reutimann was seventh-fastest, Biffle eighth, Bowyer ninth, and Dave Blaney tenth. Bowyer moved to the outside of the track but was unable to steer left and hit the outside wall leaving turn-two and into the backstretch; he came down the track and Kyle Petty hit Bowyer and damaged his front-left fender before Bowyer's car stopped after he made contact with the inside wall. Bowyer was required to use a back-up car but Petty was able to repair his chassis.|$|E
5|$|Plans for an IndyCar Series race in Brazil were {{confirmed}} on 25 November 2009, with authorities in São Paulo and the Indy Racing League agreeing {{to a deal}} {{for the city to}} host the series. Race details for the São Paulo Indy 300 were announced on 25 January 2010. It was the first American open-wheel race in the country since the Rio 200 at Jacarepaguá in 2000. Despite a lengthy distance to travel from most team bases, the event promoters offered each team a six-figure sum of money, as well as paying for all expenses. A total of seven Brazilian drivers would compete in the race, including Ana Beatriz, Hélio Castroneves, Tony Kanaan, Raphael Matos, Vitor Meira, Mario Moraes and Mario Romancini. Of those seven, four drivers—Beatriz, Castroneves, Moraes and Romancini—are natives of São Paulo. The race weekend was scheduled to have two practice sessions on Saturday morning, qualifications <b>on</b> <b>Saturday</b> <b>afternoon</b> with the race on Sunday afternoon. In preparation for the race weekend, the public roads that made up areas of the track were closed off just before midnight on Friday evening.|$|E
5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions—two on Friday and a {{third on}} Saturday—were held before the main Sunday race. The Friday afternoon and evening sessions each lasted ninety minutes. The third session was held <b>on</b> <b>Saturday</b> <b>afternoon</b> and lasted an hour. The first practice session was initially held on a wet track with a clear sky after rainstorms {{earlier in the day}} left standing water on parts of the circuit, and high humidity slowed the drying process. These conditions meant drivers used intermediate tyres first before dry tyres were utilised in the session's closing minutes. Webber set the fastest time of the first session with a late lap of 1 minute and 54.589 seconds, one-tenth of a second faster than Michael Schumacher in second who was briefly quickest before Webber set his lap. Adrian Sutil, with a lap of 1:58.827, was third fastest, ahead of Vettel and Jaime Alguersuari. Button, Vitantonio Liuzzi, Sébastien Buemi, Kubica, and Vitaly Petrov rounded out the session's top ten fastest drivers.|$|E

5|$|Loeb, driving an all new Citroën C4 WRC car {{which had}} been in {{development}} throughout 2006, {{took control of the}} race from the outset, winning the two stages on the first day and four more stages over the following three days. His teammate Sordo kept the pressure on, winning three stages, but on Stage 6, Loeb extended his lead from 6.6 seconds to nearly 24 seconds, and from thereon became unattainable. Each stage on the first two Legs were won by either Loeb or Sordo, and it wasn't until Saturday afternoon on the second run of the day's stages, that other drivers could effectively challenge them. The last two days of the race consisted of a duel between Mikko Hirvonen, who drove a factory 2006 model Ford Focus RS WRC, and Chris Atkinson in a factory Subaru Impreza WRC 2006. After Hirvonen completed Stage 2 in fourth place, Atkinson took the position on Stage 3 and held onto it throughout Friday and into Saturday morning's stages. On Stage 12 <b>on</b> <b>Saturday</b> <b>afternoon,</b> Hirvonen retook fourth, Atkinson regained it on Stage 13 but then lost it to Hirvonen again following Stage 14. Atkinson won the final stage on Sunday morning, and finished the race back in fourth position.|$|E
5|$|Qualifying {{consisted}} of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with five drivers eliminated from competing after {{each of the first}} two sessions. Before qualifying began <b>on</b> <b>Saturday</b> <b>afternoon,</b> Mercedes was forced to change the power unit in Nico Rosberg's car back to the one used in Belgium, which had already run for six full races, after finding an issue with the new specification unit. Meanwhile, Lotus was forced to borrow tyre blankets from other teams, as their own had been rendered unusable by rain during the night. When the session began, Nico Hülkenberg {{was one of the first}} out on track, but his fast lap was disrupted by Marcus Ericsson, who was later penalised for the incident. Both Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen spent most of the session in the pit lane. While Ricciardo was able to get out and set a lap sufficient to see him proceed to the second part of qualifying (Q2), Verstappen went out only to see his engine cover blown off at Curva Grande, scattering the track with debris, though at the very end of the session, so no other cars were affected. Next to Verstappen, both Manor Marussia and McLaren drivers were eliminated.|$|E
5|$|Rain hit {{the circuit}} <b>on</b> <b>Saturday</b> <b>afternoon,</b> ending {{three hours before}} the session started, {{resulting}} in several damp patches on the circuit though the air temperature remained hot. Different sections of the circuit dried out at different rates {{making it difficult for}} drivers to tell precisely how wet or dry certain corners were. The teams ran intermediate tyres before switching to the super-soft tyre as the session progressed. Some drivers ran deep into turn five. Vettel was the fastest driver of the session with a time of 1:48.028 set in the last twenty minutes of the one-hour period. The time was four-tenths faster than championship rival Alonso. Hamilton was third fastest, two-thousandths of a second in front of Massa. Rosberg was fifth, ahead of Webber and Nico Hülkenberg. Kubica, Sutil and Buemi completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. Hispania Racing driver Bruno Senna's right-rear tyre got onto a white line at the Singapore Sling chicane and spun. Senna later brushed a wall entering the Esplanade Bridge in the final minute and stopped his car, causing the yellow-flags to be shown; drivers were unable to improve on their lap times because of the limited time available.|$|E
