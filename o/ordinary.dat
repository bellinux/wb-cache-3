5|$|The {{remaining}} 4.9% of the mass–energy of the Universe is <b>ordinary</b> matter, that is, atoms, ions, {{electrons and}} the objects they form. This matter includes stars, which produce {{nearly all of}} the light we see from galaxies, as well as interstellar gas in the interstellar and intergalactic media, planets, and all the objects from everyday life that we can bump into, touch or squeeze. As a matter of fact, the great majority of <b>ordinary</b> matter in the universe is unseen, since visible stars and gas inside galaxies and clusters account for less than 10 per cent of the <b>ordinary</b> matter contribution to the mass-energy density of the universe.|$|E
5|$|A set of {{elements}} under two binary operations, + and −, {{is called a}} Euclidean domain if it forms a commutative ring R and, roughly speaking, if a generalized Euclidean algorithm can be performed on them. The two operations of such a ring need not be the addition and multiplication of <b>ordinary</b> arithmetic; rather, they can be more general, such as the operations of a mathematical group or monoid. Nevertheless, these general operations should respect many of the laws governing <b>ordinary</b> arithmetic, such as commutativity, associativity and distributivity.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the sense}} that the word is used in The Damoiselle and in English Renaissance drama generally, an [...] "ordinary" [...] is a public eating establishment, {{comparable}} to modern restaurants and cafeterias. One source defines <b>ordinaries</b> as [...] "Eating-houses with table d'hôtes" [...] sic. <b>Ordinaries</b> were generally classed with taverns as similar institutions, though taverns were primarily purveyors of alcoholic drinks and only secondarily of food, while <b>ordinaries</b> reversed that priority. (Like taverns, <b>ordinaries</b> could serve as venues for other activities as well; in his play Brome refers to [...] "gaming" [...] and [...] "bawdry" [...] and [...] "other by-ways of expense.") ...|$|R

5|$|In addition, stars may be {{classified}} by the luminosity effects {{found in their}} spectral lines, which correspond to their spatial size and is determined by their surface gravity. These range from 0 (hypergiants) through III (giants) to V (main sequence dwarfs); some authors add VII (white dwarfs). Most stars belong to the main sequence, which consists of <b>ordinary</b> hydrogen-burning stars. These fall along a narrow, diagonal band when graphed according to their absolute magnitude and spectral type. The Sun is a main sequence G2V yellow dwarf of intermediate temperature and <b>ordinary</b> size.|$|E
5|$|In physics, {{string theory}} is a {{theoretical}} framework in which the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings. These strings look like small segments or loops of <b>ordinary</b> string. String theory describes how strings propagate through space and interact with each other. On distance scales larger than the string scale, a string will look just like an <b>ordinary</b> particle, with its mass, charge, and other properties determined by the vibrational state of the string. Splitting and recombination of strings correspond to particle emission and absorption, giving rise to the interactions between particles.|$|E
