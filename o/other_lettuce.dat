40|$|This NebGuide {{discusses}} different salad greens, their {{uses and}} nutritional value. Lettuce {{has been an}} important part of human diets since ancient times. It was customary for the Romans to precede their gargantuan banquets with refreshing lettuce salads in the belief that lettuce enhanced the appetite and relaxed the alimentary canal. It had other uses, too. Dried lettuce juice was used to aid sleep in Elizabethan times and through World War II lactucarium, a sedative made from wild lettuce extracts, was used in hospitals¹. Today, lettuce is used as the main ingredient in most salads and it is joined by a variety of other salad greens. Salad greens are easy to grow in the home garden and are an important source of vitamins and minerals in our diets. Dark green leaves are good sources of vitamins A and C, iron, folic acid, and calcium.

40|$|The {{specific}} objectives {{of this study}} were {{to determine the effects of}} increasing salinity on growth, crop quality, and physiological parameters of different lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) cultivars grown either in a hydroponic system or in soil and subjected to irrigation water of varying salinity levels. Two trials were conducted in winter 2016 and summer 2016 in a greenhouse using a hydroponic system for the cultivation of three lettuce cultivars. 'Romaine del Sol', Leaf Lettuce 'Bergams Green' and 'Green Leaf Lettuce' were exposed to irrigation water with increasing salinity (2. 1, 3. 6, 5. 1, and 6. 6 dS/m) by supplementing the nutrient solution (2. 1 dS/m) with a combination of 2 : 1 NaCl and CaCl 2. Lettuce head height, diameter, leaf number, shoot and root dry weight were not impacted by increasing salinity. Similarly, osmotic potential, transpiration and leaf temperature were not affected. However, head fresh weight and water content were reduced at the higher salinity levels compared to the control in the second trial. A third greenhouse trial was conducted in winter 2017 with 'Romaine del Sol' and 'Green Leaf Lettuce' cultivars grown in a hydroponics system or in containers with soil to determine tolerance to increasing salinity in different substrates. Head height, diameter, and shoot dry mass decreased at the two highest salinity levels at the final harvest. When plants were smaller, salinity had no effect on these variables. Fresh weight, water content, and leaf number decreased with increasing salinity at final harvest for both cultivars however, osmotic potential of both cultivars was not affected by salinity or substrate throughout the study. An informal taste test found that the leaves from the two highest levels of salinity from both cultivars were inedible because of a salty and bitter taste. Mineral concentration of sodium and chloride in ‘Romaine’ and 'Green Leaf Lettuce' increased as salinity levels increased, and plants of both cultivars grown in soil had greater concentrations of both elements when compared to hydroponics. 'Romaine' and 'Green Leaf Lettuce' are more tolerant to salinity than previously reported in <b>other</b> <b>lettuce</b> cultivars, and the physiological variables measured showed little changes in response to increasing salinity. Although lettuce grown at 5. 1 dS/m and 6. 6 dS/m was marginally acceptable by size standards, the lack of head formation in ‘Romaine del Sol’, and the unfavorable taste of both cultivars would render them unmarketable...|$|E
40|$|Listeria monocytogenes es uno de los patógenos más importantes de origen alimentario; siendo los vegetales la via mas común en la transmisión de esta {{bacteria}}, desde el {{medio ambiente}} a los humanos. Las hortalizas como lechuga y repollo al ser contaminadas por una inadecuada manipulación actuarían como vehículos de transmisión de este patógeno, por lo que el propósito de la presente investigación fue determinar la frecuencia de aislamiento de Listeria monocytogenes en repollo y lechuga que se expende en los mercados Hermelinda, Central y Palermo de la ciudad de Trujillo. Para tal fin se aplicó un diseño de una sola casilla, con estudio observacional y transversal, y un diseño de muestreo estratificado, aleatorio y polietápico. Se calculo el tamaño de muestra (n = 54) mediante la fórmula de proporciones para población finita y varianza desconocida, procediéndose luego a un reparto proporcional de la muestra, entre los tres mercados estudiados. Todos los cultivos aislados fueron identificados mediante las pruebas establecidas en el Bergey´s Manual of Determination Bacteriology y además por el Sistema Automatizado Micro Scam Walk Away y mediante Caracterización Molecular. Las diferencias de frecuencias se probó mediante el Test de Proporciones, con α = 0. 05. Los resultados confirman la presencia de la bacteria en estas verduras, y de las 54 muestras, 12 son positivas (22. 22 %). En la presesente investigación se concluye que: Listeria monocytogenes esta presente en repollo y lechuga procedentes de los mercados Hermelinda, Palermo y Central de la ciudad de Trujillo. La frecuencia relativa expresada en porcentaje para lechuga es la misma en los tres mercados (16. 67 %) y la frecuencia relativa es mayor en el mercado Palermo (8. 33 %) que en el mercado la Hermelinda (5. 56 %). La frecuencia de Listeria monocytogenes es mayor en lechuga que en repollo en los tres mercados estudiados. Estadísticamente, con un nivel de confianza del 95, se prueba que las frecuencias relativas de la presencia de Listeria monocytogenes, en los tres mercados es homogénea. Listeria monocytogenes is widely distributed in nature, {{and is one}} of the most important pathogens of feeding source. The most common transition of this bacteria from the environment to humans; including among others, raw vegetables, like lettuce and cabbage; presuming that the contamination of these is due to the miss-manipulation and control of the same; this is the reason for which it is expected that when such products arrive to the consumer, they have a high frequency of this bacteria; and, consequently, become a means of transportation of the pathogen, for which the following problem is stated: what is the frequency of isolation of Listeria monocytogenes in cabbage and lettuce that are distributed in the markets “La Hermelinda”, “Central” and “Palermo” in Trujillo City as means of transportation of the human listeriosis?. Holding the hypothesis: “the frequency of isolation of this bacteria in such vegetables that are distributed in the markets of Trujillo, is higher that zero”. And the objectives: determine the presence of this bacteria in the vegetables that are the object of study; estimate the frequency of isolation on the evaluated vegetables; and determine the existence of differences on the frequency of isolation of the bacteria, between the cabbage and the lettuce among the markets that are object of study. For such purpose, a close investigation has been applied with observational and transversal study; and a design of stratified, aleatory and multi-staged sample design. The size of the sample (n = 54) was determined with the formula of proportions for finite population and unknown variance; and after that, proceeding with a proportional delivery of the sample among the three markets; being half of it cabbage and the <b>other,</b> <b>lettuce.</b> All the isolated crops were identified by the Automated System Micro Scam Walk Away and by the Molecular Characterization.

The presence of bacteria in lettuce for each market is 16. 67 %; and statistics show that presence of the bacteria in the cabbage is the same in the three markets, but less than in lettuce. The presence of the bacteria implies that it is present in the rest of the markets of the city and possibly in other products as well.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} {{to address the problem of}} root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.) affecting semi-temperate vegetables cultivated by small-holder farmers in the highlands (Cordillera) in the northern part of Luzon, Philippines. Our general objective was to assist in the development of root-knot nematode management strategies suitable for small-holding farming that could result in improved crop productivity and quality. There are four experiments included in our study which started from the survey of plant-parasitic nematodes in the principal agricultural farms in Benguet Province. The objectives of this part of our study were to update the incidence of plant-parasitic nematodes associated with semi-temperate vegetables in Benguet Province and to identify the predominant plant-parasitic nematode species associated with semi-temperate vegetables in this province which is the major semi-temperate vegetables producing region of the Philippines. The sampling was carried out between the dry seasons of 2004 and 2005 (December 2004 to March 2005). This was followed by a sampling during the rainy season of 2005 (June-July). The last sampling was carried out during the dry season of 2006 (February-May). The results of this survey showed that thirteen genera (Aphelenchoides, Criconemella, Ditylenchus, Globodera, Helicotylenchus, Hoplolaimus, Meloidogyne, Longidorus, Paratrichodorus, Pratylenchus, Trichodorus, Tylenchus, and Xiphinema) of plant-parasitic nematodes were found associated with various semi-temperate vegetable crops in Benguet Province. Among these taxa, Helicotylenchus, Meloidogyne and Pratylenchus were the most predominant. Four nematode genera which contain species that can vector plant viruses were also found in the rhizosphere of several semi-temperate vegetables during the survey: Trichodorus, Paratrichodorus, Longidorus and Xiphinema. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the presence of Paratrichodorus, Longidorus and Xiphinema (americanum) on semi-temperate vegetables in the Philippines. From the above mentioned experiment, the predominant plant-parasitic nematode Meloidogyne incognita was singled out for further experimentation in the greenhouse. The objective of this part of our study was to evaluate the host response (susceptibility and sensitivity) of six semi-temperate vegetables commonly grown today in the highlands of Benguet Province to M. incognita. Six semi-temperate vegetables (carrot, celery, cucumber, lettuce, tomato and sweet pepper) were evaluated for their host response to infection by M. incognita. The host response index showed that no sources of resistance were found against M. incognita in the carrot cultivars which were evaluated. The cultivars, Caroline, Chunhong andLucky Kuroda were classified as intermediate, the cultivars Argo Super Kuroda and Royal Chantenay were classified as moderately susceptible, and the cultivarsNew Kuroda, New Kurodagosun and Victoria were classified as susceptible to infection by M. incognita. The two celery cultivars that were evaluated, Tall Utah Supreme and Utah 52 - 70 R Imp, showed some resistance to infection by M. incognita during the early assessment period. However, both cultivars became susceptible to this nematode species during the second assessment period. Nevertheless, since both cultivars still provided marketable yields even with high nematode infection level they can be classified as tolerant to infection by M. incognita. Of the cucumber cultivars evaluated, Poinsett was classified as moderately susceptible to infection by M. incognita while the three other cultivars evaluated, Cyclone, Gen. Lee and Melissa, were classified as highly susceptible. However, because of the increase in yield even with a high nematode infection level in the latter two cultivars, it was concluded that they are tolerant to infection by M. incognita. Sources of resistance to M. incognita were found in the lettuce cultivars evaluated: Great Lakes and Grand Rapids were classified as immune and resistant, respectively. Tolerance was also found in Red Wave. The cultivars Attrazione and Tyrol were classified as moderately susceptible while Ballon and Red Salad Bowl were classified as susceptible and highly susceptible, respectively, to infection by M. incognita. Except for cvs Great Lakes and Grand Rapids, all the <b>other</b> <b>lettuce</b> cultivars which are of loose-leaf type such as Ballon, Apache, Lollo Rosa, Red Salad Bowl, Tyrol, Xanadu etc. can be harvested in less than 8 weeks after transplanting. If these plants were germinated in sterile soil in seedling trays and harvested earlier in the field, the root-knot nematodes would not be able to complete their life cycle in the host during the cropping period. Hence, the plants can avoid further damage through secondary infection by the nematodes. It would also lessen the population of the root-knot nematodes in the soil even for those susceptible plants. The commercial tomato cultivar Apollo and five breeding lines were classified as highly susceptible to M. incognita while the two newly introduced commercial cultivars Marmande 1 and Marmande 2 were classified as susceptible to this nematode species. Cultivar Red Cherry was considered as a more tolerant cultivar due to its ability to produce marketable yields in spite of a high nematode infection level. The sweet pepper cultivar California Wonder was classified as moderately susceptible to M. incognita infection while Smooth Cayene and Yolo Wonder were classified as susceptible and highly susceptible, respectively. A crop rotation scheme was designed to examine the host status for a local M. incognita population of the most commonly cultivated cash crops in the Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR) usually grown in rotation with carrot. Crops which were considered effective in suppressing root-knot nematode populations, such as marigold (Tagetes erecta), but are considered of no economic value in small-holding farming were not included in our study. A greenhouse experiment was conducted at Benguet State University, La Trinidad, Benguet, Philippines, during a 2 -year-period (2006 - 2007). The rotation crops were planted during the 2 nd and the 3 rd cropping period while carrot was planted during the 1 st and the 4 th cropping periods. The cropping sequence was as follows: (i) carrot during the dry season of 2006 (= 1 st cropping period), (ii) rotation crops during the dry season of early 2007 (= 2 nd cropping period), (iii) rotation crops during the wet season of 2007 (= 3 rd cropping period), (iv) carrot during the dry season of late 2007 (= 4 th cropping period). The use of onion, strawberry, broccoli and sweet corn as rotation crops suppressed the multiplication of M. incognita. However, resurgence of the population was observed when susceptible crops were planted subsequently. A yield increase was noted in all crops except in crops which supported less nematode population densities such as onion, broccoli and sweet corn. These crops, somehow, did not give the expected yield increase. Given this situation, it would be helpful if other nematode management practices could be applied before planting susceptible crops. Nevertheless, the information obtained during our study is still useful to growers in Benguet Province since these two crops are being used already by local farmers in the highlands. Several forms of management for M. incognita have been reported in most agricultural crops. One promising practice is using silicon amendment to alleviate damage caused generally by fungi or bacteria. Until now, little had been studied for root-knot nematodes, therefore, the objectives of this part of our study were to: (1) investigate the effects of silicon on root-knot nematode, M. incognita; and (2) determine its consequent effects on plant growth and yield of carrot, celery, tomato and cucumber. This part of our study comprised of two experiments which were conducted in the greenhouse. In the first experiment, seeds of celery and tomato were sown in polyethylene seedling trays (2. 54 cm-diameter) prior to transplanting in bigger plastic pots (18 cm-diameter) containing ± 2. 5 kg of sterilized soil. Celery seeds were germinated and grown for 8 weeks while tomato was grown for 4 weeks. On the other hand, seeds of carrot and cucumber were directly transplanted in pots. In the first experiment, silicon was applied in the form of sodium metasilicate in different concentrations (0, 10, 20, 40 and 80 mg/l) and a commercial fertilizer Duofus. In the second experiment, silicon in the form of sodium metasilicate was applied in cucumber in concentrations; 0, 20 and 40 mg/l, which were applied either once or weekly during its cropping period, and which were applied on the leaves and roots alone or applied to both plant parts. The benefits of Si in M. incognita reduction and alleviating damage by the nematode specifically in cucumber plants have been shown partially in our study. These effects however are not true for all the plants tested like carrot, celery and tomato. Slight nematode reduction was observed from the latter plants in some concentrations but yield was not generally increased. This was likely because cucumber plants are said to be intermediate accumulator of Si and thus, can benefit more from the effect of Si amendment. Nevertheless, we can conclude that supplemental Si can contribute to M. incognita reduction and enhance better yield particularly in cucumber even from infected plants, and hence, should warrant further investigation.

50|$|Lettuce is {{a primary}} ingredient, and several types of lettuce can be used, such as butter lettuce, cos lettuce, Boston lettuce, romaine lettuce, green leaf lettuce and iceberg <b>lettuce,</b> among <b>others.</b> The <b>lettuce</b> may be chopped, torn, {{shredded}} or sliced into ribbons. Additional ingredients may include, {{but are not limited}} to, chicken stock, beef stock, cream, milk, wine, lemon juice, egg or egg yolk, meats, rice, potato, greens, sorrel, watercress, Swiss chard, escarole, peas, parsley/dried parsley, bread crumbs, onion, shallot, garlic, salt and pepper, among others. Some preparations purée all of the ingredients together, and some preparations are strained in a sieve. Lettuce soup is sometimes served with toast or rolls, either as a side dish or with the soup poured upon it. Sometimes croutons or chopped bacon are used in the dish or to garnish it. In French cuisine, lettuce soup is usually served poured atop thin slices of lightly toasted French bread. Some versions are served cold. Total calories can vary depending on ingredients used. For example, versions that use milk may have fewer calories than those that use cream.|$|R

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the Cd availability and accumulation in soil, transfer rate and toxicity in lettuce and rice plants grown in a Cd-contaminated Typic Hapludox. Two simultaneous greenhouse experiments with lettuce and rice test plants were conducted in a randomized complete block design with four replications. The treatments consisted of four Cd rates (CdCl 2), 0. 0; 1. 3; 3. 0 and 6. 0 mg kg- 1, based on the guidelines recommended by the Environmental Agency of the State of São Paulo, Brazil (Cetesb). Higher Cd rates increased extractable Cd (using Mehlich- 3, Mehlich- 1 and DTPA chemical extractants) and decreased lettuce and rice dry matter yields. However, no visual toxicity symptoms were observed in plants. Mehlich- 1, Mehlich- 3 and DTPA extractants were effective in predicting soil Cd availability as well as the Cd concentration and accumulation in plant parts. Cadmium concentration in rice remained below the threshold for human consumption established by Brazilian legislation.

50|$|In agriculture, {{continuous}} {{harvest is}} {{the availability of}} a crop over an extended period during the growing season. Each crop has a harvest window during which it is ready for picking. Some are harvested by removing the whole plant, for example, cutting a head of <b>lettuce.</b> <b>Others</b> can be picked over varying periods: peas and corn may have a window of two weeks, cucumbers six or eight, tomatoes produce {{until the end of the}} season. To provide a season-long continuous harvest of a crop with a shorter harvest window, succession planting techniques are used, including multiple plantings at different times, and planting of varieties with different maturity dates. In this way, with effective timing, a new planting or variety of a crop is always coming into maturity as a previous one finishes.|$|R

The experiment {{was carried out}} in field at the Universidade do Oeste Paulista, in Presidente Prudente, São Paulo, Brazil, from August to October, 2006. One treatment was performed on bare soil and the <b>other</b> using <b>lettuce</b> cultivar Vera as cover crop, {{at the end of the}} cycle. The average water depth, application rate, uniformity of distribution coefficient, Christiansen uniformity coefficient, Hawaiian uniformity coefficient, as well as the statistical uniformity coefficient were evaluated. The following plant spacing were simulated: 12 x 12, 12 x 18, and 18 x 18 m. The highest water depth retained with lettuce crop cover, at the end of the cycle was 2. 4 mm, applied when sprinklers were spaced at 12 x 12 m. The same occurred in the application rate with an average reduction of 43 %. When the overlapping was performed, the crop cover did not influence the parameters of efficiency and uniformity, assuring the distribution of the irrigation depth. Neither treatment reached the expected rate concerning the water depth average or the application rate in the spaces. The treatment using cover crop presented the lowest value, with a water depth average below the intended amount. Therefore, the lettuce as cover crop promotes the reduction of applied water depth. Consequently, the irrigation time has to be increased to assure the expected water depth...|$|R
40|$|O presente trabalho foi realizado na UFRRJ e teve como objetivo verificar as variações de alguns componentes metabólicos nos tecidos da alface. Plantas de alface do tipo crespa, da {{cultivar}} Verônica, provenientes de três sistemas de cultivo, orgânico, hidropônico e convencional, foram separadas em oito partes (limbo das folhas basais, medianas e apicais, nervura central das folhas basais, medianas e apicais, caule e raiz). Foram analisados nitrato, N-amino, açúcares livres e distribuição da massa seca nos vários tecidos. Considerando a parte aérea e raízes, os teores encontrados assemelham-se aos da literatura. Porém, quando as análises são realizadas nos tecidos que compõem a parte aérea, há diferenças significativas em todas as variáveis. Isso permite escolher partes da planta para analisar, dependendo do que se deseja observar. Em estudos fisiológicos, principalmente de metabolismo do nitrogênio, a segmentação das partes pode ser fundamental na interpretação dos resultados. Na análise de nitrato, N-amino e açúcares livres na alface, é recomendada a separação de folhas e caule da parte aérea por terem apresentado grandes diferenças. A alface em cultura hidropônica mostrou teores de nitrato bem superiores aos outros sistemas de cultivo, chegando ao máximo de 1000 mg kg- 1 massa fresca do caule, valor esse, entretanto, bem abaixo do máximo permitido pela legislação européia para acúmulo de nitrato em alface. Pode-se sugerir que o caule da alface funcione como o principal órgão de reserva temporário de compostos nitrogenados livres, principalmente nitrato e N-amino, além de açúcares solúveis. Maiores estudos são necessários para confirmar se o caule teria efeito tampão caso as plantas da alface absorvessem grandes quantidades de nitrogênio na forma nítrica e amoniacal. The {{distribution of}} some physiologic metabolites was evaluated in lettuce plants. Crest leaf lettuce plants were {{grown in the}} organic, hydroponic, and conventional system. Plants from each systems were split in eight parts (old, medium, and new leaf limbos, old, medium, and new main leaf veins, stem and root). Analyses of nitrate, amino-N, soluble sugars, and dry mass partition were accomplished throughout the parts. In general, considering the aerial part and roots, the contents resemble literature reports. However, when the analyses are accomplished in the different plant parts that compose the shoot, there are significant differences among parts in all analyzed metabolites. This allows a better choice of which part of the plant to analyze, depending on what one wants to observe. During physiologic studies of nitrogen metabolism, the separation of parts may be fundamental {{in the interpretation of}} the results. Nitrate, amino-N and free sugars showed great differences between shoot parts and stem. Stems appear to accumulate their maximum contents. The hydroponic lettuce showed nitrate contents greater than any <b>other</b> <b>lettuces,</b> reaching a maximum of 1, 000 mg kg- 1 of fresh mass in stems. Therefore, this amount is well below the maximum allowed by the European legislation for lettuce nitrate content. The results suggest that the lettuce stem works as the main accumulator of free nitrogen compounds, specially nitrate and amino-N, besides soluble sugars. Further studies are necessary to confirm if lettuce stems would have buffer function in case of large amounts of nitrogen uptake...|$|R

Lettuce samples cut into 1 -cm strips were placed in polypropylene trays wrapped with biodegradable films and stored at 6 ± 2 °C for 8 days. PVC films were used as controls. The biofilms presented 11. 43 - 8. 11 MPa resistance and 11. 3 - 13. 22 % elongation, with water vapor permeability (WVP) of 0. 5 - 4. 04 x 10 - 12 g. s- 1.

After applying at an inoculated level (6 e 7 log CFU/mL) of Listeria monocytogenes on Iceberg lettuce, the antilisterial properties of balsamic vinegar from Modena, white wine vinegar and acetic acid solutions were investigated. Different proportions of the vinegars, acetic acid (58. 7 g/L), and deionized water were evaluated to determine the role of those solutions at the stage of washing Iceberg lettuce to remove L. monocytogenes. The maximum observed log reduction of L. monocytogenes was 2. 15 0. 04 for balsamic vinegar (50 % (v/ v)), 1. 18 0. 06 for white wine vinegar ((50 % (v/v)) and 1. 13 0. 06 for acetic acid ((50 % (v/v)).

40|$|Fusarium wilt {{of lettuce}} was first {{recognized}} in Arizona in 2001. The pathogen, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lactucae, has been recovered from infected lettuce plants in 27 different fields {{during the last}} three years. This fungus is a soil-borne pathogen that can remain viable in soil for many years. Historically, control of Fusarium wilt on crops <b>other</b> than <b>lettuce,</b> such as tomatoes and melons, has been achieved by planting cultivars resistant to the fungal pathogen. Large scale field trials were conducted during the 2002 - 03 and 2003 - 04 production seasons to evaluate existing lettuce cultivars for their relative susceptibility to Fusarium wilt. Among virtually all tested lettuce cultivars, the severity of disease in the first planting (early September) was much higher than that observed in the second planting (mid October), which in turn was higher than that observed in the third planting (early December). Soil temperatures differed considerably among plantings. In 2002 - 03 (or 2003 - 04) the average daily soil temperature at the 4 -inch depth ranged from 65 to 85 °F (70 to 94 °F), 55 to 74 °F (47 to 78 °F), and 48 to 64 °F (47 to 74 °F) for the first, second and third plantings, respectively. In all three plantings, differences in disease severity were detected among the different types of lettuce, with head lettuce cultivars as a group being most susceptible and romaine cultivars collectively demonstrating the highest level of tolerance. Disease tolerance for specific cultivars was dependent on disease pressure. This is reflected in the comparative disease severity recorded in 2003 - 04 for specific cultivars (such as Beacon, Buccaneer, Coyote, Desert Heat, Lighthouse, Monolith, Red Tide, Sharpshooter, Sniper and Two Star) planted at each of the three different planting dates. Disease development began as early as the seedling stage and continued up to plant maturity, demonstrating the benefit of evaluating lettuce resistance in the field compared to greenhouse studies where plants are usually not carried to maturity before final disease ratings are performed. Data from these cultivar evaluation studies suggest that proper selection of planting date and cultivar would allow successful production of lettuce in fields infested with Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lactucae...|$|R
40|$|To {{understand}} the geographical distribution of lettuce drop incidence {{and the structure}} of Sclerotinia minor and S. sclerotiorum populations, commercial lettuce fields were surveyed in the Salinas, San Joaquin, and Santa Maria Valleys in California. Lettuce drop incidence, pathogen species, and mycelial compatibility groups (MCGs) were determined and analyzed using geostatistic and geographical information system tools. Lettuce drop incidence was lowest in the San Joaquin Valley, and not significantly different between the other two valleys. Semivariogram analysis revealed that lettuce drop incidence was not spatially correlated between different fields in the Salinas Valley, suggesting negligible fieldto-field spread or influence of inoculum in one field on <b>other</b> fields. <b>Lettuce</b> drop incidence was significantly lower in fields with a surface drip system than in fields with furrow or sprinkler irrigation systems, suggesting that the surface drip system can be a potential management measure for reducing lettuce drop. In the San Joaquin Valley, S. sclerotiorum was the prevalent species, causing drop in 63. 5 % of the fields, whereas S. minor also was identified in 25. 4 % of the fields. In contrast, in the Salinas Valley, S. minor was the dominant species (76. 1 %) whereas S sclerotiorum only observed in only 13. 6 % fields, in which only a few plants were infected by S. sclerotiorum. In the Santa Maria Valley, both species frequently were identified, with S. minor being slightly more common. Although many MCGs were identified in S. minor, most of them consisted of only one or two isolates. In all, ≈ 91. 4 % of the isolates belonged to four MCGs. Among them, MCG- 1 was the most prevalent group in all three valleys, accounting for 49. 8 % of total isolates. It was distributed all over the surveyed areas, whereas other MCGs were distributed more or less locally. Populations of S. sclerotiorum exhibited greater diversity, with 89 isolates collected from the Salinas and San Joaquin Valleys belonging to 37 different MCGs. Among them, the most recurrent MCG-A contained 16 isolates, and 30 MCGs contained only 1 isolate each. Many MCGs occurred within only one or a part of the two valleys. Potential reasons for this abundant diversity are discussed...|$|R
