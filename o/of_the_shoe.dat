5|$|Another one of Bowerman's pupils, Phil Knight, {{partnered with}} Bowerman and {{revolutionized}} the sport with the formation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoe</b> company giant, Nike. Knight {{graduated from the}} University of Oregon in 1959 {{and went on to}} Stanford University for graduate school. There, he developed the idea to import Japanese running shoes to the American market. After earning his MBA from Stanford, he returned to the University of Oregon where he and Bowerman struck a handshake deal in 1964, each with a $500 investment into a company called Blue Ribbon Sports to import Japanese running shoes. In the late 1960s, Bowerman's pursuit of lighter shoes for his athletes led him to develop a sole by pouring rubber into his wife's waffle iron, inventing the modern running shoe. After Knight decided to rename the company Nike and develop its own shoes, Bowerman's invention became the prototype for the company. The shoe made its debut in the 1972 Olympic Trials at Hayward Field with Steve Prefontaine as one of the early endorsers. Although Bowerman retired from coaching in 1972, he remained on Nike's board until 1999. In that time, Nike exploded into a multibillion-dollar company.|$|E
25|$|The vamp is {{the front}} part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoe,</b> {{starting}} behind the toe, extending around the eyelets and tongue and towards back part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoe.</b>|$|E
25|$|It {{is made of}} two pieces, {{the upper}} part and the sole, sewn {{together}} with leather threads. Three small straps {{are attached to the}} front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoe,</b> each of which has a knot ("humrata") at the top to fit a hole made on the other side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoe.</b> Two white leather straps attach to either side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoe</b> and fasten it to the leg.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>shoes</b> are {{important}} for <b>the</b> skin <b>of</b> our feet. It is protecting feet from injurious things in <b>the</b> ground. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dermatoses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> feet are greatly affected by <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoes</b> a patient is wearing. However, little attention is made on the value and functions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoes</b> {{and its impact on}} our skin. This manuscript provides some details on this topic...|$|R
25|$|Brogues (American: wing-tips): The toe <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoe</b> {{is covered}} with a {{perforated}} panel, the wing-tip, which extends down either side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoe.</b> Brogues can be found in both balmoral and blucher styles, but are considered slightly less formal.|$|E

50|$|Hope for Haiti {{sent over}} a {{thousand}} pairs <b>of</b> counterfeit <b>shoes</b> to <b>the</b> people <b>of</b> Haiti. Criminal law attorney Peter Aiken said his client, former gas station owner Hathum Ayesh, who {{had been arrested for}} selling counterfeit <b>shoes,</b> wanted <b>the</b> <b>shoes</b> to go to a good cause instead of being destroyed. Nike provided a letter releasing <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoes</b> and Hope for Haiti guaranteed <b>the</b> delivery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoes</b> to Haiti.|$|R
25|$|To give a {{concrete}} example of this, a worker making shoes in a shoe factory {{is not only}} producing shoes, but potential exchange-value. <b>The</b> <b>shoes</b> are commodities that can be sold for cash. In this way, <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> labor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> worker is <b>the</b> exchange-value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoes</b> he or she produces minus his or her compensation. At the same time, however, <b>the</b> <b>shoes</b> produced have certain social or cultural values as well. In this way, the worker’s labor is mediating between the economic or exchange-value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoes,</b> and their social or cultural, or symbolic value.|$|R

50|$|For footwear, {{white socks}} and black cloth shoes (with white soles) are the norm, but in <b>the</b> past, <b>shoes</b> {{may have a}} front face panel {{attached}} to <b>the</b> tip <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoes.</b> Daoists, Buddhists and Confucians may have white stripe chevrons.|$|R
25|$|The insole is the {{interior}} {{bottom of a}} shoe, which sits directly beneath the foot under the footbed (also known as sock liner). The purpose of insole is to attach to the lasting margin of the upper, which is wrapped around the last during the closing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoe</b> during the lasting operation. Insoles are usually made of cellulosic paper board or synthetic non woven insole board. Many shoes have removable and replaceable footbeds. Extra cushioning is often added for comfort (to control the shape, moisture, or smell <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoe)</b> or health reasons (to help deal with differences in the natural shape of the foot or positioning of the foot during standing or walking).|$|E
25|$|This is {{the process}} of running the {{shoelaces}} through the holes, eyelets, loops, or hooks to hold together the sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoe</b> with many common lacing methods. There are, in fact, almost two trillion ways to lace a shoe with six pairs of eyelets.|$|E
25|$|The box is a rigid {{enclosure}} {{within the}} front end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoe</b> that encases and supports the dancer's toes. The {{front end of the}} box is flattened so as to form a platform upon which the dancer can balance, and fabric covers the exterior of the box for aesthetics.|$|E

2500|$|The {{floor on}} which Cook stands recedes into an {{ambiguous}} background, and despite several anecdotal elements, {{the painting is}} [...] "remarkably barren", though with enough information to suggest a public performance. Inconsistencies in perspective add to the ambiguity. <b>The</b> lower part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dress, <b>shoes,</b> and flowers are depicted as if seen from above, yet <b>the</b> visibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> soles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoes</b> and underside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dress suggest a lower vantage point.|$|R
25|$|The removal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoe</b> also {{symbolizes the}} act of giving up a legal right. In Hebrew custom, the widow removed the shoe of her late husband's brother to symbolize that he had {{abandoned}} his duty. In Arab custom, the removal of one's shoe also symbolized the dissolution of marriage.|$|E
25|$|As for {{shoelaces}} in {{the sense}} that we know them in modern times, the Museum of London has documented examples of medieval footwear dating from as far back as the 12th century, which clearly show the lacing passing through a series of hooks or eyelets down the front or side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoe.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} lacing method, termed {{criss-cross}} lacing, {{is also one}} of the strongest and most efficient, but is not so well suited to certain dress shoes, such as Oxfords, because the central shoelace crossovers prevent the sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoe</b> from coming together in the middle. For such shoes, methods such as straight lacing are better suited.|$|E

25|$|The Air Force 5 was {{introduced}} in 1990. The Air Force V was the first model to make the airbag visible on the side heels <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoe.</b> The most popular colorway was white/medium grey/black/orange. Just like the previous version it was slightly higher than the first three versions. This was also the last original Air Force model to be made.|$|E
25|$|Lopez {{was growing}} {{surrounded}} by shoes and everything related to shoe production. Her observations {{and attention to}} the techniques gave her deep knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoe</b> construction and design concepts. Later, in the interview for the Spanish Magazine Surrealista, Lopez admitted that she was always attracted by art and creative process but she never really thought to work neither in the shoe industry nor in fashion.|$|E

25|$|Today, {{there are}} less than 300 {{workshops}} in <b>the</b> <b>shoe</b> industry, who only run part-time, and they employ around 3,000–4,000 people.

Less than 25% goes to the Palestinian market, with some going to Jordan, Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries.|$|R
5|$|Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{concealed}} <b>shoes</b> {{found to}} date {{are made of}} leather, but wooden clogs and rubber galoshes have also been reported, among others. The overwhelming majority (almost 98 per cent) have been worn, and many show signs of repair. All ages are represented in <b>the</b> <b>shoe</b> sizes, from babies to adults, {{but there is little}} difference in <b>the</b> ratio <b>of</b> adult male to female shoes, at 21.5 per cent and 26.5 per cent respectively.
