5|$|In {{establishing}} the Temple, Aquino {{was joined by}} other ex-members of LaVey's Church, and soon Setian groups, or pylons, were established {{in various parts of}} the United States.

In many drawings there is a strong sense of waiting: waiting to move into battle, waiting for the war to end, waiting to be sent home.|$|E

5|$|Lieutenant General Sir Edwin Alfred Hervey Alderson, KCB (8 April 1859 – 14 December 1927) was {{a senior}} British Army officer who served in several campaigns <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>nineteenth</b> and early twentieth centuries. During the First World War he was placed {{in command of the}} Canadian Expeditionary Force {{during the first half of}} the war but made enemies amongst the Canadian {{political}} and military elite and suffered disastrous casualties during operations in 1915/16 which forced his sidelining and eventual retirement from service.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{their main}} campus in Broadmoor, the {{congregation}} also operates Beth Israel Cemetery, {{listed on the}} National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Located at 19th Street and 5th Avenue, it was originally outside of Meridian's city limits and {{was intended to be}} a rural cemetery, but the city has since expanded and annexed the area containing the cemetery. The cemetery contains generations of German and Alsatian immigrants, as well as many big names of the largely mercantile Jewish community <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>nineteenth</b> and early twentieth centuries. Beth Israel Cemetery is the only remaining built memorial for many of Meridian's early Jews since the era of the 1879 and 1906 temple buildings, neither of which still stands.|$|E
5|$|Barrington Civic Center Historic District is a {{historic}} district in Barrington, Rhode Island on County Road. The district, which consists of the Barrington Town Hall, Leander R. Peck School and Prince's Hill Cemetery, is located on Prince's Hill {{near the center of}} Barrington. In 1728, Prince's Hill Cemetery was purchased and later expanded to its present size by 1898. The -story Barrington Town Hall was completed in 1888 and originally served as the seat of the town's government, library and high school. With the completion of the Leander R. Peck School in 1917, the high school moved into the adjacent building and the library used its space. The two-story Elizabethan Revival style Peck School is designed with a T-shaped plan and features a stairway to access the main entrance on the second story. The Peck School was later used by the fifth and sixth grade elementary students before becoming the public library. Also located within the district is Wood's Pond. The Barrington Civic Center Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976, and serves as historically significant example of civic and natural environment planning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century.|$|E

5|$|The Gothic style {{developed}} {{fully in}} the later nineteenth century. Important figures included Frederick Thomas Pilkington (1832–98), who adapted the Gothic style {{for the needs of}} the Free Church of Scotland, as at Barclay Viewforth Church, Edinburgh (1862–64). Robert Rowand Anderson (1834–1921), trained in the office of leading Gothic Architect George Gilbert Scott in London before returning to Edinburgh, where he worked on many small churches, including St James the Less in Leith, Christ Church, Falkirk (1862) and the Catholic Apostolic Church in Edinburgh (1876). He also supervised the renovation of Dunblane (1890–93) and Paisley Abbey (1898–1907). Alexander 'Greek' Thomson (1817–75), working mainly in Glasgow, began in the Gothic style, but soon turned toward the ancient Greeks and Egyptians for inspiration, {{as can be seen in}} the temple and columns that were part of the Caledonia Road Church (1856). Scotland's most influential architect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century and early twentieth century, Charles Rennie MacKintosh, designed a number of churches, but only one, Queen's Cross Free Church, Glasgow (1898–99) was built. It avoided the characteristic steeple of Glasgow churches in favour of a wide tower, and has a simple, elegant, rectangular structure with a single aisle.|$|E
5|$|The temperance {{movement}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>nineteenth</b> {{and early}} twentieth century, and emergency laws aimed at restricting drinking during the First World War created difficult trading conditions for brewers. In 1919 net profit was reported at £22,325 (£900,000 at 2010 prices). Samuel Wentworth Webster, {{a director of the}} company and grandson of the founder, died in 1928 with a personalty of £45,000 (£2.2million in 2010). In 1928, one of the brewery's most successful beers was launched; Webster's Green Label, a light mild ale. In 1929 the company's entire stock of properties, land and brewery buildings was valued at £468,833 (£23.2million in 2010). The company took over Joseph Stocks of Halifax in December 1932, which could trace its origins back to 1790. In 1957, Webster's took over the brewer, John Ainley & Sons of Huddersfield and Woodhead Brothers of Elland, near Halifax, a mineral water manufacturer. The company dray horses, used for local beer deliveries, were retired {{by the end of the}} 1950s. In 1961 Webster's bought Daniel Fielding & Sons of Halifax, which added 19 public houses to their tied estate. The same year the company sought out partnership with the national brewer Watney Mann in order to benefit from the technical knowledge of the much larger company. In return Webster's brewed and sold the brewery conditioned Watney's Red Barrel ale throughout their tied estate. In 1962, a reciprocal trading agreement was reached with Ind Coope's North East division which saw Webster's houses stock lager for the first time. That same year the group won the contract to bottle Tuborg for West Yorkshire.|$|E
5|$|The usual tomb plan {{consisted}} of a long inclined rock-cut corridor, descending through one or more halls (possibly mirroring the descending path of the sun god into the underworld) to the burial chamber. In the earlier tombs, the corridors turn 90 degrees at least once (such as KV43, the tomb of Thutmose IV), and the earliest ones had cartouche-shaped burial chambers (for example, KV43, the tomb of Thutmose IV). This layout is known as 'Bent Axis', After the burial the upper corridors {{were meant to be}} filled with rubble and the entrance to the tomb hidden. After the Amarna Period, the layout gradually straightened, with an intermediate 'Jogged Axis' (the tomb of Horemheb, KV57 is typical of this {{and is one of the}} tombs that is sometimes open to the public), to the generally 'Straight Axis' <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>Nineteenth</b> and Twentieth Dynasty tombs (Ramesses III's and Ramesses IX's tombs, KV11 and KV6 respectively). As the tombs' axes straightened, the slopes also lessened. They almost disappeared in the late Twentieth Dynasty. Another feature that is common to most tombs is the 'well', which may have originated as an actual barrier intended to stop flood waters from entering the lower parts of the tomb. It seems to have developed a 'magical' purpose later on as a symbolic shaft. In the later Twentieth Dynasty, the well itself was sometimes not excavated, but the well room was still present.|$|E

25|$|Like most sans-serifs Akzidenz-Grotesk is 'monoline' in structure, {{with all}} strokes {{of the letter}} of quite similar width. This gives a sense of {{simplicity}} and an absence of the adornment and flourishes seen in many more decorative sans-serifs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century influenced by the Art Nouveau style. Modern type designer Martin Majoor has described the general design of Akzidenz-Grotesk and its ancestors as similar in letterforms to the Didone serif fonts that were standard types in the nineteenth century, such as Didot and Walbaum. This is most visible in the quite folded-up apertures of letters such as ‘a’ and ‘c’.|$|E
25|$|Red, blue, {{and white}} {{are also the}} Pan-Slavic colors adopted by the Slavic {{solidarity}} movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century. Initially these were {{the colors of the}} Russian flag; as the Slavic movement grew, they were adopted by other Slavic peoples including Slovaks, Slovenes, and Serbs. The flags of the Czech Republic and Poland use red for historic heraldic reasons (see Coat of arms of Poland and Coat of arms of the Czech Republic) & not due to Pan-Slavic connotations. In 2004 Georgia adopted a new white flag, which consists of four small and one big red cross in the middle touching all four sides.|$|E

He {{made a number of}} moves that might have taken him into parliamentary politics, initially by tentative thoughts about standing in elections during the 1890s. In 1901-2 he was in close contact with the Independent Labour Party. But the overall effect of the Second Boer War was to drive him back into the academic career he had put on hold in 1898, resigning his Glasgow chair (effective from April 1899).|$|E
25|$|However, {{the famous}} artists most closely {{linked with the}} {{mountains}} are the three who were born or lived in Mont-Saint-Hilaire itself over the course <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>nineteenth</b> and twentieth century: Ozias Leduc, born in 1864 in Mont-Saint-Hilaire, his student Paul-Émile Borduas, also born in Mont-Saint-Hilaire in 1905, and finally, Jordi Bonet, who, after emigrating to Québec, settled down at Mont-Saint-Hilaire in 1969. Leduc especially {{is known for his}} numerous representations of the mountain in several paintings such as L'Heure Mauve and Neige Dorée, but the mountain also inspired the work of Borduas, such as his Le Trou des Fées and Synthèse d'un paysage de Mont-Saint-Hilaire, and Bonnet, who included the silhouette of the mountain in several of his works.|$|E
25|$|Most of Over-the-Rhine's ornate brick {{buildings}} were built by German immigrants from 1865 to the 1880s.

Most {{of the buildings}} in Over-the-Rhine are one of these styles, {{but there are other}} odd balls as well. Art Deco is represented by the American Building on Central Parkway, the Germania Building at Twelfth and Walnut streets is ironically one of the few examples of German ornamentation in the neighborhood, Music Hall's mixture of styles is best described as Venetian Gothic, there are a handful of buildings with Gothic architecture, and the new SCPA on Central Parkway is the most notable example of Modern architecture in the neighborhood.|$|E
