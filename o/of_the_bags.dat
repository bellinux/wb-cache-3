25|$|By the {{beginning}} of June, Caroline had travelled north from Italy, and was at St Omer near Calais. Acting {{on the advice of}} Alderman Matthew Wood and her lady-in-waiting Lady Anne Hamilton, she rejected the government's offer. She bid farewell to Pergami, and embarked for England. When she arrived on 5 June, riots broke out in support of her. Caroline was a figurehead for the growing Radical movement that demanded political reform and opposed the unpopular king. Nevertheless, the King still adamantly desired a divorce, and the following day, he submitted the evidence gathered by the Milan commission to Parliament in two green bags. On 15 June, the Guards in the King's Mews mutinied. The mutiny was contained, but the government was fearful of further unrest. Examination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bags</b> of evidence was delayed as Parliament debated the form of the investigation, but eventually, on 27 June, they were opened and examined in secret by 15 peers. The peers considered the contents scandalous, and a week later, after their report to the House, the government introduced a bill in Parliament, the Pains and Penalties Bill 1820, to strip Caroline of the title of queen and dissolve her marriage. It was claimed that Caroline had committed adultery with a low-born man: Bartolomeo Pergami. Various witnesses, such as Theodore Majocchi, were called during the reading of the bill, which was effectively a public trial of the Queen. The trial caused a sensation, as details of Caroline's familiarity with Pergami were revealed. Witnesses said the couple had slept in the same room, kissed, and been seen together in a state of undress. The bill passed the House of Lords, but was not submitted to the House of Commons as there was little prospect that the Commons would pass it. To her friends, Caroline joked that she had indeed committed adultery onceâ€”with the husband of Mrs. Fitzherbert, the King.|$|E

40|$|Gillespie, John W. Heider, DirkBagging {{materials}} are utilized in many composites manufacturing processes. The selection is mainly driven by cost, temperature requirements, chemical compatibility and tear properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bag.</b> <b>The</b> air barrier properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> {{are assumed to}} be adequate or in many cases are not considered at all. However, the gas barrier property <b>of</b> a <b>bag</b> is <b>the</b> most critical parameter, as it can negatively affect <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> final laminate. The barrier property is a function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> material, uniformity, thickness and temperature. Improved barrier properties are needed for large parts, high pressure consolidated components and structures where air stays entrapped on the part surface. The air resistance property <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film is defined as permeability and is investigated in this thesis. A model was developed to evaluate the gas transport through the film and an experimental cell was implemented to characterize various commercial films. Understanding and characterizing the transport phenomena through the film allows optimization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bagging</b> material for various manufacturing processes. Spray-on-Bag is a scalable alternative bagging method compared to standard films. The approach allows in-situ fabrication <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> on large and complex geometry structures where optimization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> properties can be varied on a local level.
