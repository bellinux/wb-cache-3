López I did <b>open</b> <b>up</b> Paraguay to foreign trade and technology, but the steamship made his country vulnerable to invasion and he understandably feared the machinations of his powerful neighbours.|$|E

5|$|Beilein {{is known}} for his Princeton {{offensive}} system, which emphasizes constant motion, passing, disciplined teamwork, and precision shooting. The offense usually starts out with four players outside the three-point arc, and one player {{at the top of the}} key (though at times a post player may operate closer to the basket). From this formation, Beilein's teams not only try to <b>open</b> <b>up</b> space for players to cut to the basket, but also are known for their high number of three-point attempts. On defense, Beilein has become known for employing the 1–3–1 halfcourt zone defense, which is considered to be an unconventional zone defense – though he also regularly employs man-to-man and 2-3 zone defenses.|$|E

5|$|Despite initial hostilities, good {{relations}} between the Portuguese and Chinese would resume in 1549 with annual Portuguese trade missions to Shangchuan Island, following an event where the Portuguese helped Ming authorities eliminate coastal pirates. In 1554, Leonel de Sousa—a later Governor of Macau— established positive relations through an agreement with Cantonese authorities and in 1557 the Ming court finally gave consent for a permanent and official Portuguese trade base at Macau. Although Fernão Pires de Andrade and his Portuguese comrades {{were the first to}} <b>open</b> <b>up</b> China to the West, another significant diplomatic mission reaching all the way to Beijing would not be carried out until an Italian, the Jesuit Matteo Ricci (15521610) ventured there in 1598.|$|E

After several failed scripted insults, Homer manages to get Ned to <b>open</b> <b>up</b> about some of his repressed dislikes, finally admitting he hates his parents, after which he immediately feels better. Dr. Foster declares Flanders cured and he is immediately released. Outside the hospital, Ned is greeted by the townsfolk of Springfield. Ned promises that from now on, if anyone does something he does not like, they will hear about it, which Dr. Foster tells him is very healthy.|$|E
5|$|Finless {{porpoises}} have commonly {{been kept}} in Japan, {{as well as}} China and Indonesia. Ninety four in total have been in captivity in Japan, eleven in China, {{and at least two}} in Indonesia. Japan has had three establishments designated for breeding them, and there have been five recorded births. Three calves died moments after their birth, but two survived for several years. This breeding success proved that porpoises can be successfully bred in captivity, and this could <b>open</b> <b>up</b> new conservation options.|$|E

5|$|Flagstaff {{grew and}} prospered through the 1960s. During the 1970s and 1980s, however, many {{businesses}} {{started to move}} from the city center, and the downtown area entered an economic and social decline. Sears and J.C. Penney left the downtown area in 1979 to <b>open</b> <b>up</b> as anchor stores in the new Flagstaff Mall, joined in 1986 by Dillard's. By 1987, the Babbitt Brothers Trading Company, which had been a retail fixture in Flagstaff since 1891, had closed its doors at Aspen Avenue and San Francisco Street.|$|E
5|$|Following European settlement, {{the growth}} of the new colony of New South Wales led to an {{increasing}} demand for arable land. Governor Lachlan Macquarie supported expeditions to <b>open</b> <b>up</b> new lands to the south of the capital Sydney, including one to find an overland route to Jervis Bay, an area which would later be incorporated into the ACT as its only coastal possession. In 1818 Charles Throsby, Hamilton Hume, James Meehan and William Kearns set out to find the route, a task accomplished that same year by Throsby and Kearns.|$|E
5|$|Forest {{fires were}} viewed {{for many decades}} {{as a threat to}} {{protected}} areas such as forests and parks. As a better understanding of fire ecology developed after the 1960s, forest fires were understood to be a natural part of the ecosystem. The earlier policies of suppression resulted in the accumulation of dead and decaying trees and plants, which would normally have been reduced had fires been allowed to burn. Many species of plants and animals actually need wildfires to help replenish the soil with nutrients and to <b>open</b> <b>up</b> areas that allow grasses and smaller plants to thrive.|$|E
