5|$|Between 1989 and 2013, a new {{animated}} television special by TMS Entertainment {{aired on}} NTV every year. The tradition started with Bye Bye, Lady Liberty on April 4, 1989. 2007's Elusiveness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fog</b> was broadcast on July 27 {{as part of}} the 40th anniversary celebration of the original manga, featuring the return of a villain from the original television series, Kyousuke Mamo. A crossover special titled Lupin the 3rd vs. Detective Conan, featuring characters from both Lupin III and Detective Conan, aired on March 27, 2009, attracting a record audience share of 19.5.|$|E
5|$|All {{preparations}} for the operation were completed by {{the first week of}} May and on 9 May the weather was nearly perfect for the attack. The British armada had collected at Dunkirk in Allied-held France and departed port shortly after dark. Two minutes after midnight, the force suffered a setback when Sappho suffered a minor boiler explosion and had to return to Dunkirk, unable to complete the journey. Although this accident halved the ability of the force to block Ostend, Lynes decided to continue the operation, and at 01:30, the force closed on the port, making the final {{preparations for}} the assault. Torpedoes fired from motor launches demolished machine gun posts on the ends of the piers marking the canal, beginning the attack. Ten heavy bombers of the newly formed Royal Air Force then dropped incendiary bombs on German positions, but did not cause significant damage. In spite <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fog,</b> air operations continued as planned under the overall direction of Brigadier-General Charles Lambe. At {{the same time as the}} aerial bombardment began, the long range artillery of the Royal Marine Artillery opened fire on Ostend from Allied positions around the Belgian town of Ypres.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 30 May, Howe sent a signal to all his captains asking if they {{considered}} their ships ready for combat. All but Caesar replied in the affirmative and Howe pushed his ships after the retreating French. Despite holding the weather gage, Howe's pursuit was soon hampered by descending fog, and unable to see or {{come to grips with}} the enemy throughout the whole day, the admiral feared he may have lost his opportunity for battle. However, by 31 May the fog had cleared and the French were still within sight to the north. To the surprise of the British, none of the 26 battleships in the French fleet appeared to show battle damage, whereas many of the British ships were nursing damaged rigging and battered hulls. Villaret had made use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fog</b> to reorganise his force, losing Montagnard and the frigate Seine to the convoy but gaining the independently sailing battleship Trente-un-Mai and Nielly's squadron of Sans Pareil, Trajan, and Téméraire. Villaret had also dispatched the battered Indomptable for home, escorted by an undamaged French ship.|$|E

The authors suggested that the water absorption in D. brasiliensis leaves occurs mainly on the adaxial surface, and the abaxial surface is responsible for gas exchange during and after <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fogs,</b> because <b>of</b> its hydrophobic characteristics and because it contains most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stomata.|$|R
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} December, Orgaz {{received}} reinforcements {{and decided}} to relaunch the offensive on 3 January. This offensive {{became known as the}} Battle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fog.</b> The Republican high command redeployed their units in the Pozuelo-Brunete sector. The Republicans had an army corps led by Miaja with five divisions (led by Nino Nanetti, Modesto, Colonels Perea, Adolfo Prada and Galan) but had little ammunition or supplies.|$|E
25|$|The {{western part}} of the Sunset borders the cold {{northern}} Californian Pacific Ocean coastline, so it tends to get much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fog</b> San Francisco is famous for. The Sunset can be foggy and chilly for some days during summer. The Sunset's finest weather is usually from August through December, when regional air patterns transition from onshore to offshore weather and the area is free of fog. Sand carried by Pacific Ocean winds can be found on roadways and driveways within the first five to ten blocks east of Ocean Beach.|$|E
25|$|Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fog,</b> the French did not realise {{that the}} British had decamped {{until the next}} morning. Clausel pursued, but did not {{come into contact with}} Cole's rear guard until late in the afternoon. Meanwhile, Reille's corps {{attempted}} to use an alternate path across the mountains and wound up marching in a circle. A push on 27 July from Roncesvalles Pass by troops personally commanded by Marshal Soult, got within 10 miles of Pamplona. However, Picton's British and Portuguese forces made a stand on an excellent defensive position near the village of Sorauren, just north of Pamplona.|$|E

25|$|At Riqueval {{they got}} {{an even bigger}} prize: the Germans had left the {{concrete}} bridge standing as the main supply route for their troops on the western bank. The bridge had been prepared for demolition, but the Germans considered the sector impregnable. A company of 6th North Staffs was detailed to rush the bridge before the Germans could blow it. Captain A.H. Charlton and nine men dashed out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fog,</b> bayoneted the machine-gunners guarding the west end, and ran across the bridge in a race with the demolition party emerging from a bunker at the east end (where a memorial erected by the Western Front Association now stands). The Staffords won the race, shooting the Germans and cutting the leads to the demolition charges.|$|E
25|$|In 294 BC the Samnites raided three Roman armies (one {{was meant}} to return to Etruria, one to defend the border and the third to raid Campania). The consul Marcus Atilius Regulus {{was sent to the}} front and met the Samnites in a {{position}} where neither force could raid enemy territory. The Samnites attacked the Roman camp under the cover of fog, taking part of the camp and killing many men and several officers. The Romans managed to repel them but did not pursue them because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fog.</b> The other consul, Lucius Postumius Megellus, who was recovering from illness, assembled an army of allies at Sora, where Roman foragers had been pushed back by the Samnites, and the Samnites retreated. Lucius Postumius went on to take Milionia and Feritrum, two unidentified Samnite towns.|$|E

30|$|Fog {{computing}} is {{an important}} paradigm to help address <b>the</b> requirements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> IoE that are not completely covered by the Cloud; nonetheless, <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> this technology creates new challenges. <b>The</b> <b>Fog</b> needs to support <b>the</b> orchestration <b>of</b> applications and services on demand, with adaptability, while providing flexible performance. In practice, traditional service orchestration approaches that were applied to Cloud services are not suitable for the large scale and dynamism of Fog services, since they can not effectively treat <b>the</b> prominent characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fog’s</b> distributed infrastructure. It is crucial to clearly identify the challenges that differentiate <b>the</b> <b>Fog</b> from <b>the</b> Cloud, {{in order to create}} innovative orchestration solutions able to meet its required characteristics such as high mobility, high scalability, and performance in real-time.

500|$|Konami's Silent Hill, {{released}} in 1999, drew heavily from Resident Evil while using realtime 3D environments {{in contrast to}} Resident Evils pre-rendered graphics. Silent Hill in particular was praised for moving away from B movie horror elements to the psychological style seen in art house or Japanese horror films, due to the game's emphasis on a disturbing atmosphere rather than visceral horror. The game also featured stealth elements, making use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fog</b> to dodge enemies or turning off the flashlight to avoid detection. The original Silent Hill {{is considered one of}} the scariest games of all time, and the strong narrative from Silent Hill 2 in 2001 has made the Silent Hill series one of the most influential in the genre. According to IGN, the [...] "golden age of survival horror came to a crescendo" [...] with the release of Silent Hill.|$|E
500|$|At 15:20 on 15 October 1914, the {{outbound}} Iowan rammed the United Fruit Company passenger {{and cargo}} steamer Metapan {{at the entrance}} of Ambrose Channel outside New York. Metapan had stopped in the dense fog, but Iowan was traveling at a rapid pace. When Iowan had appeared out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fog</b> some [...] from Metapan, the United Fruit ship sounded three blasts on the ship's whistle—warning Iowan of the impending collision. Iowans captain did not alter the ship's course, but did drop her anchor to try and slow the fully laden ship. Nevertheless, Iowan gashed the bow of Metapan and traveled almost halfway through the passenger ship. When Iowan pulled out three minutes later, Metapan began to sink rapidly. Metapans captain ordered his ship to sail at full speed for shoals some [...] distant, on which the ship grounded in [...] of water. A variety of craft—including the nearby British Royal Navy cruiser —responded to Metapans SOS. Even though the ship was resting on the bottom and the passengers in no immediate danger, most of the 78 passengers and 90 crewmen evacuated the ship in lifeboats and were picked up by rescue craft. Iowan, which suffered no casualties among her crew, attempted to return to her pier in Brooklyn, but was unable and instead anchored in Ambrose Channel. Iowans damage was restricted to her bow, which was crushed above the waterline. Two days later, The Wall Street Journal reported that Iowan was anchored off Clifton, Staten Island, and awaiting inspection from surveyors.|$|E

40|$|To {{increase}} profitability for biogas production, new innovative substrates {{and condition}} of operations {{needs to be}} implemented. At the current state, fats, oils and greases (FOGs) represent a promising substrate even though it brings operational challenges to the anaerobic digestion process. By utilizing hydrodynamic cavitation (HC) as a pre-treatment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>FOGs,</b> <b>the</b> efficiency <b>of</b> FOGs’ co-digestion with wastewater sludge can be significantly improved. Preliminary experiments conducted on oil and water demonstrates that the HC pre-treatment improves the oil solubilisation as well as forms stable oil and water emulsion that last for several hours. The pre-treatment also improved the soluble chemical oxygen demand (COD) of biosludge (BiSl) by up to 115 % and the initial degradation rate by up to 35 %.
