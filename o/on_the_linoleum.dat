5000|$|Alec Kreider (then age 16) {{had entered}} the Haines' home without force, {{stabbing}} Thomas and Lisa to death in their sleep, and then after a struggle with Kevin stabbed him to death before promptly escaping before the police could arrive. Communication between the Haines' neighbor, the call-taker at 911, and the dispatcher caused extreme unnecessary delay in police response to the [...] "unknown disturbance". The official timeline notes that it took the first responding officer nearly twelve minutes to arrive {{from a distance of}} four miles, {{in the middle of the}} night with no traffic barriers. Police say this delay had no bearing on the survival of the victims. The parents were found dead in their bedroom and Kevin was found at the opposite end of the upstairs hallway on the floor outside his bedroom. According to police reports, bloody shoe prints go away from Kevin's body and enter the parents' bedroom, and then to the common upstairs bathroom where a shoe print was found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>linoleum</b> in front of the sink. Police presume the murderer attempted to clean up at the sink as blood was also found therein. Bloody shoe prints appeared on lower carpeted steps as the perpetrator exited the house.

40|$|Three bearing-asbestos wastes, {{friction}} material, vinyl-asbestos (linoleum) and cement-asbestos mainly containing chrysotile were characterized. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRDP), scanning {{electron microscopy}} (SEM) with microanalysis observations and thermal analysis (TGA/DTA) were carried out on the materials as received and after heating at 1100 C in order to observe their structural changes and thermal behaviours. A quantitative determination of chrysotile in the friction material was also carried out. To study the influence of CaCO 3 on the decomposition of asbestos, the three techniques were also applied <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>linoleum</b> and cement-asbestos at room temperature and at 1100 C after leaching of the materials with 1 : 3 HCl to remove the carbonates present in the wastes. The {{results show that the}} presence of CaCO 3 prevents the asbestos to decompose according to the known decomposition reactions and leads to the formation of calcium-silicate compounds. When CaCO 3 is removed by washing with HCl, decomposition of asbestos proceeds according to the expected reactions. © 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Many nights after {{finishing}} my shifts of running entrees, pouring wine, and remaining unwaveringly hospitable, I would {{sit at the}} gleaming wooden bar centered in my restaurant of employment and chat with the manager, Mario. Over glasses of Bogle Merlot (the best tasting red wine for its price), we would avidly avoid talking shop or anything restaurant and would discuss more irrelevant topics like travel, World War II, and the ingenuity of Jersey Shore. A young, white woman in her tender young adult years, such as I, and a middle-aged black man, such as he, had many dynamics and opinions to share, and the learning was immense and relentless. One late night at the bar, the discussion turned medical, and Mario confessed that he distrusted and avoided doctors until an illness turned frightfully dire and swore that he would never, never, ever, ever participate in a medical study. At that time I was in {{the hub of the}} hurricane that is 6 th semester of nursing school with pre-planning, informed consent, patient-care, ethics, error reports, and 6, 000 page lectures turning violently in my naïve novice-nurse’s head.

40|$|This article {{springs from}} {{research}} I conducted (2001) on {{the experiences of}} mothers whose children of mixed heritage were attending elementary school in southern Ontario, Canada. Using feminist research methodologies, I explored what role, if any, their children’s mixed ethnicity had played in their mothering and in their children’s elementary school experi-ences. In the literature written by mothers of children of mixed heritage, there is often an undeniable emphasis on the physical body, with a particular focus on bodily differences arising from ethnicity. When mother and child physically appear to belong to different ethnic backgrounds, mothers write of their tangled emotions. Thus, being mixed or giving birth to mixed children may bring about a uniquely heightened awareness of the body as body and facial parts are analyzed and examined for the interplay of genetic blends. Participants in this study similarly recounted stories that were rooted {{in the world of}} the body. Mothers discussed facial features, skin tones, hair colour, and how each particular child looked, for example, “more Canadian ” or “more Latin. ” This study also suggests that multiracial individuals experience the concept of physical attractiveness in dramatically different ways because images of mixed ethnic identity, robust health and illicit sexual allure are jumbled together in the eyes of the beholder. Participants recounted lived experiences of this stereotype while simultaneously experiencing that surge of maternal pride that has been felt by many mothers of all backgrounds—monocultural, multiracial, or otherwise—whenever her child receives a compliment. “Are you in the kitchen or the living room?” I looked down at my feet.

40|$|At present, sensory {{evaluation}} {{is not yet}} integrated in all labels and standards. After comparison and interpretation of the weaknesses and {{the strengths of the}} several existing methods, a methodology has been elaborated. Previous experience in off-odour measurements for environmental field investigations help us to propose a methodology based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> assessment of odour intensity and hedonic tone. Various floor covering materials were tested in the lab with a self-made instrument. The sampling procedure is based on a "Field and Laboratory Emission Cell" (FLEC). The odour of the material is compared to a 8 -level butanol intensity scale generated through a vaporization chamber and 8 stainless steel capillaries distributing the diluted n-butanol to 8 sniffing ports. First results shows generally a correlation between bad hedonic tone and odour intensity. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> contrary, there are no systematic relations between VOC levels and odour perception. The less odorous materials (PVC) are also the ones with the higher level of total VOC and <b>the</b> <b>linoleum</b> had a strong odour with a low level of total VOC. The explanation lies in the chemical family composition of the emission.

50|$|Other {{materials}} besides rubber {{may be used}} {{to produce}} a stamp. Woodcut and linocut, <b>the</b> carving of <b>linoleum,</b> are art forms based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same principles. <b>Linoleum</b> is much harder than rubber and thus requires special tools. Woodcut is mostly used by professional artists, requiring much talent and patience. Rubber carving material can be purchased, but is marketed as a child's toy and not widely used. Additionally, photopolymer stamps are growing in popularity. They are most often produced in a set of coordinated images using a clear polymer material on an acetate carrier sheet for storage and packaging. The stamps are peeled from the carrier sheet and applied to a clear acrylic handle. This allows the stamper to view the image through the handle and effect precise placement of the image where desired. Photopolymer stamps are generally produced in the United States for sale domestically and internationally. Similar clear stamps made of silicone are produced by U.S. companies in China. Silicone stamps have many of the same properties of the photopolymer stamps. The production of clear stamps makes storage of a large collection of images easier, since they are all used with just one set of various sized handles. They are also often very economical being produced in sets of several images which work together to form a cohesive look.|$|R
