5|$|Laboratory (brown) rats {{may have}} the {{capacity}} for metacognition—to consider their own learning and then {{make decisions based on}} what they know, <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> know, as indicated by choices they make apparently trading off difficulty of tasks and expected rewards, making them the first animals other than primates to have this capacity, but these findings are disputed, since the rats may have been following simple operant conditioning principles, or a behavioral economic model.|$|E
5|$|There is {{a debate}} {{on the origins of}} the word Ahimsa, and how its meaning evolved. Mayrhofer as well as Dumot suggest the root word may be han which means kill, which leads to the {{interpretation}} that ahimsa means do not kill. Schmidt as well as Bodewitz explain the proper root word is hiṃs and the Sanskrit verb hinasti, which leads to the interpretation ahimsa means do not injure, <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> hurt. Wackernagel-Debrunner concur with the latter explanation.|$|E

5|$|However, a close {{examination}} of the excavated tracks may give a more differentiated picture. While there is agreement that the grooves {{in the eastern part}} were cut deliberately into the stone slabs to guide cart wheels, those in the western section are interpreted by some authors as a result of wear <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> appear at all. On the other hand, the marked cambers of this road section may point at deliberate tracks as well. Generally, varying forms of the grooves can also be explained by the long period of operation of the Diolkos, during which modifications and repairs must have significantly changed the appearance of the trackway.|$|E
5|$|One {{issue that}} has arisen is whether a Singaporean who votes {{in a foreign country}} where the right to vote is not {{exclusive}} to nationals of that country is disqualified from voting in a Singapore election. For instance, the United Kingdom permits citizens of Commonwealth countries, including Singapore, who are resident in the UK and have leave to remain there (<b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> require such leave) to register to vote in general elections and local government elections. When queried, the Elections Department stated that since suffrage in the UK is not exclusive to British citizens, Singaporeans who vote there are still eligible to vote in Singapore. However, this interpretation of the PEA has not been tested in court.|$|E
5|$|Antidiabetic {{therapy has}} been {{proposed}} {{as a treatment for}} polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a condition frequently associated with insulin resistance, since the late 1980s. The use of metformin in PCOS was first reported in 1994, in a small study conducted at the University of the Andes, Venezuela. The United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommended in 2004 that women with PCOS and a body mass index above 25 be given metformin for anovulation and infertility when other therapies fail to produce results. However, two clinical studies completed in 2006–2007 returned mostly negative results, with metformin performing no better than placebo, and a metformin-clomifene combination no better than clomifene alone. Reflecting this, subsequent reviews large randomized controlled trials in general have not shown the promise suggested by the early studies. UK and international clinical practice guidelines do not recommend metformin as a first-line treatment <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> recommend it at all, except for women with glucose intolerance. The guidelines suggest clomiphene as the first medication option and emphasize lifestyle modification independently from the drug treatment.|$|E

5|$|In case {{of failure}} with PVS, {{spermatozoa}} are sometimes collected by electroejaculation: an electrical probe is {{inserted into the}} rectum, where it triggers ejaculation. The success rate is 80–100%, but the technique requires anaesthesia and {{does not have the}} potential to be done at home that PVS has. Both PVS and electroejaculation carry a risk of autonomic dysreflexia, so drugs to prevent the condition can be given in advance and blood pressure is monitored throughout the procedures for those who are susceptible. Massage of the prostate gland and seminal vesicles is another method to retrieve stored sperm. If these methods fail to cause ejaculation <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> yield sufficient usable sperm, sperm can be surgically removed by testicular sperm extraction or percutaneous epididymal sperm aspiration. These procedures yield sperm in 86–100% of cases, but nonsurgical treatments are preferred.|$|E
