In 1988, there were about 12,500 U.S. banks with less than $300 million in deposits, and about 900 with more deposits, but by 2012, there were only 4,200 banks with less than $300 million in deposits in the U.S., and over 1,800 with more.

5000|$|However, due to no capital {{requirement}} for <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>assets,</b> ABCP conduits also induce excessive risk taking. For example, banks may spread their capital very thin, {{and invest in}} highly risky projects {{that they would not}} have invested absent the mitigating effects of ABCP conduit on regulatory {{capital requirement}}s. Especially when the sponsor bank is big, ABCP induces high moral hazard. When good state realized, the risky project will yield very high returns, but when bad state realized, the big bank expect government to bail it out. Therefore, banks optimally take on more risk because it does not care about the losses that occur in those states of nature when it goes bankrupt. Creditors will be bailed out and the interest rate at which the bank can borrow is therefore insensitive to bankruptcy risk. This is called [...] "risk shifting"—shifting the risk from banks to the public. Most likely, policy makers find it optimal to bail out the bank, but needless to say, it is socially very costly.|$|E

40|$|After the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, the U. S. banking {{industry}} has significantly transformed its organisation structure from banks into bank holding companies (BHCs) {{as a result}} of the consolidation process, resulting in larger and more complex BHCs. Under the source-of-strength doctrine and the cross-guarantee authority, a BHC is required to inject capital into the bank subsidiary when it is financially distressed. However, these bank-failed resolutions were introduced before the deregulation; therefore, have not taken into account the increased organisational complexity of BHCs since then. Systemic importance of BHCs has recently attracted attention from policymakers and researchers. Accordingly, the complexity of BHCs will generate concerns about the risk implication of their subsidiaries as compared to the stand-alone structure. This thesis consists of three interrelated essays on stand-alone commercial banks, single-bank holding company (SBHC) affiliates and multi-bank holding company (MBHC) affiliates in the U. S. {{banking industry}}. It investigates the role that these financial intermediaries play in (i) banking business activities, (ii) insolvency risk, and (iii) mergers and acquisitions (M&As). The first essay is a qualitative analysis about on- and <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> analysis, <b>asset</b> securitization and derivatives of these banks which provide a thorough understanding of the difference in permissible scopes of banking business activities among stand-alone banks, SBHC affiliates and MBHC affiliates based on Bank’s Uniform Bank Performance Report. The findings show that SBHC affiliates and MBHC affiliates pursue diversification strategies by running a broad range of activities from traditional lending business to <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet,</b> <b>asset</b> securitization and derivatives whereas stand-alone banks are more specialised. However, SBHC affiliates show more concentration on taking deposits, issuing loans and demonstrate the most important role in financial intermediation in the U. S. banking system as compared to MBHC affiliates and stand-alone banks. In a striking contrast, MBHC affiliates are dominant in <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> activities, <b>asset</b> securitization, and derivative activities. This suggests that the MBHC group performs the main role of disintermediation in the U. S. The second essay compares the differences in insolvency risk of stand-alone banks, SBHC affiliates and MBHC affiliates by using U. S. commercial bank data and BHC data from 1994 to 2012. The study’s results show that MBHCs in the U. S. have lower insolvency risk than SBHCs and stand-alone commercial banks at the parent levels, but have significant higher insolvency risk than both at the subsidiary levels. These results suggest that BHC affiliates benefit from an internal capital market and increased diversification from the BHC structure, but face risks of the increased complexity if the number of subsidiaries increases. The third essay investigates the difference in the likelihood of being targets and acquirers among stand-alone banks, SBHC affiliates and MBHC affiliates by using M&A data on U. S. commercial banks from 1997 to 2012. The reported results show that MBHC affiliates exhibit a greater likelihood of being targets than do stand-alone commercial banks, while stand-alone banks have a greater probability of becoming targets than do SBHC affiliates. The findings show that MBHC affiliates tend to have a greater likelihood of being acquirers than do SBHC affiliates. SBHC affiliates have a greater probability of being acquirers than do stand-alone banks. Those banks that acquire another bank within the same MBHC structure tend to be smaller and more financially constrained than those banks acquiring outside the same MBHC structure, whereas targets that are acquired by another bank within the same MBHC structure tend to be smaller, with higher profitability and capital than targets that are acquired by banks from outside the MBHC structure. The results suggest that the MBHC parent attempts to discipline distressed, poorly performing and smaller affiliates by involving them in M&As. To sum up, this study provides four policy implications. First, regulators should devote particular effort to regulating banks at the subsidiary levels to restrict their risk-taking behaviour. In this sense, the regulators should revise the source-of-strength doctrine cross-guarantee authority to ensure that MBHC affiliates can receive their parent’s bail-out in the future when in distress. Second, regarding complexity issues inside BHC structure, regulators should consider risk exposure between banks affiliated with SBHC and MBHC separately. Third, understanding the fact that MBHC parent attempts to hinder inherent risks of their subsidiaries by involving them in successive M&A inside the structure, the bank regulators should put more restrictions on their M&A applications and reveal their problems to the financial market. Finally, stand-alone banks should be encouraged to transform into SBHC affiliates in the future. Consequently, the Federal Reserve should make the path easier for banks to transform into SBHCs to increase their stability in the U. S. banking system...|$|R

40|$|While leases {{are widely}} used to finance {{productive}} assets in the U. S, lease accounting has been sharply criticized for providing incomplete and unreliable information to investors because many leases are arranged <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> as operating leases. As such, a higher cost of equity capital may be required by investors to compensate for unrecorded liabilities and imperfect information. In this dissertation, I provide the empirical evidence as to how equity market participants perceive the <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> leases. ^ First, I investigate the firm characteristics that determine the choice on operating versus capital leases. By summarizing the results from prior literature, I identify the determinants from three areas: operating risks, financial constraints and tax-driven incentives. The results suggest that both economic and opportunistic reasons drive a firm 2 ̆ 7 s lease choice. Specifically, fast-growing, financially constrained, or low-tax firms opt for <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> operating leases. ^ Second, I {{examine the impact of}} <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> operating leases on the cost of equity, and whether it would be different from that of capital leases or conventional debt. The results suggest that <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> operating leases are “value relevant” as indicated by an increased cost of equity capital being associated with greater use of operating leases. However, investors also seem to suffer from the <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> position of disclosed operating leases. The leverage effect of operating leases is largely attenuated relative to capital leases and conventional debt. ^ Third, I explore the role of information intermediaries in compensation for the deficiency in accounting for leases. The results indicate that the cost of equity, with respect to the use of <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> leases, diminishes in greater analyst followings and the existence of credit ratings. Specifically, the diminishing effect of 2 ̆ 7 financial analysts is more pronounced on <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> operating leases than that on capital leases and conventional debt. Lastly, whether a firm is audited by a big 4 / 5 / 6 / 8 firm appears to have no effect on either off- or on-balance sheet leases. ^ This study contributes to the Financial Accounting Standard Board 2 ̆ 7 s lease accounting project and helps investors assess the risk of firms with <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> leases. ...|$|R

The study describes the particular mechanism of structuring mortgage into mortgage credit derivatives as well as <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> financing of the mortgage credit derivatives is examined. Mortgage derivatives, such as an asset-backed security (ABS) and more complex collateralized debt obligation (CDO) structures among others {{are a part of}} the structured finance and have particular features. High-risk mortgage loans are attractive assets as a part of these derivatives since the loans offer better yields than prime class mortgage. On the other hand, the risks are bigger and the risks remain through structuring and off-balance financing. The mechanism of structuring mortgage credit derivatives is described. Structuring involves many market participants and financial intermediaries. Underlying assets of these credit derivatives are certain mortgage loans. Many benefits are evolved including new sources of external finance, credit risk transfer, improved liquidity, increased trading volume, better profits and a chance to straighten the financial supply chain. The benefits of structuring mortgage credit derivatives appear similar to common benefits of structured finance and securitization. Risks and disadvantages occur as well as the mechanism of structuring mortgage credit derivatives is sub-ject to risks or disadvantages. The major risks or disadvantages are the lack of control, asymmetric information, the lack of transparency and disadvantages of credit risk transfer. <b>Off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> finance or financial activities outside of the balance sheet is understudied area although it has a salient role in mortgage derivatives banking. <b>Off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> finance creates plenty of benefits that are a new source of external finance, improved profitability, new tools to attain new lines of business in the banking industry and a possibility to leverage. However, <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> finance is also a subject to increased risk in banking as it increases both risk of deposit, liquidity risk as well as risk of losses, it creates a possibility to leverage and <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> finance also increases financial risk. In addition, the significance of <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> finance is undisputable in the field of modern investment banking.

In particular, this work aims to examine whether and how the increase in <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> credit exposure to credit derivatives, mainly due to loan securitisation, may have affected the growth rate of loans over the past few years, also by distinguishing different categories of loans. For this purpose, we present the results of a panel fixed-effect estimation and of a panel VAR analysis, using quarterly data from the balance sheets of 39 US commercial banks and for a period between 1998 and 2008. The results show that a rise in off-balance credit exposure may have – after some time lags - a negative impact on the growth rate of bank lending, due to the potential and actual losses related to the <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> activities. However, the effects on the single categories of loans depend on their maturity: the negative effect due to an increase in <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> exposure is stronger for long-term loans, like mortgages or real estate loans, while some positive impact on bank lending may arise for short-term loans, such as commercial and industrial loans, because of the liquidity/maturity transformation function associated with securitisation activities.
