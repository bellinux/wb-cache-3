40|$|According to a {{classical}} functional architecture of face processing (Bruce & Young, 1986), sex processing <b>on</b> <b>faces</b> is a parallel function to individual face recognition. One {{consequence of the}} model is thus that sex categorization <b>on</b> <b>faces</b> is not influenced by face familiarity. However, the behavioural and neuropsychological evidences supporting this dissociation are yet equivocal. To test the independence between sex processing <b>on</b> <b>faces</b> and familiar face recognition, familiar (learned) faces were morphed with new faces, generating facial continua of visual similarity to familiar faces. First, a pilot experiment shown that subjects familiarized with one extreme of the face continuum roughly perceive {{one half of the}} continuum (60 to 100 % of visual similarity to familiar faces) as made of familiar faces and the other part as unfamiliar. In the experiment proper, subjects were familiarized with faces and tested in a sex decision task made <b>on</b> <b>faces</b> at the different steps of the continua. Subjects were significantly quicker at telling the sex of faces perceived as familiar (60 – 100 %), and the effect was not observed in a control (untrained) group. These results indicate that familiar face representations are activated before sex categorization is completed, and can facilitate this processing. The nature of the interaction between sex categorization <b>on</b> <b>faces</b> and familiar face recognition is discussed...|$|R

40|$|We analyze {{directional}} dependence and scaling of air log permeability statistics characterizing minipermeameter measurements by Tidwell and Wilson <b>on</b> the <b>faces</b> of a 30 by 30 by 30 cm(3) size unsaturated block of Berea sandstone. We find distinct {{differences between the}} statistics and scaling behaviors of data measured <b>on</b> <b>faces</b> parallel and normal to bedding, and of incremental measurements in three orthogonal directions along these faces. Whereas the distribution on of data and their increments parallel to bedding are heavy tailed, those of increments normal to bedding are Gaussian. Order q sample structure functions of increments parallel to bedding scale as powers xi(q) of directional lag, s(d), over limited ranges of s(d). Using moment and extended self-similarity methods of analysis we find xi(q) to be generally nonlinear in q, tending to be concave in q <b>on</b> <b>faces</b> normal to bedding and convex <b>on</b> <b>faces</b> parallel to bedding. Whereas the literature attributes nonlinear scaling of xi(q) with q to multifractals or fractional Laplace motions, we find the data {{to be consistent with}} sub-Gaussian random fields subordinated to truncated (monofractal, self-affine) fractional Gaussian noise. The increments exhibit negative statistical dependence (antipersistence) that varies with direction parallel to bedding and is more pronounced <b>on</b> <b>faces</b> parallel than normal to bedding...|$|R

500|$|Although Caged Bird was {{refreshing}} in its honesty, something {{its readers}} and reviewers value, Angelou's honesty in Gather Together had become, as reviewer John McWhorter perceives it, [...] "more and more formulaic". McWhorter {{asserts that the}} events that Angelou describes in Gather Together and in her subsequent autobiographies require more explanation, which she does not provide, although she expects her readers to accept them <b>on</b> <b>face</b> value. In Gather Together, for example, Angelou insists {{that she is not}} religious, but she refuses welfare, and even though she was afraid of becoming a lesbian in Caged Bird and presents herself as shy, awkward, and bookish, she pimps for a lesbian couple and becomes a prostitute herself. McWhorter criticizes Angelou for her decisions in Gather Together, and for not explaining them fully, and states, [...] "The people in these flamboyant tales—the narrator included—have a pulp-novel incoherence".|$|E
500|$|Melish sent form {{letters to}} {{collectors}} warning that his committee had received offers from speculators {{to buy the}} entire issue and suggesting they act quickly to get their orders in. [...] By the end of July, Melish wrote that 24,000 pieces had been distributed and that the remaining thousand soon would be. Sales were good enough that in February 1937, Melish ordered the 25,000 pieces which remained from the authorized quantity. [...] In addition to those 25,000 coins, 15 more pieces were struck, intended for the 1938 Assay Commission. [...] Because of the legislation, the new pieces resembled the old exactly, including bearing the date [...] "1936". So many were produced that thousands were hoarded by coin dealers. In 1942, Melish offered 16,000 Cleveland Centennial half dollars to prominent dealer Abe Kosoff for any advance <b>on</b> <b>face</b> value.

500|$|Collected by {{date and}} mint mark, no Eisenhower dollar is rare, and a {{complete}} set may be acquired without difficulty. However, many were badly struck, without full detail, especially in 1971 and 1972, and the pieces acquired nicks, or [...] "bag marks" [...] from {{contact with each other}} soon after striking. Although lower-grade silver coins can be melted, this is not practical for Eisenhower dollars {{due to the lack of}} precious metal content, and dealers often try to get any premium they can <b>on</b> <b>face</b> value. Completing a set of highest-grade specimens may be difficult and expensive, especially for the 1971 and 1972 from Philadelphia or Denver, which were not sold in mint sets, and thus only came to collectors through banks. A 1973-D piece, tied with ten other specimens for the finest known of that date and mint mark in near-pristine MS-67 condition sold in June 2013 for $12,925.

500|$|The {{continuing}} student {{protests against}} the war brought Agnew's scorn. In a speech on April 28 in Hollywood, Florida, Agnew stated that responsibility of the unrest lay with those who failed to guide them, and suggested that the alumni of Yale University fire its president, Kingman Brewster. The Cambodia incursion brought more demonstrations on campus, and on May 3, Agnew went <b>on</b> <b>Face</b> the Nation to defend the policy. Reminded that Nixon, in his inaugural address, had called for the lowering of voices in political discourse, Agnew commented, [...] "When a fire takes place, a man doesn't run {{into the room and}} whisper... he yells, 'Fire!' and I am yelling 'Fire!' because I think 'Fire!' needs to be called here". The Kent State shootings took place the following day, but Agnew did not tone down his attacks on demonstrators, alleging that he was responding to [...] "a general malaise that argues for violent confrontation instead of debate". Nixon had Haldeman tell Agnew to avoid remarks about students; Agnew strongly disagreed and stated that he would only refrain if Nixon directly ordered it.|$|E
500|$|In November 1980 Genesis bought Fisher Lane Farm, a {{farmhouse}} with an adjoining cowshed near Chiddingfold, Surrey, as their new rehearsal and recording facility. The building was remodelled into {{a studio in}} four months before recording for Abacab began in March 1981. The new environment had a productive effect on the writing process as the band wrote enough for a double album, but they discarded one hour's worth of songs that sounded too similar to their past albums. Banks said a conscious {{effort was made to}} keep melodies as simple as possible which signalled further changes in their direction. The shift was underlined in its production when Hentschel, their producer and engineer since 1975, was replaced by Hugh Padgham after Collins liked his production <b>on</b> <b>Face</b> Value and Gabriel's third solo album.
