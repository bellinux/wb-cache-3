The answer to this is that with lean we are always interested in making many small improvements. We are not looking for the [...] "silver bullet" [...] that will solve all problems. On the contrary, we are looking to engage the entire work force in many smaller changes that lead to massive improvement over time. It is, of course, our <b>objective</b> <b>over</b> <b>time</b> to largely eliminate most of these wasteful accounting processes, but at the earlier stages of lean change we are content to improve the processes, provide learning to the finance people, and free up their time for the more significant lean changes in the future.|$|E
40|$|Such major scandals as {{the savings}} and loan {{failures}} in the late 1980 s and 1990 s, the Enron, Global Crossing, WorldCom and Tyco corporate scandals, Arthur Andersen’s demise, and the current crisis of the financial system have all been linked directly or indirectly to false, misleading, or untruthful accounting. Thus, in a pragmatic sense the question of the veracity of accounting or what it could mean for accounting to be true seems to exist. The assertion of a false or misleading financial report implies some belief that there could exist a true or not-misleading report. Accounting-standard setters have finessed this issue by agreeing that “decision usefulness,” not truth, is financial reporting’s ultimate <b>objective.</b> <b>Over</b> <b>time</b> they have gravitated to a coherence notion of truth to provide rationales for accounting policy. The result has been a serious conflict between the content of financial accounting and the auditing of that content. In this paper we describe this conflict and its consequences and, relying on John McCumber’s work, provide an argument about how accounting scholars and practitioners might begin to think more cogently about what a truthful type of corporate reporting might be. We suggest that accounting-standard setters have too narrowly construed what accounting’s role in democratic society is and how the contradictions of current standard-setting jeopardize the essential professional franchise of accountants, the audit function...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} use of hedonic pricing to {{identify}} the value of relevant production and type traits for dairy bulls in Alberta. A hedonic pricing model is estimated that models semen price {{as a function of}} individual production and longevity characteristics for a sample of Holstein bulls. This model corrects for sources of statistical bias in the data (i. e., censored data and endogenous supply problems). The results suggest that the most important characteristics in valuing dairy bulls are milk volume, protein and fat content, general conformation, body capacity, the popularity of the bull, and the probability that the bull's semen may be in short supply. This methodology may be used to establish a method of forecasting semen prices for newly proven bulls. The valuation procedure may be easily updated and adjusted as producers' breeding <b>objectives</b> change <b>over</b> <b>time</b> due to the changing economic environment. Further extensions of this method may be done to incorporate other characteristics and/or to assess shifts in producer breeding <b>objectives</b> <b>over</b> <b>time.</b> The results of this analysis suggest that hedonic pricing may be a superior method of placing a value on production and type characteristics for dairy bulls than the Lifetime Profit Index, currently being used by the Canadian dairy industry.

40|$|Background: The need {{to balance}} {{resources}} between community and hospital-based {{mental health services}} in the post-deinstitutionalisation era has been well-documented. However, few indicators {{have been developed to}} monitor the relationship between community and hospital services, in either developed or developing countries. There is a particular need for such indicators in the South African context, with its history of inequitable services based in custodial institutions under apartheid, and a new policy that proposes the development of more equitable community-based care. Indicators are needed to measure the distribution of resources and the relative utilisation of community and hospital-based services during the reform process.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{interest}} in implementing online control frameworks that manage distributed computing systems for power and performance objectives. While such frameworks continuously manage the system to optimize resource allocation and respond to dynamic environment input, they often rely upon static models of application behavior that do not adapt to slow behavior changes that occur during normal operation. By introducing adaptive models that dynamically adjust to the changing performance profile of an application, a robust controller can maintain performance objectives through normal changes that can occur in production and those introduced by software errors.

30|$|Most FFS {{sites were}} {{abandoned}} after reporting impacts that occurred {{within one year}} after treatment. However, managers at the FFS site in the southern Appalachian Mountains {{have been able to}} continue the prescribed burning and mechanical treatments for over 13 years. The primary objective of the managers of the Appalachian site is to reduce wildfire severity by reducing live and dead fuels. Their secondary objectives are to increase oak reproduction and to improve wildlife habitat by increasing cover of grasses and forbs. It may be possible to obtain each of these goals by restoring this community to the open woodland habitat (described in syntheses by Stanturf et al. 2002 and Van Lear and Waldrop 1989). Numerous variables measured {{in the first year of}} the Appalachian FFS study strongly indicated that repeated entries of fire or mechanical treatments or both were necessary to reach these objectives. If the fuel-reduction treatments on the Appalachian FFS site can meet manager <b>objectives</b> <b>over</b> <b>time,</b> they will provide much of the information identified as top knowledge gaps by managers.

40|$|The {{principal}} {{objective of this}} thesis is to determine why, how and with what outcomes means tests for 'non-income-replacement' benefits were adopted in England and Wales from the mid- 1960 s to the mid- 1990 s. The approach taken is to explore four benefits: free prescription medicines; free school meals; student grants; and civil legal aid. I use documents to identify the objectives, administrative details and design of the benefits which {{are the focus of}} this thesis. The method used to find out how many and what sorts of people were eligible under the means tests is microsimulation with micro-data. There was no high point of generosity in the mid- 1970 s for these benefits, as the historiography often suggests. These four benefits had very different objectives. There was also incoherence in <b>objectives</b> <b>over</b> <b>time,</b> as governments struggled with spending constraints rather than following a welfare ideology, which serves to undermine theories which assume that welfare states are a unified institution. The changing income levels for entitlement for benefit show that who was deemed to be 'in need' of a particular benefit shifted <b>over</b> <b>time.</b> The results show little support for the theory of middle class 'capture' of the welfare state, which implies that the influence of pressure groups on welfare state change is more subtle than that theory suggests. Although the intention of restricting entitlement for all the benefits was achieved, they were not very well targeted on those with the lowest incomes, especially in the 1990 s. This finding shows that the outcome did not meet all the stated objectives, with implications for the design of future policy. I also find that means tested benefits have embodied values, which are not necessarily made explicit as policy objectives. This, along with the failure to target effectively, demonstrates that the way a means testing policy is implemented does matter...|$|R

40|$|Effective {{monitoring}} requires clear {{questions and}} a well-designed sampling regime. However, <b>objectives</b> often evolve <b>over</b> <b>time</b> which can render the initial sampling design ineffective. Using a vegetation monitoring program employed in Newnes Plateau Shrub Swamps, Australia, {{as a case}} study, we examine a sampling design based on small numbers of 400 m 2 plots to assess if it can meet the stated monitoring objectives of detecting significant changes in number and abundance of species per wetland. To determine this, we intensively sampled four monitored wetlands using randomly distributed 4 m 2 plots to obtain representative estimates of species composition and abundance. The 400 m 2 plots captured 91 % of the common species and a similar proportional distribution of life-forms as found in the 4 m 2 plots, but missed 62 % of the sparse species found in 4 m 2 plots. Insufficient replication of 400 m 2 plots made detection of statistically significant changes at the swamp scale difficult or impossible.

Consequently, RISE maintains the speed of current state-of-the-art incremental sparse least-squares methods while providing superior robustness to objective function nonlinearities. I...|$|R
40|$|Inaugural Lecture {{presented}} by Prof. Peet Venter, Graduate School of Business Leadership, University of South Africa, 24 March 2009. The marketing concept, {{one of the}} most enduring concepts in marketing theory, states that satisfying customer needs will lead to the attainment of organisational goals, such as profitability. The marketing concept can be described as “planning and coordinating all company activities around the primary goal of satisfying customer needs [as] the most effective means to attain and sustain competitive advantage and achieve company <b>objectives</b> <b>over</b> <b>time.</b> ” (Walker. Mullins, Boyd & Larréché 2006 : 12). There is strong theoretical support for the notion that market orientation is how the marketing concept manifests itself in the organisation, and strong evidence that it leads to superior performance, financially and otherwise (Shoham, Rose & Kropp, 2005). Market orientation is highly dependent on the generation and dissemination of marketing intelligence to marketing decision-makers and influencers, and responses by decision-makers to marketing intelligence. There is a strong theoretical basis for the positive link between marketing intelligence and tactical and strategic marketing decision making. For example, studies have found a positive relationship between marketing intelligence systems and several categories of marketing decision making (Lackman, Saban and Lanasa, 2000). Therefore, {{perhaps more than any other}} organisational function, marketing is dependent on the availability of information from the external and internal environment to ensure that customers’ needs are met profitably. The rise of globalisation and global marketing, increasing focus on customer needs and the trend towards non-price competition in an experience economy provide further impetus to the need for marketing information.

40|$|Over {{the past}} 30 years, Agri-Environmental Policies (AEP) in the EU have {{developed}} with relative national autonomy {{and according to}} the subsidiarity principle. The environmental directives represent an increase in EU-level environmental ambitions and challenge the current implementation of EU AEP by creating an increasingly demanding set of regulations with which each member state must comply. National AEP implementation may, however, maintain original characteristics and fail to adopt or transform as EU policy implementation proceeds or when EU policies develop. This creates a potential gap between EU policies and national policy implementation resulting in the ensuing national policy dynamics and adaptations becoming issues of interest. This raises a central question regarding the extent to which national AEP implementation can help us predict whether AEP will be suitable to achieve environmental directive objectives nationally in the future. In this paper, we first investigate the dynamics in the implementation of national Agri-Environmental Schemes (AES) through changes in (i) AES policy <b>objectives</b> <b>over</b> <b>time,</b> (ii) administrative implementation structures, and (iii) administrative policy decision structures in the Netherlands, Denmark, Greece, Austria and Romania. Second, we examine the extent to which various factors have influenced the development of national policies <b>over</b> <b>time.</b> The study identifies development based on the theory of ‘process of institutional change’, i. e. we qualitatively estimate the costs of change based on proposed factors including economic conditions in relation to AES implementation, political institutional capacity, policy legacy, policy preferences, and current discourse. On this background, we identify differences in implementation strategies or outcomes in terms of inertia, absorption and transformation, which are characteristic of the national responses to changing AEP at the EU level. We discuss AES dynamics; whether policy content or structures should be in focus for future policy design and the implications of these findings for the future role of AEP in fulfilling environmental directives and argue why a one size fits all rule does not adequately cover current AES development...|$|R

Technical and managerial capacities usually differ for different forest products, market opportunities and degrees of market knowledge. Local communities or small-scale forest operators face difficulties in adjusting traditional practices to implement official forestry regulations, {{that are usually}} drafted with little harmonization of different management objectives and also little consideration of local socio-ecological contexts. Strategies that optimize trade-offs, by nature more complex than trade-offs in single-commodity production systems, have been neglected. Although the available evidence suggests that formal management practices favor specialization over integration, studies that attempted to discern or draw lessons learned seem, to date, limited. This Special Issue is intended to further {{contribute to the knowledge}} related to biophysical, institutional, regulatory and socio-economic aspects influencing the design, implementation and effectiveness of multiple use management throughout the forested tropics. A few messages emerge. Although the constraints impeding the implementation of multiple use of forests differ little from the constraints in plans that only include timber, the required trade-offs in the former are expected to be more problematic. Refining the scientific basis for assessing and minimizing trade-offs at different spatial scales is warranted. As important as it may be to establish multiple use objectives from the outset and involve different stakeholders in the planning process, social learning and multi-stakeholder dialogue in the context of adaptive management are needed to maintain these <b>objectives</b> <b>over</b> <b>time,</b> both from the top down and the bottom up.

By integrating information from different disciplinary fields and at different spatial scales, concerning soils, climate, vegetation, geomorphology, economic and social drivers, it assesses alternative land uses with consideration of socio-economic and environmental <b>objectives.</b> <b>Over</b> <b>time,</b> the increasing complexity of such an analysis has shown the limits of traditional approaches proposed by Food and Agricultural Organisation and other international institutions in the second half of the 20 th century, to deal with relatively new phenomena, such as those related to global change. Among the recent methodological proposals, agro-ecological zoning (AEZ) has gained increasing attention of scholars. Global change affects all the variables to be considered for land evaluation and in particular those affecting land productivity and economic consequences, but only rarely they have been jointly considered. Moreover, the possibility of simulating agro-ecosystems over long-time periods in many parts of the world is limited by the great efforts required for data acquisition and the many sources of errors. Our study aims to demonstrate the opportunity to explore the use of virtual territories as analogues of controlled field experiments, in order to carry out scenario analysis of agro-ecosystems, which may exist or not at the moment. Virtual territories exhibit morphological, ecological and land cover features statistically similar to selected existing territories. Provided this basic prerequisite is met, a virtual territory is built as a coherent set of geographic information system layers and databases on which the effects of global change phenomena (e. g., climate and land use changes) can be simulated under different scenarios. The advantages are: the possibility of having full control of the experimental conditions; the possibility of setting up factorial experiments with combinations of different typologies or levels of climate, physical conditions, socio-economic development, etc.; the efficiency and the flexibility of the tools adopted to easily generate realistic landscape and their variants. The approach is demonstrated through the development of erosion analysis under climate change scenarios...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The vector {{evaluated}} particle swarm optimisation (VEPSO) {{algorithm is}} a multi-swarm variation of particle swarm optimisation (PSO) used to solve static multi-objective optimi-sation problems (SMOOPs). Recently, VEPSO {{was extended to}} the dynamic VEPSO (DVEPSO) algorithm to solve dynamic multi-objective optimisation problems (DMOOPs) that {{have at least one}} <b>objective</b> that changes <b>over</b> <b>time.</b> The search process of DVEPSO is driven through local and global guides that can be updated in various ways. This paper investigates the influence of various guide update approaches on the performance of DVEPSO. DVEPSO is also compared against a competitive-cooperative evolutionary algorithm. The results indicate that DVEPSO performs well in fast changing environments, but struggles to converge to discontinuous Pareto-optimal fronts (POFs). I...|$|R
