5|$|Ethology is {{the study}} of animal {{behavior}} (particularly that of social animals such as primates and canids), and is sometimes considered a branch of zoology. Ethologists have been particularly concerned with the evolution of behavior and the understanding of behavior in terms of the theory of natural selection. In one sense, the first modern ethologist was Charles Darwin, whose book, The Expression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Emotions</b> in Man and Animals, influenced many ethologists to come.|$|E
5|$|Darwin was a {{prolific}} writer. Even without {{publication of his}} works on evolution, {{he would have had}} a considerable reputation as the author of The Voyage of the Beagle, as a geologist who had published extensively on South America and had solved the puzzle of the formation of coral atolls, and as a biologist who had published the definitive work on barnacles. While On the Origin of Species dominates perceptions of his work, The Descent of Man and The Expression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Emotions</b> in Man and Animals had considerable impact, and his books on plants including The Power of Movement in Plants were innovative studies of great importance, as was his final work on The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms.|$|E
5|$|Two of Alkan's {{substantial}} {{works from}} this period are musical paraphrases of literary works. Salut, cendre du pauvre, Op.45 (1856), follows {{a section of the}} poem La Mélancolie by Gabriel-Marie Legouvé; while Super flumina Babylonis, Op.52 (1859), is a blow-by-blow recreation in music <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emotions</b> and prophecies of Psalm 137 ("By the waters of Babylon..."). This piece is prefaced by a French version of the psalm which {{is believed to be the}} sole remnant of Alkan's Bible translation. Alkan's lyrical side was displayed in this period by the five sets of Chants inspired by Mendelssohn, which appeared between 1857 and 1872, as well as by a number of minor pieces.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{recollection}} <b>of</b> autobiographical memories {{can trigger}} emotions. Research shows that <b>the</b> intensity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emotion</b> experienced at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> event decreases over time, such that <b>the</b> intensity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emotion</b> associated with <b>the</b> recollection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> event {{is less than}} <b>the</b> intensity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emotion</b> experienced during <b>the</b> event.

5|$|Puzzled by the {{geographical}} distribution of wildlife and fossils he {{collected on the}} voyage, Darwin began detailed investigations and in 1838 conceived his theory of natural selection. Although he discussed his ideas with several naturalists, he needed time for extensive research and his geological work had priority. He was writing up his theory in 1858 when Alfred Russel Wallace sent him an essay that described the same idea, prompting immediate joint publication of both of their theories. Darwin's work established evolutionary descent with modification as the dominant scientific explanation of diversification in nature. In 1871 he examined human evolution and sexual selection in The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, followed by The Expression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Emotions</b> in Man and Animals (1872). His research on plants was published {{in a series of}} books, and in his final book, The Formation of Vegetable Mould, through the Actions of Worms (1881), he examined earthworms and their effect on soil.|$|E
5|$|The Stoics {{sought to}} be free of the unruly emotions, which they {{regarded}} as being contrary to nature. The passions or emotions (pathe) are the disturbing element in right judgment. Chrysippus wrote a whole book concerning the therapy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emotions.</b> The passions are like diseases which depress and crush the soul, thus he sought to eradicate them (apatheia). Wrong judgements turn into passions when they gather an impetus of their own, just as, when one has started running, it is difficult to stop. One cannot hope to eradicate the emotions when one is in the heat of love or anger: this can only be done when one is calm. Therefore, one should prepare in advance, and deal with the emotions in the mind as if they were present. By applying reason to emotions such as greed, pride, or lust, one can understand the harm which they cause.|$|E
25|$|While {{debates on}} the subject continues, in January 1871 Darwin started on another book, using left over {{material}} on emotional expressions, which became The Expression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Emotions</b> in Man and Animals.|$|E
60|$|Then Wyllard gave {{another a}} glimpse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emotion</b> that he {{generally}} kept hidden deep in him.|$|R
40|$|In <b>the</b> {{philosophy}} <b>of</b> <b>emotion,</b> {{theories that}} favor <b>the</b> cognitive side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emotion</b> process have incorporated a rich account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intentionality <b>of</b> <b>emotion,</b> while forfeiting <b>the</b> essential place <b>of</b> feelings in emotional experience. In contrast, proponents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> non-cognitive side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emotion</b> process have provided {{an account of}} feelings, but at <b>the</b> risk <b>of</b> leaving out <b>the</b> intentionality <b>of</b> <b>emotions.</b> 1 aim to conceptualize feelings in order to intentionalize them. Feelings, as an essential constituent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emotion</b> process, are necessary for providing a more complete account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relation between <b>the</b> recognition <b>of</b> an object and the emotional response to it. I argue that feelings are conceptually contentful and thus coupled to <b>the</b> objects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world. Also, I claim that these emotional feelings can {{play a significant role}} in providing us with information about the way the world is...|$|R

25|$|Two of {{his later}} books {{were devoted to}} the study of animal {{emotions}} and psychology; The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex in 1871 and The Expression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Emotions</b> in Man and Animals in 1872. Darwin's work inspired William James's functionalist approach to psychology. Darwin's theories of evolution, adaptation, and natural selection have provided insight into why brains function the way they do.|$|E
25|$|Because {{ethology}} {{is considered}} a topic of biology, ethologists have been concerned particularly with the evolution of behaviour and the understanding of behaviour {{in terms of the}} theory of natural selection. In one sense, the first modern ethologist was Charles Darwin, whose book The Expression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Emotions</b> in Man and Animals influenced many ethologists. He pursued his interest in behaviour by encouraging his protégé George Romanes, who investigated animal learning and intelligence using an anthropomorphic method, anecdotal cognitivism, that did not gain scientific support.|$|E

25|$|Consider {{also the}} {{transformation}} of intimacy. Giddens asserts that intimate social relationships have become 'democratised', so that the bond between partners – even within a marriage – {{has little to do}} with external laws, regulations or social expectations, but is based on the internal understanding between two people – a trusting bond based on emotional communication. Where such a bond ceases to exist, modern society is generally happy for the relationship to be dissolved. Thus we have 'a democracy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emotions</b> in everyday life' (Runaway World, 1999).|$|E
25|$|The Toegye School, {{founded by}} Yi Hwang, {{believed}} that Li (rationality) was absolute, while Qi (material) was relative (this, however, {{does not mean}} that they believed that the Li was in any way superior to the Qi). They also believed that the Li and the Qi were completely different, and that the human ethics were Li (rational), while the human emotions were Qi (material). The latter idea was attacked by Yi I, who believed that ethics were just a positive side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emotions.</b> The Toegye School were the majority of the Southerners, and remained the contender of the Giho School to the eighteenth century.|$|E
25|$|Feeling or affective {{reaction}} (vedana) {{is also at}} {{the source}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emotions</b> and it is categorized in various ways; as physical or mental, as pleasant, unpleasant or neutral; and as rooted in the different senses. The Buddha also makes a distinction between worldly and unworldly or spiritual feelings, seeing spiritual feelings as superior. Out of these basic immediate reactions {{as well as our}} situational context, conceptualization and personal history arise more complex emotions, such as fear, hatred, hope or despair. The Buddhist theory of emotions also highlights the ethical and spiritual importance of positive emotions such as compassion and friendliness as antidotes for negative emotions and as vehicles for self development.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- In this paper, <b>the</b> {{latest version}} <b>of</b> an emotion {{extraction}} engine used for real time Internet text communication is presented. The engine can analyse input text from a chat environment, extract <b>the</b> <b>emotion</b> being communicated, and deliver the parameters necessary to invoke an appropriate expressive image on screen to the communicating user display. The parameters include <b>the</b> <b>emotion</b> extracted from <b>the</b> text being typed and <b>the</b> intensity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emotion.</b> <b>The</b> measurement <b>of</b> duration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> expression displayed {{is also possible}} being an agreed function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emotion</b> intensity. Semantic analysis is used to extract emotional words. Analysing the individual word position, <b>the</b> person <b>the</b> <b>emotion</b> is referred to, and <b>the</b> time <b>the</b> <b>emotion</b> occurred, identification <b>of</b> emotional words, as well as using {{of a set of}} grammatical rules allow the engine to perform satisfactorily. Static and dynamic tests were carried out in order to test the engine performance. ...|$|R
30|$|Strictly speaking, {{variation}} in judgment may exist both in <b>the</b> understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emotion</b> word (e.g., what emotion {{is referred to}} by the word upset) and in <b>the</b> categorization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> encoded <b>emotion</b> (e.g., what emotion type and intensity level <b>the</b> <b>emotion</b> upset belongs to). In this paper, we do not make the distinction between an <b>emotion</b> word and <b>the</b> <b>emotion</b> it refers to (i.e., the word upset vs. <b>the</b> <b>emotion</b> upset), but see Nabi (2002) and Russell (1991) for a discussion on possible differences between the two.|$|R
40|$|The {{three most}} {{important}} psychological approaches to <b>the</b> meaning <b>of</b> <b>emotion</b> terms are presented, namely <b>the</b> dimensional, basic <b>emotion,</b> and componential emotion approaches. According to the dimensional approaches <b>the</b> <b>emotion</b> domain can be represented by a small number <b>of</b> continuous dimensions. <b>The</b> basic <b>emotion</b> approach assumes that <b>the</b> <b>emotion</b> domain is organized into categorically different affect programs. This approach has inspired psycholinguistic research that represents <b>the</b> <b>emotion</b> domain by hierarchical structures. <b>The</b> componential <b>emotion</b> approach represents emotion terms by profiles of activity in each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emotion</b> components. Although these three approaches are in many respects incompatible {{when it comes to}} <b>the</b> presumed underlying <b>emotion</b> processes, they are compatible with respect to <b>the</b> meaning <b>of</b> <b>emotion</b> terms. <b>The</b> chapter ends by discussing how the GRID paradigm, which is based on <b>the</b> componential <b>emotion</b> approach, can also be fruitfully applied to study categorical and dimensional representations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emotion</b> domain...|$|R
25|$|I/O {{psychologists are}} {{involved}} in the research and the practice of occupational stress and design of individual and organizational interventions to manage and reduce the stress levels and increase productivity, performance, health and wellbeing. Occupational stress can have implications for organizational performance because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emotions</b> job stress evokes. For example, a job stressor such as conflict with a supervisor can precipitate anger that in turn motivates counterproductive workplace behaviors. I/O research has examined the association between work stressors and aggression, theft, substance abuse, and depressive symptoms. A number of models have been developed to explain the job stress process, including the person-environment fit model and the demand-control model. Those models became a cornerstone of the emergence, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, of a new discipline relevant to research on occupational stress; the discipline, occupational health psychology, is an offshoot of i/o psychology, health psychology, and occupational medicine.|$|E
25|$|Festinger’s other {{well-known}} {{theory of}} cognitive dissonance, proposed in 1957 offers further evidence for {{why such a}} process might occur. Because emotional experiences are unexpected, they can affect one’s self-concept and thus challenge one’s system of beliefs. According to Festinger, when people’s expectations do not manifest themselves, a cognitive dissonance is created between the expectations and reality and people seek to reduce this dissonance by rationalizing the discrepancy. So after experiencing an emotion, people {{would be expected to}} communicate the event with others in order to help reduce their cognitive dissonance. An article by Thoits emphasizes the importance of the ability of others to assist in the process of coping. Other people are able to offer new perspectives on interpretations of the emotional event. In previous studies, Rimé concluded that emotions necessitate “cognitive articulation” because of their dense, complex nature. By using language to express an experience, people are forced to classify and organize the contents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emotions,</b> and furthermore can concretize and objectivize the experience into a script that can be more easily understood.|$|E

Fluckiger gave the book a positive review, calling it [...] "easily the most provocative work on sexuality to have appeared in a long time" [...] and credited Tripp with offering a powerful challenge to established views about homosexuality and showing command of a range of data from many fields. Fluckiger maintained that Tripp offered the most novel account {{of the way in which}} behavioral expression communicates internal states since Charles Darwin's The Expression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Emotions</b> in Man and Animals (1872), but considered his most original contribution to be his explanation of how erotic feeling depends on [...] "resistance", which might consist of any of several impediments to easy access to sexual satisfaction.|$|E
