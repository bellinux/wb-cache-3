5|$|A league finish <b>of</b> <b>fifth</b> in 1977–78 proved {{sufficient}} {{to qualify for}} Europe. Dutchmen FC Twente were the first opposition. In Enschede, Dave Watson gave City the lead. Twente equalised {{in the second half}} from a free kick.|$|E
5|$|Between 135 and 250 {{men of the}} 5th Regiment, Maryland National Guard mustered {{at their}} armory on the corner <b>of</b> <b>Fifth</b> and Front streets.

25|$|The {{diatonic}} circle <b>of</b> <b>fifths</b> is {{the circle}} <b>of</b> <b>fifths</b> encompassing only {{members of the}} diatonic scale. Therefore, it contains a diminished fifth, in C major between B and F. See structure implies multiplicity.|$|R
25|$|The circle <b>of</b> <b>fifths,</b> or fourths, may be mapped {{from the}} {{chromatic}} scale by multiplication, and vice versa.

5|$|The Trinity Lutheran Church {{congregation}} {{was founded}} in 1917 and acquired their first church in 1923. By the 1940s the congregation needed a larger place to worship and bought {{a lot on the}} corner <b>of</b> <b>Fifth</b> Avenue and East Main Street in downtown Hillsboro in 1941.|$|E
5|$|After several missions, {{including}} a major {{one in the}} Land of Waves, Kakashi allows Team 7 to take a ninja exam, enabling them to advance to a higher rank and take on more difficult missions. During the exams, Orochimaru, a wanted criminal, invades Konoha and kills the Third Hokage for revenge. Jiraiya, {{one of the three}} legendary ninjas, declines the title <b>of</b> <b>Fifth</b> Hokage and searches with Naruto for Tsunade whom he chooses to become Fifth Hokage instead.|$|E
5|$|Bradford City {{were formed}} in 1903 and were elected into the Second Division {{before they had}} even played a game. Bradford City and Chelsea, in 1905, remain the only teams to be elected into the league before playing a {{competitive}} fixture. The club were promoted to the First Division when they won the Second Division title in 1907–08. In 1910–11 the club recorded their highest league position <b>of</b> <b>fifth</b> and also won their only major honour when captain Jimmy Speirs lifted the FA Cup after he scored the only goal to defeat Newcastle United 1–0 in the final replay. Bradford City's honours also include the Third Division North title in 1928–29 and the Third Division crown in 1984–85, {{as well as the}} Third Division North Challenge Cup in 1938–39.|$|E
2500|$|In practice, {{compositions}} rarely {{make use}} of the entire circle <b>of</b> <b>fifths.</b> [...] More commonly, composers {{make use of}} “the compositional idea of the ‘cycle’ of 5ths, when music moves consistently through a smaller or larger segment of the tonal structural resources which the circle abstractly represents.” The usual practice is to derive the circle <b>of</b> <b>fifths</b> progression from the seven tones of the diatonic scale, rather from the full range of twelve tones present in the chromatic scale. [...] Here is how the circle <b>of</b> <b>fifths</b> derives, through permutation from the diatonic major scale: ...|$|R

5|$|Bruce {{began the}} 1984–85 season by scoring an own {{goal in the}} first minute of his debut for Norwich against Liverpool, but went on to score the team's winning goal in the semi-final of the Football League Cup against local rivals Ipswich Town, and was named man of the match in Norwich's victory in the final. Bruce was voted Norwich City Player of the Year, but the team was relegated to the Second Division. Bruce played in every match as Norwich won {{promotion}} {{back to the top}} division at the first time of asking in the 1985–86 season, after which he was chosen to replace the departing Dave Watson as club captain. The following season he helped the club to its highest ever league finish <b>of</b> <b>fifth</b> position.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1590s, Lopez was wealthy and {{generally}} respected. He owned a comfortable house in Holborn {{and had his}} youngest son Anthony enrolled at Winchester College. He incurred the fury {{of one of his}} former patients, Queen Elizabeth's favourite Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex, when he described to Dom António and the Spanish statesman Antonio Pérez occasions on which he had treated Essex for venereal diseases. Learning of this from Pérez, Essex began to assemble evidence implicating Lopez as some sort <b>of</b> <b>fifth</b> columnist in the pay of King Philip II of Spain. The Lord High Treasurer Lord Burghley initially thought Essex's allegations against Lopez absurd; the Queen herself also rebuked Essex.|$|E
5|$|During 6 April, the Ban (governor) of the Drava Banovina, Marko Natlačen {{met with}} representatives of the major Slovene {{political}} parties, and created the National Council of Slovenia, whose aim was to establish a Slovenia independent of Yugoslavia. When he heard the news <b>of</b> <b>fifth</b> column-led revolts within the flanking 4th Army, Trifunović was alarmed, and proposed withdrawal from the border areas, but this was rejected by Petrović. The front along the border with Italy was relatively quiet, with only patrol clashes occurring, some sporadic artillery bombardments of border fortifications, and an unsuccessful raid by the Italians on Mount Blegoš.|$|E

5|$|However, {{despite the}} general superiority of its armored vehicles, by 29 August 1944, {{as the last}} {{surviving}} German troops <b>of</b> <b>Fifth</b> Panzer Army and Seventh Army began retreating towards Germany, the twin cataclysms of the Falaise Pocket and the Seine crossing had cost the Wehrmacht dearly. Of the 2,300 tanks and assault guns it had committed to Normandy (including around 750 Panzer IVs), over 2,200 had been lost. Field Marshal Walter Model reported to Hitler that his panzer divisions had remaining, on average, five or six tanks each.|$|E
5|$|In 1946 Alcoa {{decided to}} build a new rolling mill east of Davenport in Riverdale, Iowa. With the construction, {{concerns}} about postwar unemployment ended. Retailing in Davenport was changed by the inclusion of the automobile into mainstream America. In the late 1940s, parking meters were installed in downtown to encourage rotation of space between different users. Soon there were more cars then the street parking spaces could handle. In 1953, the first multi-story ramp was completed in the state, on the corner <b>of</b> <b>Fifth</b> Street and Brady Street. The large variety of shops kept downtown a retail leader even after the opening of the Village Shopping Center in 1956. Another first for Iowa.|$|E
5|$|In the Gupta period (3rd to 6th century A.D.), folk {{images of}} Matrikas became {{important}} in villages. The diverse folk goddesses {{of the soldiers}} like Matrikas were acknowledged by the Gupta rulers and their images were carved on royal monuments in order to strengthen the loyalty and adherence of the armed forces. The Gupta kings Skandagupta and Kumaragupta I (c. second half <b>of</b> <b>fifth</b> century) made Skanda (Kumara) their model and elevated the position of Skanda's foster mothers, the Matrikas from a cluster of folk goddesses to court goddesses. Since the fourth century, Parhari, Madhya Pradesh had a rock-cut shrine been solely devoted to the Sapta Matrika.|$|E

50|$|Russell {{posited that}} tonal gravity emanates {{from the first}} seven tones of the Lydian mode. As the player ventures further from the Lydian tonic however (and further up the circle <b>of</b> <b>fifths),</b> the tonal gravity shifts. For example, if notes further up the circle <b>of</b> <b>fifths</b> (e.g. 2/3) are used, the tonal gravity is {{probably}} shifting.|$|R

5|$|Of the {{remaining}} contenders, Deadly Dream {{had won the}} fourth race of his three-year old campaign at Penn National, previously winning the Allegheny Stakes and the Militia Handicap. In total, he won seven races out of the 25 he had started. Ecole Etage had won two races in the 1973 season, prior to the Preakness, the General George Stakes and the Preakness Prep. Torsion entered the race with a most recent finish <b>of</b> <b>fifth</b> place in the Preakness Prep and two wins in twelve career starts, one as a two-year-old and one as a three-year-old.|$|E
5|$|Other, smaller areas {{proposed}} for inclusion are {{a group of}} brick houses, some of them blighted, along {{the south side of}} Washington Street between First Street Alley and River; a rowhouse and community garden on the corners of Adams Street and Second Street Alley; and another group of rowhouses along the west side <b>of</b> <b>Fifth</b> Street between State and Congress Streets. The only areas {{proposed for}} removal are large portions of the blocks {{on the west side of}} Sixth Avenue on either side of Fulton. At the time the district was established, they were occupied by large industrial buildings, both of which were later demolished and replaced by parking lots.|$|E
5|$|The Korean zodiac is {{identical}} to the Chinese one. The Vietnamese zodiac is almost identical to Chinese zodiac except the second animal is the Water Buffalo instead of the Ox, and the fourth animal is the Cat instead of the Rabbit. The Japanese have since 1873 celebrated the beginning of the new year on 1 January as per the Gregorian Calendar. The Thai zodiac begins, not at Chinese New Year, but either on the first day <b>of</b> <b>fifth</b> month in the Thai lunar calendar, or during the Songkran festival (now celebrated every 13–15 April), depending on the purpose of the use.|$|E

5|$|Two {{other changes}} take in other {{significant}} buildings. Along {{the north side}} of Ferry at the district's east, just north of the Eighth Ward addition, the boundary would be extended east, taking in another set of rowhouses on the west side <b>of</b> <b>Fifth</b> and the city's former jail and sheriff's office at the northeast corner of Ferry and Fifth. On the north, the Uncle Sam Atrium shopping mall and parking garage complex, occupying most of the block between Broadway and Third, Fourth and Fulton streets would now be included. Built in 1978, it is the only significant example of modern architecture in the district and the last large-scale project built in downtown Troy.|$|E
5|$|A {{ceremony}} of dedication {{was held on}} the afternoon of October 28, 1886. President Grover Cleveland, the former New York governor, presided over the event. On the morning of the dedication, a parade was held in New York City; {{estimates of the number of}} people who watched it ranged from several hundred thousand to a million. President Cleveland headed the procession, then stood in the reviewing stand to see bands and marchers from across America. General Stone was the grand marshal of the parade. The route began at Madison Square, once the venue for the arm, and proceeded to the Battery at the southern tip of Manhattan by way <b>of</b> <b>Fifth</b> Avenue and Broadway, with a slight detour so the parade could pass in front of the World building on Park Row. As the parade passed the New York Stock Exchange, traders threw ticker tape from the windows, beginning the New York tradition of the ticker-tape parade.|$|E
5|$|Hagerstrom {{was then}} sent to Myrtle Beach Air Force Base in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina and Pinnnelas City Air Base in Florida, flying the Bell P-39 Airacobra and Curtiss P-40 Warhawk with the 20th Pursuit Group. In late September he was posted to the 8th Fighter Squadron (8th FS) of the 49th Operations Group and sent to San Francisco, California. After staying at the Mark Hopkins Hotel, he and forty other {{personnel}} moved on to Fort Mason, where sailed to Hawaii along with 1,500 other soldiers. They did not stay long, however, and set sail again, this time flanked by a naval task force. After an overnight stop at Suva, Fiji, they landed at their destination of Townsville, Queensland, Australia. Initially {{there was no one}} there and nothing to do until Brigadier General Paul Wurtsmith, the commander <b>of</b> <b>Fifth</b> Fighter Command, organized a refresher session for the new pilots at Charters Towers Airport. In April1943, he and the P-40-equipped 8th FS relocated to Dobodura Airfield Complex in New Guinea. Shortly thereafter, he was promoted to first lieutenant.|$|E
