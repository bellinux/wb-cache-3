50|$|Resistance {{seam welding}} {{is a process}} that {{produces}} a weld at the faying surfaces of two similar metals. The seam may be a butt joint or an <b>overlap</b> <b>joint</b> and is usually an automated process. It differs from butt welding in that butt welding typically welds the entire joint at once and seam welding forms the weld progressively, starting at one end. Like spot welding, seam welding relies on two electrodes, usually made from copper, to apply pressure and current. The electrodes are often disc shaped and rotate as the material passes between them. This allows the electrodes to stay in constant contact with the material to make long continuous welds. The electrodes may also move or assist the movement of the material. A transformer supplies energy to the weld joint in the form of low voltage, high current AC power. The joint of the work piece has high electrical resistance relative {{to the rest of the}} circuit and is heated to its melting point by the current. The semi-molten surfaces are pressed together by the welding pressure that creates a fusion bond, resulting in a uniformly welded structure. Most seam welders use water cooling through the electrode, transformer and controller assemblies due to the heat generated.|$|E
40|$|The {{demand for}} joining of {{aluminum}} to steel is increasing in the automotive industry. There are solutions based on Friction Stir Welding (FSW) implemented to join these two dissimilar metals but these {{have not yet}} resulted in a reliable joint for the automotive industrial applications. The main reason is the brittle intermetallic compounds (IMCs) that are prone to form in the weld region. The objective of this thesis was to develop and test an innovative <b>overlap</b> <b>joint</b> concept, which may {{improve the quality of}} the FSW between aluminum alloy AA 5754 -H 22 (2 mm) and steel DX 54 (1. 5 mm) for automotive applications. The innovative <b>overlap</b> <b>joint</b> concept consists of an interface with a wave shape produced on the steel side. The protrusion part of the shape will be directly processed by the tip of the probe with the intention of improving the mechanical resistance of the joint due to localized heat generation, extensive chemically active surfaces and extra mechanical interlocking. The innovative <b>overlap</b> <b>joint</b> concept was tested with three different travel speeds and axial forces. The welds were evaluated by visual inspection, microstructure observation and mechanical tests. Conventional overlap joints concept were produced to enable the evaluation of the efficiency of the innovative concept. Furthermore, multi-pass welds, with 2 and 3 passes, for both <b>overlap</b> <b>joint</b> concepts were conducted to verify the improvement of microstructure and mechanical performance. With a single-pass weld the conventional <b>overlap</b> <b>joint</b> concept presented higher strength than the innovative concept. The main mechanisms governing this result were the formation of IMCs and higher reduction of effective thickness in the aluminium alloy sheet for the innovative lap joint concept. The multi-pass welds with 2 passes have shown the best tensile shear strength for both <b>overlap</b> <b>joint</b> concepts, about 50 % efficiency in relation to the aluminium alloy base material. One issue affecting the results {{is the fact that the}} method applied to produce the pre-weld deformation in the steel sheet, at the contact interface, did not yield the originally planned geometric shape for the innovative <b>overlap</b> <b>joint</b> concept...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{effect of}} varying certain {{geometric}} and material property parameter on the stiffness of bonded joints {{has been investigated}} for both single <b>overlap</b> <b>joints</b> and for coach (T peel) joints. An understanding of bonded joint behaviour under load has been gained from this parametric study and this insight {{has been used to}} fashion some design guidelines aimed at optimising these parameters to increase joint stiffness. To develop these design guidelines, laboratory tensile testing of single <b>overlap</b> <b>joints</b> and coach joints, manufactured from steel and aluminium and bonded with either an epoxide or a methacrylate adhesive, was utilised to establish joint stiffness. For single <b>overlap</b> <b>joints,</b> joint stiffness was found to be sensitive to changes in adherend thickness, adherend’s Young’s modulus, bondline thickness and overlap length but indifferent to changes in adhesive material properties, unsupported length and joint width. Coach joints, stiffness was found to be sensitive to changes in adherend material, adherend thickness, fill ratio and outer radius and adhesive material. It must be recognised that the Design of Experiments technique, used to analyse the coach joint samples may have masked some of the effects caused by changes to joint parameters...|$|R

40|$|An {{innovative}} <b>overlap</b> <b>joint</b> {{concept was}} tested {{to evaluate the}} quality improvement of welds between aluminum alloy AA 5754 -H 22 (2 mm) and steel DX 54 (1. 5 mm). The innovation is a wave-shaped interface produced on the steel being directly processed by {{the tip of the}} probe, generating localized heat, extensive chemically active surfaces, and additional mechanical interlocking. Welds with different parameters were evaluated by metallographic analysis and mechanical tests. The best set of parameters was then implemented in a conventional <b>overlap</b> <b>joint,</b> plus in two- and three-passes welding, with the innovative <b>overlap</b> <b>joint</b> concept, to evaluate the effect on microstructure and mechanical efficiency. With a single-pass weld, the new concept presented lower strength in tensile shear tests, but higher strength in peeling tests. The main mechanism governing this behavior was the reduction of effective thickness in the aluminum alloy sheet, due to the flow of steel into the aluminum alloy. The characterization and distribution of the intermetallic compounds were evaluated via SEM-EDX. The two-passes weld resulted in the best strength values in tensile shear tests, reaching about 50 % of the ultimate tensile strength of the aluminum alloy base material. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the {{structural}} analysis of steel to aluminum <b>overlap</b> <b>joint</b> is performed with digital image correlation.

Because the <b>overlap</b> <b>joint</b> is a peculiar structure with non uniform stress distribution, finite element seems to impose itself in order to assess failure. Thus, local mechanical behavior must be identified. Digital image correlation is an accurate method of identifying material behavior after welding.

40|$|To apply {{design rules}} for <b>overlap</b> <b>joints</b> in practice, it is {{necessary}} to agree upon the partial safety for to be used. Values recommended in guidelines vary between 1, 5 up to 10 or more. Since there is no conformation about the value to be used, a designer has to rely on his own judgement. Probabilistic techniues on the other hand, open the possibility to quantify the reliability of a design fule properly. Within this paper the possibilities of probabilistic techniques are illustrated for a simple model to predict the ultimate strength for the static load case. The prediction model assumes that the absolute maximum strength for a lap joint is when the whole of the adhesive layer is at the shear yield strength. The calibration of the matching partial safety factor is done with use of probabilistic techniques.

Discoveries of Stone Age hafting adhesives at archaeological sites in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa have spurred experiments that sought to replicate or create models of such adhesives. Most of these studies, however, have been actualistic in design, focusing on replicating ancient applications of adhesive technology. In contrast, this study tested several glues based on Acacia resin within a materials science framework to better understand the effect of each adhesive ingredient on compound tool durability. Using an <b>overlap</b> <b>joint</b> as a model for a compound tool, adhesives formulated with loading agents from a range of particle sizes and mineral compositions were tested for toughness on smooth and rough substrates.

In automobile manufacturing, laser beam welding is concurring to resistance spot welding due to its high process flexibility and efficiency. The rule of thumb is that a joint can be laser welded if it can be seen, which allows for complex structures to be realised. Nevertheless, studies concerning the mechanical performance of laser welded Mg <b>overlap</b> <b>joints</b> are scarce. The aim of this work was to develop a process for laser welding single <b>overlap</b> <b>joints</b> of 2. 5 mm thick Mg sheets, AZ 31 B, and investigate the mechanical performance of these joints relative to resistance spot welded joints. An Nd:YAG laser was used for the welding experiments, and a design of experiment approach was applied.

To improve the fatigue behaviour, different joint geometries (linear, circular and C-shape) were investigated.

Until recently, the full penetration hole was presumed as an image feature which appears when the keyhole opens {{at the bottom of}} the work piece.

The results show that the occurrence of the full penetration hole can be described as a stochastic process. The probability to observe it increases near the full penetration state. In <b>overlap</b> <b>joints,</b> a very similar image feature appears when the penetration depth reaches the gap between the sheets.

40|$|International audienceThe {{production}} of consistent, high quality laser welds on zinc coated steels for {{the automotive industry}} remains a challenge. A simple <b>overlap</b> <b>joint</b> geometry is desirable in these applications but {{has been shown to}} be extremely detrimental to laser welding because the zinc vapour formed at the interface between the two sheets expands into the keyhole and disrupts fluid flow in the melt pool, which often leads to metal ejection.

High speed video camera visualizations of the keyhole provide insight into the keyhole dynamics during the process.
