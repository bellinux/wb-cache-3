5|$|The Grenade, Hand, Anti-Tank No. 74, {{commonly}} known as the S.T. Grenade or sticky bomb, was a British hand grenade designed and produced during the Second World War. The grenade was {{one of a number of}} anti-tank weapons developed for use by the British Army and Home Guard as an ad hoc solution to a lack of sufficient anti-tank guns in the aftermath of the Dunkirk evacuation. Designed by a team from MIR(c) including Major Millis Jefferis and Stuart Macrae, the grenade consisted <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> sphere containing an explosive made of nitroglycerin and additives (this added stability to the mix, as well as giving it its squash-head-like effect) covered in a strong adhesive and surrounded by a sheet-metal casing. When the user pulled a pin on the handle of the grenade, the casing would fall away and expose the sticky sphere. Pulling another pin would arm the firing mechanism and the user would then attempt to attach the grenade to an enemy tank or other vehicle. Letting go of the handle would release a lever that would activate a five-second fuse, which would then detonate the nitroglycerin.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} is {{inspired}} by horror films and extensively features gothic and horror related imagery, including references to Michael Jackson's Thriller. The video features references to horror cult films such as American Psycho and Saw {{as well as the}} supposedly haunted painting The Hands Resist Him. The Hand Resists Him is a painting created by artist Bill Stoneham in 1972, depicting a young boy and female doll standing in front <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> paneled door against which many hands are pressed. The painting became famous for apparently being haunted. The painting is referenced during a scene in the video where West attempts to hold a door closed, from the monsters outside attempting to enter. The video features mostly naked corpse looking models, some of which are decapitated. West's role in the video is similar to Doctor Frankenstein, with the video set in a castle. Jay-Z appears in the video dressed in a tuxedo, {{standing in front of a}} nude corpse in a darkly-lit library. The video contains two versions of Minaj; a vampire version who is dressed in a gothic inspired outfit (representing her alter ego Roman Zolanski), and a pink-haired version (representing her alter ego Barbie) which the other half tortures during the video. Zombies also appear in the video, with hanging corpses and blood-splattered furniture.|$|E

25|$|Marie {{admitted}} this, but {{she made}} the gardener confirm that {{she gave him the}} arsenic to make rat-poison paste out of it. Their fears were momentarily allayed, but the next day, white residue was found at the bottom <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> of sugar water that Marie had administered to Charles. A third doctor, René de Lespinasse, was called on 13 January. He suspected poison, but by then it was too late: Charles died a few hours afterwards.|$|E
25|$|The west facade {{consisted}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> {{curtain wall}} which sloped slightly inward. The facade projected outward (imitating bays and turrets) at points, and at points it featured a gabled roof. On the south {{corner of the}} building, a circular street plaza sliced into the sidewalk in the west (providing a few parking spaces) while cutting an arc into {{the facade of the}} building. This helped create a transition from the flat southern facade to the more diverse western facade.|$|E

Copper sulfate crystals would be scattered around the cathode and then the jar would be filled with distilled water. As the current was drawn, a layer of zinc sulfate solution would form at the top around the anode. This top layer was kept separate from the bottom copper sulfate layer by its lower density and by the polarity of the cell.|$|E

25|$|A {{series of}} {{improvements}} have been projected for the aircraft, {{such as the}} integration of an autopilot to enable single-pilot operations. Other prospective improvements include the adoption <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> cockpit, de-icing equipment, and air conditioning systems. Early production aircraft are intended to be compatible with the retrofitting of these improvements later on. According to Dornier Seawings, the Seastar's flight endurance can be extended by cruising on only a single engine to around 11 flight hours for surveillance missions. It is also claimed that the Seastar {{is one of the}} fastest flying boats on the market.|$|E
25|$|The user {{interface}} consists <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> plate covered in non-drying opaque black mastic, which constitutes a drawing surface {{upon which the}} user makes marks by scratching through the mastic, and therefore allowing light to pass through at that point. In front of the glass plate sits a vertical bank of twenty photocells that send signals to twenty amplifiers and bandpass filters, {{each with its own}} gain adjust control. It is akin to a ten-octave equalizer with two knobs per octave. The ANS is fully polyphonic and will generate all 720 pitches simultaneously if required (a vertical scratch would accomplish this).|$|E
25|$|Another type {{of carbon}} {{tetrachloride}} extinguisher was the fire grenade. This consisted <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> sphere filled with CTC, that {{was intended to}} be hurled {{at the base of a}} fire (early ones used salt-water, but CTC was more effective). Carbon tetrachloride was suitable for liquid and electrical fires and the extinguishers were fitted to motor vehicles. Carbon tetrachloride extinguishers were withdrawn in the 1950s because of the chemical's toxicity – exposure to high concentrations damages the nervous system and internal organs. Additionally, when used on a fire, the heat can convert CTC to phosgene gas, formerly used as a chemical weapon.|$|E

25|$|Spotted low-density arrays {{typically}} feature picolitre {{drops of}} a range of purified cDNAs arrayed on the surface <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> slide. The probes are longer than those of high-density arrays and typically lack the transcript resolution of high-density arrays. Spotted arrays use different fluorophores for test and control samples, and the ratio of fluorescence is used to calculate a relative measure of abundance. High-density arrays use single channel detection, and each sample is hybridised and detected individually. High-density arrays were popularised by the Affymetrix GeneChip array, where each transcript is quantified by several short 25-mer probes that together assay one gene.|$|E
25|$|The first {{electrostatic}} generators {{are called}} friction machines {{because of the}} friction in the generation process. A primitive form of frictional machine was invented around 1663 by Otto von Guericke, using a sulphur globe that could be rotated and rubbed by hand. It may not actually have been rotated during use and {{was not intended to}} produce electricity (rather cosmic virtues), but inspired many later machines that used rotating globes. Isaac Newton suggested the use <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> globe instead of a sulphur one. Francis Hauksbee improved the basic design, with his frictional electrical machine that enabled a glass sphere to be rotated rapidly against a woollen cloth.|$|E
25|$|These instabilities may {{be caused}} by the {{decrease}} of the friction force with an increasing velocity of sliding, by material expansion due to heat generation during friction (the thermo-elastic instabilities), or by pure dynamic effects of sliding of two elastic materials (the Adams-Martins instabilities). The latter were originally discovered in 1995 by George G. Adams and João Arménio Correia Martins for smooth surfaces and were later found in periodic rough surfaces. In particular, friction-related dynamical instabilities are thought to be responsible for brake squeal and the 'song' <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> harp, phenomena which involve stick and slip, modelled as a drop of friction coefficient with velocity.|$|E
