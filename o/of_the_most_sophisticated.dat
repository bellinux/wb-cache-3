5|$|Beginning {{with small}} bands of nomadic hunter-gatherers, Native Americans have {{inhabited}} the Colorado River basin {{for at least}} 8,000 years. Between 2,000 and 1,000 years ago, the river and its tributaries fostered large agricultural civilizations – some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>sophisticated</b> indigenous cultures in North America – which eventually faded due {{to a combination of}} severe drought and poor land use practices. Most native peoples that inhabit the basin today are descended from other groups that settled in the region beginning about 1,000 years ago. Europeans first entered the Colorado Basin in the 16thcentury, when explorers from Spain began mapping and claiming the area, which later became part of Mexico upon its independence in 1821. Early contact between Europeans and Native Americans was generally limited to the fur trade in the headwaters and sporadic trade interactions along the lower river.|$|E

Their [...] "Memories of El Monte" [...] was {{recorded by the}} Penguins, although only Cleve Duncan of the original group was featured. Buff owned the small Pal Recording Studio in Cucamonga, which included a unique five-track tape recorder he had built. At that time, only a handful <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>sophisticated</b> commercial studios had multi-track facilities; the industry standard for smaller studios was still mono or two-track. Although none of the recordings from the period achieved major commercial success, Zappa earned enough money {{to allow him to}} stage a concert of his orchestral music in 1963 and to broadcast and record it. He appeared on Steve Allen's syndicated late night show the same year, in which he played a bicycle as a musical instrument. Using a bow borrowed from the band's bass player, as well as drum sticks, he proceeded to pluck, bang, and bow the spokes of the bike, producing strange, comical sounds from his new found instrument. With Captain Beefheart, Zappa recorded some songs under the name of the Soots. They were rejected by Dot Records for having [...] "no commercial potential", a verdict Zappa subsequently quoted on the sleeve of Freak Out! ...|$|E
