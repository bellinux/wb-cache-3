Targeting social-network neighbors resonates well with advertisers, and on-line browsing behavior data counterintuitively can allow the identification of good audiences anonymously. Besides being one of the first papers to our knowledge on data mining for <b>on-line</b> brand <b>advertising,</b> this paper makes several important contributions. We introduce a framework for evaluating brand audiences, in analogy to predictive-modeling holdout evaluation. We introduce methods for extracting quasi-social networks from data on visitations to social networking pages, without collecting any information on the identities of the browsers or the content of the social-network pages. We introduce measures of brand proximity in the network, and show that audiences with high brand proximity indeed show substantially higher brand affinity. Finally, we provide evidence that the quasi-social network embeds a true social network, which along with results from social theory offers one explanation for the increase in brand affinity of the selected audiences...|$|R
40|$|Camera {{calibration}} is {{a necessary}} step {{in order to develop}} applications that need to establish a relationship between image pixels and real world points. The goal of camera calibration is to estimate the extrinsic and intrinsic camera parameters. Usually, for non-zooming cameras, the calibration is carried out by using a grid pattern of known dimensions (e. g., a chessboard). However, for cameras with zoom functions, the use of a grid pattern only is not sufficient, because the calibration has to be effective at multiple zoom levels and some features (e. g., corners) could not be detectable. In this paper, a calibration method based on two novel calibration patterns, specifically designed for zooming cameras, is presented. The first pattern, called in-lab pattern, is designed for intrinsic parameter recovery, while the second one, called on-field pattern, is conceived for extrinsic parameter estimation. As an application example, <b>on-line</b> virtual <b>advertising</b> in sport events, where the objective is to insert virtual advertising images into live or pre-recorded television shows, is considered. A quantitative experimental evaluation shows an increase of performance with respect to the use of standard calibration routines considering both re-projection accuracy and calibration time...|$|R

40|$|Automatic keyword {{extraction}} (AKE) from textual sources took {{a valuable}} step towards harnessing {{the problem of}} efficient scanning of large document collections. Particularly {{in the context of}} urban mobility, where the most relevant events in the city are <b>advertised</b> <b>on-line,</b> it becomes difficult to know exactly what is happening in a place. In this paper we tackle this problem by extracting a set of keywords from different kinds of textual sources, focusing on the urban events context. We propose an ensemble of automatic keyword extraction systems KEA (Key-phrase Extraction Algorithm) and KUSCO (Knowledge Unsupervised Search for instantiating Concepts on lightweight Ontologies) and Conditional Random Fields (CRF). Unlike KEA and KUSCO which are well-known tools for automatic keyword extraction, CRF needs further pre-processing. Therefore, a tool for handling AKE from the documents using CRF is developed. The architecture for the AKE ensemble system is designed and efficient integration of component applications is presented in which a consensus between such classifiers is achieved. Finally, we empirically show that our AKE ensemble system significantly succeeds on baseline sources and urban events collections...|$|R
40|$|Summary. The Internet {{is seeing}} a rapid {{increase}} in <b>on-line</b> newspapers and <b>advertising</b> for new products and sales. Yet only primitive mechanisms are available to help users discover and obtain that subset of these news items likely to be of interest. Current search engines are really only first step. For locating news providers, word-of-mouth and mass mailings are still used; for retrieval of news items, users are forced to poll web sites regularly or provide e-mail addresses for follow-up mailings. WAIF is a new framework to facilitate easy user access for Internet users to relevant news items. WAIF supports new kinds of browsers, personalized filters, recommendation systems, and – most importantly – an evolution path intended to enable efficient deployment of new techniques that enhance the user retrieval experience. 15. 1 Challenges Today’s World Wide Web has begun to offer convenient mechanisms for locating and retrieving information.

The positive impacts discussed in the literature include urban core revitalization, employment generation and economic growth. The negative externalities comprise the formation of temporary sub-communities, competition with low-income groups in the rental housing market, and an increase in traffic volume. The current study adds to the literature by focusing on the influence of student influx on rent prices. The importance of this issue derives from the need to understand the net effect of the contradicting impacts of 'studentification' on contemporary urban development for policy implications. While student influx is considered a promising force of urban regeneration, in the literature concerns were raised regarding the detrimental effect of students' temporary sub-communities. The impact of 'studentification' on rent prices is evaluated by hedonic property price analysis incorporating spatial correlations. Data were collected from <b>on-line</b> real-estate portals <b>advertising</b> apartments for rent in the city of Haifa, Israel. The data include apartments characterized by more than a dozen relevant attributes to rental apartment choice including rent price, location, structural features, furniture and electrical appliances. Locations with high proportions of students in the private rented sector were identified on the basis of municipal tax files, as students in Haifa are eligible for substantial municipal tax discounts. The results of this study show the rent price differential between apartments of comparable characteristics located in 'studentified' and 'non-studentified' zones. The paper concludes with a discussion regarding the policy implications of the findings...|$|R

While both of these two approaches work well, the best result is given by a Gaussian Process Regression model, which is significantly better than the similarity-based approach and 10 % better than a baseline similarity method using bag-of-word vectors...|$|E
