5|$|An {{estimated}} 646people {{were inside}} the building when the bomb exploded. By {{the end of the}} day, 14 adults and 6 children were confirmed dead, and over 100 injured. The toll eventually reached 168confirmed dead, not including an unmatched left leg that could have belonged to an unidentified 169th victim or could have belonged to any one of eight victims who had been buried without a left leg. Most of the deaths resulted from the collapse of the building, rather than the bomb blast itself. Those killed included 163 who were in the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, one person in the Athenian Building, <b>one</b> <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> a parking lot across the street, a man and woman in the Oklahoma Water Resources building, and a rescue worker struck on the head by debris.|$|E
5|$|From c.1824 the {{movement}} of European colonists and their farming practices onto Pallittorre lands brought the two groups into often violent conflict. The conflict increased over time. In retaliation for acts by Europeans, killings of settlers by aborigines in 1827 {{appear to have been}} part of a coordinated effort to drive the settlers away. The conflict and violence was from both Europeans and aborigines, though more the former than latter. European disease, deliberate killings, forced exile to the islands of Bass Strait, and the driving of the natives from their land and food sources reduced their population. This reduction was such that during an 1834 visit George Augustus Robinson, Protector of Aborigines, could find only <b>one</b> <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> the area. There are only records of two colonists killed by the Pallittorre. The number of Pallittorre killed is not recorded; Shayne Breen—Lecturer in Aboriginal Studies at the University of Tasmania—has estimated more than one hundred. The removal of the Pallittorre from their land, a pattern echoed across Tasmania, was largely intentional. Deliberate policy, promulgated by Governor Arthur, was to remove the native population from the land and grant it to European settlers.|$|E

25|$|In June 2005, a New Jersey state appeals court, in the {{decision}} Lewis v.

25|$|However, {{political}} {{discussion of}} the possibility of using a constitutional amendment to restrict marriage rights was not unheard of in the 1990s.

25|$|A {{system of}} initialisms has evolved to {{describe}} the variety of group sex arrangements. These codes can appear in erotic literature and film descriptions, member profiles in online communities, and personal ads. These codes consist of arrangements of the letters M (for male) and F (for female). Adjacent letters are sometimes used to signify sexual contact between the participants represented by those letters, though this {{does not necessarily mean}} there is no contact between the other participants. For example, MMF would signify a ménage à trois of two men and <b>one</b> <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> which the center male has sexual contact with the other male and the female, and in which it is not specified whether there is contact between the female and the other male. MFMF (situation pictured in photo to right), on the other hand, implies no same-sex contact.|$|E
25|$|The {{premise of}} the game is that the three superpowers, Russia, China, and America, have each {{secretly}} constructed a vast subterranean complex of computers to wage a global war too complex for human brains to oversee. One day, the American supercomputer, better known as the Allied Mastercomputer, gains sentience and absorbs the Russian and Chinese supercomputers into itself, and redefines itself as simply AM (I think, therefore I am). Due to its immense hatred for humanity, stemming from the logistical limits set onto him by programmers, AM uses its abilities to kill off the population of the world. However, AM refrains from killing five people (four men and <b>one</b> <b>woman)</b> <b>in</b> order to bring them {{to the center of the}} earth and torture them. With the aid of research carried out by one of the five remaining humans, AM is able to extend their lifespans indefinitely as well as alter their bodies and minds to his liking.|$|E
