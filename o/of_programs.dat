40|$|Assurance of {{software}} quality {{and security of}} computer systems have become dominant concerns in our networking age, to which models <b>of</b> <b>program</b> execution are important.

5|$|Advances {{of funds}} – Advances are federal funds {{provided}} to a recipient {{before the program}} activity is performed. Recipients determine the amount needed for a future expenditure (e.g., through budget process) and request the amount {{to the federal government}} (or in the case of subrecipients to the pass-through entity, see Subrecipient Monitoring below). The federal funds received are then expended to perform the specific activity (e.g., purchase good or service or for payroll). However, laws and regulations require recipients to request funds only when it is immediately needed, and recipients must try to minimize the amount of time between the receipts of funds to the actual disbursement. Examples <b>of</b> <b>programs</b> under these funding techniques are the Section 8 program and the Community Development Block Grant program.|$|E

Our research goal is to develop a tool to support the ontology-based utilizing programming styles. Methods: ontological representation <b>of</b> <b>programming</b> styles; object-oriented programming; ontology-driven utilizing <b>of</b> <b>programming</b> styles.
