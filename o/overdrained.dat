40|$|By now, {{it should}} be clear that our {{environment}} is becoming ever less capable of sustaining the growing impact of our economic activities. Everywhere our forests are overlogged, our agricultural lands overcropped, our grasslands overgrazed, our wetlands <b>overdrained,</b> our groundwaters overtapped, our seas overfished, and just about the whole terrestrial and marine environment overpolluted with chemical and radioactive poisons. Worse still, if that is possible, our atmospheric environment is becoming ever less capable of absorbing either the ozone-depleting gases or the greenhouse gases generated by our economic activities without creating new climatic conditions to which we cannot indefinitely adapt. In such conditions, there can be only one way of maintaining the habitability of our planet and that is by setting out methodically to reduce this impact. Unfortunately, it is the overriding goal of just about every government in the world to maximize world trade and create a global economy- which has now been institutionalized with the signing of the GATT Uruguay Round Agreement. To increase trade is justified because it is seen to be the most effective way of increasing economic development, which we equate with progress, and which in terms of the world-view of modernism, is made out to provide a means of creating...|$|E
40|$|Abstract We {{assessed}} {{recent changes}} in the distribu-tion of soil total phosphorus (TP) in Water Conserva-tion Area 3 (WCA- 3) of the Everglades. Soil cores were collected in 1992 and 2003 at 176 sites. To reflect hydrologic boundaries within the system, WCA- 3 was divided into three zones (3 AN, 3 AS, and 3 B). Total P was mapped on both a mass (TPm) and a volumetric basis (TPv) to determine if spatial distributions varied depending on the choice of units. Interpolated maps for both years showed that {{the highest levels of}} TPm were located in 3 AN and in boundary areas of all zones that received surface water inputs of P from canals. Increases in TPm were greatest in central 3 AN in an area adjacent to the Miami Canal that received inputs from a water control structure. Interpolated maps for TPv illus-trated that a hotspot present in 1992 had disap-peared by 2003. The highest levels of TPv in 2003 were located in northwestern 3 AN, a region of WCA- 3 that has been chronically <b>overdrained</b> and burned in 1999. From 1992 to 2003, increases in TPm were observed for 53 % of the area of WCA- 3, while only 16 % of WCA- 3 exhibited increases in TPv. In 1992, approximately 21 % of WCA- 3 had TPm concentrations in the 0 – 10 cm layer> 500 mg kg− 1, indicating P enrichment beyond historic levels. Eleven years later, 30 % of the area of WCA- 3 had TPm> 500 mg kg− 1. This indicated that during this period, the area of WCA- 3 with enriched TPm concentrations increased about one % year− 1...|$|E

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Instıtute of Science and Technology, 2015 Mobil robotlar günümüzde tarım, mayın tarama, askeri uygulamalar, uzay araştırmaları ve insanların erişemediği veya nükleer santraller gibi insanlara zararlı ortamlarda kullanılmaktadırlar. Ancak bu robotların bazıları bir operatörden bağımsız olarak, diğer bir deyişle otonom olarak çalışmaktadırlar. Dünyada çeşitli alanlarda kullanılmak üzere otonom robot geliştirmek için bir yarış vardır.   Bu tezde çeşitli alanlarda kullanılmak üzere (öncelikli olarak tarım alanında) otonom robot ve kontrol ünitesi tasarlanmıştır ve gerçekleştirilmiştir. Projede tasarım yapılırken modülerlik, düşük maliyet, yerli üretime katkı, çevre şartlarına uygunluk ve özgünlük özelliklerine sahip bir robot tasarlanmaya çalışılmıştır. Robotun kontrol ünitesinin robotun taşıyıcı {{platform}}undan bağımsız olmasına dikkat edilmiştir. Çünkü projede kullanılan platformun amaca ve kullanılacağı araziye uygun olarak değiştirilebilmesi istenmektedir.   Tasarlanan kontrol ünitesi içinde batarya kontrol sistemi, bütün sensör verilerini işleyen, diğer kartlarla haberleşen ve robotun motorlarını süren bir anakart ve görüntü işleme görevlerini yerine getirebilecek olan bir mini bilgisayar bulunmaktadır. Anakart açı ve konum sensörleri, mesafe sensörleri, tekerlek hızını ölçen sensörler ve diğer kartlardan bilgiler alarak robotun tekerleklerini motor sürücü vasıtasıyla sürmektedir. Robot platformu altı tekerlek ve alüminyum bir iskeletten oluşmaktadır. Her tekerlek ayrı bir motor tarafından sürülmektedir. Robot kızaklı yönlendirme metodunu kullanarak hareket etmektedir. Yani robotun sağ üç motoru ayrı, sol üç motoru ayrı kontrol edilmektedir. Kızaklı yönlendirme metodu, diferansiyel yönlendirme metoduna çok benzemektedir. Robotun küçük ve modüler olması istendiği için robot tasarımı üç ayrı seviye halinde yapılmıştır. Bu seviyeler sırasıyla gövde seviyesi, kontrol birimi seviyesi ve ek birimler seviyesidir. Gövde seviyesinde robotun iskeleti, motorları ve bataryaları bulunmaktadır. Gövde seviyesine araç geliştirilirken değişiklik yapılması istenmeyen parçalar yerleştirilmiştir. Ayrıca gövde seviyesi, platforma özgü bir seviyedir. Gövde seviyesi paletli, dört tekerlekli, altı tekerlekli bir platform olabilir. Hatta diferansiyel yönlendirme ile kontrol edilebilen bir deniz aracı bile olabilir. Kontrol birimi seviyesinde, robot için tasarlanmış olan kontrol ünitesi bulunmaktadır. Kontrol birimi seviyesi için kısaca robotun beyni denilebilir. Ek birimler seviyesinde ise amaca uygun parçalar bulunmaktadır. Örneğin, aracın açık arazilerde otonom hareket etmesi istendiği için ek birimler seviyesine açı ve konum sensörleri eklenmiştir. Ek birimler seviyesi, gelecekte robota dâhil edilebilecek birimlerin ekleneceği seviye olarak tasarlanmıştır. Sonuç olarak, çeşitli amaçlara uygun olan bir otonom mobil robot ve kontrol ünitesi tasarlanmış ve gerçekleştirilmiştir. Şu anda robot manuel kontrol ve merkez ile haberleşme görevlerini yerine getirmektedir. İlerleyen çalışmalarda görüntü işleme ve kontrol yöntemleri uygulanarak robotun otonom hareket etmesi sağlanacaktır. Robotun ilk olarak tarım alanlarındaki ürün sıraları arasında otonom hareket edebilmesi için açı, konum ve mesafe sensörlerinden aldığı bilgileri, görüntü işleme kartından gelen bilgiler ile birleştirmesi hedeflenmektedir. Mobile robots {{are used}} at agriculture, land mine searching and disarming, military, space explorations, and other applications where {{the environment is}} dangerous or inaccessible to human. In some of these applications, robots perform tasks autonomously. These robots are called autonomous robots. Today in the World, there is race to develop autonomous robot in diversity of fields. In this thesis, an autonomous robot and its control unit {{are designed to be}} used in various fields (especially in agriculture). At the design stage, aim is to create a robot that is modular, low–cost to manifacture, contributing to domestic production, suitable against environmental conditions and original. Control unit of robot has been noted to be independent from the carrier platform. Because it is desired to change robot platform according to intended use and environmental conditions. Designed control unit consists of battery management system, main board and beaglebone (a mini computer board). In every vehicle, robot or electronic device that powered by Lithium Polymer (LiPo), or similar chemistry batteries must be used with battery management system. Because these battery types have operating voltage, current and temperature range. Out side of this operating range can be dangerous or could result battery death. For example, if LiPo battery is overheated because of high current drawn, it may be explode or burn. Another example, if battery is <b>overdrained,</b> it may die and never work again. To avoid these situations battery pack must be monitored all time.   In this thesis, battery management system is implemented on power board. Power board has ARM Cortex – M 3 processor powered LPC 1343 micro controller unit. MCU monitors battery voltages, battery temperatures and current that drawn by other parts of robot. Power board always monitors battery state and sends monitored data to mainboard. Power board also controls separated charger. Beacause of limited time, power board only controls connection between charger and battery pack. If input voltage, which comes externally to robot, is sufficient, then power board connects charger to battery. In future, charge operations will be implemented on power board. Another part of control unit is main board. Main board acts as the brain of the robot. Main board reads all sensors’ data, communicates with station, angle and position sensors board, power board and beaglebone, and controls the motors via the motor driver board according to calculations. Main board has ARM Cortex – M 3 processor powered LPC 1769 MCU. This MCU is faster and has more peripheral than power board’s MCU.   Robot platform consists of an aluminium chassis on six wheels. Three wheels on the right and left. Every wheel is driven by one brushed dc motor. Drive method of robot is skid – steering method. Skid – steering is very similar to differential drive. In short, main board separately controls the three motors on the left and the three motors on the right to steer robot. Advantages of skid – steering method is less moving parts means there is no explicit steering mechanism and this method has more traction. Disadvantages are straight – line travel can be difficult to achieve and skidding cause wheels to lose contact with the ground, which means odometry sensors, cannot accurately track the position of the vehicle. In addition, robot platform has suspensions at every wheel and wheels are suitable for field conditions. As described earlier, control unit was designed independently from robot platform. This means control unit can drive any skid-steering vehicle and any type of control algorithm can be implemented on control unit. Main board gathers data from eight distance sensors, two quadrature encoder sensors, angle and position sensors, power board, beaglebone and station via wireless communicaiton board. Also sends data and last state to station. Distance sensors are placed to cover every side of the robot. Distance sensors are used for environment awareness and collision avoidance. These sensors use soundwaves to measure distance. To prevent interference between sensors, all sensors are used in chain algorithm. Quadrature encoders are attached to middle left and middle right motors to implement PID control with using feedback. By using PID control, motors on the left and right side can be driven more accurately.   Angle and positions sensors board consists of three parts. First one is inertial measuring unit (IMU) sensors board. IMU board has three axis gyroscope, three axis accelerometer and three axis magnetometer chips. Position sensor is well – known global positioning system (GPS), which finds longitude and latitude of robots position. Third part is MCU board. On this board there is a ATMEGA 328 P MCU, which can be programmed by Arduino. MCU board gathers data from IMU and uses sensor fusion algorithm to find Euler angles of robot, encodes GPS sensor packets to find position, and sends these gathered and calculated data to main board. There is a many IMU and GPS applications and programs on the internet. In thesis, these programs are adjusted for the IMU and GPS chips. Also some filter algorithm are implemented to get more stable values.   Main board and power board MCU’s are programmed from register level to system level. These MCU’s programmed from low level to use MCU’s at high speed, efficient and gain control of program at any level. For both MCU, peripheral libraries are created or pre-built libraries are reprogrammed.   Last part of the control unit is beaglebone black board. This board is mini computer. This board added to control unit because of image processing tasks. But image processing will be implemented in the future.   Hardware design of robot is performed in three levels. Because, one of the design criteria was modularity and there was too many parts. This levels are body level, control unit level and additional units level. Body level consists of robot chasis, motors, batteries and some sensors. Parts in the body level are stationary and unique to robot platform. Control unit level act as a brain of robot. Control unit level is detechable, so that changes can be made. Additional unitss level was designed application specific. Angle and position sensors board, live video transmitter, charger and cameras for image processing are added to additional units level. Every level connected to each other by power or signal cables.   Now, robot can be controlled manually from station. In manual control operator sends directions to robot from station by using joystick or keyboard. Robot calculates movement according to operator directions and sensor data. First autonomous application of robot will be IMU and GPS controlled movement at open fields. This section is prepared, but not tested.   As a result low-cost and modular robot and control unit was designed and implemented. In the first stage, project goal was design a robot which acts as a development platform. Next stage of the work will be implement control algorithms or methods, such as sliding mode control or fuzzy logic control methods on control unit. Also image processing capabilities will be added to robot. The robot is initially intended to be used to collect data in the fields of agriculture. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|E
5000|$|Inappropriate valve {{pressure}} {{can lead to}} [...] "overdraining" [...] or [...] "underdraining", both of which should be treated by adjusting the valve pressure. <b>Overdraining</b> occurs when the valve pressure is too low and CSF flows out of the third ventricle too quickly. The ventricle then collapses and blood vessles can be torn in the process. This in turn can lead to headache, hemorrhage, or slit ventricle syndrome. Underdraining occurs when the valve pressure is too high and CSF flows out too slowly. This results in symptoms of hydrocephalus as the CSF is still collecting rather than being absorbed or diverted.|$|R
50|$|Usually one of {{two types}} of overdrainage can occur. First when the CSF drains too rapidly, a {{condition}} known as extra-axial fluid collection can occur. In this condition the brain collapses on itself resulting {{in the collection of}} CSF or blood around the brain. This can cause severe brain damage by compressing the brain. Furthermore, a subdural hematoma may develop. Extra-axial fluid collection can be treated in three different ways depending on the severity of the condition. Usually the shunt will be replaced or reprogrammed to release less CSF and the fluid collected around the brain will be drained. The second condition known as slit ventricle syndrome occurs when CSF slowly <b>overdrains,</b> over several years. More information on slit ventricle syndrome appears below.|$|R
40|$|Control of nitrate {{from urban}} {{stormwater}} runoff {{can have a}} significant impact on nitrate levels in local waters. One option for providing treatment to urban stormwater runoff is bioretention, a simple plant- and soil-based low impact treatment/infiltration facility. The goal of this study is to re-engineer the concept of bioretention to remove nitrate from urban runoff. Specifically, a modification to incorporate a continuously submerged anoxic zone with an <b>overdrain</b> is being evaluated for its capacity for nitrate removal via denitrification. Work to date has focused on selecting an electron donor and carbon source that will promote significant denitrification and be stable for extended periods of time in the subsurface. The electron donor and carbon source to be used in bioretention must be readily metabolizable, as well as low cost and readily available. Two sets of organic substrates for chemoorganotrophic denitrifying bacteria were evaluated: Set # 1, alfalfa, newspaper, and leaf mulch compost; and Set # 2, sawdust, wood chips, and wheat straw. An inorganic substrate for chemolithotrophic denitrifying bacteria, sulfur, was evaluated in experimental Set # 3, in three configurations: large sulfur particles (2 to 2. 36 mm) alone, large sulfur particles with limestone, and small sulfur particles (0. 6 to 1. 18 mm) with limestone.

40|$|Introduction & Background: Only 12 {{years ago}} the first report on pachymeningeal {{gadolinium}} enhance-ment in low-pressure headaches appeared in the lit-erature. Intracranial hypotension {{is a result of}} low CSF volume caused by either spontaneous or postoperative leakage. The syndrome has been reported to occur after head trauma, a tear in a spinal nerve root sheath, perineural cyst, or spinal arachnoid diverticulum. Iatrogenic causes include lumbar puncture or <b>overdraining</b> ventricular or spinal shunts. Spontaneous intracranial hypotension is thought to result from rupture of a spinal arachnoid membrane that allows CSF passage into the subdural or epidural space. It is typically not attributable to a major traumatic event or prior diagnostic or therapeutic intervention; however, intracranial hypotension may be associated with a history of minor trauma such as sports activities or severe coughing. Diffuse pachymeningeal enhancement is thought to reflect the Monro-Kellie rule, which describes the inverse relationship of CSF volume and intracranial blood volume within the rigid confines of the skull. This reflex mechanism protects nervous tissue by maintaining a constant buffer (ie, blood or CSF) subjacent to its bony covering. Though this principle was described for intracranial processes and helps to explain the reason for intracranial pachymeningeal enhancement, it can also be applied to the bony spinal canal. Explaining pachymeningeal enhancement in the spine becomes more difficult because the hypervascular outer dural layer covering the brain does not extend to cover the spine, and the single layer of dura that does cover the spine is relatively avascular. Perhaps reports of pachymeningeal enhancement along the spinal canal in intracranial hypotension more accurately reflect prominent epidural venous engorgement. In all cases of intracranial hypotension reported in the literature, patients presented with headaches. These headaches are typically generalized and pulsating, and often resolve with recumbency. Other clinical features may include nausea or emesis, diplopia, neck pain, disturbance in hearing, vertigo, photophobia, and visual deficits. CSF pressures have reportedly been low, normal, or even high. CSF examination may be normal, or may reveal xanthocromia, lymphocytic pleocytosis, or increased protein possibly secondary to dural venous engorgement. With few exceptions, intracranial MR imaging of intracranial hypotension reveals diffuse pachymeningeal enhancement. Subdural fluid collections and brain descent, as measured by inferior displacement of the iter relative to the incisural line, may also be seen. Pachymeningeal enhancement is characteristically thick, smooth, and uninterrupted. The enhancement is thought to result from accumulation of gadolinium-based contrast material in engorged dural veins and in the interstitium of the dura. Mokri et al reported subdural fluid collections that were mostly bilateral and without mass effect in 69 % of patients with intracranial hypotension. The authors also described imaging evidence of brain or brain-stem descent in 62 % of patients in their series. Ventricular size in subjects with intracranial hypotension is usually small (1), but can reverse after treatment of the CSF leakage. In the relatively few reports in the literature of spinal imaging findings of intracranial hypotension, MR images showed extradural fluid collections and pachymeningeal enhancement (1, 4 – 6). MR images may also depict the site of CSF leakage in the spine (1). Herein, we described a case of intracranial hypotension with symmetric bulky epidural enhancement seen along the anterolateral borders of the cervical spine. This enhancement was compatible with engorged epidural venous structures based on their characteristic location in the anterolateral spinal canal and sparing of the midline. Renowden et al (6) described a single case of intracranial hypotension with epidural venous engorgement in the region of the cauda equina, and Rabin et al (4) described another case of intracranial hypotension with prominent flow voids within the ventral epidural space near the midline of the upper thoracic spine adjacent to a ventral extradural fluid collection. Treatment of intracranial hypotension varies, depending on its origin and type. If intracranial hypotension {{is the result of a}} shunt procedure or surgery, then treatment is usually surgical. Spontaneous intracranial hypotension is often treated first with conservative management, and if this is not effective, an epidural blood patch is used. Surgical correction may be required when all other measures have failed, especially if a dural tear or other meningeal defect has been demonstrated. In addition to the correction of meningeal defects, surgical drainage of subdural hematomas, a frequent complication of ICH, also may be necessary...|$|R
