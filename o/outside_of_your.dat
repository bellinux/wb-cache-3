500|$|The Detroit Free Press {{reported}} that the loudest cheers during Michigan State's home victory against UAB came when the scoreboard displayed the final score of the Appalachian State vs. Michigan game; to conclude his postgame press conference, Michigan State defensive coordinator Pat Narduzzi stated: [...] "And Michigan lost, too." [...] The Ohio State locker room erupted into a [...] "roar" [...] after the players learned of Michigan's loss. Conversely, Michigan State running back Javon Ringer expressed disappointment at the game's result, saying [...] "I kinda really wanted [...] to be undefeated for us." [...] Ohio State coach Jim Tressel gave a similar reaction, saying that [...] "I'm never glad when a conference opponent loses <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> game with them...

Appalachian State's campus bookstore received {{a large number of}} phone calls from people wanting to buy gear, many of them from Ohio, but were unable to sell them in large quantities due to a state law prohibiting university bookstores from selling items to people who are not students, faculty, or alumni.|$|E

6000|$|In a {{despatch}} of the 23rd, {{which has}} not been printed, Knappe had told his story: how he had declared war, subjected foreigners to martial law, and been received with a counter-proclamation by the English consul; and how (in an interview with Mataafa chiefs at the plantation house of Motuotua, of which I cannot find the date) he had demanded the cession of arms and of ringleaders for punishment, and proposed to assume the government of the islands. On February 12th he received Bismarck's answer: [...] "You had no right to take foreigners from the jurisdiction of their consuls. The protest of your English colleague is grounded. In disputes which may arise from this cause you will find yourself in the wrong. The demand formulated by you, as to the assumption of the government of Samoa by Germany, lay <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> instructions and of our design. Take it immediately back. If your telegram is here rightly understood, I cannot call your conduct good." [...] It must be a hard heart that does not sympathise with Knappe in the hour when he received this document. Yet it may be said that his troubles were still in the beginning. Men had contended against him, and he had not prevailed; he was now to be at war with the elements, and find his name identified with an immense disaster.|$|E
60|$|My dear Miss Haworth,--I do {{hope you}} have not set us quite on the <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> heart with the unfeeling and ungrateful. I say 'us' when I ought to have said 'me,' for you have known Robert, and you have not known me, and I am {{naturally}} less safe with you than he is--less safe in your esteem. We should both have gone to inquire after your health {{if he had not}} been attacked with influenza, and unfit for anything until the days you mentioned as the probable term of your remaining in town had passed. I waited till he should be better, and the malady lingered. Now he is well, and I do hope you may be so too. May it be! Bear us in mind and love, for we go away to-morrow to Paris--where, however, we shall expect you before long. Thank you, thank you, for the books. I have been struck and charmed with some things in the 'Companion'--especially, may I say, with the 'Modern Pygmalion,' which catches me on my weak side of the love of wonder. By the way, what am I to say of Swedenborg and mesmerism? So much I could--the books have so drawn and held me (as far as I was capable of being drawn or held, in this chaos of London)--that I will not speak at all. The note-page is too small--the haste I write in, too great.|$|E
60|$|Your {{despatch}} of Tuesday morning induces me to {{hope your}} army is having some rest. In this hope {{allow me to}} reason with you a moment. When you ask for 50,000 men to be promptly sent you, you surely labor under some gross mistake of fact. Recently you sent papers showing your disposal of forces made last spring {{for the defense of}} WASHINGTON, and advising a return to that plan. I find it included in and about WASHINGTON 75,000 men. Now, please be assured I have not men enough to fill that very plan by 15,000. All of Fremont's in the valley, all of Banks's, all of McDowell's not with you, and all in WASHINGTON, taken together, do not exceed, if they reach, 60,000. With Wool and Dix added to those mentioned, I have not, <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> army, 75,000 men east of the mountains. Thus the idea of sending you 50,000, or any other considerable force, promptly, is simply absurd. If, in your frequent mention of responsibility, you have the impression that I blame you for not doing more than you can, please be relieved of such impression. I only beg that in like manner you will not ask impossibilities of me. If you think you are not strong enough to take Richmond just now, I do not ask you to try just now. Save the army, material and personal, and I will strengthen it for the offensive again as fast as I can. The governors of eighteen States offer me a new levy of 300,000, which I accept.|$|E
50|$|The {{object of}} the game is to score by {{maneuvering}} the ball into the opposing goal, {{while at the same time}} avoiding the opponent from scoring on you. The player that has the least points by the end of the game, wins. Due to this, the game can be considered a last-man-standing type of match. This means that the first player to reach ten points has lost, while the remaining players keep playing until all but one player has reached ten points. The game does not rely solely on goals and is therefore measured in points. One goal equals one point. In synchronized football however, you get punished for shooting <b>outside</b> the posts <b>of</b> <b>your</b> opponent's goal. Doing so gives you 0.1 point, where 0.3 points is converted into a full point. If your opponent saves your goal attempt 0.1 point is not given. This means that if a player shoots three times <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> an opponents goal it equals 1 point. For example, if during a game your opponents have scored 3 goals on you and you have missed an opponent's goal 7 times during a match, your score would be 5.1. Due to the nature of the game and its scoring system, a draw is impossible in synchronized football.|$|R
