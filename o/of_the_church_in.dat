5|$|Christianity {{arose in}} Cappadocia {{relatively}} late with {{no evidence of}} a Christian community before the late second century AD. Alexander of Jerusalem was the first bishop of the province in the early to mid third century, a period in which Christians suffered persecution from the local Roman authorities. The community remained very small throughout the third century: when Gregory Thaumaturgus acceded to the bishopric in c. 250, according to his namesake, the Nyssen, there were only seventeen members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>in</b> Caesarea.|$|E

5|$|In 1534, Cromwell {{initiated}} a Visitation of the Monasteries ostensibly {{to examine their}} character, but in fact, to value their assets {{with a view to}} expropriation.

Suppression of monasteries to raise funds was not unknown previously. Cromwell had done the same thing on the instructions of Cardinal Wolsey to raise funds for two proposed colleges at Ipswich and Oxford years before.|$|E

5|$|The date of {{foundation}} of the first building on this site is unknown. Geraint Jones, in a 2006 guide to Anglesey churches, wrote that {{it is thought that}} St Cristiolus established a church here in 610. Cristiolus, a 7th-century saint about whom little detail is known, was a follower of St Cadfan, a Breton saint associated with the Christian community on Bardsey Island in Wales. Cristiolus is also credited with the foundation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>in</b> Eglwyswrw in modern-day Pembrokeshire, south Wales. He was the brother of St Rhystud, who established the church at Llanrhystud in mid-Wales.|$|E

Both side aisles are separated from the main aisle by pillar files, consisting of four columns and two half columns. The columns and the roof are painted in white, and the walls in cream. The floor is constructed from light and dark grey marble slabs in a chequered pattern.|$|E
