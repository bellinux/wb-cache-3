50|$|The {{one piece}} {{lubricator}} {{body is a}} gunmetal casting and incorporates the condensing chamber, the oil reservoir and the sight glasses. Passages within the body interconnect these areas. The body is fitted with a steam valve, a water valve, an oil control valve. Sight glasses are fitted at the front & back of the body {{on each of the}} feeds, these feeds are fitted with individual feed regulating valves for controlling the feed rate for each outlet. The oil control valve was used to either turn the supply off/on, or to shut off the supply to the cylinders and just supply the air compressor with oil whilst the locomotive is stationary on lubricators with a center feed. Each feed is also fitted with a drain valve for cleaning each sight glass. The body is also fitted with an <b>oil</b> <b>chamber</b> drain for draining the condensed water from the <b>oil</b> <b>chamber.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In larger steam {{turbines}} an oil operated servo mechanism {{is used in}} order to enhance the lever sensitivity. The use of a relay system magnifies the small deflections of the lever connected to the governor sleeve. The differential lever is connected at both the ends to the governor sleeve and the throttle valve spindle respectively. The pilot valves spindle is also connected to the same lever at some intermediate position. Both the pilot valves cover one port each in the <b>oil</b> <b>chamber.</b> The outlets of the <b>oil</b> <b>chamber</b> are connected to an oil drain tank through pipes.The decrease in load during operation of the turbine will bring about increase in the shaft speed thereby lifting the governor sleeve. Deflection occurs in the lever and due to this the pilot valve spindle raises up opening the upper port for oil entry and lower port for oil exit. Pressurized oil from the oil tank enters the cylinder and pushes the relay piston downwards. As the relay piston moves the throttle valve spindle attached to it also descends and partially closes the valve. Thus the steam flow rates can be controlled. When the load on the turbine increases the deflections in the lever are such that the lower port is opened for oil entry and upper port for oil exit. The relay piston moves upwards and the throttle valve spindle ascend upwards opening the valve.The variation of the steam consumption rate ṁ (kg/h) with the turbine load during throttle governing is linear and is given by the “willan’s line”. The equation for the willan’s line is given by: ...|$|E

30|$|During servo operation, {{the piston}} and piston rod are {{subjected}} to gravity and partial loading from unbalanced radial components. This force can be adjusted within a certain range using the force generated by pressure changes in the <b>oil</b> <b>chambers</b> of {{the upper and lower}} oil pads, which result from changes in the gap between the piston rod and seal oil edge. This ensures that the piston rod, guide sleeve, and cylinder maintain gaps in an appropriate range to facilitate oil film lubrication and reduce friction between the piston rod and guide sleeve, and piston and cylinder. This results in increased system load-bearing capacity and anti-eccentric load capacity, as well as wear-free operation over wide speed and load ranges, which significantly increases the reliability and longevity of horizontal hydraulic cylinders.|$|R

30|$|By {{comparing}} Figures  14 and 15, one can {{see that}} when the piston rod is not subjected to a partial load, the oil is diffused to {{the periphery of the}} <b>oil</b> <b>chamber</b> in an elliptical shape. When the piston rod is subjected to a partial load, the oil is diffused into a square shape and the pressure in the oil return groove is low. Additionally, the pressure around the <b>oil</b> <b>chamber</b> gradually decreases and the pressure cloud map changes from orange to yellow, light green, and light blue in sequence. The pressure drop gradient is large and the pressure drop is significant. This is because the gap between the piston rod and sealing oil edge is reduced when the rod is subjected to a partial load. The oil in the <b>oil</b> <b>chamber</b> experiences increased resistance through the return oil gap and the return oil flow rate decreases. Therefore, the pressure in the return oil groove is lower than that without a partial load. The reduced return oil flow causes the pressure in the <b>oil</b> <b>chamber</b> to rise and the oil film pressure drop between the <b>oil</b> <b>chamber</b> and return oil groove increases.|$|E

In this study, a soil compaction profile sensor equipped with four horizontal operating penetro-meters for on-the-go sensing and mapping of the location and intensity of hard pans arti-ficially formed in a soil bin was developed and tested. The leading edge of a 600 mm long vertical soil cutting blade held four 8 mm diameter, 80 mm long, and 30 degree conic tip stainless steel soil penetrating rods equally spaced at 100 mm vertical intervals. With this arrangement, when the cutting blade was driven into the soil up to a 500 mm depth, the conic tips sensed soil penetration resistances at 100, 200, 300 and 400 mm depths.

30|$|In a servo cylinder, the radial {{component}} of a partial load on the piston rod causes {{the front end of}} the piston rod to deflect downward relative to the center of mass. This breaks the oil seal between the support oil pad and counter oil pad, and changes the piston rod gap, which affects the pressure in the <b>oil</b> <b>chamber</b> of each oil pad. When the radial force increases, based on the centroid location, the gap between the oil seal edges of the piston rod bearing oil cushion and counter oil cushion decreases with increasing deflection of the piston rod. Because the system has a constant-pressure oil supply, under the joint action of hole damping and oil edge sealing, the <b>oil</b> <b>chamber</b> experiences a pressing force. This causes the oil pressure in the upper and lower oil pads of the piston rod to increase, resulting in a larger reaction force. This increased force counteracts the radial force of the eccentric load to balance the partial load. As the movement of the piston rod changes during operation, the radial force generated by the eccentric load also changes dynamically. The gap between the piston rod and oil seal changes correspondingly under the effects of fluid-solid coupling. The pressure in the oil chambers in the upper and lower oil pads then makes the necessary adjustments so the piston rod can be adaptively aligned in the guide sleeve.|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} an {{increase}} in ship traffic in Arctic waters the later years, this challenges today's ship design. One of the challenges is the contact loads that occur, due to ice blocks encountering the ship propeller. The ice propeller interaction is a complicated process, and more knowledge on the effect of the ice propeller interaction on the ship propulsion drive train is needed. This master thesis focus on improving the dynamic mathematical model of one of the ship propulsion drive train components, namely the flexible coupling. The model developed is based on the Geislinger flexible coupling, and is developed using the bond graph approach with the 20 -sim simulation software. It takes in to account the major dynamic effects of the radially aligned springs and the oil flow between the oil chambers. Simulations show that the dynamic stiffness and damping coefficient of the flexible coupling model developed in this project, is heavily dependent on the deflection frequency and velocity. Both the damping factor and stiffness increases with frequency. This is due to an increase in both the amount of oil that is compressed, and the pressure difference between the oil chambers increases, with increasing deflection velocity. Simulations show that the static stiffness is mainly dependent on the geometry of the radially aligned springs, and that the dynamic stiffness is heavily dependent on the coefficient of discharge describing the oil flow between the oil chambers of the coupling. The coupling model was implemented in to a marine propulsion drive train established in another project, which was subjected to torsional ice impact loads, and compared to the original model. Simulations did show that the oil compressibility caused the flexible coupling to become stiffer than the reference model, during the rapid change of <b>oil</b> <b>chamber</b> volume. While the <b>oil</b> <b>chamber</b> volume change was less, the flexible coupling became less stiff than the reference model. It is recommended that the tapering of the radially aligned springs is included in the model as this affects the flexible coupling stiffness, especially during impact loads. Also it is recommended that CFD simulations are performed to verify the coefficient of discharge used in the model. </p...|$|E
