5000|$|However, {{most modern}} devices will report write {{operations}} as complete once {{the data is}} stored in its <b>onboard</b> <b>cache</b> memory, before the data is written to the (slow) magnetic storage. This allows commands {{to be sent to}} the other device on the cable, reducing the impact of the [...] "one operation at a time" [...] limit.|$|E
50|$|During this initialization, writable memory {{may not be}} available, so all {{computations}} have to {{be performed}} within the processor registers. For this reason, first stage boot loaders tend to be written in assembler language and only do the minimum to provide a normal execution environment for the next program. Some processors either embed a small amount of SRAM in the chip itself, or allow using the <b>onboard</b> <b>cache</b> memory as RAM, to make this first stage boot loader easier to write using high-level language.|$|E
50|$|Tightly coupled {{multiprocessor}} systems contain multiple CPUs {{that are}} connected {{at the bus}} level. These CPUs may {{have access to a}} central shared memory (SMP or UMA), or may participate in a memory hierarchy with both local and shared memory (SM)(NUMA). The IBM p690 Regatta {{is an example of a}} high end SMP system. Intel Xeon processors dominated the multiprocessor market for business PCs and were the only major x86 option until the release of AMD's Opteron range of processors in 2004. Both ranges of processors had their own <b>onboard</b> <b>cache</b> but provided access to shared memory; the Xeon processors via a common pipe and the Opteron processors via independent pathways to the system RAM.|$|E
50|$|The POWER5 {{processors}} {{built on}} the popular POWER4 and incorporated simultaneous multithreading into the design, a technology pioneered in the PowerPC AS based RS64-III processor, and on-die memory controllers. It was designed for multiprocessing {{on a massive scale}} and came in multi-chip modules with <b>onboard</b> large L3 <b>cache</b> chips.|$|R
50|$|The 486SLC can be {{described}} as a 386SX with the 486 instruction set and 1K of <b>onboard</b> L1 <b>cache</b> added. Unfortunately it inherited the 386SX's 24-bit address bus (16mb max. DRAM), and 16-bit datapath which limited its memory bandwidth. Like the 386 and 486SX, it had no on-board math coprocessor, but unlike the 486SX, it could make use of an Intel 287, 387SX or compatible coprocessor. Due to the limitations of the 386SX's bus and its smaller L1 cache, its performance could not compete with the 486SX when the latter was running on a full 32-bit bus. The 486SLC was primarily used in very inexpensive low-end motherboards and PC clones. Because of its low power consumption, it also saw use in laptops. The 486SLC was also available as a 32-bit version based on the i386DX bus, see 486DLC.|$|R

50|$|The PowerBook 500 {{series was}} {{released}} as Apple was already moving its desktop machines to the PowerPC processor range, and a future upgrade was promised from the start. This came in 1995, as an Apple Motherboard containing a 100 MHz 603e processor and 8 MB of RAM (which snapped {{into a slot}} containing the previous 25 or 33 MHz 68040 processor and the 4 MB of RAM on the previous daughterboard). At the same time Newer Technology offered an Apple-authorized 117 MHz Motherboard, which was more popular than the Apple product, and optionally came without any RAM. The company later offered 167 MHz and 183 MHz upgrades containing more memory and <b>onboard</b> <b>cache</b> memory to improve performance. However, the internal architecture of the 500 series meant that the speed increase provided by the 100 and 117 MHz upgrades was, for most users, relatively small.|$|E
