50|$|Meanwhile, John Quincy Archibald and {{his wife}} Denise witness their young son Michael {{collapse}} at his baseball game and take Michael to the hospital. After {{a series of tests}} at the hospital, John is informed by Dr. Raymond Turner and Rebecca Payne, the hospital administrator, that his son has an enlarged heart and that he will die without a heart transplant. The procedure is very expensive: $250,000 (at a minimum), with a down payment of $75,000 (30%) required to get Michael's name on the <b>organ</b> <b>recipient</b> list. John tells them he is insured, but after looking through his policy, they tell him that because the company he works for dropped John from full-time to part-time, his health insurance has been changed, and the new policy does not cover the surgery, which leaves John and Denise to raise $75,000 on their own.

He then learns that the first two victims had McCaleb's blood types and were on a list of people who had previously donated blood. If the victims died, McCaleb would benefit from their death as a potential <b>organ</b> <b>recipient.</b> Because of this, the police on Gloria's case focus on him as the possible killer and get a search warrant for his boat.

40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{generally}} pathologized relationship between organ recipients {{and the families}} of deceased donors.

40|$|We have {{postulated}} that the donor leukocyte microchimerism plays a seminal {{role in the}} acceptance of allografts by inducing and perpetuating variable degree of donor-specific nonreactivity in long-surviving <b>organ</b> <b>recipients.</b> Limited information is available, however, concerning the phenotype and function of these chimeric cells in humans. The unequivocal presence of donor dendritic cells (DCs), a prominent lineage in the microchimerism observed in rodents and clinical <b>organ</b> <b>recipients,</b> was difficult to demonstrate in bone marrow (BM) -augmented <b>organ</b> transplant <b>recipients.</b> This enigma was resolved by the recent description of a method for propagating circulating human DCs from their progenitors by culture in a medium enriched with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin 4, a condition known to inhibit outgrowth of monocytes, thus providing a selective growth advantage to committed progenitors of the myeloid lineage. Cells from BM-augmented <b>organ</b> <b>recipients</b> and normal control subjects harvested from 12 - to 14 -day cultures exhibited dendritic morphology and potent allostimulatory capacity. Using appropriate primers, the presence of donor DNA was verified by polymerase chain reaction within the lineage(null) /class II(bright) sorted DC. Phenotypic analysis of cultured DCs from BM-augmented patients, unlike that of controls, exhibited a marked down- regulation of B 7 - 1 (CD 80) while retaining normal levels of expression of B 7 - 2 (CD 86) cell surface molecules. The presence of donor DNA was also confirmed by polymerase chain reaction in individually sorted lineage + (T, B, and NK) cells and macrophages, suggesting that the chimerism in BM-augmented patients is multilineage.

40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{determine}} whether the different types of liver organ allocation for transplant, namely rescue versus regular, had any determinable influence, first upon differences in organ quality, and second, upon the early postoperative mortality and morbidity of the <b>organ</b> <b>recipient.</b> Within this framework were examined after the fact and completion of the proceedures 87 liver transplantations performed at University Hospital RWTH Aachen. Patients were classified into two groups based on the allocation type of liver they received. Then then two groups were analyzed for difference in quality of organ received and for differences in recipient postoperative mortality and morbidity. The extent to which rescue organs {{have a negative effect on}} the postoperative function, transplant, and recipient survival was investigated. Whether rescue organs might be an appropriate instrument for extending the number of organs available is considered. Analyses of the <b>organ</b> <b>recipient</b> data revealed no difference between rescue and regular organs either with respect to 1 -year patient and transplant survival or with respect to number of retransplantations and revisions that were performed. Recipients evidently benefited from a rescue organ or a standard organ. Recipients of rescue organs even experienced a significantly shorter intensive care therapy and hospital stay. In addition it could be shown that rescue organs and standard organs did not generally differ in organ quality. Considering the current state of research, there is no reason to think that the function of rescue organs is always limited. Identification of risk factors and avoidance of risk combinations is more important for the postoperative outcome than the type of organ allocation which has a low information value about organ quality. Thus rescue organs could be used to extend the number of available organs...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Transplantation Surgery has {{undergone}} a great development during {{the last thirty years}} and the survival of solid <b>organ</b> <b>recipients</b> has increased dramatically. Osteo-articular diseases such as osteoporosis, fractures, avascular bone necrosis and osteoarthritis are relatively common in these patients and joint arthroplasty may be required. The outcome of hip arthroplasty in patients with osteonecrosis of the femoral head after renal transplantation has been studied and documented by many researchers. However, the results of joint arthroplasties other than the hip in solid <b>organs</b> <b>recipients</b> were only infrequently reported in the literature. A systematic review of the English literature was conducted in order to investigate the outcome of joint arthroplasties other than the hip in kidney, liver or heart transplant recipients. Nine pertinent articles including 51 knee arthroplasties, 8 shoulder arthroplasties and 1 ankle arthroplasty were found. These articles reported well to excellent results with a complication rate and spectrum comparable with those reported in nontransplant patients...|$|R

Our objective was to estimate the period prevalence of untreated skin malignancy and actinic keratoses in high-risk kidney and liver transplant recipients and to assess associated factors. <b>Organ</b> transplant <b>recipients</b> underwent full skin examinations by dermatologically trained physicians. The proportion of examined <b>organ</b> transplant <b>recipients</b> with histopathologically confirmed skin cancer in the 3 -month baseline period was estimated. Prevalence ratios with 95 % confidence intervals indicated significant associations. Of 495 high-risk <b>organ</b> transplant <b>recipients</b> (average age ¼ 54 years, time immunosuppressed ¼ 8. 9 years), 135 (27 %) had basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma or Bowen’s disease (intraepidermal carcinoma) present and confirmed in the baseline period, with respective prevalence proportions of 10 %, 11 %, and 18 % in kidney transplant recipients and 10 %, 9 %, and 13 % in liver transplant recipients.
