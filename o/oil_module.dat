40|$|Droplet {{microfluidic}} {{techniques can}} perform {{large numbers of}} single molecule and cell reactions but often require controlled, periodic flow to merge, split, and sort droplets. Here, we describe a simple method to convert aperiodic flows into periodic ones. Using an <b>oil</b> extraction <b>module,</b> we efficiently remove oil from emulsions to readjust the droplet volume fraction, velocity, and packing, producing periodic flows. The extractor acts as a universal adaptor to connect microfluidic modules that do not operate under identical flow conditions, such as droplet generators, incubators, and merger devices...|$|R

This contribution presents the <b>oil</b> spill simulation <b>module</b> of B:RUN. This simple module, based largely on wind and sea surface current vector parameters, may be helpful in formulating relevant oil spill contingency plans.

40|$|The {{surface tension}} driven {{convection}} experiment- 2 (STDCE- 2) was conducted onboard the U. S. Microgravity Laboratory (USML) - 2 Spacelab which was launched on October 20, 1995. The main {{objectives of the}} experiment was to study oscillatory thermocapillary flows in microgravity. Thermocapillary flows were generated in cylindrical test chambers filled with 2 centistokes silicone <b>oil.</b> Six <b>modules</b> were used to study three different chamber diameters and two different heating modes. Tests with both flat and curved free surfaces were conducted. The flow field was studied by flow visualization and an infrared imaging system recorded the oil free-surface temperature. An optical (Ronchi) system {{was used to measure}} the oil free-surface deformation and motions. A total of 55 tests were conducted and oscillations were found in most of them. The data are being analyzed...|$|R
50|$|The balance shafts are {{relocated}} {{from the}} cylinder block to <b>oil</b> pan <b>module.</b> The two-piece steel-aluminum oil pan features in-pan integrated oil-pump assembly {{driven by the}} balance shaft with a shorter inverted-tooth chain. Other improvements include inverted-tooth chain driving the camshaft, forged steel crankshaft, cast aluminum bedplate with main bearing cap inserts made of iron, high-pressure fuel rail with rubber-isolated assembly, acoustically shielded plastic cover for the intake manifold, and structurally enhanced aluminum camshaft cover and front cover. These improvements helped reduce noise intensity by 40% compared to the 2.4 L engine and change the noise signature into a higher frequency above 2,000 Hz. The engine also uses a variable-displacement oil pump and an actively controlled thermostat. Direct injection reduces emissions by 25%, while continuous cam phasing {{eliminates the need for}} an EGR system. Maximum engine speed is listed at 7000 RPM.|$|R
3000|$|For every {{sample in}} Table  1, an EOS model {{that matches the}} {{experimental}} results of all available PVT laboratory experiments (CCE, DL, CVD, and separator tests) was derived. For consistency, all EOS models were developed using Peng and Robinson (1976) EOS with volume shift correction (three-parameter EOS) (Fattah 2005). The procedure suggested by Coats and Smart (1986) to match the laboratory results was followed. Then the developed EOS model for each sample was used to obtain MBO PVT properties at different separator conditions using Whitson and Torp (1983) procedure. The MBO PVT properties include the four functions required for MBO simulation are (Rv, Rs, Bo, and Bg). Our database of R v [...] data consists of 1850 points from eight different gas condensate samples and 1180 points from five volatile <b>oil</b> samples. PVTi <b>module</b> of Eclipse was used to generate our database of Rv data.|$|R
40|$|Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is {{considered}} as {{a useful tool for}} sea surface monitoring, thanks to its capability to acquire images day and night and in all weather conditions. In particular, SAR is extensively used to detect oil slicks on the sea surface. Since the early 90 s SAR acquisitions were routinely available with C-band sensors (such as ERS- 1 and 2, Envisat, Radarsat 1 and 2). More recently, also L-band (ALOS PALSAR 1 and 2) and X-band (Terrasar X, COSMO/SkyMed constellation) sensors became operational. In this framework we developed a new software called SEASAFE (Slick Emissions And Ship Automatic Features Extraction), able to process SAR data in C- L- and X-bands. Moving from previous experience, new features have been added such as an enhanced land masking algorithm and <b>oil</b> spill characterization. <b>Modules</b> for ship detection and wind and wave evaluation are also available. The new improved system is here described; detection capabilities are evaluated, overall performances are described...|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of this}} LDRD {{involves}} {{development of}} a system dynamics model to understand the interdependencies between water resource availability and water needs for production of biofuels. Specifically, this model focuses on availability and feasibility of non-traditional water sources from dairy wastewater, produced water from crude oil production and from coal-bed methane gas extraction {{for the production of}} algal-based biofuel. The conceptual simulation framework and historical data are based on two locales within New Mexico, the San Juan basin in the northwest and the Permian basin in the southeast, where oil and gas drilling have increased considerably in the last ten years. The overall water balance ignores both transportation options and water chemistry and is broken down by county level. The resulting model contains an algal growth module, a dairy <b>module,</b> an <b>oil</b> production <b>module,</b> and a gas production module. A user interface is also created for controlling the adjustable parameters in the model. Our preliminary investigation indicates a cyclical demand for non-fresh water due to the cyclical nature of algal biomass production and crop evapotranspiration. The wastewater from the dairy industry is not a feasible non-fresh water source because the agricultural water demand for cow's dry feed far exceeds the amount generated at the dairy. The uncertainty associated with the water demand for cow's dry matter intake is the greatest in this model. The oil- and gas-produced water, ignoring the quality, provides ample supply for water demand in algal biomass production. There remains work to address technical challenges associated with coupling the appropriate non-fresh water source to the local demand...|$|R
40|$|Sub sea {{compression}} {{for maintaining}} reservoir pressure in a gas field {{is important to}} have a steady production of gas as it is extracted from the field. Electrical drives in the several megawatt range are suitable to control the compressor motor since it is not desirable to have gears which need maintenance. Problems related to the location on the sea bed have so far been overcome by using massive pressure tanks which hold 1 atmosphere. A new approach would be to allow the pressure on the sea bed to be applied on the electrical components. This will reduce and simplify the system only needing a thin walled casing filled with oil to contain the electronics, but the electronic components then need to be compatible with the oil and function at high hydrostatic pressure. This report include suitable electrical power systems for a compression application, theory around the most likely to be used switch, some available modules and an experimental set up for testing IGBT compatibility with oil. Converters consisting of rectifiers and inverters are widely used in industrial motor drives and it is assumed that such a converter will be used consisting of a diode bridge rectifier and a neutral point clamped inverter. High voltage applications often operate with voltages above the rated value of many semiconductor components which means that switches must be series connected. A neutral point clamped inverter with series connected switches will be able to handle the high voltages and produce a good spectral output to the motor terminals. The switches used in the inverter will probably be IGBTs. The IGBT evolved as the most successful device for high power, high switching frequency applications blending MOSFET switching capabilities with BJT on-state conduction properties. Development has produced a lot of versions of this kind of switch, and by modifying doping profiles and geometrical properties a set of devices with improved characteristics has been made. Packaging techniques make it possible to integrate the switches in different environments. Examples are the press pack modules which can be hermetically sealed and the standard DBC solutions. To test compatibility with insulating oil, an experiment was set up. An IGBT inverter leg module was placed inside a tank which was filled with <b>oil.</b> The <b>module</b> was operated in an H-bridge configuration with another bridge leg {{on the outside of the}} tank. Thorough testing before submerging it was performed to ensure and document normal behaviour. When fully submerged the module was tested and the results compared with those from the initial testing. Short duration of continuous switching was also performed followed by intermittent operation with current pulses and long term continuous switching. None of the captured scope pictures or temperature measurements showed deviation from normal IGBT behaviour or change of characteristics. It can then be concluded that when submerging an IGBT <b>module</b> in insulating <b>oil,</b> no instant failure or change of electrical behaviour occurs. </p...|$|R
