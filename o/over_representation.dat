Raw data is examined for: high quality scores for base calls, GC content matches the expected distribution, the <b>over</b> <b>representation</b> of particular short sequence motifs (k-mers), and an unexpectedly high read duplication rate. Several software options exist for sequence quality analysis, including FastQC and FaQCs. Abnormalities identified may be removed by trimming, or tagged for special treatment during later processes.|$|E

The film's first theatrical release occurred in France on July 7, 1982. In the United Kingdom, {{it was part of}} the 37th Edinburgh International Film Festival and the 27th London Film Festival in 1983, and was released late that year by United International Pictures. It received positive reviews in both countries. Lisa Dombrowski of Film Comment notes, [...] "In the end, Sam Fuller's White Dog was muzzled by a collision of historically specific economic and political interests, as support for freedom of expression took a back seat to Paramount's bottom line and the NAACP's ongoing battles with Hollywood <b>over</b> <b>representation</b> and employment.

2500|$|Upon {{his return}} to Moscow, Sadoul became {{directly}} implicated {{in the effort to}} establish the Communist International (Comintern, or [...] "Third International"). Welcoming the Asian delegates at a public rally on December 5, he voiced his hope for a socialist revolution in France, and suggested that the Communist Group take <b>over</b> <b>representation</b> of French interests in Moscow. He was then dispatched, together with others, to assist the German revolutionary soviets, setting up Bolshevik [...] "academies" [...] in Berlin, Hamburg and Bremen. In March 1919, Sadoul was a co-founder of the Comintern, representing a still-to-be-born French Communist Party (PCF) at the International's first-ever meeting, and forfeiting his SFIO mandate. In his speech there, he attacked the reformist leaders of French socialism, including Longuet, Alphonse Merrheim and Léon Jouhaux. Overall, his activity was minimal, as he could speak neither Russian nor German (the two working languages of the Comintern).|$|E

40|$|Investigations into visual {{attention}} {{have led}} to the identification of locationand object-based mechanisms of attentional selection. This thesis is specifically concerned with object-based attention and aims to distinguish between two different hypotheses regarding the representations available to the inhibitory mechanisms of object-based selection. According to the global structure hypothesis, inhibitory mechanisms of selection operate <b>over</b> <b>representations</b> that {{do not have access to}} object-internal structural properties, such as surface boundaries. According to the local structure hypothesis, inhibitory selection mechanisms operate <b>over</b> <b>representations</b> that do make explicit object-internal structure. The second issue addressed in this thesis concerns the nature of object-shape representations that object-based inhibitory mechanisms operate over. Two candidate shape primitives, surfaces and volumetric components, are examined in order to ascertain whether they modulate object-based attention. These issues are addressed using the inhibition of return (IOR) paradigm (Posner & Cohen, 1984), which has previously been used to examine object-based attention (e. g. Tipper, Driver & Weaver, 199 1). The two aforementioned hypotheses make contrasting predictions about the modulation of object-based IOR by objectinternal structure. The global structure hypothesis predicts that object-based IOR should not be modulated by the object's internal structural properties, irrespective of changes in the object's internal structure. In contrast, the local structure hypothesis predicts that object internal structure will modulate the magnitude of object-based IOR. 2 The results raise a number of interesting issues. First, they show that objectbased IOR is modulated by internal discontinuities in object structure. Second, objectbased IOR operates <b>over</b> <b>representations</b> that make explicit surface properties of volumetric forms. Third, the effect is attenuated when cues and targets appear on the same surface of an object, relative to when the cue and target are separated by an internal structural discontinuity. These findings are consistent with the local structure hypothesis for objectbased attentional selection and provide new evidence (a) to suggest that inhibitory mechanisms of selection can operate <b>over</b> shape <b>representations</b> that make explicit infonnation about object internal structure, (b) about the surface-based nature of these mental representations, (c) to posit new constraints on hypotheses about the distribution of facilitation and inhibition in object-based attention...|$|R

Accurate translations of such code should be conservative, choosing safe <b>representations</b> <b>over</b> <b>representations</b> convenient to reason about. This paper bridges the gap between conservative representation and convenient reasoning.

The aim is to generate a verified, human-readable specification, convenient for further reasoning. ...|$|R
