5|$|AirSpace officially {{opened to}} the public on 12 July 2008. Over 30 {{aircraft}} are <b>on</b> <b>display,</b> dating back to the First World War; early aircraft include rare examples of an Airco DH.9 and a Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8. The former is one of only six surviving DH9s and the only example <b>on</b> <b>display</b> in the UK, and the latter is the only complete and original R.E.8 in existence. More recent notable aircraft include a Hawker Siddeley Harrier which served during the Falklands War with No. 1 Squadron RAF, and a Panavia Tornado, which flew the highest number of bomber sorties of any Tornado in the 1991 Gulf War. Also <b>on</b> <b>display</b> is a British Aircraft Corporation TSR-2 strike aircraft, one of only two survivors from the cancellation of the project in 1965. Recent additions include Eurofighter Typhoon DA4, one of seven Typhoon development aircraft, which was donated to the museum by the Ministry of Defence in 2008 and went <b>on</b> <b>display</b> in June 2009. Civil aircraft include the Duxford Aviation Society's Concorde and Comet described above.|$|E

40|$|Perceptual {{resolution}} and crosstalk of active and passive stereoscopic 3 D displays are evaluated by subjective tests. Test patterns of gratings with various contrast and spatial frequencies {{are used to}} determine the contrast thresholds, from which the contrast sensitivity of human visual systems is obtained. Perceptual resolution tests show that viewers can perceive the highest vertical frequency <b>on</b> active <b>displays,</b> but not <b>on</b> passive <b>displays.</b> However, the contrast sensitivity is higher for passive displays than active displays for all other frequencies. Viewers can perceive frequency components with lower contrast, except for the highest frequency, more easily <b>on</b> passive <b>displays</b> than <b>on</b> active <b>displays.</b> Perceptual crosstalk tests show that interocular crosstalk is a function of spatial frequency. Crosstalk is lower <b>on</b> passive <b>displays</b> than <b>on</b> active <b>displays.</b> close...|$|R

40|$|The {{reproduction}} of gloss <b>on</b> <b>displays</b> {{is generally not}} based on perception {{and as a consequence}} does not guarantee the best visualization of a real material. The reproduction is composed of four different steps: measurement, modeling, rendering, and display. The minimum number of measurements required to approximate a real material is unknown. The error metrics used to approximate measurements with analytical BRDF models are not based on perception, and the best visual approximation is not always obtained. Finally, the gloss perception difference between real objects and objects seen <b>on</b> <b>displays</b> has not sufficiently been studied and might be influencing the observer judgement. This thesis proposes a systematic, scalable, and perceptually based workflow to represent real materials <b>on</b> <b>displays.</b> First, the gloss perception difference between real objects and objects seen <b>on</b> <b>displays</b> was studied. Second, the perceptual performance of the error metrics currently in use was evaluated. Third, a projection into a perceptual gloss space was defined, enabling the computation of a perceptual gloss distance measure. Fourth, the uniformity of the gloss space was improved by defining a new gloss difference equation. Finally, a systematic, scalable, and perceptually based workflow was defined using cost-effective instruments...|$|R
