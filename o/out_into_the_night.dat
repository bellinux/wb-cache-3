25|$|Establishing {{camp in the}} bush, the two are {{separated}} when the warden goes <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> for firewood and Cuff, hearing what he takes for a native woman's scream from another direction, heads off to investigate. He finds the woman, treed by a buffalo, and rescues her, only to realize he has now lost his way and cannot relocate the camp. The woman, Ingwamza, undertakes to lead him back to her village. When daylight comes and Cuff can finally see her clearly, he discovers Ingwamza too is a mutation; despite her generally human proportions, she has greenish-yellow hair, a short tail, {{and the head of}} a baboon. Startled, he accidentally shoots himself in the foot.|$|E
25|$|King Marke leads {{a hunting}} party <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>night,</b> leaving Isolde and Brangäne {{alone in the}} castle, who both stand beside a burning brazier. Isolde, {{listening}} to the hunting horns, believes several times that the hunting party is far enough away to warrant the extinguishing of the brazier – the prearranged signal for Tristan to join her ("Nicht Hörnerschall tönt so hold"). Brangäne warns Isolde that Melot, one of King Marke's knights, has seen the amorous looks exchanged between Tristan and Isolde and suspects their passion ("Ein Einz'ger war's, ich achtet' es wohl"). Isolde, however, believes Melot to be Tristan's most loyal friend, and, {{in a frenzy of}} desire, extinguishes the flames. Brangäne retires to the ramparts to keep watch as Tristan arrives.|$|E
500|$|As {{his health}} {{continues}} to degrade, Hasan approaches a local journalist with a manuscript that details his life; the journalist agrees {{to publish it}} should something happen to Hasan. Not long afterwards, Hasan goes <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> after curfew and is shot in the chest by Japanese patrols, dying after torture at the station with the Islamic creed [...] "Allahu Akbar" [...] on his lips. Later, Rusli and a tearful Kartini claim his body.|$|E
60|$|Then {{he started}} up, {{and just as}} he was, ran <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> raving <b>night.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, perhaps," [...] he replied, in {{unabated}} perplexity. He bade them serve God, and {{let them}} <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> snowy <b>night,</b> through which they {{drove back to the}} hotel.|$|R
60|$|No sooner {{said than}} done. They hurried off <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> dark <b>night,</b> <b>the</b> princess leading, {{because she knew}} the way, having spied it out while she flew about as a dove.|$|R
500|$|In 1967, {{the episode}} was {{received}} positively {{by members of}} the voice cast and their families, who had attended a preview screening at Century 21 Studios. Francis Matthews, who provided the voice of Captain Scarlet, recalls that [...] "the moment we heard, 'This is the voice of the Mysterons,' my eldest son ran screaming from the room, but my other son just sat there riveted," [...] and adds, [...] "Reg [...] said, 'Oh my God, what have we done? We've made a series that no children are going to watch!'" [...] The episode was given a cinematic presentation at the Columbia Theatre on London's Shaftesbury Avenue, which Gary Files, a voice actor for later Captain Scarlet episodes, warmly remembers: [...] "I looked at [...] with total and utter amazement... Boy, you should have seen it on the wide screen! They had laid in an incredible soundtrack to go with it... We all tottered <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>night,</b> convinced that we were on to a winner." [...] In his DVD commentary, Gerry Anderson praised Saunders' direction.|$|E
2500|$|Hunt met Marc Bolan in 1969 {{when she}} went to the studio where Bolan's group was {{recording}} [...] "Unicorn". Tony Visconti said that when Bolan and Hunt met, [...] "ou could see the shafts of light pouring out of their eyes into each other.... We finished the session unusually early, and Marc and Marsha walked <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> hand in hand." [...] According to Hunt, {{the relationship between the two}} was based on more than physical attraction, though she also recalled that her commercial visibility put her in opposition to Bolan's philosophy that [...] "the serious art of music...was validated by obscurity." ...|$|E
60|$|The girl, who {{had been}} looking <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>night,</b> came back.|$|E
60|$|The King {{came out}} from his dancing with {{the air of a}} man of {{business}} legitimately tired. He put on an overcoat, lit a cigar, and went <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> purple <b>night.</b>|$|R
60|$|The priest came, heavy-eyed and ruffled. He made David Mignot and Lucie de Verennes man and wife, {{pocketed}} a gold {{piece that}} the marquis tossed him, and shuffled <b>out</b> again <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>night.</b>|$|R
60|$|As he went <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{rigorous}} <b>night,</b> I saw <b>the</b> lonely figure flit {{away before}} us. I turned him hastily on some pretence, {{and held him}} in conversation until it was gone.|$|R

60|$|Brook was sharp, cool, {{and decisive}} in his manner. Seizing his wife round the waist, he hurried her <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> dark <b>night,</b> stepping, {{as he did}} so, above the ankles in rising water.|$|R
6000|$|... "That feels good," [...] he murmured. [...] "You're so cool, Saxon. Your hand, and you, all of you. Bein' {{with you}} is like comin' <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> cool <b>night</b> after dancin' in a hot room." ...|$|R
6000|$|Seaforth stared <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{glittering}} <b>night,</b> and groaned, for he {{knew what}} happened to wounded men unsheltered from the frost. His voice was low and harsh as he asked, [...] "Then {{what is to be}} done?" ...|$|R
60|$|Then we went <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> {{and walked}} {{all the way}} to Dumfries in silence.|$|E

60|$|With {{a fierce}} action of her hand, {{as if she}} {{sprinkled}} hatred on the ground, and with it devoted those who were standing there to destruction, she looked up once at the black sky, and strode <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> wild <b>night.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Never shall I {{get down}} the vile inventory! How, if with paper and with pencil I went <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> starry <b>night</b> to inventorize <b>the</b> heavens? Who shall tell stars as teaspoons? Who shall {{put down the}} charms of Lucy Tartan upon paper? ...|$|R
60|$|Gilda Beresteyn, {{glad to be}} alone, {{threw open}} the {{casement}} {{of the window and}} peered <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>night.</b>|$|E
60|$|HECTOR [advancing to Lady Utterword's left hand]. Let us all go <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> {{and leave}} {{everything}} behind us.|$|E
60|$|Then, {{breaking}} that trance, Mr. Stone's {{voice rose}} again, trembling <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>night,</b> as though blown through a reed.|$|E
60|$|In her usual, light-hearted, {{frivolous}} way {{she blew}} a kiss to Andor. But the young man, without looking again on her, had already opened the door, {{and the next}} moment he had gone <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> dark <b>night</b> on his errand of friendship.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Walters looked {{round the}} warm and {{comfortable}} kitchen, {{and his face}} fell.

60|$|He did not reply. Perhaps he was {{listening}} to a confused sound of voices rapidly approaching the cottage.

6000|$|She had {{snatched}} {{it from his}} fingers and was running swiftly from <b>the</b> cottage <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> tempestuous <b>night.</b> He followed closely, until she reached {{the edge of the}} rocks.
