5|$|Numerous climatological factors {{influence}} the formation <b>of</b> <b>hurricanes</b> in the Pacific basins. The North Pacific High and Aleutian Low, usually present between January and April, cause strong wind shear and unfavorable {{conditions for the}} development <b>of</b> <b>hurricanes.</b> During its presence, El Niño results in increased numbers of powerful hurricanes through weaker wind shear, while La Niña reduces {{the number of such}} hurricanes through the opposite. Global warming may also {{influence the}} formation of tropical cyclones in the Pacific basin. During a thirty-year period with two sub-periods, the first between 1975 and 1989 and the second between 1990 and 2004, an increase of thirteenCategory4 or 5 storms was observed from the first sub-period.|$|E

5|$|Within the tropics, 36hours {{prior to}} the center passage of a {{tropical}} cyclone, a veil of white cirrus clouds approaches {{from the direction of}} the cyclone. In the mid to late 19th century, forecasters used these cirrus veils to predict the arrival <b>of</b> <b>hurricanes.</b> In the early 1870s the president of Belén College in Havana, Cuba, Father Benito Viñes, developed the first hurricane forecasting system, and he mainly used the motion of these clouds in formulating his predictions. He would observe the clouds hourly from 4:00 am to 10:00 pm. After accumulating enough information, Viñes began accurately predicting the paths <b>of</b> <b>hurricanes,</b> and he eventually summarized his observations in his book, Apuntes Relativos a los Huracanes de las Antilles.|$|E

5|$|A natural form {{of large}} scale {{environmental}} shading/dimming {{has been identified}} that affected the 2006 northern hemisphere hurricane season. The NASA study found that several major dust storms in June and July in the Sahara desert sent dust drifting over the Atlantic Ocean and through several effects caused cooling of the waters, thus dampening the development <b>of</b> <b>hurricanes.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hurricanes {{that affect}} California are mainly the {{remnants}} <b>of</b> <b>hurricanes</b> or tropical storms. In the twentieth century, only four eastern Pacific tropical cyclones have brought tropical storm-force winds to the Continental United States: the 1939 Long Beach Tropical Storm, Tropical Storm Joanne in 1972, Tropical Storm Kathleen in 1976, and Tropical Storm Nora in 1997.|$|E

500|$|Since 1850, {{only seven}} [...] {{tropical}} cyclones have brought gale-force winds to the Southwestern United States.

The combined effects of ship destruction and remote landfall severely limit the number of intense hurricanes in the official record before the era of hurricane reconnaissance aircraft and satellite meteorology. Although the record shows a distinct increase in the number and strength of intense hurricanes, therefore, experts regard the early data as suspect. Christopher Landsea et al. estimated an undercount bias of zero to six tropical cyclones per year between 1851 and 1885 and zero to four per year between 1886 and 1910. These undercounts roughly take into account the typical size of tropical cyclones, the density of shipping tracks over the Atlantic basin, and the amount of populated coastline.|$|E
5|$|The 2013 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season was a below-average season, featuring the fewest number <b>of</b> <b>hurricanes</b> since 1982. Although Tropical Storm Andrea formed on June5, the season officially began on June1 and ended on November30, dates that conventionally delimit {{the period of}} each year when most tropical cyclones develop in the Atlantic basin. The season's final storm, an unnamed subtropical storm, dissipated on December7.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{there being}} 20 named systems, five above the average, only four storms {{directly}} affected land. Hurricane Eugene {{was the first}} Pacific hurricane to make landfall in Mexico in July since the 1954 season and caused all of the season's three deaths and $142.12 million damage. Tropical Storm Pilar and Hurricane Norma also came close to land, with the former producing record rain in Baja California Sur. The remnants <b>of</b> <b>Hurricanes</b> Ramon and Norma caused rain in the Continental United States. Elsewhere, Peke was a central north Pacific hurricane that crossed the International Dateline and became a typhoon of the 1987 Pacific typhoon season.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Humberto was a {{moderately}} powerful hurricane that briefly affected Bermuda in September 2001. It was the eighth named storm of the season, {{as well as}} the fourth hurricane. It formed on September 21 between Puerto Rico and Bermuda, partially related to previous Hurricane Gabrielle. Humberto passed about 140 miles (225km) west of Bermuda, which spared the island with its strongest winds. After weakening and believed {{to be on the verge}} of dissipating, Humberto unexpectedly restrengthened to the southeast of Atlantic Canada. The intensification was short-lived and the storm dissipated on September 27. There were a series of significant observational flights into the hurricane that produced a wealth of data on the structure <b>of</b> <b>hurricanes.</b>|$|E
5|$|On June1, CSU {{released}} an updated forecast, {{increasing the number}} of predicted named storms to 8, due to the early formation of Tropical Storm Ana, while keeping the predictions for hurricanes and major hurricanes at 3 and 1, respectively; the ACE index forecast was also kept at 40 units. Probabilities of a major hurricane making landfall on various coastal areas remained below average. On August5, TSR updated their forecast and lowered the number <b>of</b> <b>hurricanes</b> developing within the basin to 4, with only 1 forecasted to be a major hurricane. The ACE index was also reduced to 44 units.|$|E
5|$|On November8, Lafourche Parish, Louisiana president, Charlotte Randolph, {{declared}} a state of emergency for the parish as the storm approached the United States Gulf Coast. Although no evacuations were issued, all schools and government offices were closed through November10. Voluntary evacuations were issued for residents in Plaquemines Parish along coastal areas. The Belle Chasse Auditorium was converted into a shelter to house evacuees for the duration of the storm. Grand Isle mayor David Carmadelle issued voluntary evacuation orders for residents in recreational vehicles and trailers on the island. Nearly 1,400 families still living in temporary FEMA homes in Louisiana, in the wake <b>of</b> <b>Hurricanes</b> Katrina and Rita, were urged to stay at home.|$|E
