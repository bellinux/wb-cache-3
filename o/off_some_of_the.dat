5|$|The 1846 {{session of}} Parliament {{experienced}} a snowstorm of bills for new railways; {{many of these}} threatened to encroach on the GPK area of influence and abstract business; several schemes were promoted by the Caledonian Railway or its allies; in self-defence the GPK itself promoted numerous schemes—in fact 25 branches {{as well as a}} bill nominally by the K to authorise the modernisation works—to head <b>off</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> encroachment.|$|E
5|$|In the 1940s, freight and World War II traffic helped pay <b>off</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> debt the SIRT had accumulated, briefly {{making the}} SIRT profitable. During the second World War, {{all of the}} east coast {{military}} hospital trains were handled by the SIRT, with some trains stopping at Arlington on Staten Island to transfer wounded soldiers to a large military hospital. The need to transport war material, POW trains, and troops, made the stretch of the Baltimore & New York Railway between Cranford Junction and the Arthur Kill extremely busy. The B also operated special trains for important officials such as Winston Churchill.|$|E
5|$|The next day, a {{group of}} Yugoslav Navy vessels {{deployed}} to the Split Channel, organised into the Kaštela tactical group (TG) and bombarded the city of Split {{in retaliation for the}} loss of Mukos. In return, Croatian coastal artillery engaged the Kaštela TG. To draw <b>off</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> artillery fire, the Yugoslav Navy deployed another group of vessels from the island of Vis, organised as the Vis TG, south of Šolta where the TG was engaged by more Croatian artillery. The Kaštela TG retreated east and joined with the Ploče TG consisting of three minesweepers.|$|E

5|$|Like his father, Adams {{embarked}} on a political career {{with the support of}} the Boston Caucus. He was elected to his first political office in 1747, serving as one of the clerks of the Boston market. In 1756, the Boston Town Meeting elected him to the post of tax collector, which provided a small income. He often failed to collect taxes from his fellow citizens, which increased his popularity among those who did not pay, but left him liable for the shortage. By 1765, his account was more than £8,000 in arrears. The town meeting was on the verge of bankruptcy, and Adams was compelled to file suit against delinquent taxpayers, but many taxes went uncollected. In 1768, his political opponents used the situation to their advantage, obtaining a court judgment of £1,463 against him. Adams's friends paid <b>off</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deficit, and the town meeting wrote off the remainder. By then, he had emerged as a leader of the popular party, and the embarrassing situation did not lessen his influence.|$|E
5|$|Madre de Deus entered Dartmouth harbor on 7 September, {{towering over}} the other ships and the town's small houses as it sailed by. The only vessel {{guarding}} the great ship was Roebuck, as the other vessels had slipped off to Portsmouth to sell <b>off</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plunder. Nothing like Madre had ever been seen in England - the frame from the beakhead to the stern was 165 feet long. The breadth at the broadest deck, was just over 46 feet and her draft was twenty-six feet at her arrival in Dartmouth. Her several decks; consisted of a main orlop, three main decks, and a forecastle and a spar deck of two floors each. The length of the keel was 100 feet, the main-mast was 121 feet, and its circumference at the partners was just over ten feet. The main-yard was 106 feet long.|$|E
5|$|Much {{of what he}} did in the Senate can be {{described}} as the typical sponsorship of legislation that would benefit his state. With his sponsorship, the Senate passed a bill that would aid railroads in Florida, and another that would sell <b>off</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> live oak reservations maintained by the Federal government for the Navy; both bills failed in the House of Representatives. He was more successful with bills aimed at prosecuting the ongoing campaign against the Seminole Indians, although the problem seems to have been overstated. His bills would provide compensation for persons who had suffered from the depredations of Indian raids, and would further the process of removing the aborigines from the state. He also introduced bills that provided for marine hospitals in port cities in Florida. None of this would have been considered exceptional for the era.|$|E

5|$|On 22 October, as the HV neared {{completion}} of the operations to secure Konavle, the 4th Guards Brigade and the 163rd Infantry Brigade moved north-east from Dubrovnik and attacked the VRS positions closest to the city. The main HV attack, assigned to the 3rd and the 5th Battalions of the 4th Guards Brigade, was directed to capture Vlaštica Peak. The 1st Battalion and an independent armoured-mechanized company of the 4th Guards Brigade were deployed to draw <b>off</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> VRS defences as they attacked towards the village of Cerovac and Hum railway station. The 163rd Infantry Brigade supported the main axis of the operation, advancing from Župa Dubrovačka towards Vlaštica. By 26 October, the VRS left flank in Popovo field collapsed {{and the town of}} Trebinje, the main Bosnian Serb centre in the region, came into jeopardy. However, Tuđman gave way to international pressure to halt the military operations around Dubrovnik and the fighting stopped by 1 November 1992.|$|E

The B also operated special trains for important officials such as Winston Churchill. On June 25, 1946, a fire wrecked the terminal at Saint George killing three people, injuring twenty-two people, and causing damage worth $22,000,000. The fire destroyed the ferry terminal and the four slips used for Manhattan service, the terminal for Staten Island Rapid Transit trains. Normal service was not restored until July 13, 1946. Bids to build a temporary terminal went out on August 21, 1946. The construction of a replacement terminal was promised by Mayor William O'Dwyer on February 10, 1948. The new terminal opened on June 8, 1951, with ferry, bus and rail service all within one building. Previous portions of the terminal were phased into service at earlier dates. The new terminal cost $23 million.|$|E

25|$|The fully {{polynomial}} time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for the knapsack problem {{takes advantage of}} the fact that the reason the problem has no known {{polynomial time}} solutions is because the profits associated with the items are not restricted. If one rounds <b>off</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> least significant digits of the profit values then they will be bounded by a polynomial and 1/ε where ε is a bound on the correctness of the solution. This restriction then means that an algorithm can find a solution in polynomial time that is correct within a factor of (1-ε) of the optimal solution.|$|E

The easiest way to influence Päts and his party {{is said to have been}} the Estonian-Russian Chamber of Commerce. Päts was secretly very Russian-minded, as he was grown in a Russian-language family. Ilmjärv even claims that Päts had suggested federation between Estonia and the Soviet Union to the Soviet embassy in Tallinn.|$|E

25|$|With {{proposals}} for the North Staffordshire Railway underway by 1845, the canal company threatened {{to build their}} own railway between the branch of the Manchester and Birmingham Railway at Macclesfield and Harecastle Tunnel, where it would meet the North Staffordshire Railway. The railway promoters immediately tried to gain the support of the Macclesfield Canal, by offering them shares, and requesting their assistance in promoting their Act of Parliament. The canal company suggested that the railway could lease the canal at £2 per share per year. The railway company responded with an alternative plan, which would see them buying the canal within five years for £2.50 per share, and paying <b>off</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> canal's debts. This was rejected by the shareholders, who authorised the committee to negotiate with other railways, or to seek the required powers {{to build their own}} railway.|$|E
