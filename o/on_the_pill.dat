2500|$|Prior to {{the second}} world war, birth control was {{prohibited}} in many countries, and in the United States even the discussion of contraceptive methods sometimes led to prosecution under Comstock laws. [...] The history {{of the development of}} oral contraceptives is thus closely tied to the birth control movement and the efforts of activists Margaret Sanger, Mary Dennett, and Emma Goldman. Based on fundamental research performed by Gregory Pincus and synthetic methods for progesterone developed by Carl Djerassi at Syntex and by Frank Colton at G.D. Searle & Co., the first oral contraceptive, Enovid, was developed by E.D. Searle and Co. and approved by the FDA in 1960. [...] The original formulation incorporated vastly excessive doses of hormones, and caused severe side effects. [...] Nonetheless, by 1962, 1.2 million American women were <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>pill,</b> and by 1965 the number had increased to 6.5 million. The availability of a convenient form of temporary contraceptive led to dramatic changes in social mores including expanding the range of lifestyle options available to women, reducing the reliance of women on men for contraceptive practice, encouraging the delay of marriage, and increasing pre-marital co-habitation.|$|E

The following month, she is devastated when Nigel fails to visit. She breaks down in tears, telling Bradley that she and Nigel had grown apart as she had aged. Later, she tells Garry Hobbs (Ricky Groves) that Nigel was unsupportive when she slept with a boy at school and got a reputation for being promiscuous, simply putting her <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>pill.</b> Bradley's support helps Clare realise she has to change and vows to put her gold digging behind her but Bradley finds her diary that shows her plan to take his money. He subsequently turns against her so Clare throws a party at Dot's house, inviting random people who trash the place. Dot, realising Clare is depressed, tries to get her to seek counsel from God. Clare reacts with fury, but following advice from Lucas Johnson (Don Gilet), she tries to make amends with Dot and even attempts to pray but Bradley is not convinced and insists Clare leave Walford. Clare does, leaving behind a goodbye letter for Dot and stealing £200 from Bradley, leaving in a black taxi on 7 August 2008 ...|$|E
2500|$|Based upon a {{view that}} life begins at conception, Protestant author Randy Alcorn rejects all forms of {{hormonal}} contraceptives, while James Dobson and obstetrician and minister William R. Cutrer reject only certain forms of them. Dobson and Cutrer view progesterone-only birth control pills as potentially problematic, since they may be potentially abortive contraceptives because of the theoretical possibility {{that they may have}} a slight secondary action of preventing a fertilized embryo from implanting within the uterine wall, while Alcorn implicates all hormonal contraceptives as problematic in these regards. Dobson's Focus on the Family states,Dr. Dobson would emphasize as foundational his strict concurrence with the biblical teaching that every child is a blessing from God ... While affirming that human life begins with fertilization (the union of sperm and egg), his interpretation of Scripture leads him to believe that the prevention of fertilization is not morally wrong. However, he would oppose any method of birth control that acts after fertilization and terminates a conceived human life by preventing its implantation in the womb ... After two years of extended deliberation and prayer, the PRC {{has not been able to}} reach a consensus as to the likelihood, or even the possibility, that these medications might contribute to the loss of human life after fertilization. The majority of the experts to which Dr. Dobson has spoken feel that the pill does not have an abortifacient effect. A minority of the experts feel that when conception occurs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>pill,</b> there is enough of a possibility for an abortifacient effect , however remote, to warrant informing women about it.|$|E

6000|$|The Cambridge author, perhaps, is {{thinking}} of the pill (not purge) which, in Satiromastix, might be administered to Jonson. The Cambridge author may have thought that Shakespeare wrote the passage <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>pill</b> which was to [...] "fetch up" [...] masses of Ben's insolence, self- love, arrogance, and detraction. If this be not the sequence of ideas, {{it is not easy}} to understand how or why Kempe is made to say that Shakespeare has given Jonson a purge. Stupid old nonsense! There are other more or less obscure indications of Jonson's spite, during the stage-quarrel, against Shakespeare, but the most unmistakable proof lies in his verses in [...] "Poet-Ape." [...] I am aware that Ben's intention here to hit at Shakespeare has been denied, for example by Mr. Collins with his usual vigour of language. But though I would fain agree with him, the object of attack can be no known person save Will. Jonson was already, in The Poetaster, using the term [...] "Poet-Ape," [...] for he calls the actors at large [...] "apes." ...|$|E

Women <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>pill</b> earned overall less than those not <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>pill.</b> The results were interpreted as evidence of estrus in humans: females apparently advertise their fertility status to males in some manner.
