25|$|Raceway-type {{ponds and}} lakes {{are open to}} the elements. Open ponds are highly {{vulnerable}} to contamination by other microorganisms, such as other algal species or bacteria.

25|$|However, these {{techniques}} {{were found to}} be technically limiting and expensive. A more effective solution was to electronically shift the resonators’ frequencies to the oscillators’ output frequencies. This had the advantage that the resonators {{did not need to be}} individually trimmed; instead their frequencies could be measured and appropriate scaling coefficients recorded in the oscillator ICs. In addition, the resonators’ temperatures could be electronically measured, and the frequency scaling could be adjusted to compensate for the resonators’ frequency variation <b>over</b> <b>temperature.</b>|$|E
