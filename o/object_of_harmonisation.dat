This results in new demands for up-to-date and precise forest information-especially {{with regard to the}} increase of forest damages by natural hazards. Remote Sensing techniques are appropriated for delivering information in support of such tasks. We present details of a research project that focuses on the demonstration of the potential of satellite data for forest management planning and disaster management. Integrated in the over-all concept of a decision support system (DSS) for the forest-wood chain (Entscheidungs-Unterstützungs-System Forst-Holz, EUS-FH), the frame conditions for a "Remote Sensing based Inventory and Monitoring System" for the forest-wood chain are developed. Particular focus is on investigations towards synergistic and complementary use of the two German satellite systems RapidEye and Terra SAR-X. The comparison is done on base of the accuracy of parameter derivation with each of the systems. The results deliver a couple of arguments for combined multispectral and SAR data use for monitoring and fast response situations in case of sudden calamities. But it reveals as well that the references against the results should be compared and, at the end, which represents the data layers to be updated, do not always fit from both, the semantic meaning e. g., the definition of "forest" to cartographic differences, and the representation <b>of</b> <b>object</b> categories. <b>Harmonisation</b> <b>of</b> definitions and categories to be mapped is needed...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to assess several {{pathways}} of a harmonised European policy framework for supporting renewable electricity (RES-E) in a 2030 horizon according to different criteria. The pathways combine two main dimensions: degrees <b>of</b> <b>harmonisation</b> and instruments and design elements. A quantitative model-based analysis with the Green-X model is provided. The results of the simulations show that there are small differences between the evaluated cases regarding effectiveness. All the policy pathways score similarly with respect to RES-E deployment, i. e., with different degrees <b>of</b> <b>harmonisation</b> and whether using a feed-in tariff, a feed-in premium, a quota system with banding or a quota without banding scheme. In contrast, the policy costs clearly differ across the pathways, but the differences can mostly be attributed to the instruments rather than to the degrees <b>of</b> <b>harmonisation.</b> This is also the case with other criteria (static and dynamic efficiency and the socioeconomic and environmental benefits in terms of CO 2 emissions and fossil fuels avoided). Both the degree <b>of</b> <b>harmonisation</b> and the choice of instrument influence the distribution of support costs across countries. Finally, our findings suggest that keeping strengthened national support leads to similar results to other policy pathways...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: the {{analysis}} of bachelor’s training objectives in “Pedagogical Education”, formulated by the Federal Educational Standards (FES), brings {{to the conclusion that}} there is a mismatch between them. Achiev- ing one assumes fundamentalisation of teacher’s education, and the other - the improvement of its practical orientation. The research reveals that teacher’s education component corresponds to the development of relevant scientific field. Proposed measures to achieve these goals are often in opposition to the components of teacher’s education. Since the training of students in all activities specified by FES, is carried out in a single educational process, there is a necessity to search for means that eliminate this mismatch, i. e., harmonise teacher’s education. Materials and Methods: a number of studies is concerned with identifying the content of fundamental and practical aspect of training Bachelor’s degree students. Fundamentalisation is strengthening the role of teaching methodology, in particular the methods of research, construction of training courses based on the computerised simulation, systems analysis and activity approach. The practical orientation of education is to form students’ skills based on theoretical and methodological knowledge and universal educational actions. Results: modern methodological thinking serves a basis <b>of</b> <b>harmonisation</b> that embodies a number of profes- sional competence of a teacher extended on the fundamentalisation of education, and on a practical orientation as well. Searching for means <b>of</b> <b>harmonisation</b> <b>of</b> fundamentality and practical orientation of Bachelors training leads to the conclusion that among effective means are tasks that simulate real learning situations, a business game, its simulation, training projects, classes where the experiment is carried out. From the perspective <b>of</b> <b>harmonisation</b> <b>of</b> Bachelors training the author identifies requirements to lecturing and conducting workshops. Discussion and Conclusions: the paper summarises the implementation of the theory <b>of</b> <b>harmonisation</b> <b>of</b> Bachelors training in “Pedagogical education”; presents samples of lectures and workshops that meet the requirement <b>of</b> that <b>harmonisation...</b>|$|R

This article suggest that the degree <b>of</b> <b>harmonisation</b> sought has often been vague and that more progress might be made if it were generally agreed how far the progress should go. The paper examines the case for tax harmonisation and its meaning - concluding that tax harmonisation is consistent with fiscal regional diversity. In Europe the principle of 2 ̆ 2 subsidiarity 2 ̆ 2 has been invoked to attempt to resolve conflict between overall harmonisation while retaining diversity among Member States. The European experience with corporate tax harmonisation is analysed and compared with progress between Australia and New Zealand.

40|$|With the issuing of Commission Regulation n. 1606 / 2002, which {{requires}} all EU listed companies to adopt International Financial Reporting Standards (IAS/IFRS) from 2005 onwards, the accounting harmonisation process in Europe {{has come to}} a relevant stage. The requirement of applying International Financial Reporting Standards (IAS/IFRSs) in Italy is producing several adapting issues since the International Accounting System {{is quite different from the}} Italian Accounting System. In particular, among EU countries, relevant cultural, social and economic diversities are observable in terms of typical proprietorship structure, average size of the firms, role played by financial institutions, especially banks, role played by investors and financial capital markets. Another difference concerns the different role of market reference for the valuation of assets and liabilities. Moreover, usually, the form prevails over the substance in the accounting representation of economic matters, especially in the accounting for consolidation purposes. On the basis of these premises, the adoption of IAS/IFRS’s and, more eminently, the introduction of International Accounting Standards for the consolidation accounting (IFRS 3 and IAS 27), means a radical change. The traditional focus on prudence as an essential characteristic of financial statements is to be broken, to apply a different concept of income, in which unrealized revenues are generally recognized in the income statement as an integral part of the financial performance of the firm. Drawn on this accounting innovation, the paper intends to investigate the relationship between the requirement for all Italian listed companies and groups to adopt International Financial Reporting Standards starting from 2005 and the degree <b>of</b> <b>harmonisation</b> in the financial reporting practice with reference to the valuation of Investments in Subsidiaries (IAS 27), Investments in Associates (IAS 28), Investments in Joint Ventures (IAS 31) and other investments (IAS 39), picking out a sample of listed Italian groups consolidated financial statement. The first step is the development of a framework for the identification <b>of</b> various <b>objects</b> whose degree <b>of</b> <b>harmonisation</b> will be investigated. Subsequently a method will be developed in order to quantify the degree of harmony in financial reporting practice for each of the selected items in the annual accounts. For this purpose, some harmonisation indexes will be applied like the Van der Tas H Index. Furthermore a sample of 125 Italian listed groups, 12 banks and 113 industrial groups will be selected. Finally a comparison between Banks and Industrial Groups will be undertaken in order to draw some conclusions...|$|R
