50|$|Wet layup forming {{combines}} fibre reinforcement and {{the matrix}} {{as they are}} placed on the forming tool. Reinforcing Fibre layers are placed in an <b>open</b> <b>mould</b> and then saturated with a wet resin by pouring it over the fabric and working it into the fabric. The mould is then left so that the resin will cure, usually at room temperature, though heat is sometimes used to ensure a proper cure. Sometimes a vacuum bag is used to compress a wet layup. Glass fibres are most commonly used for this process, the results are widely known as fibreglass, and is used to make common products like skis, canoes, kayaks and surf boards.|$|E

50|$|Although it is {{possible}} to find some core-form objects produced by the Sasanians, these are rarities (Goldstein 2005, 28-62). The whole of the Sasanian assemblage is glassblowing. The most frequent technique among the Sasanians was to blow the object giving it a basic shape and then finishing it with the help of paddles, pincers and shears. Other techniques frequently used were mould-blowing and the mould-pressing. These two use the mould as the essential part of the process (See Figure 4). In the former the object is blown inside a mould, acquiring the shape and decoration of the final object. In the second stage the mould is removed and the object is blown to the appropriate size.

40|$|Glass fibre {{reinforced}} polyester (GFRP) pultruded composite {{consists of}} polyester resin (thermosetting polymer) as a matrix and glass fibre as reinforcement. It is manufactured through a continuous pultrusion process to form structural sections. During the manufacturing process, the form(s) of continuous glass fibres are pulled {{from one end}} of the line into a resin bath that contains liquid polyester resin, curing agent (initiator), and other ingredients. The fibre-resin is then passed through in the heated die for curing to form a hard, solid and continuous structural section. Since 1990 s, the use of the glass fibre reinforced polymeric composites in the construction industry has grown very rapidly especially in developed countries. The applications of the composite material are mainly in building structures, bridges, offshore structures, etc. The development of the material in the construction industry in Malaysia is still at its infancy.
