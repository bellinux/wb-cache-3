40|$|The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) has mainly {{been used}} for {{managing}} IP (Internet Protocol) networks. Until recently, OSI (<b>Open</b> <b>Systems</b> <b>Interconnection)</b> <b>management</b> has been the choice for managing non-IP-networks as well as larger systems where management by delegation is necessary. With version 2, SNMP became more suitable for these systems. One of the drawbacks of SNMP has been that it focuses more on implementation than on design. When implementing large network management systems, the design phase is essential. This report presents a framework for SNMPv 2 where iterations in the design phase have a low turn-around time. Prototyping of MIBs (Management Information Bases) is simplified by automated implementation of instrumentation functions for scalar variables as well as tables. The purpose of the framework is to facilitate MIB design and agent implementation by providing a user-friendly environment. For this, the Erlang programming language has shown to be [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Master of Science in Engineering - EngineeringFaults are {{unavoidable}} {{and cause}} network downtime and degradation of large and complex communication networks. The need for fault management capabilities for improving network reliability {{is critical to}} rectify these faults. Current communication networks are moving towards the distributed computing environment enabling these networks to transport heterogeneous multimedia information across end to end connections. An advanced fault management system is thus required for such communication networks. Fault Management provides information {{on the status of}} the network by locating, detecting, identifying, isolating, and correcting network problems thereby increasing network reliability. The TINA (Telecommunication Information Networking Architecture) standards define a Network Resource Architecture (NRA) that provides a framework of a transport network that is capable of transporting heterogeneous multimedia media information across heterogeneous networks. TINA also defines a Management Architecture that follows the functional area organization defined in the OSI (<b>Open</b> <b>Systems</b> <b>Interconnection)</b> <b>Management</b> Framework, namely fault, configuration, accounting, performance, and security management (FCAPS). The aim of this project is to utilise the TINA NRA and Management Architecture concepts and principles to design and implement a distributed Fault Management Service for heterogeneous networks. The design presented here utilises TINA’s fault management specifi- cations, together with UML modelling tools to developed this Fault Management Service. The design incorporates the use of CORBA and SNMP to provide a distributed management functionality capable of providing fault management support across heterogeneous networks. The generic nature of the fault management service is tested on the SATINA Trial platform which consists of both an ATM network as well as an IP MPLS network. The report concludes that the Fault Management Service is applicable to any connectionoriented network that is modeled using the TINA NRA specification and principles...|$|E

This paper presents a approach for the design and implementation of a distributed intelligent system that is designed through the normalization of knowledge management. Our study focuses on a language for formalizing knowledge management descriptions and an intelligent framework and combining them with an existing <b>Open</b> <b>Systems</b> <b>Interconnection</b> (OSI) <b>management</b> model. Further, this work outlines {{the development of an}} example based on our proposed standard...|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of a}} {{management}} system in a distributed computing environment {{is to provide a}} centralized and coordinated view of an otherwise distributed and heterogeneous collection of hardware and software resources. The management software required to achieve this goal will, within a policy framework, monitor, analyze and control network resources, system services and distributed application programs. In our research, we investigate the use of the <b>Open</b> <b>System</b> <b>Interconnection</b> (OSI) network <b>management</b> standards as a basis for a generic architecture around which such management systems can be built. We are particularly interested in the suitability and flexibility of the OSI standards in the context of managing application programs. The work described in the current paper focusses on efficiency and dynamic control of management data acquisition and on the run-time control of application programs. We describe a prototype management system developed to explore these issues in the management of [...] ...|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s the term FCAPS was {{introduced}} {{within the first}} Working Drafts (N1719) of ISO 10040, the <b>Open</b> <b>Systems</b> <b>Interconnection</b> (OSI) <b>Systems</b> <b>Management</b> Overview (SMO) standard. At that time the intention was to define five separate protocol standards, one for each functional area. Since initial experiences showed that these protocols would become very similar, the ISO working group responsible {{for the development of}} these protocols (ISO/TC97/SC16/WG4, later renamed into ISO-IEC/JTC1/SC21/WG4) decided to create a single protocol for all five areas instead. This protocol is called common management information protocol (CMIP). In the 1990s the ITU-T, as part of their work on Telecommunications Management Network (TMN), further refined the FCAPS as part of the TMN recommendation on Management Functions (M.3400). The idea of FCAPS turned out to be very useful for teaching network management functions; most textbooks therefore start with a section that explains the FCAPS.|$|R
