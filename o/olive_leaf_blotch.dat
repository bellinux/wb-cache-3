40|$|AbstractThe ethnobotanical uses of wild olive, O. europaea subsp. africana (sometimes {{referred}} to as subsp. cuspidata) in southern Africa and {{in other parts of}} Africa are reviewed. Chromatographic analyses of secoiridoids (oleuropein and other oleuropeosides) in 25 wild <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> samples from 10 localities in South Africa showed substantial amounts of oleuropein (up to 110 mg/g dry weight) and not trace amounts as reported in the literature. Oleuropein is the main active compound in <b>olive</b> <b>leaf,</b> with demonstrated anti-oxidant, anti-microbial, hypolipidemic and hypotensive activities. A comparison with nine cultivated <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> samples (subsp. europaea) from six cultivars and two localities showed that commercial <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> can be distinguished by the presence of verbascoside, which is absent in wild olive. Extraction methods and solvent systems (TLC and HPLC) were compared, using pure oleuropein (isolated from wild <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> and identified by NMR) as an authentic reference sample. The unique peltate scales on the leaves are useful to identify <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> raw material (but are the same in both subspecies). The main conclusion is that wild <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> is chemically closely similar to cultivated <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> and therefore suitable as an alternative source of raw material for <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> extract...|$|R

40|$|Septoria <b>leaf</b> <b>blotch</b> and Stagonospora {{glume blotch}} are very common {{diseases}} of wheat, prevalent in rainy years and under continuous wheat production. <b>Leaf</b> <b>blotch</b> primarily affects leaves; glume blotch affects leaves, glumes and nodes. The diseases can cause kernel shrivel and yield reduction, and if infected seeds are planted, reduction of germination and seedling blight. Crop rotation and plowing under, resistant varieties, adequate nutrition and seeding rate, and protectant fungicides should help {{in reducing the}} severity of both diseases. Symptoms Lesions start in the lower leaves as irregular water soaked chlorotic flecks developing into linear or rectangular (<b>leaf</b> <b>blotch)</b> or lens-shaped (glume blotch) spots, often with dark-brown borders. As the lesions expand the centers become pale, straw colored, and slightly necrotic. Figure 1. Glume damage due to Stagonospora glume blotch. APS Digital Image. <b>Leaf</b> <b>blotch</b> is usually limited to wheat leaves. In addition, glume blotch causes gray to brown discoloration of the glumes beginning at the glume tip and progressing towards the base (Figure 1), and can also affect leaf sheaths and nodes causing bending of the stems. <b>Leaf</b> <b>blotch</b> mature lesions are characterized {{by the presence of}} numerous small readily visible black dots (pycnidia, Figure 2).

40|$|Red <b>leaf</b> <b>blotch</b> {{is one of}} {{the major}} fungal foliar {{diseases}} affecting almond orchards. High-resolution thermal and hyperspectral airborne imagery was acquired from two flights and compared with concurrent field visual evaluations for disease incidence and severity. Canopy temperature and vegetation indices were calculated from thermal and hyperspectral imagery and analyzed for their ability to detect the disease at early stages. The classification methods linear discriminant analysis and support vector machine, using linear and radial basis kernels, were applied to a combination of these vegetation indices in order to quantify and discriminate between red <b>leaf</b> <b>blotch</b> severity levels. Chlorophyll and carotenoid indices and chlorophyll fluorescence were effective in detecting red <b>leaf</b> <b>blotch</b> at the early stages of disease development. Linear models showed higher power to separate between asymptomatic trees and those affected by advanced stages of disease development while the non-linear model was better in discriminating asymptomatic plants from those at early stages of red <b>leaf</b> <b>blotch</b> development.

40|$|Background Epidemiological {{studies have}} shown a reduced {{incidence}} of cardiovascular disease in the Mediterranean population attributed to the consumption of dietary olive oil rich in antioxidants. This has lead to increased interest in the antioxidant properties of other phenolic compounds of olive tree products. It {{has been suggested that}} <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> extract may also have health benefits due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Antioxidants can prevent the effects of oxidative metabolism by scavenging free radicals and decreasing the hyperactivity of platelets associated with the development of occlusive thrombosis. No studies to date have investigated the effects of <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> extract on platelet function to our knowledge. Improved understanding of the antioxidant properties of <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> extract and its effect on platelet function could lead to improved cardiovascular health. Objective The current study used an <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> extract prepared from the Olea europaea L. tree. The aim was to determine if polyphenols in <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> extract would reduce platelet activity and, to establish an optimal dose in vitro that would reduce platelet aggregation and ATP release. Design Eleven subjects with normal platelet counts (150 – 400 x 109 /L) were recruited for the current in vitro study. <b>Olive</b> <b>leaf</b> extract was added to citrated whole blood to obtain five concentrations ranging from 5. 4 ug/mL to 54. 0 ug/mL for a dose response curve. Baseline samples, without <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> extract were used as a negative control for each subject. After 2 hours incubation with <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> extract samples were analyzed for platelet aggregation and ATP release from platelets stimulated by the addition of collagen. Results Whole blood analysis (n= 11) showed a clear dose-dependant reduction in platelet aggregation with the increasing <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> extract concentrations (p< 0. 0001). There was also a similar decrease in ATP release from collagen stimulated platelets (p= 0. 02). Conclusion In the current study the <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> extract obtained from Olea europaea L. inhibited platelet aggregation and ATP release from collagen stimulated platelets in vitro.
