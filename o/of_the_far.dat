5|$|At 03:30 {{local time}} on 8 December 1941 (about 09:00 on 7 December in Hawaii), Sutherland {{learned of the}} attack on Pearl Harbor and {{informed}} MacArthur. At 05:30, the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army, General George Marshall, ordered MacArthur to execute the existing war plan, Rainbow Five. MacArthur did nothing. On three occasions, the commander <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Far</b> East Air Force, Major General Lewis H. Brereton, requested permission to attack Japanese bases in Formosa, in accordance with prewar intentions, but was denied by Sutherland. Not until 11:00 did Brereton speak with MacArthur about it, and obtained permission. MacArthur later denied having the conversation. At 12:30, nine hours after the attack on Pearl Harbor, aircraft of Japan's 11th Air Fleet achieved complete tactical surprise when they attacked Clark Field and the nearby fighter base at Iba Field, and destroyed or disabled 18 of Far East Air Force's 35 B-17s, 53 of its 107 P-40s, three P-35s, and more than 25 other aircraft. Most were destroyed on the ground. Substantial damage was done to the bases, and casualties totaled 80 killed and 150 wounded. What was left <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Far</b> East Air Force was all but destroyed over the next few days.|$|E

This paper also shows that factors such as perception and will of economic actors who directly or indirectly participate in the RFE economy and the correlation between economic actors can be considered as an important barometer that demonstrates <b>the</b> prospect <b>of</b> economic development in the RFE. The study will also provide some implications on <b>the</b> economic development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Russian <b>Far</b> East...|$|R
40|$|This article {{extends the}} current {{literature}} on European far left parties by investigating the socio-demographic, ideological and attitudinal profile <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French <b>far</b> left voter in the 2012 Presidential Elections. Particular {{emphasis is placed}} on <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> economic crisis on the sudden electoral rise <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French <b>far</b> left and factors such as economic hardship, change of economic conditions, attitudes toward economic inequality and Euroscepticism. Results suggest that explanations based purely on economic factors fall short <b>of</b> explaining <b>the</b> totality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French <b>far</b> left vote, especially if compared with <b>the</b> other parties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French <b>far</b> left. Instead, attitudes toward Europe and post-materialism are central in <b>the</b> understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> renaissance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French <b>far</b> left. Based on these findings we reach a number <b>of</b> conclusions regarding <b>the</b> future <b>of</b> <b>far</b> left parties in France and Europe...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>FARs</b> are {{organized}} into sections, called parts {{due to their}} organization within the CFR. Each part deals with {{a specific type of}} activity. For example, 14 CFR Part 141 contains rules for pilot training schools. The sections most relevant to aircraft pilots and AMTs (Aviation Maintenance Technicians) are listed below. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>FARs</b> are designed to regulate certification of pilots, schools, or aircraft rather than <b>the</b> operation <b>of</b> airplanes. Once an airplane design is certified using some parts of these regulations, it is certified regardless <b>of</b> whether <b>the</b> regulations change in the future. For that reason, newer planes are certified using newer versions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>FARs,</b> and in many aspects may be thus considered safer designs.|$|R
5|$|Graphs and {{directed}} graphs {{can be viewed}} as a special case <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> more general notion called relational structures (defined as a set with a tuple of relations on it).

5|$|After the war, the British and French {{intervened in}} the Russian Civil War; this {{included}} a major naval deployment to the Baltic Sea, which included Waldeck-Rousseau. Shortly after arriving, her crew mutinied due to poor living conditions {{and a desire}} to return to France. The unrest was quickly suppressed, and Waldeck-Rousseau joined the effort to support the Whites against the Red Bolsheviks. In May 1929, the ship was sent to French Indochina to serve as the flagship <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Far</b> East squadron. She remained there until May 1932, when she returned to France, where she was decommissioned and hulked. Waldeck-Rousseau was ultimately scrapped in 194144.|$|E

These incursions suggested that a major escalation in the conflict was imminent, and in January 1965 the government conceded to British and Malaysian requests, subsequently agreeing to deploy an infantry battalion to Borneo, in addition to a battery of artillery, an engineer construction squadron, and a squadron from the Special Air Service Regiment.|$|E
