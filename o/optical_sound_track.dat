50|$|Starting in 1971 In-flight movies (previously 16 mm) {{were shown}} in Super 8 format until video {{distribution}} became the norm. The films were printed with an <b>optical</b> <b>sound</b> <b>track</b> (amateur films use magnetic sound), and spooled into proprietary cassettes that often held a whole 2-hour movie.|$|E
50|$|In 1926 Fox hired Sponible, bought Case's patents (they {{had already}} {{acquired}} Freeman Owens' and Tri-Ergon's), and mass-produced Case's Aeo-light {{for use in}} all Movietone News cameras from 1928 to 1939. These cameras recorded all Fox feature films from 1928-1931, the first being F. W. Murnau's Sunrise (1927). As the first professionally produced feature with an <b>optical</b> <b>sound</b> <b>track,</b> it included mostly music and sound effects, with a very few unsynchronized words.|$|E
50|$|Synchromy (French: Synchromie) is a 1971 National Film Board of Canada visual music film by Norman McLaren {{utilizing}} graphical sound. To {{produce the}} film's musical soundtrack, McLaren photographed rectangular cards with lines on them. He arranged these shapes in sequences on the analog <b>optical</b> <b>sound</b> <b>track</b> to produce notes and chords. He then reproduced {{the sequence of}} shapes, colorized, in the image portion of the film, so that audiences see the shapes that they are also hearing, as sound.|$|E

50|$|Two basic systems {{used this}} name: the Dolby SVA (stereo variable-area) system used with <b>optical</b> <b>sound</b> <b>tracks</b> on 35mm film, and Dolby Stereo 70mm, which {{referred}} to Dolby noise reduction on 6-channel magnetic soundtracks on 70mm prints.|$|R
50|$|William Fox hired Earl I. Sponable (1895-1977) from Case Research Lab in 1926, when he {{purchased}} the sound-on-film patents from Case. The first feature film released using the Fox Movietone system was Sunrise (1927) directed by F. W. Murnau. It {{was the first}} professionally produced feature film with an <b>optical</b> <b>sound</b> <b>track.</b> The sound in the film included only music, sound effects, and very few unsynchronized words. The system was used for sound acting sequences in Mother Knows Best (1928).|$|E
50|$|Because Maxivision {{uses only}} three film {{perforations}} per frame, the twenty-four-frame-per-second format uses 25% less film than standard four-perforation formats, and the 48 frame-per-second format only requires a 50% {{increase in the}} amount of film to yield twice the frame rate. The image is exposed into the region ordinarily reserved for the analog <b>optical</b> <b>sound</b> <b>track</b> which is rarely used now. This allows for a wider image on the same size film. This also reduces the need for cropping of the image and makes for a 30% larger total frame area than traditional projection even though less film is used.|$|E
50|$|Earlier processes, used on 70 mm film {{prints and}} special presentations of 35 mm film prints, {{recorded}} sound magnetically on ferric oxide tracks bonded {{to the film}} print, outside the sprocket holes. 16 mm and Super 8 formats sometimes used a similar magnetic track on the camera film, bonded {{to one side of}} the film on which the sprocket holes had not been punched ("single perforated") for the purpose. Film of this form is no longer manufactured, but single-perforated film without the magnetic track (allowing an <b>optical</b> <b>sound</b> <b>track)</b> or, in the case of 16 mm, utilising the soundtrack area for a wider picture (Super 16 format) is readily available.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two types}} of {{synchronised}} film soundtrack, optical and magnetic. <b>Optical</b> <b>sound</b> <b>tracks</b> are visual renditions of sound wave forms and provide sound through a light beam and optical sensor within the projector. Magnetic <b>sound</b> <b>tracks</b> are essentially the same as used in conventional analog tape recording.|$|R
50|$|In {{the era of}} <b>optical</b> <b>sound</b> <b>tracks,</b> it was {{difficult}} to mix more than eight tracks at once without accumulating excessive noise. At the height of magnetic recording, 200 tracks or more could be mixed together, aided by Dolby noise reduction. In the digital era there is no limit. For example, a single predub can exceed a hundred tracks, and the final dub can be the sum of a thousand tracks.|$|R
50|$|Dean is {{best known}} for her work in 16mm film, {{although}} she utilises a variety of media including drawing, photography and sound. Her films often employ long takes and steady camera angles to create a contemplative atmosphere. Her anamorphic films are shot by cinematographers John Adderley and Jamie Cairney. Her sound recordist is Steve Felton. She has also published several pieces of her own writing, which she refers to as 'asides,' which complement her visual work. Since the mid-1990s her films have not included commentary, but are instead accompanied by often understated <b>optical</b> <b>sound</b> <b>tracks.</b>|$|R
50|$|Super 8mm {{was also}} {{specified}} with an <b>optical</b> <b>sound</b> <b>track.</b> This occupied {{the same location}} as the magnetic track. Picture to sound separation in this format was 22 frames. Projectors and cameras obviously could not record sound in this system, but optical sound package movies became briefly popular, particularly in Europe (mainly because they were cheaper to produce - though the projectors cost more). Although the optical sound should have been inferior in quality to magnetic sound (running at 3.6 inches per second for 24 frames per second), in practice it was often much better, largely because packaged movie magnetic sound was often poorly recorded.|$|E
5000|$|Arseny Mikhailovich Avraamov (Арсений Михайлович Авраамов), (born Krasnokutsky Краснокутский, 1886 died Moscow, 1944) was an avant-garde Russian {{composer}} and theorist. He {{studied at the}} music school of the Moscow Philharmonic Society, with private composition lessons from Sergey Taneyev. He refused to fight in World War I, and fled the country to work, among other things, as a circus artist. Returning in 1917, {{he went on to}} compose his famous [...] "Simfoniya gudkov" [...] and was a pioneer in Russian sound on film techniques. Among his other achievements were the invention of graphic-sonic art, produced by drawing directly onto the <b>optical</b> <b>sound</b> <b>track</b> of film, and an [...] "Ultrachromatic" [...] 48-tone microtonal system, presented in his thesis, [...] "The Universal System of Tones," [...] in Berlin, Frankfurt, and Stuttgart in 1927. His microtonal system predated the creation of the Petrograd Society for Quarter-Tone Music in 1923, by Georgii Rimskii-Korsakov.|$|E
50|$|Magnetic {{recording}} had {{magnetic media}} {{in the area where}} the <b>optical</b> <b>sound</b> <b>track</b> recorded on optical SOF or on release prints. The principal recording stripe was approximately 2 mm wide. A smaller balance stripe existed to compensate the thickness of the recording stripe to keep the film wound evenly. Auricon and Cinema Products Corporation were two popular manufacturers of this type of camera, which were made obsolete by the takeover of video for news shooting in the late 70s. To edit single system magnetic film, it was necessary to first run it through a displacement recorder which would read the audio and re-record it backwards 24 frames behind the point where it was recorded. This put the audio in dead sync with the picture. The film was then edited. After editing the film was run through the displacement recorder again, forward this time which put the audio back at the location where the audio playback head would be in the film projector.|$|E
50|$|Magnetic tape {{enabled the}} {{development}} of the first practical commercial sound systems that could record and reproduce high-fidelity stereophonic sound. The experiments with stereo during the 1930s and 1940s were hampered by problems with synchronization. A major breakthrough in practical stereo sound was made by Bell Laboratories, who in 1937 demonstrated a practical system of two-channel stereo, using dual <b>optical</b> <b>sound</b> <b>tracks</b> on film. Major movie studios quickly developed three-track and four-track sound systems, and the first stereo sound recording for a commercial film was made by Judy Garland for the MGM movie Listen, Darling in 1938.|$|R
50|$|Super 35 (originally {{known as}} Superscope 235) is a motion picture film format that uses {{exactly the same}} film stock as {{standard}} 35 mm film, but puts a larger image frame on that stock by using the negative space normally reserved for the <b>optical</b> analog <b>sound</b> <b>track.</b>|$|R
40|$|The University of South Carolina Moving Image Research Collections (MIRC) is {{collaborating with}} {{research}} faculty from the University’s Interdisciplinary Mathematics Institute (IMI) {{to develop an}} open-source software application to directly reproduce the <b>optical</b> <b>sound</b> <b>tracks</b> of motion picture films from digital scans. We seek $ 362, 125 (of a total $ 465, 905 budget), from the National Endowment for the Humanities {{over a three-year period}} to fund our collaboration and take our proven concept through development to deployment as an open-source and freely available application. Unless alternatives to current expensive approaches to digitizing sound films are found, access to most of this important material will effectively end as the commercial sector abandons support for traditional film screening equipment...|$|R
50|$|The {{first film}} with Dolby sound was A Clockwork Orange (1971), which used Dolby noise {{reduction}} on all pre-mixes and masters, but a conventional <b>optical</b> <b>sound</b> <b>track</b> on release prints. Callan (1974) {{was the first}} film with a Dolby-encoded optical soundtrack. In 1975, Dolby released Dolby Stereo, which included a noise reduction system in addition to more audio channels (Dolby Stereo could actually contain additional center and surround channels matrixed from the left and right). The first film with a Dolby-encoded stereo optical soundtrack was Lisztomania (1975), although this only used an LCR (Left-Center-Right) encoding technique. The first true LCRS (Left-Center-Right-Surround) soundtrack was encoded on the movie A Star Is Born in 1976. In less than ten years, 6,000 cinemas worldwide were equipped to use Dolby Stereo sound. Dolby reworked the system slightly for home use and introduced Dolby Surround, which only extracted a surround channel, and the more impressive Dolby Pro Logic, which was the domestic equivalent of the theatrical Dolby Stereo.|$|E
5000|$|The initial SMPTE {{definition}} for anamorphic projection with an <b>optical</b> <b>sound</b> <b>track</b> {{down the side}} (PH22.106-1957), issued in December 1957, standardized the projector aperture at 0.839 xx 0.715 in (aspect ratio 1.17:1). The aspect ratio for this aperture, after a 2x unsqueeze, is 2.3468…:1 which rounded to the commonly used value 2.35:1. A new definition was issued in October 1970 (PH22.106-1971) which specified a slightly smaller vertical dimension of 0.700 in. for the projector aperture to help make splices less noticeable to film viewers. Four-perf anamorphic prints use more of the negative's available frame area than any other modern format which leaves little room for splices; as a consequence, a bright line would flash onscreen when a splice was projected and theater projectionists had been narrowing the vertical aperture to hide these flashes even before issuance of PH22.106-1971. This new projector aperture size, 0.838 xx 0.700 in, aspect ratio 1.1971…:1, made for an un-squeezed ratio of 2.39:1 (and commonly referred to by the rounded value 2.40:1 or 2.4:1). The most recent revision, from August 1993 (SMPTE 195-1993), slightly altered the dimensions so as to standardize a common projection aperture width (0.825 in) for all formats, anamorphic (2.39:1) and flat (1.85:1). The projection aperture height was also reduced by 0.01" [...] in this modern specification to 0.825 xx 0.690 in, aspect ratio 1.1956…:1 (and commonly rounded to 1.20:1), to retain the un-squeezed ratio of 2.39:1. The camera's aperture remained the same (2.35:1 or 2.55:1 if before 1958), only {{the height of the}} [...] "negative assembly" [...] splices changed and, consequently, the height of the frame changed.|$|E
5000|$|Fidelity - Contrary to {{conventional}} wisdom, neither Vitaphone's ability {{to fill a}} theater with an adequate volume of sound nor its success in maintaining synchronization was unprecedented. Léon Gaumont's sound-on-disc films, which were being shown twenty years earlier, were successfully synchronized {{by the use of}} electrically interlinked multi-pole synchronous motors, and a pneumatic amplification system more than sufficed to fill Gaumont's 3,400-seat flagship theater in Paris with the recorded sound. That sound, however, had to be recorded by the same insensitive non-electronic method introduced by Thomas Edison in 1877, or alternatively by a very crude microphone-based variant which had logistical advantages but did not offer improved fidelity. The resulting sound, however greatly amplified it might be, was tinny and unclear and speech was difficult to understand. The footsteps and other incidental sounds that audiences instinctively expected to hear were missing. It did not sound [...] "natural". The Vitaphone system derived from extensive work on electronically recording and reproducing sound that had been carried out at Western Electric {{during the first half of}} the 1920s. Western Electric's engineers had developed a highly sensitive full-frequency-range condenser microphone, capable of capturing a whisper from several feet away, along with the electronic and mechanical equipment necessary to adequately record the audio signal it produced. As a result, the quality of Vitaphone sound in the theater came as a revelation to the audience at its public debut in 1926. It easily and dramatically surpassed anything previously achieved. It even surpassed the sound quality of Western Electric's own sound-on-film system, developed concurrently with the sound-on-disc system but still in the laboratory at that time, because at first the discs yielded better fidelity than an <b>optical</b> <b>sound</b> <b>track.</b>|$|E
50|$|Graphical {{sound or}} drawn sound (Fr. son dessiné, Ger. graphische Tonerzeugung,; It. suono disegnato) {{is a sound}} {{recording}} created from images drawn directly onto film or paper that were then played back using a sound system. There are several different techniques depending on the technology employed, but all are {{a consequence of the}} sound-on-film technology and based on the creation of artificial <b>optical</b> polyphonic <b>sound</b> <b>tracks</b> on transparent film.|$|R
50|$|The silent 16 mm format was {{initially}} {{aimed at the}} home enthusiast, but by the 1930s it had begun to make inroads into the educational market. The addition of <b>optical</b> <b>sound</b> <b>tracks</b> and, most notably, Kodachrome in 1935, gave an enormous boost to its popularity. The format was used extensively during World War II, {{and there was a}} huge expansion of 16 mm professional filmmaking in the post-war years. Films for government, business, medical and industrial clients created a large network of 16 mm professional filmmakers and related service industries in the 1950s and 1960s. The advent of television production also enhanced the use of 16 mm film, initially for its advantage of cost and portability over 35 mm. At first used as a news-gathering format, the 16 mm format was also used to create television programming shot outside the confines of the more rigid television studio production sets. The home movie market gradually switched to the even less expensive 8 mm and Super 8 mm film formats.|$|R
50|$|Walt Disney began {{experimenting with}} {{multi-channel}} {{sound in the}} early 1930s as noted above. The first commercial motion picture to be exhibited with stereophonic sound was Walt Disney's Fantasia, released in November 1940, for which a specialized sound process (Fantasound) was developed. As in the Carnegie Hall demonstrations six months earlier, Fantasound used a separate film containing four <b>optical</b> <b>sound</b> <b>tracks.</b> Three of the tracks were used to carry left, center and right audio, while the fourth track carried three tones which individually controlled the volume level of the other three. The film was not a financial success, however, and after two months of road-show exhibition in selected cities, its soundtrack was remixed into mono sound for general release. It was not until its 1956 re-release that stereo sound was restored to the film. In the early 1940s, composer-conductor Alfred Newman directed {{the construction of a}} sound stage equipped for multichannel recording for 20th Century Fox studios. Several soundtracks from this era still exist in their multichannel elements, some of which have been released on DVD, including How Green Was My Valley, Anna and the King of Siam, The Day the Earth Stood Still and Sun Valley Serenade which, along with Orchestra Wives, feature the only stereophonic recordings of the Glenn Miller Orchestra as it was during its heyday of the Swing Era.|$|R

50|$|DTS {{actually}} stores {{the sound}} information on separate CD-ROMs supplied with the film. The CDs are fed into a special modified computer which syncs {{up with the}} film {{through the use of}} DTS time code, decompresses the sound, and passes it through to a standard cinema processor. The time code is placed between the <b>optical</b> <b>sound</b> <b>tracks</b> and the actual picture, and is read by an optical LED ahead of the gate. The time code is actually the only sound system which is not offset within the film from the picture, but still needs to be physically set offset ahead of the gate in order to maintain continuous motion. Each disc can hold slightly over 90 minutes of sound, so longer films will require a second disc. Three types of DTS sound exist: DTS-ES (Extended Surround), an 8 channel digital system; DTS-6, a 6 track digital system, and a now-obsolete 4 channel system. DTS-ES derives a back surround channel from the left surround and right surround channels using Dolby Pro Logic. The audio data in a DTS track is compressed in the 20-bit APTX-100 compression scheme at a ratio of about 4.5:1. Of the three digital formats currently in use, DTS {{is the only one that}} has been used with 70 mm presentations. DTS was premiered on Jurassic Park.Datasat Digital Entertainment, purchaser of DTS's cinema division in May 2008, now distributes Datasat Digital Sound to professional cinemas worldwide.A consumer version of DTS is available on some DVDs. A bit for bit version of the DTS soundtrack is on Blu-ray Discs and HD DVDs called DTS-HD MA (DTS-HD Master Audio).|$|R
