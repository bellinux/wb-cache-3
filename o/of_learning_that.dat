5|$|In the 17th century, {{botanical gardens}} began their {{contribution}} to a deeper scientific curiosity about plants. If a botanical garden is defined by its scientific or academic connection, then the first true botanical gardens were established with the revival <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> <b>that</b> occurred in the European Renaissance. These were secular gardens attached to universities and medical schools, used as resources for teaching and research. The superintendents of these gardens were often professors of botany with international reputations, a factor that probably contributed {{to the creation of}} botany as an independent discipline rather than a descriptive adjunct to medicine.|$|E

Regan falls ill, having been poisoned by Goneril, and is escorted offstage, where she dies. Edmund defies Albany, who {{calls for a}} trial by combat. Edgar appears masked and in armour, and challenges Edmund to a duel. No one knows who he is. Edgar wounds Edmund fatally, though he does not die immediately. Albany confronts Goneril with the letter which {{was intended to be}} his death warrant; she flees in shame and rage.

500|$|The Spanish {{neuroanatomist}} Santiago Ramón y Cajal {{was among}} the first to suggest a mechanism <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> <b>that</b> did not require the formation of new neurons.

500|$|According to {{researcher}} Ibrahim Al-Khulaifi, [...] "In a few months, Iftah Ya Simsim {{became one}} of the most popular and successful programs for children in many Arab states". Critics called it [...] "one of the most successful pan-Arab collaborations of educators, creators, writers and artists from the Middle East". The show continued to trigger nostalgia in its fans, some of whom watched its reruns well into the 1990s. Rym Ghazal of The National asserts that other co-productions made in the region could not compare to Iftah Ya Simsim, which used actors and children from the region, known as Khaleeji, in their roles. Ghazal also stated, [...] "No Arabic children's television show was as popular and influential in the Middle East in the 1980s as Iftah Ya Sim Sim... That's because it offered an alternative way <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> <b>that</b> hardly existed in the Arab world at the time, just as Sesame Street had previously done in the West".|$|E
500|$|The {{book was}} {{published}} to immediate critical acclaim. Some reviewers praised the book as an exciting way to learn to read, particularly compared to the primers that it supplanted. Ellen Lewis Buell, in her review for The New York Times Book Review, noted the book's heavy use of one-syllable words and lively illustrations. She wrote, [...] "Beginning readers and parents who have been helping them through the dreary activities of Dick and Jane and other primer characters are due for a happy surprise." [...] Helen Adams Masten of the Saturday Review called the book Geisel's tour de force and wrote, [...] "Parents and teachers will bless Mr. Geisel for this amusing reader with its ridiculous and lively drawings, for their {{children are going to}} have the exciting experience <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> <b>that</b> they can read after all." [...] Polly Goodwin of the Chicago Sunday Tribune predicted that The Cat in the Hat would cause seven- and eight-year-olds to [...] "look with distinct distaste on the drab adventures of standard primer characters".|$|E
500|$|Warren and Alan Jones cite a {{scene where}} a {{character}} is killed in a public square as evoking the work of Alfred Hitchcock; Rostock agrees that the editing of the sequence is in a Hitchcockian vein, while the lighting is more influenced by Michelangelo Antonioni. The film critic and author Maitland McDonagh argues that Argento's influences for Tenebrae were far broader than just his own films or previous Italian thrillers. She refers to the strong narrative in the film {{as an example of}} [...] "the most paranoid excesses of film noir." [...] McDonagh suggests that Fritz Lang's Beyond a Reasonable Doubt (1956) ("in which a man convicted of murder on false evidence... is in fact guilty of the murder") and Roy William Neill's Black Angel (1946) ("in which a man who tries to clear a murder suspect does so at the cost <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> <b>that</b> he himself is the killer") both use such a similar plot twist to Tenebrae that Argento may have used them as partial models for his story.|$|E

In March 1945 {{she was given}} three months' leave from the shop to write it. [...] The Pursuit of Love is a heavily autobiographical romantic comedy [...] in which many of her family and acquaintances appear in thin disguises. Despite the distraction <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> <b>that</b> her brother Tom had died fighting in Burma, she finished the book and, in September, went to Paris. Ostensibly this was to establish a French branch of Heywood Hill but in reality she wished {{to be close to}} Palewski, who was now a member of de Gaulle's postwar provisional government. She was back in London in December 1945 for the publication of The Pursuit of Love which was, Hastings records, [...] "an instant and phenomenal success... the perfect antidote to the long war years of hardship and austerity, providing the undernourished public with its favourite ingredients: love, childhood and the English upper classes". The book sold 200,000 copies within a year of publication, and firmly established Mitford as a best-selling author.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the end of}} {{the sixth}} century Easterners {{remained}} a minority of the Roman clergy, although they were doubtlessly admitted into it (as determined by the names subscribing to synodical proceedings). [...] Although they constituted {{less than one percent of}} the hierarchy at the beginning of the seventh century, the percentage of Easterners was higher for the priesthood. In contrast, a 679 synod convoked by Agatho was predominantly eastern (more than half of the bishops and two-thirds of the priests). These monastics [...] "brought with them from the East an unbroken legacy <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> <b>that,</b> though shattered almost beyond recognition in the West, Byzantium had preserved in nearly pristine form from ancient times".|$|E
2500|$|Latent {{learning}} is a form <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> <b>that</b> is not immediately expressed in an overt response; it occurs without any obvious reinforcement of the behaviour or associations that are learned. One example in fish comes from research with male three spot gouramis (Trichopodus trichopterus). [...] This species quickly form dominance hierarchies. To appease dominants, subordinates adopt a typical body posture angled at 15-60º to the horizontal, all fins folded and pale body colors. Individuals trained to associate a light-stimulus with the imminent arrival of food exhibit this associative learning by approaching the surface where the food is normally dropped immediately the light-stimulus is presented. However, if a subordinate is placed in a tank with a dominant individual and the light-stimulus is presented, the subordinate immediately assumes the submissive posture rather than approaching the surface. The subordinate has predicted that going to the surface to get food would place it in competition with the dominant, and to avoid potential aggression, it immediately attempts to appease the dominant.|$|E
