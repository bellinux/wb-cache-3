5|$|Larger elasmobranchs, such as hammerhead sharks, prey on the bluespotted stingray. The rays {{coloration}} is {{a warning}} for the highly venomous barbs, thus few animals attempt to <b>overpower</b> this ray. The hammerhead shark uses its head to pin down the bluespotted stingray, while it is in shock and much weaker.|$|E
5|$|When the allele {{frequency}} is very small, drift can also <b>overpower</b> selection even in large populations. For example, while disadvantageous mutations are usually eliminated quickly in large populations, new advantageous mutations {{are almost as}} vulnerable to loss through genetic drift as are neutral mutations. Not until the {{allele frequency}} for the advantageous mutation reaches a certain threshold will genetic drift have no effect.|$|E

5|$|Aristotle's {{theory has}} some symmetry, as semen {{movements}} carry maleness while the menses carry femaleness. If the semen is {{hot enough to}} <b>overpower</b> the cold menses, the child will be a boy; {{but if it is}} too cold to do this, the child will be a girl. Inheritance is thus particulate (definitely one trait or another), as in Mendelian genetics, unlike the Hippocratic model which was continuous and blending.|$|E
5|$|Denny, a {{neighboring}} student whom Johnny financially and emotionally supports, has a run-in with an armed drug dealer named Chris-R, whom Johnny and Mark <b>overpower</b> and take into custody. Denny also lusts after Lisa, ultimately confessing to Johnny his attraction. Johnny slowly begins spiraling into a mental haze and calls upon Peter, his and Mark's psychologist friend. Peter alternates between defending Lisa and assessing {{her as a}} sociopath which results in Mark, feeling guilty about his and Lisa's affair, briefly trying to murder him.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his time}} in prison, A.I.M {{scientists}} converted Osborn into a Super-Adaptoid, capable of absorbing the abilities of any mutant, mutate, alien, android or other such super powered being by touching them. In this form he possessed considerably increased strength and durability; where he was once approximately as strong as Spider-Man, he now possessed sufficient strength to <b>overpower</b> and throw Luke Cage a significant distance away from him. He could also levitate, {{and he was able}} to defeat the Vision in an aerial conflict between the two.|$|E

5000|$|The games turn-based battle {{system is}} {{comparable}} to rock-paper-scissors -- [...] "Attack" [...] <b>overpowers</b> [...] "Break", Break <b>overpowers</b> [...] "Guard", and Guard <b>overpowers</b> Attack. During battle, both the player and the opponent line up six such moves {{at the beginning of}} each turn. Landing three successful hits allows use of an [...] "extra attack" [...] that cannot be countered. Most types of enemies have their own distinctive attack patterns, and memorizing these allows the player Servant to deal high amounts of damage while receiving minimal damage in return.|$|R

5|$|In 1860, the Al Khalifas {{used the}} same tactic when the British tried to <b>overpower</b> Bahrain. Writing letters to the Persians and Ottomans, Al Khalifas agreed to place Bahrain under the latter's {{protection}} in March due to offering better conditions. Eventually the Government of British India overpowered Bahrain when the Persians refused to protect it. Colonel Pelly signed a new treaty with Al Khalifas placing Bahrain under British rule and protection.|$|E
5|$|More {{specialized}} carnivores {{include the}} shrewlike rats of the Philippines, which feed on insects and soft-bodied invertebrates, and the Australian water rat, which devours aquatic insects, fish, crustaceans, mussels, snails, frogs, birds' eggs, and water birds. The grasshopper mouse from dry regions of North America feeds on insects, scorpions, {{and other small}} mice, and {{only a small part}} of its diet is plant material. It has a chunky body with short legs and tail, but is agile and can easily <b>overpower</b> prey as large as itself.|$|E
5|$|Archer {{requests}} {{the coordinates}} of Xindus, the Xindi homeworld, from Kessick. But the alien refuses to help unless Archer helps him escape. Archer declines, {{but he soon}} learns that the foreman had ulterior motives, since he has ordered three warships to <b>overpower</b> Enterprise and enslave his crew. Kessick claims {{to know how to}} escape the mine, but asks for Archer's help in return for guiding the Starfleet officers. Archer reluctantly agrees, and Kessick leads him and Tucker through the mine's sewage removal system. However, the group is soon detected in a conduit, and the foreman floods the system with plasma in an effort to kill them. They narrowly escape being killed, but quickly {{fall into the hands of}} the mine's security forces.|$|E

5|$|As Scully {{heads to}} the other room to get ready, her FBI badge falls out of her coat pocket. Scully discreetly picks it back up without Ed noticing. The tattoo begins to talk again, convincing Ed to redial Scully's last call to see who she was {{speaking}} to. An FBI operator answers and, upon learning that Scully is an FBI agent, the tattoo forces Ed to attack her. Scully tries to escape but is overpowered by Ed, who wraps her in a bedsheet and carries her {{down to the basement}} to throw her in the furnace. At the last moment, Ed is able to <b>overpower</b> the impulses of the tattoo and instead thrusts his own arm into the furnace.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of this {{influence}} plus their academic training from Rimsky-Korsakov, especially in the cases of Anton Arensky and Glazunov, these composers combined the best compositional techniques of The Five and Tchaikovsky in their music. Often, however, composers in this group fell back on two sources—musical clichés and mannerisms handed down from The Five, and academic compositional techniques learned at the Conservatory. Also, the eclecticism about which Rimsky-Korsakov wrote tended to <b>overpower</b> originality in many works, including those of Glazunov. Nevertheless, the Belyayev circle continued to influence the development of Russian music well into the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Black tells Bletcher about Richard Alan Hance (Jeremy Roberts), {{a serial}} killer Black had helped to {{apprehend}} twenty years before. Hance was a disturbed Vietnam War veteran who marked his kills with half a playing card, a custom he picked up during his tours of duty. Black {{was one of a}} number of Federal Bureau of Investigation agents who responded to an anonymous tip, leading them to Hance's location — however, the tip was called in by Hance himself and the raid became an ambush. Three agents were killed, and Black was cornered by Hance, who cut open his palm and nearly took Black's life before the young Black was able to <b>overpower</b> and arrest him.|$|E

5|$|Dredd {{suspects}} Ma-Ma {{is desperate}} to keep Kay quiet and beats him for information. Anderson reads Kay's mind and learns that Peach Trees is {{the centre of}} Slo-Mo production and distribution. Anderson suggests they hide while awaiting assistance, but Dredd insists they move up the tower and pursue Ma-Ma. Judges Volt and Guthrie respond to Dredd's call, but Ma-Ma's computer expert denies them entry by persuading them the security system is malfunctioning. A pair of armed teens confront Dredd and Anderson, allowing Kay to disarm and <b>overpower</b> Anderson. Kay then escapes with her as hostage, and takes her to Ma-Ma's base on the top floor.|$|E
5|$|Joshua Humphreys' {{design was}} long on keel and narrow of beam (width) {{to allow for}} {{mounting}} very heavy guns. The design incorporated a diagonal scantling (rib) scheme to limit hogging (warping); the ships were given extremely heavy planking. This gave the hull greater strength than those of more lightly built frigates. Humphreys developed his design after realizing that the fledgling United States Navy could not match the navies of the European states for size. He therefore designed his frigates {{to be able to}} <b>overpower</b> other frigates, but with the speed to escape from a ship of the line.|$|E

The design called for a diagonal scantling (rib) scheme intended to restrict hogging while giving the ships extremely heavy planking.

Humphreys' design was based on his realization that the fledgling United States of the period could not match the European states {{in the size of}} their navies.
