5|$|Willamette Law Review {{began in}} 1959, with four editions {{published}} each year. This general interest legal review also sponsors an annual symposium at the school. The first journal <b>on</b> <b>sports</b> {{law in the}} Pacific Northwest was the Willamette Sports Law Journal. The inaugural edition of the Willamette Environmental Law Journal was published in summer 2012.

5|$|Caracciola {{regained his}} German Grand Prix title at the Nürburgring at the 1928 German Grand Prix, driving the new 7.1-litre Mercedes-Benz SS. He shared the driving with Christian Werner, {{who took over}} Caracciola's car when the latter {{collapsed}} with heat exhaustion at a pit stop. The German Grand Prix, like many other races at the time, ignored the official Grand Prix racing rules set by the Association Internationale des Automobile Clubs Reconnus (International Association of Recognized Auto Clubs, or AIACR), which limited weight and fuel consumption, and instead ran races under a Formula Libre, or free formula. As a result, Mercedes-Benz focused less on producing Grand Prix cars and more <b>on</b> <b>sports</b> cars, and Caracciola drove the latest incarnation of this line, the SSK, at the Semmering hillclimb, and further reduced his own record on the course by half a second.|$|E

5|$|The four-overtime {{game was}} the longest in Big Ten Conference history. For their {{performance}} in the game, Athlon Sports named Hackenberg as both its Big Ten and National Freshman of the Week, and Olaniyan as its Big Ten Defensive Player of the Week. Hackenberg threw for over 300 yards for the third time, already moving him into a tie for third-most all time in Penn State history, tied with Daryll Clark, and behind Matt McGloin and Kerry Collins; {{it was the third}} time he had been named freshman of the week. Olaniyan recorded 2.5 sacks and forced a fumble (that was recovered by DaQuan Jones), and this was his first career Big Ten Player of the Week accolade. ESPN named the game the best of the season's first half, and Robinson's catch late in regulation was named the number-one play <b>on</b> <b>Sports</b> Center's Top Ten.|$|E
5|$|Following Brodie's departure, two strikers were signed; Leon Constantine joined on a {{contract}} {{until the end of}} the season after leaving Hereford United and youth-team coach Steve Torpey was registered as a player. Till and debutant Constantine scored in the space of two minutes in a 2–0 home win over Rushden & Diamonds. Striker David Dowson, defender Jamal Fyfield and midfielder Danny Racchi joined the club on trial and played for the reserve team against Chesterfield. Having fallen a goal behind, York earned a 1–1 draw away to Wrexham after Till scored the equalising goal. Ahead of York's home match against Hayes & Yeading United, the club signed Fyfield from Maidenhead United for a nominal fee and Racchi from Wrexham, where he had been on non-contract terms. The same day, York beat Hayes & Yeading 2–0 with goals from Rankine and Constantine, the latter making his first start for the club. York were defeated 5–0 away by Mansfield Town, with Jonathan Smith being sent off on 34 tminutes after receiving a second yellow card. Hopcutt and Lisles were loaned out to Stokesley of the Northern League Division One. Manager Foyle resigned 10 matches into the season, with the team 15th in the table, and assistant manager Andy Porter was appointed caretaker manager. Porter's first match in charge was a 3–1 away victory over Tamworth, York's first away win of the season, with goals scored from Rankine, Alex Lawless and debutant Fyfield. Ahead of this match, Dowson was signed and made his debut as an 85th-minute substitute. The first home match of Porter's tenure was a 0–0 draw with Darlington, which was York's first televised appearance <b>on</b> <b>sports</b> channel Premier Sports.|$|E
