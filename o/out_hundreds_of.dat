25|$|During {{the winter}} of 1995-1996, a series of large storms {{exacerbated}} the ongoing deterioration of the wood structure. The 100-mph winds blew out 30,000 fogged white glass panes in the conservatory, shattered the white glass dome, and weakened the structure. In addition, 15 percent of the plant collection was lost due to exposure to the cold, wintry air and flying glass. After covering the holes with tarp and plywood and bringing in heaters, the conservatory contemplated farming <b>out</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> plants to other institutions while the building was repaired. Some specimens however were too big or too old to move. The most challenging plant was the 112-year-old Brazilian philodendron that inhabited the shattered dome. A greenhouse was built to house the philodendron and other plants during renovation and afterwards used for expansion and keeping more exotic plants.|$|E

25|$|The second {{duty of the}} Council was {{to assist}} in Joseph Smith's 1844 {{campaign}} for President of the United States. Smith ran on a platform among church members of bringing restitution for land and property lost in Missouri, eliminating slavery, compensating slave-owners with the sale of private lands, reducing the salaries of members of Congress, eliminating debt imprisonment, etc. Members of the Council campaigned throughout the United States. Besides sending <b>out</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> political missionaries to campaign for Smith throughout the U.S., they also appointed fellow members of the Fifty as political ambassadors to Russia, the Republic of Texas, Washington D.C., England, and France. However, Smith was murdered by a large mob {{in the midst of}} his presidential campaign. The campaign was meant to draw greater attention to the plight of the Mormons, who had received no state or federal restitution for hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of property lost to mob violence in relation to the 1838 Mormon War. However, the Nauvoo Expositor incident, Smith's Presidential campaign, and even hyperbolic and inaccurate rumors about the Council of Fifty helped create the local unrest that led to his assassination.|$|E
500|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} July 1999, David Ownby {{writes that the}} country's media apparatus [...] "was churning <b>out</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> articles, books, and television reports against Falun Gong. The Chinese public had not witnessed such overkill since {{the heyday of the}} Cultural Revolution." [...] State propaganda initially used the appeal of scientific rationalism to argue that Falun Gong's worldview was in [...] "complete opposition to science" [...] and communism; the People's Daily asserted on 27 July 1999, that it [...] "was a struggle between theism and atheism, superstition and science, idealism and materialism." [...] Other rhetoric appearing in the state-run press centered on charges that Falun Gong had misled followers and was dangerous to health. To make the propaganda more accessible to the masses, the government published comic books, some of which compared Falun Gong’s founder to Lin Biao and Adolf Hitler.|$|E

Electric lighting was added to more rooms, along with central heating; telephone lines were installed, along with garages for the newly invented automobiles. The marathon was run from Windsor Castle at the 1908 Olympics, and in 1911 the pioneering aviator Thomas Sopwith landed an aircraft at the castle for the first time.|$|E

500|$|However, this aura of {{untouchability}} nearly {{came to an}} {{end when}} the cornermaster was himself cornered. Little particularly favored shorting the stocks of the Erie Railroad Company, and it was here that he was trapped by the cornering of the company's stock by a hostile syndicate of rival stockbrokers calling itself the [...] "Happy Family" [...] (in {{much the same way as}} he had done to countless other traders before). This led to a rather dramatic showdown between Little and the financiers involved. At the time, making good on a purchase promise required a transaction at the associated clerk's office, and on the day it was due the brokers gathered at the Erie Railroad Company clerk's office, smug at the likelihood that they had beaten Little at his own game. What the traders did not know was that Little had purchased convertible bonds at a company sale in London a few years before; Little entered the premises, apparently unrushed, carrying an oversize bag of what was revealed to be those very bonds, which Little had converted to stocks. To the astonishment of all, Little not only outplayed the syndicate but came <b>out</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> thousands of dollars ahead; such a maneuver was never attempted again.|$|E

Over 200homes were flooded and many bridges and roads washed in Pike County, with damage reaching $2million. Many residents were left isolated in eastern Kentucky after flooding destroyed bridges and roads. According to state disaster assessment teams, hundreds of residents in eastern Kentucky and West Virginia had flood damage to their houses. Due to the impact from flooding in eastern Kentucky, President George H. W. Bush declared Clay, Floyd, Jackson, Knott, Knox, Leslie, Letcher, Magoffin, Owsley, Perry and Pike counties as disaster areas.|$|E
500|$|In April, the Whigs {{used the}} House of Representatives {{for an attack}} on President Van Buren. Charles Ogle of Pennsylvania, a law student and {{political}} disciple of Thaddeus Stevens, utilized a debate on White House renovations to spend three days accusing Van Buren of living in luxury at considerable public expense, asking, [...] "If he is vain enough to spend his money in the purchase of rubies for his neck, diamond rings for his fingers, Brussels lace for his breast, filet gloves for his hands, and fabrique de broderies de bougram à Nancy handkerchiefs for his pocket—if he chooses to lay <b>out</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> dollars in supplying his toilet with 'Double Extract of Queen Victoria', Eau de Cologne, Corinthian Oil of Cream ... if, I say, Mr. Van Buren sees fit to spend his cash in buying these and other perfumes and cosmetics for his toilet, it can constitute no valid reason for charging the farmers, laborers and mechanics of this country with bills for HEMMING HIS DISH RAGS, FOR HIS LARDING NEEDLES, LIQUOR STANDS, AND FOREIGN CUT WINE COOLERS". Democrats called Ogle's address the [...] "Omnibus of Lies"; Whigs called it the [...] "Gold Spoons speech" [...] and reprinted it in large numbers, attempting to paint Van Buren, who was in fact of far more humble birth than Harrison, as an aristocratic dandy being challenged by {{a man of the}} people.|$|E

500|$|In {{his book}} The Meaning of Witchcraft (1959) Gardner {{states that he}} first heard the term Wica while being {{initiated}} into the New Forest coven in September 1939, stating that [...] "I realised I had stumbled on something interesting; but I was half-initiated before the word Wica which they used hit me like a thunderbolt, and I knew where I was, and that the Old Religion still existed." [...] This account was repeated in his biography, Gerald Gardner: Witch (1960), written by Idries Shah but attributed to Jack L. Bracelin, {{in which he is}} quoted as saying that [...] "it was halfway through when the word Wica was first mentioned; and I knew that that which I had thought burnt <b>out</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> years ago still survived." [...] If Gardner's account was accurate and the New Forest coven had really existed, then the fact that Gardner spelled the word as Wica would not necessarily indicate that the coven members had spelled it the same way. As he relates, from Gardner's account, [...] "it seems that he had heard rather than read the word {{in the midst of his}} initiatory rite" [...] and that, [...] "suffering from a poor grasp of spelling, punctuation, and grammar, something caused by the fact that he was self-educated and possibly also influenced by dyslexia", he would have therefore spelled the word phonetically as Wica.|$|E
