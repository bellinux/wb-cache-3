25|$|In Polish culture, the Rezurekcja (Resurrection Procession) is the joyous Easter morning Mass {{at daybreak}} when church bells ring out and explosions resound to commemorate Christ {{rising from the}} dead. Before the Mass begins at dawn, a festive {{procession}} with the Blessed Sacrament carried beneath a canopy encircles the church. As church bells ring out, handbells are vigorously shaken by altar boys, the air is filled with incense and the faithful raise their voices heavenward in a triumphant rendering of age-old Easter hymns. After the Blessed Sacrament is carried around the church and Adoration is complete, the Easter Mass begins. Another Polish Easter tradition is Święconka, the blessing of Easter baskets by the parish priest on Holy Saturday. This custom is celebrated not <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>Poland,</b> {{but also in the}} United States by Polish-Americans.|$|E
