25|$|Even {{with the}} {{majority}} in card points, declarer may still lose if the Game Value {{is lower than the}} value he bid during the auction. This is called “overbidding”. An <b>overbid</b> hand is automatically lost, leading to a negative score for declarer.|$|E
25|$|An <b>overbid</b> hand is {{scored by}} {{determining}} {{the lowest possible}} Game Value that is a multiple of the Base Value of declarer's suit (or 24 {{in case of a}} Grand) which is at least as high as declarer's bid. This value is then doubled and subtracted from declarer's score (negative score).|$|E

25|$|Any {{contestant}} who overbids is disqualified {{regardless of}} their opponent's result. A double <b>overbid</b> results in neither contestant winning a showcase. Since 1974, any contestant who comes within a specified amount from the actual retail price of their own showcase without going over wins both showcases. Until 1998, the amount was less than $100. In 1998, it became the current $250 or less.|$|E
25|$|Extrapolation is {{projecting}} {{historical data}} {{into the future}} on the same basis; if prices have risen at a certain rate in the past, {{they will continue to}} rise at that rate forever. The argument is that investors tend to extrapolate past extraordinary returns on investment of certain assets into the future, causing them to <b>overbid</b> those risky assets in order to attempt to continue to capture those same rates of return.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} for a player to <b>overbid,</b> which leads to an automatic loss {{of the game in}} question.

40|$|We {{find new}} equilibria of minimum-revenue core-selecting (MRCS) auctions that, in {{contrast}} to previously identified equilibria, involve <b>overbidding</b> - bidding more than one's true value for some packages of goods. With full information, every MRCS auction in every possible setting has equilibria with <b>overbidding</b> and these equilibria have different properties than the previously known equilibria with bid shading. Namely, they can lead to strictly higher revenues for the seller and larger price differences among bidders. Previous studies of MRCS games with incomplete information assumed restricted strategy spaces that prevented <b>overbidding.</b> In this paper, we allow bidders access to their complete strategy sets and show that, in some settings, <b>overbidding</b> occurs in all Bayesian equilibria in undominated strategies. In a simple setting with independent private values, equilibrium strategies of {{a particular set of}} MRCS auctions employ a mixture of bid shading and <b>overbidding.</b> These new equilibria improve expected effi ciency relative to equilibria with restricted strategy spaces and lead to higher expected revenues than those from the Vickrey package auction. A second incomplete-information setting demonstrates that equilibria with <b>overbidding</b> can be in some sense unique. In this setting, every Bayesian equilibrium in undominated strategies of every MRCS auction has at least one bidder who <b>overbids</b> and there is no bid shading on winning packages. <b>Overbidding</b> eliminates the threshold problem, leading to an effi cient assignment and payoffs that are in the core with respect to the true values...|$|R
25|$|Note that Game Value is {{dependent}} {{not only on}} the cards held (including the Skat) but also on which game is being declared and the outcome of the play. Each holding can thus be evaluated differently by different players. A risk-taking player might be willing to declare Hand on a holding on which another player might not — these two players will therefore give different valuations to the same holding. However, after all tricks have been played, it is always possible to determine the exact Game Value by combining the actual holding with the type of game and outcome of the play. Only then it becomes apparent if declarer has won or lost (if he <b>overbid).</b>|$|E

The 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike and original success in the Nielsen ratings led CBS to commission ten more episodes of the primetime series. This series introduced set changes as the show was broadcast in high definition television {{for the first time and}} the set used for these episodes (except for the black floor) was moved to the daytime show in 2008. On the primetime series, larger and more expensive prizes were generally offered than on the daytime show. The Showcase frequently offered multiple or very-expensive cars. In the first sixteen $1,000,000 Spectaculars all hosted by Barker, the payoff for landing on the $1.00 during a bonus spin in the Showcase Showdown was increased to $1 million. Beginning with the seventh special, if nobody had received a bonus spin in either Showcase Showdown, the winner of the Showcase received one bonus spin for a chance at $1 million. If both contestants <b>overbid,</b> an audience member was chosen at random to spin the wheel. This rule was later changed so that in the event of a double <b>overbid,</b> the contestant who <b>overbid</b> by the lower amount received the bonus spin for a chance at $1 million.|$|E

2500|$|Example: Declarer bid to 30, {{missing the}} two top trumps (without 2), {{intending}} to play a Club Suit game (Game Value would be 12x3=36). She then finds the ♣J in the Skat (with 1).

She will receive a negative score of -72 (36 is the lowest multiple of 12, the Base Value of Clubs, greater than the 30 she bid; 36 times two is 72). She can try to minimize her loss by declaring a game in Hearts instead of Clubs (Base Value 10 instead of 12).

2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the show, four contestants are called from the audience by the announcer to take a spot on the front row behind bidding podiums, which are embedded into the front edge of the stage. This area is known as [...] "Contestants' Row". The announcer shouts [...] "Come on down!" [...] after calling each selected contestant's name, a phrase which has become a trademark of the show. The four contestants in Contestants' Row compete in a bidding round to determine which contestant will play the next pricing game (the round is known as [...] "One Bid," [...] which gets its name and format from one of two types of bidding rounds that existed on the 1950s version of the show). A prize is shown and each contestant gives a single bid for the item. In the first One-Bid game of each episode, bidding begins with the contestant on the viewer's left-to-right. In subsequent One-Bid rounds, the order of bidding still moves from the viewer's left-to-right, but it begins with the contestant most recently called down. Contestants are instructed to bid in whole dollars since the retail price of the item is rounded to the nearest dollar and another contestant's bid cannot be duplicated. If a contestant thinks the others have <b>overbid,</b> he or she bids $1 on the item. The contestant whose bid is closest to the actual retail price of the prize without going over wins that prize and gets to play the subsequent pricing game. If all four contestants <b>overbid,</b> short buzzer tones sound, the lowest bid is announced and the bids are erased. The host then instructs the contestants to re-bid below the lowest previous bid. If a contestant bids the actual retail price, a bell rings and the contestant wins a cash bonus in addition to the prize. From the introduction of the bonus in 1977 until 1998, the [...] "perfect bid" [...] bonus was $100; it was permanently increased to the current $500 in 1998. On The Price Is Right $1,000,000 Spectacular, the bonus was $1,000. After each pricing game, another contestant is called to [...] "come on down" [...] to fill the spot of the contestant that won the previous round. The newest contestant bids first in each One Bid round. Contestants who fail to win a One Bid round—thus never making it onstage to play a pricing game—receive consolation prizes, currently $300, often sponsored by companies revealed by the announcer {{near the end of the}} show, before the Showcase.|$|E

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 23 - 24. <b>Overbidding</b> in first-price sealed-bid auctions is {{a well-known}} result in the auction theory literature. For the possible reasons behind this phenomenon, economists provided many explanations; such as risk aversion, regret theory, and subjective probability weighting. However, for subjective probability weighting to explain <b>overbidding,</b> the probability weighting function (PWF) is needed to be underweighting all probabilities. Such a function is not in accord with PWFs in the prospect theory literature as it suggests a specific function which satisfies certain properties. In this paper we investigate, to what extent prospect theory is able to explain <b>overbidding</b> by using a linear PWF satisfying all of the axiomatic properties (Currim and Sarin, 1989). Moreover, we introduce a non-zero reference point, fully utilizing prospect theory. Our results show that, subjective probability weighting alone is unable to explain <b>overbidding.</b> However, with the non-zero reference point assumption, we obtain partial <b>overbidding.</b> Keskin, KerimM.

40|$|We analyse bidding {{incentives}} of {{the main}} creditors (banks) in Swedish bankruptcy auctions. Lacking a direct mechanism for enforcing its seller reservation price, the bank offers financing to a potential bidder {{in return for a}} bid strategy that maximizes the expected profits of the bank-bidder coalition. The coalition <b>overbids</b> (in excess of the coalition's private valuation) by an amount that decreases during the bank's ‘liquidation recovery’. This is the recovery amount if the bank were to receive the piecemeal liquidation value announced by the auctioneer {{at the start of the}} auction. Since both the liquidation recovery and the final going-concern auction premium are observable, the <b>overbidding</b> theory is testable. We perform a large-sample, cross-sectional analysis where <b>overbidding</b> is pitched against asset fire-sale arguments. The latter hold that auctions tend to produce lower going-concern premiums when taking place during industry-wide financial distress, or when the firm is sold back to old owners or to industry outsiders.
