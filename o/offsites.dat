Interest in the UK in industrialisation and <b>offsite</b> has recently been increasing however, partly attributable to the increased demand for housing, and pressure by Government and industry to improve the performance of the UK construction industry, particularly its efficiency, quality, value and safety. This paper discusses the views of the UK construction industry on <b>offsite.</b> This work has been conducted by Loughborough University as part of a DTI and UK industry funded research programme on <b>offsite</b> technologies and prefabrication called prOSPa (promoting <b>OffSite</b> Production applications).

A preliminary survey was used to guide and inform the development of a main survey involving three different questionnaires in order to target the three main groups of stakeholders involved with <b>offsite</b> suppliers/manufacturers, contractors and designers/clients. More than 90 % of the respondents had used some type of <b>offsite</b> or prefabrication in at least one of their projects. Demand for <b>offsite</b> is clearly increasing in the UK and nearly three quarters of the suppliers surveyed thought that take-up of <b>offsite</b> by industry was increasing in their sector.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The continuous desire to improve health and safety in UK construction has in recent years been challenged to adopt <b>offsite</b> strategies {{in order to address}} the poor health and safety record of construction. Despite the benefits of using <b>offsite</b> there has been little research on the actual benefits and disadvantages of the effect of <b>offsite</b> on occupational health and safety. This is important given that the UK government has promoted the use of <b>offsite</b> to improve health and safety performance. This thesis provides a strategy for the management of <b>offsite</b> risk and a risk management tool has been developed. The study investigated <b>offsite</b> manufacturers views on <b>offsite</b> activities and risks in comparison with insitu activities and risks. This was achieved through three phases: phase I comprised two expert group interviews, phase II involved ergonomic audits and phase III consisted of three semi-structured interviews with three <b>offsite</b> manufacturers. The thesis identified that there are significant health and safety benefits of <b>offsite.</b> The benefits relate to specific activities within the <b>offsite</b> categories and context studied. Examples include the elimination of work at height, reduction in noise, reduction in work in confined space, reduction in congested work with trade overlap and greater control over work in the factory. The research revealed that there are still potential health and safety risks with <b>offsite.</b> Examples include; transportation and delivery of units of large size and weight with associated high consequence craneage and handling risks (unit fall and hand injury), whole body vibration, cuts, MSDs, RSIs, fumes and slips trips and falls. There appears to be little in the literature to support the identification of <b>offsite</b> risk issues. The study identified strategies to eliminate and reduce <b>offsite</b> residual risks. The case study investigated solutions to further reduce residual risks, which were further explored in phase III the semi-structured interviews. The solutions are grouped into four approaches: process change, workplace environment designing out risks, automation and the use of tools. An <b>offsite</b> risk management tool was developed which transfers knowledge from the study to provide awareness and management of <b>offsite</b> risk.

A primary Subproject objective is to gather adequate data to characterize the various Subproject sites through the collection of surface and subsurface soil samples and by drilling several wells for the collection of groundwater data. The Project Shoal Area (PSA) is one of the Subproject`s Nevada sites and is subject to the requirements set forth in the Federal Facility Compliance Agreement and Consent Order (FFACO) (DOE, 1996 a). In accordance with the FFACO, a Corrective Action Investigation Plan (CAIP) has been developed for work at the PSA (designated as Corrective Action Unit Number 416). This Fluid Management Plan (FMP) provides guidance for the management of fluids generated from wells constructed at the PSA. Long-term monitoring and future activities at the site, if required, will be set forth in additional documents as required by the FFACO. The ultimate method for disposition of fluids generated by site operations depends upon sample analysis and process knowledge in relation to fluid management criteria.

40|$|The thesis {{outlines}} {{a framework}} for rapid capital and operating cost estimation of evolving biorefineries. The cost models are addressed to the biorefinery community and aim to assist chemists in selecting economically viable biorefinery routes and engineers in avoiding laborious flowsheeting with uncertain economic analyses at process conception. The models assist in early-stage decision making for budget allocation in a portfolio of different projects and estimation of budget overrun risks. Biorefineries are society’s alternative to fossil-based production and aim to produce bio-fuels and chemicals {{from a wide variety}} of biomass sources by optimising production and resources use. The emerging field of integrated biorefineries offers an abundance of possible products, technologies and production routes. The systematic screening of capital expenditure of each biorefinery pathway still relies on cost heuristics regressed from petrochemical processes under the assumption they could be applied to biorefineries. The thesis studies several established cost methods on biorefinery processes and concludes that most require a high level of process detail not suitable at the early R&D stage and at times, they produce questionable results. A cost estimating methodological framework is proposed to develop short-cut cost models and cost estimates for biorefineries. The framework sets the basis for the systematic cost modelling and estimating of biorefineries and is reproducible and extendable to other process groups. To address the uncertainty around the term “early-stage estimation”, technology development levels are benchmarked against cost estimation standards: Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) 1 to 4 correspond to Class 5 cost estimates and Technology Readiness Level 5 corresponds to Class 4 cost estimates, each level requiring dedicated cost models within - 50 to + 100 % accuracy. Heuristic and reproducible cost models are developed for TRL 1 - 5 by mapping cost drivers from cost data inventories. The cost models produce probabilistic base estimates, i. e. point estimates that take into account the cost model’s uncertainty within 95 % certainty. The cost estimate is completed with uncertainty models that takes into account both statistical and technical challenges to produce a joint distribution of possible cost outcomes. The analysis is assisted by cost inventories that include commercial biorefinery costs gathered to that end. Three major biorefinery classes emerge from the data to classify biorefineries by type of employed technology: biochemical, chemical and thermochemical. Historical trends show that for the period 2000 – 2020, the US has been a pioneer in biorefineries construction (43 % of biorefineries), followed by France (9 %), Spain and Brazil (7 %), whereas bioethanol in the US and biodiesel in Europe dominate bio-production supported by favourable economic policies. At TRL 1, cost-capacity curves are developed for 11 biorefineries that allow estimation by power law relationships and statistical metrics to evaluate uncertainties within 95 % certainty range. New jobs vs capital cost curves are presented to estimate the social impact of future biorefineries in respect to job growth. The analysis shows that 1 st gen ethanol remains more cost-efficient than advanced biofuels, whereas synergies among existing plants can largely reduce capital costs. 2 nd gen ethanol biorefineries make the most positive impact by creating 1 new job per million euro invested. At TRL 2 - 3, biorefinery development is at a phase that allows application of the “Process Blocks Build-Up” estimating method; it is a modular approach which proposes probabilistic cost exponents and reference costs for segments found in 11 biorefinery types. The method addresses estimation of biorefineries beyond the state-of-the-art under the assumption that a new biorefinery is composed of blocks that resemble those found in state-of-the-art biorefineries. Differences in performance are accounted for with an efficiency factor for each block. Validation of the method shows it has an absolute average error of 27 %. At TRL 4, process development justifies a conceptual flow diagram and thus, the capital cost can be estimated from “Functional Unit” relationships, which postulate the capital cost as a function of the number of functional units and basic process parameters. The concept of the functional unit - established on petrochemical processes – is re-defined through examples to include unit operations commonly found in biorefineries. The percentage standard error of the estimate is used to model the 95 % certainty around the base estimate. Despite the advanced phase of development, the new correlations report an absolute average error of 50 %. The discrepancies are due to the uncertain and limited amount of data used in regression analysis. At TRL 5, installation factors (Lang factors) under uncertainty are proposed assuming the delivered equipment cost can be estimated. Factorial estimating is at the verge of early-estimating and reports an average absolute error of 12 %. The proposed installation factors (solid-fluid: 5. 9, fluid: 9. 5) are higher than the ones reported in common engineering handbooks, thus, confirming the research hypothesis that the <b>offsites</b> in biorefineries are capital intensive. The thesis introduces “Production cost estimating with uncertainty”, which assumes that the production cost elements can be expressed as a function of the raw materials, the utilities, the operating labour and the fixed capital investment and proposes modelling factors under uncertainty for each element. The cost models are validated across TRLs on two case studies; PHB from methane fermentation and FAME from in planta transesterification of castor seeds. The modular approach assists in estimating processes at low TRL based on little information and provides reasonable results. The short-cuts show good agreement with detailed techno-economic results from common engineering software (Aspen Process Economic Analyser). The cost models can be used interchangeably for rapid cost estimations and modelling work for various purposes...|$|E
