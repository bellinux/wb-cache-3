5|$|In March 2007, the FDA {{reported}} {{the results of}} a randomized, open-label, phase III clinical trial comparing linezolid to vancomycin in the treatment of catheter-related bloodstream infections. Patients treated with vancomycin could be switched to <b>oxacillin</b> or dicloxacillin if the bacteria that caused their infection was found to be susceptible, and patients in both groups (linezolid and vancomycin) could receive specific treatment against Gram-negative bacteria if necessary. The study itself was published in January 2009.|$|E
25|$|Additionally <b>oxacillin</b> {{susceptible}} Staphylococcus aureus native valve endocarditis of {{the right}} side can also be treated with a short 2 week course of a beta-lactam antibiotic like nafcillin with or without aminoglycosides.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{organism}} responsible for infective endocarditis is Staphylococcus aureus, which is resistant to penicillin in most cases. High rates {{of resistance to}} <b>oxacillin</b> are also seen, in which cases treatment with vancomycin is required.|$|E
25|$|Staphylococcal {{resistance}} to penicillin is mediated by penicillinase (a form of β-lactamase) production: an enzyme that cleaves the β-lactam {{ring of the}} penicillin molecule, rendering the antibiotic ineffective. Penicillinase-resistant β-lactam antibiotics, such as methicillin, nafcillin, <b>oxacillin,</b> cloxacillin, dicloxacillin, and flucloxacillin, are able to resist degradation by staphylococcal penicillinase.|$|E
500|$|Opinions vary as {{to which}} {{treatment}} options are most effective for septic prepatellar bursitis. McAfee and Smith recommend a course of oral antibiotics, usually <b>oxacillin</b> sodium or cephradine, and assert that surgery and drainage are unnecessary. Wilson-MacDonald argues that oral antibiotics are [...] "inadequate", and recommends intravenous antibiotics for managing the infection. Some authors suggest surgical irrigation of the bursa {{by means of a}} subcutaneous tube. Others suggest that bursectomy may be necessary for intractable cases; the operation is an outpatient procedure that can be performed in less than half an hour.|$|E
2500|$|OXA beta-lactamases {{were long}} {{recognized}} as a less common but also plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase variety that could hydrolyze <b>oxacillin</b> and related anti-staphylococcal penicillins. These beta-lactamases differ from the TEM and SHV enzymes in that they belong to molecular class D and functional group 2d [...] The OXA-type beta-lactamases confer resistance to ampicillin and cephalothin and are characterized by their high hydrolytic activity against <b>oxacillin</b> and cloxacillin {{and the fact that}} they are poorly inhibited by clavulanic acid. Amino acid substitutions in OXA enzymes can also give the ESBL phenotype. While most ESBLs have been found in E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and other Enterobacteriaceae, the OXA-type ESBLs have been found mainly in P. aeruginosa. OXA-type ESBLs have been found mainly in Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from Turkey and France. The OXA beta-lactamase family was originally created as a phenotypic rather than a genotypic group for a few beta-lactamases that had a specific hydrolysis profile. Therefore, there is as little as 20% sequence homology among some of the members of this family. However, recent additions to this family show some degree of homology to one or more of the existing members of the OXA beta-lactamase family. Some confer resistance predominantly to ceftazidime, but OXA-17 confers greater resistance to cefotaxime and cefepime than it does resistance to ceftazidime.|$|E
2500|$|Today, S. aureus {{has become}} {{resistant}} to many commonly used antibiotics. [...] In the UK, only 2% of all S. aureus isolates {{are sensitive to}} penicillin, with a similar picture {{in the rest of}} the world. The β-lactamase-resistant penicillins (methicillin, <b>oxacillin,</b> cloxacillin, and flucloxacillin) were developed to treat penicillin-resistant S. aureus, and are still used as first-line treatment. [...] Methicillin was the first antibiotic in this class to be used (it was introduced in 1959), but, only two years later, the first case of MRSA was reported in England.|$|E
2500|$|The {{treatment}} of choice for S. aureus infection is penicillin. An antibiotic derived from some Penicillium fungal species, penicillin inhibits the formation of peptidoglycan cross-linkages that provide the rigidity and strength in a bacterial cell wall. The four-membered β-lactam ring of penicillin is bound to enzyme DD-transpeptidase, an enzyme that when functional, cross-links chains of peptidoglycan that form bacterial cell walls. The binding of β-lactam to DD-transpeptidase inhibits the enzyme’s functionality and {{it can no longer}} catalyze the formation of the cross-links. As a result, cell wall formation and degradation are imbalanced, thus resulting in cell death. In most countries, however, penicillin resistance is extremely common, and first-line therapy is most commonly a penicillinase-resistant β-lactam antibiotic (for example, <b>oxacillin</b> or flucloxacillin, both of which have the same mechanism of action as penicillin). [...] Combination therapy with gentamicin may be used to treat serious infections, such as endocarditis, but its use is controversial because of the high risk of damage to the kidneys. [...] The duration of treatment depends on the site of infection and on severity.|$|E

5000|$|Many {{drugs are}} {{supplied}} as salts, with a cation and an anion. The way the INN system handles these {{is explained by}} the WHO at its [...] "Guidance on INN" [...] webpage. For example, amfetamine and <b>oxacillin</b> are INNs, whereas various salts of these compounds - e.g., amfetamine sulfate and <b>oxacillin</b> sodium - are modified INNs (INNM).|$|E
50|$|Nafcillin is {{considered}} therapeutically equivalent to <b>oxacillin,</b> although its safety profile is somewhat different.|$|E
50|$|<b>Oxacillin</b> sodium (trade name Bactocill) is a narrow-spectrum {{beta-lactam}} antibiotic of the penicillin class {{developed by}} Beecham.|$|E
50|$|U.S. {{clinical}} practice guidelines recommend either nafcillin or <b>oxacillin</b> as the first-line {{treatment of choice}} for staphylococcal endocarditis in patients without artificial heart valves.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Oxacillin</b> is a penicillinase-resistant β-lactam. It {{is similar}} to methicillin, and has {{replaced}} methicillin in clinical use. Other related compounds are nafcillin, cloxacillin, dicloxacillin, and flucloxacillin. Since it is resistant to penicillinase enzymes, such as that produced by Staphylococcus aureus, it is widely used clinically in the US to treat penicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. However, with the introduction and widespread use of both <b>oxacillin</b> and methicillin, antibiotic-resistant strains called methicillin-resistant and oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA/ORSA) have become increasingly prevalent worldwide. MRSA/ORSA is treated using vancomycin.|$|E
50|$|Meticillin is {{no longer}} {{manufactured}} because the more stable and similar penicillins such as <b>oxacillin</b> (used for clinical antimicrobial susceptibility testing), flucloxacillin, and dicloxacillin are used medically.|$|E

5000|$|... {{penicillin}} antibiotics such as amoxicillin (Amoxil, Augmentin), ampicillin (Omnipen, Principen), dicloxacillin (Dycill, Dynapen), <b>oxacillin</b> (Bactocill), or penicillin (Beepen-VK, Ledercillin VK, Pen-V, Pen-Vee K, Pfizerpen, V-Cillin K, Veetids, and others); or ...|$|E
5000|$|... {{the correct}} term is [...] "OXACILLINASE". These enzymes {{are able to}} {{inactivate}} the oxazolylpenicillins like <b>oxacillin,</b> cloxacillin, dicloxacillin. The enzymes belong to the molecular class D not molecular class A.|$|E

50|$|Another common {{laboratory}} test is a rapid {{latex agglutination test}} that detects the PBP2a protein. PBP2a is a variant penicillin-binding protein that imparts the ability of S. aureus to be resistant to <b>oxacillin.</b>|$|E
50|$|When ulcers develop {{secondary}} to the congenital disease, antibiotic treatment such as <b>oxacillin</b> and gentamicin administered for 10 days has been prescribed. In one study, the wound grew Escherichia coli while blood cultures were negative.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} {{organism}} responsible for infective endocarditis is Staphylococcus aureus, which is resistant to penicillin in most cases. High rates {{of resistance to}} <b>oxacillin</b> are also seen, in which cases treatment with vancomycin is required.|$|E
50|$|Another more {{efficient}} form {{of resistance to}} cefoxitin {{is provided by the}} mecA gene in bacteria. This gene codes for an alternative penicillin binding protein, PBP2a. This PBP has a lower binding affinity for penicillin-based antibiotics such as cefotxitin and will continue to cross-link the peptidoglycan layers of the cell wall even {{in the presence of the}} beta-lactam antibiotics. MRSA, or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is a strain that has acquired resistance to cefoxitin via this gene. For the purposes of detecting bacterial strains with the mecC gene, which like mecA codes for a different PBP, cefoxitin is more reliable than <b>oxacillin</b> because mecC does not correlate as strongly with <b>oxacillin</b> resistance.|$|E
50|$|However, some M. morganii strains are {{resistant}} to penicillin, ampicillin/sublactam, <b>oxacillin,</b> first-generation and second-generation cephalosporins, macrolides, lincosamides, fosfomycin, colistin, and polymyxin B. The emergence of highly resistant strains of M. morganii {{have been associated with}} use of third-generation cephalosporins.|$|E
50|$|Clinical drug-drug {{interactions}} with dalbavancin {{have not been}} studied, and dalbavancin {{does not appear to}} interact with cytochrome P450 substrates, inhibitors, or inducers. It was found to have an in vitro synergistic interaction with the antimicrobial <b>oxacillin,</b> but the clinical significance of this interaction has yet to be established.|$|E
5000|$|Daptomycin {{has been}} shown to be non-inferior to {{standard}} therapies (nafcillin, <b>oxacillin,</b> flucloxacillin or vancomycin) in the treatment of bacteraemia and right-sided endocarditis caused by S. aureus. [...] A study in Detroit, Michigan compared 53 patients treated for suspected MRSA skin or soft tissue infection with daptomycin against vancomycin, showing faster recovery (4 versus 7 days) with daptomycin.|$|E
50|$|Cefoxitin's {{spectrum}} of in vitro antimicrobial activity includes {{a broad range}} of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, including anaerobes. It is inactive against most strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and many strains of Enterobacter cloacae. Staphylococci that are resistant to methicillin and <b>oxacillin</b> should also be considered clinically resistant to cefoxitin even if they test susceptible by in vitro methods.|$|E
5000|$|Acid {{production}} from D-arabitol, sorbitol, turanose and xylitol is variable; the type strain is positive. It is resistant to novobiocin, bacitracin, vibriostatic agent O/129, lysozyme, metronidazole, and optochin. It {{is susceptible to}} lysostaphin, furazolidone, ampicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ceftiofur, cephalexin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, colistin sulphate, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, florfenicol, fosfomycin, fusidic acid, gentamicin, kanamycin, lincomycin, neomycin, nitrofurantoin, <b>oxacillin,</b> penicillin G, polymyxin B, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, tetracycline, and vancomycin.|$|E
50|$|E. faecalis is {{resistant}} to many commonly used antimicrobial agents (aminoglycosides, aztreonam, cephalosporins, clindamycin, the semisynthetic penicillins nafcillin and <b>oxacillin,</b> and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole). Resistance to vancomycin in E. faecalis {{is becoming more}} common. Treatment options for vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis include nitrofurantoin (in the case of uncomplicated UTIs), linezolid, and daptomycin, although ampicillin is preferred if the bacteria are susceptible.

50|$|The {{mainstay}} {{of treatment for}} SSSS is supportive care along with eradication of the primary infection. Conservative measures include rehydration, antipyretics (e.g., ibuprofen, aspirin, and paracetamol), management of thermal burns, and stabilization. Parenteral antibiotics to cover S. aureus should be administered. Most strains of S. aureus implicated in SSSS have penicillinases, and are therefore penicillin resistant. Therefore, treatment with Nafcillin, <b>oxacillin,</b> or vancomycin is typically indicated. Clindamycin is sometimes also used because of its inhibition of exotoxins.|$|E
