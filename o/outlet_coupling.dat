40|$|Nowadays, lots of {{catchments}} {{are affected}} by inundations or mudflows which are the consequences of excessive runoff and accelerated erosion. That generates also a significant loss of arable land. Yet, the soil resource is not an unlimited commodity. Moreover, sediments’ transfer to watercourses alters their physical and chemical quality. The watershed management should aim at both limiting erosion and enhancing deposition in appropriate zones. Therefore, the global objective of this work is to acquire hydropedological data {{in order to better}} quantify the erosion and deposition phenomenon in Belgium. The poster presents the field monitoring put in place in our experimental watershed. Indeed, observed quantitative data are essential but still limited. Particularly, we lack observations spatially distributed on the watershed. The watershed is a 124 ha agricultural zone in the loamy region. Its slopes range from 0 % to 9 %. Instrumentation includes a weather station with disdrometer, discharge measurement at the <b>outlet</b> <b>coupled</b> with water sampling. Fields observations are done to determine the texture redistribution and compared with a previous soil survey realised in 1958. Moreover, regular flights above the area will allow us to obtain a very accurate DEM using Lidar technology (5 cm pixel) and observing the relief evolution. The CAESAR model will be tested on this watershed. It aims at representing both erosion and sedimentation and estimates the net erosive flows. This model is based on the Einstein-Brown equations and needs an initial digital elevation model, hourly rainfalls, soil texture, etc. It produces a digital elevation models’ evolution through time.

50|$|The {{historical}} {{village of}} Swaythling is now extensively suburban in character {{with much of}} the area used for residential housing. High Road, which was the village's high street, has waned in popularity recently with several established businesses, such as Dunning's grocery store, having shut down. The popularity of the shopping area in neighbouring Portswood, out-of-town supermarket developments at Chandler's Ford and Hedge End, and the building of the Thomas Lewis Way bypass to the city centre are all possible causes of this demise. High Road today is dominated by take-away food <b>outlets</b> and a <b>couple</b> of newsagents.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{computational}} fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques {{have been used to}} investigate the effect of changes to the geometry of a vortex amplifier (VXA) in the context of glovebox operations in the nuclear industry. These investigations were required because of anomalous behavior identified when, for operational reasons, a long-established VXA design was reduced in scale. The study simulates the transient aspects of two effects: back-flow into the glovebox through the VXA supply ports, and the precessing vortex core in the amplifier outlet. A temporal convergence error study indicates that there is little to be gained from reducing the time step duration below 0. 1 ms. Based upon this criterion, the results of the simulation show that the percentage imbalance in the domain was well below the required figure of 1 %, and imbalances for momentum in all three axes were all below measurable values. Furthermore, there was no conclusive evidence of periodicity in the flow perturbations at the glovebox boundary, although good evidence of periodicity in the device itself and in the outlet pipe was seen. Under all conditions the modified geometry performed better than the control geometry with regard to aggregate reversed supply flow. The control geometry exhibited aggregate nonaxisymmetric supply port back-flow for almost all of the simulated period, unlike the alternative geometry for which the flow through the supply ports was positive, although still nonaxisymmetric, for most of the period. The simulations show how transient flow structures in the supply ports can cause flow to be reversed in individual ports, whereas aggregate flow through the device remains positive. Similar to the supply ports, flow through the outlet of the VXA under high swirl conditions is also nonaxisymmetric. A time-dependent reverse flow region was observed in both the outlet and the diffuser. It is possible that small vortices in the <b>outlet,</b> <b>coupled</b> with the larger vortex in the chamber, are responsible for the oscillations, which cause the shift in the axis of the precessing vortex core (and ultimately in the variations of mass flow in the individual supply ports). Field trials show that the modified geometry reduces the back-flow of oxygen into the glovebox by as much as 78 %. At purge rates of 0. 65 m 3 /h the modified geometry was found to be less effective, the rate of leakage from the VXA increasing by 16 – 20 %. Despite this reduced performance, leakage from the modified geometry was still 63 % less than the control geometry...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the transient aerothermal {{analysis of a}} gas turbine internal air system through an engine flight cycle featuring multiple fluid cavities that surround a HP turbine disk and the adjacent structures. Strongly coupled fluid-structure thermal interaction problems require significant computational effort to resolve nonlinearities on the interface for each time step. Simulation times may grow impractical if multiple fluid domains {{are included in the}} analysis. A new strategy is employed to decrease the cost of coupled aerothermal analysis. Significantly lower fluid domain solver invocation counts are demonstrated as opposed to the traditional coupling approach formulated on the estimates of heat transfer coefficient. Numerical results are presented using 2 D finite element conduction model combined with 2 D flow calculation in five separate cavities interconnected through the inlet and <b>outlet</b> boundaries. The <b>coupled</b> solutions are discussed and validated against a nominal stand-alone model. Relative performance of both coupling techniques is evaluated...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{effect of}} {{subsurface}} drainage on agricultural catchment outflow has been debated {{for quite some}} time. Concerning downstream peak flow, it is a complex task to predict the impact of agricultural drainage because different flow media are involved: the soil, pipe drainage networks and open channel networks. In France, drain pipes are designed to operate under a free-surface flow condition. Nevertheless, during intense rainfall events, some pipe sections may flow under pressurised conditions, so that a complex interaction between pipe networks and groundwater flows appears {{in the vicinity of}} these sections. In this paper, an integrated modelling strategy is considered in order to analyse these flow interactions. A 10 Saint-Venant network model is combined with a 2 D Boussinesq shallow groundwater flow model by means of special internal boundary conditions which take into account the flow interactions. This study follows field experiments conducted in a small subsurface drained catchment, where drainage discharge and pressure heads were monitored in a buried pipe collector and water table profiles were monitored in the field. The simulation results of the coupled model are in good agreement with experimental observations. Moreover, it satisfactorily simulates the behaviour of the drainage system during the pressurisation stages. The model is also applied to a scenario addressing the effect of pressurisation, as compared to non-pressurisation, at the <b>outlet.</b> The <b>coupled</b> model reveals the relation existing between pipe pressurisation and hydrograph timing. Pipe pressurisation results in temporary storage of discharging water, which is released later when pressurisation stops. (c) 2014 Published by Elsevier B. V...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{both the}} parallelisation {{of the original}} optimisation scheme {{and the use of}} genetic algorithms in place of this method. 1 INTRODUCTION Geographical Modellingand Planning (GMAP) Ltd have developed a computer model that simulates the pattern and volume of business that can be expected from a geographical network of sales or service <b>outlets.</b> When <b>coupled</b> with some optimisation scheme, this software can identify business resource planning solutions that provide maximum sales, profit or service results. Ford uses GMAP software [...] - an optimisation scheme called the Idealised Representation Plan (IRP) [10] [...] - to help to decide where to locate its car dealerships. The underlying spatial interaction model simulates car distribution and sales on the basis of information about the location of dealers and supply points, together with other geographic, demographic and statistical data. This allows prediction of the sales and flow patterns that result from a given configuration of dealerships. Running this software on a Sun SPARCstation 1 it would take around three months of computer time to find a network of 1000 Ford dealers covering the entire UK; thus the serial code has only ever been used to model one region of Britain at a time. In a collaborative project between GMAP Ltd and Edinburgh Parallel Computing Centre, the GMAP IRP code has been parallelised for the CM- 200. In addition, GA techniques have been studied as a replacement for the existing heuristic optimisation scheme. The major objectives of this work were: ffl To design and implement a parallel version of a spatial interaction model used by Ford UK to plan its sales delivery network. ffl To achieve a reduction in run-time by at least two orders of magnitude, via this parallel solution, in order t [...] ...|$|R

The ordained ministry is a highly stressful occupation. Serious church conflict has been increasing in frequency in congregations. Research of the effects of church conflict on clergy and their families is needed. The current study was designed to discover what the effects of church conflict are for clergy and their families. Five pastors, their spouses and one adult child were interviewed in the current study. Participants were interviewed to find the effects of church conflict on their mental, physical, and spiritual health. The participants were also asked about the effects of the conflict on their marriages, families, feelings about the church, and skills they developed to cope with the conflict. The study was a qualitative study {{of the effects of the}} conflict on the families. Emergent themes were identified within each case. A cross-case analysis compared the emergent themes between the cases and found similarities and differences between the themes. The themes were then categorized into integrated themes. The results of the study found that the church conflict had negative effects on the mental, physical, and spiritual health of the participants. The participants had developed PTSD. They also had physical health problems. New illnesses developed and pre-existing illness became worse. Spiritually, the conflict had little effect on the pastors' faith. The women all reported that they felt isolated from God. The findings showed that the church conflict also had affected the marriages, families, and relationships with the church. The marriages imploded; with no other <b>outlets,</b> the <b>couples</b> expressed their anger and frustration at the church at each other. The marriage systems reflected the church system. The effects of the conflict were like ripples in a pond, affecting relationships with the extended family. The effects of the conflict also affected the relationship with the church and denomination. All of the participants felt abused by the congregation and abandoned by the denomination. With little to no help from the denomination, the participants all found healthy ways to cope with the conflict outside the institutional church. The participants developed internal resources for coping, and found external helping professionals to provide them with the support they needed...|$|R
