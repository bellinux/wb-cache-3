5|$|Researchers are {{investigating}} the clinical significance of c-KIT mutations in AML. These are prevalent, and potentially clinically relevant because {{of the availability of}} tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib and sunitinib that can block the activity of c-KIT pharmacologically. It is expected that additional markers (e.g., RUNX1, ASXL1, and TP53) that have consistently been associated with an inferior <b>outcome</b> <b>will</b> soon be included in these recommendations. The prognostic importance of other mutated genes (e.g., DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2) is less clear.|$|E

25|$|A random {{variable}} {{is defined as}} a function that maps outcomes to numerical quantities (labels), typically real numbers. In this sense, it is a procedure for assigning a numerical quantity to each physical outcome, and, contrary to its name, this procedure itself is neither random nor variable. What is random is the unstable physics that describes how the coin lands, and the uncertainty of which <b>outcome</b> <b>will</b> actually be observed.|$|E
25|$|The {{fact that}} the {{relationship}} between income and health is concave indicates that a transfer of income from the rich to the poor would increase the average health of a society. However, this policy prescription will have this effect only if the relationship between income and health is causal– i.e. if higher income causes longer life expectancy (see below). If the relationship is driven by other factors, if it is spurious, or if it is in fact health that leads to higher income, then this policy <b>outcome</b> <b>will</b> no longer be true.|$|E

Rousseau later stated that the tiger was about to pounce on a group of explorers. Despite their apparent simplicity, Rousseau's jungle paintings were built up meticulously in layers, using a large number of green shades to capture the lush exuberance of the jungle. He also devised his own method for depicting the lashing rain by trailing strands of silver paint diagonally across the canvas, a technique inspired by the satin-like finishes of the paintings of William-Adolphe Bouguereau.|$|E

25|$|Roughly speaking, the theorem {{states that}} {{although}} there are many series of results that may be produced by a random process, the one actually produced is most probably from a loosely defined set of outcomes that all have approximately the same chance of being the one actually realized. (This is a consequence of the law of large numbers and ergodic theory.) Although there are individual outcomes which have a higher probability than any outcome in this set, the vast number of outcomes in the set almost guarantees that the <b>outcome</b> <b>will</b> come from the set. One way of intuitively understanding the property is through Cramér's large deviation theorem, which states that the probability of a large deviation from mean decays exponentially with the number of samples. Such results are studied in large deviations theory; intuitively, it is the large deviations that would violate equipartition, but these are unlikely.|$|E
25|$|Parasite ecology is complex, usually {{involving}} hosts {{that have}} multiple parasites (multi-parasite hosts), parasites that have multiple hosts (multi-host parasites), and competition within a host. These interactions affect parasite and host reproduction and therefore evolution, including of the virulence of parasites and of methods of transmission. Reviewing the field, T. Rigaud and colleagues noted in 2010 {{that among the}} outcomes demonstrated empirically are that multiple infection can affect virulence, and can trigger evolutionary change; that the parasites involved in the same host may have contrasting transmission modes; and that assemblages of multiple parasites can be more virulent than would be expected from each individual parasite. Rigaud and colleagues also consider trade-offs of virulence among hosts (that adaptation for higher virulence in one host means lower virulence in others), predicting that when there are many hosts, the <b>outcome</b> <b>will</b> be non-specialist parasites with relatively low virulence. Where hosts differ in quality, Rigaud and colleagues predict that parasites should become optimally virulent in their primary host. On the other hand, they also predict that the more diverse the host community, the lower the incidence of parasites should be, because infecting hosts that are unsuitable or resistant means the loss of those parasites (wasted transmission).|$|E
