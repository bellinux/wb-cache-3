50|$|Boeing and Pratt & Whitney worked {{together}} in 1969 {{to solve the}} problem. The trouble was traced to <b>ovalization,</b> in which stresses during takeoff caused the engine casing to deform into an oval shape and cause the high-pressure turbine blades to grind against the sides.

In 1974, as {{his senior year}} in High School approached Ritchey had already built approximately 200 frames. It was around this time he honed his fillet brazing or “lugless” method of fabricating frames. Ritchey sought to challenge bicycle industry standards of frame tubing diameter at the time limited {{by the use of}} fixed dimensioned lugs. Ritchey’s fillet brazing construction method allowed choice of larger thin-wall tubing diameters and unique <b>ovalizations</b> to create lighter -stiffer frames. By 1979, Ritchey had produced over 1,000 frames on his own.|$|R
40|$|Rupture of {{the pipe}} wall and {{inadmissible}} deformations are the two basic failure modes that can he distinguished in pipelines. Rupture can {{be the result of}} (a) the fact that the experienced strains exceed the strain capacity {{of the pipe}} wall, including less ductile zones in and near the weids and (b) high cycle and/or low cycle fatigue loading. Examples of inadmissible deformations are collapse, local buckles and excessive <b>ovalizations.</b> Deformations caused hy external loads like earth pressure and imposed hending in settlement areas do not affect the burst pressure (failure mode rupture), provided that the pipe wall has sufficient strain capacity. If the strains in local buckles do not exceed the strain capacity, then local buckles do not affect the hurst pressure either. The paper summarizes the theory to support this. Burst test results on pipes with external loads and with local buckles are presented. These tests have demonstrated that if ductility is good, even extremely deep huckles do not affect hurst pressure. Results of finite element calculations to simulate the kending and local huckling hehaviour are presented as well. The consequences of the above findings for the limit state design method are brietly discusse...|$|R
5000|$|The {{engine thrust}} acts along the engine centreline. The {{aircraft}} [...] "holds" [...] the engine {{on the outer}} casing of the engine at {{some distance from the}} engine centreline (at the engine mounts). This arrangement causes the engine casing to bend (known as backbone bending) and the round rotor casings to distort (<b>ovalization).</b> Distortion of the engine structure has to be controlled with suitable mount locations to maintain acceptable rotor and seal clearances and prevent rubbing. A well-publicized example of excessive structural deformation occurred with the original Pratt & Whitney JT9D engine installation in the Boeing 747 aircraft. The engine mounting arrangement had to be revised with the addition of an extra thrust frame to reduce the casing deflections to an acceptable amount.|$|E
5000|$|Rotary draw bending (RDB) is {{a precise}} technology, since it bends using tooling or [...] "die sets" [...] {{which have a}} {{constant}} center line radius (CLR), alternatively indicated as Mean Bending Radius (Rm). Rotary draw benders can be programmable to store multiple bend jobs {{with varying degrees of}} bending. Often a positioning index table (IDX) is attached to the bender allowing the operator to reproduce complex bends which can have multiple bends and differing planes.Rotary draw benders are the most popular machines for use in bending tube, pipe and solids for applications like: handrails, frames, motor vehicle roll cages, handles, lines and much more. Rotary draw benders create aesthetically pleasing bends when the right tooling is matched to the application.CNC rotary draw bending machines can be very complex and use sophisticated tooling to produce severe bends with high quality requirements.The complete tooling is required only for high-precision bending of difficult-to-bend tubes with relatively large OD/t (diameter/thickness) ratio and relatively small ratio between the mean bending radius Rm and OD. The use of axial boosting either on the tube free end or on the pressure die is useful to prevent excessive thinning and collapse of the extrados of the tube. The mandrel, with or without ball with spherical links, is mostly used to prevent wrinkles and <b>ovalization.</b> For relatively easy bending processes (that is, as the difficulty factor BF decreases), the tooling can be progressively simplified, eliminating the need for the axial assist, the mandrel, and the wiper die (which mostly prevents wrinkling). Furthermore, in some particular cases, the standard tooling must be modified in order to meet specific requirements of the products.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Ovalization</b> of {{tubes in}} cold bending {{operations}} causes dimensional inaccuracy {{that may lead}} to loss of fit-up and function of formed products. This distortion mechanism is governed by radial bending stress components forcing the extremities of the tube section towards the neutral layer. Thus, the magnitude of distortions is restricted by the instantaneous stiffness of the tube section upon bending. In order to consider tube <b>ovalization</b> in the product design process, it is necessary to develop a practical methodology that takes into account the impact of parameters such as material, tool and section geometries. The present work presents an analytical solution of the <b>ovalization</b> problem, using the deformation theory of plasticity. The results show that the diameter of the tube is the most important parameter, while the thickness of the tube section and the bending radius are of the same relative importance to <b>ovalization.</b> The developed model indicates that strain hardening is the most important material parameter, whereas tube <b>ovalization</b> is nearly unaffected by the initial yield stress. The model shows good correlation with experiments...|$|E

Within {{the range of the}} series of tests conducted, the increase in <b>ovalization</b> due to a compression load in combination with a bending load was very small. The bending load, being the principal factor in producing the <b>ovalization,</b> is a rather complex function of the bending moment, d/t ratio, cantilever length, and distance between opposite bearing faces.

40|$|The present paper {{examines}} instabilities of long thin elastic tubes. Both initially {{straight and}} initially bent tubes are analyzed under in-plane bending. Tube response, {{a combination of}} <b>ovalization</b> instability and bifurcation instability (buckling), is investigated using a nonlinear finite element (FE) technique, which employs polynomial functions in the longitudinal tube direction and trigonometric functions to describe cross-sectional deformation. It is demonstrated that {{the interaction between the}} two instability modes depends on the value and the sign of the initial tube curvature. The <b>ovalization</b> of initially bent tubes is examined in detail and, in particular, the case of opening moments. Furthermore, the paper emphasizes on bifurcation instability. It is shown that buckling may occur prior to or beyond the <b>ovalization</b> limit point, depending on the value of the initial curvature. Using the nonlinear FE formulation, the location of bifurcation on the primary path is detected, post-buckling equilibrium paths are traced, and the corresponding wavelengths of the buckled configurations are calculated. Moreover, results over a wide range of initial curvature values are presented, extending the findings of previous works. Finally, several analytical approaches, introduced in previous research works, are also employed to estimate the moments causing <b>ovalization</b> and bifurcation instability. These approaches are based on nonlinear flexible shell theory or simplified ring analysis. The efficiency and accuracy of those analytical methods with respect to the nonlinear FE formulation are examined. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The present paper investigates {{structural}} response and buckling of long unstiffened thin-walled cylindrical steel shells, subjected to bending moments, with {{particular emphasis on}} stability design. The cylinder response is characterized by cross-sectional <b>ovalization,</b> followed by buckling (bifurcation instability), which occurs on the compression side of the cylinder wall. Using a nonlinear finite element technique, the bifurcation moment is calculated, the post-buckling response is determined, and the imperfection sensitivity {{with respect to the}} governing buckling mode is examined. The results show that the buckling moment capacity is affected by cross-sectional <b>ovalization.</b> It is also shown that buckling of bent elastic long cylinders can be described quite accurately through a simple analytical model that considers the ovalized prebuckling configuration and results in very useful closed-form expressions.

40|$|When a {{straight}} hollow tube having circular cross-section is bent uniformly into an arc, the cross-section tends to ovalize or flatten {{due to the}} in-plane stresses induced by bending; this <b>ovalization</b> phenomenon is called the Brazier effect. The present paper is aimed at theoretical formulation of the Brazier effect observed in multilayered cylinders, in which a set of thin hollow cylinders are stacked concentrically about the common axis. The results indicate that mechanical couplings between stacked cylinders are found to yield pronounced suppression of the cross-sectional <b>ovalization.</b> Numerical computations have been performed to measure the degree of suppression in a quantitative manner and to explore how it {{is affected by the}} variations in the bending curvature, the number of stacked cylinders, and the interlayer coupling strength...|$|E

Two main issues are studied through the numerical tests: (1) The {{effect of the}} element size {{and the number of}} <b>ovalization</b> modes chosen for computation; (2) The accuracy of computed deformation and stresses. To gain an insight into the behavior of these elements, a comparison against published results by experiment and computations using elbow {{elements in}} software ADINA and MARC, as well as computations using ABAQUS shell elements, is conducted. It is shown that: (i) these elements predict a good peak stress solution with a reasonably coarse mesh and 6 <b>ovalization</b> modes; (ii) the <b>ovalization</b> and the distribution of stresses predicted around the pipe section show, though using a relatively dense mesh, a notable difference as compared to solutions computed by ABAQUS shell elements; (iii) the ADINA elbow element seems to provide, though using a very coarse mesh, a solution closest to analytic and experimental results.

The extent of <b>ovalization</b> and the frequency of overlap of the two tunnel apertures were compared. Methods: The simulation of femoral tunnel drilling with the TT and the trans-AMP techniques was performed using three-dimensional computer aided design models from two volunteers. The incidence angle of drilling against the intercondylar wall, the femoral tunnel position, the <b>ovalization,</b> and the overlap were analyzed. The aperture and location of the tunnels were also examined in real anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction cases (n= 36). Results: The surgical simulation showed that a lower drill incident angle induced by the TT technique made the apertures of two tunnels more ovalized, located anteromedial tunnels in a shallower position to prevent posterior wall blow out, and led to a higher frequency of tunnel overlap. The trans-AMP group had tunnel places within the footprint and had less <b>ovalization</b> and overlap. The results of analysis for tunnels in the clinical cases were consistent with results from the surgical simulation. Conclusion: In the TT technique, the shallow anteromedial tunnel location and more ovalized tunnel aperture can lead to a higher frequency of tunnel overlap. Compared with the TT technique, the trans-AMP technique was more useful in preparing femoral tunnels anatomically and avoiding tunnel <b>ovalization</b> and overlapping in double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.

The tube bending machine and curvature-ovalization measurement apparatus, which was designed by Pan et al. [1], were used for conducting the curvature-controlled cyclic bending.

40|$|There was {{interest}} {{in understanding the}} impact of out-of-round nozzle extension on the nozzle side load during transient startup operations. The out-of-round nozzle extension could {{be the result of}} asymmetric internal stresses, deformation induced by previous tests, and asymmetric loads induced by hardware attached to the nozzle. The objective of this study was therefore to computationally investigate the effect of out-of-round nozzle extension on the nozzle side loads during an engine startup transient. The rocket engine studied encompasses a regeneratively cooled chamber and nozzle, along with a film cooled nozzle extension. The computational methodology is based on an unstructured-grid, pressure-based computational fluid dynamics formulation, and transient inlet boundary flow properties derived from an engine system simulation. Six three-dimensional cases were performed with the out-of-roundness achieved by three different degrees of <b>ovalization,</b> elongated on lateral y and z axes: one slightly out-of-round, one more out-of-round, and one significantly out-of-round. The results show that the separation line jump was the primary source of the peak side loads. Comparing to the peak side load of the perfectly round nozzle, the peak side loads increased for the slightly and more ovalized nozzle extensions, and either increased or decreased for the two significantly ovalized nozzle extensions. A theory based on the counteraction of the flow destabilizing effect of an exacerbated asymmetrical flow caused by a lower degree of <b>ovalization,</b> and the flow stabilizing effect of a more symmetrical flow, created also by <b>ovalization,</b> is presented to explain the observations obtained in this effort...|$|E

Full-scale studies of buried pipes are expensive and time consuming. Finite element analysis, numerical and analytical studies have uncertainties due to generalized assumptions. Three test programs were carried out at the C-CORE Geotechnical Centrifuge Center {{in an attempt to}} validate the centrifuge as an effective tool to model the mechanical response of buried pipes to surface loads. In the first program, twenty four surface loading tests were carried out on an aluminum model pipe in the centrifuge. The second program included three tests at full-scale, varying the soil cover on a steel pipe. For direct comparison to the full-scale tests, a third program consisted of applying surface loads to six model steel pipes in the centrifuge. In a test bed of silica sand, cover depths, internal pressures, soil density and loading position were among the parameters varied. The model and full-scale pipes were instrumented with strain gages and <b>ovalization</b> transducers. Comparisons of the test data from each program validate the centrifuge as an effective and accurate tool to study the response of a buried pipe to surface loading. The test program also highlighted several common characteristics of the pipe response. The main modes of pipe deformation identified under surface loading were <b>ovalization</b> of the pipe cross-section and bending in the long section. The <b>ovalization</b> mode was not associated with the traditional elliptical pipe shape, but was characterized by the pipe crown deflecting significantly with smaller deformations of the pipe haunch.

40|$|The present paper {{examines}} the structural behavior of elongated steel hollow cylinders, {{referred to as}} tubes or pipes, subjected to large cyclic bending, through a rigorous finite element simulation. The bent cylinders exhibit cross-sectional distortion, {{in the form of}} <b>ovalization,</b> combined with excessive plastic deformations. Those deformations grow under repeated loading and may lead to structural instability in the form of local buckling (wrinkling) and, eventually, failure of the loaded member. The study focuses on relatively thick-walled seamless cylindrical members made of high-strength steel, which exhibit local buckling in the plastic range of the steel material. The analysis is conducted using advanced nonlinear finite element models capable of describing both geometrical and material nonlinearities. A cyclic plasticity model that adopts the "bounding surface" concept is employed.

40|$|Abstract This {{paper is}} aimed at {{assessing}} the nonlinear elastic response of an inflatable cylindrical beam through a simple mechanical model recently proposed by the authors for studying the equilibrium configurations of highly pressurised elastic membranes with general shapes. The {{attention is focused on}} beams loaded at mid-span with two different constraints, corresponding to simply-supported ends and built-in ends. The geometrical nonlinearities due to both the cross-sectional <b>ovalization</b> and wrinkling are carefully considered. In particular, the wrinkling of the membrane, clearly visible for load values much lower than the collapse load, is taken into account by means of an equivalent physical non-linearity. A two-states constitutive law for the material is assumed: when a fibre is stretched (the active state), its response is elastic, while when the fibre is contracted, no compressive force can be engendered in it (the passive state). The evolution of the cross-sectional <b>ovalization,</b> the size of the wrinkled regions and the magnitude of longitudinal and transverse stresses in the membrane are accurately determined for increasing levels of loads, up to collapse. The numerical results for the corresponding values of load and internal pressure, obtained through an expressly developed incremental-iterative algorithm, are compared with the experimental ones available in the literature...|$|E

Patients and methods: Six representative eyes are presented that show different scenarios in which higher-order aberrations interacting with corneal astigmatism {{can affect the}} manifest refraction. WaveLight® Contoura ablation maps showing the higher-order aberrations are shown, as are results of correction with full measured correction using the LYRA (Layer Yolked Reduction of Astigmatism) Protocol. Results: Higher-order corneal aberrations such as trefoil, quadrafoil, and coma can create <b>ovalization</b> of the central cornea, which can interact with the <b>ovalization</b> caused by lower-order astigmatism to either induce, cancel out, or modify the manifest refraction. Contoura processing successfully determines the linkage of these interactions resulting in full astigmatism removal. Purely lenticular astigmatism appears to be rare, but a case is also demonstrated. The author theorizes that all aberrations require cerebral compensatory processing and can be removed, supported by the facts that full removal of aberrations and its linkage with lower-order astigmatism with the LYRA Protocol has not resulted in worse or unacceptable vision for any patients. Conclusion: Higher-order aberrations interacting with lower-order astigmatism {{is the main reason}} for the differences between manifest refraction and Contoura measured astigmatism, and the linkage between these interactions can be successfully treated using Contoura and the LYRA Protocol.

Given the diversity of CNTs from various chiralities, diameters, and arrangements, pressureinduced CNT polymerization provides a prom ising approach to produce numerous novel metastable carbons exhibiting unique electronic, optical, and mechanical characteristics.
