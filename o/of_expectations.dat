40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{investigate}} the sampling distribution and usefulness <b>of</b> <b>expectation</b> <b>of</b> life in comparisons of mortality at health district level or below.  DESIGN—Derivation of {{a formula for}} the variance <b>of</b> the <b>expectation</b> <b>of</b> life, confirmation of the result and generation of the sampling distribution by Monte Carlo simulation; comparison <b>of</b> <b>expectation</b> <b>of</b> life with standardised mortality ratio (SMR) and other summary indices of mortality.  SETTING—A health district in Trent Region, England.  SUBJECTS—Routinely available mortality statistics at electoral ward level and above.  MAIN RESULTS—Given reasonable and simple assumptions the sampling distribution <b>of</b> the <b>expectation</b> <b>of</b> life is approximately normal. <b>Expectation</b> <b>of</b> life shows a high negative correlation with SMR even if the oldest age band for the SMR is open ended.  CONCLUSIONS—Where sampling error is an issue, inference concerning differences in mortality rates between populations can be based on <b>expectation</b> <b>of</b> life, which is better for illustrative purposes than SMR. The formula for the variance <b>of</b> the <b>expectation</b> <b>of</b> life is more complex however.

40|$|International audienceThis {{paper offers}} {{an account of}} recent {{developments}} of Austrian Trade Cycle Theory. It focus on the theoretical contributions and argues that the Austrian Trade Cycle Theory became a theory of error cycles. Austrian economists agree to explain the errors of individuals by the nationalization of money because it leads an excess of money supply. Nevertheless, they disagree {{about the causes of}} this excess. Two explanations have been suggested. The first one measures the excess in relation with the demand of money. The second one evaluates the excess in relation with monetary saving. They agree, on the contrary, on the reasons of the recurrence <b>of</b> <b>expectation</b> errors and their uniformity. The theory of property rights explains the recurrence <b>of</b> <b>expectation</b> errors by the socialization of risk. The theory <b>of</b> cognitive <b>expectations</b> explains the collective errors by the centralisation <b>of</b> <b>expectation</b> process around (big player hypothesis) decisions of central banks.
