25|$|There is {{a debate}} around the {{distinction}} between private equity and foreign direct investment (FDI), and whether to treat them separately. The difference is blurred on account of private equity not entering the country through the stock market. Private equity generally flows to unlisted firms and to firms where the percentage of shares is smaller than the promoter- or investor-held shares (also known as free-floating shares). The main point of contention is that FDI is used solely for production, whereas {{in the case of}} private equity the investor can reclaim their money after a revaluation period and make investments in <b>other</b> <b>financial</b> <b>assets.</b> At present, most countries report private equity as a part of FDI.|$|E

50|$|The assets {{demand for}} money is {{inversely}} related to the market interest rate. This is because at lower interest rate, more people will expect a rise in interest rate (and thus a fall in aftermarket bond prices). As a result, more people will hold their wealth in money rather than bonds, i.e. the speculative balances will be greater at a lower interest rate. It also depends on investors' aversion to risk, the relative demand for and the supply of <b>other</b> <b>financial</b> <b>assets</b> and real assets, and the change in expectations of the economic climate.|$|E

The halt of short-selling in the US was set to expire on October 2, but was extended until it expired at 11:59PM EDT on October 8. The action was based on the view that short selling in a crisis market undermines confidence in financial institutions and erodes their stability.|$|R
