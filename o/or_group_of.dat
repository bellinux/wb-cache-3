5|$|In {{international}} politics, {{food power}} {{is the use of}} agriculture as a means of political control whereby one nation <b>or</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> nations offers or withholds commodities from another nation <b>or</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> nations in order to manipulate behavior. Its potential use as a weapon was recognised after OPEC’s earlier use of oil as a political weapon. Food has a major influence on political actions of a nation. In response to acts of food power, a nation usually acts in the interest of its citizens to provide food.|$|E

5|$|Until {{the late}} 1930s {{electricity}} was supplied by municipal undertakings. These were small power companies that built power stations {{dedicated to a}} single industry <b>or</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> factories, and sold any excess electricity to the public. These companies used widely differing standards of voltage and frequency. In 1925 Parliament decided that the power grid should be a single system with uniform standards and under public ownership. Several of the private power companies reacted to the proposal by forming the London Power Company. They planned to heed parliament's recommendations and build {{a small number of}} very large stations.|$|E
5|$|Ælfhelm (died 1006) was the ealdorman of Northumbria, in {{practice}} southern Northumbria (the area around York), from about 994 until his death.

5|$|Although Australia {{does not}} have any nuclear power reactors, Pangea Resources {{considered}} siting an international repository in the outback of South Australia or Western Australia in 1998, but this stimulated legislative opposition in both states and the Australian national Senate during the following year. Thereafter, Pangea ceased operations in Australia but reemerged as Pangea International Association, and in 2002 evolved into the Association for Regional and International Underground Storage with support from Belgium, Bulgaria, Hungary, Japan and Switzerland. A general concept for an international repository has been advanced by one of the principals in all three ventures. Russia has expressed interest in serving as a repository for other countries, but does not envision sponsorship or control by an international body <b>or</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> other countries. South Africa, Argentina and western China have also been mentioned as possible locations.|$|E

5|$|Before the Normans arrived, Anglo-Saxon {{governmental}} {{systems were}} {{more sophisticated than}} their counterparts in Normandy. All of England was divided into administrative units called shires, with subdivisions; the royal court was the centre of government, and a justice system based on local and regional tribunals existed to secure the rights of free men. Shires were run by officials known as shire reeves or sheriffs. Most medieval governments were always on the move, holding court wherever the weather and food or other matters were best at the moment; England had a permanent treasury at Winchester before William's conquest. One major reason for the strength of the English monarchy was the wealth of the kingdom, built on the English system of taxation that included a land tax, or the geld. English coinage was also superior to most of the other currency in use in northwestern Europe, and the ability to mint coins was a royal monopoly. The English kings had also developed the system of issuing writs to their officials, in addition to the normal medieval practice of issuing charters. Writs were either instructions to an official <b>or</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> officials, or notifications of royal actions such as appointments to office or a grant of some sort.|$|E

There {{is known to be}} a Military Intelligence branch - Service du Renseignement militaire (SRM), the former DEMIAP. The FARDC is known to be broken up into the Land Forces (Forces Terrestres), Navy and Air Force. The Land Forces are distributed around ten military regions, up from the previous eight, following the ten provinces of the country. There is also a training command, the Groupement des Écoles Supérieurs Militaires (GESM) <b>or</b> <b>Group</b> <b>of</b> Higher Military Schools, which, in January 2010, was under the command of Major General Marcellin Lukama. The Navy and Air Forces are composed of various groupments (see below). There is also a central logistics base.|$|E
5|$|During the Principate, {{it appears}} that most recruits, both legionary and auxiliary, were volunteers (voluntarii). Compulsory {{conscription}} (dilectus) was never wholly abandoned, but was generally only used in emergencies or before major campaigns when large numbers of additional troops were required. In marked contrast, the late army relied mainly on compulsion for its recruitment of Roman citizens. Firstly, the sons of serving soldiers or veterans were {{required by law to}} enlist. Secondly, a regular annual levy was held based on the indictio (land tax assessment). Depending on the amount of land tax due on his estates, a landowner (<b>or</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> landowners) would be required to provide a commensurate number of recruits to the army. Naturally, landowners had a strong incentive to keep their best young men to work on their estates, sending the less fit or reliable for military service. There is also evidence that they tried to cheat the draft by offering the sons of soldiers (who were liable to serve anyway) and vagrants (vagi) to fulfil their quota.|$|E
5|$|Earthsea {{itself is}} an {{archipelago}} <b>or</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> islands. In the fictional {{history of this}} world, the islands were raised from the ocean by Segoy, an ancient deity or hero. The world is inhabited by both humans and dragons, and several among the humans are sorcerers or wizards. The world is shown as being based on a delicate balance, which most of its inhabitants are aware of, but which is disrupted by somebody {{in each of the}} original trilogy of novels. The setting of Earthsea is preindustrial, and has many cultures within the widespread archipelago. Most of the characters of the story are of the Hardic peoples, who are dark-skinned, and who populate most of the islands. Some of the Eastern islands are populated by the white-skinned Kargish people, who see the Hardic folk as evil sorcerers: the Kargish, in turn, are viewed by the Hardic as barbarians. The far western regions of the archipelago are where the dragons live.|$|E

5|$|Epic {{poetry is}} a genre of poetry, {{and a major}} form of {{narrative}} literature. This genre is often defined as lengthy poems concerning events of a heroic or important nature {{to the culture of}} the time. It recounts, in a continuous narrative, the life and works of a heroic or mythological person <b>or</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> persons. Examples of epic poems are Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, Virgil's Aeneid, the Nibelungenlied, Luís de Camões' Os Lusíadas, the Cantar de Mio Cid, the Epic of Gilgamesh, the Mahabharata, Valmiki's Ramayana, Ferdowsi's Shahnama, Nizami (or Nezami)'s Khamse (Five Books), and the Epic of King Gesar. While the composition of epic poetry, and of long poems generally, became less common in the west after the early 20th century, some notable epics have continued to be written. Derek Walcott won a Nobel prize to a great extent {{on the basis of his}} epic, Omeros.|$|E
5|$|Fleas feed on a {{wide variety}} of warm-blooded {{vertebrates}} including humans, dogs, cats, rabbits, squirrels, ferrets, rats, mice and birds. Fleas normally specialise in one host species <b>or</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> species, but can often feed but not reproduce on other species. Ceratophyllus gallinae affects poultry as well as wild birds. As well as the degree of relatedness of a potential host to the flea's original host, it has been shown that avian fleas that exploit a range of hosts, only parasitise species with low immune responses. In general, host specificity decreases as the size of the host species decreases. Another factor is the opportunities available to the flea to change host species; this is smaller in colonially nesting birds, where the flea may never encounter another species, than it is in solitary nesting birds. A large, long-lived host provides a stable environment that favours host-specific parasites.|$|E
5|$|Most {{laboratory}} {{techniques for}} growing bacteria use {{high levels of}} nutrients to produce large amounts of cells cheaply and quickly. However, in natural environments, nutrients are limited, meaning that bacteria cannot continue to reproduce indefinitely. This nutrient limitation has led the evolution of different growth strategies (see r/K selection theory). Some organisms can grow extremely rapidly when nutrients become available, such as the formation of algal (and cyanobacterial) blooms that often occur in lakes during the summer. Other organisms have adaptations to harsh environments, such as the production of multiple antibiotics by Streptomyces that inhibit the growth of competing microorganisms. In nature, many organisms live in communities (e.g., biofilms) that may allow for increased supply of nutrients and protection from environmental stresses. These relationships can be essential for growth of a particular organism <b>or</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> organisms (syntrophy).|$|E
