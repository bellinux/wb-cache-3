40|$|This is a {{qualitative}} study that explores <b>the</b> involvement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>relatives</b> in <b>the</b> special housing based on <b>the</b> perspective <b>of</b> fourteen interviewees working in elderly care, at special housing. <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> {{this study is}} to analyze the nursing staff's view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> involvement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>relatives</b> and <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> care provision at special housing. The study is to find out what can constitute support or obstacles to <b>the</b> <b>relatives.</b> Three questions have been presented as the structural basis upon which the objective finds its conclusion. These questions try to explore and identify <b>the</b> forms <b>of</b> support that can help relatives in their involvement in elderly care. There are opportunities and obstacles for <b>the</b> involvement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>relatives</b> in <b>the</b> care <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elderly as well as expectations of nursing staff on <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>relatives</b> in <b>the</b> care <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elderly which the following study focuses on.

In conclusion, the study identifies similar reasoning among respondents regarding to key aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>relatives</b> at <b>the</b> special housing. They emphasizes that relatives are needed there and they are important resource for both the residents and the staff. The results indicate that there may be both opportunities and obstacles for <b>the</b> involvement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>relatives.</b> On one side, factors that prevent relatives from their involvement are lack of communication, poor attitude, different views of relatives and staff about care and conflicts between them.

Because of its closed-shell electron configuration, its density and melting and boiling points differ significantly from those of most other lanthanides.|$|E

5|$|Although Acclaim, SNK, Ubisoft, Midway, Activision, Infogrames, and Capcom {{supported}} the system {{during its first}} year, third-party developer support proved difficult to obtain due {{to the failure of}} the Sega Saturn and the profitability of publishing for the PlayStation.

Capcom produced a number of fighting games for the system, including the Power Stone series, in addition to a temporary exclusive in the popular Resident Evil series called Resident Evil Code: Veronica. The Dreamcast is also known for several shoot 'em ups, most notably Treasure's Bangai-O and Ikaruga.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{reactions}} involved in Bynesian decay require a certain quantity of {{moisture in the}} air {{in order for them to}} take place, keeping the air somewhat dry, i.e. keeping the environmental relative humidity under control is beneficial. This is achieved by careful monitoring <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> humidity (using instruments such as a hygrometer), and applying dehumidifiers when necessary; sometimes, simple air conditioning systems may suffice. Extremely low humidity can damage some specimens, so caution is recommended. Usually, a relative humidity maintained around 50% is considered to be adequate. Applying sorbents containing a strong base, such as potassium hydroxide, inside the storage environment to protect the specimens against degradation is also possible. Copy paper or KOH-impregnated filter paper are some low cost examples of sorbents which can be used. These strong bases have a preference to react with acid, thus they compete successfully with the calcium carbonate specimens for any acidic vapors that may be present. The bases also help reduce the overall acid concentration inside the enclosed space.|$|E
5|$|During {{the seventeenth}} century, Tycho Brahe {{measured}} the diurnal parallax of Mars that Johannes Kepler {{used to make}} a preliminary calculation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> distance to the planet. When the telescope became available, the diurnal parallax of Mars was again measured in an effort to determine the Sun-Earth distance. This was first performed by Giovanni Domenico Cassini in 1672. The early parallax measurements were hampered by the quality of the instruments. The only occultation of Mars by Venus observed was that of October 13, 1590, seen by Michael Maestlin at Heidelberg. In 1610, Mars was viewed by Galileo Galilei, who was first to see it via telescope. The first person to draw a map of Mars that displayed any terrain features was the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens.|$|E

In 1983, it was upgraded to the 700-tonne Eurobarge standard by deepening the channels and enlarging the locks as far as Rotherham. Conisbrough lock was removed altogether, and the two Eastwood locks were combined into one. The new lock was initially named the Sir Frank Price Lock, after the chairman of the British Waterways Board who formally opened it on 1 June 1983. The expected rise in freight traffic did not occur, however. At Kilnhurst and Long Sandall, the new larger locks were built alongside the original locks, and so a comparison <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> sizes can be made.|$|E

5|$|The Girls He Left Behind Him and The Iron Clad Lover were {{released}} {{together on a}} single reel, approximately 1,000 feet in length, on December 9, 1910.
