5|$|Following {{the release}} of Bleach in June 1989, Nirvana {{embarked}} on its first national tour, and the album became a favorite of college radio stations. Due to increasing differences between Everman {{and the rest of}} the band over the course of the tour, Nirvana canceled the last few dates and drove back to Washington. No <b>one</b> <b>told</b> Everman he was fired at the time, while Everman later said that he actually quit the group. Although Sub Pop did not promote Bleach as much as other releases, it was a steady seller, and had initial sales of 40,000 copies. However, Cobain was upset by the label's lack of promotion and distribution for the album. In late 1989, the band recorded the Blew EP with producer Steve Fisk.|$|E

Although the shells had been fired without serious incident, Meyer and Petty Officer First Class Dale Eugene Mortensen, gun chief for Turret <b>One,</b> <b>told</b> Skelley that they would no longer participate in his experiments. Skelley asked Turret Two's gun chief, Senior Chief Reggie Ziegler, if he could use Turret Two for his experiments; Ziegler refused. Skelley then asked Lieutenant Phil Buch, Turret Two's officer in charge, and Buch acquiesced.|$|E

25|$|Grigory Orlov, the {{grandson}} of a rebel in the Streltsy Uprising (1698) against Peter the Great, distinguished himself in the Battle of Zorndorf (25 August 1758), receiving three wounds. He represented an opposite to Peter's pro-Prussian sentiment, with which Catherine disagreed. By 1759, Catherine and he had become lovers; no <b>one</b> <b>told</b> Catherine's husband, the Grand Duke Peter. Catherine saw Orlov as very useful, and he became instrumental in the 28 June 1762 coup d’état against her husband, but she preferred to remain the Dowager Empress of Russia, rather than marrying anyone.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} legends, {{similar to those}} told of Alexander the Great, were told of Seleucus. It was said Antiochus told his son before he left to battle the Persians with Alexander that his real father was {{actually}} the god Apollo. The god had left a ring {{with a picture of}} an anchor as a gift to Laodice. Seleucus had a birthmark shaped like an anchor. It was told that Seleucus' sons and grandsons also had similar birthmarks. The story is similar to the <b>one</b> <b>told</b> about Alexander. Most likely the story is merely propaganda by Seleucus, who presumably invented the story to present himself as the natural successor of Alexander.|$|E
25|$|The tales vary widely: {{they include}} {{historical}} tales, love stories, tragedies, comedies, poems, burlesques, and {{various forms of}} erotica. Numerous stories depict jinns, ghouls, apes, sorcerers, magicians, and legendary places, which are often intermingled with real people and geography, not always rationally. Common protagonists include the historical Abbasid caliph Harun al-Rashid, his Grand Vizier, Jafar al-Barmaki, and the famous poet Abu Nuwas, {{despite the fact that}} these figures lived some 200 years {{after the fall of the}} Sassanid Empire, in which the frame tale of Scheherazade is set. Sometimes a character in Scheherazade's tale will begin telling other characters a story of his own, and that story may have another <b>one</b> <b>told</b> within it, resulting in a richly layered narrative texture.|$|E
25|$|Salemme took {{advantage}} of Ferrara's imprisonment to become the de facto leader of the Patriarca family. He still faced the challenge of Ferrara's crew and the other Argiulo loyalists in the North End. Both sides reportedly drew up lists of people they intended to kill, and began doing so. At one point the brother of one intended target was killed on the street while changing a flat tire. Many Patriarca operatives report {{that they were in}} constant fear for their lives during this period; <b>one</b> <b>told</b> Globe reporter Stephen Kurkjian in 2014 that after learning his name was on one of the lists and that two men had shown up at his sister's home looking for him, he moved to the far north of New England and began living under an assumed name.|$|E

25|$|The {{second time}} it tells of Froda and Ingeld is in Book 7, but here Hrothgar is {{replaced}} by a Harald and Halga by a Haldanus. It is the Scandinavian version of the feud, similar to the <b>one</b> <b>told</b> in the Skjöldunga saga, Bjarkarímur and Hrólfr Kraki's saga, where the Heaðobards are forgotten and the feud with Froda and Ingeld has become a family feud. The main plot is that Ingeld had the sons Frodo (Froda) and Harald (corresponds to Healfdene). The relationship between Ingeld and Froda was thus reversed, a reversal also found in the Skjöldunga saga and in the Bjarkarímur. Froda killed his brother and tried to get rid of his nephews Harald (corresponds to Hrothgar) and Haldanus (corresponds to Halga). After some adventures, the two brothers burnt their uncle to death inside his house and avenged their father.|$|E
25|$|The third time, {{it tells}} of Froda and Ingeld is in book 7, but here Hroðgar is {{replaced}} by a Harald and Halga by a Haldanus. It is the same Ingeld as in the previous paragraph, but here Froda reappears as Ingeld's son. It is a version of the feud that is similar to the <b>one</b> <b>told</b> in the Skjöldunga saga, Bjarkarímur and Hrólfr Kraki's saga, where the Heaðobards had been forgotten and the feud with Froda and Ingeld has become a family feud.

25|$|George Orson Welles {{was born}} May 6, 1915, in Kenosha, Wisconsin, son of Richard Head Welles (b. Richard Hodgdon Wells, November 12, 1872, near St. Joseph, Missouri; d. December 28, 1930, Chicago, Illinois) and Beatrice Ives Welles (b. Beatrice Lucy Ives, September 1, 1883, Springfield, Illinois; d. May 10, 1924, Chicago). He {{was named after}} his {{paternal}} great-grandfather, influential Kenosha attorney Orson S. Head, and his brother George Head. An alternative story {{of the source of}} his first and middle names is <b>one</b> <b>told</b> by George Ade, who met Welles's parents on a West Indies cruise toward the end of 1914. Ade was traveling with a friend, Orson Wells (no relation), {{and the two of them}} sat at the same table as Mr. and Mrs. Richard Welles. Mrs Welles was pregnant at the time, and when they said good-by, she told them that she had enjoyed their company so much that if the child were a boy, she intended to name it for them - George Orson. Welles's birth announcement and a picture of him as a young boy are among George Ade's papers at Purdue University.|$|E

25|$|Some of the {{reported}} cases may be myths, or wandering stories. The 1326 Hennegau case, for example, deviates from the others in that the Jew was not a thief, but was suspected (even {{though he was a}} convert to Christianity) of having struck an al fresco painting of Virgin Mary, so that blood had begun to seep down the wall from the painting. Even under all degrees of judicial torture, the Jew denied performing this sacrilegious act, and was therefore exonerated. Then a brawny smith demanded from him a trial by combat, because, supposedly, in a dream the Virgin herself had besought the smith to do so. The court accepted the smith's challenge, he easily won the combat against the Jew, who was duly hanged up by the feet between two dogs. To add to the injury, one let him be slowly roasted as well as hanged. This is a very similar story to <b>one</b> <b>told</b> in France, in which a young Jew threw a lance {{at the head of a}} statue of the Virgin, so that blood spurted out of it. There was inadequate evidence for a normal trial, but a frail old man asked for trial by combat, and bested the young Jew. The Jew confessed his crime, and was hanged by his feet between two mastiffs.|$|E
25|$|Act <b>One</b> <b>told</b> {{the story}} of DNA as a thing that makes human {{different}} and understand each other, Act two told {{the story of}} how children use their dream to imagine, Act three {{told the story of}} how Youths use dream to express themselves, Act four told the story of how family support become an inspiration for athletes and coaches to achieve success in sports. While Act 5, the conclusion told the story of how Singaporean athletes welcome, make friends and unite with the athletes other country of Southeast Asia regardless of language, race and belief. Soon after the last act, the torch of the Games was carried into the stadium from a dragon boat across the Kallang basin by several Singapore’s former and current generation of sportsmen and sportswomen. The current sportsmen are Clement Teo of Dragon Boat, Liang Xiaoyu of Badminton, Muhammad Naqib Asmin of Athletics, Gabriel Yang of Judo, Dinah Chan of Cycling, Enrico Marican of Hockey, Shanti Pereira of Athletics, Derek Wong Zi Liang of Badminton, while the former sportsmen are Annabel Pennefather of Hockey, Prema Govindran of Athletics and Wong Shoon Keat of Badminton. The cauldron was lit by former football sportsman, Fandi Ahmad and his son and current football sportsman, Irfan Fandi. The cauldron’s design was inspired by the DNA which represents the unity of nations, communities and individuals of Southeast Asia. It is made of stainless steel, 19.2-metre-high and has a LED screen on it that displays information such as the time and weather during the Games. It also has a burner that able to project a 1.5m- to 4m-high flame and 11 bars within the structure that represent the different countries participating at the Games. A colourful fireworks display then erupted over the skyline surrounding the National Stadium, signalling the official commencement of the Games. The ceremony concludes with the President leaving the stadium.|$|E

[...] Observers playing the film and the album simultaneously have reported apparent synchronicities, such as Dorothy beginning to jog at the lyric [...] "no <b>one</b> <b>told</b> you when to run" [...] during [...] "Time", and Dorothy balancing on a tightrope fence during the line [...] "balanced on the biggest wave" [...] in [...] "Breathe".

500|$|Back at Montevideo, Darwin was {{introduced}} to Conrad Martens, the replacement artist brought on board the Beagle after Augustus Earle had to leave due to health problems. They sailed south, putting in at Port Desire on 23December, and the following day Darwin shot a guanaco which provided them with a Christmas meal. Early in the new year, Martens shot a rhea which they enjoyed eating before Darwin realised {{that this was the}} elusive smaller rhea, and preserved the remains. On 9January1834, [...] further south, they reached Port St Julian and exploring the local geology in cliffs near the harbour Darwin found fossils of pieces of spine and a hind leg of [...] "some large animal, I fancy a Mastodon".

500|$|While The Darjeeling Limited {{did receive}} {{generally}} positive reviews—having attained a 68% approval rating on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes—many of the champions of Hotel Chevalier tended to combine praise of Chevalier with subtle shots at Darjeeling. [...] Portman's performance was praised by TIME reviewer Richard Corliss, who declared {{her to be}} [...] "a comic actress in fresh bloom" [...] in the [...] "beguiling vignette", and expressed his wish that her role in Darjeeling had been greater. The feature, he felt, lacked [...] "the feeling and wit of the short film". Stephanie Zacharek of Salon concurred, stating that [...] "the untold story of Hotel Chevalier is 10 times more interesting, and infinitely richer, than the <b>one</b> <b>told</b> outright in [...] ", and calling the short [...] "very close to perfect". The Guardian columnist Danny Leigh contrasted the lukewarm reception of the feature among bloggers and critics with the [...] "genuine ardour" [...] that greeted the [...] "perfectly measured narrative" [...] of Chevalier. He proposed that {{the constraints of the}} short-film format suited Anderson, whose trademark deadpan humor, idiosyncratic set designs and choice of soundtrack inclined to exhaust the viewers' patience in a feature-length work. A. O. Scott of The New York Times hailed Chevalier as [...] "a small gem" [...] in comparison to the [...] "overstuffed suitcase" [...] of the feature, and wrote that [...] "It is worth seeking out, not only because it fleshes out part of the story of the Whitman brothers but also because, on its own, it is an almost perfect distillation of Mr. Anderson's vexing and intriguing talents, enigmatic, affecting and wry." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite being {{promoted}} as the show's heart and moral conscience, {{the flaws in}} Gwen's own morality are explored throughout the series; a press release noted that she is both selfless and selfish. The first series sees Gwen embark on a brief affair with colleague Owen Harper. Executive producer Russell T Davies explains that the episode [...] "Countrycide" [...] was deliberately structured {{in order to make}} the affair seem inevitable as Gwen struggles to cope with Torchwood life. For Davies, the dalliance is a [...] "human" [...] <b>one,</b> <b>told</b> in an adult manner characterised by [...] "lust and anger and hurt and the joy you get out of the initial stages of having an affair". Myles commented that Gwen's compromised morality, as demonstrated by her affair was suitably challenging for a science fiction audience, and served to demonstrate that none of the Torchwood team were [...] "safe" [...] from temptation. Writer Stephen James Walker argues that Gwen's moral ambiguity made her a more compelling character. Since she was introduced as an audience surrogate, Walker claimed it would have been an easy trap to make her a [...] "one-dimensional paragon of virtue". Instead, the writers made Gwen more [...] "realistic" [...] by giving her [...] "distinct human failings", which Walker felt made her [...] "arguably the most complex and interesting of the five regulars". He identified these failures as her [...] "tendency towards egotism", [...] "self-righteousness", and [...] "selfishness", evident in her [...] "highly questionable treatment" [...] of boyfriend Rhys Williams. Walker cited her affair with Owen as an example, as well as the scene in [...] "Combat" [...] where she confesses this betrayal to Rhys after dosing him with the amnesia drug Retcon so he won't remember.|$|E
