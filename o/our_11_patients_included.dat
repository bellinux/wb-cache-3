40|$|Virtual reality {{training}} is considered {{as an effective}} intervention method of stroke patients, and the virtual reality system for therapeutic rehabilitation has emphasized the cognitive factors to improve walking function. The purpose of current {{study was to investigate}} the effect of virtual reality training with cognitive load (VRTCL) on walking function of chronic stroke. Chronic stroke patients were randomly assigned to the VRTCL group (<b>11</b> <b>patients,</b> <b>including</b> 5 men; mean age, 60. 0 years; post-stroke duration, 273. 9 days) or control group (<b>11</b> <b>patients,</b> <b>including</b> 2 men; mean age, 58. 6 years; post-stroke duration, 263. 9 days). All subjects participated in the standard rehabilitation program that consisted of physical and occupational therapies. In addition, VRTCL group participated in the VRTCL for 4 weeks (30 min per day and five times a week), while those in the control group participated in virtual reality treadmill training. Walking function under single (walking alone) and dual task (walking with cognitive tasks) conditions was assessed using an electrical walkway system. After the 4 -week intervention, under both single and dual task conditions, significant improvement on walking function was observed in VRTCL and control groups (P < 0. 05). In addition, in the dual task condition, greater improvement on walking function was observed in the VRTC...|$|R

Chromosomal aberrant status was analyzed by fluorescence {{in situ hybridization}} with centromere specific and 17 p 13. 1 locus specific probes. In 3 of 9 cancer patients we did not find malignant pleural effusion with histological examination and/or closed pleural biopsy. Heterozygous deletion of TP 53 gene was found to be significantly higher in patients with malignant disease when compared to the patients with benign pleural fluid. As a result, we suggest that heterozygous deletion of TP 53 may have indicator value for malignancy; however further studies are warranted to confirm this suggestion in large patient cohorts...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Anterior {{urethral}} valves (AUVs) is {{an unusual}} cause of congenital obstruction of the male urethra, being 15 – 30 times less common than posterior urethral valves (PUVs). It {{has been suggested that}} patients with congenital anterior urethral obstruction have a better prognosis than those with PUV, with less hydronephrosis, and a lower incidence of chronic renal insufficiency (5 vs. 30 %). The long-term prognosis of AUVs is not clear in the literature. In this report we describe our experience and long-term follow up of patients with anterior urethral valve. Materials and Methods:We retrospectively identified 13 patients who presented with the diagnosis of AUVs in our institutions between January 1994 and June 2012. Two patients were excluded: one patient had no follow up after intervention; the other had a follow up < 1 year. From the <b>11</b> <b>patients</b> <b>included,</b> we evaluated the gestational age, prenatal and postnatal ultrasound findings, voiding cystourethrogram findings, age upon valve ablation, micturition pattern, creatinine, and clinical follow up.

Using extended (18 - 24 hour) esophageal pH monitoring to assess gastroesophageal reflux (GER), we studied prospectively 32 children (aged 2 to 16 years) referred for feeding gastrostomy. Twenty-five patients had repeat esophageal pH monitoring after surgery. Prior to surgery, GER was documented in 23 (72 %) of the 32 children. Twenty-two of the 23 children with GER before surgery had an antireflux operation performed {{in conjunction with the}} feeding gastrostomy. Gastroesophageal reflux was clinically significant in the single failed antireflux operation and in the child with GER before surgery who only had a gastrostomy performed. All nine patients without GER only had gastrostomy performed. Six of these developed GER by pH monitoring after surgery, with significant vomiting in four. Of <b>our</b> <b>11</b> <b>patients</b> remaining at risk for GER after surgery, seven (64 %) had persistent vomiting with gastrostomy feedings.

40|$|AIM: To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} and side effect profiles of three furazolidone and amoxicillin-based quadruple rescue therapies for {{the eradication of}} Helicobacter pylori (H pylori). METHODS: Patients who failed in the H pylori eradication therapy {{for at least one}} course were randomly allocated into three groups. Group A received rebaprazole 10 mg + amoxicillin 1 g + furazolidone 100 mg, and bismuth subcitrate 220 mg, twice daily for 1 wk; group B received the same regimen of group A but for 2 wk; and group C received the same regimen of group B, but furazolidone was replaced by furazolidone 100 mg three times daily. To record the side effect profiles {{at the end of the}} treatment, H pylori eradication was assessed with 13 C-urea breath test 4 wk after therapy. RESULTS: Sixty <b>patients</b> were enrolled <b>including</b> 28 males, and 20 patients in each group. The average age of the patients was 49. 2 years, ranging from 18 to 84 years.

30|$|We used sleep {{analysis}} {{according to}} the American Academy Sleep of Medicine (AASM). Other {{studies have shown that}} AASM was often an insufficient monitor for sleep stages in critically ill patients. Therefore, a modified AASM has been proposed by Watson et al. which can be used in critically ill patients [37]. However, in our study, all the sleep stages in these ventilated patients could be pre-categorized as REM or non-REM, N 1, N 2, N 3 and awake. No atypical patterns were observed, and absent signal was only 0.2 %. One possible explanation for this finding could lie in the category of patients: the <b>11</b> <b>patients</b> <b>included</b> {{in the present study were}} highly selected. They were non-sedated, undergoing weaning and post-resolution of disease. In other words, they were long-term ventilated patients without a cute illness. They were ventilated and in the ICU, but not critically ill. The fact that these patients were not critically ill might be an explanation for the lack of atypical sleep patterns. Secondly, the ActiWave itself, with electrodes positioned close to the sleeping brain, may have delivered more accurate quality of sleep signals than previous studies.|$|R
40|$|The MLL gene, {{on human}} {{chromosome}} 11 q 23, undergoes chromosomal translocation in acute leukemias, resulting in gene fusion with AF 4 (chromosome 4) and ENL (chromosome 19). We report here translocation of MLL with nine different chromosomes and two paracentric chromosome 11 deletions in early B cell, B- or T-cell lineage, or nonlymphocytic acute leukemias. The mRNA translocation junction from 22 t(4; <b>11)</b> <b>patients,</b> <b>including</b> six adult leukemias, and nine t(11; 19) tumors reveals a remarkable conservation of breakpoints within MLL, AF 4, or ENL genes, irrespective of tumor phenotype.

Method: We mapped the breakpoints of a 2; 14 translocation by fluorescence in situ hybridization and analyzed three chromosome rearrangements in 14 q 12 by cytogenetic analysis and/or array CGH. We sequenced the FOXG 1 gene in 210 <b>patients,</b> <b>including</b> 129 <b>patients</b> with unexplained developmental disorders and 81 MECP 2 -mutation negative individuals. Results: We report one known mutation, seen in 2 patients, and 9 novel mutations of FOXG 1 including 2 deletions, 2 chromosome rearrangements disrupting or displacing putative cis-regulatory elements from FOXG 1, and 7 sequence changes. Analysis of <b>our</b> <b>11</b> <b>patients,</b> and further 15 patients reported in the literature, demonstrates a complex constellation of features including mild postnatal growth deficiency, severe postnatal microcephaly, severe mental retardation with absent language development, deficient social reciprocity resembling autism, combined stereotypies and frank dyskinesias, epilepsy, poor sleep patterns, irritability in infancy, unexplained episodes of crying, recurrent aspiration, and gastroesophageal reflux. Brain imaging studies reveal simplified gyral pattern and reduced white matter volume in the frontal lobes, corpus callosum hypogenesis, and variable mild frontal pachgyria.

There were 16 men and six women (mean age 49 years). The underlying pathology was infection after internal fixation of ankle or plafond fractures in 16 patients, posttraumatic ankle arthritis in five, and septic arthritis after an infected Achilles tendon repair in one. Five patients {{had at least one}} failed previous arthrodesis. Primary iliac crest bone grafting was done in two patients. Proximal tibial lengthening was done in six patients.

40|$|Background: Transcatheter {{aortic valve}} {{implantation}} (TAVI) can cause profound haemodynamic perturbation in the peri-operative period. Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) {{can be used}} to provide cardiorespiratory support during this time, either prophylactically or emergently. Method: 100 TAVI procedures were performed between 2009 and 2013 in our institution. ECMO was used in <b>11</b> <b>patients,</b> <b>including</b> eight prophylactic and three rescue cases. Rescue ECMO was required for ventricular fibrillation after valvuloplasty, and aortic annulus rupture. The criteria for prophylactic ECMO included heart failure requiring stabilisation pre-TAVI, haemodynamic instability with balloon aortic valvuloplasty performed to improve heart function pre-TAVI, moderate or severe left and/or right ventricular failure, or borderline haemodynamics at procedure. Differences in preoperative characteristics and postoperative outcomes between ECMO and non-ECMO TAVI patients were compared, and significant results were further assessed controlling for EuroSCORE. Results: Compared to TAVI patients who did not require ECMO, ECMO patients had significantly higher mean EuroSCORE (51 vs. 30 %, p. 05). ECMO patients were more likely to develop acute renal failure than non-ECMO patients (36 vs. 8 %, p <. 05), which was most likely due to haemodynamic collapse and end-organ dysfunction in patients that required ECMO rescue.

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD), the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and the recommended dose (RD) of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) with gemcitabine (GEM) plus oral S- 1 in patients with resectable pancreatic cancer. Thirteen patients with radiologically proven resectable pancreatic cancer were included in this study. S- 1 was administered orally for 14 consecutive days, and GEM was administered on days 8 and 15 for two pre-operative cycles. The dose of S- 1 in this study was planned with fixed doses of GEM (1, 000 mg/m 2) : 20, 30 and 40 mg/day for levels 0, 1 and 2, respectively. Treatment was initiated at level 1 in 3 patients, while adverse events occurred in 2 patients during the second course, leading to a dose reduction to level 0 for the 8 remaining patients. Two of the 10 patients enrolled at level 0 were excluded. Of the remaining 8 patients, GEM administration was terminated due to DLT on day 15, during the first course in 3 patients, while level 0 dosage reached MTD. Surgery was performed for the remaining <b>11</b> <b>patients</b> <b>included</b> in the study. Post-operative complications included pancreatic fistulas in 5 patients and Pseudomonas aeruginosa sepsis in 1 patient. Two of the <b>11</b> <b>patients</b> exhibited a partial response and 9 patients stable disease. Eight of the 11 tumor specimens showed histopatho-logical evidence of tumor cell injury. In conclusion, NAC with GEM and S- 1 was not well-tolerated in this study. However, pre-operative chemotherapy may be effective against pancre-atic cancer.

40|$|Background: In {{spite of}} the {{availability}} of multiple treatment options, viral warts are known for their persistence and recurrence, causing frustration to patients and treating physicians. Aims: To study the effectiveness and safety of autoinoculation as a treatment modality in cutaneous warts. Methods: A double-blind, placebo-controlled study was carried out. In the treatment group, full-thickness warty tissue was excised, minced and implanted in a small dermal pocket. In the control group, warty tissue was only excised and not implanted, though a dermal pocket was made. Patients were evaluated every four weeks with lesion counts. The procedure was repeated at 4 and 8 weeks. Response was assessed at each visit and at 12 weeks. Results: Forty-eight patients with cutaneous warts (male: female = 32 : 16) were randomized into autoinoculation and control groups. The number of warts at baseline was comparable in both groups (P = 0. 293). Reduction in the number of warts was significantly more in the autoinoculation group (8. 50 ± 13. 88) than in the control group (10. 04 ± 5. 80) from 8 weeks onwards (P = 0. 010).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Short-acting {{agents for}} neuromuscular block (NMB) require {{frequent}} dosing adjustments for individual patient's needs. In this study, we verified a new closed-loop controller for mivacurium dosing in clinical trials. METHODS: Fifteen patients were studied. T 1 % measured with electromyography {{was used as}} input signal for the model-based controller. After induction of propofol/opiate anaesthesia, stabilization of baseline electromyography signal was awaited and a bolus of 0. 3 mg kg- 1 mivacurium was then administered to facilitate endotracheal intubation. Closed-loop infusion was started thereafter, targeting a neuromuscular block of 90 %. Setpoint deviation, the number of manual interventions and surgeon's complaints were recorded. Drug use and its variability between and within patients were evaluated. RESULTS: Median time of closed-loop control for the <b>11</b> <b>patients</b> <b>included</b> in the data processing was 135 [89 - 336] min (median [range]). Four patients had to be excluded because of sensor problems. Mean absolute deviation from setpoint was 1. 8 +/- 0. 9 T 1 %. Neither manual interventions nor complaints from the surgeons were recorded. Mean necessary mivacurium infusion rate was 7. 0 +/- 2. 2 microg kg- 1 min- 1. Intrapatient variability of mean infusion rates over 30 -min interval showed high differences up to a factor of 1. 8 between highest and lowest requirement in the same patient. CONCLUSIONS: Neuromuscular block can precisely be controlled with mivacurium using our model-based controller. The amount of mivacurium needed to maintain T 1 % at defined constant levels differed largely between and within patients. Closed-loop control seems therefore advantageous to automatically maintain neuromuscular block at constant levels...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background and Purpose: Benign renal conditions, such as {{duplication}} and fusion anomalies, {{are relatively}} common and {{may lead to}} problems such as chronic flank pain or urinary tract infection. Traditional management of these conditions has been open surgical removal of the affected moiety. As an alternative, we report on our experience with laparoscopic heminephrectomy for benign renal anomalies and emphasize {{the technical aspects of}} the procedures. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients who underwent laparoscopic heminephrectomy for benign renal anomalies at our institution between February 1999 and April 2009. Results: Heminephrectomy was performed in <b>11</b> <b>patients,</b> <b>including</b> 8 with duplicated collecting systems, 2 with horseshoe kidneys, and 1 with a cross-fused renal ectopic kidney. Median operative time was 204 minutes, and median estimated blood loss was 250 ?mL. There were no intraoperative complications. The presenting symptoms resolved in all patients. There were three major and two minor postoperative complications, including 50 % loss of remaining ipsilateral renal parenchyma, postoperative neuralgia and anejaculation, urinoma, and partial wound separation. Median length of hospital stay was 2 days. Renal function was well preserved in all patients. The median change in serum creatinine level was 0. 1 ?mg/dL. Conclusions: Although laparoscopic heminephrectomy is challenging because of the variable blood supply and abnormal anatomy of the kidney, with careful planning and attention to detail, the procedure is safe and effective for the management {{of a wide range of}} benign renal anomalies that necessitate heminephrectomy and offers the usual recovery advantages of laparoscopy...|$|R

We reevaluated the files of MS patients from Qom Province of Iran in order to investigate the epidemiology of the disease. Demographic and clinical records of 592 MS patients were reviewed, which included; age, sex, date of birth, marital and occupation status, presenting symptoms, time of onset, type and family history of MS, and history of autoimmune or other diseases. At the time of <b>our</b> study, <b>11</b> <b>patients</b> had died, and 581 were alive with a total female-to-male ratio of 3. 4. The mean age of onset of the disease was 34. 25 ± 9. 01 for all the <b>patients.</b> <b>11.</b> 2 % of patients had positive family history of MS. The majority of patients (80. 1 %) showed relapsing-remitting (RR) pattern. The prevalence of MS was calculated as 50. 4 / 100000 for Qom. Qom is located within a high risk zone of MS. Although we found evidences {{about the role of}} environmental factors, geographical distribution, and etcetera, many more studies need to be performed in this respect...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Anterior {{urethral}} valves (AUV) is {{an unusual}} cause of congenital obstruction of the male urethra, being 15 to 30 times less common than posterior urethral valves (PUV). It {{has been suggested that}} patients with congenital anterior urethral obstruction have a better prognosis than those with PUV. The long term prognosis of anterior urethral valves is not clear in the literature. In this report we describe our experience and long-term follow up of patients with AUV. Materials and methods: We retrospectively identified 13 patients who presented with the diagnosis of AUV in our institutions between 1994 and 2012. From the <b>11</b> <b>patients</b> <b>included,</b> we evaluated the gestational age, ultrasound and voiding cystourethrogram findings, age upon valve ablation, micturition pattern, creatinine and clinical follow up. Results: Between 1994 and 2012 we evaluated 150 patients with the diagnosis of urethral valves, where <b>11</b> <b>patients</b> (7. 3 %) had AUV and an adequate follow up. Mean follow up is 6. 3 years. 5 patients (45. 4 %) had pre-natal diagnosis of AUV. The most common prenatal ultrasonographic finding was bilateral hydronephrosis and distended bladder. The mean gestational age was 37. 6 weeks. Postnatally, 90 % had trabeculated bladder, 80 % hydronephrosis and 40 % renal dysplasia. The most common clinical presentation was urinary tract infection in 5 patients (45. 4 %). 7 patients (63. 6 %) had primary transurethral valve resection or laser ablation and 3 patients (27. 2 %) had primary vesicostomies. One boy (9. 1 %) had urethrostomy with urethral diverticulum excision. 2 patients (18. 2 %) developed end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Conclusions: Early urinary tract obstruction resulted in ESRD in 18 % of our patient population. In our series, the complication rate and the evolution to renal failure are high and similar to patients with PUV. In patients with AUV we recommend long-term follow up and close evaluation of patient’s bladder and renal function...|$|R
40|$|Primary {{cutaneous}} B-cell lymphoma (CBCL) constitutes approximately 20 % of all primary cutaneous lymphomas. Apart from primary cutaneous large B-cell lymphoma presenting on {{the legs}} (PCLBCL-leg), primary CBCLs run an indolent clinical course, rarely disseminate to extracutaneous sites, {{and have an}} excellent prognosis. Because of recent observations in two patients who developed central nervous system (CNS) involvement, follow-up data of all primary CBCL patients registered at the Dutch Cutaneous Lymphoma Group between 1985 and 1998 were investigated for evidence of CNS involvement. Follow-up data from 160 primary CBCLs were evaluated. This group included 122 primary cutaneous follicle center cell lymphomas (PCFCCLs), 16 primary cutaneous immunocytomas or marginal zone B-cell lymphomas, and 22 PCLBCL-leg. Of all 160 patients with primary CBCLs, 11 died of lymphoma, including 4 of 122 patients (3 %) with PCFCCL and 7 of 22 patients (32 %) with PCLBCL-leg. Four of these <b>11</b> <b>patients,</b> <b>including</b> 3 with PCFCCL and 1 with PCLBCL-leg, had developed CNS involvement 3 - 93 months (median, 30 months) after diagnosis. All patients died 1 - 9 months (median, 7 months) after the development of CNS involvement. In the group of 122 patients with PCFCCL, CNS involvement occurred in 3 of 7 patients (43 %) who developed extracutaneous disease and accounted for 3 of 4 lymphoma-related deaths (75 %). The {{results of this study}} indicate that approximately 2 % of all primary CBCLs may develop CNS involvement. Whereas, in rare PCFCCL patients, developing extracutaneous disease CNS involvement was an important cause of death, patients with PCLBCL-leg and secondary CBCL died more frequently due to involvement of non-CNS organ system...|$|R

We sought to compare clinical outcomes between short- (≤ 6 months) versus long-term (≥ 1 year) DAPT after drug-eluting stent (DES) placement in women and men. METHODS AND RESULTS We pooled individual patient data from 6 randomized trials of DAPT (EXCELLENT, OPTIMIZE, PRODIGY, RESET, SECURITY, ITALIC PLUS). The primary outcome was 1 -year risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE). The main secondary outcome was 1 -year risk of any bleeding.

40|$|While inflow {{occlusion}} {{techniques are}} accepted methods to reduce bleeding during open liver surgery, {{their use in}} laparoscopic liver resections are limited by possible effects of pneumoperitoneum on ischemia-reperfusion liver damage. This retrospective {{study was designed to}} investigate the impact of intermittent pedicle clamping (IPC) on patients with normal liver undergoing minor laparoscopic liver resections. Three matched groups of patients were retrospectively selected from <b>our</b> in-house database: <b>11</b> <b>patients</b> who underwent robot-assisted liver resection with IPC, and 16 and <b>11</b> <b>patients</b> who underwent robot-assisted liver resection without IPC and open liver resection with IPC, respectively. The primary end point was to assess differences in postoperative serum alanine, aspartate aminotransferase (ALT and AST) and bilirubin levels. The curves of serum AST, ALT and bilirubin levels in a span of time of five postoperative days were not significantly different between the three groups. IPC has no relevant effects on ischemia-reperfusion liver damage even in the presence of pneumoperitoneum. © 2011 Springer-Verlag...|$|R
