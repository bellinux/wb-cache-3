40|$|We {{investigated}} whether <b>officers</b> <b>with</b> additional {{martial arts}} training experience performed better in arrest and self-defence scenarios under {{low and high}} anxiety and were better able to maintain performance under high anxiety than officers who just rely on regular police training. We were especially interested {{to find out whether}} training once a week would already lead to better performance under high anxiety. <b>Officers</b> <b>with</b> additional experience in kickboxing or karate/jiu-jitsu (training several times per week), or krav maga (training once a week) and <b>officers</b> <b>with</b> no additional experience performed several arrest and self-defence skills under low and high anxiety. Results showed that <b>officers</b> <b>with</b> additional experience (also those who trained once a week) performed better under high anxiety than <b>officers</b> <b>with</b> no additional experience. Still, the additional experience did not prevent these participants from performing worse under high anxiety compared to low anxiety. Implications for training are discussed...|$|R
