40|$|The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is {{the path}} vector routing {{protocol}} that connects different autonomous systems [...] These ASes have unique integer numbers which assign by IANA organization. The traditional BGP protocol {{is not sufficient}} to provide security and authentication for AS path and verification of AS number ownership as well as network IP prefix. The BGP remains vulnerable to various types of misconfiguration by users and attacks. Many secure BGP algorithms have been proposed but complexity of algorithm and attack on that models still remain open problem. In this paper, we propose anefficient model for SBGP; initially establish trust relationship between BGP peers. In this process BGP use TCP protocol for reliable communication. The BGP routers will attempt to create secure BGP session byexchanging BGP <b>Open</b> <b>messages.</b> During this <b>Open</b> <b>messages</b> master BGP router generate private key with help of cyclic shifting of ASCII of password called cyclic shift algorithm. Then hash of this private key send towards neighbour. Instead of key exchange, we use hashing algorithm, we generate hash of only key through SHA- 1. This hash code for private key sent with <b>Open</b> <b>messages</b> during session establishment. When this <b>Open</b> <b>messages</b> receive by neighbor BGP routers, first it generate key using same password with same algorithm & generate hash code for same and then compare both hash code. If it matches then establish secure session with master BGP router & accept the Autonomous system number which is sent bymaster router during <b>Open</b> <b>Messages.</b> In this manner both BGP speakers make trust relationship between each other & then exchange route UPDATE within secure channel. If hash code at receiver end does notmatch then simply receiving BGP router discard <b>Open</b> <b>messages</b> and does not make connection with unauthorized AS number. If malicious router wants to inject false route or false ip prefix then it does notcreate secure session by lack of secure private key. So malicious router does not participate in above BGP routing process...|$|R

Just after Sanda arrives with Malcolm and some men, Sanda's ship is blown up by the drone Builder, who has appeared to exact revenge on Reynolds. Reynolds' crew and Sanda's fight off the Builder together. After the Builder is defeated, Sanda allows Reynolds and his crew to depart, but Reynolds then learns that Sanda's men stole the money from Serenity. Later, Inara observes that Reynolds is neither surprised nor concerned about the loss of the money, and suggests that unlike the others, Reynolds is already living out the life he wants, and that it would be threatened if the rest of his crew suddenly became rich enough to go off in their own directions. Reynolds responds that he simply accepts where he is in life, preferring not to dwell in fantasy.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} make {{decisions}} in its operations with peers, a BGP peer uses a simple finite state machine (FSM) that consists of six states: Idle; Connect; Active; OpenSent; OpenConfirm; and Established. For each peer-to-peer session, a BGP implementation maintains a state variable that tracks which of these six states the session is in. The BGP defines the messages that each peer should exchange in order to change the session from one state to another. The first state is the [...] "Idle" [...] state. In the [...] "Idle" [...] state, BGP initializes all resources, refuses all inbound BGP connection attempts and initiates a TCP connection to the peer. The second state is [...] "Connect". In the [...] "Connect" [...] state, the router waits for the TCP connection to complete and transitions to the [...] "OpenSent" [...] state if successful. If unsuccessful, it starts the ConnectRetry timer and transitions to the [...] "Active" [...] state upon expiration. In the [...] "Active" [...] state, the router resets the ConnectRetry timer to zero {{and returns to the}} [...] "Connect" [...] state. In the [...] "OpenSent" [...] state, the router sends an <b>Open</b> <b>message</b> and waits for one in return in order to transition to the [...] "OpenConfirm" [...] state. Keepalive messages are exchanged and, upon successful receipt, the router is placed into the [...] "Established" [...] state. In the [...] "Established" [...] state, the router can send/receive: Keepalive; Update; and Notification messages to/from its peer.|$|E

Vocal cycles [...] "Songs of Motherhood" [...] (1984), [...] "Songs of My Dutar" [...] (1987), [...] "Ornaments of Independence" [...] (1993) are some of her major vocal works. Like in other music of Turkmen composers, in music of Jeren Kurbanklycheva we can clearly hear patriotic and ethnic notes but unlike other composers, Jeren chooses to deliver her nationalistic ideas and patriotic spirit through the language of contemporary music. Her style, musical language and thoughts about contemporary music and compositional techniques can be understood when she discusses her vision of modern music:“Young generations always strive for something new. Of course a contemporary composer should possess a whole arsenal of tools and a vision for new music and modern writing, but should it completely destroy the common sense of music and melody? That’s not what I believe in. However, neither should a stereotype of staying musical and sounding good dissolve ones initial idea and hold one from delivering a message across. First, an idea, then you develop the melody that conveys the meaning behind it in it’s absolute accuracy {{up to the point}} when your melody becomes a better expression of your idea than your words or even thoughts. Then, more you engrave your melody, the brighter it starts to reflect different colors of other factors like nowadays social life, your emotional and mental state, your ethnical heritage, nationality and culture and of course other types of modern arts. The moment those vivid reflections of one single idea become organic enough to shine as a ray but still keep their unique colors to be heard individually, you get the composition that came directly from an open heart. Pure and honest. People appreciate honesty, so no matter how boldly atonal or “old fashioned” tonal a piece ended up being, the audience will pick up your <b>open</b> <b>message</b> and will connect to it.” ...|$|E

40|$|Information {{security}} {{is an issue}} of utmost importance in modern time. In order to protect the safety of communication, data encryption and decryption (also called codec) are in-troduced into the communication system. Traditional cryptography focuses on how to encode the secret message into unrecognizable cipher text during transmission. On the other hand, information hiding, one branch of modern cryptography, mainly studies on how to hide secret message into other <b>open</b> <b>message</b> and use this <b>open</b> <b>message</b> as the in-termediate agent of transmission. Nowadays, the commonly used message codec methods are usually designed based on one of these technologies. This thesis introduces a new codec approach that combines the two technologies. Based on the properties of the human vision and the traditional cryptography, messages are graphically encoded and hidden into the picture displayed on an LCD screen. The mes-sage recovery and decoding are achieved through manipulating the corresponding picture captured by a digital camera, using digital image processing methods based on machine vision.
