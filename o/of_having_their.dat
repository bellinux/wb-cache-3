5|$|The GDR's {{government}} nonetheless remained {{opposed to}} emigration {{and sought to}} dissuade would-be émigrés. The process of applying for an exit permit was deliberately made slow, demeaning, frustrating and often fruitless. Applicants were marginalised, demoted or sacked from their jobs, excluded from universities and subjected to ostracism. They faced the threat <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>their</b> children taken into state custody {{on the grounds that}} they were unfit to bring up children. The law was used to punish those who continued to apply for emigration; over 10,000applicants were arrested by the Stasi between the 1970s and 1989.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, Youngblood was a Second-team All-pro {{selection}} {{and went to}} the first of his seven Pro Bowls and led the Rams with 16½ sacks. The Ram defense led the NFL in fewest yards allowed and fewest rushing yards. He was voted the Rams defensive lineman {{of the year by the}} Rams Alumni Association. Beginning in the 1973 season, the Rams added the unrelated Jim Youngblood to its roster, so from that time on, both Youngbloods had the unique distinction <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>their</b> entire name on the back of their jerseys, the given name appearing above the family name. The following year, 1974, the Rams again led the NFL in rushing defense and Youngblood led the Rams with 15 sacks while being voted a consensus First-team All-Pro. The Rams advanced to the NFC Championship game, losing 14-10 to the Minnesota Vikings.|$|E

Seven players have had the honor <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>their</b> uniform number officially retired from play; {{one of them is}} Yzerman, who played for the Red Wings from 1983 to 2006, and was the longest-serving captain in North American major league sports, with a tenure of 19 years. Yzerman led his team to three Stanley Cups and was the recipient of several awards, including the Ted Lindsay Award and Lester Patrick Trophy for his outstanding play and contributions to the sport.

5|$|Timid and skittish, the {{blacktip reef shark}} is {{difficult}} to approach and seldom poses a danger to humans unless roused by food. However, people wading through shallow water are at risk <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>their</b> legs mistakenly bitten. This shark is used for its meat, fins, and liver oil, but is {{not considered to be}} a commercially significant species. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed the blacktip reef shark as Near Threatened. Although the species as a whole remains widespread and relatively common, overfishing of this slow-reproducing shark has led to its decline at a number of locales.|$|E
5|$|With the {{republic}} suffering heavy losses after the war, Stalin allowed an open immigration policy in Armenia; the diaspora {{were invited to}} repatriate to Armenia (nergaght) and revitalize the country's population and bolster its workforce. Armenians living {{in countries such as}} Cyprus, France, Greece, Iraq, Lebanon, and Syria were primarily the survivors or the descendants of the genocide. They were offered the option <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>their</b> expenses paid by the Soviet government for their trip back to their homeland. An estimated 150,000Armenians immigrated to Soviet Armenia between 1946 and 1948 and settled in Yerevan, Leninakan, Kirovakan and other towns.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{especially}} controversial {{aspect of}} female perpetrated IPV is {{the theory of}} [...] "battered husband syndrome." [...] In light {{of the findings of}} the U.S. National Family Violence Survey in 1975, Suzanne K. Steinmetz wrote an article in 1977 in which she coined the term as a correlative to [...] "battered wife syndrome." [...] Steinmetz conducted several empirical investigations prior to writing her article. Using a broad-based non-representative sample of fifty-four couples, Steinmetz found male perpetrated IPV at a rate of 47% and female perpetrated IPV at a rate of 43%. She further found that while 39% <b>of</b> husbands <b>had</b> thrown objects, 31% <b>of</b> wives <b>had</b> done likewise; 31% <b>of</b> husbands <b>had</b> pushed or shoved their partner, compared to 32% of wives; 20% <b>of</b> husbands <b>had</b> hit <b>their</b> wives, 20% <b>of</b> wives <b>had</b> hit <b>their</b> husbands; 10% <b>of</b> husbands <b>had</b> hit <b>their</b> wives with an object, 10% <b>of</b> wives <b>had</b> hit <b>their</b> husbands with an object. In another study, using a sample of fifty-two Canadian college students, Steinmetz found male perpetrated IPV at a rate of 23% and female perpetrated IPV at a rate of 21%. Further investigation found that 21% of both husbands and wives had thrown objects; 17% <b>of</b> husbands <b>had</b> pushed or shoved, compared to 13% of wives; 13% <b>of</b> husbands <b>had</b> hit <b>their</b> wives, 13% <b>of</b> wives <b>had</b> hit <b>their</b> husbands; 10% <b>of</b> husbands <b>had</b> hit <b>their</b> wives with an object, 12% <b>of</b> wives <b>had</b> hit <b>their</b> husbands with an object. In a third study, using a random sample of ninety-four people, Steinmetz found male perpetrated IPV at a rate of 32% and female perpetrated IPV at a rate of 28%. Further investigation found that 31% <b>of</b> husbands <b>had</b> thrown objects compared to 25% of wives; 22% <b>of</b> husbands <b>had</b> pushed or shoved, compared to 18% of wives; 17% <b>of</b> husbands <b>had</b> hit <b>their</b> wives, 12% <b>of</b> wives <b>had</b> hit <b>their</b> husbands; 12% <b>of</b> husbands <b>had</b> hit <b>their</b> wives with an object, 14% <b>of</b> wives <b>had</b> hit <b>their</b> husbands with an object.|$|R

He leads the team to the flight deck of the ship, where he awakens and speaks with the Engineer, who reacts by decapitating him and killing {{the rest of the}} team, save for Shaw. David's severed head watches from the floor as the Engineer launches the ship and attempts to embark for Earth. After the ship is disabled by Prometheus getting purposefully crashed into it, David warns Shaw that the Engineer is coming for her. David contacts Shaw after she escapes the Engineer and convinces her to retrieve his head and body, so that he may pilot another ship. Shaw dictates that she will cooperate with him if he takes them to the Engineer home world, which he agrees to, despite not understanding her motivations. Together, they depart from the moon aboard an Engineer ship.|$|E
