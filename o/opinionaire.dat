40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effect of formal pre-student teaching experiences on the anxiety level and performance of groups of beginning student teachers in the elementary school. Student teaching has been recognized as a crucial period in the life of a prospective teacher. It is considered a time when theory should be constantly tested by practice and practice should be constantly viewed in the light of theory. Critics of teacher education programs find little evidence of a balance between theoretical and practical experiences in the preparation of teachers. Increasing numbers of colleges and universities are providing prospective student teachers with integrated formal programs specifically designed to offer supervised classroom teaching experiences prior to student teaching. These formal pre-student teaching experiences set the stage for deeper understanding of the teaching role and integration of theory with practice. A total of 257 subjects participated in the study. One-hundred fifty-nine subjects had formal pre-student teaching experiences, and 98 subjects did not have formal pre-student teaching experiences. The subjects were selected from three state-supported universities in Indiana. Two instruments were utilized to measure the constructs of anxiety and performance. The Teaching Anxiety Scale was administered to each student teacher prior to the classroom teaching experience. The Performance <b>Opinionaire</b> was completed by each student teacher's classroom supervisor approximately six weeks through the student teaching period. The data collected were subjected to t-tests in order to determine if there were statistically significant differences between mean scores for both groups on both instruments. Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients were computed to determine significant correlation between level of anxiety and performance of the two groups. There was evidence that the groups did not differ significantly with regard to anxiety level or performance. Anxiety level did not correlate with performance as measured by the Teaching Anxiety Scale or the Performance <b>Opinionaire.</b> According to this study, the effects of formal pre-student teaching experiences were not apparent in the constructs of anxiety and performance, as measured by the Teaching Anxiety Scale and the Performance <b>Opinionaire.</b> Based on the findings of the study, it appears that other factors not measured in the study are in operation.

40|$|Extensive {{research}} has been conducted to determine the degree of satisfaction among workers in various categories of the working force. Educational researchers have become increasingly interested in determining not only the degree of job satisfaction among teachers, but also the sources of teacher job satisfaction and dissatisfaction. One of the most controversial issues in contemporary education is the increased tendency to construct schools with open-space designs. Of great concern to many people are the effects that architectural changes and resulting conditions have on teachers. Heretofore, studies involving open-space schools have been largely interested in the effects on pupil self concept, personality, and achievement. Few systematic and analytic {{attempts have been made to}} assess evaluations by teachers concerning the impact of open-space design on job satisfaction. The purpose of this study is to determine the degree of job satisfaction of teachers in two dissimilar elementary school settings, the open-space and the self-contained. The experimental design involved dissemination of The Purdue Teacher <b>Opinionaire</b> to 76 elementary classroom teachers from four predominantly open-space schools and 85 teachers from four predominantly traditional schools. Each of the eight schools is located in Delaware County, Indiana. Teacher participation was strictly voluntary. Those wishing to participate in the study were given five full school days in which to respond to-the <b>opinionaire.</b> There were two major hypotheses tested. Hypothesis I proposed that there would be no significant difference between the proportion of teachers responding from open-space schools and traditional schools. A formula by Glass and Stanley was used to test the equality of group proportions. Hypothesis II and all of its sub-hypotheses proposed that there would be no significant difference between teachers in open-space and traditional schools regarding the degree of job satisfaction as measured by The Purdue Teacher <b>Opinionaire.</b> Data for these hypotheses were analyzed by means of a One-Way Multivariate Analysis of Variance (Manova). No significant difference was found in the proportion of teachers responding from open-space and traditional schools. The null hypothesis of no significant difference between teachers regarding degree of job satisfaction as measured by The Purdue Teacher <b>Opinionaire</b> was rejected. The only variable contributing to this rejection was that of "Rapport Among Teachers. " Data analysis revealed that teachers from traditional schools responded more positively to this variable than did teachers from open-space schools. Although no significant difference was found to exist between the two groups of teachers regarding either of the remaining five factors analyzed, teachers from traditional schools responded more positively to four of the five factors than did teachers from open-space schools. Suggestions for further research include consideration of whether or not teachers are teaching in a school by choice or by chance; consideration of data pertaining to factors such as sex, age, years of teaching experience, and number of years teaching in a particular type of school structure; and a similar study involving a greater number of subjects from a wider geographic area.

A mailed <b>opinionaire</b> consisting of 111 items in 13 categories of office skills and knowledges was sent to a nationwide mailing list of 695. A total of 309 usable responses were received for a total return of 44. 5 percent. Respondents were asked to indicate whether each item on the <b>opinionaire</b> was needed at all, needed for entry level, needed for advancement, or needed for both entry and advancement for the decade of the 1980 s and the decade of the 1990 s. The results were presented in percentage and numerical frequency distributions for each of the five groups surveyed. The groups were then combined into educator and non-educator groupings and the responses tested for differences of opinion for the 1980 's office and for differences of opinion for the 1990 's office using a Chi square statistic (significance =. 05) within the groups and between the groups and for consistencies of their differences of opinion between the 1980 s and the 1990 s within the groups and between the two groups. In testing the hypotheses which stated there were no differences between or within the educator and non-educator groups for the 1980 s and/or the 1990 s, considerable differences were found between and within the groups for most of the hypotheses. Overall, the greatest differences between the 1980 s and the 1990 s were predicted for the categories of Word Processing, Shorthand, and Data Processing. Educators saw more differences between the 1980 s and the 1990 s than the non-educators.

Generation of data was accomplished through use of the Purdue Teacher <b>Opinionaire.</b> All 86 Lee County substitutes and 109 of the 329 Lee County regular classroom teachers participated in this study. The design of the study called for completion of the Purdue Teacher <b>Opinionaire</b> by each of the respondents. Similarities and contrasts were made in terms of each group's overall job satisfaction as well as job satisfaction levels reflected in the ten factors related to the job of teaching. Job satisfaction levels were analyzed in terms of the ages, teaching levels and educational training of the sample groups' members. Differences in job satisfaction scores were considered significant at the. 05 level. Opinionnaires were mailed to the two sample groups along with self-addressed, stamped envelopes. Two follow-up reminders were used; these resulted in a final opinionnaire return of 84 percent. Results of this study indicated that significant main effect differences existed between the substitute and regular classroom teacher groups on the five factors of "Rapport Among Teachers," "Teacher Salary," "Teacher Status," "Community Support of Education," and "School Facilities and Services" when analyzed by group and ages. There were significant interactions between type of teacher (regular and substitute) and age on the variables of "Curriculum Issues" and "Teacher Status.

40|$|Graduation date 1972 :The {{purpose of}} the study was to develop {{guidelines}} for the establishing and teaching of a home economics program within a standard, non-laboratory classroom. An <b>opinionaire</b> was developed and sent to 34 administrators of small high schools and junior high schools in Oregon believed to have no home economics programs in their schools. The <b>opinionaire</b> was designed to ascertain reasons for the lack of home economics in the curricula of these schools and to determine attitudes of administrators concerning home economics-related needs of students. From the replies received from 27 respondents, 13 full or partial programs were noted to be already in effect, leaving 14 completed opinionaires to be used in the study. Eleven of the 14 administrators requested a copy of the guidelines for a home economics program to be taught in a standard classroom. The two main reasons for having no home economics programs in the schools were a lack of money and having no teacher available. The administrators rated the importance of nine areas within the home economics curriculum with the highest rating shown for consumer education, personal and family finance. The other areas of home economics were rated high in importance with housing, home furnishings and household equipment and the occupational area receiving the most negative responses. The administrators believed home economics to be of greatest importance to girls of all ages and of all ability levels. They felt home economics was important as compared with other school subjects except for boys of the 12 to 13 age group. Guidelines were developed to encompass current trends in home economics and the Oregon Homemaking Education curriculum guide. Included were guidelines for every area rated by the administrators as being high in importance within the home economics curriculum. Some of the guidelines were drawn from the writer's experience in teaching a home economics program within a standard, non-laboratory classroom. These guidelines were sent to 30 home economics teachers in small Oregon high schools for examination and evaluation. Nineteen evaluations were returned with comments, questions and suggestions. The evaluation of the guidelines consisted of two sections. Section I requested information concerning educational background, other subjects taught and number of years experience in teaching home economics. Section II sought examination and evaluation of the guidelines as to their clarity and their adaptability toward meeting the objectives of the Oregon Homemaking Education curriculum. The evaluation of the guidelines by home economics teachers showed the majority as being receptive to the program. Teachers who had taught from two to five years offered the most comments. Classes taught by the respondents ranged from grade seven to twelve, with over four-fifths of the group teaching other subjects besides home economics. The areas receiving the most comments and questions were in the food preparation and sewing units. Guidelines were revised and clarified in accordance with suggestions made by the respondents. Flexible use of small appliances and mobile units, pre-planned programs for the efficient use of time, evaluation of choices and alternatives all can be coordinated with the guidelines to provide a workable, low-cost home economics program which can be established and taught within a standard, non-laboratory classroom...|$|E

Instruments used to gather the perceptions of prekindergarten to sixth-grade classroom teachers were the Organizational Health Inventory (OHI-E) for elementary schools and the Purdue Teacher <b>Opinionaire</b> (PTO). Sub factors on the OHI-E were institutional integrity, collegial leadership, resource influence, teacher affiliation, and academic emphasis. Factors on the PTO were rapport with principal, satisfaction with teaching, rapport among teachers, teacher salary, teacher load, curriculum issues, teacher status, community support, school facilities and services, and community pressures. The inferential statistics used in the data analysis included t tests, Kruskal-Wallis ANOVAs, planned comparisons using chi-square analyses, and Pearson’s r. The OHI-E revealed that overall school health in the district and schools should not be based solely upon an overall health index, but should take into account individual sub factors. The PTO revealed that overall teacher morale in the district and individual schools was relatively consistent and positive {{as a result of}} teachers’ relationships with their respective principals. Principals supported teachers despite the many challenges faced in the district.

40|$|Graduation date: 1978 The {{general purpose}} of this study was to {{investigate}} the question: Is unionization disruptive of intra-institutional relationships on community college campuses ? The introduction of faculty unions into the college community is often perceived, even by proponents, as a process which engenders hostility and disruption. Social conflict theory is the framework within which this study examines this question of unions and their alleged disruption of institutional relationships. The Purdue Teacher <b>Opinionaire</b> (PTO) is the data gathering instrument used to derive and organize the empirical aspects of the problem. The data collected with the PTO were computed using a two-way analysis of variance, F statistic, to test the following hypotheses: 1. There is no significant difference in morale between union and non-union faculty. 2. There is no significant difference in morale between campuses. 3. There is no significant interaction effect between campuses and membership. The calculations of the two-way analysis of variance test showed no significant differences or interaction effect for overall PTO morale score, or for five of the PTO factors. However, the five following factors were computed to have significant differences or interaction effects: "Rapport with Administrators, " "Satisfaction with Teaching, " "Rapport among Teachers, " "Teacher Salary, " and "School Facilities and Services. " The conclusions of this study are that faculty unions have become interest groups within the college organization. The unequal distribution of power and authority gives rise to faculty unions. Conflict between faculty unions and college administrators is normal, and is beneficial to the resolution of differences. Finally, collegial relationships between administrators and faculty are difficult because collegiality is a relationship that exists between group members that share ideas, goals and values...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{determine}} if there were significant differences in the levels of job satisfaction of teachers of the deaf in residential and day school/class programs. Four selected subpopulations of these teachers were also compared. The Purdue Teacher <b>Opinionaire</b> was utilized to obtain teacher perceptions of job satisfaction. A questionnaire was utilized to obtain demographic data. Five major null hypothesis were tested by the multivariate and univariate analysis of variance. Findings 1. Day school/class and residential school teachers of the deaf were found to be significantly different in levels of job satisfaction. 2. Male and female teachers of the deaf were found to be significantly different in levels of job satisfaction. 3. Normal hearing teachers of the deaf and deaf teachers of the deaf were found to be significantly different in levels of job satisfaction. 4. Teachers of the deaf in various age groups were found to be significantly different in levels of job satisfaction. 5. Teachers of the deaf with daily contact with deaf colleagues and those without daily contact with deaf colleagues were found to be significantly different in levels of job satisfaction. Conclusions 1. The type of school (residential or day) does have an influence on job satisfaction levels of teachers of the deaf. 2. There are significant differences in levels of job satisfaction between the following subgroups of teachers of the deaf: male and female; hearing and deaf; age ranges 20 - 25, 26 - 35, 36 - 45, and over 45; and teachers with daily contact with deaf colleagues and teachers without daily contact with deaf colleagues.

40|$|Study aim was {{to assess}} the {{applicability}} of a propose modification of the cardinal vital signs graph by adding pain as the fifth vital signs. This exploratory descriptive study was conducted between May and June 2009 on a convenience sample of 40 nurses working in general surgery and orthopedic departments at King Khaled University University Hospital, Riyadh {{during the time of the}} study. Two assessment tools were used to collect data, namely an <b>opinionaire</b> form for nurses, and an audit sheet for nurses' application of the proposed modification. Nurses were informed about the use of the new graph, and their performance was assessed through auditing patients' proposed graphic chart three times for each of them. Results : Nurses' age ranged between 21 and 53 years,and their mean (SD) experience was 12. 9 (7. 2) years. The majority of the nurses agreed upon chart feasibility (72. 5 %), its positive impact on communication about pain (85. 0 %), and its consistency (97. 5 %). Overall, 87. 5 % of the nurses agreed upon the new change. Agreement was negatively and statistically significantly correlated to nurse age (r= - 0. 45, p= 0. 003) and experience years (r= - 0. 41, p= 0. 009). Auditing of patients' files revealed full application of the new change by 95. 0 % of the nurses for the graphic part, and hy 75. 0 % of them for the pain assessment part. In total, 75. 0 % of the nurses had full application of the change. It is concluded that the proposed change is applicable, and its recommended to be implemented in similar settings for further confirmation of its utility in patient care...|$|E
40|$|A {{pervasive}} issue facing today’s {{educational environment}} is teacher morale in schools. Recognizing that teacher morale in urban schools {{is an area}} of concern, and the behavior of the principals may be a contributing factor, the primary purpose of this quantitative research study was to analyze and measure the relationship between principal leadership practices and teacher morale in urban schools. The research questions focused on the relationship between principal leadership practices and teacher morale, significant differences among schools in reference to principal leadership practices, significant differences among schools in reference to teacher morale, and the principal leadership practices that had the highest and lowest mean scores in reference to teachers who had high morale and teachers who had low morale. The Transformational Leadership Theory, which focuses on the leader enhancing the motivation, morale and performance of their follower group, was utilized as the conceptual framework. A total of 101 teachers (who worked in an urban school district) participated in the study by completing two surveys, the Leadership Practices Inventory (which measures principal leadership practices) and the Purdue Teacher <b>Opinionaire</b> (which measures teacher morale). 	The results showed that the leadership practices of principals were not related to teacher morale, in the urban schools in this study. The findings showed that teachers believed their principals were fairly supportive. However, curricular issues and teacher salary were the two key factors that were contributing to low teacher morale. Additionally, teacher load, teacher status in the community, community support, school facilities and community pressures were contributing to low teacher morale, as well. Based on the findings in this study, the assumption could be made that central office administrators, along with school board officials may be a contributing factor that has affected the decision-making process of the principals and teachers; which in turn has negatively affected teacher morale. Implications from the findings suggest that the urban school district in this study move towards implementing the transformational leadership theory with fidelity. Current and prior research studies have shown the positive effects of this model. Implementation of transformational leadership strategies would assist teachers, principals, and central office administrators to improve morale in urban schools...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1984 The {{purpose of}} this study was to gather participant/ campus data, and to measure morale and {{teaching}} faculty participation in institutional governance on the 107 California public community college campuses to determine if collective bargaining faculty have statistically higher or lower morale and greater or lesser participation in institutional governance. In doing this, it was also an objective to determine whether morale and participation were significantly related to one another, or to participant/ campus data, or to collective bargaining in order to originate a theory which would predict the establishment of collective bargaining. The Purdue Teacher <b>Opinionaire</b> was used to measure morale and the Questionnaire on Faculty Participation in College and University Government was used to measure faculty participation in institutional governance. The results were compiled and analyzed using two one-way ANOVAs, Chi-Square Analysis, and Multiple Regression. With a random sample of 424 full-time teaching faculty and a return of 297 questionnaires, or 70. 05 percent, the following conclusions were reached using the. 05 significance level: 1. Morale of collective bargaining teaching faculty was reported as less than those who were not under collective bargaining, although the difference was not statistically significant, so no conclusions could be drawn. 2. Faculty participation was reported as slightly higher by faculty who had entered into a collective bargaining contract, although the difference was not statistically significant, so no conclusions could be drawn. 3. There was a moderate relationship between morale and participation in governance, and although there was a higher correlation for collective bargaining respondents, the difference was not statistically significant and no conclusions could be drawn. 4. The teaching areas of community service and developmental/remedial/ABE were related to collective bargaining. Both of these results may have been factors of location, however, rather than causal. The multi-campus districts were much more likely to be organized for collective bargaining. 5. No predictive theory was warranted regarding collective bargaining since the relationship between morale and participation in governance was statistically nonsignificant. The conclusions of this study did not indicate any clear benefits to organizing for collective bargaining because the data were statistically non-significant...|$|E

Research indicates that high teacher morale contributes significantly to the quality of school programs. The {{purpose of this study was}} to see whether teacher transfer affects teacher morale. Three teacher groups were established in the study: Group A, teachers awaiting transfer; Group B, teachers already transferred; and Group C, teachers who will not transfer. The instrument used for this investigation was the Purdue Teacher <b>Opinionaire,</b> which categorizes morale into ten identifiable factors and a total morale score. In addition, demographic information was gathered. Building principals distributed the materials, instructions, and collected the data. The research was conducted near the city of Chicago in a suburban elementary school district. After many years of record growth, student enrollments in the school district began to decline significantly, resulting in the board of education's decision to close two elementary buildings and to release some teachers and transfer others at the end of the 1979 - 80 school year. All data collected to establish groups, measure teacher morale, and sort the demographic information from the teachers was keypunched and analyzed by computer, using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). Statistical processing was done through analysis of variance, with F tests applied to analyze variance in response. The alpha point was set at the. 05 level. Results were analyzed to determine whether there was a relationship between the groups established for the study and morale. Based on an analysis of the findings, it was concluded that there was a relationship between the groups established for the study and teacher morale. In all cases, teachers awaiting transfer showed higher morale than teachers already transferred and teachers who will not transfer, and teachers already transferred showed higher morale than teachers who will not transfer. Ten of the eleven factors of morale were affected: Rapport With Principal, Satisfaction With Teaching, Rapport Among Teachers, Teacher Salary, Teacher Load, Curriculum Issues, Teacher Status, Community Support, and Community Pressures; School Facilities and Services being the exception. Morale is important to a school system's effectiveness. School administrators charged with the responsibility of maintaining staff morale and program quality during periods of declining enrollments must consider this study. The results will be useful as they prepare for teacher transfers...|$|E

A copy of each of these tests will be found in the Appendix. The first four tests were designed for the College Study in Intergroup Relations. 2 ̆ 2 A Test of Knowledge of Intergroup Relations 2 ̆ 2 was chosen as the basic test. It consists of one hundred questions which relate to five major areas and five types of knowledge. The areas represented a. re race relations, intercreedal problems, immigrant cultures, rural-urban contacts, and socioeconomic (class) differences. The types of knowledge represented are concepts and definitions, present status, history and trends, current problems, and proposed solutions.

40|$|Graduation date: 1974 Purpose of the Study The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if upper division, undergraduate, elementary education students would demonstrate a significant change in self-actualization as measured by the Personal Orientation Inventory following instruction in five (5) communication skills (paraphrasing, behavior description, description of own feelings, perception checking, feedback of information). Procedures A total of 136 students participated in experimental and control groups during the Fall and Winter terms of 1972 - 1973. All students were placed in two field practicum blocks, four and one-half days per week. Staff Associates (superior students selected each term) served approximately three days per week as liaisons in participating public elementary schools, and participated in staff planning meetings and methods seminars. The experimental students and Staff Associates participated in five communication skills seminars facilitated by the investigator. In addition, all experimental students participated in five building meetings facilitated by the Staff Associates. Each phase of experimental procedure was held on alternating weeks each term of the investigation. A pre- and post administration of the Personal Orientation Inventory was completed by all participants. The I (Inner-Directed) Scale was utilized in a one way analysis of variance and covariance with results significant at the. 05 level. An investigator devised Descriptive Data <b>Opinionaire</b> was also utilized to obtain subjective data from each participant. Results and Implications From the results of the study, the following implications were drawn: 1. The five communication skills seminars and building meetings were not effective suggesting additional existing measuring instruments being utilized, a new measurement instrument be devised, and encounter group procedures be introduced into the program. 2. Earlier introduction of self development and follow up application in each participant's program was needed to allow student confirmation and maximum chance for statistical significance. 3. Strong support existed for preparation in communication skills. This suggested procedures utilized were purposeful, meaningful to the individual, and perhaps a necessary tool to be included in future curriculum planning. 4. In order to maintain and expand personalization and individualization of the Junior Block, additional time, faculty effort, and affective programming was needed. Recommendations From the implications of the study, the following recommendations were offered to further assist research in this area: 1. Individual building meetings and communication skills training should become an integral part of the Junior Block program. 2. Schools of Education should introduce or continue to develop teacher preparation programs that focus on affective as well as cognitive curricula. 3. Additional research should be implemented into the use of communication skills training as a significant influence in development toward self-actualization. 4. A replication of this investigation be done with a new investigator and a larger sample utilizing the same experimental design, to affirm or negate findings. 5. All present participants be administered the measuring instrument at the conclusion of student teaching to measure additional post-test gains. 6. Additional analysis of present data be completed to determine strengths and weaknesses of individual students in particular areas of self-actualization. 7. Additional analysis of present data be completed to determine any correlation between students and Staff Associates post-test score and grades received, and recommendations by teachers...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1975 Industry, business, {{military}} {{and other government}} agencies are increasingly recognizing the significance of human factors in the productivity of complex organizations. Educational institutions are no exception to this fact. It is assumed that morale and productivity {{are related to the}} managerial style of the supervisor. Leaders are faced with the challenge of directing the work group toward the target of increased productivity {{while at the same time}} maximizing member satisfaction. The basic research problem of this study was to investigate the relationship between leadership style of high school principals (in terms of their Concern for Production and Concern for People) and certain dimensions of teacher morale. The null hypothesis which guided this study was that there was no significant relationship between teacher perceptions of administrative behavior and teacher morale. A stratified random sampling technique was used to select 132 teachers from ten high schools in the state of Oregon. The results are based on 126 returns, 90 male and 36 female respondents. Principal Leadership Style Questionnaire was used to measure two dimensions (Concern for People and Concern for Production) of administrative behavior. Purdue Teacher <b>Opinionaire</b> was used to measure ten factors of teacher morale. All hypotheses were tested at. 05 level of confidence. The first primary hypothesis asserting that there would be no partial correlation between administrative dimensions and Teacher Rapport with Principal was rejected. The second primary hypothesis that there would be no partial correlation between administrative dimensions and Satisfaction with Teaching was accepted. Partial correlation was 4 ppliedto analyze the primary hypotheses by eliminating the effects of secondary hypotheses (Rapport Among Teachers, Teacher Salary, Teacher Load, Curriculum Issues, Teacher Status, Community Support of Education, School Facilities, Community Pressures, Age and Sex). T-test based on regression coefficients was applied to analyze the secondary hypotheses. Out of 20 secondary hypotheses tested, five of them were rejected. Analysis of the primary and secondary hypotheses concluded that Curriculum Issues, Rapport with Principal and Teacher Salary are positively related to both the dimensions of administrative behavior. Rapport Among Teachers was positively related to Concern for People but not Production. Satisfaction with Teaching, Teacher Load, Teacher Status, Community Support of Education, School Facilities and Services, Community Pressures, Age and Sex of the teachers are not related to the perceived leadership style of the principal. Teachers Satisfaction with Teaching is probably related mostly to those things that happen directly with pupils inside the classroom over which principals have little influence. Results of the two administrative dimensions indicated that a principal's leadership behavior is perceived by his faculty in various ways. However, on the average, administrators were rated high on both the "Production" and "People" dimensions of administrative behavior and perceived as having a " 6, 7 " or " 7, 8 " leadership style as described by Blake and Mouton (1964). Analysis of this research further suggest that educational administrators investigated in this study seem to have above average skills in the eyes of their faculty in promoting both goal achievement and member satisfaction. It is recommended that the design of this study be replicated on a larger teacher population and sample size in different geographical areas...|$|E
