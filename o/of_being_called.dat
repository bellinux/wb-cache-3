5|$|In {{the face}} of a looming crisis in his career, Wills {{admitted}} to throwing in his 1870–71 Australian Cricketers' Guide, and in so doing taunted his enemies to stop him. Nonetheless, he was made Victoria XI captain for the March 1871 intercolonial against New South Wales, held at the Albert Ground. Wills' first innings top score of 39* was offset by his drunken behaviour in the field and his apparent reluctance to bowl for fear <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>called.</b> Victoria won by 48 runs. Not long after, Wills was no-balled for throwing {{for the first time in}} a club match. Rumour spread that the umpire had conspired against him with the opposing club's owner.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{thinks that}} no matter where it is speculated to be, if Planet Nine exists, then its mass is higher than what is {{required}} to clear its feeding zone in 4.6 billion years, and thus that it dominates {{the outer edge of}} the Solar System, which is sufficient to make it a planet by current definitions. Using a metric based on work by Jean-Luc Margot, Brown calculated that only at the smallest size and farthest distance was it on the border <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>called</b> a dwarf planet. Margot himself says that Planet Nine satisfies the quantitative criterion for orbit-clearing developed by him in 2015, and that according to that criterion, Planet Nine will qualify as a planet—if and when it is detected.|$|E

Pam's lack of specific instructions leaves Erin in a state of indecision over whether she should put the pens away once they arrive. She eventually decides to put them away for fear <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>called</b> lazy, but as she does so the other office workers teasingly accuse her of trying to take over Pam's job of office administrator in her absence.

5|$|The King of Sparta– Featured in God of War comic #6. The King's Guard was {{convinced}} by Kratos' wife Lysandra to allow Kratos {{to embark on}} a quest for the Ambrosia that would restore their plague-stricken daughter, Calliope. Kratos and his men were given until the next full moon to return before the King executed his daughter. Ultimately successful, Kratos returned, saved Calliope, and gave the rest of the elixir to the King. The King then officially awarded Kratos with the rank of Captain. The King of Sparta also appears as an illusion created by Tisiphone in Ascension where he honors Kratos for his service as his best general. Kratos believed what he was seeing at first until he saw Tisiphone's ring on the king's finger. He kicked Tisiphone off the balcony, dispelling her illusion. When Kratos {{was on the verge of}} victory over the Furies, Tisiphone changed into the form of the King once again, telling him that he was unworthy <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>called</b> a Spartan. The character was voiced by Crispin Freeman in Ascension.|$|E

Following Gomez's meeting with the Sultan, Gomez sought treatment to his face and stomach. Subsequently, he lodged a police report against the Sultan for assault. Gomez elaborated that the Sultan bodyguards, members of the Johor Military Force personnel, were merely onlookers, and that the Sultan was solely responsible for the injuries.|$|E

25|$|One {{source of}} {{evidence}} for hiring discrimination against openly gay men comes from a field experiment that sent two fictitious but realistic resumes to roughly 1,700 entry-level job openings. The two resumes were very similar {{in terms of the}} applicant's qualifications, but one resume for each opening mentioned that the applicant had been part of a gay organization in college. The results showed that applicants without the gay signal had an 11.5 percent chance <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>called</b> for an interview; openly gay applicants had only a 7.2 percent chance. The callback gap varied widely according to the location of the job. Most of the overall gap detected in the study was driven by the Southern and Midwestern states in the sample – Texas, Florida, and Ohio. The Western and Northeastern states in the sample (California, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and New York) had only small and statistically insignificant callback gaps.|$|E
