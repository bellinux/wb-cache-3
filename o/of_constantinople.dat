5|$|The West {{responded with}} the Crusades, {{eventually}} {{resulting in the}} Sack <b>of</b> <b>Constantinople</b> by participants in the Fourth Crusade. The conquest <b>of</b> <b>Constantinople</b> in 1204 fragmented {{what remained of the}} Empire into successor states, the ultimate victor being that of Nicaea. After the recapture <b>of</b> <b>Constantinople</b> by Imperial forces, the Empire {{was little more than a}} Greek state confined to the Aegean coast. The Roman Empire finally collapsed when Mehmed the Conqueror conquered Constantinople on 29 May 1453.|$|E

5|$|Eventually, {{following}} their repeated failures before Constantinople, {{and the continued}} resilience of the Byzantine state, the Muslims began to project the fall <b>of</b> <b>Constantinople</b> to the distant future. Thus the city's fall came {{to be regarded as}} one of the signs of the arrival of the end times in Islamic eschatology. The siege became a motif in Byzantine apocalyptic literature as well, with decisive final battles against the Arabs before the walls <b>of</b> <b>Constantinople</b> being featured in the early 8th-century Greek translation of the Syriac Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius and the Apocalypse of Daniel, written either at about the time of the siege or a century later.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of Theodore's background; he is {{recorded}} as being born a Roman, {{and the son of}} Photios I <b>of</b> <b>Constantinople,</b> who was the Patriarch <b>of</b> <b>Constantinople.</b> His brother Theodosius (or Theosius) was also a bishop. He was ordained as a priest by Stephen V. The exact dates of his papal reign are unknown, but modern sources generally agree that he was pope for twenty days during December 897. Flodoard, a tenth-century French chronicler, only credited Theodore with a twelve-day reign, while in his history of the popes, Alexis-François Artaud de Montor listed Theodore's reign as being twenty days, from 12 February to 3 March 898.|$|E
5|$|Maximus' {{refusal to}} accept Monothelitism {{caused him to}} be brought to the {{imperial}} capital <b>of</b> <b>Constantinople</b> to be tried as a heretic in 658. In Constantinople, Monothelitism had gained the favor of both the Emperor and the Patriarch <b>of</b> <b>Constantinople.</b> Maximus stood behind the Dyothelite position and was sent back into exile for four more years. During his trial he was accused of aiding the Muslim conquests in Egypt and North Africa, which he rejected as slander.|$|E

5|$|The Bulgarians, who by 922 were {{in control}} {{of most of the}} Balkans, {{continued}} to ravage the Byzantine countryside virtually unopposed. However, they lacked the maritime power to conduct a successful siege <b>of</b> <b>Constantinople.</b> The subsequent attempts to negotiate a Bulgarian–Arab alliance for a joint assault <b>of</b> <b>Constantinople</b> were discovered by the Byzantines and successfully countered. The strategic situation in the Balkans remained unchanged until both sides signed a peace treaty in 927, which recognized the imperial title of the Bulgarian monarchs and the complete independence of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church as an autocephalous Patriarchate.|$|E
5|$|The Ottoman Minister of the Interior Talaat Pasha {{gave the}} {{detention}} order on 24 April 1915. The operation commenced at 8 p.m. In Constantinople, {{the action was}} led by Bedri Bey, the Chief of Police <b>of</b> <b>Constantinople.</b> On the night of 24–25 April 1915, in a first wave 235 to 270 Armenian leaders <b>of</b> <b>Constantinople,</b> clergymen, physicians, editors, journalists, lawyers, teachers, politicians, and others were arrested upon an instruction of the Ministry of the Interior. The differences in number {{may be explained by}} the uncertainties of the police as they imprisoned people with the same names.|$|E
5|$|The Persians seem to {{have been}} {{reluctant}} to resort to naval action. There was some minor Sasanian naval action in 620-23, and the only major Byzantine navy's action was during the Siege <b>of</b> <b>Constantinople</b> (626).|$|E

5|$|The Walls <b>of</b> <b>Constantinople</b> are {{a series}} of {{defensive}} stone walls that have surrounded and protected the city <b>of</b> <b>Constantinople</b> (today Istanbul in Turkey) since its founding as the new capital of the Roman Empire by Constantine the Great.

5|$|With {{the spread}} of Christianity Coracesium, as it was called, became a bishopric. Its bishop Theodulus {{took part in the}} First Council <b>of</b> <b>Constantinople</b> in 381, Matidianus in the Council of Ephesus in 431, Obrimus in the Council of Chalcedon in 451, and Nicephorus (Nicetas) in the Third Council <b>of</b> <b>Constantinople</b> in 680. Coracesium was a suffragan of the {{metropolitan}} see of Side, the capital of the Roman province of Pamphylia Prima, to which Coracesium belonged. It continued to be mentioned in the Notitiae Episcopatuum as late as the 12th or 13th century. No longer a residential bishopric, Coracesium is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.|$|E
5|$|After {{the passage}} of Tehcir Law on 29 May 1915, Armenians left at the two holding centers were {{deported}} to Ottoman Syria. Most of the arrested were transferred from Central Prison over Saray Burnu by steamer No. 67 of the Şirket company to the Haydarpaşa train station. After waiting for ten hours, they were sent by special train {{in the direction of}} Ankara the next day. The entire convoy consisted of 220 Armenians. An Armenian train conductor got a list of names of the deportees. It was handed over to the Armenian Patriarch <b>of</b> <b>Constantinople,</b> Zaven Der Yeghiayan, who immediately tried in vain to save as many deportees as possible. The only foreign ambassador to help him in his efforts was US ambassador Henry Morgenthau. After a train journey of 20 hours, the deportees got off in Sincanköy (near Ankara) Tuesday noon. At the station Ibrahim, the director of the Central Prison <b>of</b> <b>Constantinople,</b> did the triage. The deportees were divided into two groups.|$|E

5|$|After {{the sack}} <b>of</b> <b>Constantinople</b> in 1204 by Latin crusaders, two Byzantine {{successor}} states were established: the Empire of Nicaea, and the Despotate of Epirus. A third, the Empire of Trebizond, {{was created by}} Alexios I of Trebizond {{a few weeks before}} the sack <b>of</b> <b>Constantinople.</b> Of the three successor states, Epirus and Nicaea stood the best chance of reclaiming Constantinople. The Nicaean Empire struggled to survive the next few decades, however, and by the mid-13th century it had lost much of southern Anatolia. The weakening of the Sultanate of Rûm following the Mongol invasion in 1242–43 allowed many beyliks and ghazis to set up their own principalities in Anatolia, weakening the Byzantine hold on Asia Minor. In time, one of the Beys, Osman I, created an empire that would eventually conquer Constantinople. However, the Mongol invasion also gave Nicaea a temporary respite from Seljuk attacks, allowing it to concentrate on the Latin Empire to its north.|$|E
5|$|Along with Pope Martin I, Maximus was vindicated by the Third Council <b>of</b> <b>Constantinople</b> (the Sixth Ecumenical Council, 680–681), which {{declared}} that Christ possessed both a human and a divine will.

5|$|Although the Byzantine–Bulgarian {{conflict}} {{that began in}} 913 was provoked by the Byzantines, it was the Bulgarian monarch Simeon I (r. 893–927) who was seeking pretext to wage war and fulfil his ambitions to claim an imperial title for himself and to assume the throne <b>of</b> <b>Constantinople.</b> Unable to confront the Bulgarians, the Byzantines reluctantly recognized Simeon I as Emperor of Bulgaria (in Bulgarian, Tsar) as early as July 913 but the decision was revoked after a palace coup in Constantinople in 914. Three years later, in 917, the main Byzantine forces were routed in the Battle of Achelous and the Bulgarians took the military initiative. In the four year that followed they launched a number of successful campaigns, reaching the walls <b>of</b> <b>Constantinople</b> and the Isthmus of Corinth.|$|E

Both ships were reduced to secondary duties after the war, with Coatit being converted into a minelayer in 1919 and Agordat being reduced to a gunboat in 1921.
