5|$|The 20th Panzer and 6th Infantry Divisions of the XLVII Panzer Corps, {{spearheaded the}} advance of the XLVII Panzer Corps. Behind them the {{remaining}} two panzer divisions followed, ready to exploit any breakthrough. The heavily mined terrain and fortified positions of the 15th Rifle Division slowed the advance. By 08:00 safe lanes had been cleared through the minefield. That morning information obtained from prisoner interrogation identified a weakness at the boundary of the 15th and 81st Rifle Divisions caused by the German preliminary bombardment. The Tigers were redeployed and struck towards this area. Red Army formations countered with a force of around 90 T-34s. In the resulting three-hour battle, Red Army armoured units lost 42 tanks while the Germans lost two Tigers and a further five more immobilized with track damage. While the Red Army counter-attack was defeated and the first defensive belt breached, the fighting had delayed the Germans {{long enough for the}} rest of 29th Rifle Corps of the 13th Army – initially deployed behind the first belt – to move forward and seal the breach. Red Army minefields were covered by artillery fire, making efforts to clear paths through the fields difficult and costly. Goliath and Borgward IV remote-controlled engineer mine-clearing vehicles met with limited success. Of the 653rd Heavy Panzerjäger Battalion's 45 Ferdinands sent into battle, all but 12 of them were immobilized by mine damage before 17:00. Most of these were later repaired and returned to service, but the recovery <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>very</b> large vehicles was difficult.|$|E
25|$|Several phytogeographical provinces {{converge}} here: Chaqueña, Andean, Patagonian and Magellanic. The confluence <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>very</b> diverse currents confers on {{the area}} a synthesis of microclimates which makes it unique, a uniqueness accentuated {{by the presence of}} endemic species, the number of which is probably greater than is presently known.|$|E
25|$|The {{parameterization}} <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>very</b> coarse-grained models {{must be done}} empirically, {{by matching}} {{the behavior of the}} model to appropriate experimental data or all-atom simulations. Ideally, these parameters should account for both enthalpic and entropic contributions to free energy in an implicit way. When coarse-graining is done at higher levels, the accuracy of the dynamic description may be less reliable. But very coarse-grained models have been used successfully to examine a wide range of questions in structural biology, liquid crystal organization, and polymer glasses.|$|E

25|$|The origin <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>very</b> {{elaborate}} helmets {{is uncertain}} but {{appears not to}} have been Rome. Various origins have been suggested, including a theory that they came from Rome's eastern provinces. They were produced from the early 1st century AD through to the mid-3rd century. Although they are relatively light, they appear to have been worn in battle as well as for display purposes. One such helmet was found {{at the site of the}} Battle of the Teutoburg Forest, where three Roman legions were wiped out by Germans in 9 AD. It was perhaps worn by an officer or standard-bearer who intended its imposing appearance to intimidate his enemies on the battlefield.|$|E
25|$|Under 50% of the municipality’s {{population}} is economically active, but <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>very</b> few are unemployed. Commerce and services employ {{the largest number}} of people followed by construction and mining. Agriculture is extremely limited due to the very rugged terrain. However, some crops of sorghum, alfalfa, peanuts and fruits are produced. Livestock is produced on a very small scale and includes cattle, goats and sheep. Mining is the economic activity that spurred the founding of the city. However, extraction of minerals today is minimal, with gold and silver ores almost exhausted. Kaolin and lead are still mined. Principle mining companies includes Las Torres, Santa Fe de Guanajuato and El Cubo. The most important segments of the economy now are tourism and commerce. The city’s rich cultural and artistic heritage, along with its colonial area constructions, are what attract visitors. For the rural areas around the city, it is the place to shop for supplies not available at home. This includes foods, auto parts and service, banking services and more.|$|E
25|$|With Lord Fitzwilliam, in Grosvenor Square, for {{the purpose}} of {{discussing}} the subject of a coalition with him, and of endeavouring to prevail on him to speak to Fox—Lord Fitzwilliam's sentiments perfectly right—he said his opposition never had been to the constitution of the country, but to the Government when it acted in a way he thought contrary to the constitution; that, therefore, when that was in danger he ceased to be in opposition. On going over the matter it became evident that the great obstacle would arise from Fox's being too much entangled with Grey, Lambton, and that set of men who had lately separated themselves from the party, in order to form a party of their own, and who publicly professed doctrines and opinions in direct opposition to what he and I considered to be for the good and welfare of the public. That this would indeed be very hard and unreasonable, that for the sake <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>very</b> men, who both in their public and private capacity had been as inimical as possible, an arrangement should be broken off so salutary and so advisable. Lord Fitzwilliani and myself agreed on every point; he, however, went beyond me in insisting on the indispensable necessity of Pitt resigning the Treasury for another Cabinet office. He acquiesced in the wisdom of trying to bring Fox to be less attached to these false friends, and said Tom Grenville was the best man to speak to him. Lord Fitzwilliam expressed his dislike to Sheridan, said he might have a lucrative place, but never could be admitted to one of trust and confidence. On my wishing him not to leave town, he said he could safely trust his conscience with the Duke of Portland, and was at the same time ready to return at the shortest notice.|$|E

500|$|Triptychs were {{commissioned}} by German patrons from the 1380s, with large-scale export beginning around 1400. Few <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>very</b> early examples survive, but {{the demand for}} Netherlandish altarpieces throughout Europe {{is evident from the}} many surviving examples still extant in churches across the continent. Till-Holger Borchert describes how they bestowed a [...] "prestige which, {{in the first half of}} the 15th century, only the workshops of the Burgundian Netherlands were capable of achieving". By the 1390s, Netherlandish altarpieces were produced mostly in Brussels and Bruges. The popularity of Brussels' altarpieces lasted until about 1530, when the output of the Antwerp workshops grew in favour. This was in part because they produced at a lower cost by allocating different portions of the panels among specialised workshop members, a practice Borchert describes as an early form of division of labour.|$|E
500|$|Following his debut, Kapoor {{reunited with}} Ghosh {{in a film}} he {{considered}} to be drastically different from Ishq Vishk. The thriller Fida (2004) featured him as a love-struck student who is manipulated by a woman (Kareena Kapoor) and her lover (Fardeen Khan) to rob a bank. Despite criticising the film, Rama Sharma of The Tribune wrote that Kapoor [...] "shines in his role. He looks fresh. As an impulsive emotional and innocent guy, who is sucked into crime because <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>very</b> qualities, he manages to evoke your sympathies." [...] Later that year, Kapoor appeared in the romantic comedy Dil Maange More {{in which he was}} paired opposite three women: Soha Ali Khan, Tulip Joshi, and Ayesha Takia. Patcy N of Rediff.com praised his dancing skills but was wary of his imitation of Shah Rukh Khan's acting style. Both his 2004 releases were commercially unsuccessful.|$|E

All of those decisions that the President has to make surrounding each one <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>very</b> difficult challenges are hard. They're hard decisions to make. And of course some people are unhappy about what some of those decisions are. But I think people know that he is doing what he thinks is right for the United States, that he's doing what he – especially in the war on terror, what he thinks he is obligated to do for the people in the United States, and that is to protect them...

The Meridian campaign was a [...] "dress rehearsal" [...] for the style of war against infrastructure that Sherman, {{as well as some}} <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>very</b> troops, would later practice in Georgia. To counter the threat, Confederate President Jefferson Davis ordered troops to the area from other localities, including McNair's Brigade. The Confederate commander in the area, Lieutenant General Leonidas Polk, consolidated a number of commands in and around Morton, Mississippi, but failed to stop Sherman's moves. Meridian was essentially destroy by Sherman and most of Polks forces were transferred to the Army of Tennessee in time to oppose Sherman's Atlanta Campaign.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, version B (which H. Grätz, Monatsschrift, viii. 70 et seq., {{considered}} {{as being the}} original, and the Hebrew [...] "Enoch," [...] and the [...] "Shi'ur Komah" [...] as sections of it) shows no inner unity of plan, but is simply a compilation of haggadic passages taken at random from these and other kabalistic and midrashic works without any other connection than the external order of {{the letters of the}} alphabet, but also based on Shab. 104a. Jellinek has shown the time of its composition to be comparatively modern, as is evidenced by the Arabic form of the letters and other indications of Arabic life. It has, however, become especially valuable as the depository <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>very</b> cabalistic works, which had come near falling into oblivion on account of the gross anthropomorphic views of the Godhead expressed therein, which gave offense to the more enlightened minds of a later age. It was on this account that the Alphabet of Rabbi Akiva was made an object of severe attack and ridicule by Solomon ben Jeroham, the Karaite, {{in the first half of}} the 10th century. Version A was likewise known to Judah Hadassi, the Karaite, in the 13th century (see Jellinek, B. H. iii., xvii. 5).|$|E
2500|$|In 1950 chief rabbis Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog and Ben-Zion Meir Hai Uziel {{issued a}} ruling forbidding women {{to join the}} IDF. In the 1980s Rabbi Meir Kahane ardently opposed women serving in the IDF, advocating {{national}} service instead. [...] As of 2014 David Lau and Yitzhak Yosef of the Chief Rabbinate were opposed to religious women serving in the IDF, as was Safed Chief Rabbi Shmuel Eliyahu. However, Finance Minister Yair Lapid opposes this position and wants Lau and Yosef {{to be removed from}} the Chief Rabbinate because of it. Economy Minister Naftali Bennett stated [...] "I believe that all girls should do either IDF service or national service. With that, the attack on the rabbis for their traditional position is an unacceptable attack on the respect due them." [...] Education Minister Shai Piron said he backs the chief rabbis' injunction against observant women enlisting in the IDF. In 2003 Piron had said, “I don’t know of any rabbis that would allow [...] to serve in the army. The halachic authorities saw the reality from a joint education and spiritual perspective, this view led them to their halachic conclusion… The problem with IDF service is the general atmosphere that does not allow for a life without [...] pitfalls.” MK Elazar Stern said, [...] "A week ago the Chief Rabbis announced that a female serving in the IDF results in an aveira similar to Chilul Shabbos. This is tantamount to issuing a call to women, at least those who view themselves as religious, not to serve in the IDF...I served in the IDF for a few years and I state the military cannot function without women unless we lengthen the service of males to 4.5 years. The price that we will pay by the call of the Chief Rabbinate Council that females do not enlist is not that of our daughters, but the daughters <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>very</b> same rabbis who don't serve." [...] Rabbi Shlomo Riskin, the Rabbi of the city of Efrat, supports women's enlistment in the IDF. Also, in 2014 the Beit Hillel association of national-religious rabbis issued a ruling in Jewish law stating that women are allowed to serve in the IDF; however, Rabbi Shlomo Aviner claimed that Beit Hillel did not have the authority to make such a ruling.|$|E
