5|$|Both Lowell and Sexton {{encouraged}} Plath {{to write}} from her experience {{and she did}} so. She openly discussed her depression with Lowell and her suicide attempts with Sexton, who led her to write from a more female perspective. Plath began to conceive <b>of</b> <b>herself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> more serious, focused poet and short-story writer. At this time Plath and Hughes first met the poet W. S. Merwin, who admired their work and was to remain a lifelong friend. Plath resumed psychoanalytic treatment in December, working with Ruth Beuscher.|$|E

5|$|Angelou's {{primary role}} in Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas was stage performer, but in The Heart of a Woman she changes {{from someone who}} uses others' method of expression—the songs and dances of the African, Caribbean, and African-American oral tradition—to a writer. Angelou makes this {{decision}} for political reasons as she becomes more involved with the civil rights movement, and {{so that she can}} care for her son. For the first time in Angelou's autobiographies, she begins to think <b>of</b> <b>herself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> writer and recounts her literary development. Angelou begins to identify with other Black women writers {{for the first time in}} The Heart of a Woman. She has been influenced by several writers since her childhood, but this is the first time she mentions female authors. Up to this point, her identification has been with male writers; her new affiliations with female writers is due to her emerging feminism.|$|E

50|$|In 1906, when Bell {{started to}} think <b>of</b> <b>herself</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> artist, she formed the Friday Club to create a place in London that was more {{favourable}} to painting. Vanessa was encouraged by the Post-Impressionist exhibitions organised by Roger Fry, and she copied their bright colours and bold forms in her artworks. In 1914, she turned to Abstraction.|$|R

Don Calogero, who was active in Garibaldi's invasion, has become a wealthy landowner and businessman. To the dismay of the Prince, Don Calogero is now almost as wealthy as the Salinas. The manager adds that Angelica, Don Calogero's daughter, has become quite full <b>of</b> <b>herself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result.

500|$|Critics {{have also}} {{commented on the}} song's message. Ariana Bacle of Entertainment Weekly was {{confused}} over Liv's intentions for the song, questioning if the rapper was apologizing to Beyoncé about her flirtation with Jay Z or his alleged, inappropriate behavior with other women. Bacle chose the lyrics, [...] "You got a good girl, why she messing with a bad guy?" [...] {{as a point of}} confusion, in which the song transitions to become more [...] "directed at Mrs. Carter-Knowles' decisions." [...] In Touch Weeklys Carly Sitzer viewed the track as [...] "ultra-confusing", and cast doubt on Liv's claims of being a victim and the object of Beyoncé's jealousy. Echoing this thought, Bustles Kaitlin Reilly was critical of Liv's interpretation <b>of</b> <b>herself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> victim in the song's lyrics.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} {{is presented as}} highly professional, {{to the point of}} being a [...] "workaholic". She is notably hard on Resident Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), admitting that Cristina reminds her <b>of</b> <b>herself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> student. Despite her intentions to keep away from relationships, she becomes romantically involved with orthopedic surgeon Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez). The storyline was praised for its realistic portrayal of a developing same-sex relationship between two women, although consultants from the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation expressed some concerns over what they deemed the somewhat exploitative talk of a threesome between Hahn, Torres and Mark Sloan. Hahn was written out of Grey's Anatomy in November 2008, with Smith commenting that the decision originated with the ABC network rather than with series creator Shonda Rhimes.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{her first}} {{appearance}} in the series it is established that Hahn is a long-time rival of main character and fellow cardiothoracic surgeon Preston Burke, dating back to their days at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, where she graduated second after Burke. She is introduced as a cardiothoracic attending surgeon at Seattle Presbyterian Hospital when she and Burke fight over a donor heart. [...] Hahn reappears in season three when she is contacted by George O'Malley (T.R. Knight) for a consult on his father's valve replacement after George finds out about Burke's hand tremors and Cristina helping him cover it up. Hahn transfers to Seattle Grace Hospital in the season four episode, [...] "Haunt You Everyday", after performing a successful heart transplant {{at the request of}} the Chief of Surgery, Richard Webber. [...] She takes on the role previously held by Burke, Seattle Grace's Head of Cardiothoracic Surgery. Hahn cultivates an antagonistic relationship with Burke's former protégée Cristina Yang, refusing to let her scrub in on surgeries, and constantly criticizing her overly enthusiastic behavior. She later confesses to Addison Montgomery (Kate Walsh) that she is purposely hard on Cristina, as she reminds her <b>of</b> <b>herself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Resident.|$|E

She decides to talk to Elliot, and tells her {{the best way to}} get the relationship back on track: ignore what she (Jordan) says. Jordan has <b>a</b> fantasy <b>of</b> <b>herself</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> Oprah-like talk show host dancing with a child who looks just like her.|$|R
5|$|After {{the birth}} of her son, Aguilera stated in an {{interview}} with Ryan Seacrest that her forthcoming album would include a totally new aspect <b>of</b> <b>herself</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> artist, because <b>of</b> the pregnancy with her son. During an interview with People in 2008, Aguilera stated {{that she was going to}} start recording new material for her forthcoming album at her home in Beverly Hills. On the album, entitled Bionic, Aguilera was inspired by electronic and electronica music, which she heard a lot during her pregnancy.|$|R
5000|$|After {{publishing}} her {{discovery of}} Garamond's origin, [...] "Paul Beaujon" [...] was in 1927 offered the part-time post of {{editor of the}} Monotype Recorder, and Warde accepted—to the astonishment of Lanston Monotype Corporation executives in London, who were expecting a man. She was promoted to publicity manager in about 1929, a post she retained until her retirement in 1960 on her 60th birthday. She thought <b>of</b> <b>herself</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> outsider, working in a man's world, but she gained respect for her work and her personal qualities.|$|R
500|$|Angelou {{was deeply}} {{depressed}} {{in the months}} following King's assassination, so to help lift her spirits, Baldwin brought her to a dinner party at the home of cartoonist Jules Feiffer and his wife Judy in late 1968. [...] The guests began telling stories of their childhoods and Angelou's stories impressed Judy Feiffer. The next day she called Robert Loomis at Random House, who became Angelou's editor throughout her long writing career until he retired in 2011, and [...] "told him that he ought to get this woman to write a book". At first, Angelou refused, since she thought <b>of</b> <b>herself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> poet and playwright. According to Angelou, Baldwin had a [...] "covert hand" [...] in getting her to write the book, and advised Loomis to use [...] "a little reverse psychology", and reported that Loomis tricked her into it by daring her: [...] "It's just as well", he said, [...] "because to write an autobiography as literature is just about impossible". [...] Angelou was unable to resist a challenge, and she began writing Caged Bird. After [...] "closeting herself" [...] in London, it took her two years to write it. [...] She shared the manuscript with her friend, writer Jessica Mitford, before submitting it for publication.|$|E

[...] [...] Mary valued their companionship, as neither she nor Lydia had married. A case was made that Mary suffered from narcissistic disturbance, never completing the recognition <b>of</b> <b>herself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> person outside of the orbit of her mother. Mary had decided early in life that marriage would be incompatible with her career. Lydia, who was frequently painted by her sister, suffered from recurrent bouts of illness, and her death in 1882 left Cassatt temporarily unable to work.|$|E

5000|$|Thundergirl (Cris Winter): [...] "She flies ... like thunder!" [...] — The {{only female}} {{member of the}} team, {{as well as the}} only one with the ability to fly. She usually accompanies her flight with a song similar to the tune of John Williams' Star Wars theme (This was dropped later on in the series). Thundergirl does not {{appreciate}} Meltman's crush on her, and usually ignores his professions of love (and sometimes slaps him). She does not seem to think <b>of</b> <b>herself</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> equal {{to the rest of the}} League, thinking <b>of</b> <b>herself</b> <b>as</b> superior instead. <b>A</b> recurring gag is her stating that she will use her super strength only to realize too late that she doesn't have super strength. The figure used for Thundergirl was a Sindy doll's head on an unknown superhero figure body. Her image is a combination of Barbie and Wonder Woman.|$|R

Through these relationships and her construction of a number of variations on what Miriam Libicki has called a ‘gonzo self’ Ulinich explores the tensions between life and art, fact and fiction, and autobiography and the novel, mediating the aesthetic imperatives of what Roth has called the ‘written world’ and the ethical obligations of the ‘unwritten world’ in order to arrive at <b>an</b> authentic sense <b>of</b> <b>herself</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> artist and writer...|$|R

2500|$|Many celebrities {{have responded}} {{positively}} to being regarded as gay icons, several noting {{the loyalty of}} their gay fans. Eartha Kitt and Cher credited gay fans with keeping them going at times when their careers had faltered. Kylie Minogue has acknowledged the perception <b>of</b> <b>herself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> gay icon and has performed at such events as the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras. Asked to explain the reason for her large gay fanbase, Minogue replied, [...] "It's always {{difficult for me to}} give the definitive answer because I don't have it.

2500|$|In December 2013, Nguyen caused {{controversy}} by posting {{an article}} on her website titled [...] "Why I Sympathize with Hitler: Part I", although she stated that her views on Hitler were not derived from antisemitism on her part, nor any feelings toward Jewish people. She also posted pro-Hitler and antisemitic comments on her Facebook page, as well as photos <b>of</b> <b>herself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> scantily clad Nazi posing {{in front of a}} photo of the Auschwitz concentration camp. These actions angered her Facebook followers, and resulted in Facebook closing her account and removing the material in question. In August 2015, Tequila became a contestant in the sixteenth series of British television reality show Celebrity Big Brother, but was asked to leave the programme on its second day when producers became aware of her comments and photos. She subsequently apologized for her earlier comments, blaming them on depression and drug addiction.|$|E

Ed Morales wrote in PopMatters on June 23, 2008, that Esperanza is [...] "a sprawling collage of jazz fusion, Brazilian, and even a touch of hip-hop." [...] Siddhartha Mitter wrote in The Boston Globe on May 23, 2008, that [...] "the big change" [...] in Esperanza [...] "is the singing....

5000|$|Indigo (voiced by Robbie Lee) - She is {{in charge}} of the color indigo (and cooler shades of purple). Indigo's {{personality}} is dramatic and creative. She is a performer at heart, often making grand entrances in imaginative costumes or reciting lines from famous plays. More than anything, Indigo wants to be an actress and is often seen rehearsing for her big break. Some find her overly dramatic or call her a dreamer, but Indigo thinks <b>of</b> <b>herself</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> artist with aspirations. She also plays the drums (Murky's comet). In the Rainbow Brite Coloring Book, her full name was stated as Indigo Doll.|$|R

2500|$|Similarly to {{many other}} {{contemporary}} Mexican artists, Kahlo was heavily influenced by Mexicanidad, a romantic nationalism that had developed {{in the aftermath of}} the revolution. The Mexicanidad movement claimed to resist the [...] "mindset of cultural inferiority" [...] created by colonialism, and placed special importance on indigenous cultures. Before the revolution, Mexican folk culture — a mixture of indigenous and European elements — was disparaged by the elite, who claimed to have purely European ancestry and regarded Europe as the definition of civilization which Mexico should imitate. Kahlo's artistic ambition was to paint for the Mexican people, and she stated that she wished [...] "to be worthy, with my paintings, of the people to whom I belong and to the ideas which strengthen me". To enforce this image, she preferred to conceal the education she had received in art from her father and Ferdinand Fernandez and at the preparatory school. Instead, she cultivated an image <b>of</b> <b>herself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> [...] "self-taught and naive artist".|$|E

She repeated the feat on 13 September with Peter Mortimer filming. Famous among climbers, Ryan Minton explains in his article about Davis' achievement that [...] "The Diamond {{is one of the}} most revered alpine walls in North America" [...] and all of the climbing routes on it are extremely difficult. To be fully prepared and be sure she was not bothered by other climbers, Davis slept close to the peak itself on 3 September and began climbing at 4:15am. Interviewed after the climb, Davis said that positive thinking was central to her success as well as knowing that she was carrying very little gear and the conception <b>of</b> <b>herself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> crack climber. Davis is the first woman to free solo the Diamond and the second person to free solo the Pervertical Sanctuary route (the other is Derek Hersey).|$|E

Als also says that Angelou's busy career, instead of revealing her ambition, shows [...] "a woman who is only moderately talented and perpetually unable to understand who she is". Angelou, {{in spite of the}} mistakes of her youth, needed the approval and acceptance of others, and observes that Holiday was able to perceive this.
