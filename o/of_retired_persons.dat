The Democratic National Committee and AFL-CIO then worked together to transform the Kennedy group into the National Council of Senior Citizens (NCSC). The new organization was formally announced in July 1961. The United Auto Workers and United Steelworkers pushed their retirees to sign up as members, and both unions as well as the AFL-CIO contributed seed-money to finance the group. Forand, who had retired from office in 1960, became the NCSC's first president and William Hutton, a public relations official with the AFL-CIO, its first executive director.|$|E

50|$|The Cunninghamhead Estate {{is in the}} 21st century {{mainly a}} {{residential}} caravan park with two private residences near Irvine, Scotland. It was once a private estate, owned by a sequence of recorded families since around 1418. The Mansion House, one of Britain's lost houses, was built in 1747; it was destroyed by fire in the early 1960s, whilst renovation work was being carried out. The old mansion and castle have been lost, however the stables are still a residence, whilst the Gardner's Cottage survive as ruins. From 1964, work was carried out, first to use the estate as a chicken farm and later as holiday and residential, caravan park and camping site, making most of the rural location. Circa 2003 the site was significantly redeveloped to become a residential caravan park exclusively for the use <b>of</b> <b>retired</b> and semi-retired <b>persons.</b>|$|R

5000|$|No {{adequate}} sociological {{sampling of}} NF members ever took place, but impressionistic interviews with members {{were carried out}} during the 1970s by Taylor, Fielding, and Billig.Max Hanna noted that as of 1973, {{most members of the}} NF were [...] "from the skilled working class and lower-middle class" [...] but that there was variation according to branch.Fielding observed that most members of the party during the late 1970s were working-class. He also noted that in the party's South Coast branches there was a higher concentration of lower middle-class members. He furthermore observed that party activism was generally carried out by upper working and lower middle-class members rather than by those who were lower working or upper middle-class. Fielding noted that the party's membership contained individuals of all age ranges, although added that there were branches with a particular concentration <b>of</b> largely <b>retired</b> <b>persons.</b> He also observed that branches exhibited a greater number of men in their thirties or fifties rather than their forties, suggesting that the latter were typically too preoccupied with raising their families to involve themselves heavily in NF matters. Hanna also noted that [...] "men in their thirties" [...] appeared to be the party's main cohort. The male dominance of the membership was in common with most other British political parties active in the period, although the Front also projected an image of [...] "overwhelming masculinity" [...] and [...] "virulent machismo".|$|R

Does {{outward foreign direct investment}} (FDI) pressure for retrenchment even as “trade openness and financial liberalization ” are “clearly operating against such retrenchments”? 1 Do political factors or other socioeconomic factors, perhaps, drive retrenchments? We reopen these questions—and related ones—here because of the existence of errors in the data (and its documentation) analyzed in the Hicks and Zorn’s 2005 article that call for some correction of sources and revision of analyses. Reanalysis nullifies most of the major nonnull findings from 2005 article, although it brings new conclusions. In particular, the thesis of self-limiting immoderation—the idea that the demographic pressures for welfare expansion measured by unemployment rates and the elderly share of populations may become so unsustainable that they trigger welfare retrenchment—no longer receives support at any conventional significance level. Indications of FDI pressure for retrenchment fade, although trade openness, if not financial liberalization, does appear rather strongly appear to inhibi...|$|R

The analysis considers the implications for elderly individuals who choose to participate in the new Medicare Part D drug benefit, labelled the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernisation Act of 2003. The results highlight the necessity for the Medicare prescription drug benefit to carefully target the eldest among the elderly, who are most in need and are in danger of becoming trapped in the so-called Medicare 'doughnut hole', i. e. incur high prescription drug outlays, without adequate coverage. The study also finds evidence that women, those who are not married, middle income elderly and those in poor health, who purchase drugs more intensively, are at risk of incurring significant prescription OOP drug outlays...|$|R
