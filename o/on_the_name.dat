5|$|In 1955, Grapico Company of America {{expanded}} its fruit flavored brands into orange with Orangico, a play <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> Grapico. Orangico was to include real orange juice.

5|$|The hurst {{of trees}} with a {{representation}} of the Pole Star above are a play <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> Northwood. The mitre and fleurs-de-lys refer to the Abbey of Bec Herlewin in Normandy, to whom the Lordship of Ruislip was granted, where there was a cell of the Order. The Manor was later seized by Henry V and granted as part of the endowment of King's College, Cambridge. The Abbey and the College were dedicated to St. Mary, one of whose symbols is a fleur-de-lis. The 'rye slips' are a play <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> Ruislip. The wild boar shows that the Lordship was an ancient one, granted when the land was forest roamed by wild boars.|$|E

The band completed a fall West Coast tour and began recording their debut album with Romanski. The band took <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> The Reputation at this time.|$|E
5|$|George Vernadsky {{proposed}} that Oleg of Novgorod was the donkey-riding {{chief of the}} Rus' who attacked Bardha'a. Vernadsky identified Oleg with Helgu, a figure mentioned in the Schechter Letter. According to that document, Helgu went to Persia by boat and died there after a failed attack on Constantinople in 941. On the other hand, Lev Gumilev, drawing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> of the Rus' leader (as recorded in Arabian sources), hypothesizes that this leader was Sveneld, a Varangian chieftain whose wealth was noted in the Primary Chronicle under 945.|$|E
5|$|The king, {{after getting}} {{suspicious}} of her actions, once {{followed her to}} a sadhu’s place, with a dagger in his cloak.

When he was about to return, he heard a voice saying that his daughter had been taken away as a punishment of his suspicion. The voice also asked him to build a temple, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> of his daughter Champavati, if he wanted to avoid further familial calamities.|$|E

5|$|Bahá'u'lláh {{first heard}} of the Báb when he was 27, and {{received}} a visitor sent by the Báb, Mullá Husayn, telling him of the Báb and his claims. Bahá'u'lláh became a Bábí and helped to spread the new movement, especially in his native province of Núr, where he became {{recognized as one of}} its most influential believers. His notability as a local gave him many openings, and his trips to teach the religion were met with success, even among some of the religious class. He also helped to protect fellow believers, such as Táhirih, for which he was temporarily imprisoned in Tehran and punished with bastinado or foot whipping. Bahá'u'lláh, in the summer of 1848, also attended the conference of Badasht in the province of Khorasan, where 81 prominent Bábís met for 22 days; at that conference where there was a discussion between those Bábís who wanted to maintain Islamic law and those who believed that the Báb's message began a new dispensation, Bahá'u'lláh took the pro-change side, which eventually won out. It is at this conference that Bahá'u'lláh took <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> Bahá.|$|E
5|$|Botanists in the 20th century {{recognised}} B.oblongifolia as {{a species}} in its own right, but disagreed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>name.</b> Those in Queensland felt Salisbury's name was invalid and used Banksia oblongifolia, while New South Wales authorities used Banksia aspleniifolia {{as it was the}} oldest published name for the species. Botanist and banksia authority Alex George ruled that oblongifolia was the correct name in his 1981 revision of the genus. After reviewing Salisbury's original species description, which is of the leaves alone, he concluded that it does not diagnose the species to the exclusion of others and is hence not a validly published name—the description could have applied to juvenile leaves of B.paludosa, B.integrifolia or even B.marginata.|$|E
5|$|By the 1850s, {{with the}} era of the romantic ballet at an end, the {{principal}} personalities of the ballet, such as Perrot, Saint-Léon, Taglioni, and the composer Pugni, joined the Tsar's Imperial Ballet of St. Petersburg, Russia. Ballet in London went through a considerable decline beginning with the fire at Her Majesty's Theatre, a decline that lasted {{until the end of the}} 19th century. Ballet in London was not resurrected until the early 20th century, when such dancers as Adeline Genée began performing. The theatre's ballet company found a new home at the Old Vic and soon took <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> of the Vic-Wells Ballet. Later, moving primarily to the Sadler's Wells Theatre, the company became known as the Sadler's Wells Ballet. Eventually the troupe began performing at the Royal Opera House and became the Royal Ballet, as it is known today.|$|E

5|$|Delivered to the United States Army Air Forces on 19 March 1945, Bockscar was {{assigned}} to Captain Frederick C. Bock and crew C-13, and flown to Wendover Army Air Field, Utah in April. The name chosen for the aircraft, and painted on it after the mission, was a pun <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> of the aircraft commander. It left Wendover on 11 June 1945 for Tinian, where it arrived 16 June. It was originally given the Victor (unit-assigned identification) number 7 but on 1 August was given the triangle N tail markings of the 444th Bombardment Group as a security measure, and had its Victor changed to 77 to avoid misidentification with an actual 444th aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Goodrich Castle {{became the}} scene {{of one of the}} most desperate sieges during the English Civil War in the 1640s, which saw the rival factions of Parliament and the king vie for power across England. In the years before the war, there had been a {{resurgence}} of building at the castle. Richard Tyler, a local lawyer, became the tenant and constable of the castle, and during the early 1630s there had been considerable renovation work. Shortly after the outbreak of war, the Earl of Stamford, with support from Tyler, garrisoned the castle for Parliament until December 1643, when increasing Royalist pressure in the region forced his withdrawal to Gloucester. The castle was then occupied by a garrison led by the Royalist Sir Henry Lingen. The occupation was not peaceful, with Royalist troops burning surrounding farm buildingsTyler himself was imprisoned by Lingen, although not before he had begun to sell off his livestock and other moveable property. Some references to Goodrich Castle during this period refer to it as Guthridge Castle, a variant <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> Goodrich.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, {{she became}} the first woman to be entombed on her own merits in the Panthéon, Paris. The curie (symbol Ci), a unit of radioactivity, is named in honour of her and Pierre (although the {{commission}} which agreed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> never clearly stated whether the standard was named after Pierre, Marie or both of them). The element with atomic number 96 was named curium. Three radioactive minerals are also named after the Curies: curite, sklodowskite, and cuprosklodowskite. She received numerous honorary degrees from universities across the world. The Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions fellowship program of the European Union for young scientists wishing to work in a foreign country is named after her. In Poland, she had received honorary doctorates from the Lwów Polytechnic (1912),Poznań University (1922), Kraków's Jagiellonian University (1924), and the Warsaw Polytechnic (1926). In 1921, in the U.S., she was awarded membership in the Iota Sigma Pi women scientists' society.|$|E

5|$|In Final Fantasy XII, the Light of Kiltia, a polytheistic religion, is the {{dominant}} church in Ivalice, having influence in the political affairs of the region around the Galtean Peninsula. Despite this, the church maintains an apolitical stance, with its most high-ranking officials banned from participating in political affairs altogether. At its head is the Gran Kiltias, being the Helgas Anastasis {{at the time of}} Final Fantasy XII, until his death during the events of the story. Like Glabados followers in Final Fantasy Tactics, Kiltias swear <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> of Faram, the Father of All, in the manner of the Christian amen.

5|$|Many {{places and}} {{things in the}} United States have been {{named in honor of}} John Hancock. The U.S. Navy has named vessels USS Hancock and USS John Hancock; a World War II Liberty ship was also named in his honor. Ten states have a Hancock County named for him; other places named after him include Hancock, Massachusetts; Hancock, Michigan; Hancock, New Hampshire; Hancock, New York; and Mount Hancock in New Hampshire. John Hancock University is named for him, as was the John Hancock Financial company, founded in Boston in 1862; it had no {{connection}} to Hancock's own business ventures. The financial company passed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> to the John Hancock Tower in Boston, the John Hancock Center in Chicago, as well as the John Hancock Student Village at Boston University.|$|E
5|$|Matheson {{proposed}} that when Camden published his Britannia which included {{an account of}} the kings of Mann, genealogists saw the Latin Olavus (a Latin form of the Old Norse Óláfr) and concluded that it represented the Gaelic name Olbhar, Olghair. However, the Scottish Gaelic form of Olaf, Olavus, Olaus, Óláfr, is in fact Amhlaoibh, and the more modern Amhlaidh. Matheson further {{proposed that}} Leod's father's name also equates to Ölvir. So in Matheson's opinion, genealogists mistakenly attached Leod's father and great-grandfather to the Manx king Olaf the Black and his own grandfather, Olaf the Red. While Matheson's identification of the name of Leod's grandfather is now accepted, Sellar later disagreed with him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> of Leod's father; proposing instead that it was more likely the Gaelic name Gillemuire—a name which appears on one of the four Gaelic-language genealogies.|$|E

5|$|Megadeth's lyrics often {{focus on}} death, war, politics, and religion. The lyricism centers on nihilistic themes, but {{occasionally}} deals with {{topics such as}} alienation and social problems. The earliest releases featured themes such as occultism, graphic violence, and Satanism. Nuclear warfare and government conspiracy were preoccupations on albums such as Rust in Peace and Countdown to Extinction. During Megadeth's commercial peak, Mustaine elaborated on more personal themes such as addiction and intimate relationships. For the lyrics on Cryptic Writings, Mustaine said {{that he wanted to}} write songs that had more appeal to a wider audience. The title of United Abominations is a satiric play <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> of the United Nations; Mustaine criticized the organization's ineffectiveness on a number of songs on that album. Later albums contained lyrics in a similar vein.|$|E
5|$|NY383 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY36 in the hamlet of Mumford, located {{just north of}} the border between Monroe and Livingston Counties in the town of Wheatland. Taking <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> Scottsville–Mumford Road, NY383 follows Oatka Creek east through open fields and passes through the small hamlet of Garbutt {{on its way to the}} village of Scottsville, where it becomes Caledonia Avenue. At an intersection with the southern terminus of NY386, NY383 turns east onto Main Street and follows it through the residential southern portion of the village and past the Scottsville Free Library. Main Street comes to an end at a junction with River Road (NY251, which has its western terminus here) and Rochester Street near the northern bank of Oatka Creek. Here, NY383 curves north onto Rochester Street and proceeds through eastern Scottsville. The street name of NY383 becomes Scottsville Road upon intersecting the western terminus of NY253. Past this junction, the surroundings shift from village streets to housing tracts as the route exits Scottsville. North of the village, NY383 re-enters open fields once again upon crossing the Wheatland–Chili town line.|$|E

An intersection with CR79 is not far off, as it passes {{just north of the}} town of Arkwright. NY83 proceeds west-northwest until it reaches its ending terminus at NY60 in the community of Laona, located just west of the Arkwright town line in Pomfret.|$|E
