40|$|Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the Degree of Bachelor Business Science in Finance at Strathmore UniversityInvestors have traditionally been viewed as economically rational individuals who {{make decisions based on}} all available information. More recent studies propose that investors are irrational and systematically overreact to good and bad information events. Several anomalies have been identified that deviate from rational behavior, which offer opportunities to make abnormal returns. This paper tests for the overreaction phenomenon, a market anomaly previously presented by De Bandt and Thaler (1985, 1987) whereby past losers significantly outperform past winners following overreaction to extreme earnings by investors. The test examines the movement of returns of stocks listed on the Nairobi Securities Exchange over 36 months subsequent to extreme earning years. The test involved forming two portfolios, one of extreme good performers and the other of extreme poor performers during the base year. Performance of these portfolios was analyzed from the year of portfolio formation for 5 <b>overlapping</b> <b>sample</b> periods. As a control, the paper also examines whether the difference between losers and winners is actually a size effect as proposed by Zarowin { 1989). Portfolios were formed based on firm size and their performance was analyzed for 36 months subsequent to portfolio formation over 5 <b>overlapping</b> <b>sample</b> periods. The results are however not consistent with either proposition. There was no statistically significant difference between the two portfolios in each case, and therefore the findings do not support both investor overreaction to earnings and the size effect in the NSE...|$|R

40|$|Wafer defect {{detection}} {{using an}} intelligent system is an approach of quality improvement in semiconductor manufacturing {{that aims to}} enhance its process stability, increase production capacity, and improve yields. Occasionally, only few records that indicate defective units are available and they are classified as a minority group in a large database. Such a situation leads to an imbalanced data set problem, wherein it engenders a great challenge to deal with by applying machine-learning techniques for obtaining effective solution. In addition, the database may comprise <b>overlapping</b> <b>samples</b> of different classes. This paper introduces two models of evolutionary fuzzy ARTMAP (FAM) neural networks {{to deal with the}} imbalanced data set problems in a semiconductor manufacturing operations. In particular, both the FAM models and hybrid genetic algorithms are integrated in the proposed evolutionary artificial neural networks (EANNs) to classify an imbalanced data set. In addition, one of the proposed EANNs incorporates a facility to learn <b>overlapping</b> <b>samples</b> of different classes from the imbalanced data environment. The classification results of the proposed evolutionary FAM neural networks are presented, compared, and analyzed using several classification metrics. The outcomes positively indicate the effectiveness of the proposed networks in handling classification problems with imbalanced data sets...|$|E

40|$|Aiming at {{comparing}} different morphological {{models of}} galaxy clusters, we use two {{new methods to}} make a cosmological model-independent test of the distance-duality (DD) relation. The luminosity distances come from Union 2 compilation of Supernovae Type Ia. The angular diameter distances are given by two cluster models (De Filippis et al. and Bonamente et al.). The advantage of our methods {{is that it can}} reduce statistical errors. Concerning the morphological hypotheses for cluster models, it is mainly focused on the comparison between elliptical β-model and spherical β-model. The spherical β-model is divided into two groups in terms of different reduction methods of angular diameter distances, i. e. conservative spherical β-model and corrected spherical β-model. Our results show that the DD relation is consistent with the elliptical β-model at 1 σ confidence level (CL) for both methods, whereas for almost all spherical β-model parameterizations, the DD relation can only be accommodated at 3 σ CL, particularly for the conservative spherical β-model. In order to minimize systematic uncertainties, we also apply the test to the <b>overlap</b> <b>sample,</b> i. e. the same set of clusters modeled by both De Filippis et al. and Bonamente et al [...] It is found that the DD relation is compatible with the elliptically modeled <b>overlap</b> <b>sample</b> at 1 σ CL, however for most of the parameterizations, the DD relation can not be accommodated even at 3 σ CL for any of the two spherical β-models. Therefore it is reasonable that the marked triaxial ellipsoidal model is a better geometrical hypothesis describing the structure of the galaxy cluster compared with the spherical β-model if the DD relation is valid in cosmological observations.
