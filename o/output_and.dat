5|$|A {{determination}} {{of whether or}} not the person has dehydration is an important part of the assessment, with dehydration typically divided into mild (3–5%), moderate (6–9%), and severe (≥10%) cases. In children, the most accurate signs of moderate or severe dehydration are a prolonged capillary refill, poor skin turgor, and abnormal breathing. Other useful findings (when used in combination) include sunken eyes, decreased activity, a lack of tears, and a dry mouth. A normal urinary <b>output</b> <b>and</b> oral fluid intake is reassuring. Laboratory testing is of little clinical benefit in determining the degree of dehydration. Thus the use of urine testing or ultrasounds is generally not needed.|$|E
5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} also binds to the hemeprotein myoglobin. It {{has a high}} {{affinity for}} myoglobin, about 60 times {{greater than that of}} oxygen. Carbon monoxide bound to myoglobin may impair its ability to utilize oxygen. This causes reduced cardiac <b>output</b> <b>and</b> hypotension, which may result in brain ischemia. A delayed return of symptoms have been reported. This results following a recurrence of increased carboxyhemoglobin levels; this effect may be due to a late release of carbon monoxide from myoglobin, which subsequently binds to hemoglobin.|$|E
5|$|Earth has {{undergone}} periodic climate {{shifts in the}} past, including four major ice ages. These consisting of glacial periods where conditions are colder than normal, separated by interglacial periods. The accumulation of snow and ice during a glacial period increases the surface albedo, reflecting more of the Sun's energy into space and maintaining a lower atmospheric temperature. Increases in greenhouse gases, such as by volcanic activity, can increase the global temperature and produce an interglacial period. Suggested causes of ice age periods include {{the positions of the}} continents, variations in the Earth's orbit, changes in the solar <b>output,</b> <b>and</b> volcanism.|$|E

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of dependence among output errors of multi-input multi-output learning machines {{can help us}} in designing well-behaved systems, highlighting hidden interactions among their internal components that can add noise to the learning process. By estimating the relations between performances <b>and</b> dependence among <b>output</b> errors, we can compare different models of learning machines in order to select the ones best suited to a particular problem. We distinguish between dependence among <b>outputs</b> <b>and</b> dependence among <b>output</b> errors <b>and</b> we propose measures based on mutual information for evaluating both these types of dependence. Global measures of dependence between <b>outputs</b> <b>and</b> <b>output</b> errors, together with mutual information error matrices for evaluating specific dependences between each pair of outputs are presented.

Its games and productivity software each composed about half of the company's <b>output,</b> <b>and</b> their software in both categories reached the top of sales charts. Broderbund co-founder Doug Carlston conceived the core concept of a machine that sorts based on color, and Robert Cook expanded the concept with the gumball conceit. He spent a week designing the main processing machine, with its pipes and valves. Though he later returned to add more background detail, his original pipe design did not change. Most of Cook's time was spent programming the game's functions, such as the how individual gumballs move through the pipes.|$|E
