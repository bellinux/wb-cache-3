40|$|In a {{cross-sectional}} {{survey of}} 325 surgical and <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>beds</b> 43 (16 %) of the 265 occupied beds were filled by {{patients who had}} no medical {{need to be in}} an acute ward. They had been in hospital for a median time of 40 weeks up to the survey date. Of the 43 patients, 11 were awaiting transfer to a geriatric ward; 13 to community residential care; and seven to their homes. There was no plan for discharge or transfer for the remaining 12 (28 %). Those "at risk" of becoming long-stay patients for social reasons on these wards were women, over 75, living alone or with one relative, who had been admitted to hospital in emergency with a fractured femur, head injury, or other trauma.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a method of}} appraising general workload in any Orthopaedic Department {{and can be used}} by Surgeons themselves as well as management to assess performance. During the period 1983 - 1986, the Author undertook research in three different Orthopaedic Departments in one Region. In each department a standard initial phase of work was carried out to assess the potential for improvements in the way resources were used. This initial approach became a useful standard method of appraising the main areas of workload and their inter-relationships. The approach described uses official hospital data supplemented as far as possible by data collection locally. As well as helping the Author to identify specific areas of investigation amenable to further economic evaluation (e. g. See CHE Discussion Paper 14) a general picture of a ‘typical’ orthopaedic department was built up during this process. Relationships between one part of the Orthopaedic ‘system’ and another were carefully enumerated at hospital level and knowledge of these can also help other departments engage in the process of ‘self-audit’. Some departments moreover may which to refine the data locally and therefore the method of calculation and the sources of data are provided in the appendices. The second part of this paper deals with the implications for workload of different organisational arrangements. For example, what impact could the provision of an overnight stay ward have on the throughput of in-patient beds? Is it better to separate cold and trauma <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>beds</b> formally or leave this flexible? Using the model of an orthopaedic department described it is possible for those influencing the pattern of Orthopaedic care at a district level to anticipate the effects of policy changes before actual implementation. Specific changes of policy, however, require further analysis to assess the effects on costs and outcome; these can be provided {{with the help of a}} health economist. orthopaedics...|$|E
40|$|This {{essay is}} based on a larger ethnographic study in a {{government}} teaching hospital in Bangladesh. Through photographs I examine how beds in one of the wards take on a distinct nature and express the values and norms of Bangladeshi society at-large. Admission of too many patients along with the scarcity of beds threatens the privacy of patients. Because relatives {{are an integral part of}} the hospital organization, beds in the ward are used both by patients and relatives. While the male section of the ward is overcrowded, female beds mostly remain empty. Finally, to an <b>orthopaedic</b> patient, <b>beds</b> are like prisons. The beds of the Bangladeshi hospital show the general poverty of the country, the crucial role of family in people’s life, and the relative invisibility of women in public sphere...|$|R
40|$|Having {{identified}} woman over 65 {{with the}} condition, fractured neck of femur, {{as the main}} cause of slow throughput and low bed availability on the acute orthopaedic wards at Huddersfield, it was decided to review existing management policies towards this group of patients. After consultation with the Orthopaedic and Geriatric Specialties, it was decided that a possible means of improving throughput was to instigate a policy of joint Geriatric-Orthopaedic management for these patients. It was envisaged that this scheme might also improve the quality of care and therefore the outcome of treatment. Six <b>orthopaedic</b> rehabilitation <b>beds</b> at St. Luke's, a mainly long stay hospital, three miles from the District General Hospital (DGH) were converted into Geriatric-Orthopaedic beds. This site at the time was the main base for the district Geriatric Servicec as well as providing some <b>Orthopaedic</b> rehabilitation <b>beds.</b> A standardised format of Geriatric-Orthopaedic management was agreed between the two specialties. Patients admitted with this condition admitted {{during the course of the}} year commencing March 1984, were then randomly assigned by the research team, to either the new joint management sustem or to single speciality Orthopaedic management as before. The evaluative criteria on which the two systems were judged can be divided into two main categories, namely costs (to the Hospital sector) and benefits (to the individla patients and to the Hospital sector). Costs taken into consideration included the number of bed days utilised (as a general indicator of fixed costs) and staff input into rehabilitation, e. g. physiotherapist's, occupational therapist's, social worker's time (as indicators of variable costs). Benefit, or outcome of treatment, was measured by the availability of patients in the trial to undertake standard 'activities of daily living' tests (ADLs) at fixed intervals up to and including discharge (e. g. patients' ability to stand, dress, etc.). Outcome was also measured in terms of a therapist's prognosis and success in returning patients back to their home environments. geriatric, orthopaedic...|$|R

30|$|In our study, nailing was {{superior}} to plating {{with respect to the}} average post-operative stay of the patients and operating time. The main reason for the longer stay in the plating group in our study was because of the longer delay in surgery in the plating patients. This was due to our tendency to do DCP only when the swelling had completely subsided. In contrast, ILN does not need rigorous subsidence of the swelling. Most of our patients belonged to far-off places where sterile-dressing facilities were not readily available and thus tended to stay till the operative wound was deemed clean. ILN patients had an edge due to their smaller surgical wounds and so were discharged earlier. The shorter stay, with a less invasive method, such as closed nailing, is of great advantage in developing countries where the <b>orthopaedic</b> hospital <b>beds</b> are limited and resources are scarce. For the same reason, the less operating time reported by us is also advantageous. Chao et al. also had shorter operative time in ILN, although the difference was not significant, while Chaudhary et al. had shorter operative time in the plating group [29, 34]. ILN was also associated with significantly decreased blood loss than plating, as has been seen in most of the studies [29]. Although this difference is statistically significant, but in the clinical settings, this difference is marginal.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Clostridium difficile -associated {{diarrhoea}} (CDAD) is a frequently occurring healthcare-associated infection, {{which is}} responsible for significant morbidity and mortality amongst elderly patients in healthcare facilities. Environmental contamination is known to play an important contributory role in the spread of CDAD and it is suspected that contamination might be occurring as a result of aerial dissemination of C. difficile spores. However previous studies have failed to isolate C. difficile from air in hospitals. In an attempt to clarify this issue we undertook a short controlled pilot study in an elderly care ward with the aim of culturing C. difficile from the air. Methods In a survey undertaken during February (two days) 2006 and March (two days) 2007, air samples were collected using a portable cyclone sampler and surface samples collected using contact plates in a UK hospital. Sampling took place in a six bedded elderly care bay (Study) during February 2006 and in March 2007 both the study bay and a four <b>bedded</b> <b>orthopaedic</b> bay (Control). Particulate material from the air was collected in Ringer's solution, alcohol shocked and plated out in triplicate onto Brazier's CCEY agar without egg yolk, but supplemented with 5 mg/L of lysozyme. After incubation, the identity of isolates was confirmed by standard techniques. Ribotyping and REP-PCR fingerprinting were used to further characterise isolates. Results On both days in February 2006, C. difficile was cultured from the air with 23 samples yielding the bacterium (mean counts 53 – 426 cfu/m 3 of air). One representative isolate from each of these was characterized further. Of the 23 isolates, 22 were ribotype 001 and were indistinguishable on REP-PCR typing. C. difficile was not cultured from the air or surfaces of either hospital bay during the two days in March 2007. Conclusion This pilot study produced clear evidence of sporadic aerial dissemination of spores of a clone of C. difficile, a finding which may help to explain why CDAD is so persistent within hospitals and difficult to eradicate. Although preliminary, the findings reinforce concerns that current C. difficile control measures may be inadequate and suggest that improved ward ventilation may help to reduce the spread of CDAD in healthcare facilities. </p...|$|R
