60|$|HOTCHKISS. Ive {{fallen in}} love with a coal merchant's wife. I adore her. I would rather have one of her boot-laces than a lock <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>hair.</b> [He folds his arms and stands like a rock].|$|E
6000|$|... "That is all I need," [...] she cried, [...] "for like {{my heart}} my magic is white. Stay--son of Zomba, give me also <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>hair,</b> {{for those who}} visit the Bee must listen to her humming." ...|$|E

60|$|And you, {{my sweet}} Penelope, {{out there somewhere}} you wait for me With buds <b>of</b> roses in <b>your</b> <b>hair</b> and kisses on your mouth.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come to my room, Joyce. I {{want to see}} if {{we cannot}} find a more {{becoming}} way <b>of</b> arranging <b>your</b> <b>hair.</b> It has grown so thick and long. I had no idea how thick and long. Yes, we must certainly find a better way than that stiff braid. Come!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Anne Shirley, {{since you}} seem to be so fond of the boys' company we shall indulge your taste for it this afternoon," [...] he said sarcastically. [...] "Take those flowers out <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>hair</b> and sit with Gilbert Blythe." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How do you know?" [...] Archie {{surveyed}} {{his brother-in-law}} critically. [...] "Perhaps her feelings have changed too. Very possibly {{she may not}} like the colour <b>of</b> <b>YOUR</b> <b>hair.</b> I don't myself. Now {{if you were to}} dye yourself crimson--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don’t {{think he}} would," [...] said his tormenter, with a bewitching smile; [...] "and I’ll wear a lock <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>hair</b> {{all my life}} if you do. But you’d better {{give it to me}} before you go in." ...|$|E
6000|$|MRS. P.--And I {{may come}} too? YOU {{are not afraid}} <b>of</b> my seeing <b>your</b> <b>hair,</b> dear Mrs. Bonnington! Mr. Bonnington too young for YOU! Why, you don't look twenty! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Life here on {{the border}} is keen, hard, invigorating," [...] said Colonel Zane. [...] "I tell you, George Sheppard, in spite <b>of</b> <b>your</b> gray <b>hair</b> and <b>your</b> pretty daughter, you have come out West {{because you want to}} live among men who do things." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are changed, Herbert; a {{great deal}} changed," [...] she said sadly, [...] "although I should have know you anywhere. You are so much thinner than when I saw you last; but your eyes have not changed, nor <b>your</b> smile. <b>Of</b> course <b>your</b> <b>hair</b> having got gray makes a difference, and--and--" [...] and she stopped.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I like you,' said he slowly, {{getting off}} {{his chair and}} coming over to Brandis. 'I like you. I shall call you Coppy, because <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>hair.</b> Do you mind being called Coppy? It is because of ve hair, you know.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well: if {{you come}} to that, I've got my reasons for giving the bracelet; and I mean to give it. If you won't let any <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>hair</b> be plaited up along with the rest, it's Madonna you will disappoint--not me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Red wheat, {{the finest}} {{we ever had}} in this land; not a bit beaten down, and the colour {{perfectly}} beautiful before harvest; it used {{to put me in}} mind <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>hair.</b> A load to the acre; a fair specimen of the effect of drainage. Do you remember what a swamp it was?' ...|$|E
5000|$|Subsequent {{television}} advertisements {{used the}} mottoes [...] "Grooms without gumming" [...] and later, in the 1970s in the UK and Canada, [...] "A little dab <b>of</b> Brylcreem on <b>your</b> <b>hair</b> {{gives you the}} Brylcreem bounce".|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, then, {{the look}} of it! I never saw any one so improved! Isn't she, Aunt Alice? She's grown, I declare! Yes'--measuring herself against her cousin--'I was a leetle bit taller when you came, and now you've got above me! and what a duck of a way <b>of</b> doing <b>your</b> <b>hair!</b> You must show me!

6000|$|... "You {{could take}} a lock <b>of</b> <b>your</b> late-lost husband's <b>hair,</b> and have it made into a {{mourning}} brooch, {{and look at it}} every hour of the day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Easily enough," [...] was the reply. [...] "Now suppose, my dear, that I {{gave you}} a pretty doll in {{exchange}} for a lock <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>hair,</b> and that after you had received the doll you smashed it into pieces and destroyed it. Could you say that I had not given you a pretty doll?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Anne," [...] he said hurriedly, [...] "look here. Can't we be good friends? I'm awfully sorry I {{made fun}} <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>hair</b> that time. I didn't mean to vex you and I only meant {{it for a}} joke. Besides, it's so long ago. I think your hair is awfully pretty now--honest I do. Let's be friends." ...|$|E
60|$|GUIDO. Ah! {{loose the}} falling midnight <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>hair,</b> And in those stars, your eyes, let me behold Mine image, as in mirrors. Dear Bianca, Though it be but a shadow, keep me there, Nor gaze at {{anything}} {{that does not}} show Some symbol of my semblance. I am jealous Of what your vision feasts on.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no, {{my sweet}} Laura!" [...] replied I, still {{playing with the}} glossy ringlet. [...] "Even your fair hand could not manage a curl more delicately than mine. I propose myself the {{pleasure}} <b>of</b> doing up <b>your</b> <b>hair</b> in papers every evening {{at the same time}} with my own." ...|$|R
6000|$|We'll dance a merry saraband {{from here}} to drowsy Samarcand. [...] Along the sea, across the land, the birds are flying South, [...] And you, my sweet Penelope, out there somewhere you wait for me, [...] With buds <b>of</b> roses in <b>your</b> <b>hair</b> and kisses on your mouth.|$|R
5000|$|In 1982 Arms {{bought a}} {{run-down}} building {{in her hometown}} of Blandford, Massachusetts, had it renovated, and presented it as the first town hall Blandford had ever had in its 241-year history. [...] "As it is now all the papers and records of the town are kept in private homes.

6000|$|He {{looked so}} disagreeable and his cat looked so wickedly at me, as if I were a blood-relation {{of the birds}} upstairs, that I was quite {{relieved}} by Richard's appearing {{at the door and}} saying, [...] "Miss Summerson, I hope you are not bargaining for the sale <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>hair.</b> Don't be tempted. Three sacks below are quite enough for Mr. Krook!" ...|$|E
60|$|As to the {{following}} Canto's, all the passages of them are as fabulous, as the Vision at the beginning, or the Transformation at the end; (except the loss <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>Hair,</b> which I always mention with reverence). The Human persons are as fictitious as the airy ones; and the character of Belinda, {{as it is now}} manag'd, resembles you in nothing but in Beauty.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wasn't the boys' {{dialogue}} fine?" [...] said Diana. [...] "Gilbert Blythe {{was just}} splendid. Anne, I do think it's awful mean {{the way you}} treat Gil. Wait till I tell you. When you ran off the platform after the fairy dialogue one of your roses fell out <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>hair.</b> I saw Gil {{pick it up and}} put it in his breast pocket. There now. You're so romantic that I'm sure you ought to be pleased at that." ...|$|E
50|$|Genetic testing. If {{your doctor}} {{suspects}} your baby's misshapen skull {{is caused by}} an underlying hereditary syndrome, genetic testing may help identify the syndrome.

The sample is sent to a lab for analysis.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{certainly}} {{should be a}} judge of freckles, Cousin Sophia," [...] said Susan, rushing to Rilla's defence. [...] "You were more speckled than any toad when you was a girl. Rilla's only come in summer but yours stayed put, season in and season out; and you had not a ground colour like hers behind them neither. You look real nice, Rilla, and that way <b>of</b> fixing <b>your</b> <b>hair</b> is becoming. But {{you are not going}} to walk to the harbour in those slippers, are you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|As soon as {{they entered}} the room, Harriet began to admire the lace {{trimming}} of Anne's dress, asking many questions about it, to all of which Anne replied with great good nature. As soon as the lace had been sufficiently discussed, Harriet turned round to Elizabeth, exclaiming, 'Why, Lizzie, why in the world have you taken to that fashion <b>of</b> doing <b>your</b> <b>hair?</b> it makes you look thinner than ever. Such dark hair too! it wants a little colour to relieve it; why do you not wear a red band in it, like mine?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, dear no," [...] {{she cried}} quickly, {{scanning}} him over at once with those piercing keen eyes of hers; [...] "you're like him, of course--I don't deny the likeness--as brothers may be like one another. Your features are the same, and the colour <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>hair</b> and eyes, {{and all that}} sort of thing; but still, I knew at a glance you weren't my Mr. Waring. I could never mistake you for him. The expression and the look are so utterly different." ...|$|E
60|$|For instance, {{there is}} one {{description}} of knocker {{that used to be}} common enough, but which is fast passing away—a large round one, with the jolly face of a convivial lion smiling blandly at you, as you twist the sides <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>hair</b> into a curl or pull up your shirt-collar while you are waiting for the door to be opened; we never saw that knocker on the door of a churlish man—so far as our experience is concerned, it invariably bespoke hospitality and another bottle.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! my Love replied she, {{you were}} born for each other. Every word you say more deeply convinces me that your Minds are {{actuated}} by the invisible power of simpathy, for your opinions and sentiments so exactly coincide. Nay, the colour <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>Hair</b> is not very different. Yes my dear Girl, the poor despairing Musgrove did reveal to me {{the story of his}} Love--. Nor was I surprised at it--I know not how it was, but I had a kind of presentiment that he would be in love with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You shall give me {{one thing}} though, if you will, sweet lady, that I may think of you often, and have {{something}} {{to remind me of}} you; nay, you shall give me two things--one is a lock <b>of</b> <b>your</b> soft brown <b>hair,</b> the other is a kiss." ...|$|R
