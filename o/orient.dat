40|$|International audienceThe clique {{number of}} an undirected graph G is the maximum {{order of a}} {{complete}} subgraph of G and is a well-known lower bound for the chromatic number of G. Every proper k-coloring of G {{may be viewed as}} a homomorphism (an edge-preserving vertex mapping) of G to the complete graph of order k. By considering homomorphisms of <b>oriented</b> graphs (digraphs without cycles of length at most 2), we get a natural notion of (<b>oriented)</b> colorings and <b>oriented</b> chromatic number of <b>oriented</b> graphs. An <b>oriented</b> clique is then an <b>oriented</b> graph whose number of vertices and <b>oriented</b> chromatic number coincide. However, the structure of <b>oriented</b> cliques is much less understood than in the undirected case. In this article, we study the structure of outerplanar and planar <b>oriented</b> cliques. We first provide a list of 11 graphs and prove that an outerplanar graph can be <b>oriented</b> as an <b>oriented</b> clique if and only if it contains one of these graphs as a spanning subgraph. Klostermeyer and MacGillivray conjectured that the order of a planar <b>oriented</b> clique is at most 15, which was later proved by Sen. We show that any planar <b>oriented</b> clique on 15 vertices must contain a particular <b>oriented</b> graph as a spanning subgraph, thus reproving the above conjecture.

40|$|A graph G has a k-page book {{embedding}} if G can be embedded into a k-page book. The minimum k {{such that}} G has a k-page book embedding {{is the book}} thickness of G, denoted bt(G). Most of the work on this subject has been done for unoriented graphs and <b>oriented</b> acyclic graphs (no directed cycles). In this work we discuss <b>oriented</b> graphs D containing directed cycles by using <b>oriented</b> book embeddings and <b>oriented</b> book thickness, obt(D). To characterize D such that obt(D) = k, we define the class M^k of k-page critical <b>oriented</b> graphs to be all <b>oriented</b> graphs D with obt(D) =k, but for every proper <b>oriented</b> subgraph of D, denoted D', we have that obt(D') < k.
