40|$|Objectives. This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the attitudes towards cheating of first- and third-year pharmacy students and to relate this information back to the descriptive characteristics of student respondents. Methods. Eight hundred forty-four pharmacy students completed the attitudes toward cheating scale in the fall of 2002. Ordered logistic regression was used to analyze the data and descriptive statistics were employed to summarize the information. Results. The statistically significant model indicated the following: (1) the probability of a female student holding a <b>conservative</b> <b>or</b> moderately <b>conservative</b> attitude toward cheating was 56 %, (2) the probability of an older student possessing a <b>conservative</b> <b>or</b> moderately <b>conservative</b> attitude toward cheating was 58 %, (3) the probability of a student with a high GPA holding a <b>conservative</b> <b>or</b> moderately <b>conservative</b> attitude toward cheating was 51 %. Conclusion. Pharmacy students guided by intrinsic motivations possess more conservative attitudes toward cheating than students driven by extrinsic motivations. Additionally, successful students may be less likely to cheat...|$|R

5|$|Millhouse was a vocal {{advocate}} of his broader constituency, championing their {{case in a}} party dominated by rural conservatives. He {{wrote a paper on}} the 'Liberal Case for Electoral Reform', arguing for a fairer electoral system, as it was biased against voters resident in the capital city, Adelaide, whether they be progressive <b>or</b> <b>conservative,</b> Liberal or Labor. Many younger urban middle class voters, who would have normally been attracted to the LCL, were abandoning the party for Labor owing to their dissatisfaction with the malapportioned electoral system known as the 'Playmander'. But this concerned the rural conservatives little, who hoped to retain their hold on power through the present system, which included a Legislative Council where suffrage was based on land ownership, resulting in a body dominated by the ruling class and the rural landholders, and a 16–4 LCL majority. Millhouse's paper was quickly ignored.|$|E

50|$|The {{members of}} the {{convention}} were generally moderates <b>or</b> <b>conservatives</b> who sought {{to keep the government}} as close to the existing one as possible. The major change was the replacement of the Proprietary Governor with an Executive Privy Council, chaired by a President. A second house of the Legislature was created as well. Both measures were meant to restrict the perceived arbitrary exercise of executive authority.|$|R
