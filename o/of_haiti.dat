5|$|A {{tropical}} {{wave that}} exited {{the coast of}} Africa on August 15, 1964, moved westward, not organizing into a tropical depression until around 890miles (1432.3km) east of Barbados on August 20–as reported by a Navy reconnaissance plane. It continued west-northwestward, quickly strengthening to a hurricane {{the next day with}} a minimum central pressure of 993mb. Early in the afternoon of August 22, Cleo crossed Guadeloupe as a 115mph (185km/h) Category3 hurricane. The hurricane continued to strengthen as it moved through the Caribbean Sea and reached its peak intensity of 155mph (250km/h) on the August 23 while south of the Dominican Republic. It maintained that intensity for a day, bringing heavy rain and winds to Hispaniola. As Cleo passed south <b>of</b> <b>Haiti</b> on August 24, it veered northward momentarily, enough {{to move on to the}} Southwest Peninsula <b>of</b> <b>Haiti.</b> The circulation of the hurricane was greatly disrupted by the mountainous terrain of the island, quickly weakening the hurricane.|$|E

5|$|After {{the end of}} the war in April, Atlanta was {{decommissioned}} in Philadelphia on 21 June 1865 {{and placed}} in reserve at League Island. She was sold to Sam Ward on 4 May 1869 for the price of $25,000 and subsequently delivered to representatives <b>of</b> <b>Haiti</b> on 8 December by Sydney Oaksmith, a lawyer who had received an advance of $50,000 on her purchase price of $260,000. The ship was briefly seized by the Customs Service, possibly for violations of neutrality laws as she had just loaded four large guns and a number of recruits for the forces of Sylvain Salnave, President <b>of</b> <b>Haiti,</b> who was embroiled in a civil war. Atlanta was released and sailed for Port-au-Prince three days later. She broke down in Delaware Bay and had to put in at Chester, Pennsylvania for repairs. The ship, now renamed either Triumph or Triumfo, departed on 18 December 1869 and vanished en route, apparently sinking with the loss of all hands, either off Cape Hatteras or the Delaware Capes.|$|E

5|$|A frontal trough moved eastward off {{the southeastern}} United States on September30, {{becoming}} stationary north <b>of</b> <b>Haiti.</b> The trough developed {{an area of}} disturbed weather that interacted with an upper-level low pressure area, resulting {{in the development of}} a subtropical depression on October7. Upon formation, the system consisted of a very broad subtropical low, as well as a poorly defined surface circulation. As the subtropical depression drifted westward, it became further organized. By midday on October8, an Air Force reconnaissance aircraft flight indicated that the subtropical depression intensified and acquired enough tropical characteristics to be considered a tropical storm. The National Hurricane Center named the storm Josephine.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} storm watch was issued at 0900UTC for the southwestern peninsula <b>of</b> <b>Haiti</b> from Port-au-Prince to the Dominican border. This advisory was upgraded {{the next morning}} to a {{tropical storm}} warning and a hurricane watch, and that night was further upgraded to a hurricane warning. The Haitian coastal authority advised all small craft to stay in port, while at Port-au-Prince, all flights to southern Haiti from Toussaint Louverture International Airport were canceled. More than 1,000people were evacuated from low-lying areas and workers from World Vision again pre-positioned relief supplies.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on November5. It tracked steadily west across the tropical Atlantic Ocean. Its forward motion slowed after it passed the Lesser Antilles on November12. A large well-defined anticyclone persisted across much of the Caribbean Sea, providing a favorable environment for the system. A low-level circulation gradually became evident on satellite imagery within the disturbance. Based on ship observations, the National Hurricane Center estimated that the system organized into a tropical depression on November17, about 280miles (450km) south of the western tip <b>of</b> <b>Haiti.</b>|$|E
5|$|About {{nine hours}} after Ernesto became a {{tropical}} storm, the government <b>of</b> <b>Haiti</b> issued {{a tropical storm}} watch from its border with the Dominican Republic to the southwestern tip of the country. As the storm strengthened, the watch was replaced with a tropical storm warning, and about 15hours prior to its closest approach the warning was replaced with a hurricane warning. Several low-lying citizens in Gonaïves were evacuated after local meteorologists anticipated up to 20inches (500mm) of rain in some mountainous areas. Additionally, authorities advised residents in shanty towns near the ocean to evacuate to emergency shelters.|$|E

5|$|After the storm, {{approximately}} 100,000people {{were facing}} starvation. Then-Haitian president Louis Borno {{reported that the}} government had inefficient resources for recovery and asked citizens to assist with repairing infrastructure and providing food and shelter to others. The Government <b>of</b> <b>Haiti,</b> in turn, appropriated $200,000 for relief. Eleven storages with relief supplies were established throughout the country. The approximately 10,000people left homeless were temporarily houses in larger, undamaged buildings. Within {{a few months after the}} storm, 299homes were rebuilt or repair, costing almost $37,000. The vehicular paths destroyed by the hurricane were eventually replaced by -wide paved gravel roads. In September, the American Red Cross donated $10,000 to the Haitian Red Cross.|$|E
5|$|Deep {{convection}} reformed the storm's center southwest <b>of</b> <b>Haiti,</b> near Jamaica's east coast. Under {{the influence}} of a mid-level ridge that extended from the Gulf of Mexico to the western Atlantic Ocean, Gustav picked up a westward motion. It was briefly disrupted by Jamaica as it passed over the mountainous island but rapidly strengthened when it moved over open water once again. Reaching Category4 strength less than 24 hours after having been a tropical storm, Gustav brushed the Isle of Youth and made landfall on Cuba's western's peninsula.|$|E
5|$|During the Napoleonic Wars, the Caribbean Sea was {{initially}} an important theatre of naval conflict, as ships operating {{from the various}} French, British, Spanish and Dutch colonies preyed on enemy trade. During 1809 and 1810 however, the Royal Navy launched a series of co-ordinated amphibious operations that eliminated the French and Dutch colonies and brought {{the conflict in the}} Caribbean to an end. With the threat of attacks on British trade in the region significantly reduced, the Royal Navy correspondingly reduced their presence in the Caribbean and the remaining British ships were distributed to observe trouble spots in the region, which in 1812 included the independent nation <b>of</b> <b>Haiti.</b>|$|E
