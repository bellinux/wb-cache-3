Emily Apple, {{one of the founders}} of the site told The Guardian, [...] "Nothing in that post [...] has not been said before on <b>our</b> <b>blog</b> or on other sites".

5000|$|In May 2011, a {{complaint}} was {{filed with the}} U.S. Federal Trade Commission alleging Dropbox misled users about the privacy and security of their files. At {{the heart of the}} complaint was the policy of data deduplication, where the system checks if a file has been uploaded before by any other user, and links to the existing copy if so; and the policy of using a single AES-256 key for every file on the system so Dropbox can (and does, for deduplication) look at encrypted files stored on the system, with the consequence that any intruder who gets the key (as well as potential Dropbox employees) could decrypt any file if they had access to Dropbox's backend storage infrastructure. In a response on its blog, Dropbox wrote that [...] "Like most major online services, we have a small number of employees who must be able to access user data when legally required to do so. But that's the exception, not the rule. We have strict policy and technical access controls that prohibit employee access except in these rare circumstances. In addition, we employ a number of physical and electronic security measures to protect user information from unauthorized access." [...] In response to the FTC complain, Dropbox spokeswoman Julie Supan told InformationWeek that [...] "We believe this complaint is without merit, and raises issues that were addressed in <b>our</b> <b>blog</b> post on April 21." ...|$|E

40|$|What is {{the context}} of <b>our</b> archaeological <b>blogging?</b> When we blog, are we merely {{shouting}} into the void? Do archaeological bloggers link only to one another, and do we shout only to each other (which, it must be admitted, is what our journals and conferences do, too, albeit at a slower pace) ? Assume a person knows nothing about archaeology: would that person find your blog? Your project website? Your department's website? Does academic blogging matter? One way {{to answer these questions}} is through a mapping of the archaeological web. When a layperson finds a site, she might signal its perceived value through linking, retweeting, commenting (once upon a time, on the blog post itself; now more likely via a tweet), and writing her own blog posts about it. Therefore, various network metrics of this map of the archaeological web can be taken as a kind of proxy for evaluating the likely impact of <b>our</b> <b>blogging.</b> Given that these blogs are all publicly available (if one knows or can find the address), blogging is a kind of public archaeology. Not necessarily an archaeology done for the public, but rather an archaeology done in view of the public (cf Richardson and Almansa-Sánchez 2015 on the variety within public archaeology). It would be interesting to know if this kind of public archaeology has an impact at all. These signals and linkages in the general noise of the Internet are the subject of this article. In order for us as archaeologists to generate the strongest possible signals on the web, we need to understand the structures that have emerged within the web to best facilitate dissemination. This can help us increase our signals' visibility, even though all roads eventually lead to Wikipedia. ...|$|R
