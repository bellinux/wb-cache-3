500|$|The Smashing Pumpkins {{have been}} praised as [...] "responsible {{for some of}} the most {{striking}} and memorable video clips" [...] and for having [...] "approached videos from a completely artistic standpoint rather than mere commercials to sell albums". |author=Greg Prato |work=Allmusic |accessdate=March 4, 2012}} MTV's 2001 anniversary special Testimony: 20Years of Rock on MTV credited the Pumpkins, along with Nine Inch Nails, with treating music videos as an art form during the 1990s. Corgan has said, [...] "We generally resisted the idea <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>call</b> the classic MTV rock video, which is like lots of people jumping around and stuff." [...] The band worked with video directors including Kevin Kerslake ("Cherub Rock"), Samuel Bayer ("Bullet with Butterfly Wings"), and, most frequently, the team of Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris ("Rocket", [...] "1979", [...] "Tonight, Tonight", [...] "The End Is the Beginning Is the End", and [...] "Perfect"). Corgan, who was frequently heavily involved in the conception of the videos, said of Dayton and Faris, [...] "I know my [...] versions are always darker, and they're always talking me into something a little kinder and gentler." [...] Videos like [...] "Today", [...] "Rocket", and [...] "1979" [...] dealt with images taken from middle American culture, albeit exaggerated. The group's videos so often avoid the literal interpretation of the song lyrics that the video for [...] "Thirty-Three", with images closely related to the words of the song, was created as an intentional stylistic departure.|$|E

She {{collected}} rocks and bones from the desert floor and made them and the distinctive architectural and landscape forms of the area subjects in her work. Known as a loner, O'Keeffe explored the land she loved often in her Ford Model A, which she purchased and learned to drive in 1929. She often talked about her fondness for Ghost Ranch and Northern New Mexico, as in 1943, when she explained: [...] "Such a beautiful, untouched lonely feeling place, such a fine part <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>call</b> the 'Faraway'. It is a place I have painted before ... even now I must do it again." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gary Vincent, an {{employee}} of Funspot and now curator of the Classic Arcade Museum, {{came up with the}} idea of collecting the games in one spot to give visitors to the arcade a different way of understanding the games. Opened in the late 1990s, the American Classic Arcade Museum collects games built no later than 1987. When asked why 1987 was picked as the cut off date, Vincent replied, [...] "We set the cut off date as 1987 because that is pretty much about the time when we noticed that the videogame industry was starting to change. Instead of having fantasy-based games, puzzle-based, space shoot 'em up games or whatever, it seemed to switch over to more <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>call</b> 'kick-punch-shoot' games." ...|$|E

2500|$|Graham {{collaborated with}} writer Don McGregor on the {{critically}} lauded [...] "Black Panther" [...] series {{that ran in}} Jungle Action #6–24 (Sept. 1973–Nov. 1976), becoming the series' regular penciler with issue #11 (Sept. 1974) and leaving after penciling the first five pages of issue #22 (July 1976). Bob Almond, inker {{for much of the}} run of The Black Panther vol. 3, dedicated his work in memoriam to Graham in an introductory note to issue #17 (April 2000). The pseudonymous Buzz Maverik wrote in Ain't It Cool News, [...] "I know the [...] artist, Billy Graham, was black. His cool Marvel Bullpen name was 'The Irreverent' Billy Graham. For me, even though I later learned that Jack Kirby created the Panther, Graham will always be the definitive Panther artist. His art, even more than McGregor's writing, made T'Challa one <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>call</b> the 'grown men' of the Marvel Universe, the others being Daredevil and Iron Man. Those three seemed like the kind of adult I aspired to be, with cool jobs, cool hobbies (superheroing), and cool chicks." [...] In 2010, Comics Bulletin ranked McGregor and Graham's run on Jungle Action third on its list of the [...] "Top 10 1970s Marvels".|$|E

5000|$|The {{religious}} {{history of}} the Kongo is complex, particularly after the ruling class of the Kingdom of Kongo accepted Christianity {{at the start of}} the 16th-century.

[...] The Kongo people had diverse views, with traditional religious ideas best developed in the small northern Kikongo-speaking area, and this region neither converted to Christianity nor participated in slave trade until the 19th-century.|$|R
