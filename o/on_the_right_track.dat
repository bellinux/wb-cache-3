5|$|The video {{begins as}} the protagonist parks {{her car and}} cries {{following}} an argument she has had with her lover. She then leaves the car, walks towards the sea, and lets down her hair. Flashbacks of {{the woman and her}} lover on the beach are shown. With teary eyes, she heads into the sea as waves break the shore. Back in the car, she imagines her lover holding her hands. The video transitions into color, as Beyoncé's character appears on the beach in a green dress and holds a rose without its petals, which she later restores. The video then flashes back to black-and-white memories of the woman resting her head on her lover's shoulder. She eventually realizes that she must set her relationship back <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>track.</b> In the end, she drives off with a smile.|$|E

Johann von Klenau would later be awarded the Military Order of Maria Theresa for his actions {{at the battle of}} Wagram and gallant rearguard actions after that battle. Meanwhile, Archduke Charles of Austria-Teschen regrouped a large force at Jetzelsdorf, on the Pulkau river, but he later evacuated this position, after receiving intelligence that a French force was approaching Znaim from the east. The next major combat would be the one at Znaim, where the Austrians demanded an armistice.|$|E

25|$|French {{philosopher and}} {{mathematician}} René Descartes {{was the first}} to propose a model for the origin of the Solar System in his Le Monde (ou Traité de lumière) which he wrote in 1632 and 1633 and for which he delayed publication because of the Inquisition and it was published only after his death in 1664. In his view, the Universe was filled with vortices of swirling particles and the Sun and planets had condensed from a particularly large vortex that had somehow contracted, which explained the circular motion of the planets and was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>track</b> with condensation and contraction.

25|$|In {{front of}} a crowd of about 1,000 people at Centurion – usually figures more {{associated}} with domestic cricket matches – Africa won {{the first of three}} ODIs. The African side included ten South Africans and two Kenyans – and one of the Kenyans was substituted for a South African without getting the chance to bat. Zaheer Khan made early breakthroughs as Africa collapsed to 57 for 5 – Justin Ontong and Steve Tikolo both dismissed for ducks – but Ashwell Prince and Mark Boucher set Africa back <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>track</b> with an 86-run partnership. Prince finished on 78 not out as he ran out of partners to bat with, Africa eventually being dismissed for 198. Asia, however, lost wickets at regular intervals, but a 24-run ninth-wicket partnership between Zaheer Khan and Shoaib Akhtar looked to turn it Asia's way. Asia needed to eke out five runs for the last wicket, with twenty-two balls to spare, but Ashish Nehra was bowled by a straight delivery from ODI debutant Dale Steyn, and Asia finished two runs short of victory.|$|E
25|$|Sly {{signed with}} Warner Bros. and {{recorded}} Back <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Right</b> <b>Track</b> (1979). Although the album featured contributions from Freddie and Rose Stone, Sly remained unable {{to return to}} the success of his late '60s and early '70s fame. He toured with George Clinton and Funkadelic during the late 1970s and early 1980s, and also appeared on the 1981 Funkadelic album The Electric Spanking of War Babies. That year, Clinton and Sly began work on a new Sly Stone album; however, recording halted when Clinton and Funkadelic disputed with and left Warner Bros. Records in late 1981. When Sly disappeared into seclusion, producer Stewart Levine completed the album, which was released as Ain't But the One Way in 1982. The album sold poorly and received mixed critical reception, but Sly made an appearance on Late Night With David Letterman that year. Overcome by drug addictions, Sly Stone disappeared from the limelight and entered drug rehabilitation in 1984, at the insistence of his old friend Bobby Womack. Sly continued sporadically releasing new singles and collaborations until a 1987 arrest and conviction for cocaine possession and use. Afterwards, he stopped releasing music.|$|E

50|$|First {{of all the}} Prime Minister must listen a lot, {{and when}} deep {{disagreements}} occur, he must suggest {{a solution to the}} matter. This can be done in different ways. Sometimes during the discussion, I note the elements of the problem and think of a proposal I can formulate to the Council (cabinet), the Secretary taking notes. The Ministers then insist on changing game ages. The Prime Minister can also make a proposal which leaves enough room for amendments in order to keep <b>the</b> current discussion <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>tracks.</b> When a solution must be found in order to reach a consensus, he can force one or two Ministers to join or resign.|$|R

He said [...] "A number of key witnesses have already been located, interviewed and are assisting the investigation. All persons screened to date have been eliminated against the DNA profile.

500|$|After an unglamorous decade, IFK {{were led}} by manager and retired footballer Bertil Johansson to a {{surprising}} championship title in 1969. The following season {{was one of the}} darkest in their history. IFK were relegated, and unlike previous relegations they did not make an immediate return. After three seasons in the second league IFK had lost all signs of being a team from Allsvenskan, and had still not managed to gain promotion. But after hard work from board member Anders Bernmar and others to get the club <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>track,</b> IFK were promoted to Allsvenskan in 1976. In 1979, IFK hired Sven-Göran Eriksson as manager. He introduced the 4–4–2 system with [...] "pressure and support"—called the Swenglish model—which would give IFK great success later on, and his first season at the club ended with a second place in Allsvenskan and the club's first gold medal in Svenska Cupen.|$|E
500|$|Richard H. Kline {{served as}} the film's cinematographer.

It's a way of everybody being on the same wavelength." [...] Kline would recall {{that there was not}} a single [...] "easy" [...] shot to produce for the picture, as each scene required special consideration. The bridge, for example, was lit with a low density of light to make the console monitors display better. It was hard to frame shots so that reflections of the crew in monitors or light spilling through floor grilles were not seen in the final print.|$|E

[...] Jesus Yanez-Reyes from Northern Arizona News complimented Shakira's vocal delivery and songwriting, and felt the combination of rock and Latin music in the song made it [...] "reminiscent" [...] of Shakira's earlier work. Reyes also praised its placement as the opening track of the album and commented: [...] "Undoubtedly, this song starts the album off <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>track,</b> with only higher expectations to come."
