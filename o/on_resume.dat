50|$|In {{a related}} issue some client groups tend {{to reject the}} {{interventions}} made by professional career counselors preferring {{to rely on the}} advice of peers or superiors within their own profession. Jackson et al. found that 44% of doctors in training felt that senior members of their own profession were best placed to give careers advice. Furthermore, it is recognised that the giving of career advice is something that is widely spread through a range of formal and informal roles. In addition to career counselors it is also common for psychologists, teachers, managers, trainers and Human Resources (HR) specialists to give formal support in career choices. Similarly it is also common for people to seek informal support from friends and family around their career choices and to bypass career professionals altogether. Today increasingly people rely on career web portals to seek advice <b>on</b> <b>resume</b> writing and handling interviews; as also to research on various professions and companies. It has even become possible to take vocational assessments online.|$|E

Most recruiters indicate that internships, part-time jobs, and leadership positions in university organi-zations are better indicators of employability than classroom experiences. Recent changes in marketing/business peda-gogy have led to more classes in which active learning approaches with client projects, field experiences, and skill-building activities are used.

An online survey method of data collection was used during which participants constructed a resume and filled out various measures pertaining to individual difference and resume misrepresentation. The results of this study provide an initial understanding of the existing categories of resume misrepresentations and the extent to which participants misrepresent. Findings indicate interconnected relationships between acceptability of resume misrepresentations, actual resume misrepresentations, conscientiousness and honesty/humility.

I used a variety of data sources including a literature review, personal observations, and reflections as well as secondary data sources from workshop evaluations and unsolicited feedback emails from participants. Findings from the self-study indicated that adult learners who experience entertaining and fun-filled lessons that use appropriate humour have better learning results, are more confident, and are better prepared to apply skills required for achieving career goals. Further, I learned in my practice that my challenge as an adult educator is to ensure humour is appropriately used and adds value to the learning rather than being the focus of the teaching...|$|E
