5|$|In the meantime, Nikephoros' murderer and successor, John I Tzimiskes, {{was unable}} to {{intervene}} in person in the east due to the more menacing invasion of the Balkans by Sviatoslav I of Kiev. As a result, he sent a small force under a trusted eunuch of his household, the patrikios Nicholas, who according to the contemporary Leo the Deacon was experienced in battle, to relieve the siege. In the meantime, the siege of Antioch had continued for five months over winter and into spring, without result. At some point, a Fatimid detachment—according to Ibn al-Dawadari 4,000 men under a Berber chieftain called Aras and a former emir of Tarsus, Ibn az-Zayyat—moved north against Alexandretta, where the Byzantine relief army had camped. Informed of their approach, the Byzantine commander vacated the camp and placed his troops in ambush. Finding the enemy encampment deserted, the Fatimid troops began to plunder it, heedless <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b> At that moment, Nicholas launched a surprise attack from all sides and the Fatimid force disintegrated; most of the Muslim army perished, but Aras with Ibn az-Zayyat managed to escape.|$|E
5|$|While in Asnières Van Gogh painted parks, {{restaurants}} and the Seine, including Bridges across the Seine at Asnières. In November 1887, Theo and Vincent befriended Paul Gauguin {{who had just}} arrived in Paris. Towards {{the end of the}} year, Vincent arranged an exhibition alongside Bernard, Anquetin, and probably Toulouse-Lautrec, at the Grand-Bouillon Restaurant du Chalet, 43 avenue de Clichy, Montmartre. In a contemporary account, Bernard wrote that the exhibition was ahead <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> in Paris. There Bernard and Anquetin sold their first paintings, and Van Gogh exchanged work with Gauguin. Discussions on art, artists, and their social situations started during this exhibition, continued and expanded to include visitors to the show, like Camille Pissarro and his son Lucien, Signac and Seurat. In February 1888, feeling worn out from life in Paris, Van Gogh left, having painted more than 200 paintings during his two years there. Hours before his departure, accompanied by Theo, he paid his first and only visit to Seurat in his studio.|$|E

25|$|In 1909 Hornsby's {{showed the}} British Army their invention, who were bemused, but took the idea {{no further than}} that, {{although}} they subsequently bought four caterpillar tractors in 1910 to tow artillery. A short time later, Hornsbys sold the patent for the caterpillar track in 1914 to The Holt Manufacturing Company of California, USA for $8,000, having only sold one caterpillar tractor commercially. Hornsby's design was far ahead <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> around at the time. Through ownership of the patent, this company became the successful Caterpillar Inc. Tractor Company. Benjamin Holt even {{claimed to be the}} real inventor. In December 1914 the British Army's Colonel Ernest Swinton saw one of Holt's caterpillar tractors towing a piece of artillery, and realised its potential as an attack vehicle. One year later the tank was born (using Hornsby's initial designs), being made in nearby Lincoln by William Foster. It first saw action at the Battle of Flers-Courcelette on 15 September 1916.|$|E
25|$|It {{is inconceivable}} that inanimate brute matter should, without the {{mediation}} of something else which is not material, operate upon and affect other matter, without mutual contact, as it must do if gravitation {{in the sense of}} Epicurus be essential and inherent in it. And this is one reason why I desired you would not ascribe 'innate gravity' to me. That gravity should be innate, inherent, and essential to matter, so that one body may act upon another at a distance, through a vacuum, without the mediation <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else,</b> by and through which their action and force may be conveyed from one to another, is to me so great an absurdity, that I believe no man who has in philosophical matters a competent faculty of thinking can ever fall into it. Gravity must be caused by an agent acting constantly according to certain laws; but whether this agent be material or immaterial, I have left to the consideration of my readers.|$|E

Friedman described the stories as, [...] "candy apples without the apples - all sugary, and gooey and sweet, with not much <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> to support it". After initially having this stance for the entire series, including an early opinion on the anime version, Friedman later changed her opinion slightly, writing that [...] " [...] turned out pretty good". She went on to say, [...] "There's no denying that Strawberry Panic! wasn't brilliant, but considering that {{it was meant to be}} trashy, it pulled out a few moments of dignity and elegance out of the trash heap."

Scholar Bruce Franklin referred to it in 1980 as a [...] "bugle-blowing, drum-beating glorification" [...] of military service, and wrote that militarism and imperialism were the explicit message of the book. Science fiction writer Dean McLaughlin called it [...] "a book-length recruiting poster". In 1968 science fiction critic Alexei Panshin called Starship Troopers a militaristic polemic and compared it to a recruiting film, stating that it [...] "purports to show {{the life of a}} typical soldier, with a soundtrack commentary by earnest sincere Private Jones who interprets what we see for us." [...] Panshin stated that there was no [...] "sustained human conflict" [...] in the book: instead, [...] "All the soldiers we see are tough, smart, competent, cleancut, clean-shaven, and noble." [...] Panshin, a veteran of the peacetime military, argued that Heinlein glossed over the reality of military life, and that the Terran Federation-Arachnid conflict existed simply because, [...] "Starship troopers are not half so glorious sitting on their butts polishing their weapons for the tenth time for lack <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> to do." [...] Literature scholar George Slusser, in describing the novel as [...] "wrong-headed and retrogressive", argued that calling its ideology militarism or imperialism was inadequate, as these descriptions suggested an economic motive. Slusser instead says that Heinlein advocates for a complete [...] "technological subjugation of nature", of which the Arachnids are a symbol, and that this subjugation itself is depicted as a sign of human advancement.|$|E
