5|$|Though Marco Polo never {{produced}} a map that illustrated his journey, his family drew several maps to the Far East {{based on the}} wayward's accounts. These collection of maps were signed by Polo's three daughters: Fantina, Bellela and Moreta. Not <b>only</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> contain maps of his journey, but also sea routes to Japan, Siberia's Kamchatka Peninsula, the Bering Strait and even to the coastlines of Alaska, centuries before the rediscovery of the Americas by Europeans.|$|E
5|$|The {{substance}} Rhoca-Gil {{was used}} to fix the leakages, but the substance failed to work properly. Not <b>only</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> fail to polymerize and stop the leaks, it also contaminated the surroundings with acrylamide. The entire process of fixing the leak and cleaning up the toxicity delayed {{the process of building}} the tunnel by one year; and it was first opened on 22 August 1999. Further complications arose due to conflicts between NSB Gardermobanen and the construction company. Retrospective surveys showed a lack of control and reporting procedures during incidents that should have been addressed in 1995, and were never taken seriously. About sixty houses received damage due to the construction of the tunnel. An evaluation performed by the Ministry of Transport and Communications showed that NOK500 million was used on fixing the leaks; however, the report claimed this was, to a large extent, a waste of money due to inefficient engineering procedures. The same report criticized the planning and organization of the entire construction of the railway.|$|E

25|$|Although powerful, the {{internal}} modem was commercially impractical. Not <b>only</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> require special driver software, but a different hardware design {{was needed for}} every computer bus, including Apple II, S-100, TRS-80, and others. Some popular computers, like the Atari 400, did not even integrate internal slots. An obvious solution was to use the RS-232 serial port; modems were serial devices and generally driven off RS-232 anyway, and most computer designs included an RS-232 port, or some variant.|$|E

25|$|That the {{original}} {{creators of the}} movement were now passing the torch to another batch of bands and musicians was a historically enormous development: it would set Argentine rock apart. While in other countries {{the original}} wave {{in the wake of}} the US or British rock invasions never sustained itself completely and quieted down, in Argentina not <b>only</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> continue, it evolved into its own realm and style more independent from rock music of the United States or Britain. From 1965, Argentine rock, with a solid line of ascent and evolution, became the most important rock movement in the Spanish-speaking world.|$|E

25|$|Experts posit {{that the}} {{construction}} of the wall {{was the result of the}} work of Nguyễn Dynasty soldiers and collaboration between the Viet and the H're minority, who seldom had peaceful relations. Residents of either side of the wall relate that the wall was erected by their forebears to prevent invasions by the opposing side. Not <b>only</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> define the territorial borders of the respective peoples, it also afforded security and furthered trade. While the H're employed their expertise in rock arrangement, the Viet and the soldiers built the earthenwork. Similar rock arrangement methods have been found on Lý Sơn Island.|$|E

25|$|Although {{limited in}} numbers and quality, airpower {{proved to be}} one of the {{greatest}} assets that the British possessed during this conflict. Not <b>only</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> allow them to extend their reach beyond the border and bomb Kabul, but it also enabled them to harass the retreating enemy and to break up tribesmen as they attempted to form larger groups prior to launching an attack. The ability of the British to project airpower, even small scale raids, had considerable psychological effects. For example, the single-plane raid on the palace which took place of 24 May 1919, although effecting little actual damage nevertheless greatly impacted the morale of Afghan citizens and contributed to bringing King Amanullah to request an armistice.|$|E
25|$|Not <b>only</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> face {{its sister}} Mark Goodson-packaged game Classic Concentration on NBC, {{but the new}} Now You See It faced a vastly changed {{television}} market {{from the days of}} the original. Syndicated talk shows such as Donahue and Sally Jessy Raphael had become popular and made games like Now You See It seem tame and quaint by comparison. Further, daytime viewership had declined greatly overall since 1975, thanks to a surge in cable and pay channels giving the viewer more choices than just the three major networks. With a greater possibility for local advertising revenue from the talk shows, numerous stations passed on the game despite the solid performance of its lead-in, Family Feud.|$|E
25|$|Nystatin is a polyene {{antifungal}} drug {{to which}} many molds and yeast infections are sensitive.

Not <b>only</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> cure many serious fungal infections of the skin, mouth, throat, and intestinal tract, but it could also be combined with antibacterial drugs to balance their side effects. Over the years, Nystatin proved effective not only in fighting human diseases, but was also used to stop fungal growth on flood-damaged works of art in Florence, Italy. It also showed effectiveness in slowing the spread of Dutch Elm Disease, a fungal disease of elm trees spread by the elm bark beetle.|$|E

25|$|Following the Russian October Revolution of 1917, the new Bolshevik {{government}} {{signed a}} peace treaty with Germany. The collapse of the Russian front presented a tremendous problem to the Entente powers, since not <b>only</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> allow Germany to shift troops and war material from its eastern front to the west, but it also {{made it possible for}} Germany to secure the huge stockpiles of supplies that had been accumulating at Murmansk, Arkhangelsk and Vladivostok. In addition, the 50,000 man Czechoslovak Legion, fighting {{on the side of the}} Allies, was now behind enemy lines, and was attempting to fight its way out through the east to Vladivostok along the Bolshevik-held Trans-Siberian Railway.|$|E
25|$|When WCW was {{purchased}} by WWF owner Vince McMahon in 2001, Page {{was one of the}} few major WCW stars (along with Booker T and Buff Bagwell) who accepted buyouts of their AOL Time Warner contracts in order to immediately sign with McMahon.

Page revealed he didn't care about Sara; he <b>only</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> to make an impact and wanted to take on the biggest dog in the yard. Page soon joined the Alliance during the WCW Invasion. At King of the Ring, he fought The Undertaker in an unsanctioned brawl that was never announced as an official match.|$|E
25|$|The Escarpment of {{that time}} was more {{gradually}} sloped than it is now, with much loose rock from its uplift. Sometime between 100,000 and 300,000 years ago, the Illinoian glaciation swept through the region. This had two impacts on the Escarpment. Not <b>only</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> scour and steepen its slopes, leaving the many bare cliffs found today, it carved out both Platte and Kaaterskill cloves from the narrower, shorter and shallower valleys of smaller streams. In the latter, the gouge in the Escarpment was so deep it resulted in stream capture, as the outflow streams from North-South Lake, the headwaters of what would eventually be named Schoharie Creek instead flowed down into the new gorge. This both created Kaaterskill Falls, one of the Catskills' early tourist attractions, and relocated {{the source of the}} Schoharie to its present location.|$|E

25|$|Although Fine Gael gained seats, {{it crossed}} the Dáil chamber to the Opposition benches.

The Green Party picked up an extra seat, with John Gormley elected in Dublin South-East. He was elected by just over 30 votes after a marathon recount, lasting four days, saw Progressive Democrat Michael McDowell defeated. The main feature of the election, however, was {{the collapse of the}} Labour Party vote. Not <b>only</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> lose seats it had picked up in the 1992 general election, when its vote was an at all-time high – such as in Clare and Laois–Offaly – but it also lost reasonably safe seats, such as in Dublin North, Dublin Central and Cork South-Central.|$|E
25|$|General Augusto Pinochet {{was indicted}} {{for human rights}} {{violations}} committed in his native Chile by Spanish magistrate Baltasar Garzón on 10 October 1998. He was arrested in London six days later and held {{for a year and}} a half before finally being released by the British government in March 2000. Authorized to freely return to Chile, Pinochet was there first indicted by judge Juan Guzmán Tapia, and charged with a number of crimes, before dying on 10 December 2006, without having been convicted in any case. His arrest in London made the front-page of newspapers worldwide as not <b>only</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> involve the head of the military dictatorship that ruled Chile between 1973 and 1990, but it was the first time that several European judges applied the principle of universal jurisdiction, declaring themselves competent to judge crimes committed by former heads of state, despite local amnesty laws.|$|E
25|$|On the whole, {{industrialisation}} in Germany must {{be considered}} to have been positive in its effects. Not <b>only</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> change society and the countryside, and finally the world...it created the modern world we live in. It solved the problems of population growth, under-employment and pauperism in a stagnating economy, and abolished dependency on the natural conditions of agriculture, and finally hunger. It created huge improvements in production and both short- and long-term improvements in living standards. However, {{in terms of social}} inequality, it can be assumed that it did not change the relative levels of income. Between 1815 and 1873 the statistical distribution of wealth was on the order of 77% to 23% for entrepreneurs and workers respectively. On the other hand, new problems arose, in the form of interrupted growth and new crises, such as urbanisation, 'alienation', new underclasses, proletariat and proletarian misery, new injustices and new masters and, eventually, class warfare.|$|E
