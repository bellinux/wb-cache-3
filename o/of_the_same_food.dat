500|$|Police apprehended Lee Woods at {{the home}} of his girlfriend, Nicole Bostic (Dexter Bostic’s sister) in Far Rockaway, Queens, New York, on July 10. He {{identified}} Bostic and Ellis as his accomplices, and told police that while he knew his friends had guns, he was unaware they were going to open fire on the officers. City detectives were tipped to the whereabouts of Bostic and Ellis on the afternoon of July 11, after being contacted by a man who, unaware of the suspects' fugitive status, assisted the suspects in their escape by driving them across Long Island, from Far Rockaway to Port Jefferson, New York, before riding a ferry across Long Island Sound to Bridgeport, Connecticut. They then drove west, stopping at a supermarket in Tarrytown, New York, where they purchased food and water, before continuing on to Pennsylvania, according to New York City Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly. Remnants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>food</b> the men purchased were found in a Pennsylvania forest, where investigators had eventually tracked the suspects.|$|E

60|$|It was only, however, {{within a}} few months, that he had {{appeared}} among the mountains that surrounded Templeton. To the hut of the old hunter he seemed peculiarly welcome; and, as the habits of the Leather- Stocking were so nearly assimilated {{to those of the}} savages, the conjunction of their interests excited no surprise. They resided in the same cabin, ate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>food,</b> and were chiefly occupied in the same pursuits.|$|E

50|$|Mexican juice bars serve a lot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>foods</b> as <b>the</b> popular {{fruit and}} juice stands and {{roadside}} carts in Mexico. <b>The</b> advantage <b>of</b> a juice bar {{is that it}} can provide more menu items, refrigerate its ingredients, keeping them fresh for longer periods of time, and juice bars are also generally cleaner and more comfortable as they offer guests a place to sit down and enjoy their food.|$|R
50|$|Today the {{cemetery}} is maintained by many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pioneer's descendants involved through the Fort Kissimmee Association. The association meets every Memorial Day weekend to camp and clean {{the cemetery}}. On <b>the</b> Sunday <b>of</b> Memorial weekend, many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family members and old timers come to enjoy a big Bar-B-Que consisting of wild razorback hogs, home grown beef and swamp cabbage. This is some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>foods</b> their ancestors lived on when Fort Kissimmee was a thriving community.|$|R
60|$|Perhaps {{they were}} out of season, or perhaps there was {{something}} wrong in the sea about my island. But at least I had no sooner eaten my first meal than I was seized with giddiness and retching, and lay for a long time no better than dead. A second trial <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>food</b> (indeed I had no other) did better with me, and revived my strength. But as long as I was on the island, I never knew what to expect when I had eaten; sometimes all was well, and sometimes I was thrown into a miserable sickness; nor could I ever distinguish what particular fish it was that hurt me.|$|E
6000|$|We {{have seen}} how Mrs. Firkin, the lady's maid, as soon as any event of {{importance}} to the Crawley family came to her knowledge, felt bound to communicate it to Mrs. Bute Crawley, at the Rectory; and have before mentioned how particularly kind and attentive that good-natured lady was to Miss Crawley's confidential servant. She had been a gracious friend to Miss Briggs, the companion, also; and had secured the latter's good-will {{by a number of}} those attentions and promises, which cost so little in the making, and are yet so valuable and agreeable to the recipient. Indeed every good economist and manager of a household must know how cheap and yet how amiable these professions are, and what a flavour they give to the most homely dish in life. Who was the blundering idiot who said that [...] "fine words butter no parsnips"? Half the parsnips of society are served and rendered palatable with no other sauce. As the immortal Alexis Soyer can make more delicious soup for a half-penny than an ignorant cook can concoct with pounds of vegetables and meat, so a skilful artist will make a few simple and pleasing phrases go farther than ever so much substantial benefit-stock {{in the hands of a}} mere bungler. Nay, we know that substantial benefits often sicken some stomachs; whereas, most will digest any amount of fine words, and be always eager for more <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>food.</b> Mrs. Bute had told Briggs and Firkin so often of the depth of her affection for them; and what she would do, if she had Miss Crawley's fortune, for friends so excellent and attached, that the ladies in question had the deepest regard for her; and felt as much gratitude and confidence as if Mrs. Bute had loaded them with the most expensive favours.|$|E
50|$|The Lowcountry {{region of}} the coastal Carolinas, Virginia, and Georgia shares many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>food</b> {{resources}} as the Upper Gulf Coast: fish, shrimp, oysters, rice, and okra. It also displays some similarities to Creole and Cajun cuisines.|$|E
50|$|In an {{experiment}} on {{two groups of}} rock hyraxes fed hardened or softened versions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>foods,</b> <b>the</b> animals fed softer food had significantly narrower and shorter faces and thinner and shorter mandibles than animals fed hard food. Experiments have shown similar results in other animals, including primates, supporting the theory that masticatory stress during childhood affects jaw development. Only one small study has investigated this effect in humans. Children chewed a hard resinous gum for {{two hours a day}} and showed increased facial growth.|$|R
50|$|Food {{markets in}} Thailand, large open air halls with {{permanent}} stalls, tend {{to operate as}} a collection of street stalls, each vendor with their own set of tables and providing (limited) service, although some resemble the regular food courts at shopping malls and large supermarkets, with service counters and <b>the</b> communal use <b>of</b> tables. Food courts and food markets offer many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>foods</b> as street stalls, both pre-cooked as well as made to order. Night food markets, in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> a collection of street stalls and mobile vendors, spring up in parking lots, along busy streets, and at temple fairs and local festivals in the evenings, when the temperatures are more agreeable and people have finished work.|$|R
2500|$|Pirates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic ate much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>foods</b> {{as their}} {{mainstream}} mariner cohorts. Often {{they would get}} more of it, but ideally, they would get far greater quality food. Mariners in the merchant and naval service were often given meager amounts of low quality sustenance. During a typical week five non-pirate sailors might share four or five pounds (pre-salted weight) of beef, and five pounds of bread. Scarcity of food might be the main reason some sailors turned to pirating, like pirate John Phillips who [...] "ranted and raved" [...] about the merchant John Wingfield, claiming that he starved his men. The primary difference between legal mariners and their unlawful counterparts is that they hoped to find an abundant supply <b>of</b> food with <b>the</b> capturing <b>of</b> vessels.|$|R
50|$|Females gather pollen and nectar as {{food from}} a variety of plants, and resins, mud and other {{materials}} for nest building. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>food</b> plants are also used by the males, which leave the nest upon hatching and do not return.|$|E
50|$|Tohunga were {{imbued with}} the mysterious {{essences}} of the tapu {{because of their}} knowledge of ancient and potent karakia, religious ceremonies and their office as mediums of communication with the dread atua. All ariki also had a strong personal tapu which prevented any common person eating out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>food</b> basket or using anything belonging to the chief.|$|E
5000|$|According to Virginia state {{inspection}} records, the PCA blanching {{operations in}} Suffolk, Virginia, had some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>food</b> safety problems {{that would be}} found in the company’s Georgia plant (see below). Inspection in 2008 found mold on [...] "totes" [...] holding peanuts, counted 43 mouse droppings on the floor, and saw a live bird walking and flying inside the warehouse.|$|E
40|$|Anecdotal {{evidence}} suggests that astronauts' perceptions of foods in space flight may differ from their perceptions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>foods</b> on Earth. Fluid shifts toward the head experienced in space may alter the astronauts' sensitivity to odors and tastes, producing altered perceptions. Our objective {{was to determine whether}} head-down bed rest, which produces similar fluid shifts, would produce changes in sensitivity to taste, odor or trigeminal sensations. Six subjects were rested three times prior to bed rest, three times during bed rest and two times after bed rest to determine their threshold sensitivity to the odors isoamylbutyrate and menthone, the tastants sucrose, sodium chloride, citric acid, quinine and monosodium glutamate, and to capsaicin. Thresholds were measured using a modified staircase procedure. Self-reported congestion was also recorded at each test time. Thresholds for monosodium glutamate where slightly higher during bed rest. None <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other thresholds were altered by bed rest...|$|R

40|$|Seventy-two 4 -year-old Chinese and Indian {{children}} were {{paired with a}} friend and with an acquaintance in their class. One child (sharer) was given 10 pieces each {{of his or her}} preferred and nonpreferred foods, whereas the partner (recipient) was given one piece <b>of</b> each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>foods.</b> Sharing incidents were classified to indicate whether they were initiated by the sharer (spontaneous sharing) or due to the recipients' behavior (elicited and passive sharing). Friendship did not influence either the quantity or quality of sharing. Results indicated that young Asian {{children were}} more likely to share spontaneously and less likely to elicit sharing. Chinese children showed more spontaneous sharing than did Indian children; <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> sharing incidents in the Indian sample were classified as passive sharing. Findings highlight <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> cultural beliefs on young children's behavior and <b>of</b> considering <b>the</b> interactive effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sharers' and recipients' behaviors on each other. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
50|$|One of {{the unique}} aspects of the Zwei!! series is that {{defeating}} enemies does not award experience points, needed to level up, unlike in other RPGs. Instead enemies may drop food or coins when defeated. Food is very important as {{not only does it}} restore health, but it is the only commodity that awards experience points. Ten types <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>food</b> can also be combined in the restaurant, found at the main village, to create a higher tier food item that awards more experience in comparison to the individual items.|$|E
50|$|Instead of {{defeating}} {{enemies to}} level up like in most RPGs, experience points are gained by consuming food items, which are dropped by monsters and obtained through other methods. Ten <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>food</b> item can be combined, at Puck Village's restaurant, {{to create a}} higher tier food item that awards more experience than the individual items. Early on, players can obtain a pet, ranging from various species of cats and dogs, who will follow the main characters, assisting in collecting items dropped by enemies. Letting pets tag along also unlocks the highest level combo attacks.|$|E
50|$|BV {{provides}} a good measure of the usability of proteins in a diet and also plays a valuable role in detection of some metabolic diseases. BV is, however, a scientific variable determined under very strict and unnatural conditions. It is not a test designed to evaluate the usability of proteins whilst an organism is in everyday life — indeed the BV of a diet will vary greatly depending on age, weight, health, sex, recent diet, current metabolism, etc. of the organism. In addition BV <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>food</b> varies significantly species to species. Given these limitations BV is still relevant to everyday diet to some extent. No matter the individual or their conditions a protein source with high BV, such as egg, will always be more easily used than a protein source with low BV.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: There is {{inconsistency}} between {{current in}} vitro digestion methods {{with regard to}} accommodation of a (salivary) α-amylase exposure during the oral phase. <b>The</b> effect <b>of</b> a salivary α-amylase pre-exposure on subsequent in vitro starch digestion curve profiles for various foods was investigated. Foods were chewed, expectorated and the boluses left to rest for 0 – 15 min. During pancreatic digestion, aliquots were taken and hydrolysis curves constructed for comparison against those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>foods</b> comminuted with a manuallyoperated chopper, hence spared exposure to saliva. Hydrolysate aliquots taken at T 0 (time zero) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> digestion <b>of</b> chewed samples contained higher levels of glucose and dextrins compared with chopped samples. Pancreatin activity immediately overwhelmed differences in sugar released due to salivary amylase activity. Within 10 min no differences were detectable between hydrolysis curves for chewed and chopped foods. Salivary amylase pretreatment does {{not contribute to the}} robustness or relative accuracy of in vitro methods...|$|R
50|$|New Zealand had no {{land mammals}} {{other than the}} lesser short-tailed bat (Mystacina tuberculata) prior to human occupation, and the house mouse {{is one of many}} species that have been introduced. Mice are {{responsible}} for a reduction in native bird species since they eat some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>foods</b> as birds. They are also known to kill lizards and have a large effect on native insects. Gough Island in the South Atlantic is used by 20 species of seabirds for breeding, including almost all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world's Tristan albatross (Diomedea dabbenena) and Atlantic petrel (Pterodroma incerta). Until house mice arrived on the island in the 19th century with sailors, the birds did not have any mammalian predators. The mice have since grown unusually large and have learned to attack albatross chicks, which can be nearly 1 m tall, but are largely immobile, by working in groups and gnawing on them until they bleed to death.|$|R
40|$|Brain regions {{involved}} in <b>the</b> reappraisal <b>of</b> tasty but unhealthy foods are {{of special interest}} for <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> new therapeutic interventions for obesity, such as non-invasive brain stimulation or neurofeedback. Here, we visually presented food items (i. e., high/low caloric) to obese and lean individuals during EEG recordings, while they either admitted or regulated their food desire. During admitting the desire for low and high calorie foods, obese as well as lean individuals showed higher activity in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), whereas the right frontal operculum was {{involved in}} <b>the</b> reappraisal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>foods,</b> suggesting interplay between executive control and gustatory regions. Only in lean participants, we found an interaction between calorie content and the regulate/admit conditions in bilateral anterior insular cortices, suggesting that the anterior insula, assumed to primarily host gustatory processes, also underpins higher cognitive processes involved in food choices, such as evaluating the foods’ calorie content for its reappraisal...|$|R
50|$|Þorramatur {{has also}} changed to reflect {{changing}} tastes. The traditional method of storing meat by submerging it in fermented whey, {{which gives the}} food a characteristic sour taste, is unfamiliar to most generations of Icelanders alive today and therefore a Þorramatur buffet usually has a choice between sour and unsoured pieces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>food,</b> served on separate trays as the acid readily contaminates food with which it comes into contact. However, some of the food, for example the rams' testicles, has to be cured by the acid before serving. A number of foods {{have been added to}} the buffet that have never gone out of fashion in Icelandic cuisine, such as smoked lamb, fermented shark and dried fish, which are still commonly consumed in all seasons. Þorramatur also may include some novelties, traditional food that was strictly regional and even rare as such, and unfamiliar even to the older generation. Examples include seals' flippers, known only from the Breiðafjörður area, which is sometimes, albeit rarely, served as part of Þorramatur.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{challenges}} two {{generalizations about}} the Roman diet: that the Roman nonelite were predominantly vegetarians, and that food shops {{were used by}} non-elites while elites dined at home. With an overview of relevant literature and bioarchaeology, I argue that upper and lower classes ate many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>foods,</b> expressing status via presentation, not ingredient. I also examine literary and archaeological evidence for food shops and conclude that the popular belief that they were used as <b>the</b> primary source <b>of</b> hot meals for the poor is unsupportable. Using {{a case study of}} food shops in Pompeii, I offer a model, based on spatial analysis of likely storage areas, of inventory volume and concomitant caloric output <b>of</b> two shops. <b>The</b> results indicate that <b>the</b> clientele <b>of</b> these shops were probably not <b>the</b> lower-class residents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surrounding neighborhood to <b>the</b> exclusion <b>of</b> elite members of society.

40|$|International audienceA {{preference}} for novelty paradigm {{was used to}} investigate whether mangabeys (Lophocebus albigena), an arboreal non-human primate species, were able to discriminate and to categorize different visual stimuli belonging to natural (food items) and abstract (non-food items) categories. In a comparative perspective human subjects were tested with the same procedure and the same stimuli. Two out of four mangabeys and three out of the four humans showed significant {{preference for}} novelty when comparing food versus non-food items. Hence they discriminated between these two sets of items. The two mangabeys and one non-adult human subject sorted the food items in one category, showing no preference for novelty when comparing known and unknown food-items and different views <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>food</b> items. In contrast the two adult human subjects who showed preference for novelty in the between-category, did not show preference for novelty when comparing known and unknown food-items but did show such a preference when comparing different views <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>food</b> items. Compared to human performances, {{the results suggest that}} mangabeys are able to form at least a perceptual category of natural, ecologically relevant stimuli...|$|E
40|$|Behavioral {{flexibility}} {{that requires}} behavioral inhibition has important fitness consequences. One task {{commonly used to}} assess behavioral inhibition is the reverse-reward task in which the subject is rewarded by the non selected items. Lemurs were tested {{for their ability to}} solve the qualitative version of the reverse-reward task with the choice between identical quantities of different food items instead of different quantities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>food.</b> Two of four subjects mastered the task without a correction procedure and were able to generalize the acquired rule to novel combinations of food. One of the two subjects competent on the quality version of the task could transfer this ability to different quantities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>food.</b> Our results are compared to lemurs ’ performances when tested under the quantitative version in a previous study and those of capuchin monkeys tested under a similar paradigm. The whole results suggest that the qualitative version of the reverse-reward task may be easier to master than its quantitative counterpart and that lemurs perform better than capuchin monkeys as they were able to later transfer the learning rule to the quantitative version of the task...|$|E
40|$|Background: In this study, {{the nature}} of food {{commercials}} in children′s television (TV) was monitored and analyzed; simultaneously, the relationship between recalling TV food commercials and children′s interest in them and in the consumption <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>food</b> products was evaluated. Methods: A total of 108 h children′s programs broadcast on two channels (Two and Amouzesh) of Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB) media organization were monitored (May 6 - 12, 2015). Simultaneously, a cross-sectional study using 403 primary schoolchildren (201 boys) in four schools of Shirvan, Northeast of Iran, was executed. The children were prompted to recall all TV commercials broadcast on IRIB. Meanwhile, they were directed to define {{in the list of}} recalled TV food commercials those were interested in and the commercials (food products) they actually were willing to consume. Results: Regarding the frequency and duration of broadcasting, food commercials ranked fifth and sixth, respectively. Fruit leather and plum paste were the most frequently broadcast food commercials. "High quality" (19 %), "good taste" (15 %), "novelty," and "message on nutritional composition" (13 %) were the most frequent messages used in promoting the sale of food products, respectively. In addition, focus on "high quality/precision in the preparation of the food products" was the most frequently used appeals in TV commercials. There was a significant relationship between recalling TV food commercials and the interest in five out of eight of the commercials (62. 5 %) (P < 0. 05). The relationship between recalling TV food commercials and the interest in the consumption <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>food</b> product ("Tomato paste B") was statistically significant for 12. 5 % of the commercials (P < 0. 05). Conclusions: TV food commercials do not encourage healthy eating. The current study provides convincing evidence for policy-makers and researchers {{to pay more attention to}} this area...|$|E

The kappa statistic for concordance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> retrospective and baseline reports {{was used as a}} summary measure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individual's ability to reproduce his or her earlier diet report. Reproducibility was estimated for total diet, represented by 83 foods, and for 9 subsets of foods of epidemiologic interest. In bivariate and multivariate analyses, reproducibility was strongly related to stability of diet; those whose diets changed least over the 15 -year period had greatest diet reproducibility. Greater total diet reproducibility was also found among men with higher education, among women of < 110 % desirable weight reporting no special diet and among women reporting no medications. Consistent with current models <b>of</b> memory, <b>the</b> retrospective report <b>of</b> diet was strongly related to <b>the</b> current report <b>of</b> diet. Agreement between the retrospective and baseline diet reports was greater than agreement between the current and baseline diet reports.
