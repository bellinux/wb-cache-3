5|$|FES is {{the oldest}} variant of Guinness that is still available, {{although}} its ingredients and production methods have varied over time. In 1824, it had an <b>original</b> <b>gravity</b> (OG) of 1082. After a peak in strength in 1840, when the beer had an OG of 1098, by 1860, the beer was reduced to its current standard strength of around 1075 OG. FES was originally brewed with pale and brown malts. Black malt was used from 1819, and by 1828 its use had entirely replaced brown malt. In 1883, the beer was produced with 85 per cent pale malt, 10 per cent amber malt and 5 per cent roasted malt. From 1929 – 1930 onwards, Guinness switched from using roasted malt in the beer's production to roasted barley. Amber malt continued {{to be added to}} the grist until 1940. Flaked barley was introduced in the early 1950s, and the hopping rate was decreased.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the Hamiltonian structure of linearized extended Hořava- Lifshitz gravity {{in a flat}} cosmological background following the Faddeev-Jackiw's Hamiltonian reduction formalism. The Hamiltonian structure of extended Hořava-Lifshitz gravity {{is similar to that}} of the projectable version of <b>original</b> Hořava-Lifshitz <b>gravity,</b> in which there is one primary constraint and so there are two physical degrees of freedom. We also find that extra scalar graviton mode in an inflationary background can be decoupled from the matter field in the infrared (IR) limit, but it is coupled to the matter field in a general cosmological background. But it is necessary to go beyond linear order in order to draw any conclusion of the strong coupling problem. Comment: 11 page...|$|R

50|$|This {{approach}} {{relies on}} the fact that dissolved sugars and alcohol each affect the density of beer differently. Since sugars are converted to alcohol during the process of fermentation, gravity can be used to estimate the final alcohol. In beer brewing, a distinction is made between the <b>original</b> <b>gravity,</b> the gravity of the wort before fermentation has begun, and the final gravity of the product when fermentation has completed. Since the concentration of sugars is directly proportional to the gravity, the <b>original</b> <b>gravity</b> gives a brewer an idea of the potential alcoholic strength of the final product. After fermentation, the differences between the final and original gravities indicates the amount of sugar converted into alcohol, allowing the concentration of alcoholic strength to be calculated.|$|E
50|$|In 2009, as the ship, now manned {{entirely by}} humans, was {{preparing}} for its maiden voyage to seek out alien cultures and promote peace (the initial goal was never to start a fight), giant alien humanoids called the Zentradi suddenly arrived in the Solar System with a force of several hundred ships. They were tasked with the mission of seeking out and capturing the spacecraft. When the SDF-1 Macross detected the Zentradi, its pre-programmed response was to fire its main cannon at the alien fleet, catching the humans completely off their guard. Unable to stop the cannon from firing, the humans were forced into a war with the aliens. During the failed attempt to take off with its <b>original</b> (alien) <b>gravity</b> control system, the anti-gravity generators tore through the ship's upper deck, leaving it to fall. Eventually the SDF-1 Macross had to take off using its Earth-made rocket thrusters.|$|R

40|$|We {{obtain the}} {{effective}} gravitational equations on the codimension- 2 and codimension- 1 branes in the cascading gravity model. We then apply our formulation to the cosmological case and obtain the effective Friedmann equations on the codimension- 2 brane, which are generically given {{in terms of}} integro-differential equations. Adopting an approximation for which {{the thickness of the}} codimension- 2 brane is much smaller than the Hubble horizon, we study the Minkowski and de Sitter codimension- 2 brane solutions. Studying the cosmological solutions shows that the cascading model exhibits the features necessary for degravitation of the cosmological constant. We also show that only the branch which does not have the smooth limit to the self-accelerating branch in five-dimensional model {{in the absence of the}} bulk gravity can satisfy the null energy condition as the criterion of the stability. Note that our solutions are obtained in a different setup from that of the <b>original</b> cascading <b>gravity</b> model in the sense that the codimension- 1 brane contains matter fields other than the pure tension.

40|$|We study {{a version}} of the {{recently}} proposed modified F(R) Hořava-Lifshitz gravity that abandons the projectability condition of the lapse variable. We discovered that the projectable version of this theory has a consistent Hamiltonian structure, and that the theory has interesting cosmological solutions which can describe the eras of accelerated expansion of the universe in a unified manner. The usual Hořava-Lifshitz gravity is a special case of our theory. Hamiltonian analysis of the non-projectable theory, however, shows that this theory has serious problems. These problems are compared with those found in the <b>original</b> Hořava-Lifshitz <b>gravity.</b> A general observation on the structure of the Poisson bracket of Hamiltonian constraints in all theories of the Hořava-Lifshitz type is made: in the resulting tertiary constraint the highest order spatial derivative of the lapse N is always of uneven order. Since the vanishing of the lapse (N= 0) is required by the preservation of the Hamiltonian constraints under time evolution, we conclude that the non-projectable version of the theory is physically inconsistent.

40|$|This study work {{deals with}} the {{determination}} of the gravimetric geoid model for Kazakhstan by using the KTH-method. A number of data sets were collected for this work, such as the gravity anomalies, high-resolution Digital Elevation Model (DEM), Global Geopotential Models (GGMs) and GPS/Levelling data. These data has been optimally combined through the KTH approach, developed at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm. According to this stochastic method, Stokes’ formula is being used with the <b>original</b> surface <b>gravity</b> anomaly, which combine with a GGM yields approximate geoid heights. The corrected geoid heights are then obtained by adding the topographic, downward continuation, atmospheric and ellipsoidal corrections to the approximate geoid heights. To compute the geoid model for Kazakhstan as accurately as possible with available data set different numerical tests have been performed: Choice of the best fit geopotential model in the computation area Investigations for the best choice of the initial condition for determination of the least-squares parameters Selection of the best parametric model for reducing the effect of the systematic error and data inconsistencies between computed geoid heights and GPS/Levelling heights.  Finally, 5 'x 5 ' Kazakh gravimetric geoid (KazGM 2010) has been modelled. ...|$|R
