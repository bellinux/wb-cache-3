5|$|A {{large number}} of {{soldiers}} {{who died in the}} war were never found, and similarly bodies were recovered that could not be identified; once again, this required new forms of memorial. The scale <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> was once again huge: 73,000 Allied dead were never found at the Somme, for example, either because their bodies had been lost, destroyed or were unrecognisable, more than one in ten of the losses in the battle.|$|E

2500|$|In 2009 the Azərbaycan Milli Bankı (National Bank of Azerbaijan) {{was renamed}} the [...] Azərbaycan Respublikasının Mərkəzi Bankı (Central Bank of Azerbaijan). In 2010, the 1-manat {{banknote}} was <b>issued</b> with <b>the</b> new name <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issuing</b> bank, in 2012 a 5-manat banknote was <b>issued</b> with <b>the</b> new name <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issuing</b> bank and in 2017 a 100-manat banknote dated 2013 was <b>issued</b> with <b>the</b> new name <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issuing</b> bank.|$|R

5|$|An {{important}} reason for this ambition is growing international concern about human-induced climate change. The Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution's proposal that carbon dioxide emissions should be reduced by 60% was incorporated into the UK government's 2003 Energy White Paper. The 2006 Stern Review proposed a 55% reduction by 2030. The recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Fourth Assessment Report has further increased the profile <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue.</b>|$|E
5|$|By the 1850s, {{whether or}} not species evolved was a subject of intense debate, with {{prominent}} scientists arguing both sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue.</b> The publication of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species fundamentally transformed the discussion over biological origins. Darwin argued that his branching version of evolution explained a wealth of facts in biogeography, anatomy, embryology, and other fields of biology. He also provided the first cogent mechanism by which evolutionary change could persist: his theory of natural selection.|$|E
5|$|During the {{petition}} drive, groups supporting Morse accused the firm collecting the signatures of hiring convicted felons and gathering personal information. Recall backers said that Morse's group was misleading the public. In addition, the recall drives brought in support from national groups {{on both sides}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue.</b> The National Rifle Association (NRA) supported the recall effort with mailers and donations. National groups opposing the recall included America Votes, believed to be financially supported by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, as well as California billionaire Eli Broad.|$|E
50|$|Linked timestamping creates {{time-stamp}} tokens {{which are}} dependent on each other, entangled into some authenticated data structure. Later modification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issued</b> time-stamps would invalidate this structure. <b>The</b> temporal order <b>of</b> <b>issued</b> time-stamps is also protected by this data structure, making backdating <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issued</b> time-stamps impossible, even by <b>the</b> <b>issuing</b> server itself.|$|R

5|$|Fraser {{was engaged}} to design the coin on the {{recommendation}} of the United States Commission of Fine Arts. The coins were flown from the San Francisco Mint, where they were struck, to Washington state by airplane as a publicity stunt. They sold badly; much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> was returned for redemption and melting, and the failure may have been a factor in one official's suicide. Due to the low number of surviving pieces, the coins are valuable today.|$|E
5|$|Gerber's defense {{cost him}} his life savings, {{some of which may}} have been in the form of bribes paid through his lawyer. The police never {{returned}} Gerber's personal papers, his typewriter or his remaining copies of Friendship and Freedom despite a court order compelling their return. The only concrete record of the newsletter's existence is a photograph of one issue in a German homophile magazine and a review <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> in a French homophile publication.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Beyoncé {{made the}} Time 100 list, with Baz Luhrmann writing: No one has that voice, no one moves {{the way she}} moves, no one can hold an {{audience}} the way she does... When Beyoncé does an album, when Beyoncé sings a song, when Beyoncé does anything, it's an event, and it's broadly influential. Right now, she is the heir-apparent diva of the USA – the reigning national voice. In 2014, Beyoncé was listed again on the Time 100 and also featured on the cover <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue.</b>|$|E

5|$|In May 2013 the {{investigation}} board was {{made aware of}} that two passengers had each their Mobira NMT-450 mobile telephone {{with them on the}} flights. As this had not been mentioned in the original report, AIBN conducted a review <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> and especially if the telephones could have influenced the vertical navigation. They concluded in December that this was not the case, as there were no indications of interferences and that there are no instances where electromagnetic interference has been a contributing cause to an aviation accident.|$|E
5|$|Individual {{school districts}} have responded to {{complaints}} by local Native American individuals and tribes, or have made changes due to an increased awareness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> among educators and students. New Native mascots have not been proposed in recent decades, or are withdrawn before becoming official due to public opposition. For example, in 2016 {{when one of the}} teams in the National College Prospects Hockey League (NCPHL) was announced as the Lake Erie Warriors with a caricature Mohawk logo it was immediate changed to the Lake Erie Eagles.|$|E
5|$|Initially, coach Simpson was not informed; when {{he found}} out, he was angry that the ACB had not trusted him enough {{to tell him what}} his players had done. Captain Mark Taylor was also aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> by the time he took the team to the West Indies, as were vice-captain Ian Healy and Waugh's brother Steve.|$|E

5|$|It {{is written}} in the same style as the Tory {{publications}} that attacked Dissenters, and was assumed by some people to be a genuine vindication of their view. The pamphlet raised embarrassing questions about the handling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> by the Tory ministry, and led to Defoe's arrest for seditious libel. His imprisonment, during which he fell into bankruptcy, {{was to have a}} lasting influence on his subsequent writings. In the years after his release, Defoe published several pamphlets that attempted to explain its purpose and his own views.|$|E
5|$|Melish likely {{held back}} much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> for later resale, and with few pieces available, {{prices for the}} set spiked, rising to over five times the issue price. The value dropped {{somewhat}} when the boom in commemorative coins burst in late 1936, but quickly recovered and the coins are valuable today. Melish has been assailed by numismatic writers for greed.|$|E
5|$|Osborn {{returns in}} Peter Parker: Spider-Man #75 and is blown {{up at the}} end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue.</b> It is shown in Spectacular Spider-Man #250 that he has recovered, and he returns to his {{civilian}} life. Without the Green Goblin identity, Osborn would then go on to attack Spider-Man indirectly, through minions and via smear campaigns designed to portray him as a monster. However, Norman would still wear his Green Goblin costume in battle.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after the}} signing, the Act {{was taken to}} Germany and handed to parties in the Reichstag. On February 18, the text was reprinted in German newspapers, {{including}} Das Neue Litauen, Vossische Zeitung, Taegliche Rundschau and Kreuzzeitung. In Lithuania a text of the proclamation was prepared for printing in newspapers, particularly in Lietuvos aidas, the Council's newspaper established by Antanas Smetona; but the German authorities prohibited this publication. Although {{the majority of the}} copies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> were confiscated, the newspaper's editor, Petras Klimas, managed to hide about 60 of them.|$|E
5|$|The Convention {{had given}} the Committee {{extraordinary}} authority to provide for state security ever since {{the outbreak of the}} French Revolutionary War in early 1793. Committee members were originally intended to serve for periods of only thirty days before replacements were elected, so they needed to work quickly. Saint-Just took charge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> and led the development of the French Constitution of 1793. Before the end of his first term, the new document was completed, submitted to the Convention, and ratified as law on 24 June 1793.|$|E
5|$|The Court of Auditors {{was set up}} in 1975. It {{was created}} as an {{independent}} institution due to the sensitivity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of fraud in the Union (the anti-fraud agency, OLAF, is also built on its independence). It is composed of one member from each state appointed by the Council every six years. Every three years one of them is elected {{as the president of the}} court, who is currently Vítor Manuel da Silva Caldeira.|$|E
