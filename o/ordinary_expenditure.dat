500|$|Lennon {{bought the}} house on 15 July 1964, {{on the advice of}} The Beatles' accountants, Dr Walter Strach and James Isherwood. Cliff Richard and Tom Jones had earlier bought homes on the St George's Hill estate. Though {{reportedly}} not liking Kenwood (describing it as a [...] "stop-over" [...] on the way to something better), Lennon spent £40,000 (were it cash for <b>ordinary</b> <b>expenditure</b> [...] ). on renovations, reducing its 22 rooms to 17, landscaping the grounds and building an outdoor swimming pool. Much of the initial decoration was left to interior designer Kenneth Partridge, whom Lennon employed after being impressed by his design work at a lavish party held by Beatles' manager Brian Epstein to celebrate the Beatles' departure for their first tour of the United States. However, when Partridge had completed his work, Lennon and then-wife Cynthia immediately made a number of further alterations which better reflected their taste. Cynthia's mother was given an allowance to fill the shelves of the house with antiques and antiquarian books, and a heavy sliding wooden door was installed at the gate entrance to keep out fans.|$|E

6000|$|All day {{the dogs}} were kept unsparingly on the alert, and the drove pushed forward at a very unusual and {{seemingly}} unwelcome speed. All day Sim and Candlish, with a more than <b>ordinary</b> <b>expenditure</b> both of snuff and of words, continued to debate the position. It seems that they had recognised two of our neighbours on the road--one Faa, and another {{by the name of}} Gillies. Whether there was an old feud between them still unsettled I could never learn; but Sim and Candlish were prepared for every degree of fraud or violence at their hands. Candlish repeatedly congratulated himself on having left [...] "the watch at home with the mistress"; and Sim perpetually brandished his cudgel, and cursed his ill-fortune that it should be sprung.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the possible effects of broader-based local government, especially extended associations, in Japanese local public finance. In order {{to evaluate the}} expenditure of extended association, our new approach is to apply unique index called financial index classified by similar types. We mainly analyze scale effects in public long-term care insurance expenditure, with our results indicating a U shaped expenditure structure. We also show that expenditures associated with extended associations decrease more rapidly than <b>ordinary</b> municipal <b>expenditures.</b> These findings suggest that expenditure of appropriate population size extended associations larger than single municipality. ...|$|R
6000|$|She was consoled {{for that}} time; but the perplexity continued. She strove {{to reduce the}} <b>ordinary</b> <b>expenditure,</b> but Arthur had a fashion of {{bringing}} home a friend to dinner without notice; and she underwent indescribable miseries, while reflecting on her one chicken, or five mutton chops; and though something was sure to be extemporized by the cook, {{the result was that}} these casual guests were as expensive as a banquet. She ventured to beg Arthur to tell her when he was going to ask any one, but he was vexed, and said he liked to bring home a man by chance; there need be nothing out of the common way, and a dinner for two was a dinner for three. Poor Violet thought, 'Ah! this is not like the time at Winchester. It is my own fault, I am not companion, enough.' ...|$|E
60|$|This {{constitutes}} {{a fleet of}} more than fifty war ships, of which fifteen are ironclad, now in hand on the Atlantic coast. The Navy has been brought to this condition by a judicious and practical application {{of what could be}} spared from the current appropriations of the last few years and from that made to meet the possible emergency of two years ago. It has been done quietly, without proclamation or display, and though it has necessarily straitened the Department in its <b>ordinary</b> <b>expenditure,</b> and, as far as the ironclads are concerned, has added nothing to the cruising force of the Navy, yet the result is not the less satisfactory because it {{is to be found in}} a great increase of real rather than apparent force. The expenses incurred in the maintenance of an effective naval force in all its branches are necessarily large, but such force is essential to our position, relations, and character, and affects seriously the weight of our principles and policy throughout the whole sphere of national responsibilities.|$|E
60|$|It was now his {{business}} to marry an heiress. He {{was well aware}} that it was so, and was quite prepared to face his destiny. But he lacked something {{in the art of}} making love. He was beautiful, had the manners of a gentleman, could talk well, lacked nothing of audacity, and had no feeling of repugnance at declaring a passion which he did not feel. But he knew so little of the passion, that he could hardly make even a young girl believe that he felt it. When he talked of love, he not only thought that he was talking nonsense, but showed that he thought so. From this fault he had already failed with one young lady reputed to have £40,000, who had refused him because, as she naively said, she knew 'he did not really care.' 'How can I show that I care more than by wishing to make you my wife?' he had asked. 'I don't know that you can, but all the same you don't care,' she said. And so that young lady escaped the pitfall. Now there was another young lady, to whom the reader shall be introduced in time, whom Sir Felix was instigated to pursue with unremitting diligence. Her wealth was not defined, as had been the £40,000 of her predecessor, but was known to be very much greater than that. It was, indeed, generally supposed to be fathomless, bottomless, endless. It was said that in regard to money for <b>ordinary</b> <b>expenditure,</b> money for houses, servants, horses, jewels, and the like, one sum was the same as another to the father of this young lady. He had great concerns;--concerns so great that the payment of ten or twenty thousand pounds upon any trifle was the same thing to him,--as to men who are comfortable in their circumstances it matters little whether they pay sixpence or ninepence for their mutton chops. Such a man may be ruined at any time; but there was no doubt that to anyone marrying his daughter during the present season of his outrageous prosperity he could give a very large fortune indeed. Lady Carbury, who had known the rock on which her son had been once wrecked, was very anxious that Sir Felix should at once make a proper use of the intimacy which he had effected in the house of this topping Croesus of the day.|$|E
40|$|In most {{applications}} of complete systems of demand functions to national accounts data it is implicitly {{assumed that the}} demand functions are identified. For post-war Sweden {{this is not an}} altogether good assumption because due to rent control there was an excess demand for housing. In this paper the linear expenditure system is modified to include a supply function for housing. Supply is simply assumed to be a function of excess demand. The model is estimated by the maxi mum likelihood method and the results are compared to those obtained for the <b>ordinary</b> linear <b>expenditure</b> system...|$|R

60|$|That is {{one thing}} which the passage of this Budget will show. Let not that be overlooked. But {{that is not the}} only thing; the Budget will do more than that. It will reveal the {{financial}} strength of Britain. At a time when every European country is borrowing merely for the needs of <b>ordinary</b> annual <b>expenditure,</b> when all these disturbing naval programmes, which are injuring the peace {{of the world and the}} security and progress of civilisation, are being supported by borrowed money; and when the credit of Germany has fallen below that of Italy, this country, which has necessarily to make the biggest expenditure for naval defence of any country, will be found, under a Free Trade system and by our proposals, able not only to pay its way, but to pay off the debts of the past--to pay off the debts of our predecessors--even in the worst of times at the rate of something like £7,000,000 a year.|$|R
6000|$|Leaving native {{questions}} for the present, we must now return to the general affairs of the country. When President Burgers opened the special sitting of the Volksraad, on the 4th September, he appealed, it will be remembered, to that body for pecuniary aid to liquidate the expenses of the war. This appeal was responded to by the passing of a war tax, under which every owner of a farm was to pay 10 pounds, the owner of half a farm 5 pounds, and so on. The tax {{was not a very}} just one, since it fell with equal weight on the rich man, who held twenty farms, and the poor man, who held but one. Its justice or injustice was, however, to a great extent immaterial, since the free and independent burghers, including some {{of the members of the}} Volksraad who had imposed it, promptly refused to pay it, or indeed, whilst they were about it, any other tax. As the Treasury was already empty, and creditors were pressing, this refusal was most ill-timed, and things began to look very black indeed. Meanwhile, in addition to the <b>ordinary</b> <b>expenditure,</b> and the interest payable on debts, money had to be found to pay Von Schlickmann's volunteers. As there was no cash in the country, this was done by issuing Government promissory notes, known as [...] "goodfors," [...] or vulgarly as [...] "good for nothings," [...] and by promising them all booty, and to each man a farm of two thousand acres, lying east and north-east of the Loolu mountains; in other words, in Secocoeni's territory, which did not belong to the Government to give away. The officials were the next to suffer, and for six months before the Annexation these unfortunate individuals lived as best they could, for they certainly got no salary, except in the case of a postmaster, who was told to help himself to his pay in stamps. The Government issued large numbers of bills, but the banks refused to discount them, and in some cases the neighbouring Colonies had to advance money to the Transvaal post-cart contractors, who were carrying the mails, as a matter of charity. The Government even mortgaged the great salt-pan near Pretoria for the paltry sum of 400 pounds, whilst the leading officials of the Government were driven to pledging their own private credit in order to obtain the smallest article necessary to its continuance. In fact, to such a pass did things come that when the country was annexed a single threepenny bit (which had doubtless been overlooked) was found in the Treasury chest, together with acknowledgments of debts to the extent of nearly 300,000 pounds.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the common treasury, supported by the general taxes and charged with the <b>ordinary</b> <b>expenditure,</b> there was a special reserve fund, also in the temple of Saturn, the aerarium sanctum (or sanctius). This fund probably originally consisted of the spoils of war. Afterwards it was maintained chiefly by a 5% tax {{on the value of}} all manumitted slaves. This source of revenue was established by a lex Manlia in 357. This fund was not to be touched except in cases of extreme necessity.|$|E
50|$|The {{financial}} {{condition of the}} county municipalities of the province was deemed excellent in 1915. The ordinary revenue for the province in 1915 amounted to $1,634,079 and the <b>ordinary</b> <b>expenditure</b> to $1,626,634. Findings were that ten counties out of fifteen (not including {{the city and county}} of Saint John) had an assessable valuation of real and personal property of over thirty million dollars, with insignificant liabilities. The city of Saint John was in 1915 the commercial capital of the province, with a population of about 58,000, out of more than 350,000, in other words more than 16% of the total. Its valuation for assessment purposes in 1915 was $36,187,000 and its liabilities were less than $5,000,000. The city of Fredericton, the capital of the province, with a population in 1915 of 8,000, had a valuation of real and personal property for assessment of $5,000,000 with an outstanding indebtedness of $486,000.|$|E
