5|$|Little {{is known}} about the origins of the storm, though modern reanalysis efforts suggest that it was first noted at Barbados on September22. The intensifying {{hurricane}} passed just south of Jamaica on September26 and 27, affecting the island with strong winds and heavy rains. On September28, HMSRacer, a Royal Navy sloop-of-war, encountered the storm in the northwestern Caribbean. She was dismasted and blown <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>beam</b> <b>ends</b> twice before re-righting, and a young boy plus two crewmen aboard the ship died during the hurricane. Since the ship was apparently the first to observe the cyclone at sea, writers and historians have commonly referred to the system as Racer'sstorm or Racer'shurricane.|$|E
25|$|In the {{beginning}} of November she left Madras roads, but encountered a sudden squall that almost put her <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>beam</b> <b>ends.</b> Contrary winds prevented her from immediately reaching Diamond Harbour. She arrived there on 16 November.|$|E
25|$|On 22 May Telegraph {{came into}} Plymouth. A gale {{a few days}} earlier had put Telegraph <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>beam</b> <b>ends</b> for several minutes with water up to the combing of her hatchways. It was only when the fore top-mast and the {{bowsprit}} went that she righted.|$|E

5000|$|Drexler {{departed}} Ulithi 27 March 1945 {{bound for}} Okinawa and dangerous duty on a radar picket station. On 28 May at 07:00, two kamikazes attacked Drexler and [...] The first was downed by the combined fire {{of the two}} destroyers and planes from the combat air patrol. The second tried to crash onto Lowry but missed, hitting Drexler instead and cutting off all power and starting large gasoline fires. Despite the heavy damage, she kept firing, aiding in shooting down two planes which attacked immediately after the crash. At 07:03 she was hit by another aircraft, a twin-engined [...] "Frances" [...] P1Y1 bomber, and the [...] "impact rolled <b>her</b> <b>on</b> to <b>her</b> <b>beam</b> <b>ends,</b> causing <b>her</b> to sink in less than 50 seconds" [...] at [...] Because of {{the speed with which}} she sank, casualties were heavy: 158 dead and 52 wounded. The captain was one of the wounded. Few of the survivors are still alive. They honor their comrades every year at the annual Drexler Survivors reunion.|$|R
50|$|Most of the pre-war C&N motor yachts were requisitioned by the Royal Navy, often {{manned by}} their pre-war crews and {{commanded}} by their peacetime skipper or owner. The toughness of C&N craft was proven in incidents {{like that of}} M.Y. Esmeralda, which while involved in mine clearance got too close. The resulting explosion threw <b>her</b> onto <b>her</b> <b>beam</b> <b>ends,</b> lifting <b>her</b> stern {{high into the air}} - she survived the incident with no structural damage whatsoever.|$|R
25|$|After {{about an}} hour Vincent had to strike. Arrows hold was filling with water and four of her cannons were dismounted. She also had heavy casualties. All of Arrows boats had been destroyed, but boats from Incorruptible took off the survivors, and rescue those men from Arrow that jumped into the water as Arrow turned <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>beam</b> <b>ends</b> and sank.|$|E
25|$|Mediator sailed for Barbados {{towards the}} end of the 1785 {{hurricane}} season, but was becalmed off La Désirade for a night. The following day she was struck by a sudden squall that laid her <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>beam</b> <b>ends.</b> Further damage occurred when A terrible crash took part in the fore part of the ship, accompanied by a tremendous explosion and stench of sulphur, deep groans followed, - sixteen men upon the main deck were knocked down, some were apparently dead and others groaning; relief was instantly afforded, and in about four hours after all were apparently well again. A lightning ball had struck the fore topmast, passed into the pigsty, and through the galley into the waist, where it burst and overthrew seventeen men; eleven pigs in the sty before the mast were killed, belonging to the Captain; the silver buckles in the shoes of the gunner were melted into wire, and himself was knocked out of the roundhouse forward. Despite the dramatic nature of the lightning strike, no one was killed, except for the pigs, which Collingwood gave to the crew as a reward for their work in repairing the foremast. Collingwood took Mediator back to English Harbour to be careened in early 1786, and then returned to England to be paid off in August 1786.|$|E
500|$|The Spray, already {{stripped}} of her sails and rigging, and lying <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>beam</b> <b>ends,</b> was towed to the New York Harbor. There, the harbor police {{took charge of}} the Spray and began retrieving items from the partially submerged cabin, including the captain's bed, which was stained and splattered with blood. A [...] "heavy three-cornered scraper" [...] also recovered was suspected to be the [...] "instrument with which the bloody deed was committed." [...] A pair of unloaded pistols, one with signs of recent discharge, were also recovered. Other items included a small pine box, suspected to be the captain's money box, that had been broken open, but no bodies or money were found.|$|E
50|$|After the war, {{she stayed}} briefly in Grimsby, before being sold in February 1946 to Don Trawling Co (Milford) Ltd in Milford Haven. On 20 April 1946 {{she was in}} the fishing grounds off the west coast of Ireland during an 85 mph gale. The gale shifted 140 ST of coal in her bunker, forcing the ship onto <b>her</b> <b>beam</b> <b>ends</b> - so that the deck was near-vertical. The crew spent five and a half hours moving the coal by hand to restore her to an even keel and were {{eventually}} forced to put into Berehaven, County Cork.|$|R
60|$|That hope soon vanished. One of the mates {{was sent}} {{to the top of the}} foremast, and descended with news that, as far as could be seen, the line of {{breakers}} stretched away, both <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>beam</b> and quarter. As the minutes went by the anxious crew could see, but too clearly, that the ship was drifting down upon the land; and that she must inevitably be wrecked upon it.|$|R

2500|$|Soon after completion, Pawtuxet was {{despatched}} to Boston, Massachusetts, arriving 29 September 1864, {{the same}} day as her sister ship USRC Mahoning, against whom it was reported she would be tested in trials. Almost a year later, on 18 September 1865, Pawtuxet ran into the schooner Neptune's Bride, which was at anchor below Boston. The collision turned the schooner <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>beam</b> <b>ends,</b> but with a cargo of cotton, the vessel did not sink and was prepared for towing to the city.|$|E
2500|$|By mid-May, the Allied fleet had {{developed}} a rotation of two battleships on station off Gallipoli every night to support the troops dug in on the peninsula. On the night of 12–13 May, Goliath was on station with the battleship [...] The two ships were moored in Morto Bay, with Goliath ahead of Cornwallis; five destroyers patrolled the area against Ottoman torpedo boats. The Ottoman destroyer [...] sortied late on 12 May under cover of a moonless night. By steaming very slowly, the Ottomans were able to slip past the destroyer patrols at about 01:00 on 13 May. Fifteen minutes later, lookouts aboard Goliath spotted Muâvenet-i Millîye and issued a challenge; the Ottomans replied to the challenge but very quickly increased speed and launched three torpedoes at Goliath. The British opened fire, but only managed to shoot three rounds before the first torpedo struck the ship. Two torpedoes hit almost simultaneously, the first abreast her fore turret and the second abeam the fore funnel, causing a large explosion. began to capsize almost immediately, and was lying <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>beam</b> <b>ends</b> when a third torpedo struck near her after turret. Muâvenet-i Millîye sped off and escaped unscathed in the darkness as the other British warships gathered to rescue survivors from Goliath. Some 570 men, out of a crew of 750 {{were killed in the}} sinking, including the ship's commander, Captain Thomas Shelford.|$|E
2500|$|In November Ceylon was in convoy {{with some}} eight other Indiamen {{when she got}} caught in a hurricane. On this voyage, she had lost 46 men of the 110 she had set out with: 41 pressed by various ships of the Royal Navy, six dead of disease, six deserted, two drowned in Diamond Harbour, and one who had joined the Army. Hudson, who by this time knew he was dying of [...] "Bengal Fever", had made up his numbers with lascars, and some Danes, however the {{replacements}} were of a lower quality than the men lost, especially those the Navy had pressed. On 21 November Ceylon was <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>beam</b> <b>ends,</b> almost capsizing; fortunately the weather temporarily moderated and she righted herself. As the weather worsened again, the foretopmast broke, but could not be cleared. Ceylon started to take on water and the pumps could not keep up. When Hudson went below, {{he found that the}} lascars and Danes were paralyzed by fear or fatalism and would not man the pumps. The men passengers, Army officers and invalided soldiers, manned the pumps while the functioning crew members threw guns overboard. Towards 6p.m. on 23 November the weather moderated and Ceylons pumps were able to start reducing the water in the ship. At some point that evening one of the passengers, the wife of an army officer, gave birth. As Ceylon limped towards Cape Town a fever passed through the vessel killing a baby born on 11 November, five soldiers, and three crewmen.|$|E

50|$|The {{following}} October, at the World Championships in London, England, Rebecca qualified {{in first}} place into the all-around final.
