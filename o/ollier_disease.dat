25|$|Specific {{mutations}} in the isocitrate dehydrogenase gene IDH1 {{have been found}} in several brain tumors including astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma and glioblastoma multiforme, with mutations found in nearly all cases of secondary glioblastomas, which develop from lower-grade gliomas, but rarely in primary high-grade glioblastoma multiforme. Patients whose tumor had an IDH1 mutation had longer survival. Furthermore, mutations of IDH2 and IDH1 were found in up to 20% of cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (AML). These mutations are known to produce (D)-2-hydroxyglutarate from alpha-ketoglutarate. (D)-2-hydroxyglutarate accumulates to very high concentrations which inhibits the function of enzymes that are dependent on alpha-ketoglutarate. This leads to a hypermethylated state of DNA and histones, which results in different gene expression that can activate oncogenes and inactivate tumor-suppressor genes. Ultimately, this may lead to the types of cancer described above. Somatic mosaic mutations of this gene have also been found associated to <b>Ollier</b> <b>disease</b> and Maffucci syndrome.|$|E

50|$|In <b>Ollier</b> <b>disease</b> {{isolated}} enchondromas {{are present}} without {{the presence of}} hemangiomas.|$|E
50|$|Patients {{are normal}} at birth and the {{syndrome}} manifests during childhood and puberty. The enchondromas affect the extremities and their distribution is asymmetrical. The most common sites of enchondromas are the metacarpal bones and phalanges of the hands. The feet are less commonly afflicted.Disfigurations of the extremities are a result. Pathological fractures can arise in affected metaphyses and diaphyses {{of the long}} bones and are common (26%).The risk for sarcomatous degeneration of enchondromas, hemangiomas, or lymphangiomas is 15-30% {{in the setting of}} Maffucci syndrome. Maffucci syndrome is associated with a higher risk of CNS, pancreatic, and ovarian malignancies. Multiple enchondromas may present in 3 disorders: <b>Ollier</b> <b>disease,</b> Maffucci syndrome, and metachondromatosis. It is important to make the distinction between these diseases, particularly <b>Ollier</b> <b>disease</b> and Maffucci syndrome. <b>Ollier</b> <b>disease</b> is more common than Maffucci syndrome, and presents with multiple enchondromas often in a unilateral distribution. However, hemangiomas and lymphangiomas are not seen in <b>Ollier</b> <b>disease.</b> Metachondromatosis demonstrates autosomal-dominant transmission and presents with both multiple osteochondromas and enchondromas.|$|E

50|$|Isocitrate dehydrogenases are {{enzymes that}} {{catalyze}} the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to 2-oxoglutarate.

Five isocitrate dehydrogenases have been reported: three NAD(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases, which localize to the mitochondrial matrix, and two NADP(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases, {{one of which is}} mitochondrial and the other predominantly cytosolic. Each NADP(+)-dependent isozyme is a homodimer. The protein encoded by the IDH2 gene is the NADP(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase found in the mitochondria.

40|$|Abstract Enchondromas {{are common}} intraosseous, usually benign {{cartilaginous}} tumors, that develop {{in close proximity}} to growth plate cartilage. When multiple enchondromas are present, the condition is called enchondromatosis also known as <b>Ollier</b> <b>disease</b> (WHO terminology). The estimated prevalence of <b>Ollier</b> <b>disease</b> is 1 / 100, 000. Clinical manifestations often appear {{in the first decade of}} life. <b>Ollier</b> <b>disease</b> is characterized by an asymmetric distribution of cartilage lesions and these can be extremely variable (in terms of size, number, location, evolution of enchondromas, age of onset and of diagnosis, requirement for surgery). Clinical problems caused by enchondromas include skeletal deformities, limb-length discrepancy, and the potential risk for malignant change to chondrosarcoma. The condition in which multiple enchondromatosis is associated with soft tissue hemangiomas is known as Maffucci syndrome. Until now both <b>Ollier</b> <b>disease</b> and Maffucci syndrome have only occurred in isolated patients and not familial. It remains uncertain whether the disorder is caused by a single gene defect or by combinations of (germ-line and/or somatic) mutations. The diagnosis is based on clinical and conventional radiological evaluations. Histological analysis has a limited role and is mainly used if malignancy is suspected. There is no medical treatment for enchondromatosis. Surgery is indicated in case of complications (pathological fractures, growth defect, malignant transformation). The prognosis for <b>Ollier</b> <b>disease</b> is difficult to assess. As is generally the case, forms with an early onset appear more severe. Enchondromas in <b>Ollier</b> <b>disease</b> present a risk of malignant transformation of enchondromas into chondrosarcomas. </p...|$|E

40|$|<b>Ollier</b> <b>disease</b> and Maffucci {{syndrome}} are non-hereditary skeletal disorders {{characterized by}} multiple enchondromas (<b>Ollier</b> <b>disease)</b> combined with spindle cell hemangiomas (Maffucci syndrome). We report somatic heterozygous mutations in IDH 1 (c. 394 C>T encoding an R 132 C substitution and c. 395 G>A encoding an R 132 H substitution) or IDH 2 (c. 516 G>C encoding R 172 S) in 87 % of enchondromas (benign cartilage tumors) and in 70 % of spindle cell hemangiomas (benign vascular lesions). In total, 35 of 43 (81 %) subjects with <b>Ollier</b> <b>disease</b> and 10 of 13 (77 %) with Maffucci syndrome carried IDH 1 (98 %) or IDH 2 (2 %) mutations in their tumors.

30|$|Dyschondroplasia, or <b>Ollier</b> <b>disease,</b> is a rare, non-hereditary {{skeletal}} disorder.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the studies {{described}} in this thesis {{is to find the}} genetic deficit in <b>Ollier</b> <b>disease</b> and Maffucci syndrome. They are very rare, non-inherited syndromes with a unilateral predominance of the multiple enchondromas. Enchondroma is a benign cartilage forming tumor which can undergo malignant transformation towards chondrosarcoma. We hypothesized the presence of somatic mosaicism with an early post zygotic mutation. We used genome-wide and hypothesis driven approach to identify genes causing <b>Ollier</b> <b>disease</b> and Maffucci syndrome. Ultimately, we identified mutations in two genes (IDH 1 and IDH 2) that were present in the majority of the tumors from patients with <b>Ollier</b> <b>disease</b> and Maffucci syndrome. A subgroup of patients did not show mutations in IDH 1, IDH 2 or PTH 1 R and therefore, other genes (except ACP 5, PTPN 11, PTHLH, GNAS, NDST 1) might be involved. Moreover, one can not exclude the possibility of functional links or pathways shared between IDH 1 or IDH 2 with EXT 1, EXT 2, PTH 1 R, PTPN 11, PTHLH, TET 2 and ACP 5. We have shown that IDH 1 mutations are associated with hypermethylation and consequently downregulation of several genes. DLX 5 was the most differentially methylated gene between enchondromas with, and without IDH 1 mutations which was found in our study. Promotor: P. C. W. Hogendoorn, Co-promotor: J. V. M. G.

40|$|Objective: Ovarian {{juvenile}} {{granulosa cell tumor}} has {{an interesting}} association with multiple enchondromatosis (<b>Ollier</b> <b>disease</b> and Maffucci syndrome) and {{should be considered a}} leading diagnosis when an ovarian mass is found in young patients with these conditions.

40|$|BACKGROUND. Enchondromas are benign lesions {{that can}} occur as solitary tumors or {{multiple}} tumors (<b>Ollier</b> <b>disease)</b> and may be precursors of central chondrosarcomas. Recurrent chondrosarcomas can be of a higher grade com-pared with primary tumors, suggesting possible progression. METHODS. Genome-wide array-comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) was used to investigate copy number changes in enchondromas and central chondro-sarcomas to elucidate both primary genetic events and the events related to tumor progression. Analyses of variance, Student t tests, and hierarchical cluster-ing {{were used for the}} current analyses. Array-CGH data were compared with complementary DNA (cDNA) and quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction expression array data. RESULTS. Genomic imbalances were rare in enchondromas and in grade I chon-drosarcomas, whereas they were frequent in high-grade tumors.

40|$|To review <b>Ollier</b> <b>disease,</b> an {{uncommon}} disease, {{in order to}} understand the clinical symptoms, diagnosis, correct treatment, and risk factors in order to prevent malignant transformation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventeen cases of <b>Ollier</b> <b>disease</b> were treated between 1976 and 2006. The variables studied included: age at diagnosis and onset of malignant transformation, location of the lesion, family association with other tumours, radiological findings, treatment for the different lesions, metastatic lesions and survival. We excluded patients with Chondrosarcoma without previous diagnosis of <b>Ollier</b> <b>disease.</b> All malignant transformations were assessed by histopathology studies and radiological images. RESULTS: We include 16 cases of Ollier's and 1 of Maffucci's syndrome. The median age at diagnosis for patients having malignant transformation was 45 years, whereas the average age at diagnosis for patient without progression to malignancy was 11 years. Pathological fractures, dysmetria and deformities led to the diagnosis in young people. Benign lesions were treated with minor surgery. There were five malignancy transformations in four patients (23. 5 %), with the distal femur being the most frequent location for transformation to grade I chondrosarcoma. Surgery was the treatment in all of them. We found no family association with other tumours. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple enchondromatosis is a benign disease with a high risk of malignant transformation above 40 years old. Bone scintigraphy is the best tool for detecting multiple lesions and malignant transformation. Radical surgery is the only way to improve survival, and this is the reason why early diagnosis is essential...|$|E
40|$|PTHR 1 -signaling pathway is {{critical}} for the regulation of endochondral ossification. Thus, abnormalities in genes belonging to this pathway could potentially participate in the pathogenesis of Ollier disease/ Maffucci syndrome, two developmental disorders defined {{by the presence of}} multiple enchondromas. In agreement, a functionally deleterious mutation in PTHR 1 (p. R 150 C) was identified in enchondromas from two of six unrelated patients with enchondromatosis. However, neither the p. R 150 C mutation (26 tumors) nor any other mutation in the PTHR 1 gene (11 patients) could be identified in another study. To further define the role of PTHR 1 -signaling pathway in <b>Ollier</b> <b>disease</b> and Maffucci syndrome, we analyzed the coding sequences of four genes (PTHR 1, IHH, PTHrP and GNAS 1) in leucocyte and/or tumor DNA from 61 and 23 patients affected with <b>Ollier</b> <b>disease</b> or Maffucci syndrome, respectively. We identified three pre-viously undescribed missense mutations in PTHR 1 in patients with <b>Ollier</b> <b>disease</b> at the heterozygous state. Two mutations (p. G 121 E, p. A 122 T) were present only in enchondromas, and one (p. R 255 H) in both enchondroma and leukocyte DNA. Assessment of receptor function demonstrated that these three mutations impair PTHR 1 function by reducing either the affinity of the receptor for PTH or the receptor expression at the cell surface. These mutations were not found in DNA from 222 controls. Including our data, PTHR 1 function-ally deleterious mutations have now been identified in five out 31 enchondromas from Ollier patients.

The risk of malignant transformation towards central chondrosarcoma (CS) is increased up to 35 %. The aetiology of <b>Ollier</b> <b>disease</b> is unknown. Methods We undertook genome-wide copy number and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis using Affymetrix SNP 6. 0 array on 37 tumours of 28 Ollier patients in combination with expression array using Illumina BeadArray v 3. 0 for 7 ECs of 6 patients. Results Non-recurrent EC specific copy number alterations were found at FAM 86 D, PRKG 1 and ANKS 1 B. LOH with copy number loss of chromosome 6 was found in two ECs from two unrelated Ollier patients. One of these patients also had LOH at chromosome 3. However, no common genomic alterations were found for all ECs. Using an integration approach of SNP and expression array we identified loss as well as down regulation of POU 5 F 1 and gain as well as up regulation of NIPBL. None of these candidate regions were affected in more than two Ollier patients suggesting these changes to be random secondary events in EC development. An increased number of genetic alterations and LOH were found in Ollier CS which mainly involves chromosomes 9 p, 6 q, 5 q and 3 p. Conclusions We present the first genome-wide analysis of the largest international series of Ollier ECs and CS reported so far and demonstrate that copy number alterations and LOH are rare and non-recurrent in Ollier ECs while secondary CS are genetically unstable.
