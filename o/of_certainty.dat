5|$|Comparisons of KOI 072.02 to the 1235 other Kepler Objects of Interest in Kepler's {{field of}} vision allowed astronomers to use models {{that led to the}} {{confirmation}} of KOI 072.02 as a planet with a high degree <b>of</b> <b>certainty.</b> KOI 072.02 was then renamed Kepler-10c. The planet's confirmation was announced at the Boston meeting of the American Astronomical Society on May 23, 2011.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to lack of}} {{surviving}} documentation, {{it is difficult to}} attribute unsigned works from the period with any degree <b>of</b> <b>certainty.</b> The origin of the Crucifix has often been contested, but is generally thought to be by Cimabue based on stylistic traits and mentions by both Vasari and Nicolò Albertini. It is relatively primitive compared to his 1290s works and is thus believed to date from his early period. According to Vasari, the crucifix's success led to the commissions at Pisa, Tuscany that established his reputation.|$|E
5000|$|CVs are not {{an ideal}} index <b>of</b> the <b>certainty</b> <b>of</b> a {{measurement}} {{when the number of}} replicates varies across samples because CV is invariant to the number <b>of</b> replicates while <b>certainty</b> <b>of</b> the mean improves with increasing replicates. In this case standard error in percent is suggested to be superior.|$|R
60|$|But {{that we may}} not be misled in {{this case}} by that which is the danger everywhere, I mean by the doubtfulness of terms, it is fit to observe that {{certainty}} is twofold: <b>CERTAINTY</b> <b>OF</b> TRUTH and <b>CERTAINTY</b> <b>OF</b> KNOWLEDGE. <b>Certainty</b> <b>of</b> truth is, when words are so put together in propositions as exactly to express the agreement or disagreement of the ideas they stand for, as really it is. <b>Certainty</b> <b>of</b> knowledge is to perceive the agreement or disagreement of ideas, as expressed in any proposition. This we usually call knowing, or being certain of the truth of any proposition.|$|R

5|$|Hale–Bopp was {{discovered}} on July 23, 1995 separately by Alan Hale and Thomas Bopp prior to it becoming naked-eye visible on Earth. Although predicting the maximum apparent brightness of new comets with any degree <b>of</b> <b>certainty</b> is difficult, Hale–Bopp met or exceeded most predictions when it passed perihelion on April 1, 1997. It was {{visible to the}} naked eye for a record 18months, twice as long as the previous record holder, the Great Comet of 1811. Accordingly, Hale–Bopp was dubbed the Great Comet of 1997.|$|E
5|$|Day 3 outlooks {{refer to}} the day after tomorrow, and include the same {{products}} (categorical outline, text description, and probability graph) as the Day 2 outlook. As of June 2012, the SPC forecasts general thunderstorm risk areas. Higher probability forecasts are less and less likely as the forecast period increases due to lessening forecast ability farther in advance. Day 3 moderate risks are quite rare; these have been issued only fourteen times since the product became operational (most recently for May 9, 2015). Day 3 high risks are never issued and the operational standards do not allow for such. This is most likely because it would require both a very high degree <b>of</b> <b>certainty</b> (60%) for an event which was still at least 48 hours away and a reasonable level of confidence that said severe thunderstorm outbreak would include significant severe weather (EF2+ tornadoes, hurricane-force winds, and/or egg-sized hail).|$|E
5|$|With {{a greater}} degree <b>of</b> <b>certainty</b> established, the Kepler team {{compared}} the models formed using Blender to the photometric observations collected by the Kepler satellite. The Blender technique allowed the Kepler team {{to rule out the}} majority of the alternatives including, notably, that of triple star systems. Blender then allowed the Kepler team to determine that although all models representing hierarchical triple stars (a binary system between a single star and a double star) can resemble the light curve of Kepler-10, the aforementioned follow-up observations would have detected them all. The only possible blends remaining after ruling out hierarchical triple stars was that of determining if the curve is caused by interference from a background star, or if it is indeed caused by the orbit of a transiting planet.|$|E

5|$|In {{the fourth}} stratum, fragmentary remains of round or {{elliptical}} buildings were discovered. The potsherds {{found in this}} layer date it to Early Bronze Age. In the third stratum large elliptical buildings, {{very similar to the}} structures uncovered in the third stratum in an excavation near Kiryat Ata, were exposed. An abundance of broken storage vessels, in their original place, were found there. This pottery indicates that the building should be ascribed to an early phase of Early Bronze Age. In the second stratum, sections of minor construction and a few potsherds from diverse periods were found. The potsherds could not be attributed with any degree <b>of</b> <b>certainty</b> to the architectural remains. Early Bronze Age II, Intermediate Bronze Age, Middle Bronze Age and the Roman period stand out among the periods, to which these sherds are ascribed. A tomb attributed to the Middle Bronze Age was found; it contained scant remains of human bones and a bronze spearhead with a socket. The corner of a building that probably dated to the Early Roman period was discovered close to the surface {{in the eastern part of}} the excavation area.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} definite {{reference to}} cricket is dated Monday, 17 January 1597 (i.e., a Julian date which is 1598 by modern reckoning under the Gregorian calendar). It is a deposition in {{the records of}} a legal case at Guildford, Surrey, re {{the use of a}} parcel of land c.1550 and John Derrick, a coroner, testified that he had at that time played cricket on the land when he was a boy. Derrick's testimony makes clear that the sport was being played c.1550, but its true origin is a mystery. All that can be said with a fair degree <b>of</b> <b>certainty</b> is that its beginning was earlier than 1550, somewhere in south-east England within the counties of Kent, Sussex and Surrey. Unlike other games with batsmen, bowlers and fielders, such as stoolball and rounders, cricket can only be played on relatively short grass, especially as the ball was delivered along the ground until the 1760s. Therefore, forest clearings and land where sheep had grazed would have been suitable places to play.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to discuss the issue <b>of</b> legal <b>{{certainty}}.</b> It reviews the legal certainty in the ambit of Brazilian Law, a civil law jurisdiction. The concept <b>of</b> legal <b>certainty</b> is delimited and its importance for economy and commercial relations is discussed. The most important aspect <b>of</b> legal <b>certainty</b> is “ideology”. The judicial legitimacy of the same-sex family union in Brazil is a highly notable case in which we can see that a norm is interpreted differently when the ideology changes. As “ideology matters”, if a country wants to provide more legal certainty, it has to develop actions aiming at changing the ideology. The conclusion suggests the thesis that ideology would be the most important aspect in the matter <b>of</b> legal <b>certainty</b> also in common law jurisdictions...|$|R
