60|$|It {{follows from}} this {{that even a}} general rise of wages, when it {{involves}} a real increase {{in the cost of}} labor, does in some degree influence values. It does not affect them in the manner vulgarly supposed, by raising them universally; but an increase in the cost of labor lowers profits, and therefore lowers in natural values the things into which profits enter in a greater proportion than the average, and raises those into which they enter in a less proportion than the average. All commodities in the production <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>machinery</b> bears a large part, especially if the machinery is very durable, are lowered in their relative value when profits fall; or, what is equivalent, other things are raised in value relatively to them. This truth is sometimes expressed in a phraseology more plausible than sound, by saying that a rise of wages raises the value of things made by labor in comparison with those made by machinery. But things made by machinery, just as much as any other things, are made by labor—namely, the labor which made the machinery itself—the only difference being that profits enter somewhat more largely into the production of things for which machinery is used, though the principal item of the outlay is still labor.|$|E
60|$|Now, let us {{suppose that}} when the machine is first rolled into the {{presence}} of the spectators, a man is already within it. His body is situated behind the dense machinery in cupboard No. T. (the rear portion <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>machinery</b> is so contrived as to slip en masse, from the main compartment to the cupboard No. I, as occasion may require,) and his legs lie at full length in the main compartment. When Maelzel opens the door No. I, the man within is not in any danger of discovery, for the keenest eye cannot penetrate more than about two inches into the darkness within. But the case is otherwise when {{the back door of the}} cupboard No. I, is opened. A bright light then pervades the cupboard, and the body of the man would be discovered if it were there. But it is not. The putting the key in the lock of the back door was a signal on hearing which the person concealed brought his body forward to an angle as acute as possible--throwing it altogether, or nearly so, into the main compartment. This, however, is a painful position, and cannot be long maintained. Accordingly we find that Maelzel closes the back door. This being done, there is no reason why the body of the man may not resume its former situation--for the cupboard is again so dark as to defy scrutiny. The drawer is now opened, and the legs of the person within drop down behind it in the space it formerly occupied. {*4} There is, consequently, now no longer any part of the man in the main compartment--his body being behind the machinery in cupboard No. 1, and his legs in the space occupied by the drawer. The exhibiter, therefore, finds himself at liberty to display the main compartment. This he does--opening both its back and front doors--and no person Is discovered. The spectators are now satisfied that the whole of the box is exposed to view--and exposed too, all portions of it at one and the same time. But of course this is not the case. They neither see the space behind the drawer, nor the interior of cupboard No. 1--the front door of which latter the exhibiter virtually shuts in shutting its back door. Maelzel, having now rolled the machine around, lifted up the drapery of the Turk, opened the doors in his back and thigh, and shown his trunk to be full of machinery, brings the whole back into its original position, and closes the doors. The man within is now at liberty to move about. He gets up into the body of the Turk just so high as to bring his eyes above the level of the chess-board. It is very probable that he seats himself upon the little square block or protuberance which is seen in a corner of the main compartment when the doors are open. In this position he sees the chess-board through the bosom of the Turk which is of gauze. Bringing his right arm across his breast he actuates the little machinery necessary to guide the left arm and the fingers of the figure. This machinery is situated just beneath the left shoulder of the Turk, and is consequently easily reached by the right hand of the man concealed, if we suppose his right arm brought across the breast. The motions of the head and eyes, and of the right arm of the figure, as well as the sound echec are produced by other mechanism in the interior, and actuated at will by the man within. The whole of this mechanism--that is to say all the mechanism essential to the machine--is most probably contained within the little cupboard (of about six inches in breadth) partitioned off at the right (the spectators' right) of the main compartment.|$|E

The total value of service and merchandise exports in 2013 amounted to 54% of GDP, and imports in 2013 amounted to 49% of GDP. Notable among the service exports are container shipping. There is no net foreign debt as other countries owe more money to Denmark than Denmark owes to them, but because of large deficits due to increased unemployment levels the central government has increased its debt level {{since the end of}} September 2008, when it stood at 21 percent (gross debt) of GDP, according to the central bank - in accordance with the Eurostat EMU- gross debt numbers, which only take liabilities into account. (See below (Budgets)). Taking assets into account as well net debt of the central government was 11 percent. The public sector as a whole had net assets of 108 billion kroner in 2008. Within the European Union, Denmark advocates a liberal trade policy. It is a society based on consensus (dialogue and compromise) with the Danish Confederation of Trade Unions and the Confederation of Danish Employers in 1899 in Septemberforliget (The September Settlement) recognising each other's right to organise, thus, negotiate. The employer's right to hire and fire their employees whenever they find it necessary is recognised. There is no legally-stipulated minimum wage (minimumsløn) set by the government; the minimum of wages (mindsteløn) is determined by negotiations between the organisations of employers and employees.|$|E
40|$|Conference theme: History of Science and Technology in China: The {{perspective}} of Interacting CivilizationsPlenary Lecture 2 Appointed in May 1912 {{to the first}} chair professorship (namely Taikoo Professor of Civil Engineering) at the University of Hong Kong, C. A. Middleton Smith (1879 - 1951), who got the degree of M. Sc. from the University of Birmingham and was also a chartered mechanical engineer, arrived in Hong Kong the following September. Civil engineering and mechanical engineering were taught amongst the earliest curriculum of the University of Hong Kong. Prior to his arrival in Hong Kong, C. A. Middleton Smith taught as {{an assistant professor in}} engineering and conducted his research at King’s College of London University on the behavior of metals subjected to combined stresses and his papers on this subject form an important contribution to this branch of engineering knowledge during the years 1904 - 1912. In Hong Kong he made a prolonged study of the problems affecting air-conditioning in the tropics. In various capacities – as Dean of the Faculty, Consulting Engineer to the University of Hong Kong and member of innumerable committees he worked hard in organizing courses of instruction, drawing up syllabuses and framing rules and regulations, in planning and supervising the building of hostels, staff-houses, new laboratories. Special mention should be made of his mission to England during the summer of 1913, as the result <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>machinery</b> and apparatus worth many thousands of pounds were presented to the University of Hong Kong; and of his success in persuading Sir Robert Ho Tung (1862 - 1956) to build and equip the excellent engineering workshop bearing Sir Robert’s name. Among other community services, he founded the Hong Kong University Engineering Society and was its first president. Middleton Smith served as Past-President of the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders of Hong Kong; Honorary Member of the Junior Institution of Engineers; Honorary Associate of the Engineering Society of China. Some of his earliest students include Fu Bingchan傅秉常 (Foo Ping Sheung, First Class Honour, 1916; 1896 - 1965), Liu Xianzhou劉仙洲 (Liu Chen Hua劉振華, First Class Honour, 1918; Professor of Mechanical Engineering, Tsing Hua University, 1934; 1890 - 1975) and Shi Zhiren石志仁 (Shih Chih Jen, First Class Honour, 1922; Assistant Works Manager, Tang Shan Works, Tang Shan, Peking Mukden Ry., Hopei Province; 1897 - 1972) who started to enroll in the Engineering programme within the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Hong Kong in 1912, 1914 and 1918 respectively.
