40|$|Background {{and purpose}} The effect of <b>oral</b> <b>snuff</b> on bone healing is {{virtually}} unknown. In vitro data {{have indicated that}} delay in bone healing in smokers {{may be the result}} of components of smoke other than nicotine. We compared the time for bone healing after high tibial osteotomy in snuffers, smokers, and in control subjects who did not use snuff or cigarettes. Patients and methods 175 male patients comprising 41 smokers, 21 <b>oral</b> <b>snuff</b> users, and 113 non-smokers/ non-snuffers, all of whom were operated on for knee deformity by tibial osteotomy using the hemicallotasis technique (HCO) between 2000 and 2005, were included in a consecutive manner. Preoperative tobacco use, postoperative complications, and treatment time in external fixation were documented. Results There was no delayed healing in the <b>oral</b> <b>snuff</b> users. The mean time in external fixation for all patients was 94 days (SD 20). <b>Oral</b> <b>snuff</b> users had the shortest time in external fixation (87 days (SD 11)) compared to smokers (100 days (SD 25)) (p = 0. 03) and non-smokers/non-snuffers (93 days (SD 14)). The risk ratio for smokers developing complications was 6. 1 (95 % CI: 1. 2 - 36. 4) compared with <b>oral</b> <b>snuff</b> users.

40|$|AbstractBackground: Tobacco smokers {{have lower}} serum levels of {{immunoglobulin}} (Ig) G, mainly due to {{lower levels of}} IgG 2, than non-smokers. The component(s) in tobacco smoke responsible for this effect is unknown, but animal studies have implicated nicotine as {{a major contributor to}} the immunologic effects of smoking. Does nicotine exposure due to use of smokeless tobacco (<b>oral</b> moist <b>snuff)</b> or nicotine replacement therapy influence serum Ig levels in humans?Methods: Serum content of Ig classes and IgG subclasses was analysed in 77 non-smoking nicotine consumers, including 48 users of <b>oral</b> moist <b>snuff</b> (smokeless tobacco users) and 29 ex-smokers on nicotine replacement therapy, and compared with 44 healthy controls. Former smokers in any group had quit smoking at least 6 months prior to study entry. Ig class and IgG subclass levels were determined by radial immunodiffusion. Systemic nicotine exposure was excluded and confirmed by measuring urine content of cotinine using a quantitative radioimmunoassay. Results: Ig class and IgG subclass levels did not differ significantly between the groups, with the sole exception of IgG 4, which was significantly lower in nicotine consumers than in healthy subjects (0. 4 ± 0. 3 vs. 0. 6 ± 0. 4 g/l, mean±sd, 95 % confidence interval {− 0. 3;− 0. 05 }). There was no correlation between any Ig variable and cotinine concentration.

The contaminants in question had thus been undetected by the in-line detection devices (so-called 'sniffers') {{that are supposed to}} reject misused bottles. GC-MS analysis was carried out on the headspace of 31 returned products and their corresponding reference products, and chromatograms were compared to find the possible off-odour compounds. Substances believed to be responsible for the organoleptic change were 2 -methoxynaphthalene (10 bottles), dimethyl disulfide (4), anethole (3), petroleum products (4), ethanol with isoamyl alcohol (1) and a series of ethers (1). The mouldy/musty odour (5 bottles) was caused by trichloroanisole in one instance. In some cases, the origins of the off-odours are believed to be previous consumer misuse of food products (liquorice-flavoured alcohol, home-made alcohol containing fusel oil) or non-food products (cleaning products, petroleum products, <b>oral</b> moist <b>snuff</b> and others).

40|$|Objective. To {{follow the}} {{development}} of a class of pupils' tobacco habits for seven years, and to study differences in tobacco use between girls and boys. Setting. Kronoberg County in southern Sweden. Subjects. All the approximately 2000 pupils were followed from approximately age 12 to approximately age 18. Design. Yearly cross-sectional surveys from 1994 to 2000. Each year, the pupils filled in an established tobacco questionnaire. They did it anonymously in the classroom. Main outcome measures. Percentage of smokers, number of cigarettes smoked per day, and percentage of pupils using "snus", the Swedish variety of <b>oral</b> moist <b>snuff.</b> Results. From grade 6 of compulsory school to grade 12 of upper secondary school, the proportion of daily smokers rose, from 0. 2 % to 22 % for girls and from 0. 5 % to 14 % for boys. Among both genders, the increase occurred mainly between grades 7 and 10, and from grade 10 onwards the daily smokers were the largest group of smokers. Starting from grade 9, boys had higher total tobacco consumption than girls, {{as a result of their}} increased use of "snus", and at the end of the study 39 % of the boys used tobacco compared with 34 % of the girls. Conclusion. Studying young people's tobacco habits over time gives an understanding of when preventive measures should be implemented.

40|$|ABSTRACT-The <b>oral</b> use of <b>snuff</b> {{has been}} {{associated}} with an increased risk for cancer of the oral cavity and pharynx. The five most popular U. S. snuff brands were analyzed for alkaloids, vola-tile and tobacco-specific N-nitrosamines (TSNA), benzo[a]pyrene (CAS: 50 - 32 - 8), and polonium- 210. The carcinogenic TSNA in the five snuff brands ranged from 9, 600 to 289, 000 ppb. These concen-trations exceed the nitrosamine concentrations of other consumer products by at least 2 orders of magnitude. Polonium amounted to 0. 16 - 1. 22 pCi/g dry snuff. Trace amounts of benzo[a) pyrene (0. 1 - 63 ppb) were indicative of contamination of the tobacco with thermal degradation products, probably due to fire curing or flue curing. The findings from this study, the biologic activity of snuff in animal models, and the epidemiologic studies on <b>snuff</b> use and <b>oral</b> cancer strongly suggest the need for reduction of carcinogens and especially of nitrosamines and polonium- 210 in snuff. -JNC...|$|R
40|$|<b>Oral</b> tobacco (<b>snuff)</b> {{is taking}} a large market share in Scandinavia, {{especially}} with young users. However, long-term health effects are unknown. Small studies show association between snuff and reduced endothelial function, representing {{an early stage of}} vascular injury that often precedes manifest cardiovascular disease by several years. We therefore determined the associations between snuff and endothelial function in a large sample of healthy Norwegian men. In the Fitness substudy of the Nord-Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT 3), endothelial function was measured by flow-mediated dilation (FMD). Aerobic fitness was measured by peak oxygen uptake (VO 2 peak). A cross-sectional design including 1 592 self-reported healthy men compared these observations with records of present tobacco use, standard cardiovascular risk factors, and socioeconomic status, using general linear models. FMD was lower in snuff users (FMD: 4. 12 %, 3. 63, 4. 61) compared to non-users (FMD: 4. 52 %, 4. 27, 4. 78) after adjustment for age (difference: - 0. 57 %, - 1. 12, - 0. 01). After further adjustment for potential confounders, FMD still tended to be lower in snuff users than in non-users (difference: - 0. 53 %, - 1. 09, 0. 02). This difference was even more pronounced in the inactive snuff users (- 0. 83 %, - 1. 59, - 0. 06) and in the low fit snuff users (- 0. 74 %, CI - 0. 55, 0. 079).

40|$|The use of Swedish <b>oral</b> moist <b>snuff</b> is a {{widespread}} habit in Sweden. In 1999, 25 % of the adult male population and 3. 1 % of the female population were users of snuff. The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate how variations in pH and nicotine concentrations of <b>snuff</b> affect the <b>oral</b> mucosa, clinically and histologically, salivary pH and daily nicotine intake in 20 habitual users of loose snuff. The subjects were studied during use of their usual brand, after 12 weeks use of a snuff with lower pH and after another 12 weeks use of a snuff with both lower pH and lower nicotine concentration. Consumption data, oral soft tissue changes, salivary pH and nicotine intake were meas-ured. Further, biopsies were taken from the central part of the clinically observed lesions and histological changes were analysed. The subjects maintained their snuff consumption during the observation periods. The average salivary pH was higher during snuff use than in the morning. Further, it was higher shortly after the snuff was removed than during snuff use. After having switched to the snuff with both lower pH and lower nicotine concentrations, they showed a significant reduction in daily nicotine intake and developed significantly less pronounced clinical and histological changes. These results indicate that nicotine is one of the substances in snuff that has a biological effect on the oral mucosa.

40|$|During {{the past}} decades Non-Hodgkin {{lymphoma}} (NHL) has demonstrated an immense increase in incidence globally, among almost all age and race {{groups as well}} as in both genders. In the search for causes, none of the known risk factors can alone or together entirely explain this trend. This thesis aims to answer a number of research inquiries with regard to NHL but also other hematolymphoproliferative malignancies. Firstly, we sought to estimate the influence of various forms of tobacco use and body mass index on the risk of NHL, Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), leukemia and multiple myeloma. Secondly, we aimed to disentangle the relative importance of putative determinants of NHL risk in the organ transplant setting, including characteristics of donor and recipient, immunosuppressive medications and infectious complications. Thirdly, our objective was to explore the role of genetic variation in translocation breakpoint genes (BCL 2, CCND 1), the protooncogene MYC and immunoregulatory genes (TNF, IL- 10) in the etiology of NHL. In a large cohort of more than 330, 000 construction workers attending regular health check-ups we employed prospectively gathered exposure information on tobacco use and BMI to analyze the incidence rate ratio (IRR) of NHL and HL in a Cox proportional hazards regression model. Tobacco smoking, <b>oral</b> moist <b>snuff</b> use and BMI were all unrelated to NHL. However, among long term users of <b>oral</b> moist <b>snuff</b> (> 30 years), an indication of an excess risk of HL was observed (IRR 3. 78, 95 % confidence interval [95 % CI] 1. 23 - 11. 6). In a subsequent study of the construction workers cohort we computed IRR for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), acute lymphatic leukemia (ALL) and multiple myeloma (MM) in relation to tobacco use and BMI, applying essentially the same methods. In this investigation, the study population was restricted to male workers and attained age was used as the time scale in the Cox model. Current smoking was associated with a 50 % increased risk of AML (95 % CI 1. 06 - 2. 11). Within a cohort (n= 5391) of organ transplant recipients (1970 - 1997) we designed a nested case control study comprising 37 cases of NHL and 97 controls. Odds ratios (OR) were estimated in a conditional logistic regression model. Treatment with antithymocyte globulin (ATG) conferred a five-fold elevated risk of NHL (95 % CI 2. 17 - 14. 3). The excess risk was more pronounced for a high average daily dose of ATG. Further, having a herpes virus group infection was associated with a five-fold excess risk of NHL (OR 4. 89, 95 % CI 1. 88 - 12. 7), most likely to be driven by Epstein Barr virus. In a case-control study of 2410 incident cases of NHL and 1963 matched controls selected from the Swedish and Danish population registers, subjects took part in a telephone interview and provided blood specimens for genotyping. OR and 95 % CI were computed in multivariate logistic regression analyses. No relationship between investigated polymorphisms in BCL 2, CCND 1 or MYC and NHL could be discerned. TNF rs 1800629 minor allele homozygocity was associated with a 50 % greater risk of NHL (OR 1. 52, 95 % CI, 1. 06 - 2. 18) as well as a two-fold increased risk of T-cell lymphoma and Mantle cell lymphoma, respectively. IL 10 rs 1800890 minor allele homozygocity conferred a higher risk of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (OR 1. 45, CI 1. 10 - 1. 90) and Mantle cell lymphoma (OR 1. 83, 95 % CI 1. 08 - 3. 12) ...|$|R
40|$|Smokeless tobacco, which {{includes}} both <b>oral</b> moist <b>snuff</b> and chewing tobacco, imbues substantial health risks, {{not limited to}} increased chances of oral and pancreatic cancer, gum disease, nicotine addiction, and, among adolescents, increased likelihood of smoking initiation. There {{is little evidence that}} use of smokeless tobacco enhances athletic performance; yet, sporting events and athletic participation are consistently identified as key contexts associated with smokeless tobacco use. The tobacco industry has long marketed smokeless tobacco products at sporting events and targeted elite athletes for product endorsements in order to integrate smokeless tobacco into the sporting culture. Young males, whether striving to gain the acceptance of admired peers or to emulate respected athletes and coaches, often engage in smokeless tobacco experimentation and continued use during sports participation or attendance at sporting events. In the United States, male high school athletes are significantly more likely to use smokeless tobacco than their non-athlete counterparts. The same holds true for female high school athletes, although smokeless tobacco use is much less common among females overall. In contrast, cigarette smoking is less prevalent among high school athletes than non-athletes. Baseball, in particular, is one of several sports, including rodeo, wrestling, ice hockey, and football, that are associated with high levels of smokeless tobacco use among its participants, extending across the high school, college, and professional ranks. Smokeless tobacco use is prohibited on the field of play in college baseball and in the minor leagues.

40|$|There are {{well-documented}} {{differences in}} the absorption of nicotine from smoked tobacco and that from smokeless tobacco products. However, once nicotine from smokeless tobacco has been absorbed into the systemic circulation, {{it is assumed that}} it is distributed, metabolized and excreted similarly, regardless of the route of administration. The experimental designs among the many pharmacokinetic studies of nicotine differ. Some experiments involved the intravenous administration of nicotine (occasionally as a radiolabelled 252 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 89 compound) and subsequent sampling of blood and urine at specified intervals over a fixed time period. In other studies, nicotine was delivered from cigarette smoking and, in relatively few studies, nicotine delivery from smokeless tobacco products was studied. The route of administration is regarded here as important when considering absorption characteristics of nicotine but after nicotine enters the circulation its distribution, metabolism and excretion are regarded as independent of the route of administration (see Table 81).

40|$|Background In Sweden, {{the smoking}} {{prevalence}} has declined. In 2007, it {{was among the}} lowest in the industrialized world. A steady increase in the use of Swedish <b>oral</b> moist <b>snuff,</b> snus, has occurred in parallel. This development is neither solicited by authorities nor the medical establishment, but rather has occurred along with increased awareness of the dangers of smoking, and has been promoted by product development and marketing of snus. Objective To evaluate time trends in patterns of tobacco use in northern Sweden during 1990 – 2007. Design Cross-sectional (99, 381 subjects) and longitudinal (26, 867 subjects) data from the Västerbotten Intervention Programme (VIP) 1990 – 2007 were analyzed. All adults in Västerbotten County are invited to a VIP health examination at ages 40, 50, and 60 years, and until 1995 also 30 years. Smoking and use of snus were evaluated by gender, age and educational groups. Intermittent smoking was categorized as smoking. Results From the period 1990 – 1995 to the period 2002 – 2007, smoking prevalence decreased from 26 to 16 % among men and from 27 to 18 % among women. The differences in prevalence increased between educational groups. The decline in smoking was less and the increase of snus use was greater among those with basic education. The use of snus among basic-educated 40 -year-olds reached 35 % among men and 14 % among women during 2002 – 2007. Dual smoking and snus use increased among men and women with basic education. Smoking without snus use was more prevalent among women. Gender differences in total smoking prevalence (smoking only plus dual use) were small in all age groups, but increased among those with basic education reaching 7. 3 % during 2002 – 2007, with women being more frequent smokers. Smoking prevalences were similar among never, former and current snus users. Among the 30, 000 former smokers, 38 % of men and 64 % of women had never used snus. Longitudinal data showed a decline in total tobacco use from baseline until follow-up and this was mainly due to a smoking cessation rate of< 1 % a year. Snus use was started by 6. 2 % of the 30 -year-old women (age at baseline), and this contributed to a stable prevalence of total tobacco use in this group. Seventy percent of baseline snus users still used snus at follow-up. Among smokers, 55 % continued smoking, 12 % of men and 7 % of women switched to snus. Among those with dual tobacco use at baseline, a third of men and a fourth of women remained dual users 10 years later. Conclusion There are increasing differences in tobacco use between educational groups. Higher smoking and snus use prevalence are found among those with basic education, and this is most pronounced in the younger group of this middle-aged population. In spite of a higher prevalence of smoking without snus use among women, total smoking prevalence is similar in men and women due to a higher prevalence of dual tobacco use, i. e. snus and cigarettes, among men. The increase in snus use is being paralleled by a slight increase in dual use and the smoking prevalence {{does not seem to be}} influenced by snus. This should be the subject of further studies and also have implications for tobacco control policies.

Higher smoking and snus use prevalence are found among those with basic education, and this is most pronounced in the younger group of this middle-aged population. In spite of a higher prevalence of smoking without snus use among women, total smoking prevalence is similar in men and women due to a higher prevalence of dual tobacco use, i. e. snus and cigarettes, among men. The increase in snus use is being paralleled by a slight increase in dual use and the smoking prevalence {{does not seem to be}} influenced by snus. This should be the subject of further studies and also have implications for tobacco control policies...|$|R
40|$|In this article, I {{document}} contemporary highland Maya use {{of traditional}} tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) preparations among the highland Maya (Tzeltal-Tzotzil) of Chiapas, Mexico. Among the Ancient Maya, Nicotiana {{was considered a}} sacred plant, closely associated with deities of earth and sky, and used for both visionary and therapeutic ends. The contemporary Tzeltal and Tzotzil Maya of Highland Chiapas are bearers of this ethnobotanical inheritance, preserving a rich and varied tradition of Nicotiana use and folklore. The entire tobacco plant {{is viewed as a}} primordial medicine and a powerful botanical "helper" or "protector. " Depending on the condition to be treated, whole Nicotiana leaves used are used alone or in combination with other herbs in the preparation of various medicinal plasters and teas. In its most common form, fresh or "green" leaves are ground with slaked lime to produce an intoxicating <b>oral</b> <b>snuff</b> that serves as both a protective and therapeutic agent. Despite its historical and cultural significance, traditional tobacco use is declining in favor of smoked tobaccos. The article closes with a discussion of the social transformations responsible for this decline, reviewing research that suggests tobacco powder snuffs may be less dangerous to health than smoked tobaccos, despite their addictive potential. 26 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Background. Survey {{data on the}} {{prevalence}} of use of <b>oral</b> <b>snuff</b> (toombak) and cigarette consumption according to various demographic factors are needed in the Sudan. Methods. A house to house cross-sectional survey of a random population sample of 4, 535 households was performed. Of the 23, 367 household members identified, 21, 648 (92. 6 %) eligible individuals were questioned about tobacco use. Results. Among children and adolescents (4 – 17 years) prevalence of tobacco use was quite low (2 %, range 1 – 2 %), {{but there was an}} abrupt increase up to 25 % in late adolescence. Among the adult population aged 18 years and older {{the prevalence}}s of toombak use (34 %) and cigarette smoking (12 %) among males were significantly higher than among females (2. 5 and 0. 9 %, respectively). The prevalence of toombak use among the male population aged 18 years and older was significantly higher in the rural than in the urban areas (35 % vs 24 %), while cigarette smoking had a higher prevalence in urban areas (18 % vs 12 %). The highest rates of toombak use were found in rural areas among the male population ages 30 years and older (mean 46. 6 %, range 45 – 47 %). Conclusions. In view of the high prevalence of tobacco use, especially of toombak, among the population surveyed, there is an urgent need to educate the public on the health consequences of these habits. </p...|$|E
40|$|Cigarette {{smoking is}} {{a leading cause of}} {{cardiovascular}} disease. The cardiovascular effects of smoking are probably multifactorial, including effects on platelets. Previous reports investigating the effects of nicotine and tobacco on platelet function are inconsistent. The present study investigated in vitro effects of nicotine, its major metabolites, tobacco extracts and extract of tobacco-free snuff on human platelets. None of the metabolites cotinine, cotinine-N-oxide, nicotine- 1 ′-N-oxide or trans- 3 ′-hydroxycotinine (0. 1 – 10  μM) affected platelet aggregation or P-selectin expression. Nicotine (10  μM) weakly increased platelet aggregation, whereas trans- 3 ′-hydroxycotinine (0. 1  μM) and nicotine- 1 ′-N-oxide (1 – 10  μM) weakly inhibited adhesion to fibrinogen. To elucidate the influence of other tobacco compounds, we investigated the impact of moist tobacco and smoke extracts on platelet function. Filtered extracts of <b>oral</b> <b>snuff,</b> cigarette smoke and tobacco free snuff inhibited platelet adhesion concentration-dependently. The inhibitory effects of tobacco extracts on platelet adhesion were independent of nicotine content and the nitric-oxide-pathway and not mediated through a platelet-nicotine-receptor. Taken together, tobacco extracts inhibit platelet activation during short-term in vitro challenge. As only limited effects of nicotine and nicotine metabolites were seen, the tobacco-induced platelet inhibition are likely induced by other compounds present in tobacco and tobacco free snuff.

30|$|It is {{acknowledged}} that {{a sample size}} of n[*]=[*] 9 is relatively small; however, clear and directional statistical results were observed even with this sample. It is also {{worth noting that the}} finding of the 4  mg gum minimally affecting the performance measures was not due to side effects masking or reducing any ergogenic effect(s), as none were reported. There are many different nicotine delivery systems commonly available (over-the-counter) including nasal spray, gum, inhaler, lozenge, sublingual tablet and transdermal patch. The different delivery systems result in different nicotine bioavailability and absorption and therefore pharmacokinetics such that, for example, peak systemic concentrations are observed whilst smoking a cigarette, followed by <b>oral</b> <b>snuff</b> and chewing tobacco with gum being the lowest, possibly due to the first-pass metabolism and nicotine being retained in the gum itself [3]. The observed cotinine concentration from chewing gum was indeed lower than that observed with oral smokeless tobacco and transdermal patch [12, 24]; therefore, it would be of interest to directly compare different delivery systems on the same experimental sample and performance protocol. There is also considerable inter-individual variability in nicotine metabolism (e.g. nutrition, age, sex, medication, ethnicity, genetics; see [3]) as we observed for NIC- 2 (Fig.  1) and thus, we cannot be certain that our n[*]=[*] 3 is the representative of the whole sample. Further, dosing (e.g. absolute vs. relative) needs to be more carefully considered for future studies. Finally, as the primary outcome measure {{of the present study was}} performance, future studies should include further mechanistic insights i.e. motor unit activation (twitch interpolation, electromyography).|$|E
40|$|C. Other {{relevant}} data An increased {{incidence of}} micronuclei {{was observed in}} exfoliated epithelial cells from chewers of khaini and nass. Saliva collected from chewers of Indian tobacco induced chromosomal aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary cells in vitr 05. Ethanol extracts of Indian chewing tobacco induced micronuclei in bone-marrow cells of Swiss mice treated in vivo and were mutagenic to Chinese hamster V 79 cells in vitro, both in the presence and absence of an exogenous metabolic system, and to Salmonella typhimurium. Both ethanol and ethyl acetate extracts of Sri Lankan chewing tobacco induced transformation of Syrian hamster embryo cells. Ethyl acetate extracts induced sister chromatid ex changes in cultured human cells, but not mutation in Chinese hamster V 79 cells when tested {{in the absence of}} an exogenous metabolic system 5. Aqueous extracts of nass and khaini induced chromos omal aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Powdered tobacco fed to larvae of Drosophila did not induce sexlinked recessive lethal mutations, autosomal translocations or sex-chromosome loss 5.

40|$|Oesophageal cancer {{remains an}} {{important}} {{public health problem}} worldwide. This multicentre matched case-control study examined the chewing areca nut alone, betel quid with tobacco, <b>oral</b> <b>snuff</b> (snuff dipping) and cigarette smoking as the risk factors for oesophageal squamous-cell carcinoma. We enrolled 91 cases of oesophageal squamous-cell carcinoma and 364 matched controls from three tertiary-care hospitals in Karachi, Pakistan. A structured questionnaire was used to collect the data through face-to-face interview of the participants. Multivariable conditional logistic regression model showed that after adjusting for the effect of ethnicity, ever chewed areca nut alone (adjusted matched odds ratio (mOR(adj)) = 3. 7, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 6 - 8. 5), ever chewed betel quid with tobacco (mOR(adj) = 12. 8, 95 % CI: 6. 3 - 26. 2), ever practiced snuff dipping (mOR(adj) = 4. 3, 95 % CI: 1. 6 - 11. 7) and ever smoked cigarettes (mOR(adj) = 2. 9, 95 % CI: 1. 4 - 5. 9) were significantly and independently associated with oesophageal squamous-cell carcinoma status. The adjusted summary population attributable risk (PAR) percent for all four substances together was 67. 0. Furthermore, despite incomplete synergy, there was manifold increase {{in the risk of}} oesophageal squamous-cell carcinoma, if the respondents ever smoked cigarettes and ever chewed betel quid with tobacco (mOR(adj) = 21. 4, 95 % CI: 6. 3 - 72. 4) or if they ever smoked cigarettes and ever practiced snuff dipping (mOR(adj) = 14. 4, 95 % CI: 2. 3 - 91. 1). The adjusted PAR (%) was higher for the dual practice of smoking cigarettes and chewing betel quid with tobacco (64. 3) than the dual practice of smoking cigarettes and snuff dipping (32. 2). Public awareness to curtail the addiction to these substances may result in a substantial reduction in the incidence of oesophageal squamous-cell carcinoma and related mortality in this and similar settings...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{development}} of ultrasonographic arterial imaging, high-resolution B-mode ultrasonography, {{has created a}} technical basis for a new diagnostic approach to atherosclerotic disease by offering the possibility of accurate and reproducible quantification of the structural and functional changes in the arterial wall. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery and carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) {{have been shown to}} be good surrogate markers of atherosclerosis. Atherosclerotic lesions detected in the thoracic aorta by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) are markers of diffuse atherosclerotic disease, often associated with coronary, carotid and peripheral vascular disease. Aims: The aims of this thesis were to study whether intake of oral moist snuff causes acute endothelial dysfunction in the brachial artery of long-term snuff users. to assess the strength of any relation between walls changes in the thoracic aorta and carotid arteries and the angiographic severity and extent of coronary artery lesions in patients with angiographically verified CAD. to examine the relationship between morphological and functional parameters of the brachial and carotid arteries and the angiographic extent and severity of coronary artery stenosis in patients with severe CAD. to determine the influence of low-dose prednisolone on atherosclerosis, endothelial function, and risk factors for atherosclerosis in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods: The acute effect of 1 g <b>oral</b> <b>snuff</b> on endothelial function in 20 healthy, long-term snuff users was measured by FMD. The effect on heart rate and blood pressure was also measured. The strength of any relation between the angiographic severity and extent of coronary artery lesions on the one hand and ultrasonographically measured walls changes in the thoracic aorta (n= 37), carotid arteries and brachial artery and endothelial function in the brachial artery on the other hand was investigated by TEE, carotid and brachial B-mode scanning and FMD in 58 patients who had undergone coronary angiography. In a randomized study 67 patients with early, active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were randomized to either 7. 5 mg prednisolone daily (n= 34) or no prednisolone (n= 33). The effects of the low-dose treatment with prednisolone on the brachial endothelial function and the carotid wall thickness were studied by FMD and B-mode ultrasonography, respectively, after a mean of 5 years treatment. The relation between risk factors for atherosclerosis and the above mentioned ultrasonographic parameters was investigated. Results: FMD values declined significantly after the administration of oral moist snuff. Heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure increased significantly after snuff administration. All parameters remained unchanged after placebo. A significant correlation was seen between the extent of coronary artery stenosis and aortic plaques score. Mean carotid IMT was also significantly correlated with coronary artery stenosis extent score. Moreover, a significant correlation was seen between the aortic plaque score and the mean carotid IMT. A significant correlation was seen between the extent of coronary artery stenosis defined as the coronary angiographic score and both the mean brachial artery IMT and intima media area (IMa). There was no significant correlation between FMD and the extent of coronary artery stenosis. A significant correlation was seen between the mean carotid artery IMT and the mean brachial artery IMT. However, there was no significant correlation between FMD and the mean carotid artery IMT or IMa. Carotid IMT and IMa, prevalence of carotid atherosclerotic plaques and FMD in brachial artery did not differ between RA patients treated with and those not treated with prednisolone. Carotid IMT and IMa, but not brachial FMD, were significantly associated with traditional risk factors for atherosclerosis in patients with RA. Conclusions: Intake of oral moist snuff significantly impaired endothelial function, measured as FMD of the brachial artery, in long-term snuffers. As endothelial dysfunction predicts cardiovascular morbidity, use of <b>oral</b> <b>snuff</b> should be discouraged. Morphological parameters of the carotid arteries and the thoracic aorta were related to severity and extent of coronary artery stenosis in patients with severe CAD. B-mode ultrasonography of the carotid arteries and transesophageal echocardiography of the aorta therefore have a potential for diagnostic evaluation of patients with suspected CAD. Morphological but not functional parameters of the brachial artery were associated with the extent of coronary artery stenosis and atherosclerotic wall changes in the carotid arteries in patients with severe CAD. These findings indicate a potential of B-mode ultrasonography of morphological parameters in the brachial artery in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with suspected CAD. Low-dose prednisolone did not influence endothelial function or subclinical atherosclerosis in patients with RA. The study verifies the relation between risk factors for atherosclerosis and carotid IMT and IMa...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{prevalence}} of smoking in Sweden has decreased in recent decades, {{and is now}} among {{the lowest in the}} world. During the same period, the use of Swedish moist <b>oral</b> <b>snuff,</b> a smokeless tobacco called snus, has increased. Few studies have evaluated time trends of the socioeconomic and geographic characteristics of snus users in Sweden. This paper contributes to filling that gap. Methods This study utilized the Linnaeus Database, which links national registers with comprehensive individual data on socioeconomic status (SES) to health data from a large ongoing health survey, the Västerbotten Intervention Programme (VIP). The VIP targets the entire middle-aged population of Västerbotten county at ages 40, 50 and 60 years with yearly cross-sectional surveys including self-reported data on tobacco habits. Time trends of snus use among 92, 563 VIP-participants across different areas of residence and smoking groups were investigated graphically. Logistic regression was performed to estimate the associations between SES and geographical variables and current use versus non-use of snus. Results Overall, in parallel to decreasing smoking, the increasing trend of snus use in this middle-aged population continues, particularly in 40 -year-olds. In both genders, the highest {{prevalence of}} snus use was observed among previous smokers. The prevalence of snus use also increased over time among smokers, and was consistently higher compared to those who had never smoked. Among males - both those who had never smoked and previous smokers - low education (OR 1. 21, 95 %CI 1. 06 - 1. 40 and OR 1. 28, 95 %CI 1. 14 - 1. 43), living alone (OR 1. 16, 95 %CI 1. 07 - 1. 27 and OR 1. 13, 95 %ci 1. 04 - 1. 23), low income and living in rural areas was associated with using snus, while this was not seen among male current smokers. Among women, living alone was associated with using snus irrespective of smoking habits. Among female smokers, the OR for snus use increased with higher education. Conclusions A disadvantaged social profile and also higher prevalence in rural areas is observed among male snus users who had never smoked or were previous smokers. Among male smokers there was no association between SES and use of snus. The prevalence of snus use among women is increasing, but is still considerably lower than that of men. The association between snus and SES characteristics is less pronounced among women, although snus is clearly linked to living alone. These patterns should be taken into consideration in tobacco control policies. </p...|$|E
40|$|Magister Scientiae Dentium - MSc(Dent) Background: Reports on {{the global}} {{incidence}} of oral neoplasms indicate reduced data from Africa. Population based studies of oral cancer in Sudan and other regions of Africa are scarce. Oral cancer in Sudan constitutes a serious health problem, and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the most prevalent type of oral malignancy. There are descriptive epidemiologic studies from Sudan that have reported high a frequency rate of oral cancer in Sudanese males, linking this high incidence to Toombak, a product of <b>oral</b> <b>snuff</b> mixed with sodium bicarbonate (Idris et al, 1995 (b)), but to date no population-based studies of oral cancer incidence in Sudan have been performed or published. Title: Epidemiology of Oral Malignancy in Sudan (2004 - 2008). Aims and Objectives: The objectives {{of the study were}} to analyse the pattern of distribution and to determine the minimum age standardized incidence rates (ASIR) and the cumulative (lifetime) risk (CR) of oral & lip squamous cell carcinoma / oral malignancy by site, age and gender for the 5 -year period 2004 - 2008. Methods: The records of patients with oral & maxillofacial and salivary malignancies (OMFS) referred to Khartoum Dental Teaching Hospital (KDTH) and the population census data were accessioned. Data was captured using Microsoft Excel 2007 ® and the ASIRs for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) were calculated using the direct International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) method. These results were compared with the on-line global cancer statistics database (GLOBOCAN -WHO/IARC) for 2008 and 2012. Records of oral cancer cases during the period of the study were obtained from KDTH. The information included in the raw data collected were the file number for patient identification, year of diagnosis, age, sex, site of the lesion, histological diagnosis, the International Classification of Diseases- 10 (ICD 10) codes, the referring unit and the state from which the patient was referred. The population data for the years of the study and the five age group stratifications was obtained from the Central Statistical Office in Khartoum, Sudan. The data was analysed using Microsoft Excel, 2007 ®. Age standardized incidence rate of oral & lip squamous cell carcinoma/ oral malignancy was calculated using the direct IARC method. Results: Of the total Sudanese population of 36. 3 million in 2006, 649 OMFS malignancies (M:F= 1. 44 : 1) were captured at KDTH during the 5 -year period; 390 (M:F= 1. 67 : 1) were (intra) oral squamous cancers (OSCC) and verrucous carcinomas (VC). The ASIR for OSCC/VC in Sudan was calculated as 3. 19 for males and 1. 83 for females (M:F= 1. 74 : 1), however the pooled ASIR in the Khartoum and Gezira States was 30 % higher for males (4. 21) and 14 % higher for females (2. 09, M:F= 2. 01 : 1). The incidence over the 5 years of separately recorded lip SCC/VC in Sudanese males was 26 and 8 for females (M:F= 3. 25 : 1). The ASIRs of combined oral & lip SCC/VC in Sudanese males was 3. 45 and 1. 88 for females (M:F= 1. 84 : 1). These compare relatively well with the GLOBOCAN data which estimates a slightly lower ASIR of 3. 3 for males and somewhat higher ASIR of 2. 1 for females (M:F= 1. 57 : 1). The cumulative (lifetime) risk (CR 0 - 74) of developing oral and lip cancer was 1 : 182 for males compared to 1 : 831 for females. For oral cancer (excluding lip), the CR was almost similar for males (1 : 181); while females showed a markedly higher CR (1 : 344). Conclusion: The combined ASIRs of oral & lip SCC/VC from the Khartoum and Gezira states differed from the ASIRs calculated for the entire Sudan and from the GLOBOCAN estimates. The recording of cancer incidence data can vary according to the (incorrect) labelling of anatomical locations and diagnosis. The numbers are influenced by geo-political, environmental and socio-economic factors, and referral bias...|$|E
