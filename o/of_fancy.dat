5|$|Further {{dividing}} the varieties <b>of</b> <b>fancy</b> rats are {{the many different}} markings. Pet rats can appear in any combination of colors and markings. The markings are typically {{in reference to the}} patterns and ratios of colored hair versus white hair. Two extremes would be a self (completely solid, non-white color) and a Himalayan (completely white except blending into colored areas at the nose and feet, called points, as in a Himalayan cat's markings).|$|E
5|$|Hope {{is closely}} related to Idle Child <b>of</b> <b>Fancy,</b> {{completed}} by Watts in 1885, which also shows a personification of one of the traditional virtues (in this case Love) sitting on a cloud-shrouded globe. In traditional depictions of the virtues, Love was shown blindfolded while Hope was not; in Hope and Idle Child Watts reversed this imagery, depicting Love looking straight ahead and Hope as blind. It {{is believed to be the}} first time a European artist depicted Hope as blind.|$|E
5|$|The {{episodes of}} the Japanese anime {{television}} series , officially named Ah!

Like its predecessor, the anime {{does not follow}} the manga chronologically. The plot follows the adventures of Keiichi and Belldandy {{in the aftermath of}} the Lord of Terror fiasco.|$|E

5|$|Ann {{discovers that}} her predecessor, Emily Jessel (Lightfoot), {{is buried in}} Bly's church, and is told that Jessel killed herself. She also begins to see the figures {{of a young man}} and a young woman around Bly. Mrs Grose dismisses Ann's stories, but one maid, Carla (Walker), tells Ann of the sexually abusive former valet Peter Quint (MacLiam). Mrs Grose reveals that Carla had been badly {{affected}} by the War, and is prone to flights <b>of</b> <b>fancy.</b> Later, Ann is woken at night by the figure of the woman, and follows her to find Flora standing next to an open window. The pair see Carla fall from the roof, landing near Miles, who is in the garden. Ann rushes outside, and sees the male figure on the roof. Inside again, Mrs Grose assures Ann that she must be confused.|$|E
5|$|The luster of {{a diamond}} is {{described}} as 'adamantine', which simply means diamond-like. Reflections on a properly cut diamond's facets are undistorted, due to their flatness. The refractive index of diamond (as measured via sodium light, 589.3nm) is 2.417. Because it is cubic in structure, diamond is also isotropic. Its high dispersion of 0.044 (variation of refractive index across the visible spectrum) manifests in the perceptible fire of cut diamonds. This fire—flashes of prismatic colors seen in transparent stones—is perhaps diamond's most important optical property from a jewelry perspective. The prominence or amount of fire seen in a stone is heavily influenced by the choice of diamond cut and its associated proportions (particularly crown height), although the body color <b>of</b> <b>fancy</b> (i.e., unusual) diamonds may hide their fire to some degree.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Anime International Company {{produced}} a five-episode OVA series {{based on the}} manga series. Its success inspired a spinoff TV series entitled The Adventures of Mini-Goddess. Produced by Oriental Light and Magic and initially aired on WOWOW in 1998 and 1999, the plot revolved around the adventures of three miniaturized goddesses and their rat companion Gan-chan, all of whom live in a temple home. In 2005, Tokyo Broadcasting System (TBS) began broadcasting Ah! My Goddess, a new series directed by Hiroaki Gōda and animated by Anime International Company. It ran for 24 episodes between January 7 and July 8, 2005. A sequel also animated by Anime International Company and directed by Gōda, Ah! My Goddess: Flights <b>of</b> <b>Fancy,</b> aired on TBS between April 6 and September 14, 2006. A two-episode special entitled Ah! My Goddess: Fighting Wings, animated by Anime International Company and directed by Gōda, was broadcast on TBS on December 9, 2007.|$|E

25|$|The {{buttons on}} a frock coat were always covered in cloth, often {{to match the}} silk on the revers, showing in the {{triangle}} of lining wrapped over {{the inside of the}} lapels.

25|$|It was at {{this event}} that the Swedish {{tradition}} <b>of</b> <b>fancy</b> diving {{was introduced to the}} sport by the athletes Otto Hagborg and C F Mauritzi. They demonstrated their acrobatic techniques from the 10m diving board at Highgate Pond and stimulated the establishment of the Amateur Diving Association in 1901, the first organization devoted to diving in the world (later amalgamated with the Amateur Swimming Association). Fancy diving was formally introduced into the championship in 1903.|$|E

In the summer there are also several other festivals, including the agricultural preservation rally in which vintage tractor, farm equipment, rare breed animals and threshing demonstrations are shown as well as some vintage cars and traction engines. This is currently being hosted at Trevorgans Farm and is traditionally held on the last Saturday of July.|$|E

25|$|The first written {{reference}} to mice kept as pets {{occurs in the}} Erya, the oldest extant Chinese dictionary, from a mention in an 1100 BC version. In Europe the breeding <b>of</b> <b>fancy</b> mice became popular through the introduction of Japanese stock in the early 17th century. By 1895, Walter Maxey founded the National Mouse Club in Victorian England, with its first official show held in Lincoln that year. Since that time, mouse clubs have formed worldwide. Shows are held so competitive breeders can display their mice, where they are judged on color, body shape and behavior.|$|E
25|$|In a {{competitive}} market the title of miscellanies was increasingly important. Without a specific selling-point, more generic complications would use catch-all titles as a tactic to familiarise themselves {{with a wide range}} of audiences and to appeal to a breadth of tastes. Titles could evoke the ornamental (The Bouquet: or Blossoms <b>of</b> <b>Fancy,</b> 1796), the medicinal (The Merry Companion: or, A Cure for the Spleen, 1730), the festive or feast (A Banquet of the Muses: or The Miscellany of Miscellanies, 1746), the curious (A Museum for Young Gentlemen and Ladies, 1751–82), and the curatorial (The Foundling Hospital for Wit, 1743–64).|$|E
25|$|The {{first known}} European lotteries were held during the Roman Empire, mainly as an {{amusement}} at dinner parties. Each guest {{would receive a}} ticket, and prizes would often consist <b>of</b> <b>fancy</b> items such as dinnerware. Every ticket holder would be assured of winning something. This type of lottery, however, {{was no more than}} the distribution of gifts by wealthy noblemen during the Saturnalian revelries. The earliest records of a lottery offering tickets for sale is the lottery organized by Roman Emperor Augustus Caesar. The funds were for repairs in the City of Rome, and the winners were given prizes in the form of articles of unequal value.|$|E

His latest collection, The Door Gunner and Other Perilous Flights <b>of</b> <b>Fancy,</b> a career retrospective, was published in February 2012 by Subterranean Press. His stories have appeared in such publications as Playboy, Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine, Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine, Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine, the Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, the Missouri Review, the Indiana Review, the Chattahoochee Review, the Georgia Review, Omni, and Interzone. His work has been translated into more than a dozen languages.|$|E
25|$|The {{inclusions}} seen in moissanite {{are also}} characteristic: most will have fine, white, subparallel growth tubes or needles oriented {{perpendicular to the}} stone's table. It is conceivable that these growth tubes could be mistaken for laser drill holes that are sometimes seen in diamond (see diamond enhancement), but the tubes will be noticeably doubled in moissanite due to its birefringence. Like synthetic rutile, current moissanite production is also plagued by an as yet inescapable tint, which is usually a brownish green. A limited range <b>of</b> <b>fancy</b> colors have been produced as well, the two most common being blue and green. Jewel-quality moissanite is produced by only one company, Charles & Colvard. Its limited availability makes moissanite about 120 times more expensive than cubic zirconia.|$|E
25|$|After World War II, Bernstein's {{career on}} the {{international}} stage began to flourish. In 1946, he made his overseas debut with the Czech Philharmonic in Prague. He also recorded Ravel's Piano Concerto in G as soloist and conductor with the Philharmonia Orchestra. On July 4, 1946, Bernstein conducted the European premiere <b>of</b> <b>Fancy</b> Free with the Ballet Theatre at the Royal Opera House in London. In 1946, he conducted opera for the first time, with the American première at Tanglewood of Benjamin Britten's Peter Grimes, which had been a Koussevitzky commission. That same year, Arturo Toscanini invited Bernstein to guest conduct two concerts with the NBC Symphony Orchestra, one of which again featured Bernstein as soloist in the Ravel concerto.|$|E
