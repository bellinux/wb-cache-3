5|$|By {{four days}} before Isabel made landfall, most weather models {{predicted}} Isabel to make landfall between North Carolina and New Jersey. Initially, forecasters predicted it to move along the coastline <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chesapeake</b> Bay, though as the hurricane neared land the predicted track was much closer to where it ultimately was. The National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch from the North Carolina/Virginia border to Chincoteague near its border with Maryland about 50hours before Isabel struck land, including the southern portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chesapeake</b> Bay. 18hours before the hurricane made landfall, the National Hurricane Center upgraded the watch to a hurricane warning for the entire coastline. Additionally, inland hurricane and tropical storm warnings were issued for south-central Virginia. The Wakefield National Weather Service office issued three tornado warnings for four counties, though none became tornadoes. The office also issued two county-wide flood warnings and 43 flood warnings and flood statements for various river basins.|$|E

5|$|On {{environmental}} issues, Mathias {{established a}} {{record as a}} strong advocate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chesapeake</b> Bay. After touring the bay shoreline in 1973, he sponsored legislation {{that led to a}} study by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) two years later, which was one of the first reports that made the public aware of harmful levels of nutrients and toxins in the waters. As a result, the report was one of the catalysts for cleanup efforts, and evolved into the Chesapeake Bay Program. In recognition, the Charles Mathias Laboratory, part of the Smithsonian Institution, was established in 1988 as a research facility to analyze human impact on the bay. In 1990, the Mathias Medal was established by Maryland Sea Grant at the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science as further acknowledgment of Mathias' environmental record. In 2003, thirty years after he launched a study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chesapeake,</b> Mathias was recognized by the Army Corps of Engineers for the influential role he played initiating restoration efforts.|$|E

5|$|His health declining, Baltimore's {{persistence}} {{over the}} charter finally {{paid off in}} 1632. The king first granted him a location south of Jamestown, but Baltimore asked the king to reconsider in response to opposition from other investors interested in settling the new land of Carolina into a sugar plantation. Baltimore eventually compromised by accepting redrawn boundaries {{to the north of}} the Potomac River, on either side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chesapeake</b> Bay. The charter was about to pass when the fifty-two-year-old Baltimore died in his lodgings at Lincoln's Inn Fields, on 15 April 1632. Five weeks later, on 20 June 1632, the charter for Maryland passed the seals.|$|E

5|$|However, Claiborne {{was offered}} a {{position}} as a land surveyor in the new colony of Virginia, and arrived at Jamestown, {{on the north shore}} of the James River in 1621. The position carried a 200acre (80hectare) land grant, a salary of £30 per year, and the promise of fees paid by settlers who needed to have their land grants surveyed. His political acumen quickly {{made him one of the}} most successful Virginia colonists, and within four years of his arrival he had secured grants for 1,100acres (445hectares) of land and a retroactive salary of £60 a year from the Virginia Colony's council. He also managed to survive the March 1622 attacks by native/Indian Powhatans on the Virginia settlers that killed more than 300colonists. His financial success was followed by political success, and he gained appointment as Councilor in 1624 and Secretary of State for the Colony in 1626. Around 1627, he began to trade for furs with the native Susquehannock Indians from further north on the shores <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chesapeake</b> Bay and two of its largest tributaries, the Potomac and Susquehanna Rivers. To facilitate this trade, Claiborne wanted to establish a trading post on Kent Island in the mid-way <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chesapeake</b> Bay, which he intended to make the center of a vast mercantile empire along the Atlantic Coast. Claiborne found both financial and political support for the Kent Island venture from London merchants Maurice Thomson, William Cloberry, John de la Barre, and Simon Turgis.|$|E
5|$|In 1607, after {{a voyage}} of 144 days, three ships headed by Captain Christopher Newport, and {{carrying}} 105 men and boys, made their first landfall in the New World on the mainland, where the southern mouth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chesapeake</b> Bay meets the Atlantic Ocean. They named it Cape Henry, after Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, {{the eldest son}} of King James I of England. These English colonists of the Virginia Company of London moved on from this area, as they were under orders to seek a site further inland, which would be more sheltered from ships of competing European countries. They created their first permanent settlement {{on the north side}} of the James River at Jamestown.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{forecasts}} {{predicted a}} landfall on the Outer Banks of North Carolina, with winds of 100mph (160km/h); however, these forecasts {{were made with}} great uncertainty. While Felix was still near Bermuda on August15, the NHC issued hurricane warnings for the eastern United States from Little River, South Carolina to Chincoteague, Virginia and including the Pamlico Sound, Albemarle Sound, and southern portions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chesapeake</b> Bay. Tropical storm warnings were also issued from Chincoteague to near Manasquan, New Jersey, including the Chesapeake and Delaware bays. The watches and warnings remained in place until August18. Despite the lack of landfall, the NHC deemed the watches and warnings as appropriate due to the projected track.|$|E

5|$|News of Barras' {{departure}} led the British {{to realize}} that the Chesapeake was the probable target of the French fleets.

40|$|<b>The</b> War <b>of</b> 1812 was a {{conflict}} between Great Britain and the United States. It evolved from the Napoleonic Wars in which Great Britain and France vied for naval supremacy. In 1806, Napoleon issued the Berlin Decree which ordered all ports under his control to be closed to British ships and demanded that all neutral and French ships would be seized if they entered a British port {{en route to a}} continental port. The British retaliated with Orders-in-Council which stipulated that all neutral ships obtain a licence before sailing to Europe. The British began to stop and search American ships for contraband and to press American citizens into service on the British ships. <b>The</b> culmination <b>of</b> these tactics was <b>the</b> <b>Chesapeake</b> Affair. In 1807, several British sailors deserted their ship the HMS Leopard that was patrolling along <b>the</b> shore <b>of</b> <b>Chesapeake</b> Bay between Maryland and Virginia.
