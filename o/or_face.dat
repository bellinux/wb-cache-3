40|$|ABSTRACT—Recognizing {{individual}} faces outside one’s race poses difficulty, {{a phenomenon}} known as the other-race effect. Most researchers agree that this effect results from differential experience with same-race (SR) and other-race (<b>OR)</b> <b>faces.</b> However, the specific processes that de-velop with visual experience and underlie the other-race effect remain to be clarified. We tested whether the inte-gration of facial features into a whole representation— holistic processing—was larger for SR than <b>OR</b> <b>faces</b> in Caucasians and Asians without life experience with <b>OR</b> <b>faces.</b> For both classes of participants, recognition of {{the upper half of}} a composite-face stimulus was more dis-rupted by the bottom half (the composite-face effect) for SR than <b>OR</b> <b>faces,</b> demonstrating that SR faces are processed more holistically than <b>OR</b> <b>faces.</b> This differential holisti...|$|R

40|$|Memory {{is often}} less {{accurate}} for faces from another racial group than for faces from one's own racial group. The mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are {{a topic of}} active debate. Contemporary theories invoke factors such as inferior expertise with faces from other racial groups and an encoding emphasis on race-specifying information. We investigated neural mechanisms of this memory bias by recording event-related potentials while participants attempted to memorize same-race (SR) and other-race (<b>OR)</b> <b>faces.</b> Brain potentials at encoding were compared {{as a function of}} successful versus unsuccessful recognition on a subsequent-memory test. Late positive amplitudes predicted subsequent memory for SR faces and, to a lesser extent, for <b>OR</b> <b>faces.</b> By contrast, the amplitudes of earlier frontocentral N 200 potentials and occipito-temporal P 2 potentials were larger for later-remembered relative to later-forgotten <b>OR</b> <b>faces.</b> Furthermore, N 200 and P 2 amplitudes were larger for <b>OR</b> <b>faces</b> with features considered atypical of that race relative to faces that were race-stereotypical (according to a consensus from a large group of other participants). In keeping with previous reports, we infer that these earlier potentials index the processing of unique or individuating facial information, which is key to remembering a face. Individuation may tend to be uniformly high for SR faces but lower and less reliable for <b>OR</b> <b>faces.</b> Individuation may also be more readily applied for <b>OR</b> <b>faces</b> that appear less stereotypical. These electrophysiological measures thus provide novel evidence that poorer memory for <b>OR</b> <b>faces</b> stems from encoding that is inadequate because it fails to emphasize individuating information...|$|R
