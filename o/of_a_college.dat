5|$|Discussions {{regarding}} the founding <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>college</b> in the Province of New York began {{as early as}} 1704, at which time Colonel Lewis Morris wrote to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, the missionary arm of the Church of England, persuading the society that New York City was an ideal community in which to establish a college. However, {{it was not until}} the founding of the College of New Jersey (the present Princeton University) across the Hudson River in New Jersey that the City of New York seriously consider founding a college. In 1746, an act was passed by the general assembly of New York to raise funds for the foundation of a new college. In 1751, the assembly appointed a commission of ten New York residents, seven of whom were members of the Church of England, to direct the funds accrued by the state lottery towards the foundation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>college.</b>|$|E

5|$|He was {{appointed}} Lucasian Professor of Mathematics in 1669 on Barrow's recommendation. During that time, any Fellow <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>college</b> at Cambridge or Oxford {{was required to}} take holy orders and become an ordained Anglican priest. However, {{the terms of the}} Lucasian professorship required that the holder not be active in the church (presumably so as to have more time for science). Newton argued that this should exempt him from the ordination requirement, and Charles II, whose permission was needed, accepted this argument. Thus a conflict between Newton's religious views and Anglican orthodoxy was averted.|$|E

5|$|After {{four years}} in retirement, he {{received}} an unexpected invitation to become Master of Peterhouse in 1987, thus becoming {{the first person in}} over four centuries to lead a college at both Oxford and Cambridge. Chadwick's second appointment as head <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>college</b> proved a happier experience than his first. The college had been experiencing some problems following the admission of the first female students, to which some fellows were implacably opposed, making their displeasure known at High Table. Chadwick insisted on civility, which coupled with the retirement of some of the fellows, ensured an improvement in the atmosphere within the college. This continued after his second retirement (again to Oxford) in 1993. He was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1989 Queen's Birthday Honours. In 1991 he published a new translation of Augustine's Confessions, with extensive notes revealing Augustine's debt to Plotinus.|$|E

5|$|In 1965, Cade was {{approached}} by Dewayne Douglas, an assistant coach for the Florida Gators football team, about the extreme dehydration faced by Gator football players practicing in the high temperatures and humidity of the Deep South in late summer and early fall. Douglas questioned Cade why his football players did not urinate during practice and games. Cade learned from anecdotal evidence that football players were losing water through perspiration and failing to replace fluid during practice and games. Cade's research team discovered that football players were losing up to 18 pounds (8.2 kilograms) during the three hours <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>college</b> football game, and that ninety to ninety-five percent of that loss was water. A player's plasma volume could decrease as much as seven percent and blood volume by five percent, and sodium and chloride were excreted in the sweat.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, Chadwick was {{appointed}} Dean of Christ Church, uniquely a dual {{role as a}} cathedral dean and head <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>college.</b> This period was not entirely happy; a scholarly ability to see all sides of a question, along with an ingrained desire not to upset his colleagues, sometimes made it {{hard for him to}} make a quick or firm decision. However, during his time as Dean the college benefited from a continued programme of renovation with internal changes that provided more student accommodation. The position gave Chadwick the chance to influence the musical direction of the cathedral. In The Independent newspaper, obituary writer Andrew Louth notes that at the retirement of Sydney Watson as organist, when he and Chadwick played piano duets together Chadwick's technique was the equal of Watson's. The new organist, Simon Preston, had ambitious plans for improving musical standards, and Chadwick was pleased to be able to support these, not least by raising funds for a new organ.|$|E

It is likely that building began between 1424 and 1429, and the main hall and cloister rooms finished by 1458. It remains the most complete building {{of its kind in the}} country, and at the time of its construction, was the second largest building in Manchester, surpassed only by the church.|$|E

Upon seizing power, he switched Egypt's allegiance to the Baghdad-based Abbasid Caliphate which adhered to Sunni Islam.|$|E

5|$|Within Geneva, Calvin's {{main concern}} was the {{creation}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>collège,</b> an institute {{for the education of}} children. A site for the school was selected on 25 March 1558 and it opened the following year on 5 June 1559. Although the school was a single institution, it was divided into two parts: a grammar school called the collège or schola privata and an advanced school called the académie or schola publica. Calvin tried to recruit two professors for the institute, Mathurin Cordier, his old friend and Latin scholar who was now based in Lausanne, and Emmanuel Tremellius, the former Regius professor of Hebrew in Cambridge. Neither was available, but he succeeded in obtaining Theodore Beza as rector. Within five years there were 1,200 students in the grammar school and 300 in the advanced school. The collège eventually became the Collège Calvin, one of the college preparatory schools of Geneva; the académie became the University of Geneva.|$|E
5|$|The first schools {{offering}} Western-style {{education in}} the presidency were established in Madras during the 18th century. In 1822, a Board of Public Instruction was created based on the recommendations of Sir Thomas Munro, after which schools teaching students in vernacular language was established. A central training school {{was set up in}} Madras as per Munro's scheme. However, this system appeared to be a failure and the policy was altered in 1836 in order to promote European literature and science. The Board of Public Instruction was superseded by a Committee for Native Education. In January 1840, during the viceroyalty of Lord Ellenborough, a University Board was established with Alexander J. Arbuthnot as the Joint Director of Public Instruction. The central school was converted to a high school in April 1841 with 67 students and in 1853 became the Presidency College with the addition <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>college</b> department. On 5 September 1857, the University of Madras was established as an examining body using the University of London as a model with the first examinations held in February 1858. C. W.
