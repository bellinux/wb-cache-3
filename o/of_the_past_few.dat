25|$|The idea of {{expanding}} Siegfried's Tod {{into a series}} of two or more operas would have been particularly appealing to Wagner, as he had now come to realize that {{it would be impossible to}} say all that he wanted to in a single opera without an inordinate number of digressions. The political events <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>few</b> years and his recent discovery of the philosophy of Ludwig Feuerbach had greatly enlarged the scope of ideas which he hoped to explore in his new opera. He also wished to incorporate various ideas that he had been mulling over in the works on Jesus, Frederick, Achilles and Wieland (all four of which had been effectively abandoned by now). These ideas ranged over the politics of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Mikhail Bakunin and the philosophy of Hegel and the Young Hegelians.|$|E
25|$|The carbon-bonded {{hydrogen}} {{isotopic composition}} of cellulose, as inherited from leaf water, {{has the potential}} of preserving the original meteoric water signal. This was first demonstrated in the 1970s. In a systematic survey across North America, tree cellulose δD was found to have a temperature sensitivity of 5.8‰/°C, similar to precipitation δD sensitivity of 5.6‰/°C. This spatial correlation may be complicated by local effects of soil evaporation and leaf transpiration, and the spatial gradient may not be representative of temporal changes in tree ring cellulose at a single place. The mechanism that generates the δD signal in cellulose from meteoric water is not completely understood, but at least includes leaf water transpiration, synthesis of carbohydrates, synthesis of cellulose from photosynthetic sugars, and exchange of sugars with xylem water. Modeling studies show that observed tree ring cellulose δD can be produced when 36% of the hydrogen in sugars can exchange with xylem water, and effects such as humidity and rainfall seasonality may complicate the cellulose δD proxy. Despite these complications, tree ring δD have been used for paleoclimate reconstructions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>few</b> millennia. For example, a tree ring cellulose δD records from pine trees in the White Mountains, California shows a 50‰ depletion from 6800 year ago to present. The cooling trend since the mid-Holocene thermal maximum is consistent with ice core and pollen records, but the corresponding magnitude of cooling is elusive due to complicated influences from local effects such as humidity and soil water composition. The meaning of isotopes in cellulose and its applications is still an area of active study.|$|E
25|$|The isotopic {{composition}} of ice cores from continental ice sheets and alpine glaciers {{have been developed}} as temperature proxies since the 1950s. Samuel Epstein {{was one of the}} first to demonstrate the applicability of this proxy by measuring oxygen isotopes in Antarctic snow, and also pointed out complications in the stable isotope-temperature correlation caused by the history of the air masses from which the snow formed. Ice cores in Greenland and Antarctica can be thousands of meters thick and record snow {{isotopic composition}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>few</b> glacial-interglacial cycles. Ice cores can be dated by layer counting on the top and ice flow modeling at depth, with additional age constraints from volcanic ash. Cores from Greenland and Antarctica can be aligned in age at high-resolution by comparing globally well-mixed trace gas (e.g. CH4) concentrations in the air bubbles trapped in the cores. Some of the first ice core records from Greenland and Antarctica with age estimates go back to the last 100,000 years, and showed a depletion in δD and δ18O in the last ice age. The ice core record has since been extended to the last 800,000 years in Antarctica, and at least 250,000 years in Greenland. One of the best δD-based ice core temperature records is from the Vostok ice core in Antarctica, which goes back to 420,000 years. The δD-temperature (of the inversion layer where snow forms) conversion in east Antarctica based on modern spatial gradient of δD (9‰/°C) is ΔTI=(ΔδDice-8Δδ18Osw)/9, which takes into account variations in seawater isotopic composition caused by global ice volume changes. It should be noted that many local effects can influence ice δD in addition to temperature. These effects include moisture origin and transport pathways, evaporation conditions and precipitation seasonality, which can be accounted for in more complicated models. Nevertheless, the Vostok ice core record shows some very important results: (1) A consistent δD depletion of ~70‰ during the last four glacial periods compared to interglacial times, corresponding to a cooling of 8°C in Antarctica; (2) A consistent drop of atmospheric CO2 concentration by 100 ppmv and CH4 drop by ~300 ppbv during glacial times relative to interglacials, suggesting a role of greenhouse gases in regulating global climate; (3) Antarctic air temperature and greenhouse gas concentration changes precede global ice volume and Greenland air temperature changes during glacial terminations, and greenhouse gases may be an amplifier of insolation forcing during glacial-interglacial cycles. Greenland ice core isotope records, in addition to showing glacial-interglacial cycles, also shows millennial-scale climate oscillations that may reflect reorganization in ocean circulation caused by ice melt charges. There have also been ice core records generated in alpine glacials on different continents. A record from the Andes Mountains in Peru shows a temperature decrease of 5-6°C in the tropics during the last ice age. A record from the Tibetan plateau shows a similar isotope shift and cooling during the last ice age. Other existing alpine glacial isotope records include Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, Mount Altai and West Belukha Plateau in Russia, Mount Logan in Canada, the Fremont Glacier in Wyoming, USA, and the Illimani Ice Core in Bolivia, most of which cover an interval of the Holocene epoch.|$|E

500|$|At the {{entrance}} to Ashera's chambers, the group encounters Sanaki's trusted adviser Sephiran, who bars the way to Ashera. Sephiran is revealed to be Lehran, a heron laguz of legend who in ages past aided Ashera in defeating Yune and sealed her within the Fire Emblem medallion. Lehran lost his powers when he mated with the first Empress of Begnion, but was through this act able to pass on his galdr and gift of clairvoyance to the females of his bloodline, the empresses of Begnion. Lehran freely admits during the ensuing confrontation {{that he was the}} cause of most of the major events <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>few</b> years. He inspired the Mad King Ashnard of Daein to start a war, encouraged conflict between Begnion and the Laguz Alliance, and allowed the atrocities of the Daein Liberation War to take place in an attempt to cause {{the end of the world}} by creating enough chaos to release the dark god. He did not foresee, however, the lengths to which heroes would go to save Tellius. Defeated in the ensuing battle, Lehran agrees to assist the champions in defeating Ashera if he is spared. In the final chamber, Yune pleads with Ashera to allow the world to go on. Ashera refuses, however, and engages the champions in battle. Ashera proves unable to be killed by mortal weapons, so Micaiah and Yune channel their collective energies into Ike's sword, allowing him to kill Ashera. After a tearful goodbye with Ike and Micaiah, Yune departs from the mortal world.|$|E

Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter said [...] "Burton has delivered a subversively witty, brilliantly cast, whimsically appointed dazzler that also manages to hit all the emotionally satisfying marks", while as well praising its computer-generated imagery (CGI), saying [...] "Ultimately, it's the visual landscape that makes Alice's newest adventure so wondrous, as technology has finally been able {{to catch up with}} Burton's endlessly fertile imagination." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly said, [...] "But Burton's Disneyfied 3-D Alice in Wonderland, written by the girl-power specialist Linda Woolverton, is a strange brew indeed: murky, diffuse, and meandering, set not in a Wonderland that pops with demented life but in a world called Underland that's like a joyless, bombed-out version of Wonderland. It looks like a CGI head trip gone post apocalyptic. In the film's rather humdrum 3-D, the place doesn't dazzle—it droops." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times awarded the film three out of four stars and wrote in his review that, [...] "Alice plays better as an adult hallucination, which is how Burton rather brilliantly interprets it until a pointless third act flies off the rails."

There are flaws in it and I suppose I might have a personal quibble but it's so long since I wrote it." [...] Of the film's ending, he wondered how {{it might have been}} had Kubrick directed the film: [...] "That is one of the 'ifs' of film history—at least the ending indicates Spielberg adding some sugar to Kubrick's wine. The actual ending is overly sympathetic and moreover rather overtly engineered by a plot device that does not really bear credence. But it's a brilliant piece of film and of course it's a phenomenon because it contains the energies and talents of two brilliant filmmakers." [...] Richard Corliss heavily praised Spielberg's direction, as well as the cast and visual effects. Roger Ebert gave the film four stars, saying that it was [...] "wonderful and maddening." [...] Leonard Maltin, on the other hand, gives the film two stars out of four in his Movie Guide, writing: [...] " [...] intriguing story draws us in, thanks in part to Osment's exceptional performance, but takes several wrong turns; ultimately, it just doesn't work. Spielberg rewrote the adaptation Stanley Kubrick commissioned of the Brian Aldiss short story 'Super Toys Last All Summer Long'; [...] result is a curious and uncomfortable hybrid of Kubrick and Spielberg sensibilities." [...] However, he calls John Williams' music score [...] "striking". Jonathan Rosenbaum compared A.I. to Solaris (1972), and praised both [...] "Kubrick for proposing that Spielberg direct the project and Spielberg for doing his utmost to respect Kubrick's intentions while making it a profoundly personal work." [...] Film critic Armond White, of the New York Press, praised the film noting that [...] "each part of David’s journey through carnal and sexual universes into the final eschatological devastation becomes as profoundly philosophical and contemplative as anything by cinema’s most thoughtful, speculative artists– Borzage, Ozu, Demy, Tarkovsky."
