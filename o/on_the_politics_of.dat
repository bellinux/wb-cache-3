5|$|His {{first major}} work, the poem London, {{contains}} {{an early version}} of Johnson's ethics and morality system. Within the poem, he combined attacks <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>politics</b> <b>of</b> Walpole and the British government with the immoral actions of the common Londoner to form a general satire of 18th-century London society. Johnson compares London to the Roman Empire in its decline and blames moral and political corruption for its fall. Although Johnson did not start his literary criticism career until later, London is an example of what Johnson thought poetry should be: it is youthful and joyous, but it also relies on simple language and easy to understand imagery.|$|E
5|$|Although Kirchner {{was known}} to have health problems, his death was unexpected, and had a great impact <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>politics</b> <b>of</b> Argentina. Kirchner died at an early age, while still being a highly {{influential}} figure in politics, despite not being president at the time. Presidents Manuel Quintana, Roque Sáenz Peña and Roberto María Ortiz died in office, {{but none of them}} had a political clout comparable to that of Kirchner. President Juan Perón had a similar power and died in office, but his death was not unexpected, as he had already reached the life expectancy of the time. Other figures of the history of Argentina who achieved great political clout, such as José de San Martín, Juan Manuel de Rosas, Julio Argentino Roca, Carlos Pellegrini and Hipólito Yrigoyen, all died when they were already retired from politics, or even abroad.|$|E

5|$|Born in Hingham, Massachusetts, Lincoln {{was educated}} at Harvard, and studied law with Joseph Hawley before {{establishing}} a law practice in Worcester, Massachusetts. He {{was active in}} local politics, and participated in the convention that drafted the Massachusetts Constitution in 1779. He supported Quock Walker, a former slave seeking confirmation of his freedom under that constitution in 1783. He entered national politics with his election to the United States House of Representatives in 1800, but was immediately tapped by Jefferson to become Attorney General. Lincoln served Jefferson as a consultant <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>politics</b> <b>of</b> New England, and was influential {{in the distribution of}} patronage in the region. He served on a commission that resolved claims emanating from the Yazoo land scandal in Georgia, and advised Jefferson on matters related to the Louisiana Purchase.|$|E
5|$|These events {{threatened}} Serbia, {{which had}} severed ties with Catholicism and {{was once again}} fully Orthodox. The marriage alliance between Vladislav and Ivan Asen II may {{be a result of}} the Hungarian threat to both of the rulers' countries. Some scholars have speculated that Vladislav accepted Bulgarian suzerainty, but this speculation has no evidence to support it, since no contemporary sources say that Vladislav recognized Asen as overlord of Serbia. However, Asen likely had the largest influence <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>politics</b> <b>of</b> Vladislav. Vladislav seems to have been left out of Orthodox alliance founded by Asen. Vladislav may have been afraid of close ties with Bulgaria, since his brother Radoslav's close ties with the Despotate of Epirus had caused dissatisfaction among the Serbian nobility. This shows that Vladislav was not too dependent upon Bulgaria, as he was not obliged to join the alliance; if he had recognized the suzerainty of Asen, he likely would have forced to join the alliance.|$|E

25|$|Two more adaptations {{followed}} in 1723. The first was Humfrey Duke of Gloucester by Ambrose Philips, which used about thirty lines from Acts 1–3 of 2 Henry VI and was performed at Drury Lane.

The second 1723 adaptation, also performed at Drury Lane, was Theophilus Cibber's King Henry VI: A Tragedy, which used Act 5 of 2 Henry VI and Acts 1 and 2 of 3 Henry VI, and which featured his father Colley Cibber as Winchester.|$|E

25|$|According to Béla Angyal, due to {{gerrymandering}} and disproportionate {{distribution of}} population between Bohemia and Slovakia the Hungarians had little {{representation in the}} National Assembly and thus their influence <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>politics</b> <b>of</b> Czechoslovakia remained limited. The same considerations have limited the Slovak intelligentsia's political power as well. On the other hand, Hungarians founded numerous parties including pro-Czechoslovak parties, founded parties with agrarian, social-democratic, Christian-socialist and other orientations, were active as sections of statewide Czechoslovak parties, had opportunities to participate in government and in 20's Hungarian members of parliament participated on adoption of several important laws with statewide impact.|$|E
25|$|The {{culture of}} Johor is {{influenced}} by visitors and traders throughout history.

The strong Arab influence is apparent in art performances like Zapin and Hamdolok, musical instruments like gambus. Other visible legacies in Johor Bahru are the Arabic names of places such as Wadi Hana and Wadi Hassan in areas populated by the Arab community from Hadhramaut in the southeast of Yemen. Wadi means valley in Arabic.|$|E

25|$|Qing China {{followed}} a Confucian-Modernist economic philosophy {{that called for}} strict government intervention in industry {{for the sake of}} preserving societal stability. While the Qing state was not explicitly anti-trade, a perceived lack of need for imports limited pressure on the government to open further ports to international trade. Qing China's rigid merchant hierarchy also blocked efforts to open ports to foreign ships and businesses. Chinese merchants away from the coast wanted to avoid market fluctuations caused by importing foreign goods that would compete with domestic production, while the Hong houses of Canton profited greatly by keeping their city the only entry point for foreign products. The Cohong was made up of between (depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>politics</b> <b>of</b> Canton) 6 to 10 merchant families. Most of the houses had been established by low-ranking mandarins, but several were Cantonese or Han in origin.|$|E
