50|$|A final type {{of model}} based on {{molecular}} properties of a solute is {{a branch of}} quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR). QSAR studies attempt to correlate biological activity of drugs, or a class of drugs, with structures. The normally accepted means of uptake for a drug, or its metabolite, is through partitioning into lipid bilayers. The descriptor most often used in QSAR to determine the hydrophobicity of a compound is the <b>octanol-water</b> <b>partition</b> <b>coefficient,</b> log P. MLC provides an attractive and practical alternative to QSAR. When micelles are added to a mobile phase, many similarities exist between the micellar mobile phase/stationary phase and the biological membrane/water interface. In MLC, the stationary phase become modified by the adsorption of surfactant monomers which are structurally similar to the membranous hydrocarbon chains in the biological model. Additionally, the hydrophilic/hydrophobic interactions of the micelles are {{similar to that in}} the polar regions of a membrane. Thus, the development of quantitative structure-retention relationships (QRAR) has become widespread.|$|E

40|$|Tannins {{can cause}} {{beneficial}} or harmful nutritional effects, but their great diversity has until now prevented a rational distinction between tannin structures and their nutritional responses. An attempt {{has been made}} to study this problem by examining the octanol-water solubilities of tannins. A relatively simple HPLC method has been developed for screening mixtures of plant tannins for their <b>octanol-water</b> <b>partition</b> <b>coefficients</b> (K-ow coefficients). Tannins were isolated from the fruits and leaves of different Acacia, Calliandra, Dichrostachys, and Piliostigma species, which are known to produce beneficial or harmful effects. The K-ow coefficients of these tannins ranged from 0. 061 to 13. 9, average coefficients of variation were 9. 2 % and recoveries were 107 %. Acacia nilotica fruits and leaves had the highest K-ow coefficients, that is, 2. 0 and 13. 9, respectively. These A. nilotica products also have high concentrations of tannins. The combined effects of high octanol solubilities and high tannin concentrations may explain their negative effects on animal nutrition and health. It is known that compounds with high octanol solubilities are more easily absorbed into tissues, and it is, therefore, proposed that such compounds are more likely to cause toxicity problems especially if consumed in large quantities. According to the literature, tannins in human foods tend to have low K-ow coefficients, and this was confirmed for the tannins in Piliostigma thonningii fruits. Therefore, unconventional feeds or browse products should be screened not only for their tannin concentrations but also for low <b>octanol-water</b> <b>partition</b> <b>coefficients</b> in order to identify nutritionally safe feeds and to avoid potentially toxic feeds...|$|R
