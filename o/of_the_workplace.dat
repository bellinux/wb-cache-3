50|$|Critics {{from within}} the Trotskyist {{tradition}} have sometimes argued that the Socialist Party misunderstands Trotsky's Transitional Programme. Since 'transitional demands' are an attempt to link today's struggles with the struggle for socialism, critics argue that Trotsky's transitional demand regarding the need for strike committees should be raised, and that the Socialist Party should argue for these strike committees to take control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>workplaces.</b> They argue that this is preferable to arguing for nationalisation since nationalisation does not show how workers would reach workers' control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>workplaces.</b>|$|R

The Fire Brigades enforce the regulations and conduct limited inspections to ensure employers are carrying out their responsibilities.|$|E
40|$|A {{field survey}} {{was carried out}} to {{evaluate}} lighting conditions of visual display terminal (VDT) workplaces. Measurements were made concerning direct and reflected glare at 834 workplaces, illuminance of work surfaces and luminance characteristics of VDT screens at 659 <b>workplaces.</b> <b>The</b> results indicated that direct glare was present at 18. 9 %, and reflected glare at 32. 1 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>workplaces</b> surveyed. <b>The</b> illumination levels <b>of</b> work surfaces were between 300 and 1, 000 lx for keyboards or documents and below 500 lx for screens at 62 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>workplaces.</b> Insufficient illumination level as low as 300 lx on a keyboard or document were founded at 19. 3 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>workplaces.</b> Correlation analysis <b>of</b> illumination levels revealed that a keyboard illuminance above 750 lx resulted in an excessive vertical illuminance on screen above 5 OO lx. Most screens (73. 8 %) showed a character-background luminance ratio ranging from 3 to 15. Only 13. 8 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> screens surveyed were, however, above 10 cd/㎡ as to the background luminance. <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> survey suggested that <b>the</b> narrow space <b>of</b> VDT workrooms was responsible for these inadequate lighting conditions {{which could lead to}} visual fatigue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> operators...|$|R

25|$|Glass doors {{pose the}} risk of unintentional {{collision}} if a person believes the door to be open when it is closed, or is unaware there is a door at all. This risk may be particularly pronounced with sliding glass doors because they often have large single panes which are hard to see. To prevent injury from glass doors, stickers or other types of warnings are sometimes placed on the glass surface {{to make it more}} visible. For instance, in the UK, Regulation 14 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Workplace</b> (Health and Safety Regulations) 1992 requires the marking of windows and glass doors to make them conspicuous. Australian Standards: AS1288 and AS2208 require glass doors to be made from laminated or toughened glass.|$|E
25|$|On February 2, 1948, President Truman {{sent the}} first {{comprehensive}} civil rights bill to Congress. It incorporated many of the 35 recommendations of his commission. In July 1948, over the objection of senior military officers, Truman issued Executive Order 9981, banning racial discrimination in the U.S. Armed Forces, and Executive Order 9980 to integrate the federal government. (Facilities had been segregated under President Woodrow Wilson). This {{was in response to}} a number of incidents against black veterans, most notably the Woodard case. The armed forces and federal agencies led the way in United States for integration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>workplace,</b> public facilities and schools. Over the decades, the decision meant that both institutions benefited from the contributions of minorities.|$|E
25|$|Dwight often {{speaks in}} a halting, intense manner, even in casual conversations. At the office, his most {{recurring}} formal wear is a mustard-colored, short-sleeved collar shirt, with a dark necktie and, usually, a brown suit jacket. He often uses one-upmanship to better himself over his peers, such as boasting about how he trains specific parts of his body. Dwight will sometimes engage in jokes and games in attempts to appease Michael, but often fails to do so, because of Michael's perception of himself as the jokester <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>workplace.</b> After Dwight temporarily leaves Dunder Mifflin, it is shown that he had long been watering the office plant and arranging the toys on Michael's desk {{in a manner that}} made Michael happy, unbeknownst to Michael.|$|E

25|$|The {{study showed}} that the three models of full face masks had a {{significant}} leakage of unfiltered air through the gaps between the mask and the face. The minimum values <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>workplace</b> protection factors (WPF) {{of each of the}} three negative pressure full face mask models were 11, 17 and 26. The maximum value of the WPF from one of the models did not exceed 500 no times at all. And for all results together, the WPF was not more than 100 in ~ 30% of the measurements. So, for this reason, the values of the APFs for this RPD type in Germany (400), Finland (500), Italy (400), and Sweden (500), may not fully take into account the lower this type respirators' performance at the workplace compared to the performance in the laboratory (during certification). The same was true for other RPD types and their APF.|$|E
25|$|Rebellion and {{rejection}} are also expressed themes in this story. Bartleby refuses {{to conform to}} the normal ways of the people around him and instead, simply just doesn't complete his tasks requested by his boss. He does not make any request for changes in the workplace, but just continues to be passive to the work happening around him. Just as public rejects changes from a normal routine, this rebellious style by Bartleby causes his co-workers to reject him as he is not behaving the same {{as the rest of the}} work place environment. The narrator tries multiple tactics to get Bartleby {{to conform to the}} standards <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>workplace,</b> and ultimately realizes that Bartleby's mental state is not that of normal society. Although the narrator sees Bartleby as a harmless person, the narrator refuses to engage in the same peculiar rhythm that Bartleby is stuck in.|$|E

40|$|First {{recognised}} {{and named}} by feminist {{activists in the}} 1970 s, sexual harassment {{continues to be a}} critical issue for women in <b>the</b> <b>workplace.</b> Feminists took women's experiences seriously enough to uncover the problem, conceptualise it and pursue it legally. In New Zealand unions lobbied for an effective law to make sexual harassment unlawful and as a result provisions were included in the Labour Relations Act 1987. These provisions have been retained with amendments in the Employment Contracts Act 1991 and the Employment Relations Act 2000. This study investigates the sexual harassment policies and procedures of a sample group of public and private <b>workplaces</b> with <b>the</b> purpose <b>of</b> gaining an insight into whether there are adequate policies to protect women from sexual harassment in <b>the</b> New Zealand <b>workplace.</b> A survey method was used to collect the data and a feminist framework was employed to analyse the survey results. The study found that only three <b>of</b> <b>the</b> twelve <b>workplaces</b> surveyed had what could be considered adequate policies. Six <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surveyed <b>workplaces</b> had no policies or procedures at all and a further three had policies but did not communicate them to their staff. Furthermore it was found that in some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>workplaces</b> where there were policies in place, survey respondents made unsolicited reports <b>of</b> sexual harassment. <b>The</b> conclusion was reached that although there were adequate policies in one quarter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>workplaces</b> surveyed this could barely be considered adequate overall to protect women from sexual harassment. Having policies in place is critical and should be made a legal imperative, but implementing the policies and procedures and monitoring their effectiveness is the key factor in preventing sexual harassment in <b>the</b> <b>workplace...</b>|$|R
