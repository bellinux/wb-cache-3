5|$|A {{somewhat}} controversial recent {{addition to}} Caversham was the opening, in October 2013, of Whakamana Cannabis Museum, New Zealand's first museum {{dedicated to the}} history of cannabis use. Cannabis, while still a criminalised drug in New Zealand, has moved some way towards grudging acceptance, at least as a subject for <b>open</b> <b>discussion.</b> The museum, run from a former residential house in David Street, is designed to be an information centre on aspects of the history and legislation surrounding the drug, and also a national centre for the Aotearoa Legalise Cannabis Party, a minor single-issue political party.|$|E
5|$|The Redskins {{controversy}} began receiving {{more attention}} in 2013, {{starting with a}} symposium in February on the topic at the Smithsonian's National Museum of the American Indian in Washington, D.C. Subsequently, the Oneida Indian Nation of New York sponsored a series of radio ads in each city to coincide with games of the 2013 season, each featuring a targeted message. A broader range of persons spoke in favor of change or <b>open</b> <b>discussion,</b> including local government leaders, members of Congress, and President Barack Obama. Statements {{in support of a}} name change by civil rights and religious organizations were added to those that Native American groups have been making for decades.|$|E
5|$|During Grant's {{presidency}} {{the early}} Women's suffrage movement led by Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton gained national attention. Anthony lobbied for female suffrage, equal gender pay, {{and protection of}} property for women who resided in Washington D.C. In April 1869, Grant signed into law the protection of married women's property from their husbands' debts and the ability for women to sue in court in Washington D.C. In March 1870 Representative Samuel M. Arnell introduced a bill, coauthored by suffragist Bennette Lockwood, that would give women federal workers equal pay for equal work. Two years later Grant signed a modified Senate version of the Arnell Bill into law. The law required that all federal female clerks would be paid the fully compensated salary, however, lower tiered female clerks were exempted. The law increased women's clerk salaries from 4% to 20% during the 1870s, however, the culture of patronage and patriarchy continued. The Republicans, who needed women to campaign for Grant in the 1872 Presidential Election, added to their platform <b>open</b> <b>discussion</b> of women's rights.|$|E

5|$|The CPC is, officially, {{organized}} on {{the basis}} of democratic centralism, a principle conceived by Russian Marxist theoretician Vladimir Lenin which entails democratic and <b>open</b> <b>discussion</b> on policy on the condition of unity in upholding the agreed upon policies. The highest body of the CPC is the National Congress, convened every fifth year. When the National Congress is not in session, the Central Committee is the highest body, but since the body meets normally only once a year, most duties and responsibilities are vested in the Politburo and its Standing Committee. The party's leader holds the offices of General Secretary (responsible for civilian party duties), Chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC) (responsible for military affairs) and State President (a largely ceremonial position). Through these posts the party leader is the country's paramount leader. The current paramount leader is Xi Jinping who was elected at the 19th National Congress held in October 2017.|$|E

25|$|Psychoanalysis {{comprises}} {{a method}} of investigating the mind and interpreting experience; a systematized set of theories about human behavior; and a form of psychotherapy to treat psychological or emotional distress, especially conflict originating in the unconscious mind. This school of thought originated in the 1890s with Austrian medical doctors including Josef Breuer (physician), Alfred Adler (physician), Otto Rank (psychoanalyst), and most prominently Sigmund Freud (neurologist). Freud's psychoanalytic theory was largely based on interpretive methods, introspection and clinical observations. It became very well known, largely because it tackled subjects such as sexuality, repression, and the unconscious. These subjects were largely taboo at the time, and Freud provided a catalyst for their <b>open</b> <b>discussion</b> in polite society. Clinically, Freud helped to pioneer the method of free association and a therapeutic interest in dream interpretation.|$|E
25|$|The final showdown, the Hama massacre, {{took place}} in February 1982 when the {{government}} crushed the uprising. Helicopter gunships, bulldozers and artillery bombardment razed the city, killing thousands of people. The Ba'ath government withstood the uprising not because of popular support, but because the opposition was disorganised and had little urban support. Throughout the uprising, the Sunni middle class continued to support the Ba'ath Party because of its dislike of political Islam. After the uprising the government resumed its version of militaristic Leninism, reverting the liberalization introduced when Assad came to power. The Ba'ath Party was weakened by the uprising; democratic elections for delegates to the Regional and National Congresses were halted, and <b>open</b> <b>discussion</b> within the party ended. The uprising made Syria more totalitarian than ever, and strengthened Assad's position as undisputed leader of Syria.|$|E

25|$|In 1629 {{the city}} {{suffered}} its worse flooding in recorded history. The Río Aculhuacán broke through its dikes, flooding {{the entire city}} from 1 to 2 meters deep. Transportation was by canoe, and many families left the city permanently. The rains continued, and the flood waters did not recede. Probably 30,000 persons died, and it was feared that the capital might disappear completely. Parts of the city remained flooded for four years. On May 19, 1630, the viceroy ordered the capital moved to Tacubaya, nearby but on higher ground, pending an <b>open</b> <b>discussion</b> in the guilds of the city. The guilds were opposed, resolving instead to restart the engineering works. By {{the end of the}} year, the engineer Enrico Martínez had restarted the work. By 1632 the Huehuetoca canal had finally been completed and the Calzada de San Cristóbal, atop a wall surrounding the city that served as a dike, had been renovated.|$|E

500|$|After {{recovering}} from his wounds in 1945, Beynar {{decided to leave}} the resistance, and instead began publishing in an independent Catholic weekly Tygodnik Powszechny. It was then that he took the pen-name Jasienica (from the name of the place where he had received treatment for his injuries) in order not to endanger his wife, who was still living in Soviet-controlled Vilnius, Lithuania. Soon he {{became a member of the}} weekly's staff and then an editor. In 1948 he was arrested by the Polish secret police (...) but after several weeks was released after the intervention of Bolesław Piasecki from the PAX Association. In gratitude to Piasecki, therefater he worked with PAX, leaving Tygodnik Powszechny for PAX in 1950. In 1950, he became a director of the Polish Caritas charity. Jasienica became a member of the Klub Krzywego Koła (Curved Circle Club), which espoused free speech and <b>open</b> <b>discussion.</b> His essays were published in Dziś i Jutro, Słowo Powszechne, Życie Warszawy, Po Prostu.
