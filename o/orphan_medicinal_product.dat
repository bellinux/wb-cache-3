40|$|Rare diseases, which affect {{less than}} 5 persons in 10, 000, {{have become a}} public health {{priority}} in Belgium and the European Union (EU). Towards the end of 1999, the European Parliament and Council of EU published the regulation (EC) No 141 / 2000 on <b>orphan</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of rare diseases. This regulation allows pharmaceutical companies to benefit from different incentives from the EU to develop these orphan drugs, which are considered as having little or no profitability for manufacturers, given the low number of patients concerned. Since 2000, 1, 586 applications to receive the orphan designation have been submitted, of which 98. 5 % were granted. Among the 1, 563 granted designations, more than one-third were granted for rare tumors (37. 4 %, n= 584 / 1563), and one-quarter for rare endocrine, nutritional, or metabolic diseases (16. 1 %, n= 251 / 1563). All in all, 96 different orphan drugs have received a marketing authorisation since 2000, half of them between 2011 and October 2015, illustrating the boom {{in the development of}} <b>orphan</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> However, the high costs associated with these products pose new challenges for our health system’s sustainability.

The <b>Orphan</b> <b>Medicinal</b> <b>Product</b> Regulation of 1999 was the first European legislative text concerning rare diseases, followed by many initiatives, including recommendations by the Council of Ministers of the European Union in 2009.

40|$|Abstract Background Off-label use of (<b>orphan)</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> for (rare) {{diseases}} {{is quite}} common but not underpinned by clinical studies to confirm efficacy and safety. No risk-analyses by regulatory agencies are carried out. The objective {{of this study was}} to map off-label use of <b>orphan</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> in Belgium in terms of attitude towards off-label prescribing, factors influencing off-label prescribing, disclosure of information towards the patient, reporting of off-label use, risks and consequences. Most of the EMA authorized orphan drugs are fully reimbursed in Belgium under well-defined circumstances. Moreover, a “Special Solidarity Fund” takes care of some specific cases eventually prescribed off-label. Methods Semi-structured interviews with seven physicians with expertise in the treatment with and six experts in the reimbursement of <b>orphan</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> in Belgium. This task was performed by five last-year pharmacy students after having studied profoundly the medical literature around off-label prescribing. They had no previous contact with the participants. Results Most participants do agree with the off-label use if the <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> is quite safe and well-tolerated, if the on-label indication is rather general and when all other options have failed in some specific, evidence-based indications, especially in children. Before starting off-label use, the patient/family needs to be fully and clearly informed. The treatment is not reimbursed but sometimes sponsored by the company or by charity funds. Reporting of the outcome is necessary to avoid losing valuable information. The prescriber is responsible and can be held accountable. Conclusions While there is support from physicians and reimbursement experts, there is also concern in case of off-label use, mainly for reasons of patient safety especially when <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> are prescribed off-label in the absence of medical or scientific justification and driven by cost-containment motives...|$|R

40|$|On 11 th March 2010, the European Commission {{issued a}} {{marketing}} authorization valid throughout the European Union for Revolade {{for the treatment}} of adult chronic immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura. Revolade is an <b>orphan</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> indicated for splenectomized patients with immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura who are refractory to other treatments (e. g. corticosteroids, immunoglobulins) and as second-line treatment for non-splenectomized patients where surgery is contraindicated. The active substance of Revolade is eltrombopag (ATC code B 02 BX 05). Eltrombopag increases platelet production through activation of the thrombopoietin receptor. The recommended oral dose is 50 mg once daily to achieve and maintain a platelet count of the 50 × 109 /L or more necessary to reduce or prevent the risk of bleeding. The benefit of Revolade is a durable response in maintaining platelet levels. The most common side effects include headache, nausea, hepatobiliary toxicity, diarrhea, fatigue, paresthesia, constipation, rash, pruritus, cataract, arthralgia and myalgia.

40|$|Abstract Background We {{determined}} {{whether the}} market exclusivity incentive of the European Orphan Drug Regulation {{results in a}} market monopoly or that absence of another <b>Orphan</b> <b>Medicinal</b> <b>Product</b> (OMP) for the same rare disorder, a so-called follow-on OMP, {{is a matter of}} time or market size. In the interest of rare disorder patients better understanding of the effect of the market exclusivity incentive on follow-on OMP development is warranted. Methods First, the impact of various market-, product- and disease-related characteristics on follow-on OMP development in the EU was determined by comparing rare disorders with an approved OMP and at least one follow-on OMP (N = 26), with rare disorders with an approved OMP and no follow-on OMP (N = 18). Next, we determined whether manufacturers continued development of a follow-on OMP upon approval of the first OMP for the intended rare disorder. Since in the EU significant benefit of an OMP has to be established, we determined for each follow-on OMP for which development was continued on what grounds significant benefit was assumed by the sponsor. Data were collected from the public domain only. Results The likelihood of a rare disorder with an approved OMP to obtain at least one follow-on OMP development was strongly associated with disease prevalence, turnover of the first OMP, disease class, disease-specific scientific output and age of onset. Out of a total of 120 follow-on OMPs only one follow-on OMP could be identified for which development was discontinued upon approval of the first OMP for the same rare disorder. Only a substantial level of discontinuation of follow-on OMP development would have indicated the existence of a market monopoly. Moreover, sponsors that continued development of a follow-on OMP predominantly assumed that their product had an improved efficacy compared to the first approved OMP. Conclusions This study provides evidence that absence of follow-on OMP development is a matter of time or market size, rather than that the market exclusivity incentive of the European Orphan Drug Regulation creates a market monopoly. </p...|$|E
40|$|Midostaurin {{is a new}} orally {{administered}} multi-target receptor {{tyrosine kinase}} inhibitor {{for the treatment of}} Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML). It was designated as an <b>orphan</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> in 2004. Marketing authorisation was granted for midostaurin on 18 th September 2017. The assessment of clinical effectiveness was based on three studies: The RATIFY trial, the IIT-trial and the UK NCRI AML 17 trial. RATIFY was a randomised phase III study of induction (daunorubicin/cytarabine) and consolidation (high-dose cytarabine) chemotherapy combined with midostaurin or placebo in treatment-naive patients with FLT 3 -mutated AML. In total, 717 patients aged 18 – 60 years were included in the full analysis set of the trial. This was the most important study to this assessment and is the pivotal trial of midostaurin in this indication. Midostaurin in combination with standard induction and consolidation chemotherapy improved overall survival (OS) in patients aged 18 – 60 years who were fit for chemotherapy. In the RATIFY trial, the risk of death was reduced by 23 % during the follow-up for the midostaurin versus placebo groups. The proportion of patients alive in the midostaurin and placebo treatment arms were: 1 year – 76 % versus 68 %; 5 years – 51 % versus 43 %. However, because of a plateau effect in the OS curves, the absolute OS gain was difficult to determine reliably. Overall, key secondary outcomes support the conclusions based on the primary outcome (OS). No data on the health-related quality of life or disease-specific quality of life were available. Based on the indirect comparison of midostaurin in combination with standard induction (" 7 + 3 regimen") and consolidation chemotherapy versus high-dose (90 mg/m 2) daunorubicin induction (" 10 + 3 regimen") and consolidation chemotherapy, {{there was no evidence that}} midostaurin treatment was more beneficial than high-dose daunorubicin used during induction, or vice versa. However, serious limitations apply to this indirect comparison...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{encourage}} {{the development of}} drugs for rare diseases, orphan drug legislation has been introduced in the USA (1983) and in the EU (2000). Recent literature discusses factors that may influence {{the development of new}} <b>orphan</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> in the EU. This study aims to identify predictors for successful marketing authorisation of potential orphan drugs in the EU. Methods: A comparison between randomly selected authorised and a matched sample of not-yet-authorised orphan drug designations has been performed. Determinants in the study included characteristics of the indication, of the product and of the sponsor. Data were collected from the public domain only. Results: Orphan drug approval was strongly associated with previous experience of the sponsor in obtaining approval for another orphan drug (OR= 17. 3, 95 % CI= 5. 6 - 53. 1). Furthermore, existing synthetic entities compared to biotechnology products tended to have a higher likelihood of reaching approval status (OR= 3. 9, 95 % CI= 0. 9 - 16. 6). Conclusion: This study showed that experience of a company in developing orphan drugs is an important predictor for subsequent authorisation of other orphan drugs. The same applies for existing (synthetic) molecules, for which much knowledge is available. Further research should be directed towards studying the quality of the clinical development program of those designated <b>orphan</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> not reaching approval status...|$|R

40|$|An {{orphan drug}} is a {{medicinal}} product {{intended for the}} treatment of a rare disease that affects {{only a small number of}} patients, e. g., five in ten thousand. According to the current European orphan drug legislation, the European Union shall not, for a period of ten years, accept another <b>orphan</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> for the same therapeutic indication, in respect of a similar medicinal product. Thus far, the European Medicines Agency has used human judgments of similarity when assessing new medicines for rare diseases. The project reported here seeks to develop quantitative methods for this purpose. The project began with an analysis of the correlation between human and computed judgments of similarity for 100 pairs of molecules chosen from the Drug Bank 3. 0 database. The human similarity assessments for these pairs of molecules were obtained from a total of 143 experts from Europe, Asia and the US, with the experts being asked to state whether each pair was, or was not, similar. The percentage of the experts judging a pair to be similar was then compared to the Tanimoto coefficient computed using a range of different types of descriptors (1 D, 2 D and 3 D), with the aim of identifying those descriptors that correlated most closely with the human judgments. The following types of fingerprint were studied: ECFP 4, ECFC 4, Daylight, Unity, BCI, MDL as implemented in the Pipeline Pilot system; and CDK Extended, CDK Standard, Estate, PubChem, MACCS, Morgan, Feat Morgan, Atom Pair, Torsion, RDKit, Avalon, Layers, FP:TGD and FP:TGT as implemented in the KNIME system. The 3 D fingerprints studied were the following: FP:TAD and FP:TAT as implemented in the KNIME protocol. 1 D molecular property descriptors were also studied but these proved to be of only limited effectiveness for this application. Logistic regression models were developed for each type of descriptor, relating the Tanimoto similarity for a pair of molecules computed with the probability of the human experts regarding that pair as being similar. The resulting regression models were then validated using a separate test-set containing 100 pairs of molecules that had previously been evaluated by the European Medicines Agency in the context of the authorisation of medicines for rare diseases. The best models were able to reproduce over 95...|$|E

This raises an important question: What impact does the EU marketing authorisation of an OMP have on related research? This article establishes that the key orphan incentive, namely the 10 -year market exclusivity provision laid down in Article 8 of the EU Regulation on OMPs (Regulation 141 / 2000), has a huge potential impact on related research. It is argued that this provision can make it too difficult for researchers/sponsors to attain marketing approval for closely related products. This article advances two proposals to address this problem. First, it argues for new principles for assessing similarity, so as to clarify and narrow the ambit of market exclusivity. Secondly, it argues for improved conditions for a demonstration of ‘clinical superiority’ for similar OMPs...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{growth in}} {{expenditure}} on <b>orphan</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> (OMP) across Europe {{has been identified}} as a concern. Estimates of future expenditure in Europe have suggested that OMPs could account for a significant proportion of total pharmaceutical expenditure in some countries, but few of these forecasts have been well validated. This analysis aims to establish a robust forecast of the future budget impact of OMPs on the healthcare systems in Sweden and France. Methods: A dynamic forecasting model was created to estimate the budget impact of OMPs in Sweden and France between 2013 and 2020. The model used historical data on OMP designation and approval rates to predict the number of new OMPs coming to the market. Average OMP sales were estimated for each year post-launch by regression analysis of historical sales data. Total forecast sales were compared with expected sales of all pharmaceuticals in each country to quantify the relative budget impact.

40|$|International audienceThe list of rare {{inherited}} disorders with renal {{involvement is}} rapidly growing. Many are single gene diseases affecting children, but cases are {{not restricted to}} pediatrics and diagnosis is often difficult and delayed. The expanding use of next-generation sequencing techniques is expected to discover new diseases, to challenge the definition of rarity, to accelerate and shake up our diagnostic paradigms, to promote 'deep phenotyping', and ultimately improve disease ontology. Rare renal diseases are exemplary of a transition from pediatric to adult-type care and pluridisciplinary approach, necessitating cooperation between geneticists, nephropediatricians, adult nephrologists, other physicians, nurses, social workers, and dietitians. They have raised new ethical issues, not only in genetic counseling, but also in public health, regarding equity, and distribution of care. Patient's organizations have grown and have been very active to promote information and research. Efforts are underway to create interoperable patient's registries and ultimately worldwide networks gathering patients, researchers, clinicians, pharmaceutical industry, and health authorities.

40|$|Background/Objective: <b>Orphan</b> {{drugs are}} <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> which treat {{life-threatening}} or chronically debilitating diseases which affect small patient populations. So far {{there is a}} substantial knowledge gap on actual expenditure on orphan drugs in Serbia. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} provide insight into the expenditure trends of orphan drugs in Serbia. Material and methods: Annual reports on turnover and the consumption of pharmaceuticals in Serbia published by Medicines and Medical Devices Agency of Serbia (ALIMS) for the period 2006 - 2013 were used to extract data on expenditure on orphan drugs. Drugs were eligible for inclusion in the analysis if they had active European orphan designation and European marketing authorization during the period covered by the study (2006 - 2013). Data were analysed across time series. Simple descriptive analysis and observation of chronological trends were applied. Results: Data for annual expenditure on 12 different orphan drugs were available in the analysed reports. Orphan drug expenditure and share of orphan drug expenditure in total drug expenditure increased constantly from 2006 to 2010. Both began to slightly decrease over the next two years (2011 - 2012), and then suddenly declined nearly threefold in 2013. Share of orphan drug expenditure didn't exceed 1 % of total drug expenditure over a period of eight years. The highest share of expenditure on orphan drugs was attributed to imatinib (87. 36 %- 97. 13 %), so abrupt decline in 2013 could be explained by its withdrawal from European Community Register of <b>Orphan</b> <b>Medicinal</b> <b>Products</b> in 2012. Conclusions: Expenditure on orphan drugs in Serbia from 2006 to 2013 was considerably low compared to total expenditure on drugs. In the last available year we noted substantial decline of orphan drug expenditure, mainly because of imatinib losing its orphan designation.

Results The new programmes in England and Scotland recognise the challenges identified in demonstrating the value of ultra-OMPs (and OMPs) and that they require a different process to standard HTA approaches. Wider considerations of disease and treatment experiences from a multi-stakeholder standpoint are needed, combined with other measures to deal with uncertainty (e. g. managed entry agreements). While approaches to assessing this new view of value of OMPs, extending beyond cost/QALY frameworks, differ, their criteria are similar. These are complemented by a European initiative that fosters multi-stakeholder dialogue and consensus about value determinants throughout the life-cycle of an OMP. Conclusion New HTA programmes specific to OMPs have been developed but questions remain about whether they sufficiently capture value and manage uncertainty in clinical practice...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Authorization of <b>orphan</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> (OMPs) {{is often}} based on studies with several methodological shortcomings. Hence, data are {{difficult}} to interpret and efficacy does not always correspond to real-world effectiveness. We investigated to what extent an efficacy-effectiveness gap exists for OMPs for metabolic diseases {{and set out to}} explore which factors contribute to it. Methods We included all OMPs for rare metabolic diseases authorized in the EU up to 1 January 2016. Efficacy data were obtained from European Public Assessment Reports, relative effectiveness data from the Dutch National Healthcare Institute website, and real-world effectiveness data from literature and interviews with experts and patients. Efficacy and effectiveness were scored as 'no effect', 'unclear' or 'good' based upon a prespecified scoring system. Results We identified 31 authorized OMPs, of which 21 had post-marketing studies available, thus making it possible to score real-world effectiveness. Eight of 21 (38 %) OMPs had a 'good' real-world effectiveness. The use of a clinical or validated surrogate primary endpoint and a representative study population seemed to be related to good effectiveness in the real world, as were type of marketing authorization, study population and disease prevalence. Conclusions This study revealed that {{less than half of the}} authorized OMPs are effective in the real world. Since the type of primary endpoint used in the pivotal study seems to be associated with good real-world effectiveness, it is important to agree upon study endpoints through early dialogues among relevant stakeholder...|$|R
40|$|Health Technology Assessment (HTA) {{often results}} in {{different}} coverage recommendations across countries for a same medicine despite similar methodological approaches. This paper develops and pilots a methodological framework that systematically identifies the reasons for these differences using an exploratory sequential mixed methods research design. The study countries were England, Scotland, Sweden and France. The methodological framework was built around three stages of the HTA process: (a) evidence, (b) its interpretation, and (c) its influence on the final recommendation; and was applied to two <b>orphan</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> The criteria accounted for at each stage were qualitatively analyzed through thematic analysis. Piloting the framework for two medicines, eight trials, 43 clinical endpoints and seven economic models were coded 155 times. Eighteen different uncertainties about this evidence were coded 28 times, 56 % of which pertained to evidence commonly appraised and 44 % to evidence considered by only some agencies. The poor agreement in interpreting this evidence (κ =  0. 183) was partly explained by stakeholder input (ns =  48 times), or by agency-specific risk (nu =  28 uncertainties) and value preferences (noc =  62 “other considerations”), derived through correspondence analysis. Accounting for variability at each stage of the process {{can be achieved by}} codifying its existence and quantifying its impact through the application of this framework. The transferability of this framework to other disease areas, medicines and countries is ensured by its iterative and flexible nature, and detailed description...|$|R
