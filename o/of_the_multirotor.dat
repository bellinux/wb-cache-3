The layout of TX Multirotor is a large cross, and each arm of the large cross is a smaller cross. There are four rotors installed on each arm of the large cross, with two rotors on the tips of the shorter arm of the small cross. The remaining two rotors is mounted on longer arm of the smaller cross, with one {{on each side of the}} shorter arm, one of them halfway between the shorter arm and the tip of the longer arm, and the other halfway between the shorter arm and the base of the longer arm that is attached to the center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>multirotor.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes an {{image-based}} robust hovering controller for multirotor micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) in GPS-denied environments. The proposed controller is robust {{against the}} effects of multiple uncertainties in angular dynamics of vehicle which contain external disturbances, nonlinear dynamics, coupling, and parametric uncertainties. Based on visual features extracted from the image, the proposed controller is capable of controlling the pose (position and orientation) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>multirotor</b> relative to the fixed-target. The proposed controller scheme consists of two parts: a spherical image-based visual servoing (IBVS) and a robust flight controller for velocity and attitude control loops. A robust compensator based on a second order robust filter is utilized in the robust flight control design to improve the robustness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>multirotor</b> when subject to multiple uncertainties. Compared to other methods, the proposed method is robust against multiple uncertainties and {{does not need to}} keep the features in the field of view.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the controllability analysis {{problem for a}} class of multirotor systems subject to rotor failure/wear. It is shown that classical controllability theories of linear systems are not sufficient to test <b>the</b> controllability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> considered <b>multirotors.</b> Owing to this, an easy-to-use measurement index is introduced to assess the available control authority. Based on it, a new necessary and sufficient condition for <b>the</b> controllability <b>of</b> <b>multirotors</b> is derived. Furthermore, a controllability test procedure is approached. The proposed controllability test method is applied to a class of hexacopters with different rotor configurations and different rotor efficiency parameters to show its effectiveness. The analysis results show that hexacopters with different rotor configurations have different fault-tolerant capabilities. It is therefore necessary to test <b>the</b> controllability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>multirotors</b> before any fault-tolerant control strategies are employed. Comment: 21 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is to explore the {{feasibility}} of a multirotor controller system which can dynamically change the arm configuration of a multirotor. Currently most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>multirotor</b> systems have to be powered down, rewired, and programmed with new firmware, to configure how many arms/motors they use to fly.

We believe that this will make a multirotor more fault tolerant and adaptive.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose an {{effective}} vision-based navigation method that allows a multirotor vehicle to simultaneously reach a desired goal pose in the environment while constantly facing a target object or landmark.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} <b>the</b> question <b>of</b> designing {{robust and}} flexible controllers to enable autonomous {{operation of a}} multirotor UAV with an attached slung load for general cargo transport. This is achieved by following an experimental approach; real flight data from a slung load multirotor coupled system is used as experience, allowing for a computer software to estimate <b>the</b> pose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slung in order to propose a swing-free controller that will dampen <b>the</b> oscillations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slung load when <b>the</b> <b>multirotor</b> is following a desired flight trajectory. The thesis presents the reader with a methodology describing the development path from vehicle design and modelling over slung load state estimators to controller synthesis. Attaching a load via a cable to <b>the</b> underside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aircraft alters <b>the</b> mass distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> combined "airborne entity" in a highly dynamic fashion. The load {{will be subject to}} inertial, gravitational and unsteady aerodynamic forces which are transmitted to the aircraft via the cable, providing another source of external force to <b>the</b> <b>multirotor</b> platform and thus altering the flight dynamic response characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vehicle.

40|$|Abstract — <b>The</b> <b>multirotor</b> {{unmanned}} aerial vehicles (UAVs) {{are experiencing}} a currently growing interest {{due to their}} high maneuverability, simplified mechanics and vertical takeoff and landing capability.

40|$|Objective of {{this thesis}} is to {{describe}} the design and realisation phases of a multirotor {{to be used for}} low risk and cost aerial observation. Starting point of this activity was a wide literature study related to the technological evolution of multirotors design and to the state of the art. Firstly the most common multirotor configurations were defined and, according to a size and performance based evaluation, the most suitable one was chosen. A detailed computer aided design model was drawn as basis for the realisation of two prototypes. The realised multirotors were "X-shaped" octorotors with eight coaxially coupled motors. The mathematical model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>multirotor</b> dynamics was studied. "Proportional Integral Derivative" and "Linear Quadratic" algorithms were chosen as techniques to regulate the attitude dynamics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>multirotor.</b> These methods were tested with a nonlinear model simulation developed in the Matlab Simulink environment. In the meanwhile the Arduino board was selected as the best compromise between costs and performance and the above mentioned algorithms were implemented using this platform thanks to its main characteristic of being completely "open source". Indeed the multirotor was conceived to be a serviceable tool for the public utility and, at the same time, to be an accessible device for research and studies. The behaviour of the physical multirotor was evaluated with a test bench designed to isolate the rotation about one single body axis at a time. The data of the experimental tests were gathered in real time using a custom Matlab code and several indoor tests allowed the "fine tuning" of the controllers gains. Afterwards a portable "ground station" was conceived and realised in adherence with the real scenarios users needs. Several outdoor experimental flights were executed with successful results and the data gathered during the outdoor tests were used to evaluate some key performance indicators as the endurance and the maximum allowable payload mass. Then the fault tolerance of the control system was evaluated simulating and experimenting the loss of one motor; even in this critical condition the system exhibited an acceptable behaviour. The reached project readiness allowed to meet some potential users as the "Turin Fire Department" and to cooperate with them in a simulated emergency. During this event the multirotor was used to gather and transmit real time aerial images for an improved "situation awareness". Finally the study was extended to more innovative control techniques like the neural networks based ones. Simulations results demonstrated their effectiveness; nevertheless the inherent complexity and the unreliability outside the training ranges could have a catastrophic impact on the airworthiness. This is a factor that cannot be neglected especially in the applications related to flying platforms. Summarising, this research work was addressed mainly to the operating procedures for implementing automatic control algorithms to real platforms. All the design aspects, from the preliminary multirotor configuration choice to the tests in possible real scenarios, were covered obtaining performances comparable with other commercial of-the-shelf platform...|$|E

We {{have used the}} miniaturized multispectral sensor Tetracam Micro Multiple Camera Array (μ-MCA) Snap 6 with <b>the</b> <b>multirotor</b> imaging platform to get multispectral imagery with high spatial resolution. The study area {{is located in the}} Sumava Mountains, Central Europe, heavily affected by windstorms, followed by extensive and repeated bark beetle (Ips typographus [L. ]) outbreaks in the past 20 years. After two decades, there is apparent continuous spread of forest disturbance as well as rapid regeneration of forest vegetation, related with changes in species and their diversity. For testing of suggested methodology, we have launched imaging campaign in experimental site under various stages of forest disturbance and regeneration. <b>The</b> imagery <b>of</b> high spatial and spectral resolution enabled to analyse the inner structure and dynamics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> processes. The most informative bands for tree stress detection caused by bark beetle infestation are band 2 (650 nm) and band 3 (700 nm), followed by band 4 (800 nm) from the, red-edge and NIR part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spectrum. We have identified only three indices, which seems to be able to correctly detect different forest disturbance categories in <b>the</b> complex conditions <b>of</b> mixture of categories. These are Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Simple 800 / 650 Ratio Pigment specific simple ratio B 1 and Red-edge Index...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the possibilities for}} using an unmanned aerial system for evaluation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> condition <b>of</b> levees. <b>The</b> unmanned aerial system is equipped with two types of sensor. One is an ultra-light laser scanner, integrated with a GNSS receiver and an INS system; the other sensor is a digital camera that acquires data with stereoscopic coverage. Sensors have been mounted on <b>the</b> <b>multirotor,</b> unmanned platform <b>the</b> Hawk Moth, constructed by MSP company. LiDAR data and images <b>of</b> levees <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> several hundred metres were acquired during testing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> platform. Flights were performed in several variants. Control points measured with <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> GNSS technique were considered as reference data. The obtained results are presented in this paper; <b>the</b> methodology <b>of</b> processing <b>the</b> acquired LiDAR data, which increase in accuracy when low accuracy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> navigation systems {{occurs as a result}} of systematic errors, is also discussed. The Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm, as well as measurements of control points, were used to georeference the LiDAR data. Final accuracy in <b>the</b> order <b>of</b> centimetres was obtained for generation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> digital terrain model. <b>The</b> final products <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proposed UAV data processing are digital elevation models, an orthophotomap and colour point clouds. The authors conclude that such a platform offers wide possibilities for low-budget flights to deliver the data, which may compete with typical direct surveying measurements performed during monitoring of such objects. However, the biggest advantage is the density and continuity of data, which allows for detection of changes in objects being monitored...|$|R

40|$|International audienceA {{straightforward}} way {{to improve}} the payload capacity and flight duration of a multirotor aerial vehicle is by combining it with a balloon filled with a lifting gas, such as helium or hydrogen. The balloon provides a net aerostatic lift that is oriented contrary to the vehicle weight, thus reducing the equivalent load supported by <b>the</b> <b>multirotor</b> airframe. <b>The</b> present work {{is concerned with the}} dynamic modeling as well as <b>the</b> design <b>of</b> position and attitude control laws for a balloon-multirotor vehicle consisting of an oblate spheroid helium balloon coupled with a hexacopter structure. A six-degrees-of-freedom nonlinear dynamic model is derived for the balloon-hexacopter using the Newton-Euler approach and considering, among other common efforts, a restoration torque due to <b>the</b> displacement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> balloon's center <b>of</b> buoyancy above <b>the</b> vehicle's center <b>of</b> mass. In order to capture the contact flexibility between the balloon and the airframe, <b>the</b> center <b>of</b> buoyancy is supposed to oscillate with a second-order dynamics with respect to the airframe. Under <b>the</b> assumption <b>of</b> time-scale separation between the translational and rotational dynamics, the attitude and position control laws are designed separately from each other. Both the attitude and position control laws are proportional-derivative actions plus nonlinear feedforward terms for feedback linearization combined with control input saturation within appropriate parallelepipedal sets. These constraint sets are carefully chosen in order to satisfy torque, force and inclination design bounds. A parametric probabilistic approach where temperature and pressure are modeled as uniform-distributed random variables, and propagation of uncertainties is computed via Monte Carlo method, is employed to assess the overall system performance. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the performance and investigate some properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proposed balloon-hexacopter control system...|$|R
