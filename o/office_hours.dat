From 14 December 2014, the station's opening hours changed significantly, with the station opening on Sundays and no longer closing early in the evenings. The station previously had restricted opening hours because it primarily served the local financial services sector, so there was low demand for services outside <b>office</b> <b>hours.</b> However, with the main line station's opening hours being extended due to the Thameslink Programme, the Underground station's opening hours were changed to accommodate the additional passengers.|$|E

However, his administration imposed one-day-a-month furloughs for all non-uniformed employees from July through December 2010, as well as 2% pay cuts for managers and directors earning more than $100,000 a year. In 2008 and 2009 the City of Newark received the Government Finance Officers Association's Distinguished Budget Presentation Award. In an effort to make government more accessible, Booker held regular open <b>office</b> <b>hours</b> during which city residents can meet with him personally to discuss their concerns.

Charles seems to establish {{a good relationship with}} the rest of the staff; he buys everyone lunch and reveals the truth about their 401(k) plans and the possibility of layoffs, which Michael withheld so as not to worry the staff. Taking advice from Chief Financial Officer David Wallace (Andy Buckley), Michael tries to become better acquainted with Charles, but is unsuccessful. Michael attempts to contact Wallace on the phone, one attempt leading to getting transferred to Charles. When Charles catches the Party Planning Committee planning Michael's party during <b>office</b> <b>hours,</b> he dissolves the committee and cancels Michael's party.

40|$|<b>Office</b> <b>hour</b> {{interactions}} {{at universities}} are {{one type of}} communicative activity in which international instructors and their Turkish EFL students are involved {{as a form of}} academic or institutional discourse (Drew 2 ̆ 6 Heritage, 1992). In such real world communication, both parties employ several linguistic strategies and attend to various interactional goals to address the academic concerns at hand (Chiang, 2011; Chiang 2 ̆ 6 Mi, 2008; Limberg, 2007; 2010; Reindhart, 2010; Skyrme, 2010). Embracing a discourse analytic approach, this study investigated the primary functions and topics of <b>office</b> <b>hour</b> interactions; discourse organization of <b>office</b> <b>hour</b> interactions with regard to the features of participants’ contributions (e. g. turn-taking and turn length, verbosity or dominance, etc.); suggestion-response episodes; and successful and problematic aspects in <b>office</b> <b>hour</b> interactions. The study utilized the theoretical framework of relational work. Thirty-eight <b>office</b> <b>hour</b> interactions constituted the primary data source. The participants included 3 international instructors and their 34 Turkish EFL students. Post-interaction questionnaires and classroom observations served as secondary data sources in the study. The data analysis demonstrated that <b>office</b> <b>hour</b> interactions have various purposes and topics mostly related to the course content offered by the instructors, their expertise, and their experiences. Additionally, both parties co-constructed the discourse segments of equal and unequal contribution in which they achieved interactional and transactional goals using distinctive linguistic and discourse strategies. The co-constructed suggestion-response episodes included both instructor-initiated suggestions and students’ self-suggestory acts. The use of modals and semi-modals, imperatives, and interrogatives {{played a key role in}} instructor-initiated suggestions, whereas the students mostly relied on interrogatives. However, each party made their choices relying on the interactional goals they wished to accomplish through the use of suggestion forms. Finally, both the international instructors and their Turkish EFL students attended to different types of relational work that contributed to the successful and problematic aspects of <b>office</b> <b>hour</b> interactions, and that were mostly connected to suggestions...|$|R

5|$|On the {{weekends}} of 9–10 November 2013 and 8–9 February 2014 all voting stations were opened for new voters to register {{and for those}} who moved residence to re-register in their new voting district. The presidency of South Africa urged voters who had missed the voting station registration weekends to register at an IEC office during <b>office</b> <b>hours.</b> Presidential spokesperson, Mac Maharaj, said that voters were allowed to register to vote until the election date is published in a government gazette, after which the voters' roll is closed. Approximately 5.5 million people in total visited voting stations, including between 1 and 2 million new voters. This increased the number of registered voters to 25.3 million, representing 80.5% of the 31.4 million people eligible to vote in the country. South Africans who were born after the 1994 general election, known as the born-free generation, and are aged 18 or older were eligible to vote for the first time.|$|E

40|$|This {{case study}} {{compared}} {{the performance of}} teaching assistants (TAs) who were native speakers and nonnative speakers (NNS) of English during <b>office</b> <b>hour</b> consultations with undergraduates. Three nonnative- and two native-speaking TAs in the economics department of a major American university were videotaped during <b>office</b> <b>hour</b> consultations. The nonnative-speaking TAs were from South America and had scored 200 - 220 on a language test, corresponding to overall intelligibility but with occasional problems in pronunciation, grammar, and fluency. The videotapes were then analyzed using the conversation analytical approach combined with a broader notion of context and trouble-shooting. The analyses suggested {{that even though the}} nonnative-speaking TAs had only an intermediate level of spoken English, language-related trouble in spoken English was rare, and was quickly and effectively resolved within a turn or two. Content-related trouble, however, was more common in the interactions of both nonnative- and native-speaking TAs in the interactions with undergraduates.

Spring Hall is a large, three-storey, cellared building which was originally set in its own grounds. It has pitched roofs, gables and tall, Elizabethan-style chimneys. There is a four-storey, octagonal, pinnacled tower and a ground-floor entrance-porch at the south-east corner (pictured below). The west side, which faces the drive and the Huddersfield Road, has two non-functioning gargoyles representing a dog and fox on the outer corners of the central bay of the first floor. Besides being evident from outside, these gargoyles can be seen through adjacent windows, from inside the building. The lintel above the ground floor window on the same bay is carved with a frieze of stylised flower motifs separated by a zigzag line, and the window below contains stone frames with double ogee curves along the top edges. Above the south-east entrance porch is the Holdsworth family crest carved in stone: a lion rampant, holding an opened scroll.|$|E
