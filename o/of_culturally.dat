5|$|This {{brings the}} issue of the mysterious origin of the Wielbark culture, and why it so {{immediately}} replaced the Oksywie culture. According to the legend quoted in The Origin and Deeds of the Goths by the 6th century Gothic historian Jordanes, the ancestors of that Germanic tribe arrived from Scandinavia (under King Berig) in two boatloads and landed on the South Baltic shores, followed by a third boat carrying the ancestors of the Gepids. Supposedly they conquered the native people of that region, and then, some years later (under King Filimer, the fifth one counting from Berig), continued their migration toward the Black Sea. This story, in the past dismissed, is now seen as containing basic elements of the true sequence of events and the Wielbark culture is in part identified with Germanic ancestors of the Goths indeed. The idea of an arrival in the mouth of the Vistula region <b>of</b> <b>culturally</b> different (although related) people, who mixed with the Oksywie culture population, and being more advanced possibly dominated it (at least culturally) to some degree, is not at odds with the state of archeological findings and may explain the change of cultures in Pomerania around 30 AD.|$|E

If initial survey and/or test excavations indicate the presence of an extraordinarily valuable site, the construction may be prohibited entirely.|$|E

25|$|After the Bar Kochba Revolt of 132-135 CE, the Romans {{engaged in}} mass executions, expulsions, and enslavement, {{destroying}} {{large numbers of}} Judean towns and forbidding Jews from settling in Jerusalem or its environs (Dio Cassius, Roman History 69.12-14); there was no further Jewish government or overarching legal system thereafter in Judaea; this effectively turned the expatriate Jews of the Diaspora into a permanently exiled people, deprived of their homeland. Restrictions (taxation, discrimination, social exclusions) further alienated and marginalized remaining Jews in the Negev and Galilee and favored the settlement <b>of</b> <b>culturally</b> pagan Syro-Phoenicians and others.

25|$|It is not {{definitively}} {{known how}} {{or when the}} Native Americans first settled the Americas and the present-day United States. The prevailing theory proposes that people migrated from Eurasia across Beringia, a land bridge that connected Siberia to present-day Alaska during the Ice Age, and then spread southward throughout the Americas and possibly going {{as far south as}} the Antarctic Peninsula. This migration may have begun as early as 30,000 years ago and continued through to about 10,000+ years ago, when the land bridge became submerged by the rising sea level caused by the ending of the last glacial period. These early inhabitants, called Paleoamericans, soon diversified into many hundreds <b>of</b> <b>culturally</b> distinct nations and tribes.|$|E
25|$|Rita Gross states, {{that the}} view of Parvati only as ideal wife and mother is {{incomplete}} symbolism {{of the power of}} the feminine in mythology of India. Parvati, along with other goddesses, are involved with the broad range <b>of</b> <b>culturally</b> valued goals and activities. Her connection with motherhood and female sexuality does not confine the feminine or exhaust their significance and activities in Hindu literature. She is balanced by Durga, who is strong and capable without compromising her femaleness. She manifests in every activity, from water to mountains, from arts to inspiring warriors, from agriculture to dance. Parvati's numerous aspects, states Gross, reflects the Hindu belief that the feminine has universal range of activities, and her gender is not a limiting condition.|$|E
25|$|In Western societies, {{after the}} spread of Christianity, public {{exposure}} of a woman's bare skin between the ankle and waist started to be disapproved <b>of</b> <b>culturally.</b> Upper body exposure due {{to the use of}} the popular vest bodices used in Western Europe from the 15th century to early 20th century, as the widespread dirndls used even in more traditionally conservative mountain areas and the more or less loose shirts under these, enabled a permissive view of the shoulders, décolletage and arms allowing a free exposure of upper body hair in women of all classes with less rejection or discrimination than body hair on the sex organs, obviously to conceal by implication. Many people came to consider public exposure of pubic hair to be embarrassing. It may be regarded as immodest and sometimes as obscene. However, it never came to have a full hold in Western culture in wide tracts of Central Europe, until the encroaching of Protestantism during the 16th century on formerly more tolerant customs.|$|E

25|$|In Yayoi Kusama’s Walking Piece (1966), a {{performance}} that was documented {{in a series}} of eighteen color slides, Kusama walks along the streets of New York City in a traditional Japanese kimono with a parasol. The kimono suggests traditional roles for women in Japanese custom. The parasol, however, is made to look inauthentic as it is really a black umbrella painted white on the exterior and decorated with fake flowers. Kusama walks down unoccupied streets in an unknown quest. She then turns and cries without reason, and eventually walks away and vanishes from view. This performance, through the association of the kimono, involves the stereotypes that Asian American women continue to face. However, as an avant-garde artist living in New York, her situation alters the context of the dress, creating a cross-cultural amalgamation. Kusama is able to point out the stereotype in which her white American audience categorizes her, by showing the absurdity <b>of</b> <b>culturally</b> categorizing people in the world’s largest melting pot.|$|E
25|$|There is one {{additional}} theory {{that explains the}} occurrence of the reminiscence bump: the life script account. A life script refers to the series <b>of</b> <b>culturally</b> important transitional events {{that are expected to}} occur in a certain order at various points during the life span. During early adulthood one starts to make important decisions and have influencing experiences on his or her identity. The memories during this time period are therefore more significantly remembered because they are what has essentially determined and influenced their life script (Habernas & Bluck, 2000). A life script typically has the majority of expected transitional experiences occur during early adulthood (Gluck & Bluck, 2007), and usually include includes positive experiences such as marriage, the birth of a baby, or buying a house. Events that deviate from the life script are typically sad and traumatic. These events, such as the death of a child, are not culturally expected and often do not show a peak of recall at any specific point during the life span. Life scripts act as a way to structure memory and lead to the expectation that the happiest and the most important life events form the reminiscence bump. Contrary to the recall of happy events, the recall of sad events remains stable across the life span and does not exhibit a bump in recall.|$|E

40|$|Multicultural {{nursing is}} a concept, that can track it´s {{beginning}} to the 50 s {{of the last}} century. It started thanks to Madeleine Leininger and has been succesfully evolving ever since. Because of it, a whole line of models focused on this aspect of nursing, has began. The first goal of this thesis is to analyze available literature regarding the use <b>of</b> the <b>culturally</b> specific models. The second one is to map out the possibilities of the use <b>of</b> the <b>culturally</b> specific models in current nursing. And the last {{goal is to create}} an informative material regarding the possibillity of the use <b>of</b> the <b>culturally</b> specific models in current nursing. At first, this thesis describes some theoretical bases what is a culture and some other terms connected to it. Then it describes 7 culturally specific models Leininger model, Giger-Davidhizar model, Bloch´s assesment guide, Campinha-Bacote model, Papadopoulos, Tilki and Taylor model, Purnell model and as the last one Schim, Doorenbos, Benkert and Miller model. After describing the theoretic bases, the thesis maps out the use <b>of</b> the <b>culturally</b> specific models in practice. For it, literary and online resources were used. Through them, we gained the data about the frequency of the use of these models and the topics they were focused on. This thesis then summarises the data and points out the possible uses <b>of</b> the <b>culturally</b> specific models in nursing abroad and on-site alike. This thesis is constructed to serve as an informational material for students of healthcare practices and working nurses alike...|$|R

Flippo further opined that the phrase is an appropriate example <b>of</b> <b>culturally</b> improper language. He compared it to smiling arbitrarily at a German person which would {{give the impression that}} the smiler is a [...] "little simple-minded or not quite 'all there'". Writing that Germans prefer [...] "Auf Wiedersehen!" [...] or [...] "Tschüss!"

He also sought to stay true to the original text, though he never met or spoke with Itoi. In addition to reworking the original puns and humor, Lindblom added private jokes and American cultural allusions to Bugs Bunny, comedian Benny Hill, and This Is Spinal Tap. Apart from the dialogue, he wrote {{the rest of the}} game's text, including combat prompts and item names. As one of several Easter eggs, he named a non-player character for his daughter, Nico, who was born during development. While Lindblom took the day off for her birth, he proceeded to work 14-hour days without weekends for the next month. The game also includes protection against piracy that, when triggered, increases enemy counts to make the game less enjoyable. Additionally, right before players reach the end of the pirated copy's story, their game resets and deletes its saved file in an act that IGN declared [...] "arguably the most devious and notorious example of 'creative' copy protection".|$|E
