40|$|The {{results of}} this chapter lead to a {{modification}} of the standard stopping rule which breathes {{new life into the}} method of steepest ascent, but which is unfortunately not sufficient to effect a total resuscitation. As expected, there is no uniformly optimum stopping rule, nor even a uniformly best test statistic; both the <b>optimum</b> <b>statistic</b> and the optimum test level depend on the model parameters y 1 and y 2. One can, however, adopt a compromise rule which works reasonably well for all parameter combinations by testing at the 25 % level with the statistic zn = 1 / 2 (yn -yn- 2). In many cases the loss incurred by the compromise rule is less than half that incurred by the existing rule; in the few cases where the compromise rule is less efficient, the difference in losses is small. Nevertheless, the compromise rule is nearly always inferior to the parameter-dependent optimum rule, and the optimum itself is not always desirable...|$|E
40|$|The {{restoration}} of images {{focused on a}} photosensitive surface is treated {{from the standpoint of}} maximum likelihood estimation, taking into account the Poisson distributions of the observed data, which are the numbers of photoelectrons from various elements of the surface. A detector of an image focused on such a surface utilizes a certain linear combination of those numbers as the <b>optimum</b> detection <b>statistic.</b> Methods for calculating the false alarm and detection probabilities are proposed. It is shown that measuring noncommuting observables in an ideal quantum receiver cannot yield a lower Bayes cost than that attainable by a system measuring only commuting observables...|$|R

According to Grenander’s Theorem {{one way of}} {{computing}} likelihood ratios for continuous-time observation models is first to reduce the observation signal to an equivalent observation sequence, and then looking for the limit of the likelihood ratio for the truncated sequence. An alternative, somewhat more practical, representation of the likelihood ratio for problem (4) is provided by Pitcher’s Theorem. This result suggests a simpler and more efficient implementation of the corresponding signal detection system. In the particular case of Gaussian white noise {{the representation of the}} <b>optimum</b> detection <b>statistic</b> obtained is known as the Cameron-Martin formula. In the next result, we give an extension of Pitcher’s Theorem to the quaternion domain.|$|R

Then, we propose a new acquisition {{scheme based on}} the joint decision rule. The mean acquisition time performance of the proposed acquisition scheme is analyzed and {{compared with that of}} a conventional acquisition scheme in which only one correct cell is used for detection at each step. The numerical results show that the proposed scheme not only has better performance but also is more robust to the residual code phase offset variation than the conventional scheme. 1...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we derive the <b>optimum</b> (likelihood-ratio) {{decision}} <b>statistic</b> for a same-different paradigm. The likelihood ratio {{is dependent on}} the degree of correlation between the two observations on each trial. For the two extreme cases in which the observations are either independent or highly correlated, the optimum decision rule is identical to each of two previously suggested decision rules. For these two cases, the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves are calculated. Finally, an experimental procedure is suggested for assessing the decision rule actually used by the observer in a same-different task. © 1996 Psychonomic Society, Inc...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A new closed-form {{expression}} is derived for the exact bit-error probability (BEP) for optimum combining with binary phase-shift keying. The exact BEP {{expression is}} for multiple, equal power, cochannel interferers and multiple reception branches. It {{is assumed that}} the aggregate interference and noise is Gaussian and that both the desired signal and interference are subject to Rayleigh fading. The derivation starts by expressing the <b>optimum</b> combining decision <b>statistic</b> as a sum of quadratic forms of Gaussian random variables and it proceeds to average over the fading interference. The new BEP expression has low complexity as it contains only finite sums and products. Index Terms—Diversity reception, error probability perfor-mance, fading channels, interference suppression, optimum combining. I...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a new {{pseudo noise}} (PN) code {{acquisition}} scheme for direct sequence spread spectrum (DS/SS) signals is proposed {{based on a}} joint decision rule of two correct cells (cells) at which the code phase offset between the locally generated and received PN codes is within a desired small value. To derive the joint decision rule, the acquisition problem is modeled as a hypothesis testing problem and then the locally <b>optimum</b> (LO) test <b>statistic</b> {{is used for the}} problem. Finally, a novel acquisition technique is proposed based on the joint decision rule. The detection and mean acquisition time performances of the proposed acquisition scheme are analyzed and compared with those of a conventional acquisition scheme in which cells are individually used for detection. The numerical results show that the proposed scheme not only has better performance but also is more robust to the residual code phase offset variation than the conventional scheme. I...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} a new method {{for the design}} of <b>optimum</b> weighted order <b>statistic</b> (WOS) filters. WOS filters form a general class of increasing filters which generate an output based on the weighted rank ordering of the samples within the filter window. They include the median, weighted median, stack filters and morphological filters with flat structuring elements. This new design method is applicable to all of these operators. It has the advantage over existing techniques in that the filter weights are calculated directly from the training set observations and require no iteration. The method makes an assumption about the training set observations known as the weight monotonic property. It tests if the training set corruption is suitable for correction with an increasing filter. Where the assumption does not hold then a WOS filter should not be used for that training set. The paper includes two examples to demonstrate the design method and a justification for a training set approach to image restoration problems. Other benefits arising from the new design method are outlined in the paper. These include a method to determine the minimum MAE possible for a given training set and filter window...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—For the {{analysis}} and forecasting of time series, we always search for a statistical model capable of understanding the underlying processes of data and filtering the unwanted noise. This noise may either be white or coloured, having some pattern of autoregressive moving average i. e., ARMA(p,q) processes. This search is carried out by using various forecast accuracy criteria and tools such as, Akaike’s information criterion (AIC) and Akram test statistic (ATS). As compared to others, the AIC and ATS are noted {{to be more effective}} for identification of good models. However, AIC, being parametric in nature, is found to be comparatively more sensitive to noise volatilities and cumbersome to use; whereas, ATS, the base of which is distribution free is observed to be quite robust to noise variations, parsimonious in nature and relatively more easy to use. In this paper both the AIC and ATS are reviewed, practical implication discussed and their role in identifying optimum models from a class of candidate statistical models, especially, the linear dynamic system models is examined. For better insight, into these gadgets an example on analysis and forecasting of daily copper prices is given. Index Terms—Akaike’s information criterion, Akram test <b>statistic,</b> <b>optimum</b> forecast, statistical models, ASL, Coloured noise. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} store {{different}} insect stadia for prolonged periods provides considerable flexibility {{and ability to}} conduct experiments properly. Therefore, studies were undertaken {{to determine the effect}} of storage temperature and duration on viability of eggs of Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner). The percentage egg hatch and incubation period were significantly (P = 0. 01) influenced by egg age, storage temperature, and storage duration. Egg hatch ranged from 0. 0 to 96. 8 % across temperatures and storage durations. None of the eggs hatched when stored at x 20 and 0 C. The regression model with the <b>optimum</b> Mallow Cp <b>statistic</b> for any of the identified linear and quadratic terms did not improve the precision of prediction in egg hatch beyond 67. 0 %. Forecasting of incubation period based on egg age, storage duration, and durationrtemperature was quite effective (R 2 = 84. 2 %). Day degrees required for egg hatching decreased with an increase in temperature from 10 to 27 C, and egg age from 0 to 3 days. The day degree requirements were highest for 0 -day-old eggs at 10 C, and lowest at 27 C. Although the incubation period was higher, the hatchability was lower for 0 - and 1 -day-old eggs stored at constant 10 C, these eggs can be stored for 10 days at 10 C, with a hatchability of> 75. 0 %. It was safer to store the H. armigera eggs for 10 days at 10 C, which will hatch within 1. 6 to 2. 0 days after restoration at 27 C with a hatchability of> 75. 0 %. This information will be useful in planning and execution of experiments involving H. armigera on various aspects of research in entomology...|$|R
