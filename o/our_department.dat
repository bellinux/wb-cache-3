500|$|In 1939, Feynman {{received}} a bachelor's degree, {{and was named}} a Putnam Fellow. He attained a perfect score on the graduate school entrance exams to Princeton University in physics—an unprecedented feat—and an outstanding score in mathematics, but did poorly on the history and English portions. The head of the physics department there, Henry D. Smyth, had another concern, writing to Philip M. Morse to ask: [...] "Is Feynman Jewish? We have no definite rule against Jews but like to keep their proportion in <b>our</b> <b>department</b> reasonably small". Morse conceded that Feynman was indeed Jewish, but reassured Smyth that Feynman's [...] "physiognomy and manner, however, show no trace of this characteristic".|$|E

[...] Carson half-heartedly supported Carleton's plans. He was tired. He had suffered an injury two years before that gave him great trouble. He resigned from the Army in February 1863. Carleton refused to accept the resignation because he wanted Carson to lead a campaign against the Navajo.|$|E

40|$|Male {{and female}} {{students}} often hold di#erent views of the culture within the same computer science department. These di#erences may, in part, account for why women are underrepresented in computer science. We found that surveying students about their views of our departments' environments was {{an important first step}} in evaluating the cultures of <b>our</b> own <b>departments,</b> in determining what issues needed o be addressed, and in determining how to address them. Our survey results revealed some problems in our classroom and lab environments, and showed that there are gender di#erences in students' perceptions of <b>our</b> <b>departments.</b> We describe a set of changes that were implemented in response to our findings. These solutions are specifically designed to address problems that we discovered through our student survey, but they are not all original to us. The contribution of our work is in demonstrating how surveying is critical to identifying and understanding problems in <b>our</b> <b>departments.</b> We argue that a process of continually surveying students is vital to the maintenance and evolution of a healthy computer science program...|$|R

6000|$|The {{entertainment}} {{was not as}} agreeable {{and natural}} {{as it might have}} been. Mr Meagles, hove down by his good company while he highly appreciated it, was not himself. Mrs Gowan was herself, and that did not improve him. The fiction that it was not Mr Meagles who had stood in the way, but that it was the Family greatness, and that the Family greatness had made a concession, and there was now a soothing unanimity, pervaded the affair, though it was never openly expressed. Then the Barnacles felt that they for their parts would have done with the Meagleses when the present patronising occasion was over; and the Meagleses felt the same for their parts. Then Gowan asserting his rights as a disappointed man who had his grudge against the family, and who, perhaps, had allowed his mother to have them there, as much in the hope it might give them some annoyance as with any other benevolent object, aired his pencil and his poverty ostentatiously before them, and told them he hoped in time to settle a crust of bread and cheese on his wife, and that he begged such of them as (more fortunate than himself) came in for any good thing, and could buy a picture, to please to remember the poor painter. Then Lord Decimus, who was a wonder on his own Parliamentary pedestal, {{turned out to be the}} windiest creature here: proposing happiness to the bride and bridegroom in a series of platitudes that would have made the hair of any sincere disciple and believer stand on end; and trotting, with the complacency of an idiotic elephant, among howling labyrinths of sentences which he seemed to take for high roads, and never so much as wanted to get out of. Then Mr Tite Barnacle could not but feel that there was a person in company, who would have disturbed his life-long sitting to Sir Thomas Lawrence in full official character, if such disturbance had been possible: while Barnacle junior did, with indignation, communicate to two vapid gentlemen, his relatives, that there was a feller here, look here, who had come to <b>our</b> <b>Department</b> without an appointment and said he wanted to know, you know; and that, look here, if he was to break out now, as he might you know (for you never could tell what an ungentlemanly Radical of that sort would be up to next), and was to say, look here, that he wanted to know this moment, you know, that would be jolly; wouldn't it? ...|$|E
