5|$|An autopsy of Hawkins {{showed that}} he had 200 nanograms per {{milliliter}} of Valium in his system, which is {{the low end of}} its therapeutic-use range (100-1500ng/mL). No trace of any <b>other</b> <b>drug</b> was found in his system.|$|E
5|$|For {{functioning}} tumors, the somatostatin analog {{class of}} medications, such as octreotide, {{can reduce the}} excessive production of hormones. Lanreotide can slow tumor growth. If the tumor is not amenable to surgical removal and is causing symptoms, targeted therapy with everolimus or sunitinib can reduce symptoms and slow progression of the disease. Standard cytotoxic chemotherapy is generally not very effective for PanNETs, but may be used when <b>other</b> <b>drug</b> treatments fail to prevent the disease from progressing, or in poorly differentiated PanNET cancers.|$|E
5|$|Bond and Solitaire escape by {{boat and}} fly to New Orleans. There, Bond is {{captured}} by Kananga. It transpires that Kananga is producing two tons of heroin and is protecting the poppy fields by exploiting San Monique locals' fear of voodoo priest Baron Samedi, and the occult. Through his alter ego, Mr. Big, Kananga plans {{to distribute the}} heroin free of charge at his Fillet of Soul restaurants, which will {{increase the number of}} addicts. He intends to bankrupt <b>other</b> <b>drug</b> dealers with his giveaway, then charge high prices for his heroin later in order to capitalize on the huge drug dependencies he has cultivated.|$|E
5000|$|Best Buys {{are then}} chosen {{based on a}} drug’s {{effectiveness}} and safety, the side effects it may cause, how convenient it is to use, its track record in studies and use over time, {{and how much it}} costs relative to <b>others</b> <b>drugs.</b> There is no set formula for choosing Best Buys. Best Buys are chosen because they are: as effective as all the <b>other</b> <b>drugs</b> in the category, or more so; safe and cause no more—and usually fewer—side effects than <b>other</b> <b>drugs</b> in the category; and cost less on average than <b>other</b> <b>drugs</b> in the category. Several of the Best Buys have been chosen because of their superior effectiveness or safety profile even though they may cost more.|$|R
50|$|No {{relevant}} {{drug interactions}} {{have been found}} in studies.

5|$|Miami {{previously}} {{had a series}} of seven buildings set aside for student residences called the Apartment Area, consisting of the oldest dormitories on campus which were originally built to house married veterans and their families. These buildings also featured fully furnished apartments with kitchen facilities, but they were not leased to students as in the University Village. These residences were closed {{at the end of the}} Spring 2010 semester, although several others of these original dormitories continue to be used as office space for departments such as the Office of Student Employment, the Air Force ROTC Detachment 155, and the Center for Alcohol and <b>Other</b> <b>Drug</b> Education PIER 21.|$|E
5|$|On May 6, 2008, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) {{announced}} {{the arrest of}} 96 individuals, of whom 75 were San Diego State University students, {{on a variety of}} drug charges in a multiple-month narcotics sting called Operation Sudden Fall. Two kilograms of cocaine were seized, along with 50 pounds of marijuana, 350 Ecstasy pills, hash oil, methamphetamine, <b>other</b> <b>drug</b> paraphernalia, three guns, and $60,000 in cash. Several months after the May 6 announcement, it was reported {{that the majority of the}} defendants had pleaded guilty to the felony charges. The defendants were then either placed on probation or were required to enter drug diversion programs. Other defendants only received citations or had their cases dismissed.|$|E
5|$|Twenty {{percent of}} modern {{pharmaceuticals}} contain fluorine. One of these, the cholesterol-reducer atorvastatin (Lipitor), made more revenue than any <b>other</b> <b>drug</b> {{until it became}} generic in 2011. The combination asthma prescription Seretide, a top-ten revenue drug in the mid-2000s, contains two active ingredients, one of which – fluticasone – is fluorinated. Many drugs are fluorinated to delay inactivation and lengthen dosage periods because the carbon–fluorine bond is very stable. Fluorination also increases lipophilicity because the bond is more hydrophobic than the carbon–hydrogen bond, and this often helps in cell membrane penetration and hence bioavailability.|$|E

5|$|The {{demolition}} of the residential towers that {{had served as}} the Barksdale organization's prime territory pushes their dealers back out onto the streets of Baltimore. Stringer Bell continues his reform of the organization by cooperating with <b>other</b> <b>drug</b> lords, sharing with one another territory, product and profits. Stringer's proposal is met with a curt refusal from Marlo Stanfield, leader of a new, growing crew. Against Stringer's advice, Avon decides to take Marlo's territory by force and the two gangs become embroiled in a bitter turf war with multiple deaths. Omar Little continues to rob the Barksdale organization wherever possible. Working with his new boyfriend Dante and two women, he is once more a serious problem. The violence related to the drug trade makes it an obvious choice of investigation for Cedric Daniels' permanently established Major Crimes Unit.|$|E
5|$|When Marge and the {{children}} arrive at El Chemistri, Homer unknowingly arrives at an illegal meth lab that he thinks is the actual restaurant. While the trio eat their meal (deconstructed Caesar salad) with other foodies, Marge feels guilty about misdirecting Homer. Meanwhile, Homer meets the meth dealer and <b>other</b> <b>drug</b> addicts, whom he believes to be food hipsters. Just as {{he is about to}} have a taste of the meth (which he thinks is food produced with the help of molecular gastronomy), the police burst in and a gunfight ensues between them and the drug addicts. At El Chemistri, Marge receives a panicked text message from Homer requesting help, and she asks the other foodies to help save her husband. They refuse, so she, Bart, and Lisa head by themselves towards the meth lab after receiving doggie bags from the chef who is angry that they are leaving. After arriving, Marge throws apple pie from her doggie bag into the mouth of the meth dealer. This causes a flashback inside his mind to his childhood days when his mother used to make apple pie. With the help of this distraction, the police subdue him. After Marge apologizes to Homer, they and their children decide to have fun together as a whole family from now on.|$|E

25|$|The {{relationship}} between tobacco and <b>other</b> <b>drug</b> use has been well-established, however {{the nature of}} this association remains unclear. The two main theories are the phenotypic causation (gateway) model and the correlated liabilities model. The causation model argues that smoking is a primary influence on future drug use, while the correlated liabilities model argues that smoking and <b>other</b> <b>drug</b> use are predicated on genetic or environmental factors.|$|E
