40|$|Annuals are an {{important}} component part of plant communities in arid and semiarid grassland ecosystems. Although {{it is well known}} that precipitation has a significant impact on productivity and species richness of community or perennials, nevertheless, due to lack of measurements, especially long-term experiment data, there is little information on how quantity and patterns of precipitation affect similar attributes <b>of</b> <b>annuals.</b> This study addresses this knowledge gap by analyzing how quantity and temporal patterns of precipitation affect aboveground biomass, interannual variation aboveground biomass, relative aboveground biomass, and species richness <b>of</b> <b>annuals</b> using a 29 -year dataset from a dry steppe site at the Inner Mongolia Grassland Ecosystem Research Station. Results showed that aboveground biomass and relative aboveground biomass <b>of</b> <b>annuals</b> increased with increasing precipitation. The coefficient of variation in aboveground biomass <b>of</b> <b>annuals</b> decreased significantly with increasing annual and growing-season precipitation. Species richness <b>of</b> <b>annuals</b> increased significantly with increasing annual precipitation and growing-season precipitation. Overall, this study highlights the importance of precipitation for aboveground biomass and species richness <b>of</b> <b>annuals...</b>|$|R
