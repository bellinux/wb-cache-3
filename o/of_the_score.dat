5|$|As {{written in}} the {{original}} 1926 edition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>score,</b> the Fifth Symphony is scored for 3 flutes (third doubling piccolo), 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, cymbals, triangle, tambourine, snare drum, celesta, and strings. Some optional doublings are added in the 1950 edition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>score</b> revised by Emil Telmányi and Erik Tuxen; these include the third flute doubling flute in G and the second bassoon doubling contrabassoon. These optional doublings are discarded in the latest 1998 Carl Nielsen Edition score, which was produced as a co-operation between the Danish Royal Library and Edition Wilhelm Hansen.|$|E

5|$|Kamen's {{first draft}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>score</b> had been {{described}} as having an abundance of themes and rich orchestrations. During early recording sessions, producer Lauren Shuler Donner expressed her dissatisfaction with Kamen's music and forced him to rewrite the entire score by using less themes and more electronic elements.|$|E

30|$|Given one humming data sample, five {{matching}} {{scores to}} one MIDI file {{can be obtained}} by the five matchers (Section 2.4). With these five scores, we obtain one final <b>score</b> by using <b>the</b> <b>score</b> level fusion method. Various methods exist for score level fusion [25], such as the MIN, MAX, PRODUCT, SUM, and Weighted SUM rules as follows [13]. Through the MIN rule, we select <b>the</b> minimum value <b>of</b> all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scores.</b> <b>The</b> MAX rule selects <b>the</b> maximum <b>score.</b> <b>The</b> PRODUCT rule obtains <b>the</b> multiplied value <b>of</b> all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scores.</b> <b>The</b> SUM rule obtains <b>the</b> summed value <b>of</b> all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scores.</b> <b>The</b> Weighted SUM rule obtains the summed value with weights. The optimal weight values for the Weighted SUM rule were empirically determined.|$|R

5|$|A {{trend towards}} greater {{authenticity}} began after Hammond's orchestrations in the 1970s provided {{a basis for}} staging the work in its original form. This process was further aided by the discovery in the 1990s of Bizet's 1863 conducting score. In this, the orchestral parts were reduced to six staves, but notes and other markings in the manuscript provided additional clues to the original orchestration.

5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in five movements, {{an instrumental}} sinfonia and two choral movements framing two arias, one for soprano (S), {{the other a}} duet for tenor (T) and bass (B). As in Bach's other early cantatas, there are no recitatives. Besides the three solo voices, Bach scored the work for a four-part choir and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of two violins (Vl), viola (Va), cello (Vc), bass (violone) and continuo, as a copy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>score</b> from around 1731 by Johann Ludwig Dietel, a student of Bach, shows. The duration has been given as 10 minutes and the main key as C major.|$|E
5|$|Eli Roth's {{contribution}} is a promo for the slasher opus Thanksgiving. Produced {{in the style}} of holiday-themed slasher films like Halloween, Silent Night, Deadly Night, April Fool's Day and My Bloody Valentine, the trailer starred Jeff Rendell as a killer who stalks victims while dressed as a pilgrim; Jordan Ladd, Jay Hernandez, and Roth himself as his intended victims; and Michael Biehn as the Sheriff. The design for the titles in Thanksgiving was based on a Mad magazine slasher parody titled Arbor Day. Excerpts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>score</b> from Creepshow were used in the faux trailer.|$|E
5|$|Herrmann {{used the}} lowered music budget to his {{advantage}} by writing for a string orchestra rather than a full symphonic ensemble, contrary to Hitchcock's request for a jazz score. He thought of the single tone color of the all-string soundtrack {{as a way of}} reflecting the black-and-white cinematography of the film. The strings play con sordini (muted) for all the music other than the shower scene, creating a darker and more intense effect. Film composer Fred Steiner, in an analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>score</b> to Psycho, points out that string instruments gave Herrmann access to a wider range in tone, dynamics, and instrumental special effects than any other single instrumental group would have.|$|E

5|$|In basketball, {{points are}} used to keep track <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>score</b> in a game. Points can be {{accumulated}} by making field goals (worth two points from within the three-point line or three points from beyond the three-point line) or free throws (worth one point). The team that records the most points {{at the end of}} a game is declared the game's winner. If the game is still tied at the end of regulation play, additional overtime period(s) are played in order to determine the winner.|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} {{statement}} of the principal theme (between the C minor and A-flat major sections) there is a notational error which, in a literal performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>score,</b> causes a harmonic clash between the piano and the winds. Mozart probably wrote the piano and wind parts at different times, resulting in an oversight by the composer. Alfred Brendel, who has recorded the concerto on multiple occasions, argues that performers should not follow the score literally but correct Mozart's error. Brendel further argues that the time signature for the whole movement is another notational error: played in cut common time, which calls for two beats per bar rather than four, the movement is, in his view, too fast.|$|E
5|$|L'incoronazione di Poppea (SV 308, The Coronation of Poppaea) is an Italian opera by Claudio Monteverdi, with a {{libretto}} by Giovanni Francesco Busenello, first {{performed at}} the Teatro Santi Giovanni e Paolo in Venice during the 1643 carnival season. One of the first operas to use historical events and people, it describes how Poppaea, mistress of the Roman emperor Nero, is able to achieve her ambition and be crowned empress. The opera was revived in Naples in 1651, but was then neglected until the rediscovery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>score</b> in 1888, after which it {{became the subject of}} scholarly attention in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

The illustrious orchestra revolted at the rehearsal for the first performance, refusing to play for Monteux; only an intervention by Diaghilev restored the rehearsal, {{by the end of}} which Monteux was applauded and Stravinsky given an ovation. In the middle of the tour Monteux was briefly summoned back to Paris by the Concerts Colonne, which had the contractual right to recall him, to deputise for Pierné; his own deputy, Désiré-Émile Inghelbrecht, took temporary musical charge of the Ballets Russes.|$|E
