This scheme was chosen because a new dotted version would make the old <b>one</b> <b>look</b> obsolete and vendors would have trouble selling their CDs.|$|E

They examined the remains of the headless woman and said it was not Gunness.|$|E

These include the Shiva Sutras, the Shiva Samhita, and those by the scholars of Kashmir Shaivism {{such as the}} 10th-century scholar Abhinavagupta.

Fight co-ordinator Buster Reeves designed all the moves and then taught the cast how to make them and give a sense of real aggression. Reeves commented on the ambush by the Hill men {{as one of the most}} difficult as he had to show many people fighting on screen at the same time making every <b>one</b> <b>look</b> original and exciting, and also noting how intimidating it could be for the actors to have 20 stuntmen running through their midst with axes and swords.|$|E

Konnan introduced himself and explained how he was brought here by his manager/agent, John Roberts. Roberts had already bragged to de los Santos that Carlos had been a wrestler in Florida. Suddenly, a big roar (laughter) went up from another wrestler, Miguel Lopez, who wrestled as Rey Mysterio. Lopez/Mysterio explained to Carlos that Roberts was just a nutty fan, always in the front row, but that he did nothing involved with managing or agent-ing or anything else in the business. Still, the wrestlers asked Carlos, want to give it a try?" [...] Billed as El Centurión ("The Centurion"), Ashenoff debuted for the Universal Wrestling Association (UWA) on January 6, 1988.|$|E

[...] In September, McLaren again helped hire private rehearsal space for the group, who had been practising in pubs. Cook, with a full-time job he was loath to give up, was making noises about quitting. According to Matlock's later description, Cook [...] "created a smokescreen" [...] by claiming Jones was not skilled enough to be the band's sole guitarist. An advertisement was placed in Melody Maker for a [...] "Whizz Kid Guitarist. Not older than 20. Not worse looking than Johnny Thunders" [...] (referring to a leading member of the New York punk scene). Most of the guitar players who auditioned were incompetent, but in McLaren's view, the process created {{a new sense of}} solidarity among the four band members. Steve New was considered the only talented guitarist who tried out and the band invited him to join. Jones was improving rapidly, and the band's developing sound had no room for the technical lead work at which New was adept. He departed after a month.|$|E

The {{customer}} is revealed to be Tom (a recurring character throughout the series), who is at first happy that he finally got his pizza, until he discovers {{he did not get}} the drink he claims to have asked for. A confused SpongeBob checks the order, which says that Tom didn't order a drink (although it is heavily implied that Mr. Krabs didn't hear Tom's order correctly or that he hung up before Tom had a chance to finish). His blood boiling with anger, Tom harshly berates SpongeBob and refuses to take the pizza or pay for it before slamming the door. SpongeBob goes back to Squidward and collapses to the ground and cries (while absorbing his tears). Infuriated that Tom berated SpongeBob and won't pay for the pizza all because of a missing drink (making the long journey and the ridiculous obstacles the duo went through a complete waste of time), Squidward confronts Tom who arrogantly says, [...] "Another <b>one?</b> <b>Look,</b> I told your little friend I ain't payin' for that!" [...] to which Squidward angrily claims, [...] "Well, this one's on the house!" [...] and brutally shoves the pizza into Tom's face as payback for his rudeness. Squidward then goes back to SpongeBob who, stilling crying, asks, [...] "Did he change his mind?" [...] Squidward cheers him up by saying, [...] "He sure did. Ate the whole thing in one bite." [...] The two then drive back to the Krusty Krab, which is comically revealed to be right across the street, much to Squidward's dismay, who then says [...] "Oh, my aching tentacles!".|$|E

Idolator's Mike Wass interpreted these lines as showing the singer [...] "emotional shortcomings". The Atlantic editor Nolan Feeney felt that these lines showcased many of the singer's recurring themes present on her other albums — [...] "the empowerment that comes with being a strong, independent woman, and the fulfillment that comes with love and marriage". Finney wrote that during {{the beginning of the}} song, Beyoncé seemed excited about her role as a wife in the kitchen, but afterwards as the events go wrong and she is left alone, the same role feels oppressive.The singer continues singing lines about jealousy and realizes her partner will not come: [...] "I wish you were me/ So you could feel this feeling/ I never broke one promise, and I know when you're not honest." [...] After the chorus, Beyoncé sings the lines [...] "Sometimes I want to walk in your shoes, do the type of things I never ever do.

[...] The protagonist can not tolerate the fact she has been underappreciated and goes on to put on a [...] "freakum dress out my closet" [...] (a reference to her own song [...] "Freakum Dress" [...] (2006)) and stay the night outside further singing about her own attractiveness.
