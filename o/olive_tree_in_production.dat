40|$|Optimal {{potassium}} nutrition {{is essential}} to maximize <b>olive</b> <b>tree</b> <b>production.</b> <b>In</b> Tunisia, <b>olive</b> <b>trees</b> are mainly conducted under rainfed conditions and subjected to water and nutrient deficits. An experiment was established in semi arid region to study the response of <b>olive</b> <b>tree</b> to potassium mineral nutrition using potassium sulphate in reference to Control. Potassium was supplied by foliar spray and soil spreading at two levels. Foliar treatments were 50 and 100 % of tree requirement. For soil spreading, 100 % and 200 % of the tree needs were applied. After five of experiment, yield was significantly higher for 100 % foliar spray than the control. Leaf mineral analysis revealed a significant increase of K foliar content in response to K supply. Foliar nutrition at 100 % of tree needs improved the cumulative yield and olive quality. An increase of average fruit weight, pit ratio was observed for foliar spray treatment. However, oil quality seems to be unaffected with insignificant differences of poly phenols content and fatty acid composition...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a System Safety application {{to reduce the}} economical impact hazards in growings produced by Rainfall. System Safety is an engineering subdiscipline oriented to identify and mitigate the possible hazards to a system under study. Inside the System Safety area, the FMECA (Failure Mode, Effects and Criticallity Analysis) is a popular tool to analyze and identify the failures and weaknesses points of any system. Basically, it consist on identifying systematically the failure modes of a system to mitigate {{them as much as}} possible. The idea is to study three different kind of growings (stone fruits in the south of Spain, wheat <b>production</b> <b>in</b> Castilla Leon and <b>Olive</b> <b>trees</b> <b>production</b> <b>in</b> Andalucia) using this methodology in order to identify all the hazardous situations produced by rainfall. Applying {{the state of the art}} weather forecast techniques, this information would help farmers to prevent and mitigate the identified hazardous situations. The aim of the work is to prevent the economical hazards as are defined in the System Safety area: "Any real or potential condition that can cause injury, illness, or death to personnel; damage to or loss of a system, equipment or property; or damage to the environment", so the study is not reduced to the analysis of catastrophical situations but aboutany kind of economical damage produced by rainfall...|$|R

40|$|Pollinia pollini (Costa) (Hemiptera: Asterolecanidae) is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} most important pest infesting <b>olive</b> <b>trees</b> <b>in</b> Egypt. The aim of this work is to study the survey of host plants, geographical distribution and natural enemies as well as the dynamic of P. pollini on <b>olive</b> <b>trees</b> <b>in</b> Egypt. The obtained results indicated that P. pollini infested only <b>olive</b> <b>trees</b> <b>in</b> two Governorates. These are Alexandria and Fayoum Governorates. No parasitoid species were collected and recorded in the present work. Three species of predators were recorded that attacked P. pollini in Egypt. These are the coccinellids, Coccinella undecimpunctata L., Scymnus seriacus Mars. and the Neuroptera species, Chrysoperlla carnae Steph. Also the present study included the dynamics of P. pollini and its predators on <b>olive</b> <b>trees</b> <b>in</b> Alexandria Governorate during 2010 and 2011. Statistical analysis of the effect of weather factors on the population of P. pollini during the 2  years under consideration was discussed. It was concluded that maximum, minimum temperatures and % relative humidity are significant on the population of P. pollini. The trend over both years indicated the occurrence of two generations per year for P. pollini on <b>olive</b> <b>trees</b> <b>in</b> Alexandria...|$|R
