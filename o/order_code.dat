Anticipating the various options open to American landing forces, the Japanese operational <b>order,</b> <b>code</b> named Sho ("victory"), provided four scenarios to counter an invasion anywhere between the Philippines and the Kuriles. The plan was problematic for morale, however, because it broke with IJN tradition by assigning overriding importance to sinking U.S. supply vessels rather than U.S. warships. As a result, the Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet Admiral Soemu Toyoda flew out to the front in early October to rally the troops behind Sho.|$|E

In {{the first part of}} the paper we examine a matroid-theoretic perspective of linear <b>ordered</b> <b>codes.</b> We define the (multivariate) Tutte polynomial of a linear code and prove an extension of the Greene theorem for an ordered metric.

The ordered metric is known to describe the noise process in a wireless fading system studied by S. Tavildar and P. Viswanath (2006). We define a probabilistic model of the channel in the system which can be represented by a set of dependent parallel symmetric channels. We show that linear <b>ordered</b> <b>codes</b> achieve capacity of this channel. As an application of these results, we show that linear <b>ordered</b> <b>codes</b> attain secrecy capacity of parallel wiretap channels that extend Wyner’s wire-tap channel I model.

A biological model of the lateral geniculate nucleus generates an asynchronous wave of spikes, with the most strongly activated neurons firing first. Geniculate activation leads to both the direct excitation of a cortical pyramidal cell and disynaptic feed-forward inhibition. The mechanism provides automatic gain control, so the cortical neurons respond {{over a wide range}} of stimulus contrasts.
