2500|$|I/O {{psychology}} {{is one of}} the 15 recognized specialties in professional psychology in the United States. It is represented by Division 14 of the American Psychological Association (APA), known formally as the Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology (SIOP). In the United Kingdom, industrial and organizational psychologists are referred to as occupational psychologists. <b>Occupational</b> <b>psychology</b> in the UK is one of nine 'protected titles' within the profession [...] "practitioner psychologist" [...] regulated by the Health and Care Professions Council.

2500|$|The {{name change}} of the {{division}} from [...] "industrial psychology" [...] to [...] "industrial and organizational psychology" [...] reflected the shift {{in the work of}} industrial psychologists who had originally addressed work behavior from the individual perspective, examining performance and attitudes of individual workers. Their work became broader. Group behavior in the workplace became a worthy subject of study. The emphasis on [...] "organizational" [...] underlined the fact that when an individual joins an organization (e.g., the organization that hired him or her), he or she will be exposed to a common goal and a common set of operating procedures. In the 1970s in the UK, references to <b>occupational</b> <b>psychology</b> became more common than I/O psychology.|$|E

2500|$|Industrial and {{organizational}} psychology (I/O psychology), {{which is also}} known as <b>occupational</b> <b>psychology,</b> organizational psychology, and work {{and organizational}} psychology, is an applied discipline within psychology. I/O psychology is the science of human behaviour relating to work and applies psychological theories and principles to organizations and individuals in their places of work as well as the individual's work-life more generally. I/O psychologists are trained in the scientist–practitioner model. They contribute to an organization's success by improving the performance, motivation, job satisfaction, and occupational safety and health as well as the overall health and well-being of its employees. [...] An I/O psychologist conducts research on employee behaviours and attitudes, and how these can be improved through hiring practices, training programs, feedback, and management systems.|$|E

50|$|<b>Occupational</b> health <b>psychology</b> (OHP) is a {{discipline}} {{that emerged from}} health psychology, industrial/organizational <b>psychology,</b> and <b>occupational</b> health. OHP is concerned with identifying psychosocial characteristics of workplaces {{that give rise to}} problems in physical (e.g., cardiovascular disease) and mental health (e.g., depression). OHP has investigated such psychosocial characteristics of workplaces as workers' decision latitude and supervisors' supportiveness. OHP also concerns itself with interventions that can prevent or ameliorate work-related health problems. Such interventions have important, beneficial implications for the economic success of organizations. Other research areas of concern to OHP include workplace violence, unemployment, and workplace safety. Two exemplary OHP journals are the Journal of <b>Occupational</b> Health <b>Psychology</b> and Work & Stress. Two prominent OHP professional organizations are the European Academy of <b>Occupational</b> Health <b>Psychology</b> and the Society for <b>Occupational</b> Health <b>Psychology.</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>Occupational</b> health <b>psychology</b> (OHP) is a {{relatively}} new discipline that emerged from the confluence of health psychology, industrial and organizational <b>psychology,</b> and <b>occupational</b> health. OHP has its own journals and professional organizations. The field is concerned with identifying psychosocial characteristics of workplaces that give rise to health-related problems in people who work. These problems can involve physical health (e.g., cardiovascular disease) or mental health (e.g., depression). Examples of psychosocial characteristics of workplaces that OHP has investigated include amount of decision latitude a worker can exercise and the supportiveness of supervisors. OHP is also concerned with {{the development and implementation of}} interventions that can prevent or ameliorate work-related health problems. In addition, OHP research has important implications for the economic success of organizations. Other research areas of concern to OHP include workplace incivility and violence, work-home carryover, unemployment and downsizing, and workplace safety and accident prevention. Two important OHP journals are the Journal of <b>Occupational</b> Health <b>Psychology</b> and Work & Stress. Three important organizations closely associated with OHP are the International Commission on Occupational Health's Scientific Committee on Work Organisation and Psychosocial Factors (ICOH-WOPS), the Society for <b>Occupational</b> Health <b>Psychology,</b> and the European Academy of <b>Occupational</b> Health <b>Psychology.</b>|$|R
