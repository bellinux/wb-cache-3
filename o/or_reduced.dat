By planning to <b>reduce</b> manpower, <b>or</b> <b>reduce</b> change-over times, <b>or</b> <b>reduce</b> campaign lengths, <b>or</b> <b>reduce</b> lot sizes the question of waste comes immediately into focus upon those elements that prevent the plan being implemented. Often {{it is in the}} operations' area rather than the process area that muda can be eliminated and remove the blockage to the plan. Tools of many types and methodologies can then be employed on these wastes to <b>reduce</b> <b>or</b> eliminate them.|$|R
5|$|Swelling of damaged muscle {{occasionally}} {{leads to}} compartment syndrome—compression of surrounding tissues, such as nerves and blood vessels, {{in the same}} fascial compartment—leading {{to the loss of}} blood supply and damage or loss of function in the part(s) of the body supplied by these structures. Symptoms of this complication include pain <b>or</b> <b>reduced</b> sensation in the affected limb. A second recognized complication is disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), a severe disruption in blood clotting that may lead to uncontrollable bleeding.|$|E
5|$|Voluntary markets, also {{referred}} to as green power markets, are driven by consumer preference. Voluntary markets allow a consumer to choose to do more than policy decisions require and reduce the environmental impact of their electricity use. Voluntary green power products must offer a significant benefit and value to buyers to be successful. Benefits may include zero <b>or</b> <b>reduced</b> greenhouse gas emissions, other pollution reductions or other environmental improvements on power stations.|$|E
5|$|Aggressive mimicry is {{opposite}} {{in principle}} to defensive mimicry, where the mimic generally benefits from being treated as harmful. The mimic may resemble its own prey, or some other organism which is beneficial {{or at least not}} harmful to the prey. The model, i.e. the organism being 'imitated', may experience increased <b>or</b> <b>reduced</b> fitness, or may not be affected at all by the relationship. On the other hand, the signal receiver inevitably suffers from being tricked, {{as is the case in}} most mimicry complexes.|$|E

5|$|As of the 2014-15 school year, {{the school}} had an {{enrollment}} of 2,612 students and 100.4 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 26.0:1. There were 100 students (3.8% of enrollment) eligible for free lunch and 43 (1.6% of students) eligible for reduced-cost lunch. The student population at Amador Valley is predominantly White, with a large Asian minority and Hispanic and Latino Americans and African American minorities. Seven percent of Amador Valley students are involved in special education, three percent qualify for English language learner support, and two percent qualify for free <b>or</b> <b>reduced</b> price lunch.|$|E
5|$|Auburn High School, the fourteenth–largest {{high school}} in Alabama (fourth-largest by grades 10-12 enrollment), {{enrolled}} 1,748 students in the 2015–2016 school year. Twenty-six percent of Auburn High's enrollment is African American, ten percent is of Asian descent whose majority is Korean, fifty-nine percent is of European descent. Three percent of students are classified as Hispanic. Over forty languages are spoken {{in the homes of}} Auburn High School students, and twenty percent of enrolled students are eligible for federal free <b>or</b> <b>reduced</b> lunch programs. Auburn High School has a 14.8:1 student-teacher ratio and a drop-out rate of 1.09%.|$|E
5|$|Each {{iteration}} of the Kentucky Constitution {{has provided}} that the governor receive a salary. Under the first three constitutions, the governor's salary could not be increased <b>or</b> <b>reduced</b> {{while he was in}} office; this provision was extended to all public officials in the present constitution. The governor's salary is set by law, and is equal to $60,000 times the increase in the consumer price index between January 1, 1984, {{and the beginning of the}} current calendar year. In 2014, the governor's salary was $186,730.|$|E

5|$|Fares on Community Transit buses {{are priced}} into three groups: adult, youth, and reduced. Adult fare is charged for {{passengers}} {{between the ages}} of 19 and 64, youth fare is charged for passengers between ages 6 & 18, and the reduced fare is charged for passengers over the age of 65 or those with disabilities or Medicare card holders. Up to two children under 5 ride free with a chaperone paying full <b>or</b> <b>reduced</b> fare for themselves. Fares also change based on service level, with local service within Snohomish County costing the least and commuter service to Seattle being more expensive; commuter service from southern Snohomish County and Everett is also less costly compared to commuter service from northern and eastern Snohomish County. The last fare increase occurred on July 1, 2015, raising the adult and DART fares by 25 cents.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Congress passed must-carry regulations, which {{required}} cable carriers to allocate spectrum to local broadcasters. This affected {{the availability of}} C-SPAN in some areas, in particular C-SPAN2, as some providers chose to discontinue carriage of the channel altogether. Between 1993 and 1994, cable systems in 95 U.S. cities dropped <b>or</b> <b>reduced</b> broadcasts of C-SPAN and C-SPAN2, following {{the implementation of the}} must-carry regulations. Viewers protested these decisions, especially when the changes coincided with matters of local interest occurring in the House or Senate. Some communities, such as Eugene, Oregon and Alexandria, Virginia, were successful in restoring C-SPAN availability. C-SPAN availability was later restored as technological developments that resulted in the expansion of channel capacity on cable providers allowed for mandatory stations and the C-SPAN networks both to be broadcast.|$|E
5|$|In the 2006-2007 school year, 964 {{students}} attended North. North's minority enrollment {{has grown}} in {{the last twenty years}} despite attempts to keep it low. In 1987 North's minority enrollment was 46%. Minority enrollment continued to grow, becoming over 60% in 1991. Today, only three percent of students are white, with the majority of students, 69%, being black. Currently, 82% of students qualify for free <b>or</b> <b>reduced</b> priced lunch, an indicator of poverty. 16% of the students had limited English proficiency and 22% of students qualified for special education.|$|E

Voss and Carleton recognized five synapomorphies for the group, all of which are shared by Lundomys; the placement in Oryzomyini of Lundomys and of three other genera—Holochilus, Pseudoryzomys, and Zygodontomys—which also lack complete mesoloph(id)s has been universally supported since.|$|E

Elemental iron, <b>or</b> <b>reduced</b> iron, despite being absorbed at only one-third to two-thirds the efficiency (relative to iron sulfate), is often added to {{foods such as}} breakfast cereals or enriched wheat flour. Iron is most available to the body when chelated to amino acids and is also available {{for use as a}} common iron supplement. Glycine, the cheapest and most common amino acid is most often used to produce iron glycinate supplements.|$|E

Thiomersal is metabolized to ethyl mercury. Although it was widely speculated that this mercury-based preservative could cause or trigger autism in children, scientific studies showed no evidence supporting any such link. Nevertheless, thiomersal has been removed from, <b>or</b> <b>reduced</b> to trace amounts in all U.S. vaccines recommended for children 6 {{years of age and}} under, with the exception of inactivated influenza vaccine.|$|E

Teenagers with lost <b>or</b> <b>reduced</b> genital sensation benefit from education about alternative ways to experience pleasure and satisfaction from sexual acts. The teen years are often particularly difficult for those with SCI, in terms of body image and relationships. Given the importance they place on sexuality and privacy, adolescents may experience humiliation when parents or caregivers bathe them or take care of bowel and bladder needs. They can benefit from sexuality counseling, support groups, and mentoring by adults with SCI who can share experiences and lead discussions with peers. With the right care and education from family and professionals, injured children and adolescents can develop into sexually healthy adults.|$|E
