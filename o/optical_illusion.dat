5|$|In {{pictures}} {{taken by the}} Hubble Space Telescope in 1999, the motion of M87's jet was measured at four to six times the speed of light. This motion is presumably an <b>optical</b> <b>illusion</b> caused by the relativistic velocity of the jet, and not true superluminal motion. However, detection of such motion supports the theory that quasars, BL Lacertae objects and radio galaxies may all be the same phenomenon, known as active galaxies, viewed from different perspectives. It has been proposed M87 could actually be a BL Lacertae object (with a low-luminosity nucleus compared with the brightness of its host galaxy) seen from an unfavorable angle to appreciate the properties {{of that kind of}} galaxy.|$|E
5|$|Tourism is an {{important}} industry in Moncton and historically owes its origins {{to the presence of}} two natural attractions, the tidal bore of the Petitcodiac River (see above) and the <b>optical</b> <b>illusion</b> of Magnetic Hill. The tidal bore was the first phenomenon to become an attraction but the construction of the Petitcodiac causeway in the 1960s effectively extirpated the attraction. Magnetic Hill, on the city's northwest outskirts, is the city's most famous attraction. The Magnetic Hill area includes (in addition to the phenomenon itself), a golf course, major water park, zoo, and an outdoor concert facility. A $90 million casino/hotel/entertainment complex opened at Magnetic Hill in 2010.|$|E

40|$|Research on {{the neural}} {{processing}} of <b>optical</b> <b>illusions</b> can provide clues {{for understanding the}} neural mechanisms underlying visual perception. Previous {{studies have shown that}} some visual areas contribute to the perception of <b>optical</b> <b>illusions</b> such as the Kanizsa triangle and Müller-Lyer figure; however, the neural mechanisms underlying the processing of these and other <b>optical</b> <b>illusions</b> have not been clearly identified. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we determined which brain regions are active during the perception of <b>optical</b> <b>illusions.</b> For our study, we enrolled 18 participants. The illusory optical stimuli consisted of many kana letters, which are Japanese phonograms. During the shape task, participants stated aloud whether they perceived the shapes of two <b>optical</b> <b>illusions</b> as being the same or not. During the word task, participants read aloud the kana letters in the stimuli. A direct comparison between the shape and word tasks showed activation of the right inferior frontal gyrus, left medial frontal gyrus, and right pulvinar. It is well known that there are two visual pathways, the geniculate and extrageniculate systems, which belong to the higher-level and primary visual systems, respectively. The pulvinar belongs to the latter system, and the findings of the present study suggest that the extrageniculate system is involved in the cognitive processing of <b>optical</b> <b>illusions...</b>|$|R

5|$|Above {{the third}} setback, {{consisting}} of the 24th through 27th floors, the facade contains horizontal bands and zigzagged gray-and-black brick motifs. Above the fourth setback, between the 27th and 31st floors, the shaft starts to appear. At each corner of the 31st floor, large car-hood ornaments made of Nirosta steel serve as visually striking objects that make the base look larger. These corner extensions alleviate a common <b>optical</b> <b>illusion</b> seen in tall buildings with horizontal bands, whose taller floors would normally look larger. The 31st floor also contains a gray and white frieze of hubcaps and fenders, which both symbolizes the Chrysler Corporation {{and serves as a}} visual effect for the building's Art Deco design. The bonnet embellishments take the shape of Mercury's winged helmet, which was modeled after the hood ornament installed on Chrysler vehicles at the time.|$|E

25|$|The {{existence}} of canal-like features was definitively disproved in the 1960s by NASA's Mariner missions. Mariner 4, 6, and 7, and the Mariner 9 orbiter (1972), did not capture images of canals but instead showed a cratered Martian surface.

25|$|In September 1877, (a perihelic {{opposition}} of Mars occurred on September 5), Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli published the first detailed map of Mars. These maps notably contained features he called canali ("channels"), that were later {{shown to be}} an <b>optical</b> <b>illusion.</b> These canali were supposedly long straight lines {{on the surface of}} Mars to which he gave names of famous rivers on Earth. His term was popularly mistranslated as canals, and so started the Martian canal controversy.|$|E
25|$|Another type of <b>optical</b> <b>illusion</b> {{exploits}} broken {{patterns to}} trick the mind into perceiving symmetries or asymmetries {{that are not}} present. Examples include the café wall, Ehrenstein, Fraser spiral, Poggendorff, and Zöllner illusions. Related, but not strictly illusions, are patterns that occur due to the superimposition of periodic structures. For example, transparent tissues with a grid structure produce shapes known as moiré patterns, while the superimposition of periodic transparent patterns comprising parallel opaque lines or curves produces line moiré patterns.|$|E
25|$|In 1937 Schiaparelli {{collaborated with}} the artist Jean Cocteau to produce two of her most notable art-themed designs for that year's Autumn collection. An evening jacket was {{embroidered}} with a female figure with one hand caressing the waist of the wearer, and long blonde hair cascading down one sleeve. A long evening coat featured two profiles facing each other, creating the <b>optical</b> <b>illusion</b> of a vase of roses.

25|$|The main atrium of the Lanyon {{building}} houses a marble statue of Galileo. Most notable for his advances in Physics, {{he was also}} a deep thinker and Philosopher, resulting in the statue portrayed seated. It has been said that rubbing the statue's outstretched right foot brings the student good luck. Recent rumours have been spreading about the student body that when the clock above Galileo's head strikes the eleventh minute of the eleventh hour, the statue appears to wink. Some have put this down to simply being an <b>optical</b> <b>illusion.</b>|$|E
25|$|Attribute {{substitution}} {{explains the}} persistence of some illusions. For example, when subjects judge the size of two figures in a perspective picture, their apparent sizes can be distorted by the 3D context, making a convincing <b>optical</b> <b>illusion.</b> The theory states that the three-dimensional size of the figure (which is accessible because it is automatically computed by the visual system) is substituted for its two-dimensional size on the page. Experienced painters and photographers are less susceptible to this illusion, because the two-dimensional size is more accessible to their perception.|$|E

50|$|Unlike <b>optical</b> <b>illusions</b> that {{utilize the}} {{misinterpretation}} {{of the human}} brain to create illusionary perception different from the physical measurement, illusion optics changes the optical response or properties of objects. Illusion optic devices make these changes happen. Although both these terms deal with illusions, Illusion optics deal with the refraction and reflection of light, whereas while <b>optical</b> <b>illusions</b> are basically mind tricks.|$|R

25|$|Another example where visual {{appearance}} {{is at odds}} with measurement comes from the observation of apparent superluminal motion in various radio galaxies, BL Lac objects, quasars, and other astronomical objects that eject relativistic-speed jets of matter at narrow angles with respect to the viewer. An <b>optical</b> <b>illusion</b> results giving the appearance of faster than light travel. In Fig.1‑14, galaxy M87 streams out a high-speed jet of subatomic particles almost directly towards us, but Penrose–Terrell rotation causes the jet to appear to be moving laterally in the same manner that the appearance of the cube in Fig.1‑13 has been stretched out.|$|E
25|$|Whymper was {{convinced}} that the Matterhorn's precipitous appearance when viewed from Zermatt was an <b>optical</b> <b>illusion,</b> and that the dip of the strata, which on the Italian side formed a continuous series of overhangs, should make the opposite side a natural staircase. This party of four was joined by Hudson and Croz, and the inexperienced Douglas Hadow. Their attempt by what is now the normal route, the Hörnli ridge, met with success on 14 July 1865, only days before an Italian party. On the descent, Hadow slipped and fell onto Croz, dislodging him and dragging Douglas and Hudson to their deaths; the rope parted, saving the other three.|$|E
25|$|The finest artistic {{manifestation of}} the Baroque in Poland is its architecture, {{developed}} under the Italian, Dutch, German and French influence, with a strong local component. The new elaborate residential and religious compounds, or the rebuilding of older, war-damaged structures, were financed by magnates and the Church. St. Peter and St. Paul's Church in Vilnius or Church of St. Anthony of Padua at Czerniaków, Warsaw are examples of the Baroque's richly decorative (see stucco) style. Vault or dome painting, subordinate to the overall aesthetic design, compounded the impression by using <b>optical</b> <b>illusion</b> effects. Sculpture also had the primary function of complementing {{the design of the}} interiors.|$|E
