5|$|The Returners set out {{to search}} for Terra and {{eventually}} trace her {{to the city of}} Zozo, though they are still shocked by her apparent existence as an esper. There, they also meet the esper Ramuh, who tells them that if they free various other espers from the Magitek Research Facility in the Empire's capital, Vector, they may find <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> help Terra. Vector is on the southern continent, to which the Empire does not allow maritime access, so the Returners go to the Opera House and recruit Setzer Gabbiani, who {{is believed to be the}} owner of the Blackjack, the only airship in the world. They then travel to Vector and attempt to rescue several espers, including Maduin, who is revealed to be Terra's father. However, the espers are already dying from the experiments at Vector, and choose instead to give their lives to transform into magicite—the crystallized remains of the espers' essences that form when they die and allow others to use their powers. The dying espers bestow their magicite upon the Returners. Before the group can then escape, Kefka arrives and causes the Returners, including Locke, to momentarily doubt Celes' loyalty, much to her anguish. However, she provides proof to them of her support by covering for the group while the rest escape. The rest of the group then returns to Zozo, where Terra reacts to the magicite of her father, prompting her to gain knowledge of her past and accept herself as the half-human, half-esper child of Maduin and a human woman.|$|E

5|$|The next day, Aya {{sees the}} orange {{mass of people}} from the park enter the city water supply. She goes to Dr. Klamp one more time, and discovers that Dr. Klamp has {{engineered}} special sperm for Eve so that she can create the Ultimate Being. He then spontaneously combusts. Aya finds Eve {{in another part of the}} museum, where the orange mass has surrounded her, forming an impermeable shield to protect her while the Ultimate Being gestates within her. After several failed attempts to attack Eve, the military asks Aya to attack her from a chopper, as she is the only <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> get close without combusting. The plan works, but Aya has to personally finish the fight on a now-wrecked Statue of Liberty, where Eve finally succumbs to necrosis due to her unstable cells. As Aya rests on a naval vessel, the Ultimate Being is born and attacks the surrounding ships. Aya does battle with the Ultimate Being, but its mitochondria causes it to evolve at an alarming rate. Aya sets the vessel's boiler pressure dangerously high, so as to destroy it with the Ultimate Being on board.|$|E

25|$|According to {{the further}} {{explanations}} of Xiong's student Mou Zongsan, Heaven {{is not merely}} sky, and just like the God of the Judaic and Hellenistic-Christian tradition {{is not one of}} the beings in the world. However, unlike the God of these religions, the God of Confucianism is not outside the world either, but is within humans, which is the primary concern of Confucianism, and other beings in the world. Tian is the ontological substance of reality, is immanent in every human being as the human nature (ren), but the human being on the phenomenal level is not identical with its metaphysical essence. Mencius stated that «the <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> fully realize one's heart/mind can understand one's nature, and the <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> understand one's own nature can know Tian»; Tian is within us, but before we fulfill our heart/mind and know our nature, Heaven still appears transcendent to us. Mou cites Max Muller that «a human being itself is potentially a God, a God one presently ought to become» to reflect th idea of the relationship of God and humanity in Confucianism and other Eastern religions. What is crucial is to transcend the phenomenon to reach Tian.|$|E

25|$|Informal cricket in the UK {{is often}} known as garden cricket and is played in gardens and {{recreation}} grounds around the country.

Typically this will be played with a tennis ball or other soft bouncy ball, and modified rules, such as one hand one bounce are often employed. The length of the wicket will typically be roughly 15 metres, and the non-bowling fielders will be encircled close round the bat looking for a catching chance.|$|E
