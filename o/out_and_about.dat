25|$|Notwithstanding such {{attempts}} {{to protect the}} maidenly virtue of Roman girls, there is little anecdotal or artistic evidence of their use or effective imposition.

25|$|Melbourne Cup day is {{a public}} holiday for all working within {{metropolitan}} Melbourne and some parts of regional Victoria, but not for some country Victorian cities and towns which hold their own spring carnivals. For Federal Public Servants it is also observed as a holiday in {{the entire state of}} Victoria, and from 2007 to 2009 also in the Australian Capital Territory known as Family and Community Day replacing Picnic Day. The Melbourne cup captures the public's imagination to the extent that people whether at work, home, school, or <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>about</b> usually stop to watch or listen to the great race. Many people from outside of Melbourne take a half or full day off work to celebrate the occasion. Many people feel that the day should be a national public holiday as Sick leave is said to increase on the day and productivity wanes.|$|E

500|$|As {{well as from}} Regnault, {{the work}} borrows {{elements}} from Titian, Rubens and classical sculpture. The figures are painted as groups, and while each figure and group of figures is carefully arranged and painted, the combination of groups gives {{the appearance of a}} confused mass surrounding the ship when the painting is viewed as a whole. (Etty's 1958 biographer Dennis Farr comments that [...] contains elements enough for three or four paintings no less ambitious but more maturely planned.") The scene includes a number of images based on drawings Etty had sketched while <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>about</b> in London, such as the mother holding up her baby to see the view and the crowd on the roof of a temple in the background. It also includes elements of European painting that Etty had learned while copying Old Master artworks as a student, such as the putti in the sky. Etty greatly admired the Venetian school, and the painting includes obvious borrowings from Titian and other Venetian artists. It also contains a number of elements from the paintings of Rubens, such as the Nereids and Triton in the sea in front of the ship.|$|E
500|$|The Daily Telegraphs Gerard O'Donovan {{agreed that}} [...] "June Brown, as Dot, was mesmerising", but was {{similarly}} {{critical of the}} episode as a whole, concluding: [...] "Overall [...] the feeling couldn’t be avoided that in the greater scheme of things this was a fuss over nothing. Had it been a swan song, {{it would have been}} a worthy one. But doubtless Dot will be <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>about</b> again tonight, fag in hand, quoting from the Good Book. Enjoyable as this Albert Square indulgence was, I suspect that most fans will be hoping this one-hander remains a one-off." [...] Leigh Holmwood for The Guardian suggested that viewers may have agreed with O'Donovan's assessment, highlighting the fact that the episode received only 8.7million viewers, compared to 9.4million watching EastEnders the previous week. A 2003 episode centred around Dot also resulted in a notable ratings slump. The New Year episode, which detailed her childhood evacuation to the countryside, received just 8.1million viewers, compared with 12.2m the previous evening and 16m on Christmas Day. Prior to this, however, a 2002 two-hander episode featuring just Dot and Sonia Jackson (Natalie Cassidy) was watched by 11.5million viewers, with an almost 60% share of viewers in the timeslot.|$|E
500|$|The Guardian Gareth McLean {{described}} the episode as a [...] "bold move" [...] {{on the part}} of the EastEnders producers in deviating from the serial's usual format, and found it to be [...] "compelling and brave", but [...] "not as convincing as it should be". The Daily Telegraph Gerard O'Donovan felt that Brown gave a [...] "mesmerising" [...] performance, but was critical of the episode as a whole, concluding: [...] "Overall [...] the feeling couldn't be avoided that in the greater scheme of things this was a fuss over nothing.

[...] Leigh Holmwood for The Guardian suggested that viewers may have agreed with O'Donovan's assessment, highlighting the fact that the episode received only 8.7million viewers, compared to 9.4million watching EastEnders the previous week. O'Donovan compared the episode to Krapp's Last Tape, saying [...] "it must be said there were quite a few moments of positively (or perhaps that should be negatively) Beckettian bleakness here as Dot recalled, in painfully vivid detail, how time and time again 'life took away everything I ever cared about' and 'all that I ever 'ad, I lorst'." ...|$|E

2500|$|USA Today concluded: [...] "Sexy, {{witty and}} unabashedly peculiar, True Blood is a blood-drenched Southern Gothic romantic parable {{set in a}} world where vampires are <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>about</b> and campaigning for equal rights.

That's even one of the reasons why, even though his name is Mario, I call him Perez Jr. I want him to have an alter ego as well so when people do say things that are hurtful about his dad or hurtful about him hopefully it won't hurt as much because they don't really know him. Those people know you as Perez Jr. but you're not Perez Jr. so it doesn't matter what they say." ...|$|E
2500|$|Harple also championed a new {{dimension}} of the social media phenomenon: individually customizable, highly mobile, location-based experiences. [...] "Rather than sitting indoors chatting to friends on an PC-based service - you can be <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>about</b> seeing who is nearby, {{what they are doing}} and where you could go - all in real time", he commented. An early developer, investor, and advocate of mobile social networking technology, he saw it growing faster outside of the US, telling the New York Times in 2008, [...] "I moved to Europe because I thought the U.S. venture capital community -- which I was a part of -- was myopic," [...] he said.

2500|$|The UK {{pig herd}} is declining, {{and there are}} now some {{individual}} pig farms in the US that have more sows than {{there are in the}} UK as a whole. Pigs often used to be kept indoors throughout their lives, but welfare concerns and increased costs have led to more outdoor units, and by 2002 30% of sows were outdoors. [...] In many countries sows are kept tethered in individual stalls, but this system was banned in the UK in 1999 on animal welfare grounds. [...] Indoor sows are housed in groups. [...] Each sow produces an average of 24 piglets a year and will be pregnant or lactating for 340 days a year. [...] This intensive production wears the sows <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>about</b> 40% of them need to be replaced each year.|$|E

2500|$|Peel {{wrote that}} [...] "The Festive 50 {{dates back to}} what was doubtless a crisp September morning in the early-to-mid Seventies, when John Walters and I were musing on life in his uniquely squalid office. In our waggish way, we decided to mock the enthusiasm of the Radio 1 {{management}} of the time for programmes with alliterative titles. Content, we felt, was of less importance than a snappy Radio Times billing. In {{the course of our}} historic meeting we had, I imagine, some fine reasons for dismissing the idea of a Festive 40 and going instead for a Festive 50, a decision that was to ruin my Decembers for years to come, condemning me to night after night at home with a ledger, when I could have been <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>about</b> having fun, fun, fun." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hassam became {{close friends}} with fellow American Impressionist artists J. Alden Weir and John Henry Twachtman, {{whom he met}} through the American Water Color Society, and over the {{following}} months he made many connections in the art community through other art societies and social clubs. He contributed works from his European stay to several exhibitions and shows. Hassam enthusiastically painted the genteel urban atmosphere of New York that he encountered {{within walking distance of}} his apartment, and avoided the squalor of the lower-class neighborhoods. He proclaimed that [...] "New York is the most beautiful city in the world. There is no boulevard in all Paris that compares to our own Fifth Avenue...the average American still fails to appreciate the beauty of his own country." [...] He captured well-dressed men in bowler hats and top hats, fashionable women and children <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>about,</b> and horse-drawn cabs slowly making their way along crowded thoroughfares lined by commercial buildings (which were generally less than six stories high at that time). Hassam's primary focus would forever continue to be [...] "humanity in motion". He never doubted his own artistic development and his subjects, remaining confident in his instinctual choices throughout his life.|$|E
2500|$|New Zealand's Naultinus {{are highly}} prized by {{international}} lizard collectors for three main reasons; firstly {{they have very}} attractive colouration and indeed, have been referred to by some as [...] "the world's most beautiful geckos". Secondly, they are day active and so are <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>about</b> when their keepers are awake and thirdly, they are cold tolerant, coming from New Zealand's strongly seasonal temperate habitats – since most collectors are wealthy hobbyists in developed countries in places like North America, Europe and Japan – also temperate areas – this means they do not require heat lamps when kept in terrariums. All this adds up to strong demand for these animals {{on the black market}} for the illegal pet trade – [...] "dozens of these protected reptiles are poached from the wild each year, when even low-level poaching could mean the difference between survival and extinction for small, isolated populations". All endemic New Zealand lizard species including all species of Naultinus [...] are protected by law both under the New Zealand Wildlife Act (1953) and the United Nations Convention on the Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). In an effort to clamp down on continual poaching, DOC attempted to get tighter controls placed on trade in Naultinus in 2002 under the CITES agreement but the request was denied, however, fines and periods of imprisonment under the New Zealand Wildlife act and trade in endangered species acts were increased in 2004 in an attempt to deter further illegal collecting and trading of these animals.|$|E
