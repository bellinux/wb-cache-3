30|$|In this paper, we exploit a new {{artificial}} {{neural network}} (ANN)-based solution to apply jointly a physical carrier sensing adaptation (PCSA) and a transmit power control (TPC) {{in a way that}} preserves fairness between all the nodes in terms <b>of</b> throughput. <b>ANNs</b> [13] are commonly used to address a wide range of pattern recognition problems [14] including classification, clustering, and regression. However, the worth <b>of</b> <b>ANNs</b> to model complex and nonlinear problems is desirable for many real-world problems. In telecommunications domain, ANNs are adopted for a large number of applications [15], such as equalizers, adaptive beam-forming, self-organizing networks, network design and management, routing protocols, localization, etc. Furthermore, many data mining techniques make use <b>of</b> <b>ANNs</b> to derive meaning from complicated or imprecise data. In WLAN, the main applications <b>of</b> <b>ANNs</b> can be classified as follows: data rate adaptation [16], quality of service (QoS) provisioning [17], frame size adaptation [18], channel allocation [19], channel estimation [20], and indoor localization [21].|$|R
40|$|A {{frequently}} encountered problem {{during the}} application of artificial neural networks (ANNs) to various water resource problems is the limitation of the data sets required for the training stage <b>of</b> <b>ANNs.</b> This prevents ANNs from learning input and output data sets within different ranges, thus decreasing the prediction capability during the testing stage. In this article the well known ARMA models are used to generate synthetic series, and these series are incorporated into the training data sets <b>of</b> <b>ANNs.</b> The method {{is applied to the}} monthly mean river flow data of a station in the East Mediterranean region of Turkey. The forecasting accuracy of the future monthly flows carries significance because a water reservoir is planned for the downstream of this station. Because the available data record length is limited studies should be carried out to extend the training data set <b>of</b> <b>ANNs.</b> It is seen that the extension of input and output data sets in the training stage improves the accuracy <b>of</b> forecasting using <b>ANNs.</b> The introduction <b>of</b> periodicity components in the input layer also increases the forecasting accuracy <b>of</b> <b>ANNs.</b> Copyright # 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. key words: training data sets; synthetic flow generation; periodic component 1...|$|R
