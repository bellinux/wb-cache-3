5|$|The {{best fit}} for the shape of HAT-P-33b's orbit {{suggests}} that the orbit is slightly elliptical, as the planet's orbital eccentricity is fit to 0.148. However, because the star HAT-P-33 has such {{a high level of}} jitter, it is difficult to constrain the planet's eccentricity with accuracy. Most of the planet's defined characteristics are based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>assumption</b> that HAT-P-33b has an elliptical orbit, although the planet's discoverers have also derived HAT-P-33b's characteristics <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>assumption</b> that the planet has a circular orbit. The elliptical model has been chosen because it is considered to be the most likely scenario.|$|E

If either condition fail, then nationalisation is undesirable. In delivering this warning, Russell emphasises the distinction between ownership and control. He points out that nationalisation – which would allow the citizens to collectively own an industry – would not guarantee any of them control over the industry. In the same way, shareholders own parts of companies, but the control of the company ultimately rests with the CEO (Russell 1938:235).|$|E

The mean oxidation number for the borons is then simply the ratio of hydrogen to boron in the molecule. For example, in diborane B2H6, the boron oxidation state is +3, but in decaborane B10H14, it is 7/5 or +1.4. In these compounds the oxidation state of boron is often not a whole number.|$|E

However, by fitting a ram with a chest harness called a marking harness that holds a special crayon (or raddle, sometimes spelled reddle), ewes that have been mounted are marked with a color.
