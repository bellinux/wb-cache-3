40|$|The {{chemical}} environment of cells {{is an extremely}} complex and multifaceted system that includes many types of proteins, lipids, nucleic acids and various other components. With the final aim of studying these components in detail, we have developed multiband plasmonic antennas, which are suitable for highly sensitive surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and are activated by {{a wide range of}} excitation wavelengths. The three-dimensional hollow nanoantennas were produced on an <b>optical</b> <b>resist</b> by a secondary electron lithography approach, generated by fast ion-beam milling on the polymer and then covered with silver in order to obtain plasmonic functionalities. The optical properties of these structures have been studied through finite element analysis simulations that demonstrated the presence of broadband absorption and multiband enhancement due to the unusual geometry of the antennas. The enhancement was confirmed by SERS measurements, which showed a large enhancement of the vibrational features both in the case of resonant excitation and out-of-resonance excitation. Such characteristics indicate that these structures are potential candidates for plasmonic enhancers in multifunctional opto-electronic biosensors...|$|E
40|$|A high {{performance}} three-dimensional (3 -D) CMOS integrated circuit {{has been successfully}} fabricated. The bottom layer transistors are fabricated on Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI) and top layer transistors are fabricated on Large-Grain Polysilicon-On-Insulator (LPSOI) film, with oxide as the interlayer dielectric. The LPSOI film is formed by the re-crystallization of an amorphous silicon through nickel-seed Metal Induced Lateral Crystallization (MILC) at an elevated temperature. To fabricate a {{high performance}} circuit, electron beam (e-beam) direct write technique is employed to define the channel area and gate electrode in sub-micron scales. Two new ideas are developed to improve the process. 1) The e-beam and <b>optical</b> <b>resist</b> mix-and-match technique demonstrates the improvement of process throughout. 2) A high-resolution positive e-beam resist enhances a negative resist resolution, so fine and dense bright-field pattern can be defined. To demonstrate the feasibility of the MILC technology, single-gate thin film transistors have been fabricated. The understanding {{of the process and}} design limitation is critical and useful in novel layout and process design. The first novel structure fabricated by the MILC technique is the gate-all-around transistor. It exhibits better electrical performance than the single gate transistors and effectively suppresses short channel effect. A high performance and low power 3 -D structure has been fabricated. The top layer LPSOI devices have similar electrical characteristics to the bottom layer SOI devices. Compared with the conventional 2 -D CMOS SOI circuits, 3 -D circuits such as, ring-oscillators, shift registers and SRAM cells, show significant reduction in circuit area, shorter propagation delay and lower dynamic power consumption. The grain boundary distribution and surface roughness were observed using the Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and Secondary Electron Microscopy (SEM). A physical mobility model is developed to predict the polysilicon grain size within the MILC regions. The variation in electrical performance may be attributed to the grain boundary effect...|$|E
40|$|In this {{proposed}} process, {{there is no}} wet and baking pro-cess. It is beneficial to prevent wet contamination during the lithography process. Furthermore, exclusion n pre/ post baking process and development process implify an ordinary lithography process. Patterned ye film on SiO 2 substrate after CF 4 is shown in Fig. 10. Patterned ye film is observed on the substrate in this scanning electron microscope (SEM) photograph. Slightly roughened ye film surface is also observed; how-ever, the pattern shape was kept like the original drawing pattern. In Fig. 11, SiO 2 surface after removing dye resist is shown. A ~m order line and space pattern is observed. By our laser equipment, a laser beam was focused about 1. 5 ~m diameter. It is {{difficult to get a}} narrower dye mask pat-tern. However, submicrometer pattern dye film (10) has been observed using an optical recording disk head. It is expected that more narrow pattern lithography will be made using short wavelength laser with automatic self-focused optics such as an optical disk head. Conclusion Deposited ye film's CF 4 gas etching durability is inves-tigated. The etching rate for dye film is deemed small enough for S iQ and Si lithography process with CF 4 dry etching. The novel all dry lithography process is proposed based on dye film properties. Using laser beam scannings, a line and space pattern are drawn on a dye film with heat-mode abrasion. Drawn pat-terns are carved on SiO 2 and Si substrates with dye film masks by the all-dry etching process. A ~m order lithogra-phy pattern is observed with SEM.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{introduces a}} kind of new gray-scale technology. The new gray-scale technology uses a carbon- based light-attenuating material. This material can reach a very high optical density (̃ 3. 0) for deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography applications. This property is out {{the reach of the}} often-used High-Energy-Beam-Sensitive (HEBS) gray-scale mask. HEBS gray-scale mask cannot be used for wavelength below 300 nm and it cannot provide enough optical density at wavelengths shorter than 350 nm for high-resolution component fabrication. Higher optical density at shorter wavelengths means that the components of more levels and with higher resolution are achievable. Compared with Binary Half-Tone (BHT) gray-scale mask, the new mask offers a much higher resolution. Two-beam-current method is invented for the e-beam writing in the fabrication of gray-scale masks. Compared with the simpler single-current method, two-beam-current method offers two important advantages. First it can achieve a much larger dynamic range for the e-beam exposure. The second advantage is the writing time for a gray-scale mask could be reduced significantly when a large pattern is to be written. By applying the new gray-scale mask in DUV and UV lithography respectively, gray-scale patterns were successfully generated in <b>optical</b> <b>resists.</b> Finally devices were fabricated after the gray-scale patterns in resists were transferred into the substrate material in the etching step. Different micro-structures with different resolution and depth requirements have been fabricated successfully. The carbon-based material has a big hardness, comparable to diamond film, and stays at the quartz surface very firmly. The life time of the mask is comparable to the normal chrome mask used in semiconductor industry, and thus pretty long. This new gray-scale technology could also lead to lower-cost mass production of higher quality micro- and meso-scale micro-devices in different substrates, e. g. quartz and silicon et al...|$|R

40|$|Optical {{lithography}} {{is being}} pushed into a regime of extreme-numerical aperture (extreme-NA). The {{implications of the}} nonscalar effects of high-NA lithography (above 0. 50) have been discussed now for many years 1. This paper considers the consequences of imaging at numerical apertures above 0. 70 with the oblique imaging angles required for low k 1 lithography. A new scaling factor, kNA, is introduced to capture the impact of low k 1 imaging combined with extreme- NA optics. Extreme-imaging is defined as k 1 and kNA values approach 0. 25. Polarization effects combined with resist requirements for extreme-NA are addressed, especially {{as they relate to}} 157 nm lithography.

The novel feature of the SRD process is forming a sub-quarter micron gate with conventional optical lithography. We have obtained a 0. 18 µm gate using this process. Achieving a smaller gate length of 0. 1 um is very difficult with this process due to the pattern size shift of the sputtered SiO 2 opening. In this study, we use a collimated sputtering technique in the SRD process to reduce the pattern size shift. As a result, the pattern size shift of the SiO 2 opening decreases to 0. 02 µm allowing a 0. 1 µm gate length to be obtained by using conventional optical lithography.

In this paper, the laser preconditioning effect has been analyzed based on the defect-initialized damage mechanism that the author had put forward previously. Theoretical results show that an energy density scope (PEDS) exists in which the preconditioning laser can effectively improve the ARLID of optical films. In addition, when the energy density of the testing laser pulse is altered, the boundary of PEDS will change accordingly. Experimental results have verified these theoretical assumptions. PEDS will also become wider if the critical energy density of the preconditioning laser that can induce films' micro-damage increases, or the critical energy density of the preconditioning laser that can cause laser annealing decreases.
