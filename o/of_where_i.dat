She said in 2005: [...] "The mere fact that Magic Alex [...] arrived in Italy {{in the middle of the}} night without any prior knowledge <b>of</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> was staying made me extremely suspicious.

[...] The developments in Ianto's character were also reflected in the wardrobe choice. [...] "For series two," [...] comments Ray Holman, [...] "we evolved the look quite a lot, and now his suits {{come from all over the}} place. It's just a question <b>of</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> see something that looks right for Gareth, so I've brought him a suit from Savile Row and suits from Zara and Next. We realised we could be a bit more flash with Ianto now he's come out of the background and started to assert himself a bit more. So we moved him into coloured shirts and snazzier ties. He started off in white and grey shirts but we realised his skin tones can take the extra colour and now he's evolving into something much sharper, which looks really good filmed in high definition." ...|$|E

500|$|Pinkner {{thought the}} added musical element {{improved}} the episode, {{because it gave}} insights into each of the characters' psyches. According to Wyman and Pinkner, the [...] "episode {{was supposed to be}} a fantastical episode in the first place, and so the music supports the storytelling". Wyman continued in a different interview with the Los Angeles Times that [...] "Noirs traditionally are morality tales, and that's kind of what we're doing. We felt that that was a great way to get across Walter's mind frame and where his head is at right now, with his son missing". Other cast members also praised the added music. John Noble wrote [...] "It really deepened and blew the episode out even further in the direction we were already taking. We get [...] fractured take on the world and his condition now that Peter has left. The music really supports the storytelling". He added, [...] "It is like a mind-trip of Walter's. It is Walter trying to grapple with the fact that his son is gone". Jasika Nicole continued: [...] "I have a musical theater background, so I've been waiting for some moment in some realm <b>of</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> am in TV and film for this to happen and, you know, of course, when Glee came on the air I was like, 'Great, that was my chance,' and I'm in this show, which I love this show, but I'm never going to sing and dance in this show. And I did! It's so awesome!" [...] Swerling called it [...] "the longest and possibly most difficult episode of the season" [...] to create.|$|E

I love you {{now more than ever}} before". [...] Lennon went to New York with McCartney shortly after, but as Cynthia was specifically not invited, a trip to Pesaro, in Italy, was arranged with her mother. After an evening with Italian hotelier Roberto Bassanini, Mardas was waiting at the hotel to break the news that Lennon was planning to sue for divorce on grounds of adultery, seek sole custody of Julian, and [...] "send her back to Hoylake". She said in 2005: [...] "The mere fact that 'Magic Alex' [...] arrived in Italy {{in the middle of the}} night without any prior knowledge <b>of</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> was staying made me extremely suspicious. I was being coerced into making it easy" ... "to accuse me of doing something that would make them not look so bad." [...] As Lennon had initiated divorce proceedings, it prompted her to exclaim: [...] "Suing me for divorce? On what grounds is he suing me?" [...] When the news of Ono's pregnancy broke, Cynthia started her own divorce proceedings against Lennon on 22 August 1968. The financial settlement was hampered by Lennon's refusing to offer any more than £75,000 (equivalent to £ in [...] )., telling her on the phone that the payment was akin to winning the football pools and that she was not worth any more. The settlement was then raised to £100,000 (equivalent to £ in [...] )., £2,400 annually (equivalent to £ in [...] )., and custody of Julian. Another £100,000 (equivalent to £ in [...] ). was put into a trust fund which Julian would inherit when he was 21. Until that time, his mother would receive the interest payments. Their decree nisi was granted on 8 November 1968. The trust fund had one codicil, which provided for any further children by Lennon, so when Sean Lennon was born in 1975, Julian's inheritance was cut to £50,000 (equivalent to £ in [...] )..|$|E
