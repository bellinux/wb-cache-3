5|$|Over the years, Madagascar has had {{different}} language policies under different influences of authority. The indigenous language of Madagascar, Malagasy, was the predominant language {{on the island}} until the French colonization in 1897. Malagasy has developed throughout the decades from an <b>oral</b> <b>language</b> to a language that has a written system (Latin orthography), a change that was enforced by King Radama I, in 1823.|$|E
5|$|A common {{misconception}} is that {{signs are}} iconically self-explanatory, {{that they are}} a transparent imitation of what they mean, or even that they are pantomime. In fact, many signs bear no resemblance to their referent, either because they were originally arbitrary symbols or because their iconicity has been obscured over time. Even so, in ASL iconicity plays a significant role; a high percentage of signs resemble their referents in some way. This {{may be due to the}} fact that the medium of sign—three-dimensional space—naturally allows more iconicity than <b>oral</b> <b>language.</b>|$|E
5|$|ASL {{originated}} in the early 19th century in the American School for the Deaf (ASD) in Hartford, Connecticut, from a situation of language contact. Since then, ASL use has propagated widely via schools for the deaf and Deaf community organizations. Despite its wide use, no accurate count of ASL users has been taken, though reliable estimates for American ASL users range from 250,000 to 500,000 persons, including a number of children of deaf adults. ASL users face stigma due to beliefs in the superiority of <b>oral</b> <b>language</b> to sign language, {{compounded by the fact}} that ASL is often glossed in English due to the lack of a standard writing system.|$|E
50|$|Sign {{languages}} such as American Sign Language (ASL) {{are characterized}} by phonological processes analogous to, yet dissimilar from those of <b>oral</b> <b>languages.</b> Although there is a qualitative difference from <b>oral</b> <b>languages</b> in that sign-language phonemes are not based on sound, and are spatial {{in addition to being}} temporal, they fulfill the same role as phonemes in <b>oral</b> <b>languages.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In South Africa, {{manually}} coded {{language is}} used in education, as a bridge between South African Sign Language (SASL) and the eleven official <b>oral</b> <b>languages</b> of the country. These codes apply the signs of SASL to the grammar of the <b>oral</b> <b>languages,</b> resulting in Signed English, Signed Afrikaans, Signed Xhosa, Signed Zulu, etc. They are not a natural form of communication among deaf people.|$|R
50|$|Manual {{communication}} is employed in sign languages and in {{systems that are}} codes for <b>oral</b> <b>languages</b> (see Manually Coded Language).|$|R
25|$|The written {{forms of}} {{language}} {{can be considered}} another modality. Sign languages do not have widely accepted written forms, so deaf individuals learn {{to read and write}} an <b>oral</b> <b>language.</b> This is known as sign–print bilingualism—a deaf individual has fluency in (at least) one sign language as their primary language and has literacy skills in the written form of (at least) one <b>oral</b> <b>language,</b> without access to other resources of the <b>oral</b> <b>language</b> that are gained through auditory stimuli. Orthographic systems employ the morphology, syntax, lexical choices, and often phonetic representation of their target language in at least superficial ways; one must learn these new features of the target language in order to read or write. In communities where there is standardized education for the deaf, such as the United States and the Netherlands, deaf individuals do gain skill sets in reading and writing in the <b>oral</b> <b>language</b> of the community. In such a state, bilingualism is achieved between a sign language and the written form of the community's <b>oral</b> <b>language.</b> In this view, all sign–print bilinguals are bimodal bilinguals, but all bimodal bilinguals may not be sign–print bilinguals.|$|E
25|$|Fingerspelling {{is used in}} {{different}} sign languages and registers for different purposes. It {{may be used to}} represent words from an <b>oral</b> <b>language</b> which have no sign equivalent, or for emphasis, clarification, or when teaching or learning a sign language.|$|E
25|$|The Romani {{language}} has {{for most of}} its history been an entirely <b>oral</b> <b>language,</b> with no written form in common use.

40|$|In this {{document}} {{we will discuss}} the complexity around education for the deaf. The most important issue to consider is about the long process students have to assume when they learn English as a foreign language. All human beings acquire a mother tongue during their {{first few years of}} life; for many of the hearing impaired, the mother tongue is a sign language code that differs according to place of origin. Sign languages are significantly disparate from <b>oral</b> <b>languages</b> in that they are not produced or perceived {{in the same way as}} <b>oral</b> <b>languages.</b> This is to say, sign languages rely on visual perception, whereas <b>oral</b> <b>languages</b> depend on auditory perception. As a reflection we discuss about how effective is for deaf students to learn a language they will never speak, they will never listen and which is not communicatively useful abroad...|$|R

25|$|It is the <b>oral</b> <b>language</b> of {{instruction}} in Chinese schools in Hong Kong and Macau, and is used extensively in Cantonese-speaking households. Cantonese-language media (Hong Kong films, television serials, and Cantopop), isolation from the other regions of China, local identity, and the non-Mandarin speaking Cantonese diaspora in Hong Kong and abroad give the language a unique identity. Colloquial Hong Kong Cantonese often incorporates English words due to historical British influences.|$|E
25|$|Research {{has found}} {{strong support for}} the idea that spoken {{language}} and signing depend on similar neural structures. Patients who used sign language, and who suffered from a left-hemisphere lesion, showed the same disorders with their sign language as vocal patients did with their <b>oral</b> <b>language.</b> Other researchers found that the same left-hemisphere brain regions were active during sign language as during the use of vocal or written language.|$|E
25|$|Sign {{language}} and <b>oral</b> <b>language</b> experience in bimodal bilinguals are {{shown to have}} separate effects on activation patterns within the superior temporal sulcus when recognizing facial expressions. Additionally, hearing signers (individuals who can hear and also speak sign language) do not show the strong left-lateralizated activation for facial expression recognition that has been found within deaf signers. This indicates that both sign language experience and deafness can affect the neural organization for recognizing facial expressions.|$|E

25|$|Studies in {{this area}} {{generally}} compare the behaviour or brain activity in normally hearing monolingual speakers of an <b>oral</b> <b>language,</b> genetically deaf, native signers, and normally hearing bimodal bilinguals. With the use of functional Near-Infrared Imaging (fNIR), Kovelman (2009) compared the performance and brain activity of these three groups in picture-naming tasks. These researchers found that, although performance in all groups was similar, neuroimaging revealed that bilinguals showed greater signal intensity within the posterior temporal regions (Wernicke's area) while using both languages in rapid alternation than when they were only using one language.|$|E
25|$|Neuroscientific {{research}} on bimodal individuals—those who speak one <b>oral</b> <b>language</b> and one sign language—has been carried out. PET scans from these {{studies show that}} there is a separate region in the brain for working memory related to sign language production and use. These studies also find that bimodal individuals use different areas of the right hemisphere depending on whether they are speaking using verbal language or gesticulating using sign language. Studies with bimodal bilinguals have also provided insight into the tip of the tongue phenomenon and into patterns of neural activity when recognizing facial expressions.|$|E
25|$|A {{study by}} Conklin and Wilkins shows growth and {{advances}} in reading levels among elementary students when using a guided reading approach.

Gabl, Kaiser, Long and Roemer found similar results when providing reading intervention in the form of guided reading groups to grade two and grade four students. The results showed an increase in reading fluency and comprehension after using flexible grouping in guided reading.|$|E
