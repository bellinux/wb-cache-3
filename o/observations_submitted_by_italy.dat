All concerns related to human and animal health or the environment raised <b>by</b> <b>Italy</b> were already addressed in previous scientific opinions of the EFSA GMO Panel on maize MON 810 while other concerns relate to co-existence and thus fall outside the remit of EFSA. Therefore, the EFSA GMO Panel concludes that, based on the documentation <b>submitted</b> <b>by</b> <b>Italy,</b> there is no specific scientific evidence, in terms of risk to human and animal health or the environment, that would support the notification of an emergency measure under Article 34 of Regulation (EC) No 1829 / 2003 and that would invalidate its previous risk assessments of maize MON 81...|$|R
40|$|Powered by {{advances}} of technology, today’s Citizen Science projects cover {{a wide range}} of thematic areas and are carried out from local to global levels. This wealth of activities creates an abundance of data, for example, in the forms of <b>observations</b> <b>submitted</b> <b>by</b> mobile phones; readings of low-cost sensors; or more general information about peoples’ activities. The management and possible sharing of this data has become a research topic in its own right. We conducted a survey in the summer of 2015 in order to collectively analyze the state of play in Citizen Science. This paper summarizes our main findings related to data access, standardization and data preservation. We provide examples of good practices in each of these areas and outline actions to address identified challenges. JRC. B. 6 -Digital Econom...|$|R

The aim of the proposal was to regulate trade in nests of four species (Collocalia fuciphaga, Collocalia germani, Collocalia maxima and Collocalia unicolor), trade that has increased notably in the past 10 years. The inclusion of these four species was proposed in accordance with Article II. 2 (a) and {{the inclusion of the}} rest of the genus in accordance with Article II. 2 (b) of the Convention. 3. The proposal was withdrawn <b>by</b> <b>Italy.</b> However a resolution on the conservation of these birds was drafted, in collaboration with range States, and was adopted by the Conference of the Parties as Resolu-tion Conf. 9. 15 (Annex 1). 4. In Resolution Conf. 9. 15 the Conference of the Parties initiated two different courses of action. Firstly, it urged range States to: 5. – encourage scientific research to promote the sustainability of nest harvesting through standard-ized management programmes; 6. – explore ways of enhancing participation of repre-sentatives of the bird-nest industry in swiftlet con-servation and sustainable-use programmes; and 7. – review regulations controlling harvesting of wild-breeding swiftlet populations, in accordance with the results of the scientific research carried out under paragraph 5. 8.

The discussion was based on the Rapporteur's report and written <b>observations</b> <b>submitted</b> <b>by</b> several experts. In relation to the place of performance (III. - 2 : 101 of the DCFR) there was a disagreement as to the substantive reasoning underlying paragraph 3 of the article.

Regarding the time of performance, the Group agreed to suspend the discussion pending further progress in the negotiations on the proposal for the Consumer Rights Directive. In relation to the order of Performance (III. - 2 : 104 of the DCFR), the Group decided to add a new paragraph modelled on paragraph 2 of Art. 6. 1. 4 of the UNIDROIT Principles.

40|$|One of {{the many}} {{benefits}} of citizen science projects is the capacity they hold for facilitating data collection {{on a grand scale}} and thereby enabling scientists to answer questions they would otherwise not been able to address. Nature's Notebook, the plant and animal phenology observing program of the USA National Phenology Network (USA-NPN) suitable for scientists and non-scientists alike, offers scientifically-vetted data collection protocols and infrastructure and mechanisms to quickly reach out to hundreds to thousands of potential contributors. The USA-NPN has recently partnered with several research teams to engage participants in contributing to specific studies. In one example, a team of scientists from NASA, the New Mexico Department of Health, and universities in Arizona, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and California are using juniper phenology <b>observations</b> <b>submitted</b> <b>by</b> Nature's Notebookparticipants to improve predictions of pollen release and inform asthma and allergy alerts. In a second effort, researchers from the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science are engaging Nature's Notebookparticipants in tracking leafing phenophases of poplars across the U. S. These observations will be compared to information acquired via satellite imagery and used to determine geographic areas where the tree species are most and least adapted to predicted climate change. Researchers in these partnerships receive benefits primarily in the form of ground observations. Launched in 2010, the juniper pollen effort has engaged participants in several western states and has yielded thousands of observations that can play a role in model ground validation. Periodic evaluation of these observations has prompted the team to improve and enhance the materials that participants receive, in an effort to boost data quality. The poplar project is formally launching in spring of 2013 and will run for three years; preliminary findings from 2013 will be presented. Participants in these special campaigns benefit through direct engagement in science. This form of researcher partnership has now been successfully pilot-tested and implemented in several instances, and provides a template for future research project campaigns...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} issues of {{creating}} a publicly accessible Web interface to a remote autonomous robot: the Bradford Robotic Telescope. The robot is situated on Mount Teide, {{on the island of}} Tenerife, Spain. Its mission is to provide interactive access to the stars to people who would otherwise not be able to appreciate the wonders of the night sky due to light pollution. Whenever weather and darkness permits, the robot processes the <b>observation</b> requests <b>submitted</b> <b>by</b> users via the Internet, operating all the hardware including the dome, telescope mount and cameras. The question of how to enable a content rich high quality dialogue between one robot and thousands of users is explored and divided into seven areas of research. How to design a Web site enabling high quality interaction with the user, how to enable users to request service from a robot, how to store and manage all the user and robot generated data, how to enable communication between the Web interface and the robot, how to schedule many observation requests in the best order, how to support a constant dialogue between the robot and users to engage users in the robot's work, and how to present and display users' completed observations. These seven areas of research are investigated; solutions are presented and their implementations examined and evaluated for their suitability and performance with the Bradford Robotic Telescope, and for how they might perform for any job-based remote robot.
