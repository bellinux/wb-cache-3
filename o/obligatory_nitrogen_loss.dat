Ten patients with SCI and 20 controls with nonspinal cord injury (NSCI) matched for time, sex, age, and injury severity score (ISS) were admitted to our Level I trauma center. In both groups, total nutritional support was delivered within 72 hours of admission based on predicted energy expenditures (PEE = Harris-Benedict equation x 1. 2 x 1. 6) and 2 g of protein/kg of ideal body weight (IBW). Subsequent changes in nutrient de-livery were based on NB. No SCI patient established positive NB during the 7 -week period following injury despite an aver-age delivery of 2. 4 g of protein/kg IBW and 120 % of the PEE {{at the time of}} peak negative NB (- 10. 5).

40|$|The eastern {{tropical}} South Pacific (ETSP) upwelling {{region is}} one of the ocean’s largest sinks of fixed nitrogen, which is lost as N 2 via the anaerobic processes of anammox and denitrification. One-third of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>loss</b> occurs in productive shelf waters stimulated by organic matter export as a result of eastern boundary upwelling. Offshore, <b>nitrogen</b> <b>loss</b> rates are lower, but due to its sheer size this area accounts for ~ 70 % of ETSP <b>nitrogen</b> <b>loss.</b> How <b>nitrogen</b> <b>loss</b> and primary production are regulated in the offshore ETSP region where coastal upwelling is less influential remains unclear. Mesoscale eddies, ubiquitous in the ETSP region, have been suggested to enhance vertical nutrient transport and thereby regulate primary productivity and hence organic matter export. Here, we investigated the impact of mesoscale eddies on anammox and denitrification activity using 15 N-labelled in situ incubation experiments. Anammox was shown to be the dominant <b>nitrogen</b> <b>loss</b> process, but varied across the eddy, whereas denitrification was below detection at all stations. Anammox rates at the eddy periphery were greater than at the center. Similarly, depth-integrated chlorophyll paralleled anammox activity, increasing at the periphery relative to the eddy center; suggestive of enhanced organic matter export along the periphery supporting <b>nitrogen</b> <b>loss.</b> This can be attributed to enhanced vertical nutrient transport caused by an eddy-driven submesoscale mechanism operating at the eddy periphery.

40|$|<b>Nitrogen</b> <b>losses</b> from {{agriculture}} in the Netherlands have to be strongly decreased because of national and international policy (e. g. Nitrate Directive).

40|$|Nitrogen {{emissions}} from agriculture are considered an important environmental problem in Denmark motivating consideration of different tax schemes as regulatory instruments.

The response to organic matter by the microbial community involved in <b>nitrogen</b> <b>loss</b> processes was evaluated using mesocosms of Chesapeake Bay sediments. Over the course of a 50 -day incubation, rates of anammox and denitrification were measured weekly using 15 N tracer incubations, and samples were collected for genetic analysis. Rates of both <b>nitrogen</b> <b>loss</b> processes and gene abundances associated with them corresponded loosely, probably because heterogeneities in sediments obscured a clear relationship. The rates of denitrification were stimulated more, and the fraction of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>loss</b> attributed to anammox slightly reduced, by the higher organic matter addition. Furthermore, the large organic matter pulse drove a significant and rapid shift in the denitrifier community composition as determined using a nirS microarray, indicating that the diversity of these organisms plays an essential role in responding to anthropogenic inputs.

This has created health risks and the eutrophication of waterways. Winter grazing of dairy cows on forage crops (such as kale and fodder beet) is a particularly “nutrient leaky” system. High stocking rates result in a build-up of soil nitrogen from the nitrogen loading in urine patches.

Better yet is to grow perennial plants such as grasses rather than corn; <b>nitrogen</b> <b>losses</b> are many times lower. Nitrogen pollution from concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) is a huge problem.|$|R

Results were obtained with the crop model STICS and the environmental model AGRIFLUX based on <b>nitrogen</b> <b>loss</b> simulations across a small groundwater catchment area (< 1 km(2)) located in the Lorraine region in France. Both models simulate the influences of leaching and cropping systems on <b>nitrogen</b> <b>losses</b> in a relevant manner. The authors conclude that limiting the simulations to areas where soils with {{a greater risk of}} leaching cover a significant spatial extent would likely yield acceptable results because those soils have more predictable leaching of nitrogen. In addition, the choice of an environmental model such as AGRIFLUX which requires fewer parameters and input variables seems more user-friendly for agro-environmental assessment. The authors then discuss additional challenges for non-scientists such as lack of parameter optimization, which is essential to accurately assessing nitrogen fluxes and indirectly not to limit the diversity of uses of simulated results. Despite current restrictions, with some improvement, biophysical models could become useful environmental assessment tools for non-scientists...|$|R
40|$|In this work, <b>nitrogen</b> <b>loss</b> in the nitrite {{oxidation}} {{step of the}} nitrification {{process in}} an aerobic-granule-based reactor was characterized with both experimental and modeling approaches. Experimental results showed that soluble microbial products (SMP) were released from the nitrite-oxidizing granules and were utilized as a carbon source by the heterotrophs for denitrification. This was verified by the {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) analysis. Microelectrode tests showed that oxygen diffusion limitation did result in an anoxic micro-zone in the granules and allowed sequential utilization of nitrate as an electron acceptor for heterotrophic denitrification with SMP as a carbon source. To further elucidate the <b>nitrogen</b> <b>loss</b> mechanisms, a mathematic model was formulated to describe the growth of nitrite oxidizers, the formation and consumption of SMP, the anoxic heterotrophic growth on SMP and nitrate, as well as the oxygen transfer and the substrate diffusion in the granules. The results clearly indicate that the heterotrophs grown on the SMP released by the autotrophs are responsible for the <b>nitrogen</b> <b>loss</b> in the nitrifying granules, and give us {{a better understanding of the}} aerobic granules for nitrogen removal.
