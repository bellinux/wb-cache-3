5|$|Between 1949 and 1958 Rejewski was {{repeatedly}} {{investigated by the}} Polish <b>Office</b> <b>of</b> <b>Public</b> Security, who suspected {{he was a former}} member of the Polish Armed Forces in the West. He retired in 1967, and moved with his family back to Warsaw in 1969, to an apartment he had acquired 30 years earlier with financial help from his father-in-law.|$|E
5|$|Because he owed few favors to the state's {{established}} politicians, many of Brown's top appointees were businesspeople. Keeping {{a campaign}} promise {{to appoint a}} woman and an African-American to his cabinet, Brown named William E. McAnulty Jr., and Jacqueline Swigart to his cabinet. McAnulty resigned his post {{as secretary of the}} state's Department of Justice within one month, saying the position would keep him from spending enough time with his family. Brown re-appointed McAnulty to his former position as a judge with the Jefferson County District Court and replaced him with another African-American, George W. Wilson. He also appointed Viola Davis Brown as Executive Director of the <b>Office</b> <b>of</b> <b>Public</b> Health Nursing – in 1980, she was the first African-American nurse to lead a state <b>office</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> health nursing in the U.S. His most controversial appointment was Frank Metts, his secretary of transportation. Metts broke with political tradition in Kentucky, announcing that contracts would be awarded on the basis of competitive bids and performance rather than political patronage. Despite cutting personnel from the department, Metts doubled the miles of road that were resurfaced.|$|E

In 1993, she became Executive Director for the Chicago <b>office</b> <b>of</b> <b>Public</b> Allies, a non-profit organization encouraging young people to work on social issues in nonprofit groups and government agencies. She worked there nearly four years and set fundraising records for the organization that still stood 12 years after she left.|$|E
50|$|In 1953, in the field, {{there were}} 17 Voivode <b>Offices</b> <b>of</b> <b>Public</b> Security (WUBP), and 2 Regional <b>Offices</b> <b>of</b> <b>Public</b> Security {{on the order}} of WUBP. There were 268 District <b>Offices</b> <b>of</b> <b>Public</b> Security (PUBP) and 5 City <b>Offices</b> <b>of</b> <b>Public</b> Security (MUBP), which {{operated}} as District <b>Offices</b> <b>of</b> <b>Public</b> Security (PUBP). Together, they employed 33,200 permanent officers, of which 7,500 were stationed in their Warsaw headquarters. According to professor Andrzej Paczkowski, in 1953, there was one MBP (or UB) officer for every 800 Polish citizens. Never again, in the 45-year-old history of the People's Republic of Poland, were its special services' formations so large in numbers.|$|R

5|$|The {{responsibilities}} of Kraków's president include drafting and implementing resolutions, enacting city bylaws, managing the city budget, employing city administrators, and preparing against floods and natural disasters. The president fulfills his duties {{with the help}} of the City Council, city managers and city inspectors. In the 1990s, the city government was reorganised to better differentiate between its political agenda and administrative functions. As a result, the <b>Office</b> <b>of</b> <b>Public</b> Information was created to handle inquiries and foster communication between city departments and citizens at large.|$|E
5|$|Vermigli {{was ordained}} in 1525 and {{probably}} received his Doctor of Divinity around that time. The chapter-general of the Congregation elected {{him to the}} <b>office</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> preacher in 1526. His first series of sermons was in Brescia later that year. He then preached for three years, travelling around northern and central Italy. Unlike the practice of other preaching orders which usually only preached at Lent and Advent, the Augustinians preached year-round. He also gave lectures on the Bible as well as Homer in Lateran Congregation houses.|$|E
5|$|On September 13, 2012, {{long time}} Tory MHA and former cabinet {{minister}} Tom Osborne {{announced he was}} leaving the PC Party to sit as an independent. He cited Dunderdale's leadership {{as the reason for}} his defection and said that the turning point for him was the debate over Bill 29. Osborne said that while he voted in favour of the new legislation he did not support it. On October 19, 2012, Dunderdale shuffled her cabinet and Justice Minister Felix Collins, who was responsible for Bill 29, was shuffled out of the Justice portfolio and became Minister of Intergovernmental and Aboriginal Affairs. Though the portfolio change was considered to be a demotion Dunderdale stated that Collins' handling of Bill 29 was not connected to his move. At the time of the cabinet shuffle Dunderdale also created the <b>Office</b> <b>of</b> <b>Public</b> Engagement, which will bring together different departments to aid in communications efforts. The new office will also be responsible for access to information.|$|E

5|$|The Hearsum Collection is a {{registered}} charity that collects and preserves the heritage of Richmond Park. It has a collection, which was started in 1997, of heritage material covering the last four centuries, with over 5000 items including antique prints, paintings, maps, postcards, photographs, documents, books and press cuttings. Volunteers from the Friends of Richmond Park have been cataloguing them. The Collection, which as of 2017 continues to be stored in unsatisfactory accommodation in Pembroke Lodge, is overseen by volunteers and part-time staff. The trustees announced in 2014 {{plans for a new}} purpose-built heritage centre to provide full public access to the Collection. In April 2017 the Collection, in collaboration with The Royal Parks and Ireland's <b>Office</b> <b>of</b> <b>Public</b> Works, mounted an exhibition at Dublin's Phoenix Park entitled Parks, Our Shared Heritage: The Phoenix Park, Dublin & The Royal Parks, London, demonstrating the historical links between Richmond Park (and other Royal Parks in London) and Phoenix Park. This exhibition was also displayed at the Mall Galleries in London in July and August 2017.|$|E
5|$|In 1945 Döblin's 18-year-old son Stefan {{was called}} up for {{military}} service in the French army. That spring had brought the good news that Klaus was alive and in Switzerland after a period working for the French resistance, and the grim tidings that Wolfgang was dead, having committed suicide five years earlier. In October 1945 Alfred and Erna arrived in New York, sailing aboard the Argentine back to Europe. They first settled in Baden-Baden, where Döblin worked for the French military government as official representative for the <b>office</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> education; he was tasked with approving manuscripts for publication, and vehemently opposed the approval of any texts by authors who had sympathized with National Socialism, such as Ernst Jünger or Gottfried Benn. In postwar Germany's conservative cultural climate, Döblin was unable to draw on his earlier success as an author, yet continued his literary engagement {{with a series of}} publications and journals that aimed to rebuild Germany's intellectual and cultural life, reintroducing the literature banned by the Nazis and fostering the growth of younger writers. Despite these efforts, Döblin was disappointed by the apparent continuity between the Nazi years and the postwar climate. His growing pessimism was fueled by his sense of isolation and marginalization within the postwar German literary scene. In 1953 Alfred and Erna returned to Paris despite the invitation by Brecht and Johannes R. Becher to settle in East Berlin.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Office</b> <b>of</b> <b>Public</b> Engagement was {{established}} on October 19, 2012, and includes the Rural Secretariat, the Voluntary and Non-Profit Secretariat, the Youth Engagement office, the Strategic Partnership Initiative, and the Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Office. Innovation, Business and Rural Development Minister Keith Hutchings was appointed as the minister {{responsible for the}} office, while Steve Kent was appointed parliamentary secretary for the office. Several days after his appointment Hutchings announced {{that the government was}} looking at putting restaurant inspection reports online for the public viewing. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) had spent $457 obtaining inspection reports earlier the year, which had been criticized by former Service NL Minister Paul Davis during the debate on Bill 29. On November 22, 2012, Hutchings and Service NL Minister Nick McGrath announced that the public could now go on the government's website and see recent health and sanitation inspection reports for restaurants. While both opposition parties agreed with the government's decision to make the reports available online, Liberal MHA Andrew Parsons said that “I have no doubt that this is a response to the Bill 29 criticism".|$|E
