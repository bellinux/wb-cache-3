5|$|In the Junta, Alberti {{was aligned}} {{with most of}} the reformist {{proposals}} of Mariano Moreno, as well as Juan Larrea and Juan José Castelli. He signed most of the rulings that shaped the new political system, such as those related to popular sovereignty, representative and republican principles, separation of powers, publicity of the government actions, freedom of speech and the bases of political federalism. However, he did not support the actions of the Junta that contradicted his religious formation, regardless <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>context.</b> He refused to sign the death penalty for Santiago de Liniers, captured after the defeat of his counter-revolution. He signed the harsh commands given to Castelli for the first Upper Peru campaign, but noticing next to his signature that he made an exception with the articles involving capital punishment. He was also concerned by the role of the church in the new political system and headed a dispute against the Cabildo about it. He considered that the Cabildo should not have any authority over the Junta in ecclesiastic topics, to prevent the former abuses of the absolutist governments.|$|E

25|$|A more {{recently}} suggested defense mechanism of infidelity attracting more attention and {{research is the}} idea that a particular social group will punish cheaters by damaging their individual reputation (Fisher et al., 2009). The basis for this suggestion {{stems from the fact that}} humans have an unmatched ability to monitor social relationships and inflict punishment on cheaters, regardless <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>context</b> (Scheuring, 2010). This punishment comes in many forms, one of which is social gossip about the behaviour. Social Gossip ostracizes the individual from the group by damaging his or her reputation. This damage will impair the future benefits that individual can confer from the group and its individuals (Scheuring, 2010). A damaged reputation is especially debilitating when related to sexual and emotional infidelity because it can limit future reproductive mate choices within the group and will cause a net fitness cost that outweighs the fitness benefit gained from the infidelity (Fisher et al., 2010). Such limitations and costs deter an individual from cheating in the first place. Support for this defense mechanism comes from fieldwork by Hirsch and his colleagues (2007) that found that gossip about extramarital affairs in a small community in Mexico was particularly prevalent and devastating for reputation in this region. Specifically, adultery was found to cause an individual to be disowned by their family, decrease the marriage value of his/her family, cause an individual to lose money or a job, and diminish future reproductive potential. In this community, men having extramarital were extremely tactful in that they desired to do so in private areas with lower prevalence of women connected to the community such as bars and brothels, both areas of which had a high risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections (STI's). The fact that men in this community were more willing to risk their own physical well-being in order to engage in extramarital sexual activity reveals a strong desire to maintain their social reputations, thus offering support for social punishment as a defense mechanism for preventing infidelity.|$|E

500|$|As a tree grows, {{only the}} {{outermost}} tree ring exchanges carbon with its environment, so the age measured for a wood sample {{depends on where}} the sample is taken from. [...] This means that radiocarbon dates on wood samples can be older than the date at which the tree was felled. [...] In addition, if {{a piece of wood}} is used for multiple purposes, there may be a significant delay between the felling of the tree and the final use in the context in which it is found. [...] This {{is often referred to as}} the [...] "old wood" [...] problem. [...] One example is the Bronze Age trackway at Withy Bed Copse, in England; the trackway was built from wood that had clearly been worked for other purposes before being re-used in the trackway. [...] Another example is driftwood, which may be used as construction material. [...] It is not always possible to recognize re-use. [...] Other materials can present the same problem: for example, bitumen is known to have been used by some Neolithic communities to waterproof baskets; the bitumen's radiocarbon age will be greater than is measurable by the laboratory, regardless of the actual age <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>context,</b> so testing the basket material will give a misleading age if care is not taken. [...] A separate issue, related to re-use, is that of lengthy use, or delayed deposition. [...] For example, a wooden object that remains in use for a lengthy period will have an apparent age greater than the actual age <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>context</b> in which it is deposited.|$|E
