5|$|Tucker {{was educated}} in Bermuda {{primarily}} by a tutor engaged from Great Britain {{and also by}} Josiah Meigs. His assigned reading included Tom Jones, The Vicar of Wakefield, and Arabian Nights, among the mainstays <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>education</b> on the American continent. At age fifteen he helped form a literary club, the Calliopean Society; Meigs later became a professor and reprised {{the name of the}} club at Yale. Tucker at age 16 began to read the law under a successful and prosperous lawyer, George Bascomb. At Bascomb's death, the firm's clients urged Tucker to assume their representation, but feeling quite unqualified, he declined, deciding to begin plans for a career in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Douglas' cottage, {{located in}} Coconut Grove at 37443754 Stewart Avenue, {{was built in}} 1924. She wrote all of her major books and stories in the cottage, and the City of Miami {{designated}} it an historic site in 1995, {{not only for its}} famous owner but also for its unique Masonry Vernacular architecture. After Douglas' death, Friends of the Everglades proposed making the house part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>education</b> center about Douglas and her life, but neighbors protested, citing issues with parking, traffic, and an influx of visitors to the quiet neighborhood. The house, which had an exterior floodwater line from the 1926 Miami Hurricane and some damage from an infestation of bees, had fallen further into disrepair. For a while, the idea of moving the house to Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden in Coral Gables, which Douglas helped to develop and where there is a life size bronze statue to commemorate her efforts, was considered. The State of Florida owns Douglas' house and in April 2007 placed it in the care of the Florida Park Service, a division of the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. Restoration of the floors and counters took place in the following months. Water service was reconnected to the house and the electrical system was updated for safety purposes. All work was approved by the Department of Historic Resources. A park ranger was placed as a resident in the Douglas house to help maintain the structure and property.|$|E

25|$|People contributed in {{the form}} of cash, {{construction}} materials or labor, and even vacant lots for the building of schools.

25|$|Education is {{considered}} a contributing factor to why {{women are more likely}} than men to live in poverty. 63% of female households who have children under the age of 18 do not complete high school. However, for minority women, socioeconomic factors contribute to them receiving less <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>education</b> than whites. There is a high concentration of minorities in poverty living in urban areas; this contributes to poor quality of education as there is a lack of funding in inner-city schools.|$|E

25|$|Gan Eng Seng School {{was founded}} in some shophouses in Telok Ayer Street in 1885 by the philanthropist, Gan Eng Seng and was known as Anglo Chinese Free School. Born in 1844 into a poor family in Melaka, Gan came to Singapore {{at a young age}} to seek his fortune. Since he was unable to have much <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>education</b> in his youth, it was his {{ambition}} in life to build a school and help those who are poor as he prospered and became wealthy. Gan was far-sighted in placing emphasis on bilingualism in English and Chinese from the start. The school proved to be a success - the enrolment figure reached a record of 167 by 1890, and rose to an all-time high of 94% in 1892.|$|E
500|$|Individuals {{involved}} in the Weiquan movement have met with occasionally harsh reprisals from Chinese officials, including disbarment, detention, harassment, and, in extreme instances, torture. Authorities have also responded to the movement with the launch <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>education</b> campaign on the [...] "socialist concept of rule of law," [...] which reasserts {{the role of the}} Communist Party and the primacy of political considerations in the legal profession, and with the Three Supremes, which entrenches the supremacy of the Communist Party in the judicial process.|$|E

He wrote that Goodman pioneered advocation for deschooling and the disestablishment of schools, which was later popularized by Illich and Reimer (though Goodman's thoughts were less articulate in comparison). In a 2006 retrospective of Goodman's work for Teachers College Record, James S. Kaminsky said that Goodman's four book-length critiques of American education together made Goodman a prominent intellectual and educationist.|$|E

500|$|After the {{departure}} of Welser-Möst, the LPO was without a principal conductor for four years. During the interregnum the orchestra inaugurated its [...] "Roots Classical Fusions" [...] series, which aimed to combine musical traditions from around the world; this was part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>education</b> and community programme launched by the orchestra. Kurt Masur was the LPO's principal conductor from 2000 to 2007. Under Masur, known for his performances of the German symphonic repertoire, the orchestra regained its musical form, and the critic Richard S Ginell commented that Vladimir Jurowski, who took over in 2007 [...] "has inherited an LPO in splendid technical shape, probably having been drilled to a fare-thee-well under Masur".|$|E
500|$|King Carol and Queen Elisabeth {{promptly}} removed Prince Carol and Princess Elisabeth from Marie's care, {{considering it}} inappropriate {{for them to}} be raised by their young parents. Marie loved her children, but found it difficult to even scold them at times, thus failing to properly supervise them. Consequently, the royal children were given somewhat <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>education,</b> but were never sent to school. As the royal household could not provide what a classroom education would have, most of the children's personalities became severely flawed as they grew older. Prime Minister Ion G. Duca would later write that [...] "it was like [...] wished to leave for Romania heirs completely unprepared for succeeding." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{group of}} Easton {{citizens}} led by James Madison Porter met on December 27, 1824 at White's Tavern {{to explore the}} possibility of opening a college. [...] The recent visit of General Lafayette to New York during his grand tour of the US in 1824 and 1825 prompted the founders to name the school after the French military officer. [...] The group also established the 35-member Board of Trustees, a system of governance that has remained at the college to this day. [...] In need <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>education</b> plan, the meeting gave the responsibility to Porter, lawyer Jacob Wagener, and Yale-educated lawyer Joel Jones. [...] The charter gained approval and on March 9, 1826, Pennsylvania Governor John Andrew Shulze's signature made the college official. Along with establishing Lafayette as a Liberal Arts College, the charter called for religious equality amongst professors, students, and staff.|$|E

500|$|Adams {{was educated}} at the Douglas County High School. She was not academically inclined, but was {{interested}} in the creative arts and sang in the school choir. Although she competed in track and gymnastics, she harbored ambitions of becoming a ballerina and trained as an apprentice at the local David Taylor Dance Company. She disliked her experience in high school and kept mostly to herself. After her graduation, she moved to Atlanta with her mother. She did not intend to go to college, which disappointed her parents, and she later regretted not getting more <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>education.</b> Realizing, at age 18, that she was not gifted enough to be a professional ballerina, Adams inclined towards musical theater, which she found was [...] "much better suited to [...] personality". One of her first jobs was in a community theater production of Annie, but she made no money in it. To support herself, Adams worked as a greeter at a Gap store. She also {{took a job as a}} waitress at Hooters, where she had to work wearing tight gym outfits, and customers frequently misbehaved with her. Adams left the job soon after she had saved enough money to buy a used car.|$|E
500|$|In April 1999, Victoria Climbié (born 2 November 1991 in Abobo, Côte d'Ivoire, died 25 February 2000 at St. Mary's Hospital, London) and {{her great}} aunt Marie-Thérèse Kouao arrived in London, sent {{by her parents}} for a chance <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>education.</b> A few months later, Kouao met Carl Manning on a bus which he was driving, and she and Victoria moved into his flat. It was here that she was abused, {{including}} being beaten with hammers, bike chains, and wires; being forced {{to sleep in a}} bin liner in the bath; and being tied up for periods of over 24 hours. In the period leading up to her death, the police, the social services of many local authorities, the NHS, the NSPCC, and local churches all had contact with her, and noted the signs of abuse. However, in what the judge in the trial following Victoria's death described as [...] "blinding incompetence", all failed to properly investigate the abuse and little action was taken. On 24 February 2000, Victoria was admitted into an accident-and-emergency department, semi-unconscious and suffering from hypothermia, multiple organ failure and malnutrition. She died the next day, aged eight. On 20 November 2000, her guardians, Marie Thérèse Kouao and Carl Manning, were charged with child cruelty and murder; on 12 January 2001, both were found guilty, and sentenced to life imprisonment.|$|E
