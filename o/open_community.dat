25|$|A team {{consists}} of minimum seven (maximum 21) players, of which six {{are always on}} the pitch, those being the three chasers, one keeper, and two beaters. Besides the seeker who is off-pitch, the six players are required {{to abide by the}} gender rule, which states that a team may have a maximum of four players who identify as the same gender, excluding the seeker, making quidditch one of the few sports that not only offers a co-ed environment but an <b>open</b> <b>community</b> to those who do not identify with the gender binary. Matches or games often run about 30 to 40 minutes but tend to be subject to varying lengths of time due to the unpredictable nature of the snitch catch. If the score {{at the end of the}} match including the 30 point snitch catch is tied (such that the team that caught the snitch was 30 points behind the other), the game moves to overtime where the snitch is constrained to the pitch's dimensions and the game ends after five minutes or when the snitch is legally caught.|$|E

The north wing, Brewer Hall, is primarily used as sorority housing. The east and south wings, respectively Nason Hall and Blanton Hall, are used as regular housing. BNB does not have its own dining hall, so residents typically walk to Missouri Hall, which is next door. The hall offers two large lounges with fireplaces on the first floor.

[...] The book delves into specific examples of organizations which attempted to enforce their perceived intellectual property from being distributed to websites on the Internet, as balanced against the ability of people participating in an online community to bring previously confidential material to light whilst stating it serves the public interest to do so. She recounts activism by Internet users against the Communications Decency Act, which was ultimately deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States. Grossman includes a discussion of participation in online discussion on the Internet with respect to the rights of freedom of speech and the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{attempts}} to find {{a relationship between the}} <b>open</b> source <b>community</b> and software piracy. The reason for believing there is such a relationship {{is the fact that the}} <b>open</b> source <b>community</b> advocates that software should be redistributed freely, and is therefore also opposed to software patents. Literature study and interviews have researched the relationship between the <b>open</b> source <b>community</b> and piracy, and if this relationship can be established through the community’s dislike of software patents. It has been concluded that software patents are not connected to this relationship. Interviews have shown that the <b>open</b> source <b>community’s</b> attitude towards software piracy is negative, and that this attitude may be more negative than the general opinion towards software piracy.

30|$|A community’s {{governance}} {{model can}} be understood by examining the authoritative structures embedded in its coordination processes [28]. Respecting this, we crafted a research instrument to guide reporting our results. The instrument includes nine questions on where the case projects’ governance models place their emphasis at the different stages of the software development process. The first five questions of our research instrument evaluate whether the <b>open</b> <b>community’s</b> members were able to access development tasks by A) sending code contributions B) reviewing them and C) accepting the verified contributions to be integrated to the current development version of the software. In addition, we investigated whether external contributors were able to D) access the live development version of the software to e.g. verify defect reports and finally, whether members of the <b>open</b> developer <b>community</b> were able to E) impact priorities of the requirements. This, on its part, reflects how well the <b>open</b> <b>community’s</b> members viewpoint was considered in short-term development decisions.|$|R
