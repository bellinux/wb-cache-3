5|$|According to Pyun, {{the idea}} <b>of</b> <b>Max</b> Havoc has existed {{since at least}} 2001. At the time, {{he was asked to}} direct the film in Hawaii. After the September 11 attacks, it was decided that filming in Miami was more {{economically}} viable. Pyun said that Hawaiian film star Mark Dacascos was interested in playing the character <b>of</b> <b>Max</b> Havoc, but that he backed out after anthrax appeared in Florida. Bali was considered next for filming but the idea was abandoned after the terrorist bombing there in 2002. The director and producer settled on filming on Guam, voicing their interest to Guam officials in late 2003. Max Havoc: Curse of the Dragon {{was supposed to be the}} first of two films to act as a backdoor pilot into a Max Havoc television series.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{commitments}} <b>of</b> <b>Max</b> with Soulfly and Igor with Mixhell, Cavalera Conspiracy {{was put on}} hold until August 2009, {{when the}} band regrouped to touring in Europe and Japan, including shows at the Ankkarock, Summer Sonic, Pukkelpop, and Trutnov festivals, and two September 2009 dates in Austria and Russia.|$|E

5000|$|Celia Maybaum {{soon became}} known as [...] "Mrs. Max". Over the years [...] "Mrs. Max" [...] has become an {{enduring}} iconic symbol <b>of</b> <b>Max's</b> Famous Hot Dogs. [...] "Max" [...] died in 1980 but the legacy continues as {{the second and third}} generations of the Maybaum family keep the tradition <b>of</b> <b>Max's</b> alive.|$|R

5|$|Karl Emil Maximilian Weber {{was born}} in 1864, in Erfurt, Province of Saxony, Prussia. He was {{the oldest of the}} seven {{children}} <b>of</b> <b>Max</b> Weber Sr., a wealthy and prominent civil servant and member of the National Liberal Party, and his wife Helene (Fallenstein), who partly descended from French Huguenot immigrants and held strong moral absolutist ideas.|$|E

5|$|The 2007 film Hitman re-used footage <b>of</b> <b>Max</b> {{and other}} Manticore {{children}} in training from Dark Angel. It {{was used to}} portray the Hitman protagonist Agent 47, a cloned assassin who, like the Manticore children, has a barcode {{on the back of}} his head.|$|E
5|$|The main {{criticisms of}} the film were that its {{characters}} were underdeveloped, its script was crowded, and it was overlong. However, the special effects, chemistry between Stone and Garfield, Dane DeHaan's performance, the action scenes, and Hans Zimmer's musical score were met with high praise. Foxx's portrayal <b>of</b> <b>Max</b> Dillon/Electro was met with mixed reviews.|$|E
5|$|At the London 2012 Olympics, Murray {{competed in}} the singles, doubles (partnering his brother Jamie) and mixed doubles (partnering Laura Robson). In the singles, he won the Gold Medal, {{including}} straight-set victories over Novak Djokovic in the semifinals and Roger Federer in the final, four weeks after Federer had beaten him in on the same court in the Wimbledon final.

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War II, in 1939, the International Secretariat was moved to New York City. The resident International Executive Committee failed to meet, largely because of a struggle in the U.S. Socialist Workers Party (SWP) between Trotsky's supporters and the tendency <b>of</b> <b>Max</b> Shachtman, Martin Abern and James Burnham. The secretariat was composed of those committee members {{who happened to be}} in the city, most of whom were co-thinkers of Shachtman. The disagreement centred on the Shachtmanites' disagreements with the SWP's internal policy, and over the FI's unconditional defence of the USSR.|$|E
5|$|Born in Kiev {{in the old}} Russian Empire, Kistiakowsky fled his {{homeland}} during the Russian Civil War. He {{made his way to}} Germany, where he earned his PhD in physical chemistry under the supervision <b>of</b> <b>Max</b> Bodenstein at the University of Berlin. He emigrated to the United States in 1926, where he joined the faculty of Harvard University in 1930, and became a citizen in 1933.|$|E
5|$|Both Niedermayer and von Hentig {{returned}} to Germany, where they enjoyed celebrated careers. On von Hentig's recommendation, Niedermayer was knighted and bestowed with the Military Order <b>of</b> <b>Max</b> Joseph. He {{was asked to}} lead a third expedition to Afghanistan in 1917, but declined. Niedermayer served in the Reichswehr before retiring in 1933 and joining the University of Berlin. He was recalled to active duty during World War II, serving in Ukraine. He was taken prisoner {{at the end of}} the war and died in a Soviet prisoner of war camp in 1948.|$|E

5|$|Busch's {{greatest}} success, {{both within}} Germany and internationally, was with Max and Moritz: Up {{to the time}} of his death it was translated into English, Danish, Hebrew, Japanese, Latin, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Hungarian, Swedish and Walloonian. Several countries banned the story– about 1929 the Styrian school board prohibited sales <b>of</b> <b>Max</b> and Moritz to teens under eighteen. By 1997 more than 281 dialect and language translations had been produced.|$|E
5|$|During the {{production}} of the third season, special effects supervisor Dave Gauthier constructed an elaborate mock-up of a Boeing 737 airplane {{in order to be able}} to simulate a crash. Series creator Chris Carter decided to make use of this rig during the fourth season. When conceiving of the episode, the desire to add to Fox Mulder's emotional involvement by having someone he knew on board led to the writers bringing back the character <b>of</b> <b>Max</b> Fenig to be that person.|$|E
5|$|For Braun the {{manuscript}} was fortuitous. Initially the sales <b>of</b> <b>Max</b> and Moritz were slow, but sales figures improved after the 1868 second edition. Overall there were 56 editions {{and more than}} 430,000 copies sold up to Busch's death in 1908. Despite at first being ignored by critics, teachers in the 1870s described Max and Moritz as frivolous and an undesirable influence on the moral development of young people.|$|E

He was presented with several other awards, including the Royal Saxon Order, the Order of Albrecht, and all three Hanseatic Crosses from Lübeck, Bremen, and Hamburg.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{once again}} {{set the time}} in Q2, almost a second ahead of second-placed Kimi Räikkönen, while Felipe Massa went faster than Sebastian Vettel in third.

5|$|In September 2013 Max Cavalera stated {{his intent}} {{to begin work}} on a new Cavalera Conspiracy album in 2014, which will be {{predominantly}} grindcore. Igor then implied on October 1 that the album could consist solely of the two brothers, without involvement from Marc Rizzo or Johny Chow, with the album produced by James Murphy. However this was proven false when Max's wife Gloria announced the trio <b>of</b> <b>Max,</b> Igor and Marc entering the studio with producer John Gray in late December 2013, along with the announcement on 31 December of Nate Newton of Converge as the band's new bassist.|$|E

A distant cousin <b>of</b> <b>Max's</b> is the world's leading specialist in this disease, and {{he is on the}} staff of M.A. Horne Hospital, founded by her father after M.A.'s death. In short, Max has come home to die.|$|R
