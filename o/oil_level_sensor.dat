50|$|A 1994 Mercury Villager Nautica {{was tested}} going from 0-60 {{miles per hour}} in 11.7 seconds. The 1993-98 Villager had a turning radius of 38.7 feet. While all Villagers from 1992 to 1998 {{featured}} the same VG30E-type 3.0 liter 151-horsepower V6 used in the Nissan Quest from the same model years, Ford had required that Nissan make some design changes to the VG30E used in the first Quest prototypes before they would agree {{to use it in}} the Villager. Changes included the addition of an <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> <b>sensor</b> and relocating the oil filter assembly for better access. Although the VG30E used in other Nissan models were interference engines, the VG30Es in Quests and Villagers were non-interference.|$|E
50|$|Ford {{required}} that Nissan make some design {{changes to the}} VG30E before they would agree {{to use it in}} the Villager and Quest. Changes included the addition of an <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> <b>sensor</b> and relocating the oil filter assembly for better access. The engine was also modified for the Quest and Villager to become a non-interference design: if the timing belt were to break, the pistons wouldn't come in contact with any open valves in the cylinders. The Quest was available as XE or GXE models. Because of manufacturing issues, Nissan had an arrangement for Ford to assemble the minivan in North America, and in turn they were allowed to rebadge it and sell it under the Mercury brand as the Villager. Many of the interior parts, including the radio, heater controls and power windows controls were adapted from Ford, and were similar to the Ford Aerostar. This generation of the Quest and Villager was built at Ford's Ohio Assembly plant in Avon Lake, Ohio. The van shared the modified version of the VG30E from the U11, and early J30 Maximas, as well as the 4-speed automatic transmission from the Maxima.The Quest/Villager engine seems to have a serious flaw in the crankshaft, as they break at the front stub. Nissan increased the diameter from 25 to 27 mm around 1995.|$|E
30|$|A machine {{diagnosis}} system entails {{developing a}} system {{that can be used}} to monitor in real-time and detect faults present in different subsystems of a machine. This uses some intelligent rule-based machine fault detection algorithms developed by experts of such machine systems. Given this, the RVS machine diagnosis system involves the utilization of sensors such as thermocouples, strain gauges, accelerometers, <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> <b>sensors</b> and smart bolt wireless sensors to measure in real-time the temperature at which the vibrating motor powering the RVS machine is running. The sensors must measure the real-time stress and deformation that the RVS subsystems such as screen panels, screen deck frame, side plates, side liner plates, back plates, torsion bar, torsion bar brackets and M- 16 bolts e.t.c. of the machine are subjected to. They must ascertain real-time vibrations generated by the vibrating motor. They must monitor the lubricating <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> of the <b>oil</b> compartment of vibrating motor. The oil is responsible for the lubrication of shaft and bearing powering the vibrating motor. The measured values obtained from these sensors are then compared with the rule-based RVS subsystems performance algorithms developed by RVS machine manufacturer. This will alert the users and maintenance managers of this machine when over-heating and knocking of the vibrating motor occurs and when deformation, degradation and wear of the aforementioned subsystems of the RVS machine sets in. It will reveal when the shaft, bearing and half-circular spinning discs (responsible for the machine vibration) inside the vibrating motor deform, break and wear.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{industrial}} or automotive dip lubricated gear drives, low <b>oil</b> <b>levels</b> {{may be used}} due {{to different}} design requirements or constraints. A variation of the sump <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> affects different working conditions of gears, such as the power loss, the heat generation, and the load-carrying capacity with respect to different types of damage. In particular, reduced <b>oil</b> <b>levels</b> decrease the scuffing load capacity of gears because of high bulk temperatures and reduced oil quantity in the gear mesh. Investigations were made in a back-to-back hypoid gear test rig to evaluate the influence of the bath <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> on the scuffing load-carrying capacity of dip lubricated hypoid gears...|$|R
