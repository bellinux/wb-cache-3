40|$|Recent {{findings}} suggest that sleep might serve a role in emotional coping. However, most findings are based on subjective reports of sleep quality, while the relation with underlying sleep physiology is still largely unknown. In this study, the impact of an emotionally distressing experience on the EEG correlates of sleep was assessed. In addition, the association between sleep physiological parameters {{and the extent of}} emotional attenuation <b>over</b> <b>sleep</b> was determined. The experimental set up involved presentation of an emotionally neutral or distressing film fragment in the evening, followed by polysomnographic registration of undisturbed, whole-night sleep and assessment of emotional reactivity to film cues on the next evening. We found that emotional distress induced mild sleep deterioration, but also an increase in the proportion of slow wave sleep (SWS) and altered patterning of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Indeed, while REM sleep occurrence normally increases {{over the course of the}} night, emotional distress flattened this distribution and correlated with an increased number of REM periods. While sleep deterioration was negatively associated to emotional attenuation <b>over</b> <b>sleep,</b> the SWS response was positively related to such attenuation and may form part of a compensatory response to the stressor. Interestingly, trait-like SWS characteristics also correlated positively with the extent of emotion attenuation <b>over</b> <b>sleep.</b> The combined results provide strong evidence for an intimate reciprocal relation between sleep physiology and emotional processing. Moreover, individual differences in subjects ’ emotional and sleep responses suggest there may be a coupling o...|$|E

40|$|Sleep enhances memories, {{particularly}} emotional memories. As such, it {{has been}} suggested that sleep deprivation may reduce post-traumatic stress disorder. This presumes that emotional memory consolidation is paralleled by a reduction in emotional reactivity, an association that has not yet been examined. In the present experiment, we utilized an incidental memory task in humans and obtained valence and arousal ratings during two sessions separated either by 12 hours of daytime wake or 12 hours including overnight sleep. Recognition accuracy was greater following sleep relative to wake for both negative and neutral pictures. While emotional reactivity to negative pictures was greatly reduced over wake, the negative emotional response was relatively preserved <b>over</b> <b>sleep.</b> Moreover, protection of emotional reactivity was associated with greater time in REM sleep. Recognition accuracy, however, was not associated with REM. Thus, we provide the first evidence that sleep enhances emotional memory while preserving emotional reactivity...|$|E
40|$|Sleep {{benefits}} veridical memories, {{resulting in}} superior recall relative to off-line intervals spent awake. Sleep also increases false memory recall in the Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm.

Participants listened to semantically related word lists lacking a critical lure representing each list’s ‘‘gist. ’ ’ Free recall was tested after 12 hours containing sleep or wake. The Sleep group recalled more studied words than the Wake group but only for emotionally neutral lists. False memories of both negative and neutral critical lures were greater following sleep relative to wake. Morning and Evening control groups (20 -minute delay) did not differ ruling out circadian accounts for these differences. These results support the adaptive function of sleep in both promoting the consolidation of veridical declarative memories and in extracting unifying aspects from memory details...|$|E

40|$|Richard B Francoeur 1, 2 1 School of Social Work and the Center for Health Innovation, Adelphi University, Garden City, NY, USA; 2 Center for the Psychosocial Study of Health and Illness, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA Background: The {{majority}} of patients with advanced cancer experience symptom pairs or clusters among pain, fatigue, and insomnia. Improved methods are needed to detect and interpret interactions among symptoms or diesease markers to reveal influential pairs or clusters. In prior work, I developed and validated sequential residual centering (SRC), a method that improves the sensitivity of multiple regression to detect interactions among predictors, by conditioning for multicollinearity (shared variation) among interactions and component predictors. Materials and methods: Using a hypothetical three-way interaction among pain, fatigue, and sleep to predict depressive affect, I derive and explain SRC multiple regression. Subsequently, I estimate raw and SRC multiple regressions using real data for these symptoms from 268 palliative radiation outpatients. Results: Unlike raw regression, SRC reveals that the three-way interaction (pain × fatigue/weakness × sleep problems) is statistically significant. In follow-up analyses, the relationship between pain and depressive affect is aggravated (magnified) within two partial ranges: 1) complete-to-some control over fatigue/weakness when there is complete control <b>over</b> <b>sleep</b> problems (ie, {{a subset of the}} pain–fatigue/weakness symptom pair), and 2) no control over fatigue/weakness when there is some-to-no control <b>over</b> <b>sleep</b> problems (ie, a subset of the pain–fatigue/weakness–sleep problems symptom cluster). Otherwise, the relationship weakens (buffering) as control over fatigue/weakness or sleep problems diminishes. Conclusion: By reducing the standard error, SRC unmasks a three-way interaction comprising a symptom pair and cluster. Low-to-moderate levels of the moderator variable for fatigue/weakness magnify the relationship between pain and depressive affect. However, when the comoderator variable for sleep problems accompanies fatigue/weakness, only frequent or unrelenting levels of both symptoms magnify the relationship. These findings suggest that a countervailing mechanism involving depressive affect could account for the effectiveness of a cognitive behavioral intervention to reduce the severity of a pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbance cluster in a previous randomized trial.

So, to program the ASDM for minimum switching activity, hysteresis modulation with external control is implemented in the proposed design. This approach improves Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Dynamic Range (DR) with reduced power and area over reported implementations [8, 9]. Here, we present the complete design implementation of a resolution/power controllable and performance efficient Programmable Asynchronous Modulator (PAM). IoT devices like tiny sensors in thermostats, smoke detectors, entries to a house, sensors on the bridges, moisture sensors in a farm, mobile health monitors, or even cellphones are almost all battery-operated devices and {{spend most of their}} time in sleep or off condition. Connectivity in IoT is a new way of doing things, hence need to enable additional modes of operation specifically deep-sleep modes need to enable very fast shut down and wake-up time. So, PAM can preferably be used <b>over</b> <b>sleep</b> mode circuits having faster wake-up times.

40|$|Our {{brains are}} {{constantly}} processing past events 1. These offline processes consolidate memories, leading {{in the case}} of motor skill memories to an enhancement in performance between training sessions. A similar magnitude of enhancement develops over a night of sleep following an implicit task, in which a sequence of movements is acquired unintentionally, or following an explicit task, in which the same sequence is acquired intentionally 2. What remains poorly understood, however, is whether these similar offline improvements are supported by similar circuits, or through distinct circuits. We set out to distinguish between these possibilities by applying transcranial magnetic stimulation over the primary motor cortex (M 1) or the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) immediately after learning in either the explicit or implicit task. These brain areas have both been implicated in encoding aspects of a motor sequence and subsequently supporting offline improvements <b>over</b> <b>sleep</b> 3,​ 4,​ 5. Here we show that offline improvements following the explicit task are dependent on a circuit that includes M 1 but not IPL. In contrast, offline improvements following the implicit task are dependent on a circuit that includes IPL but not M 1. Our work establishes the critical contribution made by M 1 and IPL circuits to offline memory processing, and reveals that distinct circuits support similar offline improvements...|$|E
40|$|Different {{memories}} follow different processing pathways. For example, some {{motor skill}} memories are enhanced over wakefulness, whereas others are instead enhanced <b>over</b> <b>sleep.</b> The processing pathway that a motor skill memory follows may {{be determined by}} functional changes within motor circuits. We tested this idea using transcranial magnetic stimulation to measure corticospinal excitability at 6, 21, 36, 96, and 126 min after participants learnt tasks that either were or were not enhanced over wakefulness. There was no change in corticospinal excitability after learning a motor skill that was subsequently enhanced; whereas, there was a substantial transient decrease in corticospinal excitability after learning a motor skill that was not enhanced. In subsequent experiments, we abolished the decrease in corticospinal excitability by applying theta burst stimulation to either the dorsolateral prefrontal or primary motor cortex, and induced motor skill improvements during consolidation. The motor skill improvements in each experiment were correlated with the corticospinal excitability after learning. Together, these experiments suggest that corticospinal excitability changes act as a physiological signal, which prevents improvements from developing over wakefulness, and so when this signal is abolished improvements are induced. Our observations show that the human brain can actively prevent the processing of memories, and provides insights into the mechanisms that control the fate of memories...|$|E
40|$|Sleep disordered {{breathing}} (SDB) {{is characterized}} by repeated episodes of central or obstructive apneas, disturbing respiratory patterns. The {{purpose of this study}} is to quantify respiratory variability associated with apneic/hypopneic events by computing respiratory parameters and thoraco-abdominal asynchrony (TAA) <b>over</b> <b>sleep</b> periods preceding the occurrence of obstructive events in children with SDB. One minute artifact-free epochs of ribcage (RC) and abdominal (AB) signals were extracted from the respiratory inductive plethysmograph (RIP) channel of the PSG prior to the onset of each obstruction. Breath-by-breath values of TAA were computed using a Hilbert transform based technique that measures the phase shift between the RC and AB signals. In addition, the following parameters were computed breath-by-breath from the RC signal: inspiratory time (Ti), expiratory time (Te), total time (Ttot), and the inspiratory duty cycle (DC=Ti/Ttot). Standard deviation of the parameters (SD_TAA, SD_Ti, SD_Te, SD_Ttot, SD_DC) over each 1 min epoch were calculated and averaged over each subject with respect to sleep stage. For comparison, similar measures were computed from within quiet breathing periods of each subject. We found that breaths immediately before apnea/hypopneas were associated with a high degree of variability in respiratory timing and TAA. The proposed variability analysis of RIP signals may be useful for detecting acute epochs of respiratory instability in children with SDB. Sarah A. Immanuel, Mark Kohler, Yvonne Pamula, Muammar M.
