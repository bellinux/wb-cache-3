5|$|In coal seams, coal {{balls are}} {{completely}} surrounded by coal. They are often found randomly {{scattered throughout the}} seam in isolated groups, usually in {{the upper half of}} the seam. Their occurrence in coal seams can be either extremely sporadic or regular; many coal seams have been found to contain no coal balls, while <b>others</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> found to contain so many coal balls that miners avoid the area entirely.|$|E
5|$|Larger male, female or bovine {{terracotta}} wheelmade {{figures are}} much rarer.

5|$|Other {{than the}} main rides, The Wizarding World of Harry Potter {{is also home}} to gift shops, {{restaurants}} and other tourist attractions. Several of these are recreations of locations in the Harry Potter books while <b>others</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> created specifically for the park. A recreation of Hogsmeade is housed at Islands of Adventure while a recreation of Diagon Alley is housed at Universal Studios Florida.|$|E
5|$|Several {{songs by}} Los Ángeles Negros have been covered by bands and {{artists such as}} Los Tr3s, Los Bunkers, Sexual Democracia, José José, Raphael, and Celia Cruz, while <b>others</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> sampled by hip hop and rap acts such as the Beatnuts the Beastie Boys, Jay-Z, Damian Marley, and Funkdoobiest.|$|E
5|$|Some closed station {{buildings}} are still standing, converted {{for other uses}} or abandoned, while <b>others</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> demolished and their sites redeveloped. A number of stations, while still open, have closed platforms or sections, such as the Jubilee line platforms at Charing Cross. The interiors and platforms of a few closed stations are among parts of the London Underground available for filming purposes, such as those at Aldwych.|$|E

5|$|Examples {{of liquid}} {{crystals}} {{can also be}} found in the mineral world, most of them being lyotropics. The first discovered was Vanadium(V) oxide, by Zocher in 1925. Since then, few <b>others</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> discovered and studied in detail. The existence of a true nematic phase {{in the case of the}} smectite clays family was raised by Langmuir in 1938, but remained open for a very long time and was only solved recently. With the rapid development of nanosciences, and the synthesis of many new anisotropic nanoparticles, the number of such mineral liquid crystals is quickly increasing, with, for example, carbon nanotubes and graphene.|$|E
5|$|Following De la Fuente's {{departure}} from the group, most of the classic band members also left and established bands with similar names, including Germaín y sus Ángeles Negros and Los Ángeles de Chile. Guitarist Mario Gutiérrez continued {{to work with other}} musicians under the name of Los Ángeles Negros. Songs by Los Ángeles Negros have been covered by singers including Celia Cruz, Raphael, and José Luis Rodríguez, while <b>others</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> sampled by hip-hop and rap musicians such as Funkdoobiest, Damian Marley, the Beastie Boys, and Jay-Z.|$|E

5|$|In Maine, on {{the other}} side of the Atlantic, {{shifting}} fish populations due to changes in sea temperature are being blamed for the lack of availability of the herring which is the staple diet of the puffins in the area. Some adult birds have become emaciated and died. <b>Others</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> provisioning the nest with butterfish (Peprilus triacanthus) but these are often too large and deep-bodied for the chick to swallow, causing it to die from starvation. Maine is on the southerly edge of the bird's breeding range and with changing weather patterns, this may be set to contract northwards.|$|E
5|$|In their heraldic achievements, {{members of}} the Order of the Garter may {{encircle}} their escutcheon with the Garter. Knights and Ladies Companion are also entitled to receive heraldic supporters, a privilege granted to few other private individuals. While some families claim supporters by ancient use, and <b>others</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> granted them as a special reward, only {{members of the}} Royal Family, peers, Knights and Ladies Companion of the Garter, Knights and Ladies of the Thistle, and Knights and Dames Grand Cross of the junior orders of chivalry are automatically entitled to them.|$|E

Eko appears to briefly awaken and tells Locke that he must rescue Jack, Kate and Sawyer. Upon arriving at camp, Hurley informs the camp that Jack and the <b>others</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> captured. As an explanation, Locke announces to the survivors {{that he plans to}} rescue Jack, Kate, and Sawyer, as Desmond indicated to Hurley earlier. Hurley mentions to Charlie a sense of déjà vu.|$|E

5|$|Many {{bird species}} have {{established}} breeding populations in areas {{to which they}} have been introduced by humans. Some of these introductions have been deliberate; the ring-necked pheasant, for example, has been introduced around the world as a game bird. <b>Others</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> accidental, such as the establishment of wild monk parakeets in several North American cities after their escape from captivity. Some species, including cattle egret, yellow-headed caracara and galah, have spread naturally far beyond their original ranges as agricultural practices created suitable new habitat.|$|E
5|$|Numerous <b>others</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{referenced}} in dialogue. Several former companions of the Doctor are referenced in {{the story}} Death of the Doctor, and the episode also includes brief on-screen flashbacks showing the Third, Fourth and Tenth Doctors. Companion Harry Sullivan is referenced separately in dialogue on several occasions and {{a photograph of the}} character is visible in one episode. In an issue of Doctor Who Magazine, Sophie Aldred was read an email from Russell T. Davies, in which he declared his plans to bring Ace into a story had the show continued. The episode Sky was originally to have featured the Eleventh Doctor, but Matt Smith was not available.|$|E
5|$|The Great Wall of China visible today largely {{dates from}} the Ming dynasty, as they rebuilt much of the wall in stone and brick, often {{extending}} its line through challenging terrain. Some sections remain in relatively good condition or have been renovated, while <b>others</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> damaged or destroyed for ideological reasons, deconstructed for their building materials, or lost due to the ravages of time. For long an object of fascination for foreigners, the wall is now a revered national symbol and a popular tourist destination.|$|E

5|$|The three coves to {{the east}} of Helvellyn are all {{important}} sites for remnant populations of arctic-alpine plants. Species such as downy willow (Salix lapponum), mountain avens (Dryas octopetala), alpine mouse-ear (Cerastium alpinum), alpine meadowgrass (Poa alpina) and <b>others</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> able to survive in these coves since the last glaciation through a combination of rocks rich in basic minerals, a harsh micro-climate, and inaccessibility to grazing sheep on cliff ledges. However, these populations are small and are not reproducing well. Natural England has introduced a recovery plan for them.|$|E
5|$|The various {{historically}} driven {{changes have}} had a very significant influence on the architectural space of the city. Most other Polish cities have suffered similarly, but the processes in Białystok, {{have had a}} particularly intense course. Numerous historic works of architecture no longer exist, while many <b>others</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> rebuilt to their original configuration. Very few historic buildings of the city have been preserved – the sights are merely an echo of the old historical shape of Białystok.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} five {{different}} business routes of US Highway23 {{in the state}} of Michigan. These business routes were designated along former sections of US Highway23 (US23) to provide signed access from the main highway to the downtowns of cities bypassed by new routings of US23. Two are still extant, connecting through downtown Ann Arbor and Rogers City. Three <b>others</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> decommissioned. The former Business US23 (Bus. US23) in Fenton was split in half during the 1970s and later completely turned back to local control in 2006. The former business loops through Saginaw and Bay City were renumbered as business loops of Interstate 75 in the 1960s.|$|E
