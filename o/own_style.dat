5|$|Local {{residents}} have developed their <b>own</b> <b>style</b> in clothing and jewellery, using local products, such as shells. Giving somebody a shell necklace and placing {{it around the}} recipients neck is a goodwill and love gesture. They make a type of sarong, called a pareu, which is typically brightly coloured. Like the other islands of Melanesia such as Fiji and Samoa, the Cook Islanders {{are known for their}} hand-painted and silk-screened dress fabrics. An important practice among women is tivaevae, a type of quilting.|$|E
5|$|Miličević {{has also}} {{worked as a}} {{collaborator}} and music producer. Throughout the 2010s, he was featured on a recording with Dommin and collaborated with Ivy Levan {{on a number of}} releases, including Introducing the Dame (2013) and No Good (2015). Miličević has experimented with various guitar effects and introduced influences from several genres of music into his <b>own</b> <b>style.</b>|$|E
5|$|Saxophonists Parker and Lester Young were {{important}} influences on Tristano's development. Another major figure was pianist Art Tatum: Tristano practiced solo Tatum pieces {{early in his}} career, before gradually moving away from this influence {{in search of his}} <b>own</b> <b>style.</b> Bebopper Bud Powell also affected Tristano's playing and teaching, as he admired the younger pianist's articulation and expression.|$|E

5|$|The band {{unanimously}} {{decided to}} carry on and arrange auditions for new bassists, with a renewed fervor and determination. Several bassists auditioned, but the band picked Lamar Williams, {{an old friend of}} drummer Jai Johanny Johanson's from Gulfport, Mississippi. The band immediately recognized that Williams represented the best of both Oakley's style and his <b>own</b> <b>style,</b> and they were pleased with his easygoing demeanor. The addition of Leavell and Williams to the band brought about renewed passion and uplifted spirits within the group.|$|E
5|$|After Ueshiba's {{death in}} 1969, two more major styles emerged. Significant {{controversy}} arose with {{the departure of}} the Aikikai Hombu Dojo's chief instructor Koichi Tohei, in 1974. Tohei left {{as a result of a}} disagreement with the son of the founder, Kisshomaru Ueshiba, who at that time headed the Aikikai Foundation. The disagreement was over the proper role of ki development in regular aikido training. After Tohei left, he formed his <b>own</b> <b>style,</b> called Shin Shin Toitsu Aikido, and the organization that governs it, the Ki Society (Ki no Kenkyūkai).|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from these}} two long lasting {{newspaper}} comic strips, Vandersteen {{made a number of}} other comics in these years. Most important was his work for Ons Volkske, the youth supplement of the weekly magazine Ons Volk, which from the end of 1945 on became an independent comic magazine. Marc Sleen was editor-in-chief and filled most pages together with Vandersteen. Vandersteen created a number of realistic stories of about 20 pages each, where he developed his <b>own</b> <b>style</b> after starting very much as a follower of Harold Foster. In his usual more caricatural style, he created in August 1946 the recurring gagstrip De Vrolijke Bengels (The Happy Rascals). More adult comics appeared in the magazine Ons Volk.|$|E

5|$|Second, it {{was then}} that Japan {{underwent}} a period of intense Westernization in order to compete with other developed countries. Initially architects and styles from abroad were imported to Japan but gradually the country taught its own architects and began to express its <b>own</b> <b>style.</b> Architects returning from study with western architects introduced the International Style of modernism into Japan. However, it was not until after the Second World War that Japanese architects made an impression on the international scene, firstly with the work of architects like Kenzo Tange and then with theoretical movements like Metabolism.|$|E
5|$|The Bond {{character}} is a Secret Service agent, code number 007, residing in London but active internationally. Bond was a composite character who {{was based on a}} number of commandos whom Fleming knew during his service in the Naval Intelligence Division during the Second World War, to whom Fleming added his <b>own</b> <b>style</b> and a number of his own tastes; Bond's name was appropriated from the American ornithologist James Bond. Bond has a number of character traits which run throughout the books, including an enjoyment of cars, a love of food and drink, and an average intake of sixty custom-made cigarettes a day.|$|E
5|$|The {{music for}} Innocence was {{composed}} by Kazuhiro Nakamura, {{who had previously}} worked on the Time Crisis and Tekken series. The tracks were arranged {{with the help of}} Taisuke Sawachika. For his work on the game, Nakamura chose a different style of music from that of Motoi Sakuraba, who had handled the majority of previous Tales titles: he used ethnic music to distinguish it from earlier games. For the battle music, he used Sakuraba's battle compositions as a reference while keeping to his <b>own</b> <b>style.</b> The remixed and additional music for Innocence R was again handled and composed by Nakamura.|$|E

5|$|While in Lagos, Achebe {{started work}} on a novel. This was challenging, since very little African fiction had been written in English, {{although}} Amos Tutuola's Palm-Wine Drinkard (1952) and Cyprian Ekwensi's People of the City (1954) were notable exceptions. While appreciating Ekwensi's work, Achebe worked hard to develop his <b>own</b> <b>style,</b> even as he pioneered {{the creation of the}} Nigerian novel itself. A visit to Nigeria by Queen Elizabeth II in 1956 brought issues of colonialism and politics to the surface, and was a significant moment for Achebe.|$|E
5|$|After the {{departure}} of Patrick Vieira to Juventus, Fàbregas was given the Frenchman's number 4 shirt and featured regularly in the Arsenal central midfield alongside Gilberto Silva. He made 49 appearances in all competitions during the 2005–06 season. Despite his young age, his performances came under greater scrutiny due to his increased involvement in the first team. Further, as Fàbregas possessed a smaller frame and played with less aggression than Vieira, there were initially doubts over his ability {{to fill in the}} void left by the Frenchman. Nevertheless, Fàbregas asserted his <b>own</b> <b>style</b> of play and impressed pundits in the Champions League against Real Madrid and Juventus. In the latter, he scored Arsenal's first goal and set up Thierry Henry for the second, at the same time proving that he could compete against tough, hard-tackling midfielders like Vieira. He then played in the Final against his former club Barcelona, but Arsenal were defeated 2–1, completing a trophyless 2005–06 campaign for Arsenal.|$|E
5|$|New York faced similar {{architectural}} challenges, but {{in comparison}} to Chicago, skyscraper architects worked less closely with engineers and other specialists, and instead held strong backgrounds in the Beaux Arts movement and perceived their role to be primarily artistic rather than {{a partnership with the}} mechanical arts. Their practices tended to be smaller, resembling atelier style workshops. Structural engineers in New York took longer to build up a strong professional role there, a trend reflected in the lower engineering quality of many early skyscrapers in the city. The New York style emphasized stunning height and a somewhat eclectic use of architectural features from other periods, creating an energetic, flamboyant appearance. Towers were common, making best use of the relatively small plots of land in New York. Some New York skyscrapers emulated the tripartite style of Chicago, but others broke their exterior down into many different layers, each with its <b>own</b> <b>style.</b> Proponents argued that this reintroduced a sense of human proportion to these tall buildings; critics felt that the results were confusing and ungainly.|$|E
5|$|Later in 2001, {{numerous}} hip-hop artists including P. Diddy, Timbaland, Bubba Sparxxx and Everlast remixed famous {{songs from}} the band into hip-hop versions adding their <b>own</b> <b>styles</b> and modifications. The album was called New Old Songs.|$|R

5|$|The Halo series {{features}} voice work {{by television}} and film actors including Ron Perlman, Orlando Jones, Michelle Rodriguez, Robert Davi, and Terence Stamp. Voice acting became more important as Halo: Combat Evolveds sequels were developed; Halo 2 had 2,000 lines of combat dialogue, while Halo 3 has {{in excess of}} 14,000 lines. The actual technology for the trilogy changed very little; while some actors voiced their lines in remote locations, others traveled to Bungie to record their lines. In interviews, Halos voice actors stated {{that they had no}} idea that the games would become such a critical and commercial success. Steve Downes, the voice of the game's protagonist, stated that generally when a voice actor has finished their lines, their involvement with the game ends. As the characters in Combat Evolved were relatively undefined, the voice actors were given leeway to develop their <b>own</b> <b>style</b> and personality.|$|E
5|$|The co-main event {{featured}} a bout between two top contenders and undefeated light heavyweights, Lyoto Machida and Thiago Silva. The two were originally {{scheduled to meet}} at UFC 89, but a back injury forced Silva {{to withdraw from the}} contest. UFC President Dana White indicated in the pre-fight press conference that Machida would receive a title shot with a victory, while Silva would need to defeat Machida and win one more contest before earning the same opportunity. Machida is a fighter who prefers to counter-strike, and combines Shotokan Karate, sumo wrestling and Brazilian jiu-jitsu to form his <b>own</b> <b>style.</b> Silva is a Brazilian jiu-jitsu black belt, but prefers to fight standing. Machida entered the UFC 94 fight following a unanimous decision victory over former UFC Light Heavyweight Champion Tito Ortiz at UFC 84, where he won every round on the judge's scorecards. Thiago Silva entered the contest with 1st round TKOs over Antonio Mendes at UFC 84, and Houston Alexander at UFC 78.|$|E
5|$|The {{tour was}} titled Best of Both Worlds Tour after {{the song of}} the same name, which was the theme to Hannah Montana and was {{released}} on the series' first soundtrack. The title was chosen because of how the concert alternates between Cyrus performing as Hannah Montana and herself. She described the tour to differentiate the two according to their respective styles and depict how one girl was able to have two sides to her. She said the most notable difference between the two characters was the style of music, rather than physical appearance. According to her, Hannah Montana was direct pop music, while her <b>own</b> <b>style</b> was more rock music-oriented and included real-life scenarios set to tunes. Cyrus rehearsed for the tour simultaneous to filming the final episodes for the second season of Hannah Montana from September to October2007.|$|E

At Fitzroy, they came under the influence of former Victorian all-rounder Arthur Liddicut and the club's veteran captain Joe Plant. The Harveys had no formal coaching, and their father, although a regular presence at the club, chose to stay in the background as their respective careers developed. Horace did not advise his sons on how to bat, allowing them to formulate their <b>own</b> <b>style</b> and technique. According to the Harvey brothers, it was their mother who was vocal and extroverted, in contrast to their reserved father. The boys who failed to score runs were given kitchen duty and according to them, their parents never showed favouritism.|$|E
5|$|As the laneway {{meant that}} the playing area was long and narrow, the young boys also {{had to learn to}} play the ball {{straight}} in accordance with orthodox cricket technique. The Harveys played another form of cricket in their concreted backyard (using a marble instead of a ball) that sharpened their reflexes, and a miniature bat. All were right-handed batsmen with the exception of Neil. All the siblings attended the nearby George Street State School and, one by one, the brothers joined the Fitzroy Cricket Club as they reached their early teens.
