40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Physiology)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007. In the South African Mining Industry the Legislator has {{recognised}} {{the need}} to identify health hazards associated with any workplace or process and to assess,the associated risks (Leon, 1994). Neither the Mine Health and Safety Act (29 / 1996) and its Regulations, nor the Occupational Health and Safety Act (85 / 1993) and its Regulations, prescribe a specific format for the systematic and holistic approach to conduct <b>occupational</b> health <b>risk</b> assessments, but do prescribe some critical matters that should be addressed within an <b>occupational</b> health <b>risk</b> assessment. The need for a systematic, holistic approach for conducting an <b>occupational</b> health <b>risk</b> assessment is discussed by Smith (1999) in his article, Mine Occupational Health and Safety - towards a holistic solution. The article highlighted that a core concept arising from the Mine Health and Safety Act is {{the need to}} address occupational health issues from a systematic perspective that encompasses all aspects of the interaction of employees with the work environment. Guidelines for conducting <b>occupational</b> health <b>risk</b> assessments, as per legal requirement are limited in the mining industry. The absence of any specific model or guide usually results in the non-adherence or ignoring of the principles of occupational health, and that the principles of the <b>occupational</b> health <b>risk</b> assessment process are not explained to those developing their own approaches. The mining industry is also not aware of or focused on the key ingredients of an <b>occupational</b> health <b>risk</b> assessment and some of the potential pitfalls. The objective {{of the study was to}} research the principles of the <b>occupational</b> health <b>risk</b> assessment process. To develop and evaluate a holistic <b>occupational</b> health <b>risk</b> assessment model for the South African Mining Industry, based on the basic principles of occupational health and the legislative requirement for <b>occupational</b> health <b>risk</b> assessments. This will not only guide persons through conducting an <b>occupational</b> health <b>risk</b> assessment, but will also simplify the <b>occupational</b> health <b>risk</b> assessment process. However, still delivering scientifically sound assessment records to ensure an adequate A set of key elements (minimum components) for a comprehensive <b>occupational</b> health <b>risk</b> assessment process were identified. With the set of key elements identified, an audit protocol to evaluate current <b>occupational</b> health <b>risk</b> assessment processes (including procedures, systems and strategies) within the South African Mining Industry were developed. Audits were conducted and trends analysed to identify shortcomings in current applied <b>occupational</b> health <b>risk</b> assessment processes. Results from the study indicate that at present, <b>occupational</b> health <b>risks</b> are not properly quantified. A number of potential health hazards such as vibration, radiation (ionising and non-ionising radiation), ergonomics, psychological and biological stressors are in general excluded from current <b>occupational</b> health <b>risk</b> assessment scopes. <b>Occupational</b> hygiene measurement results and results from medical surveillance (when available) are seldom considered or used as information for the <b>occupational</b> health <b>risk</b> assessment or as part of the review of <b>occupational</b> health <b>risk</b> assessments. Sources of health hazards and risks are not properly identified, controlled and communicated to employers and employees. Interaction with employee representatives via the Health and Safety Committees or Representatives during the planning and conductance phases of the <b>occupational</b> health <b>risk</b> assessment process is limited. More than often the conductance of <b>occupational</b> health <b>risk</b> assessments is the responsibility of a single person without the use of "assessment teams". Consultation with the Health and Safety Committee I Representative before measures are determined to address identified health risks is absent in most cases. The outcome of <b>occupational</b> health <b>risk</b> assessments is not used to compile area risk profiles, man-job specifications or as a basis for occupational hygiene monitoring strategies, risk based medical surveillance or training on health hazards present in the workplace. These form the basis for the development of an occupational health programme and the absence of these could result in improper risk management and would negatively impact on the health status of the employees. The findings of the study confirm the central theoretical statement of the research project, i. e. that a need exists in the South African Mining Industry for a model, based on the requirements of the Mine Health and Safety Act (2911996) and other best practices, to guide employers through the fundamentals of a suitable and sufficient assessment of health risks. Although a large amount of risk assessment models are available of which some were analysed as part of the study, only a few of these models are occupational health specific, of which even fewer are mining specific or prescribe a specific format for a systematic and holistic approach to conduct <b>occupational</b> health <b>risk</b> assessments, in line with the requirements set by the Mine Health and Safety Act (29 / 1996) for the conductance and contents of an <b>occupational</b> health <b>risk</b> assessment. An <b>occupational</b> health <b>risk</b> assessment model, guidelines and templates were developed and tested through comprehensive <b>occupational</b> health <b>risk</b> assessments conducted at base for the development of all other occupational health systems and programmes. The focus of the study was the Mine Health and Safety Act (29 / 1996) and it's Regulations, with specific focus on Regulation 9 of the Act. The requirements set by this piece of legislation for conducting an <b>occupational</b> health <b>risk</b> assessment were studied in detail. Similar requirements for the South African Industry (other than mining) by the Occupational Health and Safety Act (85 / 1993), and specifically by the Hazardous Chemical Substances Regulations, Asbestos Regulations and Lead Regulations of the Act, were also studied. A comparison was drawn between the requirements of all these Regulations. International legislation and best practices on conducting <b>occupational</b> health <b>risk</b> assessments were also researched and compared to South African legislation and best practices. three different workplaces. The holistic model for the <b>occupational</b> health <b>risk</b> assessment process was evaluated against the requirements of the Mine Health and Safety Act (29 / 1996) and the ability of the model to guide employers through suitable and sufficient assessments of the health risks. It was proven that a holistic approach, as proposed by the research model, should be followed when conducting an <b>occupational</b> health <b>risk</b> assessment. One should visualise the <b>occupational</b> health <b>risk</b> assessment as the first step in a constantly reviewed occupational health management programme. In fact, an <b>occupational</b> health <b>risk</b> assessment should be the cornerstone for the development of all other occupational health systems and programmes. Doctora...|$|R
