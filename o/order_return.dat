40|$|We present {{evidence}} for a sequence of bifurcations in simulations of the differentially heated baroclinic rotating annulus, similar to bifurcations of the logistic map. The Met. Office / Oxford Rotating Annulus Laboratory Simulation (MORALS) code is used to construct a detailed numerical regime diagram for the annulus, {{and the distribution of}} regimes in parameter space is discussed. The bifurcations are observed in a sequence of runs at high temperature forcing, identified by Poincaré sections of the dominant temperature mode amplitude time series. Higher <b>order</b> <b>return</b> maps and predictions using quadratic fits to the data are used to verify this result, and Lyapunov exponents are calculated to identify and quantify the chaotic parts of the sequence. © 2008 Elsevier B.

40|$|Multiple {{scattering}} {{effects from}} spherical water particles of uniform diameter are studied for a W-band pulsed radar. The Gaussian transverse beam-profile and the rectangular pulse-duration {{are used for}} calculation. An second-order analytical solution is derived for a single layer structure, based on a time-dependent radiative transfer theory {{as described in the}} authors' companion paper. When the range resolution is fixed, increase in footprint radius leads to increase in the second order reflectivity that is defined as the ratio of the second <b>order</b> <b>return</b> to the first order one. This feature becomes more serious as the range increases. Since the spaceborne millimeter-wavelength radar has a large footprint radius that is competitive to the mean free path, the multiple scattering effect {{must be taken into account}} for analysis...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{test for the}} {{presence}} of jumps in asset prices. The test is derived from a di-rect application of Itô’s lemma to the semi-martingale process of asset prices. Intuitively, the proposed test measures the impact of jumps on the third and higher <b>order</b> <b>return</b> moments and is also directly related to the profit/loss function of a variance swap replication strategy. We derive its asymptotic distribution and perform extensive simulations to examine the finite sample properties. Compared to Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard’s bi-power variation test, the test proposed in this paper has a faster rate of convergence to its asymptotic dis-tribution and is more powerful in detecting jumps. Moreover, in the presence of i. i. d. market microstructure noise, we show that the jump test remains valid with a modified asymptotic variance that is derived in closed form...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new test for jumps in asset prices that is {{motivated}} by the literature on variance swaps. Formally, the test follows by a direct application of Itô’s lemma to the semi-martingale process of asset prices and derives its power from the impact of jumps on the third and higher <b>order</b> <b>return</b> moments. Intuitively, the test statistic reflects the cumulative gain of a variance swap replication strategy which {{is known to be}} minimal in the absence of jumps but substantial in the presence of jumps. Simulations show that the jump test has nice properties and is generally more powerful than the widely used bi-power variation test. An important feature of our test is that it can be applied-in analytically modified form-to noisy high frequency data and still retain power. As a by-product of our analysis, we obtain novel analytical results regarding the impact of noise on bi-power variation. An empirical illustration using IBM trade data is also included...|$|E
40|$|SummaryOn the 9 th October, 2014 {{a strong}} event hit {{the central part}} of Liguria Region {{producing}} disastrous consequences to the city of Genoa where the Bisagno Creek flooded causing one death and lots of damage. The precipitation pattern responsible for the event had peculiar spatial and temporal characteristics that led to an unexpected flash flood. The temporal sequence of rainfall intensities and the particular severity of rainfall showers at small temporal scale, together with the size of the sub-basin hit by the most intense part of the rainfall were the unfortunate concurrent ingredients that led to an “almost perfect” flash flood. The peak flow was estimated to be a 100 – 200 years <b>order</b> <b>return</b> period. The effects of the spatial and temporal scales of the precipitation pattern were investigated by coupling a rainfall downscaling model with a hydrological model setting up an experiment that follows a probabilistic approach. Supposing that the correct volume of precipitation at different spatial and temporal scales is known, the experiment provided the probability of generating events with similar effects in terms of streamflow. Furthermore, the study gives indications regarding the goodness and reliability of the forecasted rainfall field needed, {{not only in terms of}} total rainfall volume, but even in spatial and temporal pattern, to produce the observed ground effects in terms of streamflow...|$|E
40|$|Shor's {{factoring}} algorithm (SFA), by {{its ability}} to efficiently factor large numbers, {{has the potential to}} undermine contemporary encryption. At its heart is a process called order finding, which quantum mechanics lets us perform efficiently. SFA thus consists of a quantum order finding algorithm (QOFA), bookended by classical routines which, given the <b>order,</b> <b>return</b> the factors. But, with probability up to 1 / 2, these classical routines fail, and QOFA must be rerun. We modify these routines using elementary results in number theory, improving the likelihood that they return the factors. The resulting quantum factoring algorithm is better than SFA at factoring safe semiprimes, an important class of numbers used in cryptography. With just one call to QOFA, our algorithm almost always factors safe semiprimes. As well as a speed-up, improving efficiency gives our algorithm other, practical advantages: unlike SFA, it does not need a randomly picked input, making it simpler to construct in the lab; and in the (unlikely) case of failure, the same circuit can be rerun, without modification. We consider generalizing this result to other cases, although we do not find a simple extension, and conclude that SFA is still the best algorithm for general numbers (non safe semiprimes, in other words). Even so, we present some simple number theoretic tricks for improving SFA in this case.

40|$|Reducing {{offending}} is a main aim of {{the probation}} service, but few mechanisms exist to monitor how this is achieved. This paper describes how information about reconvic-tions can provide routine feedback about effectiveness in combating offending. Using a reconviction predictor, outcome, in terms of reconviction rate, can be evaluated against predicted outcome. A predictor was validated for use in Inner London using case records. Information was obtained retrospectively about offenders {{at the start of}} their probation orders, and about subsequent reconvictions over thirteen months of probation. The predictor was found to have considerable predictive power. The predictor was piloted for routine use by probation officers, and a customized version of the predictor was developed. The research is now moving into a third stage, of developing an end of probation <b>order</b> <b>return</b> which will supply information about reconvictions. Issues relating to the use of reconvictions as a performance indicator, and questions of implementation, arc discussed. Combating offending is central to the day-to-day work of probation officers; crime reduction is the raison d'etre of the probation service (Inner London Probation Service, 1993), and yet information about the reconvictions of offenders supervised by the service is rarely available. A reason for this lack of feedback might be its limited value to indi-vidual probation officers, teams and projects. If a team has a lower than average rate of reconvictions, who can say whether this is because of the efforts of its officers, or because it has an 'easier ' (i. e. less ser-iously or actively offending) than average caseload? The work described in this paper was carried out to find ways of answering these questions...|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} impact of {{negative}} returns {{on the health of}} a given financial portfolio. It is often the case that a series of significant negative returns trigger a credit event such as a downgrade in rating, or even a default of the portfolio owner. We focus our attention on a Weighted Average of <b>Ordered</b> <b>Returns,</b> which is a statistic that allows us to weight returns according to their relative adverse impact. We use an option pricing approach to derive the theoretical price and properties of a forward, a swap contract, a call and a put option written on the Weighted Average of <b>Ordered</b> <b>Returns</b> under different assumptions about the distribution of returns. The models of returns considered in this paper are defined by the following underlying price processes: geometric Brownian motion, Merton model with Poisson jumps, and GARCH model. We present a convergence result which states that the price of a forward on the Weighted Average of <b>Ordered</b> <b>Returns</b> converges to the theoretical law invariant coherent risk measure. Finally, we show that the forward price process itself satisfies the axioms of a dynamic coherent risk measures...|$|R
