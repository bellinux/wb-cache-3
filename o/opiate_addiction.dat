25|$|Pain is {{typically}} treated with opioids, varying in potency {{based on the}} severity of symptoms. When opioids are used for prolonged periods, drug tolerance, chemical dependency, and addiction may occur. <b>Opiate</b> <b>addiction</b> is not typically a concern since the condition {{is not likely to}} ever completely disappear. Thus, lifelong treatment with opioids is fairly common for chronic pain symptoms, accompanied by periodic titration that is typical of any long-term opioid regimen.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{medications}} {{have been approved}} {{for the treatment of}} substance abuse. These include replacement therapies such as buprenorphine and methadone as well as antagonist medications like disulfiram and naltrexone in either short acting, or the newer long acting form. Several other medications, often ones originally used in other contexts, have also been shown to be effective including bupropion and modafinil. Methadone and buprenorphine are sometimes used to treat <b>opiate</b> <b>addiction.</b> These drugs are used as substitutes for other opioids and still cause withdrawal symptoms.|$|E

40|$|Substance {{dependence}} is {{a complex}} environmental and genetic disorder with significant social and medical concerns. Understanding the etiology of substance dependence is imperative {{to the development of}} effective treatment and prevention strategies. To this end, substantial effort has been made to identify genes underlying substance dependence, and in recent years, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have led to discoveries of numerous genetic variants for complex diseases including substance dependence. Most of the GWAS discoveries were only based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and a single dichotomized outcome. By employing both SNP- and gene-based methods of analysis, we identified a strong (odds ratio = 13. 87) and significant (P value = 1. 33 E− 11) association of an SNP in the NCK 2 gene on chromosome 2 with <b>opiates</b> <b>addiction</b> in African-origin men. Codependence analysis also identified a genome-wide significant association between NCK 2 and comorbidity of substance dependence (P value = 3. 65 E− 08) in African-origin men. Furthermore, we observed that the association between the NCK 2 gene (P value = 3. 12 E− 10) and <b>opiates</b> <b>addiction</b> reached the gene-based genome-wide significant level. In summary, our findings provided the first evidence for the involvement of NCK 2 in the susceptibility to <b>opiates</b> <b>addiction</b> and further revealed the racial and gender specificities of its impact...|$|R
500|$|Psychiatric geneticists John I. Nurnberger, Jr., and Laura Jean Bierut {{suggest that}} {{alcoholism}} {{does not have}} a single cause—including genetic—but that genes do play an important role [...] "by affecting processes in the body and brain that interact with one another and with an individual's life experiences to produce protection or susceptibility". They also report that fewer than a dozen alcoholism-related genes have been identified, but that more likely await discovery. At least one genetic test exists for an allele that is correlated to alcoholism and <b>opiate</b> <b>addiction.</b> Human dopamine receptor genes have a detectable variation referred to as the DRD2 TaqI polymorphism. Those who possess the A1 allele (variation) of this polymorphism have a small but significant tendency towards addiction to opiates and endorphin-releasing drugs like alcohol. Although this allele is slightly more common in alcoholics and opiate addicts, it is not by itself an adequate predictor of alcoholism, and some researchers argue that evidence for DRD2 is contradictory.|$|E

This study was done for determination of related factors with vessels involved in coronary artery angiography. Materials and Methods: In this descriptive and analytical study, 2390 patients'. were selected via census sampling from Kosar Angiography center in the Golestan province. Data gathering form included data such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, diabetes, smoking and <b>opiates</b> <b>addiction</b> history.

40|$|<b>Opiates</b> <b>addiction</b> is {{characterized}} by its long-term persistence. In order to study the enduring changes in long-term memory in hippocampus, a pivotal region for this process, we used suppression subtractive hybridization to compare hippocampal gene expression in morphine and saline-treated rats. Animals were subjected to an extended place preference paradigm consisting of four conditioning phases. Sensitization to the reinforcing effects of the drug occurred after three conditioning phases. After 25 days of treatment rats were euthanized and the complementary DNA (cDNA) from the hippocampus of morphine-dependent and saline-treated animals were then screened for differentially expressed cDNAs. The selected 177 clones were then subjected to a microarray procedure and 20 clones were found differentially regulated.

5000|$|The RMTg plays a [...] "crucial role" [...] in the {{regulation}} of dopaminergic neuronal activity in {{the central nervous system}} by endogenous opioids and opiate drugs. The GABAergic neurons that project from the RMTg to the midbrain dopaminergic nuclei (i.e., the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra pars compacta) express μ-opioid receptors. Current evidence suggests that exogenous opiates (e.g., morphine and heroin) excite the dopamine pathways originating in the VTA by activating the μ-opioid receptors in neurons projecting from the RMTg; opioid activation of these neurons leads to disinhibition of the GABAergic brake on dopamine networks. Since RMTg projections to the VTA are the primary inhibitor of the dopaminergic pathways that are implicated in addiction (e.g., the mesolimbic pathway), the RMTg plays {{a significant role in the}} development of <b>opiate</b> <b>addictions.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Meprobamate is a Schedule IV drug (US) (S5 in South Africa) {{under the}} Convention on Psychotropic Substances. [...] With {{protracted}} use {{it can cause}} physical dependence and a potentially life-threatening abstinence syndrome {{similar to that of}} barbiturates and alcohol (delerium tremens). For this reason, discontinuation is often achieved through an extended regimen of slowly decreasing doses over a period of weeks, or even months. Alternatively, the patient may be switched to a longer-acting gabaergic agent such as diazepam (in a manner similar to the use of methadone therapy for <b>opiate</b> <b>addiction)</b> before attempting de-titration.|$|E
2500|$|Examples of {{drug and}} {{behavioral}} addictions include: alcoholism, amphetamine addiction, cocaine addiction, nicotine addiction, <b>opiate</b> <b>addiction,</b> food addiction, gambling addiction, and sexual addiction.

[...] The term addiction is misused frequently to refer to other compulsive behaviors or disorders, particularly dependence, in news media. An important distinction between drug addiction and dependence is that drug dependence is a disorder in which cessation of drug use results in an unpleasant state of withdrawal, {{which can lead to}} further drug use.

There is more than enough anecdotal evidence to suggest that this offers a plausible route to an abstinence based model; however, no clinical trials have ever tested this hypothesis. A recent study indicates that apomorphine might be a suitable marker for assessing central dopamine system alterations associated with chronic heroin consumption.

2500|$|Throughout Europe {{there is}} growing {{acceptance}} within the medical community {{of the use of}} slow release oral morphine as a substitution treatment alternative to methadone and buprenorphine for patients not able to tolerate the side-effects of buprenorphine and methadone.

40|$|The DSM-IV has {{modelled}} {{pathological gambling}} aftersubstance dependence (1). Symptoms defining patho-logical gambling strongly resemble those for substance de-pendence (for example, preoccupation with gambling, tolerance to gambling-related excitement, gambling-related withdrawal symptoms, and repeated efforts {{to cut down}} or stop gambling [2]). Further, treatment approaches for prob-lem gambling have tended to resemble those offered to sub-stance abusers, including residential, outpatient, and self-help approaches such as Gamblers Anonymous (3). Discussions of treatment for both chemical and behavioural addictions com-monly employ concepts such as high-risk situations, relapse prevention, urges and cravings, denial, abstinence, and with-drawal. Not surprisingly, a considerable body of research has established a robust relation between chemical dependencies and pathological gambling (4, 5). In general, higher rates of al-coholism and other substance use have been reported among gamblers, compared with the general population (6 – 8).

This selective review outlines and highlights {{the need for a}} multi-method translational approach to genetic studies of these important conditions, including both licit (alcohol, nicotine) and illicit (cannabis, cocaine, <b>opiates)</b> drug <b>addictions</b> and the behavioral addiction of disordered gambling. First, we review existing knowledge from twin studies that indicates both the substantial heritability of substance-specific addictions and the genetic overlap across addiction to different substances. Next, we discuss the limited number of candidate genes which have shown consistent replication, and the implications of emerging genomewide association findings for the genetic architecture of addictions. Finally, we review the utility of extensions to existing methods such as novel phenotyping, including the use of endophenotypes, biomarkers and neuroimaging outcomes; emerging methods for identifying alternative sources of genetic variation and accompanying statistical methodologies to interpret them; the role of gene-environment interplay; and importantly, the potential role of genetic variation in suggesting new alternatives for treatment of addictions. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved...|$|R
