25|$|The {{formaldehyde}} {{surrounding the}} shark, Hirst says, {{is the process}} of death and decay. Though formaldehyde is used as a preservation means, over time, the object being preserved will soon wilt, flake, and wrinkle. Because the sculpture itself was made in 1991, the shark is very much rotting and deformed due to the formaldehyde taking its toll on the corpse. With the corpse rotting away, it symbolizes that no matter how well we take care of ourselves or how timeless we think we are, <b>our</b> <b>mind</b> will start to fade away and we slowly will begin to forget.|$|E
25|$|This sentimental, anti-intellectual form of pietism {{is seen in}} {{the thought}} and {{teaching}} of Zinzendorf, founder of the Moravians; but more intellectually rigorous forms of pietism are seen in the teachings of John Wesley, which were themselves influenced by Zinzendorf, and in the teachings of American preachers Jonathan Edwards, who restored to pietism Gerson's focus on obedience and borrowed from early church teachers Origen and Gregory of Nyssa the notion that humans yearn for God, and John Woolman, who combined a mystical view of the world with a deep concern for social issues; like Wesley, Woolman was influenced by Jakob Böhme, William Law and The Imitation of Christ. The combination of pietistic devotion and mystical experiences that are found in Woolman and Wesley are also found in their Dutch contemporary Tersteegen, who brings back the notion of the nous ("mind") as the site of God's interaction with our souls; through the work of the Spirit, <b>our</b> <b>mind</b> is able to intuitively recognize the immediate presence of God in our midst.|$|E

500|$|In Chapter 2 of the Proslogion, Anselm defined God as a [...] "being than {{which no}} greater can be conceived". He {{suggested}} that even [...] "the fool" [...] can understand this concept, and this understanding itself {{means that the}} being must exist in the mind. The concept must exist either only in <b>our</b> <b>mind,</b> or in both <b>our</b> <b>mind</b> and in reality. If such a being exists only in <b>our</b> <b>mind,</b> then a greater being—that which exists in the mind and in reality—can be conceived (this argument is generally regarded as a reductio ad absurdum because {{the view of the}} fool is proven to be inconsistent). Therefore, if we can conceive of a being than which nothing greater can be conceived, it must exist in reality. Thus, a being than which nothing greater could be conceived, which Anselm defined as God, must exist in reality.|$|E

500|$|The film {{received}} positive {{attention by}} film critics {{and seems to}} have been well-staged because a reviewer of The Moving Picture News states, [...] "This film points a moral and adorns a tale. Clean as a hound's tooth, sweet as a nut. Full of life. The tale of the triumph of a courageous girl, backed by an inimitable office boy, and the downfall of the grafter are well planned and well rendered. The copy room set <b>our</b> <b>mind</b> flying back to our own 'cub' days. By the way, the paper {{on the wall of the}} traction company office is somewhat weird. A good, healthy, vigorous production in every sense." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror reviewer said the acting was good, but found fault with the plot itself. The reviewer states, [...] "This film story has melodramatic interest, and the acting is good, but the means by which some of the incidents are brought about will not stand the acid test. For instance, if a political boss wants to 'shake down' a traction company for $5,000, would he submit the proposition in writing? ... The scenes in the newspaper reporters' room would have been more convincing in the first scene if the staff had been more busy in writing copy instead of waving their arms and moving about."

500|$|Seven CBS Sports analysts {{predicted}} a Bears victory, with Pete Prisco {{being the only}} one to favor the Browns. Jeff Joniak stated that the Bears had to attack the Browns' 3–4 defense, who ranked third in yards per pass attempt allowed at 5.32, with their fifth-ranked passing offense. Chicago's wide receiver duo of Marshall and Alshon Jeffery should also be utilized, as Joe Haden and Buster Skrine are at a size mismatch (Marshall is 5 inches and 40 pounds larger than Haden, while Jeffery is 6 inches and 30 pounds heavier than Skrine). Browns offensive coordinator Ray Horton commented, [...] "This team, Chicago, is a lot like Detroit in that they have weapons at every position. Brandon Marshall and Alshon Jeffery have the most catches in the league. They have the most combined yards in the league. They are both, in <b>our</b> <b>mind,</b> No. 1 receivers. They present a challenge that you can’t double everybody. You can’t roll up to one guy because the other guy’s open." [...] On defense, the Bears had to contain Josh Gordon and Jordan Cameron. Gordon ranks second in yards after catch, while leading all receivers with 71 for an average of 19.7 yards. Cameron leads all tight ends with 23 third down catches. The Bears' worst-ranked run defense also has to defend against the Browns, which had the third-fewest rushing attempts in the league with 290 with an average of 3.78 yards, {{which is one of the}} bottom six in the league.|$|E

According to the [...] "transcendental unity of apperception", the concepts of the mind (Understanding) and the perceptions or intuitions that garner information from phenomena (Sensibility) are synthesized by comprehension.

2500|$|Aristotle {{believed}} {{the chain of}} thought, which ends in recollection of certain [...] "imprints", was connected systematically in three sorts of relationships: similarity, contrast, and contiguity.

Aristotle believed that past experiences are hidden within <b>our</b> <b>mind.</b> A force operates to awaken the hidden material {{to bring up the}} actual experience. According to Aristotle, association is the power innate in a mental state, which operates upon the unexpressed remains of former experiences, allowing them to rise and be recalled.|$|E

[...] The occurrence of hallucinations, that is, perceptual experiences 'having the character of sense perception, but without relevant or adequate sensory stimulation ', have long {{been one of the}} standard objections to the philosophical theory of direct realism.
