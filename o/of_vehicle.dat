5|$|In {{the first}} episode the camera follows a BA Falcon, a model <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> which was not {{released}} until late 2002. This was some 7 years after the scene was set.|$|E
5|$|It debuted {{the first}} Lexus high-intensity {{discharge}} headlights {{for the high}} beam (Bi-Xenon), and also the first AFS adaptive curve headlights, which swiveled the projector headlamps in the direction <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> turns.|$|E
5|$|By 14:00 the 4th Parachute Brigade was {{no further}} forward. With {{casualties}} mounting, Brigadier Hackett asked General Urquhart's permission to withdraw {{south of the}} railway line. His intention was to move through Wolfheze and into Oosterbeek where the division's support units waited. The change of direction was further complicated by the lack <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> crossings along the railway lineâ€”there were only two, one at Wolfheze and the other at Oosterbeek.|$|E

40|$|The total {{emission}} level is {{heavily dependent on}} the number <b>of</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Additionally, the type <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> and their age structures are very important. The structure <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> also depends {{on the type of}} the road. The article presents the results of calculations of the pollutants emission from the road transport. Total emission was calculated with combination of the investigation results i. e. the type <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> and their age structures for different types of roads. The investigations have been made for different classes of roads with different types <b>of</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The traffic line has been recorded in the same length of time. On the basis of analysis of the recorded traffic line, the number and the type <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> have been estimated. The classification <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> have been made according to the level of emission i. e. passenger cars, light duty vehicles, heavy duty vehicles, busses and others, taking into consideration the age structures <b>of</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The level <b>of</b> total traffic emission has been calculated on the basis of results. There has been used the Copert programme methodology. The results of the calculations have been made with combination of the type of road, the speed <b>of</b> <b>vehicles,</b> the type <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> and their age structure, are presented...|$|R
30|$|The last {{parameter}} {{we consider}} in our evaluation {{is the average}} percentage <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> receiving the broadcast packet. This is calculated by dividing the number <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> that successfully receive the packet {{by the total number}} <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> in the area of interest.|$|R
5|$|Control of roads. Regulate, restrict, {{control or}} {{prohibit}} {{the use of}} a road or waterway by any person or class of persons; or any vehicle or vessel, or type or description <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> or vessel. In addition, can issue permits to regulate, restrict, control or prohibit persons or classes of persons from travelling in any bus, car, train or other vehicle, or in a vessel.|$|E
5|$|However, this winding route {{proved to}} be too {{dangerous}} and difficult for the explosion <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> traffic that occurred after World War II. Alvinston was originally reliant on the Canada Southern Railroad, which {{was taken over by}} the Michigan Central Railway and that by New York Central. However, by 1960 the use of the rails had declined so much that service was stopped. The tracks were lifted two years later.|$|E
5|$|Many regions have {{prescribed}} standards which ambulances should, or must, meet {{in order}} to be used for their role. These standards may have different levels which reflect the type of patient which the ambulance is expected to transport (for instance specifying a different standard for routine patient transport than high dependency), or may base standards on the size <b>of</b> <b>vehicle.</b>|$|E

30|$|It {{is noted}} that delays of STDMA are {{independent}} of the number <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> while PDR decrease with the number. This is because delay is mainly attributes to queuing delay, which is determined by (1) message generation time and (2) time assigned for each <b>vehicle,</b> both <b>of</b> which {{are independent of}} the number <b>of</b> <b>vehicles.</b> In contrast, PDR is significantly affected by the number <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> because the probability of packet collision rises with the number <b>of</b> <b>vehicles.</b> More specifically, packet collision happens when more than two vehicles choose the same time slot; the probability that more than two vehicles choose the same slot increases with the number <b>of</b> <b>vehicles.</b>|$|R
30|$|From Eqs. 2 to 4, B {{represents}} the set <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> that possess the negative message, V denotes the set <b>of</b> all <b>vehicles</b> in VANET, and C {{refers to a}} set <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> that concern the message.|$|R
5|$|Sales {{and profits}} grew {{year-on-year}} {{during the early}} 1950s. The prepayment from the government was repaid in 1952. For a short time, VAT imported and marketed clearing tractors produced by Italian firm Ansaldo-Fossati. Although there was demand for this type <b>of</b> <b>vehicle,</b> they sold poorly because their price was considered inconsistent with their technical quality; only a few units were delivered in 1953.|$|E
5|$|The charges vary {{according}} to the type <b>of</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Motorcycles are free but there are standard charges for cars, two-axle goods vehicles and larger vehicles with more than two axles. Drivers who fail to pay the charge are issued with a penalty charge notice. There are no signs warning of penalty charges.|$|E
5|$|The engine can {{accommodate}} high-load operating conditions {{and has been}} designed for low-speed operation. It can carry up to 260kilograms. The hovercraft is equipped with GPS and the construction costs are lower than usual for this type <b>of</b> <b>vehicle.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 2006, {{the sales}} <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> made in NAFTA states totaled 5.5 million, while the sale <b>of</b> {{imported}} <b>vehicles</b> totaled 2.2 million. 923,000 vehicles were imported from Japan, {{making it the}} greatest exporter <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> to the US. Germany was the second largest exporter <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> to the US, with 534,000 units exported to the US in 2006. Imports from all other nations, except Germany and Japan, totaled 729,000.|$|R
30|$|According to [47], in Ref. [46] {{the trip}} table is wrongly labeled {{thousands}} <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> per day; the correct unit should be hundreds <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> per day.|$|R
30|$|The system {{generates a}} number of samples adapted to the number <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> <b>of</b> the scene at each instant. The greater the number <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> the greater {{dimension}} of the state vector and number of posterior evaluations.|$|R
5|$|The purpose <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> and {{equipment}} camouflage differs from personal camouflage {{in that the}} primary threat is aerial reconnaissance. The goal is to disrupt the characteristic shape of the vehicle, to reduce shine, {{and to make the}} vehicle difficult to identify even if it is spotted.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with several}} other roads in the Highlands, the A82 between Tyndrum and Glencoe has been {{installed}} with permanent gates that are closed {{in the event of}} severe weather. These gates are now fitted with fibre-optic illuminated signs. The road has been identified as one of several trunk roads in the Highlands that suffers from problems with deer-vehicle collisions. In 1996, Transport Scotland set up a number <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> activated warning signs alerting drivers attention to nearby deer. Four of these signs are on the A82 between Tyndrum and Glencoe.|$|E
5|$|Communication {{between human}} and horse is {{paramount}} in any equestrian activity; to aid this process horses are usually ridden with a saddle {{on their backs}} to assist the rider with balance and positioning, and a bridle or related headgear to assist the rider in maintaining control. Sometimes horses are ridden without a saddle, and occasionally, horses are trained to perform without a bridle or other headgear. Many horses are also driven, which requires a harness, bridle, and some type <b>of</b> <b>vehicle.</b>|$|E
40|$|Accurate {{analysis}} of electromagnetic wave propagation in tunnels has important {{applications in the}} areas of mobile and wireless communications. In this paper a fully vectorial finite element base propagation model is developed for blocked straight and curved tunnels. Effect <b>of</b> different <b>vehicles,</b> location <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> and number <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> inside tunnels is analysed. It is shown that the basic propagation loss inside tunnels is mainly determined by the number <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> and their size. Location <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> have influence on radio wave propagation only in curved tunnels. K e y w o r d s: finite element method, parabolic equation method, curved tunnels, blocked tunnels...|$|R
50|$|Unlike auto rows where {{multiple}} dealerships {{are clustered}} together, car supermarkets are a single company offering a spread <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> from most <b>of</b> the major manufactures, whilst some dealership groups advertise {{as having a}} large choice <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> in Group stock, often this translates to a small number <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> per location {{and should not be}} regarded as a car supermarket.|$|R
40|$|The model {{estimates}} the number <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> <b>of</b> a fleet {{that are necessary}} to meet the expected requests, as well as the estimated number of bays needed to ensure the temporary parking <b>of</b> the <b>vehicles</b> in use or charging at any time. The model allows to reproduce the service trend during a typical day, simulating the pickup requests at each station and the trip <b>of</b> each <b>vehicle</b> from the pickup to the return station; the model monitors the number <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> at every station, therefore allowing an estimate of the minimum number of bays per station and of the number <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> in order to satisfy the expected requests...|$|R
5|$|Despite strong {{evidence}} linking the gang to a spate <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> thefts along the A1 road, Ross {{is unable to}} persuade his superior, Sergeant Pearson (Arthur Rigby), to investigate the cafÃ©. He therefore pursues the matter on his own, confronting Diamond with his knowledge and forcing the gangster to bribe him {{in exchange for his}} silence. When Pearson learns of Ross' private investigation, he threatens the officer's job, causing tension between Ross and his wife Joan (Patricia Heneghan).|$|E
5|$|During 1958â€“1960 VAT focused {{increasingly}} on custom-building vehicles {{according to}} customer request. Typically a potential customer just {{walked into the}} main office in Helsinki or factory in HÃ¤meenlinna and described what kind <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> he wanted. The enthusiastic engineers listened carefully to every individual customer's wishes and designed vehicles accordingly, {{with two or three}} axles, desired layout, wheelbase and with conventional or forward control cabin. Many vehicle types were only produced for one or two units. The volume model, however, was a nine-tonne variant of the VAK series.|$|E
5|$|Holden's second {{full-scale}} car factory, {{located in}} Fishermans Bend (Port Melbourne), {{was completed in}} 1936, with construction beginning in 1939 on a new plant in Pagewood, New South Wales. However, World War II delayed car production with efforts shifted to the construction <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> bodies, field guns, aircraft and engines. Before the war ended, the Australian Government took steps to encourage an Australian automotive industry. Both GM and Ford provided studies to the Australian Government outlining {{the production of the}} first Australian-designed car. Ford's proposal was the government's first choice, but required substantial financial assistance. GM's study was ultimately chosen because of its low level of government intervention. After the war, Holden returned to producing vehicle bodies, this time for Buick, Chevrolet, Pontiac and Vauxhall. The Oldsmobile Ace was also produced from 1946 to 1948.|$|E

5|$|In 1931, McAloney {{purchased}} a garage and engineering workshop in Wirrulla. He operated the establishment {{for the next}} five years, the business conducting work on various types <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> including cars, trucks and tractors. However, the business ultimately experienced financial difficulties and was forced to close. In a ceremony on 24 June 1935, McAloney wed Dora Winifred Johnson. The couple had seven children: sons William (Bill), John and Paul; and daughters Glenice, Rae, Anne and Judith.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, Bell Labs {{formulated}} {{their own}} set of requirements for radar work in relation to Nike-X. Working with the Army, Air Force, Lincoln Labs and ARPA, the Nike-X Reentry Measurements Program (RMP) ran {{a long series of}} reentry measurements with the Project PRESS radars, especially TRADEX. Additionally, a Lockheed EC-121 Warning Star aircraft was refit with optical and infrared telescopes for optical tracking tests. The first series of tests, RMP-A, focused on modern conical reentry vehicles. It concluded on 30 June 1966. These demonstrated that these vehicles were difficult to discriminate because of their low drag. RMP-B ran between 1967 and 1970, supported by 17 launches from Vandenberg, with a wide variety <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> shapes and penetration aids.|$|E
5|$|Not {{included}} in the official number of fatalities were deaths that were recorded as pneumonia. Workers alleged that this diagnosis was a cover for death from carbon monoxide poisoning (brought on {{by the use of}} gasoline-fueled vehicles in the diversion tunnels), and a classification used by Six Companies to avoid paying compensation claims. The site's diversion tunnels frequently reached , enveloped in thick plumes <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> exhaust gases. A total of 42workers were recorded as having died from pneumonia; none were listed as having died from carbon monoxide poisoning. No deaths of non-workers from pneumonia were recorded in Boulder City during the construction period.|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} measure this parameter, {{we focus on}} the average number <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> {{rebroadcasting}} a packet. We consider that a given vehicle rebroadcasts a packet after a successful reception and the broadcast algorithm retransmits such packet. Furthermore, the packet retransmission rate is calculated by dividing the total number <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> retransmitting the packet by the total <b>of</b> number <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> successfully receiving it.|$|R
25|$|A {{comparison}} of the type <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> entering the ZTL by engine standard {{with respect to the}} months of October and November 2007 found {{that there has been a}} change in the composition of the fleet entering the restricted area, with a sharp reduction <b>of</b> older <b>vehicles</b> with lower emission standard engines. The number <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> subject to the charge fell by 56.4%, representing an average reduction <b>of</b> 21,274 <b>vehicles</b> per day, with a greater variation among auto drivers when compared to commercial <b>vehicles.</b> The number <b>of</b> exempt <b>vehicles</b> grew by 4.3%, for an average increase <b>of</b> 2.248 <b>vehicles</b> a day.|$|R
