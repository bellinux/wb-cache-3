This chapter explores if and how a rights-based approach to development could ever be carried to its logical conclusion; by holding states accountable for violations of the right to development. In doing so, a distinction is made between the internal and external dimension of the right. The chapter demonstrates that finding state responsibility for breaches of the external dimension, which contains obligations of a state towards people outside of its jurisdiction and <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> <b>cooperate</b> with other states, would require a great deal of adjustments to the present framework of applicable international rules. Finally, it explores what role the concepts of intergenerational equity and common but differentiated responsibility could play in supporting such adjustments...|$|R

The right to a favorable environment in addition begins to be understood as a human right, which can be claimed at the international level. The courts handle disputes through judgements, but they also provide advisory opinions, impose provisional measures or <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> <b>cooperate</b> with the other party, they often help to define legal principles. They contribute to the legal certainity and because of the persuasiveness of thein arguments, their jurisprudence acts similar to precedent.

The research questions are: 1) How have trade relations with the EU evolved since the EEA Agreement entered into force?; 2) What can explain Norway’s adaptations to the EU? The article shows that Norway has adapted fully on areas covered by formal EEA obligations. However, Norway has gone even further in its adaptations to the EU. These “voluntary” adaptations can partly be explained by an economic logic where issue-linkages and domestic economic interests are at play, and partly by the authorities’ perceived constraints and <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> <b>cooperate</b> with the EU in trade liberalization. The article shows how a combination of institutional constraints and balancing of economic interests has shaped Norway’s adaptations to the EU, also in areas that were not originally part of the requirements of the EEA Agreement...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the compatibility of {{public international law}} with behavioral economic models on resource extraction, specifically those theories that express what tragedy and fears one ought to expect from such endeavors. The reason behind the analysis {{is to examine the}} rigidity and ability of the law to cope with resource extraction in outer space. As will be shown in this thesis, the law as it stands today is inadequate to cope with such fears for primarily four reasons. Firstly, the principle of freedom entitles States to exploit resources in outer space and can thus enable tragedy, i. e. overexploitation of resources. Secondly, sovereignty entitles States to act selfishly when extracting resources because sovereignty at its core amounts to a right for States to conduct any functions they see fit, as long as no violations of international law occur. Thirdly, States are not obliged <b>to</b> <b>cooperate</b> for the sake of resource management, since <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> <b>cooperate</b> under customary law and treaty law do not stretch that far. And lastly, general international law is the channel for finding solutions in order to prevent tragedy to outer space as a resource domain, but at the present, there are no norms that can cope with the fears expressed in the discourse on the commons...|$|R

50|$|Following {{the end of}} Gilded Leopard {{study in}} 1967, the West-German {{government}} decided {{to focus on the}} Experimentalentwicklung (experimental development) as feasibility study and to develop new components for upgrading the Leopard 1 and for use on a future main battle tank program. At first 25 million DM were invested, but after the industry {{came to the conclusion that}} with such a low budget the development of the two projected testbeds was not possible, a total of 30 to 32 million DM was invested. The experimental development was contracted to the company Krauss-Maffei, but with the <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> <b>cooperate</b> with Porsche for the development of the chassis and with Wegmann for the development of the turret. Two prototypes with differing components were built with the aim to improve the conception of the Leopard 1 in such a way that it would match the firepower requirements of the MBT-70. A high first-hit probability at ranges of 2000 m and the ability to accurately engage targets on the move thanks to a computerized fire control system were the main goals of the experimental development. The resulting vehicles were nicknamed Keiler (tusker). Two prototypes (ET 01 and ET 02) of the Keiler were built in 1969 and 1970, both of them being powered by the MB 872 engine.|$|E
40|$|The Telecommunications Act of 1996 {{requires}} all incumbent {{local telephone}} companies to provide local entrants {{with access to}} various facilities and services of incumbents' local networks. In the case of Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs) providing such cooperation is a pre-requisite for being allowed to offer long-distance services; GTE, however may offer long-distance services unconditionally, hence its incentives <b>to</b> <b>cooperate</b> should be weaker. Using an originally assembled data set, this paper compares the negotiations of AT&T, as a local entrant, with GTE and with the particular RBOC in various GTE states. The results suggest that differential incentives matter: {{despite the fact that}} regulatory <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> <b>cooperate</b> apply <b>to</b> both GTE and the RBOCs, GTE is significantly less cooperative. Specifically, GTE litigates prematurely far more often, and negotiations with it take about seventy percent longer. Moreover, controlling for cost differences, GTE demands more favorable pricing from entrants for access to its networks. Tougher GTE demands are associated with better arbitration awards to both GTE and the RBOC in that state (perhaps because a state commission is reluctant to treat the incumbent carriers in its state very differently). Preliminary evidence from an FCC survey suggests that, consistent with GTE's greater resistance, there is less entry into GTE's territories. Telecommunications, Local Competition, Arbitration...|$|R

40|$|In the United States, the {{exercise}} of police authority—and the public’s trust that police authority is used properly—is a recurring concern.

In this book, Robert E. Worden and Sarah J. McLean argue that the procedural justice model of reform is a mirage.

But {{a closer look at}} police organizations and police-citizen interactions shows that the relief offered by such reform is, in fact, illusory.

50|$|The {{guilty plea}} by John Dean (with <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> <b>cooperate)</b> that morning {{represented}} {{the most significant}} step {{so far in the}} prosecutions. Yet, when Cox returned to the office it remained quiet—Wright had neither called nor responded in writing. When the courts closed there was still no sign that the president had filed a notice to appeal to the Supreme Court. At 5:23 p.m. a letter from Wright arrived, which simply again maintained the reasonableness of the original proposal. Wright closed with a statement of regret that Cox would not agree. Cox now realized that he and Richardson had been allowed to negotiate even though the president had no intention to go beyond the inadequate first proposal. On this conclusion, the lawyers in the office began copying their most important memos for safe keeping. At 7:20 Richardson phoned Cox at home and read him a letter he just received from Wright informing him the Stennis plan had been agreed to by the leadership of the Senate Watergate Committee and that Cox would be instructed to not pursue any further presidential material. A statement was to be released that night. Cox and Doyle hurried back to the office. When they obtained the statement they saw it as an attempt to sell the unilateral proposal; it claimed that the plan had the approval of Senators Sam Ervin and Howard Baker, who, the statement falsely said, were the ones who proposed Senator Stennis. Although Cox had refused to agree, Nixon planned to take the proposal to Sirica and instructed his lawyers not to seek Supreme Court review. Given that the statement was riddled with falsehoods, Cox that night dictated a press release to Doyle (the staff had gone off for the three-day weekend), and Doyle phoned it in to the wire services, also announcing there would be a press conference on Saturday, at 1:00 p.m.|$|E

For employer, {{there are two types of}} implied <b>obligation,</b> duty <b>to</b> <b>cooperate</b> which also known as positive implied obligation and another one is the duty not to interfere or prevent which also known as negative implied obligation.

This implication will need to follow certain principle before it can be imposed as the extent of employer’s implied obligation. Therefore this research is carried out to identify the extent of the employer’s implied obligation in the construction contract.

40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} States’ ‘vertical’ {{cooperation}} with the ad hoc Tribunals and the ICC {{in the specific context}} of witness’ protection, by highlighting some problematic issues concerning the respect of the ‘due process’ principle in the State required of judicial assistance. The focus is specifically on the protection system granted to witnesses before international criminal Tribunals with respect to both procedural and extra-procedural protective measures. Indeed, both type of measures are hardly achievable without an extensive cooperation by the State required of the assistance. However, State’s <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> <b>cooperate</b> with international Tribunals could to some extent interfere with the ‘due process’ principle as set out in the national legal order of the State required of the assistance. This is the case, for example, with respect to ‘protected’ testimonies obtained abroad such as a testimony acquired by the video conference technique in the State where the witness resides. Rules relating to the implementation in Italy of the <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> <b>cooperate</b> with the international criminal Tribunals usually require the compliance with the specific terms of the assistance without any possibility of invoking grounds of refusal other than those eventually established in the international Tribunals’ Statutes. On the other hand, the contradiction between the protection measure decided by an international criminal Tribunal and the so-called ‘higher level of protection’ possibly recognized by the requested State legal system is only apparent: the ‘higher level of protection’ standard does not seem to come into play in the context of ‘vertical’ judicial cooperation. However, compatibility issues between international obligations in the field of vertical cooperation and the due process principle in Italy are not excluded...|$|E

This theory assumes that trust in procedural justice and in the effectiveness of the police are important issues in shaping citizens’ perceptions of police legitimacy. Additionally, perceived legitimacy is necessary for the recognition of police authority. When citizens recognize the right of the police to exercise authority, they are assumed <b>to</b> feel an <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> obey the police, and ultimately they will have a greater tendency <b>to</b> <b>cooperate</b> with them.
