500|$|In {{conversation}} with Woods, Biko {{insisted that the}} BCM would not degenerate into anti-white racism [...] "because it isn't a negative, hating thing.

He acknowledged that a [...] "fringe element" [...] may retain [...] "anti-white bitterness"; he added: [...] "we'll {{do what we can}} to restrain that, but frankly it's not one of <b>our</b> <b>top</b> priorities or one of our major concerns.

[...] Elsewhere, Biko argued that it was the responsibility of a vanguard movement to ensure that, in a post-apartheid society, the black majority would not seek vengeance upon the white minority. He stated that this would require an education of the black population in order to teach them how to live in a non-racial society.|$|E

We have therefore sent Tintin, one of <b>our</b> <b>top</b> reporters, to Soviet Russia." [...] The illusion of Tintin as a real reporter for the paper, and not a fictional character, was emphasised by the claim that the comic strip was not a series of drawings, but composed of photographs taken of Tintin's adventure. Biographer Benoît Peeters thought this a private joke between staff at alluding to the fact that Hergé had originally been employed as a reporter-photographer, a job that he never fulfilled. Literary critic Tom McCarthy later compared this approach to that of 18th-century European literature, which often presented fictional narratives as non-fiction.|$|E
