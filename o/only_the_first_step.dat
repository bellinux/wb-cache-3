The TV series does not reveal whether these {{celestial}} bodies are within one star system, only saying that Serenitys mode of propulsion is a [...] "gravity-drive". The film Serenity makes clear that all the planets and moons are in one large system, and production documents related to the film indicate that there is no faster-than-light travel in this universe. The characters occasionally refer to [...] "Earth-that-was", and the film establishes that, long before the events in the series, a large population had emigrated from Earth to a new star system in generation ships: [...] "Earth-that-was could no longer sustain our numbers, we were so many". The emigrants established themselves in this new star system, with [...] "dozens of planets and hundreds of moons". Many of these were terraformed, a process in which a planet or moon is altered to resemble Earth. The terraforming process was <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> in making a planet habitable, however, and the outlying settlements often did not receive any further support in the construction of their civilizations. This resulted in many of the border planets and moons having forbidding, dry environments, well-suited to the Western genre.|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, Heffron, who {{supported}} a general policy of decentralising tertiary education across the state, directed his Department {{to begin the}} establishment of various Teachers' Colleges in New South Wales, to provide sufficient tertiary training to the expanding numbers of teachers filling the new schools and colleges across the state. Among them was the Newcastle Teachers' College, established in 1949 and opened in 1950, which facilitated growing calls {{from the city of}} Newcastle for a more permanent University in the city. In May 1951, Heffron indicated his support {{for the establishment of a}} satellite college of Sydney University in Newcastle as an initial step towards the establishment of a full university. By July Heffron sought to approach Sydney University officials to facilitate efforts [...] "to have a university established in Newcastle as soon as possible", and noted that his moves to purchase land in the city as the site of this college was an indication of the government's intentions: [...] "I didn't buy that site in Newcastle just for fun. I want to provide a university in Newcastle and I want that to be <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> in providing universities all over the state". However, by the time Heffron opened the Newcastle University College (NUC) on 3 December 1951, no affiliation had been finalised. By May 1952, a University Establishment Group had gained much momentum but Heffron had been notified by Premier Joseph Cahill that there were insufficient funds available for the establishment of another full university. Nevertheless, in early 1954 this college had become a college of the New South Wales University of Technology. As premier, in late 1961 Heffron moved with his Minister for Education, Ernest Wetherell, that the Newcastle University College would become a full university [...] "come what may". This was achieved when on 12 March 1962, the University of Technology Vice-Chancellor Philip Baxter notified the NUC Warden, Professor James Auchmuty, that it would be allowed to take on full autonomy to become the University of Newcastle from 1 January 1965.|$|E

It contained [...] "the most profligate and impious productions of Voltaire, Diderot, Boulanger, La Mettrie, and of other Deists or Atheists of the age, and this under the specious pretence of enlightening ignorance".

2500|$|Following World War II, the United Nations (UN) {{extended}} feminism's global reach. They {{established a}} Commission on the Status of Women in 1946., which later joined the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). In 1948, the UN issued its Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which protects [...] "the equal rights {{of men and}} women", and addressed both equality and equity. Starting with the 1975 World Conference of the International Women's Year in Mexico City {{as part of their}} Decade for Women (1975–85), the UN has held a series of world conferences on women's issues. These conferences have worldwide female representation and provide considerable opportunity to advance women's rights. They also illustrate deep cultural divisions and disagreement on universal principles, as evidenced by the successive Copenhagen (1980) and Nairobi (1985) conferences. Examples of such intrafeminism divisions have included disparities between economic development, attitudes towards forms of oppression, the definition of feminism, and stances on homosexuality, female circumcision, and population control. The Nairobi convention revealed a less monolithic feminism that [...] "constitutes the political expression of the concerns and interests of women from different regions, classes, nationalities, and ethnic backgrounds. There is and must be a diversity of feminisms, responsive to the different needs and concerns of women, and defined by them for themselves. This diversity builds on a common opposition to gender oppression and hierarchy which, however, is <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> in articulating and acting upon a political agenda." [...] The fourth conference was held in Beijing in 1995, where the Beijing Platform for Action was signed.
