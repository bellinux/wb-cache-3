30|$|The {{forests in}} {{southern}} Hessen {{in the vicinity}} of the Rhine-Main urban agglomeration are among the most problematic forest areas for forest management in Central Europe. Here extraordinary demands are made on forests and forest enterprises in view of the high population density, highly concentrated industrialization and dense road and traffic infrastructure. Urban agglomeration has led to the acquisition of considerable land area for development, which, in turn, has led to an unusually high fragmentation of the forest area. Furthermore environmental impacts, including an increase in emissions of air pollutants and the serious lowering of the groundwater table arising from high water usage, are evident. Forestry management options are severely restricted in this region due to the exceptional importance of forests, particularly old oak forests, for recreation and nature conservation (NW-FVA, Nordwestdeutsche Forstliche Versuchsanstalt Hrsg. [2013]): p. 32  ff.). The abiotic pressures and especially the wide-spread drop in groundwater levels have already degraded many forests. Additionally, the massive outbreaks of biotic pests like the forest cockchafer (Melolontha hippocastani), the European <b>oak</b> leafroller (<b>Tortrix</b> viridana) and the gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) have in part led to a total destruction of forests in some areas. It is anticipated that site conditions will degrade further in the future if the groundwater depletion intensifies and if climate change leads to higher temperatures and lower precipitation as projected (NW-FVA, Nordwestdeutsche Forstliche Versuchsanstalt Hrsg. [2013]): p. 40  ff.). Already the Rhine-Main region is one of driest and warmest regions in Hessen.|$|R
40|$|Recently out-breaks of {{the green}} <b>oak</b> leaf roller <b>Tortrix</b> viridana L. (Lepidoptera, Tortricidae) were {{recorded}} in Natural Reserve in Sicily (Italy) where treatments are generally forbidden. The commercial, social and environmental value of the wood in the forest needs to be preserved and biological control could be applied in particular case. To optimise the permitted biological treatment, {{not only in terms}} of product amount but also for the time of application baseline susceptibility of T. viridiana from the Natural Reserve of Ficuzza (Palermo, Italy) to a commercial formulation of Bacillus thuringiensis was determined for neonates and 2, 5, 10 and 15 day old larvae. The differences in susceptibility of the different larval development were recorded. For neonates the calculated DL 50 was 0. 63 μg/ml, while after five days it was 10. 01 μg/ml. The same doses had little effect on the older larvae, showing a clear decrease in susceptibility with age and larval growth. A relationship was also found between susceptibility and body length. The implications of these data in controlling this pest in the natural reserve are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{evaluate}} historical human impact on the expansion of European oak stands in the past through scientific publications and to find existing limitations that affect the oak recovery ability. The European historical forest is characterized by coppicing, of which origins {{date back to the}} Neolithic period. The coppice featured vegetative renewal, in the coppice with standards there were left standards of the generative origin, often oaks. Both forms have a very long tradition in European countries. People used the sprouting capacity and the quick regeneration of oak especially for construction purposes and their need for firewood. Acorns secured the source of food for pig farming. Based on for example the ring width or pollen analysis, current methods of research permit {{to assess the impact of}} active management on the oak stands and outline the structure of primeval forests. It turned out that coppicing has a positive effect on the increment of oak standards and that the open landscape with a rich diversity of species, which features a picture of a primeval forest, was always maintained especially by a man starting forest fires. Since the mid- 20 th century, it was gradually transferred to the high shape of the wood, which favors generative way to recovery, and thus monocultures of often coniferous trees are created. Oak is currently health endangered tree species and its recovery is negatively affected by grazing deer (browsing), the influence of abrupt climate change, weed, pathogenic fungi of the genus Phytophthora, oak powdery mildew (Microsphaera alphitoides), tracheomycotic diseases or larvae of winter moth (Operophtera Brumata) and green <b>oak</b> moth (<b>Tortrix</b> viridana). Finally, it is inappropriately selected management that is not based on the rich history of this species and doesn´t preserve its characteristic natural properties...|$|R

40|$|Although most ecologists {{agree that}} both {{top-down}} and bottom-up forces (predation and resource limitation, respectively) act in concert to influence populations of herbivores, it has proven difficult {{to estimate the}} relative contributions of such forces in terrestrial systems. Using a combination of time–series analysis of population counts recorded over 16 years and experimental data, we present the first estimates of the relative roles of top-down and bottom-up forces on the population dynamics of two terrestrial insect herbivores on the English oak (Quercus robur). Data suggest that temporal variation in winter moth, Operophtera brumata, density is dominated by time-lagged effects of pupal predators. By comparison, spatial variation in O. brumata density is dominated by host–plant quality. Overall, top-down forces explain 34. 2 % of population variance, bottom-up forces explain 17. 2 % of population variance, and 48. 6 % remains unexplained. In contrast, populations of the green <b>oak</b> <b>tortrix,</b> Tortrix viridana, appear dominated by bottom-up forces. Resource limitation, expressed as intraspecific competition among larvae for oak leaves, explains 29. 4 % of population variance. Host quality effects explain an additional 5. 7 % of population variance. We detected no major top-down effects on T. viridana populations. An unknown factor causing a linear decline in T. viridana populations over the 16 -year study period accounts {{for most of the}} remaining unexplained variance. We discuss the observed differences between the insect species and the utility of time–series analysis as a tool in assessing the relative importance of top-down and bottom-up forces on herbivore populations...|$|E
40|$|The green <b>oak</b> leaf roller, <b>Tortrix</b> viridana L., {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{destructive}} pests, causing damages to various species of oak, feeding on different host plants including Quercus infectoria Oliv, Q. branti Lindl, and Q. libani Oliv. Nutritional indices, activity of enzymatic and non-enzymatic compounds of T. viridana were studied under laboratory conditions. In addition, chemical components were analysed in the leaves of the three host plants. Fourth instar larvae reared on Q. branti showed the highest values of relative consumption rate (RCR), approximate digestibility, and consumption index (48. 73 ± 6. 22; 90. 45 ± 1. 06 and 97. 45 ± 12. 44 respectively), while the lowest values were observed on Q. libani. Efficiency of conversion of ingested food in the fourth instar larvae was the highest (3. 17 ± 0. 661) on Q. libani and the lowest (1. 53 ± 0. 164) on Q. branti. The fifth instar larvae fed on Q. libani had the highest RCR (15. 64 ± 2. 51). The highest amounts of triglycerides, uric acid, glucose, protein and the lowest activity of alkaline phosphatase were observed in the fifth instar larvae reared on Q. libani. The leaves of Q. libani highlighted the highest amounts of total nitrogen, total protein, water, potassium, magnesium and total carbohydrate. The present research suggested that the nutritional quality of the host plants have crucial effects on T. viridana larvae...|$|R
40|$|International audienceFood chains {{culminating}} with temperate insectivorous passerines {{are well}} described, yet whether trophic webs can be site-specific remains a largely unexplored question. In {{the case of}} site- or habitat-specificity of food webs, stable isotope signatures of bird feathers may enable assignment of unmarked individuals to a site or a habitat of origin. We address this question in landscapes that include contrasting forest habitat patches with either deciduous Downy Oak Quercus humilis or evergreen Holm Oak Quercus ilex as dominant tree species. First, we examine the spatial variation across habitats and sites in the stable isotope ratios of carbon (d 13 C) and nitrogen (d 15 N) along the <b>oak</b> leaf-Tortrix moth <b>Tortrix</b> viridana caterpillar-Blue Tit Cyanistes caeruleus food chain. Secondly, we assess whether the isotopic signatures allow for correct assignment of individual birds to their site or habitat of origin. At {{the scale of the}} landscape, stable isotope values enabled identification of the different components of the Blue Tit food chain: from oak leaves to Blue Tit nestlings and yearling birds. However, isotopic signatures were site-specific (i. e. geographical) more than habitat-specific (i. e. deciduous vs. evergreen oaks). Discriminant analyses correctly assigned 85 % of nestlings and 83 % of resident yearling birds, indicating a pronounced effect of site on Blue Tit feather isotopic signatures. We thereby demonstrate that isotopes reflect a stronger association of locally born birds to the local features of their habitat than that of un-ringed yearling birds, whose plumage may have grown while in a wider geographical area. This study provides evidence of site-specific isotopic signatures from oak leaves to Blue Tit feathers at a fine spatial scale...|$|R
40|$|The Green <b>oak</b> {{leaf roller}} <b>Tortrix</b> viridana {{is one of}} the most harmful pest of the Palearctic oaks. The young larvae of T. viridana develop inside the {{flushing}} buds and their egg hatch is synchronized with the bud burst of the oaks. The aim of the study was to investigate the genetic structure and variation of mitochondrial and nuclear loci in Sardinian populations associated with deciduous (Quercus pubescens) and evergreen (Q. suber and Q. ilex) oaks. We performed multilocus analyses (COI, COII mitochondrial genes and eight microsatellites) in about two hundreds individuals collected on all the three oak species coming from the most important forest districts in Sardinia Island, Italy. The populations were also characterized by egg hatching, after comparison in semi-field tests for egg development. Eighty-five mitochondrial haplotypes were found, with three ones shared among all populations, except the most southern one. A high haplotype diversity (H = 0. 90) and a low nucleotide diversity (? = 0. 003) have been observed. Microsatellites were highly variable with alleles ranging from 4 to 56 for locus and polymorfic information content values varying from 0. 510 to 0. 945. AMOVA tests were performed by structuring samples in different groups (geographic districts/oak species/egg development). The highest values of Fixation indexes resulted grouping populations according to early or late egg hatching. Furthermore, we tested for sex-biased dispersal, estimating pairwise FST, FIS, and relatedness r at nuclear loci separately for the sexes. We produced evidence for non random patterns of gene flow probably mediated by male biased dispersal, with values significantly higher in females than in males and females the phylopatric sex. In support of a male biased dispersal, nuclear and mitochondrial markers provided different results in the matter of genetic structure, with mitochondrial loci, unlike microsatellites, highlighting significant differentiation levels among populations...|$|R
40|$|In Western Europe {{pedunculate oak}} (Quercus robur L.) is the forest tree {{with the highest}} number of {{phytophagous}} insect species (Yela & Lawton 1997). One of these, the green <b>oak</b> leaf roller <b>Tortrix</b> viridana L. is an oligophagous herbivorous moth with a host range limited to the genus Quercus (Hunter 1990, Du Merle 1999). During outbreaks, T. viridana often leads to defoliation of oaks in spring. The abundance of T. viridana is subject to the population size fluctuations typical for herbivorous insects, where periods of small population sizes (latent periods) alternate with periods of high population sizes (outbreak) (e. g. Schütte 1957, Horstmann 1984). Apart from many experimental studies on population dynamics of the moth (e. g. Hunter 1990, Du Merle 1999, Ivashov & al. 2002) so far little {{attention has been paid to}} the genetic variation within the species as an important aspect of the genetics of this host-parasite interaction. Simchuk & al. (1999) found changes in the heterozygosity level of different isozyme loci during outbreaks in T. viridana and molecular markers for T. viridana have been developed for analyses of genetic variation within and among populations (Schroeder & Scholz 2005). But, investigations of genetic variation within and among populations of forest pest species are important to predict future pest outbreaks. So far the processes outbreaks based on are not entirely clarified, however it is known that migration plays a major role. Using molecular markers investigations of the genetic variation are possible and offer the opportunity to analyse distribution events. In this paper first results are presented concerning the genetic variation of the green oak leaf roller at three geographic scales: (1) among trees within a population, (2) among populations at a small spatial scale of about 150 km and (3) among populations at a broader geographic scale up to 3000 km. Furthermore results of the genetic variation of oaks at the small spatial scale are represented. Populationen des grünen Eichenwicklers (Tortrix viridana L., Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) und der Stieleiche (Quercus robur L., Fagaceae) wurden auf genetische Differenzierungen mit Hilfe von Kern-DNA-Markern untersucht. Insgesamt wurden 14 Eichenbestände in Nordrhein-Westfalen (NRW) und 7 weitere in verschiedenen Regionen Europas in die Untersuchung einbezogen. Weder für die Eiche noch für den Eichenwickler sind genetische Differenzierungen der Populationen auf einer kleinen geographischen Skala (etwa 150 km) nachweisbar, jedoch zeigen die Eichenpopulationen eine zunehmende genetische Distanz mit zunehmender geographischer Distanz. Für den Eichenwickler konnten innerhalb von Populationen in einem Radius von etwa 40 m Familienstrukturen ermittelt werden und auf einer kontinentalen Skala lassen sich die Ergebnisse für den Eichenwickler mit einer „isolation by distance“ erklären...|$|R
