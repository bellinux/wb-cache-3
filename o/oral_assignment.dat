Nave solutions such as mailing lists and <b>oral</b> <b>assignment</b> {{turns out to be}} quite ineffective and a rather centralised approach of team communication is demanded. Such system should also serve as information storage of project and task states, so that any work participant will have access to all information he needs for his work.

The application will provide means to monitor progress of work on projects and monitor and manage allocation of human resources along with their results and effectivity. Emphasis is put on correct architecture, high maintainability and extensibility, and using best practices during the implementation of the project.

40|$|Speaking English is an {{important}} skill in language learning. The learners communicate through oral expression to gain much information effectively and efficiently. The teacher {{should be aware of}} the learners’ speaking ability because it significantly influences the other learners’ success in language learning. The ability to speak a foreign language becomes the most highly prized language skill. Many language learners regard speaking skill as the measure of knowing a language. 	This research was meant to investigate the teaching of English speaking skill at “First Course”: a boarding course in Bangkalan. This research is a descriptive case study of First Course. The subject of this research is two instructors who teach the book two level at First Course. The major research question of this study is: how is the process of the teaching of English speaking skill at First Course which is broken down into two sub research questions: 1) How is the preparation of the teaching of English speaking skill at First Course? 2) How is the implementation of the preparation on the teaching of English speaking skill at First Course? 	The data of this research was the information that researcher collected from the result of interview with two instructors and classroom observation. The researcher collected the data by using interview guide, observation sheet, and fieldnote. The information was in the form of the interview transcript and classroom observation (field note). The analysis of the research data resulted in several findings: 	Firstly, the result of interview concerning the preparation of the teaching of English speaking skill: (1) The instructors did not use lesson plan in written form. Yet, the instructors kept the unwritten plan in their mind. (2) Material and media prepared by the instructors were soft copy, hard copy and coursebook (English 900 by Collier Macmillan). Then, the media used for teaching speaking were pictures, cards, dictionary, microphone, and internet. (3) The teaching techniques used to deliver the materials in teaching speaking were storytelling, question and answer, discussion, describing, debating, and interviewing. (4) The form of assessment and evaluation provided by instructors was an oral test through storytelling, question and answer and interview. (5) The form of assignment provided by the instructors was an <b>oral</b> <b>assignment</b> at the end of the class. Secondly, the result of observations concerning the implementation of the preparation on the teaching of English speaking skill: (1) The instructors did not used lesson plan in written form. Yet, they kept the unwritten plan in their mind. To reflect that they made a preparation in their mind, they presented the teaching-learning activities consistently. Their teaching contains three major parts: firstly, pre-teaching. The instructors started the lesson by praying together. Then, they greeted the students, gave some motivation, and reviewed the previous lesson. Afterwards, they introduced the new topic. Secondly, whilst-teaching. The instructors invited the students to tell a story, made question and answer, and have an interview. Thirdly, post teaching. They gave an <b>oral</b> <b>assignment</b> to the students at the end of the lesson. Then, they closed the lesson by praying. (2) The material and media prepared by the instructors was a coursebook (English 900 by Collier Macmillan). The media used for teaching was microphone. (3) The teaching techniques used to deliver the materials were storytelling, question and answer, and interview. (4) The form of assessment and evaluation provided by the instructors was an oral test. The instructors asked the students to tell a story, make question and answer, and have an interview. (5) The form of assignment provided by the instructors was an <b>oral</b> <b>assignment.</b> The instructors asked the students to tell a story, make question and answer, and have an interview on the following meeting. The instructors not only taught English speaking to the students but also improved morality, trained and strengthened spirit, appreciated the spiritual/religious values, and taught attitude, politeness, discipline, diligence, honesty, responsibility, democratic, work hard, etc. The instructors had a role in build of students’ characters. The character education which was provided by the instructors were memorized and followed by all the students.

The presenters include Dr. Teresa Clark and Dr. Randy Wilson, who have taught graduate-level classes, in-person and online, that included students from various countries, including China, Egypt, India, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, and United Arab Emirates. Dr. Clark also serves as an advisor to several international students pursuing the Master of Science in Human Development and Leadership. Topics will include 1) gender issues and 2) oral and written communication. The presenters will outline real-life scenarios in which gender issues have arisen, such as advising a female student whose husband accompanies her to appointments, and suggest how attendees could approach such situations for an effective outcome. Also discussed within the frame of gender issues will be one presenter’s experience serving as a female professor/advisor to male international students, and one presenter’s experience as a male professor to female international students. Concerning oral and written communication, the presenters will share challenges their international students have encountered with listening for understanding in the classroom and illustrate strategies that have ameliorated those language barriers. In addition, this session will explore evaluation methods for written and <b>oral</b> <b>assignments</b> from international students for whom English is a second language.

40|$|International audienceThe {{pronunciation}} of {{a foreign}} language is not an intuitive task to accomplish. It needs correct input (Flege, 2009), training and feedback (Kartushina et al. 2015). Becoming aware {{of the differences in}} pronunciation that exist between a learners’ mother tongue (L 1) and a foreign language (L 2) can help learners to improve their pronunciation in the L 2 (Wrembel, 2007). In the following, we present the Progression and Feedback French Learners Audio Corpus of German Speech (ProFee-FLACGS) created between September and December 2015 with a volume of approximately 10 h of speech. Participants are 75 first grade French students majoring in German. All participants took an obligatory class in German pronunciation theory. Although not all participants grew up in a monolingual household, they were all French dominant. The 30 participants were split in two groups: while 15 participants got a classic training, 15 participants got training and some visual input in form of spectrograms. An expected outcome of this experimental setting is a better phonological awareness in the group that got visual input and by this means a quicker or better improvement in German pronunciation. Participants had four obligatory <b>oral</b> <b>assignments</b> to perform across the semester. They recorded themselves and send an audio-file of their production to the teacher. French learners are famous for their /h/ onset omissions in foreign languages like English or German (Kamiyama et al., 2011; Zimmerer & Trouvain, 2015). Omitting /h/ onsets is not the only difficulty French learners of German meet, sometimes they also produce /h/ onsets instead of a glottal stop. For instance in one of the reading tasks, the word group keine Ahnung haben which should be pronounced /kaɪ̯ nəʔaːnuŋhabən/ was uttered as followed by some of the participants: [kaɪ̯nəhaːnuŋhabən] or [kaɪ̯nəhaːnuŋʔabən]. A human expert checks h-initial and V-initial words The Progression and Feedback corpus shows that both the omission of /h/ onsets as well as the replacement of /ʔ/ onsets by /h/ onsets improve over time in both experimental groups.
