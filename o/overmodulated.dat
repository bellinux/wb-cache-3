40|$|Imaging {{studies in}} {{posttraumatic}} stress disorder (PTSD) have shown differing neural network patterns between hypo-aroused/dissociative and hyper-aroused subtypes. Since dissociative identity disorder (DID) involves different emotional states, this study tests whether DID fits aspects of the differing brain-activation patterns in PTSD. While brain activation was monitored using positron emission tomography, DID individuals (n= 11) and matched DID-simulating healthy controls (n= 16) underwent an autobiographic script-driven imagery paradigm in a hypo-aroused and a hyper-aroused identity state. Results were consistent with those previously found in the two PTSD subtypes for the rostral/dorsal anterior cingulate, the prefrontal cortex, and the amygdala and insula, respectively. Furthermore, the dissociative identity state uniquely activated the posterior association areas and the parahippocampal gyri, whereas the hyper-aroused identity state uniquely activated the caudate nucleus. Therefore, we proposed an extended PTSD-based neurobiological model for emotion modulation in DID: the hypo-aroused identity state activates the prefrontal cortex, cingulate, posterior association areas and parahippocampal gyri, thereby <b>overmodulating</b> emotion regulation; the hyper-aroused identity state activates the amygdala and insula {{as well as the}} dorsal striatum, thereby undermodulating emotion regulation. This confirms the notion that DID is related to PTSD as hypo-aroused and hyper-arousal states in DID and PTSD are similar. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Neuromodulators such as monoamines and {{peptides}} play {{important roles}} in activating and reconfiguring neural networks to allow behavioral flexibility. While the net effects of a neuromodulator change the network in a particular direction, careful studies of modulatory effects reveal multiple cases where a neuromodulator will activate functionally opposing mechanisms on a single neuron or synapse. This review gives examples of such opposing actions, focusing on the lobster pyloric network, and discusses their possible functional significance. One important action of opposing modulatory actions may be to stabilize the modulated state of the network, and {{to prevent it from}} being <b>overmodulated</b> and becoming non-functional...|$|E

40|$|The authors’ {{objective}} {{was to develop a}} simple and reliable descriptive method for categorizing patient states during psychotherapy. The categories would be based on the degree of apparent control over emotional expressions. Methods involved scoring videotapes of psychotherapy for 5 patients with neurotic-level Axis I disorders. Three judges rated each 30 -second segment as predominantly one of these four states: well modulated, <b>overmodulated,</b> undermodulated, or shimmering. Shimmering states combine emotional display with efforts to stifle that expression. The results showed that judges could reliably rate states by the definitions used in this study. This technique can provide a simplified and general approach to observation of degrees of defensive control of emotion of patients in psychotherapy...|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} a methodology for obtaining quantitative oxygen concentration {{images in the}} tumor-bearing legs of living C 3 H mice. The method uses high-resolution electron paramag-netic resonance imaging (EPRI). Enabling aspects of the meth-odology {{include the use of}} injectable, narrow, single-line triaryl methyl spin probes and an accurate model of <b>overmodulated</b> spectra. Both of these increase the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), resulting in high resolution in space (1 mm) 3 and oxygen con-centrations (3 torr). Thresholding at 15 % the maximum spec-tral amplitude gives leg/tumor shapes that reproduce those in photographs. The EPRI appears to give reasonable oxygen par-tial pressures, showing hypoxia (0 – 6 torr, 0 – 103 Pa) in many of the tumor voxels. EPRI was able to detect statistically signifi-cant changes in oxygen concentrations in the tumor with ad-ministration of carbogen, although the changes were not in-creased uniformly. As a demonstration of the method, EPRI was compared with nearly concurrent (same anesthesia) T * 2 /blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) MRI. There was a good spatial correlation between EPRI and MRI. Homogeneous and hetero-geneous T * 2 /BOLD MRI correlated well with the quantitative EPRI. This work demonstrates the potential for EPRI to display, at high spatial resolution, quantitative oxygen tension changes in the physiologic response to environmental changes. Mag...|$|E
40|$|Inwardly {{rectifying}} potassium channels (Kir channels) {{are important}} for neuronal signalling and membrane excitability. In the present work we characterized, for the first time, Kir channels in rat dopaminergic (DA) periglomerular (PG) cells, interneurons located at the entry of the bulbar circuitry whose role is not yet well defined, using patch-clamp techniques. Whole-cell currents mediated by Kir channels were recorded in DA-PG cells either in thin slices or enzymatically dissociated. They could be distinguished from the hyperpolarization-activated current (Ih) by showing full activation in < 10 ms, no inactivation, and being suppressed by 300 µM Ba 2 + in a typical voltage-dependent manner. The KIR current amplitude is affected by temperature, with a Q 10 of about 1. 7, and its reversal potential is nearly coincident with EK. Its blockage by Ba 2 + entailed a large depolarization (about ?? mV), leading {{to the end of}} any spontaneous activity; in addition, Ba 2 + (200 µM) also induce a 17. 79 ± 3. 23 % increase in input resistance. The depolarization induced by Ba 2 + is sufficient to block the spontaneous activity of DA-PG cells, although the KIR current is not an essential component of the pacemaker machinery, as the injection of a hyperpolarising current under Ba 2 + block restore normal firing. The current is insensitive to tertiapine (100 nM) and is modulated by intracellular concentration of cAMP, as shown by a 14 % decrease induced by forskolin (10 µM, + 0. 1 mM IBMX). We have also tested the neuromodulatory effects of the activation of several metabotropic receptors which are known to be present on these cells, showing that the current is controlled in both directions by a multiplicity of pathways, whose activation in some case increase the amplitude of the current, as muscarinic (oxotremorine, 100 µM), noradrenergic (noradrenaline 100 µM, + 1 mM ascorbic acid) and GABAergic (100 µM) paths, whereas other have the opposite effect, as D 2 agonists (quinpirole, 30 µM), 5 -HT (50 µM) and histamine (10 µM). Interestingly, a parallel study conducted on the h-current in the same preparation has shown an almost specular effect: the current, which has a depolarising effect, is positively modulated by cAMP (forskolin 10 µM and 0. 1 mM IBMX) and negatively by noradrenaline (100 µM + 1 mM ascorbic acid). It can be speculated that, in the main olfactory bulb, a given pathway controlled by neurotransmitters plays important roles in activating and reconfiguring neural networks to allow behavioural flexibility. While the net effects of a neuromodulator change the network in a particular direction, this study reveals cases where a given neuromodulator activate functionally opposing mechanisms on a single neuron. One important benefit of opposing modulatory actions may be to stabilize the modulated state of the network while adding flexibility, and to prevent it from being <b>overmodulated</b> and becoming non-functional...|$|E
