5000|$|Data {{pre-processing}} is {{an important}} step in the mining process. The phrase [...] "garbage in, garbage out" [...] is particularly applicable to data mining and machine learning projects. Data-gathering methods are often loosely controlled, resulting in <b>out-of-range</b> values (e.g., Income: −100), impossible data combinations (e.g., Sex: Male, Pregnant: Yes), missing values, etc. Analyzing data that has not been carefully screened for such problems can produce misleading results.

50|$|Since the {{equations}} defining YCbCr are formed {{in a way}} that rotates the entire nominal RGB color cube and scales it to fit within a (larger) YCbCr color cube, there are some points within the YCbCr color cube that cannot be represented in the corresponding RGB domain (at least not within the nominal RGB range).

50|$|Submarine-launched {{ballistic}} missiles (SLBMs), when deployed aboard ballistic missile submarines, {{are generally not}} vulnerable to an enemy's own weapons and may be kept at delayed launch status without risking their future launch potential.

5000|$|A more {{technical}} approach recognises that a photographic film (or sensor) has a physically limited useful exposure range, sometimes called its dynamic range. If, for {{any part of}} the photograph, the actual exposure is outside this range, the film cannot record it accurately. In a very simple model, for example, <b>out-of-range</b> values would be recorded as [...] "black" [...] (underexposed) or [...] "white" [...] (overexposed) rather than the precisely graduated shades of colour and tone required to describe [...] "detail". Therefore, the purpose of exposure adjustment (and/or lighting adjustment) is to control the physical amount of light from the subject that is allowed to fall on the film, so that 'significant' areas of shadow and highlight detail do not exceed the film's useful exposure range. This ensures that no 'significant' information is lost during capture.|$|E
5000|$|The {{lag time}} {{discussed}} above {{has been reported}} to be about 5 minutes. [...] Anecdotally, some users of the various systems report lag times of up to 10-15 minutes. This lag time is insignificant when blood sugar levels are relatively consistent. However, blood sugar levels, when changing rapidly, may read in the normal range on a CGM system while in reality the patient is already experiencing symptoms of an <b>out-of-range</b> blood glucose value and may require treatment. Patients using CGM are therefore advised to consider both the absolute value of the blood glucose level given by the system as well as any trend in the blood glucose levels. For example, a patient using CGM with a blood glucose of 100 mg/dl on their CGM system might take no action if their blood glucose has been consistent for several readings, while a patient with the same blood glucose level but whose blood glucose has been dropping steeply {{in a short period of}} time might be advised to perform a fingerstick test to check for hypoglycemia.|$|E
