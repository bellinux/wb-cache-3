5|$|Following a {{tradition}} which started with Userkaf, {{the founder of}} the Fifth Dynasty, Menkauhor built a temple to the sun god Ra. He was the last pharaoh to do so. His successors, Djedkare Isesi and Unas, abandoned this practice as the cult of Ra declined at the expense of that of Osiris. Given the paucity of documents relating to Menkauhor's sun temple, it probably functioned for <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>time</b> or was never completed.|$|E
5|$|Although many {{of these}} early schools were open for <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>time,</b> efforts persisted. The Mohawk Institute Residential School, the oldest, {{continuously}} operated residential school in Canada, opened in 1834 on Six Nations of the Grand River near Brantford, Ontario. Administered by the Anglican Church, the facility opened as the Mechanics' Institute, a day school for boys, in 1828 and became a boarding school four years later when it accepted its first boarders and began admitting female students. It remained in operation until June 30, 1970.|$|E

5|$|During his adventure, Headdy {{will find}} power-ups which change {{the design and}} {{function}} of his head. These 17 power-ups range from increasing damage, such as spinning fireballs around his head, to providing invincibility, restoring health, increasing speed, etc. Some of these power-ups last for <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>time.</b> Other than heads, the player can also find health restoratives, extra points, and extra lives throughout the levels. By finding the Liberty Head, players can enter a Bonus Stage in which the player must shoot basketballs into the correct hoops.|$|E
5|$|From {{the onset}} of Italian {{participation}} in the war, Ammiraglio di Saint Bon {{was used as a}} harbor defense ship in Venice, along with her sister and the old battleship Sardegna, as well as two cruisers and several smaller craft. After April 1916, Ammiraglio di Saint Bon was used as a floating anti-aircraft battery to defend Venice. She continued in this role {{until the end of the}} war in November 1918. The ship remained in the Italian Navy's inventory for <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>time</b> after the end of the war; she was stricken from the naval register on 18 June 1920 and subsequently broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|Modi {{spent the}} ensuing two years {{travelling}} across Northern and North-eastern India, though few details {{of where he}} went have emerged. In interviews, Modi has described visiting Hindu ashrams founded by Swami Vivekananda: the Belur Math near Kolkata, followed by the Advaita Ashrama in Almora and the Ramakrishna Mission in Rajkot. Modi remained <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>time</b> at each, since he lacked the required college education. Vivekananda {{has been described as}} a large influence in Modi's life.|$|E

5|$|Once Italy {{entered the}} war, Emanuele Filiberto {{was used as}} a harbor defense ship in Venice to protect the port from Austrian naval attacks.

5|$|The {{cemetery}} {{seems to}} have been laid out on a single occasion and used for <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>time</b> afterwards. It is thought that the mourners would have entered through the south side and assembled in the empty south-western area of the cemetery before proceeding to the shrine to carry out the burial rites. After interring the deceased in a grave they may have used the eastern entrance to leave the cemetery. Alternatively, different groups of people may have used the two entrances, perhaps reflecting {{the fact that some of}} the graves do not fit into the overall square plan and may therefore belong to a different group.|$|E
5|$|Zacharias {{spent the}} summer of 1971 in Vietnam, where he evangelized to the American soldiers, as well as imprisoned Viet Cong.

In 1974 the C sent him to Cambodia, where he preached <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>time</b> before its fall to the Khmer Rouge. In 1977, after graduating from Trinity, Zacharias was commissioned by the C to preach worldwide.|$|E

5|$|However, del Valle did {{not live}} on this land initially, instead {{residing}} in the Olvera Street area of Los Angeles, where he was active in local politics. In the 1840s, he served on the junta (the equivalent of a city council) as a member and its secretary, as well as treasurer of civil government under Governor Pío Pico. In 1850, he was elected alcalde of Los Angeles and served <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>time</b> before the city was incorporated as an American city, but during his tenure he established the Los Angeles Rangers, an early law enforcement group. After California achieved statehood later that year, del Valle served in the California State Assembly for a short period.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{upon his}} arrival in Germany, Accum went {{to the town of}} Althaldensleben. There, the {{industrialist}} Johann Gottlob Nathusius had acquired various estates and was using them to found a sprawling industrial settlement. Nathusius was a German pioneer in the field of sugar production from beets, and had established a factory for its production in that town between 1813 and 1816. It was probably Nathusius’ extensive library and chemical laboratory that drew Accum. He remained <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>time</b> in Althaldensleben, however, as he soon got a professorship at the Gewerbeinstitut and the Bauakademie in Berlin. His teaching in the areas of physics, chemistry, and mineralogy, were collected in the two volume work, Physische und chemische Beschaffenheit der Baumaterialien, deren Wahl, Verhalten und zweckmässige Anwendung, published in Berlin in 1826. It was the only work Accum published originally in German.|$|E
5|$|The NK 9th Division's {{infantry}} {{crossing of}} the Naktong and attack on its east side near midnight quickly overran the positions of C Company, north of A Company. There the North Koreans assaulted in force, signaled by green flares and blowing of whistles. The company held its positions <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>time</b> and then attempted to escape. Many of the men moved south, {{a few of them}} coming into A Company's ridge line positions near Agok during the night. Most of C Company moved {{all the way to the}} 25th Division positions south of the Naktong. On September 1 that division reported that 110 men of C Company had come into its lines.|$|E

5|$|These two localities are {{unusual in}} having cliff-top dunes of {{siliceous}} sand: cliff-top dunes are an unusual topographic formation, {{and nearly all}} soil in the area is calcareous. As Banksia species are intolerant of calcareous soils, and are not adapted to long range seed dispersal, the two populations of B.epica appear to be reproductively isolated. Nelson has suggested that {{there was once a}} continuous strip of siliceous sand along the coast, providing an extensive and unfragmented habitat for B.epica; rises in the sea level had submerged this strip, leaving only the cliff-top dunes as suitable habitat. The fact that the resultant isolated populations have not perceptibly speciated since then suggests that the species has been fragmented for <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>time,</b> perhaps only since the Last Glacial Maximum.|$|E
5|$|Because xenon is a tracer for two parent isotopes, xenon isotope ratios in meteorites are a {{powerful}} tool for studying the formation of the Solar System. The iodine–xenon method of dating gives the time elapsed between nucleosynthesis and the condensation of a solid object from the solar nebula. In 1960, physicist John H. Reynolds discovered that certain meteorites contained an isotopic anomaly {{in the form of an}} overabundance of xenon-129. He inferred that this was a decay product of radioactive iodine-129. This isotope is produced slowly by cosmic ray spallation and nuclear fission, but is produced in quantity only in supernova explosions. Because the half-life of 129I is comparatively short on a cosmological time scale (16 million years), this demonstrated that <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>time</b> had passed between the supernova and the time the meteorites had solidified and trapped the 129I. These two events (supernova and solidification of gas cloud) were inferred to have happened during the early history of the Solar System, because the 129I isotope was likely generated shortly before the Solar System was formed, seeding the solar gas cloud with isotopes from a second source. This supernova source may also have caused collapse of the solar gas cloud.|$|E
5|$|In mid-September Bostock {{gained the}} {{agreement}} of Kenney's headquarters to deploy No.80 Wing to the recently captured island of Morotai in the NEI {{as part of a}} redeployment of RAAF units in the SWPA. While this raised morale within No.80 Wing, it had <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>time</b> to prepare to move overseas. On 8November Caldwell received orders to begin the movement to Morotai as soon as possible, and he visited the island late that month. During this visit he observed that it was likely that supply shortages would impede the wing's operations. No.80 Wing's headquarters left Darwin on 9December and No.452 Squadron departed on 15December. During the squadron's trip to Morotai three Spitfires were destroyed or damaged as a result of landing accidents at Merauke, New Guinea on 15December. As expected, living facilities at Morotai were initially very basic, and Caldwell traded liquor for the services of US engineer units to improve the wing's camp site.|$|E
