Sometimes they put one on my thumb and another <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>tongue,</b> neck or ear. It had a hand crank to make it go. They had two kinds of machines, one with a crank and one with buttons."" ...|$|E
60|$|My {{attention}} was so {{attracted by the}} singularity of his fixed look at me, that the words died away <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>tongue.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Life {{laughed and}} moved on unsubdued, I saw that Old succumbed to Young: 'Twas well. My too regretful mood [...] Died <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>tongue.</b>|$|E
60|$|The five {{rose and}} bowed with marked profundity. One of them, with a puffy, weak, good-natured face, {{answered}} her briskly, {{and after a}} little raillery {{she came back to}} me. I had a question not over discreet <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>tongue's</b> tip.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wait a bit. It was <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>tongue's</b> end {{to propose}} somethin' {{of the same}} kind; but we can't afford to take the chances of makin' a move till yonder nest of snakes has settled down for the night. An hour from now, an' we'll all pull out." ...|$|R
60|$|It was <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>tongue's</b> end to {{say that}} we could not hope for the same good fortune during another night of racing through the forest when it was too dark to {{distinguish}} anything not directly in our path; but I checked myself in time, for no good could come of speaking dispiriting words while we were in such a desperate situation.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{asked me}} for the truth, Marie, and it was right that I should tell it you; it was <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>tongue</b> {{to say the same}} to Henri, before you appealed to me at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|Were I now as I was, I had sung [...] What Lawrence has painted so well;[607] [...] But {{the strain}} would expire <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>tongue,</b> [...] And {{the theme is}} too soft for my shell.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good-bye," [...] she said, {{extending}} her hand. It was gloved. It gave no clasp--it invited none. As I {{could not}} say the words which were <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>tongue,</b> I said nothing, and, raising my cap, I hurried away.|$|E
6000|$|... "It was <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>tongue's</b> end to {{tell him}} that all the fun we'd be likely to have that night would be what we might get out of seeing poor Bobby killed; but I thought we'd soon be having trouble enough without my trying to stir up any more just then, so I said, talking as if it were all I could do to keep from crying: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You can bet it ain't all over! I've been buncoed {{by a lot}} {{of cheap}} firemen, an' don't count <b>on</b> holdin' <b>my</b> <b>tongue.</b> You'll see Jip Collins in jail again before he's a day older." ...|$|R
2500|$|Valentina Siropulo told Human Rights Watch [...] "I confessed during torture with electricity. They put small wires <b>on</b> <b>my</b> {{toes and}} <b>on</b> <b>my</b> thumbs. Sometimes they put one <b>on</b> <b>my</b> thumb and another <b>on</b> either <b>my</b> <b>tongue,</b> neck or ear," [...] "They had {{two kinds of}} machines, one with a crank and one with buttons." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mum's {{the word}} in future, Master Cyril. I will keep the hatches fast down <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>tongue.</b> Now I will push your bed up near the window as the doctor ordered, and then I hope {{you will get a}} good long sleep." ...|$|E
60|$|In half {{a minute}} the kitchen door was softly closed behind us, and we were {{carrying}} Miss Burroughs to the barn. My soul was in a wild tumult. Dozens of questions were <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>tongue,</b> but I had no chance to ask any of them.|$|E
6000|$|... "And since then," [...] said Camilla, in her excited treble, {{straining}} upward {{with wild}} eyes towards Romola's face, [...] "the Blessed Infant {{has come to}} me and laid a wafer of sweetness <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>tongue</b> in token of his pleasure that I had done his will." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we were--after a fashion." [...] He lost {{himself in}} the memory of it. [...] "It was as {{friendly}} as this." [...] I had it <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>tongue's</b> end to ask if that were saying much for it, but I remarked instead that what they had evidently done was to gaze in mutual admiration. Then I inquired whether his recognition of her had been immediate. [...] "Not quite," [...] he replied, [...] "for, of course, I didn't expect her; but it came to me long before she went who she was--who she could only be." ...|$|R
6000|$|The first man-at-arms whom I met I hailed, bidding him lead me {{straight}} to Sir Thomas Grey of Falloden. [...] "What, {{you would take}} service?" [...] he asked, in a Cumberland burr that I knew well, for indeed it came ready enough <b>on</b> <b>my</b> own <b>tongue.</b>|$|R
60|$|I had it <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>tongue's</b> tip to ask {{the captain}} whither he was taking me, yet dared not intrude on the sorrow that still gripped him. Time and time we met people plodding along, some of them nodding uncertainly, others {{abruptly}} taking {{the far side of}} the pike, and every encounter drove the poison deeper into his soul. But after we had travelled some way, up hill and down dale, he vouchsafed the intelligence that we were making for Arbigland, Mr. Craik's seat near Dumfries, which lies on the Nith twenty miles or so up the Solway from Kirkcudbright. On that estate stood the cottage where John Paul was born, and where his mother and sisters still dwelt.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, know ye not," [...] {{said the}} dame, [...] "what {{powerful}} enemies he has at Court? know ye not--But blisters <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>tongue,</b> it runs {{too fast for}} my wit--enough to say, that you had better make your bridal-bed under a falling house, than think of young Glenvarloch." ...|$|E
60|$|It was <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>tongue</b> {{to refute}} this, {{to say that}} {{everybody}} had a chance. I could indeed recall many arguments that had been drilled into me; quotations, even, from court decisions. But something prevented me from doing this,--something in his manner, which was neither argumentative nor combative.|$|E
6000|$|... "Tommy," [...] he said, [...] "I see you haven't changed an atom. You're {{the very}} same serious person that used to lecture me on Sunday mornings when I had a sore head and a fur <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>tongue.</b> You'd want to knock about {{a bit in the}} world. Have you never been {{anywhere}} even for a trip?" ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{should not}} be able to make any one {{understand}} how exciting it all was. You know that kind of quiver that trembles around through you when you are seeing something so strange and enchanting and wonderful that it is just a fearful joy to be alive and look at it; and you know how you gaze, and your lips turn dry and your breath comes short, but you wouldn't be anywhere but there, not for the world. I was bursting to ask one question--I had it <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>tongue's</b> end and could hardly hold it back--but I was ashamed to ask it; it might be a rudeness. Satan set an ox down that he had been making, and smiled up at me and said: ...|$|R
60|$|Here I {{felt that}} my {{professional}} existence depended <b>on</b> not holding <b>my</b> <b>tongue.</b> To be held up before my mistress, {{in my old}} age, {{as a sort of}} deputy-policeman, was, once again, more than my Christianity was strong enough to bear.|$|R
60|$|Now {{and then}} I got away {{and changed the}} scene for a short time, always asking leave of my lord and master first, and {{generally}} getting it. He was not, as I have already told you, fool enough to drive me too hard, and he could reasonably rely <b>on</b> <b>my</b> holding <b>my</b> <b>tongue</b> for <b>my</b> own sake, if not for his. One of my longest trips away from home was the trip I took to Limmeridge to nurse a half-sister there, who was dying. She {{was reported to have}} saved money, and I thought it as well (in case any accident happened to stop my allowance) to look after my own interests in that direction. As things turned out, however, my pains were all thrown away, and I got nothing, because nothing was to be had.|$|R
6000|$|Like music {{heard in}} dreams, [...] Like strains of harps unknown, [...] Of birds forever flown [...] Audible {{as the voice}} of streams [...] That murmur in some leafy dell, [...] I hear thy gentlest tone, [...] And Silence cometh with her spell [...] Like that which <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>tongue</b> doth dwell, [...] When tremulous in dreams I tell [...] My love to thee alone! ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{went to my}} wife's room, after I {{reached the}} house, and faced her with {{considerable}} trepidation. I had to begin rather far off, but I certainly began {{in a way to}} lead up to the fact. [...] "Isabel," [...] I said, [...] "Tedham is out at last." [...] I had it <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>tongue</b> to say poor Tedham, but I suppressed the qualification in actual speech as likely to prove unavailing, or worse.|$|E
60|$|At four I woke, as I always did, and {{proceeded}} {{to take one of}} my powders. Curiously enough, before I tasted it, the grain appeared to me to be rather coarser and more granular than the quinine I had originally put there. I took a pinch between my finger and thumb, and placed it <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>tongue</b> by way of testing it. Instead of being bitter, the powder, I found, was insipid and almost tasteless.|$|E
60|$|In {{the weeks}} and months that {{followed}} I had no more interest in beer than in the kitchen stove after it had burned me. The grown-ups were right. Beer was not for children. The grown-ups didn't mind it; but neither did they mind taking pills and castor oil. As for me, I could manage to get along quite well without beer. Yes, and to the day of my death I could have managed to get along quite well without it. But circumstance decreed otherwise. At every turn in the world in which I lived, John Barleycorn beckoned. There was no escaping him. All paths led to him. And it took twenty years of contact, of exchanging greetings and passing <b>on</b> with <b>my</b> <b>tongue</b> in <b>my</b> cheek, to develop in me a sneaking liking for the rascal.|$|R
6000|$|In youth exalted high in air, Or bathing in {{the waters}} fair, Nature to form me took delight, And clad my body all in white. My person tall, and slender waist, On either side with fringes graced; Till me that tyrant man espied, And dragg'd me from my mother's side: No wonder now I look so thin; The tyrant stript me to the skin: My skin he flay'd, my hair he cropt: At head and foot my body lopt: And then, with heart more hard than stone, He pick'd my marrow from the bone. To vex me more, he took a freak To slit <b>my</b> <b>tongue</b> and make me speak: But, that which {{wonderful}} appears, I speak to eyes, and not to ears. He oft employs me in disguise, And makes me tell a thousand lies: To me he chiefly gives in trust To please his malice or his lust. From me no secret he can hide; I see his vanity and pride: And my delight is to expose His follies to his greatest foes. All languages I can command, Yet not a word I understand. Without my aid, the best divine In learning would not know a line: The lawyer must forget his pleading; The scholar could not show his reading. [...] Nay; man my master is my slave; I give command to kill or save, Can grant ten thousand pounds a-year, And make a beggar's brat a peer. [...] But, while I thus my life relate, I only hasten <b>on</b> <b>my</b> fate. <b>My</b> <b>tongue</b> is black, <b>my</b> mouth is furr'd, I hardly now can force a word. I die unpitied and forgot, And on some dunghill left to rot.|$|R
6000|$|You tell me, to {{preserve}} your wife's good grace, Your eyes must always languish <b>on</b> <b>my</b> face, Your <b>tongue</b> with constant flatteries feed my ear, And tag each sentence with 'My life! My dear!' If, by strange chance, a modest blush be raised, [...] 110 Be sure my fine complexion must be praised. My garments always must be new and gay, And feasts still kept upon my wedding day. Then must my nurse be pleased, and favourite maid: And endless treats and endless visits paid To a long train of kindred, friends, allies: All this thou say'st, and all thou say'st are lies.|$|R
6000|$|ROBERTS. [Bitingly.] If ye {{did not say}} it, man, ye meant it. An' {{what did}} ye say about Chapel? [...] "Chapel's against it," [...] ye said. [...] "She 's against it!" [...] Well, if Chapel and Nature go hand in hand, it's the first I've ever heard of it. That young man there-- [pointing to ROUS]--said I 'ad 'ell fire <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>tongue.</b> If I had I would use it all to scorch and wither this talking of surrender. Surrendering 's the work of cowards and traitors.|$|E
60|$|At {{the mention}} of Samuel I could have sworn to a strange light in her eyes, {{and it seemed to}} me, as by some telepathic flash, that I divined in her a {{tremendous}} wistfulness, an immense yearning. It seemed to me that here was the key to her inscrutableness, the clue that if followed properly would make all her strangeness plain. It came to me that here was a contact and that for the moment I was glimpsing into the soul of her. The question was tickling <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>tongue,</b> but she forestalled me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now I can speak," [...] Captain Dowsett said. [...] "I {{have had}} {{hard work to}} keep a stopper <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>tongue</b> all this time, for I have been well-nigh {{bursting}} to congratulate you. I wish you joy, my lad," [...] and he wrung Cyril's hand heartily, [...] "and a pleasant voyage through life. I am as glad, ay, and a deal more glad than if such a fortune had come in my way, for {{it would have been}} of little use to me, seeing I have all that the heart of man could desire." ...|$|E
60|$|When I {{undertake}} to {{tell the}} best, I find I cannot, <b>My</b> <b>tongue</b> is ineffectual <b>on</b> its pivots, <b>My</b> breath will not be obedient to its organs, I become a dumb man.|$|R
60|$|All {{the whole}} I must admit {{it was not}} a {{situation}} that lent itself to eloquence. I lay <b>on</b> <b>my</b> back and talked through bandages, and with some little difficulty, for <b>my</b> <b>tongue</b> and mouth had swollen. But I was feverish and in pain, and the emotional suspense I had been in so long with regard to her became now an unendurable impatience.|$|R
6000|$|... "No;--I cannot hold <b>my</b> <b>tongue.</b> Have I {{not held}} <b>my</b> <b>tongue</b> ever since you married? And if I am {{to speak at}} all, must I not speak now?" ...|$|R
