She then praises his black hair, again asking to touch it, but is rejected once more. She finally begs for a kiss from Jochanaan's lips, and Narraboth, who cannot bear to hear this, kills himself. As Jochanaan is returned to the well, he preaches salvation through the Messiah.|$|E

25|$|Whether {{that term}} Filioque is included, {{as well as}} how it is {{translated}} and understood, can have important implications for how <b>one</b> <b>understands</b> the central Christian doctrine of the Holy Trinity. For some, the term implies a serious underestimation of the Father's role in the Trinity; for others, denial of what it expresses implies a serious underestimation {{of the role of the}} Son in the Trinity. Over time, the term became a symbol of conflict between Eastern Christianity and Western Christianity, although there have been attempts at resolving the conflict. Among the early attempts at harmonization are the works of Maximus the Confessor, who notably was canonised independently by both Eastern and Western churches.|$|E
500|$|According to Craig, {{premises}} (2)–(5) {{are relatively}} uncontroversial among philosophers, but [...] "the epistemic entertainability of premise (1) (or its denial) {{does not guarantee}} its metaphysical possibility." [...] Furthermore, Richard M. Gale argued that premise three, the [...] "possibility premise", begs the question. He stated that one only has the epistemic right to accept the premise if <b>one</b> <b>understands</b> the nested modal operators, and that if <b>one</b> <b>understands</b> them within the system S5—without which the argument fails—then <b>one</b> <b>understands</b> that [...] "possibly necessarily" [...] is in essence the same as [...] "necessarily". Thus the premise begs the question because the conclusion is embedded within it.|$|E

Her public approval ratings {{in the wake of the}} revelations shot upward to around 70percent, the highest they had ever been.

500|$|Louis XIV {{gave the}} exiled King and Queen {{the use of}} Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye, where they set up court-in-exile. Mary soon became a popular fixture at Louis XIV's court at Versailles, where diarist Madame de Sévigné {{acclaimed}} Mary for her [...] "distinguished bearing and her quick wit". Questions of precedence, however, marred Mary's relations with the Dauphine of France, Maria Anna of Bavaria. Because Mary was accorded the privileges and rank of a queen, Maria Anna was outranked by her. Therefore, Maria Anna refused to see Mary, etiquette being a sensitive issue at Versailles. In spite of this, Louis XIV and his secret wife, Madame de Maintenon, became close friends with Mary. As there was no queen at the French court, nor a dauphine after 1690, Mary took precedence over all the female members of the French court and French royal house, as did her daughter in her capacity of a royal princess until the next French dauphine appeared in 1711. James was largely excluded from French court life. His contemporaries found him boring, and French courtiers frequently joked that [...] "when one talks to him, <b>one</b> <b>understands</b> why he is here." [...] Mary gave birth to Princess Louise Mary in 1692. She was to be James and Mary's last child.|$|E

James Hunter believed, [...] "uncut Hollywood fluff like [...] "Childhood"...has zero point of view on itself; its blend of rampaging ego and static orchestral pop is a Streisand-size mistake". Chris Willman of the Los Angeles Times {{described it as}} [...] "dynamically enunciated reading and maudlin string arrangement directly invoke Streisand". Tim Molloy, of the Associated Press, called it a sweet sounding pleading song. Patrick Macdonald of The Seattle Times described [...] "Childhood" [...] as [...] "a sad, self-pitying song, but quite moving and beautiful". Taraborrelli observed that the song was not purely about his bad childhood years, but was also a plea for compassion and understanding. The song was covered by Italian singer Cristina D'Avena for her 2009 Magia Di Natale album as a tribute to Michael Jackson.|$|E

If <b>one</b> can <b>understand</b> the two truths, then the four treatises may be <b>understood</b> completely. If <b>one</b> cannot <b>understand</b> the two truths, then the four treatises cannot be understood. For this reason, it is necessary to understand the two truths.

[...] Mikael Wood of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B rating and wrote that Santos' [...] "solo aspirations include cracking the R mainstream", {{and that the}} album [...] "generally sticks to the successful blueprint advertised by [...] title." [...] An editor for Terra Networks gave the album 3 out of 5 stars, noting that while Santos takes risks with the sound and collaborates with other artists from different genres, the bachata tracks sound alike in the production. Peter Margasak of the Chicago Reader wrote a positive review for the album, describing the album as a successful [...] "balancing act between past and present". He said {{the production of the}} album [...] "gives everything vivid colors and gauzy textures", but that some songsincluding the duets [...] "Magia Negra," [...] with Mala Rodríguez and [...] "Rival" [...] with Mario Dommwere [...] "less-than-convincing detours", describing the former as a [...] "throbbing EDM" [...] and the latter as [...] "treacly power balladry". Sarah Godfrey of the Washington Post gave the album a favorable review, admiring Santos for appealing to the Anglophone market without the need to [...] "sell out bachata die-hards", citing [...] "Promise" [...] as the main example. Godfrey said that Santos retains his style on the duet [...] "All Aboard", and that the collaborations were [...] "obviously meant to pull in folks who’ve never heard of Aventura". She praised the compositions, including [...] "La Diabla" [...] and [...] "La Bella y Bestia", which she said are [...] "impossible to resist, whether <b>one</b> <b>understands</b> all of the lyrics or not." ...|$|E
500|$|According to the Hindustan Times, Kaminey [...] "is {{the first}} attempt to deal with reality in a mature, matter of fact manner." [...] Unlike other Hindi films, in which the female lead is Sita, the protagonist is Rama and the {{antagonist}} is Ravana, the characters in Kaminey are nuanced humans in [...] "layered and complex" [...] situations. Namrata Joshi from Outlook wrote that Kaminey reflects Bhardwaj's [...] "enduring fascination for underdogs, characters {{on the margins of}} society and the morally compromised". Bhardwaj told Rediff.com that the film deals with [...] "themes that affect our lives directly", and [...] "is a reminder that we all have a dark side, and often we are not fully aware of that side". Rakesh Bedi from The Economic Times wrote, [...] "Bhardwaj presents the two warring brothers with speech defects. In today's world of logorrhea, communication is fraught with many dangers: misunderstandings, paranoias, recriminations, conflicts. Everyone speaks but no <b>one</b> <b>understands.</b> Bhardwaj gave the twins verbal impediments to show that the world has now been so hardwired to convoluted and calamitous communication that it needs silence or a speech defect to hash things out." [...] He continued, [...] "ith some glitches, Bhardwaj has almost re-birthed the Hindi film". The film also explores sex and sexuality, which according to Bedi were explored in a [...] "radically different and refreshing" [...] way, and the director [...] "daringly takes it a step further". When Sweety becomes pregnant, the couple [...] "decide to carry the pregnancy to term after a bit of hesitation. So she literally pushes her man into marriage. (Had Bhardwaj abjured marriage, {{it would have been a}} complete break but the nuptials were essential to the drama of the film.)" [...] The Daily Beast said that [...] "for aficionados of the Hindi-language genre, Kaminey is a revolutionary manifesto. It takes classic Bollywood tropes—estranged brothers, a case of mistaken identity, high drama approaching slapstick comedy—and presents them with Hollywood-style realism instead of Bollywood's wink-nudge mix of melodrama and posturing.|$|E

[...] Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly, liked the video; however, {{he had no idea}} what was going on: [...] "I can’t wait to hear Lady Gaga explain her latest video, “Alejandro.” Mostly because after watching it (twice!), I have absolutely no clue what’s going on beyond the obvious." [...] Anthony Benigno from Daily News felt that [...] "the shock songstress' new music video [...] is chock full of bed-ridden S imagery that makes it look like the softcore answer to The Matrix. Randall Roberts from Los Angeles Times said [...] "the clip reinforces the notion that no <b>one</b> <b>understands</b> the convergence of image and music right now better than Gaga." [...] Jed Gottlieb from the Boston Herald said that [...] "The plot [...] is hard to decipher, but it’s clearly not a story that ends happily ever after." [...] Jen Dose from National Post commented [...] "Gaga’s new vid for 'Alejandro' certainly brings the crazy we’ve all come to expect from her. It’s like an 8+ minute homage to Madonna—with some gay Nazis thrown in for good measure". Amy Odell of New York said the video's outfits were not as [...] "intense" [...] as those of [...] "Bad Romance" [...] or [...] "Telephone." [...] Nate Jones of Time Magazine disliked the song, but felt the video [...] "looks fantastic... the self-conscious ballsiness of Gaga and director Steven Klein works here." [...] Jennifer Cady from E! liked the video, but did not think it was as good as Gaga's previous work.
