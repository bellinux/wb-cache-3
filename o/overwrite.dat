5|$|TRIM is a SATA {{command that}} enables the {{operating}} system to tell an SSD which blocks of previously saved data are no longer needed {{as a result of}} file deletions or volume formatting. When an LBA is replaced by the OS, as with an <b>overwrite</b> of a file, the SSD knows that the original LBA can be marked as stale or invalid and it will not save those blocks during garbage collection. If the user or operating system erases a file (not just remove parts of it), the file will typically be marked for deletion, but the actual contents on the disk are never actually erased. Because of this, the SSD does not know that it can erase the LBAs previously occupied by the file, so the SSD will keep including such LBAs in the garbage collection.|$|E
5|$|Where {{he did not}} <b>overwrite</b> Maxentius' achievements, Constantine upstaged them: the Circus Maximus was redeveloped so {{that its}} total seating {{capacity}} was twenty-five times larger than that of Maxentius' racing complex on the Via Appia. Maxentius' strongest supporters in the military were neutralized when the Praetorian Guard and Imperial Horse Guard (equites singulares) were disbanded. The tombstones of the Imperial Horse Guard were ground up and put to use in a basilica on the Via Labicana. On November 9, 312AD, barely two weeks after Constantine captured the city, the former base of the Imperial Horse Guard was chosen for redevelopment into the Lateran Basilica. The Legio II Parthica was removed from Alba (Albano Laziale), and the remainder of Maxentius' armies were sent to do frontier duty on the Rhine.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to those existing forms of memory protection, Internet Explorer 9 now opts-in to SEHOP (Structured Exception Handler <b>Overwrite</b> Protection) which works by validating {{the integrity of the}} exception handling chain before dispatching exceptions. This helps ensure that structured exception handling cannot be used as an exploit vector, even when running outdated browser add-ons that have not been recompiled to take advantage of SafeSEH.|$|E
25|$|The {{other main}} issue was that early Macs lack a memory {{management}} unit (MMU), which precludes the possibility of several fundamental modern features. An MMU would provide memory protection to ensure that programs cannot accidentally <b>overwrite</b> other program's memory, and it would provision shared memory. Lacking shared memory, the API was instead written so the operating system and application shares all memory, which is what allows QuickDraw to examine the application's memory for settings like the line drawing mode or color.|$|E
25|$|Anyone who {{can gain}} Administrators access can <b>overwrite,</b> {{override}} {{or change the}} Data Recovery Agent configuration. This {{is a very serious}} issue, since an attacker can for example hack the Administrator account (using third-party tools), set whatever DRA certificate they want as the Data Recovery Agent and wait. This is sometimes referred to as a two-stage attack, which is a significantly different scenario than the risk due to a lost or stolen PC, but which highlights the risk due to malicious insiders.|$|E

3000|$|... (Joukov and Zadok 2005) {{proposed}} a file system extension, purgefs, which uses block-based <b>overwriting</b> when blocks are {{returned to the}} file system’s free blocks list. It supports <b>overwriting</b> file data and metadata for all files or just files marked as sensitive. (Joukov and Zadok 2006) also proposed three secure deletion approaches for EXT 3. The first approach is called EXT 3 basic, which securely deletes data (but not metadata) once by <b>overwriting</b> it. The second approach is called EXT 3 comprehensive, which <b>overwrites</b> file data and metadata by a configurable <b>overwriting</b> scheme. Both the aforementioned two overwriting-based approaches can securely delete all the data or just files whose extended attributes include a sensitive flag. The third approach is based on intercepting files deletion events, i.e., unlinking and truncating a file. The file to be deleted is moved into a special secure deletion directory, and a background user-level tool shred (Plumb 2010) will delete the files in the secure deletion directory at regular intervals.|$|R

25|$|A {{recent study}} has {{obtained}} evidence that could support {{the existence of}} an intermediate visual store with characteristics of both iconic memory and VSTM (Sligte et al., 2008). This intermediate store is proposed to have high capacity (up to 15 items) and prolonged memory trace duration (up to 4 seconds). It coexists with VSTM but unlike it visual stimuli can <b>overwrite</b> the contents of its visual store (Pinto et al., 2013). Further research suggests an involvement of visual area V4 (Sligte et al., 2009).|$|E
25|$|Due to {{concerns}} expressed {{to his office}} in November 2007 that there were actions underway to <b>overwrite</b> email tapes and the Governor's Office was not complying with the Sunshine Law, AG Jay Nixon appointed special investigators on November 15 to study what was taking place. Nixon's team {{had to go to}} court in the spring of 2008 to get a ruling on whether the governor's office was required to comply with their requests for information, {{at the expense of the}} state. Through various legal maneuverings, the court ruled in favor of the investigation, appointing two Special Attorneys General to lead it. The governor never was deposed. Eventually the completion of the investigation was extended to February 2009 because of the volume of materials that needed to be reviewed. The Kansas City Star, St. Louis Post-Dispatch and Associated Press filed petitions in August 2008 as intervening plaintiffs to gain preliminary and injunctive relief, declaratory judgment that the emails were public records under the state Sunshine Law, and access to the emails under discussion.|$|E

The investigators testified they had also recovered an exchange from May 2010 between Manning and Eric Schmiedl, a Boston mathematician, in which Manning said she was the source of the Baghdad helicopter attack ("Collateral Murder") video. Johnson said there had been two attempts to delete material from the MacBook. The operating system had been re-installed in January 2010, and on or around January 31, 2010, an attempt had been made to erase the hard drive by doing a [...] "zero-fill", which involves overwriting material with zeroes. The material was recovered after the <b>overwrite</b> attempts from unallocated space.|$|E

50|$|<b>Overwriting</b> is {{a process}} of writing a binary set of data in {{computer}} data storage and is a term used to describe when new information replaces old information or data. In general it writes over the previous data, hence the name. <b>Overwriting</b> generally occurs when unused file system clusters are written upon with new data, though <b>overwriting</b> is also used in security algorithms. These algorithms use a precise set of rules to remove any part of an original data from the memory by writing a new raw data on the memory.|$|R

500|$|The {{presence}} {{and influence of}} L'ange is evident in Donizetti's autograph score of La favorite, which features [...] "large chunks" [...] of L'ange [...] "cut up and interleaved" [...] in which new character names and text for La favorite <b>overwrite</b> the old. The final page of L'ange {{was used as the}} final page of La favorite; therefore, both operas bear the same finish date on the last page. Donizetti's contract for La favorite demanded a 1 December 1840 premiere, leaving him little time for dramatic changes. In his 1965 biography Donizetti, Ashbrook surmises that this tight deadline gave rise to the legend that Donizetti actually composed the last act of La favorite in a single night. In fact, the libretto of L'ange and the autograph score of La favorite make clear that the final act of La favorite was completed long before Donizetti began the rest of it in September—Donizetti lifted it from L'ange with the exception of two solo passages. He brought in librettist Eugène Scribe to oversee the new text, which also required the approval of starring mezzo-soprano Rosine Stoltz. The finished product was an amalgamation of the unfinished Adelaide, the never-performed L'ange de Nisida, and new material worked into the score by Donizetti and into the libretto by Scribe. La favorite premiered on 2 December 1840.|$|E
2500|$|A buffer {{overflow}} {{occurring in the}} heap data area {{is referred to as}} a heap overflow and is exploitable in a manner different from that of stack-based overflows. [...] Memory on the heap is dynamically allocated by the application at run-time and typically contains program data.

[...] The canonical heap overflow technique overwrites dynamic memory allocation linkage (such as malloc meta data) and uses the resulting pointer exchange to <b>overwrite</b> a program function pointer.|$|E
