5|$|Fermentation is {{sometimes}} {{carried out in}} two stages, primary and secondary. Once most of the alcohol has been produced during primary fermentation, the beer is transferred to a new vessel and allowed a period of secondary fermentation. Secondary fermentation is used when the beer requires long storage before packaging or greater clarity. When the beer has fermented, it is packaged either into casks for cask ale or kegs, aluminium cans, or bottles for <b>other</b> <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> beer.|$|E
5|$|Other methods {{commonly}} practised in Europe included severing the tendons at {{the knees}} or placing poppy seeds, millet, or sand {{on the ground at}} the grave site of a presumed vampire; this was intended to keep the vampire occupied all night by counting the fallen grains, indicating an association of vampires with arithmomania. Similar Chinese narratives state that if a vampire-like being came across a sack of rice, it would have to count every grain; this is a theme encountered in myths from the Indian subcontinent, as well as in South American tales of witches and <b>other</b> <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> evil or mischievous spirits or beings.|$|E

25|$|Invariant {{representations}} {{has been}} incorporated into several learning architectures, such as neocognitrons. Most of these architectures, however, provided invariance through custom-designed features or properties of architecture itself. While it helps {{to take into account}} some sorts of transformations, such as translations, it is very nontrivial to accommodate for <b>other</b> <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> transformations, such as 3D rotations and changing facial expressions. M-Theory provides a framework of how such transformations can be learned. In addition to higher flexibility, this theory also suggests how human brain may have similar capabilities.|$|E

25|$|The {{crocodile}} {{was regarded}} as an extremely fierce animal, often used to terrify enemies during war. The crocodile cult was devoted to Sebek, god of fertility, and the sun god, Re. Typically, crocodiles were raised in a life of complete luxury, indulged until they died. In {{the early years of}} this cult, dead crocodiles were lavishly mummified with gold and other precious things. However, as mummification gradually became a production process, less effort was exerted in their mummification and eventually consisted simply of cloth wrappings and the application of resin, a preserving agent. When found in extremely large quantities, crocodile mummies, like many <b>other</b> <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> animal offerings, contained only reeds or random body parts.|$|E
25|$|Abu Dhabi's {{government}} {{is looking to}} expand revenue from {{oil and gas production}} to tourism and <b>other</b> <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> things which would attract different types of people. This goal is seen in the amount of attention Abu Dhabi is giving to its International Airport. The airport, in 2009, experienced a 30%+ growth in passenger usage. This idea of diversification of the economy is also seen in the Abu Dhabi Economic Vision 2030 planned by the Abu Dhabi Urban Planning Council. In this plan Abu Dhabi's economy will be sustainable and not be dependent on any one facet or source of revenue. More specifically the non-oil portion of income is planned to be increased from about 40% to about 70%.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the felt}} hat {{industry}} in Denton and Haughton was prosperous and {{an integral part}} of the town, working conditions in the factories were not risk free. One of the problems workers faced was mercury poisoning; mercury was used to separate the fur from the rabbit hide and workers were in regular contact with fur impregnated with mercury or exposed to mercury vapour. Inadequate ventilation in some parts of the hat making process led to <b>other</b> <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> dangers; solvents were also used and on 14 January 1901 there was an explosion at the factory of Joseph Wilson & Sons in Denton, killing 13 people and injuring many more.

500|$|The art {{was praised}} by critics for {{supporting}} {{the seriousness of the}} text. Publishers Weekly said the art [...] "takes what should be a self-evidently ludicrous proposition and somehow imbues it with plausibility". Jeff VanderMeer agreed, describing the art as detailed but never cluttered, adding realism to the plot. Reviewer Christopher Allen said Alanguilan's [...] "inking gifts [...] on display with lots of rural texture." [...] Greg McElhatton said Elmer [...] "takes its subject quite seriously, avoiding chicken puns, jokes, and <b>other</b> <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> trickery," [...] but expressed disappointment that Jake was not as compelling of a character as Elmer.|$|E
500|$|Fictional invocations of Benedict Arnold's name {{also carried}} {{strongly}} negative overtones.

The boy is not identified {{until the end of}} the story, when his place of birth is given as Norwich, Connecticut, and his name is given as Benedict Arnold. However, not all depictions of Arnold were so negative. Some theatrical treatments of the 19th century explored his duplicity, seeking to understand rather than demonize it.|$|E
