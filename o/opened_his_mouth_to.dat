25|$|During World War II, both Japanese {{military}} personnel, {{especially the}} Kempeitai, {{and the officers}} of the Gestapo, the German secret police, used waterboarding {{as a method of}} torture. During the Japanese occupation of Singapore, the Double Tenth Incident occurred. This included waterboarding, by the method of binding or holding down the victim on his back, placing a cloth over his mouth and nose, and pouring water onto the cloth. In this version, interrogation continued during the torture, with the interrogators beating the victim if he did not reply and the victim swallowing water if he <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> answer or breathe. When the victim could ingest no more water, the interrogators would beat or jump on his distended stomach.|$|E
2500|$|Looking {{over his}} right shoulder, and [...] {{bringing}} {{his head into}} line with the blast hole, Gage <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> speak; in that same instant the tamping iron sparked against the rock and (possibly because the sand had been omitted) the powder exploded. Rocketed from the hole, the tamping iron in diameter, [...] long, and weighing entered {{the left side of}} Gage's face in an upward direction, just forward of the angle of the lower jaw. Continuing upward outside the upper jaw and possibly fracturing the cheekbone, it passed behind the left eye, through {{the left side of the}} brain, and out the top of the skull through the frontal bone.|$|E

60|$|The master-trainer paused, and {{the lion}} man <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> speak.|$|E

He lives his life for sadomasochism.|$|R
