5|$|In captive Egyptian fruit bats, 70% of the {{directed}} calls {{could be}} identified as to which bat made it, and 60% could be categorised into four contexts: squabbling over food, jostling over position in their sleeping cluster, protesting over mating attempts and arguing when perched {{in close proximity to}} each other. The animals made slightly different sounds when communicating with different individuals, especially one of the opposite sex. Male hammerheaded bats produce deep, resonating, monotonous calls to attract females. Bats in flight make vocal signal for traffic control.

5|$|Ultimately, the Solar System {{is stable}} in {{that none of}} the planets are likely to collide with each other or be ejected from the system in the next few billion years. Beyond this, within fivebillion years or so Mars's {{eccentricity}} may grow to around 0.2, such that it lies on an Earth-crossing orbit, leading to a potential collision. In the same timescale, Mercury's eccentricity may grow even further, and a close encounter with Venus could theoretically eject it from the Solar System altogether or send it <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>collision</b> <b>course</b> with Venus or Earth. This could happen within a billion years, according to numerical simulations in which Mercury's orbit is perturbed.|$|E
5|$|Warning from Space {{influenced}} Toho's Gorath, a 1963 film which {{depicts a}} rogue planet <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>collision</b> <b>course</b> with Earth.

5|$|After {{the success}} of Toho's 1954 film Godzilla, which {{depicted}} a giant dinosaur attacking Tokyo, many Japanese film studios began to produce similar monster films, including Warning from Space. Along with other films such as Shintōhō's Terrifying Attack of the Flying Saucers and the American Forbidden Planet, Warning from Space became part of a fledgling subgenre of films based around science fiction creatures. The film also used the theme of atomic bombs that was present in many films at the time, but showed how the weapons, which devastated the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki a decade earlier, could be put to good use. Still others noted the film used another common theme of cosmic collisions {{in the style of}} earlier films such as the 1931 film End of the World, which depicted a comet <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>collision</b> <b>course</b> with the Earth.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Detecting colliding {{objects in}} complex dynamic scenes is a {{difficult}} task for conventional computer vision techniques. However, visual processing mechanisms in animals such as insects may provide very simple and effective solutions for detecting colliding objects in complex dynamic scenes. In this paper, we propose <b>a</b> robust <b>collision</b> detecting system, which consists of a lobula giant movement detector (LGMD) based neural network and a translating sensitive neural network (TSNN), to recognise objects <b>on</b> <b>a</b> direct <b>collision</b> <b>course</b> in complex dynamic scenes. The LGMD based neural network is specialized for recognizing looming objects that are <b>on</b> <b>a</b> direct <b>collision</b> <b>course.</b> The TSNN, which fuses the extracted visual motion cues from several whole field direction selective neural networks, is only sensitive to translating movements in the dynamic scenes. The looming cue and translating cue revealed by the two specialized visual motion detectors are fused in the present system via a decision making mechanism. In the system, the LGMD {{plays a key role}} in detecting imminent collision; the decision from TSNN becomes useful only when <b>a</b> <b>collision</b> alarm has been issued by the LGMD network. Using driving scenarios as an example, we showed that the bio-inspired system can reliably detect imminent colliding objects in complex driving scenes...|$|R

5|$|As {{the group}} makes {{their way through}} the damaged ship, they swim through a flooded kitchen. They are chased by two xenomorphs. One is killed, while the other snatches Hillard. As they escape the kitchen, the xenomorph returns and blinds Christie, who sacrifices himself to kill the xenomorph so the others can escape. After Wren betrays the group, Call is {{revealed}} to be an auton, an improved version of a human created by synthetics. Using her ability to interface with the Aurigas systems, Call sets it <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>collision</b> <b>course</b> with Earth, hoping to destroy the xenomorphs in the crash. She cuts off Wren's escape route and directs the xenomorphs towards him. Ripley 8 is captured by a xenomorph, while the others head for the Betty. Wren, who is already aboard, shoots Purvis, takes Call hostage and demands that she abort the collision. An injured Purvis attacks Wren and forces Wren's head to his chest just as the xenomorph embryo he is carrying bursts through his ribcage, causing it to go through Wren's head too, killing them both. The survivors shoot and kill the juvenile xenomorph.|$|E
5|$|In {{the year}} 2001, {{the space station}} Silicon Valley was launched, housing {{numerous}} animals. Seven minutes after its launch, it vanished. Believed to have disappeared forever, it reappears in the year 3000, and the many expeditions sent to retrieve the space station vanished without explanation. Following this, the duo of Dan Danger and Evo were sent to investigate; they discover that the animal cargo has evolved and merged with the station's technology, resulting in animals such as an electronically-powered fox with motorised wheels, and a steam-powered hippopotamus. Evo sets out to fix the control station, which is <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>collision</b> <b>course</b> with Earth. Upon arriving at the control room, Evo confronts the Evil Brain, who is fascinated by Evo's abilities and wants to keep him to complete the collection of robotic animals. The Evil Brain threatens to destroy the Earth, but is quickly defeated by Evo. Despite this, Evo is unable to stop the space station from spinning out of control; it collides with Earth, landing in New York Harbor. The robotic animals escape and flee around New York City, and Evo sets out to terminate them before they terrorise the planet.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 2–3 June 1969, Melbourne and her escorts were {{involved}} in anti-submarine training exercises in the South China Sea. In preparation for launching a Tracker, Stevenson ordered Evans to the plane guard station, reminded the destroyer of Melbournes course, and instructed the carrier's navigational lights {{to be brought to}} full brilliance. Evans had performed the manoeuvre four times {{over the course of the}} night. Evans was positioned on Melbournes port bow, but began the manoeuvre by turning starboard, towards the carrier. A radio message was sent from Melbourne to Evans bridge and Combat Information Centre, warning the destroyer that she was <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>collision</b> <b>course,</b> which Evans acknowledged. Seeing the destroyer take no action and on a course to place herself under Melbournes bow, Stevenson ordered the carrier hard to port, signalling the turn by both radio and siren blasts. At approximately the same time, Evans turned hard to starboard to avoid the approaching carrier. It is uncertain which ship began to manoeuvre first, but each ship's bridge crew claimed that they were informed of the other ship's turn after they commenced their own. After having narrowly passed in front of Melbourne, the turns quickly placed Evans back in the carrier's path. Melbourne hit Evans amidships at 3:15am, cutting the destroyer in two.|$|E

40|$|Looming images {{indicate}} the rapid approach {{of objects and}} provide warning information about the impending impact. Prospective control when responding to a looming virtual object approaching <b>on</b> <b>a</b> direct <b>collision</b> <b>course</b> was studied longitudinally in 12 infants aged 3 / 4 and 11 / 12 months. Brain electrical recordings (EEG) and different characteristics of the looming-related visual evoked potential (VEP) were explored and compared between the infants at these different ages. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate how infants at this early age process looming stimuli approaching <b>on</b> <b>a</b> direct <b>collision</b> <b>course</b> under three different accelerations. It was also investigated how neural information is processed in the infant brain by applying the General Tau Theory. The results showed that the timing and the duration of the VEP responses differed with age. At the age of 3 / 4 months, infants showed VEP peaks after the looming virtual objects had hit them. At the age of 11 / 12 months, on the other hand, infants showed clear looming-related VEP peaks before virtual impact. Further, the application of the General Tau Theory showed that when looming-related information flows inside the neurons in a particular brain region, infants’ ability to pick up the flow improves as they mature and get more locomotor experience providing them more veridical information about time-to-collision information. Brain maturation together with a dramatic increase in locomotor experience during the first year of life in infancy could explain the developmental trend in our study. Further studies is needed to investigate brain associated activity with infants’ perception of looming motion...|$|R
