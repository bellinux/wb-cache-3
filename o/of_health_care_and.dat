Health care providers recommend that those suffering from concussion return for further medical care and evaluation 24 to 72hours after the concussive event if the symptoms worsen. Athletes, especially intercollegiate or professional, are typically followed closely by team athletic trainers during this period but others may not have access to this level <b>of</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>and</b> may be sent home with minimal monitoring.|$|E

5|$|London is a {{regional}} centre <b>of</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>and</b> education, being {{home to the}} University of Western Ontario, Fanshawe College, and several hospitals. The city hosts a number of musical and artistic exhibits and festivals, which contribute to its tourism industry, but its economic activity is centred on education, medical research, insurance, and information technology. London's university and hospitals are among its top ten employers. London lies at the junction of Highway 401 and 402, connecting it to Toronto, Windsor (which is directly {{across the border from}} Detroit), and Sarnia. It also has an international airport, train and bus station.|$|E
5|$|The Menominee Indian Tribe {{had entered}} {{into a series of}} {{treaties}} with the United States that did not specifically state that they had hunting and fishing rights. In 1961, Congress terminated the tribe's federal recognition, ending its right to govern itself, federal support <b>of</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>and</b> education programs, police and fire protection, and tribal rights to land. In 1963, three members of the tribe were charged with violating Wisconsin's hunting and fishing laws on land which had been a reservation for over 100 years. The tribe members were acquitted, but when the state appealed, the Wisconsin Supreme Court held that the Menominee tribe no longer had hunting and fishing rights because of the termination action by Congress.|$|E
5|$|However, the BC NDP {{were deeply}} unpopular within the province, {{reaching}} a low at 15% support in opinion polls {{at the time}} of Glen Clark's resignation as Premier in August 1999. With Dosanjh as leader, support had risen to 21% by August 2000. Dosanjh was consistently ranked higher personal popularity over opposition leader Gordon Campbell until the run-up to the May 16, 2001, provincial election. Dosanjh and the BC NDP knew they would not be reelected, so they concentrated their campaign to a few ridings in the Lower Mainland which were still considered competitive. Their campaign focused on the expanding economy, issues <b>of</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>and</b> education, and Dosanjh's personal popularity over Campbell. Dosanjh conceded defeat a week before the election, but requested voters consider making the NDP a strong opposition party. After the vote, on May 16, Dosanjh lost his seat in Vancouver-Kensington along with all but two members of his Cabinet in the second-worst defeat of a sitting provincial government in Canada. The BC Liberals won all 77 other seats.|$|E

25|$|Single-payer {{healthcare}} systems pay for {{all covered}} healthcare-related services by a single government or government-related source. It is a strategy employed by governments to achieve several goals, including universal health care, decreased economic burden <b>of</b> <b>health</b> <b>care,</b> <b>and</b> improved health outcomes for the population. Universal health care worldwide was established as a goal of the World Health Organization in 2010 and adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015 for the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.|$|E
25|$|Many OECD {{countries}} have implemented reforms to achieve policy goals of ensuring {{access to health}} care, improving the quality <b>of</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>and</b> health outcomes, allocating an appropriate level of public sector other resources to healthcare {{but at the same}} time ensuring that services are provided in a cost-efficient and cost-effective manner (microeconomic efficiency). A range of measures, such as better payment methods, have improved the microeconomic incentives facing providers. However, introducing improved incentives through a more competitive environment among providers and insurers has proved difficult.|$|E
25|$|Infertility {{is often}} not seen (by the West) as being an issue outside industrialized countries. This is because of {{assumptions}} about overpopulation problems and hyper fertility in developing countries, and a perceived need for them to decrease their populations and birth rates. The lack <b>of</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>and</b> high rates of life-threatening illness (such as HIV/AIDS) in developing countries, {{such as those in}} Africa, are supporting reasons for the inadequate supply of fertility treatment options. Fertility treatments, even simple ones such as treatment for STIs that cause infertility, are therefore not usually made available to individuals in these countries.|$|E

25|$|As {{the quality}} of health care has {{increasingly}} become an issue around the world, hospitals have increasingly had to pay serious attention to this matter. Independent external assessment of quality {{is one of the}} most powerful ways to assess this aspect <b>of</b> <b>health</b> <b>care,</b> <b>and</b> hospital accreditation is one means by which this is achieved. In many parts of the world such accreditation is sourced from other countries, a phenomenon known as international healthcare accreditation, by groups such as Accreditation Canada from Canada, the Joint Commission from the USA, the Trent Accreditation Scheme from Great Britain, and Haute Authorité de santé (HAS) from France.|$|E

This expanded into managing schools and teaching at the secondary level. Then in 1976 Deacon Cal Cathers of SOLT founded BRC Printing Limited to print primarily reading and math textbooks for schools. In 1990 SOLT founded Mt. Carmel High School in Benque, staffed largely by foreign volunteers, and also opened Divine Mercy Church in Belize City. In 1998, John Marhevka of SOLT founded a Catholic bookstore and radio station in Benque. In 2005, he built a media center and radio station in Belize City and in 2010 Power FM Catholic Youth Radio began broadcasting, to which was added Radio Guadalupe Catholic Radio Station in 2013. By 2014, 20 members had served in Belize for extended periods of time.|$|E
25|$|The AMA {{has given}} high {{priority}} to supporting changes in medical malpractice law to limit damage awards, which, it contends, {{makes it difficult}} for patients to find appropriate medical care. In many states, high-risk specialists have moved to other states with such limits. For example, in 2004, not a single neurosurgeon remained in the entire southern half of Illinois. The main legislative emphasis in multiple states has been to effect caps on the amount that patients can receive for pain and suffering. These costs for pain and suffering are only those that exceed the actual costs <b>of</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>and</b> lost income. Multiple states found that limiting pain and suffering costs has dramatically slowed increases in the cost of medical malpractice insurance. The state of Texas enacted such reforms in 2003 and subsequently reported in 2005 that all major malpractice insurers were able to offer either no increase or a decrease in premiums to physicians.|$|E
