Materials and methods: This was a retrospective review of our hospital information system on patients with right-sided aortic arch who underwent chest computed tomography (CT) from April 2003 to September 2014. CT were reviewed to evaluate the position and thickness of <b>osteophytes</b> and that of focal pulmonary opacities adjacent to <b>osteophytes,</b> comparing data between the patients with <b>osteophytes</b> with pulmonary opacity (group A) and patients with <b>osteophytes</b> without pulmonary opacity (group B). Results: There were 25 patients totally, 23 cases of left-sided thoracic <b>osteophytes,</b> two cases on both sides. Compar-ing Group A (n = 10) and Group B (n = 15), the presence of pulmonary opacities was significantly associated with thickness of <b>osteophytes</b> (Mann–Whitney U test, P < 0. 05). Conclusion: In patients with right-sided aortic arch, thoracic <b>osteophytes</b> were often observed on the left side. The presence of pulmonary opacities adjacent to thoracic <b>osteophytes</b> was associated with thickness of <b>osteophytes.</b> Furthermore, these interstitial opacities should not be considered a preclinical form of fibrosing lung disease...|$|R

50|$|The natural {{evolution}} of disc disease and degeneration leads to stiffening of the intervertebral joint. This leads to <b>osteophyte</b> formation - a bony overgrowth about the joint. This process is called spondylosis, and {{is part of}} the normal aging of the spine. This has been seen in studies of normal and diseased spines. Degenerative changes begin to occur without symptoms as early as age 25-30 years. It is not uncommon for people to experience at least one severe case of low back pain by the age of 35 years. This can be expected to improve and become less prevalent as the individual develops <b>osteophyte</b> formation around the discs.|$|E
50|$|Early {{on there}} is {{flattening}} of articular surfaces, thinning of cartilage with <b>osteophyte</b> (spur) formation.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: We report {{two cases}} in which {{dysphagia}} and aspiration, caused by anterior cervical <b>osteophytes,</b> were so severe that surgical resection was performed. METHOD: Case reports and {{a review of the}} world literature concerning dysphagia caused by anterior cervical <b>osteophytes,</b> in regard to pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment. RESULTS: Two patients, aged 71 and 70 years, had long-standing, slowly progressive dysphagia and aspiration; one patient had recurrent episodes of aspiration pneumonia as a result. Both patients were diagnosed on videofluoroscopy with large bony anterior cervical <b>osteophytes.</b> Immediate relief of symptoms was obtained after resection of the <b>osteophytes</b> via an anterolateral, extrapharyngeal approach. Anterior cervical <b>osteophytes</b> are relatively common in the elderly, although not frequently diagnosed, and are mostly seen in cases of diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis.

40|$|Abstract Background X-ray {{images of}} lumbar {{degenerative}} diseases often show not only claw <b>osteophytes,</b> but also pairs of <b>osteophytes</b> that form {{in a direction}} away from the adjacent disc. We have investigated the direction of the formation of anterior lumbar vertebral <b>osteophytes</b> across the lumbar vertebrae using a sufficient number of lumbar radiographs, because <b>osteophytes</b> images can provide essential information that will contribute {{to the understanding of the}} pathology and progress of lumbar spine degeneration. Methods The direction of the formation of 14, 250 pairs of anterior lumbar vertebral <b>osteophytes</b> across the adjacent intervertebral discs in 2, 850 patients who were all over 60 years old was investigated. Anterior lumbar vertebral <b>osteophytes</b> were distributed into six groups based on the direction of extension of each pair of <b>osteophytes</b> across the intervertebral disc space. Results In L 1 –L 2 and L 2 –L 3, the number of patients classified into groups B (the pair of <b>osteophytes</b> extended in the direction of the adjacent disc) and C (almost complete bone bridge formation by a pair of <b>osteophytes</b> across the intervertebral disc space) was larger than that classified into group D (the pair of <b>osteophytes</b> extended {{in a direction away}} from the adjacent disc). In L 3 –L 4, L 4 –L 5 and L 5 -S 1, the number of patients in group D was greater than that of patients belonging to groups B and C. Conclusion Our study showed that pairs of <b>osteophytes</b> frequently formed in the direction of the adjacent disc in the upper lumbar vertebrae (L 1 –L 2 and L 2 –L 3) and in the direction away from the adjacent disc in middle or lower lumbar vertebrae (L 3 –L 4, L 4 –L 5, and L 5 -S 1). </p...|$|R
50|$|The {{condition}} is likely triggered {{by changes in}} the anulus fibrosus, the tough outer ring of the intervertebral disc. This disc degeneration caues osteophytes {{to grow in the}} area. The osteophytes develop bridges of connective tissue which become ossified, forming bone spurs. The pattern of <b>osteophyte</b> formation varies. The exact pathophysiology of the process is unclear.|$|E
50|$|<b>Osteophyte</b> {{formation}} {{has been}} classically related to any sequential and consequential changes in bone formation that {{is due to}} aging, degeneration, mechanical instability, and disease (such as diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis). Often osteophytes form in osteoarthritic joints {{as a result of}} damage and wear from inflammation. Calcification and new bone formation can also occur in response to mechanical damage in joints.|$|E
50|$|The fabella (Latin {{for little}} bean) (or flabella) {{is a small}} sesamoid bone found in some mammals {{embedded}} in the tendon of the lateral head of the gastrocnemius muscle behind the lateral condyle of the femur. It is a variant of normal anatomy and present in humans in 10% to 30% of individuals. Rarely, there are 2 or 3 of these bones (fabella bi- or tripartita). It can {{be mistaken for a}} loose body or <b>osteophyte.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Osteophytes</b> form {{because of}} the {{increase}} in a damaged joint's surface area. This is most common from the onset of arthritis. <b>Osteophytes</b> usually limit joint movement and typically cause pain.|$|R
30|$|<b>Osteophytes</b> {{were found}} in 39 and 56 % of the {{adolescents}} at BL and FU respectively, and in 94 and 100 % of the adults at those time points. The prevalence of <b>osteophytes</b> in the adults {{is higher than the}} 74 % prevalence rate of <b>osteophytes</b> in an MRI study of 710 healthy adults {{with a mean age of}} 62.3  years (Guermazi et al. 2012). A previous study in 685 subjects with a mean age of 28.5  years found that <b>osteophytes</b> were more prevalent in athletes and those who had undergone surgery (Roemer et al. 2015), suggesting that both long-term volleyball participation and prior knee surgeries contributed to the high prevalence of <b>osteophytes</b> in our adult cohort, as well as their greater prevalence and severity of <b>osteophytes</b> compared to those found in adolescents. At FU, adult athletes with prior knee injuries had more severe <b>osteophytes</b> than those without prior knee injury, which corresponds well to previous literature showing injury status to be a predictor of knee OA (Kohatsu and Schurman 1990, Felson et al. 2000). Since <b>osteophytes</b> are a hallmark of and are associated with structural progression of OA (Audrey et al. 2014, Barr et al. 2015), it would be fruitful for further studies to investigate how they correlate with the symptoms and development of OA in athletes in the long-term.|$|R
30|$|Otake et al. {{showed that}} the {{histological}} findings of the focal pulmonary opacity were fibrosis; these irreversible findings {{may have been due}} to compression of the <b>osteophytes</b> and did not depend on position (Otake et al. 2002). Among cases with right-sided aortic arch, the focal pulmonary opacities adjacent to the <b>osteophytes</b> would be expected to have the same histological findings. These reports signify that pulmonary interstitial opacities adjacent to <b>osteophytes</b> {{could be one of the}} most famous pseudo lesions that radiologists need to know when evaluating chest CT. The experienced radiologists will not misdiagnose the focal pulmonary opacities in contact with the <b>osteophytes</b> as pulmonary interstitial pneumonia. However, in some cases, it may be difficult to differentiate the focal pulmonary interstitial opacities adjacent to thoracic spine <b>osteophytes</b> from the peripheral-type lung cancer.|$|R
50|$|A {{syndesmophyte}} is a bony growth originating {{inside a}} ligament, commonly {{seen in the}} ligaments of the spine, specifically the ligaments in the intervertebral joints leading to fusion of vertebrae. Syndesmophytes are pathologically similar to osteophytes. Ankylosing spondylitis patients are particularly prone to developing syndesmophytes. They are also commonly seen in patients who have had back surgery or other chronic stresses on the ligaments of their spine. Syndesmophytes indicates Spine destruction (<b>osteophyte</b> of spine) but they bridge across the joint as compared to osteophytes which are non-bridging.|$|E
50|$|Fibrocartilage {{replaces the}} {{gelatinous}} mucoid material of the nucleus pulposus as the disc changes with age. There may be splits in the anulus fibrosus, permitting herniation of elements of nucleus pulposus. There {{may also be}} shrinkage of the nucleus pulposus that produces prolapse or folding of the anulus fibrosus with secondary <b>osteophyte</b> formation {{at the margins of}} the adjacent vertebral body. The pathologic findings in DDD include protrusion, spondylolysis, and/or subluxation of vertebrae (spondylolisthesis) and spinal stenosis. It has been hypothesized that Propionibacterium acnes may play a role.|$|E
50|$|DISH {{can present}} with spinal {{stiffness}} on forward flexion/back extension, or with mild back pain. It is symptomatic for thoracic spinal pain in approximately 80% of patients. Back pain or stiffness is {{worse in the}} morning in almost two-thirds of patients. It may also be asymptomatic and discovered as an incidental radiological abnormality. Dysphagia from cervical spine <b>osteophyte</b> impingement of esophagus is reported in some cases. Similar calcification and ossification may be seen at peripheral entheseal sites, including the shoulder, iliac crest, ischial tuberosity, trochanters of the hip, tibial tuberosities, patellae, and bones of the hands and/or feet.|$|E
50|$|Enthesiophytes are {{abnormal}} bony projections at {{the attachment}} of a tendon or ligament. They {{are not to}} be confused with <b>osteophytes,</b> which are abnormal bony projections in joint spaces. Enthesiophytes and <b>osteophytes</b> are bone responses for stress.|$|R
40|$|Anterior {{cervical}} <b>osteophytes</b> {{are common}} and usually asymptomatic in elderly people. Due to mechanical compressions, inflammations, and tissues swelling of <b>osteophytes,</b> patients may be presented with multiple complications, such as dysphagia, dysphonia, dyspnea, and pulmonary aspiration. Paradoxical vocal cord motion is an uncommon disease characterized by vocal cord adductions during inspiration and/or expiration. This condition can create shortness of breath, wheezing, respiratory stridor or breathy dysphonia. We report a rare case demonstrating combined symptoms of dyspnea, dysphonia {{as well as}} dysphagia {{at the same time}} in a patient with asymptomatic anterior cervical <b>osteophytes.</b> Moreover, this is the first report demonstrating that anterior <b>osteophytes</b> can be a possible etiological factor for paradoxical vocal cord motion that induces serious respiratory symptoms...|$|R
40|$|Large {{anterior}} cervical <b>osteophytes</b> {{can occur}} in degeneration of the cervical spine or in {{diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis}} (DISH).

Voluminous anterior cervical <b>osteophytes</b> extending from C 3 to C 7 and narrowing the pharyngoesophageal segment by external compression and bilateral vocal fold immobility were diagnosed radiologically and by fiberoptic laryngoscopy Surgical removal of all <b>osteophytes</b> led to the resolution of symptoms.

The exhaustive diagnostic workup proposed in the literature could be simplified by using fiberoptic laryngoscopy and dynamic videofluoroscopy. The causes, treatment, and outcome are discussed...|$|R
50|$|Associated {{radiological}} findings {{include a}} vacuum phenomenon (in the nucleus pulposis of the adjacent intervertebral disc), reduction of disc height with corresponding {{loss of the}} disc space, marginal sclerosis of the adjacent vertebral bodies, <b>osteophyte</b> formation and apophyseal joint instability. With a retrolisthesis {{there is always a}} less than ideal positioning of spinal segments. There is also always a reduced anterior to posterior dimension of the spinal canal compared to the way it is supposed to be. The greater the posterior displacement, the more significant it is for producing a dysfunctional spinal cord or even a cauda equina syndrome.|$|E

50|$|The {{pia mater}} of {{the spinal cord}} has a pair of denticulate ligaments (one {{on each side of}} the spinal cord) with 21 {{attachments}} per side which attach it to the arachnoid and dura mater.

50|$|Laceration of a nerve root, {{or damage}} from cautery or {{traction}} {{can lead to}} chronic pain, however this {{can be difficult to}} determine. Chronic compression of the nerve root by a persistent agent such as disc, bone (<b>osteophyte)</b> or scarring can also permanently damage the nerve root. Epidural scarring caused by the initial pathology or occurring after the surgery can also contribute to nerve damage. In one study of failed back patients, the presence of pathology was noted to be at the same site as the level of surgery performed in 57% of cases. The remaining cases developed pathology at a different level, or on the opposite side, but at the same level as the surgery was performed. In theory, all failed back patients have some sort of nerve injury or damage which leads to a persistence of symptoms after a reasonable healing time.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{examine the}} size and {{direction}} of <b>osteophyte</b> in knee osteoarthritis (OA) and to deter-mine associations between <b>osteophyte</b> size and other radiographic features. Methods: Knee radiographs (standing extended anteroposterior and 30 degrees flexion skyline views) were examined from 204 patients referred to hospital with symptomatic knee OA (155 women, 49 men; mean age 70, range 34 – 91 years). A single observer assessed films for <b>osteophyte</b> size and direction at eight sites; narrowing in each compartment; varus/valgus angulation; patellofemoral sub-luxation; attrition; and chondrocalcinosis using a standard atlas, direct measurement, or visual assess-ment. For analysis, one OA knee was selected at random from each subject. Results: <b>Osteophyte</b> direction at the eight sites was divisible into five categories. At all sites, except for the lateral tibial plateau and the medial patella, <b>osteophyte</b> direction varied according to (a) the size of <b>osteophyte</b> and (b) the degree of local narrowing. At the medial femur, medial tibia, and lateral femur <b>osteophyte</b> direction changed from being predominantly horizontal to predominantly vertical with increasing size.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Knee pain is {{a complex}} problem that can occur after total knee arthroplasty. One cause of knee pain {{may be due to}} a {{retained}} <b>osteophyte,</b> {{but it is not clear}} if the retained <b>osteophyte</b> is sufficient explanation of the pain, as not all patients with retained osteophytes are symptomatic. In fact, the literature shows that excised osteophytes can also recur over a period of time, without any symptoms. Therefore a retained <b>osteophyte</b> alone is probably not sufficient to cause symptoms. Case presentation We present a case of intermittent medial knee pain occurring post-primary total knee arthroplasty, in a patient who underwent several investigations over a period of 5 years. Radiographs showed an <b>osteophyte</b> in the postero-medial femur along with slight tibial component overhang which was normal for that knee implant design. The symptoms eventually settled with excision of only the <b>osteophyte,</b> without altering the tibial component. Conclusion A retained <b>osteophyte</b> alone, or tibial component overhang alone, did not seem to cause significant symptoms in our patient whose symptoms completely settled with excision of the <b>osteophyte</b> alone, without changing the tibial component. Therefore, it seems that the combination of retained <b>osteophyte</b> and tibial component overhang (tibia-femoral component size mismatch) are detrimental and therefore best avoided. This report also emphasises the importance of meticulous <b>osteophyte</b> excision and avoiding tibial component overhang during knee arthroplasty. </p...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{findings}} suggest that vertebral <b>osteophytes</b> increase {{the resistance of the}} spine to compression. However, the role of vertebral <b>osteophytes</b> on the biomechanical response of the spine under fast dynamic compression, up to failure, is unclear. Seventeen human spine specimens composed of three vertebrae (from T 5 -T 7 to T 11 -L 1) and their surrounding soft tissues were harvested from nine cadavers, aged 77 to 92 years. Specimens were imaged using quantitative computer tomography (QCT) for medical observation, classification of the intervertebral disc degeneration (Thomson grade) and measurement of the vertebral trabecular density (VTD), height and cross-sectional area. Specimens were divided into two groups (with (n = 9) or without (n = 8) substantial vertebral body <b>osteophytes)</b> and compressed axially at a dynamic displacement rate of 1 m/s, up to failure. Normalized force-displacement curves, videos and QCT images allowed characterizing failure parameters (force, displacement and energy at failure) and fracture patterns. Results were analyzed using chi-squared tests for sampling distributions and linear regression for correlations between VTD and failure parameters. Specimens with substantial vertebral body <b>osteophytes</b> present higher stiffness (2. 7 times on average) and force at failure (1. 8 times on average) than other segments. The presence of <b>osteophytes</b> significantly influences the location, pattern and type of fracture. VTD was a good predictor of the dynamic force and energy at failure for specimens without substantial <b>osteophytes.</b> This study also showed that vertebral body <b>osteophytes</b> provide a protective mechanism to the underlying vertebra against severe compression fractures...|$|R
40|$|An {{observation}} {{was conducted}} on 104 vertebral columns of Japanese subjects {{in an attempt to}} study the incidence of <b>osteophytes</b> and deformity with the advance of age. <b>Osteophytes</b> were classified into three types according to the direction of development as set forth by Rogers and the four categories according to the degree of development were applied. <b>Osteophytes</b> were already present in the second decade and an increase with the advance of age was recognized in all cases examined after the fifth decade. The highest frequency of <b>osteophytes</b> was seen on C 5 in the cervical spine, on Th 9 in the thoracic spine and L 4 in the lumbar spine.
