From there, the water is sent by tunnel to either the Caribou 1 (74 MW) or Caribou 2 (120 MW) powerhouses. Caribou 2 is favored because it is newer and more efficient. Their tailraces flow into Belden Reservoir. A portion of the water goes through the 1.3-MW Oak Flat Powerhouse, which is located at the bottom on Belden Dam. The rest goes to the 125-MW Belden Powerhouse by another tunnel. The water is then released into Rock Creek Reservoir. All of these powerhouse facilities are presently (2008) owned and operated by the Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E), a major investor-owned California utility.|$|E

50|$|The {{water of}} a deep {{reservoir}} in temperate climates typically stratifies with a large volume of cold, oxygen poor water in the hypolimnion. Analysis of temperature profiles from 11 large dams in the Murray Darling Basin (Australia) indicated differences between surface water and bottom water temperatures up to 16.7 degrees Celsius. If this water is released to maintain river flow, it can cause adverse impacts on the downstream ecosystem including fish populations. Under worse case conditions (such as when the reservoir is full or near full), the stored water is strongly stratified and large volumes of water are being released to the downstream river channel via bottom level outlets, depressed temperatures can be detected 250 - 350 kilometres downstream. The operators of Burrendong Dam on the Macquarie River (eastern Australia) are attempting to address thermal suppression by hanging a geotextile curtain around the existing <b>outlet</b> <b>tower</b> to force the selective release of surface water.|$|E

40|$|Having had {{imagined}} the heat recovery from exhaust {{air out of}} a compost bed, experiments for rising the temperature of water (medium fluid) by a packed column heating tower of counter flow-type were conducted. There was a considerably larger temperature rise of water (30 °C of the maximun), and a higher value of the heat recovery efficiency (72 % in average), as compared with those for the buried-tube-type heat extractor. Therefore, the proposed heat recovery system seemed likely to be valid. An overall volumetric coefficient of enthalpy transfer of the tower Ka depended only on the mass velocity of dry air G, and it was arranged by the experimental equation Ka= 27 G 0. 76 within the error of± 20 %. Assuming the linearity between the enthalpy and temperature of saturated air, approximate solutions of the temperature of water and the enthalpy of moist air in the tower were derived.

5000|$|The {{principal}} {{storage facility}} for the Milk River Project was initially {{intended to be}} a dam on the St. Mary Lakes (Upper St. Mary Lake in Glacier National Park and Lower St. Mary Lake just east of the park), but no suitable damsite could be found. The Sherburne Lakes in Swiftcurrent Valley were selected as an alternate site, with work beginning in 1914. Building material was borrowed from {{the upper end of the}} Sherburne Lakes. In order to expedite transportation of materials, a small tug boat and several barges were purchased for $1900 and hauled overland from Seattle to the project site. Work continued through 1915 and 1916. Swiftcurrent Creek was diverted through the dam's outlet works in April 1916. Work was hampered by delays from spring flooding. The <b>outlet</b> <b>tower</b> and gatehouse were built in 1917, together with the spillway. In October observations indicated that the spillway was being displaced by a slide originating in a hill to the north of the spillway. Drainage of lakes above the slide did not cure the problem. Work on the dam and its control works continued through 1918, but the spillway problems continued. Water storage began in 1919. Eventually the spillway walls and floor were built of wood timbers to allow for movement. Work was complete in 1921. As originally built, Lake Sherburne impounded [...] behind the 94 ft dam.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a mathematical model}} of a low approach open evaporative cooling tower {{for the production of}} high temperature indirect cooling water (14 - 16 °C) for use in building radiant cooling and displacement ventilation systems. There are several potential approaches to model evaporative cooling, including: the Poppe method, the Merkel method and the effectiveness-NTU (ε-NTU) method. A common assumption, applied to the Merkel and ε-NTU methods, is that the effect of change in tower water mass flow rate due to evaporation is ignored, which results in a simpler model with reduced computational requirements, but with somewhat decreasedaccuracy. In this paper, a new improved method, called the corrected ε-NTU approach is proposed, where the water loss due to evaporation is taken into account. It is expected by this correction the results of improved ε-NTU in the category of heat transfer will be more close to the results ofmore rigorous Poppe method. The current mathematical model is evaluated against experimental data reported for anumber of open tower configurations, subject to different water temperature and ambient boundary conditions. It is shown that the discrepancies between the calculated and experimental <b>tower</b> <b>outlet</b> temperatures are to within ± 0. 35 °Cfor a low temperature cooling water process (14 - 16 °C), subject to temperate climate ambient conditions and ± 0. 85 °C for a high temperature cooling water process (29 - 36 °C),subject to continental climate ambient conditions.

40|$|AbstractAn {{innovative}} {{system for}} recovering exhaust gas is created to recycle the energy from industry cooling tower waste. Two Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (VAWTs) with enclosure are positioned {{at a specific}} position at the <b>outlet</b> of cooling <b>tower</b> to harness the wind energy for electricity generation. From structural dynamics aspect, adding two VAWTs or dual-rotor with enclosure can contribute extra burden to the cooling tower. This has changed the dynamic characteristics of the cooling tower. Therefore, a hybrid non-destructive evaluation approach is proposed to investigate the dynamic behaviour and reliability of this new design. From this approach, {{it was found that}} the overall vibration of the cooling tower increased from 3 mm/s to 26 mm/s after the installation of the VAWTs with enclosure. The VAWTs are not operating at its optimum speed due to energy loss in vibration. The operating speed of VAWTs (i. e. 7. 5 Hz) was found close to one of the natural frequencies of VAWT (i. e. 7. 0 Hz). This indicates structural dynamic weakness which causes high vibration as recorded. Structural Dynamic Modification (SDM) is performed on the new design in the attempt to reduce the vibration at VAWTs and improve the reliability of VAWTs with enclosure in order to ensure optimum operation of VAWTs. The SDM is expected to shift the natural frequency away from the operating frequency with around 81 % of reduction in vibration level which leads it to safe and unrestricted long-term operation. In addition, reducing vibration at VAWTs also recovers the energy loss of 419 Joules and subsequently maximises the efficiency of wind turbine...|$|R
40|$|Cooling towers, {{among other}} equipments, {{could have an}} {{important}} atmospheric impact, becoming a source of pollutants or biological agents. The most important, due to its frequency and importance of the outbreaks, is Legionella. Since its discovery in 1976 in Philadelphia, where {{the total number of}} cases reached more than 200 of those more than 30 died, several outbreaks have been reported causing tens of deaths. The most important one due to its spread took place in the city of Murcia (Spain), in 2001, with more than 600 cases and where 23 out of 70 investigated cooling towers were positive to Legionella Pneumophila. In the present work, a validated numerical modelization using the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code ANSYS Fluent is employed to simulate the dispersion of the drift from the cooling tower causative of the outbreak in the real urban environment of Murcia in the days of highest emissions, which are located by means of the number of infections given by the epidemic curve. The results of the modelization are compared with the results of the epidemiological investigation carried out by the Epidemiology Service at the Consejería de Sanidad de Murcia. The main objective of this modelization is to predict a cooling tower influence area, what will help to reduce environmental and personal impact in case of an eventual infection of its water, or, as it is used in here, to improve the resources used to find the focus of infection after an outbreak has taken place. The modelization was previously validated using data from an experimental cooling tower installation. The data set that was measured includes cooling tower parameters such as water and air flow, inlet and outlet water and air temperature, atmospheric conditions (by means of a meteorological tower and meteorological station) but also droplet diameter at the cooling <b>tower</b> <b>outlet</b> and droplet deposition in the surroundings using the water sensitive paper technique.

40|$|NOVELTY - To coat fibers with an {{adhesive}}, the adhesive {{is applied}} while the fibers have a residual moisture content of at most 100 %. After {{the application of}} the adhesive, the fiber clumps are broken down. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - In an INDEPENDENT CLAIM, an assembly has a tower (4) which can be filled (18) and emptied (20). The adhesive is applied to the fibers in the tower through feeds (8) in the tower or its wall (6). A mechanism (22) to break down fiber clumps is at the <b>outlet</b> of the <b>tower.</b> Before application, the residual moisture content in the fibers is set by drying at at most 100 % and pref. 10 - 1 %. The fiber clumps are agitated in an air stream, giving turbulence which breaks them down in the air eddies. Or the glued fibers can be separated in a refiner or mill. The separated fibers are passed to a workstation to be formed into fiber materials. The fibers, in clumps or separated, can be fed to an intermediate store. The adhesive is applied to the fibers in a fiber/air stream mo ving at a speed of at most 150 m/s and pref. at most 50 m/s and especially at most 10 m/s, moving on a straight or a spiral path. The environment is controlled, in the application zone, to a given temperature and/or air humidity. The residual moisture content of the fibers can be varied while the fibers are being glued and/or separated. The adhesive glue is fed according to batches of fed fibers or fiber masses, or the vol. of delivered adhesive is set on a time scale. The adhesive is delivered by jets. The tower has a jet system (14) for the delivery of air or other gases into it, or through its walls, and also jets to generate air turbulence to eddy and/or advance the fibers. The tower is vertical, horizontal or at an angle, and is at least partially conical. The fiber clumps are broken down by a rotor, sieve, beating plate or the like, followed by winnowing where surplus air is diverted from the fiber/air stream for at least partial return to the tower after its temp. and/or humidi t y levels have been set. A control registers the fiber feed to set the volume of adhesive to be delivered by fiber batches or on a timed basis. The control system also sets the conditions of the environment within the tower according to the fiber moisture content and its mass, to give a temperature and/or humidity profile between the tower entry and exit. The consistency of the adhesive is adjusted according to the wetness and/or temperature of the fibers to be coated. USE - The method is for the preparation of wood fibers for use in fiberboards, and the like, where their adhesive coating gives a bond between them in the board structure. ADVANTAGE - The method reduces adhesive consumption, so that the fibers are effectively coated with minimum material and energy costs...|$|R
