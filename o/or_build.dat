5|$|Complex nests {{are built}} by many ant species, but other species are nomadic {{and do not}} build {{permanent}} structures. Ants may form subterranean nests <b>or</b> <b>build</b> them on trees. These nests {{may be found in}} the ground, under stones or logs, inside logs, hollow stems, or even acorns. The materials used for construction include soil and plant matter, and ants carefully select their nest sites; Temnothorax albipennis will avoid sites with dead ants, as these may indicate the presence of pests or disease. They are quick to abandon established nests {{at the first sign of}} threats.|$|E
5|$|Jewell's {{first order}} as Secretary, issued in October 2013, {{established}} {{a process for}} the Department of the Interior to offset large development projects with conservation efforts. The effort was an extension of existing programs that use fees for offshore drilling permits to expand <b>or</b> <b>build</b> parks. At the same time, Jewell publicly pledged to work with President Obama to preserve mountains and rivers, with or without Congressional action. Existing laws, such as the 1906 Antiquities Act, give the president broad authority to preserve land, a power Jewell indicated she and the President were prepared to use {{as part of a}} balanced approach between development and conservation.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{proposals}} to extend the O-Bahn to Golden Grove <b>or</b> <b>build</b> other routes, however none have progressed beyond consultation. An extension to Golden Grove would require the acquisition of extensive tracts of private property, due to the absence of an available corridor. Population increase in the area is negligible, although sprawl continues from Tea Tree Plaza Interchange for another eight kilometres to the Adelaide Hills. The current route was built with an allowance for a station at Grand Junction Road but it has not been built.|$|E

5|$|Malmö Stad, {{the city}} council, {{announced}} on 25 April 2005 {{its intention to}} either help the club renovate Malmö Stadion, <b>or</b> <b>build</b> a new stadium in the same area. Four days later, five different scenarios were laid out by the municipality: the first proposed {{the construction of an}} entirely new, football-specific stadium to the south of Malmö Stadion, while the second suggested the demolition of Malmö Stadion, and the erection of a new ground for football and athletics on the same site. The third, fourth, and fifth ideas all proposed the building of two stadiums, one for football and one for athletics, on various local plots. The municipality chose the first option on 3 December 2005: the new football ground would be built south of Malmö Stadion, with a capacity of 20,000 to 25,000, on a 399million kronor budget. Malmö Stadion, meanwhile, would be renovated into an athletics stadium for 50million kronor. Swedbank Stadion was completed in 2009. As of 2012, no renovation has been done on Malmö Stadion.|$|E
5|$|Team member Lucas Davis {{compiled}} {{the development}} tools and documentation for Anachronox and released them in August 2001. Four bug-fixing patches exist for Anachronox. Ion Storm {{created the first}} (1.01), which fixed the Windows 2000 buffer overrun crash and implemented other improvements such as taxi-cabs between distant points and enhanced save game functionality. Ion Storm released the first patch (1.01) on July 2, 2001. Joey Liaw set up a GeoCities website for reporting bugs and technical information after the game's release, and worked on a new patch in his spare time. The second patch (1.02, <b>or</b> <b>build</b> 44) was released in May 2003 and overhauls the save-game system and provides other important stability fixes. The third and fourth patches—1.02 (build 45), released September 2003, and 1.02 (build 46), released April 2004—are fan-made unofficial patches and fix {{most of the remaining}} bugs. Fans have translated the game into German and released a conversion patch. Level designer Rich Carlson released a scrapped secret level for Anachronox in February 2004 after finding it on an old floppy disk.|$|E
5|$|When all mission {{objectives}} are completed, the player {{is given the}} option to make a hyperspace jump to end the level. This may be postponed in order to gather more resources <b>or</b> <b>build</b> more ships. When the hyperspace jump is initiated, all fighters return to the mothership while larger ships line up next to it, and blue rectangles pass over the ships and teleport them to the next level. The player retains their fleet between levels, {{and the difficulty of}} each mission is adjusted to a small extent based on how many ships are in the player's fleet {{at the beginning of each}} level. In multiplayer games, the objective is typically to destroy the enemy motherships, though other battle-oriented victory conditions are available. The mothership is capable of movement, and as there are no levels, the research done at the research vessel follows a technology tree with each upgrade or ship design taking a set amount of time, rather than also being dependent on a plot point. Multiple maps are available, as are options to turn off the need to research technologies or fuel consumption for smaller ships.|$|E

5|$|In 2008, {{the club}} {{stated that they}} would either have to {{renovate}} Aspmyra for NOK200 million <b>or</b> <b>build</b> a new stadium elsewhere to remain competitive at a premiership level. Funding was proposed to be a mix of public and sponsor grants, including DA-funds. As part of the planning of a joint Norwegian and Swedish bid for the Euro 2016, Bodø Municipality and Bodø/Glimt proposed that Bodø could build a stadium at Rønvikjordene, {{in the northern part}} of the town. The plans were presented in late July 2008; the venue was planned to have a capacity for 30,000 to 35,000 spectators, but would be rebuilt after the tournament to seat 10,000 to 15,000. It was estimated that Bodø/Glimt would need a capacity for 10,000 to 15,000 spectators. In comparison, the population of Bodø was 46,049 in 2008. The new venue was estimated to cost NOK500 to 700 million and was largely proposed financed with DA-funds. Minister of Culture, Trond Giske, stated that at least one of the venues would have to be in Northern Norway to receive government support for an application. Aspmyra was planned used as a training pitch. Bodø was discarded for the Scandinavian bid, which ultimately was never sent to UEFA. For Aspmyra, the municipality has stated that they have the long-term option to purchase the real estate north of the pitch and can build a new stand there. Alternatively, an estimated NOK3 million can be used to demolish the stand and redevelop it as a commercial property.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} was constructed pursuant {{to an agreement}} between the General Services Administration (GSA) and Boston developer David Nassif, Sr. In July 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson began planning to unite various disparate transportation agencies into a new United States Department of Transportation. GSA (the property owner and manager for the U.S. federal government) began seeking to lease <b>or</b> <b>build</b> a structure to house the new agency in late 1965. Donald T. Kirwan, chief of GSA's leasing division, knew Nassif from a previous lease negotiation, and discussed with him the siting of a building and its size. Nassif approached the RLA on April 21, 1966, and asked to buy the newly razed block of land bounded by 6th, 7th, D, and E Streets SW. In May 1967, GSA {{sent a letter to}} Nassif advising him that it was likely to lease the entire structure he intended to build. The $5.9 million land purchase was finalized on October 30, 1967. The cost of the structure is unclear. On November 15, 1967, Nassif had secured a $39 million construction loan. But The Washington Post pegged the cost of the building at $27 million in July 1968. The newspaper said in August 1970 that the cost of the structure was $26.5 million. The {{building was}} designed by architect Edward Durrell Stone, who also designed the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. On April 11, 1968, GSA leased the entire building from Nassif for 20 years for $98 million. John A. Volpe Construction was the chief contractor.|$|E
