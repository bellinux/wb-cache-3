5|$|The {{introduction}} of deer to New Zealand {{began in the}} middle of the 19th century, and current populations are primarily European red deer, with only 15 percent being elk. There is significant hybridization of elk with the more numerous red deer to the extent that pure elk may no longer exist in the wild in New Zealand. These deer have had an adverse impact on forest regeneration of some plant species, as they consume more palatable species which are replaced with those that are less favored by the elk. The long-term impact will be an alteration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> plants and trees found, and in other animal and plant species dependent upon them. As in Chile and Argentina, the IUCN has declared that red deer and elk populations in New Zealand are an invasive species.|$|E
5|$|The {{soundtrack of}} Front Mission 3, the third {{game of the}} main series and the fifth game of the total series, was {{composed}} by Koji Hayama and Hayato Matsuo, with one track contributed by Shigeki. Matsuo handled the orchestral pieces, while Hayama worked on the techno ones. The pieces were performed with synthesizers that were designed to sound like higher-quality versions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> sounds used in the original Front Mission, rather than sounding more like the actual instruments they represented. Hayama worked for Square as an in-house composer prior to the game, and {{was the one who}} invited Matsuo, who was an independent composer, to meet the sound team and work on the game. An album of music from the game, titled Front Mission 3 Original Soundtrack, was released by DigiCube on September 22, 1999. The two-disc album has 47 tracks, is 2:30:00 long, and has a catalog number of SSCX-10035.|$|E

40|$|Leather is {{a natural}} {{material}} with many applications: automotive, domestic upholstery, buildings, aviation, maritime, personal safety, etc. For each of these sectors, fire behavior is a field of particular interest. Unfortunately, there are many testing methods and different flammability standards depending on material application and end use. Therefore, there are different ways <b>of</b> approaching <b>the</b> whole flammability issue. In this work, different approaches for analyzing <b>the</b> fire resistance <b>of</b> leather are examined: (i) influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> tannage, (ii) influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> leather, (iii) influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> retannage, (iv) influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> fatliquor, and (v) influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> flame retardants. <b>The</b> results indicate that leather presents natural fire resistance. However, <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> leather, <b>type</b> <b>of</b> tannage, retannage and fatliquor effect <b>the</b> flammability behavior <b>of</b> leather. In addition, <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> flame retardants slightly improves <b>the</b> smouldering properties <b>of</b> leather. Postprint (published version...|$|R
