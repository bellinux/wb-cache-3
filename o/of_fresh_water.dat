40|$|Background: Given the {{globally}} poor protection <b>of</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>waters</b> {{for their}} intrinsic ecological values, assessments {{are needed to}} determine how well <b>fresh</b> <b>waters</b> and supported fish species are incidentally protected within existing terrestrial protected-area networks, and to identify their vulnerability to human-induced disturbances.

Methodology and Results: We determined the distribution <b>of</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>waters</b> and fish diversity in the Wet Tropics of Queensland, Australia.

5|$|The icebergs' melting caused {{extensive}} amounts <b>of</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> to {{be added}} to the North Atlantic. Such inputs of cold and fresh water may well have altered the density-driven, thermohaline circulation patterns of the ocean, and often coincide with indications of global climate fluctuations.|$|E
5|$|With {{global warming}} causing glaciers and {{permafrost}} to melt rapidly and allowing {{a large amount}} <b>of</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> to flow into the oceans, there are concerns that if the amount <b>of</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> in the oceans reaches a critical point, {{there will be a}} disruption in the thermohaline circulation. Considering the blue whale's migratory patterns are based on ocean temperature, a disruption in this circulation, which moves warm and cold water around the world, would be likely to have an effect on their migration. The whales summer in the cool, high latitudes, where they feed in krill-abundant waters; they winter in warmer, low latitudes, where they mate and give birth.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the rocks}} beneath the city {{contained}} a vast reservoir <b>of</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>water,</b> {{known as the}} Trarza Lake, it is running out, owing to the large growth of the city. Engineers have warned it could run out by 2054, since it is not rain-fed, and is therefore non-renewable.

5|$|Russian {{scientist}} Peter Kropotkin {{first proposed}} the idea <b>of</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> under Antarctic ice sheets {{at the end}} of the 19th century. He theorized that the tremendous pressure exerted by the cumulative mass of thousands of vertical meters of ice could increase the temperature at the lowest portions of the ice sheet to the point where the ice would melt. Kropotkin's theory was further developed by Russian glaciologist I. A. Zotikov, who wrote his Ph.D. thesis on this subject in 1967.|$|E

5000|$|The Stony Creek Valley was {{originally}} settled in 1824 after {{the discovery of}} coal and due to the availability <b>of</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>waters</b> from Cold Springs.

The railroad was also used to bring tourists to the valley in search <b>of</b> <b>fresh</b> mineral <b>waters.</b> A 200 room resort was built at this time which later burnt down as the regions resources depleted. The towns that once rested along this stretch such as Rausch gap, now considered a ghost town, have long been gone.|$|R

5|$|Because {{mechanical}} refrigeration is energy intensive, active collectors {{are typically}} restricted {{to places where}} there is no supply of water that can be desalinated or purified at a lower cost and that are sufficiently far from a supply <b>of</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> to make transport uneconomical. Such circumstances are uncommon, and even then large installations such as that tried in the 1930s at Cook in South Australia failed because of the cost of running the installation – it was cheaper to transport water over large distances.|$|E

Canada stretches from the Atlantic Ocean in the east to the Pacific Ocean in the west; to the north lies the Arctic Ocean. Greenland is to the northeast. By total area (including its waters), Canada is the second-largest country in the world, after Russia. By land area alone, however, Canada ranks fourth, {{the difference being due}} to it having the world's largest proportion <b>of</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> lakes.|$|E
5|$|Contamination {{by water}} during filling {{may be due}} to two causes. Inadequate {{filtration}} and drying of the compressed air can introduce small quantities <b>of</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> condensate, or an emulsion of water and compressor lubricant, and failing to clear the cylinder valve orifice of water which may have dripped from wet dive gear, which can allow contamination by fresh or seawater. Both cause corrosion, but seawater contamination can cause a cylinder to corrode rapidly {{to the extent that it}} may be unsafe or condemned after even a fairly short period. This problem is exacerbated in hot climates, where chemical reactions are faster, and is more prevalent where filling staff are badly trained or overworked.|$|E
5|$|Every second, {{approximately}} 28 cubed {{meters of}} water {{flows into the}} bay. The exchange with the Gulf of Mexico occurs at Cedar Bayou and Aransas Pass. As {{a result of the}} seawater exchange, the bay's salinity is 15 parts per thousand, compared to the seawater average of 35 ppt. This discrepancy is brought about by the volume <b>of</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> that empties into the bay and its extensions, from Copano Creek, Mission River and Aransas River, forming the Mission-Aransas estuary. Fresh water flows also arrive from the impact of the Guadalupe River on San Antonio Bay. Combined, the fresh water influence is 60 to 70 percent of the system's volume, which is judged to be minimal.|$|E
