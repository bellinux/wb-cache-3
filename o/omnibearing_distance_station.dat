30|$|The {{comparison}} of the different simulation setups with a <b>station</b> <b>distance</b> of 7.5  km indicates, that the fuel consumption reduction achieved with the hybrid system increases with decreasing velocity. In these driving cycles the average fuel consumption simulated with a maximum speed of 140  km/h is 91.9 % compared to 89.8 % with a maximum speed of 120  km/h. Another important result is the correlation of fuel consumption reduction and <b>station</b> <b>distance.</b> Simulation setups 11, 12 and 13 refer to a <b>station</b> <b>distance</b> of 5  km. All simulated cases with the shorter <b>station</b> <b>distance</b> show a significant reduction of fuel consumption compared to the setups with corresponding maximum speed and 7.5  km <b>station</b> <b>distance.</b>|$|R

40|$|Bivariate mixed {{lognormal}} distribution is a probability model used for representing rainfalls behavior at two monitoring stations. The paper discuss on the parameter estimation for bivariate mixed {{lognormal distribution}} {{in which all}} parameters {{are assumed to be}} unknown. Six cases were considered in the analysis and the parameters were estimated using the maximum likelihood. The optimal model was selected based on the minimum Akaike’s information criterion (AIC) from selected model. The analysis is run by using the rainfall data observed for the time period of 33 years (1975 - 2007) from Arau, Perlis with each of the other 7 nearby monitoring stations and 5 far <b>distance</b> <b>stations.</b> Among the 7 stations studied, 6 stations (87. 5 %) choose the same case model (M 2) as the minimum AIC procedures.
