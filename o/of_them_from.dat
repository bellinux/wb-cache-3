30|$|The study {{participants}} comprised of 780 (48 %) male corps members and 846 (52 %) female corps members. Their {{ages ranged from}} 19  years to 30  years old with 44 (2.7 %) <b>of</b> <b>them</b> being below 20  years old, 594 (36.5 %) <b>of</b> <b>them</b> being between 20 and 23  years old, 664 (40.8 %) <b>of</b> <b>them</b> being between 24 and 26  years old and 324 (19.9 %) <b>of</b> <b>them</b> being between 27 and 30  years old.

5|$|Some locally-made items {{included}} prismatic obsidian blades and a polished nodule of iron pyrite {{for use as}} a mirror. Other {{items included}} weapons and instruments for navigation. A mariner's astrolabe is the oldest such instrument with a confirmed date. Pewter objects from England were found and stoneware from Cologne, Germany. In the end about 1,500 artifacts were retrieved from the San Esteban, 85% <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> the conglomerates.|$|E

5|$|According to Bakhos Assaf, {{mayor of}} Hardin, Lebanon, 93 {{passengers}} originated {{from what is}} today Lebanon, with 20 <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> Hardin, {{the highest number of}} any Lebanese location. Of the Hardin passengers, 11 adult men died, while eight women and children and one adult man survived. Kamal Seikaly, an individual quoted in an article from the Lebanese publication Daily Star, stated that according to a May 16, 1912 issue of the Al-Khawater magazine stored in the American University of Beirut, of the 125 Lebanese aboard, 23 survived. The magazine states that 10 people from Kfar Meshki died on the Titanic.|$|E

5|$|At least 120 drugs {{come from}} plant sources, many <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> {{the bark of}} trees. Quinine {{originates}} from the cinchona tree (Cinchona) and {{was for a long}} time the remedy of choice for the treatment of malaria. Aspirin was synthesised to replace the sodium salicylate derived from the bark of willow trees (Salix) which had unpleasant side effects. The anti-cancer drug Paclitaxel is derived from taxol, a substance found in the bark of the Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia). Other tree based drugs come from the paw-paw (Carica papaya), the cassia (Cassia spp.), the cocoa tree (Theobroma cacao), the tree of life (Camptotheca acuminata) and the downy birch (Betula pubescens).|$|E
5|$|Between 1952 and 1954, 398 armored {{vehicles}} were destroyed, 84% <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> mines and booby traps. Typically, the Viet Minh ambushed convoys by obstructing {{the road with}} a fallen tree or pile of boulders, and then destroying {{the first and last}} vehicles of the halted convoy with remote mines. Caltrops, mines and the steep cliff faces naturally found at the road side aided in funneling the target convoy into a small area, where machine guns, mortars and recoilless rifles were trained. Viet Minh Regiment 95 repeatedly deployed these tactics, inflicting severe losses on the French forces passing along Route One, which led to its French nickname of la rue sans joie ("the Street Without Joy"). Regiment 95 was, along with regiments 18 and 101, part of the Viet Minh Division 325, commanded by General Tran Quy Ha. The division was formed in 1951 from pre-existing units in Thừa Thiên just north of Route One, and became operational in the summer of 1952.|$|E
5|$|By World War I, all of {{the major}} powers were experimenting with {{aircraft}} mounted cannon; however their low rate of fire and great size and weight precluded any <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> being anything other than experimental. The most successful (or least unsuccessful) was the SPAD 12 Ca.1 with a single 37mm Puteaux mounted to fire between the cylinder banks and through the propeller boss of the aircraft's Hispano-Suiza 8C. The pilot (by necessity an ace) had to manually reload each round.|$|E

5|$|Citizen Kane eschews the {{traditional}} linear, chronological narrative, and tells Kane's story entirely in flashback using {{different points of}} view, many <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> Kane's aged and forgetful associates, the cinematic equivalent of the unreliable narrator in literature. Welles also dispenses {{with the idea of}} a single storyteller and uses multiple narrators to recount Kane's life. The use of multiple narrators was unheard of in Hollywood films. Each narrator recounts a different part of Kane's life, with each story partly overlapping. The film depicts Kane as an enigma, a complicated man who, in the end, leaves viewers with more questions than answers as to his character, such as the newsreel footage where he is attacked for being both a communist and a fascist.|$|E
5|$|Deinosuchus {{was present}} {{on both sides}} of the Western Interior Seaway. Specimens have been {{described}} from 10 U.S. states: Utah, Montana, Wyoming, New Mexico, New Jersey, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Texas, and North Carolina. David Schwimmer has said Deinosuchus fossils have been found in South Carolina and Delaware as well, but none <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> those two states have been formally described. A Deinosuchus osteoderm from the San Carlos Formation was also reported in 2006, so the giant crocodilian's range may have included parts of northern Mexico. Deinosuchus fossils are most abundant in the Gulf Coastal Plain region of Georgia, near the Alabama border. All known specimens of Deinosuchus were found in rocks dated to the Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous period. The oldest examples of this genus lived approximately 82 Ma, and the youngest lived around 73Ma.|$|E
5|$|During her reign, Anne favoured {{moderate}} Tory politicians, {{who were}} more likely to share her Anglican religious views than their opponents, the Whigs. The Whigs grew more powerful {{during the course of the}} War of the Spanish Succession, until 1710 when Anne dismissed many <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> office. Her close friendship with Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough, turned sour as the result of political differences. The Duchess took revenge in an unflattering description of the Queen in her memoirs, which was widely accepted by historians until Anne was re-assessed in the late 20th-century.|$|E

5|$|Elmer {{recounts the}} initial violent {{backlash}} by humanity and how Ben hid the three <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> groups out to kill chickens. This {{is followed by}} retaliation against humans by chickens, chicken-rights groups, and eventually recognition of chickens as humans by the United Nations. During this time, Elmer becomes a syndicated columnist in a newspaper and writes about chicken-related topics, both light-hearted and serious. The peace between humans and chickens is disrupted in the late 1980s by an outbreak of bird flu. Millions of healthy chickens are killed by humans {{to prevent the spread}} of the disease, and Ben hides Elmer and Helen again. When others come for them, Ben intervenes and is accidentally shot protecting Elmer. Once the flu is contained, humanity expresses regret for its rash actions and Elmer writes a scathing editorial about the panic. His journal entries become less frequent after he and Helen have children.|$|E
5|$|Following the club's successes, a new stand {{was erected}} along the Walton Breck Road {{end of the}} ground. The stand {{became known as the}} Spion Kop – it was {{originally}} given this name by local journalist Ernest Edwards, the sports editor of the Liverpool Daily Post and the Echo, after a famous hill in South Africa, where a local regiment had suffered heavy losses during the Boer War. More than 300men had died, many <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> Liverpool, as the British army attempted to capture the strategic hilltop.|$|E
5|$|For the American forces, abuses were {{typically}} either a disproportionate use of firepower or servicemen committing extrajudicial killings (such as in Haditha). Many accusations {{of human rights}} violations against the United States were connected with the First and Second Battles of Fallujah. Following the assault, the United States military admitted it had employed white phosphorus artillery rounds, the use of which is not permitted in civilian areas under the United Nations Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons. Several Marines, all <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> the 3rd Battalion 1st Marines, were later charged (but not convicted) with executing Iraqi prisoners. Some British advisers also complained that the Marines had little regard for civilian casualties and had used munitions containing depleted uranium that caused birth defects for years after the battle.|$|E

5|$|Hancock was {{put forth}} as a {{candidate}} in the 1789 U. S. presidential election. As was the custom in an era where political ambition was viewed with suspicion, Hancock did not campaign or even publicly express interest in the office; he instead made his wishes known indirectly. Like everyone else, Hancock knew that George Washington {{was going to be}} elected as the first president, but Hancock may have been interested in being vice president, despite his poor health. Hancock received only four electoral votes in the election, however, none <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> his home state; the Massachusetts electors all voted for another Massachusetts native, John Adams, who received the second-highest number of electoral votes and thus became vice president. Although Hancock was disappointed with his performance in the election, he continued to be popular in Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Olivia was {{considered}} the worst hurricane to hit Mazatlán, Sinaloa since 1943, {{in addition to being}} the strongest landfalling and costliest hurricane of the 1975 Pacific hurricane season. Olivia formed on October22 to the south of Mexico, quickly intensifying into a tropical storm. The storm moved northwestward initially, followed by a northeast turn. On October23, Olivia attained hurricane status, and the next day reached Category3 intensity on the Saffir-Simpson scale just before moving ashore Mazatlán in northwest Mexico. Olivia destroyed 7,000houses in the region, leaving 30,000people homeless, and damage totaled $20million (1975USD, $ USD). The hurricane killed 30people, 20 <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> drowning in shrimp boats.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, the {{historian}} Boris Rybakov, while analysing miniatures of ancient Russian chronicles, {{pointed out that}} most <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> <b>from</b> the thirteenth century onward, display churches with onion domes rather than helmet domes. Nikolay Voronin, the foremost authority on pre-Mongol Russian architecture, seconded his opinion that onion domes existed in Russia {{as early as the}} thirteenth century, although they presumably could not be widespread. These findings demonstrated that Russian onion domes could not be imported from the Orient, where onion domes did not replace spherical domes until the fifteenth century.|$|E
