40|$|A new {{synthesis}} of carboxin la and its 4, 4 -dioxide derivative, <b>oxycarboxin</b> 2 a, has been devised via N-bromosuccinimide-promoted oxidative rearrangement of acetoacetanilide 1, 3 - 0 xathiolane 3. The replacement of N-bromosuccinimide with molecular bromine {{leads to the}} formation, from compound 3, of a C- 2 bromomethylcarboxin derivative lb. The latter is conveniently exploited to prepare {{a new class of}} carboxins and oxycarboxins (after oxidation of the sulfur) substituted at the C- 2 methyl, by replacement of the bromine atom with various nucleophiles...|$|E
40|$|The {{sustainable}} {{expansion of}} bean cultivations requires technologies {{that do not}} limit their phyto-recovering properties. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} study was to propose agronomic management of conservation for bean cultivation considering the microbiological characteristics of two mega-environments of the Colombian Caribbean coast and the compatibility between agrochemicals and bioinputs. The methodology included rhizospheric microbe population counts, identification of phytopathogenic fungi in plant tissues and soils, compatibility studies of pesticides with biocontrollers, and determination of residual contents of pesticides in bean seeds. The microbial populations corresponded to those previously registered for the lower tropics, but with quantitative differences in the genera. Phytophthora, Colletotrichum and Fusarium were registered in the humid Caribbean, while Colletotrichum and Curvularia affected crops in the dry Caribbean. The Beauveria bioinput was not compatible with the evaluated agrochemicals, while Trichoderma was compatible with chlorpyrifos, thiabendazole and <b>oxycarboxin.</b> Metarhizium was compatible with glyphosate and <b>oxycarboxin</b> at 10 % of the recommended dose. Lindane residues were found in the beans harvested at three of the studied locations. The combined use of agrochemicals and bioinputs on bean crops is feasible as long as the time of application of the latter is made according to the half-life of the chemical and the organic matter content of the soil is increased...|$|E
40|$|The {{systemic}} fungicide carboxin (5, 6 -dihydro- 2 -methyl- 1, 4 -oxathiin- 3 -carboxanilide) inhibited oxidation of succinate by membranes prepared from Micrococcus denitrificans, the Ki being 16 μM. <b>Oxycarboxin</b> (5, 6 -dihydro- 2 -methyl- 1, 4 -oxathiin- 3 -carboxanilide- 4, 4 -dioxide), F 831 (5, 6 -dihydro- 2 -methyl- 1, 4 -oxathiin- 3 -carboxanilide- 4 -oxide), {{and another}} succinate oxidase inhibitor, 4, 4, 4 -trifluoro- 1 -(2 -thienyl) - 1, 3 -butanedione (TTB) were less effective inhibitors of succinate oxidation by membranes of M. denitrificans. Oxidation of other substrates (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, reduced form, d-lactate, l-lactate, malate, and d,l-α-hydroxybutyrate) was inhibited {{to a lesser}} degree by carboxin, and formate oxidation was entirely resistant. With all substrates tested, <b>oxycarboxin,</b> the dioxide analogue of carboxin, was less effective than carboxin. Carboxin also inhibited dichlorophenol indophenol (DCIP) reductase activities by these membranes in a manner both qualitatively and quantitatively similar to the inhibition of oxidation of the various substrates. The inhibition of DCIP reductase activities by TTB was qualitatively similar to carboxin, but TTB was a less effective inhibitor with all substrates tested. The inhibition of DCIP reductase by carboxin could be relieved by phenazine methosulfate with all substrates except d-lactate. Only slight inhibition of d-lactate-stimulated uptake of [14 C]glycine by these membrane vesicles was seen with carboxin. Uptake of [14 C]glycine could be stimulated to varying degrees with the other substrates tested, but in no case did carboxin cause significant inhibition. Membranes isolated from M. denitrificans are a useful system for investigating the mechanism of inhibition of electron transport function by carboxin, and the use of this system for evaluations of carboxin and its metabolites is suggested...|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effectiveness of some fungicides such as Dithane M- 45 (mancozeb) - 0. 3 %, Plantvax (<b>oxycarboxin)</b> - 0. 075 %, Saprol (triforine) - 0. 1 %, Calirus (benodanil) - 0. 3 %, Bayleton 5 WP (triadimefon) - 0. 05 %, Baycor (biloxazol) - 0. 1 %, Vigilex (dichlobutrazol) - 0. 04 % in the control of chrysanthemum white rust (Puccinia horiana). Tests were conducted in the period 1979 - 1980. Plants of four varieties were sprayed 8 times weekly. The disease was completely suppressed in the combinations with Plantvax, Saprol, Calirus, Bayleton 5 WP, Baycor and Vigilex. The disease index of Puccinia horiana infection on chrysanthemums was only slightly lower when Dithane M- 45 was applied. Plantvax was phytotoxic for all tested varieties, Vigilex suppressed plant growth, treated plants were 3 / 4 shorter in comparison with plants of all the other combinations...|$|E
40|$|Although rust (caused by Puccinia purpurea) is {{a common}} disease in Australian grain sorghum crops, {{particularly}} late in the growing season (April onwards), its potential to reduce yield has not been quantified. Field trials were conducted in Queensland between 2003 and 2005 to evaluate the effect of sorghum rust on grain yield of two susceptible sorghum hybrids (Tx 610 and Pride). Rust was managed from 28 - 35 days after sowing until physiological maturity by applying <b>oxycarboxin</b> (1 kg active ingredient/ 100 L of water/ha) every 10 days. When data were combined for the hybrids, yield losses ranged from 13. 1 % in 2005 to 3. 2 % in 2003 but differences in yield the between sprayed and unsprayed treatments were statistically significant (P a parts per thousand currency signaEuro parts per thousand 0. 05) only in 2005. Final area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) values reflected the yield losses in each year. The higher yield loss in 2005 can be attributed primarily to the early development of the rust epidemic and the higher inoculum levels in spreader plots {{at the time of}} planting of the trials...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{fungicides}} {{remains the}} most important tool to Asian soybean rust (ASR) control in Brazil. The reduction of the Phakopsora pachyrhizi sensibility to triazols changed the strategy to the exclusive use of fungicides to strobilurines with triazols premix formulations. Two field trials of the Brazilian network for ASR chemical control were conducted in Goiania and Senador Canedo at Goias State in order to compare the efficacy of 17 fungicides on ASR control. The treatments were composed by two triazols, one strobilurine, one carboxanilide, and 13 premix formulations of strobilurine + triazol. The fungicides were applied twice, beginning at soybean growth stage R 1 in absence of ASR symptoms (preventatively), and 21 days after first spray. The soybean cultivars were BRS 8160 RR in Goiania and BRS Valiosa RR in Senador Canedo. The area under disease progress curve (AUDPC) was calculated for each treatment based on four ASR severity evaluations from R 1 to R 7 soybean growth stages. The lower AUDPC and higher soybean yield were observed for almost all fungicides in premix formulations of strobilurine with triazols. The carboxanilide <b>oxycarboxin</b> and the triazols tebuconazole and cyproconazole were not so efficient on ASR control. The lowest reductions of soybean cycle due to ASR were observed with picoxystrobin + tebuconazole, which were 12 days later {{in relation to the}} untreated plots in Goiania and 10 days later in Senador Canedo. 201...|$|E
