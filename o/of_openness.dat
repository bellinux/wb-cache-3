40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{investigation}} is to analyze information openness municipal education system, identify problems and develop practical recommendations in dealing with them.   Methods. The conducted study {{is based on the}} methodology of the social audit, which includes the content analysis of the official websites of educational institutions in the network «Internet», the diagnosis of awareness among parents about the schools activities, expert assessment <b>of</b> informational <b>openness</b> <b>of</b> schools and the development of practical recommendations for improving information schools transparency. Research methods involve: description, analysis of documents, questionnaires, expert interviews, analysis of statistical data.   Results. The article presents the results of a social audit <b>of</b> information <b>openness</b> <b>of</b> the municipal General educational system of Pervouralsk city district. The analysis of the content of the official websites of educational organizations in the network «Internet» was conducted at the first stage of social audit. It showed that only one school website fully complies with the proposed requirements. The best developed parameter of website is technological effectiveness; less developed – the communicativeness and multimedia. Diagnostics of awareness among parents of the pupils of the schools activities was conducted at the second stage of the social audit. A survey of parents has shown that the most popular are the traditional ways of obtaining information: teacher-parent meetings and communication with child. Less than half of parents receive information via the websites of the schools. Expert assessment <b>of</b> the information <b>openness</b> <b>of</b> schools was realized at the third stage. Practical recommendations on improvement <b>of</b> information <b>openness</b> <b>of</b> schools have been developed at the fourth stage.   Scientific novelty. A new scientific idea of social audit <b>of</b> information <b>openness</b> municipal education system was set {{on the basis of the}} authors’ research that enriches the scientific concept of social audit. Authors have developed a new diagnostic technique that will reveal the state <b>of</b> information <b>openness</b> <b>of</b> municipal education system; proved promising use of social auditing techniques in the practice of evaluation <b>of</b> information <b>openness</b> <b>of</b> the municipal education system.   Practical significance. The implications of the research findings prove that the authors of the given paper have developed and tested the diagnostic methods of the social audit <b>of</b> information <b>openness</b> <b>of</b> the municipal education system. The research results demonstrate the prospects of the practical use of the theory of social audit in practice; and the practical recommendations for further improvement <b>of</b> information <b>openness</b> <b>of</b> the municipal education system. The results of the study can be used in the activities of the Department of education Pervouralsk city district and other municipalities, as well as heads of educational organizations can use {{the investigation}} data to improve information <b>openness</b> <b>of</b> the municipal education system.   </p...|$|R

Until (at least) the successful passage of Michigan's medical marijuana law, the event had arguably strayed from its initial intent, although for years, a number of attendees have received serious legal responses due to marijuana use on University of Michigan property, which does not fall under the city's progressive and compassionate ticketing program.|$|E
5|$|The code of Mongol law, {{known as}} the Yassa ("Great Law"), decreed strict rules and punishments {{in many areas of}} the Mongolian Empire's society, {{especially}} those areas concerning trade and commerce. The Yassa helped suppress the traditional causes of tribal feuding and war, thus helping to ensure a peaceful trading and travelling environment; theft and animal rustling were outlawed, and the Mongol Empire under Genghis Khan even established a massive lost-and-found system. Harsh penalties including a retribution of nine times the original value of stolen goods helped deter theft on Mongol roads. The Yassa also decreed complete religious freedom, ensuring that Buddhists, Muslims, Christians, etc., were all allowed to travel freely throughout the empire; religious leaders were also exempted from taxation, as were doctors, lawyers, undertakers, teachers, and scholars. The Yassa did allow for flexibility and it usually adapted, absorbed, or built upon legal systems in remote parts of the empire, thus maintaining a level <b>of</b> <b>openness</b> to various societies and ensuring peace and stability.|$|E

The effect <b>of</b> trade <b>openness</b> on the gender wage gap remained observable in later years (1980, 1990 and 2000), although it decreased in degree over time.

The introduction of domestic financial frictions makes the volatility patterns flatter. Our model explains the lack of empirical evidence on the linkage between financial openness and macro volatility.
