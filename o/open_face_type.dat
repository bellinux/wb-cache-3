40|$|To {{test the}} null {{hypothesis}} {{that there are no}} correlations between the morphology of the upper jaw, the position of the upper incisors, and facial type. From a sample of 191 patients, the FMA angle was used to select 20 short <b>face</b> <b>type,</b> 20 norm <b>face</b> <b>type,</b> and 20 long <b>face</b> <b>type</b> patients, aged 12 to 40 years. Using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), tomography was carried out on sagittal sections corresponding to the four upper incisors. Some parameters defining the dentoskeletal relationships, the alveolar thickness, the alveolar height, and the dental movement were measured. The measurements were processed using analysis of variance and Tukey's test. At the upper central incisors, short <b>face</b> <b>type</b> patients presented a greater alveolar bone thickness than long <b>face</b> <b>type</b> patients. In short <b>face</b> <b>type</b> and norm <b>face</b> <b>type</b> subjects the root apex of the upper incisors was farther away from the lingual cortex than in the long <b>face</b> <b>type</b> patients. At the central incisors the alveolar thickness was greater and the lingual cortex was higher with respect to the lateral incisors in all three facial types. At the upper incisors, facial type is statistically significantly correlated with both alveolar bone thickness and distance between the root apex and lingual cortex...|$|R
40|$|Scholars, connoisseurs, art {{lovers and}} {{even people who}} do not {{particularly}} like art, may recognise a Madonna by Leonardo da Vinci because her face reminds them of the Mona Lisa. This effect is caused by the presence of face types; faces that share the same ‘air’, as if they belong to siblings. <b>Face</b> <b>types</b> are omnipresent in art history. They transcend the boundaries of time, genre and style. Nevertheless, except in a brief essay by E. H. Gombrich, the topic has not been subjected to systematic art historical study. In this thesis, the phenomenon is explored from three major angles. Firstly, by focussing on the neuropsychological principles of face perception and face recognition, clues are uncovered for perceiving and recognising <b>face</b> <b>types</b> in art. Secondly, the role of <b>face</b> <b>types</b> in attribution processes is explored. Interestingly, connoisseurs appear to have made ample use of the presence of <b>face</b> <b>types,</b> but they have not credited it as a method. As part of a first attempt to rationalise the use of <b>face</b> <b>types</b> as an art historical method, two tests have been initiated for this thesis: a pilot in which participants graded face recognition in painting, and a computer based <b>face</b> <b>type</b> recognition test. The third and final part of the thesis explores how <b>face</b> <b>types</b> emerge and evolve and how they are transmitted. The angle of <b>face</b> <b>types</b> in workshop practices uncovers how the life span of a <b>face</b> <b>type</b> is influenced by changing artistic demands as well as by cultural and professional exposure to certain <b>face</b> <b>types.</b> The focus in this exploration is on examples from Early Netherlandish and Netherlandish renaissance painting...|$|R

A total of 162 samples were collected. The study of particle size distribution by cascade impactor indicated that the particles smaller than 4. 7 and 11 comprise about 13 % and 30 % of biology total dust respectively and therefore about 70 % of particles are greater than 11. The 7 -Hole gave a higher dust concentration measurement than <b>open</b> <b>face</b> and close face filter cassettes, in all processes, P 11, compared to the <b>open</b> <b>face</b> and close <b>face</b> filter cassettes. <b>Open</b> <b>face</b> and close face filter which were expected to give equivalent results measured statistically equivalent dust concentrations...|$|R

5000|$|The {{use of a}} 3-bevel (Quinke) needles {{is highly}} {{associated}} with PDPH as the geometry of the needle can create a [...] "flap" [...] that allows CSF leakage when inserted in standard horizontal position (<b>open</b> <b>face</b> of needle cephalad). Inserting the needle vertically (<b>open</b> <b>face</b> directed left or right) splits the dural fibers and reduced the flap size. However older clinicians advocate completely inverting the needle and inserting horizontally but upside down so the <b>open</b> <b>face</b> of the Quinke is directed caudad. This also creates a flap but the geometry is inverted so that the flap is {{on the inside of}} the dura and is forced closed by hydrostatic pressure. The incidence of PDPD using a Quinke needle in standard orientation is approximately 3%-7%, Approximately 1.5%-3% when inserted vertically; Approximately 0.1% when inserted inverted.|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} Art Gallery Problem for face guards in {{polyhedral}} environments. The {{problem can be}} infor-mally stated as: how many (not necessarily convex) windows should we place on the external walls of a dark building, in order to completely illuminate it? We consider both closed and <b>open</b> <b>face</b> guards (i. e., faces with or without their boundary), and we give some {{upper and lower bounds}} on the minimum number of faces required to guard a given polyhedron, in terms {{of the total number of}} its faces, f. In some notable cases, our bounds are tight: bf/ 6 c <b>open</b> <b>face</b> guards for orthogonal polyhedra, and bf/ 4 c <b>open</b> <b>face</b> guards for 4 -oriented polyhedra (i. e., polyhedra whose faces have only four different orientations). Then we show that it is NP-hard to approximate the minimum number of (closed or <b>open)</b> <b>face</b> guards within a factor of Ω(log f), even for polyhedra that are orthogonal and simply connected. Along the way we discuss some applications, arguing that face guards are not a reasonable model for guards patrolling on the surface of a polyhedron. ...|$|R
