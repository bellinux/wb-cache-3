5|$|Paleontologists {{have long}} {{classified}} Alioramus within the superfamily Tyrannosauroidea, but because its remains were {{for many years}} poorly known, a more precise classification had remained elusive until the discovery of A. altai. A cladistic analysis published in 2003 found Alioramus could be further classified into the family Tyrannosauridae and the subfamily Tyrannosaurinae, alongside Tyrannosaurus, Tarbosaurus and Daspletosaurus. A 2004 study supported this result but suggested it was equally probable that Alioramus belonged <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> Tyrannosauridae entirely, with its supposed juvenile characters actually reflecting a more basal position within Tyrannosauroidea. Another study omitted Alioramus altogether due to the only specimen's fragmentary nature. The discovery of A. altai in 2009 confirmed {{the placement of the}} genus within the Tyrannosaurinae.|$|E
5|$|As {{families}} have {{no means of}} preserving their music, or recording it, their creations are often forgotten owing {{to the absence of}} family members interested in ensuring their survival. The situation has been compounded by rules forbidding their support from <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> environment. Concerned that the musical traditions of the country were vanishing, in 2006, Malouma urged the government to create a school to preserve the country's music heritage, even introducing a measure to Parliament. In 2011, she created the Malouma Foundation in support of the preservation of the national musical heritage. The foundation aims to protect and preserve the Arab, African, and Berber roots of music in Mauritania and, to that end, is collecting and storing music from throughout the country to both preserve it and make it available for other uses, including education. Long concerned that the Moorish music traditions of her country were being replaced by the Malian and Moroccan music preferred by younger people, in 2014, she created a Mauritanian Music Festival.|$|E

25|$|Although parents {{treat their}} {{children}} differently, such differential treatment explains {{only a small}} amount of nonshared environmental influence.

25|$|Children can {{experience}} grief {{as a result}} of losses due to causes other than death. For example, children who have been physically, psychologically and/or sexually abused often grieve over the damage to, or loss of, their ability to trust. Since such children usually have no support or acknowledgement from any source <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> unit, this is likely to be experienced as disenfranchised grief.|$|E

25|$|Several {{factors are}} found to modify the {{negative}} effects of adverse life situations. Many studies show that the primary factor is to have relationships that provide care and support, create love and trust, and offer encouragement, both within and <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>family.</b> Additional factors are also associated with resilience, like the capacity to make realistic plans, having self-confidence and a positive self image, developing communications skills, and the capacity to manage strong feelings and impulses.|$|E

25|$|Kelly Bundy (Christina Applegate)—the Bundys' firstborn; a stereotypical dumb blonde who {{is often}} derided as {{promiscuous}} and dates men who get under Al's skin {{to the point}} of him physically assaulting them. Her stupidity manifests in many ways, from forgetting ideas on the spot to mispronouncing or misspelling simple words. Like her mother, she is quick to steal Al's money for expensive things.

25|$|Compared to children, {{adolescents}} {{are more likely}} to question others' assertions, and less likely to accept facts as absolute truths. Through experience <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> circle, they learn that rules they were taught as absolute are in fact relativistic. They begin to differentiate between rules instituted out of common sense—not touching a hot stove—and those that are based on culturally-relative standards (codes of etiquette, not dating until a certain age), a delineation that younger children do not make. This can lead to a period of questioning authority in all domains.|$|E
25|$|In 1949, a granddaughter sold Heinrich Lienhard’s {{manuscript}} to the Bancroft Library in Berkeley, California, {{where it}} is accessible in its original form {{as well as on}} microfilm. Yet it had already awakened the interest of people <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> in Lienhard’s own lifetime. The first to deal with the text was Kaspar Leemann, a friend from Lienhard’s days in Kilchberg (1850–54), whose edition was published in 1898, a reprint in 1900. However, Leemann’s version contains many errors of transcription, substantial omissions, changes and additions, so that the original is often barely recognizable. Lienhard, then approaching his eighties, was deeply disappointed as notes in the margins of his personal copy reveal.|$|E

25|$|At {{the age of}} six, Franz {{began to}} receive regular {{instruction}} from his father, {{and a year later}} was enrolled at his father's school. His formal musical education started around the same time. His father taught him basic violin technique, and his brother Ignaz gave him piano lessons. Aged seven, he was given his first lessons <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> by Michael Holzer, organist and choirmaster of the local parish church in Lichtental; the lessons may have largely consisted of conversations and expressions of admiration. The boy seemed to gain more from an acquaintance with a friendly joiner's apprentice who took him to a neighbouring pianoforte warehouse where Franz could practice on better instruments. He also played viola in the family string quartet, with brothers Ferdinand and Ignaz on first and second violin and his father on the cello. Franz wrote his earliest string quartets for this ensemble.|$|E
25|$|Kathakali has {{traditionally}} been an art that has continued {{from one generation to}} the next through a guru-disciples (gurukkula) based training system. Artist families tended to pick promising talent from within their own extended families, sometimes from <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>family,</b> and the new budding artist typically stayed with his guru as a student and treated like a member of the family. The guru provided both the theoretical and practical training to the student, and the disciple would accompany the guru to formal performances. In modern times, professional schools train students of Kathakali, with some such as those in Trivandrum Margi school emphasizing a single teacher for various courses, while others such as the Kerala Kalamandalam school wherein students learn subjects from different teachers. Kathakali schools are now found all over India, as well as in parts of the Western Europe and the United States.|$|E
25|$|According to the Bible, by the 9th century BC, the Kingdom of Israel, once united under Solomon, {{was divided}} into the {{northern}} Kingdom of Israel and southern Kingdom of Judah, which retained the historical capital of Jerusalem along with its Temple. However, scholars today are divided {{as to whether the}} united Kingdom under Solomon ever existed. Omri, King of Israel, continued policies dating from the reign of Jeroboam, contrary to religious law, that were intended to reorient religious focus away from Jerusalem: encouraging the building of local temple altars for sacrifices, appointing priests from <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> of the Levites, and allowing or encouraging temples dedicated to Baal, an important deity in ancient Canaanite religion. Omri achieved domestic security with a marriage alliance between his son Ahab and princess Jezebel, a priestess of Baal and the daughter of the king of Sidon in Phoenicia. These solutions brought security and economic prosperity to Israel for a time, but did not bring peace with the Israelite prophets, who were interested in a strict deuteronomic interpretation of the religious law.|$|E

500|$|Early in 1925, Disney {{hired an}} ink artist, Lillian Bounds. They married in July of that year. The {{marriage}} was generally happy, according to Lillian, although according to Disney's biographer Neal Gabler {{she did not}} [...] "accept Walt's decisions meekly or his status unquestionably, and she admitted that he was always telling people 'how henpecked he is'." [...] Lillian {{had little interest in}} films or the Hollywood social scene and she was, {{in the words of the}} historian Steven Watts, [...] "content with household management and providing support for her husband". Their marriage produced two daughters, Diane (born December 1933) and Sharon (adopted in December 1936, born six weeks previously). Within the family, neither Disney nor his wife hid the fact Sharon had been adopted, although they became annoyed if people <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> raised the point. The Disneys were careful to keep their daughters out of the public eye as much as possible, particularly in the light of the Lindbergh kidnapping; Disney took steps to ensure his daughters were not photographed by the press.|$|E
500|$|The comic {{efficacy}} of Homer's personality lies in his frequent bouts of bumbling stupidity and laziness, and his explosive anger. He {{has a low}} intelligence level and is described by director David Silverman as [...] "creatively brilliant in his stupidity". Homer also shows immense apathy towards work, is overweight, and [...] "is devoted to his stomach". His short attention span is evidenced by his impulsive decisions to engage in various hobbies and enterprises, only to [...] "change ... his mind when things go badly". Homer often spends his evenings drinking Duff Beer at Moe's Tavern, and was shown in the episode [...] "Duffless" [...] (season four, 1993) as a full-blown alcoholic. He is very envious of his neighbors, Ned Flanders and his family, and is easily enraged by Bart. Homer will often strangle Bart on impulse in a cartoonish manner. The first instance of Homer strangling Bart was in the short [...] "Family Portrait". According to Matt Groening, the rule was that Homer could only strangle Bart impulsively, never with pre-meditation, because doing so [...] "seems sadistic. If we keep it that he's ruled by his impulses, then he can easily switch impulses. So, even though he impulsively wants to strangle Bart, he also gives up fairly easily." [...] Another of the original ideas entertained by Groening was that Homer would [...] "always get his comeuppance or Bart had to strangle him back", but this was dropped. Homer shows no compunction about expressing his rage, and does not attempt to hide his actions from people <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>family.</b>|$|E
