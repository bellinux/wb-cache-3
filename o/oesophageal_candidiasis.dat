40|$|Background: Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) {{infected}} patient frequently report upper gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms; however their {{prevalence and}} diagnostic {{approach is not}} well known. Objective: The objective {{of this study was}} to study clinical, endoscopic and histopathological changes in HIV infected patients with upper GI symptoms and their correlation with CD 4 count. Materials and methods: We evaluated 50 HIV infected patients who presented to M. S. Ramaiah hospital with upper GI symptoms. All patients answered questionnaire assessing upper GI symptoms and underwent upper GI endoscopy. Mucosal biopsy was taken wherever mucosal abnormality seen. Results: In our study, the mean age of patients was 40. 98 yrs, of which 80 % were males. Vomiting (36 %), epigastric pain (36 %), weight loss (34 %) and anorexia (34 %) were the predominant symptoms. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) findings revealed- <b>Oesophageal</b> <b>candidiasis</b> in 28. 0 %, esophagitis in 22. 0 %, gastritis in 20. 0 %, duodenitis in 14 %, normal upper GI mucosa in 18 % patients. <b>Oesophageal</b> <b>candidiasis</b> was the most common finding on histopathological examination and the mean CD 4 count was 157. 92 cells/μl. Conclusion: Vomiting, epigastric pain, weight loss and anorexia were most frequent symptoms.

40|$|As the {{mortality}} associated with invasive Candida infections remains high, {{it is important}} to make optimal use of available diagnostic tools to initiate antifungal therapy as early as possible and to select the most appropriate antifungal drug. A panel of experts of the European Fungal Infection Study Group (EFISG) of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) undertook a data review and compiled guidelines for the clinical utility and accuracy of different diagnostic tests and procedures for detection of Candida infections.

40|$|Micafungin is an {{antimycotic}} {{drug and}} represents an important {{addition to the}} available therapies {{for the treatment of}} systemic fungal infections. Micafungin is used in the treatment of invasive <b>candidiasis,</b> <b>oesophageal</b> and prophylaxis of Candida infections. It inhibits, in a non-competitive way, the synthesis of 1, 3 -b-D-glucan, a component of fungal cell wall and is rapidly distributed into the tissues. It has a high-rate bond with respect to plasma protein; the above mentioned bond is independent from the concentration of the drug. It is metabolized through the liver, being not subject to intense metabolic transformations until the excretion. There is no evidence of systemic accumulation after repeated use and the steady-state is reached in 4 - 5 days. Medical records examined at the State Hospital Pharmacy of Marsala, highlights that, from 01. 06. 2014 to 01. 08. 2014, in this hospital 12 vials were used by the patients hospitalized in the department of Intensive Care: 8 patients are aged between 75 and 83 and have a body weight higher than 40 kg; 3 patients are aged between 40 and 60 and have a body weight higher than 40 kg and 1 patient has an age equal to 17 years and has a body weight equal to 40 kg. Two patients need a dose increase, for the others 10 patients the first dose resulted sufficient. Mycamine was used for the treatment of hypovolemic post-operative shock.

40|$|Double {{contrast}} barium radiology {{and upper}} gastrointestinal endoscopy were compared prospectively on 45 occasions in patients infected with HIV who presented with upper gastrointestinal symptoms. In 40 cases, a definite pathological diagnosis was reached and in four cases no organic basis for symptoms could be found. A correct and complete diagnosis {{was made on}} visual endoscopic criteria in 43 cases (95. 5 %) but in only 14 cases (31. 1 %) from barium studies alone. Radiology showed no abnormality in 22 cases where pathological changes were documented (<b>oesophageal</b> <b>candidiasis</b> in 21 cases). Where pathological confirmation of diagnosis existed (40 cases), endoscopy (without pathological support) had a sensitivity of 97. 5 % and a specificity of 100 % compared with the sensitivity and specificity of 25 and 100 % for barium studies. The difference between the sensitivities of the two methods was highly significant (P less than 0. 005). The combination of oral candidiasis and upper gastrointestinal symptoms without dysphagia or weight loss was so strongly associated with uncomplicated <b>oesophageal</b> <b>candidiasis</b> (negative predictive value 93 %; P less than 0. 025), that this is supported {{as a basis for}} therapy without the need for further investigation, although if upper gastrointestinal investigation is required, endoscopy should be the method of choice...|$|E

Fluconazole, 200 mg orally, was given on the first day, followed by 100 mg daily for 4 weeks. Clinical and mycological evaluation was performed in 31 patients at the end of treatment and 24 were also assessed after 8 weeks of starting treatment. In 1 patient fluconazole was discontinued, 5 patients were lost to follow-up and 6 patients died during the study. Clinical and mycological cure was achieved in all patients; in 31 of 36 patients the clinical picture resolved within a week. The cure was confirmed in 27 patients by oesophagoscopy. Two patients relapsed 1 month after stopping fluconazole but the reinstitution of therapy achieved cure. Asymptomatic fungal oropharynx colonization was evident in about 40 % of patients during treatment and follow-up period. Fluconazole was well tolerated by all patients but mild to moderate increase of liver enzymes values occurred in 16.

40|$|HIV {{infection}} predisposes {{a person}} to fungal infections because of failure in the host's cell-mediated immunity, which {{may result in a}} variety of fungal infections (1, 2). Candidiasis is commonly caused by Candida albicans which can become a multi-system problem affecting the patient's nails, mouth, oesophagus, lower gastrointestinal tract, genitalia and rectum. Candida oesophagitis is a condition diagnostic of AIDS and characterised by erythematous lesions, pseudomembranous areas and/or ulcerations of the oesophagus. The condition may cause difficulty in swallowing, retrosternal pain, nausea and vomiting. Significant weight loss may also develop secondary to the characteristic symptoms of <b>oesophageal</b> <b>candidiasis</b> (3). Reports to date suggest therapy failure, incomplete response and decreasing susceptibility to azole medications such as ketoconazole, fluconazole and itraconazole (4). Whilst amphotericin remains the standard treatment for systemic or resistant mycoses (1), hospital experience with amphotericin toxicity may be a limiting factor against initiating homebased therapy (1). We report the outcomes for a clinically responding patient with a falling CD 4 count diagnosed with <b>oesophageal</b> <b>candidiasis</b> receiving intravenous amphotericin at home for a continuous seventeen month period. This case fulfils current definitions of long-term survival (5, 6). The patient initially presented over three years previously with HIV-related thrombocytopenia, a diagnosis made after counselling and HIV antibody testing showed HIV infection. Over successive years the patient received out-patient follow up including quarterly CD 4 monitoring, treatment with Zidovudine, prophylaxis with Cotrimoxazole against Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, psychological counselling, oral and dental, care and social welfare interventions. The out-patient service included written information for the patient's General Medical Practitioner after each out-patient visit, on patient request. On presentation with <b>oesophageal</b> <b>candidiasis</b> due to Candida albicans three years later, the patient requested homebased care in association with the General Medical Practitioner (GP) {{and the rest of the}} primary healthcare team. The patient wished to keep hospital stays and out-patient visits to a minimum. The blood results for the patient's serum creatinine, urea and potassium are shown in Figures 1 - 3, respectively, for a total period of seventeen months during which amphotericin was administered.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{describe}} {{the pattern of}} clinical disease in women with HIV infection and to {{examine the effect of}} potential cofactors, including oral contraceptive use, alcohol and smoking, ethnic group, and route of HIV transmission, on progression to AIDS and death. DESIGN: Prospective observational cohort study. SETTING: 15 HIV and genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics in Britain and Ireland. PARTICIPANTS: 505 women aged over 18 years with a positive HIV antibody test entered the study between June 1992 and August 1995, with outcome data available for 503 women, and 1208 woman years of follow up to April 1996. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: AIDS defining conditions, incidence of AIDS, and death. RESULTS: 120 women (24 %) had AIDS at entry to the study. There were 99 incident AIDS cases and 132 deaths during 1208 woman years of follow up. Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) was the commonest first AIDS defining condition in white women (31 % of AIDS cases), followed by <b>oesophageal</b> <b>candidiasis</b> (19 %) while tuberculosis was the most common first AIDS defining condition among black African women (24 % of AIDS cases), followed by <b>oesophageal</b> <b>candidiasis</b> (19 %). In multivariate analyses, rate of progression to AIDS was significantly related to CD 4 lymphocyte count at entry and PCP prophylaxis, but not to ethnic group, route of HIV transmission, alcohol, smoking, or oral contraceptive use. Mortality from all causes was not significantly different in women infected through injecting drugs (adjusted ratio 1. 1, 95 % confidence interval 0. 7 - 1. 8) compared with those infected through sexual intercourse, and non-significantly lower in black African women (0. 7, 0. 3 - 1. 2) compared with white women. Survival was not significantly related to smoking, alcohol, or oral contraceptive use.

40|$|Predictors {{of death}} in hospitalized HIV-infected {{patients}} have not been previously reported in Bangladesh. The primary {{aim of this study}} was to determine predictors of death among hospitalized HIV-infected patients at a large urban hospital in Bangladesh. A study was conducted in the HIV in-patient unit (Jagori Ward) of icddr,b's Dhaka Hospital. Characteristics of patients who died during hospitalization were compared to those of patients discharged from the ward. Bivariate analysis was performed to determine associations between potential risk factors and death. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors independently associated with death. Of 293 patients admitted to the Jagori Ward, 57 died during hospitalization. Most hospitalized patients (67 %) were male and the median age was 35 (interquartile range: 2 - 65) years. Overall, 153 (52 %) patients were diagnosed with HIV within 6 months of hospitalization. The most common presumptive opportunistic infections (OIs) identified were tuberculosis (32 %), <b>oesophageal</b> <b>candidiasis</b> (9 %), Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) (8 %), and histoplasmosis (7 %). On multivariable analysis, independent predictors of mortality were CD 4 count ≤ 200 cells/mm 3 (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 16. 6, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 3. 7 - 74. 4), PJP (aOR: 18. 5, 95 % CI: 4. 68 - 73. 3), <b>oesophageal</b> <b>candidiasis</b> (aOR: 27. 5, 95 % CI: 5. 5 - 136. 9), malignancy (aOR: 15. 2, 95 % CI: 2. 3 - 99. 4), and bacteriuria (aOR: 7. 9, 95 % CI: 1. 2 - 50. 5). Being on antiretroviral therapy prior to hospitalization (aOR: 0. 2, 95 % CI: 0. 06 - 0. 5) was associated with decreased mortality.

40|$|Echinocandins {{have made}} a {{significant}} impact {{in the treatment of}} select invasive fungal infections, most notably invasive candidiasis and aspergillosis. However, treatment outcomes for such infections are still less than optimal, prompting an examination of dosing and administration techniques in an attempt to exploit known pharmacodynamic properties and improve outcomes. Echinocandins generally exhibit concentration-dependent, fungicidal activity against Candida spp. and fungistatic activity against Aspergillus spp. However, increasing drug concentrations of echinocandins above the organism’s MIC may result in a paradoxical increase in fungal growth as demonstrated in some in vitro and in vivo models (known most commonly as the ‘Eagle effect’). Therefore, the potential impact of dose escalations on improving the clinical efficacy of echinocandins based on in vitro and animal models are uncertain and are still being evaluated. In addition, such strategies have to consider the potential for increased treatment-related toxicities and costs. To date, published clinical studies (both superiority and non-inferiority) demonstrating the potential for dose-related improvements in treatment outcomes have been limited to mucocutaneous and <b>oesophageal</b> <b>candidiasis.</b> Further research i...|$|E
40|$|The {{incidence}} and prevalence of fungal infections in Tanzania remains unknown. We assessed the annual burden {{in the general}} population and among populations at risk. Data were extracted from 2012 reports of the Tanzanian AIDS program, WHO, reports, Tanzanian census, and from a comprehensive PubMed search. We used modelling and HIV data to estimate the burdens of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), cryptococcal meningitis (CM) and candidiasis. Asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and tuberculosis data were used to estimate the burden of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) and chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA). Burdens of candidaemia and Candida peritonitis were derived from critical care and/or cancer patients' data. In 2012, Tanzania's population was 43. 6 million (mainland) with 1   500   000 people reported to be HIV-infected. Estimated burden of fungal infections was: 4412 CM, 9600 PCP, 81   051 and 88   509 oral and <b>oesophageal</b> <b>candidiasis</b> cases respectively.

Controls were drug users positive for HIV, drug users negative for HIV, and homosexual {{men who had}} seroconverted. RESULTS [...] Five out of 18 (28 %) drug users were admitted to hospital with bacterial pneumonia in the {{four to six months}} between their last visit at which they were HIV negative and their first visit when they were HIV positive. For comparison none of the 27 homosexual men who seroconverted for HIV, three out of 177 (2 %) drug users negative for HIV, and 10 out of 112 (9 %) drug users positive for HIV reported bacterial pneumonia. One out of the 18 drug users who seroconverted suffered from <b>oesophageal</b> <b>candidiasis</b> at the time of seroconversion. Other clinical symptoms did not differ between drug users who seroconverted and those who remained negative for HIV, probably due to the high background morbidity among the drug users.

DESIGN: Meta-analysis of randomised trials of amphotericin B, various lipid soluble formulations of amphotericin B (for example, AmBisome), fluconazole, ketoconazole, miconazole, or itraconazole compared with placebo or no treatment. SETTING: Trials conducted anywhere in the world. SUBJECTS: Patients with cancer complicated by neutropenia. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mortality, invasive fungal infection (defined as positive blood culture, <b>oesophageal</b> <b>candidiasis,</b> or lung or deep tissue infection), and colonisation. RESULTS: 24 trials with 2758 randomised patients were reviewed; {{the total number of}} deaths was 434. Prophylactic or empirical treatment with antifungals as a group bad no effect on mortality (odds ratio 0. 92; 95 % confidence interval 0. 74 to 1. 14). Amphotericin B decreased mortality significantly (0. 58; 0. 37 to 0. 93) but the studies were small and the difference in number of deaths was only 15. Antifungal treatment decreased the incidence of invasive fungal infection (0. 47; 0. 35 to 0. 64) and fungal colonisation (0. 45; 0. 30 to 0. 69). For every 73 patients treated (95 % confidence interval to 48 to 158) one case of fungal invasion was prevented in surviving patients.

The diagnosis of any WHO stage 3 or 4 condition during the first 6 months of ART was associated with increased mortality (HR: 2. 21; 95 % CI: 1. 97 – 2. 47). After adjustment for age, sex, region and pre-ART CD 4 count, a diagnosis of extrapulmonary cryptococcosis (aHR: 3. 54; 95 % CI: 2. 74 – 4. 56), HIV wasting syndrome (aHR: 2. 92; 95 %CI: 2. 21 - 3. 85), non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection (aHR: 2. 43; 95 % CI: 1. 80 – 3. 28) and Pneumocystis pneumonia (aHR: 2. 17; 95 % CI 1. 80 – 3. 28) {{were associated with the}} greatest increased mortality.

40|$|Echinocandins are {{first-line}} {{agents for}} the treatment of invasive Candida infections due to their spectrum of activity and favourable pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties. All three agents are approved {{for the treatment}} of <b>oesophageal</b> <b>candidiasis,</b> candicaemia and other forms of invasive candidiasis. However, only micafungin is licensed for antifungal prophylaxis in stem cell transplantation, whereas caspofungin is approved for empirical therapy of febrile neutropenia. Echinocandins inhibit the synthesis of 1, 3 -β-D-glucan, an essential component of the fungal cell wall. All echinocandins have low oral bioavailability, and distribute well into tissues, but poorly into the cerebrospinal fluid and eye. They display concentration-dependent fungicidal (for Candida) or fungistatic (for Aspergillus) activity. They possess in vitro detectable postantifungal effect in RPMI- 1640, which is 0. 9 - 20 hours against Candida and < 0. 5 hours against Aspergillus. The in vitro paradoxical effect (increased growth at supra-MIC drug concentrations) is observed most frequently with caspofungin, however the clinical relevance of this phenomenon is equivocal. Echinocandins are well tolerated with few serious drug-drug interactions, since they are not appreciable substrates, inducers or inhibitors of the cytochrome P 450 or P-glycoprotein system. Clinical resistance to the echinocandins is rare, although recently published surveillance studies have shown in increasing incidence of echinocandin resistance among Candida spp. Resistance has been attributed to mutations in the FKS 1 gene within two hot spot regions, leading to amino acid substitutions. Candidiasis caused by resistant isolates can be treated with dose escalation of echinocandins in some, but not all cases. egységes, osztatlangyógyszerészangolV...|$|E
40|$|There {{is a lack}} of {{knowledge}} on the epidemiology of fungal infections worldwide because there are no reporting obligations. The aim {{of this study was to}} estimate the burden of fungal disease in Portugal as part of a global fungal burden project. Most published epidemiology papers reporting fungal infection rates from Portugal were identified. Where no data existed, specific populations at risk and fungal infection frequencies in those populations were used in order to estimate national incidence or prevalence, depending on the condition. An estimated 1, 510, 391 persons develop a skin or nail fungal infection each year. The second most common fungal infection in Portugal is recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis, with an estimated 150, 700 women (15 - 50  years of age) suffering from it every year. In human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -infected people, oral or <b>oesophageal</b> <b>candidiasis</b> rates were estimated to be 19. 5 and 16. 8 / 100, 000, respectively. Candidaemia affects 2. 19 / 100, 000 patients, in a total of 231 cases nationally. Invasive aspergillosis is less common than in other countries as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is uncommon in Portugal, a total of 240 cases annually. The estimated prevalence of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis after tuberculosis (TB) is 194 cases, whereas its prevalence for all underlying pulmonary conditions was 776 patients. Asthma is common (10 % in adults) and we estimate 16, 614 and 12, 600 people with severe asthma with fungal sensitisation and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, respectively. Sixty-five patients develop Pneumocystis pneumonia in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and 13 develop cryptococcosis. Overall, we estimate a total number of 1, 695, 514 fungal infections starting each year in Portugal. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{estimate}} median {{survival and}} changes in survival in patients diagnosed as having AIDS. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: Clinics in two large London hospitals. SUBJECTS: 2625 patients with AIDS seen between 1982 and July 1995. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Survival, estimated using lifetable analyses, and factors associated with survival, identified from Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: Median survival (20 months) was longer than previous estimates. The CD 4 lymphocyte count at or before initial AIDS defining illness decreased significantly over time from 90 x 10 (6) / 1 during 1987 or earlier to 40 x 10 (6) / 1 during 1994 and 1995 (P < 0. 0001). In {{the first three months}} after diagnosis, patients in whom AIDS was diagnosed after 1987 had a much lower risk of death (relative risk 0. 44, 95 % confidence interval 0. 22 to 0. 86; P = 0. 017) than patients diagnosed before 1987. When the diagnosis was based on <b>oesophageal</b> <b>candidiasis</b> or Kaposi's sarcoma, patients had a lower risk of death than when the diagnosis was based on Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (0. 21 (0. 07 to 0. 59). P = 0. 0030 and 0. 37 (0. 16 to 0. 83), P = 0. 016). Three months after AIDS diagnosis, the risk of death was similar in patients whose diagnosis was made after and before 1987 (1. 02 (0. 79 to 1. 31), P = 0. 91). There were no differences in survival between patients diagnosed during 1988 - 90, 1991 - 3, or 1994 - 5. CONCLUSIONS: In later years, patients {{were much more likely to}} survive their initial illness, but long term survival has remained poor. The decrease in CD 4 lymphocyte count at AIDS diagnosis indicates that patients are being diagnosed as having AIDS at ever more advanced stages of immunodeficiency...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Voriconazole {{has proven}} {{efficacy}} against invasive aspergillosis and <b>oesophageal</b> <b>candidiasis.</b> This multicentre, randomised, non-inferiority study compared voriconazole with a regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole {{for the treatment}} of candidaemia in non-neutropenic patients. METHODS: Non-neutropenic patients with a positive blood culture for a species of candida and clinical evidence of infection were enrolled. Patients were randomly assigned, in a 2 : 1 ratio, either voriconazole (n= 283) or amphotericin B followed by fluconazole (n= 139). The primary efficacy analysis was based on clinical and mycological response 12 weeks after the end of treatment, assessed by an independent data-review committee unaware of treatment assignment. FINDINGS: Of 422 patients randomised, 370 were included in the modified intention-to-treat population. Voriconazole was non-inferior to amphotericin B/fluconazole in the primary efficacy analysis, with successful outcomes in 41 % of patients in both treatment groups (95 % CI for difference - 10. 6 % to 10. 6 %). At the last evaluable assessment, outcome was successful in 162 (65 %) patients assigned voriconazole and 87 (71 %) assigned amphotericin B/fluconazole (p= 0. 25). Voriconazole cleared blood cultures as quickly as amphotericin B/fluconazole (median time to negative blood culture, 2. 0 days). Treatment discontinuations due to all-cause adverse events were more frequent in the voriconazole group, although most discontinuations were due to non-drug-related events and there were significantly fewer serious adverse events and cases of renal toxicity than in the amphotericin B/fluconazole group. INTERPRETATION: Voriconazole was as effective as the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole in the treatment of candidaemia in non-neutropenic patients, and with fewer toxic effects. RELEVANCE TO PRACTICE: There are several options for treatment of candidaemia in non-neutropenic patients, including amphotericin B, fluconazole, voriconazole, and echinocandins. Voriconazole can be given both as initial intravenous treatment and as an oral stepdown agent...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Structured {{treatment}} interruption (STI) of antiretroviral therapy (ART) {{could potentially}} reduce cost and toxicity, but clinical efficacy requires evaluation. METHODS: An assessment of fixed-duration STI was nested in DART, a multicentre trial comparing strategies for monitoring ART in Uganda and Zimbabwe (ISCRTN 13968779). Of 3316 ART-naive symptomatic adults with CD 4 cell count or = 300 cells/microl after 48 or 72 weeks underwent a second randomization to either STI, cycles of 12 weeks on/off (408), or continuous ART (CT; 405). RESULTS: Median age at STI/CT randomization was 37 years (range, 19 - 67) and CD 4 cell count 358 cells/microl (range, 300 - 1054). A second review terminated the STI/CT randomisation on 15 March 2006, and participants changed to CT. Median follow-up was 51 weeks (range, 0 - 85) : 99 % and 50 % of {{time was spent}} on ART in CT and STI, respectively. First new World Health Organization (WHO) stage 4 events or death occurred more frequently in STI (24; 6. 4 / 100 person-years) than CT (9; 2. 4 / 100 person-years) (hazard ratio, 2. 73; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 27 - 5. 88; P = 0. 007); <b>oesophageal</b> <b>candidiasis</b> being the most frequent event (STI, 13; CT, 3). Nine (1 %) participants died (STI, 5; CT, 4). There {{was no difference in}} time to first serious adverse event (P = 0. 78), although ART change owing to toxicity occurred more with CT (10; 2. 6 / 100 person-years) than with STI (2; 0. 5 / 100 person-years) (P = 0. 02). CONCLUSIONS: Although absolute rates of WHO stage 4 events/death were low, 12 week STIS initiated at a CD 4 cell count >/= 300 cells/microl resulted in a greater than twofold increased relative rate of disease progression compared with continuous therapy in adult Africans initiating ART with advanced disease, and cannot be recommended...|$|E
40|$|Implementation of Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) {{services}} at health centres in Tanzania were delayed due to several reasons including shortage of qualified staff, inadequate infrastructure and logistics problems. However, patients from peripheral areas experienced difficulties in accessing ART services due to long distances from clinics. National AIDS Control Programme (NACP) and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) embarked on ART services scale-up programme aimed at improved ART availability and accessibility. Through this programme ART services were established at health centres and selected dispensaries. However, no previous documented experiences existed at country level to guide provision of services. Therefore, {{this study was}} designed to gather experiences and share lessons learnt with other health care providers and programme implementing partners. This was a descriptive cross-sectional study involved patients enrolled to ART services between May 2007 and April 2009. Data collection involved observation of health providers’ performance and retrospective ART and care patients’ registers review. During the study period, 611 care and 284 ART patients were attended. Majority of patients (85. 1 %; 762 / 895) were adults aged 25 - 45 years. In total 61. 5 % (550 / 895) of the patients had CD 4 +T lymphocytes ≤ 350 /μl the cut-off point for initiating ART. The frequency of symptoms was noted to significantly decrease with increasing CD 4 counts (P> 0. 001). Numbness, parotid enlargement and genital discharge were not related to patient level of CD 4 +T-lymphocytes counts. Papular pruritic eruptions 98 / 282 (34. 8 %), tuberculosis 86 / 282 (30. 5 %) and <b>oesophageal</b> <b>candidiasis</b> 37 / 282 (13. 1) were the most diagnosed AIDS defining illnesses. Sixteen patients on care died and 30 were lost to follow up. Overall the clinical management was poorly performed. ART services can successively be provided at health centre level and encourages HIV-infected persons to seek care. However, clinicians need regular clinical mentorship and supportive supervision...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Species-specific {{clinical}} breakpoints (CBPs) for Candida spp. {{were established}} following consideration of clinical outcomes {{in patients with}} <b>oesophageal</b> <b>candidiasis.</b> We sought to further determine {{the validity of the}} current CBPs based on data from a prospective candidaemia study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All Candida albicans candidaemia episodes in patients enrolled in the Australian Candidaemia Study and who were treated with fluconazole monotherapy were included. Fluconazole MICs were established using Sensititre(®) YeastOne(®). RESULTS: Two hundred and seventeen evaluable episodes were identified, 93. 5 % of which occurred in adult patients. Fluconazole was commenced within 72 h of blood culture positivity in 96. 3 % (209 / 217) of episodes. Fluconazole doses were appropriate in 89. 9 % (195 / 217) of episodes and the median duration of therapy was 14 days (IQR 8 - 21 days) for the whole cohort. The all-cause 30 day mortality was 19. 8 % (43 / 217), with 37. 2 % (16 / 43) of deaths attributed to candidaemia. Classification and regression tree (CART) analysis identified a fluconazole MIC target of ≥ 2 mg/L for infection-related mortality and ≥ 4 mg/L for overall 30 day mortality. Overall mortality was no different in episodes with isolates above or below the identified MIC target, although there was a trend towards significance (P =  0. 051). On univariate analysis, infection-related mortality was significantly increased in C. albicans episodes with an MIC ≥ 2 mg/L compared with those below this MIC target (20. 6 % versus 4. 9 %; P =  0. 001). This target remained an independent predictor of infection-related mortality (OR 8. 2; 95 % CI 2. 3 - 29. 7; P =  0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: We observed a direct relationship between infection-related mortality and rising fluconazole MIC for C. albicans candidaemia; overall, the data support the EUCAST and revised CLSI fluconazole clinical breakpoints.

40|$|European {{guidelines}} {{recommend the}} routine offer of an HIV test {{in patients with}} a number of AIDS-defining and non-AIDS conditions believed to share an association with HIV; so called indicator conditions (IC). Adherence with this guidance across Europe is not known. We audited HIV testing behaviour in patients accessing care for a number of ICs. Participating centres reviewed the case notes of either 100 patients or of all consecutive patients in one year, presenting for each of the following ICs: tuberculosis, non-Hodgkins lymphoma, anal and cervical cancer, hepatitis B and C and <b>oesophageal</b> <b>candidiasis.</b> Observed HIVpositive rates were applied by region and IC to estimate the number of HIV diagnoses potentially missed. Outcomes examined were: HIV test rate (% of total patients with IC), HIV test accepted (% of tests performed/% of tests offered) and new HIV diagnosis rate (%). There were 49 audits from 23 centres, representing 7037 patients. The median test rate across audits was 72 % (IQR 32 - 97), lowest in Northern Europe (median 44 %, IQR 22 - 68 %) and highest in Eastern Europe (median 99 %, IQR 86 - 100). Uptake of testing was close to 100 % in all regions. The median HIV+ rate was 0. 9 % (IQR 0. 0 - 4. 9), with 29 audits (60. 4 %) having an HIV+ rate > 0. 1 %. After adjustment, there were no differences between regions of Europe in the proportion with > 0. 1 % testing positive (global p = 0. 14). A total of 113 patients tested HIV+. Applying the observed rates of testing HIV+ within individual ICs and regions to all persons presenting with an IC suggested that 105 diagnoses were potentially missed. Testing rates in well-established HIV ICs remained low across Europe, despite high prevalence rates, reflecting missed opportunities for earlier HIV diagnosis and care. Significant numbers may have had an opportunity for HIV diagnosis if all persons included in IC audits had been tested. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
