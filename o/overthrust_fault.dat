30|$|In this way, {{development}} of the evaporite tectonic depends on the deposition thickness (Figs.  6, 7) of the evaporite sedimentary cover {{and the presence of}} the tectonic depressive loops. These loops belong to the intersection of the transverse and longitudinal fault generated since the rifting phase (T 3 to J 3 -Cr 1). In such intersection places, the Dumrea (Albania) and Zavrohon (Greece) diapirs erupted to the surface (Figs.  7, 12).

The Western Stable Platform, which covers the entirely offshore western part of the basin, was affected by late Cretaceous–Eocene normal block faulting but has remained relatively stable {{throughout the rest of the}} Tertiary. The Eastern Mobile Belt, on the other hand, is home to numerous tectonic processes and evolution.

30|$|Tectonically, Azadegan {{oil field}} is {{situated}} in the southwest of the Zagros <b>overthrust</b> <b>fault</b> zone and in the transition zone between the Zagros foreland basin and Arabian platform (Soleimani 2013). Two different types of traps with different forming mechanisms are confirmed here: One type is called the Zagros Trend, located in the foothill zone (Zagros folded zone) with an NW–SE strike, and with similar trends as the anticlinal structure elongated in the Zagros Mountain range. The Miocene Asmari Formation, which is dominantly limestone and partially sandstone, is the main reservoir of the Zagros Trend oil fields (Wang et al. 2011; Zhang et al. 2012; McQuillan 1973, 1974; Bordenave and Hegre 2005). The other type, known as the Arabian Trend—uplifting caused by basement fault “resurrection” and salt flow, widely distributed {{in a number of}} oil fields which are located in southeast of Iraq, Kuwait, and northeast of Saudi Arabia, with N-S trending anticlinal structures. In this type of oil field, the reservoirs are mainly Cretaceous Formations, i.e., Ilam, Sarvak in Iran and Mishrif, Rumalia in Iraq (Alsharhan 1995; Alsharhan and Nairn 1997; Beydoun 1991; Sadooni and Aqrawi 2000; Sadooni 2005; Bordenave and Hegre 2005). As shown in Fig.  1, Majnoon, NahrUmr, West Qurna, Rumaila, and Zubair oil fields in Iraq are classified as the Arabian Trend, whereas the oil fields of the Ahwaz area in the east of the Azadegan are identified as the Zagros Trend.|$|E
30|$|There {{are some}} {{differences}} in reservoir quality of clastic rock between the hanging {{wall and the}} foot wall of the Ke-Bai overthrust belt, northwestern margin of the Junggar Basin, western China, which affect the efficient petroleum exploration in this highly mature exploration area. Based on {{a large number of}} thin-sections, cast thin-sections, and physical property analysis of cores, we systematically discuss the Permian-Jurassic reservoir differences between the hanging wall and the foot wall of the Ke-Bai <b>overthrust</b> <b>fault</b> from the aspects of structural evolution, time-space distribution of the depositional system, diagenesis characteristics, and reservoir quality and analyzed the reasons for the differences in reservoir properties. The overthrusting of the Ke-Bai fault directly results in different burial histories, diagenesis evolution, and porosity evolution between the hanging wall and the foot wall. The differences of reservoir characteristics are mainly embodied in buried depth, grain size, sedimentary facies, diagenetic stage, and reservoir quality. The analysis results showed that burial history and depositional characteristics controlled by overthrusting are direct influencing factors of reservoir differences. Because of shallow burial depth of the hanging wall, the reservoir compaction is weak and primary pores are preserved well. The porosity of reservoir on the hanging wall is generally 10 %– 25 %. The strata on the foot wall are deeply buried, and there are mainly mixed pores with the average porosity of 5 %– 20 %. The favorable reservoir on the foot wall is generally developed near faults or in the channel sand bodies, which are usually dissolution development areas.|$|E
30|$|The region {{around the}} Karamay-Baikouquan (Ke-Bai) {{overthrust}} belt is the richest in hydrocarbon accumulation in the Junggar Basin. Previous {{research has indicated}} that oil in the region came from the Fengcheng Formation in the Mahu Depression to the northeast of the region, but the oil distribution around the Mahu Depression is remarkably uneven. Large amounts of oil have been found in the Ke-Bai overthrust belt {{to the west of the}} depression and only some small oilfields have been discovered in the eastern margin of the depression. This uneven distribution revealed that the oil source of the Ke-Bai region might not be from the Mahu Depression. The oil type distribution and the oil migration pattern revealed in this paper showed that there may be another oil source under the Karamay overthrust. Based on geochemical data, the oil was classified into two types from the sterane and terpane characteristics. Type A oil was mainly distributed in the Huwan area and blocks V and VIII of the Karamay Oilfield in the southern part of the region, while type B oil was mainly distributed in the Baikouquan Oilfield in the northern part of the region. In addition, oil migration pathways and direction were determined by the values of diasterane / regular sterane and C 30 moretane / C 30 hopane ratios. It is shown that the oil of Huwan area on the hanging wall of the overthrust was mainly charged along the <b>overthrust</b> <b>fault</b> surfaces and then migrated to the west, whereas the oil in blocks V and VIII on the foot wall of the overthrust came from the Mahu Depression in the east. As a result, there may be at least two hydrocarbon source kitchens in the study area. The hydrocarbons in the blocks V and VIII on the footwall of the overthrust belt and in the Baikouquan Oilfield mainly came from the Fengcheng Formation in the Mahu Depression, and the hydrocarbons in the Huwan area on the hanging wall of the overthrust belt may come from another hydrocarbon source kitchen below the overthrust. This recognition indicates that there is substantial exploration potential in the deep Carboniferous strata on the hanging wall of the overthrust belt.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, the e cacy of many observables {{proposed}} as possible seismic pre- cursory signals is, at most, unproven, mainly {{due to the}} lack of appropriate, systematic and longterm observations. In fact, strong earthquakes rarely occurs and every presumed precursor can be often a ected by its own variability, that it is not linked to seismic features. This PhD Thesis is based on the identi cation and characterization of possible anomalies in uranium (U) groundwater content and on the correlation between this observable and the seismicity of the sampling area. Such an analysis is one of the rst studies in this research eld available so far, mainly due to the uniqueness of the achievable observations. In fact, uranium groundwater content has been monitored weekly within the framework of the INFN's scienti c program ERMES (Environmental Radioactivity Monitoring for Earth Sciences) since June, 2008. The area under investigation was a ected by a seismic swarm from October, 2008 to December, 2009, with the main shock occurring at 01 : 33 UT on April 6 th, 2009 (Ml= 5. 9). Gran Sasso National Laboratories (LNGS-INFN) are located inside the lar- gest aquifer in central Italy and within the limestone formation of the upturned syncline, near the main <b>overthrust</b> <b>fault.</b> This complex hydrogeological system implies the separation of water masses belonging to two di erent creeks: the for- mer, where the main laboratories are located, ows in well drained cretaceous formation, while the latter is within not drained and poorly permeable dolomitic formations. Depending on the path and on percolation features, water masses are therefore characterized by di erent chemical-physical properties. These physical observables are constantly monitored since June, 2008. The rst part of our analysis is focused on the identi cation of periods of sei- smic anomalies, to discriminate between seismic activity and moderate seismicity. We consider the Italian Seismological Instrumental and Parametric Data-Base by INGV and we select events occurred between April 16 th, 2005 and September 30 th, 2014 with Ml 1. 0, in the circular region centered at LNGS-INFN with a radius of 100 km. The catalog is tested for being homogeneous and complete. The leading role in the seismic analysis is played by the energy release Ei, estimated for each i-th seismic event with magnitude Mi and normalized to the minimum energy release Emin, relative to the minimum value of magnitude Mmin considered. The normalized energy release is calculated for monthly sliding time windows, together with the number of events. Periods of intense seismic activity are de ned as those time intervals when both E and N exceed the threshold corresponding to the 30 % of the considered time interval. Thus, four periods of intense seismic activity are identi ed. The second part of our work is based on the characterization of uranium time series. 1 The uranium contents are revealed by ICP-MS technique (using a 7500 a from Agilent Technologies). We describe the process of optimization of a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm. Such a script is developed and enforced to derive information about the main features of the uranium time series. The characteristic frequency intervals are revealed and ltered. As a nal step, the outliers of the residual time series are identi ed. The analysis is applied to the time series of uranium contents of groundwater sampled in sites E 1, E 3, E 3 dx and E 4, displaced inside the underground facilities. Our main result is the observation of an anomalous behavior of uranium con- tent just before the L'Aquila earthquake, in every sampling site considered. Some cross-correlations between outliers are found. Furthermore, we observe an anoma- lous value before the seismic swarm that a ected the region under consideration between July and December, 2010, only in the sampling site E 3 dx. No anomalous value in uranium content is observed during the seismic activity time spans. We propose that the uranium groundwater anomalies observed before the sei- smic swarm and the main shock, which occurred on April 6 th, 2009 in L'Aquila, provide a key geochemical signal of a progressive increase of deep CO 2 uxes at middle-lower crustal levels. Repeated sharp U enrichments in groundwater, that can be directly associated with the geodynamics of the earthquake, represent a much more precise strain-meter than radon. Indeed, radon concentration depends on its parent nuclides uranium and radium during the preparation phase of the earthquake (and on their geochemical patterns with reference to environmental redox and pH characteristics) and it is only successively released by microfrac- turing, during the main shock and aftershocks (see Plastino et al., 2011 and references therein). We believe that uranium anomalies could be used as a possible strain meter in domains where continental lithosphere is subducted...|$|E
40|$|<b>Overthrust</b> <b>faults</b> {{have been}} a source of debate and {{discussion}} in creation literature for many years. Their interpretation demands a better explanation in a Flood context. Two fault systems are examined as analogies for an “overthrust ” model. The South Fork Fault System (SFFS) and the Heart Mountain Fault System (HMFS) exhibit folding and faulting consistent with thinskinned overthrust systems. Both systems moved catastrophically under the influence of gravity. The South Fork Fault system (SFFS, southwest of Cody, Wyoming, exhibits tear faults, tight folds, a triangle zone, and flat-ramp geometries along {{the leading edge of the}} system. Transport was southeast, down a gentle slope during early to middle Eocene time (Late Flood), approximately coeval with the Heart Mountain Fault system (HMFS). The SFFS detaches in lower Jurassic strata, rich in gypsum-anhydrite, overlain by about 1250 m of Jurassic through Tertiary sedimentary and volcanic rocks. Movement between 5 km and 10 km to the southeast spread the allochthonous mass over an area exceeding 1400 km 2. A break-away fault and an area of tectonic denudation mark the upper northwest part of the system. The exposed denuded surface was buried by additional Eocene-age volcanic rocks soon after slip. Catastrophic rearloading during emplacement of HMFS may have initiated subsequent movement on the SFFS, with dehydration processes trapping water in a near frictionless anhydrite-water slurry. Rapid development of near-surface folds, as observed in the toe of the SFFS, could only have developed while the sediments were still unlithified...|$|R

There are four main {{geological}} units (Fig. 2) : autochthonous foreland, foredeep basin, inner and external Albanides. The Kruja zone {{is included in the}} External Albanides. The Kruja thrustbelt consists of a succession of tectonic duplexes. From tectonic point of view this zone represents orogen, but with shallow water carbonates facies. It is represented by some anticlinal structural lines which are tectonically faulted in their western flank. Western edge of this zone is complex due to regional <b>overthrust</b> <b>faults,</b> which have caused their overthrusting above the South Adriatic basin with amplitude of about 70 - 100 km. A folded zone with high perspective plays must have developed, which is an analogue scenario as the Apennines overthrust in Italy. The stratigraphic section of the Kruja zone comprises: Upper Cretaceous to Paleocene-Eocene platform carbonate sequences; the Oligocene-Aquitaine deposits are represented by flysch-flyschoidal sandstone-clays-silts with underwater slumping horizons and organogenic-clastic limestones; nonconformity Tortonian-Pliocene molasses deposits. From petroleum point of view, numerous surface oil seeps occurred there along the Neogene nonconformity in Tirana piggyback basin. The seeps confirm the existence of a currently active petroleum system in this area, but no commercial hydrocarbon accumulation has yet been found. Many exploration wells with target being carbonate structures and Neogenic sandstones have been drilled in this zone. ln the Kruja zone, the source rocks horizons were proved to be related to Upper Cretaceous deposits.

3000|$|The Albania thrust belt {{consists}} of {{both internal and}} external tectonic zones, which are westward overthrusts with large amplitude (50 – 100  km), above the Apulian Patform and the South Adriatic Basin. The External Albanides are subdivided into distinct tectonic-stratigraphic units: the Kruja zone (shallow carbonate water) in the east and the Ionian zone in the west, which is represented by pelagic limestone. The Ionian zone, located between the Sazan (Pre-Apuliane) and Kruja zones, {{consists of}} three anticlinal belts: the Berati, Kurveleshi and Cika anticlinal belts. Their western margin is bordered on <b>overthrust</b> <b>faults,</b> which have produced large westward overthrusts on each of them, with amplitudes of 10 – 30  kms, and are utilized through a large diapir masses. Therefore, they mask perspective plays in subthrusts. The Berati anticlinal belt is the most eastern in the Ionian zone and lies mostly in the Albanian territory and partly in the Greek territory. It has a length of about 225 kms and a width 12 – 22 kms, and is differentiated into two sectors: the southern sector (south of the Qafa Kicoku) and the northern sector (north of the Qafa Kicoku). Understanding the evolution of evaporite tectonics is important in determining the principal features of the structural model on the Berati anticlinal belt. The changes in the lithostatic pressure on the space have a greater {{role in the development of}} evaporite tectonics, which are conditioned by the deposition thickness of the cover sediments above the evaporites and the presence of weak tectonic loops. These loops belong to the intersecting places of transverse and longitudinal fault generated since the rifting phase (T 3 -Cr 1). Such intersecting places are the Dumrea (Albania) and Zavrohon (Greece) on the surface. We stress that evaporites are also extended over regional thrust faults of the Berati belt, helping its overthrusting westward about 20 – 30 km (depicted by seismic and deep wells data). The tectonic evaporite effect differs from the expansion of the Berat thrust belt. Thus, in its southern part, as a result of a diapirism that has not emerged on the surface, it is helping orogenies in developing large fan-type anticline structures (Golika, Nemercka, Mitsikeli anticlines, etc.), that have backthrusts in their eastern flank. Moreover, we encountered the presence of a carbonate massive in the middle of the Epiro-Akarnani syncline (e.g. Timfeu massive in Greece), caused by the “blind” evaporite body effect. The northern sector (north of Qafa e Kicoku), is characterized by a smaller evaporite effect, which is reflected in increasing density of the anticlinal structures on the surface units and their normal passing to each other. The Dumrea diapir is a considerable ellipsoid-shape evaporite mass outcropping with a surface area of about 210  km 2 and axes 20  ×  10  km. It is an ordinary diapir with a westward overthrust (20 – 30  km). Most oil fields in Albania are in carbonate sections (Cr 2 -Pg 2) in the anticline structures delivered to the thrust of adjacent units. There is another new prospect of the high perspective: The carbonate structures under overthrust of different units (subthrust complex) of the Ionian zone. The subthrust in the Ionian zone is divided into three types: 1. The subthrust beneath overthrust of thrust belts. These overthrusts are related to the evaporite detachment horizon, and they mask folded structures of subthrust. 2. The subthrusts beneath the overthrusts of the anticline units. These overthrusts have a local character and they are more developed in the Kurveleshi thrust belt. 3. The subthrusts beneath the overthrusts of the tectonic zones of the orogenetic front (Ionian and Kruja Zones) above the western autochthonous (Apulian Platform and South Adriatic Basin). These structures display duplex and triplex style. Currently, the more interesting opportunity lies in the subthrust beneath the Berati thrust belt. This has a higher perspective than the other subthrusts beneath the Kurvelesh and Cika anticlinal belts. Actually, the Berati subthrust is in the processes of being the subject of a seismic survey and exploration drilling. The discovery of a new oil field in the subthrust of the Berati anticlinal belt, with drilling of the Shpiragu- 2 well, which in the first test gave 800 – 1300 barrels (light oil with density 35 – 37 ° API) and 2 – 5  mmcfd gas per day, is of great importance for the entire tectonic ensemble of the Dinaric-Albanid-Hellenic. The presence of prospective structures such as the Dumrea anticline in the north and its continuation southward (the Shpiragu oil field, Molishti anticline, etc.), beneath the thrust belt, as shown by both drilling and seismic data, together with the presence of the surface structures (e.g. the Kasidhiaris, Kurenton and Thesprotikon anticlines) in Greece, shows the regional scale [...]...|$|R

The Gabel Uweinat-Bir Safsaf Aswan Uplift is situated at the eastern fringe of this craton, and its high-grade metamorphic and granitoid rock associations are markedly distinct from the metavolcanic-metasedimentary-ophiolitic sequences of the Eastern Desert of Egypt (Nubian Shield). Crystalline basement rocks cover an area of some 40, 000 km 2 in SW Egypt. The fieldwork and mapping of the basement rocks in the present area were carried out during the winters 1998, 1999 and at last in 2001 for altogether about 10 months of fieldwork. A detailed field geologic-structural map to the scale of 1 : 60, 000 and two cross sections, perpendicular to the regional structural trend for the whole area, are prepared using vertical aerial photographs and Landsat images. Detailed petrographic studies of the different rock units were carried out to determine their compositional character and the effect of deformation on each rock unit. Some 125 rock specimens representing the different rock units were collected and more than 130 thin sections were examined petrographically using the polarizing microscope. Microstructure studies and (analyses) attempted to determine the structural evolution and possible transport direction from about 40 oriented thin sections parallel and perpendicular to the foliation. Further structural data, from the anisotropy of the magnetic susceptibility (AMS) was determined from 31 oriented samples, which were cored and cut (200 cylinders). The magnetic susceptibility measurements were analyzed with the Kappa bridge. The BIF is exposed as an upper unit, while anatexite forms a middle one, underlain by ultramafic-mafic units. The BIF shows large quartz crystals with wavy extinction and undeformed recrystallized quartz. The Anatexite sequences were affected by granulite facies metamorphism, followed by a retrograde metamorphism. The petrographic study shows some orthopyroxene crystals altered to hornblende, biotite and chlorite. The structural analysis of the area indicated that it was subjected to major tectonic deformation including folding, <b>overthrusting,</b> shearing and <b>faulting.</b> The area is built up of thrust slices of the BIF and Anatexite, which extend for more than 25 km in N 15 °E direction, dipping to the west with angles between 30 ° to 70 °. The thickness of slices horses is up to 4 km. The thrust sequence in this area has about 20 km width. Thrust Faults have been derived from overturned folds, the shear surface replacing one of the limbs of the fold. The structure is dominated by a series of nearly parallel, minor thrust faults, or high angle reverse faults, which dissect the rock into slices, sheets, plates, blocks or wedges that are approximately equidistant and have the same displacement and are all steeply inclined to the WNW (285 °). Restoration of this thrust sequence shows that the anatexite forms a basement to the overlying BIF. Both metamorphic banding in the anatexite and the layering in the BIF restore to a horizontal primary orientation. The Deformational Evolution Three major deformation phases can be discerned in the study area (D 1, D 2 and D 3), the three phases D 1, D 2 and D 3 affected only the basement rocks and are followed by Phanerozoic brittle deformation affecting both the basement and the overlying sedimentary rocks in the investigated area. The D 1 structures indicate a crustal thickening followed by crustal thinning and developed the melano- and leucosome in the Anatexite sequences. A foliation (S 1) observed in the thin section of the BIF as simple shear mylonitization zones. Generally in (D 1) the Anatexite bands are parallel with the mylonitic shear zones in the BIF. The D 2 structures dominate in the BIF as a micro and macro folding (F 2) associated with low angle thrust or shear zones (S 2). In the Anatexite and the Ultramafic-mafic sequences minor folds with the same characters as in the BIF are observed. Generally in (D 2) the BIF and Anatexite bands had E-W strike and dipped shallowly to the south (S 2), and contain minor folds (F 2) with E-W axial surfaces. The D 1 and D 2 deformations are both of them overprinted by the D 3 structures, which refolded the F 2 at a perpendicular direction of the fold axes by F 3. The D 3 affected refolding and thrusting at the BIF, Anatexite sequences and Ultramfic-mafic bands as F 3 and S 3. The F 3 has NNE trend and plunge with an angle of 15 °. The foliation S 3, is parallel to the fold axial surfaces and thrust surfaces. The dip angle ranges between 30 ° and 70 ° to the WWN (285 °) ...|$|R
