"Mr. Marmon is a {{recognized}} authority in this realm and his words, owing to his long and successful experiences in {{all manner of}} automobile contests and activities, carry considerable weight with both the trade and the public.

[...] "I believe that this seasons motor races will be the best ever," [...] said Mr. Marmon. [...] "This is not idle talk but take my own case for instance. I cannot afford to stop with a jolt, because I have gained too much of practical value. The severe races have helped the study of the construction <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>cars</b> and so with every manufacturer. I also believe that the appetite of the public is whetted to a keen taste for automobile speed battles. The 500 mile race proposed at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway promises to attract a great field and will be perhaps the greatest race ever held. Many new firms that have never entered cars before this season will do so this year. Concerning the automotive industry in general, I am an optimist. I am positive that the public demand is steadily growing. The fact that it is steady and not a sudden fad is encouragement to me. People need automobiles now the same as the telephone or the electric light in their homes".|$|R
