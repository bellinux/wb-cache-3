40|$|This article reviews Peter Mair’s {{argument}} on {{the failure of}} political parties and the subsequent failure <b>of</b> <b>representative</b> democracy in Europe.

It identifies three ideal typical models <b>of</b> <b>representative</b> democracy {{that seem to have}} succeeded each other over time: cleavage-based democracy, competitive democracy, and audience democracy. The article proposes specific empirical hypotheses for political parties and voters in each of these periods and provides empirical evidence to test the validity of these hypotheses. It concludes with a discussion of the results, evaluating whether the changes that occurred indicate failure <b>of</b> <b>representative</b> democracy or rather the emergence of a different form <b>of</b> <b>representative</b> democracy. - See more at: [URL]...|$|R
