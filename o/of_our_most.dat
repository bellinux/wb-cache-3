25|$|Pediatric care {{is complex}} due to {{developmental}} and dependency {{issues associated with}} children. How these factors impact the specific processes of care {{is an area of}} science in which little is known. Throughout health care providing safe and high quality patient care continues to provide significant challenges. Efforts to improve the safety and quality of care are resource intensive and take continued commitment not only by those who deliver care, but also by agencies and foundations that fund this work. Advocates for children’s health care must be at the table when key policy and regulatory issues are discussed. Only then will the voice <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>most</b> vulnerable groups of health care consumers be heard.|$|E

In a conference call interview, Pinkner and Wyman further described the episode as [...] "pretty fantastic" [...] because [...] "it's one <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>most</b> cinematic episodes". [...] "Marionette" [...] ended the episode arc begun in the season premiere, where one episode would take place entirely in one universe and then the following episode would alternate to the other; now Fringe would take place entirely in the prime universe, something that Pinkner deemed [...] "less predictable" [...] for viewers.|$|E

Tonelli's anti-authoritarian and individualistic style manifested itself during media appearances, including a news interview in which he debated with Reverend Lance Shilton, who had called the athletes traitors. Shilton expressed sympathy for the athletes, which Tonelli interpreted as condescension. He responded by rolling his eyes and twirling his finger, a gaffe that was shown on national television; Tonelli mistakenly thought that only his voice was being broadcast {{at the time and}} that the images were showing something else. Forrest said that [...] "the damage was doneone <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>most</b> prominent anti-boycott lobbyists ... looked like a smart alec".|$|E
