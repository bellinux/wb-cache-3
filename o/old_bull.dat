500|$|Marathi {{literature}} has a mixed {{reaction to the}} cult of Khandoba. Naranjanamadhva (1790) in stotra (hymn) dedicated to Khandoba calls him [...] "an illustrious king with rich clothes and a horse with a saddle studded with jewels", who was once [...] "an ascetic beggar who ride an <b>old</b> <b>bull</b> and carried an ant-bitten club (khatvanga)" [...] - a humorous take on the Puranic Shiva. In another instance (1855), he is called a ghost by a Christian missionary and Konastha Brahmin in a debate against Deshastha Brahmin. Another Brahmin remarks with scorn about the impurity of the Khandoba temple, visited by Sudras and whose priests are non-Brahmin Guravs. The Marathi term [...] "khel-khandoba", which is taken to mean [...] "devastation" [...] in general usage, refers to the possession of devotee by the god in his cult.|$|E

McCain's shift of {{political}} stances and attitudes during and especially after the 2008 presidential campaign, including his self-repudiation of the maverick label, left many writers expressing sadness and wondering {{what had happened to}} the McCain they thought they had known. [...] By 2013, some aspects of the older McCain had returned, and his image became that of a kaleidoscope of contradictory tendencies, including, as one writer listed, [...] "the maverick, the former maverick, the curmudgeon, the bridge builder, the war hero bent on transcending the call of self-interest to serve a cause greater than himself, the sore loser, <b>old</b> <b>bull,</b> last lion, loose cannon, happy warrior, elder statesman, lion in winter...." ...|$|E
2500|$|On the Road is a {{novel by}} American writer Jack Kerouac, based on the travels of Kerouac and his friends across the United States. It is {{considered}} a defining work of the postwar Beat and Counterculture generations, with its protagonists living life {{against a backdrop of}} jazz, poetry, and drug use. [...] The novel, published in 1957, is a roman à clef, with many key figures in the Beat movement, such as William S. Burroughs (<b>Old</b> <b>Bull</b> Lee), Allen Ginsberg (Carlo Marx) and Neal Cassady (Dean Moriarty) represented by characters in the book, including Kerouac himself as the narrator Sal Paradise.|$|E
40|$|Fibre type composition, {{activities}} of enzymes such as citrate synthase (CS), 3 -hydroxyacyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase (HAD), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), {{as well as}} glycogen, lactate and pH levels were analysed in muscle biopsies (m. gluteus medius) obtained after bullfighting from 10 young and 10 <b>old</b> <b>bulls.</b> No changes were seen in fibre type composition between groups, but the <b>older</b> <b>bulls</b> had higher HAD and LDH activities. Low glycogen concentrations and low pH values were found in both groups, but the lactate concentration after bullfighting was higher in the <b>older</b> group of <b>bulls.</b> The histochemical stain for glycogen revealed that type IIB fibres in both young and <b>old</b> <b>bulls</b> contained more glycogen than seen in type IIA and type I fibres. These results show that young and <b>old</b> <b>bulls</b> have similar muscle fibre type composition, but the metabolic capacity differs, with a higher glycolytic capacity and lactate production in <b>older</b> <b>bulls.</b> Furthermore, {{it seems that the}} physical and emotional stress in connection with a bullfight causes a marked depletion of glycogen, especially of type I and IIA fibres...|$|R

2500|$|Although {{the body}} of Kerouac's work has been {{published}} in English, recent research has shown that, {{in addition to his}} poetry and letters to friends and family, he also wrote unpublished works of fiction in French. [...] All these works, including La nuit est ma femme, Sur le chemin, and large sections of Maggie Cassidy (originally written in French), have now been published together in a volume entitled La vie est d'hommage (Boréal, 2016) edited by University of Pennsylvania professor Jean-Christophe Cloutier. In 1996, the Nouvelle Revue Française published excerpts and an article on [...] "La nuit est ma femme", and scholar Paul Maher Jr., in his biography Kerouac: His Life and Work', [...] discussed Sur le chemin's plot and characters. The novella, completed in five days in Mexico during December 1952, is a telling example of Kerouac's attempts at writing in his first language, a language he often called Canuck French. Kerouac refers to this short novel in a letter addressed to Neal Cassady (who is commonly known as the inspiration for the character Dean Moriarty) dated 10 January 1953. The published novel runs over 110 pages, having been reconstituted from six distinct files in the Kerouac archive by Professor Cloutier. Set in 1935, mostly on the East Coast, it explores some of the recurring themes of Kerouac's literature by way of a spoken word narrative. Here, as with most of his French writings, Kerouac writes with little regard for grammar or spelling, often relying on phonetics in order to render an authentic reproduction of the French-Canadian vernacular. Even though this work has the same title as one of his best known English novels, it is the original French version of an incomplete translation that would later become <b>Old</b> <b>Bull</b> in the Bowery (now published in The Unknown Kerouac from the Library of America). The Unknown Kerouac, edited by Todd Tietchen, includes Cloutier's translation of La nuit est ma femme and the completed translation of Sur le Chemin under the title <b>Old</b> <b>Bull</b> in the Bowery. La nuit est ma femme was written in early 1951 and completed a few days or weeks before he began the original English version of On the Road, as many scholars, such as Paul Maher Jr., Joyce Johnson, Hassan Melehy, and Yannis Livadas have pointed out.|$|E
2500|$|In December 1948 Sal {{is celebrating}} Christmas with his {{relatives}} in Testament, Virginia, when Dean shows up with Marylou (having left his second wife, Camille, and their newborn baby, Amy, in San Francisco) and Ed Dunkel. Sal's Christmas plans are shattered as [...] "now the bug was on me again, and the bug's name was Dean Moriarty." [...] First they drive to New York, where they meet Carlo and party. Dean wants Sal {{to make love}} to Marylou, but Sal declines. In Dean's Hudson they take off from New York in January 1949 and make it to New Orleans. In Algiers they stay with the morphine-addicted <b>Old</b> <b>Bull</b> Lee and his wife Jane. Galatea Dunkel joins her husband in New Orleans while Sal, Dean, and Marylou continue their trip. Once in San Francisco, Dean again leaves Marylou to be with Camille. [...] "Dean will leave you out in the cold anytime it {{is in the interest of}} him," [...] Marylou tells Sal. Both of them stay briefly in a hotel, but soon she moves out, following a nightclub owner. Sal is alone and on Market Street has visions of past lives, birth, and rebirth. Dean finds him and invites him to stay with his family. Together, they visit nightclubs and listen to Slim Gaillard and other jazz musicians. The stay ends on a sour note: [...] "what I accomplished by coming to Frisco I don't know," [...] and Sal departs, taking the bus back to New York.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{investigate}} effects of age and season on body weight, scrotal circumference and libido in 18 Nili-Ravi buffalo bulls kept at the Semen Production Unit, Qadirabad. Depending on age, these bulls were divided into three equal groups viz. young (3 - 4 years of age), adult (5 - 8 years of age) and old (12 - 15 years of age). Body weight and scrotal measurements were made at monthly intervals while libido of each bull was assessed weekly during the low (May to July) and the peak (September to November) breeding seasons. The {{results indicated that the}} body weight of adult and <b>old</b> <b>bulls</b> was higher (P< 0. 05) than young bulls. Similarly. The body weight was higher during peak than low breeding season.

40|$|Increasing {{popularity}} of wildlife viewing {{has resulted in}} a rapid increase in small, enclosed reserves in South Africa. The African elephant {{is one of the many}} species that has been reintroduced into these reserves for eco-tourism. These elephant populations were established as young (smaller that 10 years old) orphans from prior Kruger National Park culling operations. Consequently, this abnormal sex and age structure of these introduced populations has influenced their behavioural and spatial ecology. In Pilanesberg National Park, this abnormal behaviour was corrected by introducing <b>older</b> <b>bulls</b> and culling certain problem elephants. In July 2003, three <b>older</b> <b>bulls</b> (29 – 41 years old) were introduced into Phinda Private Game Reserve, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa in order to normalise the bull age structure. These introduced bulls were monitored intensively after release, as was the resident bull population, both before and after introduction of the <b>older</b> <b>bulls.</b> The introduced bulls settled into restricted ranges separate from the family groups. All the resident bulls decreased their home ranges at first, with most increasing their home ranges a year later. The resident bulls’ change in ranging patterns was due more to ecological factors than to the influence of the mature bull introduction. This study indicates that the introduction of older male elephants into small populations does not pose major risks or animal welfare concerns...|$|R
