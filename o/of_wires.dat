5|$|Development of {{distributed}} element filters {{began in}} the years before World WarII. A major paper on the subject was published by Mason and Sykes in 1937. Mason had filed a patent much earlier, in 1927, and that patent may contain the first published design which moves away from a lumped element analysis. Mason and Sykes' work was focused on the formats of coaxial cable and balanced pairs <b>of</b> <b>wires</b> – the planar technologies were not yet in use. Much development was carried out during the war years driven by the filtering needs of radar and electronic counter-measures. A good deal of this was at the MIT Radiation Laboratory, but other laboratories in the US and the UK were also involved.|$|E
5|$|During {{the last}} year of the operation, the massive scope of full {{excavation}} and raising was beginning to take its toll on those closely involved in the project. In May 1981, Alexander McKee voiced concerns about the method chosen for raising the timbers and openly questioned Margaret Rule's position as excavation leader. McKee felt ignored in what he viewed as a project where he had always played a central role, both as the initiator of the search for the Mary Rose and other ships in the Solent, and as an active member throughout the diving operations. He had several supporters who all pointed to the risk of the project's turning into an embarrassing failure if the ship were damaged during raising operations. To address these concerns it was suggested that the hull should be placed on top of a supporting steel cradle underwater. This would avoid the inherent risks of damaging the wooden structure if it were lifted out of the water without appropriate support. The idea of using nylon strops was also discarded in favour of drilling holes through the hull at 170 points and passing iron bolts through them to allow the attachment <b>of</b> <b>wires</b> connected to a lifting frame.|$|E

40|$|There the {{quantitative}} characteristics of influence of finish temperature of accelerated cooling {{on the size}} of structure members of steels have been obtained. It was showed that the appearance of martensite structures on the surface <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> rod causes the deviation from the relationship of Holl - Petch. The early temperature <b>of</b> recrystallization <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> depending on the variables of previous treatment has been determined. The optimum temperature of finish of accelerated cooling <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> rod has been determined.

50|$|Increasing gauge numbers denote {{decreasing}} wire diameters, {{which is}} similar to many other non-metric gauging systems such as SWG. This gauge system originated in the number of drawing operations used to produce a given gauge <b>of</b> <b>wire.</b> Very fine wire (for example, 30 gauge) required more passes through the drawing dies than 0 gauge <b>wire</b> did. Manufacturers <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> formerly had proprietary wire gauge systems; the development <b>of</b> standardized <b>wire</b> gauges rationalized selection <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> for a particular purpose.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The slicing {{technology}} of hard-brittle materials by endless diamond wire saw has {{the advantages of}} higher moving speed <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> saw, better slicing quality, and thin kerf. According to the strength <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> saw, the cutting force and the random vibration <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> saw, the slicing parameters are optimized. As single crystal silicon is sliced, the constant feed force is less than 10 N, the maximum pretension is 30 N, and the highest moving speed <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> saw is 24 m/s.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} the reproducibility <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> codes to characterise residential power line configurations {{and to determine}} the extent to which wire codes provide a proxy measure of residential magnetic field strength in a case-control study of childhood leukaemia conducted in nine states within the United States. METHODS: Misclassification <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> codes was assessed with independent measurements by two technicians for 187 residences. The association between categories <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> code and measured level of magnetic field was evaluated in 858 residences with both a wire code measurement and a 24 hour measurement of the magnetic field in the bedroom. The strength of the association between category <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> code and risk of leukaemia was examined in two regions with different average levels of magnetic field in homes with high categories <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> code. RESULTS: The reproducibility of any of three different classifications <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> codes was excellent (kappa > or = 0. 89). Mean and median magnetic fields, and the percentage of homes with high magnetic fields increased with increasing category for each <b>of</b> the <b>wire</b> code classification schemes. The size of the odds ratios for risk of leukaemia and high categories <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> code did not reflect the mean levels of the magnetic field in those categories in two study regions. CONCLUSION: Misclassification <b>of</b> categories <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> code is not a major source of bias in the study. Wire codes provide a proxy measure of exposure to residential magnetic fields. If magnetic fields were a risk factor for leukaemia, however, there would be some attenuation of risk estimates based on <b>wire</b> codes because <b>of</b> misclassification of exposure to magnetic fields at both extremes <b>of</b> the <b>wire</b> code range. The lack of an association between high categories <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> code and risk of leukaemia cannot be explained by a failure <b>of</b> the <b>wire</b> code classification schemes to estimate exposure to magnetic fields in the study area...|$|R
