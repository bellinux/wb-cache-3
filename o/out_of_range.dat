Because of that, there were no suitable seeding targets in either of those two seasons.|$|E

5|$|Firing {{began at}} 15:29 when Prudente {{unleashed}} a close range broadside at Centurion, followed immediately by {{fire from the}} ships of both sides. Centurion was damaged in the opening exchanges and by 16:00 had most of her sails and rigging torn. At this Renaud ordered his squadron to pull back to leeward <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>range,</b> each firing on Centurion as they passed.|$|E
5|$|The major {{side effect}} of {{warfarin}} use is bleeding. Risk of bleeding is increased if the INR is <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>range</b> (due to accidental or deliberate overdose or due to interactions). Many drug interactions can increase the effect of warfarin, also causing an overdose.|$|E
5|$|After {{the battle}} at the River Auja, the brigade camped to the {{south-east}} of Sarona, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>range</b> of the Turkish artillery. The regiment, having only sixteen officers and 375 other ranks left effective, spent the time building up its strength {{in men and}} horses. In the last month the regiment had lost twenty-seven dead and eighty-eight wounded, sixty-one had to be evacuated to the rear as they were ill and two men were missing.|$|E

5|$|After {{the initial}} ESRO program was initiated, the agency moved towards {{satellites}} {{with a higher}} orbital eccentricity and escape orbits. The facilities in Ny-Ålesund were unsuitable for telemetry with such satellites, as they would operate at a different frequency, {{the size of the}} antenna dish was too small and the ground station's geographical position was <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>range.</b> Because of the change of ESRO's focus, the need for a telemetry station on Svalbard disappeared after the termination of ESRO's initial program, and the facility was closed in 1974.|$|E
5|$|Part of {{the problem}} was that Bordeaux may not have {{appeared}} a plausible Allied target because it was <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>range</b> of fighter aircraft cover from the United Kingdom. Historian Terry Crowdy's analysis is that Ironside may have suffered simply from lack of resources. In common with other, higher-impact, Bodyguard deceptions it preyed on a concern that the Allies knew Hitler and the German High Command had discussed. Crowdy suggests that with physical deception, and more effort, Ironside could have succeeded {{in the same way as}} deceptions aimed against Calais, Normandy and the Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|Temes was {{commissioned}} into the Danube Flotilla in 1915, {{and was in}} action against the Serbian Army at Belgrade in early October, when the Serbs evacuated {{the city in the}} face of an Austro-Hungarian assault. During the final river crossing and reinforcement of the resulting bridgehead, Temes provided close support. During this task, she attempted to draw fire away from the battle-damaged monitor Enns but after receiving a direct hit in the crew quarters aft, she had to move <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>range.</b> She was run ashore to put out fires and stop leaks, before being towed out of the battle area by an armed steamer, and taken to Budapest for repairs.|$|E

5|$|The AVG {{continued}} some of {{its operations}} from Magwe, which was heavily bombed by the Japanese. Chennault ordered retaliatory raids against Chiang Mai and Lampang on 23 March 1942. Because these bases were <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>range</b> of the P-40s, from their main base at Kunming, {{it was decided to}} go via Loi Wing (Leiyun), in China, then launch the raid from the RAF airstrip at Nam Sang, Burma.|$|E
5|$|The B-70 {{was planned}} to use a high-speed, high-altitude bombing {{approach}} that followed a trend of bombers flying progressively faster and higher {{since the start of}} manned bomber use. Through that same period, only two weapons proved effective against bombers: fighter aircraft and anti-aircraft artillery (AAA). Flying higher and faster made it more difficult for both; higher speeds allowed the bomber to fly <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>range</b> of the weapons more quickly, while higher altitudes increased the time needed for fighters to climb to the bombers, and greatly increased the size of the AAA weapons needed to reach those altitudes.|$|E
5|$|The MTB had {{withdrawn}} <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>range</b> at about 01:30, {{but not before}} it had suffered engine damage; a bullet had disabled the starboard engine. After 10 minutes it moved back inshore hoping to pick up any survivors. It was again located by the Germans at about 02:30. The MTB was forced to withdraw once again under increasingly heavy mortar and machine gun fire. Unable to locate any survivors, it recrossed the German minefield and arrived back in Portsmouth at 10:00.|$|E

5|$|The only {{common side}} effect of {{warfarin}} is bleeding. The risk of severe bleeding is small but definite (a typically yearly rate of 1-3% has been reported) and any benefit needs to outweigh this risk when warfarin is considered. All types of bleeding occur more commonly, but the most severe ones are those involving the brain (intracerebral hemorrhage/hemorrhagic stroke) and the spinal cord. Risk of bleeding is increased if the INR is <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>range</b> (due to accidental or deliberate overdose or due to interactions). This risk increases greatly once the INR exceeds 4.5.|$|E
5|$|As he withdrew, Frederick {{established}} a fighting line {{north of the}} village, and it eventually served as a rallying point for stragglers and survivors. By mid-morning, around 10:00, the Prussians retreated to the north-west. Any pursuing troops were met with a wall of musket fire. Frederick and his surviving army were <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>range</b> of the Austrian army {{by the time they}} had reorganized. Hans Joachim von Zieten and Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz, who also had remained alert all night, organized a rear guard action that prevented the Austrians from falling upon the retreating Prussians. This discouraged even the most determined Austrians; the Croats and irregulars contented themselves with pillaging the village and the Prussian bodies.|$|E
5|$|At 13:00, {{two ships}} {{emerged from the}} gloom {{to the east and}} Lacrosse turned away rather than risk his {{passengers}} in a pointless engagement. The ships persisted and were soon revealed to be the frigates Indefatigable under Captain Sir Edward Pellew, and Amazon under Captain Robert Carthew Reynolds, which had taken on supplies at Falmouth and then returned to their station off Brest. As Droits de l'Homme steered southwest, the winds increased once more and the sea became choppy, preventing Lacrosse from opening the gunports on his lower deck without severe risk of flooding and snapping his topmasts, which reduced his ship's stability. Realising his opponent's difficulties, Pellew closed with the larger ship and began a heavy fire. At 18:45, Amazon came within range and the frigates combined to repeatedly rake the French ship. The combat continued throughout the night, punctuated by short breaks in which the more mobile British ships repaired their battle damage <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>range</b> of Lacrosse's guns.|$|E

5|$|By 10:00, {{all three}} French ships were {{within range of}} Centurion and a heavy {{exchange}} of fire began. Within 15 minutes, both Centurion and Marengo had their colours shot away and at 10:45 the ship of the line turned away for open water, followed by the frigates, her rigging in disarray. Damage had rendered Centurion unable to manoeuvre rapidly and she began slowly limping inshore to shelter from Marengo among the coastal shoals. Captain Lind rejoined his ship by boat, hailing the Princess Charlotte, which had still not participated in the battle, to cut her anchor cables and go ashore to avoid being captured. Logan refused and at 11:15 surrendered without a fight as the whole French squadron moved back towards the harbour. Marengo again remained beyond the sandbars that marked the entrance. The boatloads of sepoys, who were still en route to Princess Charlotte, turned about and rowed back to shore to avoid capture. Sémillante took possession of the merchant ship while Marengo and Atalante engaged Centurion, which had moved <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>range</b> {{of support from the}} shore batteries.|$|E
5|$|During {{the final}} {{battle of the}} Renommée, Saint-Cricq in Clorinde had {{remained}} <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>range</b> of the British, refusing to support his commodore. When Renommée surrendered, he made all sail to the north, abandoning both Roquebert and Néréide {{in his attempt to}} escape. Although Clorinde was closely pursued by Astraea and Phoebe until 02:00 on 21 May, the damage they had suffered prevented them from gaining on the French ship and Clorinde eventually disappeared into the darkness. During the night Schomberg gathered Phoebe, Racehorse and Astraea, and rejoined Renommée at dawn on 21 May. A prize crew of seven men was sufficient to exercise control over the French frigate until Schomberg could remove most of the French crew and replace them with British sailors the following morning. Although Galatea was still within sight at dawn, Losack was unsure of the identity of the approaching squadron and decided to sail directly to Port Louis rather than risk combat with a superior enemy force.|$|E
5|$|In 1811, Alceste {{entered the}} Adriatic and on 4–5 May, she and Belle Poule {{participated in a}} raid at Parenza, (Istria). Having chased a brig into the harbour, but unable to follow due to the rocks and shallow water, the two frigates stood outside and opened fire on her and the battery {{protecting}} her. After an hour, the brig was forced to move nearer the shore, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>range.</b> At 23:00, the British landed 200 seamen and all their marines on an island nearby, and also landed two 9-pounders and two howitzers that they placed in one battery, and a field piece that they placed further away. From there, {{they were able to}} engage the French in Parenza in a five-hour mutual bombardment. The brig was eventually destroyed and the men and cannons returned to their ships. Belle Poule had one man killed and three wounded, and Alceste had two men killed during the action. All casualties occurred ashore.|$|E
