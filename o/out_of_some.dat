Gun licenses may be obtained in a way very similar to a driving license – by passing a gun proficiency exam, medical examination and having a clean criminal record. Unlike in most other European countries, the Czech gun legislation also permits a citizen to carry a concealed weapon for self-defense – 240,000 <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> 300,000 legal gun owners have concealed carry permit. The vast majority of Czech gun owners possess their firearms for protection, with hunting and sport shooting being less common.|$|E

5|$|Gravel did {{not compete}} in the initial 2008 vote, the Iowa caucuses, but was still {{subjected}} to a false report from MSNBC that he had {{pulled out of the}} race afterward. Gravel did focus his attention on the second 2008 vote, the New Hampshire primary. There he received about 400 votes <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> 280,000 cast, or 0.14percent, before taking time off to improve his health. He resumed campaigning, but fared no better in subsequent states. By the end of January 2008, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and Gravel were the only remaining Democrats from the initial debates still running; Gravel vowed to stay in the presidential campaign until November. On March 11, 2008, Gravel continued to remain in the Democratic race but additionally endorsed a Green Party candidate for president, Jesse Johnson, saying he wanted to help Johnson prevail against Green Party rivals Cynthia McKinney and Ralph Nader. By late March, Gravel had almost no fundraising and was only on the ballot in one of the next ten Democratic primaries.|$|E
5|$|The Air Board {{subsequently}} rationalised EATS {{facilities in}} southern New South Wales, dividing {{the staff and}} aircraft of No.2 SFTS between Nos.5 and 7 Service Flying Training Schools at nearby RAAF Stations Uranquinty and Deniliquin, respectively. Eaton remained {{in command of the}} school until shortly before its disbandment on 3April 1942. No.2 SFTS had suffered a total of four serious accidents in Ansons and eleven in Wirraways, resulting in the deaths of three instructors and four students. <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> 600 entrants, just over 550 pilots graduated from the school, among them Clive Caldwell, later to become Australia's leading fighter ace of the war, and future Prime Minister John Gorton. No.60 Squadron was also disbanded on 3April, after a brief career during which its activities had been limited to training exercises. The base facilities were taken over by No.5 Aircraft Depot, responsible for maintenance of RAAF airframes, engines and other equipment.|$|E

During World War II, however, it was allowed greater autonomy in running its affairs in return for calling its members to support the war effort, although it did not achieve the kind of accommodation with the authorities that the Russian Orthodox Church had. The government reimposed tight control over it after the war. <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> 2,100 churches in 1917, only 200 were still open in the 1980s, and it was forbidden to serve its adherents outside the Georgian Republic.

25|$|Despite her {{extensive}} {{holdings in}} Jamaica, {{little or no}} income was earned from them and the Croft household was poor. In 1815, (in alternate sources, at age 75) she went to Jamaica, as she believed she was being cheated financially <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> of her husband's estates, which had produced £3000 per annum but were now yielding £400. After her return – Croft having died in April 1816 – she lived with her daughter Sophia Alderson, who was widowed. Lady Mary died in Brompton, Middlesex near London on 28 February 1821, although some sources such as McMillan specify an 1822 date of death. The discrepancy may arise out of a delay in proving Lady Mary's will, which took until 5 July 1822 to be settled in favour of Sophia and her son Lieutenant-Colonel Leslie Walker. Her son James Walker, a Royal Navy officer, achieved the rank of Rear-Admiral.|$|E
25|$|In summer 1998 a {{drinking}} water incident occurred in Amman, when water with an unpleasant smell came <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> taps. The incident became a {{tool in the}} succession struggle for the throne {{at a time when}} King Hussein lay dying. According to history professor Nigel Ashton, then-Water Minister Munther Haddadin was allied with then-Crown Prince Hassan. Hassan’s opponents exploited the incident as evidence for “negligence and corruption in high places”, forcing the Water Minister to step down because of his alleged failure to properly oversee the operation of the Zai water treatment plant that treated water brought from the Sea of Galilee and the Jordan Valley to Amman. Along with two other former water ministers, Haddadin was indicted by the State Prosecutor, but the charges were dropped after Crown Prince Hasan was sidelined in favor of King Abdullah II who succeeded his father after his death in February 1999.|$|E
25|$|Strassburg {{managed to}} {{disengage}} and escape when the battlecruisers approached but Cöln {{was not so}} fortunate. Cut off from escape she was quickly disabled by the much larger guns of the battlecruisers. She was saved from immediate sinking by the sighting of another German light cruiser, Ariadne, to which Beatty gave chase and again quickly overcame. Ariadne was left to sink, which she eventually did at 15:00, attended by the German ships Danzig and Stralsund who took off survivors. At 13:10, Beatty turned north-west and ordered all the British ships to withdraw, since the tide had now risen sufficiently for larger German ships to pass out through the Jade estuary. Passing Cöln again, he opened fire, sinking her. Attempts to rescue the crew were interrupted {{by the arrival of}} a submarine; one survivor was rescued by a German ship two days later <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> 250 who had survived the sinking.
