Humble Bundle will continue to operate as a separate entity within IGN, {{and according to the}} company, there are no plans to change their current business approach in the short-term. Instead, they see [...] "a lot of opportunities" [...] for the customer bases of both companies, according to Humble Bundle founder John Graham. [...] Graham said that the acquisition by IGN enables them to continue to do the same sales and charity promotions [...] "faster and better" [...] with IGN's resources backing them. IGN's executive vice president Mitch Galbraith said that they felt Humble Bundle was a [...] "great fit" [...] for IGN, and would also help IGN to [...] "give something back" [...] by supporting its charitable drives. As IGN publishes news and reviews of video games, Galbraith responded to several concerns about conflicts of interest, saying that they [...] "will strike the right balance when it comes to <b>our</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> Humble Bundle and the games they sell" [...] {{as a result of the}} acquisition. Among steps to avoid conflicts, Galbraith said that they will keep a firm separation between the IGN editorial staff and Humble Bundle, and will implement policies to report disclosure of ownership when IGN reports on games featured on Humble Bundle's store or promotions.|$|E

40|$|Stochastic discrete-event {{simulation}} {{has become}} one of the most-used tools for performance evaluation in science and engineering. But no innovation can replace the responsibility of simulators for obtaining credible results from their simulation experiments. In this paper we address the problem of the statistical correctness of simulation output data analysis, in the context of sequential steady-state stochastic simulation, conducted for studying long run behaviour of stable systems. Such simulations are stopped as soon as the relative precision of estimates, defined as the relative half-width of confidence intervals at a specified confidence level, reaches the required level. We formulate basic rules for the proper experimental analysis <b>of</b> the <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> steady-state interval estimators. Our main argument is that such an analysis should be done sequentially. The numerical results <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>coverage</b> analysis <b>of</b> the method of Non-overlapping Batch Means and Spectral Analysis are presented, and compared with those obtained by the traditional, non-sequential approach. Two scenarios for stochastic simulation are considered: traditional sequential simulation on a single processor, and fast concurrent simulation based on Multiple Replications in Parallel (MRIP), with multiple processors cooperating in the production of output data...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{compose a}} new task for deep {{argumentative}} structure analysis {{that goes beyond}} shallow discourse structure analysis. The idea is that argumentative relations can reasonably be represented with a small set of predefined patterns. For example, using value judgment and bipolar causality, we can explain a support relation between two argumentative segments as follows: Segment 1 states that something is good, and Segment 2 states that it is good because it promotes something good when it happens. We are motivated by the following questions: (i) how do we formulate the task?, (ii) can a reasonable pattern set be created?, and (iii) do the patterns work? To examine the task feasibility, we conduct a three-stage, detailed annotation study using 357 argumentative relations from the argumentative microtext corpus, a small, but highly reliable corpus. We report the <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> explanations captured by our patterns on a test set composed <b>of</b> 270 relations. <b>Our</b> <b>coverage</b> result <b>of</b> 74. 6 % indicates that argumentative relations can reasonably be explained by our small pattern set.

40|$|There {{has been}} no {{comparable}} attempt at a comprehensive history of metaphysical idealism for over 70 years, and this book, ranging from Parmenides to Deleuze, exceeds all previous work in size and scope. It also puts forward arguments that are important, and controversial. Firstly, it presents compelling evidence that idealism begins much earlier than is commonly argued. Secondly we show that idealism is not a reductive metaphysics, but an inflationary one - a 'realism {{with respect to the}} idea'. This, contrary to many accounts, makes idealism compatible with naturalism, the sciences, and even many forms of materialism. Indeed we include detailed accounts of the work of contemporary biologists and physicists who's work is demonstrably idealist. Metaphysical idealism is currently at the centre not only of debates within continental philosophy, but is enjoying a great resurgence within the analytic tradition (as is evidenced by <b>our</b> own <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> McDowell, Brandom etc.).

As a consequence of all this effort, valuable trajectory and orbital data of meteors and fireballs is being obtained. We focus here in a description of recorded activity of cometary meteor showers also including orbital information of one of the brightest fireballs observed last year.

40|$|What {{institutional}} configurations influence fertility patterns across countries? While family policies feature {{prominently in}} previous explanations, this article {{highlights the importance}} of housing in shaping family formation decisions. Housing costs, determined by state and market factors, directly compete with spending on children, prompting tradeoffs between the two. Housing further influences fertility by shaping transition decisions into parenthood, which in turn alter fertility behavior. This article provides the logic and empirical evidence linking housing to fertility both directly and indirectly. Direct links are examined through a Poisson regression model. Indirect links are tested through sets of bivariate statistics. Austria, Germany, France, and Italy serve as the primary test cases, with reference to other rich OECD countries. The findings suggest that the literature suffers from omitted variable bias: to understand fertility patterns we must broaden <b>our</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> institutional variables to include housing...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Future Low Earth Orbit (LEO) {{satellite}} {{networks are}} envisioned as distributed architectures of autonomous data processing nodes. Such ad hoc networks should deliver reliable communication channels for control commands and data among ground stations and satellites minimizing delay and power.

Next, we propose a cross-layer protocol architecture that includes three cross-layer optimizations: simple integrated MAC/PHY layer, novel Balanced Predictable Routing (BPR) and a dedicated QoS aware TCP sliding window control mechanism. They all contribute to the end-to-end delays improvement and successful delivery increase. It also fulfills the QoS requirements.

40|$|Abstract. For model-based black-box testing, {{test cases}} are often {{selected}} from the syntactic appearance of the specification of the system under test, according to a pre-given test data adequacy criterion. We introduce a novel approach that is semantics-based, independent of the syntactic appearance of the system specification. Basically, we model the system under test as a random variable, whose sample space consists of all possible behavior sets (with respect to the specification) over the known interface of the black-box. The entropy {{of the system is}} measured as the (Shannon) entropy of the random variable. In <b>our</b> criterion, the <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> a test set is measured as the expected amount of entropy decrease (i. e., the expected amount of information gained) once the test set is run. Since our criterion is syntactic independent, we study the notion of information-optimal software testing where, within a given constraint, a test set is selected to gain the most information...|$|R
