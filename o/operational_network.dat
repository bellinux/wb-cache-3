40|$|In <b>operational</b> <b>networks,</b> {{services}} are delivered according to specific Service Level Agreements (SLAs). To ensure the SLAs stipulated with the users, providers {{make use of}} traffic monitoring and measurement tools controlling their highspeed IP networks. In order to improve the scalability of the measurement systems, techniques which allow to reduce {{the total amount of}} data to be collected and processed are currently being standardized in the IETF Packet Sampling (PSAMP) Working Group. Among packet sampling techniques, hash-based one is the only capable of providing a feasible framework to monitor One-Way Delays (OWDs). This paper is focused on the experimental validation of SLAs conformance in <b>operational</b> <b>networks</b> using hash-based packet sampling techniques. The results presented hereafter are obtained from the analysis of traffic traces collected at two different points of <b>operational</b> <b>networks.</b> Such results are fundamental to validate the whole hash-based packet sampling framework, because they complement the already available results on the uniformity of distribution, computation speed and statistical properties of the hash functions calculated by using single point traces...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Link and node {{failures}} are {{two common}} fundamental problems that affect <b>operational</b> <b>networks.</b> Hence, protection of communication networks against such failures {{is essential for}} maintaining network reliability and performance. Network protection codes (NPC) are proposed to protect <b>operational</b> <b>networks</b> against link and node failures. Furthermore, encoding and decoding operations of such codes are well developed over binary and finite fields. Finding network topologies, practical scenarios, and limits on graphs applicable for NPC are of interest. In this paper, we establish limits on network protection codes and investigate several network graphs where NPC can be deployed. Furthermore, we construct graphs with minimum number of edges suitable for network protection codes deployment. I...|$|R

Vayudoot quickly established hubs at Bombay (now Mumbai), Delhi, Madras (now Chennai), and Hyderabad.

The lack of adequate traffic to sustain operations on all these routes adversely affected the company's financial performance. After a review, the number of stations on the <b>operational</b> <b>network</b> was brought down to 48 on 31 March 1991.

Data can flow through NISN two ways: using the Internet Protocol <b>Operational</b> <b>Network</b> (IPONET) or the High Data Rate System (HDRS). IPONET uses the TCP/IP protocol common to all computers connected to the Internet, and is a standard way to ship data. The High Data Rate System transports data rates from 2 Mbit/s to 48 Mbit/s, for specialized missions requiring {{a high rate of}} data transfer. HDRS does not require the infrastructure of routers, switches and gateways to send its data forward like IPONET.|$|E
