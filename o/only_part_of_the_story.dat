25|$|Since the {{regulation}} of iron metabolism is still poorly understood, a clear model of how haemochromatosis operates is still not available. A working model describes the defect in the HFE gene, where a mutation puts the intestinal absorption of iron into overdrive. Normally, HFE facilitates the binding of transferrin, which is iron's carrier protein in the blood. Transferrin levels are typically elevated at times of iron depletion (low ferritin stimulates the release of transferrin from the liver). When transferrin is high, HFE works to increase the intestinal release of iron into the blood. When HFE is mutated, the intestines perpetually interpret a strong transferrin signal as if the body were deficient in iron. This leads to maximal iron absorption from ingested foods and iron overload in the tissues. However, HFE is <b>only</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story,</b> since many patients with mutated HFE do not manifest clinical iron overload, and some patients with iron overload have a normal HFE genotype. A possible explanation {{is the fact that}} HFE normally plays a role in the production of hepcidin in the liver, a function that is impaired in HFE mutations.|$|E
500|$|In a {{negative}} review in The Sunday Telegraph, historian Noel Malcolm suggested that Dalrymple [...] "is spreading his net too widely, so that 'sentimentality' comes {{to stand for}} any moralising view that does not satisfy his own scrutiny; it's not that these things should not be criticised, merely that sentimentalism {{may not be the}} key to what is wrong with them". Malcolm also questioned Dalrymple's views on modern educational theory, writing [...] "these ideas have long and complex histories, in which sentimentalism is <b>only</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story.</b> The 'progressive' attack on discipline, and on traditional institutions such as the family, was concerned as much with power-structures and class as it ever was with sentiment or human goodness", and took issue with Dalrymple's assessment of Rousseau. [...] In a short negative review of the book in The Independent on Sunday, which appeared after the book's 2011 paperback release, Brandon Robshaw wrote, [...] "There is some good sense here, but it's vitiated by the pompous, peevish tone, the futile nostalgia for an airbrushed past, unnecessary sideswipes (at John Rawls, for example, or climate science) and by the poor editing". In an ambivalent review on the website MercatorNet, Francis Phillips wrote [...] "The book leaves one with the impression that it is a somewhat hotchpotch compendium of views and articles already well rehearsed by the author—though nonetheless true for all that. What is disheartening is his bleak attitude towards human nature; having diagnosed the disease he is at a loss to suggest a remedy".|$|E

2500|$|Nixon {{hoped that}} the move would bolster both {{the image of his}} {{administration}} and the United States as a whole. [...] He also wanted to score points with the Democratic majority in Congress and he had chosen to do this through various arms control measures. Nixon knew Democrats could not afford to oppose his renunciation of BW programs in light of rising opposition to the use of non-lethal chemicals in Vietnam and other events such as the Skull Valley sheep kill in Utah. Thus, the idealistic language Nixon used in his November statement was <b>only</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story.</b> Besides the issue of proliferation raised by Meselson, the specter of growing dissent over Vietnam loomed large, as did the fact that the U.S. had never ratified the Geneva Protocol.

50|$|Petronio's {{communication}} privacy management (CPM) {{theory is}} built on Altman's dialecticalconception of privacy {{as a process of}} opening and closing a boundary to others. Altman and Taylor's social penetration theory focused on self-disclosure as the primary way to develop close relationships. However, openness is <b>only</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story.</b> We also have a desire for privacy. When Petronio first developed this theory in 1991, it was called communication boundary management. In 2002, she renamed it to communication privacy management, underscoring private disclosure is the main thrust of the theory.|$|E
