5|$|European {{dominance}} was at {{the forefront}} of United's agenda during the 1997–98 season. Having failed to take their chances in a semi-final against eventual champions Borussia Dortmund in 1996–97, Ferguson was resolute to go <b>one</b> <b>step</b> <b>further</b> and emulate Matt Busby's success of 1968, quashing any talk that his team was not good enough.|$|E
5|$|He uses {{overlapping}} forms {{rather than}} a single form or distinct adjacent forms, which seems {{to create a more}} dynamic feel to the shallow space. However, since Lichtenstein does not uses shading or contrast, the monochromatic strokes with just bold black outlines are void of certain elements of depth. Big Painting No. 6 and Yellow and Green Brushstrokes go <b>one</b> <b>step</b> <b>further</b> in terms of canvas size and dynamic activity that was presented earlier in Little Big Painting.|$|E
5|$|In 2013 García, while {{representing}} Spain's U17 side, {{was awarded}} the Golden Boot award at the 2013 UEFA Women's Under-17 Championship, ending the tournament as the top goalscorer and only player to have scored more than once. Spain were ultimately eliminated by Sweden in the semi-finals but ended the tournament in third after beating Belgium in the third place playoff.

50|$|The {{ancestors}} of the alveolate group may have been photosynthetic. The ancestral alveolate probably possessed a plastid. Chromerids, apicomplexans, and peridinin dinoflagellates have retained this organelle. Going <b>one</b> <b>step</b> even <b>further</b> back, the chromerids, the peridinin dinoflagellates and the heterokont algae possess a monophyletic plastid lineage in common, i.e. acquired their plastids from a red alga, and so {{it seems likely that}} the common ancestor of alveolates and heterokonts was also photosynthetic.|$|R

Adam is determined to take things <b>one</b> <b>step</b> <b>further</b> with Tina so they can move in with one another, though she doesn't want to rush things and especially not with David now living with Adam and Matthew following his divorce from Robyn. Pete has landed on his feet as a chauffeur, and Jenny is finding herself seeing a lot less of her husband. Matthew's relationship with Olivia is taken to the next level, to the shock of Karen and Adam.|$|E

5|$|Although {{designed}} {{by one of}} Square's development teams in Japan, Final Fantasy Mystic Quest was specifically geared for the U.S. market. At the time, console role-playing games were not a major genre in North America; Square thus attempted to broaden the genre's appeal through Final Fantasy Mystic Quest. Square had already released several Final Fantasy spinoffs in North America, including the first three titles in the SaGa series as Final Fantasy Legend, and the first Mana series game as Final Fantasy Adventure, and wished to further break into the popular American consciousness. Square's executives cited the alleged difficulty of RPGs as the reason Americans shied away from them, and eased the difficulty level by tweaking {{various aspects of the}} main series' gameplay. The American release of Final Fantasy IV was altered to make the game simpler, for example. Mystic Quest was to take this <b>one</b> <b>step</b> <b>further,</b> and the Japanese developers worked with the American offices to make sure the game was accessible to children.|$|E

40|$|The {{question}} of the allocation of public R&D funding is becoming particularly important {{when it comes to}} identifying the effects of state subsidies, in terms of input or output additionality. This analysis goes <b>one</b> important <b>step</b> <b>further</b> than the existing literature by including the time dimension. Using firm-level data on German manufacturing and knowledge-intensive service firms, this paper sheds light on the structure of the subsidy recipients over time. It turns out that participation in the funding scheme is quite stable. This is also confirmed by applying a multivariate approach. Firms having received funding in the past {{are more likely to be}} selected for public funding again. It is also important to control for the overall supply of subsidies. Besides, a firm’s size and knowledge capabilities increase the probability of entering the scheme...|$|R
40|$|The current {{practice}} in medically assisted reproduction {{is still too}} exclusively focused on effectiveness and success rates. This {{has a number of}} considerable, and more importantly, avoidable drawbacks. Single embryo transfer was an important move away from this model to include safety and welfare of mother and child. Patient-friendly ART goes <b>one</b> big <b>step</b> <b>further.</b> It is composed of a mix of four criteria: cost-effectiveness, equity of access, minimal risk for mother and child and minimal burden for patients. All four components have a strong normative ethical basis: cost-effectiveness relies on the optimal use of community resources to maximise well-being; equity of access is based on justice, minimal risk is founded on the fundamental non-maleficence rule and minimal burden is largely based on the autonomy principle. The inclusion of the four criteria in decision-making about treatment would express these values in clinical practice...|$|R

40|$|The {{first class}} based {{adaptation}} approaches [FGH + 97, Ueb 97] take {{the use of}} classes {{in the construction of}} statistical m-gram models <b>one</b> significant <b>step</b> <b>further</b> than just using them as a smoothing technique: The m-gram of classes is trained on the large background corpus while the word likelihoods given the class are estimated on the small target corpus.

In this paper we extend class adaptation {{to make use of the}} m-gram distribution of the target domain. As a second independent contribution this paper introduces an efficient morphing algorithm, that tries to achieve adaptation by using a stochastic mapping of words between the vocabularies of the respective domains. As a result we can show, that for small adaptation steps class based adaptation is a very useful technique. For larger adaptation steps the perplexity of the modified model is greatly improved, yet no improvement o [...] ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Scattering-type {{scanning}} near-field {{optical microscopy}} (s-SNOM) and Fourier transform infrared nanospectroscopy (nano-FTIR) are emerging tools for nanoscale chemical material identification. Here, we push s-SNOM and nano-FTIR <b>one</b> important <b>step</b> <b>further</b> by {{enabling them to}} quantitatively measure local dielectric constants and infrared absorption. Our technique {{is based on an}} analytical model, which allows for a simple inversion of the near-field scattering problem. It yields the dielectric permittivity and absorption of samples with 2 orders of magnitude improved spatial resolution compared to far-field measurements and is applicable to a large class of samples including polymers and biological matter. We verify the capabilities by determining the local dielectric permittivity of a PMMA film from nano-FTIR measurements, which is in excellent agreement with far-field ellipsometric data. We further obtain local infrared absorption spectra with unprecedented accuracy in peak position and shape, which is the key to quantitative chemometrics on the nanometer scale.
