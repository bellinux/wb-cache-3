The pathobiochemical mechanism of this toxic heavy metal is related to oxidative stress. This study investigated whether Cleistocalyx nervosum var. paniala fruit extract (CNFE) could protect the kidney against oxidative injury caused by cadmium. Initial analysis of the extract revealed antioxidant abilities {{and high levels of}} polyphenols, particularly catechin. Its potential renal benefits was further explored in rats treated with vehicle, CNFE, cadmium (2 mg/kg), and cadmium plus CNFE (0. 5, 1, 2 g/kg) for four weeks. Oxidative renal injury was developed after cadmium exposure as evidenced by blood urea nitrogen and creatinine retention, glomerular filtration reduction, renal structural damage, together with increased nitric oxide and malondialdehyde, but decreased antioxidant thiols, superoxide dismutase, and catalase in renal tissues. Cadmium-induced nephrotoxicity was diminished in rats supplemented with CNFE, particularly at the doses of 1 and 2 g/kg. It is concluded that CNFE is able to protect against the progression of cadmium nephrotoxicity, mostly via its antioxidant power. The results also point towards a promising role for this naturally-occurring antioxidant to combat <b>other</b> <b>human</b> <b>disorders</b> elicited by disruption of redox homeostasis...|$|E

This treatment prevented the rapid phagocytosis and intravascular hemolysis of donor erythrocytes that usually follow a heterologous transfusion. Both immediate after transfusion recovery and survival of 51 Cr-labeled sickle erythrocytes were decreased in comparison to the values obtained for control erythrocytes from individuals without sickle-cell anemia. Survival of sickle erythrocytes was improved during exposure of the animals to 100 % O 2.

40|$|Severe {{mitochondria}} deficiency {{leads to}} a number of devastating degenerative disorders, yet, mild mitochondrial dysfunction in different species, including the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, can have pro-longevity effects. This apparent paradox indicates that cellular adaptation to partial mitochondrial stress can induce beneficial responses, but how this is achieved is largely unknown. Complete absence of frataxin, the mitochondrial protein defective in patients with Friedreich's ataxia, is lethal in C. elegans, while its partial deficiency extends animal lifespan in a p 53 dependent manner. In this paper we provide further insight into frataxin control of C. elegans longevity by showing that a substantial reduction of frataxin protein expression is required to extend lifespan, affect sensory neurons functionality, remodel lipid metabolism and trigger autophagy. We find that Beclin and p 53 genes are required to induce autophagy and concurrently reduce lipid storages and extend animal lifespan in response to frataxin suppression. Reciprocally, frataxin expression modulates autophagy in the absence of p 53. Human Friedreich ataxia-derived lymphoblasts also display increased autophagy, indicating an evolutionarily conserved response to reduced frataxin expression. In sum, we demonstrate a causal connection between induction of autophagy and lifespan extension following reduced frataxin expression, thus providing the rationale for investigating autophagy in the pathogenesis and treatment of Friedreich's ataxia and possibly <b>other</b> <b>human</b> mitochondria-associated <b>disorders...</b>|$|R
40|$|Objective: To review {{publications}} {{relating to}} the blocking of interleukin 1 (IL 1) as a strategy for treat-ing human disease, ranging from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) to Alzheimer’s disease. Methods: The National Library of Medicine’s PubMed database was searched for articles about phar-maceutical agents that reduce the biological actions of IL 1. Results: Fish oils and corticosteroids were identified as non-selective pharmacological interventions that reduce the activity of IL 1, whereas a recombinant human IL 1 receptor antagonist (anakinra) and a soluble recombinant type I IL 1 receptor act selectively. To date, anakinra is the only selective interven-tion that {{has been shown in}} controlled clinical trials to be effective and well tolerated in the treatment of a specific human disorder, RA. In controlled clinical trials, anakinra provided significant clinical improvement and slowed radiographic disease progression in patients with active RA. Moreover, addition of anakinra to existing methotrexate treatment significantly reduced signs and symptoms of active disease. Conclusions: The clinical use of anakinra has been demonstrated in the management of RA, but blocking of IL 1 in <b>other</b> <b>human</b> <b>disorders,</b> as well as the safety of the use of these blocking agents in chronic diseases, still needs to be defined by controlled clinical investigations...|$|E

Molecular targeted therapies have not been widely used for SCLL. Ponatinib (AP 24534), that potently inhibits native and mutant BCR-ABL, also targets the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) family. Using murine BaF 3 cells stably transformed with six different FGFR 1 fusion genes, as well as human KG 1 cells expressing activated chimeric FGFR 1 and five newly established murine SCLL cell lines, we show that Ponatinib (< 50 nM) can effectively inhibit phosphoactivation of the fusion kinases and their downstream effectors, such as PLCγ, Stat 5 and Src. Ponatinib also significantly extended survival of mice transplanted with different SCLL cell lines. Ponatinib administered at 30 mg/kg daily also significantly delayed, or even prevented, tumorigenesis of KG 1 cells in xenotransplanted mice. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Ponatinib specifically inhibits cell growth and clonogenicity of normal human CD 34 + progenitor cells transformed by chimeric FGFR 1 fusion kinases.

Furthermore, involvement of proteasomal system represents a common feature {{of virtually all}} inclusions. Multiple aggregates contain intermediate filament proteins as their major constituents. Among them, Mallory–Denk bodies (MDBs) are the best studied. MDBs represent hepatic inclusions observed in diverse chronic liver diseases such as alcoholic and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, chronic cholestasis, metabolic disorders and hepatocellular neoplasms. MDBs are induced in mice fed griseofulvin or 3, 5 -diethoxycarbonyl- 1, 4 -dihydrocollidine and resolve after discontinuation of toxin administration. The availability of a drug-induced model makes MDBs a unique tool for studying inclusion formation. Our review summarizes the recent advances gained from this model and shows how they relate to observations in other aggregates. The MDB formation-underlying mechanisms include protein misfolding, chaperone alterations, disproportional protein expression with keratin 8 >keratin 18 levels and subsequent keratin 8 crosslinking via transglutaminase. p 62 presence is crucial for MDB formation.

We evaluated the effectiveness of fluorescent single-strand conformation polymorphism (F-SSCP), denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) and sequencing based mutation detection in the molecular diagnosis of MODY. Our goal is to identify a rapid, efficient and cost effective mutation detection method for the molecular diagnosis of MODY and <b>other</b> <b>human</b> genetic <b>disorders.</b> METHODS: We evaluated the accuracy of DHPLC in screening for MODY 2 and 3 mutations. In addition, we compared the sensitivity, specificity, cost, handling time and analysis time of fluorescent single-strand conformation polymorphism, denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and direct sequencing screening methods. RESULTS: Denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography is a recently developed method for mutation detection. It is cost effective, powerful and reliable and quite suitable for 22 out of the 24 fragments required for MODY 2 and 3 testing. However, exons 1 and 7 of the HNF- 1 alpha gene are very polymorphic and so direct sequencing is faster {{as well as more}} efficient and reliable. CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that combining denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and direct sequencing is a good approach for the routine detection of HNF- 1 alpha and GCK mutations in MODY families.

40|$|Mutations {{that affect}} the {{splicing}} of pre-mRNA are {{a major cause of}} human disease. Familial dysautonomia (FD) is a recessive neurodegenerative disease caused by a T to C transition at base pair 6 of IKBKAP intron 20. This mutation results in variable tissue-specific skipping of exon 20. Previously, we reported that the plant cytokinin kinetin dramatically increases exon 20 inclusion in RNA isolated from cultured FD cells. The goal of the current study was to investigate the nature of the FD splicing defect and the mechanism by which kinetin improves exon inclusion, as such knowledge will facilitate the development of future therapeutics aimed at regulating mRNA splicing. In this study, we demonstrate that treatment of FD lymphoblast cell lines with kinetin increases IKBKAP mRNA and IKAP protein to normal levels. Using a series of minigene constructs, we show that deletion of a region at the end of IKBKAP exon 20 disrupts the ability of kinetin to improve exon inclusion, pinpointing a kinetin responsive sequence element. We next performed a screen of endogenously expressed genes with multiple isoforms resulting from exon skipping events and show that kinetin's ability to improve exon inclusion is not limited to IKBKAP. Lastly, we highlight the potential of kinetin for the treatment of <b>other</b> <b>human</b> splicing <b>disorders</b> by showing correction of a splicing defect in neurofibromatosis...|$|R

In contrast, {{the involvement of}} two {{other members of the}} synuclein family, b-synuclein and g-synuclein, in the development and progression of neurodegeneration is poorly studied. However, there is a growing body of evidence that a-synuclein and b-synuclein have opposite neuropathophysiological effects. Unlike a-synuclein, overexpressed b-synu-clein does not cause pathological changes in the nervous system of transgenic mice and even ameliorates the pathology caused by overexpressed a-synuclein. To assess the consequences of excess expression of the third family member, g-synuclein, on the nervous system we generated transgenic mice expressing high levels of mouse g-synuclein under control of Thy- 1 promoter. These animals develop severe age- and transgene dose-dependent neuropathology, motor deficits and die prematurely. Histopathological changes include aggregation of g-synuclein, accumulation of various inclusions in neuronal cell bodies and pro-cesses, and astrogliosis. These changes are seen throughout the nervous system but are most prominent in the spinal cord where they lead to loss of spinal motor neurons. Our data suggest that down-regulation of small heat shock protein HSPB 1 and disintegration of neurofilament network play a role in motor neurons dysfunction and death. These findings demonstrate that g-synuclein can be involved in neuropathophysio-logical changes and the death of susceptible neurons suggesting the necessity of further investigations of the potential role of this synuclein in disease...|$|E
40|$|Summary When skin is wounded, {{migration}} of epidermal keratinocytes at the wound edge initiates within hours, whereas {{migration of}} dermal fibroblasts toward the wounded area remains undetectable until several days later. This “cell type traffic” regulation ensures proper healing of the wound, as disruptions of the regulation could either cause delay of wound healing or result in hypertrophic scars. TGFβ 3 {{is the critical}} traffic controller that selectively halts migration of the dermal, but not epidermal, cells to ensure completion of wound re-epithelialization prior to wound remodeling. However, the mechanism of TGFβ 3 's anti-motility signaling has never been investigated. We report here that activated TβRII transmits the anti-motility signal of TGFβ 3 in full to TβRI, since expression of the constitutively activated TβRI-TD mutant was sufficient to replace TGFβ 3 to block PDGF-bb-induced dermal fibroblast migration. Second, the three components of R-Smad complex are all required. Individual downregulation of Smad 2, Smad 3 or Smad 4 prevented TGFβ 3 from inhibiting dermal fibroblast migration. Third, Protein Kinase Array allowed us to identify the protein kinase A (PKA) as a specific downstream effector of R-Smads in dermal fibroblasts. Activation of PKA alone blocked PDGF-bb-induced dermal fibroblast migration, just like TGFβ 3. Downregulation of PKA's catalytic subunit nullified the anti-motility signaling of TGFβ 3. This is the first report on anti-motility signaling mechanism by TGFβ family cytokines. Significance of this finding is not only limited to wound healing but also to <b>other</b> <b>human</b> <b>disorders,</b> such as heart attack and cancer, where the diseased cells have often managed to avoid the anti-motility effect of TGFβ...|$|E
40|$|Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an {{emerging}} therapy {{for the treatment}} of cancer and various <b>other</b> <b>human</b> <b>disorders.</b> 5 -Aminolaevulinic acid (ALA) is a simple natural product that is of great interest for PDT because it can be converted within cells via the haem biosynthetic pathway to the photosensitiser, protoporphyrin IX (PpIX). ALA-PDT has become a first line clinical approach {{for the treatment of}} cancerous and precancerous skin lesions (e. g Bowen’s disease, basal skin carcinomas, and actinic keratosis) that would otherwise require significant conventional surgery. However, ALA being a zwitterion suffers from poor lipid solubility {{and at the same time}} has stability issues at physiological or alkaline pH. The work herein describes some novel strategies to enhance the delivery of ALA to specific cell types using targeted ALA dendrimeric prodrugs. Specifically, it describes the synthesis of molecules consisting of branched units with 3 or more copies of ALA attached to a central core structure (e. g. gallic acid) using copper-catalysed azide-alkyne click chemistry (CuAAC). Selective delivery of the dendrimeric ALA cargo was achieved by attachment of a homing peptide to an independently addressable functional group on the prodrug core. As proof of concept of this approach, systems were prepared containing a peptide that allows selective targeting of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) which is overexpressed in a variety of tumours. Targeted ALA delivery and PpIX production was studied with these prodrugs in EGFR-expressing breast adenocarcinoma cells (MDA-MB- 231 cells) and a peptide-targeted derivative with 9 ALA units was found to have enhanced PDT efficacy compared to an equimolar dose of ALA. Other targeting units that have been attached to these dendrimeric ALA prodrugs include biomolecules such as vitamin E, thymidine (a nucleoside) and a glucose derivative. Additionally, strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloadditions (SPAAC) of the same EGFR-targeting peptide with some classical photosensitisers were also investigated and biological studies in EGFR-overexpressing cell lines were carried out. Lastly, a group of cell penetrating peptide-ALA conjugates have been synthesised via CuAAC as a novel approach for targeted ALA delivery...|$|E
40|$|The S 100 A 4 {{protein is}} {{reported}} as a pivotal {{player in the}} tumor microenvironment with a metastasis-promoting function. Moreover, the upregulation of S 100 A 4 is found in <b>other</b> non-malignant <b>human</b> <b>disorders</b> as cardiac and pulmonary systems and rheumatoid arthritis. In this study, we investigated the expression and significance of S 100 A 4 in psoriasis. We found significant upregulation of S 100 A 4 in the dermis of psoriatic skin compared with normal skin. This pattern of S 100 A 4 expression differs considerably from that of other S 100 proteins, S 100 A 7 and S 100 A 8 / 9, with predominant expression in the epidermis of psoriasis. Furthermore, we revealed a massive release of the biologically active forms of S 100 A 4 from psoriatic skin. Interestingly, we found stabilization (increase) of p 53 in the basal layer of epidermis {{in close proximity to}} cells expressing S 100 A 4. To examine the possible implication of S 100 A 4 in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, we analyzed the effect of S 100 A 4 blocking antibodies in a human psoriasis xenograft SCID mouse model and observed a significant reduction of the epidermal thickness and impairment in cell proliferation and dermal vascularization. In conclusion, we showed strong upregulation and release of S 100 A 4 in the upper dermis of psoriatic skin and found evidence indicating that S 100 A 4 might actively contribute to the pathogenesis of psoriasis...|$|R
40|$|This PA {{is a new}} {{initiative}} to support research to understand how mutations in the gene for lamin A/C affect nuclear structure, thus leading to bothdysfunction of the nuclear envelope, and depending on the mutation, Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome in humans (Eriksson et al., manuscript in preparation). Lamins A and C are coded by a single developmentally regulated gene designated LMNA; lamin C is a splice variant and lacks the carboxyl terminus present in lamin A. At least 6 <b>other</b> rare <b>human</b> <b>disorders</b> due to lamin A/C mutations (known collectively as laminopathies) besides HGS have been described so far: Emery–Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (Bonne et al., 1999), dilated cardiomyopathy (Fatkin et al., 1999), familial partial lipodystrophy (Shackleton et al., 2000), limb girdle muscular dystrophy (Muchir et al., 2000), Charcot Marie-Tooth disorder type 2 (De Sandre-Giovanni et al., 2002), and mandibuloacral dysplasia (Novelli et al., 2002). These disorders {{and their relationship to}} LMNA mutations have been reviewed recently {Burke and Stewart (2002) }, and Hutchinson (2002) has reviewed the function of lamins in the nuclear envelope. This PA will use the National Institutes of Health (NIH) research project grant R 01 award mechanism. As an applicant, you will be solely responsible for planning, directing, and executing the proposed project. Contact the program staff listed under “inquiries ” for further information. This PA uses just-intime concepts. It also uses the modular as well as the non-modular budgeting formats (se...|$|R
40|$|Genome-wide {{analysis}} of distributions of densities of long-range interactions of human chromosomes with each other, nucleoli, nuclear lamina, and binding sites of chromatin state regulatory proteins, CTCF and STAT 1, identifies non-random highly correlated patterns of density distributions along the chromosome length {{for all these}} features. Marked co-enrichments and clustering of all these interactions are detected at discrete genomic regions on selected chromosomes, which are located within pericentromeric heterochromatin and designated Centromeric Regions of Interphase Chromatin Homing (CENTRICH). CENTRICH manifest 199 - 716 -fold higher density of inter-chromosomal binding sites compared to genome-wide or chromosomal averages (p = 2. 10 E- 101 - 1. 08 E- 292). Sequence alignment analysis shows that CENTRICH represent unique DNA sequences of 3. 9 to 22. 4 Kb in size which are: 1) associated with nucleolus; 2) exhibit highly diverse set of DNA-bound chromatin state regulators, including marked enrichment of CTCF and STAT 1 binding sites; 3) bind multiple intergenic disease-associated genomic loci (IDAGL) with documented long-range enhancer activities and established links to increased risk of developing epithelial malignancies and <b>other</b> common <b>human</b> <b>disorders.</b> Using distances of SNP loci homing sites within genomic coordinates of CENTRICH as a proxy of likelihood of disease-linked SNP loci binding to CENTRICH, we demonstrate statistically significant correlations between the probability of SNP loci binding to CENTRICH and GWAS-defined odds ratios of increased risk of a disease for cancer, coronary artery disease, and type 2 diabetes. Our analysis suggests that centromeric sequences and pericentromeric heterochromatin may {{play an important role}} in human cells beyond the critical functions in chromosome segregation...|$|R
