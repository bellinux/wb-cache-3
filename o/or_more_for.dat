5|$|The all-time goalscoring {{record is}} held by Len Davies, who had a twelve-year spell at Cardiff between 1919 and 1931, scoring 179 times. Seven other players have scored 100 goals <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>for</b> the club. Robert Earnshaw is the most recent player to reach the mark and also holds the club record for goals in a single season, scoring 35 during 2002–03.

5|$|Queens Park Rangers' record appearance-maker is Tony Ingham, {{who made}} 555 {{appearances}} in his QPR career between 1950 and 1963. Nine other players have {{made more than}} 400 appearances, the most recent being Kevin Gallen, who has made the ninth-highest number of appearances with 414 matches, scoring 104 goals in the process. George Goddard is the club's top goalscorer with 186 goals in his seven years with the club. Other than Goddard and Gallen, only Brian Bedford, Rodney Marsh and Don Givens have scored more than 100 goals for the club.

5|$|Upon {{anatomical}} study, {{the penis}} {{can be described}} as a clitoris that has been mostly pulled out of the body and grafted on top of a significantly smaller piece of spongiosum containing the urethra. With regard to nerve endings, the human clitoris's estimated 8,000 <b>or</b> <b>more</b> (<b>for</b> its glans or clitoral body as a whole) is commonly cited as being twice as many as the nerve endings found in the human penis (for its glans or body as a whole), and as more than any other part of the human body. These reports sometimes conflict with other sources on clitoral anatomy or those concerning the nerve endings in the human penis. For example, while some sources estimate that the human penis has 4,000 nerve endings, other sources state that the glans or the entire penile structure have the same amount of nerve endings as the clitoral glans, or discuss whether the uncircumcised penis has thousands more than the circumcised penis or is generally more sensitive.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{approach}} of GWA studies is the case-control setup, which compares two {{large groups of}} individuals, one healthy control group and one case group affected by a disease. All individuals in each group are genotyped {{for the majority of}} common known SNPs. The exact number of SNPs depends on the genotyping technology, but are typically one million <b>or</b> <b>more.</b> <b>For</b> each of these SNPs it is then investigated if the allele frequency is significantly altered between the case and the control group. In such setups, the fundamental unit for reporting effect sizes is the odds ratio. The odds ratio is the ratio of two odds, which in the context of GWA studies are the odds of disease for individuals having a specific allele and the odds of disease for individuals who do not have that same allele. When the allele frequency in the case group is much higher than in the control group, the odds ratio is higher than 1, and vice versa for lower allele frequency. Additionally, a P-value for the significance of the odds ratio is typically calculated using a simple chi-squared test. Finding odds ratios that are significantly different from 1 is the objective of the GWA study because this shows that a SNP is associated with disease.|$|E

25|$|Scientists {{learned about}} {{exposure}} to high level radiation {{from studies of}} the effects of bombing populations at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. However, it is difficult to trace the relationship of low level radiation exposure to resulting cancers and mutations. This is because the latency period between exposure and effect can be 25years <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>for</b> cancer and a generation <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>for</b> genetic damage. Since nuclear generating plants have a brief history, it is early to judge the effects.|$|E
