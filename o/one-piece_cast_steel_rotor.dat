50|$|The {{locomotive}} {{was thoroughly}} modern in design, with a <b>one-piece</b> <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> frame with Franklin spring-loaded wedge horns, manufactured by Commonwealth Steel Castings Corporation in the United States of America. Like the Class 25 locomotive, it had roller bearing axle boxes on all wheels, {{but not on}} the crank-pins, with cannon boxes on all axles, except those of the inner Bissel trucks which had outside bearings. It had mechanical lubrication throughout, self-adjusting pivots, a U-shaped foundation ring welded to the inner and outer firebox bottom edges, and an all-welded firebox. The engine units also had Commonwealth <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> type frames.|$|R

50|$|In {{design and}} general appearance, the Class GO {{was very similar}} to the Class GMA and many parts were interchangeable. It was also superheated, with a {{mechanical}} stoker, Walschaerts valve gear and piston valves, and was built on an identical <b>one-piece</b> <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> frame with Franklin spring-loaded wedge horns, manufactured by Commonwealth Steel Castings Corporation in the United States of America. The chief differences were aimed at reducing weight, such as a smaller boiler with a reduced diameter, a smaller firebox and firegrate area and a half ton smaller capacity coal bunker.|$|R
5000|$|K5 #5698 {{was built}} at the PRR's Juniata Works (Juniata 4205 / 1929) in 1929, but having a works plate Altoona Works 4205 / 1929. This {{according}} to late Mr Ivan W. Saunders, Pittsburgh, Pa. A <b>one-piece</b> <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> locomotive bed was used; this produced the locomotive frame, cylinders, and smokebox saddle as one giant <b>steel</b> <b>casting.</b> This casting was produced by Commonwealth Steel's Granite City, Illinois plant. This cast locomotive bed design was a successful trial, and was repeated on 1930s order for 100 M1a class 4-8-2 [...] "Mountains", as was the Worthington feedwater heater with mixing chamber behind the stack.|$|R
50|$|Also in 1954, 25 Class GO light {{branch line}} Garratts entered service. Designed under Grubb’s {{supervision}} {{to operate on}} lighter rails, they were built by Henschel. In design and general appearance, the Class GO was {{very similar to the}} Class GMA, with the chief differences aimed at reducing weight, such as a smaller boiler with a reduced diameter, a smaller firebox and grate area and a half ton smaller capacity coal bunker. The <b>one-piece</b> <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> frame and engine units were identical to that of the Class GMA, except that the cylinders had been lined and sleeved to reduce the bore from 20+1/2 to 18+1/2 in to suit the smaller boiler. The Class GO was also a tank-and-tender Garratt and carried water only in its front tank while the rear bunker carried only coal, and it also ran with a semi-permanently coupled 6815 imp gal capacity Type X-17 water tender.|$|R
50|$|For the SNCF, {{this type}} of machine {{constituted}} a small revolution - with simple expansion and very advanced construction techniques, the 141 R 1101-1340 were the only SNCF steam locomotives equipped with Boxpok wheels, and roller bearings on all the driving and coupled axles, {{as well as an}} almost indeformable <b>one-piece</b> <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> frame. The bar frames and the axle box bearings of 141 R 1-1100, appeared irreproachable, which made them powerful machines but economical to maintain. For 141 R 1101-1340, the maximum mileage run between two main works visits was up to 230000 km. Easy to drive, they offered relatively modern comfort for both drivers and firemen. The cabs were fully enclosed, equipped with a comfort and an ergonomic hitherto unknown to SNCF crews. Driving and firing controls were within reach while seated, with automatic coal feeding thanks to the mechanical stoker, and oil-firing was even easier. They were banalisées ("standardised"), that is, not assigned to a particular crew.|$|R
5000|$|Recognizing {{the company}} had grown beyond its {{original}} business of manufacturing steel castings, the company {{changed its name to}} General Steel Industries, Incorporated on May 1, 1961. [...] The company's first two plants, the Eddystone plant and the Granite City plant, the acquired Commonwealth Steel facility, became the Castings Division and both plants continued to produce large steel castings. For example, in 1961 the Eddystone plant provided 85% of the steel castings used in the Union Electric Company's new Taum Sauk hydroelectric power station near St. Louis and produced railroad specialty products such as [...] "the world's highest capacity flat car", weighing almost 75 tons, with a load limit of 300 tons. [...] The Granite City plant produced [...] "engineered <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> specialty products" [...] for the railroad industry including one-piece locomotive beds, <b>one-piece</b> <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> flat car underframes and wear-resistant manganese <b>steel</b> <b>casting,</b> used in mining and crushing equipment and heavy-duty power shovels. [...] In the 1950s, the company, then as General Steel Castings, introduced the Commonwealth 53' 6" [...] flatcar that became one of the railroad industry's most commonly used flatcars during the 1950s and 1960s. [...] This flatcar remained in production, with only minor changes, into the early 1970s.|$|R
50|$|A {{locomotive}} bed is a <b>one-piece</b> <b>steel</b> <b>casting</b> for a {{steam locomotive}} {{that consists of}} the locomotive frame, the cylinders and valve chests, steam pipes, and smokebox saddle, all as a single component. It was a development of {{the final years of}} steam locomotive design in the United States. Most large cast-steel locomotive beds were made by General Steel Castings. The advantages included greater strength and more accurate alignment.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotive}} was tended by a Type EW1 tender {{which was}} equipped with a mechanical stoker of which the engine was mounted on the tender. The tank had a water capacity of 10500 imp gal and the coal bunker a capacity of 18 lt t. The tender frame was also a <b>one-piece</b> <b>steel</b> <b>casting</b> and was a water-bottom frame, with the frame itself forming {{the bottom of the}} tank instead of being a separate tank and frame as in previous designs.|$|R
50|$|The {{cylinders}} and frames {{were cast}} {{in one piece}} while the steel cylinders and steam chests were fitted with cast iron liners. The tender frame was also a <b>one-piece</b> <b>steel</b> <b>casting.</b> The Alligator type crossheads were split on the vertical centre line and clamped on {{to the end of}} the piston rods, which had three coned rings engaging in grooves in the crossheads. The original coupling rods differed from the usual in the provision of three independent rods, thereby doing away with four knuckle joints and pins.|$|R
50|$|The tender rode on six-wheeled bogies, {{each with}} a 10 ft {{wheelbase}} and fitted with Timken roller bearings. It was equipped with a mechanical stoker, of which the engine was mounted on the tender. The tank had a water capacity of 10500 imp gal and the coal bunker a capacity of 18 lt t. The tender had a <b>one-piece</b> <b>steel</b> <b>casting</b> water-bottom frame, with the frame itself forming {{the bottom of the}} tank instead of being a separate tank and frame as in previous designs.

5|$|The {{locomotives}} were {{equipped with}} the unusual 6ft 2 in (1.88 m) Bulleid Firth Brown (BFB) driving wheels which were lighter, yet stronger than the spoked equivalent. These proved to be successful and were later used on other Bulleid classes. The leading bogie was based upon that of the SR Lord Nelson class, although it had a 6ft 3 in (1.90 m) wheelbase as opposed to Maunsell's 7ft 6 in (2.28 m) design, and featured 3ft 1 in (0.94 m) BFB wheels. A long coupled driving wheelbase was incorporated into the design, to keep the locomotives within the lineal loading of the Southern Railway's narrower bridges. The supporting rear trailing truck was a <b>one-piece</b> <b>steel</b> <b>casting</b> that gave the smoothest of rides; the design was utilised in the future BR Standard Class 7.|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, a {{flywheel}} energy storage system (FESS) is proposed for the isolated wind-hydrogen-diesel hybrid power system in Ramea, Newfoundland, Canada. Sizing {{and control of the}} {{flywheel energy storage}} for Ramea wind-hydrogen-diesel hybrid power system is presented. At present, the hybrid power system in Ramea consists of diesel generators, wind turbines, hydrogen generator and Electrolyzer. The main objective of this proposed flywheel energy storage system is to minimize sudden variations of grid voltage and frequency due to variable wind speed and variable load. HOMER software is used for sizing and steady-state simulations, while MATLAB/Simulink is used for modeling and dynamic analysis of Ramea Hybrid power system. The selected size of the FESS is tested experimentally using a setup which is composed of 2 kW DC machine based flywheel energy storage. The test DC machine is used as a motor/generator unit coupled with a <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> flywheel <b>rotor,</b> a programmable data acquisition card, two controllable power supply units, two electromechanical relays and relay driving circuits. Steady state simulation shows that the addition of {{a flywheel}} energy storage to Ramea system reduces the fuel consumption by the diesel generator, reduces the excess electrical energy per year, increases the renewable penetration to the grid and reduces the number of starting the diesel generator per year. These observations can be advantageous in prolonging the life span of the diesel generator, as well as reducing its maintenance. Also the observations indicate that the voltage on the grid-side can stabilized under frequency dynamic variation...|$|R

40|$|Context: Alloys {{have been}} {{considered}} to be of paramount importance {{in the field of}} prosthodontics. Long span prosthesis may often require joining of one or more individual castings to obtain better fit, occlusal harmony and esthetics in comparison to <b>one-piece</b> <b>casting.</b> Aim: This study was undertaken to evaluate the mechanical properties of base metal alloys joined by two different techniques, namely, gas oxygen torch soldering and laser fusion, compared to a <b>one-piece</b> <b>casting.</b> Mechanical properties evaluated were tensile strength, percentage of elongation and hardness of the solder joint. In addition, corrosion properties and scanning electron microscopic appearance of the joints were also evaluated. Materials and Methods: The samples were prepared according to American Society for Testing Materials specifications (ASTM, E 8). Specimens were made with self-cure acrylic and then invested in phosphate-bonded investment material. Casting was done in induction casting machine. Thirty specimens were thus prepared for each group and compared with 30 specimens of the <b>one-piece</b> <b>casting</b> group. Statistical Analysis Used: SPSS software (version 10. 0, Chicago, IL, USA) was used for statistical analysis. ANOVA and Benferroni post hoc tests were done for multiple comparisons between the groups and within the groups for mean difference and standard error. Results: Results showed that tensile strength of the <b>one-piece</b> <b>casting</b> was higher than laser fused and gas oxygen torch soldered joints. Laser fused joints exhibited higher hardness values compared to that of gas oxygen torch soldered joints. Scanning electron microscopic examination revealed greater porosity in the gas oxygen torch soldered joints. This contributed to the reduction in the strength of the joint. Gas oxygen torch soldered joints showed less corrosion resistance when compared to laser fused joints and <b>one-piece</b> <b>casting.</b> Conclusion: Laser fusion, which is a recent introduction to the field of prosthodontics, produces joints which have properties between those of <b>one-piece</b> <b>casting</b> and the gas oxygen torch soldering...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The paper {{presents}} {{evaluation of}} the influence of grain normalization (refinement as a result of repeated austenitizing), cooling rate after repeated austenitizing on the morphology of hypereutectoid cementite and fracture toughness of G 200 CrMoNi 4 - 6 - 3 <b>cast</b> <b>steel.</b> Moreover, the elimination of hypereutectoid cementite in structure of Widmannstätten type precipitates from the structure of investigated <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> has been undertaken. Design/methodology/approach: Basic research of G 200 CrMoNi 4 - 6 - 3 <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> included metallographic analysis and fracture toughness research (impact strength, stress intensity factor KIc). The heat treatment has been planned on the basis of CCT diagram prepared for that <b>cast</b> <b>steel.</b> Findings: Heat treatment of investigated <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> allows to refine the grain and eliminate from it’s structure the hypereutectoid cementite in structure of Widmannstätten type. At very low cooling rate the precipitates of hypereutectoid cementite become partially coagulated. The study {{of the influence of}} cooling rate on the mechanical properties of G 200 CrMoNi 4 - 6 - 3 <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> had proven that elimination of hypereutectoid cementite in structure of Widmannstätten type from the investigated <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> structure to small degree increases it’s fracture toughness.
