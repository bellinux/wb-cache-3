5|$|A {{total of}} 20 teams {{were invited to}} {{participate}} in the 1987 Giro d'Italia. Each team sent a squad of nine riders, which meant that the race started with a peloton of 180 cyclists. The presentation of the teams – where each team's roster and manager are introduced in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>and</b> local dignitaries – took place on 20 May, outside the Casino of San Remo. From the riders that began this edition, 133 completed the race.|$|E

5|$|In September, a poll {{conducted}} by the Goldwater campaign revealed that Johnson had a comfortable lead over him. Indeed, Goldwater's campaign was an uphill battle against an incumbent administration during a prosperous economy. In {{the wake of the}} death of John Kennedy, who had been leading in polls for reelection in 1964, there lingered the possibility that Johnson had the sympathy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>and</b> voters.|$|E
5|$|More recently, Andrée's heroic motives {{have been}} questioned, {{beginning}} with Per Olof Sundman's bestselling semi-documentary novel of 1967, The Flight of the Eagle. Sundman portrays Andrée as {{the victim of}} the demands <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>and</b> the Swedish scientific and political establishment, and as ultimately motivated by fear rather than courage. Sundman's interpretation of the personalities involved, the blind spots of the Swedish national culture, {{and the role of the}} press is reflected in the film adaptation, Flight of the Eagle (1982), based on his novel and directed by Jan Troell. It was nominated for an Oscar.|$|E
5|$|Statistical {{analysis}} {{was applied to}} discover more specific drivers of peace. Specifically, the research team looked for indicators that were included and excluded from the index that had high levels of correlation with the overall score and rank of countries. Among the statistically significant indicators that were not used in the analysis were the functionality of a country's government, regional integration, hostility to foreigners, importance of religion in national life, corruption, freedom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>and</b> GDP per capita.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the local}} {{television}} {{stations in the}} city, TVR Cluj (public) and One TV (private) broadcast regionally, while the others are restricted to the metropolitan area. Napoca Cable Network is available through cable, and broadcasts local content throughout the day. Other stations work as affiliates of national TV stations, only providing the audience with local reports {{in addition to the}} national programming. This situation is mirrored in the radio broadcasting companies: except for Radio Cluj, Radio Impuls and the Hungarian-language Paprika Rádió, all other stations are local affiliates of the national broadcasters. Casa Radio, situated on Donath Street, is one of the modern landmarks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>and</b> communications industry; it is, however, not the only one: Palatul Telefoanelor ("the telephone palace") is also a major modernist symbol of communications in the city centre.|$|E
5|$|Before joining Bernard in Paris, Rosa {{stays in}} a flat in London for several weeks. Now that she has no {{intention}} of honouring the agreement of her passport, which was to return to South Africa within a year, she openly introduces herself as Burger's daughter. This attracts the attention <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>and</b> she attends several political events. At one such event, Rosa sees Baasie, but when she tries to talk to him, he starts criticising her for not knowing his real name (Zwelinzima Vulindlela). He says that there is nothing special about her father having died in prison as many black fathers have also died there, and adds that he does not need her help. Rosa is devastated by her childhood friend's hurtful remarks, and overcome with guilt, she abandons her plans of going into exile in France and returns to South Africa.|$|E
5|$|On April 18, 1989, a {{group of}} 39 women went into the Pittston Coal {{headquarters}} and held a 36‑hour sit-down strike. The women stated {{that they would not}} leave until a contract was signed. When questioned by police and media reporters to give up their names, the women responded by saying that they were daughters of Mother Jones. The Daughters gained the attention <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>and</b> completely halted production at Pittston for an entire day and a half. The women involved were not members of the UMWA but wanted to support their cause, and due to this they were linked to the UMWA and considered by some {{to be a part of}} the union.|$|E

5|$|Thunder Run {{operated}} {{until the}} end of the 2009 season on November 1. Amid a corporate bankruptcy, on February 4, 2010, Six Flags announced the park would cease operations immediately due to the rejection of an amended lease by the Kentucky State Fair Board. Many attempts were made to reopen the park under new operators. Eventually, on June 27, 2013, a group of investors led by Ed Hart negotiated an agreement to reopen the park. The group would spend $36 million to reopen the park in May 2014. Thunder Run would be part of the opening day lineup of attractions. Rocky Mountain Construction was hired to refurbish the ride, resulting in the existing wooden track to be replaced. On October 10, 2013, Kentucky Kingdom invited members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>and</b> amusement industry to ride the refurbished Thunder Run. The ride reopened to the public on May 24, 2014. After the 2016 season, Kentucky Kingdom announced that Thunder Run would get new trains from the Philadelphia Toboggan Company for the 2017 season. These trains would replace the ones first put into service in 1990.|$|E
5|$|Twenty-two teams {{participated in}} the 2011 edition of the Tour de France. All {{eighteen}} UCI ProTeams were entitled, and obliged, to enter the race. On 19 January 2011, the organiser of the Tour, Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO), announced the four second-tier UCI Professional Continental teams given wildcard invitations, {{all of which were}} French-based. One team, the Spanish-based , which included the third-placed rider in the 2010 Tour, Denis Menchov, and the 2008 Tour winner, Carlos Sastre, was overlooked. The presentation of the teams– where the members of each team's roster are introduced in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>and</b> local dignitaries– took place in front of audience of 7,000 inside the Roman amphitheatre at the Puy du Fou theme park in Les Epesses, Vendée, on 30 June, two days before the opening stage.|$|E
