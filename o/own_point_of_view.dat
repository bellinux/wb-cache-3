His sociology engaged in a neo-Kantian inquiry into the limits of perception, asking 'What is society?' in a direct allusion to Kant's question 'What is nature?' ...|$|E
500|$|There {{are many}} {{accounts}} of Johnson suffering from bouts {{of depression and}} what Johnson thought might be madness.

To overcome these feelings, Johnson tried to constantly involve himself with various activities, but this did not seem to help.

The authors contend that heteronormativity is not {{the product of a}} coming-of-age transformation but instead an everyday part of life, even for very young social actors. It emerges from the gender divide between boys and girls but is also reproduced by and for girls themselves. In the Girl Project, the authors sought to understand younger girls’ interests, skills, and concerns. They conducted nine focus groups with 43 elementary school girls, most of whom were age nine or younger. They observed these girls as they defined “girls’ interests” as boy centered and as they performed heteronormativity for other girls.

This is a picture conceived in a coarse, vulgar, and commonplace mind, the work of a man seeking distinction by the vulgar qualification and expedient of size. It is bad from every point of view, including his own.” This was {{by no means the only}} such uncomplimentary review in American and French newspapers. But with the passage of decades, the Bathers slowly emerged into critical respectability. The critic and friend of Seurat, FélixFénéon waited many years before commenting, ‘Though I did not commit myself in writing, I then [...] completely realised the importance of this painting.‘ For many years, Bathers at Asnières remained in the possession of Seurat’s family, and in 1900 the work was purchased by Felix Fénéon.

2500|$|Piaget {{attributed}} {{different types}} of psychosocial processes to different forms of social relationships, introducing a fundamental distinction between {{different types of}} said relationships. Where there is constraint because one participant holds more power than the other the relationship is asymmetrical, and, importantly, the knowledge that can be acquired by the dominated participant takes on a fixed and inflexible form. Piaget refers to this process as one of social transmission, illustrating it through reference {{to the way in}} which the elders of a tribe initiate younger members into the patterns of beliefs and practices of the group. Similarly, where adults exercise a dominating influence over the growing child, it is through social transmission that children can acquire knowledge. By contrast, in cooperative relations, power is more evenly distributed between participants so that a more symmetrical relationship emerges. Under these conditions, authentic forms of intellectual exchange become possible; each partner has the freedom to project his or her own thoughts, consider the positions of others, and defend his or her <b>own</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view.</b> In such circumstances, where children’s thinking is not limited by a dominant influence, Piaget believed [...] "the reconstruction of knowledge", or favorable conditions for the emergence of constructive solutions to problems, exists. Here the knowledge that emerges is open, flexible and regulated by the logic of argument rather than being determined by an external authority.|$|E
