5|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century, Halloween had turned into a night of vandalism, with {{destruction}} of property and cruelty to animals and people. Around 1912, the BSA, Boys Clubs and other neighborhood organizations came together to encourage a safe celebration that would end the destruction that had become so common <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>night.</b>|$|E
5|$|At midday on 3 March 1945 {{teletype}} {{messages from}} Bomber Command Headquarters at RAF High Wycombe began reaching the airfields of RAF squadrons in Eastern England. <b>On</b> <b>this</b> <b>night</b> a planned raid with moderate numbers of bombers was planned over western Germany. A complex plan of feint attacks and diversions to deceive German air defence system were drawn up. The main force was {{split into two}} separate groups in the Münster area; No. 4 Group RAF were ordered to destroy the synthetic oil plant at Kamen and No. 5 Group RAF would attempt to eliminate the aqueduct, safety gates, and canal boats on the Dortmund–Ems Canal at Ladbergen.|$|E
5|$|Australian airmen were {{involved}} in Allied efforts to delay German reinforcements from reaching Normandy throughout June. On the night of 6/7 June, 20 Mosquitos from No.464 Squadron were dispatched to attack German road convoys and trains in northern France. The four Australian heavy bomber squadrons also participated in raids on French towns <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>night.</b> While No.463, No.466 and No.467 Squadrons mainly targeted railway facilities, No.460 Squadron formed part of an attack on Vire, which sought to destroy the town to prevent the Germans from using the roads through it. Following these initial raids, Bomber Command continued to target railway infrastructure in France {{in an attempt to}} disrupt the movement of German reinforcements to Normandy. The command operated intensively during the week after the invasion, and some Australian aircrew flew raids on consecutive nights during this period. Overall, Bomber Command made 16 raids against railway facilities in France between 13 and 30 June, of which six included {{at least one of the}} RAAF squadrons. The RAAF heavy bomber squadrons and Australians in RAF units also took part in several attacks on German supply dumps and airfields during this period. Bomber Command made fewer raids on these targets than had been planned prior to the invasion, however, as its units were frequently assigned to strike facilities associated with the V-1 flying bombs the Germans were launching against the UK. No.464 Squadron also operated against German vehicles travelling at night and bombed railway yards, and flew 75 sorties between the nights of 7/8 and 12/13 June. Overall, the squadron conducted attacks on 19 nights during June, during which five of its aircraft were destroyed. The Australians in 2TAF's other light and medium bomber units also attacked the German lines of communication in France and occasionally provided direct support for the Allied ground forces throughout this period.|$|E

Some songs express a prayer that the Beit Hamikdash will soon be rebuilt. The last song to be sung is Chad Gadya ("One Kid Goat"). This seemingly childish song about different animals and people who attempted to punish others for their crimes and were in turn punished themselves, was interpreted by the Vilna Gaon as an allegory to the retribution God will levy over the enemies of the Jewish people {{at the end of}} days.|$|E
25|$|On May 28, 1977, the Beverly Hills Supper Club was {{operating}} beyond capacity, {{largely due to}} the popularity of that evening's Cabaret Room show, featuring popular Hollywood singer and actor John Davidson. Based on its number of exits, the Cabaret Room could safely accommodate about 600 people, according to the calculations of the Fire Marshal; <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>night</b> it was packed well beyond that capacity, with people seated on ramps and in aisles. According to later estimates based on seating charts and memories of those present, {{the number of people in}} the Cabaret Room at 9:00p.m. on May 28 was somewhere between 900 and 1,300. No matter the exact number each gives, sources agree that the room was well beyond its safe holding capacity.|$|E

SVT also used to show the British half-hour comedy The Plank and the ski jumping contest in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, but they have been withdrawn. On New Year's Day, SVT shows The New Year Concert of the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra. The film Ivanhoe was broadcast by SVT on New Year's Day earlier, but the commercial channel TV3 has taken over the tradition.|$|E

500|$|Later in May, Fox {{announced}} Fringe {{would be}} moving from Tuesdays to Thursdays {{for the second}} season, to be aired in the competitive 9:00pm timeslot. Kevin Reilly explained the move, [...] "The door is more open <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>night</b> {{than it has been}} in a long time.

Ratings for the season continued to decline, culminating in 5.68million viewers watching the finale. Fringes second season ended with an average of 6.252million viewers per episode and a 2.3 ratings share for adults 18–49, causing the series to finish in 79th place out of all the season's network television shows. However, Fringe and its lead-in, Bones, did help the network increase 52% among adults aged 18–49 and 65 percent among total viewers from the same night the previous year.

500|$|The concert program {{received}} a positive reception. The Oregonian David Stabler wrote {{that during the}} May 7 performance the orchestra displayed peak condition and [...] "played with a precision and intensity {{that would have been}} unattainable a decade ago". He complimented Sylvan's diction and [...] "emotional engagement", but noted that some words were difficult to make out. Stabler called the timpanist's performance during Britten's symphony [...] "fierce" [...] and the orchestra's playing [...] "clear and intentional". In his review of the Carnegie Hall performance, Stabler opined that the Oregon Symphony's program (which he described as one of [...] "rage, brutality and fleeting beauty that required the utmost precision and ferocity from the musicians") focused more on playing, while the programs by other orchestras drew attention to the music. Stabler wrote: [...] "Everyone knows orchestras are fighting to survive, but <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>night,</b> the Oregon Symphony breathed long and deep of triumph." [...] In a separate article summarizing reviews by New York critics, Stabler called the Symphony a [...] "virtuosos band" [...] that [...] "now plays with more acute rhythmic precision, more clarity, more informed style... and more extreme dynamics and tempos". James Bash of Oregon Music News wrote a positive review of the New York performance, describing it as more enhanced, dramatic and intense than the Portland concerts, partly because of the venue's superior acoustics. Bash described the orchestra's performance of The Unanswered Question as [...] "compelling and auspicious" [...] and wrote that Sylvan's vocals during The Wound-Dresser [...] "conveyed the sensitive text superbly". In addition to complimenting the Symphony overall, Bash singled out solo performers by name. After noting the audience's enthusiastic response to the performance, including multiple bravos and particular recognition for Kalmar, Bash quipped [...] "the Oregon Symphony may be regional in terms of size and budget, but they are world-class when they play".|$|E
