25|$|The race {{begins at}} 6:00 AM (previously 5:00 AM) on Holy Saturday morning, near Mile 2 on Belize's George Price Highway, a {{favorite}} road for cycling events. Recently {{there has been}} a lead-out from inside Belize City at the BTL Park with actual racing beginning on the highway. Cyclists race to the western town of San Ignacio, in the Cayo District, turn there and return to Belize City, finishing at the Marion Jones Sports Complex (formerly the National Stadium) with two laps <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>asphalt</b> track (more recently on flat straight portions of Princess Margaret Drive and Marine Parade while the Complex is under renovation). The estimated distance of the Classic is some 142.4 miles. Participation is limited mainly to amateur cyclists of any country, and cyclists from Mexico, Guatemala, Jamaica, the United Kingdom and the United States have participated. In addition to prizes awarded {{at the end of the}} race, station prizes are handed out at strategic points on the road going and coming. These prizes are usually cash donations, farm produce or certificates for trophies, jewelry and other items. Belizeans normally line the roadway to cheer on Belize's representatives in the race. While the cyclists are pushed toward Cayo by southeasterly or even easterly winds, a combination of those same fierce winds and the usual muggy conditions of Belize in the dry season traditionally faces cyclists on the return journey.|$|E
25|$|After {{several years}} of varying success, McRae {{switched}} to the M-Sport-run Ford factory team for 1999, driving the new Ford Focus rally car. The deal saw McRae earning six million pounds over two years, {{which at the time}} made him the highest earning rally driver in history. This move was immediately rewarded with two consecutive wins at the Safari Rally and Rally Portugal. A number of shunts and reliability issues for the new car for {{much of the rest of}} that season, however, resulted in only sixth place in the championship standings overall. Moreover, a rare personal pointless run had begun for McRae that year which was only to be halted with a podium on the following February's Swedish Rally, the beginning of a recovery which saw McRae victorious <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>asphalt</b> turns of Catalunya and the gravel of Greece, and post 4th in the 2000 overall standings. Midway through the 2000 season, the lacking reliability of the Focus had led to McRae threatening to leave the team if the problems continued. The upturn towards the end of the season resulted in him deciding to renew his contract with Ford for a further two years. McRae's intermittent success with Ford continued into 2001, where after failing to score in any of the first four rounds, including having momentarily led defending winner Tommi Makinen on the stages of the season opening Monte Carlo Rally prior to being forced into retirement, he then went on to score three consecutive victories in Argentina, Cyprus and Greece to tie with Mäkinen at the top of the points table. However, having again led the championship outright entering the final round in Great Britain, McRae once more missed out on a possible second title, crashing out and finishing second in the drivers championship, two points behind Subaru's Richard Burns.|$|E
500|$|In 2008, {{the musicians}} of OverClocked ReMix {{were chosen to}} handle the Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix soundtrack after Capcom U.S.A. {{associate}} producer Rey Jimenez heard the site's 2006 Super Street Fighter II Turbo tribute album Blood <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Asphalt.</b> Entitled OC ReMix: Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix Official Soundtrack, the complete 66-track album was freely released at OverClocked ReMix. The album includes new arrangements, edited versions of Blood <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Asphalt</b> tracks, and other prior remixes from the site. The remixers arranged the music based on knowledge of the Street Fighter II series alone, as the music for the game was completed before the visuals and gameplay. OC ReMix founder David [...] "djpretzel" [...] Lloyd directed the soundtrack and served as the organization's contact with Capcom [...] "to ensure that working with a large fan community {{was as close as}} possible for Capcom to working with a single composer". Jimenez praised HD Remixs music as [...] "above and beyond our expectations" [...] and OC ReMix's efforts as [...] "one of the most rewarding aspects of working on SF HD Remix". Capcom's then-Vice-President of Strategic Planning & Business Development, Christian Svensson, described the soundtrack as [...] "impactful" [...] and claimed in an interview that in demos of the game the remixed music was praised before any other aspect. In its review of HD Remix, IGN commended OC ReMix's work as [...] "a great tribute to the original soundtrack". Other entities with favorable reviews of the soundtrack include Eurogamer, GameSpot, Official Xbox Magazine, and GamesRadar, as well as long-time game composer [...] "The Fat Man" [...] George Sanger, who referred to the Capcom-OC ReMix collaboration as [...] "Game Audio 2.0".|$|E

2500|$|The {{ceremony}} {{was held on}} December 17, with attendance of Moses and company, along with Alfred Smith. 300 cars were lined up <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>asphalt,</b> {{which was designed to}} make night driving much easier over the concrete. Smith cut the ribbon on the new extension in Westbury, about [...] east of Glen Cove Road. A tour of the new parkway extensions was held, but not over the entire thing. The group went from Westbury along the new alignment of the Northern State, and south on the Wantagh to the Southern State. New lights were installed on the median of the parkways to help with lighting of the parkway. Before a luncheon for the officials, over 600 people were presented the new parkways. The new parkway opened to traffic, connecting drivers to various places along Long Island and New York City.|$|E

2500|$|Early American {{television}} {{largely ignored}} lesbian women. Homosexuality was not discussed on television until the mid-1950s, {{and when it}} was discussed — usually on local talk shows — it was almost uniformly male homosexuality under discussion. It was not until 1962, when an episode of Confidential File covered the 1962 convention of the Daughters of Bilitis, that a national broadcast specifically covered lesbianism. Lesbians were explicitly excluded from the proposal for the country's first documentary broadcast on homosexuality, 1961's The Rejected, and from the first network documentary on homosexuality, [...] "", a 1967 instalment of CBS Reports. On scripted television, the earliest lesbian characters were [...] "coded", like the villainous Miss Brant <b>on</b> <b>The</b> <b>Asphalt</b> Jungle (1961), a repressed lesbian who shoots girls on lovers' lane for making themselves available to boys, or neurotics like Hallie Lambert from a 1963 episode of The Eleventh Hour. After years during which the only portrayals of lesbians on television were negative, stereotypical, or both, NBC aired [...] "Flowers of Evil" [...] a 1974 episode of the series Police Woman. In it a trio of lesbians (described by Lesbian Tide magazine as [...] "The Butch, The Bitch and The Femme") were robbing and murdering the elderly residents of the nursing home they ran. Lesbian activists operating under the name Lesbian Feminist Liberation staged a zap at NBC's New York City headquarters. Ten women entered the building and occupied it overnight. Around 75 women demonstrated in front of the building. The following morning protesters unfurled a twenty foot long banner from the balcony of vice president Herminio Traviesas's office reading [...] "LESBIANS PROTEST NBC". They and street-level picketers chanted slogans like [...] "NBC works against lesbians" [...] and [...] "Lesbians are sitting in".|$|E

60|$|She {{went out}} and found Miss Harby, and another girl teacher, in the porch. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>asphalt</b> yard the rain was falling.

60|$|So Aaron quietly {{entered the}} parlour. It was a cold, clammy room, dark.

40|$|Visual {{effects of}} Mycobacterium ranae on a 135 -penetration asphalt (asphalt 1 A) are described, which show the texture and {{rheological}} characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>asphalt</b> {{to be modified}} by microbial action. A bentonite-asphalt emulsion system for asphalts 1 A, 3 A, and 6 A was used to subject these materials to the degradative activity of M. ranae and Nocardia coeliaca for 4 months at 30 C. N. coeliaca caused 1. 5 -, 3. 9 -, and 6. 8 -fold increases in relative viscosity of asphalts 1 A, 3 A, and 6 A, respectively. A similar susceptibility pattern for M. ranae was obtained <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same <b>asphalts,</b> but apparently this organism exerted even a greater effect on asphalt 6 A since the viscosity of this residue was too hard to be determined satisfactorily. Comparison of these data with analyses of <b>the</b> three <b>asphalts</b> indicates that <b>the</b> organisms probably attack the resin components of <b>the</b> <b>asphalts...</b>|$|R
