5|$|Sotomayor's {{circuit court}} rulings {{led to her}} being {{considered}} a political centrist by the ABA Journal and other sources and organizations. Several lawyers, legal experts, and news organizations identified her as someone with liberal inclinations. In any case, the Second Circuit's caseload typically skewed more toward business and securities law rather than hot-button social or constitutional issues. Sotomayor tended to write narrow, practiced rulings that relied on close application of the law to the facts of a case rather than import general philosophical viewpoints. A Congressional Research Service analysis found that Sotomayor's rulings defied easy ideological categorization, but did show an adherence to precedent and an avoidance of <b>overstepping</b> the circuit court's judicial role. Unusually, Sotomayor read through all the supporting documents of cases under review; her lengthy rulings explored every aspect of a case and tended to feature leaden, ungainly prose. Some legal experts have said that Sotomayor's attention to detail and re-examination of the facts of a case came close to <b>overstepping</b> the traditional role of appellate judges.|$|E

Algebraic chess notation is the accepted standard for recording games today. There are other systems such as ICCF numeric notation for international correspondence chess and the obsolete descriptive chess notation. The current rule is that a move must {{be made on the}} board before it is written on paper or recorded with an electronic device.|$|E

Prior to returning to Great Britain, Nicolls engaged in a heated exchange of letters with U.S. Indian Agent Benjamin Hawkins. Hawkins accused Nicolls of being overzealous and of <b>overstepping</b> his authority in his personal defence of Redstick Creeks, Seminoles, and their Marron Creole allies, who some Americans in authority viewed as nothing more than runaway slaves and lost or unclaimed property.|$|E

40|$|An <b>overstep</b> in the North Anatolian Fault, {{possibly}} {{acting as}} a seismic barrier, was investigated for its structural and palaeoseismological characteristics. Study interests were: i) to find <b>overstep</b> related spatial changes in deformation which would help assess the structure as a long term singularity in the fault; ii) to identify short term, event-triggered changes in structures where the major fault enters the <b>overstep</b> i. e., {{in an area where}} seismogenic slip is impeded or even arrested; iii) to investigate whether or not the surface <b>overstep</b> is related to a seismic barrier, and iv) to discuss structures that might possibly be characteristic of barriers. In order to achieve this: a) largescale faults were mapped in the area, b) fault-slip data were measured in 56 outcrops along and within the <b>overstep,</b> and c) trenches were dug at the eastern rim of the <b>overstep</b> where recent earthquake structures had been reported. Derived long term stretching directions and ratios change significantly over the fault step and structures of recent major earthquakes suggest different deformation mechanisms for different events at the same Location e. g. strike-slip, thrust and normal faulting...|$|R

5|$|There are {{two types}} of field events: jumps, and throws. In jumping competitions, athletes are judged on either the length or height of their jumps. The {{performances}} of jumping events for distance are measured from a board or marker, and any athlete <b>overstepping</b> this mark is judged to have fouled. In the jumps for height, an athlete must clear their body over a crossbar without knocking the bar off the supporting standards. The majority of jumping events are unaided, although athletes propel themselves vertically with purpose-built sticks in the pole vault.|$|E
5|$|Academics have {{expressed}} scepticism {{as to whether}} the doctrine of legitimate expectation should apply to substantive rights. Thio Li-ann argues that legitimate expectations should relate only to procedural rather than substantive rights. Procedural protection only has a minimal impact on the administrative autonomy of the relevant public authority, since the court is only concerned with {{the manner in which the}} decision was made and not whether the decision was fair. Thus, the ultimate autonomy of public authorities is never placed in jeopardy. Conversely, as Mark Elliot posits, giving effect to a substantive legitimate expectation impinges on the separation of powers. The authority has been entrusted by Parliament to make decisions about the allocation of resources in public interest. Applying legitimate expectation substantively allows the courts to inquire into the merits of the decision. Such interference with the public authority's discretion would be <b>overstepping</b> their role and exceeding their proper constitutional function.|$|E

They finished in 13th place, {{and went on to}} win the Anglo-Scottish Cup with a 1–0 win over Fulham. They also reached the semi-finals of the League Cup, and took a 1–0 lead over Manchester City into the second leg at Maine Road, where they were soundly beaten 4–0. However teams had begun to learn how to combat Charlton's attack strategy and left their centre-backs on the outside of the penalty box to neutralise the threat of Foggon. Despite the team's steady progress the club's board voted to sack Charlton in July 1976 after becoming increasingly concerned that he was <b>overstepping</b> his authority in negotiating business deals on behalf of the club and choosing the club's strip. However, the club chairman overruled the decision and Charlton remained in charge.|$|E

5|$|Sejanus again {{attempted}} to marry into the Julio-Claudian family. Having divorced Apicata two years earlier, he requested marriage with Drusus's widow Livilla in AD 25, possibly {{with an eye}} towards placing himself, as an adopted Julian, {{in the position of}} a potential successor. The emperor denied this request, warning Sejanus that he was in danger of <b>overstepping</b> his rank. Alarmed by this sudden denigration, Sejanus changed his plans and began to isolate Tiberius from Rome. By fueling his paranoia towards Agrippina and the Senate, he induced the emperor to withdraw to the countryside of Campania, which he did in AD 26, and finally to the island of Capri, where he lived until his death in AD 37. Guarded by the Praetorians, Sejanus easily controlled all information that passed between Tiberius and the capital.|$|E
5|$|Immediately upon {{taking his}} seat in the Senate, Crittenden {{was named to the}} Committee on Public Lands and the Committee on the Judiciary, {{probably}} due to Clay's influence. Early in his term, Crittenden vociferously opposed Senator Thomas H. Benton's proposal to spend the federal budget surplus on public land graduation and military fortifications along the eastern seaboard. He also blasted the Jackson administration for issuing the Specie Circular, requiring that all payment for government land be made in gold or silver. He pointed out that the principles of the circular had been presented in a resolution on the Senate floor, but had been tabled by a large majority. Crittenden maintained that the tabling of the resolution was a condemnation by the Senate, yet the administration issued the circular only months later, <b>overstepping,</b> as Crittenden saw it, the bounds of the executive branch's authority. Crittenden debated the issue at length with Senator Benton, and Congress ultimately passed a bill requiring the government to accept the notes of specie-paying banks for the purchase of government lands, but President Jackson employed his pocket veto to prevent it from becoming law.|$|E

However, injuries and <b>overstepping</b> problems reduced his effectiveness, and he played his last first-class match for Sylhet in 2007.|$|E

25|$|In {{the match}} against Victoria, {{he made his}} first {{throwing}} call against a bowler at first-class level. During the match, Egar no-balled South Australian fast bowler Brian Quigley twice on the first day as Victoria batted first. He did so from the bowler's end as Quigley was trying to extract extra pace from the slow pitch. As the calls were made from the bowler's end, almost all of the spectators thought it was for Quigley <b>overstepping</b> the bowling mark, the most common mode of infringement; the fact that Egar made called the bowler for throwing only became apparent to most in the newspapers the next day. Quigley changed his action, but his results thereafter were not enough to gain selection.|$|E

At one stage {{she was on the}} brink of elimination from the competition after <b>overstepping</b> on the first two of her three long jump attempts but ended up recording the best jump of the competition with 6.68 m.

25|$|Colon's {{self-confidence}} is remarkable. He had {{a strong}} regard for right and justice. Firmly, though respectfully, he reproved Rabbi Israel Bruna, the foremost German talmudist of his time, for <b>overstepping</b> the bounds of his authority. Responsum No. 4, addressed to the congregation of Regensburg, is highly important. A number of Jews of that community having been falsely accused, and a sum of money having to be raised for their ransom, the surrounding places and neighboring communities refused to contribute, at least insofar {{as it was a}} question of paying a fixed tax instead of making voluntary contributions. Colon decided that the communities in question could not refuse to pay their share, since the same false accusation might be made against them also, and if the accused in this case were proved innocent and ransomed, they would then be safe from danger.|$|E
