5|$|First, {{its first}} officer {{was also a}} captain, who was more senior and had more total flying time and L-049 {{experience}} than the designated captain.

5|$|Paley {{concludes that}} natural {{theology}} offers many proofs of {{the goodness of}} God, though any <b>one</b> <b>would</b> be sufficient. The many proofs show that the conclusion is stable, and together they can make a suitable impression on those who study them.|$|E
5|$|After {{initializing}} {{the concept}} in January 2013, the two discussed {{the project for}} three or four months before creating an outline for the whole story. The original outline was for 12 issues, but it left room for improvisation and a few points were removed as the story progressed. They looked at past and present social movements for civil rights for inspiration for how <b>one</b> <b>would</b> progress and how people might respond to a movement for android rights. Luna wrote the first draft of issue one, then the two worked together to rewrite it.|$|E
5|$|During {{the tour}} matches, which were usually played {{consecutively}} {{with only one}} or no days between fixtures, Bradman rotated the trio of openers, so <b>one</b> <b>would</b> generally be rested while the other two opened,N- but in the Tests, Morris and Barnes were preferred. Bradman accommodated Brown in his first-choice team by playing him out of position in the middle order {{in the first two}} Tests and against Worcestershire and the MCC, when he fielded the strongest XI. However, Brown appeared uncomfortable in the unfamiliar role, and after making 73 runs at 24.33 in the first two Tests, he was dropped.|$|E

5|$|Gale married Henrietta Roper, the {{daughter}} of Henry Roper of Cowling, Kent. She died in 1720. They had one son, Roger Henry Gale, {{who was born in}} 1710. Gale himself died on 25 June 1744 at his estates in Scruton, and was buried near the church there. There is no monument in the churchyard, as he stipulated in his will that he be buried in such a manner that no <b>one</b> <b>would</b> know exactly where he was buried.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Affeldt {{found himself}} {{competing}} with Runelvys Hernández {{for the first}} spot in the Royals' starting rotation during Spring training. Because Tony Peña, the Royals' manager, was unable to decide which <b>one</b> <b>would</b> be the ace, he flipped a coin to determine who would be number one. Hernández won the toss.|$|E
5|$|In {{another version}} of the story, the king adopted all of the {{children}} of his sister Rangorimanana. He then devised a test to determine which <b>one</b> <b>would</b> succeed him. He requested his messengers to bring the children a package including lemons, meat, honey, rice, milk and a reed, and to note which child took the reed and stood near the central pillar of the house; this child was Rakotomavo.|$|E

5|$|In the thelytokous ant Platythyrea punctata, colonies are clonal; therefore, {{workers are}} all equally related genetically, and worker {{policing}} {{is not expected}} {{as there is no}} genetic conflict. However, <b>one</b> <b>would</b> expect severe effects on the condition of the colony if reproductive workers were left unchecked. For example, more time spent on individual reproduction would be predicted to detract from care of the queen's offspring. In studies of these ants, workers did actually display worker policing, as evidenced by increased aggression towards reproductive workers. Worker policing here is favored for group efficiency.|$|E
5|$|It Takes a Church is an American dating {{game show}} hosted by Natalie Grant and {{broadcast}} by Game Show Network. The show travels to multiple churches {{across the country}} looking for single members of congregations looking for a partner.

The first season, sponsored by Christian Mingle, began airing on June 5, 2014. The series was later renewed for a second season, which began airing March 26, 2015.|$|E
5|$|It has {{not been}} said of any people on the earth that the moon was {{observed}} that night such {{that it could be}} stated that it was not split. Even if this had been reported from many different places, so that <b>one</b> <b>would</b> have to exclude the possibility that all agreed upon a lie, yet, we would not accept this as proof to the contrary, for the moon is not seen in the same way by different people... An eclipse is visible in one country but not in the other one; in one place it is total, in the other one only partial.|$|E

5|$|Manstein's plan, {{developed}} with the informal cooperation of Heinz Guderian, {{suggested that the}} Panzer divisions attack through the wooded hills of the Ardennes where no <b>one</b> <b>would</b> expect them, then establish bridgeheads on the River Meuse and rapidly drive to the English Channel. The Wehrmacht would thus cut off the French and Allied armies in Belgium and Flanders. This {{part of the plan}} later became known as the Sichelschnitt ("sickle cut"). Manstein's proposal also included a second thrust outflanking the Maginot Line, which would allow the Wehrmacht to force any future defensive line much further south.|$|E
5|$|Olga Rudge, {{pregnant}} with Pound's child, followed them to Italy. She had {{little interest in}} raising a child, but may have felt that having <b>one</b> <b>would</b> maintain her connection to him. In July 1925 she gave birth to their daughter, Mary. Olga placed the child with a German-speaking peasant woman whose own child had died, and who agreed to raise Mary for 200 lire a month.|$|E

FAU's newest residence hall is Parliament Hall, a lakeside freshmen housing facility offering 614 beds, a fitness center, lounges, retail dining, and views of the nearby Atlantic Ocean from top floors.|$|E
5|$|Pilcher {{had married}} Kathleen Gonne, {{daughter}} of a cavalry officer, in 1889; the marriage was strained, partly through Pilcher's gambling habits and adultery, and partly through his dislike for Maud Gonne, Kathleen's sister and a prominent Irish nationalist. The couple divorced in 1911, having had four children; <b>one</b> <b>would</b> later become a High Court judge, while another died on the Western Front in 1915. Pilcher remarried in 1913, and remained married to his second wife Millicent {{until his death in}} 1928.|$|E
5|$|Pituitary {{apoplexy}} is rare. Even {{in people}} with a known pituitary tumor, only 0.6–10% experience apoplexy; the risk is higher in larger tumors.
