25|$|Despite its {{regressive}} tax formula, Social Security benefits are calculated using a progressive benefit formula that replaces {{a much higher}} percentage <b>of</b> <b>low-income</b> workers' pre-retirement income than that of higher-income workers (although these low-income workers pay {{a higher percentage of}} their pre-retirement income). Supporters of the current system also point to numerous studies that show that, relative to high-income workers, Social Security disability and survivor benefits paid on behalf <b>of</b> <b>low-income</b> workers more than offset any retirement benefits that may be lost because of shorter life expectancy (this offset would only apply at a population level). Other research asserts that survivor benefits, allegedly an offset, actually exacerbate the problem because survivor benefits are denied to single individuals, including widow(er)s married fewer than nine months (except in certain situations), divorced widow(er)s married fewer than 10 years, and co-habiting or same-sex couples, unless they are legally married in their state of residence. Unmarried individuals and minorities tend to be less wealthy.|$|E
