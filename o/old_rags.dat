25|$|Papermaking has {{traditionally}} been traced to China about AD 105, when Cai Lun, an official attached to the Imperial court during the Han Dynasty (202 BC-AD 220), created {{a sheet of paper}} using mulberry and other bast fibres along with fishnets, <b>old</b> <b>rags,</b> and hemp waste. However, a recent archaeological discovery has been reported from Gansu of paper with Chinese characters on it dating to 8 BC.|$|E

There the Polish ex-prisoners gradually received English uniforms, our <b>old</b> <b>rags</b> infected with all sorts of disease and insects being burned, and we started the journey towards Teheran and from there to Palestine.|$|E
25|$|Papermaking is {{traced back}} to China about 105 CE, when Cai Lun, an {{official}} attached to the Imperial court during the Han Dynasty (202 BCE-220 CE), created {{a sheet of paper}} using mulberry and other bast fibres along with fishnets, <b>old</b> <b>rags,</b> and hemp waste. Paper with legible Chinese writings on it dating from 8 BCE, while hempen paper had been used in China for wrapping and padding since the eighth century BCE. Paper used as a writing medium became widespread by the 3rd century and, by the 6th century, toilet paper was starting to be used in China as well. During the Tang Dynasty (618-907 CE) paper was folded and sewn into square bags to preserve the flavour of tea, while the later Song Dynasty (960-1279 CE) was the first government to issue paper-printed money.|$|E

2500|$|Shenandoah National Park {{is one of}} {{the most}} dog-friendly in the {{national}} park system. The campgrounds all allow dogs, and dogs are allowed on almost all of the trails including the Appalachian Trail, if kept on leash (6 feet or shorter).

50|$|<b>Old</b> <b>Rag</b> Mountain is {{underlain}} by <b>Old</b> <b>Rag</b> Granite, {{named for}} its ubiquitous exposure on the mountain, formed during the Grenville Orogeny about a billion years ago. About 400 million years after the Grenville orogeny during the Catoctin Formation, deposition of basaltic magma occurred during {{the formation of the}} Iapetus Ocean, forming a layer of greenstone over the granite. This was followed by the Weverton Formation, Harpers Formation, and Antietam formation in which sand and rock sedimented on the ocean floor forming quartzite and sandstone deposits. Finally a period of sedimentation of shells and skeletons of foraminifera resulted in deposition of a layer of limestone. Approximately 700 million years after the Greenville Orogeny, the Iapetus Ocean began to close resulting in the Alleghenian Orogeny when the <b>Old</b> <b>Rag</b> Granite and layers of rock deposited upon it were transported westward and eventually thrust up over the limestone bed around it, forming <b>Old</b> <b>Rag</b> and the Blue Ridge Mountains.|$|R

50|$|The {{summit of}} <b>Old</b> <b>Rag</b> is {{accessible}} via {{a system of}} trails in Shenandoah National Park. The shorter, most common way is from a parking area {{at the end of}} Virginia State Route 601 off Virginia State Route 231, {{at the base of the}} mountain. A 9 mi circuit hike or a 5.4 mi out-and-back hike to the summit can be made. The circuit hike makes use of the Ridge Trail which ascends the mountain 1.6 mi to the first false summit. The trail then turns into a rock scramble, which can be strenuous for inexperienced hikers, for 1.1 mi to the summit and intersection with the Saddle Trail which descends 1.9 mi down the saddle of the ridge past Byrds Nest #1 shelter and <b>Old</b> <b>Rag</b> shelter to the junction with Weakley Hollow Fire Road. The Fire Road then descends 2.5 mi to the <b>Old</b> <b>Rag</b> parking area.|$|R
