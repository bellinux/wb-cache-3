2500|$|Eschewing {{the usual}} {{gatefold}} design {{in favour of}} a special die-cut cover, the original album jacket included four covers made up of two inners (for each disc), a middle insert cover and an <b>outer</b> <b>cover.</b> The middle insert cover is white and details all the album track listings and recording information. The <b>outer</b> <b>cover</b> has die-cut windows on the building, so when the middle cover is wrapped around the inner covers and slid into the <b>outer</b> <b>cover,</b> {{the title of the}} album is shown on the front cover, spelling out the name [...] "Physical Graffiti". Images in the windows touched upon a set of American icons and a range of Hollywood ephemera. Pictures of W.C. Fields and Buzz Aldrin alternated with the snapshots of Led Zeppelin. Photographs of Lee Harvey Oswald and Marcel Duchamp are also featured.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>outer</b> <b>cover</b> {{of their}} first Soundtrack album shows The Takeaways in a similar pose to the inner cover photo but has them as neon {{outlines}} whereas the second Soundtrack has the same neon oultlines but with a reversed design. The neon outlines were also animated and used on their first promo video (see [...] ).|$|E
2500|$|Experiments {{were also}} {{carried out to}} {{determine}} the most suitable material for the <b>outer</b> <b>cover,</b> resulting {{in the choice of}} a treated silk. The covering of the upper half was additionally treated to reduce heat absorption by adding aluminium powder to the coating. [...] This resulted in the underside being primrose yellow and the top aluminium coloured.|$|E

2500|$|Inside {{the cover}} are {{two layers of}} fabric with the {{magnetic}} medium sandwiched in the middle. The fabric is designed to reduce friction between the medium and the <b>outer</b> <b>cover,</b> and catch particles of debris abraded off the disk {{to keep them from}} accumulating on the heads. The cover is usually a one-part sheet, double-folded with flaps glued or spot-welded together.|$|E
2500|$|The {{design was}} based on Zeppelin bomber L-49 (LZ-96), built in 1917. L-49 was a {{lightened}} Type U [...] "height climber", designed for altitude {{at the expense of}} other qualities. The design was found insufficient and a number of the features of newer Zeppelins were used, as well as some structural improvements. The structure was built from a new alloy of aluminum and copper known as duralumin. Girders were fabricated at the Naval Aircraft Factory. Whether the changes introduced into the original design of L-49 played a part in Shenandoahs later breakup is a matter of debate. An <b>outer</b> <b>cover</b> of high-quality cotton cloth was sewn, laced or taped to the duralumin frame and painted with aluminum dope.|$|E
2500|$|Vinyl records can be warped by heat, {{improper}} storage, {{exposure to}} sunlight, or manufacturing defects such as excessively tight plastic shrinkwrap {{on the album}} cover. A small degree of warp was common, and allowing for {{it was part of}} the art of turntable and tonearm design. [...] "Wow" [...] (once-per-revolution pitch variation) could result from warp, or from a spindle hole that was not precisely centered. Standard practice for LPs was to place the LP in a paper or plastic inner cover. This, if placed within the outer cardboard cover so that the opening was entirely within the <b>outer</b> <b>cover,</b> was said to reduce ingress of dust onto the record surface. Singles, with rare exceptions, had simple paper covers with no inner cover.|$|E
5000|$|Biernagels (Biernagel, pl. Biernägel for [...] "beer nails") are conical, {{hemispherical}} or pyramid shaped fittings on the <b>outer</b> <b>covers</b> {{of books}} used in tableround and commercium type academic feasts. Primarily biernagels are used on German song books called [...] "Kommersbuch", which {{are similar to}} the studentencodex song books used in Belgium. Also guestbooks are sometimes fitted with biernagels.|$|R

2500|$|In July 1908, Captain Reginald Bacon, the Royal Navy's Director of Naval Ordnance, {{recommended}} that the Navy should acquire an airship that would compete {{with the success of}} the early German rigid airships designed by Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin. The British Government agreed that a sum of £35,000 (£ million today) [...] "should be allocated to the Admiralty for the building of a dirigible balloon", and in March 1909 the armament firm of Vickers, Sons and Maxim advised that they could construct the ship for £28,000 (£ million today), not including the goldbeater's skin gas bags and <b>outer</b> <b>cover,</b> for which the Admiralty was required to provide contractors, and that they would erect a constructional shed at their own expense in return for a 10-year monopoly on airship construction, similar to the submarine agreement they already had with the Crown. The contract was awarded to Vickers on 7 May 1909, with design responsibility divided between Lieutenant N. F. Usborne at the Admiralty and C. G. Robertson of Vickers; however, the 10-year monopoly clause was refused.|$|E
2500|$|During the American Civil War {{the number}} of Union and Confederate {{soldiers}} in prisoner of war prisons and camps would reach an astonishing {{one and a half}} million men. The prison population at the Andersonville Confederate POW camp alone reached 45,000 men by the war's end. At the onset of the war the United States did not recognize the legitimacy of the Confederate States and refused to establish a system that allowed for a formal prisoner and mail exchange. By the summer of 1862, more than a year into the war, prison populations in the north were at alarming proportions and the US government began to see the necessity of a prisoner and mail exchange system. On July 2, 1862 it signed what was referred to as a Prisoner exchange cartel, and by September of that year prison populations were almost emptied. However, as the war dragged on the US government had increasing distrust for the Confederate government and stopped the prisoner and mail exchanges in June 1863, {{less than a year after}} it had signed the exchange agreement. [...] Flag of Truce mail exchanges resumed a month later and were used until the end of the war. Prisoner mail that was carried by Flag-of-Truce had to be put in an unsealed envelope with address and postage for delivery on the other side, then placed in an <b>outer</b> <b>cover</b> for delivery to the exchange point where the outer envelope would be destroyed and the inner envelope containing the prisoner's letter was inspected. The letter would then be placed in and sealed in the stamped addressed envelope and hand-stamped indicating that the item had been inspected.|$|E

40|$|The {{results of}} an {{investigation}} of solar module encapsulation systems applicable to the Low-Cost Solar Array Project 1986 cost and performance goals are presented. Six basic construction elements were identified and their specific uses in module construction defined. A uniform coating basis was established for each element. The survey results were also useful in revealing price ranges for classes of materials and estimating the cost allocation for each element within the encapsulating cost goal. The six construction elements {{were considered to be}} substrates, superstrates, pottants, adhesives, <b>outer</b> <b>covers</b> and back covers...|$|R
50|$|Before {{wood pulp}} became widely available, paper {{was made from}} rags, which were a limited resource. In the 18th century French {{scientist}} René Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur suggested that paper could be made from trees. Though he himself never experimented, his theory caught the interest of others, namely Matthias Koops. In 1800 Koops published a book on papermaking made from straw. Its <b>outer</b> <b>covers</b> were made from trees. His method was not like Fenerty's (pulping wood); instead, he simply ground the wood and caused the particles to adhere. His book does not mention anything about wood pulping.|$|R

The site at Mangcheng is also {{surrounded by}} two, pounded earth walls: the inner wall covers {{an area of}} around 7.2 ha, while the <b>outer</b> wall <b>covers</b> an area of around 10.5 ha. The majority of buildings were made from wattle and daub technology. The site at Gucheng {{is surrounded by a}} wall enclosing an area of around 30.4 ha. The sites at Zizhu and Shuanghe are also surrounded by double walls.|$|R

60|$|But Lord Roberts A {{has been}} pretty exhaustively figured and {{described}} in various aeronautical publications. The unforeseen defect was the badness {{of the work in}} the silk netting. It tore aft as soon as I began to contract the balloon, and the last two segments immediately bulged through the hole, exactly as an inner tube will bulge through the ruptured <b>outer</b> <b>cover</b> of a pneumatic tire, and then the sharp edge of the torn net cut the oiled-silk of the distended last segment along a weak seam and burst it with a loud report.|$|E

6000|$|This was {{the story}} which I read in the {{newspaper}} during breakfast one morning in November. I was deeply grieved, rather than astonished, for I have often remonstrated with poor Grannom on the recklessness of his wading. It was with some surprise that I received, {{in the course of}} the day, a letter from him, in which he spoke only of indifferent matters, of the fishing which he had taken, and so forth. The letter was accompanied, however, by a parcel. Tearing off the <b>outer</b> <b>cover,</b> I found a sealed document addressed to me, with the superscription, [...] "Not to be opened until after my father's decease." [...] This injunction, of course, I have scrupulously obeyed. The death of Lord Whitchurch, the last of the Grannoms, now gives me liberty to publish my friend's Apologia pro morte et vita sua.|$|E

5000|$|The {{original}} {{series of}} 23 Chip Hilton books {{has become a}} popular collectible, with the last few books fetching the highest prices because of their relatively limited print runs. The first six Chip Hilton titles were originally issued in fire-engine red, smooth textured bindings, with blank <b>outer</b> <b>covers</b> and full color picture dust jackets. These first six titles were later re-issued with blank rougher tweed cover bindings and picture dust jackets, as were the first editions of issues #7 through #19.
