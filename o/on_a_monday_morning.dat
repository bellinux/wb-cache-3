500|$|The {{episode was}} {{recorded}} at the Darryl F. Zanuck Building on the 20th Century Fox lot in West Los Angeles, where {{the cast and}} crew of The Simpsons gathered <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Monday</b> <b>morning</b> in October 1993. Before the recording session took part, the main voice actors of the show (Dan Castellaneta, Harry Shearer, Julie Kavner, Yeardley Smith, Nancy Cartwright, and Hank Azaria) sat down with executive producer David Mirkin and a crew of writers at a table reading to determine what shape the script was in. There was [...] "genuine hearty laughter at various points" [...] during the script run-through, said Ray Richmond, a reporter for the Los Angeles Daily News. Immediately after the reading, the crew of writers hurried to make script changes based on what got laughs and what did not, while the actors waited impatiently. Mirkin told Richmond that the script would require the equivalent of ten rewrites: [...] "At every step, there are amendments and additions and refinements." [...] Richmond commented that as the recording session started, the [...] "astounding versatility" [...] of the actors became clear; [...] "Castellaneta bounces from being Homer to Grampa to Barney without taking a breath and minus any evident vocal similarities." [...] Mirkin said the episode was also a tour de force for Kavner, who in one scene voices Marge, Marge's two sisters, and Marge's mother. He added that even though she enjoyed the process, it was tough on Kavner's voice because those characters talk with [...] "gravelly voices".|$|E

2500|$|Coverage {{was mostly}} negative. Richard Dorment wrote in The Daily Telegraph: [...] "The {{shortlist}} for this year's Turner Prize is so wilfully opaque it's irrelevant." [...] In his opinion the artists selected exemplified [...] "Euro-art, a term I've {{made up to}} describe {{a certain kind of}} technically competent, bland, and ultimately empty art made specifically for international biennales." [...] Similarly, Jonathan Jones wrote in The Guardian that the show [...] "reflect a mentality only too dominant in art magazines and curating right nowa rather overthought, overtalked, pseudo-intellectual culture." [...] In The Times, Rachel Campbell-Johnston wrote, [...] "I can't help thinking that this show will prove ... like the returns desk of Ikea <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Monday</b> <b>morning.</b> Lots of frustrated people will be left staring at a pile of inscrutable junk." [...] In the Financial Times, Jackie Wullschlager wrote, [...] "Don’t go. Don’t even think about going. This year’s Turner Prize exhibition is without competition the worst {{in the history of the}} award.... a killer mix of self-indulgence and academicism." [...] Laura Cumming in The Observer agreed, [...] "If ever you were thinking of giving the Turner Prize a miss then 2008 is the ideal year." [...] saying that [...] "t is not that the art is wilfully bad ... it is just that it is almost entirely inactive." [...] In contrast, Adrian Searle wrote in The Guardian: [...] "here's a depth and complexity [...] that, it would be nice to think, might overtake the usual chat about winners and losers." ...|$|E

The 4  cm irregular swelling is not painful but rather sensitive. The skin on the swelling is a little red and dimpled.

Angela’s mother died of breast cancer when she was only 50  years of age 10  years ago. Her mother’s father had an unknown cancer and died at age 55. Angela tells you, when you further ask her for her family history, her sister had bilateral breast cancer at age 30 and died of ovarian cancer at age 33, two years ago. Her two other and younger sisters seem healthy.|$|R

When she did descend she beheld words chalked upon the sloping face of the bureau; but no husband or sons.

On the Wednesday, when the hounds met within two miles of Chowton, he again stayed at home; but in the afternoon he rode into Dillsborough and contrived to see the attorney without being seen by any of the ladies of the family. The interview did not seem to do him any good. On the Thursday morning he walked across to Bragton and with a firm voice asked to see the Squire. Morton who was deep in the boundary question put aside his papers and welcomed his neighbour.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Neefit's conduct {{during this}} period of {{disappointment}} was not exactly what it should to have been, either in the bosom of his family or among his dependents in Conduit Street. Herr Bawwah, over a pot of beer in the public-house opposite, suggested to Mr. Waddle that [...] "the governor might be ----," [...] in a manner that affected Mr. Waddle greatly. It was an eloquent and energetic expression of opinion,--almost an expression of a settled purpose as coming from the German as it did come; and Waddle was bound to admit that cause had been given. [...] "Fritz," [...] said Waddle pathetically, [...] "don't think about it. You can't better the wages." [...] Herr Bawwah looked up from his pot of beer and muttered a German oath. He had been told that he was beastly, skulking, pig-headed, obstinate, drunken, with some other perhaps stronger epithets which may be omitted,--and he had been told that he was a German. In that had lain the venom. There was the word that rankled. He had another pot of beer, and though it was then only twelve o'clock <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Monday</b> <b>morning</b> Herr Bawwah swore {{that he was going to}} make a day of it, and that old Neefit might cut out the stuff for himself if he pleased. As they were now at the end of March, which is not a busy time of the year in Mr. Neefit's trade, the great artist's defalcation was of less immediate importance; but, as Waddle knew, the German was given both to beer and obstinacy when aroused to wrath; and what would become of the firm should the obstinacy continue? ...|$|E

The Indian bills had arrived, and been protested in the City on the previous Saturday. The Campaigner and Mrs. Rosey had arranged a little party to the theatre that evening, and the gallant Captain Goby had agreed to quit the delights of the Flag Club, in order to accompany the ladies. Neither of them knew {{what was happening in the}} City, or could account otherwise than by the common domestic causes, for Clive's gloomy despondency and his father's sad reserve. Clive had not been in the City on this day. He had spent it, as usual, in his studio, boude by his wife, and not disturbed by the messroom raillery of the Campaigner. They had dined early, in order to be in time for the theatre. Goby entertained them with the latest jokes from the smoking-room at the Flag, and was in his turn amused by the brilliant plans for the season which Rosey and her mamma sketched out the entertainments which Mrs. Clive proposed to give, the ball--she was dying for a masked ball just such a one as that was described in the Pall Mall Gazette of last week, out of that paper with the droll title, the Bengal Hurkaru, which the merchant-prince, the head of the bank, you know, in India, had given at Calcutta. [...] "We must have a ball, too," [...] says Mrs. Mackenzie; [...] "society demands it of you."
