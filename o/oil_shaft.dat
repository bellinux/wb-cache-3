50|$|Lubrication of {{the first}} {{high-speed}} engines, such as the Ideal (an open-crank horizontal engine), were lubricated by a development of the oil cup systems previously widespread on medium-speed stationary engines. Oil cups and multi-point lubricators could <b>oil</b> <b>shaft</b> bearings well enough and a single sight-glass could be observed by even the most careless engine driver or oiler. The difficulty was that on high-speed engines, oilers {{could no longer be}} mounted on moving parts, such as the crosshead or connecting rod. Any oil reservoir here would be churned around by the movement and such a necessarily small reserve might also be inadequate incapacity for an engine doing so much work in a small space. More care was thus given to the thoroughness of oiling, and moving parts such as the crankpin were fed by drillings through the crankshaft from oil supplies that were rotating but not moving, such as the main bearings. Centrifugal force was also used to distribute the oil. It was usual that high-speed engines would have only one or two lubricators, so that engine tending was a simpler task and less prone to breakdowns from simple carelessness and running a lubricator dry.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in brush seal {{gas turbine engine}} applications show the promise that carefully designed bristle packs can also function as oil and oil mist seals. Because brush seals are primarily contact seals, oil temperature rise and coking become major concerns in addition to leakage performance. Although individual bristles form very small bearing surfaces, hydrodynamic forces generated by viscous sealing medium combined with high surface speeds may easily lift the compliant bristle pack off the shaft surface. Amount of lift affects seal operating clearance, which - in return - determines oil temperature rise and leakage rate. Balancing these two conflicting performance criteria depends on good understanding of the bristle hydrodynamic lift. This work presents an analytical solution to bristle lift forces based on long bearing assumptions. Starting with general 2 -D Reynolds Equation, formulation is simplified taking advantage of seal geometry.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to get a better {{knowledge}} of the ancient Iulia Concordia trades moving from the analysis of six lead labels found in the second quarter of the 19 th century. In the 1878, during the excavation of a Roman canal at Concordia Dario Bertolini unearthed ten inscribed lead labels. In a few these items were taken to Rome and Naples and later published in Notizie degli Scavi by Bertolini himself. Notwithstanding several past attempts, only recently Giovannella Cresci Marrone and Elena Pettenò have successfully read the labels thanks to high definition photographs. It is now evident that, with the exception of two tabulae defixiones and two account records, the other six labels relate to goods including vellera (i. e. wool) and other materials, such as spikenard or myrrh <b>oil,</b> arrow <b>shafts,</b> animal glue. In the light of new archaeological discoveries and topographic studies, that allowed the reconstruction of the hydrographic system of the Roman colonia and its territory, it is possible to trace the itinerary followed by the traded goods from their place of production to Concordia. In spite of the plethora of data related to the commercial activity of Roman Concordia, many que–stions on the real identity of vellera remain open: were they traded goods or simple packing? Were they high quality wools or not? Where did they come from? Were they re-used after reaching Concordia? And, what was their shape and size? This paper will try to answer to these questions...|$|R
50|$|From Byzantine times (4th century CE) through 1923 Derinkuyu {{was known}} by its Cappadocian Greek {{inhabitants}} as Malakopea (Μαλακοπέα).

50|$|Although a {{powerful}} engine for its time, the 16 Valve engine can experience some {{problems that can}} be solved easily. One of the few problems is oil pump gear problems leading to broken timing belts. The oil pump gear itself can fail around the mounting flange, or, more often, the weak 8.8(grade 5) grade bolt holding the gear can break. It is strongly recommended to use a 10.9 (grade 8) grade bolt when replacing the oil pump gear. Another cause for timing belt failure is improperly adjusting the timing belt on engines with a manual tensioner (1989 to very early 1990 models only) or improperly adjusting the balance shaft belt. Because this is an interference engine, damage will occur if the timing belt fails. Another common occurrence is that the balance <b>shaft's</b> <b>oil</b> seals are prone to leak on older engines. New replacement sealings tend to start leaking again due to 'worn in irregularities' on the shaft itself. Many people have removed the balance shaft belt or the balance shaft assemblies altogether to prevent belt failure and/or leakage. The balance shafts are only there to lessen high rpm second order vibrations, and removing them will only affect high rpm vibrations. Once all the common problems are solved, the 16 Valve engines are just as reliable as their SOHC counterparts.|$|R

40|$|Tutorialpg. 113 Interest in nonoil {{lubricated}} bearings is growing, due to {{a number}} of benefits derived from these bearings: improved pump performance and reliability, enhanced pump maintainability, elimination of the cost and maintenance of separate systems for lubrication <b>oil</b> and <b>shaft</b> seals, reduction in pump size and weight, reduced power consumption, elimination of oil disposal costs, elimination of potential for product contamination, and elimination of leakage of hazardous fluids to the environment. This trend has allowed two types of nonoil lubricated bearings to grow in favor: 1) bearings lubricated by the process media and 2) magnetic bearings. The state-of-the-art in these different technologies is applied to pumps, is examined to identify what the current limits in the application of these technologies are. In the case of product lubricated bearings, the present mechanical limits, film thickness, and temperature limits, as related to different material and lubricant combinations, are reviewed by reference to bearing theory of operation and actual pump application. The role of various lubricant and material properties and mechanical design features are reviewed for these types of bearings. In addition, the importance of proper lubricant circulation and filtering is highlighted. The relationship of the above design parameters to specific load, speed, and temperature is examined to produce limiting operating envelopes for these types of bearings, similar to that previously developed for oil lubricated tilting pad bearings. Magnetic bearing applications completely circumvent the dry running and contamination issues raised by product lubricated bearings and offer unmatched capabilities in pump diagnostic. Space envelope and cost are usually not as favorable as product lubricated bearings. Limitations in operation of magnetic bearings are related to specific load, frequency, temperature, and system stability. The development of limiting envelopes of operation for magnetic bearings is presented to allow pump designers and end users to assess bearing load capacity vs frequency characteristics. Control of rotor and stator natural frequencies often demands special attention to any given application. In certain submerged bearing applications, corrosion considerations represent the most restrictive limitation in the application of magnetic bearings. In theory, almost any type of process fluid may be handled with magnetic bearings, and a growing variety of applications have already been successful...|$|R

Although very much related in general configuration to the 289-302 and sharing the same bell housing, motor mounts, and other small parts, the 351W had a unique, tall-deck block, larger main bearing caps, thicker, longer connecting rods, and a distinct firing order (1-3-7-2-6-5-4-8 versus the usual 1-5-4-2-6-3-7-8, a means to move the unacceptable 'noise' of the consecutive firing adjacent front cylinders to the more rigid rear part of the engine block all while reducing excessive main bearing load), adding some 25 lb (11 kg) to the engine's dry weight. The distributor is slightly different, so as to accommodate a larger <b>oil</b> pump <b>shaft</b> and larger <b>oil</b> pump. Some years had threaded dipstick tubes. It had a unique head which optimized torque over high-rpm breathing, frequently replaced by enthusiasts with aftermarket heads providing better performance. The early 1969 and 1970 heads had larger valves and ports for better performance. The head castings and valve head sizes from 1969 to 1976 were different, notably in passages for air injection and spark plug diameters (1969-1974 18 mm, 1975 and up 14 mm). From 1977 onward, the 351W shared the same head casting as the 302, differing only in bolt hole diameters (7/16 inch for 302, 1/2 inch for 351W). Early blocks (casting ID C9OE-6015-B) had enough metal on bearing saddles 2, 3, and 4 for four-bolt mains, and as with all small-block Fords (SBFs), were superior in strength to most late-model, lightweight castings.
