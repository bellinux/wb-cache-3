5|$|Despite {{the strong}} economy, the Bay Area's housing market and cost <b>of</b> <b>living</b> <b>is</b> {{becoming}} increasingly expensive. As of 2017, {{the average income}} {{needed in order to}} purchase a house in the region was $179,390, while the median price for a house was $895,000. Because of the high cost of living, many workers in the Bay Area live far from their place of employment, contributing to one of the highest percentages of extreme commuters in the United States, or commutes that take over ninety minutes in one direction. For example, about 50,000 people commute from neighboring San Joaquin county into the nine-county Bay Area daily.|$|E

The standard <b>of</b> <b>living</b> <b>is</b> on the rise, with incomes {{among the highest in}} the Midwest, but median household income among minorities is below that of whites by over $17,000. Regionally, home ownership among minority residents is half that of whites though Asian home ownership has doubled. In 2000, the poverty rate for whites was 4.2%; for blacks it was 26.2%; for Asians, 19.1%; Native Americans, 23.2%; and Hispanics, 18.1%.|$|E

25|$|Record {{economic}} growth {{starting in the}} mid-1980s mostly erased the problem of finances preventing service. As a secondary measure, starting in 1990, paying for a mission became easier on those called to work in industrialized nations. Missionaries began paying into a church-wide general missionary fund instead of paying on their own. This amount paid (about $425 per month currently) {{is used by the}} church to pay for the costs of all missionaries, wherever they go. This enabled those going to Bolivia, whose average cost <b>of</b> <b>living</b> <b>is</b> about $100 per month, to help pay for those going to Japan, whose cost tops out at around $900 per month.|$|E

As an influence on the basics of Confucianism, his stress on guidance through music (which Dong also stressed), li, and the habits <b>of</b> <b>living</b> <b>is</b> notable, while on the other hand he lacked Dong's cosmology.|$|E
25|$|Immigrants {{may find}} {{that they are a}} part of a lower {{socioeconomic}} status group in the United States than they were in their home country. Immigration research shows that it is rarely the poorest citizens of the sending countries that immigrate to the United States, simply because they cannot afford the associated costs. This is particularly true when they come from countries where the cost <b>of</b> <b>living</b> <b>is</b> not as high as in the United States. Individuals who may have held professional occupations in their country of origin may find themselves in low-paying jobs if their certifications are not recognized by the United States. When families migrate to the United States from a country with a patriarchal society, men in particular may experience a loss of status.|$|E

40|$|By many {{measures}} {{a revolution}} in <b>living</b> conditions <b>is</b> sweeping the world. Most people today are better fed, clothed, and house than their predecessors two centuries ago. They are healthier, live longer, and are better educated. Women's lives are less centered on reproduction, and political democracy has gained a foothold. Current international differences in a number <b>of</b> standard <b>of</b> <b>living</b> indicators <b>are</b> significantly correlated.

25|$|Note {{that the}} above income {{thresholds}} may vary greatly based on region due to {{significant differences in}} average income based on region and urban, suburban, or rural development. In more expensive suburbs, the threshold for the top 15% of income earners may be much higher. For example, in 2006 the ten highest income counties had median household incomes of $85,000 compared to a national average of about $50,000. The top 15% of all US income earners nationally {{tend to be more}} concentrated in these richer suburban counties where the cost <b>of</b> <b>living</b> <b>is</b> also higher. If middle-class households earning between the 50th percentile ($46,000) and the 85th percentile ($62,500) tend to live in lower cost of living areas, then their difference in real income may be smaller than what the differences in nominal income suggest.|$|E
25|$|Socially {{the island}} is highly diverse, with the {{creative}} sector (artists, musicians, scientists, writers, poets and actors) and eccentrics strongly represented. It has 1,206 businesses but around 1,000 people commute daily to Auckland as career opportunities are limited. 60.9 per cent of the residents are in employment. The main employment sectors are hospitality (23 per cent) and retail (15%) followed by education, agriculture/horticulture and healthcare (10% each). Gentrification and land speculation is having an impact, with high rates and mortgage interest rates forcing some people on fixed incomes to relocate. New Zealand council rates are based on land and building valuations, which take into account potential value for redevelopment even if the owners live on the property and have no intention to sell or redevelop. The cost <b>of</b> <b>living</b> <b>is</b> higher compared to the mainland, due to the shipping-freight costs of most foodstuffs, fuel and amenities.|$|E
25|$|PAYE (Pay As You Earn) is a {{significant}} contributor to tax being 45%. Given the high unemployment rate the tax is quite heavy. This of course captures those that pay and keep records properly. The average salary is probably $250. This is skewed downwards by {{the large number of}} government employees whose average salary is around there. At the top end salaries are quite competitive and this {{is to be able to}} attract the right skills though the cost <b>of</b> <b>living</b> <b>is</b> high so it balances this out.
