5|$|There {{were two}} main {{handwritten}} {{forms of the}} Deseret alphabet: a cursive version and a printed version. Over the lifetime <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>alphabet,</b> the cursive form fell out of favor among most users <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>alphabet</b> and by 1856 no more cursive documents exist. Its impact on the glyphs can however still be plainly seen in the loops of certain characters such as êëÖ, êëÄ and êêº. The earliest surviving versions of the Deseret alphabet, from 1853 (one year before its January 1854 approval), have printed and cursive forms side-by-side, suggesting that a cursive form {{was part of the}} plan from the very beginning.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} several {{published}} versions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>alphabet.</b> Most versions (including the versions used in The Deseret First Book, The Deseret Second Book, The Deseret News and The Book of Mormon) had only 38 letters, but some versions contained two ligatures, êêß (ew) and êê¶ (oi). In place of êêÆêê≠ or êê∑êê≠, êëè was to be used; in place of êê±êêÆ, êëé.|$|E
5|$|The Iron Age (1200 ‚Äì 333 BCE) in Lebanon saw {{the climax}} of the Phoenician civilization, which culminated in its {{maritime}} expansion and the transmission to other cultures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>alphabet</b> (which was attributed by the Greek legend to the Tyrian Cadmus). During this period, after an era of autonomy, the city-states of the area came under Assyrian, Babylonian and Persian hegemony. The occupying civilizations influenced Phoenician ceramics, jewelry and ivory work, statues, and sarcophagi.|$|E

25|$|Berber {{languages}} {{have often}} been written in an adaptation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Arabic <b>alphabet.</b> <b>The</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Arabic <b>alphabet,</b> {{as well as the}} competing Latin and Tifinagh scripts, has political connotations.|$|R
5|$|The name-letter {{effect is}} the {{tendency}} of people to prefer the letters in their name over other letters in the alphabet. Whether subjects are asked to rank all letters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>alphabet,</b> rate each of the letters, choose the letter they prefer out {{of a set of}} two, or pick a small set of letters they most prefer, on average people consistently like the letters in their own name the most. Crucially, subjects are not aware that they are choosing letters from their name.|$|E
5|$|To be an {{automatic}} process, the effect should, for each specific person, be fairly stable over time. Koole, Dijksterhuis and van Knippenberg investigated this by asking Dutch students to rate each letter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>alphabet,</b> together with some filler questions for distraction, twice within a four-week period. They found that preferences for name letters {{did not significantly}} change {{between the first and}} second rating. Hoorens and colleagues also found that ratings remained stable when 164 subjects rated letters seven days in a row.|$|E
5|$|Amino acids {{are made}} into {{proteins}} by being joined {{together in a}} chain of peptide bonds. Each different protein has a unique sequence of amino acid residues: this is its primary structure. Just as the letters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>alphabet</b> can be combined to form an almost endless variety of words, amino acids can be linked in varying sequences to form a huge variety of proteins. Proteins are made from amino acids that have been activated by attachment to a transfer RNA molecule through an ester bond. This aminoacyl-tRNA precursor is produced in an ATP-dependent reaction carried out by an aminoacyl tRNA synthetase. This aminoacyl-tRNA is then a substrate for the ribosome, which joins the amino acid onto the elongating protein chain, using the sequence information in a messenger RNA.|$|E

25|$|Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>alphabets</b> <b>of</b> Asia Minor, in use c. 800‚Äì300 BC {{to write}} {{languages}} like Lydian and Phrygian, were <b>the</b> early Greek <b>alphabet</b> with only slight modifications ‚Äì {{as were the}} original Old Italic alphabets.|$|R
5|$|From 1879, more {{locomotives}} were needed, and {{the design}} was updated and 24 were delivered between 1879 and 1885. Originally they were painted bright olive green lined in black and yellow, chimneys copper capped with the locomotive number in brass figures at the front and domes of polished brass. In 1885, the colour changed to a dark red known as Midcared, and this was to remain the standard colour, taken up as the colour for the Metropolitan line by London Transport in 1933. When in 1925 the Met classified its locomotives by letters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>alphabet,</b> these were assigned A Class and B Class. When the M was being built, it was considered that they would struggle on the gradients and five Worcester Engine 0-6-0 tank locomotives were delivered in 1868. It was soon found that A and B Classes could manage trains without difficulty and the 0-6-0Ts were sold to the Taff Vale Railway in 1873 and 1875.|$|E
5|$|Star Fox Command {{supports}} {{six players}} in local wireless multiplayer matches via DS Download Play {{and up to}} three players on the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. In Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection matches, only the Arwing II is available. Players score not by killing opponents, but by collecting stars from them when they have been destroyed. It is also possible to collect a star from an opponent not killed by the player. This is {{a modified version of}} the mode from Star Fox 64/Lylat Wars. Nintendo WiFi uses a ranking system based on rankings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>alphabet</b> with Z being the lowest and A being the highest. Players work their way up from Z by collecting wins (it could be based on points). For every win a player gains a certain amount of percent and once they reach 100% they move to the next letter. The highest rank a player can get is 100% of the A rank.|$|E
5|$|The Letter Preference Task is the second-most popular {{method to}} measure {{implicit}} self-esteem, surpassed {{only by the}} Implicit Association Test. The task has also been called the Name Letter Preference Task, Name-Letter-Ratings Measure, and Initial Preference Task. There is no standard method for applying the task. The most commonly used one is a letter rating task, which involves having participants judge all the letters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>alphabet.</b> Even within this method there are variations in the instructions (how much you like the letters or how attractive you find them), in the rating scales (five-point, seven-point, or nine-point), {{in the order of}} the letters (random or alphabetical), and in data collection (paper-and-pencil or computer-based).|$|E

25|$|Also, some Yiddish-speakers {{have adopted}} <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Latin <b>alphabet,</b> in place <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hebrew <b>alphabet.</b> This is {{predominantly}} to enable communications over the internet, {{without the need}} for special Hebrew keyboards.|$|R
5|$|Until this point, all {{the printed}} {{material}} (mostly just charts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>alphabet</b> and its standard orthography equivalents) had been produced with large wooden type, {{which was not}} suitable for printing at small sizes. Because the alphabet was wholly unique, no font existed, so in 1857 {{the board of regents}} appointed Erastus Snow to procure metal type from St. Louis-based font foundry Ladew & Peer. However, in May 1857 the Utah War began, and Snow left St. Louis to support the Mormon pioneers. During the war, Ladew & Peer kept working on the type, and the punches and matrices were delivered in the winter of 1858. The first use of the new type was to make a business card for George A. Smith, an early Mormon historian.|$|E
5|$|In Tantra, {{the fifty}} or fifty-one letters {{including}} vowels {{as well as}} consonants from A to Ksha, of the Devanagari alphabet itself, the Varnamala of bija, {{have been described as}} being the Matrikas themselves. It is believed that they are infused with the power of the Divine Mother herself. The Matrikas are considered to be the subtle form of the letters (varna). These letters combined make up syllables (pada) which are combined to make sentences (vakya) and it is of these elements that mantra is composed. It is believed that the power of mantra derives {{from the fact that the}} letters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>alphabet</b> are in fact forms of the goddess. The 50 Matrika Kalas are given in the same account as follows: Nivritti, Pratishtha, Vidya, Shanti, Indhika, Dipika, Mochika, Para, Sukshma, Sukshmamrita, Jnanamrita, Apypayani, Vyapini, Vyomarupa, Ananta, Srishti, Riddhi, Smriti, Medha, Kanti, Lakshmi, Dyuti, Sthira, Sthiti, Siddhi, Jada, Palini, Shanti, Aishvarya, Rati, Kamika, Varada, Ahladini, Pritih, Dirgha, Tikshna, Raudri, Bhaya, Nidra, Tadra, Kshudha, Krodhini, Kriya, Utkari, Mrityurupa, Pita, Shveta, Asita, Ananta. Sometimes, the Matrikas represent a diagram written in the letter, believed to possess magical powers.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for the landing orders were issued to ensure everyone was fit and to concentrate on weapons firing and street fighting. The two French troops were still under command and just for this operation No. 4 Commando took command of a section from the Dutch Troop, No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando, and groups from the Special Boat Section (SBS), Royal Engineers and the Royal Artillery to call for artillery fire support. For some reason the old method of calling troops by letters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>alphabet</b> was dropped and the troops were now numbered. The No.1 to No.4 Troops were British and No.s 5 and 6 French. The heavy weapons troop was No. 4 Troop. The final plan for the assault was for the SBS and a section from No. 1 Troop, to go first and reconnoitre a suitable landing point. Following them, the rest of No.1, No. 2 Troop and commando headquarters would secure the beachhead. They would then {{be joined by the}} remaining troops, passing through the beachhead and into the town. No.1 Troop would secure the left flank and No. 2 Troop the right.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Arabic <b>alphabet</b> {{concerns}} <b>the</b> {{origins and}} <b>the</b> evolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Arabic script. It {{is thought that}} <b>the</b> Arabic <b>alphabet</b> is a derivative <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nabataean variation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Aramaic <b>alphabet,</b> which descended from <b>the</b> Phoenician <b>alphabet,</b> which, among others, gave rise to <b>the</b> Hebrew <b>alphabet</b> and <b>the</b> Greek <b>alphabet</b> (and therefore <b>the</b> Cyrillic and Roman alphabets).|$|R

5|$|Officially, <b>the</b> Deseret <b>alphabet</b> {{was created}} to simplify <b>the</b> {{spelling}} <b>of</b> English words for <b>the</b> benefit <b>of</b> children and English {{as a second language}} learners. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>alphabet's</b> contemporaries, however, posited an alternative motivation for its development: increasing <b>the</b> isolation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early Mormons.|$|R
5|$|The East Stand at Old Trafford was {{the second}} to be {{converted}} to a cantilever roof, following the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand. It is also {{commonly referred to as}} the Scoreboard End, as it was the location of the scoreboard. The East Stand can currently hold nearly 12,000fans, and is the location of both the disabled fans section and the away section; an experiment involving the relocation of away fans to the third tier of the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand was conducted during the 2011‚Äì12 season, but the results of the experiments could not be ascertained in time to make the move permanent for the 2012‚Äì13 season. The disabled section provides for up to 170 fans, with free seats for carers. Old Trafford was formerly divided into sections, with each section sequentially assigned a letter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>alphabet.</b> Although every section had a letter, it is the K Stand that is the most commonly referred to today. The K Stand fans were renowned for their vocal support for the club, and a large array of chants and songs, though many of them have relocated to the second tier of the West Stand.|$|E
25|$|The {{choices of}} letters {{come from the}} {{original}} convention, which {{is to use the}} latter part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>alphabet</b> to indicate unknown values. The first part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>alphabet</b> was used to designate known values.|$|E
25|$|In algebra, {{the letter}} a {{along with other}} letters at the {{beginning}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>alphabet</b> is used to represent known quantities, whereas the letters at the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>alphabet</b> (x, y, z) are used to denote unknown quantities.|$|E
25|$|As <b>the</b> {{last letter}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Greek <b>alphabet,</b> Omega {{is often used}} to denote the last, the end, or <b>the</b> {{ultimate}} limit <b>of</b> a set, in contrast to alpha, <b>the</b> first letter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Greek <b>alphabet.</b>|$|R
5|$|Word <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new <b>alphabet</b> soon spread outside Utah, {{and most}} press reports in non-Mormon papers were critical.
