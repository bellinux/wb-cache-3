That was the other thing – everyone reacts to the problem differently so there's no textbook way of playing Ruth in her present situation. In fact, the way I'm playing her now might surprise some people because in the past she's been such a strong character and here she is collapsed and weeping and thinking the worst. Occasionally you may suggest to the script editor that you don't think your character will react a certain way, but with Ruth I have absolute trust in the scriptwriter's characterisation.|$|E

He has occasionally attended the {{meetings of the}} Bilderberg Group, and has read a paper to the Mont Pelerin Society. But he served as Minister of Foreign Affairs for only one year. In autumn 2005, Davíð {{announced that he would}} leave politics, saying that he felt the time had come for a new generation to take over. His close ally over many years, Geir H. Haarde, replaced him, as both leader of the Independence Party and Minister of Foreign Affairs. A probable contribution to this decision was a short, but dramatic, bout of cancer, soon after the crisis over the failure of the media bill. He is in remission.|$|E
25|$|A Buddy System {{has also}} been {{implemented}} into multiplayer. At {{the beginning of each}} match, the player may be joined with a random partner <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> if joining their game. The buddy's emblem remains displayed as part of the player's HUD to indicate their location relative to the player's own on the map. With your Buddy, you can do a cooperative taunt over dead enemies you defeated together, and can also collect each other's earned treasures for them. The player is able to spawn next to his buddy so long as the buddy remains alive and out of combat. With the aim of making the multiplayer more flexible and accessible, several logistical improvements have been added, such as the capability to join games in progress or for two different PlayStation Network accounts to play together in split-screen multiplayer on a single console. In the event of ties or near-ties, matches enter an elimination mode as they wind down, in which the players are restricted to one life and must compete to wipe out all of the opposing team's members first within the allotted remaining time.|$|E

500|$|In November 2011 the McCanns {{testified before}} the Leveson Inquiry into British press standards. The inquiry heard that {{the editor of the}} Daily Express, in particular, had become [...] "obsessed" [...] with the couple. Express {{headlines}} included that Madeleine had been [...] "killed by sleeping pills", [...] "Find body or McCanns will escape", and McCanns <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> must be to blame, the latter based on an interview with a waiter. [...] "Maddie 'Sold' By Hard-Up McCanns" [...] ran a headline in the Daily Star, part of the Express group. Lord Justice Leveson called the articles [...] "complete piffle". Roy Greenslade described them as [...] "no journalistic accident, but a sustained campaign of vitriol against a grief-stricken family".|$|E
500|$|Newspapers also reported, in July 1829, {{that the}} Duke {{had been thrown}} out of Lord Lyndhurst's house for assaulting his wife Sarah, Lady Lyndhurst. In early 1830, a number of {{newspapers}} printed articles hinting that Ernest {{was having an affair}} with Lady Graves, a mother of fifteen now past fifty. In February 1830, Lord Graves wrote a note to his wife expressing his confidence in her innocence, then cut his own throat. Two days after Lord Graves's death (and the day after the inquest), The Times printed an article connecting Lord Graves's death with Sellis's. After being shown the suicide note, The Times withdrew its implication there might be a connection between the two deaths. Nonetheless, many believed the Duke responsible for the suicide—or guilty of a second murder. The Duke later stated that he had been [...] "accused of every crime in the decalogue". Ernest's biographer, Anthony Bird, states that while there is no proof, he has no doubt that the rumours against the Duke were spread by the Whigs for political ends. Another biographer, Geoffrey Willis, pointed out that no scandal had attached itself to the Duke during the period of over a decade when he resided in Germany; it was only when he announced his intent to return to Britain that [...] "a campaign of unparalleled viciousness" [...] began against him. The Duke of Wellington once told Charles Greville that George IV had said of Ernest's unpopularity, [...] "there was never a father well with his son, or husband with his wife, or lover with his mistress, <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> with his friend, that he did not try to make mischief between them." [...] According to Bird, Ernest was the most unpopular man in England.|$|E

In addition, he said that, [...] "absolutely no good has come from J Street's soft policy on Iran.

2500|$|The main {{criticism}} of alleged non-human creation of crop circles {{is that while}} evidence of these origins, besides eyewitness testimonies, is essentially absent, some are definitely known to {{be the work of}} human pranksters, and others can be adequately explained as such. There have been cases in which researchers declared crop circles to be [...] "the real thing", only to be confronted with the people who created the circle and documented the fraud, like Bower and Chorley and tabloid Today hoaxing Pat Delgado, the Wessex Sceptics and Channel 4's Equinox hoaxing Terence Meaden, <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> of a Canadian farmer hoaxing a field researcher of the Canadian Crop Circle Research Network. In his 1997 book , Carl Sagan concludes that crop circles were created by Bower and Chorley and their copycats, and speculates that UFOlogists willingly ignore the evidence for hoaxing so they can keep believing in an extraterrestrial origin of the circles. Many others have demonstrated how complex crop circles can be created. Scientific American published an article by Matt Ridley, who started making crop circles in northern England in 1991. He wrote about {{how easy it is to}} develop techniques using simple tools that can easily fool later observers. He reported on [...] "expert" [...] sources such as The Wall Street Journal, who had been easily fooled and mused about why people want to believe supernatural explanations for phenomena that are not yet explained. Methods of creating a crop circle are now well documented on the Internet.|$|E
2500|$|Former {{guidance}} counselor {{for students at}} Andover and college admissions authority, Donald Dunbar, suggested that essays must emphasize personal character and demonstrate intellectual curiosity, maturity, social conscience, concern for the community, tolerance, and inclusiveness. He advises don't just [...] "be yourself", but show your [...] "best self", and that demonstrating class participation suggests a [...] "willingness to go beyond selfishness" [...] and shows enthusiasm for learning. Alan Gelb suggests that the only no-no is [...] "shameless self-promotion". Topics to avoid include babysitting experiences, pets, encounters with illegal drugs or alcohol or criminal activity, excuses to explain a low grade, stories about a former home or big brother or sister, simply listing achievements, expressing thanks for being chosen as a leader, talking about a [...] "wilderness leadership course", general complaining or whining, racism or sexism or disrespect for groups of people, bad taste or profanity or vulgarity or bathroom humor, early love or sex experiences, criticism or disrespect for parents, telling only jokes, excessive bragging or too many instances of the [...] "I" [...] pronoun, divulging personal health information about yourself <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> or a family member, copy-and-pasting a term paper in the essay form such as about global warming or the European debt crisis, and experiences involving lawbreaking or illegal activity. Applicants should not express opinions too strongly as if no possible counterviews were possible. The topic should be something the applicant cares about, and should show leadership {{in the sense of}} [...] "asserting yourself to help others have more success." [...] According to Dunbar, leadership is not necessarily about being in charge such as being the team captain or school president. Applicants should present a broad perspective and avoid simplistic words such as never, always, only, or nobody, which suggest narrow thinking. Dunbar advised against the standard [...] "tell 'em what you've told 'em" [...] essay formula but doing something different, interesting, and exciting.|$|E

2500|$|Spodomancy is {{an ancient}} and {{globally}} widespread divination practice. The ancient Greek playwright Aeschylus (525 BC–456 BC) noted that ashes falling from a fireplace could be divined for portents. A word, phrase, name, or question would be written in the ashes with a finger or stick. [...] The individual would wait for a breeze to disturb the ashes, which would form new letters or omens and provide an answer. Not everyone could practice the art. The gift of prophecy was believed to run in some Greek families, and only {{they were allowed to}} seek divination from the ashes left by fires on sacrificial altars. In Ancient Thebes, the altar dedicated to Apollo was known as [...] "Apollo of the Ashes" [...] not only because the altar itself was composed of the ashes of human sacrificial victims but because ashes blowing off the altar could be divined for their portents. The Etruscans of the Italian peninsula, whose civilization existed from 1200 BC to 550 BC, also practiced spodomancy in a fashion similar to the Greeks. Romani (Gypsy) folklore says ashes can be cast onto the floor. Smooth, uniform ashes are a good omen, while a pile (or piles) of ashes indicate bad fortune. During the Qin (221 BC–206 BC) and Han (206 BCE–220 CE) dynasties in China, a form of spodomancy was used in which the bones of sacrificial animals were raked out of fires and the marks in the ashes and cracks in the bones interpreted for their portents. Several Native American tribes believed that they could divine the future of a newborn <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> who had left on a journey by looking in the marks and lines left in the ashes of a fire the next morning. From the 16th century to mid 19th century, unmarried English people would draw lines in smooth ashes. If another unmarried person sat down so that the line pointed to him or her, the line was an indication of a future spouse. In Kent, this custom was used on Valentine's Day to divine who one should court. Peruvians in the late 19th century would spread ashes on the floor the night after a funeral. The next morning, footprints and other marks in the ashes would indicate what kind of animal the dead person's soul had migrated into and the direction in which that animal might be found. Among the Loma people of western Africa, spodomancy is still (as of the late 20th century) used to divine the sex of a child before birth. Chinese people in Taiwan still use the ends of sedan chair poles to mark incense ash on altars, and then interpret the marks for divine communication.|$|E
