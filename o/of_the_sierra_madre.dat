5|$|Later on October23, rapid {{weakening}} ensued as an eyewall replacement cycle {{took shape}} and wind shear increased. In the five hours up until landfall in Mexico, Patricia weakened at an unprecedented rate while still over water. However, it remained a violent hurricane and moved ashore around 23:00UTC near Cuixmala, Jalisco, with winds of 150mph (240km/h) and an analyzed pressure of 932mbar (hPa; 27.49inHg). This {{made it the}} most intense Pacific hurricane on record to strike Mexico. Once onshore, the high terrain <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sierra</b> <b>Madre</b> mountains accelerated Patricia's weakening. The low- and mid-level circulations of the tropical cyclone decoupled, with the latter accelerating northeast, and Patricia dissipated on October24 over central Mexico, less than 18hours after moving ashore.|$|E

5|$|The dump months {{evolved over}} the course of the 20th century. Although during the studio era most major {{releases}} followed annual patterns similar to today's, several classics like The Kid, Shadow of a Doubt and The Treasure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sierra</b> <b>Madre</b> were released during January. Since the decline of the studios, however, memorable films from the dump months have become rare exceptions. The most notable is The Silence of the Lambs, a well-reviewed box office smash released in late January 1991 that went on to win that year's Academy Award for Best Picture. Several years before that, Dirty Dancing and Fatal Attraction became hits following releases in August and September respectively.|$|E
5|$|Around 2100UTC on September20, Gert made a final {{landfall}} at {{peak intensity}} {{on the coast}} of Mexico, just north of Tuxpan, Veracruz. The hurricane accelerated and weakened rapidly over the mountainous region <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sierra</b> <b>Madre</b> Oriental, diminishing to a tropical depression by September21. Despite the degeneration, the large circulation remained intact as it crossed the country. Gert exited the coast of Nayarit and entered the Pacific Ocean later that day, where the NHC reclassified it as Tropical Depression Fourteen-E. The remaining deep convection waxed and waned in intensity; satellite observations indicated the depression could have briefly been a tropical storm on September22. It continued a west to west-northwestward motion for two days, though low-level flow steered it toward the southwest after the convection diminished. There was no redevelopment due to cool sea temperatures, and the system dissipated at sea on September26.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} the first in the series to feature the {{character}} of Worf, who had previously been a character on , in a central storyline.

The sword itself was created specifically for the episode, and was made to seem more elaborate than the bat'leths previously seen in Star Trek, including hand etchings to make it appear similar to Damascus steel. Composer David Bell sought to bring influences of Richard Wagner into the score, including the use of Wagner tubas. Although producers were disappointed with the initial fan reaction, critics later gave a mostly positive response to the episode and compared it to Indiana Jones and The Treasure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sierra</b> <b>Madre.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{two films}} most {{commonly}} compared to Greed are Huston's The Treasure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sierra</b> <b>Madre</b> and Welles' The Magnificent Ambersons. Rosenbaum believes that besides Huston's film ending with gold being {{lost in the}} desert and similarities between Trina's descent into madness with Fred C. Dobbs own obsessions, the two films have little else in common. The Magnificent Ambersons and Greed both have characters who struggle with class differences that lead to their downfall. Ambersons was famously edited down drastically by its studio and the cut footage is now lost. Rosenbaum goes on to state that Greed influenced the methods in which novels are adapted into films and filmmakers like Welles, Huston and Bill Forsyth followed von Stroheim's example by re-arranging the plot and adding new scenes to their films while still remaining faithful to {{the intentions of the}} original novels. The 1994 Jonathan Lynn film Greedy pays tribute to the film by giving the main characters the last name McTeague.|$|E
5|$|The codex {{is said to}} {{have been}} found {{enclosed}} in a wooden box in a dry cave in the highlands of Chiapas near Tortuguero; it was said to have been found with a turquoise mask that is now in the collection of Dumbarton Oaks. In 1965 Mexican collector Dr. Josué Sáenz was taken by two men on a light plane to a remote airstrip in the foothills <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sierra</b> <b>Madre</b> near Tortuguero in Tabasco state; the compass of the plane was covered with a cloth but Sáenz recognized his approximate location. At the airstrip he was shown the codex along with some other looted Maya artifacts and was told that he could take the items back to Mexico City for authentication before purchasing them. The antiquities expert that Sáenz consulted declared that the artifacts were fakes but Sáenz later purchased the codex and permitted Michael Coe to display the codex at the Grolier Club in 1971. In 1976, the United States-Mexico Artifacts Treaty of 1970 was invoked by the Attorney General of Mexico. This resulted in the seizure of the codex and its return to Mexico. Sáenz donated the codex to the Mexican government and it is currently kept in a vault in the Museo Nacional de Antropología in Mexico City and is not on public display. The claimed discovery of the Grolier Codex would make it the only pre-Columbian codex discovered in the course of the 20th century, except for some codex fragments excavated by archaeologists.|$|E
