25|$|The voltage {{at which}} the {{dielectric}} becomes conductive is called the breakdown voltage, and is given by {{the product of the}} dielectric strength and the separation between the electrodes. The dielectric strength depends on temperature, frequency, shape of the electrodes, etc. Because a breakdown in a capacitor normally is a short circuit and destroys the component, the <b>operating</b> <b>voltage</b> is lower than the breakdown voltage. The <b>operating</b> <b>voltage</b> is specified such that the voltage may be applied continuously throughout the life of the capacitor.|$|E

With the same activated carbon electrode an aqueous electrolyte achieves capacitance values of 160F/g, while an organic electrolyte achieves only 100F/g.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} (i) {{a resource}} constrained scheduling scheme and (ii) a latency-constrained scheduling scheme that minimize power consumption {{for the case}} when the resources <b>operate</b> at multiple <b>voltages.</b> The resource-constrained scheduling reduces the power consumption by maximally utilizing resources <b>operating</b> at reduced <b>voltages</b> {{and at the same}} time reducing the latency. The latency-constrained scheduling scheme reduces the power consumption by assigning as many nodes (of the data flow graph) as possible to the resources <b>operating</b> at reduced <b>voltages.</b> Two cases have been studied: one in which the possible <b>operating</b> <b>voltages</b> are 5 V and 3. 3 V, and the other in which the <b>operating</b> <b>voltages</b> are 5 V, 3. 3 V and 2. 4 V. Experiments with some HLS benchmark examples show that the proposed schemes achieve significant power reduction. 1...|$|R
25|$|Modern {{versions}} of the Geiger counter use the halogen tube invented in 1947 by Sidney H. Liebson. It superseded the earlier Geiger tube because of its much longer life and lower <b>operating</b> <b>voltage,</b> typically 400-600 volts.|$|E
25|$|Fixed {{resistors}} have resistances {{that only}} change slightly with temperature, time or <b>operating</b> <b>voltage.</b> Variable resistors {{can be used}} to adjust circuit elements (such as a volume control or a lamp dimmer), or as sensing devices for heat, light, humidity, force, or chemical activity.|$|E
25|$|Lifetimes {{are also}} {{dependent}} on the <b>operating</b> <b>voltage,</b> because the development of gas in the liquid electrolyte depends on the voltage. The lower the voltage the smaller the gas development and the longer the lifetime. No general formula relates voltage to lifetime. The voltage dependent curves shown from the picture are an empirical result from one manufacturer.|$|E
50|$|Through {{the late}} 1980s and 1990s newer {{versions}} of this family were introduced to support the lower <b>operating</b> <b>voltages</b> used in newer CPU devices.|$|R
50|$|In addition, {{guest host}} {{displays}} usually require higher <b>operating</b> <b>voltages</b> than TN or STN displays. For example, the polymer dispersed {{liquid crystal display}} (also called a P.D.L.C. display), is usually <b>operated</b> at <b>voltages</b> from 4.5V to 24V to as high as 100V. Similarly, dichroic dye containing guest host displays, require voltages from 4.5V to 10V and higher.|$|R

25|$|CFLs {{typically}} have a rated service life of 6,000–15,000 hours, whereas standard incandescent lamps have a service life of 750 or 1,000 hours. However, the actual lifetime of any lamp depends on many factors, including <b>operating</b> <b>voltage,</b> manufacturing defects, exposure to voltage spikes, mechanical shock, frequency of cycling on and off, lamp orientation, and ambient operating temperature, among other factors.|$|E
25|$|American {{physical}} chemist Ching W. Tang and Steven Van Slyke at Eastman Kodak {{built the first}} practical OLED device in 1987. This device used a two-layer structure with separate hole transporting and electron transporting layers such that recombination and light emission occurred {{in the middle of}} the organic layer; this resulted in a reduction in <b>operating</b> <b>voltage</b> and improvements in efficiency.|$|E
25|$|Electromechanical {{protective}} relays operate by either magnetic attraction, or magnetic induction. Unlike switching type electromechanical relays with fixed and usually ill-defined <b>operating</b> <b>voltage</b> thresholds and operating times, {{protective relays}} have well-established, selectable, and adjustable time and current (or other operating parameter) operating characteristics. Protection relays may use arrays of induction disks, shaded-pole, magnets, operating and restraint coils, solenoid-type operators, telephone-relay contacts, and phase-shifting networks.|$|E

25|$|The Daniell cell {{was a great}} {{improvement}} over the existing technology used {{in the early days}} of battery development and was the first practical source of electricity. It provided a longer and more reliable current than the Voltaic cell.It was also safer and less corrosive. It had an <b>operating</b> <b>voltage</b> of roughly 1.1 volts. It soon became the industry standard for use, especially with the new telegraph networks.|$|E
25|$|Continuous operation: all metal salts are in {{the vapor}} phase, the arc has {{attained}} its stable shape, and the luminous efficacy has attained its nominal value. The ballast now supplies stable electrical power so the arc will not flicker. Stable <b>operating</b> <b>voltage</b> is 85 volts AC in D1 and D2 systems, 42 volts AC in D3 and D4 systems. The frequency of the square-wave alternating current is typically 400 hertz or higher.|$|E
25|$|Funafuti's {{power station}} {{comprises}} three 750kVA diesel generators with 11kV <b>operating</b> <b>voltage,</b> which {{was installed in}} 2007. Total power output is 1,800kW. The old generators have remained offline (1920kW) but are available as back-up to the main system. The cost of diesel is subsidised by approximately 40% of the annual fuel consumption through the Japan Non Project Grant Assistance (NPGA), although this subsidy may end, which will expose {{the true cost of}} diesel generation of electricity.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to study the effect of plasma actuators in attenuating low-speed flow-induced cavity tones from a control point of view by employing techniques from classical control. A modification of the existing physics-based linear model produced a new variable structure model in which a plasma actuator {{was regarded as a}} linear gain. The parameters of the overall model working at two <b>operating</b> <b>voltages</b> were identified using experimental data. The effects of the plasma actuator control at other various <b>operating</b> <b>voltages</b> were thus able to be predicted using linear interpolation. The good agreement between the predicted and the measured data supported the proposed variable structure model, inside of which plasma actuators affected the damping of cavity pressure oscillations proportionally to the applied voltage to reduce flow-induced tonal noise. With the proposed variable structure model the system stability controlled by plasma actuators at various <b>operating</b> <b>voltages</b> was ensured, thus a closed-loop control method could be applied without leading to instability. A simple proportional integral derivative controller was implemented. Results show the potential of a closed-loop method by increasing system power efficiency...|$|R
50|$|Hot-stick working {{appeared}} in the second decade of the 20th century, when insulating poles made from baked wood were used for tasks such as replacing fuses, replacing post insulators, and transferring lines onto temporary supports. The sticks enabled the linemen {{to carry out the}} work without infringing on the minimum clearance distances from live equipment. As experience with the techniques developed, then the <b>operating</b> <b>voltages</b> at which the work was performed increased. With the advent of fibreglass poles in the late 1950s, which neither split nor soaked up rainwater, utilities were prepared to carry out hot-stick working to their highest <b>operating</b> <b>voltages,</b> perhaps 765 kV.|$|R

25|$|Occasionally, this ballast {{resistor}} would fail and the classic symptom of this failure {{was that the}} engine ran while being cranked (while the resistor was bypassed) but stalled immediately when cranking ceased (and the resistor was reconnected in the circuit via the ignition switch). Modern electronic ignition systems (those used since the 1980s or late '70s) do not require a {{ballast resistor}} as they are flexible enough to operate on the lower cranking voltage or the normal <b>operating</b> <b>voltage.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{capacitance}} {{of certain}} capacitors decreases as the component ages. In ceramic capacitors, this {{is caused by}} degradation of the dielectric. The type of dielectric, ambient operating and storage temperatures are the most significant aging factors, while the <b>operating</b> <b>voltage</b> has a smaller effect. The aging process may be reversed by heating the component above the Curie point. Aging is fastest {{near the beginning of}} life of the component, and the device stabilizes over time. Electrolytic capacitors age as the electrolyte evaporates. In contrast with ceramic capacitors, this occurs towards the end of life of the component.|$|E
25|$|This {{means that}} a 5% {{reduction}} in <b>operating</b> <b>voltage</b> will {{more than double the}} life of the bulb, at the expense of reducing its light output by about 16%. This may be a very acceptable trade off for a light bulb that is in a difficult-to-access location (for example, traffic lights or fixtures hung from high ceilings). Long-life bulbs take advantage of this trade-off. Since the value of the electric power they consume is much more than the value of the lamp, general service lamps emphasize efficiency over long operating life. The objective is to minimize the cost of light, not the cost of lamps. Early bulbs had a life of up to 2500 hours, but in 1924 a cartel agreed to limit life to 1000 hours. When this was exposed in 1953, General Electric and other leading American manufacturers were banned from limiting the life.|$|E

25|$|In many cases, a dimmer can be {{replaced}} by a constant power module (CPM), which is typically a 20- or 50-ampere breaker in a dimming module casing. CPMs are used to supply line voltage to non-dimming electrical devices such as smoke machines, chain winches, and scenic motors that require constant <b>operating</b> <b>voltage.</b> When a device is powered by a CPM, it is fully energized whenever the CPM is turned on, independent of lighting console levels. CPMs must be used (in lieu of dimmers) to power non-dimming devices that require specific line voltages (e.g., in the US, 110 V, 60Hz power) in order to avoid damage to such devices. Dimmers are seldom used to control non-dimming devices because even if a dimmer channel is trusted to always operate at full power, it may not be controlled when communications are disrupted by start up and shut down of the lighting control surface, noise interference, or DMX disconnects or failure. Such a loss of control might cause a dimmer to dim a circuit and thus potentially damage its non-dimming device.|$|E
500|$|A {{significant}} revamping {{and expansion}} of generating capacity {{was carried out in}} 1915. Additional turbines and generators were added, blurring the distinction between the buildings.

40|$|Acid {{oxidised}} multiwall carbon nanotubes (COOH-MWCNT) {{have been}} introduced as a hole injection buffer layer in an {{organic light emitting diodes}} (OLED). We show that the OLED with COOH-MWCNT as a buffer layer provides higher brightness with lower <b>operating</b> <b>voltages.</b> The addition of a COOH-MWCNT buffer layer has enabled a further increase in the brightness of our OLED devices operating in excess of 20, 000 cd/m(2) due to enhanced hole injection by several orders of magnitude.
