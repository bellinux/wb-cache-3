By examining {{a range of issues}} associated with identity politics and alternative lifestyles, the author challenges those who treat new social movements as instances of wider social change while often ignoring their more `local' and `dispersed' importance. This book questions what it means to adopt an identity that is organised around issues of expressivism - and <b>offers</b> <b>a</b> series of <b>non-reductionist</b> ways of looking at identity politics.

40|$|Background: Psychiatry and ‘philosophy of mind’ {{are both}} {{concerned}} with {{the study of the}} relationship between body/brain (‘physical’ domain) and mind (‘mental’ domain), but often there is little interaction between both disciplines. In contemporary psychiatry, neurobiological research predominates, and it is often assumed that the results of this type of research are only compatible with reductionist physicalist positions in the ‘philosophy of mind’, rendering further philosophical reflection obsolete. Aim: To demonstrate the continuing relevance of the ‘philosophy of mind’ for the self-image of modern psychiatry as a clinical and scientific discipline. method We illustrate this view by investigating whether <b>a</b> <b>non-reductionist</b> physicalist position, which postulates that the ‘mental’ supervenes on the ‘physical’ without being reducible to it, is compatible with the results of research on alterations in the brain during psychotherapy. results <b>A</b> <b>non-reductionist</b> physicalist position is compatible with recent functional brain imaging research, since the latter shows that psychiatric disorders (disorders of the ‘mind’) are associated with functional neurophysiological changes (alterations in the brain) that are influenced in different ways by pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. Conclusion: Modern neurobiological research in psychiatry is not only compatible with reductionist physicalist positions in the ‘philosophy of mind’, as is often assumed, but also with <b>a</b> <b>non-reductionist</b> physicalist position in which the ‘mental’ is granted greater autonomy vis-à-vis the physical. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Multidisciplinary {{contemporary}} discourse involving science, {{philosophy and}} theology has explored themes {{of creation and}} human identity. Contemporary critiques of anthropocentricism stem from such discourse. The understanding of human beings as ‘spirited bodies’ rather than embodied spirits, arises from <b>a</b> <b>non-reductionist</b> physicalist standpoint. This {{is the point of}} departure for this thesis. The study attempts to explore the understanding of human beings as ‘spirited bodies’ from <b>a</b> <b>non-reductionist</b> physicalist view and as a metaphor for ‘fresh’ perspectives and insights that could potentially inform and/or shape a theologically grounded earth-keeping ethos on a different premise from the traditional dualistic hierarchical viewpoint. Methodologically, this study attempts to reflect a unitary approach to knowledge. The study views the subject through three prisms. Firstly it takes a retrospective look to account for perspectives that have shaped hierarchical views of creation based on a dualistic principle that in turn have shaped the human power-dominion relationship with the rest of creation that is deemed to have led to the devastating eco-crisis the world faces today. Secondly, it considers <b>a</b> <b>non-reductionist</b> physicalist viewpoint that has challenged dualistic anthropological views of being in favour of the conception of human beings as ‘spirited bodies’ and which places human beings in a continuum with the rest creation. Thirdly, it picks up on Moltmann’s Trinitarian and pneumatological views of creation which orient the theological framework anchored on the community and communion within the triune relationship. Human solidarity with the rest of creation is then posited as the nexus that converges the strands of these different perspectives. The juxtaposition of the Genesis 1 creation story with Zambian cosmogony constitutes ‘case studies’ that illustrate how the fresh perspectives on creation and human identity open up an ‘interpretive space’ that could locate human beings in a continuum with the rest of creation and <b>offer</b> insight for <b>an</b> alternative earth-keeping ethos. Human solidarity with the rest of creation thus critiques traditional western dualistic and hierarchical conceptions of creation on one hand, and serves as an orienting concept for the ‘fresh’ earth-keeping ethos this study proposes on the other.

In this article I present this indebtedness, contextualize it within a wider scope of Flusser’s oeuvre, and argue that the notion of information - borrowed from the hard sciences - does not provide firm grounds for his existentialism or his philosophy of communication. On the contrary, information (understood by Flusser in a twofold and contradictory way as entropy and negentropy) introduces foundational ambivalence and ambiguity to his philosophical project.

Wittgenstein treats both concepts in a very specific manner, different from the traditional approach of philosophy. He also criticized philosophical attempts to attribute special characteristics to human intellectual abilities which would separate them from natural processes. A particular 'spiritual' status of epistemic and other rational powers disappears {{when there is an}} insight into their dependence on discursive practices and specific forms of life on which these powers are based. Concepts such as certainty, knowledge, or explanations do not rest on a rational foundation, that is, they do not refer to processes with particular un-natural properties.

40|$|Supervenience physicalism {{attempts}} to combine non-reductionism about properties with a physical determination thesis {{in such a}} way as to ensure physicalism. I argue that this attempt is unsuccessful: the specific supervenience relation in question is either strong enough to ensure reductionism, as in the case of strong supervenience, or too weak to yield physical determination, as in the case of global supervenience. The argument develops in three stages. First, I propose a distinction between two types of reductionism, definitional and scientific, a distinction thanks to which we can reply to a standard objection against the ontological reductionism of strong supervenience. Second, I claim that because of “the problem of random distribution,” global supervenience needs strengthening to be an adequate relation to capture our physicalistic intuitions; and I show, in accordance with Stalnaker’s relevant proof, why a natural strengthening of global supervenience renders it equivalent to strong supervenience.

Engaging complexity. Verbum et Ecclesia, 35 (1) : doi. org/ 10. 4102 / ve. v 35 i 1. 1316 In this article, I discuss studies in complexity and its epistemological implications for systematic and practical theology. I argue that engagement with complexity does not necessarily assure <b>a</b> <b>non-reductionist</b> approach. However, if complexity is engaged transversally, it becomes possible to transcend reductionist approaches. Moreover, systematic and practical theologians can draw on complexity in developing new ways of understanding and, therefore, new ways of describing the focus, epistemic scope and heuristic structures of systematic and practical theology. Firstly, Edgar Morin draws a distinction between restricted and general complexity based on the epistemology drawn upon in studies in complexity. Moving away from foundationalist approaches to epistemology, Morin argues for a paradigm of systems. Secondly, I discuss Kees van Kooten Niekerk’s distinction between epistemology, methodology and ontology in studies in complexity and <b>offer</b> <b>an</b> example of a theological argument that draws on complexity. Thirdly, I argue for the importance of transversality in engaging complexity by drawing on the work of Wentzel van Huyssteen and Paul Cilliers. In conclusion, I argue that theologians have to be conscious of the epistemic foundations of each study in complexity, and these studies illuminate the heart of Reformed theology. Intradisciplinary and/or interdisciplinary implications: Therefore, this article has both intradisciplinary and interdisciplinary implications. When theologians engage studies in complexity, the epistemological roots of these studies need to be considered seeing that researchers in complexity draw on different epistemologies. Drawing on transversality would enhance such considerations. Furthermore, Edgar Morin’s and Paul Cilliers’ approach to complexity will inform practical and theoretical considerations in church polity and unity. Publishers' versio...|$|R
40|$|Is the sense-data theory, {{otherwise}} known as indirect realism, a form of representationalism? This question has been underexplored in the extant literature, {{and to the extent}} that there is discussion, contemporary authors disagree. There are many different variants of representationalism, and differences between these variants that some people have taken to be inconsequential turn out to be key factors in whether the sense-data theory is a form of representationalism. Chief among these are whether a representationalist takes the phenomenal character of an experience to be explicable in virtue of the properties of an experience that represent something or explicable in virtue of that which gets represented. Another is whether representationalists hold <b>a</b> <b>non-reductionist,</b> or naturalistically or non-naturalistically reductionist variant of representationalism. In addition, subtle differences in what one takes phenomenal character to be on the sense-data theory – either awareness of sense-data or the sense-data themselves – together with one's account of representation, are crucial factors in determining whether sense-data theory is compatible with representationalism.

40|$|Kelsen’s {{two basic}} ideas on legal interpertation are, {{on the one}} hand, its {{characterisation}} as a hybrid with both cognitive and volitive elements, due to the partial indetermination of law; and, on the other hand, the relationship between legal interpretation and the structural properties {{of the legal system}} (dynamic principle). Kelsen’s {{solution to the problem of}} irregular norms –the so-called “tacit alternative clause”– not only raises the accusation of decisionism, but also seems to displace the question of norm content and, therefore, legal interpretation to an irrelevant place within his theory of law. I will argue that a less irracionalist reconstruction of Kelsen’s thesis is possible starting from his initial intuition on legal interpretation.
