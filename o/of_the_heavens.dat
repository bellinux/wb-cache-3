5|$|The Chronologia {{developed}} into an even wider project, the Cosmographia, {{a description of}} the whole Universe. Mercator's outline was (1) the creation of the world; (2) the description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heavens</b> (astronomy and astrology); (3) the description of the earth comprising modern geography, the geography of Ptolemy and the geography of the ancients; (4) genealogy and history of the states; and (5) chronology. Of these the chronology had already been accomplished, the account of the creation and the modern maps would appear in the atlas of 1595, his edition of Ptolemy appeared in 1578 but the ancient geography and the description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heavens</b> never appeared.|$|E

5|$|The protagonist's {{mission is}} made clear when {{they realize that}} a sacred vessel called the Ark <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Heavens</b> {{is the only thing}} that can {{penetrate}} Nelgel's defenses. The protagonist then travels 500 years into the past, where the Ark <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Heavens</b> was last used in recorded history. After fighting Razban, a demon bent on bringing Nelgel to life, the protagonist forges a friendship with a young boy who knew the secret to using the Ark <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Heavens.</b> Returning to the present, the protagonist entered Nelgel's lair, and after a long battle, emerged successful. During the end credits, the protagonist is greeted by the sage from before, who informs them that despite Nelgel's defeat, the seal he had on the central continent was still active.|$|E
5|$|The {{emergence}} of a woman writing {{in the press and}} composing poetry in this dark era was a significant event. Our recent history shows that it was rare for even men to read and write; her appearance in these dark nights was thus like a bright star in the center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heavens.</b>|$|E
5|$|The uranography of Andromeda has {{its roots}} most firmly in the Greek tradition, though a female figure in Andromeda's {{location}} had appeared earlier in Babylonian astronomy. The stars that make up Pisces and the middle portion of modern Andromeda formed a constellation representing a fertility goddess, sometimes named as Anunitum or the Lady <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Heavens.</b>|$|E

5|$|There is {{evidence}} that Emanuel Swedenborg first proposed parts of the nebular hypothesis in 1734. Immanuel Kant, familiar with Swedenborg's work, developed the theory further in 1755, publishing his own Universal Natural History and Theory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Heavens,</b> wherein he argued that gaseous clouds (nebulae) slowly rotate, gradually collapse and flatten due to gravity, eventually forming stars and planets.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{publication}} of Mysterium and {{with the blessing of}} the Graz school inspectors, Kepler began an ambitious program to extend and elaborate his work. He planned four additional books: one on the stationary aspects of the universe (the Sun and the fixed stars); one on the planets and their motions; one on the physical nature of planets and the formation of geographical features (focused especially on Earth); and one on the effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heavens</b> on the Earth, to include atmospheric optics, meteorology, and astrology.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the {{apparent}} immutability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heavens,</b> Chinese astronomers were aware that new stars could appear. In 185 AD, {{they were the first}} to observe and write about a supernova, now known as the SN 185. The brightest stellar event in recorded history was the SN 1006 supernova, which was observed in 1006 and written about by the Egyptian astronomer Ali ibn Ridwan and several Chinese astronomers. The SN 1054 supernova, which gave birth to the Crab Nebula, was also observed by Chinese and Islamic astronomers.|$|E

5|$|The use of polyhedra {{to model}} heavenly bodies {{can be traced}} back to Plato, who in the Timaeus {{identified}} the regular dodecahedron with the shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heavens</b> and its twelve faces with the constellations of the zodiac. Later, Johannes Kepler theorized that the distribution of distances of the planets from the sun could be explained by the shapes of the five Platonic solids, nested within each other. Escher kept a model of this system of nested polyhedra, and regularly depicted polyhedra in his artworks relating to astronomy and other worlds.|$|E
5|$|Tycho {{and others}} had {{observed}} the supernova of 1572. Ottavio Brenzoni's letter of 15 January 1605 to Galileo brought the 1572 supernova and the less bright nova of 1601 to Galileo's notice. Galileo observed and discussed Kepler's supernova in 1604. Since these new stars displayed no detectable diurnal parallax, Galileo concluded that they were distant stars, and, therefore, disproved the Aristotelian belief in the immutability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heavens.</b>|$|E
5|$|When {{presenting}} his clocktower {{design to}} the Emperor Zhezong, Su Song equated the constant {{flow of water}} with the continuous movements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heavens,</b> the latter of which symbolized the unceasing power of the emperor. This appealed to emperor, who featured artwork representing the clocktower on vehicles of major imperial processions, as illustrated in the Illustration of the Imperial Grand Carriage Procession of 1053.|$|E

5|$|David Scott's (1806–49) {{most ambitious}} {{historical}} work was the triptych Sir William Wallace, Scottish Wars: the Spear and English War: the Bow (1843). He also produced etchings for versions of Coleridge's Ancient Mariner, Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress and J. P. Nichol's Architecture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Heavens</b> (1850). Because of this early death {{he was known}} to, and admired by, the Pre-Raphaelite brotherhood mainly through his brother William Bell Scott (1811–90), who became {{a close friend of}} founding member D. G. Rossetti. The London-based Pre-Raphaelites rejected the formalism of Mannerist painting after Raphael. Bell Scott was patronised by the Pre-Raphaelite collector James Leathart. His most famous work, Iron and Coal {{was one of the most}} popular Victorian images and one of the few to fulfill the Pre-Raphaelite ambition to depict the modern world.|$|E
5|$|In October 1604, {{a bright}} new evening star (SN 1604) appeared, but Kepler {{did not believe}} the rumors until he saw it himself. Kepler began {{systematically}} observing the nova. Astrologically, the end of 1603 marked the beginning of a fiery trigon, the start of the about 800-year cycle of great conjunctions; astrologers associated the two previous such periods with the rise of Charlemagne (c. 800 years earlier) and the birth of Christ (c. 1600 years earlier), and thus expected events of great portent, especially regarding the emperor. It was in this context, as the imperial mathematician and astrologer to the emperor, that Kepler described the new star two years later in his De Stella Nova. In it, Kepler addressed the star's astronomical properties while taking a skeptical approach to the many astrological interpretations then circulating. He noted its fading luminosity, speculated about its origin, and used the lack of observed parallax to argue that it was in the sphere of fixed stars, further undermining the doctrine of the immutability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heavens</b> (the idea accepted since Aristotle that the celestial spheres were perfect and unchanging). The birth of a new star implied the variability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heavens.</b> In an appendix, Kepler also discussed the recent chronology work of the Polish historian Laurentius Suslyga; he calculated that, if Suslyga was correct that accepted timelines were four years behind, then the Star of Bethlehem—analogous to the present new star—would have coincided with the first great conjunction of the earlier 800-year cycle.|$|E
5|$|The {{importance}} of observing cosmological factors is also {{seen on the}} other side of the world. The Forbidden City in Beijing is laid out to follow cosmic order though rather than observing four directions. The Chinese system was composed of five directions: North, South, East, West and Centre. The Forbidden City occupied the centre of ancient Beijing. One approaches the Emperor from the south, thus placing him in front of the circumpolar stars. This creates the situation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heavens</b> revolving around the person of the Emperor. The Chinese cosmology is now better known through its export as feng shui.|$|E
