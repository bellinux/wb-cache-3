40|$|Taking {{into account}} {{that it is in}} the nature of the modern corporat ion that risks are {{distributed}} over several agents, we discuss in this paper the organisational behaviour as it results from such dispersal <b>of</b> <b>responsibilities</b> for both the principal and the agent. We explore the hypothesis that dispersal <b>of</b> <b>responsibilities</b> could be the result or a cause of a lack of consensus between the principal and the agent. Our findings suggest that a dispersal <b>of</b> <b>responsibilities</b> has a negative impact on the principal-agent relationship and that it represents a foundation for theoretical and empirical approaches to organisational behaviour. We find that agent perceptions of a dispersal <b>of</b> <b>responsibilities</b> are linked to his/her resistance to the principal 2 ̆ 019 s interests, but this relationship is deeper than was suggested by previous research. However, if the sharing <b>of</b> <b>responsibilities</b> does not run parallel to that, we may have as a result what we call an agency problem...|$|R
