50|$|Large {{amounts of}} carbon are {{exchanged}} each year between {{the ocean and}} the atmosphere. A major controlling factor in oceanic-atmospheric carbon exchange is thermohaline circulation. In regions of ocean upwelling, carbon rich water from the deep ocean comes {{to the surface and}} releases carbon into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. Large amounts of carbon dioxide are dissolved in cold water in higher latitudes. This water sinks down and brings the carbon into the deeper ocean levels, where it can stay for anywhere between decades and several centuries. Ocean circulation events cause this process to be variable. For example, during El Nino events there is less deep ocean upwelling, leading to lower <b>outgasing</b> of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.|$|E

We present a detailed {{experimental study of}} these phenomena in the system CBr 4 -C 2 Cl 6 directionally solidified in thin films. As is usual {{in this type of}} experiments, we use zone-refined and <b>outgased</b> products, but do not fill and seal the samples under vacuum. We study the solute-redistribution transient (initial recoil of the growth front) in samples of as-refined CBr 4, in the absence of bubbles. This in situ method allows us to detect all the impurities present in our samples and to estimate their concentrations and partition coefficients. We point out several artefacts that may be caused by the dissolved residual impurities (shift of the cellular threshold velocity, modifications of the morphology of the cellular front). We then describe in detail the nucleation-growth process of gas bubbles during the course of solidification. There exists a steady growth pattern consisting of a periodic array of tubular bubbles similar to the rod-like pattern of eutectics and monotectics. We study the morphology of this state {{as a function of the}} growth velocity. We show that, at high velocity, the pattern decomposes in a series of independent local two-phased structures, the solid-vapour (SV) fingers, of width a few diffusion lengths.

The {{behavior of a}} fine wire placed axially in a cylindrical anode is investigated. A brief account is given of the more recent literature dealing with the subject. A quartz tube which has been found particularly suitable and convenient is described. As {{it is not possible}} to outgas the ends of the filament and the supports, these parts have been shielded from the field. The usual source of high potential consisting of transformer, rectifier and condensers is used. A description is given of a method for measuring potentials from a few volts up to 25, 000 volts. Use is made of a galvanometer and series resistance, and it is thought that the range can be extended to at least 100, 000 volts. With heat treated wires results are obtained in good agreement with earlier work, but it is shown that with such wires an appreciable current is obtained only after a break has occurred in the surface of the wire. The resulting characteristic depends only on the power available during the break and is shown to obey the empirical equation: [ [...] . ]. Microtographs are presented which makes it plausible that the potential gradient may exceed 40 million volts/cm without producing currents in excess of [ [...] . ] amperes and that the gradient is probably [ [...] . ] volts/cm or more when reasonably large currents are obtained. With untreated wires a "loop phenomenon" is described which is thought to be due to positive ions from the anode. Heating the tube in an electric furnace is shown to have a great influence on the emission in this case. Microphotographs show that the diameter of such a wire decreases with use. With thoroughly <b>outgased</b> wires the emission is not changed when the tube is submerged in liquid air, and the heating of the filament up to 1400 [degrees]K increases the emission only a few percent. ...|$|R

40|$|A three {{dimensional}} {{hydrodynamic model}} with a coupled carbonate speciation sub-model is used to simulate large additions of CO 2 into the North Sea, representing leakages at potential carbon sequestration sites. A range of leakage scenarios are conducted at two distinct release sites, allowing {{an analysis of the}} seasonal, inter-annual and spatial variability of impacts to the marine ecosystem. Seasonally stratified regions are shown to be more vulnerable to CO 2 release during the summer as the added CO 2 remains trapped beneath the thermocline, preventing <b>outgasing</b> to the atmosphere. On average, CO 2 injected into the northern North Sea is shown to reside within the water column twice as long as an equivalent addition in the southern North Sea before reaching the atmosphere. Short-term leakages of 5000 tonnes CO 2 over a single day result in substantial acidification at the release sites (up to - 1. 92 pH units), with significant perturbations (greater than 0. 1 pH units) generally confined to a 10 km radius. Long-term CO 2 leakages sustained for a year may result in extensive plumes of acidified seawater, carried by major advective pathways. Whilst such scenarios could be harmful to marine biota over confined spatial scales, continued unmitigated CO 2 emissions from fossil fuels are predicted to result in greater and more long-lived perturbations to the carbonate system over the next few decades...|$|E
40|$|Oxide {{coatings}} {{deposition in}} reactive process from metallic targets has particular importance thanks to cheapness of metallic target {{in comparison with}} conductive ceramic targets. Silicon oxide can be deposited only from a metallic target or from dielectric target by RF-sputtering, but deposition speed in case of RF-sputtering is low. Reactive sputtering of metallic targets is characterized by voltage hysteresis and has a characteristic appearance depending on type of metal and value of secondary electronic emission factor for metal and oxide. From voltage-current (VC) characteristics follows, that for silicon oxide (SiO 2) deposition {{it is necessary to}} work in power supply constant voltage mode and for titanium oxide (TiO 2) deposition - at constant current mode and at constant oxygen flow. For process stabilization it is necessary to stabilize the second electric parameter by changing oxygen flow in the chamber. We develop an algorithm and a control system of process for this case. As a result in process there is only one variable value of process which can be controlled, this is oxygen flow, at a constant pumping speed, leakage, etc. In this case process will be stabilized. Changes of <b>outgasing</b> flow during process as a result of heating of design elements of a chamber will be considered also.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a series of}} numerical modelling studies into hydrodynamic transport and larval dispersal. The initial investigation seeks to evaluate retention timescales in Liverpool Bay. The flushing time and residence time are equal to 136 days and 103 days respectively, however small concentrations of seawater are retained over several years due to vigorous tidal mixing. The age distribution is shown to be highly variable and dependent upon tracer input duration, however salinity {{can be used to}} estimate the mean age, which is not directly observable in practice. Chapters 3, 4 and 5 all focus upon the dispersal of meroplanktonic larvae and aim to determine how larval behaviour affects their transport. Vertical migration is a significant influence upon larval dispersal within each case study, although the effect of this behaviour is conditional upon local hydrodynamic conditions. For example diel vertical migration promotes dispersal in the western Irish Sea, however the identical swimming pattern facilitates local retention in the eastern Irish Sea. The ecological implications of these findings are discussed. This thesis concludes with an investigation into the impact of large CO 2 leakages on the marine carbonate system at potential carbon sequestration sites in the North Sea. Perturbations to seawater pH are found to vary according to the rate, duration and location of CO 2 input. The northern North Sea is particularly vulnerable to large perturbations (> 1 pH units) during the summer months, as the strong seasonal thermocline suppresses CO 2 <b>outgasing...</b>|$|E
40|$|The Na {{atmosphere}} of Io requires a Na-S-O {{phase in the}} outer surface layers. Considering the various mechanisms for extraction of Na to the surface, the possible primary phases are Na_ 2 O, Na_ 2 S_x and Na_ 2 SO_ 4. However, regardless of the primary phases brought to the surface, the shallow crustal recycling of material implied by the ongoing volcanism will tend to produce thermochemical equilibrium and cause all Na to end up as Na_ 2 SO_ 4 or Na_ 2 S_x. This hypothesis is investigated by relatively model-independent thermodynamic calculations. The major assumption is that material is statistically circulated to sufficiently high temperatures by burial that thermochemical equilibrium can be attained. For {{a wide range of}} assumed crustal (PT) conditions, Na_ 2 O will be converted to Na_ 2 SO_ 4. During residence in the shallowest crustal regions dominated by liquid SO_ 2, e. g., SO_ 2 geysers or fumaroles, or for any crustal regimes where SO_ 2 and S are in comparable abundances, Na-sulfides will be converted to Na_ 2 SO_ 4. However, in high-temperature, low-pressure regimes with a low relative abundance of SO_ 2 relative to S (e. g., due to <b>outgasing</b> of SO_ 2), Na_ 2 SO_ 4 is converted to Na sulfides. Such regimes could be relatively common on Io, e. g., associated with flows, lava lakes, or shallow intrusions. Consequently, because of thermochemical equilibration in different crustal environments, both Na_ 2 SO_ 4 and Na sulfides will coexist on the Io surface...|$|E

Multiplied {{with an average age}} of 165 million years of the sediments the total amount of in-situ produced helium can be calculated.

40|$|Trends and {{variability}} in the ocean-atmosphere CO 2 flux and the uptake of anthropogenic CO 2 are simulated for the period 1948 – 2003, using a biogeochemical carbon cycle model (HAMOCC 5) coupled online to a global ocean general circulation model (MPI-OM). The model is forced by daily National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) reanalysis data from 1948 to 2003. We find a global interannual variability of ± 0. 50 PgC yr− 1 (2 σ) which is largely dominated by ocean dynamics in the equatorial Pacific. On decadal scale, two patterns are of global importance. First, the regime shift that occurs in 1975 – 1977 when the modeled interannual variability of the equatorial Pacific changes from ± 0. 32 PgC yr− 1 to ± 0. 23 PgC yr− 1 and the mean <b>outgasing</b> of CO 2 decreases from 0. 70 PgC yr− 1 to 0. 58 PgC yr− 1. Second, the trend that occurs in the Southern Ocean, where we find an increase of the CO 2 fluxes over the full 56 -year simulation period. The flux results from stronger upwelling and deeper mixed layers which are caused by increasing wind velocities. We estimate an average CO 2 flux into the ocean of 1. 49 PgC yr− 1 for 1980 – 1989 and 1. 74 PgC yr− 1 for 1990 – 1999, with extremes of 1. 20 PgC yr− 1 at the La Niña event in 1996 and 2. 10 PgC yr− 1 during the El Niño events in 1993 and 1998.

40|$|International audienceTen {{years after}} the {{successful}} landing of the HUYGENS probe {{on the surface of}} Titan, we reassess the complex permittivity measurements of the surface materials performed by the PWA-HASI experiment (Permittivity, Waves and Altimetry - Huygens Atmospheric Structure Instrument). The complex permittivity is inferred from the mutual impedance of a classical quadrupolar probe, ie. the ratio of the voltage measured by a receiving dipole over the current emitted by another dipole. Using a simple model of the quadrupole configuration, the dielectric constant of the material at the landing site was first estimated to be of the order of 1. 8. A more realistic numerical model that took into account the influence of the HUYGENS gondola yielded a dielectric constant in the range 2 - 3 and a conductivity in the range 0. 4 - 0. 8 nS/m. due to uncertainties about the system geometry (Grard et al., 2006). However, a puzzling experimental fact remains to be explained, namely a sudden variation of the amplitude and phase of the received voltage 11 mn after landing that cannot be associated with any lander mechanical disturbance. Permittivity estimations were based on the first 11 mn sequence. The present analysis takes advantage of a recent analysis of the landing process that provided more realistic final position and attitude for the HUYGENS lander (Schroder et al., 2012). The new results lie within former estimated ranges and attention is paid to their sensitivity to geometry and to the reference measurements collected immediately before landing. This point is particularly critical for the estimation of the conductivity. The complete data set has been analysed, including the sequence collected after the first 11 mn. We consider various scenarios that may explain the observed phase and amplitude discontinuity. We tested two layers ground models in order to investigate the possibility that the upper layer may have experienced a fast physical change due to deliquescence or <b>outgasing.</b> Unfortunately a rigid quadrupolar array measure the average electric properties of the ground and cannot detect any inhomogeneity.

40|$|Carbon, nitrogen, {{oxygen and}} sulfide budgets are derived for the Black Sea water column from a coupled physical-biogeochemical model. The model is {{applied in the}} deep {{part of the sea}} and simulates {{processes}} over the whole water column including the anoxic layer that extends from ~ 115 m to the bottom (~ 2000 m). The biogeochemical model involves a refined representation of the Black Sea foodweb from bacteria to gelatinous carnivores. It includes notably a series of biogeochemical processes typical for oxygen deficient conditions with, for instance, bacterial respiration using different types of oxidants (i. e denitrification, sulfate reduction), the lower efficiency of detritus degradation, the ANAMMOX (ANaerobic AMMonium OXidation) process and the occurrence of particular redox reactions. The model has been calibrated and validated against all available data gathered in the Black Sea TU Ocean Base and this exercise is described in Gregoire et al., (2008). In the present paper, we focus on the biogeochemical flows produced by the model and we compare model estimations with the measurements performed during the R. V. KNORR expedition conducted in the Black Sea from April to July 1988 (Murray and the Black Sea Knorr Expedition, 1991). Model estimations of hydrogen sulfide oxidation, metal sulfide precipitation, hydrogen sulfide formation in the sediments and water column, export flux to the anoxic layer and to the sediments, denitrification, primary and bacterial production are in the range of field observations. With a simulated Gross Primary Production (GPP) of 7. 9 molC m- 2 yr- 1 and a Community Respiration (CR) of 6. 3 molC m- 2 yr- 1, the system is net autotrophic with a Net Community Production (NCP) of 1. 6 molC m- 2 yr- 1. This NCP corresponds to 20 % of the GPP and is exported to the anoxic layer. In order to model Particulate Organic Matter (POM) fluxes to the bottom and hydrogen sulfide profiles in agreement with in-situ observations, we have to consider that the degradation of POM in anoxic conditions is less efficient that in oxygenated waters as it has often been observed (see discussion in Hedges et al., 1999). The vertical POM profile produced by the model can be fitted to the classic power function describing the oceanic carbon rate (CR=Z-) using an attenuation coefficient  of 0. 36 which is the value proposed for another anoxic environment (i. e. the Mexico Margin) by Devol and Hartnett, (2001). Due to the lower efficiency of detritus degradation in anoxic conditions and to the aggregation of particles that enhanced the sinking, {{an important part of the}} export to the anoxic layer (i. e. 33 %, 0. 52 molC m- 2 yr- 1) escapes remineralization in the water column and reaches the sediments. Therefore, sediments are active sites of sulfide production contributing to 26 % of the total sulfide production. In the upper layer, the oxygen dynamics is mainly governed by photosynthesis and respiration processes as well as by air-sea exchanges. ~ 71 % of the oxygen produced by phytoplankton (photosynthesis + nitrate reduction) is lost through respiration, ~ 21 % by <b>outgasing</b> to the atmosphere, ~ 5 % through nitrification and only ~ 2 % in the oxidation of reduced components (e. g. Mn 2 +, Fe 2 +, H 2 S). The model estimates the amount of nitrogen lost through denitrification 	at 307 mmolN m- 2 yr- 1 that can be partitioned into a loss of ~ 55 % through the use of nitrate for the oxidation of detritus in low oxygen conditions, ~ 40 % in the ANAMMOX process and the remaining ~ 5 % in the oxidation of reduced substances by nitrate. In agreement with data analysis performed on long time series collected since the 1960 's (Konovalov and Murray, 2001), the sulfide and nitrogen budgets established for the anoxic layer are not balanced in response to the enhanced particle fluxes induced by eutrophication: the NH 4 and H 2 S concentrations increase.

40|$|The {{first part}} of this thesis {{describes}} the further development of a dynamic global vegetation model, LPJ, and its application to selected scientific questions. LPJ has been extended to include isotopic fractionation of 13 C at the leaf level during assimilation and includes a full isotopic terrestrial carbon cycle. Hence, it simulates the isotopic signature of the heterotrophic respiration fluxes. The model thus allows a quantitative analysis of the net biosphere exchange of CO 2 and 13 CO 2 with the atmosphere as a function of changes in climate, land cover, atmospheric CO 2, and the isotope ratio of CO 2. The extended version of LPJ has been used to study the response of the global vegetation distribution to an abrupt climate change event (Younger Dryas) and the thereby incurred changes in the terrestrial carbon pools and fluxes and their isotopic 13 C/ 12 ratio. Climate data from a 850 -year-long coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation model (ECHAM 3 /LSG) is used for these simulations. The comparison of the modelled vegetation distribution and shifts during this idealized Younger Dryas event with reconstructed vegetation maps for North America and Europe based on pollen records shows a reasonable agreement. The impact of the terrestrial carbon release during the Younger Dryas on the atmospheric CO 2 and δ 13 C is analyzed using a simplified ocean model and compared to ice core measurements. In the standard case the simulation exhibits a significant change in global total terrestrial carbon stocks of about 180 Pg C leading to an atmospheric CO 2 increase of approx. 28 ppmv {{as a consequence of the}} climate change event. The robustness of the terrestrial signal during the Younger Dryas is studied by several sensitivity experiments concerning the initial values of the carbon pool sizes as well as the CO 2 fertilization effect and the temperature dependency of the carbon decomposition rates. The resulting increase of atmospheric CO 2 concentrations for the cold event varies between 16 to 33 ppmv among the different experiments. The simulated atmospheric δ 13 C values which are about 0. 4 per mil lower during the cold phase reflect major findings from ice core measurements and are fairly robust against the sensitivity experiments. The isotope version of LPJ has also been used to study the effects of climate variability, fire, and changes in land use on the exchange fluxes of CO 2 and 13 CO 2 between the terrestrial biosphere and atmosphere for the last 100 years in greater detail. A transient, spatially explicit dataset of C 4 crops and tropical C 4 pastures has been compiled which, in combination with a land use scheme, allows the analysis of the impact of land use and C 4 cultivation on the terrestrial stable isotope composition. LPJ simulates a global mean isotopic fractionation of 17. 7 per mil at the leaf level with interannual variations of ca. 0. 3 per mil in the case without land use for the years 1950 to 1998. In this case, interannual variability in the net 13 CO 2 flux between atmosphere and terrestrial biosphere is of the order of 15 Pg C per mil yr- 1. It is reduced to 4 Pg C per mil yr- 1 if the leaf-level fractionation factor is held constant at the long term mean. Depending on the chosen land use scheme modelled values of leaf discrimination vary between 17. 9 per mil and 17. 0 per mil with results from the experiment specifying C 4 crops and C 4 pastures being the lowest. Modelled values of isotopic disequilibrium similarly depend on the amount of prescribed C 4 vegetation (crops and pastures) and vary between 37. 9 Pg C per mil yr- 1 and 23. 9 Pg C per mil yr- 1 averaged over the years 1985 to 1995. In addition, the effect of fire on the isotopic disequilibrium has been estimated to lead to a reduction of approx. 10 Pg C per mil yr- 1. The second part of the thesis describes the construction and application of a terrestrial Carbon Cycle Data Assimilation System (CCDAS). In the assimilation step parameters of a terrestrial biosphere model, BETHY, are constrained subject to observations. The technique is demonstrated by using atmospheric CO 2 concentration observations from 1979 to 1999 and satellite remote sensing data (identifying vegetation activity) for the years 1989 and 1990 to optimize the tunable parameters in the model (some spatially explicit, some global) and also give an estimate of their uncertainties. Quantities (global and spatially explicit carbon fluxes) derived from the prognostic step of CCDAS are then analyzed with respect to climate anomalies. Processes responsible for the mean terrestrial fluxes and their variability are identified. A highly significant correlation between El Nino/Southern Oscillation and terrestrial CO 2 fluxes, with CO 2 lagging by a few months was found. Net CO 2 <b>outgasing</b> during El Nino events is caused mainly by a reduction of photosynthesis in large parts of the tropics, notably the Amazon basin and Central Africa. The most important deviation of this pattern is found after the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991...|$|E
