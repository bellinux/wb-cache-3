50|$|On 7 February 2004, 2.5 million <b>oriental</b> <b>pratincoles</b> were {{recorded}} on Eighty Mile Beach in Australia's north-west by the Australasian Wader Studies Group. There {{had previously been}} no record of this magnitude and it is supposed that weather conditions caused much of the world's population of this species to congregate in one area.|$|R
5000|$|The Port Hedland Saltworks Important Bird Area is a 103 km2 {{tract of}} {{originally}} intertidal land, now containing a saltern, about 20 km {{east of the}} port of Port Hedland. The site regularly supports over 1% of the world populations of red-necked stints and sharp-tailed sandpipers, {{as well as a}} population of the range-restricted dusky gerygone. [...] Species that have strongly declined since the 1980s are broad-billed sandpipers, Asian dowitchers, curlew sandpipers, red-necked avocets, banded stilts, <b>Oriental</b> plovers, <b>Oriental</b> <b>pratincoles</b> and white-winged black terns. Other species present include Australian bustards, bush stone-curlews, western bowerbirds, painted finches and canary white-eyes.|$|R
50|$|Very good {{views are}} needed to {{distinguish}} this species from other pratincoles, such as the black-winged pratincole and the <b>oriental</b> <b>pratincole,</b> which may occur in its range. The latter species also has a chestnut underwing, but is shorter-tailed.|$|E
50|$|Very good {{views are}} needed to {{distinguish}} this species from other pratincoles, such as the collared pratincole and the <b>oriental</b> <b>pratincole</b> which may occur in its range. It is marginally larger than the collared pratincole, and is shorter-tailed and longer legged.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>oriental</b> <b>{{pratincole}}</b> (Glareola maldivarum), {{also known}} as the grasshopper-bird or swallow-plover is a wader in the pratincole family, Glareolidae. The genus name is a diminutive of Latin glarea, [...] "gravel", referring to a typical nesting habitat for pratincoles. The species name maldivarum refers to the type locality, the ocean near the Maldive Islands; the type specimen, caught alive at sea, survived for a month on flies.|$|E
5000|$|The {{site has}} been {{identified}} by BirdLife International as an IBA because it regularly supports over 1% of the world populations of red-necked stints and sharp-tailed sandpipers, {{as well as a}} population of the range-restricted dusky gerygone. [...] It previously supported much greater numbers of several more species of waterbirds, especially waders, with counts of up to 66,800 birds present; however, since the expansion of the saltworks in the 1990s numbers have dropped to 5000-10,000. Species that have strongly declined since the 1980s are broad-billed sandpipers, Asian dowitchers, curlew sandpipers, red-necked avocets, banded stilts, <b>Oriental</b> plovers, <b>Oriental</b> <b>pratincoles</b> and white-winged black terns. Other species present include Australian bustards, bush stone-curlews, western bowerbirds, painted finches and canary white-eyes.|$|R
5000|$|Because of its {{importance}} for shorebirds, Eighty Mile Beach {{is classified as}} an Important Bird Area (IBA) {{and is one of}} the principal shorebird study sites in north-western Australia. It regularly supports over 400,000 shorebirds, including over 1% of the global populations of bar-tailed godwits, eastern curlews, great knots, red knots, red-necked stints, grey-tailed tattlers, Terek sandpipers, pied oystercatchers, greater sand plovers, Oriental plovers, red-capped plovers and <b>Oriental</b> <b>pratincoles,</b> with irregular high counts of other species. [...] Since 1981 almost yearly expeditions by the Australasian Wader Studies Group have been banding and counting shorebirds there as part of a long-term program of monitoring the populations using the East Asian - Australasian Flyway. Since 1992 most birds caught have also been leg-flagged in order to discover their precise migration routes and staging sites.|$|R
5000|$|The {{seasonal}} wetlands on {{the floodplain}} regularly support {{large numbers of}} waterbirds. Numerically important duck species include hardhead, grey teal and plumed whistling duck. The lagoons are also an important site for shorebirds: several thousand little curlews and <b>Oriental</b> <b>pratincoles,</b> and hundreds of wood sandpipers have been counted. The Parry Lagoons {{are probably the most}} important site in Australia for both wood and marsh sandpipers. When local rainfall is high the lagoons and other seasonal wetlands are major breeding areas for waterbirds in the Kimberley, with up to 77 species recorded in habitats associated with Parry Creek. The grasslands are the only place in Western Australia where zitting cisticolas occur naturally. [...] The mangroves contain 12 of the 13 species of terrestrial bird restricted to such habitat, or to rainforest, in Western Australia, including the black butcherbird. About 200 bird species have been recorded from the site.|$|R
50|$|A 1240 km2 {{tract of}} land, {{corresponding}} {{to the area of}} the lake when fully inundated, has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it has supported up to 116,000 waterbirds when flooded, including over 1% of the world population of plumed whistling-ducks. It also provides habitat for Australian bustards and yellow-tinted honeyeaters. Bird species recorded in substantial numbers include the Australian pelican, <b>Oriental</b> <b>pratincole</b> and little curlew. The IBA is the only known inland breeding site in the Northern Territory for great egrets.|$|E
40|$|Field {{surveys were}} carried out in 2002 â€“ 2004 to assess the status, {{distribution}} and seasonality of waterbirds and coastal seabirds in Timor-Leste. A total of 3, 653 records of 82 waterbird and coastal seabirds were collected during 446 visits to 74 wetland sites. Ten species new to Timor island were recorded: Green Pygmy-goose Nettapus pulchellus, Hardhead Aythya australis, Ruddy-breasted Crake Porzana fusca, Spotless Crake Porzana tabuensis (first Wallacean record since 1899), Common Coot Fulica atra, Greater Paintedsnipe Rostratula benghalensis, Spotted Redshank Tringa erythropus (second record for Wallacea), Pectoral Sandpiper Calidris melanotos (first record for Wallacea), Common Tern Sterna hirundo and Black-crowned Night Heron Nycticorax nycticorax. Significant populations of three Near Threatened species were recorded: Beach Thick-knee Esacus neglectus, Malaysian Plover Charadrius peronii and Darter Anhinga melanogaster. Three wetlands are highlighted for their importance: (1) Lake Iralalara (c. 1, 500 ha) {{is the most significant}} freshwater site in Timor-Leste and Nusa Tenggara, supporting at least 50 waterbird species including large populations of ducks and rails. It is an important staging site for <b>Oriental</b> <b>Pratincole</b> Glareola maldivarum (c. 3, 000 recorded in November 2004); (2) Tasitolu is a site of high national biodiversity significance with 53 waterbird and coastal seabird species recorded from its saline lakes and mudflats; (3) Kupang Bay in West Timor is the most significant site for migratory waders in Nusa Tenggara. Regular monitoring of key sites and further fieldwork are needed, especially along the south coast (Covalima, Manufahi and Manatuto districts) ...|$|E
50|$|The {{white-eyed river martin}} may be migratory, and if the {{breeding}} habitat resembles that of the African river martin, {{it is likely to}} be the forested valleys of large rivers; these can provide sandbars and islands for nesting, and woodland over which the birds can catch insect prey. The breeding grounds and habitat are unknown, although river valleys in northern Thailand or southwestern China are possibilities. A claimed depiction of this species in a Chinese scroll painting initially appeared to support the possibility of the martin breeding in China. The bird in the painting had a similarly shaped head and bill, a white eye and a long tail, although it lacked the white rump, did not show the correct bill colour, and elongated the outer, rather than central, tail feathers. Painted before 1970, it pre-dated the publication of pictures of the Thai bird, so it must have been painted from life. It is now thought more likely that the scroll shows <b>Oriental</b> <b>pratincoles</b> (Glareola maldivarum). Cambodia and Burma have also been suggested as possible refuges for the martin, but there has also been speculation on whether it is migratory at all.|$|R
