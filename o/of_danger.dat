5|$|The selfish herd {{theory was}} {{proposed}} by W.D. Hamilton {{to explain why}} animals seek central positions in a group. The theory's central idea {{is to reduce the}} individual's domain <b>of</b> <b>danger.</b> A domain <b>of</b> <b>danger</b> is the area within the group in which the individual {{is more likely to be}} attacked by a predator. The center of the group has the lowest domain <b>of</b> <b>danger,</b> so animals will constantly strive to gain this position. Testing Hamilton's selfish herd effect, Alta De Vos and Justin O'Rainn (2010) studied brown fur seal predation from great white sharks. Using decoy seals, the researchers varied the distance between the decoys to produce different domains <b>of</b> <b>danger.</b> The seals with a greater domain <b>of</b> <b>danger</b> had an increased risk of shark attack.|$|E

40|$|In a lapse {{of a few}} decades, deep {{changes have}} {{occurred}} in the treatment <b>of</b> <b>dangers</b> which may affect human communities. Whereas {{since the end of the}} XIXe century there was a continuous progression ofthe treatment <b>of</b> these <b>dangers</b> through their approach as risks, one notes today an erosion of these procedures which, on multiple plans (technical, scientitic, economical, political), made it possible toconsider certain forms of control. All seems indeed lo occur as if the work of domestication <b>of</b> collective <b>dangers</b> undertaken with the generalization of the concept of risk found its limits. The are several reasons explaining this situation. The nature even <b>of</b> <b>dangers</b> significantly changed, making more problematic their approach in the form of risks. But also, and in a bound way, the difficulty in containing new dangers within the framework of risk management led to exploration of other methods <b>of</b> treatment <b>of</b> <b>dangers,</b> in particular by new actors mobilizations around these questions which tend to become major topics in modern societies...|$|R

5|$|Hartebeest {{are remarkably}} alert and {{cautious}} animals with highly developed brains. Generally calm in nature, hartebeest can be ferocious when provoked. While feeding, one individual {{stays on the}} lookout for danger, often standing on a termite mound to see farther. At times <b>of</b> <b>danger,</b> the whole herd flees in a single file after an individual suddenly starts off. Adult hartebeest are preyed upon by lions, leopards, hyenas and wild dogs; cheetahs and jackals target juveniles. Crocodiles may also prey on hartebeest.|$|E
5|$|Mainly a herbivore, its diet is {{primarily}} grasses and leaves. Common elands form herds {{of up to}} 500 animals, but are not territorial. The common eland prefers habitats {{with a wide variety}} of flowering plants such as savannah, woodlands, and open and montane grasslands; it avoids dense forests. It uses loud barks, visual and postural movements and the flehmen response to communicate and warn others <b>of</b> <b>danger.</b> The common eland is used by humans for leather, meat, and rich, nutritious milk, and has been domesticated in many areas.|$|E

Without any hesitation he collected six other ranks and with entire disregard <b>of</b> <b>danger</b> he charged and captured the position.

The state government set up 530storm shelters in schools and other public buildings, prepared to hold 73,000people.

5|$|Billiard balls {{have been}} made from many {{different}} materials {{throughout the history of}} the game, including clay, wood, ivory, plastics (including celluloid, Bakelite, crystalate, and phenolic resin, polyester and acrylic) and even steel. The dominant material from 1627 until the early- to mid-20th century was ivory. The search for a substitute for ivory use was not for environmental concerns but based on economic motivation and fear <b>of</b> <b>danger</b> for elephant hunters. It was in part spurred on by a New York billiard table manufacturer who announced a prize of $10,000 for a substitute material. The first viable substitute was celluloid billiard balls, invented by John Wesley Hyatt in 1868, but the material was volatile and highly inflammable, sometimes exploding during manufacture.|$|E
5|$|Edward's {{coronation}} {{had originally}} been scheduled for 26 June 1902. However, two days before, on 24 June, {{he was diagnosed with}} appendicitis. Appendicitis was generally not treated operatively and carried a high mortality rate, but developments in anaesthesia and antisepsis in the preceding 50 years made life-saving surgery possible. Sir Frederick Treves, with the support of Lord Lister, performed a then-radical operation of draining a pint of pus from the infected abscess through a small incision (through -inch thickness of belly fat and abdomen wall); this outcome showed thankfully that the cause was not cancer. The next day, Edward was sitting up in bed, smoking a cigar. Two weeks later, it was announced that the King was out <b>of</b> <b>danger.</b> Treves was honoured with a baronetcy (which Edward had arranged before the operation) and appendix surgery entered the medical mainstream. Edward was crowned at Westminster Abbey on 9 August 1902 by the 80-year-old Archbishop of Canterbury, Frederick Temple, who died only four months later.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Pulo Aura {{was a minor}} naval {{engagement}} of the Napoleonic Wars, fought on 14 February 1804, in which a large convoy of Honourable East India Company (HEIC) East Indiamen, well-armed merchant ships, intimidated, drove off and chased a powerful French naval squadron. Although the French force was much stronger than the British convoy, Commodore Nathaniel Dance's aggressive tactics persuaded Contre-Admiral Charles-Alexandre Durand Linois to retire after only a brief exchange of shot. Dance then chased the French warships until his convoy was out <b>of</b> <b>danger,</b> whereupon he resumed his passage towards British India. Linois later claimed that the unescorted British merchant fleet was defended by eight ships of the line, a claim criticised by contemporary officers and later historians.|$|E

5|$|The British fleet was {{anchored}} off The Rock on 10December 1796 when a storm blew up. Culloden {{was obliged}} {{to get under way}} when her anchors failed to hold, narrowly missing Pearl Rock in the process, and at 21:00, Gibraltar was forced to cut her cable. As she was attempting to get clear of Cabrita Point at 22:00, her fore topmast snapped and her foresail, mainsail, main topmast staysail, and mizzen staysail tore. Having already lost her main topsail, she became difficult to handle and struck the sandbank several times before being blown across it. By midnight Gibraltar was out <b>of</b> <b>danger</b> and able to ride out the storm, and the next day at noon she anchored in Tangier Bay. The damage incurred during the storm necessitated her being sent to Plymouth in January 1797. During the repairs, which took until April and cost £12,818, a large piece of rock was removed from her hull. Gibraltar returned to the Mediterranean in July 1797 under Captain William Hancock Kelly.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{served to}} protect Sutton Pool, {{which is where}} the fleet was based in Plymouth prior to the {{establishment}} of Plymouth Dockyard. In 1512 an Act of Parliament was passed for further fortifying Plymouth. A series of fortifications were built, including defensive walls at the entrance to Sutton Pool (across which a chain would be extended in time <b>of</b> <b>danger).</b> Defences on St Nicholas Island also date from this time, and a string of six artillery blockhouses were built, including one on Fishers Nose at the south-eastern corner of the Hoe. This location was further strengthened by the building of a fort (later known as Drake's Fort) in 1596; it was the site of the Citadel, established in the 1660s (see below).|$|E
5|$|The {{enormous}} {{effort of}} the estimated population of 100 to 150 thousand residents of the Gniezno region {{who were involved in}} building or modernizing Gniezno and several other main Piast gords was made in response to a perceived deadly threat, not just to help them pursue regional conquests. After 935, when the Gniezno people were probably already led by Mieszko's father Siemomysł, the Czechs conquered Silesia and soon moved also against Germany. The fear of desecration of their tribal cult center by the advancing Czechs could have mobilized the community. A Polabian Slav uprising was suppressed around 940 by Germany under Otto I, and the eastbound moving Saxons must have added to the sense <b>of</b> <b>danger</b> at that time (unless the Piast state was already allied with Otto, helping restrain the Polabians). When the situation stabilized, the Piast state consolidated and the huge gords turned out to be handy for facilitating the Piast's own expansion, led at this stage by Siemomysł.|$|E
