In this study, we examined {{the extent to which}} facial stereotypes for occupational groups were based on physiognomic cues to stereotypical social characteristics. In Experiment 1, participants rated the occupational stereotypicality of naturalistic face images. These ratings were then regressed onto independent ratings of the faces on 16 separate traits. These traits, particularly those relevant to the <b>occupational</b> <b>stereotype,</b> explained the majority of variance in occupational stereotypicality ratings. In Experiments 2 and 3, we used trait ratings to reconstruct stereotypical occupation faces from a separate set of images, using face averaging techniques. These reconstructed facial stereotypes were validated by separate groups of participants as conforming to the <b>occupational</b> <b>stereotype.</b> These results indicate that facial cues and group stereotypes are integrated through shared semantic content in the cognitive representations of groups...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSocial and {{communication}} impairments {{are part of}} the essential diagnostic criteria used to define Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs). Difficulties in appreciating non-literal speech, such as irony in ASDs have been explained as due to impairments in social understanding and in recognizing the speaker's communicative intention. It has been shown that social-interactional factors, such as a listener's beliefs about the speaker's attitudinal propensities (e. g., a tendency to use sarcasm, to be mocking, less sincere and more prone to criticism), as conveyed by an <b>occupational</b> <b>stereotype,</b> do influence a listener's interpretation of potentially ironic remarks. We investigate the effect of <b>occupational</b> <b>stereotype</b> on irony detection in adults with High Functioning Autism or Asperger Syndrome (HFA/AS) and a comparison group of typically developed adults. We used a series of verbally presented stories containing ironic or literal utterances produced by a speaker having either a "sarcastic" or a "non-sarcastic" occupation. Although individuals with HFA/AS were able to recognize ironic intent and occupational stereotypes when the latter are made salient, stereotype information enhanced irony detection and modulated its social meaning (i. e., mockery and politeness) only in comparison participants. We concluded that when stereotype knowledge is not made salient, it does not automatically affect pragmatic communicative processes in individuals with HFA/AS...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} Gottfredson's theory (1981) of vocational development, {{which suggests that}} occupational preferences and <b>occupational</b> <b>stereotypes</b> are influenced firstly by sex-typing, {{between the ages of}} six and eight, and secondly by social background, between the ages of nine and thirteen. A large, heterogenous sample (396) of New Zealand school pupils, aged between five and fourteen were asked about the occupations they would like to do, using free and forced choice formats, and these responses were then tested for their relationship with gender, age, parental socio-economic status and ability. A forced choice Occupational Card Sort, comprising 15 occupations, was used to measure sex-type and status dimensions of <b>occupational</b> <b>stereotypes</b> and effects for age and gender were investigated. Data were analysed using discriminant analysis and contingency analysis. Results indicated that gender was a strong influence on the sex-typing of occupational preferences and <b>occupational</b> <b>stereotypes</b> from the age of five (younger than the age suggested by Gottfredson), with males demonstrating more rigid sex-typing than females. Consistent with Gottfredson's theory, socio-economic background and ability were significant influences on status level of occupational preferences for respondents aged over nine years, with results suggesting that ability had a more direct influence on the status level of occupational preferences than did parental socio-economic status. The developmental pattern for the formation of <b>occupational</b> <b>stereotypes</b> was not as predicted by Gottfredson's theory, as both the sex-type and status level elements of <b>occupational</b> <b>stereotypes</b> were evident from the age of five. Results further suggested a weakening of sex-typing of <b>occupational</b> <b>stereotypes</b> with increasing age. The inconsistencies of present findings with Gottfredson's theory were discussed in the context of previous research and the developmental literature, and the usefulness of the theory in relation to occupational choice was evaluated. Implications of the present findings for careers awareness and education programmes were considered. It was concluded that Gottfredson's theory provides a useful framework for examining early vocational development, but that the failure of the theory to explain deviant developmental patterns limits the theory's explanatory power. It was suggested that the theory's usefulness would be enhanced by recognising the impact of environmental influences such as campaigns to encourage women into non-traditional careers and by incorporating more psychological influences such as self-cognitions...|$|R

GIST is an Action Research project aiming to improve girls' participation in scientific and technological studies at school when these become optional. The initial survey was conducted with 2065 first year children in ten co-educational comprehensive schools in Greater Manchester. Eight of these were action schools where interventions designed to change girls' attitudes and achievements were implemented; {{the other two were}} control schools. The initial survey was intended to assess children's attitudes to science and technical crafts, their backgrond knowledge in these subjects and their attitudes towards sex roles. The initial 11 year old cohort was followed up with a second survey in 1983, a survey of school records in 1985 and a postal questionnaire in 1987, when the cohort was 17 years of age. Main Topics : Variables Ten questionnaires were administered: 1) Background questionnaire - details of family situation, division of labour within the home, person orientation 2) School questionnaire - attitudes to school, perceived male and female competencies within school 3) Image of science - four scales: liking for science, science in the world, the scientist, science as masculine 4) Science curiosity - desire to learn about different aspects of science: physical, biological, theoretical, spectacular 5) Science activities - participation in hobbies and activities which might develop skills relevent to science and technology 6) <b>Occupational</b> <b>stereotype</b> - suitability of a range of occupations for girls, for boys and for self 7) Gender stereotype - suitability of a range of activities for girls, for boys and for self 8) Science Knowledge - cognitive test in science 9) Spatial Visualisation - spatial ability test 10) Mechanical Reasoning. Most children completed either the occupational or the gender stereotyping inventory (not both). In addition some sort of IQ score was available from Local Authority records for most children, and the parents of children in one school were studied by postal questionnaire and interview. The initial survey provided a benchmark against which the success of the interventions can be assessed. Further attitude tests were administered to the same children in Spring 1983 (see SN 2382), to show differential attitude changes in action and control schools. The results of the survey were fed back to teachers in the action schools, with practical suggestions based on the findings. Users should note that the documentation for this study is limited to a research report. It may not be possible to replicate the report tables using the current data files. <br...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} explores—using an intersectionist perspective—how {{a representative}} sample of college undergraduates engages in the processes of <b>occupational</b> <b>stereotyping</b> and <b>occupational</b> ranking in the new economy. This study extends existing scholarship in the areas of <b>occupational</b> <b>stereotyping</b> and <b>occupational</b> prestige-ranking by: (1) exploring these social-psychological processes in the new economy, (2) using an intersectionist framework to explore these multidimensional phenomena, and (3) employing an explanatory, sequential mixed methods design. ^ In the first phase of this study, I collected survey data regarding how {{a representative sample}} of undergraduates rank-ordered 15 U.

It was concluded from this phase of the study that these undergraduates—regardless of their race-sex statuses—share a similar perception of the hierarchical nature of today 2 ̆ 7 s labor market. However, the four race-sex subgroups were more inclined to disagree about how similar and dissimilar the occupations are. After uncovering how the undergraduates ranked occupations in today 2 ̆ 7 s economy, the survey also compared the probabilities for each race-sex subgroup linking different groups of workers with different types of occupations. Data show that the undergraduates—across the four race-sex subgroups—perceive more privileged groups of workers (i. e., white, upper-class males) as being most likely to be employed in more desirable occupations, while less privileged groups of workers (i. e., racial-ethnic minorities, lower-class women and some men) as being most likely to be employed in less desirable occupations. Of the four race-sex subgroups, the data report that female undergraduates—especially racial-ethnic minority females—were less conventional in their <b>occupational</b> <b>stereotypes.</b> In the third and final phase of this study, I performed a collective, qualitative case study with a subset of the research population.

On International Women’s Day 2008, school aged girls were informed by a very pink website that ‘tech girls are chic not just geek’ 2. Such strategies are implemented as a response to gender and <b>occupational</b> <b>stereotypes</b> associated with the ICT industry, which may make it unappealing for women to pursue an ICT career path, such as ‘geeky, lonely male nerds’ being the norm. However, how do initiatives which promote the femininity or sexuality of female ICT workers encourage more women into the workplace? Are we now suggesting that all women working in ICT need to look glamorous and not admit to being a geek?

40|$|The purpose ofthis {{study was}} to examine the <b>occupational</b> gender role <b>stereotypes</b> of {{elementary}} school children. The concern is that young kids are repeatedly exposed to gendered <b>occupational</b> <b>stereotypes,</b> which may limit their vocational options and therefore be less likely to pursue gender bending careers later in life. According the Miller and Budd (1999), children are socialized very early in life to learn that there are certain careers that are just for females and just for males. Research has consistently reported that children desire jobs which match the stereotypes and expectations placed upon their own sex, and a child's gender has been found to be the biggest predictor of their occupational preferences, over interests, monetary gain, etc. (Sellars et al., 1999).

40|$|Increasingly, {{developmental}} psychology has emphasized that childhood career development {{should be viewed}} as holistic and comprise all aspects of a child’s maturation. This would include an emphasis on the career development of children which is considered vital to the complete education of the child (Brown, 2002). Career development refers to the process of developing beliefs, values, skills, aptitudes, interests, personality characteristics and knowledge of work (Zunker, 2006). Research has indicated that early societal factors and personal preferences associated with gender influence the child’s later occupational aspirations (Stockard & McGee, 1990). There are many ways in which individuals learn about gender roles and acquire “gender-appropriate” behaviour during childhood, some of which manifest in the occupational aspirations of children. As children grow up they learn, through reinforcement and modeling, that society has different expectations and standards for the behaviour of males and females. While family and friends are often the most important agents of socialization in young children, television and other popular media have also played a vital role in gender stereotyping, resulting in children forming perceptions regarding which occupations “belong” to which gender (Taylor, Peplau, & Sears, 2006). The present research aims to explore, describe and compare the occupational aspirations and the <b>occupational</b> gender <b>stereotyping</b> of male and female South African and Australian senior primary school learners. The research approach for the study was descriptive and exploratory in nature and was conducted within a quantitative framework. A survey-type questionnaire, the Career Awareness Survey xiii (McMahon & Watson, 2001), was used as the data collection measure {{as part of a larger}} international study. The sample comprised of 511 South African and 372 Australian participants from Grades 6 and 7. Responses to the occupational aspirations questions were coded according to Holland’s (1985) interest typology and status level coding for occupations. For descriptive purposes, frequency counts were computed for the coded typology, status level and <b>occupational</b> gender <b>stereotyping</b> data. The z-test and chi-square test for independence were computed in order to test whether gender groups differed in terms of their occupational aspirations and <b>occupational</b> <b>stereotyping.</b> The chi-square test was also used to compare the occupational aspirations and gender stereotyping of South African and Australian senior primary school learners. The results of the present research indicate that male and female South African and Australian female children tend to aspire towards more Investigative and Social type occupations in the high status level category. The Australian male children, however, tend to aspire towards more Social and Realistic type occupations in the high status level category. Across nation and gender, the majority of the children believed that both males and females could perform certain occupations, with senior primary school children tending to limit the range of occupations which they believe to be predominantly suited to either male or female. Cross-national comparative results yielded interesting findings with few significant differences emerging on occupational aspiration typology, status level and the <b>occupational</b> gender <b>stereotyping</b> of occupations.

Methodology includes two short interviews with V and E, contemporary choreographers of Wheels of Fire. These choreographers/leaders combine masculine and feminine moves in their routines to be performed simultaneously by male and female members, focus on feeling as opposed to form, accept different bodies, and break down hierarchies. Their work and actions challenge gender, racial, and <b>occupational</b> <b>stereotypes...</b>|$|R
40|$|International {{research}} highlights conflicting results regarding {{factors that}} could {{play a role in}} the development of occupational aspirations and <b>occupational</b> gender <b>stereotyping</b> of primary school children. Some of the variables that have been identified are age, gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status and societal influences. There has been some research emphasis on the career development of South Africans. However, studies that have been conducted have focused mainly on adolescents and adults. Furthermore, the majority of this research has focused on programme intervention and not on acquiring baseline information. There has been no research to date on the career development of South African Xhosa-speaking senior primary school children. The lack of career research on South African Xhosa-speaking children indicates the need for the present research. This study aims to describe and compare the occupational aspirations and <b>occupational</b> gender <b>stereotyping</b> (in terms of Holland’s occupational and status level typology) of male and female Xhosa-speaking senior primary school learners. The study also describes the possible gender stereotypical perceptions preadolescent children hold regarding certain occupations. A non-probability sample of 274 Xhosa-speaking children between the ages of 10 and 14 years was drawn from two primary schools in townships in the Nelson Mandela Metropole. An exploratory and descriptive research framework was utilised, with descriptive statistical procedures employed to summarise and report the data in a meaningful manner. The major findings of the present study indicate that Xhosa-speaking senior primary school children’s favourite occupational aspirations fit into Holland’s Investigative typology and high status level. Some gender differences were evident, with slightly more boys aspiring to Investigative occupations than girls. Both boys and girls demonstrated gender stereotypical perceptions regarding xiii which occupations were suitable for both genders, with boys more willing to accept girls into traditional male occupations than girls willing to accept boys into traditional female occupations. The results of the present study emphasise the need for further exploration of the occupational aspirations and <b>occupational</b> ge nder <b>stereotyping</b> of Xhosa-speaking senior primary school children. Future research needs to include other cultural and age groups in order to explore how personal and situational variables may differentially influence children’s occupational aspirations and <b>occupational</b> gender <b>stereotyping...</b>|$|R
40|$|As {{marketers}} {{more and}} more are acknowledging {{the diversity of the}} American marketplace by using non-standard ad models (Zmuda 2014), understanding the potential risks and benefits of these non-standard models becomes important. My research shows that by including models who are members of a stereotyped group in an advertisement, there may be unintended consequences in how the brand or product is perceived. In this dissertation, I find evidence to support the idea that stereotype associations activated by the use of stereotypical models transfer to advertised products, influencing the perceptions of brand personality and product attributes, and that this transfer is more likely to occur when people are not paying full attention to the advertisement. Together, three of the seven studies demonstrate a stereotype transfer effect from advertising model to brand personality and product attributes. The stereotype transfer effect is shown across multiple stereotypes: <b>occupational</b> <b>stereotypes</b> (businessperson and stay-at-home parent), math-related female stereotypes, and stereotypes of overweight women. The studies indicate that it is more likely to occur under conditions of high cognitive load, when less attention is paid to the advertisement, and explore two alternative explanations for the effect...|$|R
40|$|An {{exploratory}} {{case study}} {{which seeks to}} understand better the problem of low participation rates of women in Information Communication Technology (ICT) is currently being conducted in Queensland, Australia. Contextualised within the Digital Content Industry (DCI) multimedia and games production sectors, {{the emphasis is on}} women employed as interactive content creators rather than as users of the technologies. Initial findings provide rich descriptive insights into the perceptions and experiences of female DCI professionals. Influences on participation such as: existing gender ratios, gender and <b>occupational</b> <b>stereotypes,</b> access into the industry and future parental responsibilities have emerged from the data. Bandura’s (1999) Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) is used as a “scaffold” (Walsham, 1995 : 76) to guide data analysis and assist analytic generalisation of the case study findings. We propose that the lens of human agency and theories such as SCT assist in explaining how influences are manifested and affect women’s agency and ultimately participation in the DCI. The Sphere of Influence conceptual model (Geneve et al, 2008), which emerges from the data and underpinning theory, is proposed as a heuristic framework to further explore influences on women’s participation in the DCI industry context...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} devised {{to test the}} {{hypothesis}} that rural ninth grade students viewing videotaped field trips as part of vocational group guidance classes will exhibit greater occupational knowledge than similar groups who do not view the videotapes. Subjects were 262 ninth grade students from four rural high schools; the schools were paired to form a control and an experimental group. Both groups met for a class period twice weekly for 14 weeks. The experimental group centered discussions and reading around 20 -minute videotapes which portrayed a variety of occupations such as paper industry, machine trade, communication, office, and public utility occupations, while the control group read and discussed the same occupations using commercially produced reading materials. Responses from three questionnaires which were administered {{at the end of the}} 14 -week period were analyzed. Limited positive results obtained showed that videotapes appear to influence the accuracy of stereotypes reported and to stimulate a wider range of occupational possibilities in schools where counselors are employed. Also, it appears that girls are more likely to present scattered occupational choices and less likely to seek occupational information or state positive <b>occupational</b> <b>stereotypes.</b> (SH...|$|R
40|$|The paper explores some of {{the reasons}} for the large {{imbalance}} between male and female students entering the Bachelor of Information Technology degree from high schools. The literature suggests that only one in six students entering higher education to study computer related degrees are female. It also suggests that <b>occupational</b> <b>stereotyping</b> can be linked to the decline in the number of females entering computing degree courses. This study examines the influences and perceptions of both male and female students leaving high school in 2012 from four schools in the Southland region of New Zealand. A survey was conducted over a four week period in October/November 2012 with four schools in Southland to gather evidence regarding their influences of what Information Communication Technology involved or how they perceived ICT as a job. From the results females found the perception of ICT as interesting, well paid and secure but still do not want to take up roles within the industry. One of the recommendations that came out of this paper would be to look further into the perception of ICT and how that relates to the career choices made by female students...|$|R
