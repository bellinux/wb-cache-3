5|$|Modern {{critical}} opinion {{has been}} kinder {{than that of}} Bizet's day. Commentators describe {{the quality of the}} music as uneven and at times unoriginal, but acknowledge the opera as a work <b>of</b> <b>promise</b> in which Bizet's gifts for melody and evocative instrumentation are clearly evident. They have identified clear foreshadowings of the composer's genius which would culminate, 10 years later, in Carmen. Since 1950 the work has been recorded on numerous occasions, in both the revised and original versions.|$|E

Meanwhile, Bryce attempts to escape, but is subdued and later comforted by Lucy Butler. Black interviews Roe, suspecting her involvement when she continually refers to Bryce in the past tense. He later discovers that in every school she has worked for, students have been kidnapped; all the victims resembled Bryce in being average students who showed signs <b>of</b> <b>promise.</b>|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{theoretical}} framework within which to evaluate the reliability <b>of</b> <b>promises</b> that an agent makes, based on past performance of the agent. Our frame-work does not just propose one such measure, but defines ax-ioms that govern the choice of measure. The framework is able to account for partial fulfillment <b>of</b> <b>promises,</b> late fulfill-ment <b>of</b> <b>promises,</b> fulfillment <b>of</b> variants <b>of</b> <b>promises,</b> and the like. Within this framework, we propose some specific mea-sures to evaluate promises made by agents and develop algo-rithms to compute these efficiently. We tested our methods on a real world data set of airline flight information and show that our methods are both accurate and quickly computable, even on large data sets.

5|$|By 1933, Hutton was {{regularly}} {{opening the}} batting for the Pudsey St Lawrence first {{team in the}} Bradford Cricket League. By close observation of his opening partner, the former Yorkshire county batsman Edgar Oldroyd, Hutton further developed his batting technique, especially in defence. The local press soon identified Hutton as a player <b>of</b> <b>promise,</b> particularly after he scored a match-winning 108 not out in the Priestley Cup. Senior figures within Yorkshire cricket identified him as a potential successor to Percy Holmes as an opening partner to Sutcliffe; {{at this stage in}} his career, Hutton was also considered a promising leg spin bowler. In the 1933 season Hutton was selected for the Yorkshire Second Eleven. Although he failed to score a run in either of his first two innings, over the season he scored 699 runs at an average of 69.90. Yorkshire appointed Cyril Turner as Hutton's mentor; Hedley Verity and Bowes also offered Hutton guidance in his early career.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} {{a unique perspective}} to the milk market relative to previous studies. While there is rich literature on the various sectors of the milk market, a contribution to this literature was made by providing a specific econometric analysis <b>of</b> the <b>Promised</b> Land brand. Previous work conducted by Capps and Salin (2010) provided the foundation for this thesis. The purpose of this thesis was threefold: 1. Estimate household demand functions for Promised Land white and chocolate milk using Nielsen homescan data. The demand functions were estimated using a tobit model to estimate the conditional and unconditional own-price and cross-price effects <b>of</b> <b>Promised</b> Land white and chocolate milk. 2. Assess the impacts of household demographic drivers <b>of</b> demand for <b>Promised</b> Land white and chocolate milk. 3. Use the empirical results derived from the tobit model to identify substitutes and complements <b>of</b> <b>Promised</b> Land white and chocolate milk and provide a profile of households that purchase Promised Land white and chocolate milk. The study concluded that households who purchased Promised Land white were insensitive {{to changes in the}} price <b>of</b> <b>Promised</b> Land white milk. The price of private label milk was the only cross-price that was significant in the quantity <b>of</b> <b>Promised</b> Land white milk purchased. The estimated elasticities showed that Promised Land white milk and private label white milk were substitutes. From the estimated elasticities, it was found that households that purchased Promised Land chocolate milk were largely insensitive to changes in the price <b>of</b> <b>Promised</b> Land chocolate milk. It was also found that the prices of Nesquick, Oak Farms, and private label chocolate milk had a significant effect on the quantity <b>of</b> <b>Promised</b> Land chocolate milk purchased. Of these significant prices, private label and Oak Farms chocolate milk were substitutes for Promised Land chocolate milk. The price of Nesquick chocolate milk demonstrated a complementary relationship with Promised Land chocolate milk...|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{pervasive}} use <b>of</b> <b>promises</b> and threats in social life, very {{little research has}} been devoted to examining the effectiveness of these interpersonal tactics in promoting cooperation in social dilemmas. Based on the Goal-Prescribes-Rationality principle, we hypothesized that cooperation should be most strongly enhanced when promises and threats are communicated in combination, rather than in isolation. Also, we hypothesized that the combination <b>of</b> <b>promises</b> and threats should be especially effective among individuals with prosocial rather than proself orientations. Two studies provided good evidence for the latter hypothesis, in that the combination <b>of</b> <b>promises</b> and threats was only effective in people with prosocial orientations, people who are concerned with equality and collective interest.
