500|$|Technological {{advances}} began affecting sentence spacing methods. [...] In 1941, IBM {{introduced the}} Executive, a typewriter capable of proportional spacing—which {{had been used}} in professional typesetting for hundreds of years. [...] This innovation broke the hold that the monospaced font had on the typewriter, reducing the severity of its mechanical limitations. By the 1960s, electronic phototypesetting systems ignored runs of white space in text. This was also true of the World Wide Web, as HTML normally ignores additional spacing, although in 2011 the CSS 2.1 standard officially added an option that can preserve additional spaces. In the 1980s, desktop publishing software provided the average writer with more advanced formatting tools. By the late 20th century, literature on the written word had begun to adjust its guidance <b>on</b> <b>sentence</b> spacing.|$|E
500|$|Direct studies <b>on</b> <b>{{sentence}}</b> spacing {{include those}} by Loh, Branch, Shewanown, and Ali (2002); Clinton, Branch, Holschuh, and Shewanown (2003); and Ni, Branch, and Chen (2004), with results favoring neither single, double, nor triple spacing. The 2002 study tested participants' reading speed for single and double sentence spaced passages of on-screen text. [...] The authors stated that [...] "the 'double space group' consistently took longer {{time to finish}} than the 'single space' group" [...] but concluded that [...] "there was not enough {{evidence to suggest that}} a significant difference exists". The 2003 and 2004 studies analyzed on-screen single, double, and triple spacing. [...] In both cases, the authors stated that there was insufficient evidence to draw a conclusion. Ni, Branch, Chen, and Clinton conducted a similar study in 2009 using identical spacing variables. [...] The authors concluded that the [...] "results provided insufficient evidence that time and comprehension differ significantly among different conditions of spacing between sentences".|$|E
500|$|Early style {{guides for}} {{typesetting}} used a wider space between sentences than between words—"traditional spacing", {{as shown in}} the illustration to the right. During the 20th century, style guides commonly mandated two spaces between sentences for typewritten manuscripts, which were used prior to professionally typesetting the work. As computer desktop publishing became commonplace, typewritten manuscripts became less relevant and most style guides stopped making distinctions between manuscripts and final typeset products. In the same period, style guides began changing their guidance <b>on</b> <b>sentence</b> spacing. [...] The 1969 edition of the Chicago Manual of Style used em spaces between sentences in its text; by the 2003 edition it had changed to single sentence spacing for both manuscript and print. [...] By the 1980s, the United Kingdom's Hart's Rules (1983) had shifted to single sentence spacing. [...] Other style guides followed suit in the 1990s. Soon after the beginning of the 21st century, the majority of style guides had changed to indicate that only one word space was proper between sentences.|$|E

The German language manual Empfehlungen des Rats für Deutsche Rechtschreibung, or [...] "Recommendations of the Council for German Orthography" [...] (2006), does not address sentence spacing.

Additionally, the Duden, the German language dictionary most commonly used in Germany, indicates that double sentence spacing is an error. The Duden was the primary orthography and style guide dictionary in Germany until the German orthography reform of 1996 created a multinational council for German orthography for German-speaking countries—composed of experts from Germany, Austria, Liechtenstein and Switzerland. The current version of the Duden reflects the most recent opinions of this council. The Spanish language is similar. The most important body within the Association of Spanish Language Academies, the Real Academia Española, publishes the Diccionario de la Lengua Española, which is viewed as prescriptive for the Spanish language worldwide.

Functions The Sentencing Advisory Council {{is an independent}} statutory body that was established in July 2004 under Part 9 A of the Sentencing Act 1991 (Vic). The Council’s functions, {{as set out in}} section 108 C(1) of that Act, are: (a) to state in writing to the Court of Appeal its views in relation to the giving, or review, of a guideline judgment; (b) to provide statistical information <b>on</b> <b>sentencing,</b> including information <b>on</b> current <b>sentencing</b> practices, to members of the judiciary and other interested persons; (c) to conduct research, and disseminate information to members of the judiciary and other interested persons, <b>on</b> <b>sentencing</b> matters; (d) to gauge public opinion <b>on</b> <b>sentencing</b> matters; (e) to consult, <b>on</b> <b>sentencing</b> matters, with government departments and other interested persons and bodies as well as the general public; and (f) to advise the Attorney-General <b>on</b> <b>sentencing</b> matters. The Council was established to allow properly ascertained and informed public opinion {{to be taken into account}} in the criminal justice system on a permanent and formal basis. This is in part achieved through the membership of the Council, because it is comprised of people with a wide range of backgrounds, including those with broad community experience in issues affecting courts, as well as police, legal practitioners, members of victim of crime support or advocacy groups and others with broad experience in the operation of the criminal justice system...|$|R
