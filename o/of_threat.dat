5|$|Lepidopterans {{are soft}} bodied, fragile and almost defenseless while the {{immature}} stages move slowly or are immobile, hence all stages {{are exposed to}} predation by birds, small mammals, lizards, amphibians, invertebrate predators (notably parasitoid and parasitic wasps and flies) as well as fungi and bacteria. To combat this, Lepidoptera have developed a number of strategies for defense and protection which include camouflage, aposematism, mimicry, and the development <b>of</b> <b>threat</b> patterns and displays.|$|E
5|$|Males become {{extremely}} aggressive during musth. Size is {{the determining factor}} in agonistic encounters when the individuals have the same condition. In contests between musth and non-musth individuals, musth bulls win {{the majority of the}} time, even when the non-musth bull is larger. A male may stop showing signs of musth when he encounters a musth male of higher rank. Those of equal rank tend to avoid each other. Agonistic encounters typically consist <b>of</b> <b>threat</b> displays, chases, and minor sparring with the tusks. Serious fights are rare.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) is the {{organisation}} responsible for assessing the conservation status of species. A species is assessed as subject to varying levels <b>of</b> <b>threat</b> {{if it has a}} small, fragmented or declining range, or if the total population is less than 10,000 mature individuals, or if numbers have dropped rapidly (by more than 10% in ten years or three generations).

5|$|In 2005, Rasmussen {{was part}} of a large multi-institutional {{collaboration}} investigating biodiversity hotspots, which have a prominent role in conservation. The study assessed locations quantitatively for three criteria of bird diversity – species richness, the level <b>of</b> <b>threat,</b> and the number of endemism species. The results demonstrated that hotspots did not show the same geographical distribution for each factor. Only 2.5% of hotspot areas are common to all three aspects of diversity, with over 80% of hotspots registering on only one criterion. Each criterion explained less than 24% of the variation in the other factors, suggesting that even within a single taxonomic class, different mechanisms are responsible for the origin and maintenance of various aspects of diversity. Consequently, the different types of hotspots also vary greatly in their utility as conservation tools.|$|E
5|$|Stalin {{believed}} that economic integration with the West would allow Eastern Bloc countries to escape Soviet control, {{and that the}} US was trying to buy a pro-US re-alignment of Europe. Stalin therefore prevented Eastern Bloc nations from receiving Marshall Plan aid. The Soviet Union's alternative to the Marshall Plan, which was purported to involve Soviet subsidies and trade with central and eastern Europe, {{became known as the}} Molotov Plan (later institutionalized in January 1949 as the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance). Stalin was also fearful of a reconstituted Germany; his vision of a post-war Germany did not include the ability to rearm or pose any kind <b>of</b> <b>threat</b> to the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|Although the Igor Gouzenko and Elizabeth Bentley affairs {{had raised}} the issue of Soviet espionage as far back as 1945, events in 1949 and 1950 sharply {{increased}} the sense <b>of</b> <b>threat</b> from Communism in the United States. The Soviet Union tested an atomic bomb in 1949, earlier than many analysts had expected. That same year, Mao Zedong's Communist army gained control of mainland China despite heavy American financial support of the opposing Kuomintang. In 1950, the Korean War began, pitting U.S., U.N., and South Korean forces against Communists from North Korea and China. The following year also saw several significant developments regarding Soviet Cold War espionage activities. In January 1950, Alger Hiss, a high-level State Department official, was convicted of perjury. Hiss was in effect found guilty of espionage; the statute of limitations had run out for that crime, but he was convicted of having perjured himself when he denied that charge in earlier testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee. In Great Britain, Klaus Fuchs confessed to committing espionage on behalf of the Soviet Union while working on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos National Laboratory during the War. Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were arrested in 1950 on charges of stealing atomic bomb secrets for the Soviets and were executed in 1953.|$|E

5|$|In Europe, the {{practice}} was most prevalent from the medieval era until the outbreak of World War I, but evidence of intermarriage between royal dynasties {{in other parts of}} the world can be found as far back as the Late Bronze Age. Monarchs were often in pursuit of national and international aggrandisement on behalf of themselves and their dynasties, thus bonds of kinship tended to promote or restrain aggression. Marriage between dynasties could serve to initiate, reinforce or guarantee peace between nations. Alternatively, kinship by marriage could secure an alliance between two dynasties which sought to reduce the sense <b>of</b> <b>threat</b> from or to initiate aggression against the realm of a third dynasty. It could also enhance the prospect of territorial acquisition for a dynasty by procuring legal claim to a foreign throne, or portions of its realm (e.g., colonies), through inheritance from an heiress whenever a monarch failed to leave an undisputed male heir.|$|E
5|$|McCarthyism {{has taken}} on a broader meaning, {{describing}} the excesses of similar efforts. The term is also now used more generally to describe reckless, unsubstantiated accusations, as well as demagogic attacks on the character or patriotism of political adversaries. During the McCarthy era, hundreds of Americans were accused of being communists or communist sympathizers and became the subject of aggressive investigations and questioning before government or private-industry panels, committees and agencies. The primary targets of such suspicions were government employees, those in the entertainment industry, educators and labor union activists. Suspicions were often given credence despite inconclusive or questionable evidence, and the level <b>of</b> <b>threat</b> posed by a person's real or supposed leftist associations or beliefs was sometimes exaggerated. Many people suffered loss of employment or destruction of their careers; some even suffered imprisonment. Most of these punishments came about through trial verdicts later overturned, laws that were later declared unconstitutional, dismissals for reasons later declared illegal or actionable, or extra-legal procedures that would come into general disrepute.|$|E

40|$|The present article {{analyses}} <b>threats</b> <b>of</b> {{armed force}} by states against other states. After determining what conduct {{amounts to a}} ‘threat of force’, {{the current status of}} its prohibition is investigated. In particular, this article contends that the prohibition <b>of</b> the <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> force contained in Article 2 (4) of the UN Charter reflects customary international law. The fact that only a few states have supported the legality <b>of</b> <b>threats</b> for certain law enforcement purposes prevents the prohibition <b>of</b> any <b>threats</b> <b>of</b> force from being qualified as jus cogens. This status should be limited to the prohibition <b>of</b> <b>threats</b> <b>of</b> aggression, which constitutes the common denominator of the practice and opinio juris of all states. The consequences <b>of</b> <b>threats</b> <b>of</b> force under the law of treaties, the law of state responsibility and international criminal law are then discussed, in particular treaties, the conclusion of which has been obtained by the <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> force in violation of the UN Charter are void ab initio. Article 41 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility could also entail a duty of non-recognition of situations procured by the <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> aggression. On the other hand, <b>threats</b> <b>of</b> aggression (let alone <b>threats</b> <b>of</b> less serious forms of the use of force) cannot be qualified as international crimes entailing individual responsibility. As to remedies at the disposal of the victim state, armed responses to <b>threats</b> <b>of</b> force would be lawful only within the limits of self-defence, and only if the threatened armed attack is imminent enough to meet the Caroline requirements. On the contrary, coercive responses to non-imminent armed attacks are still prohibited under contemporary international law. ...|$|R

In order to ensure that healthcare units shall be able {{to meet the needs of}} patients and at the same time be certain that the work environment is safe for nurses, it is important to precision what threats and violence actually mean.

The Purpose: was to bring to light nurses’ definitions and experiences <b>of</b> <b>threats</b> and violence and at the same time describe how they perceive daily working enviroment within psychiatry. The Method: the work was built on twenty nurses presently working in various psychiatric clinics. We made use of a data collection method that is built upon semi-structured interviews where we there after, in a sytematic and step by step process, classified the data through qualitative content analysis in order to more easily identify and condense pertinent sentence concepts.
