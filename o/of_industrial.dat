40|$|Regional {{industrial}} restructuring {{has been one}} of the major items in the transformation of economic development mode. An exploration was made into the influence of tax arrangement on the regional industrial structure by setting up a panel data econometric model based on the evaluation and analysis <b>of</b> the regional <b>industrial</b> structure in China.

Microlevel: the turnover tax and income tax appeared with a U-path of influence on upgrading <b>of</b> the <b>industrial</b> structure while appearing with an inverted U-path of influence on rationalization <b>of</b> the <b>industrial</b> structure. In addition, the levy of resource tax had a negative impact on both upgrading and rationalization <b>of</b> the <b>industrial</b> structure.

An increase of taxation in the secondary industry had a negative impact on rationalization <b>of</b> the <b>industrial</b> structure.
