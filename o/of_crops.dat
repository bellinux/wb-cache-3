At the beginning, flexural rigidity values (EI) <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> stalks were calculated from the results of de flection test using image processing apparatus. Further, deflection values and posture <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> stalks were predicted by analysis of Finite Element Method (FEM) using parameters of EI. Therefore, propriety of FEM analysis was examined through the comparison with measured values. Finally, in this study, the following results were obtained: 1) The deflection <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> stalks could be returned to initial condition in a moment against a light load. But, against a heavy load, it took a little time to return to initial condition. Namely, the crop stalks were indicated to have characteristics of viscous elasticity. 2) Deflection values and posture <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> stalks calculated by FEM analysis almost coincided with measured values. From this result, deflection characteristics <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> stalks will be examined theoretically by FEM analysis if EI are obtained accurately. 3) The EI <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> stalks both rice and wheat became larger gradually {{in the direction of the}} root according as cross section area of stalk became larger. 収穫作業時における作物稈に作用する機械的作用を究明するため,画像処理装置を用いて作物(稲･小麦) 稈の撓み計測,曲げ剛さ(EI) の計算並びに有限要素法による作物稈の撓み姿勢や撓み量の計算値を実測値と比較し,撓み特性について考察を行った. 得られた主な結果は次のとおりである. 1) 稲･小麦稈に軽い荷重をかけた場合は,初期状態にすぐに回復したが,荷重が大きくなるに従い回復するのに若干の時間を要する. つまり,稲･小麦稈は粘弾性,応力緩和の特性があることを示した. 2) 有限要素法による作物稈の撓み姿勢や撓み量の計算値を実測値と比較した結果,両者ともほぼ一致する傾向が認められた. このことから,曲げ剛さ(EI) の計算精度が非常に高ければ,稲･小麦稈の撓み特性は理論的に考察できることが示唆された. 3) 稲･小麦稈両者ともに根元に行くに従って,稈の断面形状は少しずつ大きくなり,曲げ剛さ(EI) もわずかなばらつきはあるものの大きくなる傾向が見られた...|$|R
