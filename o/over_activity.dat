40|$|This paper {{studies the}} optimal {{allocation}} of decision rights between an uninformed principal and an informed agent when interdependent activities {{need to be}} adapted to local conditions. While the principal cares only about overall pro…ts, the agent may favor higher, or lower, levels for each activity than the pro…t-maximizing level. The principal has limited commitment power and can only commit to an ex-ante allocation of decision rights. Whenever the principal retains some (or all) decision rights the agent communicates his information strategically, i. e. via cheap talk. We show that if activities are complementary the principal can always improve the informativeness of communication by sharing control with the agent, while sharing control <b>over</b> <b>activities</b> that interact as substitutes always worsens communication. As {{a result of this}} communication advantage, sharing control <b>over</b> complementary <b>activities</b> can be optimal, while control <b>over</b> <b>activities</b> that interact as substitutes is optimally allocated to the same party...|$|R

5000|$|Psychosocial {{interventions}} assume 2 {{models of}} chronic facial pain, namely [...] "inactivity" [...] and [...] "over activity". The former is where people with pain become conditioned to avoid physical activity {{as a result}} of exacerbating their pain.

50|$|Cortical ChangesPeople with Parkinson’s disease due {{not lose}} their {{inherent}} {{ability to generate}} normal walking patterns but they have activation problems. There is under activation of left medial frontal area, right precuneus and left cerebellar hemisphere and <b>over</b> <b>activity</b> in left temporal cortex, right insula, left cingulate cortex and cerebellar vermis. Under activation of medial frontal areas is the main mechanism related to observed gait abnormalities. Gait disturbances can also result from decreased activation of cognitive network especially in right posterior parietal cortex. There is disruption of basal ganglia-thalamocortical loop due to striatal dopamine depletion which affects the LTP-like effect in human motor cortex. There is also reduction in ipsilateral corticocortical suppression decrease in excitability intrinsic inhibitory cortex leading to selectivity of cortical discharge during movement. Dopamine alters the regional metabolism of motor cortex leading to intracortical inhibition. This results in functional reorganization of motor maps and excessive corticostriatal synchrony when movement is initiated.|$|E
5000|$|Law: What Lessig calls [...] "Standard East Coast Code", from laws {{enacted by}} {{government}} in Washington D.C. This {{is the most}} self-evident of the four modes of regulation. As the numerous United States statutes, codes, regulations, and evolving case law make clear, many actions on the Internet are already subject to conventional laws, both with regard to transactions conducted on the Internet and content posted. Areas like gambling, child pornography, and fraud are regulated in very similar ways online as off-line. While {{one of the most}} controversial and unclear areas of evolving laws is the determination of what forum has subject matter jurisdiction <b>over</b> <b>activity</b> (economic and other) conducted on the internet, particularly as cross border transactions affect local jurisdictions, it is certainly clear that substantial portions of internet activity are subject to traditional regulation, and that conduct that is unlawful off-line is presumptively unlawful online, and subject to traditional enforcement of similar laws and regulations.|$|E
50|$|As first {{postulated}} by Harvey Cushing, raised {{intracranial pressure}} {{is the primary}} cause of the Cushing reflex. Furthermore, continued moderate increases in cranial pressure allows for the Cushing reflex to occur. In contrast, rapid and dramatic pressure rises do not allow for the mechanism of the reflex to sufficiently take place. Elevated intracranial pressure can result from numerous pathways of brain impairment, including: subarachnoid hemorrhages, ischemia, trauma, including concussions, hypoxia, tumors, and stroke. In one study, it was confirmed that raised ICP due to subarachnoid hemorrhaging causes mechanical distortion of the brainstem, specifically the medulla. Due to the mechanism of the Cushing reflex, brainstem distortion is then swiftly followed by sympathetic nervous system <b>over</b> <b>activity.</b> In addition, during typical neurosurgical procedures on patients, especially those involving neuroendoscopic techniques, frequent washing of the ventricles have been known to cause high intracranial pressure. The Cushing reflex can also result from low CPP, specifically below 15 mmHg. CPP normally falls between 70-90 mmHg in an adult human, and 60-90 mmHg in children.|$|E

5000|$|Frisch's {{early works}} were almost entirely apolitical. In the [...] "Blätter aus dem Brotsack" [...] ("diaries of {{military}} life") published in 1940, {{he comes across}} as a conventional Swiss patriot, reflecting the unifying impact on Swiss society of the perceived invasion risk then emanating from Germany. After 1945 the threat to Swiss values and to the independence of the Swiss state diminished. Frisch now underwent a rapid transformation, evincing a committed political consciousness. In particular, he became highly critical of attempts to divide cultural values from politics, noting in his Diary 1946-1949: [...] "He who does not engage with politics is already a partisan of the political outcome that he wishes to preserve, because he is serving the ruling party" [...] Sonja Rüegg, writing in 1998, says that Frisch's aesthetics are driven by a fundamentally anti-ideological and critical animus, formed from a recognition of the writer's status as an outsider within society. That generates opposition to the ruling order, the privileging of individual partisanship <b>over</b> <b>activity</b> on behalf of a social class, and an emphasis on asking questions.|$|E
50|$|The {{pathophysiology}} of spasmodic torticollis {{is still}} relatively unknown. Spasmodic torticollis is considered neurochemical in nature, {{and does not}} result in structural neurodegenerative changes. Although no lesions {{are present in the}} basal ganglia in primary spasmodic torticollis, fMRI and PET studies have shown abnormalities of the basal ganglia and hyper activation of the cortical areas. Studies have suggested that there is a functional imbalance in the striatal control of the globus pallidus, specifically the substantia nigra pars reticulate. The studies hypothesize the hyper activation of the cortical areas is due to reduced pallidal inhibition of the thalamus, leading to <b>over</b> <b>activity</b> of the medial and prefrontal cortical areas and under activity of the primary motor cortex during movement. It has also been suggested that the functional imbalance is due to an imbalance of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, acetylcholine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid. These neurotransmitters are secreted from the basal ganglia and travel to muscle groups in the neck. An increase in neurotransmitters cause spasms to occur in the neck, resulting in spasmodic torticollis.Studies of local field potentials have also shown an increase of 4-10 Hz oscillatory activity in the globus pallidus internus during myoclonic episodes and an increase of 5-7 Hz activity in dystonic muscles when compared to other primary dystonias. This indicates that oscillatory activity in these frequency bands may be involved in the pathophysiology of spasmodic torticollis.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{possible}} explanation for increased social inhibition {{has to do with}} biological factors. A study of brain activity in those who rate high on the scale for social inhibition showed a number of brain areas that are related to the heightened inhibitions. [...] In their study the researchers aimed to find the link between socially inhibited individuals and an over activation of the cortical social brain network. The researchers did this by examining the brain activity of individuals who rate high in social inhibition as they respond to video clips of facial and bodily expressions that were potentially threatening. What the researchers found was that those who rate high in social inhibition show an overactive orbitofrontal cortex, left temporo-parietal junction, and right extrastriate body area. When the threat -related activity was being presented to the participants, these areas of the brain showed increased activity in comparison to those who do not rate high for social inhibition. What the researchers speculate is that, in this instance, hyperactivity in these brain structures does not mean better functioning. Further, [...] "the orbitofrontal cortex is connected with areas that underlie emotional function and empathy". This relates to one's ability to stimulate how another person feels in their own facial displays. The <b>over</b> <b>activity</b> and decreased function of these brain structures can affect individuals by increasing social inhibition and behaviors related to social inhibition.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the relationship between}} overactive bladder symptoms and urodynamic verification of overactive bladder. Material and Methods: Between June 2011 and November 2011, 159 patients underwent urodynamics (UDS) at our urogynecology unit in the Ege University Hospital. Of these, 95 patients who complained of urgency, {{did not have any}} overt neurological diseases, bladder outlet obstruction and did not take any medication affecting the lower urinary tract function were evaluated. SPSS (ver. 15. 0) was used to evaluate the data and the chi-square test and t test for independent samples were used for analysis. Results: The mean age was found to be 54. 5 ± 12. Frequency was the most frequent symptom in women with overactive bladder (OAB) (82. 1 %), nocturia (57. 8 %) and (57. 8 %) urgency urinary incontinence followed in frequency. Detrusor <b>over</b> <b>activity</b> incidence was found to be 38. 9 %. There was no significant relationship between the presence of detrusor <b>over</b> <b>activity</b> (DOA) and OAB symptoms. Leak at urodynamics was found in 46. 3 % and there is no significant association with detrusor overactivity. Total bladder capacity was found to be significantly lower in women who had DOA (p= 0. 000). Conclusion: It appears that overactive bladder symptoms do not predict detrusor <b>over</b> <b>activity.</b> Urodynamic investigation is not mandatory in the initial management of women with only OAB symptoms...|$|E
