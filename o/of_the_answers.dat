It is addressed to Eratosthenes and the mathematicians in Alexandria. Archimedes challenges them to count the numbers of cattle in the Herd of the Sun by solving a number of simultaneous Diophantine equations.

5|$|Ever since Joseph Merrick's days as {{a novelty}} exhibit on Whitechapel Road, his {{condition}} {{has been a source}} of curiosity for medical professionals. His appearance at the meeting of the Pathological Society of London in 1884 drew interest from the doctors present, but none <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>answers</b> nor the attention that Treves had hoped for. The case received only a brief mention in the British Medical Journal, and the Lancet declined to mention it at all. Four months later, in 1885, Treves brought the case before the meeting for a second time. By then, Tom Norman's shop on Whitechapel Road had been closed, and the Elephant Man had moved on. Without Merrick, Treves made do with the photographs he had taken during his examinations. One of the doctors present at the meeting was Henry Radcliffe Crocker, a dermatologist who was an authority on skin diseases. After hearing Treves's description of Merrick, and viewing the photographs, Crocker proposed that Merrick's condition might be a combination of dermatolysis, pachydermatocele and an unnamed bone deformity, all caused by changes in the nervous system. Crocker wrote about Merrick's case in his 1888 book Diseases of the Skin: their Description, Pathology, Diagnosis and Treatment.|$|E

The group was known as the Forum, and was formalized as a closed group of 30 members in 1925 who pledged not to discuss the material with others. Over time, some participants left and others joined, leading to a total membership of 486 people over the years from diverse backgrounds and a mix of interest levels. A smaller group of five individuals called the Contact Commission, including the Sadlers, was responsible for gathering the questions from the Forum, acting as the custodians of the handwritten manuscripts that were presented as answers, and arranging for proofreading and typing of the material. Bill Sadler, Jr. is noted to have composed the table of contents that is published with the book.|$|E

25|$|As the {{deadline}} nears, the LBA executives begin to panic and lash out, {{resulting in a}} contradictory sequence where Wolfe is fired and then rehired within a span of minutes. When all seems lost, however, an anonymous source sends copies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>answers</b> {{to each of the}} contestants, thus voiding the contest and saving LBA. Although Archie, the LBA executives and the police suspect Wolfe of doing so, he insists that he was not responsible, and begins to suspect one of the advertising executives of at least stealing the wallet, if not murdering Dahlmann. After the letters are sent, Vernon Assa approaches Wolfe and attempts to unilaterally dismiss him from the case, but Wolfe refuses. His suspicions aroused, Wolfe summons the major players to his office and claims he will reveal the identity of the thief, and in doing so provide the police with vital information to help them identify the murderer. Before he can do so, however, Vernon Assa is poisoned with cyanide surreptitiously slipped into his drink and dies on the floor of Wolfe's office. Dahlmann's wallet is found in his pocket, suggesting that he was the thief and murderer.|$|E
25|$|Kilgore {{refused to}} debate Russ Potts, a {{decision}} which columnist Barnie Day said could strengthen Potts' underdog appeal {{and was a}} poor decision by Kilgore. It is unclear whether this had any effect on the election's outcome. Russ Potts polled 9% in a Mason-Dixon poll, but then dropped to 6% in a September poll. He needed to poll 15% in two separate polls to qualify {{for participation in the}} October Kaine-Kilgore debate. This poll was taken before Potts' TV ads ran. Although Potts was excluded from the final debate, he agreed to be sequestered in an office at Richmond's WTVR-TV during Sunday evening's debate and was not allowed to hear any of the questions nor any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>answers</b> offered by his opponents. Minutes after the debate ended, Potts was taken into WTVR-TV studios where the station played back the debate in real time and recorded Potts' answers to each of the debate questions. WTVR-TV announced plans to air key segments of the 'virtual debate' on seven consecutive nights at 11 p.m., beginning Sunday October 16 through Saturday October 22. Each segment focuses on one or two debate topics and presented the complete, timed answers from Mr. Kaine, Mr. Kilgore and Mr. Potts.

500|$|Punishment {{for minor}} crimes {{involved}} either imposition of fines, beatings, facial mutilation, or exile, {{depending on the}} severity of the offense. Serious crimes such as murder and tomb robbery were punished by execution, carried out by decapitation, drowning, or impaling the criminal on a stake. Punishment could also be extended to the criminal's family. Beginning in the New Kingdom, oracles {{played a major role in}} the legal system, dispensing justice in both civil and criminal cases.

Rachel Tarley, writing for Metro, praising the [...] "gripping race" [...] against time and noting that the script was [...] "snappy and witty throughout, but the episode had its eerie and touching moments where necessary, too".

50|$|Division in the Trachtenberg System is {{done much}} the same as in {{multiplication}} but with subtraction instead <b>of</b> addition. Splitting <b>the</b> dividend into smaller Partial Dividends, then dividing this Partial Dividend by only <b>the</b> left-most digit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> divisor will provide <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> one digit at a time. As you solve each digit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> you then subtract Product Pairs (UT pairs) and also NT pairs (Number-Tens) from the Partial Dividend to find the next Partial Dividend. The Product Pairs are found between <b>the</b> digits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> so far and the divisor. If a subtraction results in a negative number you have to back up one digit and reduce that digit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> by one.

500|$|Her Story is an {{interactive}} movie game, {{focusing on a}} series of seven fictional police interviews from 1994. As the game begins, players are presented with an old desktop, which contains several files and programs. Among the programs are instructional text files, which explain the game's mechanics. One of the programs automatically open on the desktop is the [...] "L.O.G.I.C. Database", which allows players to search and sort video clips within the database, of which there are 271. The video clips are police interviews with Hannah Smith, a British woman. The interviews are unable to be watched in their entirety, forcing players to view short clips. In the interviews, Hannah answers unknown questions to an off-screen detective, prompting players to decipher the context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>answers.</b> Hannah's answers are transcribed, and players find clips by searching in the database for words from the transcriptions, attempting to solve the case by piecing together information. As players select clips, they can enter user tags, which are then available as searchable terms. One of the files on the desktop is a database checker, which allows players to review the amount of clips that have been viewed; as a clip is viewed, the red box in the database checker changes to green. The desktop also features the minigame Mirror Game, based on the strategy board game Reversi.|$|E

Nimoy returned as Dr. Bell for an extended arc, and according to Orci, Bell is [...] "the beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>answers</b> to even bigger questions." [...] Nimoy reprised his role in the second-season finale, where his character and Walter met for a [...] "showdown". Nimoy's character is apparently dead after the season finale, having used himself to help Walter, Peter and the Alternate Olivia back to the prime universe. As he had retired from acting, it was thought unlikely that his character would return. [...] In February 2011 however, he announced his definite plan to return to Fringe and reprise his role as William Bell. He returned to voice the character in the animated segments of the third-season episode [...] "Lysergic Acid Diethylamide", and appeared as a computer-generated character in the fourth-season episode [...] "Letters of Transit".
