The accelerator model have since become very common and widely spread {{and they are}} key organizations of any Startup ecosystem.

In many countries there are no limitations restricting general public from investing to startups, while there can still be other types of restrictions in place, like limiting the amount that companies can seek from investors. Due to positive development and growth of crowdfunding, many countries are actively updating their regulation in regards to crowdfunding.|$|E

Although its wide physical release was scheduled for July 17, Universal encouraged physical retailers to start selling it immediately after they receive shipments of the album.

500|$|In May 1997, Panavision {{announced}} it would be purchasing Visual Action Holdings PLC, a major film services group for $61m (£37.5m). The British-based company was formerly known as Samuelson Group PLC. The company operated three rental depots in the UK and was main agent for Panavision in France and Australia. It also had smaller rental operations in New Zealand, Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Crucially, it controlled three Panavision agencies in the US cities of Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas (acquired from Victor Duncan, Inc.). Panavision CEO William C Scott said, [...] "This transaction provides Panavision with a strong platform on which to grow the international side of <b>our</b> <b>business</b> and also completes our company-controlled distribution system in the US.

Overall, the transaction enables us to control a true worldwide distribution network for Panavision’s camera systems and related products, {{one of our most}} important strategic objectives." ...|$|E
500|$|Although the Giants were {{no longer}} the league's top draw by 1955, falling to ninth in {{attendance}} and being one of three teams which had decreased attendance compared to the previous season, the Maras were still financially secure enough to turn down an offer of one million dollars for the team. NFL commissioner Bert Bell had personally made the offer on behalf of an unidentified group of investors, and accorded to Bell the Maras responded, [...] "ootball is <b>our</b> <b>business</b> and we intend to remain in it." [...] The offer was the largest for a franchise in pro football up to that point. The investment group was reportedly enticed by the team's potential television revenue—at the time the Giants [...] "television-radio" [...] income led the league at $150,000 annually—and the 8,000,000 population of New York City from which it could draw.

500|$|Bryan {{continued}} with language evoking the Civil War, telling his audience that [...] "in this contest brother has been arrayed against brother, father against son." [...] By then, {{as he spoke}} in a sincere tone, his voice sounded clearly and loudly through the hall. He denied, however that the contest was personal; he bore no ill-will towards those who supported the gold standard. However, he stated, facing towards the gold delegates, [...] "when you come before us and tell us that we are about to disturb your business interests, we reply that you have disturbed <b>our</b> <b>business</b> interests by your course." [...] The gold men, during the address, paid close attention and showed their appreciation for Bryan's oratory. Bryan then defended the right of silver supporters to make their argument against opposition from gold men, who were associated with financial interests, especially in the East. Although his statements nominally responded to a point made by Russell, Bryan had thought of the argument the previous evening, and had not used it in earlier speeches. He always regarded it as the best point he made during the speech, and only the ending caused more reaction from his listeners: ...|$|E

500|$|For {{the next}} five years Playford was to remain a backbencher, and to involve himself {{relatively}} little in government matters. His speeches were short, but to the point, and, running against the norm, he often attacked the government itself when he saw fit. The historian Peter Howell said that Playford was [...] "an unusually insolent and disloyal backbencher, always concerned to cut a figure and ridicule his party's leader". A new member's maiden speech is traditionally heard politely without the interruption and heckling prevalent in Australian politics, but Playford's aggressive debut in parliament was not accorded this privilege as [...] "a casual visitor could have mistaken him" [...] for an opposition member. At one point, a visibly angry Premier Butler interjected after Playford attacked the members of the Employment Promotion Council. In his opening address, Playford individually mocked the bureaucrats who comprised various government bodies, and then condemned public transport monopolies, as well as declaring [...] "It is not <b>our</b> <b>business</b> to worry whether people go broke or not". This comment provoked interjections from both government and opposition members—in the midst of the Great Depression, Playford's unashamed and aggressive promotion of his unbridled laissez faire philosophy stood out amidst the increasing prevalence of government intervention.|$|E
500|$|On November 17, 2015, the Attorney General filed {{a request}} for a {{temporary}} injunction to force DraftKings and FanDuel to cease serving customers in the state of New York.

[...] Schneiderman also acknowledged that the two services had [...] "basic compliance issues" [...] (alluding to the inside information scandal), had associated themselves with gambling-oriented entities, and that DraftKings had accepted entry fees from users in states where it argued that DFS was illegal. The Attorney General also issued a subpoena for information from Yahoo! in regards to its own daily fantasy offerings. FanDuel stated that it would comply with the order and restrict participation by residents of New York, while DraftKings stated that it would continue to serve them, arguing that Schneiderman's decision was based on an [...] "incomplete understanding of the facts about how <b>our</b> <b>business</b> operates and a fundamental misinterpretation and misapplication of the law".|$|E
