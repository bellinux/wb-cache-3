Features of poisoning differ {{depending on whether the}} agent is an <b>organic</b> <b>compound</b> (one that contains carbon), or an inorganic one. Organic lead poisoning is now very rare, because countries across the world have phased out the use of organic lead compounds as gasoline additives, but such compounds are still used in industrial settings. Organic lead compounds, which cross the skin and respiratory tract easily, affect the central nervous system predominantly.|$|E

5|$|A vitamin is an <b>organic</b> <b>compound</b> and an {{essential}} nutrient that an organism requires in limited amounts. An organic chemical compound (or related set of compounds) {{is called a}} vitamin when the organism cannot synthesize the compound in sufficient quantities, {{and it must be}} obtained through the diet; thus, the term vitamin is conditional upon the circumstances and the particular organism. For example, ascorbic acid (one form of vitamin C) is a vitamin for humans, but not for most other animals. Vitamin D is essential only for people who do not have adequate skin exposure to sunlight, as ultraviolet light promotes synthesis in skin cells. Supplementation is important for the treatment of certain health problems, but there is little evidence of nutritional benefit when used by otherwise healthy people.|$|E

5|$|A vitamin is an <b>organic</b> <b>compound</b> {{needed in}} small {{quantities}} that cannot {{be made in}} cells. In human nutrition, most vitamins function as coenzymes after modification; for example, all water-soluble vitamins are phosphorylated or are coupled to nucleotides when they are used in cells. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), a derivative of vitamin B3 (niacin), is an important coenzyme {{that acts as a}} hydrogen acceptor. Hundreds of separate types of dehydrogenases remove electrons from their substrates and reduce NAD+ into NADH. This reduced form of the coenzyme is then a substrate for any of the reductases in the cell that need to reduce their substrates. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide exists in two related forms in the cell, NADH and NADPH. The NAD+/NADH form is more important in catabolic reactions, while NADP+/NADPH is used in anabolic reactions.|$|E
5|$|Acetic acid , {{systematically}} named {{ethanoic acid}} , is a colourless liquid <b>organic</b> <b>compound</b> with the chemical formula CH3COOH (also written as CH3CO2H or C2H4O2). When undiluted, {{it is sometimes}} called glacial acetic acid. Vinegar is roughly 3–9% acetic acid by volume, making acetic acid {{the main component of}} vinegar apart from water. Acetic acid has a distinctive sour taste and pungent smell. In addition to household vinegar, it is mainly produced as a precursor to polyvinyl acetate and cellulose acetate. It is classified as a weak acid since it only partially dissociates in solution, but concentrated acetic acid is corrosive and can attack the skin.|$|E
5|$|The lead analog of the {{simplest}} <b>organic</b> <b>compound,</b> methane, is plumbane. Plumbane may be obtained in a reaction between metallic lead and atomic hydrogen. Two simple derivatives, tetramethyllead and tetraethyllead, are the best-known organolead compounds. These compounds are relatively stable: tetraethyllead only starts to decompose if heated or if exposed to sunlight or ultraviolet light. (Tetraphenyllead is even more thermally stable, decomposing at 270°C.) With sodium metal, lead readily forms an equimolar alloy that reacts with alkyl halides to form organometallic compounds such as tetraethyllead. The oxidizing nature of many organolead compounds is usefully exploited: lead tetraacetate is an important laboratory reagent for oxidation in organic chemistry and tetraethyllead was once produced in larger quantities than any other organometallic compound. Other organolead compounds are less chemically stable. For many organic compounds, a lead analog does not exist.|$|E

5|$|Fish and {{shellfish}} {{have a natural}} tendency to concentrate mercury in their bodies, often {{in the form of}} methylmercury, a highly toxic <b>organic</b> <b>compound</b> of mercury. Species of fish that are high on the food chain, such as shark, swordfish, king mackerel, bluefin tuna, albacore tuna, and tilefish contain higher concentrations of mercury than others. As mercury and methylmercury are fat soluble, they primarily accumulate in the viscera, although they are also found throughout the muscle tissue. When this fish is consumed by a predator, the mercury level is accumulated. Since fish are less efficient at depurating than accumulating methylmercury, fish-tissue concentrations increase over time. Thus species that are high on the food chain amass body burdens of mercury that can be ten times higher than the species they consume. This process is called biomagnification. Mercury poisoning happened this way in Minamata, Japan, now called Minamata disease.|$|E
5|$|Mycena galopus is a {{saprobic}} fungus, {{and plays}} an important role in forest ecosystems as a decomposer of leaf litter. It has been estimated in the UK to account for a large portion of the decomposition of the autumn leaf litter in British woodlands. It is able to break down the lignin and cellulose components of leaf litter. Grown in axenic culture in the laboratory, the fungus mycelium has been shown to degrade (in addition to lignin and cellulose) hemicelluloses, protein, soluble carbohydrates, and purified xylan and pectin using enzymes such as polyphenol oxidases, cellulases, and catalase. It is particularly adept at breaking down lignin, which is the second most abundant renewable <b>organic</b> <b>compound</b> in the biosphere, after cellulose. Research also suggests that the fungus weathers soil minerals, making them more available to mycorrhizal plants. Phosphorus, an important macronutrient influencing plant growth, typically occurs in primary minerals like apatite, or other organic complexes, and its low solubility often results in low phosphorus availability in soil. The biological activity of M.galopus mycelium can increase the availability of phosphorus and other nutrients, both as a result of soil acidification due to cation uptake and via the release of weathering agents such low molecular mass organic acids. Studies have shown that the fungus is sensitive to low concentrations of sulphite (SO32−), a byproduct of sulphur dioxide pollution, suggesting that this pollution can be toxic to the growth of the fungus (and the subsequent decomposition of leaf litter) at environmentally relevant concentrations.|$|E

40|$|AIMS [...] To analyse {{the breath}} of {{patients}} with schizophrenia {{for the presence of}} abnormal volatile <b>organic</b> <b>compounds.</b> METHODS [...] A case comparison study was performed in two community hospitals in Staten Island, New York. Twenty five patients with schizophrenia, 26 patients with other psychiatric disorders, and 38 normal controls were studied. Alveolar breath samples were collected from all participants, and volatile <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> in the breath were assayed by gas chromatography with mass spectroscopy. Differences in the distribution of volatile <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> between the three groups were compared by computerised pattern recognition analysis. RESULTS [...] Forty eight different volatile <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> were observed in the breath samples. Three separate pattern recognition methods indicated an increased differentiation capability between the patients with schizophrenia and the other subjects. Pattern recognition category classification models using 11 of these volatile <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> identified the patients with schizophrenia with a sensitivity of 80. 0 % and a specificity of 61. 9 %. Volatile <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> in breath were not significantly affected by drug therapy, age, sex, smoking, diet, or race.

Comparison of Dutch and foreign levels of polychlorinated <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> in mother's milk, learned that values were similar.
