Another tropical species, Octopus apollyon, causes severe inflammation that can last for <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>month</b> even if treated correctly, and the bite of Octopus rubescens can cause necrosis that lasts longer than one month if untreated, and headaches and weakness persisting for up to a week even if treated.|$|E

5|$|Mollusc {{species can}} also {{represent}} hazards or pests for human activities. The {{bite of the}} blue-ringed octopus is often fatal, and that of Octopus apollyon causes inflammation that can last for <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>month.</b> Stings from a few species of large tropical cone shells can also kill, but their sophisticated, though easily produced, venoms have become important tools in neurological research. Schistosomiasis (also known as bilharzia, bilharziosis or snail fever) is transmitted to humans via water snail hosts, and affects about 200million people. Snails and slugs can also be serious agricultural pests, and accidental or deliberate introduction of some snail species into new environments has seriously damaged some ecosystems.|$|E
