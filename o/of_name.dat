40|$|This study {{presents}} the mythological function <b>of</b> <b>names</b> in Greek myths, emphasizing though {{that most of}} the observed functions are not typical in mythology in general. Names were collected from the general work “Görög mitológia [Greek Mythology]” (1977 / 1997) by KÁROLY KERÉNYI, a scholarly book paying attention even to the different versions of the myths, and, occasionally, from the popular work “Görög regék [Greek Tales]” (1976) by IMRE TRENCSÉNYI-WALDAPFEL. The research focuses rather on the overall mythological function <b>of</b> <b>names</b> and name types, and also on the interrelations <b>of</b> <b>names</b> than on the etymologies <b>of</b> <b>names.</b> Topics presented in the paper include the specific transitionary state <b>of</b> mythological <b>names</b> between common and proper nouns and the frequent changes between these two categories; the synonymity <b>of</b> <b>names</b> (e. g. in connection with the several <b>names</b> <b>of</b> a god); <b>names</b> compressing the storyline of a myth; the appearance <b>of</b> a new <b>name</b> as a linguistic manifestation of the change in one’s mythological role; pseudonyms as indicators of temporary mythological roles; and the magic function <b>of</b> <b>names...</b>|$|R

5|$|Commentators noted McCotter's lack <b>of</b> <b>name</b> {{recognition}} hindered {{his chances}} for nomination.

Thereafter, McCotter reportedly wrote a television pilot, which was released to the media prior to his resignation from Congress in July 2012 amid a fraud investigation surrounding his congressional re-election campaign.|$|E

The module was also equipped with biotechnology research equipment, including a small greenhouse for plant cultivation experiments which was equipped with a source of light and a feeding system, in addition to equipment for astronomical observations. The most obvious features of the module were the two Androgynous Peripheral Attach System (APAS-89) docking ports designed to be compatible with the Buran spacecraft. Although they were never used in a Buran docking, they were useful later during the Shuttle-Mir programme, providing a berthing location for US Space Shuttles.|$|E
5|$|The Itcha Range has had {{at least}} two forms of names {{throughout}} its history. It was originally named the Itcha Mountains as identified in the 1930 BC Gazetteer. This form <b>of</b> <b>name</b> remained official until March 13, 1947 when it was changed to its current form, Itcha Range, {{as part of an}} official government policy. Larger mountain ranges throughout British Columbia, such as the Coast Mountains, retained their gazetted names whereas smaller ones, especially ranges of larger groupings, were subjected to renaming. In more casual speech, the Itcha Range {{is referred to as the}} Itchas. The name Itcha is indigenous in origin, coming from the local Tsilhqot'in people.|$|E
5|$|Within the Eastern Pacific basin the <b>naming</b> <b>of</b> {{tropical}} cyclones {{started in}} 1960, with four sets <b>of</b> female <b>names</b> initially {{designed to be}} used consecutively before being repeated.

In 1977 after protests by various women's rights groups, NOAA made the decision to relinquish control over the name selection by allowing a regional committee of the WMO to select new sets <b>of</b> <b>names.</b> The WMO selected six lists <b>of</b> <b>names</b> which contained male names and rotated every six years. They also decided that the new lists <b>of</b> hurricane <b>name</b> would start to be used in 1978 which was a year earlier than the Atlantic.

5|$|Well-known {{paleontologist}} Barnum Brown {{recovered a}} duckbill skull in 1915 for the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH 5836) from the Red Deer River of Alberta, near Steveville. He described the specimen in 1916 {{as a new}} genus, Prosaurolophus. Brown's choice <b>of</b> <b>name</b> comes from a comparison to the genus Saurolophus, which he had described in 1912. Saurolophus had a similar but longer and more spike-like head crest. The skull had a damaged muzzle and was inadvertently reconstructed too long, but better remains were soon found that showed the true shape; one is a nearly complete skeleton and skull, described by William Parks in 1924. Twenty to twenty-five individuals are known for this species, including seven skulls with {{at least some of}} the rest of the skeleton.|$|E
5|$|After the Cardiff Bay Opera House {{project was}} rejected, {{a new project}} was {{conceived}} that included more than opera and was felt {{to be a better}} reflection of Welsh culture. The change <b>of</b> <b>name</b> symbolised this, but the project still had to overcome many hurdles. Funding from the Welsh Assembly and Millennium Commission took years to obtain. Cardiff Council had to buy the land after the previous owners, Grosvenor Waterside (Associated British Ports property division) threatened to build a retail centre there due to the delays. Further boosts were given by large donations from South African businessman Donald Gordon and a loan from the international bank, HSBC. The GB£20million donation from Donald Gordon was split evenly between the Royal Opera House and Wales Millennium Centre and was spread over five years. This {{is believed to be the}} largest single private donation ever made to the arts in the UK.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{was also}} part of the East Michigan Pike, {{designed}} to be a counterpart of the West Michigan Pike {{on the other side of}} the LP. The original route of the East Michigan Pike included a section along the coast of The Thumb between Bay City and Port Huron and used the same route as the Dixie Highway north of Bay City. Backers of this auto trail lost out in terms <b>of</b> <b>name</b> recognition to the Dixie Highway, relegating the East Michigan Pike to the list of failed auto trails. The southern part of what is now US23 in the state was {{also part of}} the auto trail craze. The Top of Michigan Trail was designated in 1917 from the state line north to the Bay City area, before turning inland along other roadways. The name faded from shortly after the time the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) assigned the first highway numbers in the state.|$|E

5|$|The next known king used {{a number}} <b>of</b> <b>name</b> variants, and is {{referred}} to by different name segments within and outside of Calakmul. A partial reading of his name is Yuknoom Took' K'awiil. He erected seven stelae to celebrate a calendrical event in 702 and is named at Dos Pilas in that year, presumably demonstrating that Dos Pilas was still a vassal of Calakmul. El Peru also continued as a vassal and Yuknoom Took' K'awiil installed a new king there at an unknown date. La Corona received a queen from Yuknoom Took'. Naranjo also remained loyal. Yuknoom Took' K'awiil commissioned seven more stelae to mark the k'atun-ending of 731. A new defeat {{at the hands of}} Tikal is evidenced by a sculpted altar at that city, probably dating to sometime between 733 and 736, depicting a bound lord from Calakmul and possibly names Yuknoom Took' K'awiil.|$|E
5|$|Having, in his view, perfected many of {{his ideas}} and designs for steam engines, Evans turned his {{attention}} once more to the commercial propagation of his inventions. His first steam engines had been constructed on an ad-hoc basis, often with improvised tools and workers, and he had relied heavily on blacksmiths and other metal-working shops in Philadelphia with little experience in the more precise metal-work required to build steam engines. In particular, Evans soon realized that unlike his milling machines of wood and leather he would need specialist skills, precision tools and a large foundry {{in order to build}} steam machines on a commercial basis. Thus, Evans constructed the Mars Works on a large site a few blocks north of his store in Philadelphia. The choice <b>of</b> <b>name,</b> after the Roman god of war, is thought to have been aspirational and a challenge to the Soho Foundry near Birmingham in the United Kingdom, famous for building the Watt and Boulton engines. Indeed, the completed Mars Works was {{one of the largest and}} best equipped outfits of its kind in the United States—by contemporary accounts it featured a substantial foundry, moldmaker's shop, blacksmith's shops, millstone maker, a steam engine works and a large steam engine of its own to grind materials and work wrought iron. With over thirty-five staff, the Mars Works produced a wide range of manufactures ranging from working steam engines to cast iron fittings, as well as milling and farming machines for Evans's now well-established agricultural clientele. Steam engine orders alone proved insufficient to support the extensive business costs; hence the works became highly experienced in producing all kinds of heavy machinery, contributing to Philadelphia's emergence as a leading center for such work in the 19th century. Indeed, the works even received military orders, casting naval cannons during the War of 1812. Evans also proved highly innovative in designing steam power solutions for his clients. In one example where the Mars Works was commissioned to build engines for wool processing factories in Middletown, Connecticut, Evans designed a network of accompanying pipes with radiators to heat the factory with engine exhaust.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis chapter {{provides}} a definition <b>of</b> <b>names</b> and {{a discussion of}} how the semantic-pragmatic properties <b>of</b> <b>names</b> determine their grammatical characteristics {{in a number of}} European and African languages.

First, the pragmatic-semantic concept <b>of</b> <b>names</b> is cross-linguistically applicable. It is distinct from language-specific grammatical categories <b>of</b> Proper <b>Names,</b> for which language-specific grammatical criteria should be adduced.
