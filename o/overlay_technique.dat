40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. The most significant {{result was the}} use of the temporal <b>overlay</b> <b>technique</b> where the computer was used to overlay ERTS- 1 data from three different dates (9 Oct., 14 Nov., 2 Dec.). The registration of MSS digital data from different dates was estimated to be accurate within one half resolution element. The temporal overlay capability provides a significant advance in machine-processing of MSS data. It is no longer essential to go through the tedious exercise of locating ground observation sites on the digital data from each ERTS- 1 overpass. Once the address of a ground observation site has been located on a digital tape from any ERTS- 1 overpass, the <b>overlay</b> <b>technique</b> can be used to locate the same address on a digital tape of MSS data from any other ERTS- 1 pass over the same area. The temporal <b>overlay</b> <b>technique</b> also adds a valuable dimension for identifying and mapping changes in vegetation, water, and other dynamic surface features...|$|E

40|$|The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) {{traditionally}} establishes {{and manages}} its sessions with centralized servers, {{which have been}} challenged by issues with TCP/IP networks right from its beginning, for instance, issues with NAT traversal or network congestions. On the other hand, there are peer-to-peer and <b>overlay</b> <b>techniques</b> that potentially can make SIP working better under various network conditions. Overlay networks can provide a good abstraction from the real network, thus hiding the presence of NATs. Some proposals on peer-to-peer SIP have been recently presented. While these proposals attempted to solve a subset of challenges faced by traditional SIP, such as removing the centralized SIP entities, there is {{to the best of}} our knowledge no single solution offering a comprehensive view of the peer-to-peer SIP architecture and operation. This paper presents a novel approach for a peer-to-peer SIP system, using <b>overlay</b> <b>techniques</b> for signalling and media transport in the Internet. This system is based on the Ambient Networks Service-Aware Transport Overlay (SATO) system. The proposed system replaces the traditional SIP proxy/registrar function with a distributed lookup mechanism, adding overlay functionality to the SIP signalling and to the RTP traffic. Moreover, different from previous proposals, our approach deliberately places media/packet relays into the SIP/RTP paths, which allows an efficient session management and media communication. ...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1977 A {{modified}} agar <b>overlay</b> <b>technique</b> for {{the preliminary}} screening of antibiotic producing Streptomyces spp. {{has been developed}} and compared to the routinely used shake flask method and the unmodified agar <b>overlay</b> <b>technique.</b> The percentage of isolates exhibiting antimicrobial activities {{was found to be}} greater in the modified <b>overlay</b> <b>technique.</b> Three types of inhibition were normally associated with the modified <b>overlay</b> <b>technique.</b> The first type included those plates of Streptomyces cultures with zones of inhibition not extending past the edges of the colonies of the Streptomyces (inhibition was just over the antibiotic producing organism). The second type showed inhibition zones which did extend past the edges of the Streptomyces colonies but did not show a steady and progressive increase of the zone of inhibition with time. The third type were those plates of Streptomyces isolates which demonstrated inhibition zones between the antibiotic producing organisms and the test organisms with the zones of inhibition increasing steadily and markedly with the time of assay. Antibiotics could not be extracted from types 1 and 2 but could always be extracted from type 3. It was shown that the antibiotics extracted after 2 days of culture growth from the modified overlay plates were of a much higher concentration than those from the shake flask cultures or unmodified overlays extracted at 2 days also. Antibiotics of crude concentrates from the cultivation medium of 38 cultures isolated from three different acidic soils were classified by a systematic paper chromatographic analysis. There were 51 antibiotics which could be classified according to this scheme, and no new classes or subclasses were found...|$|E
30|$|It is {{intuitive}} that D 2 D communications under 3 GPP mode- 1 category shall {{result in}} severe interference if CUEs and DUEs are {{operating on the}} same frequency band. This so-called underlay technique requires a systematic frequency reuse strategy {{in order to prove}} beneficial [3, 10]. The other technique that allows CUEs and DUEs to coexist within a cell is the <b>overlay</b> <b>technique.</b> The <b>overlay</b> <b>technique</b> splits the frequency band allocated to a cell and distributes it among the CUEs and DUEs. In the overlay mode, CUEs and DUEs operate at two different frequency sub-bands. While the <b>overlay</b> <b>technique</b> works best in reducing interference, it results in the underutilization of the frequency resource [3, 10]. Almost all previous works on D 2 D communications prioritize the underlay technique because it can accommodate more UEs on a given frequency band. In order to ensure that interference is avoided in the underlay technique, various previous works have focused on proposing techniques that (i) intelligently allocate frequency resources to CUEs and DUE [11] and (ii) smartly control the transmit power of CUEs and DUEs [12]. This paper focuses on proposing a combined method that allows CUEs and DUEs to exist on the same frequency band in a typical LTE-A network.|$|E

Using GTP <b>overlay</b> <b>techniques</b> and direct micro sequencing we analyzed the association of small GTP-binding proteins with synaptic vesicles.

Moreover, direct amino acid sequence analysis assigned at least three different small GTP-binding proteins, ora 3, o-ral and o-rab 3, to the vesicular compartment. Furthermore, the data reflect the relative abundance of these three proteins on the vesicle membrane, thereby demonstrating the predominant occurrence of o-rab 3, the only exclusively synaptic vesicle specific small GTP-binding protein...|$|R
