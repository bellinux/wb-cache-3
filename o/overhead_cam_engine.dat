25|$|The biggest {{downside}} to the 200B was the noise the driver {{would have to}} endure. The 2-litre <b>overhead</b> <b>cam</b> <b>engine</b> could be very loud when pushed up through the rev range, and {{to make matters worse}} there was always plenty of drive line vibration. These issues prompted an exhaustive correction programme to be undertaken by the parent company in Japan, and thankfully later models were somewhat improved.|$|E
25|$|The Halberstadt D.III {{primarily}} {{differed from}} the D.II version in its substitution of the Argus As.II 90kW (120hp) straight-six engine, which {{differed from the}} usual Mercedes D.II powerplant in having its camshaft in the engine block and using pushrods to operate the overhead valves, rather than having a camshaft running atop all of the cylinders as in a single <b>overhead</b> <b>cam</b> <b>engine.</b> A total of 50 D.III examples were built by Halberstadt, with the first 30 ordered in July 1916 and the last 20 ordered in August 1916.|$|E
25|$|The more {{powerful}} 6C 1750 (1752cc actual) {{was introduced in}} 1929 in Rome. The car featured {{a top speed of}} 95mph, a chassis designed to flex and undulate over wavy surfaces, as well as sensitive geared-up steering. It was produced in six series between 1929 and 1933. Base model had a single overhead cam; Super Sport and Gran Sport versions had double <b>overhead</b> <b>cam</b> <b>engine</b> (DOHC). Again, a supercharger was available. Most of the cars were sold as rolling chassis and bodied by coachbuilders such as Zagato, and Touring. Additionally, there were 3 examples built with James Young bodywork, one of which {{is a part of the}} permanent collection at the Simeone Foundation Automotive Museum in Philadelphia, PA, USA in original, unrestored condition.|$|E
5000|$|A {{short block}} is an engine {{sub-assembly}} comprising {{the portion of}} the cylinder block below the head gasket but above the oil pan. An in-block <b>cam</b> <b>engine</b> includes the camshaft, timing gear, and any balance shafts. <b>Overhead</b> <b>cam</b> <b>engines</b> don't include those parts.|$|R
50|$|Rocker covers are covers {{that are}} bolted on over rocker arms in an {{internal}} combustion engine. They are called valve covers in the United States, Canada, and {{in situations where}} Rocker Arms are not present, such as some <b>Overhead</b> <b>Cam,</b> and most Dual <b>Overhead</b> <b>Cam</b> <b>engines.</b> and rocker boxes in the United Kingdom.|$|R
50|$|The SX line {{incorporates}} many of {{the same}} technology features as other Subaru industrial engines; most notable is <b>Overhead</b> <b>Cam</b> (OHC) technology. <b>Overhead</b> <b>Cam</b> technology has been proven to enhance engine performance. The technology allows the intake and exhaust valves being positioned for optimum engine performance, which offers lower resistance for the air/fuel mixture flow. <b>Overhead</b> <b>Cam</b> <b>engines</b> also have fewer moving parts and produce less mechanical noise than competitive technologies.|$|R
2500|$|Introduced in 1938, the 2500 (2443cc) was {{the last}} 6C road car. World War II was coming and car {{development}} was stopped, but a few hundred 6C 2500s were built from 1940 to 1945. Postwar, the first new Alfa model was the 1946 6C 2500 Freccia d'Oro (Golden Arrow), of which 680 were built through 1951, with bodies by Alfa. The 2500 had enlarged engine compared to the predecessor model, this Vittorio Jano designed double <b>overhead</b> <b>cam</b> <b>engine</b> was available either one or three Weber carburetors. The triple carburetor version {{was used in the}} top of line SS (Super Sport) version. The 2443 cc engine was mounted to a steel ladder frame chassis, which was offered with three wheelbase lengths: [...] on the Turismo, [...] on the Sport and [...] on the Super Sport. Various coachbuilders made their own versions of the 2500, but most of the bodyworks was made by Touring of Milan.|$|E
50|$|Ernest Henry left Peugeot in February 1915, {{replaced}} by the engineer Marcel Grémillon who developed a 1-liter, five valve per cylinder, triple <b>overhead</b> <b>cam</b> <b>engine</b> in 1920-1921.|$|E
50|$|The Honda CB450 was {{the first}} 'big' Honda {{motorcycle}} with a 444cc 180° straight twin, dual <b>overhead</b> <b>cam</b> <b>engine</b> producing 43-45 horsepower (more than 100 HP/ litre).|$|E
50|$|The hemi head {{always has}} {{intake and exhaust}} valve stems that point in {{different}} directions, requiring a large, wide cylinder head and complex rocker arm geometry in both cam-in-block and <b>overhead</b> <b>cam</b> <b>engines.</b> This adds to the overall width of the engine, limiting the vehicles in which it can be installed.|$|R
50|$|Roller rockers {{can also}} be used in <b>overhead</b> <b>cam</b> <b>engines.</b> However, OHC roller rockers {{generally}} have the roller {{at the point where the}} cam lobe contacts the rocker rather than at the point where the rocker contacts the valve stem. This helps to reduce cam lobe friction and wear in the same way as roller lifters on pushrod engines.|$|R
50|$|TMAX {{designers}} chose a novel engine configuration: a water-cooled four-stroke horizontal straight-twin (both cylinders pointing forward) {{with four}} valves per cylinder operated by dual <b>overhead</b> <b>cams.</b> <b>Engine</b> vibrations were offset {{not by a}} balance shaft but by reciprocating balancer (i.e., a third 'dummy' piston driven from a central crankpin). By comparison, transmission design was the norm for scooters: a twist-and-go automatic transmission.|$|R

50|$|Some <b>overhead</b> <b>cam</b> <b>engines</b> employ short {{rocker arms}} {{in which the}} cam lobe pushes down (rather than up) on the rocker arm to open the valve. On this type of rocker arm, the fulcrum {{is at the end}} rather than the middle, while the cam acts on the middle of the arm. The {{opposite}} end opens the valve. These types of rocker arms are particularly common on dual <b>overhead</b> <b>cam</b> motors, and are often used instead of direct tappets.|$|R

50|$|This line is Subaru’s {{first to}} utilize {{chain-driven}} <b>overhead</b> <b>cam</b> (OHC) technology, {{and the first}} to utilize OHC technology in the industrial air-cooled small engine market.

50|$|The <b>overhead</b> <b>cam</b> <b>engines</b> were {{upgraded}} {{in early}} 1972, the 1.6 becoming a 1.8 (1759 cc) and the 2.0 (1975 cc) twin carburettor became a 2.3 (2279 cc). At this time, the Viva 2300 SL and Firenza Sport SL {{did away with}} the letter-box speedometer and substituted an attractive seven-dial instrument pack. Firenza SLs had a two round-dial pack, though all other Vivas and Firenzas stuck with the original presentation.|$|R

50|$|The next year, 1971, the Series was revamped {{and became}} the Radial Sedan Series with the revolutionary {{innovation}} of requiring DOT radial tires.
