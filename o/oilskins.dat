25|$|Early {{in the war}} Philips and {{his crew}} had become {{dissatisfied}} with the conventional garb of <b>oilskins</b> and designed a special form of clothing more suitable for submarines. Ursula's navigating officer, Lt Lakin, was a keen motorcyclist and wore a one-piece waxed cotton motorcycling suit made by Barbour. Philips asked the company to adapt the suit, splitting it into jacket and trousers and adding a hood. The suit became standard watch-keeping clothing in Royal Navy submarines.|$|E
500|$|The Eagle {{had been}} stocked with safety {{equipment}} such as guns, snowshoes, sleds, skis, a tent, a small boat (in {{the form of a}} bundle of bent sticks, to be assembled and covered with balloon silk), most of it stored not in the basket but in the storage space arranged above the balloon ring. These items had not been put together with great care, or with any acknowledgement of adopting indigenous peoples' techniques for dealing with the extreme environment. In this, Andrée contrasted not only with later but also with many earlier explorers. Sven Lundström points to the agonizing extra efforts that became necessary for the team due to Andrée's mistaken design of the sleds, with a rigid construction that borrowed nothing from the long proven Inuit sleds, and were so impractical for the difficult terrain. Andrée called it [...] "dreadful terrain", with channels separating the ice floes, high ridges, and partially iced-over melt ponds. The men's clothes included no furs but were woollen coats and trousers, plus <b>oilskins.</b> They wore the <b>oilskins</b> but the explorers reported always seeming to be damp or wet from the half-frozen pools of water on the ice and the typically foggy, humid Arctic summer air, and preoccupied with drying their clothes, mainly by wearing them. Danger was everywhere, as it would have meant certain death to lose the provisions lashed to one of the inconvenient sleds into one of the many channels that had to be laboriously crossed.|$|E
500|$|A tension {{remained}} between uniforms {{which were}} perceived as smart, reflecting the force's military heritage, and practical uniforms which were suitable for the daily work of the police. The mounted police's white helmets, forage caps and tight tunics were impractical for work on the plains, {{and a set of}} clothes termed [...] "prairie dress" [...] instead evolved unofficially, becoming the dominant style of uniform in the force by 1900. Prairie dress typically included a buckskin jacket, <b>oilskins</b> for wet weather, and leather leggings, combined with a wide-brimmed felt hat: by late 1890s, the Stetson was the headgear of choice. A standardised form of prairie dress, called patrol dress, was formalised in time for the 1897 Jubilee celebrations, featuring a brown duck stable jacket. By the turn of the century, many police were wearing a combination of a red serge tunic, cut to resemble the prairie dress tunic, and the Stetson hat, a combination which later became famous.|$|E

2500|$|Using {{their life}} savings, an 18-foot ship-lap (clinker-built) oak rowboat was built with {{water-resistant}} cedar sheathing {{with a couple}} of watertight flotation compartments and two rowing benches. The boat was fitted with rails to help them right it if capsized, a feature that saved their lives in mid-ocean. The boat was carrying American flags and was named [...] "Fox" [...] in honor of the editor. With a compass, a sextant, a copy of the Nautical Almanac, <b>oilskins</b> and three sets of oars lashed safely in place, they set out from The Battery in New York City June 6, 1896, and arrived 55 days later in the Isles of Scilly off the southwestern tip of the [...] Cornish peninsula [...] of Great Britain.|$|E

50|$|An <b>oilskin</b> is a {{waterproof}} garment, typically worn by sailors and by others in wet areas, such as fish-plant workers. The modern <b>oilskin</b> garment {{was developed by}} an Australian, Edward Le Roy, in 1898. Le Roy used worn-out sailcloth painted {{with a mixture of}} linseed oil and wax to produce {{a waterproof}}, yet still breathable garment suitable to be worn on deck in foul-weather conditions.|$|R
50|$|Some <b>oilskin</b> jackets {{include a}} {{built-in}} harness, typically a strap around the chest to clip into a lifeline. While convenient, {{this is not}} nearly as safe as a separate multi-point harness, often provided with an integrated lifejacket. Some models of high-end <b>oilskin</b> jackets contain flotation and may also function as lifejackets; survival equipment such as lights, flares, and EPIRB are also available as integrated accessories.|$|R

Also, the pipe did much to restore the old sailor's composure, after his long ducking and his terrible fright--a fright that was more on Trot's account than his own.|$|R
