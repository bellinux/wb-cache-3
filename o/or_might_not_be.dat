25|$|While a principle-based {{approach}} might {{claim that}} lying is always morally wrong, the casuist would argue that, {{depending upon the}} details of the case, lying might <b>or</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> illegal or unethical. The casuist might conclude that a person is wrong to lie in legal testimony under oath, but might argue that lying actually is the best moral choice if the lie saves a life. (Thomas Sanchez and others thus theorized a doctrine of mental reservation, which developed into its own branch of casuistry.) For the casuist, the circumstances of a case are essential for evaluating the proper response.|$|E
25|$|Both Suther and Régine Tessier, {{the latter}} in a sketch of Sage in Notable American Women: The Modern Period, note key {{features}} of Sage’s mature work. Most of Sage’s paintings focus on free-standing architectural structures, including walls, towers, and latticework, which could represent buildings either under construction or ruined and decaying. Some contain figures that might <b>or</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> human, hidden by flowing drapery. (Le Passage, one of Sage’s last paintings, is perhaps the only one containing a definite human figure; even Small Portrait, thought {{by many to be}} a self-portrait, is hardly recognizable as a face.) Like Tanguy, Sage often sets her objects on deserts or plains that recede to immeasurably distant horizons. She renders her forms in meticulous, photographic detail, using a gray-green-ochre palette that Tessier describes as “reminiscent of the sulphurous light before a thunderstorm”. Critics frequently called Sage’s work disturbing or depressing, even when they praised her painterly skill.|$|E

500|$|However, modern {{translations}} make {{it clear}} that Laing was using the nursery rhyme as a model for his very free translation, and the reference to London Bridge does not appear {{at the start of the}} verse and it is unlikely that this is an earlier version of the nursery rhyme. Some historians have raised the possibility that the attack never took place. However, the original document detailing the attack was written only about 100 years after what would be a famous event in a highly populated area, leading the majority of historians to conclude that the account is at least relatively accurate. While it might <b>or</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> the origin of the rhyme, this would make King Olaf's victory the only historically recorded incidence of london bridge [...] "falling down." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Greek Septuagint {{and some}} later Christian translations, {{following}} {{the application of}} Isaiah 7 in Matthew 1, use the word [...] "virgin". The Hebrew word alma actually translates {{as a young woman}} of childbearing age who had not yet given birth and who might <b>or</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> a virgin, whereas the Hebrew betulah, used elsewhere in Isaiah, is the word that means [...] "virgin." [...] If the referent is to Ahaz's betrothed, Abi, daughter of the High Priest, no miraculous birth is implied, merely chastity. The Christian world believes that the verse is a messianic prediction of the miraculous birth of Jesus, as described in various gospels of the New Testament of the Bible.|$|E
2500|$|A sub-adult whale {{that stayed}} in the Ise and Mikawa Bay for nearly two months in 2012 was later {{confirmed}} {{to be the same}} individual as the small whale observed off Tahara near Cape Irago in 2010, making it the first confirmed constant migration out of Russian waters.

The Ise and Mikawa Bay region is the only location along Japanese coasts that has several records since the 1980s (a mortal entanglement in 1968, above mentioned short-stay in 1982, self-freeing entanglement in 2005), and is also the location where the first commercial whaling started.

2500|$|The Stugotz Pregame Show — {{beginning}} the TV simulcast, Stugotz gets {{a minute or}} so to vent about something that might <b>or</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> brought up during the main show. During football season on Fridays, Stugotz uses the pregame show to make his weekend picks.

Previously, when the show's final hour aired on ESPN2, a segment titled ESPN Dos Minutos would air, where Stugotz and Mike Ryan would review the show, but Dos Minutos ended when ESPNU re-gained the final hour of the show. Because of a difference in commercial lengths between the TV simulcast and radio show, the TV simulcast typically airs flashback moments or highlights from the local hour at the return from commercials.|$|E

2500|$|The {{platform}} {{on which}} the temple sat was typically raised higher in Etruscan and Roman examples than Greek, with up to ten, twelve or more steps rather than the three typical in Greek temples; the Temple of Claudius was raised twenty steps. These steps were normally only at the front, and typically not the whole width of that. [...] It might <b>or</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> possible {{to walk around the}} temple exterior inside (Temple of Hadrian) or outside the colonnade, or at least down the sides. The description of the Greek models used here is a generalization of classical Greek ideals, and later Hellenistic buildings often do not reflect them. [...] For example, the [...] "Temple of Dionysus" [...] on the terrace by the theatre at Pergamon (Ionic, 2nd century BC, on a hillside), had many steps in front, and no columns beyond the portico. [...] The Parthenon, also approached up a hill, probably had many wide steps at the approach to the main front, followed by a flat area before the final few steps.|$|E
2500|$|The {{album was}} written and rehearsed at David Bowie's home in Haddon Hall, Beckenham, an Edwardian mansion {{converted}} to a block of flats that was described by one visitor as having an ambiance [...] "like Dracula's living room". As Bowie was preoccupied with his new wife Angie at the time, the music was largely arranged by guitarist Mick Ronson and bassist/producer Tony Visconti. Although Bowie is officially credited as the composer of all music on the album, biographer Peter Doggett quoted Visconti saying [...] "the songs were written by all four of us. We'd jam in a basement, and Bowie would just say whether he liked them or not." [...] In Doggett's narrative, [...] "The band (sometimes with Bowie contributing guitar, sometimes not) would record an instrumental track, which might <b>or</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> based upon an original Bowie idea. Then, at the last possible moment, Bowie would reluctantly uncurl himself from the sofa on which he was lounging with his wife, and dash off a set of lyrics." [...] Despite his annoyance with Bowie's fixation on married life during the recording of The Man Who Sold the World, Visconti still rated it as his best work with Bowie until 1980's Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps).|$|E
2500|$|No Isis album {{contains}} an explicit , or story arc, instead focusing on themes rather than stories. As such, releases {{are defined by}} some as [...] "pseudo-concept albums". The band see lyrics as important, {{but at the same}} time, Turner does not feel it necessary to enunciate every word. Instead, any connections made are mainly conjecture, and the formation of a theme takes into account the album artwork, previous albums, track titles and the use of metaphor just as much as lyricism. Oceanic tells a convoluted tale involving love, incest and suicide by drowning. This relates to the theme of the all-powerful female, present lyrically in every album except Panopticon. Turner does not explicitly acknowledge an [...] "overtly feminine theme"; however, he does state: [...] "I just think it's interesting to include that as part of what we do, simply because metal, especially, is considered to be this very male-oriented, testosterone-driven art form, and I feel like it's important to recognize the other side of our nature. As manly as we might <b>or</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be,</b> we have to acknowledge that there is a feminine part of our persona, and that the world isn't made up of absolutes. To achieve balance, you have to recognize every facet of yourself and everyone else around you." [...] Certain threads do reappear between albums, notes Turner. [...] "There are certain themes which reoccur in my work just because of what I'm interested in and what is aesthetically pleasing for me", he says. [...] "The idea of futuristic utopias and dystopias is probably something that does consciously and subconsciously return time and time again [...] and sometimes I just can't help the fact that these themes creep into my work whether it's conscious or not". The other two ongoing motifs in the lyrics and artwork are that of towers and mosquitos.|$|E
