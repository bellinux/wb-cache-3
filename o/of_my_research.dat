5000|$|According to Watts: [...] The {{main focus}} <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>research</b> {{has been to}} use {{geological}} and geophysical techniques to study the Earth's crust and upper mantle beneath the world's ocean basins and their margins. ... By comparing observations {{of the structure of}} oceanic islands and passive margins to predictions of simple thermal and mechanical models, constraints have been placed on the response of the oceanic crust and upper mantle to long-term (i.e. > 106 years) geological loads. Results show that the oceanic crust and upper mantle is capable of supporting volcanic and sediment loads for long periods of geological time by flexing over broad regions of the ocean floor. A major part <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>research</b> has been to quantitatively understand the phenomena of flexure, how it depends on load and plate age, and how it contributes to the gravity and geoid, the crustal structure and, the stratigraphic patterns that develop in sedimentary basins. Current research is focused on better understanding the role of flexure in the geological development of continental margin basins, the growth and decay of oceanic islands, the structural styles that develop in mountain belts, and landscape evolution.|$|E
