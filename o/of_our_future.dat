25|$|Let us admit, in any case, {{that among}} us now – if mostly still hidden – are many {{or all of}} the seeds <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>future</b> art, and not in museums overseas, and not in the homes of famous foreign dealers. Let us honor the rare ones, our rebellious spirits who, like this artist, before denying others, find {{affirmation}} in themselves; that instead of destroying, seek to build. Let us honor those who struggle so that the soul of our country can be more beautiful.|$|E
25|$|The Wi-wanyang-wa-c'i-pi (Sundance Ceremony): The only {{participants}} {{allowed in}} the center will be Native People. The non-Native {{people need to understand}} and respect our decision. If there have been any unfinished commitments to the sundance and non-Natives have concern for this decision; they must understand that we have been guided through prayer to reach this resolution. Our purpose for the sundance is for the survival of the future generations to come, first and foremost. If the non-Natives truly understand this purpose, they will also understand this decision and know that by their departure from this Ho-c'o-ka (our sacred altar) is their sincere contribution to the survival <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>future</b> generations.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} avoid bloodshed“, I advise you to spare your {{soldiers}} not force us to fight, {{and go back to}} where you bad and evil strangers were and leave us alone: we will resolutely and fiercely defend this place and fight you to death for the land of our ancestors and for the welfare <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>future</b> generations. Have pity on people and cease to destroy them: we did not give life to anyone nor do {{we have the right to}} take it away from others: but because you shall not send your soldiers to a certain death, since we are not to surrender the fortress without a fierce and bitter resistance.|$|E
500|$|The title OK Computer {{is taken}} from the 1978 Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy radio series, in which the {{character}} Zaphod Beeblebrox speaks the phrase [...] "Okay, computer, I want full manual control now." [...] The members of Radiohead listened to the series on the bus during their 1996 tour and Yorke made a note of the phrase. [...] "OK Computer" [...] was a working title for the song [...] "Palo Alto", which had been considered for inclusion on the album. The title stuck with the band; according to Jonny Greenwood, [...] " [...] started attaching itself and creating all these weird resonances with {{what we were trying}} to do." [...] Yorke said it [...] "refers to embracing the future, it refers to being terrified of the future, <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>future,</b> of everyone else's. It's to do with standing in a room where all these appliances are going off and all these machines and computers and so on... and the sound it makes." [...] Yorke described the title as [...] "a really resigned, terrified phrase", to him similar to the Coca-Cola advertisement [...] "I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing". Wired writer Leander Kahney suggests that it is an homage to Macintosh computers, as the Mac's speech recognition software responds to the command [...] "OK computer" [...] as an alternative to clicking the [...] "OK" [...] button. Other titles considered were Ones and Zeroes—a reference to the binary numeral system—and Your Home May Be at Risk If You Do Not Keep Up Payments.|$|E

That's our future, not nuclear..." [...] per a Reuters report of 22 March 2011. Australia has no nuclear power stations.|$|E

40|$|This {{publication}} {{offers a}} précis {{of ideas and}} actions developed at the Fashioning the Future Summer School in July 2013 as part of Centre for Sustainable Fashion’s collaborative ventures into Fashion Design Education for Sustainability. The bringing together of researchers, tutors and students from locations across Europe, was made possible through shared ambitions in contributing to social and environmental equity through fashion’s design practices. The journeys undertaken through this work draw on theory, practice and togetherness, honoring distinction over consensus. These narratives learn from nature’s billions of years of practice and people brought together through the Erasmus Lifelong Learning Programme. They also learn from what we know <b>of</b> <b>our</b> present in terms <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>futures,</b> near and far...|$|R
