40|$|Introduction There {{are several}} studies with {{contradictory}} findings {{about the role}} of concha bullosa with predisposition to rhinosinusitis. This study was conducted to assess the relationship of <b>osteomeatal</b> unit blockage with concha bullosa. Materials and method A cross-sectional observational study by radiological assessment of prevalence of chronic rhinosinusitis and blockage of ipsilateral <b>osteomeatal</b> unit was done on 100 cases of concha bullosa detected on computed tomography to determine the prevalence of chronic rhinosinusitis in subjects with concha bullosa and to examine the latter’s relationship to <b>osteomeatal</b> unit blockage, which is a precursor for rhinosinusitis. Result One hundred cases of concha bullosa were studied in a total of 87 CT scan films depicting concha bullosa. Some CT scans showed unilateral concha bullosa while few scans showed bilateral concha bullosa. Ipsilateral rhinosinusitis was found in only 31 % of the sides in scans of subjects with concha bullosa. Of the total 100 concha bullosae studied, extensive type was the commonest followed by bulbous and lamellar variety. Discussion Although rhinosinusitis was more predominant in the extensive type of concha bullosa compared to other types, it was statistically not significant and there was no statistically significant association between any type of concha bullosa with ipsilateral rhinosinusitis either in right side or left side. Conclusion This study has found no statistically significant association between any type of concha bullosa with rhinosinusitis.

CT scans were checked for the presence of conchae bullosa and the degree of septal deviation. The severity of sinusitis was evaluated according to the Lund Mackay criteria. The frequency of patients with different degrees of SeD and different grades of chronic sinusitis were studied. Results Of 463 cases, 47 % had septal deviation. Concha bullosa was seen in 16. 8 % of the patients in the left side and 27. 6 % of them in the right side. There was no significant relationship between the presence of concha bullosa and the severity of sinusitis.

40|$|The aim of rhinosinusitis {{treatment}} is to restore sinusal eutrophism and to normalize ventilation and mucociliary transport. Frequently {{the improvement of}} sinusal physiological conditions {{is associated with a}} reduction of infections and pulmonary symptoms. The treatment of these diseases often requires the combination of medical and surgical strategies. In particular, the aim of the medical therapy is multiple: to treat the infection (with antibiotics), to reduce the mucosal swelling (with corticosteroids) and to improve mucus drainage (with mucolytics or muco-regulators). The use of atomized nasal douche, as a washing of the nasal fossas, is chosen because of its local action minimizing systemic adverse effects. The surgical {{treatment is}} secondary to medical failure, and it is focused on clearing the sinusal ostia in the sphenoethmoidal recess and the <b>osteomeatal</b> complex. In case of recurrent sinonasal diseases the importance of the surgical operation is represented {{by the fact that the}} medical treatment better reaches the target in the sinusal space. This study is focused on the primary medical treatment of acute recurrent rhinosinusitis. The patients who immediately needed surgical treatment were excluded from the study (because of the presence of an anatomical obstruction of the <b>osteomeatal</b> complex and/or the sphenoethmoidal recess, hence non-susceptible to improvement by medical therapy alone), and these patients were immediately addressed to undergo a CT scan examination in order to be involved in a future surgical programme. The medical treatment for those forms which do not require antibiotics (i. e. when infections are not involved), is based on the use of topical corticosteroids. While there are controversies on the real efficacy of adding mucolytic agents to the steroids, they are commonly prescribed in clinical practice, with the rationale of reducing viscosity and improving clearance of mucus in order to help the restoration of the physiological sinus conditions. The primary aim of the medical treatment is to reduce the number of acute episodes and thus to increase the time between the exacerbations, allowing a good quality of life without necessitating surgical procedure...|$|E

Methods: In the present retrospective and prospective study, we have studied anatomical variants of PNS in 200 Indian subjects with clinical suspicion of sinusitis between January 2011 to March 2016, using CT in the coronal plane complemented by axial views. Results: In majority of patients, anatomical variations were noted with mucosal changes (78. 80 %). Deviation of nasal septum were the most common anatomical variation followed by Paradoxical middle turbinate, Middle concha bullosa. Other common variants included superior concha bullosa, prominent agger nasi cells, Hallers cells, bony spurs, aerated crista galli and hypoplastic frontal sinus.

40|$|Functional {{endoscopic}} sinus {{surgery is}} a minimally invasive technique used to restore sinus ventilation and normal function. The most suitable candidates for this procedure have recurrent acute or chronic infective sinusitis, and {{an improvement in}} symptoms of up to 90 percent may be expected following the procedure. Fiberoptic telescopes are used for diagnosis and during the procedure, and computed tomography is {{used to assess the}} anatomy and identify diseased areas. Functional endoscopic sinus surgery should be reserved for use in patients in whom medical treatment has failed. The procedure can be performed under general or local anesthesia on an outpatient basis, and patients usually experience minimal discomfort. The complication rate for this procedure is lower than that for conventional sinus surgery. Functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) is a minimally invasive technique in which sinus air cells and sinus ostia are opened under direct visualization. The goal of this procedure is to restore sinus ventilation and normal function. The ability to treat paranasal sinus disease has been revolutionized by fiberoptic endoscopes and computed tomographic (CT) scanning. Fiberoptic endoscopes have made it possible to examine the nose thoroughly from the anterior nares to the postnasal space. The endoscopic procedure requires local anesthetic and may be performed in the office (Figures 1 through 3). The specific features that must be identified and assessed during the examination are the middle turbinate and the middle meatus (<b>osteomeatal</b> complex), anatomic obstruction, mucopus and nasal polyps (Figures 4 through 6) ...|$|E
40|$|Controversies exist {{regarding}} the resection or {{preservation of the}} middle turbinate (MT) during functional endoscopic sinus surgery. Any MT resection will perturb nasal airflow and may affect the mucociliary dynamics of the <b>osteomeatal</b> complex. Neither rhinometry nor computed tomography (CT) can adequately quantify nasal airflow pattern changes following surgery. This study explores the feasibility of assessing changes in nasal airflow dynamics following partial MT resection using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques. We retrospectively converted the pre- and postoperative CT scans of a patient who underwent isolated partial MT concha bullosa resection into anatomically accurate three-dimensional numerical nasal models. Pre- and postsurgery nasal airflow simulations showed that the partial MT resection resulted in a shift of regional airflow towards the area of MT removal with a resultant decreased airflow velocity, decreased wall shear stress and increased local air pressure. However, the resection did not strongly affect the overall nasal airflow patterns, flow distributions {{in other areas of}} the nose, nor the odorant uptake rate to the olfactory cleft mucosa. Moreover, CFD predicted the patient 2 ̆ 7 s failure to perceive an improvement in his unilateral nasal obstruction following surgery. Accordingly, CFD techniques can be used to predict changes in nasal airflow dynamics following partial MT resection. However, the functional implications of this analysis await further clinical studies. Nevertheless, such techniques may potentially provide a quantitative evaluation of surgical effectiveness and may prove useful in preoperatively modeling the effects of surgical interventions...|$|E
40|$|Sinusitis is {{the fifth}} common {{diagnosis}} for which an anti biotic is prescribed and about $ 2 billion is spent annually on medications to treat nasal and sinus problems. Diagnosis and treating sinusitis is therefore being very important. Acute bacterial sinusitis usually occurs following an upper respiratory infection that result in the obstruction of the <b>osteomeatal</b> complex, impaired mucociliary clearance and production of secretions (L. J. Fajan et al, 1989.) Acute sinusitis is a common illness in primary care. Studies have demonstrated the difficulty of making the differential diagnosis of acute purulent sinusitis based on clinical evaluations alone. This leads to a significant overuse of antibiotics, which in turn may contribute to increase bacterial resistance. (Morten Lindback. et al., 2002) Sinus disease is inherently associated with viral upper respiratory tract infections and occurs in 90 % of individuals with common cold. Although the diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis is usually based on physical findings, no one sign or symptom is either sensitive or specific for sinusitis. The predictive power can be significantly improved when all signs and symptoms is either sensitive or specific for sinusitis. (Martin Desrosiers. et al., 2002) There is solid evidence that a positive association between nasal allergy and acute or chronic sinusitis in both adult and children. (Shin- Wen Huang. et al., 2006 Acute sinusitis frequently follows upper respiratory tract infections. Sinusitis or an inflammation of one or mor...|$|E
30|$|Acute post-viral rhinosinusitis is a {{very common}} and {{economically}} important condition, involving inflammation of the nasal mucous membranes and paranasal sinuses [2, 3]. The principle symptoms are inflammation and mucosal oedema, primarily in the <b>osteomeatal</b> complex. The function of the mucociliary transport system is impaired {{against the background of}} increased production of pathologically altered mucus. These symptoms develop after the acute viral infection and can be considered as the next stage of development of the disease after acute viral sinusitis when the symptoms persist for more than 10  days. Antiviral treatment is ineffective. Saline irrigation proved efficient for improving the symptoms in randomized, placebo-controlled studies [10]. International and Ukrainian guidelines consider irrigation therapy as a relevant treatment to enable a better secret mobilization for all the forms of ARS. Because of these benefits, we used irrigation therapy in both groups as a component of the basic therapy with local activity. If there would be an impact of irrigation therapy, the impact can be assumed as similar in both groups, since the group parameters are comparable. Evaluated differences in severity of symptoms between the treatment groups can therefore be assumed {{to be related to the}} herbal medicine. An additional herbal medicine with multiple systematic activities could be useful in alleviating the symptoms of acute post- viral rhinosinusitis and might inhibit the transition to a bacterial infection. There is an extensive evidence from in vitro and animal studies that the complex herbal medicine Sinupret possesses a variety of such relevant activities.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Ectopic {{eruption}} of teeth in non-dental sites {{is a rare}} phenomenon and can present {{in a variety of}} ways such as chronic or recurrent sinusitis, sepsis, nasolacrimal duct obstruction, headaches, ostiomeatal complex disease and facial numbness. However, presentation of such patients with recurrent haemoptysis has not been described in the literature so far. We have described a case of an ectopic, supernumerary molar tooth in the maxillary antrum in a patient who initially presented with haemoptysis. Case presentation A 45 -year-old male presented with a 2 -month history of episodic haemoptysis. A pedunculated growth from the inferior nasal turbinate was seen with fibre-optic visualization. Although the patient was empirically started on antibiotic and anti-allergic therapy, there was no improvement after a few weeks and the patient had recurrent episodes of haemoptysis. Fibre-optic visualization was repeated showing bilateral <b>osteomeatal</b> erythema. Computed tomography scan of the paranasal sinuses demonstrated complete opacification of the left maxillary antrum along with a focal area of density comparable to bone. An ectopic, supernumerary molar tooth was found in the left maxillary antrum on endoscopic examination and subsequently removed. In addition, copious purulent discharge was seen. Post-operatively, the patient was treated with a 10 -day course of oral amoxicillin-clavulanate. On follow-up, he reported resolution of symptoms. Conclusion Recurrent haemoptysis has not been described as a presentation for a supernumerary, ectopic tooth in literature before. We recommend that in patients with sinusitis-type of opacification of maxillary antrum and whose condition is refractory to conventional medical treatment, consideration should be given to the investigation of possible underlying anomalies as the cause of such symptoms. Presence of foreign bodies and ectopic teeth in paranasal sinuses can be reliably excluded with the use of appropriate radiological imaging and endoscopic examination. </p...|$|E
40|$|AIM: Common cold is the commonest form {{of acute}} {{rhinitis}} {{and the first}} pathology of the upper airways. Viruses, the main responsible of this pathology, carry out their cytopathic effect on the ciliated cells of the airways mucosa. Mucociliary transport shows their dangerous effect. The aim of our study is to evaluate {{the effect of the}} medical device Prima Difesa on the functioning of the mechanism thanks to its composition and its distribution modality in the nasal cavities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study has been performed on three groups of subjects with their informed consent: Group A (30 healthy subjects: 19 M, 11 F; 18 - 36 yrs, mean age: 29. 1 yrs), Gruppo B (30 patients affected by rhinosinusal pathology: 7 M, 13 F; 19 - 38 yrs, mean age 30. 7 yrs) and Group C (20 healthy subjects: 12 M, 8 F; 20 - 40 yrs, mean age: 32. 2 yrs). The protocol of administration for the Group A and B, in order to evaluate the efficacy of Prima Difesa, consisted of 2 puff per nostril of Prima Difesa 4 times a day over 15 days. The follow-up of patients belonging to Grup A and Group B was articulated in three consecutive visits, each consisting of: anterior rhinoscopy, active anterior rhinomanometry, measurement of mucociliary transport (TMCt). The C patients underwent only one administration of the device to the extent of evaluating through endoscopy its distribution modality in the nasal cavities. RESULTS: The results show that clinical effects, evaluated in term of improvement of MCTt and in term of decreasing of nasal resistance, are particularly clear in patients with alterations of these parameters caused by rhinosinusal pathologies. The device can reach the "key" areas of rhinosinusal pathologies that are: middle turbinate and <b>osteomeatal</b> complex. Beside, the percentage of diffusion, about 30...|$|E
