5|$|In general, {{strongly}} inherited gene mutations (including {{mutations in}} BRCA2) {{account for only}} 5-10% of breast cancer cases; the specific risk <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> breast or other cancer for anyone carrying a BRCA2 mutation depends on many factors.|$|E
5|$|Myrmecia ants are {{frequently}} encountered by humans, and avoiding them is difficult. Wearing closed footwear such as boots and shoes {{can reduce the}} risk <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> stung; these ants are capable of stinging through fabric, however. A risk of being stung while gardening also exists; most stings occur when someone is gardening and is unaware of the ants' presence. Eliminating nearby nests or moving to areas with low Myrmecia populations significantly decreases the chances <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> stung.|$|E
40|$|The {{recently}} elucidated Get proteins {{are responsible}} for the targeted delivery of the majority of tail-anchored (TA) proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum. Get 4 and Get 5 have been identified in the early steps of the pathway mediating TA substrate delivery to the cytoplasmic targeting factor Get 3. Here we report a crystal structure <b>of</b> <b>Get</b> 4 and an N-terminal fragment <b>of</b> <b>Get</b> 5 from Saccharomyces cerevisae. We show Get 4 and Get 5 (Get 4 / 5) form an intimate complex that exists as a dimer (two copies <b>of</b> <b>Get</b> 4 / 5) mediated by the C-terminus <b>of</b> <b>Get</b> 5. We further demonstrate that Get 3 specifically binds to a conserved surface on Get 4 in a nucleotide dependent manner. This work provides further evidence for a model in which Get 4 / 5 operates upstream <b>of</b> <b>Get</b> 3 and mediates the specific delivery of a TA substrate...|$|R
40|$|The GET pathway, using several {{proteins}} (Gets 1 - 5 {{and probably}} Sgt 2), posttranslationally conducts tail-anchored (TA) proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). At the ER, TA proteins are {{inserted into the}} lipid bilayer and then sorted and directed to their respective destinations in the secretory pathway. Until last year, there was no structural information on any <b>of</b> the <b>GET</b> components but now there are ten crystal structures <b>of</b> <b>Get</b> 3 {{in a variety of}} nucleotide-bound states and conformations. The structures <b>of</b> <b>Get</b> 4 and a portion <b>of</b> <b>Get</b> 5 also emerged in 2010. This minireview provides a detailed comparison <b>of</b> the <b>GET</b> structures and discusses their mechanistic relevance to TA protein insertion. It also addresses the outstanding gaps in detailed molecular information on this system, including the structures <b>of</b> <b>Get</b> 5, Sgt 2, and the transmembrane complex comprising Get 1 and Get 2...|$|R

5|$|Another test {{known as}} a phototest is the most useful in {{identifying}} solar urticaria. In this test, one centimeter segments of skin are subject to varying amounts of UVA and UVB radiation {{in order to determine}} the specific dosage of the certain form of radiation that causes the urticaria to form. When testing for its less intense form (fixed solar urticaria), phototesting should be conducted only in the areas where the hives have appeared to avoid the possibility <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> false-negative results.|$|E
