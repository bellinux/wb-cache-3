5|$|In The Kingdom of This World, Carpentier {{creates a}} {{succession}} of characters that engage in very similar actions. This repetition, a stylistic tool that resembles baroque writings, constructs a cyclical pattern in the novel which depicts the author's social views. The succession of characters (as well as places) that replace each other without fully developing <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> (<b>or</b> blocked from developing, in a sense) represent Carpentier's view of the social context in which forces are preventing characters from developing.|$|E
5|$|Jocelin was a royal justiciar in 1203, {{as well as}} the {{custodian}} of {{the vacant}} diocese of Lincoln. He was a royal clerk as well as a canon of Wells, becoming a canon and a deacon by 1200. The previous bishop of Wells died in 1205, and on 3 February 1206, Jocelin was elected bishop. He was consecrated on 28 May 1206, at Reading by Bishop William of Sainte-Mère-Eglise of London. It is unclear if the cathedral chapters of Bath and of Wells took the action <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>own,</b> <b>or</b> if King John was {{the driving force behind the}} election.|$|E

25|$|Christian Scriptures record {{nothing about}} the Biblical Magi after {{reporting}} their going back to their own countries. Two separate traditions have surfaced claiming that they were so moved by their encounter with Jesus that they either became Christians <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>or</b> were quick to convert fully upon later encountering an Apostle of Jesus. The traditions claim that they were so strong in their beliefs that they willingly embraced martyrdom.|$|E
25|$|Nurses are {{not truly}} doctor's assistants. This is {{possible}} in certain situations, but nurses more often are independently caring for their patients or assisting other nurses. Registered Nurses treat patients, record their medical history, provide emotional support, and provide follow-up care. Nurses also help doctors perform diagnostic tests.

25|$|Another {{change of}} record label saw {{the release of}} the {{critically}} acclaimed Secrets album in 2001. Secrets failed to sell because the record label went into receivership, curtailing promotion. After the failure of a project he had put so much work and time into, Oakey lost faith in the record industry and changed the band's focus to more lucrative live work. Between 2002 and the present day, they have toured regularly either <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>or</b> as guests at festivals. They have played at such prestigious events as V Festival, Festival Internacional de Benicàssim and to 18,000 fans at the Hollywood Bowl, Los Angeles in 2006.|$|E
25|$|Singapore {{took the}} step of nationalising {{companies}} {{that would not}} survive <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>own,</b> <b>or</b> could otherwise be detrimental for Singapore {{if they were not}} closely in line with government policy because they were a public service. Singapore Power, Public Utilities Board, SingTel and Singapore Airlines (SIA) are prominent examples. Such companies that were nationalized were often infrastructure or utility companies, companies meant to lay out services such as electricity or transport for the benefit of other companies. The extension of power infrastructure, for example, led to an increased attraction of foreign investors. Recently, the government has taken steps to privatize these previous monopolies - SingTel and Singapore Airlines are now publicly listed, limited liability companies, even though the government still holds large shares in them.|$|E
25|$|The Epping Forest Scout Conservation Project {{was set up}} in 1989 {{to provide}} Venture Scouts, now Explorer Scouts a {{residential}} experience focused on conservation, working with environmental experts to give hands on training in forestry conservation techniques. Project, as the event is affectionately known, is held in Epping Forest and is run by a national Scout Active Support unit – and so Explorer Scouts do not have to come with their leaders or their unit: they can come <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>or</b> {{with a small group of}} Explorer friends. As Explorers attend without their leaders, Project is ideal to fulfil the requirements of the residential section of their Queen’s Scout or Duke of Edinburgh’s Gold Awards. The next event is due to take place between Saturday 17th and Saturday 24 August 2014.|$|E

25|$|Fries {{are very}} popular in Belgium, where they are known as frieten (in Dutch) or frites (in French), and the Netherlands, where among the working classes they are known as patat in the north and, in the south, friet. In Belgium, fries are sold in shops called friteries (French), frietkot/frituur (Dutch), or Fritüre/Frittüre (German). They are served with a large variety of Belgian sauces and eaten either <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>or</b> with other snacks. Traditionally fries are served in a cornet de frites (French), patatzak/frietzak/fritzak (Dutch/Flemish), or Frittentüte (German), a white {{cardboard}} cone, then wrapped in paper, with a spoonful of sauce (often mayonnaise) on top. They may also be served with other traditional fast food items, such as frikandel, burgers, fishsticks, meatballs or croquette. In the Netherlands, fries are sold at snack bars and often served a sauce like Fritessaus or curry ketchup.|$|E
25|$|Century eggs can {{be eaten}} without further preparation, <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>or</b> {{as a side}} dish. As an hors d'œuvre, the Cantonese wrap chunks of this egg with slices of pickled ginger root (sometimes sold on a stick as street food). A Shanghainese recipe mixes chopped century eggs with chilled tofu. In Taiwan, it is popular to eat century eggs by slicing them, and placed on top of cold tofu with katsuobushi, soy sauce, and sesame oil in a style similar to Japanese hiyayakko. A {{variation}} of this recipe common in northern China is to slice century eggs over chilled silken (soft) tofu, adding liberal quantities of shredded young ginger and chopped spring onions as a topping, and then drizzling light soy sauce and sesame oil over the dish, to taste. They are also used in a dish called old-and-fresh eggs, where chopped century eggs are combined with (or used to top) an omelet made with fresh eggs. The century eggs may also be cut into chunks and stir fried with vegetables, which is most commonly found in Taiwanese cuisine.|$|E
25|$|Promoting {{independence}} in self-care can provide {{older adults with}} the capability to maintain independence longer and can leave them {{with a sense of}} achievement when they complete a task unaided. Older adults that require assistance with activities of daily living are at a greater risk of losing their independence with self-care tasks as dependent personal behaviours are often met with reinforcement from caregivers. It is important for caregivers to ensure that measures are put into place to preserve and promote function rather than contribute to a decline in status in an older adult that has physical limitations. Caregivers need to be conscious of actions and behaviors that cause older adults to become dependent on them and need to allow older patients to maintain as much independence as possible. Providing information to the older patient on why it is important to perform self-care may allow them to see the benefit in performing self-care independently. If the older adult is able to complete self-care activities <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>own,</b> <b>or</b> even if they need supervision, encourage them in their efforts as maintaining independence can provide them with a sense of accomplishment and the ability to maintain independence longer.|$|E

500|$|Welsh cakes, or pice ar y maen meaning [...] "cakes on the stone", {{are small}} round spiced cakes, {{traditionally}} cooked on a bakestone, but more recently on a griddle.

The dough which is mixed with raisins, sultanas and sometimes currants, is similar to shortbread, meaning they can have the consistency of biscuits when cooked on the griddle, and slightly more like a cake when cooked in the oven.|$|E
500|$|A typical Dungeons & Dragons game {{consists}} of an [...] "adventure", which is roughly equivalent to a single story. The DM can either design an adventure <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>own,</b> <b>or</b> follow {{one of the many}} pre-made adventures (also known as [...] "modules") that have been published throughout the history of Dungeons & Dragons. Published adventures typically include a background story, illustrations, maps and goals for PCs to achieve. Some include location descriptions and handouts. Although a small adventure entitled [...] "Temple of the Frog" [...] was included in the Blackmoor rules supplement in 1975, the first stand-alone D module published by TSR was 1978's Steading of the Hill Giant Chief, written by Gygax.|$|E
