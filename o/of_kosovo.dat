5|$|The {{flag of the}} Republic <b>of</b> <b>Kosovo</b> {{was adopted}} by the Assembly <b>of</b> <b>Kosovo</b> {{immediately}} following the declaration of independence <b>of</b> <b>Kosovo</b> from Serbia on 17 February 2008. The flag is the result of an international design competition, organised by the United Nations-backed Kosovo Unity Team, which attracted almost one thousand entries. The now-used design was proposed by by Muhamer Ibrahimi. It shows six white stars in an arc above a golden map <b>of</b> <b>Kosovo</b> on a blue field. The stars symbolise Kosovo's six major ethnic groups.|$|E

5|$|From 1991 to 1992, Jashari {{and about}} 100 other ethnic Albanians wishing {{to fight for}} the {{independence}} <b>of</b> <b>Kosovo</b> underwent military training in the municipality of Labinot-Mal in Albania. Afterwards, Jashari and other ethnic Albanians committed several acts of sabotage aimed at the Serbian administrative apparatus in Kosovo. Attempting to capture or kill him, Serbian police surrounded Jashari and his older brother, Hamëz, at their home in Prekaz on 30 December 1991. In the ensuing siege, large numbers <b>of</b> <b>Kosovo</b> Albanians flocked to Prekaz, pressuring the police to withdraw from the village.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{declaration}} of independence, Kosovars displayed a flag featuring a map <b>of</b> <b>Kosovo</b> against a blue and yellow background, similar to the flag of Bosnia and Herzegovina.|$|E
5|$|A {{competition}} {{for a new}} flag, held in June 2007, received 993 entries. Under the terms of UN talks, all such symbols would have to reflect the multi-ethnic nature <b>of</b> <b>Kosovo,</b> avoiding {{the use of the}} Albanian or Serbian double-headed eagles or the use of solely red and black or red, blue and white color schemes. Red and black are the colours used on the Albanian flag; red, blue and white are the main colours used on the Serbian flag. Additionally, all entries had to be rectangular and have a 2:3 proportion. The Kosovo Symbols Commission eventually selected three designs, which were then voted on by the Assembly <b>of</b> <b>Kosovo</b> (with a two-thirds majority required for approval), when independence was declared after the status talks. The three proposals selected were forwarded to the Assembly on 4 February 2008.|$|E

5|$|The {{remaining}} territory, {{which consisted}} of Serbia proper, the northern part <b>of</b> <b>Kosovo</b> (around Kosovska Mitrovica), and the Banat was occupied by the Germans and placed under the administration of a German military government. This {{was due to the}} key rail and riverine transport routes that passed through it, and its valuable resources, particularly non-ferrous metals.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the writer}} Branko Ćopić, who was a Partisan in Grmeč, Stojanović was greeted by a crowd of villagers and welcomed with the {{traditional}} bread and salt ceremony when he crossed the Sana River. Prominent villagers shook hands with him, and they compared him with Miloš Obilića famous Serbian epic hero from the medieval Battle <b>of</b> <b>Kosovo.</b> Several women approached Stojanović to kiss his hands; he declined this mark of respect, {{saying that he was}} not a priest but a communist.|$|E

2500|$|The initial status {{negotiations}} {{focused on}} technical issues important for Kosovo's long-term stability, particularly {{the rights and}} protection <b>of</b> <b>Kosovo's</b> minorities (especially the Kosovo Serbs). [...] Ahtisaari brought the parties {{together for the first}} direct dialogue in February 2006 to discuss decentralization of local government, which is an important measure to protect Kosovo Serb communities. [...] Subsequent meetings addressed economic issues, property rights, protection of Serbian Orthodox Church heritage and institutional guarantees for the rights <b>of</b> <b>Kosovo's</b> minorities.|$|R
5000|$|A UN-led {{political}} process began in late 2005 to determine Kosovo's future status. [...] Belgrade proposed that Kosovo be highly autonomous and remain {{a part of}} Serbia — Belgrade officials repeatedly said that an imposition <b>of</b> <b>Kosovo's</b> independence would {{be a violation of}} Serbia's sovereignty and therefore contrary to international law and the UN Charter. Representatives <b>of</b> <b>Kosovo's</b> ethnic-Albanian majority asserted that Kosovo must become independent, arguing that the violence of the Milošević years made continued union between Kosovo and Serbia impossible.|$|R
5|$|Following the Young Turk Revolution in 1908, the Ottoman Turkish Empire {{experienced}} {{democracy and}} several political parties were created. However, {{some of the}} policies implemented by the Young Turks, such as a tax rise and the interdiction of ethnic-based political parties, discontented minorities. Albanians opposed the nationalist character of the movement and led local uprisings in 1910 and 1912. During the latter they managed to seize most <b>of</b> <b>Kosovo</b> and took Skopje on 11 August. On 18 August, the insurgents signed the Üsküb agreement which provided {{for the creation of}} an autonomous Albanian province and they were amnestied the day later.|$|E
5|$|In early March 2008, Abkhazia and South Ossetia {{submitted}} formal {{requests for}} their recognition to Russia's parliament {{shortly after the}} West's recognition <b>of</b> <b>Kosovo</b> to which Russia was opposed. Dmitry Rogozin, Russian ambassador to NATO, warned that Georgia's NATO membership aspirations would cause Russia to support the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The Russian State Duma adopted a resolution on 21 March, in which it called on the President of Russia and the government to consider the recognition.|$|E
5|$|On 15June 1389 Serbian forces led by Prince Lazar, Vuk Branković, and Tvrtko's nobleman Vlatko Vuković of Zachlumia, {{confronted the}} Ottoman army led by Sultan Murad I at the Battle <b>of</b> <b>Kosovo,</b> the best-known battle in medieval Serbian history. With {{the bulk of}} both armies wiped out and Lazar and Murad killed, {{the outcome of the}} battle was inconclusive. In its {{aftermath}} the Serbs had insufficient manpower to defend their lands, while the Turks had many more troops in the east. Serbian principalities which were not already Ottoman vassals became such over the next few years.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Loznica {{involved}} {{an attack on}} the German garrison of that town by the Jadar Chetnik Detachment on 31 August 1941. Following the World War II German-led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was partitioned. At the time, Loznica was part of the German-occupied territory of Serbia, which included Serbia proper, with the addition of the northern part <b>of</b> <b>Kosovo</b> (around Kosovska Mitrovica), and the Banat.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} became {{worse for}} Byzantium {{during the civil}} wars after Andronikos III died. A six-year-long civil war devastated the empire, allowing the Serbian ruler Stefan Dušan (r. 1331–1346) to overrun most of the Empire's remaining territory and establish a Serbian Empire. In 1354, an earthquake at Gallipoli devastated the fort, allowing the Ottomans (who were hired as mercenaries {{during the civil war}} by John VI Kantakouzenos) to establish themselves in Europe. By the time the Byzantine civil wars had ended, the Ottomans had defeated the Serbians and subjugated them as vassals. Following the Battle <b>of</b> <b>Kosovo,</b> much of the Balkans became dominated by the Ottomans.|$|E
5|$|After Kosovo's {{declaration}} of independence from Serbia in 2008, its broadcaster Radio Television <b>of</b> <b>Kosovo</b> (RTK) applied for EBU membership, and wished to enter Kosovo into Eurovision Song Contest 2009.

As of 2013, RTK has observer status within the EBU and did participate in the Eurovision Young Dancers 2011.
