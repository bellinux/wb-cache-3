5|$|Coke as fuel: By the 11th century, {{during the}} Song Dynasty (960â€“1279), {{the demands for}} {{charcoal}} used in the blast and cupola furnaces of the iron industry led to large amounts <b>of</b> <b>deforestation</b> of prime timberland; to avoid excessive deforestation, the Song Chinese began using coke made from bituminous coal as fuel for their metallurgic furnaces instead of charcoal derived from wood.|$|E
5|$|In 2005 Nigeria had {{the highest}} rate <b>of</b> <b>deforestation</b> in the world, {{according}} to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). In 2005 12.2%, the equivalent of 11,089,000 hectares had been forested in Nigeria. Between 1990 and 2000, Nigeria lost an average of 409,700 hectares of forest every year equal to an average annual deforestation rate of 2.38%. Between 1990 and 2005, in total Nigeria lost 35.7% of its forest cover, or around 6,145,000 hectares.|$|E

5|$|Marshall {{returned}} to the East Coast in late September 1931. Although he was writing Arctic Village, he also wrote prolifically on other topics and published several articles about American forestry. In particular, he was concerned that few articles of this time addressed the issue <b>of</b> <b>deforestation,</b> and {{he wrote a letter}} to the president of the American Forestry Association, George D. Pratt, on the matter. He also pursued a variety of other activities: he accepted an invitation to serve on a committee to dedicate a memorial (Louis Marshall Memorial Hall) to his father at the forestry college in Syracuse. He lectured in various cities, delivering speeches about his travels and wilderness preservation.|$|E
5|$|The {{headwaters}} of the Snake River and the high mountains elsewhere in the watershed were historically heavily forested. These include aspen, Douglas fir, and spruce fir, comprising about 20% of the historic watershed. At the base of mountains and in the Lost River basin, sagebrush was and is the predominant vegetation cover. Because <b>of</b> <b>deforestation,</b> up to {{one quarter of the}} forests have been taken over by sagebrush, leaving the remaining forests to cover about 15% of the watershed. However, the lodgepole pine has increased in number, taking over historic stands of other conifers. There are also up to 118 species of rare or endemic plants that occur in the Snake River watershed.|$|E
5|$|Waste {{management}} including sewage treatment, the linked processes <b>of</b> <b>deforestation</b> {{and soil}} degradation, {{and climate change}} or global warming are the major environmental problems in Nigeria. Waste management presents problems in a mega city like Lagos and other major Nigerian cities which are linked with economic development, population growth and the inability of municipal councils to manage the resulting rise in industrial and domestic waste. This huge waste management problem is also attributable to unsustainable environmental management lifestyles of Kubwa Community in the Federal Capital Territory, where there are habits of indiscriminate disposal of waste, dumping of waste along or into the canals, sewerage systems that are channels for water flows, etc.|$|E

5|$|While the golden-crowned sifaka faces few {{biological}} threats, such as predation, {{it faces}} many significant human-caused (anthropogenic) threats. Its habitat has been highly fragmented, with forest patches isolated by severely degraded grasslands. By 1985 {{it was estimated}} that 34% of the entire eastern rainforest of the island had disappeared, and by extrapolation it is predicted that at this rate <b>of</b> <b>deforestation</b> there will be no eastern rainforest left by 2020. Illegal logging practices, slash-and-burn agriculture (known as tavy), uncontrolled grass fires, gold mining, poaching, and clearing land for agricultural use have all significantly contributed to the significant deforestation witnessed in Madagascar and the ongoing decline of suitable habitat for this species.|$|E
5|$|Chorioactis geaster has a disjunct distribution, and {{has only}} been {{collected}} from Texas and Japan. The first reported collection in Japan was in Kyushu in 1937, {{and then it was}} not collected again in that location until thirty-six years later. In 2006, it was observed in a humid forest near Kawakami, Nara Prefecture. The fungus's natural habitat in Japan is disappearing because of the practice <b>of</b> <b>deforestation</b> and replanting with Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica). This rare mushroom has been put on the list of threatened species in Japan. In Texas, the fungus has been reported in Collin, Hays, Travis, Dallas, Denton, Guadalupe, Tarrant and Hunt counties. Travis, Hays, and Guadalupe counties are in central Texas, while the remainder are clustered together in the northeastern part of the state. Although the species is considered rare due to its globally restricted distribution, it may be locally abundant.|$|E
5|$|In the {{smelting}} {{process of}} using huge bellows driven by waterwheels, {{massive amounts of}} charcoal {{were used in the}} production process, leading to a wide range <b>of</b> <b>deforestation</b> in northern China. However, {{by the end of the}} 11th century the Chinese discovered that using bituminous coke could replace the role of charcoal, hence many acres of forested land in northern China were spared from the steel and iron industry with this switch of resources. Iron and steel of this period were used to mass-produce ploughs, hammers, needles, pins, nails for ships, musical cymbals, chains for suspension bridges, Buddhist statues, and other routine items for an indigenous mass market. Iron was also a necessary manufacturing component for the production processes of salt and copper. Many newly constructed canals linked the major iron and steel production centers to the capital city's main market. This was also extended to trade with the outside world, which greatly expanded with the high level of Chinese maritime activity abroad during the Southern Song period.|$|E

5|$|Logging, {{along with}} {{cultivation}} practices has devastated tree cover, causing severe environmental degradation in the country. Over 80percent of Sarawak's rainforest has been cleared. Floods in East Malaysia have been worsened {{by the loss}} of trees, and over 60percent of the Peninsular's forest have been cleared. With current rates <b>of</b> <b>deforestation,</b> the forests are predicted to be extinct by 2020. Deforestation is a major problem for animals, fungi and plants, as the forest is cut to make room for plantations. Most remaining forest is found inside national parks. Habitat destruction has proved a threat for marine life. Illegal fishing is another major threat, with fishing methods such as dynamite fishing and poisoning depleting marine ecosystems. Leatherback turtle numbers have dropped 98percent since the 1950s. Hunting has also been an issue for some animals, with overconsumption and the use of animal parts for profit endangering many animals, from marine life to tigers. Marine life is also detrimentally affected by uncontrolled tourism.|$|E
5|$|Many {{endemic species}} of Mauritius became extinct after {{the arrival of}} humans, so the {{ecosystem}} of the island is badly damaged and hard to reconstruct. Before humans arrived, Mauritius was entirely covered in forests, but very little remains of them today, because <b>of</b> <b>deforestation.</b> The surviving endemic fauna is still seriously threatened. The dodo lived alongside other recently extinct Mauritian birds such as the flightless red rail, the broad-billed parrot, the Mascarene grey parakeet, the Mauritius blue pigeon, the Mauritius owl, the Mascarene coot, the Mauritian shelduck, the Mauritian duck, and the Mauritius night heron. Extinct Mauritian reptiles include the saddle-backed Mauritius giant tortoise, the domed Mauritius giant tortoise, the Mauritian giant skink, and the Round Island burrowing boa. The small Mauritian flying fox and the snail Tropidophora carinata lived on Mauritius and RÃ©union, but vanished from both islands. Some plants, such as Casearia tinifolia and the palm orchid, have also become extinct.|$|E

Remnants of the native Scots pine forest exist and within these areas the Scottish crossbill, the UK's only endemic bird species and vertebrate, can be found alongside capercaillie, Scottish wildcat, red squirrel and pine marten. Various animals have been re-introduced, including the white-tailed sea eagle in 1975, the red kite in the 1980s, and there have been experimental projects involving the beaver and wild boar. Today, much of the remaining native Caledonian Forest lies within the Cairngorms National Park and remnants of the forest remain at 84 locations across Scotland. On the west coast, remnants of ancient Celtic Rainforest still remain, particularly on the Taynish peninsula in Argyll, these forests are particularly rare due to high rates <b>of</b> <b>deforestation</b> throughout Scottish history.|$|E
5|$|Between 4500 and 3800 BCE, {{all of the}} British Isles came {{to abandon}} its former Mesolithic {{hunter-gatherer}} lifestyle, {{to be replaced by}} the new agricultural subsistence of the Neolithic Age. Although a common material culture was shared throughout most of the British Isles in this period, there was great regional variation regarding the nature and distribution of settlement, architectural styles, and the use of natural resources. Throughout most of Britain, there is little evidence of cereal or permanent dwellings from this period, leading archaeologists to believe that the Early Neolithic economy on the island was largely pastoral, relying on herding cattle, with people living a nomadic or semi-nomadic way of life. Although witnessing some land clearance, Britain was largely forested in this period, and it is unclear what level <b>of</b> <b>deforestation</b> the area of Kent had experienced in the Early Neolithic; widespread forest clearance only took place on the chalklands of south-east Britain in the Late Bronze Age. Environmental data from the area around the White Horse Stone supports the idea that the area was still largely forested in the Early Neolithic, covered by a woodland of oak, ash, hazel/alder and Maloideae.|$|E
