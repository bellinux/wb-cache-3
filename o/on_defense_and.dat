5|$|The Blonde Bear {{was one of}} the world's {{greatest}} football players, {{who never}} missed an open field block.

5|$|As Cannon—along {{with most}} of the {{defensive}} starters—returned, LSU was expected to compete for another title in 1959. The Tigers began the season as the top-ranked team, and the number of season-ticket holders tripled compared to the previous season. The team won its first six games without allowing a touchdown. Cannon showed his versatility in those games; he led the team in total yards on offense, returned an interception for a touchdown <b>on</b> <b>defense,</b> <b>and</b> averaged 40 yards per punt while also returning punts and kickoffs. This set up a highly anticipated match-up between LSU and rival Ole Miss Rebels, who were also undefeated.|$|E

With his initiative, the Special Regiment was established in September 1990. Composed of 26 platoons and a total of 2,300 men, it was the first formal Armenian military unit independent from Moscow. It became the main base of the Armenian army in the following years.|$|E

This was a concentrated {{effort on the part of}} the Army, who fought back against similar Air Force tactics. They also deliberately spread the Zeus contracts over 37 states in order to gain as much political and industrial support as possible, while taking out advertisements in major mass-market magazines like Life and The Saturday Evening Post promoting the system.|$|E

5|$|Although young, Kennedy was {{successful}} with Toronto from the start. In his first season, the 18-year-old finished {{second on the}} team in scoring and then in his sophomore year was considered the star of Toronto's upset of the record-breaking Montreal Canadiens of 1944–45. He established himself {{as the leader of}} the team and became captain in 1948. Although not the best skater in the league, Kennedy was a fierce forechecker and skilled playmaker. Kennedy was a perfect fit into coach Hap Day's emphasis <b>on</b> <b>defense</b> <b>and</b> positional play. He gained a reputation for scoring the important goal and excelling in the playoffs. Kennedy holds the Toronto Maple Leafs' all-time record for career points in the Stanley Cup Finals and is the youngest player in the history of the NHL to have scored a Stanley Cup winning goal. A Sports Illustrated poll of hockey experts in 1998 rated Kennedy as having the best face-off skills in the history of the NHL.|$|E
5|$|Kansas, meanwhile, was less-highly {{regarded}} <b>on</b> <b>defense</b> <b>and</b> {{came into}} the 2008 Orange Bowl ranked 57thnationally in pass defense. On the ground, however, Kansas was ranked far higher—sixth in the nation. In addition, Kansas only allowed an average of 16points per game, good enough for to be ranked fourth nationally. A key portion of that run defense was defensive tackle James McClinton, who was named the Big12's Defensive Lineman of the Year and earned second-team All-America honors. McClinton finished the 2007 regular season with 10.5tackles for loss and promised {{more of the same}} for the Orange Bowl. The team captain of the Jayhawk defense, meanwhile, was All-American cornerback Aqib Talib. Talib was also a threat on offense, catching eightpasses, including fourtouchdowns, during the regular season.|$|E
5|$|The Spurs {{qualified}} for the 1998 NBA Playoffs as the fifth seed, but Duncan had a bad first half in his first playoff game against the Phoenix Suns, causing Suns coach Danny Ainge to play Duncan with less defensive pressure. The rookie capitalized on this by finishing Game 1 with 32 points and 10 rebounds and replicating the performance in Game 2, contributing to a 3–1 victory over the Suns. However, the Spurs lost {{in the second round}} to the eventual Western Conference Champions Utah Jazz. In this series, Duncan was pitted against Hall-of-Fame power forward Karl Malone. Duncan outscored Malone {{in the first two games}} which the Spurs lost, but as the series progressed, the more experienced Malone shut Duncan down <b>on</b> <b>defense</b> <b>and</b> dominated on offense, outscoring the young power forward in Games 3 to 5 18–10, 34–22 and 24–14 respectively.|$|E

5|$|A {{victory over}} San Francisco gave the Browns 10 wins {{in a row}} to start the regular season. The game was eagerly {{anticipated}} by both sides: San Francisco had started the season with 10 victories, while the Browns had won their first nine games. The 49ers relied heavily on their offense, which featured quarterback Frankie Albert and end Alyn Beals. The team came into the matchup with the Browns averaging 35.9 points per game. The Browns, meanwhile, were more proficient than the 49ers <b>on</b> <b>defense</b> <b>and</b> in placekicking: the team ranked first in the AAFC in fewest points allowed, and Groza held the league record for the longest field goal. The game began with a San Francisco fumble of Cleveland's opening kickoff that was recovered by Lou Saban. Several plays later, Graham ran 14 yards for a touchdown, giving the Browns their first points. San Francisco responded later in the period with a rushing touchdown by Joe Perry to tie the score. Cleveland struck back with an Edgar Jones touchdown in the third quarter, however, and held {{on to win the}} game 14–7. Ara Parseghian was a standout on both offense and defense, batting down several of Albert's passes. The crowd of 82,769 set a professional football record. While Cleveland won, several key players suffered injuries. Speedie had a separated shoulder, while linebacker Bill Willis was kicked in the face and Tommy James hurt his ankle. Graham had his hand stepped on, and guard Weldon Humble suffered a chin injury.|$|E
