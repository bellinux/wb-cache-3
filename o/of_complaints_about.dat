After the closure of the Indra because <b>of</b> <b>complaints</b> <b>about</b> the noise, the Beatles played in the Kaiserkeller, starting on 4 October 1960.|$|E
5|$|The {{difficulties}} with Garrard's election over Benjamin Logan in 1795 {{added to a}} litany <b>of</b> <b>complaints</b> <b>about</b> the state's first constitution. Some {{believed that it was}} undemocratic because it required electors to choose the governor and state senators and many offices were appointive rather than elective. Others opposed life terms for judges and other state officials. Still others wanted slavery excluded from the document, or to lift the ban on ministers serving in the General Assembly. In the aftermath of the disputed 1795 election, all parties involved agreed that changes were needed. The present constitution provided no means for amendment, however. The only remedy was another constitutional convention.|$|E
5|$|When the US ban on JFK Concorde {{operations}} {{was lifted}} in February 1977, New York banned Concorde locally. The ban {{came to an}} end on 17 October 1977 when the Supreme Court of the United States declined to overturn a lower court's ruling rejecting efforts by the Port Authority and a grass-roots campaign led by Carol Berman to continue the ban. In spite <b>of</b> <b>complaints</b> <b>about</b> noise, the noise report noted that Air Force One, at the time a Boeing VC-137, was louder than Concorde at subsonic speeds and during take-off and landing. Scheduled service from Paris and London to New York's John F. Kennedy Airport began on 22 November 1977.|$|E

5|$|Edward II succeeded as king of England on 7 July 1307, on {{the death}} of his father Edward I. The {{expectations}} of the new king were high, and he initially enjoyed a good relationship with the leading magnates of the realm. There were, however, some issues of contention remaining from the reign of his father. Edward I's incessant wars had put a great fiscal burden on the country, and his confrontational style had led to conflict with some of the leading lay and ecclesiastical lords. This had culminated in the drafting of the so-called Remonstrances in 1297, a set <b>of</b> <b>complaints</b> <b>about</b> royal government. By Edward I's death in 1307, most of these issued had been resolved. It was nevertheless in the interest of the leading men of the country to make sure that the new king did not act the way his father had, and ignored the opinions of his councillors.|$|E
5|$|The Chief of Staff of the United States Army, General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower, {{met with}} Groves on 30 January 1948 to {{evaluate}} his performance. Eisenhower recounted {{a long list}} <b>of</b> <b>complaints</b> <b>about</b> Groves pertaining to his rudeness, arrogance, insensitivity, contempt for the rules and maneuvering for promotion out of turn. Eisenhower {{made it clear that}} Groves would never become Chief of Engineers. Groves realized that in the rapidly shrinking postwar military he would not be given any assignment approaching in importance the one he had held in the Manhattan Project, as such posts would go to combat commanders returning from overseas, and he decided to leave the Army. He was promoted to lieutenant general on 24 January 1948, just before his retirement on 29 February 1948 in recognition of his leadership of the Manhattan Project. By special Act of Congress his date of rank was backdated to 16 July 1945, the date of the Trinity nuclear test.|$|E
5|$|With {{few options}} available, the Sounds signed a PDC with the Chicago White Sox {{who wanted to}} move their Triple-A farm club closer to home than their {{previous}} location in Vancouver. The White Sox presented Schmittou with a list <b>of</b> <b>complaints</b> <b>about</b> the relatively poor condition of Greer Stadium. Schmittou was unable to convince mayor Phil Bredesen or the Metro Council to pay for new stadium to replace Greer. He considered moving the team to a surrounding county, and explored sites in La Vergne, Cool Springs, and Mount Juliet. He even tried, unsuccessfully, to get the Metro Council to pass a referendum to let taxpayers vote on a temporary tax increase to pay off a proposed $40million stadium in three years. In the end, Schmittou elected to keep the Sounds at Greer but make significant improvements to the stadium. One of those improvements was the addition of Greer's signature guitar-shaped scoreboard, which was installed in 1993.|$|E

5|$|While {{some parts}} of the book were inventions, she also made use of real-life incidents. The opening chapter of The Danger Tree {{describes}} the accidental death of the young son of Sir Desmond and Lady Hooper. The incident was based on fact: Sir Walter and Lady Amy Smart's eight-year-old boy was killed when he picked up a stick bomb while on a desert picnic in January 1943. Just as described in the novel, his grief-stricken parents had tried to feed the dead boy through a hole in his cheek. Manning had long been resentful at the Smarts' failure to include her and Reggie in their artistic circle in Cairo. However, the scene was considered in poor taste even by Manning's friends, who were also outraged that the quiet and faithful Lady Smart was associated with Manning's very different Lady Hooper. Though both Sir Walter and his wife had died by the time of publication, Manning's publisher received a solicitor's letter written on behalf of the Smart family, objecting to the scene and requiring {{that there should be no}} further reference to the incident or to the couple in future volumes. Manning ignored both requests. She based the character of Aidan Pratt on the actor, writer and poet Stephen Haggard, whom she had known in Jerusalem. Like Pratt, Haggard committed suicide on a train from Cairo to Palestine, but in Haggard's case it followed the end of a relationship with a beautiful Egyptian woman, rather than unrequited homosexual love. After years <b>of</b> <b>complaints</b> <b>about</b> her publisher Heinemann, Manning moved to Weidenfeld & Nicolson, and remained with them until the end of her life. The Danger Tree was a considerable critical success, and though Manning was disappointed yet again that her novel was not shortlisted for the Booker prize, the Yorkshire Post selected it as their Best Novel of 1977. This award followed her 1976 appointment to the Order of the British Empire.|$|E

25|$|In the 1960s and 1970s the Cable Car was {{the subject}} <b>of</b> <b>complaints</b> <b>about</b> safety and comfort. The old wooden cars were {{increasingly}} considered antiquated. On 10 May 1973 a worker on the new motorway suffered serious injuries in an accident when he {{stepped in front of}} a Cable Car at the Clifton stop, prompting a review. The Ministry of Works concluded that aspects of the Cable Car were unsafe, particularly the use of unbraked trailers, and called for the system to be scrapped. The trailers were withdrawn, considerably reducing capacity.|$|E
25|$|The FRC {{continued}} {{to seek a}} {{reduction in the number of}} stations to more closely match the limited number of broadcast frequencies and saw weak and underfinanced stations such as WEVD as fodder for the executioner's axe. A number <b>of</b> <b>complaints</b> <b>about</b> the station began to be accumulated. In October 1930 a new set of hearings began with respect to the license renewal of the socialist radio station. A range of violations of the 1927 Radio Act were cited, including repeated failure to announce station call letters on the air every 15 minutes and inability to stay on its assigned wavelength. A recommendation was made by the FRC examiner assigned to the case to deny the station's license renewal application.|$|E

25|$|Although it was well-endowed, {{the abbey}} {{had fallen into}} serious {{financial}} difficulties by the early 14th century. This coincided with the episcopate of Roger Northburgh, a very effective administrator and a zealous reformer, who sought out abuses all over the Diocese of Lichfield, and the incumbency of Abbot John of Chetwynd, a particularly turbulent cleric. Unlike the nearby White Ladies Priory, a community of Augustinian canonesses, where Northburgh made a litany <b>of</b> <b>complaints</b> <b>about</b> conduct and discipline, Lilleshall was criticised almost entirely for financial ineptitude and administrative weakness. Northburgh found the abbey heavily in debt and criticised the abbot for failing to consult widely enough about expenditure. He highlighted {{the large number of}} corrodies, waste of timber on abbey lands, the inefficiency of the brewer, negligence in distributing alms at the gate and the age and infirmity of the abbot.|$|E
25|$|WDAZ and Prairie Public Television (through KGFE) are {{the only}} {{stations}} from this region that still air in Manitoba, after KVLY-TV (formerly KTHI) and KXJB-TV were replaced with other network affiliates in March 1986. This was due to a Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) decision that allowed the Winnipeg cable companies to replace the CBS and NBC affiliates with Detroit stations (WJBK (later WWJ-TV) and WDIV-TV, respectively) because <b>of</b> <b>complaints</b> <b>about</b> poor reception, but denied them the ability to replace WDAZ with WXYZ or KGFE/PPT with WTVS (although the latter station would later be added as a second PBS station to cable customers). Shaw Cable airs WDAZ on cable channel 7 and MTS TV airs WDAZ on cable channel 13. For several years in the 1980s, WDAZ was also fed in Saskatchewan {{as a replacement for}} KTHI on its Telecable (Saskatoon) and Cable Regina (now Access Communications) systems, before it (along with two Williston stations and PPT) were also replaced by Detroit stations {{in the aftermath of a}} similar CRTC decision in October 1984.|$|E

25|$|On April 22 Rodezno was {{nominated}} to Secretariado Político {{of the new}} party, Falange Española Tradicionalista, one of 4 Carlists within the 10-member body. He and other Carlists learned of the party program only once its 21 points were announced and immediately demonstrated some unease. His relations with Fal and Don Javier remained extremely tense, though falling short of total breakup; both considered him a fronding rebel. Rodezno’s efforts to elicit authorization from the regent produced no effect. During {{the next few months}} he presided over absorption into Falange rather than a fusion, bombarded with queries and protests from Carlist rank-and-file about total predomination and arrogance of camisas azules. Possibly as a result <b>of</b> <b>complaints</b> <b>about</b> the Falangists’ lack of give and take in October 1937 Franco called up theoretically governing structure of the party, the National Council; within its ranks the Carlists were even worse-off, only 11 of them among its 50 members. Despite Fal’s calls to decline, Rodezno accepted the seat and in December 1937 Don Javier expulsed him from Carlism.|$|E
