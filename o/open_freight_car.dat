40|$|AbstractOverweight {{goods are}} kind of special goods and must be loaded on the heavy duty <b>freight</b> <b>cars</b> when transported by railway. However, this sort of car is not taken {{consideration}} when the track structure is designed. In order to have knowledge regarding {{the action of the}} heavy duty <b>freight</b> <b>cars</b> on the track structure and correctly organize the transportation of the overweight goods, the strength of track was studied with the action of the heavy duty <b>freight</b> <b>cars</b> according to the basic theory of static mechanical calculation. Taking the D 2 car as an example of heavy duty <b>freight</b> <b>cars</b> and selecting the traditional track of railway, the finite element calculation model of track was established. With the software ANSYS, the forces and deformations of track structure were calculated under several parameters and conditions of different load position, spring rigidity coefficient and rail type. Then, the D 32, D 38 type of heavy duty <b>freight</b> <b>cars</b> and several common locomotives were selected and the forces and deformations with these loads were calculated and compared. The results show that the static extrema of forces and deformations of track structure have different laws under different parameters and conditions. The heavy duty <b>freight</b> <b>cars</b> loaded overweight goods generally make the track structure engender greater forces and deformations than those common locomotives do, and the D 2 car is of all the most adverse to the track. This indicates that heavy duty <b>freight</b> <b>cars</b> probably bring the bad effect to the lines. Therefore, when transporting overweight goods loaded on the heavy duty <b>freight</b> <b>cars,</b> adaptable measures and correct transport scheme are to be taken to decrease the damage to the lines...|$|R
50|$|When {{the first}} segment was opened, only {{relatively}} short 4-wheel boxcars and passenger cars were used. In 1892 the first passenger cars with bogies were employed, which replaced the 4-wheel cars {{over the following}} years. For <b>freight</b> <b>cars</b> this transition did not happen until the early 20th century, when <b>freight</b> <b>cars</b> with bogies for wood and gravel were put into service. The first transporter wagons started service around 1912, and by 1945 completely replaced any of the narrow gauge <b>freight</b> <b>cars.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} a new {{reinforcement}} learning system for generating marshaling plan of <b>freight</b> <b>cars</b> in a train is designed. In the proposed method, the total transfer {{distance of a}} locomotive is minimized to obtain the desired layout of <b>freight</b> <b>cars</b> for an outbound train. The order of movements of <b>freight</b> <b>cars,</b> the position for each removed car, the layout of cars in a train {{and the number of}} cars to be moved are simultaneously optimized to achieve minimization of the total transfer distance of a locomotive. Initially, <b>freight</b> <b>cars</b> are located in a freight yard by the random layout, and they are moved and lined into a main track in a certain desired order in order to assemble an out bound train. A layout and movements of <b>freight</b> <b>cars</b> are used to describe a state of marshaling yard, and the state transitions are defined based on the Markov Decision Process (MDP). Q-Learning is applied to reflect the transfer distance of the locomotive that are used to achieve one of the desired layouts in the main track. After adequate autonomous learning, the optimum schedule can be obtained by selecting a series of movements of <b>freight</b> <b>cars</b> that has the best evaluation...|$|R
