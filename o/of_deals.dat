5|$|Following {{months of}} Euromaidan street protests that began {{because of his}} refusal to sign an Association Agreement with the European Union in favor <b>of</b> <b>deals</b> from Russia, President Yanukovych fled Kiev in February 2014, {{ultimately}} to Russia, and parliament voted to remove him from his post. This brought another change in direction of Ukraine's association with Europe and by extension NATO. In 2014, pro-Russian unrest occurred in eastern Ukraine and Crimea was annexed by the Russian Federation in March. As {{part of an effort}} to assuage concerned groups, newly installed Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk addressed the topic in a Russian language speech on 18 March 2014, emphasizing that Ukraine was not seeking NATO membership. US President Barack Obama echoed this position the following week, while calling for greater NATO presence in Eastern Europe.|$|E
5|$|In 1916, Harry Frazee {{purchased}} the Red Sox, on credit, for $500,000. Despite Ruth's {{success with the}} Red Sox, owner and Broadway producer Frazee lost his patience with Ruth, who had threatened to hold out {{in lieu of a}} larger contract and become a distraction. After the Red Sox finished sixth in the American League in 1919, Frazee, needing money to finance a Broadway musical, No, No Nanette, sold pitcher-turned-outfielder Babe Ruth to the Yankees. Frazee received $125,000 and a loan of $300,000—secured on Fenway Park, the Red Sox' home stadium—for Ruth, despite Ruth having set the record for home runs with 29 in 1919. This began a series <b>of</b> <b>deals</b> with the Yankees that resulted in a long period of mediocrity for the Red Sox while the Yankees began their dynasty.|$|E

Cunningham now took the title of chief test pilot of the de Havilland Engine Company {{under the supervision of}} Geoffrey de Havilland Jr. Cunningham served as a pilot and consultant in a series <b>of</b> <b>deals</b> with the Swedish Air Force and Swiss Air Force. Both countries were keen to employ him but Cunningham visited only to deliver and advise on the de Havilland Vampire and British airborne radar design. In 1990 the Swiss presented him with the spade-grip from the control column mounted on a wooden stand when they withdrew the last of their Vampires. When the Swedes retired the machine in 1997 he was invited to celebrate its 50 years of Swedish service.|$|E

5|$|Ben Kaplan (Alex Lanipekun) {{breaks into}} Meynell's office to learn <b>of</b> <b>deals</b> between Highland Life and Salma, a Russian bank that {{according}} to Elizabeta Starkova (Paloma Baeza), has connections with the Russian mafia. It is also revealed Highland Life owes Salma £65 billion. It was this reason that earlier in the episode, Denham committed suicide. In order to get Meynell to trust her {{to become part of}} his plan, Ros sleeps with him. Later, Calderwood receives a call from Asa Darlek (Stephen Noonan), Meynell's associate from Salma, and threatens to either have the £65 billion paid back, or he will go public to inform the country the true extent of its debts. Ros presents a third option; have Calderwood announce she will back Highland Life, {{while at the same time}} she will convince Meynell to bet against it. Such a plan would financially ruin Meynell. The next morning however, Darlek realises she is MI5 and threatens to kill her if Calderwood does not back down. Ros fights the gun off and Calderwood goes ahead with her statement. Later, Lucas releases Elizabeta as an asset. Meanwhile, Jo Portman (Miranda Raison) believes Boscard (Gus Gallagher), her captor from the end of series six, is still alive after seeing several hallucinations of him. Later, Ros puts her mind at rest when she shows Jo photographic evidence Boscard is indeed dead, and it was Jo who killed him.|$|E
5|$|Wenger's {{preparations}} for the 2011–12 season were disrupted by player unrest. Though he insisted none of his top players would leave the club, Fàbregas eventually moved to Barcelona, while Gaël Clichy and Samir Nasri joined Manchester City. Suspensions and injuries left Wenger fielding an understrength side against Manchester United on 29 August 2011; Arsenal were trounced 8–2, which represented their worst defeat in 115 years. Needing to address the squad's lack of depth, Wenger completed a series <b>of</b> <b>deals</b> {{in the final days}} of the summer transfer window. He mostly brought in experienced players, such as Yossi Benayoun on loan from Chelsea, Everton's Mikel Arteta and Germany international Per Mertesacker. By October, Arsenal had made their worst start to a season in 58 years, losing four of their opening seven matches. However, the team soon harmonised, and in the same month club captain Robin van Persie scored a hat-trick as Arsenal beat Chelsea 5–3. Despite another season of no silverware, Wenger guided Arsenal to third position in the Premier League, thus qualifying for the Champions League for a 15th successive campaign. Van Persie had scored 37 goals, in his first injury-free season for the club. He, however, grew disillusioned with Arsenal's transfer policy, and decided not to renew his contract, with one year remaining. When Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson learnt of the situation, he called Wenger to push through a deal and Van Persie agreed to join Manchester United in August 2012. The club purchased strikers Olivier Giroud and Lukas Podolski in anticipation of the sale.|$|E

25|$|Blackjack can {{be played}} in tournament form. Players start with an equal numbers of chips; {{the goal is to}} finish among the top chip-holders.

Another tournament format, Elimination Blackjack, drops the lowest-stacked player from the table at pre-determined points in the tournament. Good strategy for blackjack tournaments can differ from non-tournament strategy because of the added dimension of choosing the amount to be wagered. As in poker tournaments, players pay the casino an initial entry fee to participate in a tournament, and re-buys are sometimes permitted.|$|E

25|$|Total US {{investment}} in venture capital amounted to US$48.3 billion in 2014, for 4 356 deals. This represented ‘an increase of 61% in dollars and a 4% increase in deals over the prior year,’ reported the National Venture Capital Association. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development estimates that venture capital {{investment in}} the United States had fully recovered by 2014 to pre-recession levels. The National Venture Capital Association has reported that, in 2014, venture capital {{investment in the}} life sciences was at its highest level since 2008: in biotechnology, $6.0 billion was invested in 470 deals and, in life sciences overall, $8.6 billion in 789 deals (including biotechnology and medical devices). Two-thirds (68%) of the investment in biotechnology went to first-time/early-stage development deals and the remainder to the expansion stage of development (14%), seed-stage companies (11%) and late-stage companies (7%). However, it was the software industry which invested in the greatest number <b>of</b> <b>deals</b> overall: 1 799, for an investment of $19.8 billion. Second came internet-specific companies, garnering US$11.9 billion in investment through 1 005 deals. Many of these companies are based in the State of California, which alone concentrates 28% of US research.|$|E
500|$|Deals {{completed}} {{during this}} period tended to be smaller and financed less with high yield debt than in other periods. [...] Private equity firms had to cobble together financing made up of bank loans and mezzanine debt, often with higher equity contributions than had been seen. [...] Private equity firms benefited from the lower valuation multiples. [...] As a result, despite the relatively limited activity, those funds that invested during the adverse market conditions delivered attractive returns to investors. [...] Meanwhile, in Europe LBO activity began to increase as the market continued to mature. [...] In 2001, for the first time, European buyout activity exceeded US activity with $44 billion <b>of</b> <b>deals</b> completed in Europe as compared with just $10.7 billion <b>of</b> <b>deals</b> completed in the US.

The band, led by singer Damian Kulash, explained the label's rationale via the band's blog and through an op-ed piece in The New York Times. [...] According to Kulash, EMI disallowed the embeddable play of the video because they only receive royalties for views on the YouTube site itself. He further pleaded to allow embedding of their next video, citing a 90% drop in viewership when EMI disabled embedding on existing videos, affecting the band's own royalties from viewership.|$|E

500|$|While, by contract, Richard Donner {{had major}} {{editorial}} {{control over what}} was theatrically released, the Salkinds had editorial control on what was shown outside of theaters. [...] This was the result <b>of</b> <b>deals</b> {{that had been made}} between the producers and the ABC television network prior to the film's release. [...] Financially, the more footage that was restored for television, the more revenue that could be made for the broadcast (the producers charged by the minute for every bit of footage added back in). [...] During production of the film, Alexander and Ilya Salkind had been relegated to having to sell more and more of their rights back to Warner Bros. in exchange for financial help, which is why Warner Bros. would have theatrical and home video distribution rights. [...] So by 1981 when the television rights reverted to the Salkinds, the producers prepared a 3-hour and 8-minute version for worldwide television reincorporating some 45 minutes of footage and music deleted from the theatrical cut, and specially prepared so that networks and stations can re-edit their own version at their discretion. This edit is commonly known as the [...] "Salkind International Television Cut". [...] All subsequent network television cuts were derived from this version.|$|E

500|$|While the French {{party system}} had been {{dominated}} by polarisation and competition between the clear-cut ideological alternatives of two political blocs in the 1970s, the two blocs had largely moved towards the centre by the mid-1980s. This led many voters to perceive the blocs as more or less indistinguishable, particularly after the Socialists' [...] "austerity turn" [...] (tournant de la rigeur) of 1983, in turn inciting them to seek out to new political alternatives. By October 1982, Le Pen supported the prospect <b>of</b> <b>deals</b> with the mainstream right, provided that the FN {{did not have to}} soften its position on key issues. In the 1983 municipal elections, the centre-right Rally for the Republic (RPR) and centrist Union for French Democracy (UDF) formed alliances with the FN in a number of towns. The most notable result came in the 20th arrondissement of Paris, where Le Pen was elected to the local council with 11% of the vote. Later by-elections kept media attention on the party, and it was for the first time allowed to pose as a viable component of the broader right. In a by-election in Dreux in October, the FN won 17% of the vote. With the choice of defeat to the political left or dealing with the FN, the local RPR and UDF, to a minor national sensation, agreed to form an alliance with the FN, and together won the second round with 55% of the vote. The events in Dreux were a monumental factor for the rise of the FN.|$|E
