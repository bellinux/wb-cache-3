She said to Inside Soap: [...] "I was filming out on location recently with Ace {{and a bunch}} of women came over to him and said, 'God, you're such a horrible man!' It's funny because Ace is such a sweet man - and you haven't even seen the worst of Yusef yet!" [...] Wadia continued: [...] "Let's just say that what happens is the complete opposite <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to see. Zainab and Yusef share a dark and twisted love, and she definitely has feelings for him. It's not true and pure like what she used to have with Masood - and if Yusef manages to get her back to Pakistan, it will be the end for her. I wouldn't be surprised if Zainab ends up in some sort of home to recover from everything that's going to happen." ...|$|E

[...] The UK magazine's editor Paul Pettengale commented: [...] "Based around a points system and six-sided dice, GURPS succeeds better than most 'generic' games. The rules are flexible and its well supported - regardless <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to do with it, you'll probably find a supplement with some advice and background. The game suffers from being a little too detailed at times, and can get bogged down in numbers. Still, it's an adaptable system with some superb supplements." ...|$|E

60|$|Mr. Mayor and Gentlemen,--It must be {{a matter}} of sincere {{satisfaction}} to those who, like myself, have for many years past been convinced of the vital importance of technical education to this country to see that that subject is now being taken up by {{some of the most important}} of our manufacturing towns. The evidence which is afforded of the public interest in the matter by such meetings as those at Liverpool and Newcastle, and, last but not least, by that at which I have the honour to be present to-day, may convince us all, I think, that the question has passed out of the region of speculation into that of action. I need hardly say to any one here that the task which our Association contemplates is not only one of primary importance--I may say of vital importance--to the welfare of the country; but that it is one of great extent and of vast difficulty. There is a well-worn adage that those who set out upon a great enterprise would do well to count the cost. I am not sure that this is always true. I think that some of the very greatest enterprises in this world have been carried out successfully simply because the people who undertook them did not count the cost; and I am much of opinion that, in this very case, the most instructive consideration for us is the cost of doing nothing. But there is one thing that is perfectly certain, and it is that, in undertaking all enterprises, one of the most important conditions of success is to have a perfectly clear comprehension <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to do--to have that before your minds before you set out, and from that point of view to consider carefully the measures which are best adapted to the end.|$|E
