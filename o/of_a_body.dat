However, the description of her lap contains inconsistencies also in Campin's Virgin and Child before a Firescreen; it appears to lack volume and is if she had only one leg.

40|$|AbstractIn {{my paper}} (Proc. Roy. Soc. Edinburgh Sect. A 64 (1956), 223 – 238), I gave a general {{transfer}} principle in {{the geometry of}} numbers which consisted of inequalities linking the successive minima <b>of</b> <b>a</b> convex <b>body</b> in n dimensions with those <b>of</b> <b>a</b> convex <b>body</b> in N dimensions where in general N is greater than n. This result contained in particular my earlier theorem on compound convex bodies (Proc. London Math. Soc. (3) 5 (1955), 358 – 379). In the present paper I apply essentially the same method to prove a new transfer principle which connects the successive minima <b>of</b> <b>a</b> convex <b>body</b> in m dimensions and those <b>of</b> <b>a</b> convex <b>body</b> in n dimensions with the successive minima <b>of</b> <b>a</b> convex <b>body</b> in mn dimensions...|$|R

2500|$|Physicists and mathematicians {{appear to}} be less {{inclined}} to use the popular concept of inertia as [...] "a tendency to maintain momentum" [...] and instead favor the mathematically useful definition of inertia as the measure <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>body's</b> resistance to changes in velocity or simply <b>a</b> <b>body's</b> inertial mass.|$|R
5|$|The {{equivalence}} between {{mass and}} energy, as {{expressed by the}} formula E=mc, is the most famous consequence of special relativity. In relativity, mass and energy are two different ways of describing one physical quantity. If a physical system has energy, {{it also has the}} corresponding mass, and vice versa. In particular, all properties <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>body</b> that are associated with energy, such as its temperature or the binding energy of systems such as nuclei or molecules, contribute to that body's mass, and hence act as sources of gravity.|$|E

Differentiation itself is evaluated indirectly, by the mineralogy <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>body's</b> surface, versus its expected bulk density and mineralogy, or via shape effects due to slight variations in gravity. Differentiation may also be measured directly, by the higher-order terms <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>body's</b> gravity field as measured by a flyby or gravitational assist, and in some cases by librations.|$|R
5|$|Alan Stern and Harold F. Levison {{introduced}} a parameter Λ (lambda), expressing {{the likelihood of}} an encounter resulting in a given deflection of orbit.

5|$|Back in 1866, as the {{composer}} of The Brandenburgers with its overtones of German military aggression, Smetana {{thought he might}} be targeted by the invading Prussians, so he absented himself from Prague until hostilities ceased. He returned in September, and almost immediately achieved a long-standing ambition—appointment as principal conductor of the Provisional Theatre, at an annual salary of 1,200gulden. In the absence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>body</b> of suitable Czech opera, Smetana in his first season presented standard works by Weber, Mozart, Donizetti, Rossini and Glinka, with a revival of his own Bartered Bride. The quality of Smetana's production of Glinka's A Life for the Tsar angered Glinka's champion Mily Balakirev, who expressed himself forcefully. This caused prolonged hostility between the two men. On 16May 1868 Smetana, representing Czech musicians, helped to lay the foundation stone for the future National Theatre; he had written a Festive Overture for the occasion. That same evening Smetana's third opera, Dalibor, was premièred at Prague's New Town Theatre. Although its initial reception was warm its reviews were poor, and Smetana resigned himself to its failure.|$|E

5|$|Concepts {{related to}} force include: thrust, which {{increases}} the velocity of an object; drag, which decreases the velocity of an object; and torque, which produces changes in rotational speed of an object. In an extended body, each part usually applies forces on the adjacent parts; the distribution of such forces through the body is the internal mechanical stress. Such internal mechanical stresses cause no accelation of that body as the forces balance one another. Pressure, the distribution of many small forces applied over an area <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>body,</b> is a simple type of stress that if unbalanced can cause the body to accelerate. Stress usually causes deformation of solid materials, or flow in fluids.|$|E

This philosophy presented another strong current of devotion, pervading the lives of millions, similar {{to the effects of}} the Veerashaiva movement of the 12th century. The haridasas conveyed the message of Madhvacharya through esoteric Sanskrit writings (written by Vyasa kuta or Vyasa school) and simple Kannada language compositions, appealing to the common man, in the form of devotional songs (written by the Dasa Kuta or Dasa school). The philosophy of Madhvacharya was spread by eminent disciples such as Naraharitirtha, Jayatirtha, Vyasatirtha, Sripadaraya, Vadirajatirtha, Purandara Dasa, Kanaka Dasa and others.|$|E

He designated specific areas where water could be drawn for use in royal circumcision ceremonies. Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana also created three formal ways of pronouncing a sacred and binding oath; these included the mively rano (striking the surface <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>body</b> of water with a stick), the milefon'omby (striking a calf with a spear) and the misotro vokaka (drinking water mixed with ashes taken from a king's tomb).
