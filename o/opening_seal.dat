After reaching orbit and venting, a large access hatch {{in the top of the}} S-II's hydrogen tank would be opened. The cylindrical cargo module would then be inserted hydraulically into the tank through this <b>opening,</b> <b>sealed,</b> and then the tank would be repressurized to form a large living space.

Forty patients of 18 – 70  years of age in the ASA I-II risk classification were included in the study. Patients with morbid obesity (BMI exceeding 30  kg/m 2), history of cardiac, pulmonary, hepato-renal, endocrine, cerebrovascular and neuromuscular diseases or thoracic surgery were excluded.

An invitation is offered for one astronaut to follow the Martians to their new home.

25|$|Bladder traps are {{exclusive}} to the genus Utricularia, or bladderworts. The bladders (vesicula) pump ions {{out of their}} interiors. Water follows by osmosis, generating a partial vacuum inside the bladder. The bladder has a small <b>opening,</b> <b>sealed</b> by a hinged door. In aquatic species, the door has a pair of long trigger hairs. Aquatic invertebrates such as Daphnia touch these hairs and deform the door by lever action, releasing the vacuum. The invertebrate is sucked into the bladder, where it is digested. Many species of Utricularia (such as U. sandersonii) are terrestrial, growing in waterlogged soil, and their trapping mechanism is triggered {{in a slightly different}} manner. Bladderworts lack roots, but terrestrial species have anchoring stems that resemble roots. Temperate aquatic bladderworts generally die back to a resting turion during the winter months, and U. macrorhiza appears to regulate the number of bladders it bears in response to the prevailing nutrient content of its habitat.|$|R

Once several different mock-ups of the chosen concept were made, they were presented to the user. His feedback then informed the design of a second round of prototypes.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the biomechanical preparation of flattened root canals using the following systems: Endo-Eze AET stainless steel oscillatory instruments (Ultradent) and RaCe rotary NiTi instruments (FKG Dentaire). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty extracted human mandibular incisors were randomly assigned to two groups: Group 1 - Instrumentation with oscillatory Endo-Eze AET files (oscillatory technique); Group 2 - Instrumentation with rotary NiTi RaCe files (rotary technique). The teeth were decoronated, had their apices and coronal <b>openings</b> <b>sealed</b> with sticky wax and were embedded in crystal-clear orthophtalic polyester resin. The roots were sectioned transversally with diamond discs at 10 mm (middle third) and 5 mm (apical third) from the apex and the segments were reassembled for instrumentation. The sections were photographed before and after root canal instrumentation and evaluated with respect to whether the original root canal shape was modified by instrumentation. To evaluate the differences in the root canal shape before and after biomechanical preparation, scores were given regarding the instruments touch on the intracanal walls. RESULTS: In middle third of the root canals instrumented with the rotary system, there was a change in the original canal anatomy (p 0. 05). CONCLUSION: Under the tested conditions, Endo-Eze oscillatory system yielded the instrumentation of all flattened root canal walls, maintaining the canal original shape throughout the biomechanical preparation, and was more effective than RaCe rotary system...|$|R
