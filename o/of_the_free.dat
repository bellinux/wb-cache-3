5|$|Although zinc is an {{essential}} requirement for good health, excess zinc can be harmful. Excessive absorption of zinc suppresses copper and iron absorption. The free zinc ion in solution is highly toxic to plants, invertebrates, and even vertebrate fish. The Free Ion Activity Model is well-established in the literature, and shows that just micromolar amounts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>free</b> ion kills some organisms. A recent example showed 6 micromolar killing 93% of all Daphnia in water.|$|E

Other estimates of the oceanic contribution to atmospheric oxygen are higher, while some estimates are lower, suggesting oceans produce ~45% of Earth's atmospheric oxygen each year.|$|E
