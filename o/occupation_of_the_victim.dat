Construction workers are exposed {{to a wide variety of}} hazards. This study analyzes 1, 117 expert witness reports which were submitted to criminal and labour courts. These reports are from all regions of the country and cover the period 1972 – 2008. Accidents were classified by the consequence of the incident, time and main causes of the accident, construction type, <b>occupation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim,</b> activity at time of the ac-cident and party responsible for the accident. Falls (54. 1 %), struck by thrown/falling object (12. 9 %), structural collapses (9. 9 %) and electrocutions (7. 5 %) rank first four places. The accidents were most likely between the hours 15 : 00 and 17 : 00 (22. 6 %), 10 : 00 – 12 : 00 (18. 7 %) and just after the lunchtime (9. 9 %). Additionally, the most common accidents were further divided into sub-types. Expert-witness assessments were used to identify the parties at fault and what acts of negligence typically lead to accidents. Nearly two thirds of the faulty and negligent acts are carried out by the employers and employees are responsible for almost one third of all cases...|$|E
40|$|The suicide {{rates in}} Itabira, {{a city with}} 100, 000 inhabitants, are {{higher than those of}} the Brazilian population. To {{understand}} the phenomenon we investigated morbidity and mortality through a descriptive epidemiological study, with emphasis to external causes and specific subgroups. Suicide was studied according to the characteristics of victims and events. The period studied was 1990 - 2001. Mortality data were collected from the Mortality Information System and morbidity data for the year 2000 from the Hospital Admission Authorization System. An active data search on suicide over the period 1996 - 2001 based on sex, age and <b>occupation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim,</b> month of occurrence and method used in completed and attempted suicides was conducted at the local notary's office and at the state police headquarters. Based on these data we calculated proportions, rates and mean values. The populations used for calculating the rates were extracted from the DATASUS base. Results indicated an increasing tendency to suicide among men, coinciding with the economical crisis caused by the reorganization of the iron production process in this mono-industrial city. Suicide attempts were more frequent among housewives, housekeepers and students. The mostly used methods were hanging and firearms. Relevant means used in suicide attempts were nonmedicinal substances, drugs and medicaments...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND Head {{injury is}} {{an injury to}} scalp, skull and/or {{contents}} of skull. Injury to scalp maybe {{in the form of}} abrasion, contusion or laceration. Common types of skull fractures are simple linear fracture, depressed, base of skull fracture and orbital/blow out fracture. CT scan has been the investigation of choice in head injury cases. Simple linear fracture of skull cases usually require CT scanning. Base of skull fractures are visible in bone window axial CT scans. Cerebral contusions in CT scan appear as small area of haemorrhage in cerebral parenchyma. Intracerebral haematomas appear as hyperdense lesions on CT with associated mass effect and midline shift. Extradural haematomas appear convex in shape on CT and do not expand past suture lines. Subdural haematomas in CT classically appear crescent shaped. Acute bleed are hyperdense whereas chronic bleed can be isodense. A sincere effort has been put in this study to understand the epidemiology and evaluation of head injury following RTA. This study is intended to help the fellow practicing radiological fraternity. MATERIALS AND METHODS Forty three cases were taken up for the study and evaluated by the CT scan of head. Ten axial sections from the base of skull were taken and evaluated. The information collected include age, sex, occupation, alcohol consumption, type of vehicle involved, clinical presentation, CT findings. RESULTS Male sex had the highest incidence of head injury, which accounted for thirty four cases. The age group of twenty one to forty years accounted for highest number of cases in this study, which accounted to twenty four cases. Based on the <b>occupation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim,</b> the labourers suffered maximum number of head injuries in RTA, which accounted for twelve admissions. In this study, twenty one percent of the victims had consumed alcohol, which amounted to nine in number. Based on the type of vehicle involved two wheelers amounted to eighteen cases. Based on clinical presentation of the victim following RTA, thirty three cases presented with headache. The CT findings of the cases studied showed skull fractures in nineteen cases. CONCLUSION In this study, it was noted that incidence of head injuries following RTA was more in the age group of twenty one to forty years. It was also noted that male sex outweighed the female sex...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{quantitative}} study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> genocide in <b>the</b> prefecture <b>of</b> Kibuye in Rwanda in 1994. We use an original data base developed by <b>the</b> organisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> survivors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> genocide (IBUKA) who collected the data by house-to-house fieldwork. The data contain {{information on the}} age, sex, commune <b>of</b> residence before <b>the</b> genocide, <b>the</b> professional <b>occupation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims,</b> <b>the</b> place and date <b>of</b> death and <b>the</b> weapon used to kill, {{for a total of}} 59. 050 victims of genocide. For one commune (Mabanza), we re-coded the data, present detailed statistics and perform an analysis of survival chances. From the analysis, we derive that Tutsi from <b>the</b> sectors <b>of</b> Mabanza commune whose Tutsi population did not (or only in limited numbers) go to the Gatwaro Stadium had a better chance to survive the genocide in Kibuye. For <b>the</b> whole <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prefecture, we present an estimation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> daily killing rate, estimations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> Tutsi killed in the major massacres and the weapons used.

40|$|Abstract: Research on {{occupational}} accidents {{on construction}} sites in Turkey is very few. Moreover, research on motor vehicle and equipment accidents {{also do not}} exist. Investigation in <b>the</b> scope <b>of</b> this study shows that after falls and contact with electricity, accidents involving heavy equipment and motor vehicles rank third and fourth, respectively. This study aims to reveal <b>the</b> characteristics <b>of</b> these types <b>of</b> accidents, deduct <b>the</b> prominent causes that lead to fatalities as well as permanent disabilities using the present data. With <b>the</b> aid <b>of</b> obtained results, recommendations are made for safety experts on how to derive data from insufficient sources in Turkey and to evaluate these data for prevention and mitigation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> risks that construction workers are exposed to. 168 fatal and 38 non-fatal traffic accident-caused incidents as well as 206 fatal and 97 non-fatal construction equipment accidents, which were selected from official statistics and expert reports, were taken into consideration. Analysis and classification of these accidents were done according {{to the way they}} happened, <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> construction site and <b>the</b> <b>occupation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims.</b> Moreover, <b>the</b> leading causes <b>of</b> fatal and non-fatal injuries, to which drivers, operators and co-operators are exposed, are presented.

40|$|After {{attending}} this presentation, attendees {{will understand}} that forensic investigations {{are based on a}} multidisciplinary approach in which autopsy findings and toxicological results often result in association with circumstances and crime scene investigations. This presentation will impact the forensic science community by demonstrating how recreational abuse of anesthetic and sedative agents in health care practitioners, especially anesthesiologists is an increasing event. This presentation will also show an unusual case of suicide in which the manner and means of suicide was dependent upon the <b>occupation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim.</b> Presented is a case of a 50 -year-old man, anesthetist at the main local hospital, who was found dead in the house where he lived alone since separating from his wife. On the previous evening he was found on the landing’s floor with an occipital bruise injury and treated in the Emergency Department. The next day his brother, alerted by his colleagues that tried in vain to contact him, went to his house. He found that the front door had been left ajar, with a piece of furniture behind it. When he entered the flat, he noticed the corpse of the brother, supine on the living room’s floor near a piece of furniture. There were two drips with intravenous tubes almost empty (approximately 1 ml). One drip was still inserted in the dorsum of the victim’s right hand with tube for intravenous drip totally open. On the glass of this drip there was written “Miclela Caput” (meaning “Caput Mixture,” written incorrectly). On the glass of the other drip there was written “ 500 TPS+ 200 DIPR” (meaning Sodium Thiopental+Diprivan). In the house there were some empty blisters of Zolpidem, more than 20 packs of different drugs (some of them empty), an ash-tray containing white liquid, several empty ampoules of Propofol, Midazolam and Thiopental, and several new and used syringes. In the bedroom there were two knapsacks containing pornographic materials and four plastic phalli. External examination revealed abundant livor mortis, numerous recent needle marks with fresh and older hemorrhages in both arms, and a sutured occipital injury. Autopsy and histological findings were pulmonary and brain oedema, moderate fatty liver, acute poly-visceral congestion, hemorrhagic pancreatitis. Systematic toxicological analysis was performed on biological and non biological samples for alcohol, drugs of abuse and pharmaceuticals. Blood toxicological examination by GC/MS revealed lethal concentration of Zolpidem (0. 86 μg/ml) and high therapeutic blood concentrations of Propofol (0. 30 μg/ml), Midazolam (0. 08 μg/ml), Amitriptyline (0. 07 μg/ml), and low concentration of Thiopental (0. 03 μg/ml). Zolpidem was also found in gastric content while Thiopental was found in urine. Hair segment analysis (0 – 2 cm) revealed Propofol (4, 7 μg/mg) and the presence of Zolpidem, Amitriptyline and Ketoprofen. Residual’s toxicological analysis of the inserted drip (“Caput mixture”) revealed Propofol and Midazolam (approximately 1, 9 and 0, 08 mg/ml). Analysis of the non-inserted drip, showed Propofol and Thiopental (approximately 2 and 5 mg/ml). The low blood concentration of Thiopental suggests a self administration of the non-inserted drip at least 12 hours before death. The blood Propofol level was lower than or within the commonly accepted therapeutic range of 1. 3 – 6. 8 μg/ml after a standard anesthetic induction dose. Published reports indicate that in most cases, the postmortem Propofol concentrations were at therapeutic levels. It {{should be pointed out that}} especially for those agents used in anesthesia; the therapeutic concentrations refer to patients being supported respiratorywise, while in non-supported or non-intubated patients such concentrations may be lethal. Most of those deaths are thought to have occurred because of the rapidity of Propofol’s injection which led to apnea and death. A mere interpretation of the blood and tissue concentrations of Propofol in the toxicological analysis may be of limited diagnostic significance without taking into account the before mentioned reports. Toxicological analysis of hair confirmed the recreational abuse of Propofol. These anesthetic and sedative drugs are often used in combination for anesthesia’s induction. All of these act synergistically in combination and may induce respiratory depression. This effect depends on individual susceptibility, on dose used and, especially for Propofol and Midazolam, infusion’s rapidity. In conclusion, the victim was administered a solution of anesthetic drugs, rapidly infused in a lethal combination and simultaneously a hypnotic drug in lethal dose...|$|E
