Some examples of the urban effects on climate are urban heat island, <b>oasis</b> <b>effect,</b> greenhouse gases, and acid rain. This further stirs the debate as to whether urban areas should be considered a unique biome. Despite common trends among all urban centers, the surrounding local environment heavily influences much of the climate.

Even though it is north of the Arctic tree line, the area supports thick white spruce tree groves, raspberry, currant, and columbine plants, along with tall alluvial dwarf willow thickets and tag alder.

40|$|We {{quantified}} the spatio-temporal {{patterns of}} land cover/land use (LCLU) change to document {{and evaluate the}} daytime surface urban heat island (SUHI) for five hot subtropical desert cities (Beer Sheva, Israel; Hotan, China; Jodhpur, India; Kharga, Egypt; and Las Vegas, NV, USA). Sequential Landsat images were acquired and classified into the USGS 24 -category Land Use Categories using object-based image analysis with an overall accuracy of 80 % to 95. 5 %. We estimated the land surface temperature (LST) of all available Landsat data from June to August for years 1990, 2000, and 2010 and computed the urban-rural difference in the average LST and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for each city. Leveraging non-parametric statistical analysis, we also investigated the impacts of city size and population on the urban-rural difference in the summer daytime LST and NDVI. Urban expansion is observed for all five cities, but the urbanization pattern varies widely from city to city. A negative SUHI effect or an <b>oasis</b> <b>effect</b> exists for all the cities across all three years, and the amplitude of the <b>oasis</b> <b>effect</b> tends to increase as the urban-rural NDVI difference increases. A strong <b>oasis</b> <b>effect</b> is observed for Hotan and Kharga with evidently larger NDVI difference than the other cities. Larger cities {{tend to have a}} weaker cooling effect while a negative association is identified between NDVI difference and population. Understanding the daytime <b>oasis</b> <b>effect</b> of desert cities is vital for sustainable urban planning and the design of adaptive management, providing valuable guidelines to foster smart desert cities in an era of climate variability, uncertainty, and change...|$|E
40|$|The oases in the mountain-basin {{systems of}} Central Asia are {{extremely}} fragile. Investigating <b>oasis</b> <b>effects</b> and oasis-desert interactions {{is important for}} understanding the ecological stability of oases. However, previous studies have been performed only in oasis-desert environments and have not considered the impacts of mountains. In this study, <b>oasis</b> <b>effects</b> were explored {{in the context of}} mountain effects in the northern Tianshan Mountains (NTM) using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Four numerical simulations are performed. The def simulation uses the default terrestrial datasets provided by the WRF model. The mod simulation uses actual terrestrial datasets from satellite products. The non-oasis simulation is a scenario simulation in which oasis areas are replaced by desert conditions, while all other conditions are the same as the mod simulation. Finally, the non-mountain simulation is a scenario simulation in which the elevation values of all grids are set to a constant value of 300 m, while all other conditions are the same as in the mod simulation. The mod simulation agrees well with near-surface measurements of temperature, relative humidity and latent heat flux. The Tianshan Mountains exert a cooling and wetting effects in the NTM region. The oasis breeze circulation (OBC) between oases and the deserts is counteracted by the stronger background circulation. Thus, the self-supporting mechanism of oases originating from the OBC plays a limited role in maintaining the ecological stability of oases in this mountain-basin system. However, the mountain wind causes the “cold-wet’’ island effects of the oases to extend into the oasis-desert transition zone at night, which is beneficial for plants in the transition region...|$|R

40|$|Because {{of the use}} of {{outdated}} terrestrial datasets, regional {{climate models}} (RCMs) have a limited ability to accurately simulate weather and climate conditions over heterogeneous oasis-desert systems, especially near large mountains. Using actual terrestrial datasets from satellite products for RCMs is the only possible solution to the limitation; however, it is impractical for long-period simulations due to the limited satellite products available before 2000 and the extremely time- and labor-consuming processes involved. In this study, we used the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model with observed estimates of land use (LU), albedo, Leaf Area Index (LAI), and green Vegetation Fraction (VF) datasets from satellite products to examine which terrestrial datasets have a great impact on simulating water and heat conditions over heterogeneous oasis-desert systems in the northern Tianshan Mountains. Five simulations were conducted for 1 – 31 July in both 2010 and 2012. The decrease in the root mean squared error and increase in the coefficient of determination for the 2 m temperature (T 2), humidity (RH), latent heat flux (LE), and wind speed (WS) suggest that these datasets improve the performance of WRF in both years; in particular, <b>oasis</b> <b>effects</b> are more realistically simulated. Using actual satellite-derived fractional vegetation coverage data has a much greater effect on the simulation of T 2, RH, and LE than the other parameters, resulting in mean error correction values of 62 %, 87 %, and 92 %, respectively. LU data is the primary parameter because it strongly influences other secondary land surface parameters, such as LAI and albedo. We conclude that actual LU and VF data should be used in the WRF for both weather and climate simulations...|$|R

40|$|A b s t r a c t. In Greece, {{crops are}} {{frequently}} cultivated in small isolated areas {{in close proximity}} to roads and bare soils and therefore evapotranspiration is affected by local advection. Under these circumstances, <b>oasis</b> <b>effect</b> conditions are present and evapo-transpiration is higher than what is expected. In this paper, the evapotranspiration and soil water dynamics of a cotton crop culti-vated in small areas under the <b>oasis</b> <b>effect</b> is studied. To this end, two isolated free-drainage lysimeters cultivated with cotton in the year 2007 were used. Soil moisture of the soil profile of both the lysimeters was monitored with two capacitance water content pro-bes. The soil water balance method was used to estimate crop eva-potranspiration and corresponding crop coefficients in one of the two lysimeters. These coefficients were 75 % larger than the FAO- 56 crop coefficients at the mid-season stage. The FAO- 56 and the derived crop coefficients were used for the simulation of the water dynamics in the second lysimeter by the SWBACROS model. The derived crop coefficients for these conditions produced much better results than the FAO- 56 crop coefficients. The results were improved when crop coefficient value equal to 2. 5 was used for the mid-season stage.

While basic dynamic and thermodynamic processes for oasis self-maintaining in the desert environment is well investigated, influence of heterogeneous landscapes of oasis interior on the processes are still important and remain to be investigated. In this study, two simulations are designed for investigating the influence of inhomogeneity. In the first case, land surface parameters including land-use types, vegetation cover fraction, and surface layer soil moisture are derived by satellite remote sensing data from EOS/MODIS, and then be used specify the respective options in the MM 5 model, to describe a real inhomogeneity for the oasis interior. In the other run, land use types are set to MM 5 default, in which landscapes in the oasis interior is relative uniform, and then surface layer soil moisture and vegetation fraction is set to be averages of the first case for the respective oasis and desert surface lying, to represent a relative homogeneity. Results show that the inhomogeneity leads to a weaker <b>oasis</b> "cold-wet island" <b>effect</b> and a stronger turbulence over the oasis interior, both of which will reduce the oasis-desert secondary circulation and increase the evaporation over the oasis, resulting in {{a negative impact on}} the oasis self-protecting mechanism.

We use a climate model to investigate the effectiveness of various urban heat mitigation strategies: cool roofs, street vegetation, green roofs, and reflective pavement.

The objective of our {{study was to determine}} environmental and climatic factors associ­ated with the risk of WNV equine seropositivity in Iran. Methods: Serological data were obtained from a serosurvey conducted in equine population in 260 districts in Iran. The climate and environmental parameters included in the models were distance to the nearest wetland area, type of stable, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), annual mean temperature, humidity and precipitation. Results: The important risk factors included annual mean temperature, distance to wetlands, local and seasonal NDVI differences. The effect of local NDVI differences in spring was particularly notable. This was a normalized difference of average NDVI between two areas: a 5 km radius area centered on the stable and the 5 – 10 km sur­rounding area.

Covering of water bodies can help in reducing evaporation. The work presented in this study aims at investigating the use of palm fronds as shaded cover for the reduction of evaporation from the open water surface so as to increase the storage efficiency. The material used for cover was locally available palm fronds which are a massive agricultural waste and environmental friendly by-product in Saudi Arabia.

Initially a single layer of cover was used as shaded cover which was replaced by a cover of two layers of palm fronds in order to see the effect of thickness of cover on overall evaporation. It was observed that the average reduction in evaporation in the covered pan (with single layer of cover) was about 47 % as compared to the evaporation from the open pan.

40|$|Observation {{of number}} {{concentration}} of aerosol {{particles in the}} south of the Taklimakan Desert, China, was conducted using optical particle counter (OPC). Observations were made in the edge of the small oasis Qira, which is located in the southern Tarim Basin, during the springtime in 2002, 2003, and 2004. For the comparison of regional changes, observation at gobi desert, which is 13. 7 km southeast of the oasis site, was also conducted in July 2002. It was found that the number concentration of aerosol particles, especially in the coarse particles, showed significant increases after the duststorm. Averaged number concentrations of aerosol particles in April 2002, March 2003, and March to April 2004 indicate that 1) a local maximum number concentration at 2 to 3 pin diameter is commonly found and 2) the coarse particle larger than 5 mu n diameter is dominant in the each volume size distribution. However, annual variation of number concentrations during springtime is large. This is because the emission of dust particle of each year strongly depends on the magnitude and the number of duststorm event. The time variations of number concentration of aerosol particles at the oasis site and the gobi site showed a good coincidence with those of coarse particles larger than 1 pm diameter. It is suggested that these variations are not controlled by the local circulation induced by the <b>oasis</b> <b>effect</b> but by the diurnal circulation between the Kunlun Mountains and the Tarim Basin...|$|E

Minilysimeters installed in a green (mowing height 3 – 5 mm) and fairway (15 mm) were weighed during four periods of 4 – 10 days duration in 2009 and 2010. Crop coefficients on the second and subsequent days after irrigation {{were not significantly different}} among species and averaged 0. 81 and 0. 91 on green and fairway, respectively.

40|$|In {{many parts}} of the world, the {{available}} water resources are now being used close to their limits. Global climate change, the increasing population of the earth and ever-increasing standards of living and consequent growing demand of water are bringing water sustainability into sharp focus. Evaporation as a major component of the hydrologic cycle, is the largest one of water loss from lakes especially in arid and semi-arid regions. Because of lacking of understanding of the thermodynamics of atmospheric boundary layer(ABL) and heat exchange between the water surface and atmosphere, an accurate estimation of evaporation from water surfaces is almost unknown. It is thus of major importance to have precise estimation of the amount of this undesirable, unrecoverable and unproductive water loss from water body for a good management of available water resources. However, most of the models so far described in the literature are one-dimensional with areal homogeneity assumption and can be used for long-term estimations. In the framework of this study, a numerical approach was developed to predict evaporation from shallow and small lakes in (semi-) arid regions considering the heat and water vapor exchanges process between the air-water surface. The model takes into account advection, <b>oasis</b> <b>effect</b> and stability conditions of ABL in the heat exchange process. To have a precise estimation of evaporation the effects of the terrain surrounding the water body, the water body size and the effects of the available fetch of water body were implemented in the model.

40|$|AbstractThe {{microclimate}} and {{air quality}} in urban spaces {{are of a}} great interest {{for the well-being of}} citizens. Mitigating urban heat island is a major concern for human health by improving comfort especially in desert regions. While the thermal comfort is relatively easy to obtain in indoor spaces, it is more difficult to provide in outdoor ones. It is often sought by passive means. Vegetation could {{play an important role in}} ameliorating urban microclimates. It should be used judiciously in urban planning and designing outdoor spaces. The objective of this work is to explore the influence of green cover during summer on microclimate in the region of Ben-Isguen, a city of a hot-arid climate in the M’ zab valley, Ghardaïa (Algeria). Many studies have proved that vegetation can produce a cooling effect of 2 to 3 °C on average. Gardens and urban parks in particular, in and around cities contribute to alleviating heat stress by creating the so-called “oasis effect” through public spaces. They improve thermal comfort and reduce cooling energy consumption. The microclimate of different locations, in both green and built-up areas (old town, palm grove, etc.) was characterized with the help of field measurements carried out during summer days. The results confirmed the presence of an important cooling effect of vegetation (PCI). It was shown that it is essentially a nocturnal phenomenon by displaying a maximum value of 10 °C. This result is very important regarding the results of similar studies. The research demonstrated that the <b>oasis</b> <b>effect</b> is best developed around dawn in calm and clear sky conditions. Maximum daytime cooling effect of the green cover was 4. 5 °C in reference to old town. Nevertheless this effect showed fluctuation so that it displayed negative values by moments. The cooling effect of the palm grove is due to shade foliage, evapotranspiration, low heat capacity of vegetation and high aerodynamic roughness. In fact the oasis acts as a “heat sink”. The old town of Ben-Isguen presented a diurnal heat island and a nocturnal cool island with maximum intensity of 3. 5 °C and 4 °C respectively. The investigation of the oasis microclimate revealed that densely vegetated areas display higher cooling effect. The latter varied among different areas due to shade conditions, density of vegetation, sky view factor (SVF), soil characteristics and water surface availabilit...|$|E

The effect of soil fertility {{and texture of}} crop coefficient and evapotranspiration of maize was investigated in this study. Low soil fertility and food shortages as a stressful environment for plants that makes it different evapotranspiration rates of evapotranspiration calculation {{is based on the}} FAO publication 56. Razzaghi et al. (2012) investigate the effect of soil type and soil-drying during the seed-filling phase on N-uptake, yield and water use, a Danish-bred cultivar (CV. Titicaca) was grown in field lysimeters with sand, sandy loam and sandy clay loam soil. Zhang et al (2014) were investigated the Effect of adding different amounts of nitrogen during three years (from 2010 to 2012) on water use efficiency and crop evapotranspiration two varieties of winter wheat. The results of their study showed. The results indicated the following: (1) in this dry land farming system, increased N fertilization could raise wheat yield, and the drought-tolerant Changhan No. 58 showed a yield advantage in drought environments with high N fertilizer rates; (2) N application affected water consumption in different soil layers, and promoted wheat absorbing deeper soil water and so increased utilization of soil water; and (3) comprehensive consideration of yield and WUE of wheat indicated that the N rate of 270 kg/ha for Changhan No. 58 was better to avoid the risk of reduced production reduction due to lack of precipitation; however, under conditions of better soil moisture, the N rate of 180 kg/ha was more economic. Materials and Methods: The study was a factorial experiment in a completely randomized design with three soil texture treatment, including silty clay loam, loam and sandy-loam soil and three fertility treatment, including without fertilizer, one and two percent fertilizer(It was conducted at the experimental farm in Jey and Qahab district of Isfahan. Reference evapotranspiration and actual evapotranspiration of maize were measured by evaporation pan method and volumetric soil water balance method using micro lysimeters, respectively. In order to accommodate the growing field conditions, a ditch with a depth of 25 cm, length of 240 cm and width of 300 cm were dug and micro-lysimeters were placed it in three rows (three replications) with a distance of 75 cm.

40|$|The {{transport}} of applied bromide (Br) and soil-generated nitrate (NO 3) through clay soil in large field drainage lysimeters was measured and simulated, under cropped and fallowed conditions. Short-term (four days) and medium-term (up to ten months) field experiments on the lysimeters were conducted. Water inputs were from rainfall and drip irrigation. Laboratory experiments {{were conducted to}} evaluate the effects of moisture and temperature on the rate of net NO 3 production, and to evaluate the denitrifying potential of the soil with depth. Bromide and NO 3 leaching were simulated using transfer function model (TFM) approaches, and in particular, the convective log-normal transfer function (CLT). The objectives of the work were: To model the {{transport of}} applied and indigenous solutes through soil, using transfer function modelling approaches. To parameterise the concentration term of the transfer function model, as affected by biological activity, with special attention to NO 3. To couple models of biological transformations affecting the concentration term of the transfer function to models of solute transport; thereby developing a working model of NO 3 leaching under field conditions. In the simulation approaches used here, the driving variable chosen was cumulative drainage. The lysimeters allowed a comparison of estimates of drainage volumes based on models of evapotranspiration with actual volumes. The Priestley-Taylor model well simulated cumulative drainage with time from fallowed lysimeters, however the required calibration factor (a) was larger {{than that of a}} previous local calibration. A crop factor greater than 1 was required to simulate cumulative drainage from the cropped lysimeters. The large values for a and crop factor suggest that a strong <b>oasis</b> <b>effect</b> prevailed. The break-through curves (BTCs) of Br from the fallowed lysimeters were strongly positively skewed, and approximated log-normal distributions. Three models with different underlying assumptions were applied to the problem of simulating the observed data. When simply fitting the model equations to observed concentration data from the drainage depth, the CLT and convection-dispersion equation fitted the data equally well, and better than the Burns model. However, the transport volume parameter of the Burns equation was able to be estimated independently, and provided a good prediction of cumulative mass of Br leached with drainage. The problem of assigning a normalising mass was identified when fitting models to observed data, and it was recommended that normalising mass be included as a parameter in model calibration procedures. The performance of the three models was tested at depths above the drain, using data collected from suction cup samplers. Comparisons of Br and NO 3 concentrations in soil solutions estimated by suction cup sampling, soil coring and drainage, led {{to the conclusion that the}} suction cup samples mainly represented water from the transport volume. This allowed the construction of effective BTCs at the depths of suction cup installation, assuming spatial uniformity of the flux of either applied solute or water. On the basis of depth-scaling of Br leaching, it appeared that solute transport through this soil followed the assumptions of stochastic convection more so than convection dispersion. Plants exercised a major influence on the transport of solutes. The drainage-dependent BTCs for Br were much broader from the cropped plots than from the fallowed plots, with the arrival of peak concentrations after more drainage. A concept of solute domain contraction was postulated as the mechanism by which the leaching of Br that is not taken up by the plants is delayed. This concept was included in modelling Br leaching by linking the degree of solute domain contraction to transpiration. The CLT model was selected for application to NO 3 leaching. It was found that the outflow concentrations of NO 3 from fallowed lysimeters could be well simulated over the short-term, using a layer approach for the initial concentrations and model parameters derived from Br leaching. Divisions of depth were selected according to monitoring depths of suction cups, and the pattern of the initial profile determined by soil sampling. The layers were then treated as analogous to individual square pulse inputs into the transport volume. The output from individual layers were summed at the drainage depth to obtain a prediction of the concentration of NO 3 in the drainage water. The simulation of NO 3 leaching from fallowed lysimeters over longer periods of time required estimates of net nitrification. The rate of net NO 3 production and input into the transport volume was estimated using a mass balance approach, on the basis of changes in the NO 3 content of the soil and the amount leached, over a period of about two months. Laboratory studies were then used to adjust that rate to periods with different temperature and moisture regimes. Inputs of NO 3 from net nitrification during each season were treated as individual square pulse inputs at 15 cm deep, with the concentration of the input for each period calculated on the basis of amount of drainage, average temperature and periods of dryness. The output of NO 3 from all sources were then added according to the principle of superposition, to give a good prediction of NO 3 leaching losses from fallowed lysimeters. There was very little NO 3 leached from the cropped lysimeters during the cropping phase, only some NO 3 initially present in the profile below the root zone. Not only was the amount of drainage dramatically reduced, the percolating water contained very little NO 3. During the crop phase, NO 3 was quantitatively removed from the transport volume. Therefore, it was unnecessary to include the concept of solute domain contraction in the simulation of NO 3 leaching from the cropped plots. Plant uptake was included in the model as a negative square pulse, firstly removing NO 3 produced from net nitrification, then removing NO 3 leaching from the bottom of the root zone, then removing unleached NO 3 from the initial pool. There was substantially more net nitrification in the cropped plots during the growth period than in the fallowed plots. The calculation of net nitrification included plant uptake, and the additional net NO 3 was probably a result of plant uptake protecting NO 3 from denitrification. The crop mediated net nitrification was included in the model as an added input for the purposes of mass balance. After harvest and a lag period, NO 3 concentrations in the drainage began to build up to similar levels as in the fallowed plots. The lag was assumed to be due to net nitrification occurring well above the drains. The depth for NO 3 input from net nitrification was again set at 15 cm, although a better fit was obtained if set at 45 cm. The Br -calibrated CLT provided excellent predictions of NO 3 leaching losses from the cropped lysimeters. Whilst the fitting of equations to Br BTCs provided models that predicted NO 3 leaching well, it was suggested that literature values for the standard deviation of the log of solute transport velocities, coupled with a BTC-independent estimate of the transport volume, could have been used to parameterise the CLT and Burns models just as effectively.
