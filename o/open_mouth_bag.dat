50|$|There are {{two basic}} designs of bags: open mouth bags and valve bags. An <b>open</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>bag</b> is a tube of paper plies with the bottom end sealed. The bag is filled though the open mouth and then closed by stitching, adhesive, or tape. Valve sacks have both ends closed and are filled through a valve. A typical example of a valve bag is the cement sack.|$|E

40|$|Play {{signals are}} {{commonly}} used by animals to communicate their playful motivation and to limit the risk that rough acts are misunderstood by playmates. The relaxed <b>open</b> <b>mouth</b> {{is the most common}} facial expression performed during play in many mammals and represents the ritualized version of the movement anticipating a play bite. The signaling nature of this expression has been proven in many haplorrhine species but never demonstrated in strepsirrhines. Our purpose was assessing whether, also in strepsirrhines, the relaxed <b>open</b> <b>mouth</b> has an actual communicative function. We studied wild ringtailed lemurs (Lemur catta), characterized by highly social habits including intense playful interactions. They largely use playful signals, mostly performed with the black and white tail. The signaling function of the tail (tail play) has been widely demonstrated. We analyzed both tail play and the relaxed <b>open</b> <b>mouth</b> to verify how their distribution is affected by different play variables (e. g., play session symmetry, number of play mates, previous use of the same pattern). Indeed, ring‐tailed lemurs use the relaxed <b>open</b> <b>mouth</b> as a communicative signal during play. Relaxed <b>open</b> <b>mouth</b> was more frequent during unbalanced interactions showing the highest asymmetry in the patterns performed by the two players (offensive/neutral). Compared to tail play, relaxed <b>open</b> <b>mouth</b> was more frequent during dyadic than polyadic interactions and, as a highly directional signal, it was more frequently replicated by the play mate. Therefore, the relaxed <b>open</b> <b>mouth</b> needs to be performed face‐to‐face so that signal detection can be optimized. Similar to previous findings in monkeys and apes, the relaxed <b>open</b> <b>mouth</b> in lemurs seems to be a ritualized signal used to engage and, perhaps, sustain playful interaction...|$|R

40|$|Fluid {{within the}} tympanic bulla is an {{indication}} of middle ear disease. Radiography has a relatively low accuracy for the detection of soft tissue opacification in the tympanic bulla, and the most useful radiographic projection, the rostrocaudal <b>open</b> <b>mouth</b> (RCd (<b>open</b> <b>mouth)),</b> is technically difficult to perform in dogs and cats. An alternative projection for the feline tympanic bulla, the rostro 10 ° ventro-caudodorsal oblique (R 10 °V-CdDO), was compared to the RCd (<b>open</b> <b>mouth)</b> in 41 feline cadaver heads with the tympanic bullae randomly filled with KY jelly. Computed tomography was used as the gold standard. Each tympanic bulla was recorded as being positive or negative for soft tissue opacification. Although {{there was no significant difference}} between the accuracy of the two views, the R 10 °V-CdDO was subjectively more accurate and easier to perform, and in a live patient may be performed without the need for general anesthesia.
