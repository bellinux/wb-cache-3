40|$|In {{order to}} {{adequately}} account for nanometer effects during tim-ing analysis, archaic standard cell models must be replaced. Sim-plifying assumptions used during characterization, such as nearly linear voltage inputs or lumped-capacitance loads, {{are no longer}} valid. Signal integrity analysis further complicates the character-ization process because the typical voltage waveform used during characterization does not contain a noise component. This paper introduces two new technologies for standard cell and interconnect timing analysis: <b>Blade</b> and <b>Razor.</b> <b>Blade</b> is a novel cell model and runtime engine based on current flow. Razor is the accompanying interconnect model. Both <b>Blade</b> and <b>Razor</b> produce and consume arbitrary voltage waveforms with near-SPICE accuracy at speeds {{tens of thousands of}} times faster than SPICE...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) {{infection}} {{ranks among}} the most devastating health problems in the world. The most probable transmission routes of HBV are blood contact, sexual, and horizontal transfer. Other sources of HBV transmission are razor sharing, beauty treatments, tattooing, piercing, and manicures and other chiropody treatments. Many infections {{have been reported in}} South-East Asia, where barbers commonly share and reuse razors. Detection of HBV DNA in contaminated devices such as <b>razor</b> <b>blades</b> is important in the demonstration of transmission routes and indirect estimation of HBV prevalence in specific subpopulations such as barbershop clientele. Therefore, we aimed to detect the presence of HBV contamination on <b>razor</b> <b>blades</b> by nucleic acid testing. Methods: Used <b>razor</b> <b>blades</b> (n = 151) were purchased from different barber’s shops. Used <b>razor</b> <b>blades</b> purchased from chronic HBV patients (n = 8) were included as a positive control. The amplification and detection of HBV DNA was carried out by a semi-nested PCR method in a thermal cycler. Results: The presence of HBV DNA was found in 10 (6. 6 %) used razor-blade samples by the detection of a specific positive band with agarose gel electrophoresis. Conclusions: In conclusion, used <b>razor</b> <b>blades</b> may be contaminated with HBV, and the practice of sharing used <b>razor</b> <b>blades</b> may pose a risk of transmission. Nucleic acid detection methods involving PCR can be used to detect HBV contamination of <b>razor</b> <b>blades.</b> HBV control and prevention programs should educate barbers about the importance of contagious diseases, proper sterilization techniques, and avoiding reuse and sharing of contaminated equipment and supplies such as <b>razor</b> <b>blades.</b> As an infection control measure, prohibition of razor reuse can reduce the spread of HBV infection in rural areas, where the practice is often common at barbershops...|$|R
50|$|Safety razors {{had been}} {{developed}} in the mid-19th century, but still used a forged blade. In the 1870s, the Kampfe Brothers introduced a type of razor along these lines.

40|$|The {{fracture}} toughness of poly (ethylene terephthalate) modified glycol (PETG) has been evaluated using notch sharpening techniques {{which could be}} grouped into contact and non-contact procedures. <b>Razor</b> <b>blade</b> tapping, <b>razor</b> <b>blade</b> sliding, <b>razor</b> pressing and broaching {{are part of the}} first group, while the femtolaser technique belongs to the second one. Not all the contact procedures generated valid sharp cracks for fracture parameter assessment; indeed none of the samples sharpened via razor sliding generated acceptable sharp cracks. The results revealed that the non-contact femtolaser technique produced the sharpest cracks in this polymer, with crack tip radii of only 0. 5 μm, leading to the lowest {{fracture toughness}} values. On the contrary, the traditional notch sharpening technique based on razor tapping, recommended in ISO, ESIS and ASTM protocols and standards, generated larger crack tip radii than those introduced via femtolaser and, consequently, resulted in higher fracture toughness values. Both broaching and pressing methods created specimens with smaller crack tip radii compared to those obtained by razor tapping, and hence resulting in intermediate fracture toughness values.
