50|$|The Urbana-Champaign Sanitary District <b>sewage</b> <b>outfall</b> {{is located}} on the Saline Branch, just {{downstream}} from where the Boneyard enters that stream. Late in the 1970s, sewage chlorination, required by environmental regulations, was identified as a major negative factor for aquatic life. Although disinfection theoretically reduced the chances of hypothetical bathers contracting disease downstream of a <b>sewage</b> <b>outfall,</b> chlorination also killed most aquatic life for miles downstream. Late in the 1980s, the Sanitary District was allowed to discontinue chlorination. Fish soon returned to the Boneyard, after the chlorine block was removed from the Saline Branch. The fish, however, live a tenuous life on the Boneyard, which has frequently seen major fish kills as a result of spills and other accidents in the urbanized area.|$|R
40|$|In this work, multivariate and numeric {{methods were}} used to {{integrate}} the chemical and ecotoxicological data obtained for the sediments from the Santos Estuarine System, and for {{the vicinity of the}} discharges of the Submarine <b>Sewage</b> <b>Outfall</b> of Santos, in order to establish more accurately the environmental risks, identify the priority areas and thus provide guidance to control the programs and public policies. For both the datasets, the concentrations which exceeded numeric sediment guidelines tended to be associated to toxicity. For the estuary, this trend was corroborated by the correlations between the toxicity and Cu and PAHs levels, whereas for the <b>sewage</b> <b>outfall</b> region, this was observed through the correlation between the toxicity and Hg contents. Ratio-to-mean values were calculated for each sample, in order to rank them according to the toxicity and contamination. Cluster analyses confirmed the ranking results. For the estuary, three categories of sediments were established: stations SSV- 2, SSV- 3 and SSV- 4 were under major risks, followed by SSV- 6. Stations SSV- 1 and SSV- 5 were not altered.

40|$|Evidence is {{presented}} for the age-related distribution of Bar-tailed Godwits in Moreton Bay, Queensland, during the northward migration in 1989.

A ‘natural experiment’ at a <b>sewage</b> <b>outfall</b> is described to help explain the age-related distribution.

40|$|Due {{to their}} {{particular}} biological characteristics meiobenthic assemblages are often considered {{a valuable tool}} in pollution effects studies. Meiofaunal assemblages’ characterization on the locations affected by sewage discharge (the municipal <b>sewage</b> <b>outfall</b> of Rovinj) is {{necessary in order to}} detect the effectiveness of wastewater management. Samples were collected along 4 profiles, starting from the discharge point in the directions SE, SW, NE, NW from November to December 2009. At each profile sampling (for the caracterisation of sediments and meiofaunal analysis) was performed at distances of 50, 100 and 150 m from <b>sewage</b> <b>outfall.</b> Low number of meiofaunal taxa was detected with a predominance of nematodes with a high abundance (max. 5213 ind/ 10 cm², min. 1956 ind/ 10 cm²). The Nematodes- Copepodes ratios is extremly high (values up to 500). Is visible also an enrichment of sediments with organic matter provenient from the outfall. Only mechanically treated wastewater has a great impact on the researched area, this is visible in the deterioration of the quality of sediments and the state of the meiofaunal assemblages. An adequate secondary biological treatment is necessary for limiting ecological (environmental) damage caused by the organic enrichment (pollution) of sediments.

40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the distribution of}} sewage pollution markers (faecal coliforms, Clostridium perfringens and faecal sterols) in seawater and marine sediments around Rothera Research Station, Antarctic Peninsula. Untreated sewage waste has been released from this site since 1975, creating the potential for long-term contamination of the benthic environment. Faecal coliform concentrations in seawater reached background levels within 300 m of the outfall. In sediment cores, both C. perfringens and faecal coliform concentrations declined with distance from the outfall, though C. perfringens persisted at greater depths in the sediment. High concentrations of 5 beta(H) -cholestan- 3 beta-of (coprostanol) relative to the corresponding 5 alpha-epimer (cholestanol), indicative of sewage pollution, were only found in sediments within 200 m of the <b>sewage</b> <b>outfall.</b> This study has shown that sewage contamination {{is limited to the}} immediate vicinity of the <b>sewage</b> <b>outfall.</b> Nevertheless, a <b>sewage</b> treatment plant was installed in February 2003 to reduce this contamination further...|$|R
40|$|Shell {{morphology}} and sculpture, {{population size}} structure, sediment grain size preference, and the reproductive cycle, are described {{for the common}} estuarine mud flat gastropod, Amphibola crenata (Martyn 1784). Snails which occurred near to <b>sewage</b> <b>outfalls</b> in the Avon-Heathcote Estuary, are compared with those which occurred In an area with similar salinity and exposure conditions but isolated from possible effects of sewage. Sediment silt and organic carbon content were higher near to the outfalls. Shell morphology, described by shell dimensions, geometrical parameters of coiling, linear weight relationships and shell deposition patterns, showed {{no significant difference between}} the two areas. A predominantly juvenile population which occurred near to the <b>sewage</b> <b>outfalls</b> was the result of an annual cycle of settlement and sub-sequent population loss. A predominantly adult population occurred in the area unaffected by the outfalls. In laboratory experiments, animals from each area preferred sediment from their own particular area. Size frequency and sculpture distribution showed no regular zonation patterns for other areas of the estuary. Seasonal changes in the ovotestis were not significantly different between animals collected from the two areas. Tissue levels of heavy metals in A. crenata collected from near to the <b>sewage</b> <b>outfalls</b> were lower per unit tissue dry weight but higher in total metal per individual than in those from the other area. Tissue and sediment levels of metals were relatively low in both areas compared with levels reported in studies of polluted conditions. Isolated areas of elevated metal levels occurred in the Avon River. Exceptionally long survival times for A. crenata exposed to copper(ii) ion concentrations in the laboratory, are attributed to pulmonary respiration, the operculum, and high mucous production. Salinities below 8 % seawater and increase in temperature affected the toxicity of copper to adults. Veliger larvae were sensitive to much lower concentrations of ionic copper(ii) (0. 5 ppm) than those which affected egg development (5 ppm) or survival of adults (2. 5 ppm). The size distribution of A. crenata near to the <b>sewage</b> <b>outfalls</b> does not seem to be a result of the presence of toxic materials in the sewage...|$|R
