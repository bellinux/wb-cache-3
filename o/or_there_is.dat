5|$|The {{debate among}} monks unfolds in the {{presence}} of their teachers, with a very well set rules of procedure for the defender and the questioners. The tradition of such debates is traced to the ancient ‘Hindu Orthodoxy’ in India and this practice permeated into Buddhist orthodoxy in Tibet in the eighth century. Such debates usually take place within the monastery’s precincts. The defender has the onus to prove his point of view on the subject proposed for debate. The debate opens with an invocation to Manjushri recited in a loud and high pitched tone. The roles of the debater and the questioner are well defined; the questioner has to succinctly present his case (all on Buddhism related topics) and the defender has to answer within a fixed time frame. The finality of the debate is with specific answers like: “I accept (do), the reason is not established (ta madrup) <b>or</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no pervasion (Kyappa majung)”. Many a time, the questions mooted are meant to mislead the defender. If the defender does not reply within a time frame, an expression of derision is witnessed. In the Tibetan debating sessions, there is no role for a witness and there is normally no adjudicator. This leads to “conflicting opinions of participants and listeners.” When there is direct contradiction on the defenders part, the outcome is, however, formally decided.|$|E

Similarly if the VUR is severe (Grade IV & V), there are pyelonephritic changes or congenital abnormalities. Other reasons necessitating surgical intervention are failure of renal growth, formation of new scars, renal deterioration and VUR in girls approaching puberty.|$|E

25|$|The {{issue price}} at which investors buy the bonds {{when they are}} first issued will {{typically}} be approximately equal to the nominal amount. The net proceeds that the issuer receives are thus the issue price, less issuance fees. The market price of the bond will vary over its life: it may trade at a premium (above par, usually because market interest rates have fallen since issue), or at a discount (price below par, if market rates have risen <b>or</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a high probability of default on the bond).|$|E
25|$|Dairy farming {{has been}} part of {{agriculture}} for thousands of years. Historically it has been one part of small, diverse farms. In the last century or so larger farms doing only dairy production have emerged. Large scale dairy farming is only viable where either a large amount of milk is required for production of more durable dairy products such as cheese, butter, etc. <b>or</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a substantial market of people with cash to buy milk, but no cows of their own. Dairy farms were the best way to meet demand.|$|E
25|$|In {{the last}} century or so larger farms specialising in dairy alone have emerged. Large scale dairy farming is only viable where either {{a large amount of}} milk is {{required}} for production of more durable dairy products such as cheese, butter, etc. <b>or</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a substantial market of people with cash to buy milk, but no cows of their own. In the 1800's von Thünen argued that there was about a 100 mile radius surrounding a city where such fresh milk supply was economically viable.|$|E

25|$|Acetic acid ear drops {{may be used}} as a {{preventative}} measure. Treatment {{of acute}} cases is typically with antibiotic drops, such as ofloxacin or acetic acid. Steroid drops may be used in addition to antibiotics. Pain medications such as ibuprofen may be used for the pain. Antibiotics by mouth are not recommended unless the person has poor immune function <b>or</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> infection of the skin around the ear. Typically, improvement occurs within a day of the start of treatment. Treatment of chronic cases depends on the cause.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to a pecuniary interest, other forms of personal interest that an adjudicator has in a decision may {{give the impression that}} he or she is biased. As the High Court stated in Re Singh Kalpanath (1992), a likelihood of bias may arise because an adjudicator (1) has already indicated partisanship by expressing opinions antagonistic or favourable to the parties before him; (2) has made known his views about the merits of the very issue or issues of a similar nature in such a way as to suggest prejudgment; or (3) has a personal relationship with the party <b>or</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> close kinship between the adjudicator and a party.|$|E
25|$|In {{the common}} law of England and Wales there is no {{criminal}} liability for failing {{to act in the}} event of another person being in danger; however, there are exceptions to this rule. In instances where there has been an assumption of responsibility by the bystander, a dangerous situation was created by them, <b>or</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a contractual or statutory duty to act, criminal liability would be imposed on the bystander for their failure to take action. The courts are reluctant to penalize people attempting rescue and English law makes provision for the actions of 'good Samaritans,' unless their actions were grossly negligent or made a situation worse.|$|E

25|$|A Howler is a blood-red {{letter sent}} to signify extreme anger or {{to convey a}} message very loudly and publicly. When it is opened, the sender's voice, which has been magically {{magnified}} to a deafening volume, bellows a message at the recipient and then self-destructs. If it is not opened <b>or</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a delay in opening it, the letter smolders, explodes violently, and shouts the message out even louder than normal. In the film version, the Howler folds itself into an origami-style set of lips and eyes, and shouts the message out and then shreds itself into scraps of paper before it burns itself.|$|E
25|$|This game {{requires}} two players, {{a referee}} and three playing sets. Each player sees only his own board, while the referee {{can see them}} both and also has his own set. Players place stones on their boards, with no knowledge of what other players are doing. A referee keeps track of the game on the central board. If any player makes an illegal move, the referee informs him about it (some play that the referee says only that the move is illegal, while some, that the player is told whether the intersection is occupied <b>or</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> illegal ko capture). The player is allowed to make another move.|$|E
25|$|If no {{fluorescence}} is detected, {{an interaction}} may still {{exist between the}} proteins of interest, as {{the creation of the}} fusion protein may alter the structure or interaction face of the target protein or the fluorescence fragments may be physically unable to associate. To ensure that this result is not a false negative, that there is no interaction, the protein interaction must be tested in a situation where fluorescence complementation and activation requires an external signal. In this case, if the external signal fails to cause fluorescence fragment association, {{it is likely that the}} proteins do not interact <b>or</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a physical impediment to fluorescence complementation.|$|E

25|$|The 'origin of the soul' has {{provided}} a vexing question in Christianity. The major theories put forward include soul creationism, traducianism, and pre-existence. According to creationism, each individual soul is created directly by God, either {{at the moment of}} conception or some later time. According to traducianism, the soul comes from the parents by natural generation. According to the preexistence theory, the soul exists before the moment of conception. There have been differing thoughts regarding whether human embryos have souls from conception, <b>or</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a point between conception and birth where the fetus acquires a soul, consciousness, and/or personhood. Stances in this question might more or less influence judgements on the morality of abortion.|$|E
25|$|When the bandlimit is {{too high}} (<b>or</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no bandlimit), the {{reconstruction}} exhibits imperfections known as aliasing. Modern statements of the theorem are sometimes careful to explicitly state that x(t) must contain no sinusoidal component at exactly frequency B, or that B must be strictly less than ½ the sample rate. The two thresholds, 2B and fs/2 are respectively called the Nyquist rate and Nyquist frequency. And respectively, they are attributes of x(t) and of the sampling equipment. The condition described by these inequalities is called the Nyquist criterion, or sometimes the Raabe condition. The theorem is also applicable to functions of other domains, such as space, {{in the case of}} a digitized image. The only change, in the case of other domains, is the units of measure applied to t, fs, and B.|$|E
25|$|A common {{practice}} of M. flavitarsis is nest usurpation, {{in which the}} queen is displaced by a subordinate daughter or foreign wasp, which will then become {{the queen of the}} colony. The replacement queen is defined as whoever becomes the primary egg-layer in the nest. Typically, nest usurpation takes place during the pre-emergence phase or early emergence phase because there are fewer adult wasps to deter the usurper. Attempts occur because the queen is away from the nest and disappears, <b>or</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> only one foundress to overthrow. When a usurper attacks, the two wasps fight by biting, using antennation, and grappling each other attempting to sting each other. If the queen is usurped, then sometimes the older daughters will follow the queen when she flees to start a new nest. Daughters that hatch following usurpation will work for the usurper-queen.|$|E
