The proposed Laguerre based controller {{is a kind of}} IIR structure which has the benefits of both FIR and IIR structures and can solve their limitations in stability and compelexity. The controller can control the velocity of EHSS appropriately and consumes small computational load for this goal. The Feedback Error Learning (FEL) algorithm is used to control the velocity. In FEL method the computing of system jacobian is not necessary and it makes this algorithm suitable for practical implementations. The experiments and simulations carried out in this study show that the proposed controller can control the velocity of EHSS in 1. 7 s by using the control signal with 4. 5 v amplitude. With comparing this results with <b>other</b> <b>intelligent</b> <b>controllers</b> it will be showed that the Laguerre based conroller has significantly better performance in settling time and amplitude of control signal than <b>other</b> <b>intelligent</b> <b>controllers.</b> Key words...|$|E
