These provided the main source for the compilations by the Tuskegee Institute to document lynchings, a practice it continued until 1968.|$|E

The tsar wanted to avoid trouble in the new territory and also used former Swedish upper class to further modernisation in Russia; Finnish was not an option at that time as official language, as the administration did not know Finnish well enough and the language was undeveloped regarding such use.|$|E

25|$|Both the {{ascending}} Russian Empire and pre-revolutionary France {{aspired to}} have Sweden {{as a client}} state. Parliamentarians and others with influence were susceptible to taking bribes which they {{did their best to}} increase. The integrity and the credibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>system</b> waned, and in 1771 the young and charismatic king Gustav III staged a coup d'état, abolished parliamentarism and reinstated royal power in Sweden—more or less {{with the support of the}} parliament. In 1788, he started a new war against Russia. Despite a couple of victorious battles, the war was fruitless, managing only to bring disturbance to the economic life of Finland. The popularity of King Gustav III waned considerably. During the war, a group of officers made the famous Anjala declaration demanding peace negotiations and calling of Riksdag (Parliament). An interesting sideline to this process was the conspiracy of some Finnish officers, who attempted to create an independent Finnish state with Russian support. After an initial shock, Gustav III crushed this opposition. In 1789, the new constitution of Sweden strengthened the royal power further, as well as improving the status of the peasantry. However, the continuing war had to be finished without conquests—and many Swedes now considered the king as a tyrant.|$|E
25|$|The Small Landholders (Scotland) Act 1911 had {{empowered}} the Scottish Secretary, {{on behalf}} of the Government, to acquire certain farms in the Highlands and Islands by compulsory purchase and to have them divided up to provide more crofts. In 1913, four farms on Lewis had been scheduled for take-over, but the action had been opposed by the Proprietor at that time, and when the war with Germany broke out it was left in abeyance. Towards the end of the war, in the summer of 1918, the Scottish Office first proposed to Leverhulme that under the Small Landholders Act, the Board of Agriculture should take possession of certain of his farms and create something fewer than a hundred and fifty crofts. He was against this, even though some local politicians believed that Leverhulme's project and the provision of more crofts were not mutually exclusive. But Leverhulme firmly believed that he could greatly improved living standards to an extent that crofting would become a forgotten way of life. He was also impatient with politicians’ machinations and the laborious indolence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>system</b> that persisted with the ‘futile land reform’ instead of adopting what he considered the most sensible course of action; to forget about new crofts and allow him, in the interests of expediency, to behave like the monarch of the Western Isles.|$|E

500|$|The liberum veto (Latin for [...] "free veto") was a {{parliamentary}} device in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

The rule was in place from the mid-17th century to the late 18th century in the Sejm's parliamentary deliberations.

500|$|Citing the {{importance}} of preventing President Johnson's nomination, and {{the continuation of the}} war in Vietnam, McCarthy entered his name into four Democratic presidential primaries on November 30, 1967.

A few days later, the Johnson administration made an announcement on the war in Vietnam that, according to McCarthy, was akin to an escalation. He believed that such an announcement would only strengthen his own campaign. The following week, rumors spread among the president's staff that the McCarthy campaign was a ploy to weaken Johnson and make it easier for Senator Robert F. Kennedy to defeat him. Kennedy had announced that he would not challenge Johnson for the nomination, but a presidential candidacy was not ruled out.|$|E
