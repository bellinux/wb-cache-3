5000|$|Beta {{decay of}} an even-even nucleus {{produces}} an <b>odd-odd</b> <b>nucleus,</b> and vice versa. An even number of protons or of neutrons are more stable (higher binding energy) because of pairing effects, so even-even nuclei {{are much more}} stable than odd-odd. One effect {{is that there are}} few stable odd-odd nuclides, but another effect is to prevent beta decay of many even-even nuclei into another even-even nucleus of the same mass number but lower energy, because decay proceeding {{one step at a time}} would have to pass through an <b>odd-odd</b> <b>nucleus</b> of higher energy. Double beta decay directly from even-even to even-even skipping over an odd-odd nuclide is only occasionally possible, and even then with a half-life greater than a billion times the age of the universe. For example, the double beta emitter [...] has a half-life of [...] years. This makes for a larger number of stable even-even nuclides, up to three for some mass numbers, and up to seven for some atomic (proton) numbers.|$|E

The {{dynamical}} symmetry group Sp(12, R) of the Interacting Vector Boson Model (IVBM) {{is extended}} to the orthosymplectic group OSp(2 Ω/ 12, R) in order to incorporate fermion degrees of freedom.
