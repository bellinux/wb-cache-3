The aim of this questionnaire survey was to obtain information on the provision <b>of</b> training in <b>human</b> <b>sexuality</b> in schools <b>of</b> nursing in the UK. The 20 -item mixed qualitative and quantitative questionnaire was designed to elicit maximum information about research questions, it was independently validated after focus group discussion. The results drawn from this study will be primarily presented as observations, rather than statistically tested statements. The provision <b>of</b> training in <b>human</b> <b>sexuality</b> in the pre-registration nursing curricula in the UK is inadequate to meet the current varied needs of patients. On average, a mere 6. 8 hours out of a potential 2300 hours of theoretical learning is dedicated to teaching <b>human</b> <b>sexuality</b> in schools <b>of</b> health in the UK.

25|$|Reform Judaism and Reconstructionist Judaism in North America and Liberal Judaism in the United Kingdom view {{homosexuality}} to {{be acceptable}} on the same basis as heterosexuality.

25|$|In {{his third}} book, Why is Sex Fun?, also {{published}} in 1997, Diamond discusses evolutionary factors underlying features <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>sexuality</b> that are generally {{taken for granted}} but that are highly unusual among our animal relatives.

25|$|Efforts {{to change}} sexual {{orientation}} {{are unlikely to}} be successful and involve some risk of harm, contrary to the claims of SOCE practitioners and advocates. Even though the research and clinical literature demonstrate that same-sex sexual and romantic attractions, feelings, and behaviors are normal and positive variations <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>sexuality,</b> regardless of sexual orientation identity, the task force concluded that the population that undergoes SOCE tends to have strongly conservative religious views that lead them to seek to change their sexual orientation. Thus, the appropriate application of affirmative therapeutic interventions for those who seek SOCE involves therapist acceptance, support, and understanding of clients and the facilitation of clients' active coping, social support, and identity exploration and development, without imposing a specific sexual orientation identity outcome.|$|E

25|$|In 2005 Wilton became Professor <b>of</b> <b>Human</b> <b>Sexuality</b> at the Sociology School at UWE in {{recognition}} of her achievements, which itself was remarkable given she had only begun to embark on an academic career fifteen years earlier. She was a valued 'special' member of the Gay and Lesbian Association of Doctors and Dentists (GLADD), and was instrumental in establishing the first National LGBT Health Summit at Cardiff in 2006. In 2007 the LGBT Health Summit established an LGBT Health Community Award in her name; there was some objection to this from within the transgender community, as she had twice written material which appeared to cast transsexuals in a bad light. The objections were noted and discussed, and the award continued to be established in her name.|$|E
25|$|From feminists' perspectives, sexology, {{which is}} the study <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>sexuality</b> and sexual relationship, relates to the {{intersectionality}} of gender, race and sexuality. Men have dominant power and control over women in the relationship, and women are expected to hide their true feeling about sexual behaviors. Women of color face even more sexual violence in the society. Some countries in Africa and Asia even practice female genital cutting, controlling women's sexual desire and limiting their sexual behavior. Moreover, Bunch, the women's and human rights activist, states that the society used to see lesbianism {{as a threat to}} male supremacy and to the political relationships between men and women. Therefore, in the past, people viewed being a lesbian as a sin and made it death penalty. Even today, many people still discriminate homosexuals. Many lesbians hide their sexuality and face even more sexual oppression.|$|E
500|$|The {{anthropologist}} Donald Symons, {{writing in}} The Evolution <b>of</b> <b>Human</b> <b>Sexuality</b> (1979), described Tripp's hypothesis that erotic feeling depends on resistance as plausible, arguing that females {{may have been}} a scarce sexual resource in natural human habitats and that selection favors the experience of pleasure not only in consummation but in the effort to consummate. Symons endorsed Tripp's view that sexual encounters between men often involve intense levels of eroticism seldom reached elsewhere. The psychologist Alan P. Bell and the sociologists Martin S. Weinberg and Sue Kiefer Hammersmith, writing in Sexual Preference (1981), observed that Tripp ridiculed the way in which theorists have attributed the development of male homosexuality to [...] "almost any kind of maternal relationship". They considered Tripp correct to caution against adding further [...] "post hoc" [...] explanations of male homosexuality, but noted that some studies suggest that [...] "prehomosexual" [...] boys have atypical relationships with their mothers.|$|E

50|$|The idea {{of sexual}} script brings a new metaphor and imagery for {{understanding}} human sexual activity as social and learned interactions.

The theory of sexual scripting brings sociological, cultural, anthropological, historical and social psychological tools to the study <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>sexualities.</b> Whereas <b>human</b> <b>sexuality</b> is usually seen as the province of the biologist and the clinician, scripting helps research and analysis to understand sexualities as less biological and more cultural, historical and social.|$|R
