5|$|Five of the state's {{counties}} are wholly {{within the boundaries}} of sovereign Indian reservations. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> climate and land, and isolation from urban areas with more employment opportunities, living standards on many South Dakota reservations are often far below the national average; Ziebach County ranked as the poorest county in the nation in 2009. The unemployment rate in Fort Thompson, on the Crow Creek Reservation, is 70%, and 21% of households lack plumbing or basic kitchen appliances. A 1995 study by the U.S. Census Bureau found 58% of homes on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation did not have a telephone. The reservations' isolation also inhibits their ability to generate revenue from gaming casinos, an avenue that has proved profitable for many tribes closer to urban centers.|$|E
5|$|In November 2006, Keyes criticized Massachusetts {{governor}} Mitt Romney for instituting {{gay marriage}} entirely on his own—according to Keyes—with no requirement or {{authority to do}} so under Massachusetts law. Keyes said Romney's actions, which he suggested were due to a complete misunderstanding of his role as governor and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> the judicial branch of government, were not necessitated by a ruling of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court in November 2003 that directed the state legislature to institute same-sex marriage. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial court had ruled that the state law banning same-sex marriage was not constitutional. The court gave the Massachusetts Legislature 180 days to modify the law; after it failed to do so, Gov. Mitt Romney ordered town clerks to begin issuing marriage licenses on May 17, 2004, {{in compliance with the}} court ruling.|$|E
