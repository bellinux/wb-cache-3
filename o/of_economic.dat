5|$|Critics of {{the policy}} <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> {{liberalization}} pursued during the Menem Presidency argued that Argentina's economic woes were caused by neoliberalism, which had been actively promoted by the U.S. government and the IMF under the Washington Consensus.

A 2004 report by the IMF's Independent Evaluation Office criticised the IMF's conduct prior to Argentina's economic collapse of 2001, saying the IMF had supported the country's fixed exchange rate for too long, and was too lenient towards fiscal deficits.|$|E

A basic framework has been developed and a cluster model for management <b>of</b> foreign <b>economic</b> activity <b>of</b> enterprises providing a description of such management as a complex mechanism with the specified parameters has been created. The basic elements of the cluster model of management <b>of</b> foreign <b>economic</b> activity <b>of</b> enterprise have been allocated.
