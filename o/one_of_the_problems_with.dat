5|$|Describing {{the system}} in November 1988, Cray stated that the 12 times {{performance}} increase would {{be made up of}} a three times increase due to GaAs circuits, and four times due to the use of more processors. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> the Cray-2 had been poor multiprocessing performance due to limited bandwidth between the processors, and to address this the Cray-3 would adopt the much faster architecture used in the Cray Y-MP. This would provide a design performance of 8000 MIPS, or 16 GFLOPS.|$|E

In early 1973, Maben was fly fishing with Waters, and suggested the possibility of improving the film by watching them at work in a recording studio. Subsequently, Maben was invited with a small crew using a single 35mm camera to Abbey Road Studios to film supposed recording sessions of The Dark Side of the Moon, as well as interviews conducted off-camera by Maben, and footage of the band eating and talking at the studio cafeteria. Maben was particularly happy about this footage, feeling it captured the spontaneous humour of the band. This version premiered on 21 August 1974, and ran for 80 minutes.|$|E

25|$|Additionally, {{during this}} period the {{magnetron}} team at Birmingham had made a breakthrough. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> the magnetron was that every pulse caused slightly different oscillations within each cavity, sometimes interfering with each other. With some patterns, particularly the pi mode, the signals added up and the tube was much more efficient. James Sayers had discovered that if a strap of metal was run between alternating lobes of the magnetron's cavities, the pi mode was strongly favoured. This allowed power levels to be greatly increased, and GEC began producing the new CV64, designed to operate at as much as 50kW. These were known as strapped magnetrons.|$|E
25|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> the {{original}} {{formulation of the}} razor is that it only applies to models with the same explanatory power (i.e., it only tells us to prefer the simplest of equally good models). A more general form of the razor {{can be derived from}} Bayesian model comparison, which is based on Bayes factors and can be used to compare models that don't fit the observations equally well. These methods can sometimes optimally balance the complexity and power of a model. Generally, the exact Occam factor is intractable, but approximations such as Akaike information criterion, Bayesian information criterion, Variational Bayesian methods, false discovery rate, and Laplace's method are used. Many artificial intelligence researchers are now employing such techniques, for instance through work on Occam Learning or more generally on the Free energy principle.|$|E

500|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> {{defining}} this extended {{category is}} that weak resonances may exist {{and would be}} difficult to prove due to chaotic planetary perturbations and the current lack of knowledge of the orbits of these distant objects. They have orbital periods of more than 300 years and most have only been observed over a short observation arc of a couple years. Due to their great distance and slow movement against background stars, it may be decades before most of these distant orbits are determined well enough to confidently confirm or rule out a resonance. Further improvement in the orbit and potential resonance of these objects will help to understand the migration of the giant planets and the formation of the Solar System. For example, simulations by Emel’yanenko and Kiseleva in 2007 show that many distant objects could be in resonance with Neptune. They show a 10% likelihood that 2000 CR105 is in a 20:1 resonance, a 38% likelihood that 2003 QK91 is in a 10:3 resonance, and an 84% likelihood that [...] is in an 8:3 resonance. The likely dwarf planet [...] appears to have less than a 1% likelihood of being in a 4:1 resonance.|$|E

2500|$|A {{classic example}} of a single-blind test is the Pepsi Challenge. A tester, often a {{marketing}} person, prepares two sets of cups of cola labeled [...] "A" [...] and [...] "B".

Volunteer subjects are encouraged to try the two cups of soda and polled for which ones they prefer. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> a single-blind test like this is that the tester can unintentionally give subconscious cues which influence the subjects. In addition, it is possible the tester could intentionally introduce bias by preparing the separate sodas differently (e.g., by putting more ice in one cup or by pushing one cup closer to the subject).
