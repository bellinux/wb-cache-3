5|$|Ahimsa (Non-violence or Non-injury). Mahavira {{taught that}} every living being has {{sanctity}} and dignity {{of its own}} {{and it should be}} respected just as <b>one</b> <b>expects</b> one's own sanctity and dignity to be respected. Ahimsa is formalised into Jain doctrine as the first and foremost vow. The concept applies to action, speech, and thought.|$|E
5|$|In {{the modern}} world, dance {{has come to}} be {{regarded}} as something one does for recreation, thus distancing dance from the important place it has held in many human cultures throughout history—that is, a method of expression, preservation and transmission of the culture and history of a people. Many of the activities that humans have engaged in for millennia (religion and courtship, for example) have traditionally found expression in various kinds of dance. Another activity—combat—has obviously been central to the life of most human cultures; thus, <b>one</b> <b>expects</b> to find dances that celebrate skill in the use of weapons. Indeed, there is a wide range of such weapon dances in the world; they vary from general displays of prowess in the use of weapons to reenactments of real episodes of combat specific to a given culture.|$|E

25|$|A {{closely related}} concept is the E-value, {{which is the}} {{expected}} number of times in multiple testing that <b>one</b> <b>expects</b> to obtain a test statistic at least as extreme {{as the one that}} was actually observed if one assumes that the null hypothesis is true. The E-value is the product of the number of tests and the p-value.|$|E
25|$|Fairly {{straightforward}} statistics provide {{estimates of}} whether associations between genes on lists {{are greater than}} what one would expect by chance. These statistics are interesting, even if they represent a substantial oversimplification of {{what is really going}} on. Here is an example. Suppose there are 10,000 genes in an experiment, only 50 (0.5%) of which play a known role in making cholesterol. The experiment identifies 200 regulated genes. Of those, 40 (20%) turn out to be on a list of cholesterol genes as well. Based on the overall prevalence of the cholesterol genes (0.5%) <b>one</b> <b>expects</b> an average of 1 cholesterol gene for every 200 regulated genes, that is, 0.005 times 200. This expectation is an average, so <b>one</b> <b>expects</b> to see more than one some of the time. The question becomes how often we would see 40 instead of 1 due to pure chance.|$|E

25|$|The Riemann {{hypothesis}} can {{be generalized}} by replacing the Riemann zeta function by the formally similar, {{but much more}} general, global L-functions. In this broader setting, <b>one</b> <b>expects</b> the non-trivial zeros of the global L-functions to have real part 1/2. It is these conjectures, rather than the classical Riemann hypothesis only for the single Riemann zeta function, which account for the true importance of the Riemann hypothesis in mathematics.|$|E
25|$|As <b>one</b> <b>expects</b> of {{a capital}} city, Brussels is {{the hub of}} a range of old {{national}} roads, the main ones being clockwise: the N1 (N to Breda), N2 (E to Maastricht), N3 (E to Aachen), N4 (SE to Luxembourg) N5 (S to Rheims), N6 (S to Maubeuge), N7 (SW to Lille), N8 (W to Koksijde) and N9 (NW to Ostend). Usually named chaussées/steenwegen, these highways normally run in a straight line, but sometimes lose themselves in a maze of narrow shopping streets.|$|E
25|$|For abelian {{varieties}} and curves {{there is an}} elementary description of ℓ-adic cohomology. For abelian varieties the first ℓ-adic cohomology group is the dual of the Tate module, and the higher cohomology groups are given by its exterior powers. For curves the first cohomology group is the first cohomology group of its Jacobian. This explains why Weil {{was able to give}} a more elementary proof of the Weil conjectures in these two cases: in general <b>one</b> <b>expects</b> to find an elementary proof whenever there is an elementary description of the ℓ-adic cohomology.|$|E

He did not lack courage, however, for he boldly faced the angry ruler and defied him. Every <b>one</b> <b>expected</b> to see Spitfire follow Dick Swan, and in similar fashion, but they were mistaken. They did not yet understand Grummidge.|$|R
25|$|The {{graticule}} is {{a grid of}} squares {{that serve}} as reference marks for measuring the displayed trace. These markings, whether located directly on the screen or on a removable plastic filter, usually consist of a 1cm grid with closer tick marks (often at 2mm) on the centre vertical and horizontal axis. <b>One</b> <b>expects</b> to see ten major divisions across the screen; the number of vertical major divisions varies. Comparing the grid markings with the waveform permits one to measure both voltage (vertical axis) and time (horizontal axis). Frequency can also be determined by measuring the waveform period and calculating its reciprocal.|$|E
25|$|Young's modulus {{represents}} the factor of proportionality in Hooke's law, which relates {{the stress and}} the strain. However, Hooke's law is only valid under the assumption of an elastic and linear response. Any real material will eventually fail and break when stretched over a very large distance or with a very large force; however all solid materials exhibit nearly Hookean behavior for small enough strains or stresses. If the range over which Hooke's law is valid is large enough compared to the typical stress that <b>one</b> <b>expects</b> {{to apply to the}} material, the material is said to be linear. Otherwise (if the typical stress one would apply is outside the linear range) the material is said to be non-linear.|$|E
25|$|In practice, {{the theory}} of the actual Fowler-Nordheim {{tunneling}} process is much the same for all materials (though details of barrier shape may vary, and modified theory has to be developed for initial states that are localized rather than are travelling-wave-like). However, notwithstanding such differences, <b>one</b> <b>expects</b> (for thermodynamic equilibrium situations) that all CFE equations will have exponents that behave in a generally similar manner. This is why applying Fowler-Nordheim-type equations to materials outside the scope of the derivations given here often works. If interest is only in parameters (such as field enhancement factor) that relate to the slope of Fowler-Nordheim or Millikan-Lauritsen plots and to the exponent of the CFE equation, then Fowler-Nordheim-type theory will often give sensible estimates. However, attempts to derive meaningful current density values will usually or always fail.|$|E

30|$|Once test {{input data}} is obtained, the {{original}} model is animated using these inputs to generate oracle data (expected test case results). The approach currently supports four strategies for oracle verifications: exception checking (executes {{the test and}} verifies if any exception is raised), invariant checking (verifies if the invariant is preserved), state variables checking (verifies if the values for the state variables are the <b>ones</b> <b>expected),</b> and return variables checking (verifies if the values returned by the operation are the <b>ones</b> <b>expected).</b> These strategies can be combined to make weaker or stronger verifications.|$|R
25|$|Non-linear {{differential}} equations are {{formed by the}} products of the unknown function and its derivatives are allowed and its degree is > 1.There are very few methods of solving nonlinear {{differential equations}} exactly; those that are known typically depend on the equation having particular symmetries. Nonlinear differential equations can exhibit very complicated behavior over extended time intervals, characteristic of chaos. Even the fundamental questions of existence, uniqueness, and extendability of solutions for nonlinear differential equations, and well-posedness of initial and boundary value problems for nonlinear PDEs are hard problems and their resolution in special cases {{is considered to be a}} significant advance in the mathematical theory (cf. Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness). However, if the differential equation is a correctly formulated representation of a meaningful physical process, then <b>one</b> <b>expects</b> it to have a solution.|$|E

500|$|Friedrich said, [...] "The artist should paint {{not only}} what he sees before him, but also what he sees within him. If, however, he sees nothing within him, then he should also refrain from {{painting}} that which he sees before him. Otherwise, his pictures will be like those folding screens behind which <b>one</b> <b>expects</b> to find only the sick or the dead." [...] Expansive skies, storms, mist, forests, ruins and crosses bearing witness {{to the presence of}} God are frequent elements in Friedrich's landscapes. Though death finds symbolic expression in boats that move away from shore—a Charon-like motif—and in the poplar tree, it is referenced more directly in paintings like The Abbey in the Oakwood (1808–10), in which monks carry a coffin past an open grave, toward a cross, and through the portal of a church in ruins.|$|E

Honor Tracy, providing the critique for The Guardian thought Fleming praiseworthy, as he [...] "writes without any pretension at all", while also managing to be [...] "invariably entertaining and often funny". Overall Tracy considered that Thrilling Cities was [...] "a lively, enjoyable book, written from an unusual {{point of view and}} well illustrated." [...] Writing for The Observer, Francis Hope was surprised by Fleming's written style, which he found to be [...] "more flabby verbose than <b>one</b> <b>expects</b> of a thriller writer", although this was redeemed by Fleming having [...] "some interesting conversations with local experts on crime".|$|E
500|$|Some {{prominent}} critics wrote negative reviews. In his 1941 {{review for}} Sur, Jorge Luis Borges famously called the film [...] "a labyrinth with no center" [...] and predicted that its legacy {{would be a}} film [...] "whose historical value is undeniable but which no one cares to see again." [...] The Argus Weekend Magazine critic Erle Cox called the film [...] "amazing" [...] but thought that Welles's break with Hollywood traditions was [...] "overdone." [...] Tatlers James Agate called it [...] "the well-intentioned, muddled, amateurish thing <b>one</b> <b>expects</b> from high-brows" [...] and [...] "a quite good film which tries to run the psychological essay in harness with your detective thriller, and doesn't quite succeed." [...] Eileen Creelman of The New York Sun called it [...] "a cold picture, unemotional, a puzzle rather than a drama". Other people who disliked the film were W. H. Auden and James Agee.|$|E
