5|$|All known planets transit the star; {{this means}} that all six planets' orbits appear to cross {{in front of their}} star as viewed from the Earth's perspective. Their inclinations {{relative}} to Earth's line <b>of</b> <b>sight,</b> or how far above or below the plane <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> they are, vary by {{a little more than a}} degree. This allows direct measurements of the planets' periods and relative diameters (compared to the host star) by monitoring each planet's transit of the star. Simulations suggest that the mean mutual inclinations of the planetary orbits are about 1°, meaning the system is probably more coplanar (flatter) than the Solar System, where the corresponding figure is 2.3°.|$|E
5|$|Epsilon Eridani is {{classified}} as a BY Draconis variable because it has regions of higher magnetic activity that move {{into and out of}} the line <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> as it rotates. Measurement of this rotational modulation suggests that its equatorial region rotates with an average period of 11.2days, which is less than half of the rotation period of the Sun. Observations have shown that Epsilon Eridani varies as much as 0.050 in V magnitude due to starspots and other short-term magnetic activity. Photometry has also shown that the surface of Epsilon Eridani, like the Sun, is undergoing differential rotation i.e. the rotation period at equator differs from that at high latitude. The measured periods range from 10.8 to 12.3 days. The axial tilt of Epsilon Eridani toward the line <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> from Earth is highly uncertain: estimates range from 24° to 72°.|$|E

5|$|The turn-based ground combat uses a {{top-down}} 3D perspective. The player controls a {{squad of}} between one and six human soldiers or robotic units as they hunt the aliens on the map and attempt to complete other objectives dependent on the mission. Map layouts are not randomly generated, but enemy placement is. Fog of war hides the aliens and their actions from view until the player's soldiers are in range and have line <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> on them, and enemies normally do not act at all until the squad initially comes within line <b>of</b> <b>sight.</b> Soldiers can carry items and perform special abilities; use of these items and abilities is controlled through a toolbar on the head-up display (HUD). A few examples of abilities include firing on enemies automatically after they emerge, launching explosives, and healing allies.|$|E

5|$|William Herschel was {{the first}} {{astronomer}} to attempt to determine the distribution of stars in the sky. During the 1780s he established a series of gauges in 600 directions and counted the stars observed along each line <b>of</b> <b>sight.</b> From this he deduced {{that the number of}} stars steadily increased toward one side of the sky, {{in the direction of the}} Milky Way core. His son John Herschel repeated this study in the southern hemisphere and found a corresponding increase in the same direction. In addition to his other accomplishments, William Herschel is also noted for his discovery that some stars do not merely lie along the same line <b>of</b> <b>sight,</b> but are also physical companions that form binary star systems.|$|E

Ignoring the magician's warning that they will need special powers, the pair set off for the palace but are quickly driven back by Armida's monsters. The magician then gives them magic wands that transcend Armida's power, and they set off again. This time they {{overcome}} the monsters, but as they reach {{the gates of the}} palace it disappears, leaving them clinging to a rock {{in the midst of a}} stormy sea.

5|$|Another {{leading cause}} of {{blindness}} is Canine glaucoma. This {{is an increase in}} the pressure of the fluid in the eye which, if left untreated, can cause visual impairment and eventual loss <b>of</b> <b>sight.</b> The condition can be inherited (Primary glaucoma) or a secondary condition to a variety of other eye issues including tumors or lens luxation. Both breeds are affected by juvenile cataracts which can occur at up to four years of age. Symptoms can include discoloring of the pupil, and treatment may include surgery to remove the cataract.|$|E

5|$|Despite Stroheim's {{reputation}} as a perfectionist, Greed contains anachronisms. In the scenes on Polk Street, the main characters are clothed in 1890s fashions, but the extras wear 1920s clothing.

5|$|Elizabeth Randles, {{also known}} as Bessy, was born on 1 August 1800 in Wrexham, north Wales. Her father, Edward Randles, the organist at the Holywell parish church of St. James, lost his sight {{at the age of}} three as a result of small pox. Perhaps due to his lack <b>of</b> <b>sight,</b> his parents placed him to be trained under the blind harpist John Parry, whom he excelled under. Randles was the {{youngest}} of Randles' several children including her brother Edward, who would become a subsequent organist at the parish church.|$|E
5|$|Endeavour then resumed her voyage westward {{along the}} coast, picking {{a path through}} {{intermittent}} shoals and reefs {{with the help of}} the pinnace, which was rowed ahead to test the water depth.

To keep Endeavours voyages and discoveries secret, Cook confiscated the log books and journals of all on board and ordered them to remain silent about where they had been.|$|E

5|$|Head {{injury is}} present in ancient myths that may date back before {{recorded}} history. Skulls found in battleground graves with holes drilled over fracture lines suggest that trepanation {{may have been used}} to treat TBI in ancient times. Ancient Mesopotamians knew of head injury and some of its effects, including seizures, paralysis, and loss <b>of</b> <b>sight,</b> hearing or speech. The Edwin Smith Papyrus, written around 1650–1550BC, describes various head injuries and symptoms and classifies them based on their presentation and tractability. Ancient Greek physicians including Hippocrates understood the brain {{to be the center of}} thought, probably due to their experience with head trauma.|$|E

40|$|We {{challenge}} {{the hypothesis that}} fin whales use a magnetic sense to guide migration by testing for associations between geophysical parameters and the positions where fin whales were observed over the continental shelf off the northeastern United States. Monte Carlo simulations estimated {{the probability that the}} distribution <b>of</b> fin whale <b>sighting</b> was random with respect to bottom depth, bottom slope and the intensity and gradient of the geomagnetic field. The simulations demonstrated no overall association <b>of</b> <b>sighting</b> positions with any of these four geophysical parameters. Analysis of the data by season, however, demonstrated statistically reliable associations <b>of</b> <b>sighting</b> positions with areas of low geomagnetic intensity and gradient in winter and fall, respectively, but no association <b>of</b> <b>sighting</b> positions with bathymetric parameters in any season. An attempt to focus on migrating animals by excluding those observed feeding confirmed the associations <b>of</b> <b>sighting</b> positions with low geomagnetic intensity and gradient in winter and fall, respectively, and revealed additional associations with low geomagnetic gradients in winter and spring. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that fin whales, and perhaps other mysticete species, possess a magnetic sense that they use to guide migration...|$|R
