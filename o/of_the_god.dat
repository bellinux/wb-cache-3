5|$|Brown {{had also}} speculated that Persephone, the wife <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>god</b> Pluto, {{would be a}} good name for the object. The name had been used several times in science fiction, and was popular with the public, having handily won a poll {{conducted}} by New Scientist magazine ("Xena", despite only being a nickname, came fourth). This was not possible once the object was classified as a dwarf planet, because there is already an asteroid with that name, 399 Persephone.|$|E

5|$|Corippus narrates the {{subsequent}} battle at length, but his imitation of Virgilian verse provides little concrete detail: {{it is clear}} that it was a long, indecisive, and bloody conflict, which probably took place to the south or east of Sbeitla in late 546 or early 547. Eventually, the Byzantines prevailed and drove back the Moors, breaking through their defences and storming their camp. According to Corippus, Ierna, who was the chief priest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>god</b> Gurzil, was killed while trying to protect an image <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>god.</b> Many other tribal leaders fell, and the remainder scattered. The remains of the Tripolitanian tribes abandoned Byzacena, and Antalas was forced to lay down arms. In addition, many prisoners were released from the Moorish camp, and among the treasures captured there were the military standards lost by Solomon at Cillium in 544. These were dispatched to Constantinople, while Troglita held a triumphal entry into Carthage.|$|E
