Payment {{was made in the}} form of cash and crude <b>oil.</b> <b>Delivery</b> of this order spread from 1981 to 1983. By 1982, Iran's major military supplier was North Korea, with sales in that year of $800 million. It provided, to Iran, both indigenously produced Soviet-standard equipment, as well as acting as an intermediary for both China and the Soviet Union. Some came from North Korean military stocks and were replaced by the originating country, while others were merely transshipped, still in the original factory crate. Iran rejected much of the equipment made in North Korea because of its poor quality.|$|E

Hess worked as a driver for his father's company and - after it went bankrupt in 1933 during the Great Depression - he reorganized the company. He built an oil terminal in Perth Amboy, New Jersey out of old oil tankers and aggressively underbid his competitors to win Federal oil contracts.

5000|$|The Verifier {{makes use}} of {{ultrasound}} technology, a method of using high-intensity acoustic energy which is above the limits of human hearing. Just as it has done for other fields, ultrasound technology offers unprecedented access and accuracy with The Verifier. [...] The old system of measuring oil deliveries and inventory involves either climbing onto the tank and ‘sticking it’ with a ruler or pumping air into a petrometer and converting a pressure reading {{of the weight of}} the oil. These systems were developed when oil was inexpensive and when accuracy and convenience were not essential. Verifier technology confirms an <b>oil</b> <b>delivery</b> within 1/10 of an inch, recording the exact date, time and amount of heating oil delivered to the tank and checking the amount of heating oil delivered. An ultrasonic ping is sent from the device to the heating oil, an echo is received back, and the Verifier’s complex, patented algorithm then figures the time between when the ping was sent and the echo received, compensating for oil temperature variations. The system is precise, safe, and clean. The history of ultrasound technology began in 1794, when Italian Lazzaro Spallanzani (1729 - 1799) first noticed the phenomenon in nature. The human application of ultrasound technology developed remarkably in the last 100 years, and was influenced heavily by World War I and by World War II, in which Sonar, or sound navigation and ranging, was utilized. Following World War II, applications of ultrasound developed, transforming many industries.|$|E
50|$|The DBR2 {{was created}} from a short lived Lagonda project known as DP166 (DP for Development Project), This was a multi tube, back bone space frame chassis {{designed}} by Willy Watson. This was a progression from the DP115 'wide tubed ladder type' chassis which {{was similar to}} that used in the DB3S. Both the DP115 and the DP166 chassis were originally fitted with the failed Lagonda 4.5L V12 engine. All Three of the DP166 chassis made were leaning up {{against the wall of the}} Feltham racing department awaiting their fate, that was until the chief race car designer for Aston Martin at that time Ted Cutting was asked by John Wyer to build two race cars from two of the three chassis. The engines to be used were the new Tadek Marek designed 6 cylinder, 3.7 litre unit. He had just completed this engine for the forthcoming DB4. Ted Cutting was allocated four of the six prototype DB4 engines made, these to be used in the DBR2 cars. This was much to the dismay of Tadek Marek. When Ted Cutting got his hands on the newly designed DB4 engines, he made some fundamental changes to the <b>oil</b> <b>delivery</b> system before the unit was fitted into the production DB4s. In 1958, due to the horrific crash at Le Man some years before, a 3000 cc limit was put on championship race car engines, so the DBR2s at 3.700 cc could no longer compete at championship events. Sir David Brown then had the idea to send both the DBR2s to the USA and to use them as a promotional tool for his new DB4. Both DBR2s were sent to the USA with Rex Woodgate and used to good effect.|$|E
5000|$|Populism has {{remained}} a significant force in Latin America. Populism has recently been reappearing on the left with promises of far-reaching socialist changes as seen in Venezuela under Hugo Chávez, and in Bolivia under Evo Morales—a process, however, seen by some as contradictory {{as it tries to}} meld the populist traditional celebration of folk wisdom and charismatic leadership with doctrinaire socialism. And, in fact, [...] "socialist" [...] changes in today's Venezuela have mostly included the expenditure of oil revenue to benefit the working poor as a form of social welfare to help enable an eventual (and imprecise) socialist transformation. For some authors, as far as ideology is concerned, Chávez's political blueprint is more of a [...] "throwback" [...] to traditional populist nationalism and redistributivism. [...] The Venezuelan government often spars verbally with the United States and accuses it of attempting to overthrow Chavez after supporting a failed coup against him. Chavez {{had been one of the}} most outspoken and blunt critics of US foreign policy. Nevertheless, a large commodity trade continues between Venezuela and the US because of the economic constraints of <b>oil</b> <b>delivery</b> and the proximity of the two countries. When Hugo Chávez took power in Venezuela nearly 20 years ago, the leftist populism he championed was supposed to save democracy. Instead, it has led to democracy’s implosion in the country... The New York Times, April 2017 [...] Because populist tradition ascertains the paramountcy of the [...] "people" [...] (instead of class) as a political subject, it suffices to say that, in the 21st century, the large numbers of voters living in extreme poverty in Latin America {{has remained}} a bastion of support for new populist candidates. By early 2008 governments with varying forms of populism and with some form of left leaning (albeit vague) social democratic or democratic socialist platform had come to dominate virtually all Latin American nations with the exceptions of Colombia, El Salvador and Mexico. This political shift includes both more developed nations such as Argentina's Front for Victory and Chile's Socialist Party, and smaller income countries like Bolívia with its Movement towards Socialism and Paraguay with the Patriotic Alliance for Change. Even in middle-income Mexico, a populist candidate like López Obrador, albeit defeated, nevertheless appeared as part of a strong neopopulist reaction. Nevertheless, populist candidates have been more successful in poorer Latin American countries such as Bolivia (under Morales), Ecuador (under Rafael Correa) and Nicaragua (under Daniel Ortega). By the use of broad grassroots movements populist groups have managed to gain power from better organized, funded and entrenched groups such as the Bolivian Nationalist Democratic Action and the Paraguayan Colorado Party. Some people see also parallels with the Work Party in Brazil, with President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and his successor Dilma Rousseff, that used the State controlled Oil company Petrobras to illegally fund their Party, big Companies, and Politicians, while at the same time used populism strategies to get good results on the polls and elections.|$|E
