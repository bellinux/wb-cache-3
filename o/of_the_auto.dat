5|$|In the age <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>auto</b> trail, {{the roads}} that later formed US2 through the UP {{were given a}} few {{different}} highway names. When the original roadways between Ironwood and Iron River were completed in late 1915, the Upper Peninsula Development Bureau (UPDB) named the area Cloverland and the highway the Cloverland Trail. Later the name was extended over the highway to Escanaba, and to all highways {{in the area in}} the early 1920s; the name was phased out by the UPDB completely in 1927. The roadways were also used for the Theodore Roosevelt International Highway, named for former US president Theodore Roosevelt after his death in 1919. Overall, this highway ran from Portland, Oregon, to Portland, Maine, by way of Michigan and the Canadian province of Ontario. Through the UP, the southern branch followed the immediate predecessors to US2, including the section through Florence County, Wisconsin.|$|E

5|$|Indiana became {{politically}} {{influential and}} {{played an important}} role in the Union during the American Civil War. Indiana was the first western state to mobilize for the war, and its soldiers participated in almost every engagement during the war. Following the Civil War, Indiana remained politically important as it became a critical swing state in U.S. Presidential elections. It helped decide control of the presidency for three decades. During the Indiana Gas Boom of the late 19thcentury, industry began to develop rapidly in the state. The state's Golden Age of Literature began in the same time period, increasing its cultural influence. By the early 20th century, Indiana developed into a strong manufacturing state and attracted numerous immigrants and internal migrants to its industries. It experienced setbacks during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Construction of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, expansion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>auto</b> industry, urban development, and two wars contributed to the state's industrial growth. During the second half of the 20thcentury, Indiana became a leader in the pharmaceutical industry due to the innovations of companies such as Eli Lilly.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{was also}} part of the East Michigan Pike, {{designed}} to be a counterpart of the West Michigan Pike {{on the other side of}} the LP. The original route of the East Michigan Pike included a section along the coast of The Thumb between Bay City and Port Huron and used the same route as the Dixie Highway north of Bay City. Backers of this auto trail lost out in terms of name recognition to the Dixie Highway, relegating the East Michigan Pike to the list of failed auto trails. The southern part of what is now US23 in the state was also part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>auto</b> trail craze. The Top of Michigan Trail was designated in 1917 from the state line north to the Bay City area, before turning inland along other roadways. The name faded from shortly after the time the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) assigned the first highway numbers in the state.|$|E

25|$|The {{gasoline}} {{crises of}} 1973 and 1979 also affected Detroit and the U.S. auto industry. Buyers chose smaller, more fuel-efficient cars made by foreign makers {{as the price}} of gas rose. Efforts to revive the city were stymied by the struggles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>auto</b> industry, as their sales and market share declined. Automakers laid off thousands of employees and closed plants in the city, further eroding the tax base. To counteract this, the city used eminent domain to build two large new auto assembly plants in the city.|$|E

25|$|Florida {{is served}} by Amtrak, {{operating}} numerous lines throughout, connecting the state's largest cities to points north in the United States and Canada. The busiest Amtrak train stations in Florida in 2011 were: Sanford (259,944), Orlando (179,142), Tampa Union Station (140,785), Miami (94,556), and Jacksonville (74,733). Sanford, in Greater Orlando, is the southern terminus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Auto</b> Train, which originates at Lorton, Virginia, south of Washington, D.C. Until 2005, Orlando was also the eastern terminus of the Sunset Limited, which travels across the southern United States via New Orleans, Houston, and San Antonio to its western terminus of Los Angeles.

25|$|By {{the time}} the U.S. Highway system was {{finalized}} in late 1926, one relatively minor change {{had been made to}} US2; it was swapped with US1 between Bangor and Houlton, Maine, placing US2 along the entire portion of Route 15 east of St. Johnsbury. Several other major parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>auto</b> trail received numbers, most notably US30 from Portland, Oregon east to Pendleton, US195 in eastern Washington, and US23 in Michigan's Lower Peninsula. In the mid-1930s, much of New York's portion of the road became US104, and the part southeast of Littleton, New Hampshire to Portland, Maine became US302, but by far the longest piece was that followed by US2 between St. Ignace and Bonners Ferry. In 1946, US2 was extended west of its original western terminus in Bonners Ferry in Idaho to Everett in Washington via Spokane along what was then Alternate US10.|$|E
