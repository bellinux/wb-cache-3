[...]The Great Perfection, in its {{unbiased}} inclusivity, actualizes {{the meaning}} of self-sprung awareness.As the lion overawes all other beasts with his roar, so the language <b>of</b> Great <b>Perfection</b> commands the gradual approaches; speaking a tongue of its own, it engenders its own ultimate meaning. The land <b>of</b> natural <b>perfection</b> is free <b>of</b> buddhas and sentient beings; the ground <b>of</b> natural <b>perfection</b> is free <b>of</b> good and bad; the path <b>of</b> natural <b>perfection</b> has no length; the fruition <b>of</b> natural <b>perfection</b> can neither be avoided nor attained; the body <b>of</b> natural <b>perfection</b> is neither existent nor nonexistent; the speech <b>of</b> natural <b>perfection</b> is neither sacred nor profane; and the mind <b>of</b> natural <b>perfection</b> has no substance nor attribute.The space <b>of</b> natural <b>perfection</b> cannot be consumed nor voided; the status <b>of</b> natural <b>perfection</b> is neither high nor low; the praxis <b>of</b> natural <b>perfection</b> is neither developed nor neglected; the potency <b>of</b> natural <b>perfection</b> is neither fulfilled nor frustrated; the display <b>of</b> natural <b>perfection</b> is neither manifest nor latent; the actuality <b>of</b> natural <b>perfection</b> is neither cultivated nor ignored; and the gnosis <b>of</b> natural <b>perfection</b> is neither visible nor invisible.The hidden awareness <b>of</b> natural <b>perfection</b> is everywhere, its parameters beyond indication, its actuality incommunicable; the sovereign view <b>of</b> natural <b>perfection</b> is the here-and-now, naturally present without speech or books, irrespective of conceptual clarity or dullness, but as spontaneous joyful creativity its reality is nothing at all. In the verse of homage, the first, second and third lines reveal the self-sprung natural essence while the fourth line shows familiarity with that unchanging space of reality. The fruition <b>of</b> natural <b>perfection</b> is distinguished from our ordinary disposition by {{nothing more than an}} indication about the existential ground (the starting point that is 'basic total presence' adduced in the first line of the vajra-homage). All experience, therefore, is revealed as perfect and complete in the gnosis of pure mind.There is no imperfection anywhere: Perfect in one, perfect in two, perfect in all, life is blissfully easy.Unity is perfect as unitary pure mind, duality is perfect as the mind's creation, and multiplicity is abundant completion. In the transmission <b>of</b> the <b>perfection</b> <b>of</b> unity lies the pure buddha-dynamic; the teaching on the <b>perfection</b> <b>of</b> duality reveals everything as perfect projection; and by virtue <b>of</b> the <b>perfection</b> <b>of</b> multiplicity everything turns whole and splendid. Abiding here, doing nothing, embodied as man or god, our dynamic is buddha-reality; here sentient beings are cared for, And without any exertion we live in ease.|$|R

5|$|Silkies {{appear in}} two {{distinct}} varieties: bearded and non-bearded. Bearded Silkies {{have an extra}} muff of feathers under the beak area that covers the earlobes. They also are separated according to color. Colors of Silkie recognized for competitive showing include black, blue, buff, grey, partridge, and white. Alternative hues, such as cuckoo, lavender, red, and splash also exist. The standards <b>of</b> <b>perfection</b> call for all Silkies to have a small walnut-colored comb, dark wattles, and turquoise-blue earlobes. In addition to these defining characteristics, Silkies have five toes on each foot. Other breeds which exhibit this rare trait include the Dorking, Faverolles, and Sultan.|$|E

5|$|Silkies are {{considered}} a bantam breed in some countries, but this varies according to region and many breed standards class them officially as large fowl; the bantam Silkie is actually a separate variety most of the time. Almost all North American strains of the breed are bantam-sized, but in Europe the standard-sized is the original version. However, even standard Silkies are relatively small chickens, with the males weighing only four pounds (1.8kg), and females weighing three pounds (1.36kg). The American Standard <b>of</b> <b>Perfection</b> calls for males that are 36 ounces (1kg), and females that are 32 ounces (910grams).|$|E

5|$|Aristotle {{stated in}} the History of Animals that all beings were {{arranged}} in a fixed scale <b>of</b> <b>perfection,</b> reflected in their form (eidos). They stretched from minerals to plants and animals, and on up to man, forming the scala naturae or great chain of being. His system had eleven grades, arranged according to the potentiality of each being, expressed in their form at birth. The highest animals gave birth to warm and wet creatures alive, the lowest bore theirs cold, dry, and in thick eggs. The system was based on Aristotle's interpretation of the four elements in his On Generation and Corruption: Fire (hot and dry); Air (hot and wet); Water (cold and wet); and Earth (cold and dry). These are arranged from the most energetic to the least, so the warm, wet young raised in a womb with a placenta were higher on the scale than the cold, dry, nearly mineral eggs of birds. However, Aristotle is careful never to insist that a group fits perfectly in the scale; he knows animals have many combinations of attributes, and that placements are approximate.|$|E

5|$|Aristotle, {{and nearly}} all Western {{scholars}} after him until the 18th century, believed that creatures were arranged in a graded scale <b>of</b> <b>perfection</b> rising from plants on up to humans: the scala naturae or Great Chain of Being. Aristotle's successor at the Lyceum, Theophrastus, wrote a series of books on botany—the History of Plants—which survived {{as the most important}} contribution of antiquity to botany, even into the Middle Ages. Many of Theophrastus' names survive into modern times, such as carpos for fruit, and pericarpion for seed vessel. Dioscorides wrote a pioneering and encyclopaedic pharmacopoeia, De Materia Medica, incorporating descriptions of some 600 plants and their uses in medicine. Pliny the Elder, in his Natural History, assembled a similarly encyclopaedic account of things in nature, including accounts of many plants and animals.|$|E

The sledges were constructed from Norwegian ash with steel-shod runners made from American hickory. Skis, also fashioned from hickory, were extra long to reduce the likelihood of slipping into crevasses. The tents—"the strongest and most practical that have ever been used"—had built-in floors and required a single pole. For cooking on the march, Amundsen chose the Swedish Primus stove rather than the special cooker devised by Nansen, because he felt the latter took up too much space.|$|E
5|$|With {{the breed}} that carries his name, John Sebright {{intentionally}} {{set out to}} create a very small bantam chicken with laced plumage similar to the laced variety of Polish chickens. Although the exact makeup of the breed is uncertain, he {{is thought to have}} crossed British, Hamburgh, Nankin and Polish birds with a base of Rosecombs before achieving a laced chicken that would breed true. After the breed's establishment circa 1810, Sebright founded The Sebright Bantam Club, which was the very first individual breed association for chickens. The breed has appeared in the American Poultry Association's Standard <b>of</b> <b>Perfection</b> since the first edition in 1874. Today, the breed is one of the ten most popular bantam chickens, according to the American Bantam Association.|$|E

5|$|Existence is a single, {{objective}} and simple reality, {{and there is}} no difference between its parts, unless in terms <b>of</b> <b>perfection</b> and imperfection, strength, and weakness… And the culmination of its perfection, where there is nothing more perfect, is its independence from any other thing. Nothing more perfect should be conceivable, as every imperfect thing belongs to another thing and needs to become perfect. And, as it has already been explicated, perfection is prior to imperfection, actuality to potency, and existence to non-existence. Also, it has been explained that the perfection of a thing is the thing itself, and not a thing in addition to it. Thus, either existence is independent of others or it is in need of others. The former is the Necessary, which is pure existence. Nothing is more perfect than Him. And in Him {{there is no room for}} non-existence or imperfection. The latter is other than Him, and is regarded as His acts and effects, and for other than Him there is no subsistence, unless through Him. For there is no imperfection in the reality of existence, and imperfection is added to existence only because of the quality of being caused, as it is impossible for an effect to be identical with its cause in terms of existence.|$|E
