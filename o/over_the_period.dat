5|$|Bookends is {{a concept}} album that explores a life journey from {{childhood}} to old age. Side one of the album marks successive stages in life, the theme serving as bookends to the life cycle. Side two largely consists of unused material for The Graduate soundtrack. Simon's lyrics concern youth, disillusionment, relationships, old age, and mortality. Much of the material was crafted alongside producer John Simon, who joined the recording when Simon suffered from writer's block. The album was recorded gradually <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>period</b> of a year, with production speeding up around the later months of 1967.|$|E
