[...] The charter's title is thus part of the Constitution." [...] MacLellan believed the amending formula needed would be the one requiring the support of seven provincial governments representing at least half of Canada's population. [...] Edmonton Southwest MP Ian McClelland had suggested the change, believing it to be necessary because [...] "I felt we were becoming a nation of entitlement."
