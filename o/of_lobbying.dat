40|$|This paper {{provides}} a theory <b>of</b> <b>lobby</b> formation within a {{framework in which}} trade policy is determined through political contributions. Under certain conditions, free trade {{turns out to be}} an equilibrium outcome either when the government has a high affinity for political contributions or when it cares a great deal about social welfare. Moreover, greater inequality in asset distribution results in a greater number <b>of</b> <b>lobbies</b> and, in most cases, more protection for each <b>of</b> these <b>lobbies.</b> Furthermore, industries with higher levels of capital stock, fewer capitalists, more inelastic demand, and smaller geographical dispersion are the ones that get organized. ...|$|R

Almost immediately they began aggressive patrols in order to dominate the Japanese in their area of operations and were tasked with the capture of several key positions including Wearne's Hill, Base Point 3, Tokua and Sisivie and to establish a forward position in the Wakunai Valley.

5|$|Netball is an Olympic {{recognised}} sport, {{a status}} attained in 1995 after a twenty-year period <b>of</b> <b>lobbying.</b> It {{has never been}} played at the Summer Olympics, but with recognition a formal requirement for inclusion is met. The absence at the Olympic Games was seen by the netball community as a hindrance to the global growth of the game, depriving it of media attention and funding. Inclusion is hampered, because it is mainly played by women, and mostly in Commonwealth countries. When the sport gained recognition, it opened up sources of funds that the global netball community {{had not been able}} to access before, including the International Olympic Committee (IOC), national Olympic committees and sports organisations, and state and federal governments.|$|E
5|$|The new {{voting system}} {{increased}} the socialists' influence in parliament significantly, but its major beneficiaries were the Catholic Party. Partly {{as a result}} of the creation of a Catholic populist challenger, the Christian People's Party, the Catholic Party embraced the new ideology of Social Catholicism introduced following the papal Rerum novarum encyclical of 1891. This gained it considerable popular support, especially in Flanders. In 1894, the Belgian Workers' Party adopted the Charter of Quaregnon, which would form the basis of its ideology until 1979. By 1911, the party had 276,000 members, making it one of the most successful Socialist parties in Europe. As a result <b>of</b> <b>lobbying</b> by the Belgian Workers' Party, Belgium was one of the first countries in Europe to launch a comprehensive social insurance scheme, including sickness compensation (from 1894), voluntary old-age insurance (1900) and unemployment insurance (1907). The big losers from voting reform were the Liberals who lost almost all their parliamentary representation in the years between 1894 and 1900.|$|E

5|$|The {{right to}} be identified, known as the right of paternity, applies to the creators of {{original}} literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works; for films, the {{right to be}} identified is granted to the director rather than the writer. Some specific types of work are not protected by this right, particularly those made to report current events, periodicals, newspapers or encyclopaedias. These exceptions were included as a result <b>of</b> <b>lobbying</b> by the publishing industry, and the fear that the need to name the author of a current events report could interfere with its speedy delivery, and undermine the image of the news as objective and neutral. Under Section 79, {{the right to be}} identified also does not apply to authors of computer programs, computer-generated works, typefaces or works protected by crown copyright. On those works which are covered by this moral right, {{there is a need to}} assert it; this may be done through an instrument assigning copyright, or any other instrument written by the author or director. If the asserting is done through a document designed to assign copyright, it binds the assignee and anyone who claims through him, with or without notice; if it is done through another instrument, it only applies to those who are directly informed of the assertion.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that if countries "merge", (i. e. move to centralized policy choices) the effect is to reduce lobbying.

This paper explains the empirical evidence in a two-jurisdiction political economy model of public good provision under policy centralization and policy decentralization, where the policy choice can be affected by the pressure <b>of</b> endogenously formed <b>lobbies.</b> We measure lobbying in three ways:(i) the number <b>of</b> <b>lobbies</b> formed under the two settings, (ii) their impact on policy decisions and (iii) the amount of resources transferred to the policy makers. We show that preference heterogeneity and lobby formation are positively related and that moving from decentralization to centralization can a. ect both the number and the type <b>of</b> <b>lobbies.</b> We develop some examples; among them: under centralization, compared to decentralization, the size <b>of</b> <b>lobbies</b> can be higher but the impact on policy can be smaller. Moreover we show how the majority groups try to o. set lobbying by strategic voting for a candidate of a different group...|$|R
40|$|This Note {{explores the}} current {{practice}} <b>of</b> <b>lobby</b> conferences in Massachusetts district courts.

As this Note examines the reasons why lobby conferences have a unique role in district courts, it also highlights how the lack of record makes it nearly impossible for indigent criminal defendants to hold their attorneys accountable for anything that happens at these proceedings. This Note argues that mandating recording <b>of</b> <b>lobby</b> conferences will be circumvented by the courts.
