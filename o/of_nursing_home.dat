25|$|Elderspeak can in fact {{contribute}} to decreased comprehension, and can increase confusion. Early social scientists first identified elderspeak and estimated that 20% {{of the communication}} occurring in nursing homes is actually elderspeak (Caporael, 1981). Caretakers <b>of</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>home</b> residents must be particularly careful when using elderspeak. Although elderspeak {{has been shown to}} help older adults with dementia and Alzheimer’s in language comprehension, they are not immune to feeling disrespected when it is used. Resisting care is an ongoing problem with dementia patients, as well as violent behaviour, and residents of nursing homes are more likely to resist care when their nurse uses elderspeak. Care givers may assume that the elder prefers the nurturing of elderspeak but older adults think of it as demeaning. Older adults in both institutional settings and those receiving home care services report that as many as 40% of their caregivers use speech they perceive as demeaning, and 75% of the interactions that elderly people have are with the staff of the nursing homes.|$|E

50|$|In the United States, {{concerns}} about poor quality care and ineffective regulation <b>of</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> {{date back to}} the 1970s.

In the 1980s, particularly in response to an influential Institute of Medicine (IoM) report, the US federal government moved to address these concerns by enacting more resident-focused regulations, and among these were a number of new quality-of-life rights for residents <b>of</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>homes.</b> Similar concerns over quality of care motivated people in other countries to advocate for residents' rights.|$|R

40|$|Background: Few {{accounts}} of patient safety initiatives in <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> exist. Objective: To (1) determine safety culture scores for <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> and (2) compare these results with existing data from hospitals. Methods: Data {{were collected from}} a nationally representative sample <b>of</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> (n = 2840 completed surveys and {{a response rate of}} 71 %). From these <b>nursing</b> <b>homes,</b> administrators completed The Hospital Survey On Patient Safety Culture (HSOPSC) instrument. Results: 11 of the 12 HSOPSC subscale scores from the <b>nursing</b> <b>home</b> sample were considerably lower than the benchmark hospital scores. In addition, almost all item scores from <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> were considerably lower than the benchmark hospital scores. These results indicate that a less well-developed safety culture exists in <b>nursing</b> <b>homes.</b> Conclusions: The results clearly show that the patient safety culture scores <b>of</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> are considerably lower than those of hospitals.
