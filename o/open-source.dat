5|$|While ReactOS has the aim {{to build}} a Windows-compatible kernel as <b>open-source</b> software, much of the {{surrounding}} required functionality to create a complete OS is already available in the greater <b>open-source</b> ecosystem. When available and possible, ReactOS therefore builds on and collaborates with already existing <b>open-source</b> projects. Conversely, projects like Wine, former Captive NTFS, and Longene re-use the <b>open-source</b> ReactOS code-base as well.|$|E

5|$|Folding@home {{uses the}} Cosm {{software}} libraries for networking. Folding@home was launched on October1, 2000, {{and was the}} first distributed computing project aimed at bio-molecular systems. Its first client was a screensaver, which would run while the computer was not otherwise in use. In 2004, the Pande lab collaborated with David P. Anderson to test a supplemental client on the <b>open-source</b> BOINC framework. This client was released to closed beta in April 2005; however, the method became unworkable and was shelved in June 2006.|$|E
5|$|GTRI is {{the primary}} {{contractor}} of the Homeland Open Security Technology program, which aims to promote the creation and use of open security and <b>open-source</b> software in the United States government and military, especially in areas pertaining to computer security.

5|$|Professional {{software}} developers {{are responsible for}} most of Folding@home's code, both for the client and server-side. The development team includes programmers from Nvidia, ATI, Sony, and Cauldron Development. Clients can be downloaded only from the official Folding@home website or its commercial partners, and will only interact with Folding@home computer files. They will upload and download data with Stanford's Folding@home data servers (over port8080, with 80 as an alternate), and the communication is verified using 2048-bit digital signatures. While the client's graphical user interface (GUI) is <b>open-source,</b> the client is proprietary software citing security and scientific integrity as the reasons.|$|E
