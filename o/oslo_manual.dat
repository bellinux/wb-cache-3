40|$|The journey towards {{carving out}} {{a place for}} the {{creative}} industries within innovation research, scholarship, policy and programme planning and delivery has barely begun. Public policy’s interest in innovation is relatively recent, being formed in a context in which western (and, increasingly, non-western) governments have re-introduced themselves to an active interventionary role {{in a number of areas}} of industry and human capital development—set against the small government and deregulatory trends of the 1970 s and 1980 s and the end of the Keynesian settlement. These interests have followed a largely science- and technology-based template for what counts as innovation and R&D largely in the agriculture, manufacturing and mining sectors, based resolutely on the OECD’s <b>Oslo</b> and Frascati <b>manuals.</b> There has however been an increasing need to accommodate the arguments and evidence for innovation in the services sector.

30|$|Following {{the rather}} {{exclusive}} definition of innovation given by Schumpeter (1934 [2012]), {{the concept of}} innovation has become multi-faceted in later years. Based {{on the degree of}} novelty, innovation is commonly classified as either radical or incremental. Radical innovation is understood as a totally new product, process, marketing method or organisational method, in line with the Schumpeterian definition (Schumpeter, 1934 [2012]), while an incremental innovation is understood as a step-by-step improvement of existing solutions (Fagerberg et al. 2005). Innovation novelty is also central to The <b>Oslo</b> <b>Manual</b> for collecting and interpreting data about firms’ innovation performance, where the degree of novelty is divided into geographically separated groups. According to The <b>Oslo</b> <b>Manual,</b> innovation can be classified as either new to the firm, new to the market or new to the world (OECD/Eurostat 2005, p. 57).|$|E

30|$|Studies on the {{measurement}} of innovation in the developing country context reveal certain implications for the innovation systems approach. One such implication is the non-inclusion of the learning and capacity building processes in developing economies, hence the absence of some relevant innovation indicators (Sutz, 2012). This is {{as a result of}} the uniqueness of the innovation activities in developing countries which sets them far from the frontiers of the innovation system approach as pioneered by developed countries. There is in fact, a multidimensional view of innovation that extends beyond innovation as an output of the R&D investments of firms. The <b>Oslo</b> <b>manual</b> of 1997 explains innovation as technologically new or improved products and processes (OECD, 1997), appearing to exclude the non-technological aspects of innovation which are important to developing countries. Thankfully, however, the 2005 <b>Oslo</b> <b>manual</b> expanded the scope of innovation to include marketing and organisational innovations.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this article was to {{identify}} the innovations developed at the Port of Rio Grande, according to the dimensions of the <b>Oslo</b> <b>Manual,</b> related to environmental management in the period 2010 – 2012. It also analyzed whether the possible innovations developed by the port relate to the assessment requirements of environmental management, proposed by ANTAQ. For this, we used a type of qualitative content analysis, with in-depth interviews applied to a population of thirty port managers, and a quantitative study which sought to examine whether the innovations obtained are related to the assessment requirements of environmental management. As a result, 45 innovations were identified, these being classified according to the <b>Oslo</b> <b>Manual</b> in: 2 product innovations; 14 process innovations; 5 marketing innovations; and 24 organizational innovations. Considering the frequency of occurrence of innovations in the sector, the requirement of ANTAQ implementing the environmental agenda presented the highest number of innovations, mainly related to process innovations...|$|E
