5|$|In 1928, Fairley {{received}} an appointment in London as Assistant Physician to the Hospital for Tropical Diseases and Lecturer at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Although he and Kellaway convinced the governors to delay Fairley's commencement until their major venom work was completed, he departed for London {{by the end}} of that year. He also opened a consulting practice in Harley Street. In London he encountered patients with filariasis and devised a test to diagnose the disease at an early stage; but when he went to write up his results he discovered that details of a similar test had already been published. In 1934, a sewer worker was referred to his ward with acute jaundice which Fairley diagnosed as caused by filariasis. The disease was revealed to be an <b>occupational</b> <b>hazard</b> of sewer workers, and steps were taken to protect the workers. Perhaps his most important work in this period was research into blackwater fever. Since malaria cases were uncommon in the United Kingdom, he made annual visits to the Malaria Research Laboratory of the League of Nations at the Refugee Hospital in Salonika. In the process, he described methaemalbumin, a previously unknown blood pigment. For his scientific accomplishments in London, Fairley was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1942.|$|E

Historically, <b>occupational</b> <b>hazards</b> and obesity have been addressed as separate unrelated issues, but both are public health problems {{and there may be}} public health benefits from considering them together. This paper provides a framework for the concurrent consideration of <b>occupational</b> <b>hazards</b> and obesity. The framework consists of the following elements: (i) investigate the relationship between <b>occupational</b> <b>hazards</b> and obesity, (ii) explore the impact of occupational morbidity and mortality and obesity on workplace absence, disability, productivity and healthcare costs, (iii) assess the utility of the workplace as a venue for obesity prevention programs, (iv) promote a comprehensive approach to worker health and (v) identify and address the ethical, legal and social issues. Utilizing this framework may advance the efforts to address the major societal health problems of <b>occupational</b> <b>hazards</b> and obesity...|$|R

25|$|Research {{is ongoing}} into {{occupational}} hazards {{that may be}} specific to women. Of particular interest are potential environmental causes of breast cancer and cervical cancer. Sexual harassment is an <b>occupational</b> <b>hazard</b> for many women, and can cause serious negative symptoms including anxiety, depression, nausea, headache, insomnia, and feelings of low self-esteem and alienation.

25|$|Women {{tend to have}} {{different}} occupational hazards and health issues than men in the workplace. Women get carpal tunnel syndrome, tendonitis, anxiety disorders, stress, respiratory diseases, and infectious diseases due to their work at higher rates than men. The reasons for these differences may be differences in biology or in the work that women are performing. Women's higher rates of job-related stress {{may be due to}} the fact that women are often caregivers at home and do contingent work and contract work at a much higher rate than men. Another significant <b>occupational</b> <b>hazard</b> for women is homicide, which was the second most frequent cause of death on the job for women in 2011, making up 26% of workplace deaths in women. Immigrant women are at higher risk for occupational injury than native-born women in the United States, due to higher rates of employment in dangerous industries.|$|E

500|$|After a {{short period}} of leave during which he moved his family back to New Concord, and {{two and a half months}} of jet {{training}} at Cherry Point, Glenn was ordered to South Korea in October 1952, late in the Korean War. [...] Before he set out for Korea in February 1953, he applied for an inter-service exchange position with the U.S. Air Force (USAF) to fly the F-86 Sabre jet fighter-interceptor. In preparation, he arranged with Colonel Leon W. Gray to check out the F-86 at Otis Air Force Base in Massachusetts. Glenn reported to K-3 on February 3, 1953, and was assigned to VMF-311, one of two Marine fighter squadrons there, as its operations officer. VMF-311, equipped with the F9F Panther jet fighter-bomber, was assigned a variety of missions. Glenn flew his first, a reconnaissance flight, on February 26. He flew 63 combat missions in Korea with VMF-311, and was nicknamed [...] "Magnet Ass" [...] because of his ability to attract enemy flak (an <b>occupational</b> <b>hazard</b> of low-level close air support missions); twice, he returned to base with over 250 holes in his plane.

40|$|Abstract: This study aims {{to explore}} the {{efficiency}} of using online education as an intervention measure to prevent <b>occupational</b> <b>hazards</b> in a clinical nursing setting. The subjects were 320 female nursing staff from two hospitals in Taiwan. The questionnaire {{results indicated that the}} subjects primarily experienced human factor <b>occupational</b> <b>hazards,</b> as well as psychological and social hazards. Specifically, 73. 1 % and 69. 8 % of the subjects suffered from poor sleep quality and low back pain, respectively. After web-based learning, the experimental group had higher post-test scores than the control group in terms of knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP). However, there was only a significant difference (p < 0. 05) in their knowledge about the prevention of <b>occupational</b> <b>hazards.</b> It is suggested that an online discussion may enhance nursing staff’s participation in web-based learning, and further facilitate their comments on negative factors. The findings can highly promote nursing staff’s attitudes and practices toward preventing <b>occupational</b> <b>hazards</b> through web-based learning...|$|R
500|$|After {{his return}} to London in 1946, {{at the end of}} the Second World War, a number of major {{publications}} ensued, including Lilies of the World in 1950. The RHS also imposed two major tasks on their librarian. In 1950, Frederick Chittenden, a previous director of RHS Wisley and Keeper of the Library, died leaving unfinished the four volume RHS Dictionary of Gardening that the Society had commissioned from him before the war. The war had interrupted the work as many of the expected contributors were unavailable. Stearn, together with Patrick Synge, the RHS Publications Editor, undertook to complete the work, particularly volume IV (R–Z), a task he completed within six months, with 50 new articles. The finished work was published in 1951 and not only did he undertake the role of editing this large work but his contributions covered 50 genera, 600 species and complex identification keys such as Solidago and Viola. Since Stearn's entries in volume IV extended from Soldanella to Zygotritonia, he would jest that he was but [...] "a peculiar authority on plants from 'So-' onwards". He issued a revised version in 1956 with Synge in which he added a further 86 articles. His recollection of this task was that he acquired [...] "that <b>occupational</b> <b>hazard</b> of compilers of encyclopaedias", encyclopaedic knowledge.|$|E

2500|$|The Office of Security used LSD in interrogations but Dr. Sidney Gottlieb, the chemist who {{directed}} MKUltra, had other ideas; {{he thought it}} could be used in covert operations. Since its effects were temporary, he believed it could be given to high-ranking officials and in this way affect the course of important meetings, speeches etc. Since he realized there was a difference in testing the drug in a laboratory and using it in clandestine operations, he initiated a series of experiments where LSD was given to people in [...] "normal" [...] settings without warning. At first, everyone in Technical Services tried it; a typical experiment involved two people in a room where they observed each other for hours and took notes. As the experimentation progressed, a point was reached where outsiders were drugged with no explanation whatsoever and surprise acid trips became something of an <b>occupational</b> <b>hazard</b> among CIA operatives. Adverse reactions often occurred, for example an operative who had received the drug in his morning coffee became psychotic and ran across Washington, seeing a monster in every car that passed him. [...] The experiments continued even after Dr. Frank Olson, an Army scientist who had not taken LSD before, went into deep depression after a surprise trip and later fell from a thirteenth story window.|$|E
