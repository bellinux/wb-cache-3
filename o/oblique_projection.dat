5|$|Three-dimensional space can be {{represented}} convincingly in art, as in technical drawing, by means other than perspective. Oblique projections, including cavalier perspective (used by French military artists to depict fortifications in the 18th century), were used continuously and ubiquitously by Chinese artists from {{the first or second}} centuries until the 18th century. The Chinese acquired the technique from India, which acquired it from Ancient Rome. <b>Oblique</b> <b>projection</b> is seen in Japanese art, such as in the Ukiyo-e paintings of Torii Kiyonaga (1752–1815).|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} the rolling HP meter began with pachinko balls that would drop balls off the screen upon being hit. This did not work as well for {{characters}} with high health. Instead, around 1990, they chose an odometer-style hit points counter. The bicycle {{was one of the}} harder elements to implement—it used controls similar to a tank before it was tweaked. Iwata felt that the Ape programmers were particularly willing to tackle such challenges. The programmers also found difficulty implementing the in-game delivery service, where the delivery person had to navigate around obstacles to reach the player. They thought it would be funny to have the delivery person run through obstacles in a hurry on his way off-screen. The unusual maps laid out with diagonal streets in <b>oblique</b> <b>projection</b> required extra attention from the artists. Itoi specifically chose against having an overworld map, and didn't want to artificially distinguish between towns and other areas. Instead, he worked to make each town unique. His own favorite town was Threed, though it was Summers before then.|$|E
500|$|EarthBound {{features}} {{many traditional}} role-playing game elements: the player controls {{a party of}} characters who travel through the game's two-dimensional world composed of villages, cities, caves, and dungeons. Along the way, the player fights battles against enemies and the party receives experience points for victories. If enough experience points are acquired, a character's level will increase. This pseudo-randomly increases the character's attributes, such as offense, defense, and the maximum hit points (HP) and psychic points (PP) of each character. Rather than using an overworld map screen like most console RPGs of its era, the world is entirely seamless, with no differentiation between towns and the outside world. Another non-traditional element is the perspective used for the world. The game uses <b>oblique</b> <b>projection,</b> while most 2D RPGs use a [...] "top down" [...] view on a grid or an isometric perspective.|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} we propose {{the use of}} {{alternating}} <b>oblique</b> <b>projections</b> (AOP) for {{the solution of the}} saddle points systems resulting from the discretization of domain decomposition problems. These systems are called coupled linear systems. The AOP method is a descent method in which the descent direction is defined by using alternating <b>oblique</b> <b>projections</b> onto the search subspaces. We prove that this method is a preconditioned simple gradient (Uzawa) method with a particular preconditioner. Finally, a preconditioned conjugate gradient based version of AOP is proposed...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the problem of deterministic blind channel estimation using <b>oblique</b> <b>projections.</b> <b>Oblique</b> <b>projections</b> allow to decompose a matrix into two non-orthogonal components.

The algorithms are robust to the spatial color of the additive noise and they are deterministic: {{if there is no}} additive noise, they allow perfect channel recovery with a finite number of samples if the model assumptions hold.

30|$|Then, {{we use a}} new {{formulation}} of the CML based on <b>oblique</b> <b>projections</b> to investigate the first moment. <b>Oblique</b> <b>projections</b> are well known for their applications in signal processing, especially in channel estimation [13 – 16]. With this formulation, it is proved that the channel estimator is unbiased. This result is of importance, in particular, for deriving the Cramer-Rao bound of this channel estimation problem. Moreover, the channel estimate is {{proved to be an}} algebraic function whose inputs are the initial value and the means and variances of the received samples.|$|R

40|$|A {{definition}} of <b>oblique</b> <b>projections</b> onto closed convex sets that use seminorms induced by diagonal matrices {{which may have}} zeros on the diagonal is introduced. Existence and uniqueness of such projections are secured via directional affinity of the sets {{with respect to the}} diagonal matrices involved. A block-iterative algorithmic scheme for solving the convex feasibility problem, employing seminorm-induced <b>oblique</b> <b>projections,</b> is constructed and its convergence for the consistent case is established.

For any A-∈A{ 1 }, we deduce general formulas of g-inverse A^-∈A^{ 1 }, such that the distances between the two g-inverses or <b>oblique</b> <b>projections</b> are the smallest under appropriated norms, and obtain the corresponding distances.

40|$|Simultaneous subgradient {{projection}} algorithms for the convex fea-sibility problem use subgradient {{calculations and}} converge sometimes {{even in the}} inconsistent case. We devise an algorithm that uses seminorm-induced <b>oblique</b> <b>projections</b> onto super half-spaces of the convex sets, which is advantageous when the subgradient-Jacobian is a sparse matrix at many iteration points of the algorithm. Using gen-eralized seminorm-induced <b>oblique</b> <b>projections</b> on hyperplanes defined by subgradients at each iterative step, allows component-wise diago-nal weighting which {{has been shown to}} be useful for early acceleration in the sparse linear case. Convergence for the consistent case with underrelaxation is established. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We propose {{and study}} a block-iterative {{projections}} method for solving linear equations and/or inequalities. The method allows diagonal component-wise relaxation {{in conjunction with}} orthogonal projections onto the individual hyperplanes of the system, and is thus called diagonallyrelaxed orthogonal projections (DROP). Diagonal relaxation has proven useful in accelerating the initial convergence of simultaneous and block-iterative projection algorithms but until now it was available only in conjunction with generalized <b>oblique</b> <b>projections</b> {{in which there is}} a special relation between the weighting and the <b>oblique</b> <b>projections.</b> DROP has been used by practitioners and in this paper a contribution to its convergence theory is provided.
