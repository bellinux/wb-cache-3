5|$|Banff, {{established}} in 1885, {{is the main}} commercial centre in Banff National Park, {{as well as a}} centre for cultural activities. Banff is home to several cultural institutions, including the Banff Centre, the Whyte Museum, the Buffalo Nations Luxton Museum, Cave and Basin National Historic Site, and several art galleries. Throughout its history, Banff has hosted many annual events, including Banff Indian Days which began in 1889, and the Banff Winter Carnival. Since 1976, The Banff Centre has organized the Banff Mountain Film Festival. In 1990, Banff incorporated as a town of Alberta, though still subject to the National Parks Act and federal authority in regards to planning and development. In its 2014 census, the town of Banff had a permanent population of 8,421 as well as 965 non-permanent residents for a total population of 9,386. The Bow River flows through the town of Banff, with the Bow Falls located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outskirts</b> <b>of</b> <b>town.</b>|$|E
5|$|In late 1869, Earp courted 20-year-old Urilla Sutherland (c. 1849–1870), the {{daughter}} of William and Permelia Sutherland, who operated the Exchange Hotel in Lamar. They were married by his father Nicholas in Lamar on January 10, 1870, and in August 1870, Wyatt bought a lot <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outskirts</b> <b>of</b> <b>town</b> for $50, where he built a house. Urilla was pregnant and about to deliver their first child when she suddenly died from typhoid fever. In November, Earp sold the lot and a house on it for $75. Hoping to keep the office {{to which he had}} been appointed, he ran against his elder half-brother Newton for the office of constable. The Earps may have hoped to keep the job in the family one way or another. Wyatt won by 137 votes to Newton's 108, but their father Nicholas lost the election for justice of the peace in a very close four-way race.|$|E
5|$|Burnham was {{trekking}} the 1,000 miles (1,609km) {{north from}} Durban to Matabeleland {{with his wife}} and son, an American buckboard and six donkeys when war broke out between Rhodes's British South Africa Company and the Matabele (or Ndebele) King Lobengula in late 1893. He signed up to scout for the Company immediately on reaching Matabeleland, and joined the fighting. Leander Starr Jameson, the Company's Chief Magistrate in Mashonaland, hoped to defeat the Matabele quickly by capturing Lobengula at his royal town of Bulawayo, and so sent Burnham and a small group of scouts ahead to report on the situation there. While <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outskirts</b> <b>of</b> <b>town</b> they watched as the Matabele burned down and destroyed everything in sight. By the time the Company troops had arrived in force, Lobengula and his warriors had fled and there was little left of old Bulawayo. The Company then moved into the remains of Bulawayo, established a base, and sent out patrols to find Lobengula. The most famous of these patrols was the Shangani Patrol, led by Major Allan Wilson and the man he chose as his Chief of Scouts, Fred Burnham.|$|E

25|$|Many {{streets in}} Chico, most notably Nord Avenue/Walnut Street, change street names after small bridges.

25|$|Richmond's Northside {{is home to}} {{numerous}} listed historic districts.

Other prominent Northside neighborhoods include Azalea, Barton Heights, Bellevue, Chamberlayne, Ginter Park, Highland Park, and Rosedale.|$|E
25|$|All {{residents}} of Brugg were thereafter subjects of Bern. Nonetheless, this changed little <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outskirts</b> <b>of</b> <b>town,</b> as Bern's border {{had been pushed}} to the north by only a few kilometers, and conflict continued to impair the town's economy. During the eighty years subsequent to the “Brugg Night of Murder” the population of Brugg was halved and surrounding communities were able to expand their trading areas and markets {{at the expense of}} Brugg.|$|E

It is the only building in the town built of red brick three courses thick, most likely for insulation to keep the air temperature steady during the cold winters and hot summers. The cemetery includes a Miners Union section, and a cenotaph erected to honor President James A. Garfield. The Bodie Boot Hill was located outside of the official city cemetery.|$|E

25|$|In 1905 Nurse Despard, who {{had trained}} in Melbourne, opened a {{maternity}} hospital in Newcastle in Leeder's House in Stirling Terrace. The Sisters of Mercy had vacated {{the house when}} they moved into the newly built convent <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outskirts</b> <b>of</b> <b>town.</b> A maternity hospital was unusual for those times; the practice was for home births assisted by a midwife. The passing of the Health Act in 1911 required midwives to be registered. By 1913, Durlacher {{was one of a}} number of women to appear on the first Register of Midwives in Western Australia.|$|E

25|$|On 9 August 1811, Godinot's {{division}} encountered O'Donnell at Zújar. The French general's division included four battalions of the 8th Line, {{and three}} battalions {{each of the}} 16th Light and 54th Line Infantry Regiments. This force may have numbered as many as 8,000 men. Hoping to be reinforced by La Cuadra, O'Donnell placed his troops behind the Guardal River <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outskirts</b> <b>of</b> <b>town.</b> In the afternoon, Godinot fell on the Spanish troops and routed them.

25|$|Notable {{architectural}} {{features include}} the Eisenmarkt and the steep gradients and tightly packed street layout of a medieval town. The sandstone cathedral of St. Mary was commenced in the 12th {{century as a}} Romanesque building. In the later Middle Ages the construction was continued under a master plan in Gothic style. The church was never finished, as one steeple still remains uncompleted. The cathedral suffered heavy damage in the Second World War from aerial bombing, but was restored in the 1950s. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>outskirts</b> <b>of</b> <b>town</b> the ruins of several stone towers are to be found, situated along the river.|$|E
