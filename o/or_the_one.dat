5|$|In Greek Mythology, Canis Major {{represented}} the dog Laelaps, {{a gift from}} Zeus to Europa; or sometimes the hound of Procris, Diana's nymph; <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> given by Aurora to Cephalus, so famed for its speed that Zeus elevated it to the sky. It was also considered to represent one of Orion's hunting dogs, pursuing Lepus the Hare or helping Orion fight Taurus the Bull; and is referred to in this way by Aratos, Homer and Hesiod. The ancient Greeks refer only to one dog, but by Roman times, Canis Minor appears as Orion's second dog. Alternative names include Canis Sequens and Canis Alter. Canis Syrius was the name used in the 1521 Alfonsine tables.|$|E

5|$|According {{to those}} historians, the Spanish {{revolution}} against absolutism got {{mixed up with}} the Peninsular War. When FerdinandVII stood against his father CharlesIV, who {{was seen as an}} absolutist king, many Spaniards got the mistaken impression that he sympathized with the new enlightened ideas. Thus, the revolutions made in the Americas in the name of FerdinandVII (such as the May Revolution, the Chuquisaca Revolution, <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> in Chile) would have sought to replace absolutist power with power formulated under the new ideas. Even if Spain was at war with France, the ideals of the French Revolution (liberty, equality and fraternity) were still respected. Those revolutions pronounced themselves enemies of Napoleon, but did not face any active French military attack; they promoted instead fights between Spanish armies for keeping either the old or new order. This situation would change with the final defeat of Napoleon and the return of FerdinandVII to the throne, as he began the Absolutist Restoration and persecuted the supporters of the new libertarian ideas within Spain. For people in South America, to stay {{as a part of the}} Spanish Empire, but with a new relationship with the mother country, was no longer a feasible option: the only remaining options at this point were to return to absolutism or to adopt independentism.|$|E

The inauguration of the first Nizam took place behind closed doors in a private ceremony attended by the new ruler's closest advisors. Nizam ul-Mulk never formally declared his independence and insisted that his rule was entirely based on the trust reposed in him by the Mughal Emperor.|$|E

25|$|Although the McGovern {{campaign}} {{believed that}} its candidate {{had a better}} chance of defeating Nixon because of the new Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution that lowered the national voting age to 18 from 21, the plan backfired when most of the youth vote went to Nixon. This was the first election in American history in which a Republican candidate carried every single Southern state, continuing the region’s transformation from a Democratic bastion into a Republican one as Arkansas was carried by a Republican presidential candidate {{for the first time in}} a century. By this time, all the Southern states, except Arkansas and Texas, had been carried by a Republican in either the previous election <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> in 1964 (although Republican candidates carried Texas in 1928, 1952 and 1956).

25|$|Iraqi-Israeli author Shimon Ballas' novel Outcast, {{published}} in English in 2007, features an Elisha-like character. Outcast is narrated by Haroun Soussan, a Jewish convert to Islam. For Iraq, he left Judaism, embraced Islam, and fought Zionism as the nonpareil, ethnocentrist {{threat to his}} dreams. He has lost his closest friends because of politics, particularly Assad Nissim, a principled Iraqi Jew forced to depart for Israel. Despite everything Soussan believes and has done, however, what he was is not forgotten, and he feels an outcast not merely from the Jews and the West but within his homeland. Based on a historical figure, Ahmad (Nissim) Soussa's work ended up being used as anti-Jewish propaganda during the era of Saddam Hussein. Commenting {{on the use of}} Soussan's writing on Judaism by propagandists, his friend Assad Nissim likens him to Elisha Ben Abuya, <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> they called Aher, the Outcast. In Hebrew, {{the title of the book}} is V'Hu Aher, which means And He is an Other or And He is a Different One.|$|E

500|$|Whereas many {{events in}} the war were more bloody for the Israelis, like the {{massacre}} at Kfar Etzion with 150 deaths <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> of the Mount Scopus with 78, the Battle of Latrun is the event of the war to provoke most rumours, narratives and controversies in Israel. The main reason is that Latrun had still been the mainstay for the road to Jerusalem until the Six-Day War, keeping the Israelis at the margins and having to go round and maintain the town, but struggling to bypass it, which played each day on their minds. According to Anita Shapira, the primary reason was nothing but people's grievous memories, of David Ben-Gurion and the veterans of the British Armies {{on one side and}} former Palmah and Haganah soldiers on the other. In this sphere of influence during the 1970s and in the controversies that continued until the 1980s, the [...] "Strategic Necessity" [...] was said, if it were not done, it would be [...] "Criminal negligence", with a heavy toll on bring in immigrants to the battle, and forging a new founding myth.|$|E
