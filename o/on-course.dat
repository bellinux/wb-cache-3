25|$|Greyhound racing enjoyed {{its highest}} UK attendances {{just after the}} Second World War — for example, there were 34 million paying spectators in 1946. The {{industry}} experienced a decline from the early 1960s after the 1960 UK Betting and Gaming Act permitted off-course cash betting. Sponsorship, limited television coverage, and the later abolition of <b>on-course</b> betting tax have partially offset this decline.|$|E
25|$|The {{industry}} of greyhound racing was particularly attractive to predominantly male working-class audiences, {{for whom the}} urban locations of the tracks and the evening times of the meetings were accessible, and to patrons and owners from various social backgrounds. Betting {{has always been a}} key ingredient of greyhound racing, both through <b>on-course</b> bookmakers and the totalisator, first introduced in 1930. Like horse racing, it is popular to bet on the greyhound races as a form of parimutuel gambling.|$|E
25|$|Golf {{instruction}} {{involves the}} teaching and learning of the game of golf. Proficiency in teaching golf instruction requires not only technical and physical ability but also knowledge of the rules and etiquette of the game. In some countries, golf instruction is best performed by teachers certified by the Professional Golfers Association. Some top instructors who work with professional golfers have become quite well known in their own right. Professional golf instructors can use physical conditioning, mental visualization, classroom sessions, club fitting, driving range instruction, <b>on-course</b> play under real conditions, and review of videotaped swings in slow motion to teach golf to prepare the golfer for the course.|$|E
500|$|Within {{attachment}} theory, attachment means [...] "a biological instinct {{in which}} proximity to an attachment figure is sought {{when the child}} senses or perceives threat or discomfort. Attachment behaviour anticipates a response by the attachment figure which will remove threat or discomfort". Such bonds may be reciprocal between two adults, but between a child and a caregiver these bonds {{are based on the}} child's need for safety, security and protection, paramount in infancy and childhood. John Bowlby begins by noting that organisms at different levels of the phylogenetic scale regulate instinctive behavior in distinct ways, ranging from primitive reflex-like [...] "fixed action patterns" [...] to complex plan hierarchies with subgoals and strong learning components. In the most complex organisms, instinctive behaviors may be [...] "goal-corrected" [...] with continual <b>on-course</b> adjustments (such as a bird of prey adjusting its flight to the movements of the prey). The concept of cybernetically controlled behavioral systems organized as plan hierarchies (Miller, Galanter, and Pribram, 1960) thus came to replace Freud's concept of drive and instinct. Such systems regulate behaviors in ways that need not be rigidly innate, but—depending on the organism—can adapt in greater or lesser degrees to changes in environmental circumstances, provided that these do not deviate too much from the organism's environment of evolutionary adaptedness. Such flexible organisms pay a price, however, because adaptable behavioral systems can more easily be subverted from their optimal path of development. For humans, Bowlby speculates, the environment of evolutionary adaptedness probably resembles that of present-day hunter-gatherer societies for the purpose of survival, and, ultimately, genetic replication. Attachment theory is not an exhaustive description of human relationships, nor is it synonymous with love and affection, although these may indicate that bonds exist.|$|E

The marathon came under scrutiny in 2015 when Mike Rossi achieved viral fame after allegedly cheating in the marathon {{to qualify for the}} Boston Marathon. In response, Via Marathon organizers added timing mats and video surveillance <b>on-course.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Modern {{greyhound}} racing has {{its origins in}} coursing. The first recorded attempt at racing greyhounds on a straight track was made beside the Welsh Harp reservoir, Hendon, England, in 1876, but this experiment did not develop. The industry emerged in its recognizable modern form, featuring circular or oval tracks, with {{the invention of the}} mechanical or artificial hare, in 1912, by an American, Owen Patrick Smith. O.P. Smith had altruistic aims for the industry to stop the killing of the jack rabbits and see [...] "{{greyhound racing}} as we see horse racing". In 1919, Smith opened the first professional dog-racing track with stands in Emeryville, California. The certificates system led the way to parimutuel betting, as quarry and <b>on-course</b> gambling, in the United States during the 1930s.|$|E
2500|$|After {{winning the}} U.S. Amateur in 1959 and 1961, and {{challenging}} for the 1960 U.S. Open [...] (he finished in second place, two shots behind Arnold Palmer), Nicklaus turned professional at age 21 {{toward the end}} of 1961. His first professional win came in a major championship, the 1962 U.S. Open, when he defeated Palmer by three shots in a next day 18-hole [...] playoff. This win over Palmer began the <b>on-course</b> rivalry between the two golf superstars. In 1966, Nicklaus won the Masters Tournament {{for the second year in}} a row, becoming the first golfer to achieve this distinction, and also won The Open Championship, completing his career slam of major championships. At age 26, he became the youngest to do so at the time. In 1968 and 1969, Nicklaus did not win a major tournament. He then won another Open Championship in 1970.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to the 1949 accident, Hogan {{never truly}} {{captured}} {{the hearts of}} his galleries, despite {{being one of the}} best golfers of his time. Perhaps this was due to his perceived cold and aloof <b>on-course</b> persona. But when Hogan shocked and amazed the golf world by returning to tournament golf only 11 months after his accident, and took second place in the 1950 Los Angeles Open after a playoff loss to Sam Snead, he was cheered on by ecstatic fans. [...] "His legs simply were not strong enough to carry his heart any longer", famed sportswriter Grantland Rice said of Hogan's near-miss. However, he proved to his critics (and to himself, especially) that he could still win by completing his famous comeback five months later, defeating Lloyd Mangrum and George Fazio in an 18-hole playoff at Merion Golf Club to win his second U.S. Open Championship.|$|E
