Results: the group that received 2 % <b>grape</b> <b>juice</b> concentrate before induction with AOM showed the decreased expression of Bcl- 2 compared to those animals that were induced by AOM (positive control). Regarding Bax, animals that received <b>grape</b> <b>juice</b> at 2 % decreased Bax immunoexpression when compared to AOM group. Furthermore, animals that intake <b>grape</b> <b>juice</b> at 1 % after induced by AOM decreased Bax immunoexpression as well. 8 -OHdGLI did not show significant statistically differences (p> 0. 05) among groups.

RESULTS: BRS-Cora <b>grape</b> <b>juice</b> showed higher concentrations of total polyphenols and anthocyanins, as well as higher antioxidant potential, than those of Isabella <b>grape</b> <b>juice.</b> A significant positive correlation was found in TPC or anthocyanin contents when correlated with the remaining antioxidant assays.

40|$|ABSTRACT <b>Grape</b> <b>juice</b> {{contains}} high {{amounts of}} anthocyanins, with {{great potential for}} substituting synthetic food dyes. Carrier agents used in spray drying entraps anthocyanins, allowing their preservation. This work appraised whey protein/ maltodextrin (WM) and soy protein/maltodextrin (SM) blends as alternative carriers for spray drying of <b>grape</b> <b>juice</b> and encapsulation of anthocyanins. The effects of carrier agent concentration (CAC) and ratio protein/carrier agent (R) on <b>grape</b> <b>juice</b> powder properties were evaluated. The <b>grape</b> <b>juice</b> powders presented good solubility, low water content and high anthocyanin retention. WM blends resulted in higher yields and higher anthocyanin retention (from 77. 9 to 94 %) than SM blends, whereas SM blends leaded to higher encapsulation efficiency (> 97 %). Increasing CAC and R resulted in brighter powders, but reconstituted juices presented color parameters {{similar to those of}} fresh juice. WM and SM were suitable for encapsulating anthocyanins of <b>grape</b> <b>juice,</b> resulting in powders with potential applications in food industry. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS The grape cultivar BRS violeta contains high levels of anthocyanins and is an alternative to produce antioxidant-rich and highly colored <b>grape</b> <b>juice.</b> Spray drying is applied for producing powdered <b>grape</b> <b>juice</b> with high anthocyanin content. In this technique, the addition of whey and soy proteins blended with maltodextrin as carrier agents avoid problems such as stickiness, which is negative to process yield and product quality. Moreover, the use of carrier agents in spray drying promotes the microencapsulation of bioactive compounds, allowing their protection and preservation during processing and storage.

Objectives: The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the staining effect of various drinks and temperatures on the surface sealant (Fortify Plus™) sealed on a nano-filled resin composite (Supreme XTE™) after artificial aging at different temperatures. Materials and Methods: Surface sealant was applied on one surface of forty resin composite discs (10 × 2 mm). Five discs each were immersed in test solutions of black cola, commercial dark <b>grape</b> <b>juice,</b> coffee and distilled water (negative control). Discs were either placed at 4 °C (20 discs) or 37 °C (20 discs) and the colour difference (ΔE) was calculated based on the colour coordinates at 0 (baseline), 7, 14 and 28 days of staining treatment. Two-factor with replication analysis was carried out with ANOVA. Results: The results showed significant discolouration after 28 days immersion in coffee (P< 0. 001) and <b>grape</b> <b>juice</b> group (P< 0. 001).
