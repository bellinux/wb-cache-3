[...] The well-developed trigeminal nerve allows them to detect vibrations in the water (such as those made by potential prey). The tongue cannot move freely but is held in place by a folded membrane. While the brain of a crocodilian is fairly small, it is capable of greater learning than most reptiles. Though they lack the vocal folds of mammals and the syrinx of birds, crocodilians can produce vocalisations by vibrating three flaps in the larynx.|$|E

50|$|An <b>olfactometer</b> is any {{device that}} is used to measure the sense of smell. The most basic type in early studies was placing a subject in a room {{containing}} a specific measured amount of an odorous substance.

Field <b>olfactometers</b> have been praised for their low cost ($ 500 - $ 1200) and portability but criticized for their lack of control of inhalation rates by different panelists, the discomfort of glass inhalation tubes and the odor fatigue caused by poor nasal sealing or removing the scentometer between samples as compared to laboratory dynamic, triangular forced-choice <b>olfactometers</b> ($ 30, 000). This study evaluated the variability of responses using these three field <b>olfactometers</b> compared to laboratory olfactometry, as well as field and lab odor intensity.

The objective of the present study was to improve our knowledge of olfactory stimuli used by females of B. cucurbitae to locate cucurbit host plants. We firstly compared different laboratory devices (a wind tunnel, <b>olfactometers</b> with one or four arms and small test cages) for assessing fly responses to different host plants. In the wind tunnel, females showed no orientated response in the presence of host odours. By contrast, positive response in small test cages and <b>olfactometers</b> was recorded. This allowed us to measure the relative attractiveness of the odours of different wild and cultivated cucurbitaceae for B. cucurbitae females. In parallel, the volatile composition of the odours of fruit and flowers of these different cucurbits was characterised using headspace-solid phase microextraction (SPME) /gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (CG-MS).

The suitabilities of odour management technologies to Manitoba are evaluated in terms of cost and climatic conditions. Over 168 odour compounds have been identified in livestock odours.

The electronic nose prototype was equipped with a set of six semiconductor sensors by FIGARO Co. and one PID-type sensor. The field <b>olfactometers</b> were utilized for determination of mean concentration of odorants and for calibration of the electronic nose prototypes in order to provide their proper operation.

40|$|Measurement of odour {{emissions}} from swine operations {{is a difficult}} task. <b>Olfactometers</b> are currently the most accepted method for odour measurement. However, obtaining downwind odour samples that are representative to what is actually âfelt â by those {{in the field is}} almost impractical. The goal {{of this study was to}} evaluate a potentially more satisfactory method of evaluating odour directly in the field. This method was developed by St. Croix Sensory Inc. (Stillwater, MN) to use trained human odour assessors (Nasal Rangers) to quantify odour intensity according to n-butanol reference scales. The specific objective of this study was to establish a relationship between odour intensity assessed by the Nasal Ranger technique and odour concentration measured with <b>olfactometers.</b> Four swine production sites were selected for this study, two located in Southern Manitoba and two in Central Alberta. A total of 154 samples were collected in 10 L Tedlar bags from the four sites between June and October, 2001.

40|$|For most <b>olfactometers</b> {{described}} in the literature, adjusting olfactory stimulation intensity involves modifying the dilution of the odorant in a neutral solution (water, mineral, oil, etc.), the dilution of the odorant air in neutral airflow, or {{the surface of the}} odorant in contact with airflow. But, for most of these above-mentioned devices, manual intervention is necessary for adjusting concentration. We present in this article a method of controlling odorant concentration via a computer which can be implemented on even the most dynamic <b>olfactometers.</b> We used Pulse Width Modulation (PWM), a technique commonly used in electronic or electrical engineering, and we have applied it to odor delivery. PWM, when applied to odor delivery, comprises an alternative presentation of odorant air and clean air at a high frequency. The cycle period (odor presentation and rest) is 200 ms. In order to modify odorant concentration, the ratio between the odorant period and clean air presentation during a cycle is modified. This ratio is named duty cycle. Gas chromatography measurements show that this method offers a range of mixing factors from 33 % to 100 % (continuous presentation of odor). Proof of principle is provided via a psychophysical experiment. Three odors (isoamyl acetate, butanol and pyridine) were presented to twenty subjects. Each odor was delivered three times with five values of duty cycles. After each stimulation, the subjects were asked to estimate the intensity of the stimulus on a 10 point scale, ranging from 0 (undetectable) to 9 (very strong). Results show a main effect of the duty cycles on the intensity ratings for all tested odors...|$|R
5000|$|Scientists {{have devised}} methods for {{quantifying}} {{the intensity of}} odors, in particular {{for the purpose of}} analyzing unpleasant or objectionable odors released by an industrial source into a community.

The basic theory of odor analysis is to measure what extent of dilution with [...] "pure" [...] air is required before the sample in question is rendered indistinguishable from the [...] "pure" [...] or reference standard.

50|$|Research on the {{viability}} of as an effective biocontrol agent is ongoing in the US. Laboratory methods {{have been developed for}} continuous rearing of this and other species of EAB parasitoid wasps. Extensive studies on the specificity of these parasitoids on native beetles and other insects has been carried out. No-choice laboratory assays of larval wood-boring insects from China and North America showed some overlap in the physiological host range of S. agrili, although successful parasitism was significantly lower in non-hosts than in EAB. S. agrili also did not attack any borers in genera other than Agrilus. S. agrili was only attracted to select species of Fraxinus and to Salix babylonica. Since in nature, if parasitoids are not attracted to the host tree they will be unlikely to encounter and parasitize the non-target larvae, and considering the results from no-choice and <b>olfactometer</b> tests, the lack of S. agrili reared from other Agrilus spp, the wasp has been accepted for controlled releases in specific study sites for further research.|$|E
50|$|To {{establish}} the odor concentration, an <b>olfactometer</b> test is used, which employs {{a panel of}} human noses as sensors. In the olfactometry testing procedure, a diluted odorous mixture and an odor-free gas (as a reference) are presented separately from sniffing ports {{to a group of}} panelists, who are housed in an odor-neutral room. They are asked to compare the gases emitted from each sniffing port, after which the panelists are asked to report the presence of odor together with a confidence level such as guessing, inkling, or certainty of their assessment. The gas-diluting ratio is then decreased by a factor of two (i.e. chemical concentration is increased by a factor of two). The panelists are then asked to repeat their judgment. This continues for a number of dilution levels. The responses of the panelists over a range of dilution settings are used to calculate the concentration of the Odor in terms of European odor units (ouE/mÂ³). The main panel calibration gas used is butan-1-ol, which at a certain diluting gives 1 ouE/mÂ³.|$|E
40|$|Continuous {{determination}} of {{volatile organic compounds}} gained increased importance {{in the field of}} indoor air quality since short-term emission events need to be assessed. This paper shows two exemplary applications. First, the development of reference sources for the validation of emission test chamber measurements is often connected to non-steady-state measurements with rapid changes in the chamber air concentration. The testing of these new sources needs high-time resolved measurements that are advantageous compared to thermal desorption methods. Second, the sensory evaluation of products using emission test chambers gains importance due to changes in certification regulations.
