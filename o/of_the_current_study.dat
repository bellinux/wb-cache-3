50|$|Much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>study</b> {{regarding}} metacognition {{within the}} field of cognitive psychology deals with its application within the area of education. Being able to increase a student's metacognitive abilities has been shown to {{have a significant impact on}} their learning and study habits. One key aspect of this concept is the improvement of students' ability to set goals and self-regulate effectively to meet those goals. As a part of this process, it is also important to ensure that students are realistically evaluating their personal degree of knowledge and setting realistic goals (another metacognitive task).|$|E

5000|$|The {{researchers}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>study</b> {{took the}} results from the Majdandizic and Van der Boom study and expanded on their work by looking at variability in fear expressions in both socially inhibited children and non-socially inhibited children. What they found was that mainly socially inhibited children have effects such as shyness and inhibition with peers, adults, and in performance situations, as well as social phobia and separation anxiety. The stronger link with fear reactions comes mainly from those children who were non-socially behaviorally inhibited. While these results go against previous findings, what the researchers were eager to stipulate was that [...] "the normative development of fear in children have indicated that many specific fears (e.g., fear of animals) decline with age, whereas social fears increase as children get older".|$|E
5000|$|From 2004 to 2006, Stephen B. Plank {{and colleagues}} from Johns Hopkins University {{conducted}} a correlational {{study to determine}} {{the degree to which}} the physical appearance of the school and classroom setting influence student behavior, particularly in respect to the variables concerned in their study: fear, social disorder, and collective efficacy. They collected survey data administered to 6th-8th students by 33 public schools in a large mid-Atlantic city. From analyses of the survey data, the researchers determined that the variables in their study are statistically significant to the physical conditions of the school and classroom setting. The conclusion, published in the American Journal of Education, was ...the findings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>study</b> suggest that educators and researchers should be vigilant about factors that influence student perceptions of climate and safety. Fixing broken windows and attending to the physical appearance of a school cannot alone guarantee productive teaching and learning, but ignoring them likely greatly increases the chances of a troubling downward spiral.|$|E
50|$|The area postrema's {{position}} {{outside of}} the blood-brain barrier makes this particular region of the medulla {{a key player in}} the autonomic control of various physiological systems, including the cardiovascular system and the systems controlling feeding and metabolism.A recent study has indicated the existence of prolactin-binding sites specific to the area postrema. The result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>study</b> has implicated the area postrema as a prolactin target area at which vascular prolactin has the ability to openly associate with neuronal components. Prolactin is a peptide hormone known in lower animals to {{play a significant role in}} osmoregulation, originally functioning to influence electrolyte balance, and may now be believed to stimulate reproductive behaviors such as the water-drive before ovoposition in amphibians and lactation in mammals.Another recent study found that the administration of angiotensin II causes a dose-dependent increase in the arterial blood pressure without producing considerable changes in the heart rate. Evidence from this study reveals that the change in the arterial blood pressure depends on the integrity of the area postrema and that this site partially contributes to the action of angiotensin.|$|E
