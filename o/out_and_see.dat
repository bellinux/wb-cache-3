25|$|Knievel's daredevil show {{broke up}} after the Barstow {{performance}} because injuries prevented him from performing. After recovering, Knievel started traveling from small town to small town as a solo act. To get ahead of other motorcycle stunt people who were jumping animals or pools of water, Knievel started jumping cars. He began adding more and more cars to his jumps when {{he would return to}} the same venue to get people to come <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> him again. Knievel had not had a serious injury since the Barstow performance, but on June 19 in Missoula, Montana, he attempted to jump twelve cars and a cargo van. The distance he had for takeoff did not allow him to get up enough speed. His back wheel hit the top of the van while his front wheel hit the top of the landing ramp. Knievel ended up with a severely broken arm and several broken ribs. The crash and subsequent stay in the hospital were a publicity windfall.|$|E

Elizabeth later said in a rare interview, [...] "We asked my parents if we could go <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> for ourselves. I remember we were terrified of being recognised... I remember lines of unknown people linking arms and walking down Whitehall, all of us just swept along on a tide of happiness and relief." ...|$|E

And {{literally}} we came out the door and it was like just hundreds of people sort of coming around us. People everywhere, cameras, people yelling her name.

500|$|Film {{critic and}} radio host Michael Medved criticized New Line Cinema for agreeing to re-shoot scenes {{so that the}} film would receive an R rating from the Motion Picture Association of America to match fan expectations. He argued that the film would have grossed more revenue {{at the box office}} with a PG-13 rating, stating that the {{demographic}} most likely to be drawn to a movie titled Snakes on a Plane is males between the ages of 12 and 15. [...] "My fourteen-year-old son, Danny, for instance, felt a powerful inclination to go <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> the movie with his two sleep-over friends this Sunday night," [...] he explained, [...] "but I wouldn't permit it. It's rated R for good reason." [...] Medved ultimately awarded the film 2 1/2 stars out of 4 in a radio review, but said that he did so [...] "grudgingly." ...|$|E
500|$|Henderson {{would not}} accept {{the end of his}} major league career. In May 2005, he was still insisting that he was capable of playing in the major leagues. NBC and ESPN {{reported}} that Henderson had announced his much-delayed official retirement on December 6, 2005, but his agent denied the report the following day. On February 10, 2006, he accepted a position as a hitting instructor for the Mets, while leaving the door open to returning as a player. In July 2006, Henderson discussed an offer he'd received to rejoin the SurfDawgs for the 2006 season, which would have been his 31st in professional baseball, but suggested he'd had enough. But six weeks later, on August 11, he claimed [...] "It's sort of weird not to be playing, but I decided to take a year off", adding, [...] "I can't say I will retire. My heart is still in it... I still love the game right now, so I'm going to wait it <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> what happens." ...|$|E

500|$|Stengel tried incessantly {{to promote}} the Mets, talking to reporters or anyone else who would listen. He often used the word [...] "amazin'" [...] (as he put it) and soon this became the [...] "Amazin' Mets", a {{nickname}} that stuck. Stengel urged the fans, [...] "Come <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> my amazin' Mets. I been in this game a hundred years but I see new ways to lose I never knew existed before." [...] Stengel was successful in selling the team to some extent, as the Mets drew 900,000 fans, half again as many as the Giants had prior to their departure, though the games against the Giants and Dodgers accounted for half of the total. The team was less successful on the field, finishing {{with a record of}} 40–120, the most losses of any 20th century major league team. They finished 60 games behind the pennant-winning Giants, and 18 games behind ninth-place Chicago.|$|E
500|$|Stefani {{initially}} did {{not intend}} to tour to support the album, responding [...] "What tour?" [...] to a question from MTV News in December 2004 regarding a possible tour. She later mentioned several times that she had not originally intended to tour in support of the album, referring to her [...] "illegal tour" [...] and apologizing for her breaking her promise not to tour on stage at the Xcel Energy Center in Saint Paul, Minnesota on November 14 and admitting [...] "I just wanted to make a record. I didn't want to tour, I was too tired, then you guys kept buying the record, and I had to come <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> you guys" [...] on stage at Winnipeg on November 16. In a September interview with MTV News, Stefani said of the tour: [...] "I'm looking forward to it, it's going to be unbelievable. [...] I would love to try to roll a little bit of 'Orange County Girl' in there. We'll see. Anything can happen in rehearsals. I don't even know how long the show can be right now." ...|$|E
500|$|One {{continuing}} subplot {{with the}} tour's scheduling was E Street drummer Max Weinberg's availability vis à vis {{his job as}} The Max Weinberg 7 bandleader for Conan O'Brien, given that {{during the first half}} of 2009 Late Night with Conan O'Brien in New York was ending and The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien in Los Angeles was beginning. [...] The mid-January announcement that Late Night would continue until February 20 precluded any notion of starting the tour immediately following Springsteen's appearance at Super Bowl XLIII, in addition to the band feeling that they had just gotten off the Magic Tour and [...] "Wait, let’s stop a minute." [...] Meanwhile, the June 1 start date of The Tonight Show posed problems for Weinberg's continued presence on the tour. [...] O'Brien told a Variety reporter at the time of the announcement that he hoped that Weinberg would follow him to Los Angeles and that he also hoped an arrangement could be worked out to let Weinberg go on the road with Springsteen as had been done for past tours. [...] At NBC, the coexistence between the drummer's two bosses was known as the Weinberg-Springsteen Rule, and was not typically extended to other talent at the network. [...] In a high-profile Rolling Stone cover story interview, Springsteen was vague about the matter: [...] "All I know is this – it's all gonna work out, one way or another. If people wanna come <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> the E Street Band, they'll be able to come <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> the E Street Band." [...] And whether Weinberg would stay with O'Brien and move or not was a subject of conflicting news reports until O'Brien confirmed on February 18 that Weinberg and the band were indeed coming with him. [...] A few days later, E Streeter Steven Van Zandt said of Weinberg's availability for the post-June 1, European leg: “We’re still figuring that out. We’ll see. I think Max will be there for most of it. ... I know he was very much trying to figure it out.” [...] Weinberg had not missed an E Street Band show since joining the outfit in 1974, and Van Zandt said that no amount of rehearsal by another drummer could replace Weinberg's intuitive understanding of Springsteen's performance gambits.|$|E

500|$|Matt Bozon {{has refused}} to blame Capcom, the {{publisher}} of the game, for responsibility in the game's failure. This was despite Capcom holding it for 8 months after completion, with the game finally releasing when the Game Boy Advance was already in its first year of existence. He says he went in [...] "very naive", believing that if the game was good, it would sell anyway. Bozon believed that from a creative standpoint, he never really settled on a target audience, with the character being [...] "iconoclastic", [...] "too sexy to be a kid's brand, and too girly for a male gamer brand". Also, before the game was even released, Bozon claims that he had come to understand anyway that the game [...] "would probably not sell", as during WayForward's search for a publisher, many market analysts were skeptical at {{the idea of having a}} female lead character, and Bozon ultimately acknowledged that they probably [...] "genuinely knew their markets". He still didn't give up, as he felt that Shantae had to exist, [...] "even if it was just to reach <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> if there was an audience reaching back." ...|$|E

I don't think I'd be doing anything solo, but I might look to join other bands, just {{to have a chance to}} keep playing. I'm just not keen to be off touring the world anymore". Powderfinger played their final show at the River Stage in Brisbane on 13 November 2010 in front of 10,000 fans; the last song they performed was [...] "These Days". On 25 January 2011 the band issued a previously unreleased track, [...] "I'm on Your Side", as a fundraiser for the Premier's Flood Appeal as a result of major flooding in Queensland from December the previous year into January. The song was available via the band's website with all proceeds going towards the cause. On 8 November 2011, the group released a second compilation album, , containing two new tracks. There was also a 2-disc release, Fingerprints & Footprints – The Ultimate Collection, combining both Fingerprints and Footprints in one set. Also in November, Dino Scatena and the band, published a biography, Footprints: the inside story of Australia's best loved band. Scatena, a rock music journalist, had started writing the book in the previous October during the Sunsets Farewell Tour.|$|E

Wells' body was instead discarded behind a disused Huntington Beach gas station, where it was found five hours later.|$|E

2500|$|Since their rise to fame in 1971, Slade {{had failed}} to achieve a major {{breakthrough}} in the United States. During the period of 1972–73, the band began touring there as a step towards trying to crack the market, complete with attendant record company hype touting them the next Beatles. However, the band later revealed they felt that such hype did the band no favours. Although Slade had built up a reputation for their live performances, Slade were still far from the successes of the Beatles, which they well acknowledged. In 1975, lead vocalist Noddy Holder told Geoff Barton: [...] "So much hype, and the American public don't like that at all.

He was greatly {{intrigued}} by the way Leskov managed to secure himself total independence in the community where no such thing seemed possible ("he was neither Narodnik nor Slavophile, neither Westernizer, nor liberal or conservative") and, at the same time, developed [...] "deep insight {{into the life of}} the existing classes and social groups of Russia... something none of his greater contemporaries like Tolstoy or Turgenev, could ever do". [...] "...It was Leskov who dissected Rus thoroughly," [...] Gorky said (through his character Klim Samgin), later explaining: [...] "Leskov was... the only Russian author to have succeeded in separating the whole generation of his countrymen into a new set of sub-classes, each belonging to a different epoch." [...] Gorky mentioned Leskov among authors that had helped him form his own style and outlook. [...] "It was partly under Leskov's influence that I decided to go <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> how real people lived," [...] he wrote. [...] "Leskov influenced me enormously, with his knowledge of the Russian language and its richness," [...] Gorky remarked in another letter.|$|E
