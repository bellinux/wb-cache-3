Within this definition it then makes sense that the core focus of human-security endeavours should be on the most vulnerable. It makes sense that risk management should be most responsive to immediate events or processes that have both an extensive and intensive impact in producing material and existential vulnerabilities of people in general or a category of persons across a particular locale.|$|E

Through the creation of human-chimera comes the question: where does society now draw the line of humanity? This question poses serious legal and moral issues, along with creating controversy. Chimpanzees, for example, are not offered any legal standing, and are put down if they pose a threat to humans. If a chimpanzee is genetically altered to be more similar to a human, it may blur the ethical line between animal and man.

25|$|In The Origins of Totalitarianism Hannah Arendt devotes {{a lengthy}} chapter to a {{critical}} analysis of human rights. Arendt isn’t skeptical {{of the notion of}} political rights in general, but instead defends a national or civil conception of rights. Human rights, or the Rights of Man as they were commonly called, are universal, inalienable and possessed simply in virtue <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>human.</b> In contrast, civil rights are possessed in virtue of belonging to a political community, most commonly by being a citizen. Arendt’s primary criticism of human rights is that they are ineffectual and illusory because their enforcement is in tension with national sovereignty. She argued that since there is no political authority above that of sovereign nations, state governments have little incentive to respect human rights when such policies conflict with national interests. This can be seen most clearly by examining the treatment of refugees and other stateless people. Since the refugee has no state to secure their civil rights, the only rights they have to fall back on are human rights. In this way Arendt uses the refugee as a test case for examining human rights in isolation from civil rights.|$|E

The title is {{a play on}} the words [...] "obscene" [...] and [...] "Zen"; in addition, [...] "ob" [...] means [...] "anti" [...] in Latin. Therefore, the title suggests that the human species has found harmony and balance in warfare and bloodshed. Revolver Magazine finds the lyrics of the title track from obZen representative of the entire album: [...] "Salvation found in vomit and blood/Where depravation, lies, corruption/War and pain is god." [...] However, Haake claims, [...] "We don't dwell on hate and bad feelings as people. But with these songs, I think {{we really wanted to}} paint a picture lyrically that might be seen as a cautionary tale. We're going, 'Heads up. Here's what some of the parts <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>human</b> are about, {{and this is what we}} can be at our worst.'

500|$|Roger Travis, {{associate}} professor of classics at the University of Connecticut, compared the Master Chief to the epic hero Aeneas, in that both superhuman characters save a civilization by defeating strong enemies in a martial setting. The audience is intended {{to identify with the}} protagonist similarly in both stories. Matthew Stover compared Halo to the Iliad, saying that both stories share the meta-theme that [...] "war is the crucible of character". As military science fiction, Halo further raises the issue <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>human.</b> Stover argued that, since players are to imagine themselves as the Master Chief, the character is correctly presented as a cyborg, neither a flawless machine nor fully human. Players would be unable to empathize with the former, and the latter would be too specifically developed. This immersion has facilitated the use of the Halo series' multiplayer mode for live digital puppetry, as in Chris Burke's machinima talk show This Spartan Life.|$|E
500|$|A large seabird, the albatross, {{played a}} central part in Samuel Taylor Coleridge's {{influential}} 1798 poem The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, which in turn {{gave rise to the}} usage of albatross as metaphor for a burden. In his 1902 poem The Sea and the Hills, Rudyard Kipling expresses the urge for the sea, and uses alliteration to suggest the sea's sound and rhythms: [...] "Who hath desired the Sea?—the sight of salt water unbounded— The heave and the halt and the hurl and the crash of the comber wind-hounded?" [...] John Masefield also felt the pull of the sea in his Sea Fever, writing [...] "I must go down to the seas again, to the lonely sea and the sky."

500|$|The press {{coverage}} surrounding the evacuation was later cited {{as an example}} of [...] "disaster pornography", in academic analyses concerned with the portrayal of child victims of violence and disaster in ways that reaffirm those victims' remoteness from and subjectivity to western (here, Northwestern European) agency. In a similar vein, Dominic Strinati has presented the press interest in Operation Irma as evidence of a popular appetite for news stories that resemble the structure and tone of fictional narratives on war: [...] "War films work most effectively... by stripping back the too easily confusing contextual details of a conflict and focusing instead on the 'existential' problem of the protagonist's experience – the problem <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>human</b> in dehumanising circumstances... News reporting – in this case from the Balkans – then has to compete even at the level of basic comprehension with this already established way of understanding things... It may not be surprising, therefore, {{that one of the most}} memorable news 'stories' to come out of Bosnia was that of Irma, a rescued child." [...] The operation has also been portrayed as representative of a trend whereby public reaction to media coverage of disasters leads and shapes official state response, even precipitating the creation of policy where none has existed before. Erica Burman, developing this theme, has argued that Irma Hadžimuratović became an [...] "emotional focus" [...] for a British public dismayed by its government's ambiguous and cautious attitude to the conflict in Bosnia: ...|$|E

Whithouse was asked to set it [...] "anywhere in the world" [...] that was romantic, and he chose Venice, which he called [...] "one of my favourite places in the world". Whithouse believed that the vampires fit into the setting. Whithouse had a positive experience writing the episode, reflecting that [...] "writing on the show is a delight and a pleasure".

40|$|Aristotle's virtue {{ethics is}} a teleological ethics, namely, for him, {{the purpose of}} {{achieving}} moral virtues by <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> is to obtain eudaimonia. The best interpretation of eudaimonia in Aristotle is human flourishing that is the main axis of Aristotle's ethics and also contemporary virtue ethics. Aristotle's analysis of human flourishing that is performed in biological context {{is based on the}} concept of ergon or function. Therefore, Aristotle, in description of human flourishing, emphasizes on the exclusive function <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>being.</b> For Aristotle the proper function <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>being</b> is not only nutrition, development, and reproduction because these are common between <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> on the one hand, and animals and planets, on the other hand.
