40|$|Faced in the {{developed}} world by increasing restrictions on cigarette advertising and sales, and with declining markets, the tobacco transnationals are opening up new markets in developing countries, where they face few controls and little health education. As cigarette sales increase in the Third World, so does the evidence of an increasing incidence of smoking-related diseases. This paper considers the case study of BAT (Kenya) Ltd, a subsidiary of the London-based transnational, which since 1974 has encouraged both local leaf production and increased cigarette sales in Kenya. We examine: (1) the relationship between <b>BAT</b> (<b>K)</b> and the Kenya state, the recruitment of farmers into the leaf growing scheme, how <b>BAT</b> (<b>K)</b> 's directorships interlock with those of other leading Kenyan firms and the implications of these for the company's power and influence; (2) <b>BAT</b> (<b>K)</b> 's marketing strategies, how successful they have been, and how they compare with codes of conduct agreed in developed countries; and (3) we estimate the likely success of possible strategies to combat the smoking hazard in Kenya. We conclude that although <b>BAT</b> (<b>K)</b> might make minor concessions to the 'health lobby' in Kenya, it is sufficiently powerful, and the leaf growing programme is given sufficient Government support, as to make fundamental changes unlikely in the near future. ...|$|R

40|$|Bats {{are unique}} among mammals, {{possessing}} {{some of the}} rarest mammalian adaptations, including true self-powered flight, laryngeal echolocation, exceptional longevity, unique immunity, contracted genomes, and vocal learning. They provide key ecosystem services, pollinating tropical plants, dispersing seeds, and controlling insect pest populations, thus driving healthy ecosystems. They {{account for more than}} 20 % of all living mammalian diversity, and their crown-group evolutionary history dates back to the Eocene. Despite their great numbers and diversity, many species are threatened and endangered. Here we announce <b>Bat</b> 1 <b>K,</b> an initiative to sequence the genomes of all living bat species (n∼ 1, 300) to chromosome-level assembly. The <b>Bat</b> 1 <b>K</b> genome consortium unites bat biologists (> 132 members as of writing), computational scientists, conservation organizations, genome technologists, and any interested individuals committed {{to a better understanding of}} the genetic and evolutionary mechanisms that underlie the unique adaptations of bats. Our aim is to catalog the unique genetic diversity present in all living bats to better understand the molecular basis of their unique adaptations; uncover their evolutionary history; link genotype with phenotype; and ultimately better understand, promote, and conserve bats. Here we review the unique adaptations of bats and highlight how chromosome-level genome assemblies can uncover the molecular basis of these traits.

Five inocula were used, two from reference strains and three from pasteurized concentrated orange juice. Cell recovery after the enrichment in reconstituted orange juice was also analyzed. An initial population of 6 log CFU/mL was inoculated. ALI, BAT and YSG media were able to recover the initial population of all different inocula, with no significant differences between the results. When compared to BAT, however, the preparation of ALI and YSG media was simpler and had more advantages. The recovery with K agar medium was lower than the other media for all the tested inocula, with significant differences found for Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius 0298 T (3. 66 log CFU/mL) and Alicyclobacillus pomorum-like CBMAI 0278 (4. 11 log CFU/mL) ...|$|R

50|$|Jean Yarbrough {{was born}} in Marianna, Arkansas on August 22, 1901. He {{attended}} the University of the South located in Sewanee, Tennessee. In 1922, Yarbrough entered the film business working in silent pictures, first as a prop-man and later rising through the ranks to become an assistant director. By 1936, he was a bona fide director, first doing comedy and musical shorts for RKO which was founded by Joseph P. Kennedy among others. His directorial debut for a feature-length film was Rebellious Daughters which {{was made by the}} low-budget studio, Progressive Pictures in 1938. His greatest success came in the 1940s, when he directed movies that are still fondly remembered to this day, such as The Devil <b>Bat,</b> <b>King</b> of the Zombies, She-Wolf of London, and a number of Abbott and Costello comedies. Yarbrough directed two of The Bowery Boys movies which were the longest running series in American movie history. Angels in Disguise and Master Minds were both directed by Jean Yarbrough in 1949. Yarbrough found little difficulty in transitioning from the traditional B-movies which were on the decline, to the new medium of television. He directed many episodes for different TV series throughout the 1950s and 1960s which are widely considered to be the Golden Age of Television. In addition to directing, he had a two-year stint working as both producer and director of the very popular Abbott and Costello Show. He directed some episodes of The Silent Service and Navy Log, also during the 1950s, which were military dramas based on true stories of the United States Navy.|$|R
40|$|The kinetic {{parameters}} (V m, K m, and slope) of membrane-bound microsomal non-specific phosphatase NPase, with G 6 P as the substrate) {{from the}} digestive gland of unexposed and cadmium adapted (45 days for 100 µg Cd 2 + /l) mussels were investigated. In vivo and in vitro approaches were used. Adaptation of mussels (Crenomytilus grayanus) to cadmium {{resulted in a}} 1. 6 -fold increase in NPase activity. V m was increased by 1. 6 -fold, <b>bat</b> <b>K</b> m was the same in terms of enzyme kinetics. This indicates that the total concentration of the enzymes in the digestive gland increased. Cd 2 + (1 mM) did not significantly alter {{the activity of the}} membrane-bound enzyme in vitro both for unexposed and For cadmium adapted mussels, meaning that cadmium ions are not a direct inhibitor of the membrane-bound enzyme in this concentration. The microsomal NPase activity in both unexposed and cadmium adapted mussels was inhibited by in vitro solubilization of microsomes with non-ionic detergent (Triton X 100, 0. 01 %). This inhibition was uncompetitive for microsomes of unexposed mussels (K m decreased 3. 1 -fold). The most drastic events were observed in cadmium adapted mussels, where inhibition was mixed (K m decreased 7. 2 -fold). The simultaneous actions of detergent and cadmium ions did not alter NPase activity significantly in comparison with action of the detergent alone. The differences in the types and the extents of inhibition of the enzymes activity by membrane disordering agent (Triton X 100) indicated that the enzyme membrane complex (NPase) has been altered as a result of adaptation of mussels to cadmium accumulation. We conclude that the mussels produced a new Enzyme-membrane complex, with the same K m as the previous complex, but with other detergent sensitivity and greater amounts. Thus, the adaptation capacity of this enzyme is reduced as result of adaptation of mussels to cadmium accumulation...|$|R
50|$|After a short {{stint in}} Scranton to start 1991, Morandini {{returned}} to the major leagues {{for the remainder of}} his career. He amassed four triples and thirteen stolen bases in his first full season, highlighting his speed. The following season produced {{one of the most memorable}} moments of Morandini's career. In a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates on September 20, 1992, he turned an unassisted triple play. In the sixth inning, Morandini caught a line drive off of the <b>bat</b> of Jeff <b>King,</b> touched second base to put out Andy Van Slyke, and tagged out Barry Bonds coming from first base; the Pirates went on to win the game, 3-2, in extra innings. It was the first unassisted triple play since 1968, and the first in the National League since 1927. Morandini was also the first second baseman in National League history, and the first in the regular season, to turn an unassisted triple play; all previous occurrences were made by first basemen or shortstops. The only other second baseman to achieve the feat prior was Bill Wambsganss, who turned a triple play in the 1920 World Series.|$|R

His next appearance came a week later against the Pittsburgh Pirates at Forbes Field. He entered the game, a one-sided Chicago victory, in the fifth inning in relief of starting shortstop Leon Brinkopf. The following inning, Hardin collected his only Major League hit, a single off the Pirates' Jim Suchecki. Again he played errorless ball, handling two chances.

40|$|Many night-flying insects evolved {{ultrasound}} sensitive ears {{in response}} to acoustic predation by echolocating <b>bats</b> [1], 2 <b>K.</b> D. Roeder, Nerve Cells and Behavior, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA (1967). [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9] and [10]. Noctuid moths are most sensitive to frequencies at 20 – 40 kHz [6], the lower range of bat ultrasound [5], [11], [12] and [13]. This may disadvantage the moth because noctuid-hunting bats in particular echolocate at higher frequencies shortly before prey capture [7], [11], [12] and [13] and thus improve their echolocation and reduce their acoustic conspicuousness [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [12], [13], [14], [15] and [16]. Yet, moth hearing is not simple; the ear's nonlinear dynamic response shifts its mechanical sensitivity up to high frequencies. Dependent on incident sound intensity, the moth's ear mechanically tunes up and anticipates the high frequencies used by hunting bats. Surprisingly, this tuning is hysteretic, keeping the ear tuned up for the bat's possible return. A mathematical model is constructed for predicting a linear relationship between the ear's mechanical stiffness and sound intensity. This nonlinear mechanical response is a parametric amplitude dependence [17] and [18] that may constitute a feature common to other sensory systems. Adding another twist to the coevolutionary arms race between moths and bats, these results reveal unexpected sophistication {{in one of the}} simplest ears known and a novel perspective for interpreting bat echolocation calls...|$|R
