5|$|Initially, Littell {{thought that}} his book would sell around {{three to five}} {{thousand}} copies. Éditions Gallimard, his publishing house, was more <b>optimistic</b> <b>and</b> decided to print 12,000 copies. Word of mouth and the enthusiastic reviews soon catapulted sales {{to such an extent}} that Gallimard had to stop publishing the latest Harry Potter novel in order to meet the demand for The Kindly Ones, which ended up selling more than 700,000 copies in France by the end of 2007. Littell was finally given French citizenship.|$|E
5|$|Morrison's third solo album, Moondance, {{which was}} {{released}} in 1970, became his first million selling album and reached number twenty-nine on the Billboard charts. The style of Moondance stood in contrast to that of Astral Weeks. Whereas Astral Weeks had a sorrowful and vulnerable tone, Moondance restored a more <b>optimistic</b> <b>and</b> cheerful message to his music, which abandoned the previous record's abstract folk compositions {{in favor of more}} formally composed songs and a lively rhythm and blues style he expanded on throughout his career.|$|E
5|$|Scherger became Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee (COSC), {{the senior}} Australian {{military}} {{position at the}} time, in May 1961, taking over from Vice Admiral Sir Roy Dowling. Keen as ever to see a supersonic bomber replace the Canberra, he visited Britain in April 1963 to investigate progress of the TSR-2. Using back-channel sources of information, he satisfied himself that the RAF's pronouncements on the bomber's development were overly <b>optimistic,</b> <b>and</b> later that year began supporting selection of the F-111 as the aircraft best suited to supplant the Canberra.|$|E

5|$|The {{change to}} an AC system was a {{significant}} improvement. The Vulcan's powered flying controls were hydraulically actuated but each powered flying control unit (PFCU) had a hydraulic pump which was driven by an electric motor. Because there was no manual reversion, a total electrical failure {{would result in a}} loss of control. The standby batteries on the B.1 were designed to give enough power for 20 minutes of flying time but this proved to be <b>optimistic</b> <b>and</b> two aircraft, XA891 and XA908, crashed as a result.|$|E
5|$|The median is {{the halfway}} point, {{which means that}} 50% of people will die before eight months, but the other half will live longer, {{potentially}} much longer. He then needed to determine where his personal characteristics placed him within this range. Given that the cancer was detected early, he was young, <b>optimistic,</b> <b>and</b> had the best treatments available, Gould reasoned {{that he should be}} in the favorable half of the upper statistical range. After an experimental treatment of radiation, chemotherapy, and surgery, Gould made a full recovery, and his column became a source of comfort for many cancer patients.|$|E
5|$|Despite German {{claims that}} the {{blockage}} did not impede their operations, the operation to close the Ostend canal {{seemed to have been}} at least partially successful. The channel was largely blocked and so Bruges was ostensibly closed off from the open sea, even if the position of the blockship meant that smaller ships could get through. In fact, the entire operation had been rendered moot before it even began, due to events at the wider canal in Zeebrugge. British assessments of that operation had proven <b>optimistic</b> <b>and</b> the channel there had not been properly closed. Small coastal submarines of the UC class had been able to pass through the channel as early as the morning after the Zeebrugge Raid and German naval engineers were able to dredge channels around the blockages at both ports over the coming weeks.|$|E

5|$|The Americans {{planned to}} have the K-25 plant in full {{production}} by June or July 1945. Having taken two years to get the prototype stages working, the British experts regarded this as incredibly <b>optimistic,</b> <b>and</b> felt that, barring a miracle, it {{would be unlikely to}} reach that point before the end of 1946. This opinion offended their American counterparts and dampened the enthusiasm for cooperation, and the British mission returned to the United Kingdom in January 1944. Armed with the British Mission's report, Chadwick and Oliphant were able to persuade Groves to reduce K-25's enrichment target; the output of K-25 would be enriched to weapons grade by being fed into the electromagnetic plant. Despite the British Mission's pessimistic forecasts, K-25 was producing enriched uranium in June 1945.|$|E
5|$|Many of the game's non-player {{characters}} (NPCs) are companion characters, {{who appear}} throughout {{the game and}} may volunteer their services. Companions include Alistair, a reluctantly heroic Grey Warden with a sarcastic wit; Morrigan, a sultry but cynical dark mage who has little regard for authority or social mores; Leliana, an ex-member of Ferelden's Chantry whose <b>optimistic</b> <b>and</b> virtuous demeanor belies an aptitude for espionage and combat; Sten, a proud but stoic warrior of the militaristic Qunari people who often questions human ways; Oghren, a brutal dwarven warrior whose love of alcohol is only matched by his penchant for violence and loyalty to his friends; Wynne, an Elder Mage of the Circle, a maternal figure to the party and a powerful healer; Zevran, a rakish elven assassin who is fond of treasures, sex and innuendo; and a loyal Mabari War Hound, which the player can name and use for scouting and combat. In the DLC, Shale, a sarcastic Golem with a mild ornithophobia who was a female dwarf in her prior life, is also available.|$|E
5|$|The {{order for}} the {{pre-production}} I-250s had been placed with Factory No. 381 in Moscow for two aircraft to be delivered in September, three more in October and the remainder {{by the end of}} the year. This proved to be very <b>optimistic</b> <b>and</b> it was revised to a single aircraft {{by the end of the}} year. The airframe was completed on this revised schedule, but its engine was not ready in time. The factory management was much criticized for these problems which were not entirely under their control as changes to the design and drawings were constant. The criticism was not limited to just the I-250 program as the other jet programs could not be developed as fast as the leadership wanted as well and Alexei Shakhurin, the head of MAP (Ministry of Aviation Industry) and its NKAP predecessor since 1940, was arrested in March 1946 as a sign of their displeasure. The new Minister severely reprimanded the designer of the VRDK and three factory directors on 13 April 1946 and set up a commission to determine why Factory No. 381 and TsIAM had failed to meet their deadlines. He refused to accept its findings as it apportioned blame fairly evenly among those responsible for the production program and he had the director of Factory No. 381 and his quality control manager arrested for industrial sabotage.|$|E

5|$|Tolls on the Witham had {{gradually}} risen as improvements {{had been}} made. £263 {{was raised in}} 1763-4, and had reached £898 by 1790. In 1819, income exceeded £4,100 for the six months from March to September, and a five per cent dividend was paid in the following year. By 1826, over £!80,000 had been spent on improvements, and another £40,000 was needed. However, the proprietors were still <b>optimistic,</b> <b>and</b> commissioned Sir John Rennie to investigate an extension to link the Witham to the River Ancholme, but although he made two proposals, neither was implemented. Most traffic was carried by sailing vessels of in barges hauled by horses, but in March 1816, the first steam packet boat arrived on the river. It was named Witham and had been built by Shuttleworth and Robinson, whose yard was on Sincil Dyke. Despite a boiler explosion in March 1817, fortunately without causing injury {{to any of the}} crew or the 30 passengers, a second steam packet was operating by July 1817, and they soon displaced the sailing packet boats. During a flood in 1828, one of them lost power when a floating hedge became jammed in the paddle wheels. In the following year, a Lincoln man, William Pool invented a new type of paddlewheel, which resulted in the boats travelling faster, and in 1836, wooden vessels were superseded by iron packet boats.|$|E
5|$|With Yerkes as chairman, the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL) was {{established}} in 1902 with a capitalisation of £5million, the majority of shares sold to overseas investors. Further share issues followed, which, by 1903, raised a total of £18million (£ today) to be used across all of the UERL's projects. Yerkes died in December 1905, and Speyer took his place {{as chairman of the}} UERL. By 1907, the three new railways had opened and the electrification works had been completed. Despite the UERL's engineering success in carrying out the works in such a short time, the company was in a difficult financial position. The preliminary estimates of passenger numbers proved to be over <b>optimistic</b> <b>and</b> revenues were not covering operating costs. After bailing out the company, Speyer, with Managing Director Albert Stanley, struggled {{for a number of years}} to restore its finances. This was finally achieved with the purchase of the London General Omnibus Company in 1912, as its profits could be used to offset losses elsewhere in the group. In November 1912, Speyer further consolidated the UERL's control of London's underground railways when he negotiated the purchase of London's two other main tube railways, the City and South London Railway and the Central London Railway.|$|E
