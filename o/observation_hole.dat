40|$|Oxidation of {{naturally}} occurring pyrite (FeS 2) in certain low-lying clayey soils generates sulphuric acid, hence the term acid sulphate soils. A horizontal alkaline barrier was installed by radial grouting, {{for the purpose}} of remediating leachate from acid sulphate soils and preventing further oxidation. The current research relates to a large-scale field trial of this technique and the effect on the groundwater composition. In coastal Australia, a pyritic layer commonly exists in the soil at shallow depth that is at risk of oxidation, hence the main objective was to inject the barrier above the pyritic layer to (a) stop infiltration of oxygen to the pyritic layer and (b) neutralise any acidity stored in the soil. Two fine-grained alkaline materials, lime and fly ash, were assessed in this study. Lime was selected for its neutralising capacity, while the fly ash was selected to accompany the lime to enhance the pozzolanic reactions. The optimum mix ratio of lime, fly ash and water to form an ideal slurry and the optimum depth and pressure of injection were experimentally determined. For the large-scale field trial, the slurry was injected into a systematic grid of 22 holes to form the reactive barrier. The groundwater composition was monitored in a network of <b>observation</b> <b>holes</b> across the study site to determine the effectiveness of the barrier. The average groundwater pH was 3. 25 prior to installation of the barrier, and it rose to 4. 6 after the barrier was installed. The influence of the barrier on the groundwater pH was greater in <b>observation</b> <b>holes</b> close to the barrier than those further away. The concentrations of aluminium and iron decreased in the groundwater after the installation of the alkaline barrier. The ratio of Cl/SO 4 in the groundwater increased after the barrier was installed which confirmed that the barrier had successfully controlled the subsequent pyrite oxidation in the soil...|$|R

Visual access to the model bird was provided through two <b>observation</b> <b>holes,</b> which allowed measurement of exactly how often and for how long observers watched the other. Overall, ravens were more attentive to conspecifics than were jackdaws.

40|$|A {{new record}} of {{absolute}} palaeointensity {{was obtained from}} drill core Scientific <b>Observation</b> <b>Hole</b> 1 (SOH 1) on Kilauea volcano, Hawaii. Kilauea's high eruption rate resulted in a relatively continuous record and stratigraphic constraints preserved the chronological older. Three hundred and sixty samples were studied with the Thellier-Thellier technique, which gave 195 successful palaeointensity and 271 successful inclination determinations. Three geomagnetic excursions were observed, which exhibited intensity reductions of about 50 %. Initial age control from K-Ar and Ar/Ar dating only constrained the total age between 20 and 120 ka. The final age model was obtained by stretching the SOH 1 record relative to other Hawaiian palaeomagnetic data. This gave an age range of 0 - 45 ka for the flows and identified the excursions as the Hilina Pali, Mono Lake and Laschamp events. The SOH 1 record of the Hilina Pali event is the most detailed ever, incorporating data from around 40 flows.

40|$|This paper {{reports a}} new simple test {{technique}} to evaluate current interruption ability of arc quenching gases. In the test, current and voltage {{applied to the}} arc was controlled using a {{insulated gate bipolar transistor}} (IGBT). Switching the IGBT enables us to produce free recovery conditions for a fundamental arc decay in nozzles. In addition to this, a voltage was intentionally applied to the free recovery arcs between the electrodes by switching-off IGBT again at the specified delay time td. This applied voltage is called quasi transient recovery voltage (quasi-TRV). We can evaluate successful interruption or interruption failure by measuring the current between the electrodes after quasi-TRV application. We compared the interruption ability of SF 6 and CO 2 through this developed technique. The experimental results show that a residual arc in SF 6 gas flow decays four times more rapidly than that in CO 2 gas flow.
