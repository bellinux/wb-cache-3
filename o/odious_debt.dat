40|$|Odious debts” {{have been}} the subject of debate in academic, activist, and policy circles in recent years. The term refers to the debts of a nation that a despotic leader incurs against the {{interests}} of the populace. When the despot is overthrown, the new government—understandably—does not wish to repay creditors who helped prop up the despot. One argument has focused on whether customary international law supports a “doctrine” of <b>odious</b> <b>debts</b> that justifies non-payment of sovereign debts when three conditions are met: (1) the debts were incurred by a despotic ruler (without the consent of the populace); (2) the funds were used in ways that did not benefit the populace; and (3) the creditors were aware of the likely illegality of the loans. Advocates of this doctrine, which was synthesized by Alexander Sack in 1927, typically cite two examples of U. S. state practice for support: the negotiations between the United States and Spain following the Spanish-American War, in which the United States repudiated Cuba’s colonial debt, and the Tinoco Arbitration, which repudiated certain debts of the deposed Costa Rican dictator, Frederico Tinoco. Those historical precedents do not support the first condition of Sack’s doctrine of <b>odious</b> <b>debts,</b> but do support the second two requirements. In addition to these two instances, United States history is rich with examples of debt repudiation by states. Those examples suggest a doctrine of <b>odious</b> <b>debts</b> that is broader and more flexible than the one written by Sack. Indeed, it may be appropriate to speak of the doctrines (not just doctrine) of <b>odious</b> <b>debts...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{few years}} since the U. S. {{incursion}} into Iraq in 2003 have witnessed {{an explosion in the}} literature on <b>odious</b> <b>debts</b> - that is, debts incurred (a) without the consent of the people (e. g., by a despotic regime); (b) from which no benefits accrued to the people; and (c) when the creditors had knowledge of the foregoing. The key question in the literature is whether successors to the despotic regime are obligated to pay the debts of the despot. That is, whether the newly democratic nation of Iraq is obligated to pay the debts of Saddam Hussein. The starting point for almost every discussion - scholarly or popular - of this doctrine is an obscure legal scholar named Alexander Nahum Sack, variously described as the pre-eminent scholar on public debts of his time, a former minister to Tsar Nicholas II, and a Russian professor of law who penned the doctrine of <b>odious</b> <b>debts</b> while teaching in Paris. This Article excavates the background of Alexander Sack, separating the reality of his life from the myth perpetuated in the <b>odious</b> <b>debts</b> literature. Instead of the heroic and eminent Tsarist exile, the evidence reveals a peripatetic legal scholar who taught in five different universities on two continents, and after being fired from a tenured position, ended his life penniless. We are left then with these questions: What does the reality of Sack mean for the legal status of the <b>odious</b> <b>debts</b> doctrine? And how is it that he achieved this iconic status when even minimal inquiry would have revealed a far more murky reality...|$|R
5000|$|When a despotic regime {{contracts}} a debt, not for {{the needs}} or {{in the interests of}} the state, but rather to strengthen itself, to suppress a popular insurrection, etc, this <b>debt</b> is <b>odious</b> for the people of the entire state. This debt does not bind the nation; it is a debt of the regime, a personal debt contracted by the ruler, and consequently it falls with the demise of the regime. The reason why these <b>odious</b> <b>debts</b> cannot attach to the territory of the state is that they do not fulfil one of the conditions determining the lawfulness of State debts, namely that State debts must be incurred, and the proceeds used, for the needs and {{in the interests of the}} State. <b>Odious</b> <b>debts,</b> contracted and utilised for purposes which, to the lenders' knowledge, are contrary to the needs and the interests of the nation, are not binding on the nation [...] - [...] when it succeeds in overthrowing the government that contracted them [...] - [...] unless the debt is within the limits of real advantages that these debts might have afforded.

Alexander Sack synthetised the concept of <b>odious</b> <b>debt</b> based on precedents from the 19th century, such as the Mexican government rejection to pay debts acquired by the emperor Maximilian I, and the rejection by the USA, once annexed Cuba, to pay the debts acquired when it was a Spanish colony.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. After {{a period}} when the {{discourse}} on capital flight was largely coined for a rhetoric aimed to feed into the Marxist argument that capitalism could not {{lead to the development}} of the Third World, the debate on capital flight has increasingly become part of mainstream economics since the 1990 s.

40|$|Odious {{sovereign}} contracts inhibit {{developing country}} growth. They cause money {{and resources to}} be improperly transferred {{from one country to}} an undeserving one. Think tanks and civil society actors have long suggested that Indonesia is plagued by a sizeable odious sovereign contract account. Policy makers and scholars continue to grapple with how the <b>odious</b> <b>debts</b> doctrine may operate in law to curb this important problem. Taking into account the lack of transparency in an odious contract setting, this paper proposes a new approach premised on principles of transparency, accountability and citizen participation in public contracts. In design, it proposes the following: 1) the creation of ex-ante obligations and a public website on which financiers can disclose the key terms of their contractual arrangements with a sovereign government. This website enables a financier to signal the nature of their engagement with a sovereign counterpart; 2) the creation of an ex-post tribunal, in which private citizens have standing, to adjudicate the odiousness of a disputed sovereign contract. In the tribunal 2 ̆ 7 s deliberations, disclosure by a financier and compliance with ex-ante obligations weighs in favour of a presumption of legitimate contracting, whereas non-disclosure lends itself to a presumption of odiousness. This new approach has the right incentives for participation. It will revolutionize the currency of International law and International institutions, by giving the public a mechanism to eke out odiousness in transnational sovereign dealings. It can have important implications for Indonesia and more generally, the future of transnational trade and finance...|$|R
40|$|Developing country debt now exceeds 2. 4 {{trillion}} dollars {{and has become}} a major international political and economic issue for debtor governments, creditor governments, the IMF and World Bank, and campaigning organizations such as Jubilee 2000. For the poorest countries, debt has become unpayable and debt service an obstacle to development. This paper argues that debt crises and substantial debt cancellation are part of the normal economic cycle, and that an unusual aspect of this cycle has been the unwillingness to cancel debt. Recent historic precedent suggest that at least 1 {{trillion dollars}} in debt would need to be cancelled. The paper then uses a rights-based approach to development to estimate that more than 600 billion dollars in debt must be cancelled to release sufficient funds to meet internationally agreed development targets and thus satisfy human rights. Finally, the paper argues that lenders must take responsibility for illegitimate, corrupt and <b>odious</b> loans. <b>Debt</b> cancellation is the norm, not the exception, and the only question is how much...|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{popularity}} of the term among advocates of debt forgiveness, there is little agreement on a workable definition of"odious"debts and there are but few examples where the concept has been invoked in law to justify non-payment of sovereign debts. Most often, these have been cases when a successor state or government has refused to honor certain debts contracted by its predecessor state or government. Repudiating sovereign debts on broader grounds - such as that money may have been misused by the borrower or that results were not as hoped for at the outset of lending - would create real risks not only of reduced financial flows to poorer countries {{as a result of the}} danger of ex post challenges to lenders'claims, but also of moral hazard and lack of project ownership.

40|$|In 2008 the Ecuadorian {{government}} {{received a}} report on the legitimacy of the country's sovereign debt from an international audit commission appointed by Ecuador's current president, Rafael Correa. This concluded that much of the debt was tainted by illegality and illegitimacy and consequently did not merit repayment. Citing the report's findings as justification, the government stopped making interest payments on certain of the country's bonds, but, rather than repudiating them altogether, engineered a successful buyback at a large discount. Having thus reduced Ecuador's external commercial debt burden by about a third, the government is now planning to address multilateral and bilateral loans also adjudged unlawful by the commission. This article examines the robust approach adopted by the Correa administration to tackling Ecuador's public debts, placing {{it in the context of}} the country's troubled economic history and contrasting it with previous defaults and debt workouts which largely worked to Ecuador's disadvantage. In doing so, it considers the use which the government has made of the increasingly prominent concepts of <b>odious</b> and illegitimate <b>debt</b> as a means of combating the indebtedness of the South. The conclusion reached is that, regardless of the final position suggested by international law, the realities of international relations are likely to limit the practicality of legal remedies. Nevertheless, the case of Ecuador provides a new chapter in the continuing academic debate regarding unlawful debt. These, of course, are the legal aspects of Ecuador's endeavours to curtail expenditure desperately needed for other purposes. Underlying the legal implications is the reality of an impoverished nation called upon to continue to service or redeem 'debt' that brought no obvious benefit to the overwhelming majority of its people. Debt repayment has promoted impoverishment and also, if indirectly, facilitated devastating environmental degradation. ...|$|R

5000|$|There is {{much debate}} about whether the richer {{countries}} should be asked for money which has to be repaid. The Jubilee Debt Campaign gives six reasons why the third world debts should be cancelled. Firstly, several governments want {{to spend more money}} on poverty reduction but they lose that money in paying off their debts. Economist Jeff Rubin agrees with this stance on the basis that the money could have been used for basic human needs and says it is <b>Odious</b> <b>Debt.</b> Secondly, the lenders knew that they gave to dictators or oppressive regimes and thus, they are responsible for their actions, not the people living in the countries of those regimes. For example, South Africa has been paying off $22 billion which was lent to stimulate the apartheid regime.They have yet to recover from this, their external debt has increased to $136.6 billion while the amount of people in the housing backlog has increased to 2.1 million from 1994's 1.5 million. [...] Also, many lenders knew that a great proportion of the money would sometime be stolen through corruption. Next, the developing projects that some loans would support were often unwisely led and failed because of the lender's incompetence. Also, many of the debts were signed with unfair terms, several of the loan takers have to pay the debts in foreign currency such as dollars, which make them vulnerable to world market changes. The unfair terms can make a loan extremely expensive, many of the loan takers have already paid the sum they loaned several times, but the debt grows faster than they can repay it. Finally, many of the loans were contracted illegally, not following proper processes.|$|E
