5|$|In early June, insurgents began {{advancing}} {{into the}} central and northern parts of Iraq. On 10 June, Mosul fell to ISIL, a devastating defeat given that there were 30,000 Iraqi troops in the city facing approximately 1,500 ISIL fighters.

5|$|Following the {{disbanding}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Army,</b> insurgent activity increased, {{especially in}} Fallujah. Initially, armed resistance groups could {{be characterized as}} either Sunni nationalists who wanted {{to bring back the}} Ba'ath Party with Saddam Hussein, or anti-Saddam fighters. The first major leader of the insurgency in Anbar was Khamis Sirhan al-Muhammad, the Ba'ath party regional chairman for the Karbala Governorate, who was originally No. 54 on the US list of most-wanted Iraqis. According to the US military, Khamis received his funding and orders directly from Saddam, then still a fugitive.|$|E
5|$|In {{the long}} term, however, the British backed Iraq and {{rejected}} an international {{inquiry into the}} killings, fearing that this may provoke further massacres against Christians. They also did not insist on punishing the offenders, who were now seen as heroes by Iraqis. The official British stance was to defend the Iraqi government for its perseverance and patience {{in dealing with the}} crisis and to attribute the massacres to rogue army units. A report on the battle of Dirabun blames the Assyrians, defends the actions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Army,</b> and commends Sidqi as a good officer.|$|E

Following the Siege of Sadr City—a month of fighting—the Mahdi Army agreed to let Iraqi forces into the remaining portion of the city. On May 20, troops from the Iraqi Army 3rd Brigade of the 1st (Iraqi Reaction Force) Division and a brigade from the 9th Division moved into the northern districts of Sadr City and began clearing operations.|$|E
