30|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} at the Hersted Industripark catchment in Albertslund, Denmark, which covers 95  ha of industrial and residential areas. Surface runoff from the catchment is collected by a separate stormwater system {{and led to a}} stormwater retention pond (Basin K) with a 6400  m 2 surface area and an average dry weather depth of 0.8 – 1  m. The <b>outlet</b> <b>from</b> the pond <b>discharges</b> to the Harrestrup stream, for which the surrounding municipalities have a vision to improve the water quality and establish recreational riparian areas (Visionsplan 2007). This will require a substantial reduction of the pollution <b>discharge</b> <b>from</b> this and several other catchments, and the catchment thus exemplifies areas where stormwater pollution control strategies are under development and where the potential impacts of climate change have so far not been considered.|$|R
