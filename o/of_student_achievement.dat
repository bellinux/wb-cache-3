The response variable might be a measure <b>of</b> <b>student</b> <b>achievement</b> such as a test score, and different covariates would be collected at the classroom, school, and school district levels.|$|E

25|$|California public schools, which {{during the}} 1960s had been ranked nationally {{as among the}} best, have {{decreased}} to 48th in many surveys <b>of</b> <b>student</b> <b>achievement.</b> Some have disputed the attribution of the decline to Proposition 13's role in the change to state financing of public schools, because schools financed mostly by property taxes were declared unconstitutional (the variances in funding between lower and higher income areas being deemed to violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution) in Serrano vs. Priest, and Proposition 13 was then passed partially {{as a result of}} that case. California's spending per pupil was the same as the national average until about 1985, when it began decreasing, which resulted in another referendum, Proposition 98, that requires a certain percentage of the state's budget to be directed towards public education.|$|E

We provide a concise overview of the most important conceptual and methodological changes in the field <b>of</b> assessment <b>of</b> <b>student</b> academic <b>achievements</b> during the last decades of the 20 th century. The contemporary view of assessment implies inevitable changes in the assessment approaches and practices hitherto, shifting the focus to the very process and context of assessment, as well as to self-assessment as a part of learning process. Instead of the usual juxtaposition of the most important approaches to assessment <b>of</b> <b>student</b> <b>achievements,</b> we argue that each of them, under certain circumstances, can contribute to the formation of the image about the student and his/her potentials which would be as objective and comprehensive as possible...|$|R
