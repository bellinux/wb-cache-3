40|$|Abstract. In this report, the {{indentation}} {{method of}} measurement for residual stress in structural ceramics is discussed. The residual stresses in Al 2 O 3, Si 3 N 4 and ZrO 2 ceramics were evaluated with the indentation method. The value obtained <b>by</b> the <b>indentation</b> method was examined {{as a function of}} the microstructure, using Al 2 O 3 ceramics differing in microstructure (grain size and aspect ratio). The residual stress values in Al 2 O 3 and Si 3 N 4 obtained <b>by</b> the <b>indentation</b> method at 98 N agreed well with the values obtained by the X-ray method. The residual stress value in ZrO 2 obtained <b>by</b> the <b>indentation</b> method was close to the value obtained by the X-ray method, when the indentation load was 294 N. For estimating the residual stress in ZrO 2 with the indentation method, the influence of the phase transformation induced <b>by</b> the <b>indentation</b> is added to the original residual stress, when the indentation is small. The value obtained <b>by</b> <b>indentation</b> method differed with the aspect ratio of the grains in Al 2 O 3.

40|$|Abstract. Effects {{of surface}} defect {{size and the}} method used to obtain the defect itself on bending fatigue {{behaviour}} of nitrided and shot peened steel was studied. Two different series of 15 sandglass specimens with a microhole in the minimum section generated after nitriding and shot peening treatments were considered. In one series the microholes were obtained by controlled electro-erosion. In the other series microholes were obtained <b>by</b> <b>indentation,</b> much more invasive that electro-erosion, simulating a damage due to a mechanical impact or scratch on the surface material, common on real components during the life span. In both cases the microholes act as a pre-existent crack. The results show that defects obtained <b>by</b> <b>indentation</b> lead to a minor fatigue limit with respect of larger defects obtained by electro-erosion. This was interpreted as the modification of the residual stress field due to the mechanical indentation.

40|$|International audienceThe {{determination}} of the tensile properties <b>by</b> spherical <b>indentation</b> {{is based on the}} relation of Tabor, which links the mean pressure and the indent diameter, obtained from indentation tests, to the stress and strain determined from a tensile test, respectively. However, in order to improve the indentation-tensile relationship, an additional correction related to the piling-up or sinking-in formation around the indent {{must be taken into account}} for the calculation of the strain <b>by</b> <b>indentation.</b> The correction factor is expressed as a function of the strain-hardening exponent. As a consequence, to validate such methodology, majority of the authors use the strain-hardening exponent previously determined by a tensile test. Unfortunately, this approach obviously impedes a direct construction of the tensile curve from indentation tests since the strain-hardening exponent will be undetermined. In addition, the tensile stress to mean pressure ratio is not a constant value because it depends on the mechanical properties and on the deformation regime. To circumvent these two problems, a simple expression of the mean pressure to stress ratio is proposed in macroindentation as a function of the strain-hardening exponent, which is determined <b>by</b> <b>indentation</b> tests using the relations of Hollomon and Ramberg-Osgood. This methodology, which allows the construction of the stress -strain curve only from indentation tests, is validated on a low-carbon steel and a commercial brass...|$|R

40|$|Interfacial {{toughness}} of coatings {{is required}} for two reasons: a) to understand quantitatively degradation of adhesion in service; b) for life assessment of the coated components. Adhesion strength of thermal spray coating is usually measured {{in accordance with the}} tensile method specified by the "ISO 14916 ". Nevertheless, there is technical problem that ISO 14916 can't be applied to evaluate the coating with adhesion higher than strength of the glue which must be used to prepare the tensile test specimen. Especially, the interfacial toughness of coatings can't be evaluated by the ISO 14916. By the virtue of its simplicity and practicality, an indentation method is addressed as one of the promising methods to evaluate the interfacial toughness of coatings. In this method, an interfacial toughness value can be evaluated by measuring a length of the crack formed after pushing the indenter on the coating interface. However, a 3 dimensional geometry of the induced crack which affects the interfacial toughness has not been clear. In this study, an in-situ observation system to observe the cracking behavior <b>by</b> <b>indentation</b> was developed.
