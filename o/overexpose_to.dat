40|$|We study ethnic {{workplace}} {{segregation in}} Sweden using linked employer-employee data covering the entire working-age Swedish population during 1985 – 2002. Segregation is measured as overexposure {{to a particular}} group, {{taking into account the}} distribution of human capital, industry and geography. We find considerable workplace segregation between immigrants and natives but the results differ substantially between ethnic groups. Segregation has increased during the period, mainly due to changes in the ethnic composition. Immigrants are particularly <b>overexposed</b> <b>to</b> workers from their own birth region but also to other immigrants. Children to immigrants are only <b>overexposed</b> <b>to</b> immigrants from their parents region of birth. Segregation—particularly in the immigrant-native dimension—is in general negatively correlated with economic status. Workplace segregation; ethnic minorities; immigrant assimilation...|$|R

Immigrants are particularly <b>overexposed</b> <b>to</b> workers from their own birth region but also to other immigrants. The degree and nature of segregation varies substantially across ethnic groups, and the patterns are quite persistent over time. There is ethnic sorting also among well-established groups, but segregation is generally negatively correlated with economic status. Groups with low employment rates are more segregated from natives, individuals with many immigrant colleagues earn less, and segregation is countercyclical at the local level. These observations all support the idea that the labor market is ethnically segmented...|$|R

Karyotypic examination of the leukaemic blasts showed changes very similar to those associated with secondary leukaemia that may develop after radio or chemotherapy.

40|$|These {{practices}} carry risks {{when they}} destroy boundaries, create new inter-dependencies {{that must be}} managed and further open the organization to its environment. Buffers, like slack staff resourc-es and inventories, are greatly reduced, particularly in current economic conditions.

Organization systems and resources, such as IT, also must be capable of managing the complex, exter-nalized interdependencies that come with off-shoring, outsourcing and other supply-chain management strategies (Sheffi, 2005).

30|$|The put-call parity is {{free from}} {{distributional}} assumptions. It {{is tempting to}} assume that this parity also holds when an asset pricing model includes reflecting barriers. This paper shows {{that in the case}} of geometric Brownian motion with reflection such barriers cause the standard put-call parity to differ from the riskneutral parity. This paper then analyzes the error that arises when the diffusion is bounded and the standard put-call parity is applied in a risk-neutral framework as a shortcut to impute put prices from call prices, and vice versa. The risk-neutral parity that is derived for a reflected geometric Brownian motion is then used to analyze the impact that the Swiss National Bank’s minimum exchange rate regime vis-à-vis the euro has had on foreign exchange hedging costs. The analysis shows that in the analyzed period domestic investors may have incurred substantial costs as a result of hedging exposure to the euro currency and may have been <b>overexposed</b> <b>to</b> foreign exchange risk.|$|R

No evidence of radiation exposure, as indicated by dicentric or translocation aberrations in chromosomes from blood lymphocytes, was found in 22 persons.

40|$|This paper investigates whether global {{investors are}} over or under exposed to- wards the euro {{area and the}} role of home bias and {{institutions}} at home in shaping this exposure. According to a simple benchmark from standard portfolio theory, euro area investors - in particular those from euro area low-rating economies - are <b>overexposed</b> <b>to</b> euro area securities. Instead, investors outside the EU are underexposed to euro area securities in their total portfolio, proportionally to their degree of home bias, but not in their foreign portfolio. Nevertheless, once we account for gravity factors, the largest foreign investors overweigh euro area securities, especially debt of euro area high rating economies. Crucially, this overexposure was resilient to the euro area crisis. Moreover, we show that institutions at home are important to explain exposure to euro area securities. In particular, the higher the standards of governance at home, the greater the exposure to the euro area debt...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to measure the efficiency and the productivity change of Greek dairy firms, using non parametric approaches. This assessment is being achieved by the computation of the CRS and the VRS DEA models, the context dependent DEA approach and finally, the evolution of the Malmquist productivity index. These empirical analyses are based on data from 29 Greek dairy firms. This implementation provided helpful information regarding the efficiency ranking of the firms that operate in the Greek dairy industry. Findings that inefficient firms are over-invested and <b>overexposed</b> <b>to</b> high risk operation practices provide suggestions for future reparative actions in order to improve efficiency. This goal does not require radial effort from firms to achieve intermediate targets. Finally, stagnated mean efficiency change does not imply stagnated efficiency change for individual firms, but it is the outcome of a large variance of efficiency change scores being achieved by dairy firms from period to period...|$|R
