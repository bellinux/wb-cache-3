500|$|The {{anniversary of}} the game was not widely commemorated until its silver anniversary in 1987. By that time, the NBA had grown to be a popular sports league with average {{attendance}} of 13,000 fans per game and star players like Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, and Michael Jordan. The Warriors' PR director Harvey Pollack said an impossible 40,000 people claimed to have seen the game, and some even testified it took place in Madison Square Garden. Chamberlain later stated {{it was one of}} his favorite games, but not the favorite: that title belonged to the match in which he grabbed an NBA record 55 rebounds against perennial rival Bill Russell. He did not want to feed the criticism that he was more interested in personal stardom than winning. Although Chamberlain won two NBA championships and was the NBA's all-time leading scorer and rebounder when he retired, he was mostly remembered as the man who had single-handedly scored 100 points in a game. Chamberlain publicly embraced the 100-point game in his final years. On a radio show commemorating the game's 31st anniversary in 1993, he said, [...] "As time goes by, I feel more a part of that 100-point game." [...] He explained that growing up on the streets, he would have been derisively labelled a gunner, a glory-hound, for attempting 63shots. [...] "You take that many shots on the playground, and no one ever wants you on their team again." [...] He said he took shots he normally would not, noting that in contests which he considered to be better he scored 50 to 60 points on around 75 percent shooting, as opposed to his 57 percent shooting in the 100-point game. He was proud that people who knew nothing about basketball would point out the game to their kids when they saw him. [...] "I know that it has been my tag. I am definitely proud of it. But it was definitely a team effort. You had {{to see some of the}} things my teammates did to get me the ball ... It was almost like a circus <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> while." ...|$|E

Lydon has voiced his disapproval over the re-release and the campaign, saying in a statement: [...] "I would like to very strongly distance myself from the recent stories and campaign to push 'God Save The Queen' for the number one spot. This campaign totally undermines what The Sex Pistols stood for. It is certainly not my personal plan or aim. I am proud of what The Sex Pistols achieved and always will be but this campaign totally undermines what The Sex Pistols stood for. This is not my campaign.

I build upon recent developments in the empirical literature to present tentative evidence - some direct, some indirect - that sheds light on each of these three areas.

Mother, {{it seems}} to be certain that Meade has gained the day, and that the battles there in Pennsylvania have been about as terrible as any in the war--I think the killed and wounded there on both sides were as many as {{eighteen}} or twenty thousand--in one place, four or five acres, there were a thousand dead at daybreak on Saturday morning. Mother, one's heart grows sick of war, after all, when you see what it really is; {{every once in a while}} I feel so horrified and disgusted--{{it seems to}} me like a great slaughter-house and the men mutually butchering each other--then I feel how impossible it appears, again, to retire from this contest, until we have carried our points (it is cruel to be so tossed from pillar to post in one's judgment). Washington is a pleasant place in some respects--it has the finest trees, and plenty of them everywhere, on the streets and grounds. The Capitol grounds, though small, have the finest cultivated trees I ever see--there is a great variety, and not one but is in perfect condition. After I finish this letter I am going <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> hour's recreation. The great sights of Washington are the public buildings, the wide streets, the public grounds, the trees, the Smithsonian institute and grounds. I go to the latter occasionally--the institute is an old fogy concern, but the grounds are fine. Sometimes I go up to Georgetown, about two and a half miles up the Potomac, an old town--just opposite it in the river is an island, where the niggers have their first Washington reg't encamped. They make a good show, are often seen in the streets of Washington in squads. Since they have begun to carry arms, the Secesh here and in Georgetown (about three fifths) are not insulting to them as formerly.|$|R
