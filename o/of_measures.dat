The selection <b>of</b> <b>measuring</b> instruments is a complex task, which depends on the size, the character and the value <b>of</b> <b>measured</b> magnitude. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to analyze the existing methods for selection <b>of</b> <b>measuring</b> equipment. In the paper are presented the advantages and disadvantages of existing methods and recommendation for their implementation, according to the metrological tasks given. There are results obtained, using the Measurement System Analysis (MSA), for: selection <b>of</b> the correct <b>measuring</b> instrument and method; assessment the capabilities <b>of</b> <b>measuring</b> instruments; assessment <b>of</b> the procedures and operators; assessment <b>of</b> any <b>measuring</b> interactions, calculating the uncertainty <b>of</b> <b>measuring</b> <b>of</b> individual <b>measuring</b> instrument and/or measuring systems...|$|R

Pre-modern shepherds used their own presence, livestock guardian dogs, and protective structures such as barns and fencing.
