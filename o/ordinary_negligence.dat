25|$|The {{duty of care}} owed by {{trustees}} and fiduciaries has its partner in the common law of negligence, and was also long recognised by courts of equity. Millett LJ, however, in Bristol and West Building Society v Mothew emphasised that although recognised in equity, and applicable to fiduciaries, the duty of care is not itself a fiduciary duty, like the rule against conflicts of interest. This means that like <b>ordinary</b> <b>negligence</b> actions, the common law requirements for proving causation of loss apply, and the remedy for breach of duty is of compensation for losses rather than restitution of gains. In Mothew this meant that a solicitor (who occupies a fiduciary position, like a trustee) who negligently told a building society that its client had no second mortgage was not liable for the loss in the property's value after the client defaulted. Mr Mothew successfully argued that Bristol & West would have granted the loan in any case, and so his advice did not cause their loss.|$|E

6000|$|On November 28, 1729, Pope protested to Swift that it {{was many}} years since he endeavoured to play the wit in his {{familiar}} correspondence. He assured the Dean that as he had a greater love and esteem for him than for others, so he wrote to him with even more than <b>ordinary</b> <b>negligence.</b> [...] "I smile to think," [...] he continues, [...] "how Curll would be bit were our epistles to fall into his hands, and how gloriously they would fall short of every ingenious reader's expectations." [...] Warburton tells us that Pope valued himself upon this abstinence from all effort to be brilliant;[127] but his pretence of sinking the author in the friend gained no credit from Swift, who took care to show his incredulity. [...] "I find," [...] he replied on February 26, 1730, [...] "you have been a writer of letters almost from your infancy; and, by your own confession, had schemes even then of epistolary fame. Montaigne says {{that if he could}} have excelled in any kind of writing it would have been in letters; but I doubt they would not have been natural, for it is plain that all Pliny's letters were written with a view of publishing, and I accuse Voiture of the same crime, although he be an author I am fond of. They cease to be letters when they become a jeu d'esprit." [...] Pope seems to have suspected that this half-direct, half-oblique criticism was suggested by his recent collection and arrangement of his correspondence, and he denied, in his answer of April 9, that he was open to the censure. [...] "I am pleased," [...] he observed, [...] "to see your partiality, and it is for that reason I have kept some of your letters, and some of those of my other friends. These if I put together in a volume for my own secret satisfaction in reviewing a life passed in innocent amusements and studies, not without the good will of worthy and ingenious men, do not therefore say I aim at epistolary fame. I never had any fame less in my head; but the fame I most covet, indeed, is that which must be derived to me from my friendships." [...] The poet as usual adapted his assertions to the exigencies of the moment; for it was not for [...] "his own secret satisfaction in reviewing a life passed in innocent amusements and studies," [...] that he had deposited a duplicate of the volume with Lord Oxford, or kept it in readiness [...] "against the revival of slanders, and the publication of surreptitious letters." [...] This suppression of facts and motives could have had no effect in deluding Swift. Once on September 3, 1735, when his faculties were waning, and his powers rose and fell with his malady, he echoed back Pope's former language. [...] "Neither," [...] he said, [...] "did our letters contain any turns of wit, or fancy, or politics, or satire, but mere innocent friendship. I believe we neither of us ever leaned our head upon our hand to study what we should write next." [...] But by the 21st of October he had already returned to his old conviction, and after mentioning the publication of the poet's correspondence by Curll, he added, [...] "I believe my letters have escaped being published because I writ nothing but nature and friendship, and particular incidents which could make no figure in writing,"--a plain intimation that the opposite qualities had, in his opinion, caused the letters of Pope to be communicated to the world.|$|E

50|$|In {{order for}} the court to decide if the auditor's duty {{actually}} extended to the third party, for <b>ordinary</b> <b>negligence,</b> there are four legal approaches each state could follow. First is the Privity approach, which states the auditor is liable to a third party if an existence of a contract is in existence. This approach was established in Ultramares Corporation v. Touche and is the most limiting approach in respect to scope. Ultramares occurred in 1933 where the defendant CPA distributed an unqualified opinion on the balance sheet of a company. In addition to the CPAs estimations, Ultramares wrote out several loans to the company shortly before the company declared bankruptcy. Ultramares sued the CPA for <b>ordinary</b> <b>negligence.</b> The New York Court of Appeals ruled that CPAs are held accountable for <b>ordinary</b> <b>negligence</b> to their clients and third parties who identify themselves as users of the CPAs reports.|$|E

40|$|Prisoners {{who believe}} their {{constitutional}} rights were violated through deficient medical care can pursue {{a cause of}} action under 42 U. S. C. § 1983. To prevail on this claim, the prisoner must show that a medical provider acted with deliberate indifference towards a serious medical condition. <b>Ordinary</b> medical <b>negligence</b> is not a constitutional claim simply because the victim is a prisoner. Yet, circuits are split on exactly what physician behavior constitutes deliberate indifference. Courts have given varying degrees of deference to a physician 2 ̆ 7 s case-specific medical determination. Courts debate whether palliative care—relieving pain without an effort to cure—is enough; and whether constitutionalizing medical malpractice may have negative consequences on prison health care systems. In Petties v. Carter, the Seventh Circuit considered whether a physician 2 ̆ 7 s rationale for medical treatment created a triable issue {{as to whether or}} not he acted with deliberate indifference. The plaintiff suffered from a ruptured Achilles 2 ̆ 7 tendon. Standard treatment protocol for this injury includes, among other things, receiving a splint, which serves to immobilize the foot. The plaintiff alleged that, in not prescribing a splint, the defendants exacerbated his injury. However, the defendants contended that they were not deliberately indifferent; rather than using a splint, they decided to immobilize Petties 2 ̆ 7 foot through use of crutches, lay-in meals, and a lower bunk assignment. The Seventh Circuit, in a 6 - 3 decision, reversed the district court 2 ̆ 7 s grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants. This Note argues that the Seventh Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s reversal failed to adequately defer to: 1) precedent precluding from liability actors who demonstrate a reasonable response to risk of injury, 2) public policy support for respecting case-specific medical judgment, and 3) state medical malpractice laws, which are more equitable and efficient in addressing claims of deficient medical care...|$|R

40|$|Cyberbullying has {{exploded}} across Australian schools, but exactly {{what are the}} limits of a school 2 ̆ 7 s or school authority 2 ̆ 7 s responsibility and liability for cyberbullying? Apart from the humiliation and misery that such behaviour can cause, it is a legal minefield. The author outlines what the law says, although to date {{there have been no}} decisions by Australian courts on this issue. It is necessary to go back to first principles to establish the limits of a school 2 ̆ 7 s legal responsibility and apply those principles by analogy to cyberbullying. The focus in this article is on negligence rather than other legal issues to do with occupational health and safety, breach of contract or defamation. Schools are obliged to provide a safe environment for students and teachers: this is their duty of care. If online bullying takes place on school premises or at school events, or involves the use of school equipment or software, the school may be liable according to the <b>ordinary</b> principles of <b>negligence.</b> When cyberbullying occurs outside of school hours, away from school premises or without use of school equipment, the school {{may or may not be}} liable depending on whether the behaviour was a continuing of such behaviour at school. Liability kicks in where the school knows or ought to have known about the risks, the risks are not insignificant and it is reasonable for the school to do something about those risks. Conversely, where there is no connection between cyberbullying and the school, and prevention or even mitigation is outside its power, then it is very unlikely that the school will have any legal responsibility.

5000|$|It {{would be}} very {{surprising}} if our law drew the line between liability for <b>ordinary</b> <b>negligence</b> and liability for gross negligence. In this respect English law differs from civil law systems, for it has always drawn a sharp distinction between negligence, however gross, {{on the one hand}} and fraud, bad faith and wilful misconduct on the other. The doctrine of the common law is that: [...] "Gross negligence may be evidence of mala fides, but is not the same thing": see Goodman v. Harvey (1836) 4 A. & E. 870, 876, per Lord Denman C.J. But while we regard the difference between fraud {{on the one hand and}} mere negligence, however gross, on the other as a difference in kind, we regard the difference between negligence and gross negligence as merely one of degree. English lawyers have always had a healthy disrespect for the latter distinction. In Hinton v. Dibbin (1842) 2 Q.B. 646 Lord Denman C.J. doubted whether any intelligible distinction exists; while in Grill v. General Iron Screw Collier Co. (1866) L.R. 1 C.P. 600, 612 Willes J. famously observed that gross negligence is <b>ordinary</b> <b>negligence</b> with a vituperative epithet. But civilian systems draw the line in a different place. The doctrine is culpa lata dolo aequiparatur; and although the maxim itself is not Roman the principle is classical. There is no room for the maxim in the common law; it is not mentioned in Broom's Legal Maxims, 10th ed. (1939).|$|E

5000|$|Gross {{negligence}} is the [...] "lack of slight diligence or care" [...] or [...] "a conscious, {{voluntary act}} or omission in reckless disregard {{of a legal}} duty and of the consequences to another party, who may typically recover exemplary damages". Negligence {{is the opposite of}} diligence, or being careful. The standard of <b>ordinary</b> <b>negligence</b> is what conduct deviates from the proverbial [...] "reasonable person". By extension, if somebody has been grossly negligent, that means they have fallen so far below the ordinary standard of care that one can expect, to warrant the label of being [...] "gross". Prosser and Keeton describe gross negligence as being [...] "the want of even slight or scant care", and note it as having been described as a lack of care that even a careless person would use. They further note that while some jurisdictions equate the culpability of gross negligence with that of recklessness, most simply differentiate it from simple negligence in its degree.|$|E
50|$|There {{is no more}} {{possibility}} of conflict with the State in this situation than {{there is in the}} <b>ordinary</b> <b>negligence</b> or contract case in which a District Court applies state law under its diversity jurisdiction.

Quite the reverse, this action is part of the process which the City must follow in order to carry out the State's policy of expropriating private property for public uses. Finally, in this case, the State of Louisiana, represented by its constituent organ the City of Thibodaux, urges the District Court to adjudicate the state law issue. How, conceivably, can the Court justify the abdication of responsibility to exercise jurisdiction on the ground of avoiding interference and conflict with the State when the State itself desires the federal court's adjudication? It is obvious that the abstention in this case was for the convenience of the District Court, not for the State.|$|E

40|$|One of the {{fundamental}} issues {{in the discussion of}} auditors' liability is to whom auditors should be held liable for <b>ordinary</b> <b>negligence</b> under common law. Three judicial viewpoints prevail: the restrictive privity approach, the more liberal Restatement approach, and the most liberal foreseeability approach. To compare these three approaches from an efficiency perspective, this paper develops a model that features an owner-managed firm, an independent auditor, a continuum of unrelated lenders, and an impartial court. Double effort-incentive problems appear for the firm and the auditor. The firm has an additional incentive problem due to the sequential nature of its borrowing. This paper shows that the effort-incentive problem and the sequential borrowing problem of the firm render unambiguous improvements in audit effort/quality, capital investment, and social welfare as the judicial approach governing the scope of auditors' liability becomes more conservative. © 2002 Kluwer Academic Publishers. postprin...|$|E
