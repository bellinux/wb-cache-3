Today, these once remote areas are thriving cities. Dozens <b>of</b> <b>Catholic</b> churches, schools and cemeteries built on the land purchased by Hurley dot these areas.|$|E

5|$|In 1854, Pope Pius IX, {{with the}} support of the {{overwhelming}} majority <b>of</b> <b>Catholic</b> bishops, whom he had consulted from 1851 to 1853, proclaimed the Immaculate Conception as a Dogma in the Catholic Church. In 1870, the First Vatican Council affirmed the doctrine of papal infallibility when exercised in specifically defined pronouncements.

5|$|In {{the early}} 18th century, Rome's {{challenge}} to the Chinese Rites led to the expulsion <b>of</b> <b>Catholic</b> missionaries from China.

50|$|On November 4, 1838, {{the first}} mass was celebrated {{at a small}} church {{dedicated}} to Sts. Peter and Paul. Within the next five years, the population <b>of</b> <b>Catholics</b> continued to grow and flourish. In 1844, a new Diocese was formed with its See at Hartford, Connecticut. Its Bishop, William Tyler elected to reside in Providence, as the majority <b>of</b> <b>Catholics</b> lived there. As the number <b>of</b> <b>Catholics</b> in the region continued to grow, the Sts. Peter and Paul Church building could not accommodate the increasing numbers <b>of</b> Irish <b>Catholic</b> immigrants.|$|R

5|$|Prior to the United States' Civil War, Catholicism grew {{slowly in}} America, but afterward, {{it became more}} {{widespread}} as Catholic immigrants from eastern Europe moved to the four counties, which include Armstrong, Fayette, Indiana, and Westmoreland, to mine coal and produce coke to fire steel mills in Pittsburgh. This influx <b>of</b> <b>Catholic</b> immigrants resulted {{in the creation of}} more than 80 parishes and missions in the counties between 1865 and 1917.|$|E

5|$|Traditional Victorian dancing fairies and elves {{appear in}} much of Tolkien's early poetry, and have {{influence}} upon his later works {{in part due to}} the influence of a production of J. M.

5|$|After Gia Long's death, Minh Mạng and Duyệt clashed frequently. As the {{southern}} governor, Duyet had significant autonomy, as only {{the centre of}} Vietnam was under direct royal rule. Duyet was a supporter <b>of</b> <b>Catholic</b> missionaries, while Minh Mạng was a staunch Confucianist. Duyet often disobeyed Minh Mạng's orders, and the emperor attempted to reduce the Duyet's autonomous power, which became easier with the general's death in 1831. The governor's post was abolished and the region was put under direct control.|$|E

5|$|After the riots, Bishop Kenrick {{ended his}} efforts to {{influence}} the public education system and began encouraging the creation <b>of</b> <b>Catholic</b> schools, with 17 being founded by 1860. The friars of the Church of St. Augustine sued the city of Philadelphia for not providing the church with adequate protection, claiming $80,000 in damages. The city argued that the friars could not claim their civil rights were violated, as the Order of St. Augustine was a foreign organization under the Pope. Furthermore, the city argued that the friars took a vow of poverty {{and could not be}} property owners. The Augustinians ended up proving the Order was incorporated in 1804 and was awarded $45,000. The church was rebuilt in 1848.|$|E
5|$|After {{violations}} of the 1933 Reichskonkordat between the Church and Nazi Germany, Pope Pius XI issued the 1937 encyclical Mit brennender Sorge which publicly condemned the Nazis' persecution of the Church and their ideology of neopaganism and racial superiority. The Church condemned the 1939 invasion of Poland that started World War II and other subsequent wartime Nazi invasions. Thousands <b>of</b> <b>Catholic</b> priests, nuns and brothers were imprisoned and murdered throughout the countries occupied by the Nazis, including Saints Maximilian Kolbe and Edith Stein. While Pope Pius XII has been credited with helping to save {{hundreds of thousands of}} Jews in the Holocaust, the Church has also been accused of encouraging centuries of antisemitism and not doing enough to stop Nazi atrocities.|$|E
5|$|Bucer {{believed}} that the Catholics in the Holy Roman Empire could be convinced to join the Reformation. Through a series of conferences organised by Charles V, he tried to unite Protestants and Catholics to create a German national church separate from Rome. He did not achieve this, as political events led to the Schmalkaldic War and the retreat of Protestantism within the Empire. In 1548, Bucer was persuaded, under duress, to sign the Augsburg Interim, which imposed certain forms <b>of</b> <b>Catholic</b> worship. However, he continued to promote reforms until the city of Strasbourg accepted the Interim, and forced him to leave.|$|E
