5|$|Initially, {{there was}} little {{opposition}} during the consultation period before the alterations were made. However, opposition to {{the reduction of the}} water area grew. The process that resulted in the alteration was criticised for being non-transparent and sneaky. Some organisations complained that they were not given an <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>express</b> their opinion before the change was gazetted, and many politicians and the chief town planner were not informed. Critics bitterly insinuated that politically influential members of the Royal Canberra Golf Club, whose course was situated on the location of the proposed West Lake, were responsible for the change in policy.|$|E

25|$|In 1995, a 19-year-old Samoëla {{attended}} a Vahombey {{concert at the}} Cercle Germano-Malgache that inspired him to become more directly involved in songwriting. The concert impressed upon him the <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>express</b> himself musically by challenging Malagasy cultural and musical norms. In particular, he decided to disregard taboos that prevented artists from addressing controversial or delicate topics in song, instead writing slang-infused lyrics that spoke directly to youth concerns. Many of his lyrics were also imbued with such elements of hainteny as its figurative and poetic descriptions and plays on words.|$|E
25|$|Students {{with special}} needs {{struggle}} not only with writing and reading acquisition, but with social and emotional development and confidence about their writing. Dialogue journals as an individualized means of private, mutual communication can provide students with support in handling emotions, conflicts, and frustrations. For students with limited writing confidence and proficiency, the <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>express</b> ideas and thoughts with teacher elaboration and modeling, and without correction, {{has been shown to}} increase their time on task, writing length, and writing quality. Using a single-subject baseline and intervention design, Anderson, Nelson, Richardson, Webb, and Young explored the value of dialogue journals in developing a more supportive student-teacher relationship with emotionally and behaviorally challenged middle school students.|$|E

25|$|Nkrumah's retitling {{as prime}} {{minister}} had not given him additional power, and he sought constitutional reform {{that would lead to}} independence. In 1952, he consulted with the visiting Colonial Secretary, Oliver Lyttelton, who indicated that Britain would look favourably on further advancement, so long as the chiefs and other stakeholders had the <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>express</b> their views. Initially skeptical of Nkrumah's socialist policies, Britain's MI5 had compiled large amounts of intelligence on Nkrumah through several sources, including tapping phones and mail interception under the codename of SWIFT. Beginning in October 1952, Nkrumah sought opinions from councils and from political parties on reform, and consulted widely across the country, including with opposition groups. The result the following year was a White Paper on a new constitution, seen as a final step before independence. Published in June 1953, the constitutional proposals were accepted both by the assembly and by the British, and came into force in April of the following year. The new document provided for an assembly of 104 members, all directly elected, with an all-African cabinet responsible for the internal governing of the colony. In the election on 15 June 1954, the CPP won 71, with the regional Northern People's Party forming the official opposition.|$|E

[...] "Democrats for Nixon", a group affiliated with Nixon's campaign, asked Democratic voters [...] "as one Democrat to another" [...] {{to vote for the}} congressman, sending out flyers which did not mention his political affiliation. Boddy quickly struck back in his paper, accusing Nixon of misrepresenting himself as a Democrat. A large ad in the same issue by the [...] "Veterans Democratic Committee" [...] warned Democratic voters that Nixon was actually a Republican and referred to {{him for the first time}} as [...] "Tricky Dick".

500|$|The 1909 score {{contains}} {{a number of}} minor changes from the autograph score. Some are changes of phrase: Cavaradossi's reply to the sacristan when he asks if the painter is doing penance is changed from [...] "Pranzai" [...] ("I have eaten.") to [...] "Fame non ho" [...] ("I am not hungry."), which William Ashbrook states, {{in his study of}} Puccini's operas, accentuates the class distinction between the two. When Tosca comforts Cavaradossi after the torture scene, she now tells him, [...] "Ma il giusto Iddio lo punirá" [...] ("But a just God will punish him" [...] ); formerly she stated, [...] "Ma il sozzo sbirro lo pagherà" [...] ("But the filthy cop will pay for it."). Other changes are in the music; when Tosca demands the price for Cavaradossi's freedom ("Il prezzo!"), her music is changed to eliminate an octave leap, allowing her more <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>express</b> her contempt and loathing of Scarpia in a passage which is now near the middle of the soprano vocal range. A remnant of a [...] "Latin Hymn" [...] sung by Tosca and Cavaradossi in act 3 survived into the first published score and libretto, but is not in later versions. According to Ashbrook, the most surprising change is where, after Tosca discovers the truth about the [...] "mock" [...] execution and exclaims [...] "Finire così? Finire così?" [...] ("To end like this? To end like this?"), she was to sing a five-bar fragment to the melody of [...] "E lucevan le stelle". Ashbrook applauds Puccini for deleting the section from a point in the work where delay is almost unendurable as events rush to their conclusion, but points out that the orchestra's recalling [...] "E lucevan le stelle" [...] in the final notes would seem less incongruous if it was meant to underscore Tosca's and Cavaradossi's love for each other, rather than being simply a melody which Tosca never hears.|$|E
