The peer survey is by nature subjective, but the technique of asking industry leaders to rate their competitors is a commonly accepted practice.

40|$|Background: {{internet}} use continues to grow. It is often assumed that most users are younger or middle aged. We {{set out to}} establish how access to {{and use of the}} Internet varied with age. Methods: we surveyed a sample of patients attending urology outpatient clinics in a one week period. Results: use of the internet decreases with increasing age. However 75 % of ages 65 – 69 and 55 % of over 80 ’s access the internet, with most doing so at least weekly. Whilst health-related information is very relevant, only 20 % of patients had looked at the hospital departmental website prior to a visit. Conclusion: as health professionals we must ensure that we have relevant up-to-date information <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>websites</b> for patients to access of all age ranges. Departments should give consideration to courses or other novel methods (e. g. compu-ters in GP surgeries, text to speech software, etc) to improve internet access in older people...|$|R

Having about the size of Belgium, most of Saya lies in international waters, 'in the high seas' legally speaking, governed only by the U.N. Law of the Sea. In 1997, Goreau and I sailed to Saya de Malha's many shallow sites and established the first accretion structure there, powered by floating photovoltaics and thus claiming the banks.
