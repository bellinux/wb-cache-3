40|$|At {{present the}} most common {{measures}} for assessing stage acoustic conditions on concert hall stages are the Support measures - STearly and STlate. These measures are based on monophonic <b>omnidirectional</b> <b>responses</b> obtained at 1 m from the sound source, on a stage without a full symphony orchestra (or similar group of people) present. Both objective and subjective studies have been conducted, the latter using questionnaires with several orchestras and dialogue with musicians.

These have been complemented with analytical as well as scale and computer model investigations into sound behaviour on both empty and occupied concert stages.

As it is well known, usually these numerical models are based on geometrical acoustics, and produce as output octave-band energetic impulse responses. These impulse responses have to be converted in wide-band waveform for being used as FIR filters, which can be convolved with dry signals, obtaining synthetic surround sound in various formats. The authors already developed in the past a suitable wide-band conversion algorithm for mono (<b>omnidirectional</b> receiver) impulse <b>response</b> and for binaural impulse responses.

30|$|The use of {{micro-electro-mechanical system}} (MEMS) {{microphones}} {{as a replacement}} for ordinary microphone capsules has gained interest in [12 – 14], especially for the application of directive beamforming [15, 16] due to its reduced size and cost compared with an ordinary microphone capsule. However, differential microphone arrays are not ideal in the presence of wind noise. The directional beam pattern may lead to a significant amplification of the wind noise due to the correlation properties of the noise terms [17]. The required first-order low-pass filter for the equalization regarding the speech signal makes this behavior even worse. One proposed solution for a differential microphone array is to switch to a single microphone with an <b>omnidirectional</b> <b>response</b> if wind noise is detected [17].|$|E

40|$|The {{major focus}} {{of the work in}} this thesis is on the {{solution}} of the electromagnetic wave equations in novel structures that exhibit nonlinearity in their response to the incident field. These structures are further characterized by the presence of a spatial periodicity in their dielectric permittivity. The presence of spatial periodicity results in a number of coherent scattering phenomena when the light wavelength is comparable to the period of this spatial perturbation. Here we use a combination of analytical and numerical methods to gain insight into these phenomena. Two problems each involving a different nonlinear phenomenon have been considered. First, we take the classical problem of hysteretic switching response exhibited by a nonlinear periodic structure. This problem is reexamined {{in the context of the}} presence of a negative refractive index (left-handed electromagnetic structure). We theoretically predict an exotic behavior that involves an <b>omnidirectional</b> <b>response</b> quite distinct from the well known behavior. We examine the field distribution in detail and propose the existence of a spatial soliton called the zero-n gap soliton. Next, we investigate the practical problem of output power scaling in fiber lasers. Self scattering nonlinearities currently set the limit on power scalability. In particular, for narrow linewidth systems, Stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) is known to be the limiting nonlinearity. This scattering phenomenon is a result of Bragg reflection from a periodic index modulation induced by an acoustic wave. Several novel schemes are proposed and analyzed in terms of their ability to suppress SBS and enhance power scalability...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: For some patients, {{conventional}} {{hearing aids}} might have disadvantages that clearly limit {{the benefit of}} using them. The middle ear implant, Vibrant Soundbridge hearing prosthesis offers an approach to help such patients. Our study's objective was to identify the binaurality in a well-fitted digital hearing aid worn in the contralateral ear in recipients experienced with use of the Vibrant Soundbridge middle ear implant device. STUDY DESIGN: In a prospective study, warble-tone thresholds and stereophony were evaluated for the following conditions: (1) binaural unaided-with the middle ear implant inactive and the behind-the-ear hearing aid removed; (2) middle ear implant alone-middle ear implant active, behind-the-ear hearing aid removed; (3) middle ear implant plus behind-the-ear omnidirectional-middle ear implant active, behind-the-ear active; and (4) behind-the-ear omnidirectional alone-middle ear implant inactive, behind-the-ear omnidirectional active. Behind-the-ear omnidirectional and behind-the-ear {{is defined as the}} behind-the-ear active in the <b>omnidirectional</b> or directional <b>response,</b> respectively. Behind-the-ear is a contralateral digital hearing aid to the middle ear implant. Benefits such as improved sound detection, speech perception in quiet and in noise, and sound quality were investigated. The evaluation of subjective hearing benefit was based on the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB) test. Paired t tests (subject) were used to analyze the differences between mean thresholds for the different test conditions. SETTING: Tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: Eight adults (aged 45 - 68 yr) had undergone implantation with a single Vibrant Soundbridge at least 12 months before starting the study. These eight subjects presented no contraindication for contralateral hearing aid use. Patients were fitted 5 weeks before testing with a Siemens Signia digital behind-the-ear hearing aid in the side contralateral to the Vibrant Soundbridge. RESULTS: Five weeks after use of the contralateral hearing aid together with the middle ear implant, mean differences in warble-tone thresholds between Conditions 2 and 3 and between Conditions 3 and 4 were both statistically significant. The mean differences in speech reception thresholds were in line with the mean differences in average warble-tone thresholds. The mean speech reception threshold for the middle ear implant plus behind-the-ear omnidirectional condition was slightly worse (3 dB) than that for the middle ear implant alone condition; however, this difference was not statistically significant. Whereas speech reception threshold difference between Condition 1 and Condition 4 was not statistically significant (60 dB and 61 dB, respectively). The mean difference for the 0 -degree azimuth alone was statistically significant (p < 0. 05) for the conditions middle ear implant alone and middle ear implant plus behind-the-ear omnidirectional. The middle ear implant alone appears to give good sensitivity at 2 kHz for any direction. Increasing scores indicate greater percentages of problems. Percentages of problems were on average lower for the middle ear implant when used with the contralateral digital hearing aid based on the global score. CONCLUSION: The use of a middle ear implant Vibrant Soundbridge together with a contralateral digital hearing aid improved functional gain and speech perception thresholds in quiet, especially for the sound coming {{from the front of the}} patient. The use of a middle ear implant together with a contralateral digital hearing did not significantly improve hearing in noise...|$|R
40|$|At the Laboratory of Acoustic Imaging and Sound Control, much {{research}} {{is done in}} the field of room acoustics. The impulse response is widely regarded as the most meaningful characteristic in room acoustics. For a certain combination of source and receiver position, the impulse response is the sound pressure at the receiver position as a function of time generated by an acoustic pulse emitted at the source position. A major requirement for the source is omnidirectionality: the source must radiate acoustic energy equally in all directions. In 1980, Beentjes [2] has developed an acoustic source consisting of a 32 -face source sphere and a separate bass loudspeaker. This source radiates omnidirectionally from 60 to 2800 Hz. Taking in account that the range of interest is from 50 to 5000 Hz, a successor is desirable. In the present research, the utility of a rotating loudspeaker for room response measurements is investigated. In theory, reproducing a linear frequency sweep with a rotating source results in decomposition of the directivity of the source. The contributions of the mono-pole, dipole and higher order pole terms to the directivity pattern of the source are separated. A monopole is <b>omnidirectional,</b> thus the <b>response</b> to an <b>omnidirectional</b> source can be calculated. Simulations confirm the theory, the directivity is decomposed. Use of a ‘normal’ linear frequency sweep results in a required measuring time of at least 100 minutes, which is not acceptable. Use of parallel linear frequency sweeps reduces the required time to a couple of minutes. A disadvantage of parallel sweeps is that the position of the turntable at the beginning must be the same as the position at the ending of the measurement. This requires a very constant angular velocity of the turntable. Doppler effects have a large influence on the impulse response. Doppler effects result in a complex directivity, resulting in many higher order pole contributions to the impulse response. In addition, the power spectrum gets the shape of a sinc-function, with a smaller central peak for a higher angular velocity. Experiments confirm the results of the simulation. The impulse response of a rotating loudspeaker under anechoic conditions shows many peaks at the positions corresponding to monopole, dipole and higher order poles. The S/N ratio in room measurements is 65 dB at best and 40 dB at worst, which is a very promising result. Using better equipment, the S/N ratio can become even higher. The rotating source in combination with a frequency sweep is a promising tool for impulse response measurements in rooms. The idea of creating a monopole with one loudspeaker is elegant and the achieved S/N ratio is very good. A negative point is the high demand on the measuring equipment (a very constantly rotating turntable is necessary). A problem that has not been investigated in this research, is the extension to 3 D. A rotating speaker has only a monopole directivity component in a horizontal plane perpendicular to the rotation axis. Radiation {{in the direction of the}} rotation axis is not influenced by the rotation. Therefore, a loudspeaker rotating on one axis does not radiate isotropically.

Each AVS consists of four collocated subsensors: one pressure sensor (with an <b>omnidirectional</b> <b>response)</b> and three particle-velocity sensors (with dipole responses) oriented in mutually orthogonal directions. The array configuration is designed to boost the input power of the desired signal, and to ensure that the characteristics of the noise at the different channels are sufficiently diverse (lending towards more effective noise suppression). Since changes in the array's position correspond to the desired speaker's movement, the relative source-receiver position remains unchanged; hence, the need to track fluctuations of the steering vector is avoided. Conversely, the spatial statistics of the noise are subject to rapid and abrupt changes due to sudden movement and rotation of the user's head. Consequently, the algorithm must be capable of rapid adaptation. We propose an algorithm which incorporates detection of the desired speech in the time-frequency domain, and employs this information to adaptively update estimates of the noise statistics. Speech detection {{plays a key role in}} ensuring the quality of the output signal. We conduct controlled measurements of the array in noisy scenarios. The proposed algorithm preforms favorably with respect to conventional algorithms. Comment: The abstract displayed in the metadata field is slightly modified due to space limitations.

With a raising demand for clean and {{renewable}} energy sources in recent decades, {{dye sensitized solar cell}} (DSSC), as an efficient and low-cost solar cell technology, have attracted considerable attention and several efforts have been directed for the optimization of all components of DSSCs including photoanode, sensitizer dye, hole transport layer and counter electrode. The objective of this thesis is to provide a better understanding on the function of photoanode in overall performance of DSSC device by highlighting problems and limitations and offering proper solutions to tackle these deficiencies. Based on this understanding, this thesis reports, fabrication, characterization and analysis of designed three different cells to boost device photovoltaic performance which includes: 1) angstrom thick ZnO-sheathed TiO 2 nanowires as photoanodes, 2) multifunctional omnidirectional antireflective coating, 3) peptide nanofiber network templated ALD-grown TiO 2 nanostructures as photoanodes in DSSC. Since photoanode-dye interface engineering is of utmost importance, the first of our proposals in this thesis relies on a systematic approach to understand the impact of atomic layer deposited (ALD) angstrom-thick ZnO sheath on hydrothermally grown TiO 2 nanowires (NWs) core utilized as photoanodes in DSSC. The results show that this ultrathin layer will contribute at device efficiency enhancement almost three times via reducing recombination rate of injected electrons, enhancement in collection efficiency of electrons via reducing density of surface trap states without hampering injection efficiency and increased dye uptake on TiO 2 nanowires’ surface which in turn leads to increased light absorption.
