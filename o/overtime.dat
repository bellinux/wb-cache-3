5|$|Since postseason games cannot {{end in a}} tie, {{unlike the}} preseason or regular season, {{additional}} <b>overtime</b> periods are played as necessary until a winner is determined. Furthermore, all clock rules apply as if a game had started over. Therefore, if the first <b>overtime</b> period ends with the score still tied, the teams switch ends of the field prior to double <b>overtime.</b> If a game was still tied with two minutes to go in double <b>overtime,</b> {{there would be a}} two-minute warning (but not during the first <b>overtime</b> period as in the regular season). And if it were still tied at the end of double <b>overtime,</b> there would be a kickoff to start triple <b>overtime.</b> Although a contest could theoretically last indefinitely, or last multiple <b>overtime</b> periods like several National Hockey League postseason games, no NFL playoff game has ever gone into triple-overtime. The longest NFL game played to date is 82 minutes, 40 seconds: Miami Dolphins kicker Garo Yepremian made the winning 37-yard field goal after 7:40 of double-overtime to defeat the Kansas City Chiefs, 27–24, in the 1971–72 NFL playoffs on December 25, 1971.|$|E

5|$|After {{losing the}} first game of their Adams Division semi-final to the Quebec Nordiques in <b>overtime,</b> the Canadiens won ten <b>overtime</b> games en route to the title, setting an NHL record for most {{consecutive}} <b>overtime</b> victories in a playoff year. As with the 1986 championship, the team was led by Roy, who won his second Conn Smythe Trophy. The defining moment of the 1993 Stanley Cup Finals occurred in the second game, with less than two minutes to play and Montreal trailing the series 1–0 and the game 2–1. Attempting to gain an advantage for his team, head coach Jacques Demers called for a measurement of Los Angeles Kings forward Marty McSorley's stick. Referee Kerry Fraser determined that the blade had an illegal curve, and assessed a penalty against McSorley. Montreal scored on the power play to tie the game, and then won in <b>overtime</b> 3–2, to tie the series. Montreal also won Games 3 and 4 in <b>overtime</b> before eliminating the Kings in Game 5, 4–1. The celebration was marred by one of the worst riots in Montreal history, as fans rioted through downtown Montreal causing over $2.5million in property damage and 168 injuries.|$|E

5|$|Per NCAA <b>overtime</b> rules, {{each team}} {{got the ball}} at their own 25-yard line for one drive. In the first <b>overtime</b> period, Kent State got the ball down to the NIU 5 before kicking a 33-yard field goal. Northern Illinois responded with a field goal of their own, a 40-yarder by Sims. After the first <b>overtime,</b> the score was tied at 37. NIU got the ball to start the second <b>overtime,</b> and took only two plays to score a touchdown: a 23-yard run by Akeem Daniels {{followed}} by a 2-yard run by Lynch, his third touchdown of the game. Kent State then had to score a touchdown in order to force the game to a third <b>overtime.</b> They were unsuccessful in doing so, however, as on 4th and 8, Keith threw an interception, thus ending the game with the Northern Illinois Huskies victorious by a score of 44-37.|$|E
