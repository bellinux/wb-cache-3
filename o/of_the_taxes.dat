5|$|In {{the early}} Western Han, {{imperial}} relatives and some military officers {{who had served}} Emperor Gaozu were made kings who ruled over large semi-autonomous fiefs, but once the non-related kings had died off, an imperial edict outlawed all non-Liu family members from becoming kings. The emperor's brothers, paternal cousins, brother's sons, and emperor's sons—excluding the heir apparent—were made kings. The emperor's sisters and daughters were made princesses with fiefs. Although the central government eventually stripped away {{the political power of}} the kings and appointed their administrative staffs, kings still had a right to collect a portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>taxes</b> in their territory as personal income and enjoyed a social status that ranked just below the emperor. Each king had a son designated to be heir apparent, while his other sons and brothers were given the rank of marquess and ruled over small marquessates where a portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>taxes</b> went to their private purse. Although kings and marquesses enjoyed many privileges, the imperial court was at times aggressive towards them to check their power. Starting with Emperor Gaozu's reign, thousands of noble families, including those from the royal houses of Qi, Chu, Yan, Zhao, Han, and Wei from the Warring States period, were forcibly moved to the vicinity of the capital Chang'an. In the first half of Western Han, resettlement could also be imposed on powerful and wealthy officials as well as individuals who owned property worth more than a million cash.|$|E

The population rose from 80,000 in 1817 to about 88,000 in 1824. During the eight following years a special cess was levied on ghee and other pruducts and at a cost of £25,000 (Rs. 2,50,000) the city walls were repaired. About the same time a cantonment was established on a site {{to the north of the}} city, chosen in 1830 by Sir John Malcolm. These (1825-1832), though some of them years of agricultural depression and dull trade, brought a further increase of population to 90,000. In the next ten years the state of the city improved. The population rose (1816) to about 95,000. The Hutheesing Jain Temple, completed in 1848, and other buildings of that time (1844-1846) show that some of the city merchants were possessed of very great wealth. The public funds available after the walls were finished were made use of for municipal purposes. Streets were widened and thoroughfares watered. During the following years the improvement continued.

40|$|The {{general idea}} is <b>the</b> following: any <b>tax</b> {{authority}} that respects {{basic human rights}} has to impose taxes on a base to avoid random and arbitrary taxation. <b>The</b> <b>tax</b> base should be announced prior to <b>the</b> imposition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> and therefore, taxpayers are given an advanced warning concerning <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> base. <b>The</b> advanced warning enables the taxpayers to adjust <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> base to <b>the</b> new circumstances {{so that they can}} adjust their behavior to <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tax.</b> This adjustment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> base by <b>the</b> taxpayer is responsible to <b>the</b> excess burden <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tax.</b> Retroactive taxes, that is taxes imposed on tax bases determined in the past and that, therefore, cannot be changed by the taxpayers are considered as unethical.
