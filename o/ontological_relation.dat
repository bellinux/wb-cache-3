They are thus constituted as comportive or intentional. This means that {{not only are they}} able to comport to beings but they can thematize the relation and beings themselves. The question about being, like all its comportments is a concern of Dasein. But in ontology, Dasein proves itself to be the fundamental being to be questioned. The priority means “the question of being means to make a being-he who questions-transparent in its being”.. Also, the preontological ontical understanding and <b>ontological</b> <b>relation</b> to being and beings grounds or is radicalized into ontology.

In this paper, we have developed an ontology enabled annotation and knowledge management to provide semantic web services from three perspectives, personalized annotation, real-time discussion, and semantic content retrieval. Personalized annotation is used to equip the collaborators with Web based authoring tools for commenting, knowledge articulation and exertion by extracting metadata from both the annotated content and the annotation itself, and establishing <b>ontological</b> <b>relation</b> between them. The realtime discussion is used as a bridge to link collaborators and knowledge and motivate collaborators for knowledge sharing by building profiles for collaborators and knowledge (in the forms of content and annotation) during every discussion session, and establishing <b>ontological</b> <b>relation</b> between the collaborators and knowledge for the use of semantic content retrieval.

To address this issue, we can relate <b>ontological</b> <b>relations</b> to different research results obtained from various studies. To implement this solution, our envisaged evidence/discovery-based methodology integrates a higher-level ontology (systematic review ontology) into a systematic review agent which employs a Fuzzy Inference System in order to automatically modifyontological relations of a domain ontology based on the evidence received from information resources.

40|$|Abstract. Automatic {{extraction}} of semantic relationships between entity instances in an ontology {{is useful for}} attaching richer semantic metadata to documents. In this paper we propose an SVM based approach to hierarchical relation extraction, using features derived automatically {{from a number of}} GATE-based open-source language processing tools. In comparison to the previous works, we use several new features including part of speech tag, entity subtype, entity class, entity role, semantic representation of sentence and WordNet synonym set. The impact of the features on the performance is investigated, as is the impact of the relation classification hierarchy. The results show there is a trade-off among these factors for relation extraction and the features containing more information such as semantic ones can improve the performance of the <b>ontological</b> <b>relation</b> extraction task. ...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, I first {{propose a}} new {{account of the}} concept of ontological form and its {{difference}} from the notion of ontological matter or content. I begin by suggesting that we replace “ontological matter” or “content” with just “being” because the latter term catches my proposal better. My first main theses are that the concept of ontological form is explicated by the concepts of nature-neutral internal relation and existence or being and that the ontological forms of entities consist of these relations, that is, of formal <b>ontological</b> <b>relations</b> in which the entities are. Secondly, I apply this account of ontological form to categories and their existence and reality. I defend a relationist view that, to put it briefly, categories are pluralities of entities that exist in the same formal <b>ontological</b> <b>relations</b> (in the same order in some cases). Therefore they do not exist as additional entities to their members; they exist only as pluralities. Yet they may be said to be real in a sense that their membership is determined by formal <b>ontological</b> <b>relations</b> that actually hold of the relata of these relations and the holding can be expressed by true relational predications. My view is moderately realist although I do not identify categories with universals. Hence, I hold a nominalist view of categories...|$|R

Firstly, that they are indeed objects and secondly that they demonstrate the ‘work’ of art, or rather that they are things that have a ‘thingly’ nature. For Heidegger, the things around us, including artworks within the current aesthetic paradigm, are rooted firmly within an established subject-object order that ‘enframes’ {{our understanding of the}} world as well as our encounters with art. By revealing the objects used to create the artworks as things like any other (the jug, the lightmeter, the camera) I hope to identify both the subject matter and the artworks themselves as objects in the world.

40|$|In Lowe’s Four-Category Ontology, {{instantiation}} {{is a basic}} formal <b>ontological</b> <b>relation</b> between particulars (objects, modes) {{and their}} kinds (kinds, attributes).

Nevertheless, according to Lowe, objects obtain their identity conditions in a more general level than specific natural kinds, which allows for kind change. There also seems to be actual examples of kind change. The advocate of Four-Category Ontology is obliged to resolve the tension between these mutually incompatible claims. In this article, we argue that the only viable option for the advocate of Four-Category Ontology is to bite the bullet and stick to the necessity of each of the most specific natural kind to the object instantiating it. As a major drawback, the four-category ontologist does not have any credible means to allow for kind change or determination of the identity conditions in a more general level...|$|E

40|$|What {{we tried}} to do in this {{presentation}} is to chart the <b>ontological</b> <b>relation</b> of the three most important concepts of value, virtue and justice. We found that in Aristotle the three are intimately, ontologically and dialectically related. Without the one we can not have the other two. We also investigated the related issue of the unity of facts and values. We saw that this issue is related to the above analysis because without a common language, use and meaning related to these concepts, there can be no justice, especially in its social context. We also saw that this unity can exist only in a theistic metaphysics and that it appeared much later than the medieval time, and {{is a product of the}} post-seventeenth century industrial mechanistic attitude towards man and the world. I hope that this was profitable for any future discussions on justice and what all justice disputes should take into account as presuppositions for any rational and peaceful negotiations, especially between parties coming from quite different cultural backgrounds.

40|$|This article {{offers a}} Kantian constructivist account of objectivity. Kant’s {{analysis}} of respect is a promising {{starting point for}} a phenomenological defense of objectivity. Kant takes the moral feeling of respect {{to show that we}} are responsive to the categorical demands of morality. Unlike the realist, Kant does not try to demonstrate an <b>ontological</b> <b>relation</b> between how things appear to us and how they stand independently of us. Rather, his argument establishes that our experience of morality is congruent with the objectivist aspirations of morality. This article argues that constructivism best accounts for this congruence by taking the feeling of respect as the subjective condition of the reality of practical reason. Surprisingly, this results in a far more ambitious claim than the realist can defend. While the realist argument is pro tanto, Kantian constructivism purports to provide a conclusive argument for the objectivity of practical reason. Kantian constructivism survives Williams’ critique and presents some important advantages over traditional accounts of the role of moral experience in foundational arguments...|$|E

In this article, the author provides a detailed reading of Heidegger’s Der Spruch des Anaximander, showing how Heidegger relates this fragment to his thinking of Being, the latter having been ‘forgotten’ by metaphysics. Heidegger’s reading {{at the same time}} involves a contemplation of technology and of the <b>ontological</b> <b>relation</b> of beings to each other. Derrida’s reading of Heidegger’s Der Spruch highlights specifically those parts of Heidegger’s text where that which precedes Being’s gathering, Being’s disjoining or dissemination, is pointed to. This disjoining, Derrida contends, speaks of the gift of a day more ancient than memory itself and ties in closely with certain aspects of the thinking of Marx. Derrida’s focus on that which precedes Being is in turn related to his contemplation of the law or condition of possibility of technology and also of that which makes possible a relation to the other as other. This condition of possibility, or the gift of Being, which Heidegger’s text also speaks of, involves a ‘higher law’ which can serve as a ‘measure’ for the evaluation, interpretation and transformation of positive law...|$|E
40|$|Principles of {{the industrialized}} {{architecture}} design were first formulated by Le Corbusier in “Towards a New Architecture” (1923). The influence of his vision has globally dominated architectural design both in the West and the East. In this study I focus on the phenomena—the homogenized and commercialized style of contemporary built environment affected by Le Corbusier—seen both in Finland and South Korea. There are several issues based on the phenomena. Firstly, it reveals the connection between Descartes’ dualism and Le Corbusier’s influence all over the world. Secondly, the trend of form in architectural design has lost lived experience with the built environment. Finally, by losing the <b>ontological</b> <b>relation</b> between human being and architecture, the replicated architecture has led us to feel homelessness and placelessness as {{the problem of the}} modern man, because the commercialized architecture has a lot of noise to get people’s attention instead of making them experience existential meaning. In this research, I argue that architectural silence triggers people to be aware of this modern problem and to reconcile the relationship between architecture and human beings. This is because, firstly, the awareness of engagement on the beings and the architecture is introduced as the meaning of bodily experience with architecture. Secondly, the relationship supports people to feel the sense of Being-in-the-World, a phenomenological solution to the modern man. Thirdly, the engagement and <b>ontological</b> <b>relation</b> is revealed in a certain atmosphere: architectural silence. Therefore, I will study what is the meaning of architectural silence and how the silence and architecture are connected with experience to recall the being’s existential meaning by conducting phenomenological interpretation. This study is separated into five parts: ‘Crisis of contemporary built environment’, ‘Critical reading of Merleau-Ponty’s phenomenology’, ‘Phenomenological method’, ‘Phenomenology of St. Henry's Ecumenical Art Chapel’ (Sanaksenaho Arkkitehdit Oy, 2005), and Conclusion. In the first and second part, I will first argue how Cartesian Dualism and Le Corbusier have affected the built environment in the 21 st Century, and then the main idea of Merleau-Ponty’s philosophy will be studied to criticize the dualism and to make a bridge between phenomenology and architectural language. The third part introduces phenomenological method, which is called “Step by Step” method, as an interdisciplinary research between ontology and architecture. In fourth and fifth part, the phenomenological interpretation is applied to the St. Henry's Ecumenical Art Chapel. In conclusion, the phenomenological interpretation of the chapel shows as below: Firstly, architecture, as a material form of body and experience unity, bases on architectural silence which leads people to recall the existential meaning of architectural experience with their memory. Moreover, the architectural silence stimulates people to encounter the empathetic connection between the being itself and architecture. Finally, architectural silence encourages people to have their own life story with architectural body-experience in the architecture...|$|E

By drawing a schematic graph, designers can visualize in a synthetic way {{the relationships between}} many aspects: functions and spaces, distribution of layouts, space adjacency, influence of traffic flows within a facility layout, and so on. This process can be automated {{through the use of}} modern ICT tools that allow the designer to manage a large amount of information. The work that we will present is part of ongoing research into how modern parametric software influences decision-making on the basis of automatic and optimized layout distribution. The method involves two phases: the first aims to define the <b>ontological</b> <b>relation</b> between spaces, with particular reference to a specific building typology (rules of aggregation of spaces); the second, entails the implementation of these rules through specialist software. The generation of ontological relations begins with the collection of data from historical manuals and analyses of case studies. These analyses aim to generate a "relationship matrix" based on preferences of space adjacency. The phase of implementing the previously defined rules is based on the use of Grasshopper to analyse and visualize different layout configurations. The layout is generated through the simulation of a process of colliding spheres, which each represent specific functions of the design program. The spheres are attracted or rejected {{as a function of the}} matrix of relationships as defined above. The layout thus obtained will remain in a sort of abstract state without regard to information about the exterior form, but still provide a useful configuration for the designer to use in the decision-making process. In addition, preliminary results gathered through the analysis of several case studies will be presented. These results provide a good variety of layout distribution over a short time for medium and large-scale problems...|$|E

40|$|There {{are close}} links between {{emotions}} and values, {{or at least}} this is what our ordinary ways of talking suggest. For many, if not all, types of emotion it is thus possible to find a corresponding evaluative term, one often derived from {{the name of the}} emotion in question. These are for example evaluative terms such as ‘shameful’, ‘offensive, ‘annoying’, ‘dangerous’, ‘contemptible’, ‘admirable’, ‘amusing’, ‘exciting’, ‘boring’, and the like. Starting perhaps from these linguistic observations, the philosophical task is of course to elucidate the nature of the links between emotions and values, and attempts at doing so have traditionally revolved around the following three questions: first, {{what is the role of}} emotions in elucidating the nature of value? For example, should dangerousness be understood in term of the fear response? Second, what is the role of emotions in our getting access to values? For example, what may be the role of fear in becoming aware that a given animal is dangerous? Third, what value do emotions have? For example, is fear of special value because it helps behaving appropriately towards its object? We hall take up these questions in turn and survey the most important answers they have received in the literature. As we shall discover, answering the first question amounts to surveying a variety of theories according to which there is an <b>ontological</b> <b>relation</b> between values and emotions since the former should be elucidated in terms of the latter (Sec. 1). Addressing the second question consists in reviewing theories according to which there is an intentional relation between emotions and values because the former are apprehensions of value or evaluations (Sec. 2).

40|$|Since {{the end of}} the 19 th century {{a debate}} has began about the {{dependence}} of Augustine 2 ̆ 7 s speculation on Plotinus and Porphyry 2 ̆ 7 s thought. Many scholars have seen Augustine speculation and even his understanding of Christianity as a disguised version of Platonism. In Augustine 2 ̆ 7 s Confessiones, however, one can observe an unprecedented stress on the idea of the 2 ̆ 2 self 2 ̆ 7 as an entity determined by temporality. The 2 ̆ 2 I 2 ̆ 2 appears in the Confessiones with a centrality never seen before: this 2 ̆ 2 I 2 ̆ 2 does not limit himself to tell us his story, which becomes the story, but reflects on who he himself is {{and what it means to}} say 2 ̆ 2 I 2 ̆ 2. What is at stake is the emergence of the 2 ̆ 2 self 2 ̆ 2 as something bound to time, but at the same time held together by its relation to Eternity. Starting from an acknowledgment of the special place occupied by the idea of the 2 ̆ 2 self 2 ̆ 2 in the Confessiones, we can wonder what were the paths that led to this new vision, and from what sources. This work demonstrates that the idea of the 2 ̆ 2 self 2 ̆ 2 as a temporal being first dawned on Augustine 2 ̆ 7 s mind while he was writing the De Genesi contra Manichaeos. It is through a reflection on the act of Creation and on the <b>ontological</b> <b>relation</b> and difference between the Creator and the creature that Augustine first understood as a new acquisition the temporality of the human soul. If this new point of view, however, represents a revolution and a change of perspective regarding the understanding that the previous philosophical tradition, as represented especially by Neo-Platonic speculation, had had of the human soul, the full comprehension of its theoretical consequences is something Augustine himself understood only over time. Thus, the De Genesi contra Manichaeos is for us a document of the progression of his thought: although having asserted the temporality of the human soul, Augustine keeps thinking of the perfect state of the soul (beatitudo) in terms that exclude temporality as a positive constituent and are still very dependent on the ancient philosophical models. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{provides}} a comparative {{analysis of the}} different ways Hegel and Sartre understand that consciousness can be alienated. Because understanding the various ways Hegel and Sartre hold that consciousness can be alienated is not possible without first understanding what each thinker understands by consciousness, I first identify and outline the different ways Hegel and Sartre conceptualise consciousness’s ontological structure before identifying the various ways each thinker understands that consciousness can be alienated. The general argument developed shows that while Hegel and Sartre agree that alienation is a constitutive aspect of consciousness’s existence and are, therefore, allies {{in the battle against}} it, Sartre’s analysis of consciousness’s ontological structure is unable to provide the same depth of analysis as Hegel’s. Put differently, I believe it is Hegel’s analysis of consciousness’s ontological structure that {{provides a}}n analysis of alienation that is more nuanced, subtle, complex, and multi-dimensional than the account Sartre’s provides. To support my argument, I first explore Sartre’s understanding of consciousness’s ontological structure. This discloses that, because Sartre defines consciousness as ontologically nothing, he holds that consciousness is defined in strict ontological opposition to objectivity. Consciousness’s ontological nothingness leads Sartre to hold that consciousness is free to choose its mode of being. This leads me to identify what Sartre holds to be constitutive of authentic and inauthentic modes of being. But while Sartre distinguishes between the ontological structure of consciousness and its experiences, I argue that Hegel: 1) does not introduce a distinction between consciousness’s ontological structure and its mode of being, but holds that consciousness’s self-understanding and ontological structure develop through its experiences; and 2) holds that consciousness is not ontologically opposed to objectivity, but is a spiritual synthesis of subjectivity and objectivity. I show that because Hegel holds that consciousness’s intentional object is an aspect of its ontological structure, rather than something simply opposed to itself, and because he recognises that consciousness must learn what it is ontologically by experiencing numerous different relations with its object, he is able to show that while the subject/object binary opposition of Sartre’s analysis of consciousness’s ontological structure describes one potential <b>ontological</b> <b>relation</b> consciousness can have to its object, {{it is not the only}} one. Indeed, Hegel’s analysis of consciousness’s ontological structure insists that consciousness will only truly understand its ontological structure if it learns to not think of itself in terms of the subject/object dichotomy and, instead, realises that it is a spiritual synthesis of subjectivity and objectivity. To show how this fundamental difference manifests itself throughout their thought, I identify and compare what each thinker’s understanding of consciousness’s ontological structure means in terms of consciousness’s relation to the world, alienation, authenticity, ethics, self-transformation, and social relations.

40|$|In this paper, we {{outline the}} {{development}} of a system that automatically constructs ontologies by extracting knowledge from dictionary definition sentences using Robust Minimal Recursion Semantics (RMRS), a semantic formalism that permits underspecification. We show that by combining deep and shallow parsing resources through the common formalism of RMRS, we can extract <b>ontological</b> <b>relations</b> in greater quality and quantity. Our approach also has the advantages of requiring a very small amount of rules and being easily adaptable to any language with RMRS resources. ...|$|R

Ontologies are {{commonly}} {{considered as one}} of the essential parts of the Semantic Web vision, providing a theoretical basis and implementation framework for conceptual integration and information sharing among various domains. In this paper, we present the main principles of a new ontology acquisition framework applied for semi-automatic generation of scientific portals. Extracted <b>ontological</b> <b>relations</b> {{play a crucial role in}} the structuring of the information at the portal pages, automatic classification of the presented documents as well as for personalisation at the presentation level. ...|$|R
