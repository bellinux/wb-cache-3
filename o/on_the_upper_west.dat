40|$|Reports were scanned {{in black}} and white at a {{resolution}} of 600 dots per inch and were converted to text using Adobe Paper Capture Plug-in. On Maui, shrubland and alpine ecosystems occur in and around Haleakala National Park (HALE) <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mountain’s <b>upper</b> <b>west</b> slope, <b>upper</b> south slope, and within the crater (actually a large erosional depression). The arthropod fauna of these areas has been studied on numerous occasions, including a relatively exhaustive inventory in the mid- 1970 ’s. These and other collections have ensured that the endemic arthropod fauna in HALE’s subalpine shrubland and alpine aeolian zones is relatively well known. While new endemic species continue to be found, the fauna in well-studied taxonomic groups is probably relatively complete. In contrast, the introduced fauna continue to grow by virtue of continual new introductions, and repeated inventories (i. e. monitoring) are the only way to measure the rate of this growth and to make early detections of particularly destructive species. We conducted an inventory of arthropods in shrublands and alpine habitats on Haleakala’s <b>upper</b> <b>west</b> slope and summit using three systematic sampling techniques in two elevational zones, supplemented by limited opportunistic hand collecting. This report catalogues all arthropod species collected {{in the course of the}} inventory, and when possible, provides additional information relevant to the species listed. We assess inventory completeness and the relative effectiveness of the different sampling techniques. We also make limited comparisons between our inventory, which took place between 2001 and 2004, and the most recent similar effort, conducted in 1975 to 1977. This inventory was carried out under a cooperative agreement (Task Agreement No. CA 8012 -AO- 001) between the National Park Service, Pacific Island Network and the University of Hawaii at Manoa, Pacific Cooperative Studies Unit.

40|$|International audienceThe {{carbon cycle}} of the Arctic Ocean is tightly {{regulated}} by land–atmosphere–cryosphere–ocean interactions. Characterizing these environmental exchanges and feedbacks is critical to facilitate projections of the carbon cycle under changing climate conditions. The environmental drivers of sinking particles including organic carbon (OC) to the deep-sea floor are investigated with four moorings including sediment traps and currentmeters at the Arctic gateway in the eastern Fram Strait, which is the area where warm anomalies are transported northwards to the Arctic. Particles fluxes were collected over one year (July 2010 –July 2011) and have been analysed to obtain {{the content of the}} lithogenic fraction, calcium carbonate, OC and its stable isotopes, opal, and the grain size. Records of near bottom current speed and temperature along with satellite observations of sea ice extent and chlorophyll-a concentration have been used for evaluation of the environmental conditions. We found increased lithogenic fluxes (up to 9872 mg m− 2 d− 1) and coarsening grain size of settling particles in late winter–early spring. At the same time, intensifications of the northward flowing west Spitsbergen current (WSC) were recorded. The WSC was able to resuspend and transport northwards sediments that were deposited at the outlet of Storfjordrenna and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> slope <b>west</b> of Spitsbergen. The signal of recurrent winnowing of fine particles was also detected in the top layer of surface sediments. In addition, an increased arrival of sea ice transported ice rafted detritus (> 414 detrital carbonate mineral grains larger than 1 mm per m 2) from the southern Spitsbergen coast along with terrestrial organic matter was observed beyond 1000 m of water depth during winter months. Finally, the downward particle fluxes showed typical temporal variability of high latitudes, with high percentages of the biogenic compounds (opal, organic carbon and calcium carbonate) linked to the phytoplankton bloom in spring–summer. However, on an annual basis local planktonic production was a secondary source for the downward OC, since most of the OC was advected laterally by the WSC. Overall, these observations demonstrated the sensitivity of the downward flux of particles to environmental conditions such as hydrodynamics, sea ice rafting, and pelagic primary production. Future alteration of the patterns of natural drivers due to climate change is thus expected to cause major shifts in the downward flux of particles, including carbon, to the deep sea ecosystems...|$|R

40|$|Throughout {{the last}} decade large {{sediment}} drifts located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> continental rise <b>west</b> of the Antarctic Peninsula were the target of oceanographic measurements, bathymetric mapping, seismic investigations. shallow sediment coring, and deep-sea drilling by Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 178. These studies concluded that {{for most of the}} late Neogene and Quaternary a generally SW-ward directed bottom current affected <b>the</b> deposition <b>on</b> <b>the</b> drifts. In particular during glacial periods, the deposition was additionally influenced by NW-ward directed transport of terrigenous detritus supplied by turbidity currents from the Antarctic Peninsula continental slope. In a recent study, however, the palaeomagnetic signal of the drift sediments recovered at two ODP Leg 178 sites (1095 and 1101) was interpreted to provide spatial and directional information <b>on</b> <b>the</b> physical record of the NE-ward flowing Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). Here we investigate the link between the clockwise flowing ACC and the generally SW-wards flowing near-bottom contour current. We show that at the ODP Leg 178 sites <b>on</b> <b>the</b> western Antarctic Peninsula continental margin the ACC only affects the ocean circulation above ca. 1000 m water depth. Therefore, the signal of ACC flow might only be archived in the ice-rafted debris (IRD) content of the drift sediments. However, the IRD from the Leg 178 sites accounts for only a small proportion of the drift sediments and is dominantly of local origin. Past variability of bottom-water flow around the sediment drifts was reconstructed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> basis of seismic studies and clay mineralogical and grain-size analyses.
