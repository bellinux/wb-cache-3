He made his debut on 11 August, {{the opening day of}} the 2007–08 season, in a 2–1 victory over Halifax Town. Following a 3–1 defeat to Stafford Rangers for Weymouth, manager Jason Tindall singled out Critchell for praise, saying; [...] "The only <b>one</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> today who deserves any credit for their performance was Kyle Critchell but overall it was not good enough".

500|$|Homer {{sings the}} end of the theme song to Family Ties while talking to an {{administrator}} at the annex center. Smithers's recollection of his marriage parodies the two plays Cat on a Hot Tin Roof and A Streetcar Named Desire, both written by American playwright Tennessee Williams. Homer's bedroom rant to Marge is a parody mishmash of four popular films: ...And Justice for All (1979), A Few Good Men (1992), Patton (1970), and Chinatown (1974). He says: [...] "Look Marge, you don't know what it's like. I'm the <b>one</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> every day putting his ass on the line. And I'm not out of order! You're out of order. The whole freaking system is out of order. You want the truth? You want the truth?! You can't handle the truth! 'Cause when you reach over and put your hand into a pile of goo that was your best friend's face, you'll know what to do! Forget it, Marge, it's Chinatown," [...] all of which are lines from those films.|$|E
500|$|In the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] {{featurette}} {{published by}} HBO following the airing of the episode, David Benioff {{spoke about the}} revelation in King's Landing, and Tommen's decision to abolish [...] "trial by combat," [...] stating [...] "This moment is a grievous blow for Cersei because she's been counting on trial by combat really {{since the end of}} season five. This was always her ace in the hole, the Mountain was never going to lose a trial by combat there's no <b>one</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> who could beat him. And then Tommen takes it away from her and knowing really what he's doing. He might be a weak King, but he's not an idiot, he understands that this move is going to mean that she's probably not going to fare that well in this trial. So it's a pretty devastating moment for Cersei, and you see that in her reaction, and partly because it just bodes so ill for this coming trial, and partly because it's her own son who's really betrayed her." ...|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, Backspacer {{displays}} {{a more positive}} outlook than the band's last few albums. Vedder credited the election of President Barack Obama as inspiration for the optimistic lyrics. Regarding the lyrics, Vedder said, [...] "I've tried, over the years, to be hopeful in the lyrics, and I think that's going to be easier now." [...] Gossard stated, [...] "We've {{made a couple of}} political and pointed records, the last two in particular, and just to move away from that is great, because it allows you {{to go back to that}} when you need to and it refreshes everybody, and it comes down to a beat and a melody and your friends and a lyric and a poem and something that's important to you." [...] Vedder stated he did not spend [...] "more than half hour" [...] writing the lyrics to each song: [...] "If it’s not gonna happen quick then I don’t wanna do it, because it means there’s another <b>one</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> that is gonna happen quick, and is gonna hit you like a lightning bolt." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{next day}} Americans United for Separation of Church and State ran a piece by Rob Boston that linked Bannon's {{thinking}} {{with that of}} Voris, characterizing Bannon's statement as a plan to destroy government that took no account of whether people relied on a government program or agency. The piece continued, saying, [...] "Sadly, Bannon {{is far from the}} only <b>one</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> bent on nihilistic destruction." [...] It then went on to name Voris and his media site saying that he had once called [...] "to tear down the wall of separation between church and [...] replace our democracy with a far-right Catholic king who will decide what’s best for us." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the prime}} of his career, Johnson's fastball was {{sometimes}} clocked over , even as high as [...] with a low three-quarters delivery (nearly sidearm). His signature pitch was a slider that broke down and away from left-handed hitters and down and in to right-handed hitters. The effectiveness of the pitch is marked by its velocity being in the low 90s along with tight late break; hitters often believe they were thrown a fastball until the ball breaks just before it crosses home plate. Right-handed hitters have swung through and missed sliders that nearly hit their back foot. [...] Johnson dubbed his slider [...] "Mr. Snappy". [...] In later years, his fastball declined to the [...] range and his slider clocked at around [...] Johnson also threw a split-finger fastball that behaved like a change-up and a sinker to induce ground-ball outs. In a June 27, 2012, appearance on The Dan Patrick Show, Adam Dunn (a left-handed batter) was asked who the best pitcher he faced was. [...] "Honestly, Randy Johnson when he was good. It's hopeless. It's like a hopeless feeling. The first time you face him you feel like he's going to hit you right {{in the back of}} the neck when he throws it, like every pitch is going to hit you {{in the back of the}} neck. And it ends up down and away for a strike and you just have to trust it's going to be a strike, and heaven forbid he doesn't lose <b>one</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> and heaven forbid, there goes your cheek." ...|$|E

And for me, I've only been flattered by parodies of my own songs. There are some great <b>ones</b> <b>out</b> <b>there.</b> I have absolutely no problem with Al. I think it's a huge compliment for what he's done. At the same time, it's generally not my favorite of the parodies. I {{think it was a}} safe one. It wasn't as exciting as some others. There's one really special one which you should look up by a guy called Tom Gleeson, and it's just really clever. And for me, that was a more exciting one.|$|R
