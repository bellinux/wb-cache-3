50|$|It {{is common}} {{practice}} to heat-treat bran {{with the intention}} of slowing undesirable rancidification. However, a very detailed 2003 study of heat-treatment of oat bran found a complex pattern whereby increasingly intense heat treatment reduced the development of hydrolitic rancidity and bitterness with time, but increased <b>oxidative</b> <b>rancidity.</b> The authors recommended that heat treatment should be sufficient to achieve selective lipase inactivation, but not so much as to render the polar lipids oxidisable upon prolonged storage.|$|E

In this study, {{in order to}} inhibit from <b>rancidity</b> <b>oxidative,</b> four kinds of antioxidants were used which contained Butylated hydroxyanisol, Butylated hydroxyltoluene, Tetriary butylhydroquinone and natural antioxidant, Tocopherol. Samples contained heattreated sausages of poultry meat were that antioxidants added to them. For evaluation of antioxidants effect, we used Active Oxygen Method (AOM) and Oven Storage Test (OST). Results showed that M sample (mixing of TBHQ, BHA and BHT) had the highest (P< 0. 01) and C sample (lacking antioxidants) had the lowest effect (P< 0. 01) on stability against oxidation spoilage or rancidity...|$|R
50|$|Sodium nitrite is {{also able}} to {{effectively}} delay the development of <b>oxidative</b> <b>rancidity.</b> Lipid oxidation {{is considered to be}} a major reason for the deterioration of quality of meat products (rancidity and unappetizing flavors). Sodium nitrite acts as an antioxidant in a mechanism similar to the one responsible for the coloring affect. Nitrite reacts with heme proteins and metal ions, neutralizing free radicals by nitric oxide (one of its byproducts). Neutralization of these free radicals terminates the cycle of lipid oxidation that leads to rancidity.|$|E
5000|$|One {{parameter}} used to characterise an oil is its acidity. In this context, [...] "acidity" [...] is not chemical acidity in {{the sense}} of pH, but the percent (measured by weight) of free oleic acid. Measured by quantitative analysis, acidity {{is a measure of the}} hydrolysis of the oil's triglycerides: as the oil degrades, more fatty acids are freed from the glycerides, increasing the level of free acidity and thereby increasing hydrolytic rancidity. Another measure of the oil's chemical degradation is the peroxide value, which measures the degree to which the oil is oxidized damaged by free radicals, leading to <b>oxidative</b> <b>rancidity.</b> Phenolic acids present in olive oil also add acidic sensory properties to aroma and flavor.|$|E
50|$|<b>Oxidative</b> <b>rancidity</b> is {{associated}} with the degradation by oxygen in the air. Via a free radical process, the double bonds of an unsaturated fatty acid can undergo cleavage, releasing volatile aldehydes and ketones. Oxidation primarily occurs with unsaturated fats. For example, even though meat is held under refrigeration or in a frozen state, the poly-unsaturated fat will continue to oxidize and slowly become rancid. The fat oxidation process, potentially resulting in rancidity, begins immediately after the animal is slaughtered and the muscle, intra-muscular, inter-muscular and surface fat becomes exposed to oxygen of the air. This chemical process continues during frozen storage, though more slowly at lower temperature. The process can be suppressed by the exclusion of oxygen or by the addition of antioxidants. Thus, airtight packaging will slow rancidity development.|$|E
40|$|Common kilka were chilled during 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 days to {{determine}} the influence of such storage times of fish over the quality of the final canned product. For this propose, common factors for determination of fish quality (moisture, total lipid, free fatty acid, peroxide, thiobarbituric acid and fatty acid profile) were selected and compared with the formation of fluorescence compounds in fish tissue and filling media of canned kilka. In this work common indices showed higher <b>oxidative</b> and hydrolytic <b>rancidity</b> of canned samples compared to raw material but the trend of deterioration with the increase of chilled storage time was not well shown. However, filling media fluorescence compounds was significantly increased with the increase of chilled storage time and the decrease of fish primary quality (P&lt; 0. 05).

40|$|The {{possible}} {{application of}} several multilayered biobased materials for packing different food products, ranging from short to long shelf life products, was investigated. Several transparent and metalized cellulose based film, a cellulose/PLA based film, a xylan based film and PLA trays with a PLA based film, a PLA/cellulose based film and a PLA/paper based film as topfilm were examined. The investigated food products were tomatoes, steak, French fries, ham sausage, {{filet de saxe}} (a raw cured pork meat product) grated cheese, tortillachips, rice cakes, dry biscuits and potato flakes all packed under air or modified atmosphere (MAP). The food products were stored at refrigerated (4 °C) or room temperature and analyzed at certain points during their shelf life. For the short shelf life products, microbiological analysis (total plate count, lactic acid bacteria and yeast and moulds), gas composition of the headspace, color, aw and pH were followed and those quality parameters were each time compared with their evolution in the conventionally packaged food products. For the medium shelf life products also hydrolytic and <b>oxidative</b> lipid <b>rancidity</b> were monitored. For the long shelf life products no microbiological analysis were performed. Furthermore, sensory characteristics of the different food products were evaluated. From the storage experiments it could be concluded that most investigated biobased materials are good functional substitutes for the conventional packaging materials currently used. For example, the oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations followed the same trend as in the reference film and the concentrations remained below the maximum limit or above the minimal limit during the entire shelf life of the food products...|$|R
50|$|Oxygen {{helps to}} keep the fresh and natural color of food products, {{prevents}} the growth of anaerobic bacteria (present in certain types of fish and vegetables) and allows {{fresh fruit and vegetables}} to breathe. In the case of fruit and vegetables, the absence of O2 can lead to anaerobic respiration in the package which accelerates senescence and spoilage. Levels of O2 that are too high do not retard respiration significantly and it is around 12% of O2 where the respiration rate starts to decrease. So oxygen is used at low levels (3-5%) for positive effect. When packaging meat and fish, for example, the high CO2-levels are effective bacterial and fungal growth inhibitors. In the case of vegetables and fruits, CO2 is not a major factor since CO2-levels above 10% are needed to suppress fungal growth significantly. Unfortunately higher levels than 10% of CO2 are working phytotoxic for fruit & vegetables. Nitrogen, for example, is used as a filler gas since it neither encourages nor discourages bacterial growth and it prevents the <b>oxidative</b> <b>rancidity</b> caused by the presence of oxygen in packaged snacks and dried products.|$|E

40|$|Many {{objective}} {{chemical tests}} {{have attempted to}} correlate with organoleptic evaluation of <b>oxidative</b> <b>rancidity.</b> Major chemical tests used to detect <b>oxidative</b> <b>rancidity</b> of lipids measure nonvolatile high molecular weight carbonylic substances which make no considerable contribution to rancid flavors. High molecular weight carbonyls are present at much greater concentrations than volatile low molecular weight carbonyls. Peroxides and other unknown substances also react in these chemical tests to give at best an empirical evaluation. A 3 -methyl- 2 -benzothiazolinone hydrazone chemical test is proposed which corrected some deficiencies of earlier procedures, and was correlated with organoleptic evaluation of rancid turkey samples. The proposed test measures <b>oxidative</b> <b>rancidity</b> in terms of milligrams of acetaldehyde per kilogram of sample. A comparison of the 3 -methyl- 2 -benzothiazolinone hydrazone method with a widely used chemical test was conducted.

30|$|The {{iodine value}} of the {{essential}} oil was 82  mg I 2 / 100  mg.

It is useful in predicting the drying property of oils, and the moderate value obtained places the oil between non-drying and semi-drying oil; hence, the oil can be used in industries as feedstocks. Low iodine number implies the presence of few unsaturated bonds and hence low susceptibility to <b>oxidative</b> <b>rancidity</b> (Fox and Stachowiak 2007). Therefore, the lower the iodine value, the lower the degree of unsaturation and hence the lower the tendency of the oil to undergo <b>oxidative</b> <b>rancidity.</b>|$|E

The dietary treatments included sorghum-based diets with 0, 15, 30, or 45 % S-DDGS, a sorghum-based diet with 30 % corn DDGS (C-DDGS), and a corn-based diet with 30 % C-DDGS. Shoulders from 24 barrow and 24 gilt carcasses were ground, packaged, and evaluated for proximate and fatty acid composition, iodine value (IV), objective color and oxidation shelf-life, and sensory attributes. Finishing diet and gender did not interact to affect composition, fatty acid profile, color, or <b>oxidative</b> <b>rancidity</b> (P > 0. 05). Pork from gilts contained less fat and more moisture (P 0. 05) total color change from 0 to 120 h, <b>oxidative</b> <b>rancidity,</b> or sensory attributes of ground pork. Finishing diet had no effect on total fat, moisture, or protein composition. Increasing S-DDGS resulted in a linear (P < 0. 001) decrease in saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and an increase (P < 0. 01) in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and pork IV. Pork from pigs fed 30 % S-DDGS had a greater percentage of MUFA, a lower percentage of PUFA, and reduced IV compared with pork from pigs fed 30 % C-DDGS.

40|$|<b>Oxidative</b> <b>rancidity</b> {{was found}} to be a problem in goat milk infant formula powder. <b>Oxidative</b> <b>rancidity</b> results from the lipid {{oxidation}} processes, where oxygen reacts with unsaturated fatty acids from milk powder to produce lipid hydroperoxides and radicals, the primary oxidation products. These primary oxidation products are odourless; however, they are very reactive to breakdown into hydrocarbons, aldehydes and ketones. Aldehydes have low flavour threshold limits and are responsible for causing the rancid flavour in the milk powder. Peroxide value (PV) {{is one of the most}} widely used tests for <b>oxidative</b> <b>rancidity</b> as it is a measure of the concentration of lipid hydroperoxides; however, it is difficult to provide a specific guideline relating PV to rancidity. A reliable test is needed to determine whether the goat milk infant formula powder is unacceptable due to <b>oxidative</b> <b>rancidity</b> to the consumer. It was found that oxygen was a useful parameter to monitor lipid oxidation. Oxygen is the main reactant in lipid oxidation, and the rate of oxygen consumption is a useful tool to track lipid oxidation. Hexanal was determined to be the main secondary oxidation product responsible for the off flavour of milk powder. An experiment of accelerated storage trials for two infant formula products (Powder A and Powder B) was conducted by using a range of higher temperatures from 37 °C to 57 °C over a period of 12 to 24 weeks. Headspace oxygen and headspace hexanal of the milk powder in the glass vials were measured over the storage period. Sensory analysis was also conducted in parallel with the storage trial to provide a relationship between the sensory score and hexanal concentration, ultimately determining the unacceptable flavour threshold limit for hexanal concentration. The chemical kinetic constants were estimated by fitting a general nth order reaction with an Arrhenius law model with the concentration of oxygen obtained experimentally. The model followed half order reaction for both products. The Arrhenius rate constant, k 0, and activation energy, E, were found to be 7. 8 × 109 % 0. 5 week- 1 and 62. 0 kJ mol- 1 for Powder A and 1. 34 × 107 % 0. 5 week- 1 and 45. 60 kJ mol- 1 for Powder B. It was discovered that oxygen and hexanal were highly correlated with R 2 of 0. 905 for Powder A and R 2 of 0. 918 for Powder B when fitted exponentially.
