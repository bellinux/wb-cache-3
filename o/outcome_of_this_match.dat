50|$|Prior to the match, Eagles captain Zulqarnain Haider {{was removed}} from the {{captaincy}} amid allegations that he was under pressure to select certain players for the game; he never played for Lahore again. The captaincy then passed to Ahmed Dar, with Sarwar proceeding to be selected. The National Bank of Pakistan needed to win the match convincingly to improve their net run-rate and qualify for the semi-final of the tournament. The <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>match</b> was later investigated, but the Pakistan Cricket Board said nothing untoward had been discovered about the match.|$|E
50|$|The {{final score}} was 67-0 {{in favor of}} the American college team, but the score was not the {{important}} <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>match.</b> The undermanned Outlaws were able to organize a quality match for their visitors when {{no one else in the}} IAFL was up to the task. The team and their coaches were able to take the match as a chance to see how the sport was supposed to be played. Both teams had fun, and the fans in attendance were entertained. However, the Outlaws suffered several injuries as a result of the game and were forced to forfeit the rest of their fixtures that season.|$|E
50|$|The {{upcoming}} {{boxing match}} against the NaPolA school in Potsdam {{is a great}} source of interest for both schools. Friedrich, who has been accused of complicity in Albrecht's death by his indifferent father, is told that his future at Allenstein is very much tied to the <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>match.</b> Scouts from prominent German universities are watching, as well as Allenstein's headmaster and Gauleiter Heinrich Stein. Despite managing to overpower his opponent, Friedrich now hesitates to strike a fallen opponent. The other boy gets back up and begins punching Friedrich, who does not retaliate. Friedrich stands impassively until he is knocked out, turning what nearly was a victory for Allenstein into a humiliating defeat. As the camera gradually blurs the scene out of focus, Friedrich, knocked out and lying on the floor, closes his eyes and smiles with relief.|$|E
40|$|Rubinstein and Wolinsky (1990 b) {{consider}} a simple decentralized market in which agents either meet randomly or choose their partners volunatarily and bargain over the terms {{on which they}} are willing to trade. Intuition suggests that if there are no transaction costs, the <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>matching</b> and bargaining game should be the unique competitive equilibrium. This does not happen. In fact, Rubinstein and Wolinsky show that any price can be sustained as a sequential equilibrium <b>of</b> <b>this</b> game. In this paper, I consider Rubinstein and Wolinsky's model and show that if the complexity costs of implementing strategies enter players' preferences (lexicographically), together with the standard payoff in the game, then the only equilibrium that survives is the unique competitive outcome. This will be done both for the random matching and for the voluntary matching models. Thus the paper demonstrates that complexity costs might have a role in providing a justification for the competitive outcome.

40|$|This paper looks {{inside the}} firm and investigates how trade alters the {{matching}} of worker-specific abilities and task-specific requirements. The <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>matching</b> depends on how firms organize their recruitment process {{and how much they}} invest into the screening of applicants. In the open economy, the most productive firms start exporting. They increase their market share and therefore find it attractive to increase their screening investment, which improves the matching outcome. Things are different for non-exporters, whose market share shrinks in the open economy, lowering their incentive to invest to screen applicants. Due to this asymmetric response, access to trade raises the dispersion of labor productivity between heterogeneous producers, {{while at the same time}} increasing the average quality of worker-task matches and thus economy-wide labor productivity. The productivity-enhancing effect of endogenous adjustments in the firm-internal allocation of workers to tasks points to a so far unexplored channel through which gains from trade can materialize...|$|R

50|$|His {{most famous}} bout was against heavyweight boxing {{champion}} Muhammad Ali on June 26, 1976 in Tokyo. Inoki initially promised Ali a rigged match {{to get him}} to fight in Japan, but when the deal materialized, Ali's camp feared that Inoki would turn the fight into a shoot, which many believe was Inoki's intention. Ali visited a professional wrestling match involving Inoki and witnessed Inoki's grappling ability. The rules of the match were announced several months in advance. Two days before the match, however, several new rules were added which severely limited the moves that each man could perform. A rule change that had a major effect on the <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>match</b> was that Inoki could only throw a kick if one of his knees was on the ground. In the match, Ali landed a total of six punches to Inoki, and Inoki kept to his back in a defensive position almost the full duration of the match of 15 rounds, hitting Ali with a low kick repeatedly. The bout ended in a draw, 3-3. Ali left without a press conference and suffered damage to his legs as a result of Inoki's repeated leg kicks.|$|E
5000|$|On January 6, 1983, Colón {{defeated}} Ric Flair in a {{match for}} the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. However, the <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>match</b> was not made official or aired on NWA television. Flair received the belt back in a phantom title change that took place on January 23, 1983. Later that year, Colón required hospitalization due to injury following a match against Bruiser Brody. This loss was publicized and made the covers of El Nuevo Día and El Vocero, {{both of which are}} mainstream newspapers. Two weeks later, Colón defeated Brody in a rematch. In December 1983, Capitol Sports Promotions began a feud between Colón and Flair, which included a skit where the NWA champion criticized Capitol's title claiming that he was the only [...] "real world champion", leading to a steel cage match to determine the [...] "undisputed champion of the Universe". The encounter headlined an event held in Bayamón on December 18, 1983. Colón won cleanly, and the WWC World Heavyweight Championship was renamed to Universal Heavyweight Championship as a result. In subsequent interviews, Flair has stated that the NWA title was not on the line for this match because an official unification was proposed, but he vetoed it.|$|E

50|$|Totally {{obsolete}} {{and even}} dangerous (barbed wire around the ground, dilapidated stands), the stadium hosted the 1978 UEFA Cup Final. The stadium's capacity was then less than 12,000 seats, in precarious conditions, heavy rain having fallen on Corsica that day, turning the ground into a quagmire, which handicapped the <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> decisive <b>match</b> (0-0). The crowd of 15,000 spectators announced appears exaggerated, {{but given the}} fervor around Corsica for the game, many fans {{did not hesitate to}} stand up, packed tightly, to attend the game. The record attendance at the stadium was set on 1 September 2012, when 15,505 people saw Bastia lose against St. Etienne (0-3) in league matches. Behind it the following record was set in 1978, when 15,000 people saw Bastia draw against PSV Eindhoven (0-0, 1978) in UEFA Cup final matches.|$|R
25|$|Jeff Crowe {{was seen}} as {{ultimately}} responsible for the ignorance of all five match officials (himself and umpires Bucknor, Dar, Koertzen and Bowden) of the ICC's playing conditions with regards the number of overs required before Duckworth-Lewis can determine the <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> a <b>match.</b> <b>This</b> resulted in Australia and Sri Lanka having to play out three unnecessary overs in near darkness since they had been told they would otherwise have to return and play out the overs on the following day.

50|$|Since its {{formation}} in July 1996, the New World Order (nWo) organization {{had been a}} dominant force. Hollywood Hogan, {{the leader of the}} nWo, had been the WCW World Heavyweight Champion for most of the preceding year. Most of the WCW programming in 1997 surrounded Sting, who began a change of character into a mysterious avenger. He watched from the rafters of arenas, and did not speak his thoughts. Sting soon showed his opposition to the nWo, and challenged Hogan to a match for the title at Starrcade. In reality, Hogan and Eric Bischoff, the executive vice president of WCW, disagreed over the <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> the <b>match.</b> <b>This</b> resulted in a planned ending that had Sting lose because of a fast pinfall count by the referee. Bret Hart would restart the match, and Sting would win.|$|R

40|$|Queuing Theory is a {{mathematical}} formula {{that has been}} developed basically to determine the average waiting time spent in a specific line. In general, Queuing Theory has already been implemented widely in various types of industry such as food and beverages, health, and also {{for oil and gas}} industry. The main purpose of Service Estimation System is to predict the average service completion time for customers in MJ Motors Sdn. Bhd which is one of Honda authorized dealer in Malaysia. The problem is the customers who send their car and wait at the service center are not provided with the status of their cars especially during peak hours. It is related with the level of satisfaction among the customers {{which is one of the}} most crucial component in a business. To solve the problem faced by stakeholder, there are several objectives that have to be completed such as collect and analyze the business process and requirements, study and review on how to apply Queueing Theory, and design and develop the suggested system. The methodology used in completing this project is Waterfall model, and once each of the phases are finished, there are specific results delivered and objectives achieved.

Wastewater application in horticulture using hydroponics technology should minimise the exposure and contamination risk to the workers. Since the edible parts of the plant, {{with the exception of}} root crops, may not be in direct contact with the wastewater, contamination to the edible parts may also be reduced. This chapter examined two hydroponics systems, nutrient film technique and water culture (without aeration), for their efficiency in causing pathogen die-off. Three treatments, secondary treated domestic wastewater, control medium (commercial hydroponics medium) and pathogen spiked control medium were tested in triplicate. S. typhimurium (ATCCI 4028) and E. coli (WACC 4) were used to spike one of the treatments (spiked control medium). The experiment was conducted over four months with the medium changed every fortnight. The results showed that there was a general decrease of pathogens over seven days (> 40...|$|R
