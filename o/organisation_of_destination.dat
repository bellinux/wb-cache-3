40|$|This {{research}} aims to gain {{an insight}} into the experiences of African women refugees and asylum seekers, {{in order to provide}} an in-depth perspective of their experiences since arriving in the UK. Purposeful sampling was used to recruit 5 participants in a northern town in the UK; this means participants were selected due to their specific characteristics to fit in with the study design. The main criteria for the subjects of the study were that they are African women refugees or asylum seekers, aged 21 and above. Participants were recruited through a drop-in centre in a northern town in the UK and were interviewed in the English Language, using semi-structured interviews in order to generate in-depth information. The interviews were hand written as the women in the study did not consent to tape recording as originally planned. However, this allowed a deeper flow of information, and I was able to immerse myself in the interview contexts and gained a robust understanding of the responses. Thematic analysis was the most appropriate method for analysis. Major interpretation from this study revealed themes of restricted access to state welfare provisions as well as employment restrictions. The study further reveals other themes such as, communication difficulties, racism, uncertainties, powerlessness, segregation and isolation, provision of help through voluntary <b>organisations,</b> choice <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> and finally theme of peace and safety. The themes in this study reflect existing academic literature on asylum seekers. However, this research added to the existing body of knowledge by exploring how women who participated in the study felt about the UK. They believed it is more peaceful and secure than where they have come from. They also believe that the UK is a good choice <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> based on the justice and welfare system, also because their countries were colonised by the UK. The main limitation of this study was that the samples were small and not representative of all African women refugees and asylum seekers in the UK. Therefore, recommendations are made for a larger scale project that will gather information from more refugees and asylum seeking women. This research should look for examples of lack of social and economic engagement within the environment and the community. It should compare the experiences of asylum seekers and refugees {{in different parts of the}} UK in order to ascertain the impact of current dispersal policy on asylum seekers in the UK. Moreover, studies that examine the long-term effects of the entire asylum processes on health and well-being of asylum seekers in the UK are also deemed important. Finally, recommendations are made that Social Workers who work with these groups of people should endeavour to work in an anti-discriminatory way and try as much as possible to offer emotional support in form of counselling services for these groups of individuals...|$|R

40|$|During {{the past}} three decades the process <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> image {{formation}} occurred as a significant part in tourism research. Although many researchers have greatly contributed to this important research field, still several aspects <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> image are not well understood and require attention. Level <b>of</b> satisfaction, <b>destination</b> choice decision-making process, after-decision-making behaviours, intention to revisit and willingness to recommend are indisputably dependent on destination image. This paper looks at the concept <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> image and the instruments <b>of</b> measuring <b>destination</b> image. In particular, the process <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> image formation and the factors that shape the destination image is highlighted. Afterwards, a short review of the ECC Event and a literature review of the methodologies existing in the literature regarding measurement <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> image are presented. Finally, the research methodology that will be implemented in the measurement of the image improvement of Linz during the ECC Event in 2009 is shortly described. The rationale for undertaking this study is to provoke discussions whether the successful measurement <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> image requires the implementation of both qualitative and quantitative approaches, wherein the qualitative approach precedes the quantitative method. Moreover, the combination of structured and unstructured methods presents a unique opportunity to analyse the multidimensional character <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> image.

The {{bachelor}} thesis {{focuses on the}} meaning <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> management and creation <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> packages in tourism. In theoretical part are defined concepts which are connected to destination management (destination identity, destination and so on). Other components of the theoretical part are segmentation and marketing strategy which consist of marketing mix. Basic marketing mix refers to the process <b>of</b> creating a <b>destination</b> product, types <b>of</b> communication strategies, price planning and distribution. Marketing mix <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> is extended by partnership cooperation, packages, programming and people. The practical part is focused on application of theoretical knowledge into practice. This part is consisting of delimitation <b>of</b> selected <b>destination</b> and its analysis. Basic information about Eden centre, recent situation and analysis of its services. Based on the determined information and SWOT analysis is designed a strategy which consists <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> products proposal containing as a main attraction the services of the Eden centre to enhance the attractiveness <b>of</b> Vysočina <b>destination</b> and Bystřicko micro-region.

40|$|Many {{next-generation}} distributed applications, such as grid computing, {{require a}} single source {{to communicate with}} a group <b>of</b> <b>destinations.</b> Traditionally, such applications are implemented using multicast communication. A typical multicast session requires creating the shortest-path tree to a fixed number <b>of</b> <b>destinations.</b> The fundamental issue in multicasting data to a fixed set <b>of</b> <b>destinations</b> is receiver blocking. If one <b>of</b> the <b>destinations</b> is not reachable, the entire multicast request (say, grid task request) may fail. Manycasting is a generalized variation of multicasting that provides {{the freedom to choose}} the best subset <b>of</b> <b>destinations</b> from a larger set <b>of</b> candidate <b>destinations.</b> We propose an impairment-aware algorithm to provide manycasting service in the optical layer, specifically OBS. We compare the performance of our proposed manycasting algorithm with traditional multicasting and multicast with over provisioning.

This paper investigates cash flow as a tax base. A business cash flow tax abolishes current accrual accounting and {{has the potential to}} block international profit shifting. Financing vanishes to become a tax-planning tool because the investments’ market return is tax free under a cash flow tax.

40|$|In {{traditional}} community type <b>of</b> <b>destinations,</b> {{destination management}} organizations (DMOs) provide local services for visitors and fulfill destination marketing functions. On the demand side, they focus their activities on image and reputation building, product bundling and sales and distribution management. On {{the supply side}} {{they are involved in}} various functions like information services, coordination among the tourist SME 2 ̆ 7 s, infrastructure operation or support as well as destination planning functions. Traditionally these local DMOs, often to be found in mature tourist destinations, are organized as more or less public administrations and authorities or as public-private-partnerships, mostly covering the territory and being responsible for services in one or more municipalities. As traditional community type <b>of</b> <b>destinations</b> have to compete with company type <b>of</b> <b>destinations</b> like resorts, theme parks or even cruise boats, the respective DMOs have to transform themselves into modern, market oriented service centers. The current challenges require a critical budget and product-oriented regions, with a rather centralized marketing and management. Therefore, the reach and boundaries <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> areas must be evaluated and in many cases redefined. With the aim of deepening the understanding <b>of</b> <b>destinations</b> economics and delivering a structure for analyzing and organizing destination functions, this paper analyses the criteria for defining the boundaries <b>of</b> <b>destinations</b> and consequently budgets for the respective DMOs by looking at the case of the Swiss canton of Grisons.
