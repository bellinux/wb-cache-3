The <b>ovarioles</b> of queens ready to mate (6 to 8 days old) have, already one or two ovarian follicles, i. e. a very short proximal vitellarium, but a real vitellogenesis only starts after the fecundation. If the queen does not mate the <b>ovarioles</b> structure is disrupted (12 - 16 days old). In mated queen eggs the <b>ovarioles</b> present three differentiated regions, from the apice to the basis: a short terminal filament, a medium size germarium, and a very long basal vitellarium.

5000|$|In Drosophila melanogaster, the GSC niche {{resides in}} the anterior-most region of each <b>ovariole,</b> known as the germarium.

The GSC niche holds on average 2-3 GSCs, which are directly attached to somatic cap cells and Escort stem cells, which send maintenance signals directly to the GSCs. [...] GSCs are easily identified through histological staining against vasa protein (to identify germ cells) and 1B1 protein (to outline cell structures and a germline specific fusome structure). Their physical attachment to the cap cells is necessary for their maintenance and activity. A GSC will divide asymmetrically to produce one daughter cystoblast, which then undergoes 4 rounds of incomplete mitosis as it progresses down the <b>ovariole</b> (through the process of oogenesis) eventually emerging as a mature egg chamber; the fusome found in the GSCs functions in cyst formation and may regulate asymmetrical cell divisions of the GSCs.

Analysis was performed on the <b>ovarioles</b> in the ovaries of 25 females. Materials and Methods: Periodical collections were carried out at localities close to the river Sava: Plesmo (XL 41) and Spačva (CQ 39) in June, July and August 1995. Horse flies were put in 4 % formalin solution. In the laboratory female specimens were dissected in 0. 9 % water solution of NaCl. After dissection ovaries were removed and preserved in 4 % formalin solution. Ovaries were then processed through a standard dehydration series of ethanol solutions, cleared in benzene solutions and embedded in paraffin. Sections were cut at 5 micrometers with the Reichert – Jung rotary microtome. The slices were stained following standard staining procedures. Results and Conclusions: The follicles of the <b>ovarioles</b> were mostly in stage I and II of maturation, proving that blood meal is essential for egg maturation.

Although Rhodnius <b>ovarioles</b> possess exaggerated morphological and electrical polarity between nurse cells and oocytes, {{little is known}} about H + changes during oogenesis, despite the regulatory role played by H + and pH in many relevant cellular processes. A number of dynamic extracellular H + fluxes were measured along Rhodnius <b>ovarioles,</b> representing an oogenesis cycle, using a non-invasive, self-referencing, H +-selective probe. The interfollicular stalk separating adjacent follicles exhibited prominent H + efflux that peaked during midvitellogenesis and declined during late vitellogenesis. H + efflux in this region preceded stalk formation and, importantly, Summary preceded the onset of vitellogenesis in the adjacent posterior follicle. H + efflux was also observed over the terminal follicle, where specialized regions of the chorion were forming, and was still detected around follicle cells after ovulation, indicating that the somatic follicular epithelium produced this flux. Transmembrane H + fluxes may drive intracellular pH changes or may stabilize pHi in response to pH-altering events.

In the queen library, 48 % of the gene set represented homologs of known Drosophila genes, whereas in the worker ovary, the largest set (59 %) were ESTs evidencing novel genes, not even computationally predicted in the honey bee genome. Differential expression was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR for a selected gene set, denoting major differences for two queen and two worker library genes. These included two unpredicted genes located in chromosome 11 (Group 11. 35 and Group 11. 31, respectively) possibly representing long non-coding RNAs.

We detected micrometastases in 15. 8 % of <b>ovarioles</b> from wild type host females 12  days after transplanting lgl tumor cells into their abdominal cavities.

50|$|Drosophila C {{virus was}} first {{discovered}} in the early 1970s in a French strain of Drosophila melanogaster, but can also infect other Drosophila species in laboratory settings.

However, experimental evidence has shown that when injected into adult flies the virus is pathogenic as it causes the adult flies to die within 3-4 days. Antiviral RNAi {{has been shown to}} be an important host defence against DCV, and DCV encodes a viral suppressor of RNAi that sequesters double-stranded RNA to prevent antiviral RNAi targeting the virus. Drosophila that are infected with Drosophila C virus develop more quickly, the females have a greater number of ovarioles than uninfected flies. Whilst based on this evidence it has been suggested DCV is a beneficial virus, this ignores the fact that the virus kills flies in only a few days (so total fitness in infected flies is still reduced), and any changes in development time or <b>ovariole</b> number likely represent a host life history shift (parasite-induced fecundity compensation).

40|$|All insect ovaries are {{composed}} of functional units called ovarioles, which contain sequentially developing egg chambers. The number of ovarioles varies between and within species. <b>Ovariole</b> number is an important determinant of fecundity and thus affects individual fitness. Although Drosophila oogenesis has been inten-sively studied, the genetic and cellular basis for determination of <b>ovariole</b> number remains unknown. Ovar-iole formation begins during larval development with the morphogenesis of terminal filament cells (TFCs) into stacks called terminal filaments (TFs). We induced changes in <b>ovariole</b> number in Drosophila melanogaster by genetically altering cell size and cell number in the TFC population, and analyzed TF morphogenesis in these ovaries to understand the cellular basis for the changes in <b>ovariole</b> number. Increasing TFC size contributed to higher <b>ovariole</b> number by increasing TF number. Similarly, increasing total TFC number led to higher <b>ovariole</b> number via an increase in TF number. By analyzing ovarian morphogenesis in another Drosophila species we showed that TFC number regulation is a target of evolutionary change that affects <b>ovariole</b> number. In contrast, temperature-dependent plasticity in <b>ovariole</b> numberwas due to changes in cell–cell sorting during TFmorpho-genesis, rather than changes in cell size or cell number.
