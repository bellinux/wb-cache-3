Active Surfaces support mobile interactions and dynamic configuration of assemblies of tiles. Each tile represents an interactive unit, able to communicate with <b>other</b> <b>tiles</b> <b>and</b> to exchange data. The tiles can be assembled on a physical and logical service level to support activities of different complexity. This creates technical challenges where assemblies are re-created over time between devices with limited input and output capabilities.

50|$|It is also {{possible}} to protect porous building materials, such as brick, <b>tiles,</b> concrete <b>and</b> <b>paving</b> against efflorescence by treating the material with an impregnating, hydro-phobic sealer.

However, in climates where freezing is a concern, such a sealer may lead to damage from freeze/thaw cycles.

40|$|An ink, {{comprising}} the redox dye resazurin (Rz) and the sacrificial electron donor glycerol, {{is shown to}} be capable of the rapid assessment of the photocatalytic activities of self-cleaning films. In the key initial stage of photocatalysis the ink changes from blue to pink. Prolonged irradiation bleaches the ink and eventually mineralizes it. The kinetics of the initial photoinduced color change is studied as a function of UV irradiance, [glycerol], [Rz], and temperature. The results reveal an apparent approximate quantum yield of 3. 5 × 10 - 3 and an initial rate, ri, which increases with [glycerol] and decreases with [Rz]. It is proposed that the reduction of Rz, dispersed throughout the thick (ca. 590 nm) indicator film, may take place either via the diffusion of the dye molecules in the ink film {{to the surface of the}} underlying semiconductor layer and their subsequent reaction with photogenerated electrons and/or via the diffusion of α-hydroxyalkyl radicals, produced by the oxidation of the glycerol by photogenerated holes, or hydroxy radicals, away from the surface of the semiconductor into the ink film and their subsequent reaction with the dye molecules therein. The decrease in ri with [Rz] appears to be due to dimer formation, with the latter impeding the reduction process. The activation energy for the initial color-change process is low, ca. 9. 1 ± 0. 1 kJ mol- 1 and not unlike many other photocatalytic processes. The initial rate of dye reduction appears to be directly related to the rate of destruction of stearic acid. The ink can be applied by spin-coating, stamping, or writing, using a felt-tip pen. The efficacy of such an ink for assessing the photocatalytic activity of any photocatalytic film, including those employed on commercial self-cleaning glasses, <b>tiles,</b> <b>and</b> <b>paving</b> stones, is discussed briefly...|$|R
5000|$|The {{miniature}} {{building has}} been identified variously as a palace-style building and as a temple [...] "golden hall" [...] or kondō. It has a hip-and-gable roof in the style known as irimoya-zukuri, or more precisely {{a variant of the}} type, known as shikorobuki (錏葺). In this technique, the hip and gable are clearly distinguished, with the latter overhanging the notably flat former and there is a distinct break in the tiling. When Shitennō-ji was rebuilt after its destruction in the Pacific War, the roofing of the kondō retained this ancient style. Ornamenting both ends of the ridgepole that runs the length of the top of the roof are curved tiles known as shibi, found in surviving eighth-century architecture only on the Tōshōdai-ji kondō. The roof tiles are of the lipless, semi-circular type. In the triangular field at each gable end is a [...] "king-post", supporting the end of the ridgepole. Descending the length of the gable and perpendicular to the main ridgepole are kudarimune (extra=or descending ridges). Edging the gable beyond the descending ridges are [...] "hanging tiles" [...] or kakegawara (掛瓦), laid at right angles to both the <b>other</b> <b>tiles</b> <b>and</b> the descending ridges and projecting slightly to afford a degree of shelter (were this building not a miniature) to the bargeboards that help define the gable.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} has showed that tile systems {{are one of}} the most suitable theoretical frameworks for the spatial study and modeling of self-assembly processes, such as the formation of DNA and protein oligomeric structures. A Wang tile is a unit square, with glues on its edges, attaching to <b>other</b> <b>tiles</b> <b>and</b> forming larger and larger structures. Although quite intuitive, the idea of glues placed on the edges of a tile is not always natural for simulating the interactions occurring in some real systems. For example, when considering protein self-assembly, the shape of a protein is the main determinant of its functions and its interactions with other proteins. Our goal is to use geometric tiles, i. e. square tiles with geometrical protrusions on their edges, for simulating tiled paths (zippers) with complex neighborhoods, by ribbons of geometric tiles with simple, local neighborhoods. This paper is a step toward solving the general case of an arbitrary neighborhood, by proposing geometric tile designs that solve the case of a 2 ̆ 2 tall 2 ̆ 2 von Neumann neighborhood, the case of the f-shaped neighborhood, and the case of a 3 x 5 2 ̆ 2 filled 2 ̆ 2 rectangular neighborhood. The techniques can be combined and generalized to solve the problem in the case of any neighborhood, centered at the <b>tile</b> of reference, <b>and</b> included in a 3 x (2 k+ 1) rectangle...|$|R

The stages of this study is the first to define the stage, explained the object of study selection, identify the type of defect, and the flowchart of the production process. While on stage measure, determine the product attributes that are critical to the quality of CTQ (Critical To Quality), measuring the level of defects in the form of DPMO and sigma level that will be the foundation of early performance. Furthermore, the stage of analyzing the types of defects analyze the main pedestal in improving the quality problem and what factors are the cause of defects by using a fishbone diagram. And improve on the stage, using failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) to assist in determining the corrective action plan that can be implemented to reduce defect levels. The last stage is the control, which document the repairs and make control charts to track and monitor the production process. The survey results revealed that the most dominant defect occurred in the company was broken at the edges, and the hook is not perfect. The corrective actions taken to improve stages, namely the procedural flow of clear and structured activities in the socialization process of soaking through the standard operating procedure (SOP) to workers and provide directions arrangement of tiles on a soaking tub. So the mechanism of production procedures run smoothly and causes defects that occur can be minimized...|$|R
