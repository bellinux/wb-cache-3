50|$|Nicked DNA can be {{the result}} of DNA damage or {{purposeful}} and carefully regulated biomolecular reactions carried out in the cell. DNA can be nicked by physical shearing, over-drying or enzymes. Excessive rough handling happening in pipetting or vortexing creates the physical stress that can lead to breaks and nicks in DNA. <b>Overdrying</b> of DNA can also break the phosphodiester bond in DNA and result in nicks. Enzyme Nicking endonucleases can assist with this process A single-stranded break (nick) in DNA can be formed by the hydrolysis and subsequent removal of a phosphate group within the helical backbone. This leads to a different DNA conformation, where a hydrogen bond forms in place of the missing piece of the DNA backbone in order to preserve the structure.|$|E

40|$|The {{first stage}} of this {{investigation}} involved two years of field tests in three 5. 5 -m diameter drying bins, two of which were equipped with single-auger grain stirrers. The first year, 24 % moisture (wet basis) corn was dried using 3. 7 - to 5. 2 -kW fans. One bin was unstirred and another was stirred 48 h per week. The third bin was stirred at bin filling, when average moisture reached 20 %, and again when average moisture fell below 15. 5 %. Both stirred bins used less energy and had less <b>overdrying</b> than the unstirred bin, with least energy use in the bin stirred three times;In the second field test, 20 % moisture corn was dried. One bin was unstirred {{and the other two}} were stirred {{at the beginning and end}} of drying. The 3. 7 - to 5. 2 -kW fan on one stirred bin was replaced with a 2. 2 -kW model. Again, the stirred bins used less energy and had less <b>overdrying.</b> The stirred bin with the small fan used the least Oil, Gas, and Energy;The initial stirring was found to decrease bulk density and airflow resistance and greatly increase airflow. Subsequent stirring had unpredictable effects on bulk density and generally increased airflow resistance. Stirring shifted fines toward the drying floors and produced a small quantity of fines;In the second stage of the investigation, field test results were used to modify and calibrate a computer model to simulate natural-air stir drying. It was found that airflow had to be reduced to 74 % of the input value and only 57. 5 % of the input electrical power could be used to calculate air temperature rise or the model would overpredict drying. Simulated natural-air drying of 20 and 24 % moisture corn harvested mid-October in central Iowa showed that stirring reduced required fan size, electric-energy use, and overdrying;In the final stage, an economic analysis was conducted using corn physical properties from the field studies, average energy use and <b>overdrying</b> from the simulations, and local equipment and operating costs. The analysis showed that stirring increased net revenues for natural-air drying of 24 % moisture corn and did for 20 % moisture corn when electricity prices were high...|$|E

Presentation of monozygotic twins with identical hair structure disturbances typical for pili torti and multiple facial milia and review of syndromes and diseases with pili torti and/or milia, with particular reference to Bazex-Dupre-Christol syndrome. Case report. Three-year-old monozygotic twins with identical disturbances of the hair, which was dry, brittle, torn and showed in microscopic examination features typical for pili torti – twisting of the hair shaft by 180 °.

40|$|The family Poxviridae {{consists}} of large double-stranded DNA containing viruses that replicate {{exclusively in the}} cytoplasm of infected cells. Members of the orthopox genus include variola, the causative agent of human small pox, monkeypox, and vaccinia (VAC), the prototypic member of the virus family. Within the relatively large (~ 200 kb) vaccinia genome, three classes of genes are encoded: early, intermediate, and late. While all three classes are transcribed by virally-encoded RNA polymerases, each class serves a different function in {{the life cycle of}} the virus. Poxviruses utilize multiple strategies for modulation of the host cellular environment during infection. In order to understand regulation of both host and virus gene expression, we have utilized genome-wide approaches to analyze transcript abundance from both virus and host cells. Here, we demonstrate time course infections of HeLa cells with Vaccinia virus and sampling RNA at several time points post-infection. Both host and viral total RNA is isolated and amplified for hybridization to microarrays for analysis of gene expression. Protocol Part 1 : aRNA labeling: amino allyl coupling of the dyes 1.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{frequently}} mentioned problems in relation to processing beetle-killed wood in the British Columbia Interior is that of kiln drying charges consisting of both green and partly dried stock. This results from the fact that dead beetle-killed stems are currently harvested and processed along with green stems from the same stands. The losses, or additional costs, associated with the current procedures include the following: 1. extra cost to kiln dry already dry wood, 2. excessive degrade in the already dry stock, and 3. increased planer breakage due to <b>overdry</b> wood, and related planer production delays. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine some possible alternatives available for dealing with this problem, the equip-ment changes required, the advantages and disadvantages of the alternatives and some related considerations. This is done within the framework of a series of studies designed to evaluate the economic merits of the alternatives. PROPOSAL In order to reduce the losses referred to above, it is proposed that the dry beetle-killed wood and green normal wood be segregated and the lumber dried separately. MILL TYPE The type of operation examined in the following alternatives is a typical British Columbian Interior spruce-pine-fir (S-P-F) dimension mill producing 2 x 4 to 2 x 10 in lengths from 8 to 20 feet, requiring 28 basic length and width sorts. SORTING ALTERNATIVES Four basic alternatives for sorting have been identified: 1. No change (control) : continue to run mixed dry and green stock throughout the operation; 2. Sort in woods: segregate dead (red top or older) from live stems as early as possible during harvesting. Haul them separately to the mill and store them separately in the yard; 3. Double the sorts: this alternative requires doubling the number of sorts in a typical bin sorter, and adding an in-line moisture meter to identify and separate the dry from the green pieces...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{increasing}} interest has been {{centered on the}} biochemistry and physiology of the skin surface, in particular, its potential for resisting physical, chemical, and microbiologic challenges. Morphologically, the skin surface is composed of the stratum corneum, sweat and sebaceous gland ducts, and hair follicles that open onto the surface through pores.

40|$|The natural {{conditions}} within the food zone of Łódź urban administrative province are rather unfavourable for intensive agricultural production. The restricting elements include, first of all, the Iow precipitation sum {{especially at the}} time of intensive growth of plants, and too high share of soils with low bonitation classes poorly equipped with nutritive components and subject to <b>overdrying.</b> This accounts for a relatively big intensification of rye-and-potato crops giving on the average lower yields than the national average. This is best noticeable in southem regions of the zone. The northern part of the food zone has the most favourable index of agricultural effectiveness. That is due to, a suitable character of the land sculpture (mainly plains or small elevations) and soils of wheat complexes appearing here. Despite relatively low indexes, the {{natural conditions}} in the examined area do not reistrict develapment of crops production. At present they are utilized to an average degree.

40|$|Several imaging {{techniques}} {{are used for}} material inspection such as X-ray radiography, ultrasound imaging or 'normal' image acquisition {{in the range of}} visible light. Thermography uses cameras and sensors for the range of 'therma' infrared radiation delivering thermal images which represent the radiation density emitted from a surface. A surface of a homogeneous solid body cooling down from a state of homogeneous temperature shows homogeneous thermal images. Any inhomogeneities in density, moisture content, thermal conductivity, surface properties or also internal delaminations etc. have an influence on the local heat flux. They appear in the thermal images as cold spots, hot spots or as a pattern corresponding to internal structures. If the samples come homogeneously heated from an industrial process then "passive" thermographic inspection can be performed. Examples are · board products leaving a coating press - detection of foil coating defects · particle streams leaving a dryer - detection of <b>overdried</b> particles for fire protection · raw particle boards - monitoring the density distribution "Active" thermography means that the samples receive a heat pulse before passing the IR camera. This heat pulse may be short (from flashlights) or long (from an IR line source or using hot steam or heating plates) {{but it has to be}} more or less homogeneous. The heat flux from the warm surface goes into the depth of the material as well as (by radiation and convection) to the surrounding. Especially delaminations can be detected like e. g. · Bonding defects in laminate floor panels of composite products made from several layers · Internal defects in structural parts like rotor blades of wind power plants Thermography is an imaging technique and can be used for a quick overview as well as for deeper inspections where several other techniques do no work for certain reasons. Cameras available today are so sensitive that even small temperature differences in the range of 15 mK can be detected. A specific evaluation technique is pulse phase thermography (PPT) : An images series of the cooling phase is acquired so that the intensity as a function of time is obtained for every pixel. The image series is then transferred from the time domain to the frequency domain by pixelwise Fourier transformation. In such a way the contributions from objects in different depths of the material to the surface temperature pattern can be distinguished. WKI has gathered experiences with thermographic material inspection since approx. 10 years. Together with the Research Institute of Leather and Plastic Sheeting (FILK), Freiberg, and the Society for the Promotion of Applied Computer Science (GFaI), Berlin, WKI works in a research project with the objective to develop methods to localize hidden defects in natural materials. Leather and wood may show growth features which are not all visible from the surface and where inspection techniques using infrared radiation and visible light can be combined. Especially for leather it is important to detect defects at the beginning of the value added chain to reject defective material. Therefore, initial investigations were focussed on leather in the "wet " state. Leather samples in different states (raw; wet blue; wet blue but dried; crust) were investigated with active thermography using several methods: · Excitation of stationary samples with a short thermal pulse from a flashlight, · excitation of the samples moving on a conveyor with a continuous line IR source (quartz or carbon lamp), · contact heating with hot plates in a laboratory press. Leather has good thermal insulation properties. Therefore, the surface temperatures of the samples after excitation are in the range of 30 °C L 80 °C, and the cooling periods to be observed are 10 s [...] 100 s, depending on the method of excitation and the sample properties. Thermal image series were acquired using a high-performance or a medium-performance infrared camera and evaluated with the software "FTS Viewer" developed by WKI. Thermal images of wet-blue or dry leather samples acquired during the cooling period show hidden structures which are scarcely or not at all visible by the eye. Depending on the method of excitation, structures closer to the surface (using a flash light) or deeper in the cross section (using a continuous IR source or contact heating) are reflected in the thermal images, but also folds and borders due to the angle of incidence of the thermal radiation. More excitation techniques (contact heating in press devices, steaming) have been tested, new results will be reported in the presentation. For moist leather better results cannot be expected because thermal equilibrium is reached very soon after excitation and therefore no contrasts caused by material anomalies appear in thermal images. For dry leather products, however, the conditions are much better. Further investigations are scheduled for finished products. More findings regarding on-line measurements in a later project phase can be expected if the detection results are correlated with visual defect...|$|R
40|$|The {{climate change}} {{simulation}} community {{is moving toward}} use of global cloud resolving models (CRMs), however, current computational resources are not sufficient to run global CRMs over the hundreds of years necessary to produce climate change estimates. As an intermediate step between conventional general circulation models (GCMs) and global CRMs, many climate analysis centers are embedding a CRM in each grid cell of a conventional GCM. These Multiscale Modeling Frameworks (MMFs) represent a theoretical advance {{over the use of}} conventional GCM cloud and convection parameterizations, but have been shown to exhibit an overproduction of precipitation in the tropics during the northern hemisphere summer. In this study, simulations of clouds, precipitation, and radiation over the South China Sea using the CRM component of the NASA Goddard MMF are evaluated using retrievals derived from the instruments aboard the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite platform for a 46 -day time period that spans 5 May - 20 June 1998. The NASA Goddard Cumulus Ensemble (GCE) model is forced with observed largescale forcing derived from soundings taken during the intensive observing period of the South China Sea Monsoon Experiment. It is found that the GCE configuration used in the NASA Goddard MMF responds too vigorously to the imposed large-scale forcing, accumulating too much moisture and producing too much cloud cover during convective phases, and <b>overdrying</b> the atmosphere and suppressing clouds during monsoon break periods. Sensitivity experiments reveal that changes to ice cloud microphysical parameters have a relatively large effect on simulated clouds, precipitation, and radiation, while changes to grid spacing and domain length have little effect on simulation results. The results motivate a more detailed and quantitative exploration of the sources and magnitude of the uncertainty associated with specified cloud microphysical parameters in the CRM components of MMFs...|$|E
40|$|Natural air (NA), {{in-bin drying}} and storage of rough rice {{generally}} maintains high grain quality, but the associated slow movement and occasional stagnation of the drying front {{during the process}} may result in problems of rice quality reduction, mold growth, and mycotoxin development, especially for rough rice in the top layers of the bin. Using modeling techniques to simulate in-bin rough rice drying in typically-encountered field scenarios may provide a tool for rapidly predicting the grain condition as drying progresses. The objectives {{for this study were}} to (1) investigate accurate models for predicting equilibrium moisture content (EMC) of rough rice at set conditions of air temperature and relative humidity (RH), (2) develop and validate a mathematical model for predicting moisture content (MC) and temperature profiles of rough rice during NA, in-bin drying, and (3) perform computer simulations using the developed mathematical model to determine the impacts of drying strategy (rough rice initial MC, drying-start date, air flowrate, and fan control strategy) on rough rice drying duration, maximum dry matter loss, and percent <b>overdrying.</b> In order to accomplish objective (1), adsorption and desorption isotherms of long-grain hybrid rough rice at temperatures ranging from 15 °C to 35 °C and RHs of 10 % to 90 % were determined by using a Dynamic Vapor Sorption analysis device. Non-linear fitting techniques were used to determine constants of models for predicting rough rice adsorption or desorption EMCs. It was determined that the modified Halsey and modified Chung-Pfost equations were the best models to describe rough rice adsorption and desorption isotherms, respectively (RMSEs = 0. 54 % MC in dry basis and 0. 91 % MC in dry basis, respectively). To achieve objective (2), Post-Harvest Aeration Simulation Tool - Finite Difference Method, developed by Bartosik and Maier (2004), was modified for rice and used to simulate in-bin rough rice drying in Arkansas. Simulation results were validated by field experiments, which used modern, on-farm bins equipped with “cabling and sensing technology” for in-bin RH and rough rice temperature measurement; the rough rice MC was calculated based on the measured RH and temperature data. The sensor-determined data and simulation results of MC and temperature were compared. The simulation results described well the general trends of rough rice MC and temperature profiles (for MC, mean RMSE = 0. 56 % MC in wet basis; for temperature, mean RMSE = 1. 77 °C). The study validated the accuracy of the developed simulation model for prediction of in-bin drying and storage of rough rice. In order to accomplish objective (3), simulations of in-bin drying of rough rice with different drying strategies was performed. A twenty-year weather data set (1995 to 2014) of ambient air temperature and RH of the U. S. Mid-South rice growing locations (Jonesboro, West Memphis, and Stuttgart, Arkansas, and Greenville and Tunica, Mississippi) were procured. Drying simulations were performed using air flowrates 0. 55, 1. 10, 1. 65, and 2. 20 m^ 3 min-t^- 1, drying-start dates of 15 August, 15 September, and 15 October, and rough rice initial MCs of 16 % to 22 % (wet basis). Fan control strategies comprised running the drying fan continuously, at set window of natural air equilibrium moisture content, and air EMC window with supplemental heating option. Results showed that rough rice drying duration, dry matter loss, and percent <b>overdrying</b> were dependent on selected drying strategy with fan control strategy, initial rough rice MC, and air flowrate being key factors. Information generated using the simulations could guide rice producers, especially in selected U. S. Mid-South, to effectively dry rough rice in a timely manner, and mitigate problems of rice quality reduction, excessive mold growth, and mycotoxin contamination...|$|E
40|$|Some of {{the most}} widely grown public corn (Zea mays L.) inbreds were tested for {{tolerance}} to dryer induced injury. Inbred parent B 37 was grown in 1979, and A 632, B 73, and Mo 17 were grown in 1979 and 1980. The single cross H 99 x H 95 was used as a pollinator both years. Random ear samples were then collected, to obtain ears with moisture percentages ranging from approximately 50 to 20 %, and dried to 12 % moisture at 35, 40, 45, and 50 C;Maternal parent A 632 showed the most tolerance to high drying temperatures while both B 73 and Mo 17 proved to be relatively intolerant. In both years, however, anomalous declines in cold-test emergence were noted for A 632 when harvested at 30 to 35 % moisture and dried at 45 and 50 C. Based on only one year of data, B 37 was intermediate in tolerance. Combined analyses yielded significant inbred-parent by harvest-moisture by drying-temperature interactions for both germination and cold-test emergence percentages. Those interactions alone do not allow for simple recommendations of safe harvest moistures and drying temperatures. Specified components from the combined analyses were then used to predict values for seed quality parameters that would be useful to seed producers. Field performance of 1979 seed in 1980 was similar to that observed in laboratory tests;To elucidate the basic physiology of dryer-induced injury, other additional studies were undertaken. A preliminary comparison of drying rates among inbred parents A 632, B 73, and Mo 17 generally showed that A 632, the tolerant genotype, dried at the fastest rate in both the laboratory and the field. Results from seed that had been dried to approximately seven percent moisture indicated that <b>overdrying</b> at higher temperatures may have detrimental effects on seed quality. However, the performance of seed overdried at 35 or 40 C, and maintained in that state, was comparable to seed that had been dried to 12 % moisture.

III) An analysis of the causes of failure of the methods of Chorine and Knowles recorded in the literature for such purposes is given, as well as its adaptability for the simultaneous preparation of large numbers of samples. IV) The method is based the protective action of a previous fixation by a dilute solution of formalin, which, without preventing further dehemoglobinization, prevents morphological alterations in the parasites by the action of Knowles solution which is retained in this metod without modification. V) For washing out the acids of the dehemoglobinizating solution as well as for diluting the Giemsa stain, the A. proposes a very simple technique, extremely convenient for such purpose, which consists in adding acetic acid to the distilled water in the proportion of 1 drop for each 10 cc of water, and then increasing the hydrogeni-on concentration to pH 7. 2 with a 2 % sol. of sodium carbonate. As indicator a 0. 02 % solution purple-bromcresol prepared in accordante to Medalia, is used. In this reaction there is the formation of the acetic acid &# 8596; sodium acetate, buffer system very suitable for giving a convenient pH and for preventing the precipitation of the dye, which can be used for two or three batches of 700 or 800 slides each, without changing the staining solution. VI) – The method can be summarized as follow: For a small number of samples, Coplin’s or any other staining jar can be used. Large number of slides must be placed in groups of 10 or 15 units each, the slides being separated by a piece of cardboard, according to Barber & Komp.

The ranges of temperature and moisture content (MC) for the tests were 0 to 25 °C and 12 to 20 %. The main conclusion was that the three corn types investigated had different adsorption and desorption EMC relationships. These corn type specific relationships were incorporated into a new model-based fan and burner control strategy for the in-bin drying and conditioning of corn. This Self-Adapting Variable Heat (SAVH) strategy incorporated the Thompson equilibrium drying model to predict MC changes in different layers of the grain mass. The drying model allowed the SAVH control strategy to successfully identify wet or dry weather conditions and target a uniform final MC for the entire grain mass. ^ This SAVH control strategy was successfully implemented in three field experiments during the 2004 drying season. The Post-Harvest Aeration and Storage Simulation Tool–Finite Difference Method (PHAST-FDM) software was further refined and validated by comparing the observed MC values for four natural air/low temperature (NA/LT) in-bin drying experiments with the predicted MC values. ^ On the basis of a 40 -year analysis of weather data with respect to the performance of NA/LT in-bin drying systems, the Midwestern Corn Belt was divided into four regions. PHAST-FDM was used to study the performance of four NA/LT in-bin drying strategies for drying 20 % initial. ^ On the basis of a 40 -year analysis of weather data with respect to the performance of NA/LT in-bin drying systems, the Midwestern Corn Belt was divided into four regions. PHAST-FDM was used to study the performance of four NA/LT in-bin drying strategies for drying 20 % initial MC corn in 13 locations within these regions. The simulation results showed that the SAVH strategy outperformed the other strategies on the basis of drying costs (from 1. 1 to 9. 6 $/t lower drying cost), drying time, and relatively little <b>overdrying</b> of the grain bottom layer. The drying cost for the yellow dent corn type was always the lowest, followed by the white and then by the waxy corn types. ^ The fine material distribution in the grain mass and the air velocity through the core and periphery locations in the bin were quantified for 15 NA/LT in-bin drying field tests. The best management practices of leveling the grain peak after filling the bin and coring the grain mass were implemented, and the improvement on the airflow distribution was quantified. Simulation results showed that operators of NA/LT in-bin drying systems could reduce drying costs from 25 to 33 % by leveling the grain peak after loading the bin. An additional savings of 18 to 22 % could be achieved by installing effective grain (and fine material) distributors or by coring the grain mass. ...|$|E
