50|$|The {{control of}} a turbine with a {{governor}} is essential, as turbines need to be run up slowly to prevent damage and some applications (such as the generation of alternating current electricity) require precise speed control. Uncontrolled acceleration of the turbine rotor can lead to an <b>overspeed</b> <b>trip,</b> which causes the governor and throttle valves that control the flow of steam to the turbine to close. If these valves fail then the turbine may continue accelerating until it breaks apart, often catastrophically. Turbines are expensive to make, requiring precision manufacture and special quality materials.|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, {{managers}} {{in charge of}} every process plant are looking for areas where moderate changes in the process or equipment can yield a return of increased throughput and reliability. The approach employed for the ammonia plant discussed in this case study is to consolidate the diverse controls for major process compressors, steam turbine prime movers, and associated pressure reducing valves. By consolidating all these controls in a single triple modular redundant (TMR) control system, variations in the steam and process headers have been reduced significantly. A separate TMR ESD system was installed {{at the same time}} to reduce the risk of unsafe process operation and provide primary electronic <b>overspeed</b> <b>trip</b> to all the steam turbines...|$|R
5000|$|On 26 January, Thresher made {{radar contact}} with a small convoy and soon spotted two ships {{steaming}} along beneath the overcast night skies. At 00:11, Thresher fired three bow torpedoes at a 1,266-ton freighter, then bent cleared the area. Her [...] "fish" [...] scored a bullseye, and the quarry disappeared within a minute. A second spread, 35 seconds after the first, claimed a 2,205-ton freighter. A third target made off to the south at high speed, [...] "spraying the ocean with five-inch ammunition". Resuming the approach at 00:20, Thresher doggedly tailed the Japanese ship for four hours before reaching a favorable attack position. Firing her last torpedoes at 04:46, Thresher began to build up speed and had just commenced a turn when one torpedo struck the enemy ship, causing a tremendous explosion. The blast slowed the freighter, but its tremendous concussion stopped Thresher dead in the water. All four main engine <b>overspeed</b> <b>trips</b> were actuated; cork insulation flew; lights broke; clocks stopped; and water poured down the antenna trunk. By the time Thresher regained battle readiness, the enemy {{was too far away}} to encourage further pursuit. Well within the range of shore-based aircraft, Thresher quit the chase. Escorts, alerted to the fact an American submarine was prowling in the vicinity, arrived on the scene and conducted a three-hour-long, futile, depth-charging.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} {{to examine the relationship}} between time-dependent degradation and current industry practices in the areas of maintenance, surveillance, and operation of steam turbine drives for safety-related pumps. These pumps are located in the Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW) system for pressurized-water reactor plants and in the Reactor Core Isolation Cooling and High-Pressure Coolant Injection systems for boiling-water reactor plants. This research has been conducted by examination of failure data in the Nuclear Plant Reliability Data System, review of Licensee Event Reports, discussion of problems with operating plant personnel, and personal observation. The reported failure data were reviewed to determine the cause of the event and the method of discovery. Based on the research results, attempts have been made to determine the predictability of failures and possible preventive measures that may be implemented. Findings in a recent study of AFW systems indicate that the turbine drive is the single largest contributor to AFW system degradation. However, examination of the data shows that the turbine itself is a reliable piece of equipment with a good service record. Most of the problems documented are the result of problems with the turbine controls and the mechanical <b>overspeed</b> <b>trip</b> mechanism; these apparently stem from three major causes which are discussed in the text. Recent improvements in maintenance practices and procedures, combined with a stabilization of the design, have led to improved performance resulting in a reliable safety-related component. However, these improvements have not been universally implemented...|$|R
500|$|The {{system for}} remote {{handling}} of the samples had flaws; it took about six months to discover them all. The chemists, who operated on mixtures of fission products with batches reaching up to [...] each, were frequently exposed (accidentally) to undesirably high doses of radiation. The group handling the experiments themselves was less at risk; they operated in close coordination with the Health Group, {{who was in charge}} of ensuring that radiation exposure of the people involved was survivable. The radioactive contamination posed a problem. The people working in the Bayo Canyon had to change their clothes and take showers after the work. Sometimes they would still <b>trip</b> <b>detectors</b> at security gates.|$|R
2500|$|On July 7, 2005, BC Ferries {{concluded}} that a missing cotter pin was to blame. The pin normally retained a nut on a linkage between an engine speed governor and the fuel control {{for one of the}} engines. Without the pin, the nut fell off and the linkage separated, causing the engine, [...] clutches, and propellers to increase in speed until <b>overspeed</b> safety devices <b>tripped</b> and shut down the entire propulsion system. The faulty speed governor had been serviced 17 days before the incident during a $35-million upgrade, and the cotter pin had not been properly replaced at that time.|$|R
40|$|Trip hazards are a {{significant}} contributor to accidents on construction and manufacturing sites, where {{over a third of}} Australian workplace injuries occur [1]. Current safety inspections are labour intensive and limited by human fallibility, making automation of trip hazard detection appealing from both a safety and economic perspective. Trip hazards present an interesting challenge to modern learning techniques because they are defined as much by affordance as by object type; for example wires on a table are not a trip hazard, but can be if lying on the ground. To address these challenges, we conduct a comprehensive investigation into the performance characteristics of 11 different colour and depth fusion approaches, including 4 fusion and one non fusion approach; using colour and two types of depth images. Trained and tested on over 600 labelled trip hazards over 4 floors and 2000 m 2 in an active construction site, this approach was able to differentiate between identical objects in different physical configurations (see Figure 1). Outperforming a colour only <b>detector,</b> our multi-modal <b>trip</b> <b>detector</b> fuses colour and depth information to achieve a 4 % absolute improvement in F 1 -score. These investigative results and the extensive dataset which is now publicly available, moves us one step closer to assistive or fully automated safety inspection systems on construction sites...|$|R
50|$|Cross-zoning is a {{strategy}} that {{does not require a}} new keypad. Using multiple sensors to monitor activity in one area, software analyses input from all the sources. For example, if a motion <b>detector</b> <b>trips</b> in one area, the signal is recorded and the central-station monitor notifies the customer. A second alarm signal—received in an adjacent zone within a short time—is the confirmation the central-station monitor needs to request a dispatch immediately. This builds in increased protection and a fail safe should a door blow open or a bird rattle an exterior window.|$|R
40|$|While transiting the Brisbane River to Fisherman Islands, despite {{identifying}} {{and attempting to}} gain {{the attention of the}} yacht and then taking evasive action, contact was made between Valiant III and the yacht.

40|$|The {{multiplicity}} of interface elements {{in an automobile}} can present a hindrance to usability and safety. We prototyped and conducted preliminary testing of an automobile driving interface. Our key design principle was to enhance driver situational awareness while minimizing distractions. We aimed to accomplish this task by exploiting the benefits of an auditory display coupled with a minimized visual head up display (HUD). Results from our testing indicated that this approach could be an effective method of improving driver safety in hazardous situations. Keywords Automobile, auditory display, usability, head up display (HUD) INTRODUCTION Current automobile dashboards are becoming increasingly cluttered. Drivers must {{pay attention to the}} tachometer, speedometer, stereo, temperature controls, cellular phone, gas meter, and road signs. Additionally, onboard <b>trip</b> computers, radar <b>detectors,</b> and GPS tracking maps contribute to driver information overload. In tactical aircraft, this pro [...] ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{two methods}} to extract trips and stops from GPS traces: {{the first one}} focuses on periods of non-movement (stops) and the second one tries to identify the longest periods of movement (trips). In order to assert the quality of both methods, the results are compared to stops and trips identified by the traveler; this was done {{by means of a}} visual tool aimed at alignment of manually reported periods in the diary to automatically recorded GPS coordinates. Several quality indicators are presented; they have been evaluated using sensitivity analysis {{in order to determine the}} optimal values for the detector's configuration settings. Person traces (as opposed to car traces) were used. Individual specific behavior seems to have a large effect on the optimal values for threshold settings used in both the <b>trip</b> and stop <b>detector</b> algorithms. Accurate detection of stops and trips in GPS traces is vital to prompted recall surveys because those surveys can extend over several weeks. Inaccurate stop detection requires frequent corrections by the users and can cause them to quit...|$|R
