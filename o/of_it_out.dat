25|$|Channel 5 {{sold its}} half of Multiplex A {{to the owners}} of {{the other half of the}} multiplex, S4C, who set up a {{subsidiary}} called S4C Digital Networks (SDN) to manage the multiplex and rented most <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> to ONdigital as well as some space to the BBC who launched BBC Knowledge on 1 June 1999, at a time when technical capabilities limited the number of stations it could carry on its own multiplex. S4C chose not to carry S4C Digidol and its newly launched digital Welsh Assembly station, S4C2 outside Wales, preferring to sell the space instead. Consequently, some ONdigital services were not available on Welsh transmitters.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of 19 June, Yorktown {{aircraft}} began strikes on Japanese air bases on Guam in order to deny them to their approaching carrier-based air {{and to keep the}} land-based planes out of the fray. Duels with Guam-based aircraft continued until mid-morning. At about 10:17, however, she got her first indication of the carrier plane attacks when a large bogey appeared on her radar screen. At that point she divided her attention, sending part of her air group back to Guam and another portion <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> to meet the raid closing from the west. Throughout the battle, Yorktowns planes continued to strike the Guam airfields and intercept the carrier raids. During {{the first day of the}} Battle of the Philippine Sea, Yorktown aircraft claimed 37 enemy planes destroyed and dropped 21tons of bombs on the Guam air bases.|$|E

Motion City became part of a slew of Epitaph signings, including Matchbook Romance, Scatter the Ashes and From First To Last, amid concerns the Southern California label had strayed too far from its roots, and seemed [...] "a little too emo." [...] By the time the band began production on their sophomore record, I Am the Movie had sold nearly 62,000 copies. The group had accumulated significant buzz, and were regarded as a [...] "must-see" [...] act on the Warped Tour 2004.|$|E

I guess {{a part of}} me wanted to be truthful about what it is that really drives me, and maybe give back to the place that is nourishing me... I don't know what to say. When I read books or see films or listen to albums I want certain things. I want a heart—I'm very old school like that, I'm very emotional... I just didn't want anybody to know. I wanted it for myself. The lyric to 'Cocoon' was a whole diary, then I had to edit 90 per cent <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>out.</b> It's very hard to explain, but when I read it and the other person it's about reads it, we don't feel abused or anything. I think there's songs where I've been more... scruffy about what I'm expressing. I have a problem with music that's too indulgent. It's like 'Keep your own dirty laundry, please'".|$|E

40|$|Carve out {{projects}} have recently become an emerging issue {{in practice and}} theory given the diversity of strategic foci of companies as well as recent merger and acquisition activities. This paper highlights the relevance <b>of</b> <b>IT</b> in such carve <b>out</b> projects. <b>IT</b> depicts their characteristics and specific features with regard to general IT projects as well as success factors for the management <b>of</b> <b>IT</b> carve <b>outs.</b> Based on a systematic literature review, we conducted 18 exploratory expert interviews with different stakeholders involved in the management <b>of</b> <b>IT</b> carve <b>outs.</b> We show that the perception and acknowledgement <b>of</b> the <b>IT</b> function within the overall carve out project is broadly underestimated. We elaborate on learnings for the successful management <b>of</b> the <b>IT</b> function within a carve out project: the involvement <b>of</b> <b>IT</b> executives in the early phases of contract negotiations; improved IT due diligence processes for a better anticipation <b>of</b> <b>IT</b> costs; early analysis of the target enterprise architecture. Additionally, we identified success factors <b>of</b> managing <b>IT</b> carve <b>out</b> projects. This paper is {{among the first to}} shed light into the research field <b>of</b> <b>IT</b> carve <b>out</b> projects including exploratory empirical data and gives recommendations for future research <b>of</b> <b>IT</b> carve <b>outs...</b>|$|R

2500|$|In the {{tradition}} of Lull, Zwemer ‘left behind a mighty highway of print almost a book a year in English for over half a century.’ As part of this great literary undertaking, he settled in Cairo in 1912 {{to work with the}} Nile Mission Press to make it ‘a production point for Christian Literature for Muslims.’ As an outcome of the Edinburgh World Missionary Conference in 1910, he established the quarterly The Moslem World in 1911 because ‘If the Churches of Christendom are to reach the Moslem world with the Gospel, they must know of it and know it.’ He edited it until 1947, paying for much <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> of his own pocket. He founded the American Christian Literature Society for Moslems (A.C.L.S.M) which raised over {{a quarter of a million}} dollars for the production of evangelical literature. Its Constitution expressed Zwemer’s belief that the printed page ‘has a unique value as a means of carrying the Gospel to Mohammedans... finds an entrance into many doors closed to the living witness and can proclaim the Gospel persistently, fearlessly and effectively.’ Zwemer saw printed page as ‘the [...] "leaves for the healing of the nations" [...] in his program of mission strategy.’ ...|$|E
2500|$|Nobody's Daughter was {{released}} on April 26, 2010 worldwide on Mercury Records, and was received by music critics with moderately positive acclaim. Rolling Stone gave the album three out of five stars, but noted [...] " [...] was an absolute monster vocalist in the nineties, the greatest era ever for rock singers... She doesn't have that power in her lungs anymore – barely a trace. But at least she remembers, and that means something in itself." [...] The magazine also referred to the album as [...] "not a true success", but a [...] "noble effort". Love's voice, which had been noticeably raspier (likely due to years of scream-singing, drug abuse, and smoking) was compared {{to the likes of}} Bob Dylan. NME gave the album a 6/10 rating, and Robert Christgau rated it an [...] "A-", saying, [...] "Thing is, I can use some new punk rage in my life, and unless you're a fan of Goldman Sachs and BP Petroleum, so can you. What's more, better it come from a 45-year-old woman who knows how to throw her weight around than from the zitty newbies and tattooed road dogs who churn most <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> these days. I know—for her, BP Petroleum is just something else to pretend about. But the emotion fueling her pretense is cathartic nevertheless." [...] In support of the release, Hole toured extensively between 2010 and 2012 throughout North America and Europe, as well as performing in Japan, Russia, and Brazil.|$|E
