5000|$|Flowers of Hydnora triceps have chambers. The androecium {{consists}} of an antheral ring, leading down a tube, to a cushion-like stigma. The length of the sub-antheral chamber varies from 2 to 10 cm in length. In an immature flower, the antheral ring is open, and pollen develops on ridges along the outside. Then as it matures, the antheral ring closes, creating [...] "pollen platforms" [...] within. There is an <b>osmophore,</b> a scent producing structure, {{in the folds of}} each lobe which is heart shaped and white. The flower is rarely seen above ground, and if it is, only the very tip of it is seen protruding from the surface. Typically, it is found up to 5 cm below the surface, and can be found by the cracks in the soil above it.|$|E

40|$|Flowers of Myosotis scorpioides L. (Boraginaceae) are pollinated by {{different}} insects, among others by the honey bee. They produce both secondary attractants (colour, odour) and primary attractants which include nectar and pollen. The nectary glands {{occurring in the}} flowers form a ring surrounding {{the base of a}} superior ovary. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the anatomical characteristics and ultrastructure of the nectary and odour-producing tissues located on the petals. The study was carried out using light, scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The nectary forms a uniform ring surrounding a 4 -loculed superior ovary. Nectar is secreted through stomata. The presence of large cell nuclei, numerous plastids and rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) was found in the ultrastructure of the nectary cells. In the parenchyma cells of the nectary, ER was fused to large cisterns (vesicles) situated in the marginal parts of the cytoplasm. This study shows that essential oils are emitted through papillae located in the adaxial epidermis of the petals and through large palisade epidermal cells occurring in the yellow region of the corolla, which form the <b>osmophore</b> tissue. The epidermal cells of the <b>osmophore</b> were characterized by the presence of thin cell walls, large nuclei and numerous chromoplasts. Lipid plastoglobules were observed in the chromoplasts; their presence can be associated with the production of essential oils. It was found that the tissues forming the yellow ring at the mouth to the corolla tube (<b>osmophore)</b> released a more intense scent than the surface region of the petal on which the papillae occur...|$|E

The <b>osmophores</b> situated at the top part of spadix (appendix), secreted a strong fragrance during the whole period of blooming, whereas those located on the stamens, in the apical {{and in the middle}} part of the spatha produced a weaker smell. The fragrance at the basis of spatha was undetectable although both the secretion and the tissue structure characteristic for <b>osmophores</b> located on the adaxial surface of the remaining part of the spatha were observed. The gland tissue consisted of the epidermis and of several layers of subepidermal parenchyma. The epidermis was covered by a thin, striated cuticle or sticks of wax. Moreover, there was also a small number of stomata covered with a smooth cuticle. The cells of <b>osmophores</b> stained intensively with neutral red. They contained numerous lipid drops, which presumably are carriers of the secreted fragrance substances. The cells of subepidermal layers were filled up with starch grains in the appendix and stamens. A considerable quantity of starch was also observed in the deeper layers of parenchyma in the spatha. The pattern of <b>osmophores</b> distribution corresponds with the localization of these inflorescence fragments, which emit heat, as showed in the literature...|$|R

40|$|The {{structure}} of the osmophores in Stanhopea graveolens and Cycnoches chlorochilon was studied by means of light microscopy (LM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The scent glands {{are located in the}} basal part of the labellum. The surface of the osmophores is wrinkled or rugose, which increases the area of fragrance emission. On the surface of the epidermis, remnants of secretion are noticeable in S. graveolens, but these are absent in C. chlorochilon. The <b>osmophore</b> tissue is composed of secretory epidermal cells and several layers of subepidermal parenchyma, and it is supplied by vascular bundles that run in ground parenchyma. The secretory cells have large nuclei, a dense cytoplasm with numerous ER profiles, lipid droplets, and plastids with a substantial amount of starch, which are probably involved in the synthesis of volatile substances. In the cell walls of the <b>osmophore</b> cells, numerous pits with plasmodesmata occur that are likely to take part in symplastic transport of the scent compounds. The {{structure of}} the osmophores is similar in both investigated species.

40|$|Tese de doutoramento, Biologia (Biologia Celular), Universidade de Lisboa, Faculdade de Ciências, 2016 The {{study of}} the {{micromorphology}} of flowers is crucial to understand the complex process of pollination and the intimate interaction between flowers and pollinators. This plant‐pollinator interaction is a key factor to the diversification and evolution of angiosperms and is particularly tight in species pollinated by sexual deception, almost all of which belonging to the orchid family. The highly specific pollination system of the sexually deceptive species {{is based on a}} precise mimicry of the visual, tactile and chemical signals exhibited by the females of the pollinator species (usually a single or a few related insect species), thereby attracting males, which, in most cases, perform copulatory attempts with the flower leading to pollination. In the Euro‐Mediterranean sexually deceptive orchid genus Ophrys, most research has been focused on the chemical mimicry between certain components of the odour bouquet emitted by the flowers and the female sex pheromone of their specific insect pollinators. In most cases, these compounds were shown to be mainly long‐chained hydrocarbons, which are found in the cuticular waxes spread over the surface of the strongly modified median petal typical of orchid flowers – the labellum. However, numerous compounds of higher volatility were shown to act as long‐range attractants for male pollinators, although their site of synthesis and emission (presumably an <b>osmophore)</b> remains unknown. Likewise, {{little is known about the}} micromorphological features of the labellum and their importance in providing visual and tactile signals for pollinator attraction. In the present thesis, we investigated the location, structure and secretion of the <b>osmophore</b> and the labellum micromorphology and anatomy of flowers, at three developmental stages, of six closely related Ophrys taxa from natural populations occurring in Portugal, using scanning electron microscopy, light microscopy and histochemistry. We demonstrated the occurrence of an <b>osmophore,</b> which synthesizes a terpene‐rich lipophilic secretion, in the apical region of the labellum in the investigated Ophrys taxa, located mainly at the labellum margin and/or in an apical appendix exhibited by some species. A great diversity of epidermal cell types was found in the adaxial surface of the labellum, which form well‐defined areas with distinct visual and tactile properties. The detailed comparative analysis of these different areas allowed us to establish potential homologies between the labellum areas of the studied taxa. The Ophrys <b>osmophore</b> probably plays an important role in pollination, by synthesizing highly volatile long‐range pollinator attractants, which are possibly complementary to the cuticular waxes spread over the labellum surface for the success of pollination by sexual deception. Findings of the micromorphological and anatomical study were used to build a morphoanatomical data matrix, using objective criteria, as a basis for a morphological phylogenetic analysis of the unresolved clade of Ophrys formed by the six studied taxa, using maximumparsimony and Bayesian inference. Our phylogenetic hypothesis rejects an earlier morphological hypothesis and favours the existing molecular phylogenetic trees based on nuclear ITS data rather than plastid data. Furthermore, the present analysis brought some insights into the floral trait evolutionary trends in Ophrys orchids.

40|$|Flowers {{of sexually}} {{deceptive}} taxa generally possess {{a set of}} morphological and physiological characters that mimic their insect pollinators. These characters often include a specific insect-like floral configuration, together with scent glands <b>osmophores)</b> that produce fragrances which chemically resemble insect sex pheromones. Furthermore, these flowers tend not to produce pollinator food rewards. According to some authors, flowers of the Australian bladderwort Utricularia dunlopii (and species of the Utricularia capilliflora complex) resemble insects, and pollination perhaps occurs by pseudocopulation. The aims of this paper are to compare the structure and distribution of floral glandular trichomes in the Australian carnivorous plant U. dunlopii with those of closely related species assigned to the same section and to discuss their putative function. Floral tissues of U. dunlopii P. Taylor, Utricularia paulinae Lowrie, Utricularia dichotoma Labill. and Utricularia uniflora R. Br. (section Pleiochasia) were investigated using light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and histochemistry. In U. dunlopii, two long, erect, filiform appendages arising from the upper lip of the corolla, together with three arising from the lower lip, bear numerous glandular trichomes that may function as <b>osmophores.</b> In other species, such as U. uniflora and U. paulinae, glandular papillae on the corolla palate may also function as <b>osmophores.</b> The floral anatomical and morphological organisation of U. dunlopii {{differs from that of}} the other investigated species, indicating that its insect pollinators are also likely to differ.

40|$|Background and Aims: Floral {{thermogenesis}} {{occurs in}} at least 12 families of ancient seed plants. Some species show very high rates of respiration through the alternative pathway, and some are thermoregulatory, with increasing respiration at decreasing ambient temperature. This study assesses the intensity and regulation of respiration in three species of African Hydnora that represent the Hydnoraceae, an unusual family of holoparasitic plants from arid environments. Methods: Long-term respirometry (CO 2 production) and thermometry were carried out on intact flowers of H. africana, H. abyssinica and H. esculenta in the field, and short-term measurements were made on floral parts during the protogynous flowering sequence. Key Results: For H. africana, there was no temperature elevation in either the osmophores or the gynoecial chamber in any phase, and mass-specific respiration rates of the flower parts were low (maximum 8 · 3 nmol CO 2 g– 1 s– 1 in <b>osmophore</b> tissue). Respiration tracked ambient and floral temperatures, eliminating {{the possibility of the}} inverse relationship expected in thermoregulatory flowers. Hydnora abyssinica flowers had higher respiration (maximum 27 · 5 nmol g– 1 s– 1 in the osmophores) and a slight elevation of <b>osmophore</b> temperature (maximum 2 · 8 °C) in the female stage. Respiration by gynoecial tissue was similar to that of osmophores in both species, but there was no measurable elevation of gynoecial chamber temperature. Gynoecial chamber temperature of H. esculenta could reach 3 · 8 °C above ambient, but there are no respiration data available. Antheral tissue respiration was maximal in the male phase (4 · 8 nmol g– 1 s– 1 in H. africana and 10 · 3 nmol g– 1 s– 1 in H. abyssinica), but it did not raise the antheral ring temperature, which showed that thermogenesis is not a by-product of pollen maturation or release. Conclusions: The exceptionally low thermogenesis in Hydnora appears to be associated with scent production and possibly gynoecial development, but has little direct benefit to beetle pollinators.

40|$|Restrepia {{is a small}} Pleurothallid genus, {{comprising}} 57 species, 44 {{of which}} were discovered since 1970. These species are indigenous to Central and South America, where their montane forest habitats are under increasing pressure from changes in land use. With resulting increasingly fragmented habitats and dwindling numbers, the pollination systems of obligate out-breeding genera, such as Restrepia, may no longer function efficiently which could potentially lead to their extinction. As such, the main aim {{of the current study}} was to perform an in-depth investigation of floral structures in the genus, using SEM and photographic technology to formulate a putative pollination mechanism for these species. The floral micromorphology of dorsal sepal and lateral petal osmophores, synsepal, labellum, cirrhi and calli were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), macro-photography and quantitative analyses of some floral proportions. The secretory nature of the labellum, synsepal and <b>osmophore</b> papillae were established and the calli were shown to possess a unique papillate, non-secretory structure. A pollination mechanism for the genus was proposed which includes the role of the scent trails produced by the osmophores and the ‘trapping’ role of the cirrhi. A ‘functional fit’ between the flower and the pollinator is suggested. In conclusion, we consider Restrepia to represent a non-nectar rewarding and ‘deceptive’ orchid genus and that this pollination mechanism may be directly linked to the breeding system (gametophytic self-incompatibility) in this genus...|$|E
40|$|Utricularia cornigera and Utricularia nelumbifolia are giant, aquatic-epiphytic {{species of}} {{carnivorous}} bladderwort from southeastern Brazil that {{grow in the}} central ‘urns’ of bromeliads.

Floral palates of U. cornigera and U. nelumbifolia provide clear visual signals for pollinating insects. In both species, the palate possesses diverse micro-morphology, comprising unicellular, conical to villiform papillae and multicellular, uniseriate, glandular trichomes that frequently display terminal branching. The most characteristic ultrastructural feature of these papillae was the presence of relatively large, polymorphic plastids (chromoplasts) containing many plastoglobuli. Similar plastids are known {{to occur in the}} fragrance-producing (<b>osmophores)</b> and oil-producing (elaiophores) tissues of several orchid species. Thus, these palate papillae may {{play a key role in}} providing the olfactory stimulus for the attraction of insect pollinators. Nectariferous trichomes were observed in the floral spurs of both species, and in U. nelumbifolia, free nectar was also recorded. The location, micro-morphology, anatomy and ultrastructure of the floral palate of the two species investigated may thus indicate that the palate functions as an unguentarius.

40|$|We elucidated scent components, daily {{emission}} patterns, and the localization of floral scent {{release of}} Mirabilis jalapa. Volatiles emitted {{by the whole}} plant {{as well as by}} detached flowers were investigated using dynamic headspace analysis and gas chromatography/ mass spectrometry. Among several constituents including (Z) - 3 -hexenyl acetate, β-myrcene, (Z) -ocimene, and benzyl benzoate, the monoterpene (E) -β-ocimene was the major fragrance component. Fragrance release occurred in a time-dependent manner. The emission of volatiles, including (E) -β-ocimene, showed an evening-specific maximum (1700 - 2000 pm). The emission of (Z) - 3 -hexenyl acetate reached its maximum 3 h later. Histological (neutral red staining) and morphological studies (electron and light microscopy) of the flower surface and tissues of M. jalapa revealed differences in surface structures and tissue characteristics. The flower could be divided into four main sections, including the tube, the transition zone between tube and limb, a star-shaped center of the limb, and petaloid lobes of the limb. These petaloid lobes are the site of (E) -β-ocimene release. Stomata and trichomes found on the abaxial flower surface were not directly involved in fragrance release. Clear indications of <b>osmophores</b> involved in scent release could not be found. Thus, the results indicate that floral volatiles probably are released by diffuse emission in M. jalapa...|$|R
40|$|CSIRO 2009 Orchids of {{the genus}} Caladenia {{have been shown to}} utilise two quite {{different}} pollination strategies, namely species-specific sexual deception of thynnine wasps and a more generalist strategy attracting a larger spectrum of foraging insects. While baiting techniques have enabled the identification of numerous pollinators of sexually deceptive Caladenia, insects that pollinate food-advertising species have received little attention. The present study employed a multidisciplinary approach to better evaluate the pollination syndrome of the white spider orchid, Caladenia rigida R. S. Rogers, a species previously reported to utilise both food and sexual deception. This included the observation and capture of potential pollinators of C. rigida through direct observation, pantraps, Malaise traps and pollinator-baiting experiments, and the use of molecular techniques to identify orchid pollinia isolated from carrier insects. We describe a suite of generalist insects visiting and bearing pollinia from C. rigida. In addition, samples collected from the labellum and column of C. rigida contained sugars at levels comparable to those of a known nectar-producing orchid, Microtis parviflora R. Br. Potential <b>osmophores</b> in the clubs and calli stained positively with neutral red and although this character is often associated with sexual deception, we found no evidence for this secondary pollination syndrome in C. rigida. The present study is the first one to provide {{a detailed description of the}} pollinators and pollination syndrome of a non-sexually deceptive species within the genus Caladenia and the first report to provide evidence of nectar production by a species within this genus.

40|$|The {{structure}} of the flowers of Galanthus nivalis shows adaptations to early spring flowering conditions as well as adaptations to entomogamy. The tepals produce colour marks and odorous substances. The aim {{of the present study}} was to determine the micromorphology and anatomy of tepals, in particular in the regions comprising colour marks which, in accordance with the literature data, emit essential oils. Examination was performed using light, fluorescence, and scanning electron microscopy. Large protrusions, corresponding to the location of the green stripes, were found to occur on the adaxial surface of the inner tepals. The epidermal cells in this part of the tepals produce a cuticle with characteristic ornamentation as well as numerous stomata with well-developed outer cuticular ledges. The wide opening of many stomata is evidence of high activity in this area. The fluorescence microscopy images confirm the high activity of the epidermis (scent emission), on both sides of the tepals, as well as of the chloroplast- containing mesophyll. In the abaxial epidermis, there were observed different-sized papillae that also participated in essential oil secretion. The polarization of the epidermal cell protoplasts, large cell nuclei, and the presence of large vacuoles with heterogeneous contents in the peripheral part of the cells correspond to the structural features of the tissues emitting odorous compounds in flowers - <b>osmophores.</b> In freshly opened flowers, the mesophyll of the central part of the perianth segments was composed of several cell layers, whereas in older flowers large air ducts formed, which are adaptations to environmental thermal conditions...|$|R
40|$|An {{essential}} oil (EO) is defined internationally {{as the product}} obtained by hydrodistillation, of a plant or some parts of it. They are aromatic oily liquids, volatile, characterized by a strong odour, rarely coloured, and generally with a lower density than that of water. They can be synthesized by all plant organs (flowers, buds, seeds, leaves, twigs, bark, herbs, wood, fruits and roots) and therefore extracted from these parts, where they are stored in secretory cells, cavities, ducts, epidermal cells, <b>osmophores</b> or glandular trichomes. EOs have a complex composition. The great majority of components identified in EOs include monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. Nevertheless, phenylpropanoids are also important components of some {{essential oil}}s. EOs extracted from Thymbra capitata and Helichrysum italicum collected in Algarve (Portugal) were investigated for their antitumor activity, specifically looking at effect on viability of human colorectal cancer (RKO) and breast cancer (MCF 7) cells using MTS assay. The serial doubling dilution of the essential oil was prepared in DMSO. Both EOs tested, at final concentration 1 µL/mL and dilution 1 : 10, lead to a decrease in cell viability for both RKO (colorectal) and MCF 7 (breast) cancer cell lines. Specifically, average IC 50 values were 2. 82 E- 03 µL/mL and 1. 08 E- 02 µL/mL for T. capitata and 1. 03 E- 01 µL/mL and 1. 30 E+ 01 µL/mL for H. italicum (IC 50 s for RKO and MCF 7 cell lines, respectively). It has long been recognised that some EOs have antimicrobial, antibacterial, antioxidant, antiviral, antimycotic, antiparasitic, insecticidal activities. However, studies into their anti-tumoral activities are scarce. This study, indicates that Thymbra capitata and Helichrysum italicum EOs exhibited antitumor activity against RKO and MCF 7 cells, deserving further research into both the mechanism of the observed anti-tumour activity and potential cancer therapeutic applications...|$|R
40|$|A thesis {{presented}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of PhilosophyThe genus Restrepia is well known to orchid enthusiasts but its micromorphology has not been described, and its pollination and breeding systems have not been investigated. The aim of this investigation was, therefore, to add to existing knowledge so that the resultant data {{could be used to}} facilitate ex situ conservation initiatives. A detailed electron microscopy study (SEM) of the floral organs was performed. This confirmed the structure of the dorsal sepal and lateral petal <b>osmophores,</b> their secretory nature together with that of the synsepal and the labellum. It was postulated how, by manipulating different labellar surface textures, the flower might use these ‘tactile guides’ to steer the insect (fly) through the flower. The cirrhi were postulated to help by destabilising the pollinator in flight, trapping it and bringing about pollination. The papillate structure of the calli was established and their optical properties investigated. Media comparison investigations established that Western medium supported the highest germination rates and, with the addition of banana supplement, the highest rates for seedling growth and development. This represented the first protocol for axenic germination of Restrepia in the literature (Millner et al., 2008) and provided a tested methodology for investigating breeding systems and producing Restrepia plant material for both scientific and horticultural purposes. Self-pollinations were found to produce fewer embryos compared to cross-pollinations. The operation of self-incompatibility (SI) was confirmed by the study of pollen tube growth which further confirmed the time interval between pollination and fertilisation. A time line from pollination/fertilisation to flowering was established. The type of SI in operation was best explained by gametophytic incompatibility. This demonstrated {{that it was possible to}} raise Restrepia hybrids and species from seed, by performing intraspecific crosses so helping to preserve them for posterity and relieve pressure on wild populations. Narrow endemic Restrepia species face combined threats from habitat loss, habitat degradation and problems of viable seed production due to the effects of SI and inbreeding depression (ID). Recently developed online resources, such as GeoCAT, were used to perform a Red List assessment in order to identify the degree of threat individual species faced, both globally and nationally. All species were classified as facing substantial levels of threat; although this was lessened for populations in protected habitats. Conservation is needed for cultivated collections as well as these wild populations by keeping alive existing knowledge and expertise in growing these species...|$|R
40|$|Em Mimosoideae (Leguminosae), glândulas em anteras são estruturas de destaque, pois ocorrem em muitos de seus representantes e provêm caracteres com valor taxonômico no clado. O conhecimento a respeito destas glândulas era baseado principalmente em observações de morfologia externa, faltando dados a respeito de sua anatomia, ontogenia, seu funcionamento e seus aspectos evolutivos, o que contribuiria para uma caracterização mais detalhada e uma classificação mais natural dessas estruturas, além da inferência de funções ecológicas mais objetivas. Assim, {{o objetivo do estudo}} foi revisitar a estrutura das glândulas nas anteras, {{investigar}} sua origem meristemática e o seu desenvolvimento, acompanhar seu funcionamento, inferir funções ecológicas e, então, reconstruir sua evolução em Mimosoideae. Para contemplar os objetivos propostos, o presente estudo investigou aspectos das glândulas em anteras em 25 espécies de Mimosoideae, que representam grupos com divergências mais antigas e recentes no clado. Foram encontrados quatro tipos principais de glândulas: (1) O tipo Piptadenia, caracterizado por uma glândula pedunculada com ápice esférico e que inclui três subtipos: Piptadenia, com ápice composto de células isodiamétricas; Adenanthera, com ápice composto de uma camada de células epidérmicas alongadas que delimitam células isodiamétricas; e Entada, com ápice composto de uma camada de células epidérmicas volumosas que delimitam um lúmen. (2) O tipo Pentaclethra, uma glândula robusta composta de uma camada de células epidérmicas em paliçada e células centrais isodiamétricas, com pedúnculo vascularizado. (3) O tipo Prosopis africana, uma glândula robusta, séssil e vascularizada. (4) Finalmente o tipo Gagnebina, uma glândula acuminada com células alongadas. Apesar da diversidade morfológica, as glândulas de anteras compartilham uma origem meristemática comum. Elas surgem de divisões simultâneas nas primeiras três camadas de células meristemáticas que cobrem a porção apical da antera jovem, sendo classificadas como emergências. Os tipos de glândulas podem apresentar diferenças quanto a: (1) estrutura na pré-antese e antese; (2) longevidade; (3) aspecto e composição química do exsudato e (4) forma de liberação do exsudato. Baseados na caracterização e forma de liberação do exsudato, e no comportamento dos visitantes florais, nossos dados apontam que as glândulas atuam principalmente (a) na produção de substâncias que atuam na adesão do pólen ao corpo do polinizador ou à antera e (b) na produção de fragrância floral atuando como osmóforos. A presença de glândulas em anteras parece ter uma origem única em Mimosoideae, com alguns eventos de perda. O estado ancestral da estrutura das glândulas provavelmente corresponde ao tipo Piptadenia subtipo Adenanthera. Ainda, parece existir uma relação positiva entre ausência de glândulas e a presença de inflorescências de eixo curto, de estames numerosos e de estames unidos. Nossos dados indicam que em Mimosoideae, as glândulas em anteras são caracteres com potencial significado filogenético. A origem meristemática conservada das glândulas além da origem única da presença de glândulas em anteras Mimosoideae favorece a hipótese de homologia dessas estruturas e apoia a monofilia do clado. In Mimosoideae (Leguminosae), anther glands {{are prominent}} structures because they occur in many taxa and provide characters with taxonomic {{value in the}} clade. The knowledge about the anther glands was mainly based on external morphological observations, lacking data concerning the anatomy, ontogeny, function and evolutionary aspects of the glands, which would contribute to a more detailed characterization and a more natural classification of these structures, as well as the inference of more objective ecological functions. The aims of this study were to revisit the structure of the anther glands, to investigate their meristematic origin, and their developmental stages, their functioning mechanisms, to infer ecological functions, and thus reconstruct the evolutionary history of these glands in Mimosoideae. For this, the present study investigated several aspects of the anther glands in 25 species of Mimosoideae representing groups with early and late divergences in the clade. We found four major types of glands in anther Mimosoideae: (1) Piptadenia type, characterized by a stalked gland with a spherical apex, and that includes three subtypes: Piptadenia, with the apex composed of isodiametrical cells; Adenanthera, with the apex composed a layer of elongated epidermal cells which delimits isodiametric cells; and Entada with the apex composed of a layer of epidermal bulky cells delimiting a lumen. (2) Pentaclethra type,a robust gland comprised of a layer of epidermal and palisade cells isodiametric central cells with vascularized peduncle. (3) The Prosopis africana type, a robust sessile and vascularized gland. (4) Finally, the Gagnebina type, an acuminate gland with elongated cells. Despite the morphological diversity, the anthers glands share a common meristematic origin. They arise from simultaneous divisions in the first three layers of meristematic cells covering the apical portion of the young anther, being classified as emergences. The types of glands may differ as to: (1) structure in the pre-anthesis and anthesis; (2) longevity; (3) aspect and chemical composition of exudate and (4) release form of exudate. Considering the characterization and release form of exudate, and behavior of floral visitors, our data show that the glands act mainly (a) in the production of substances that act on the accession of pollen to the bee body or anther and (b) in production of floral fragrance acting as <b>osmophores.</b> The presence of anther glands appears to have a single origin in Mimosoideae, with some loss events. The ancestral state {{of the structure of the}} glands probably corresponds to the type Piptadenia subtype Adenanthera. Still, there seems to be a negative relation between the presence of the glands, the presence of inflorescences with short axis, numerous stamens and united stamens. Our data indicate that in Mimosoideae, the glands in anthers provide characters with potential phylogenetic significance. The conserved meristematic origin of the anther glands beyond the single evolutionary origin of the presence of glands in anthers favor the hypothesis of homology of these structures and support the monophyly of Mimosoideae...|$|R

Defesa: Curitiba, 15 / 12 / 2016 Inclui referências : f. 32 - 34; 55 : 56; 66 : 68; 76 - 81 Resumo: Acianthera é formado por aproximadamente 291 espécies de plantas epífitas e litófitas, sendo bem representado no Brasil, onde ocorrem 125 espécies. Em 1986, Acianthera e Pleurobotryum passaram a ser considerados subgêneros de Pleurothallis. Estudos moleculares apontaram que Pleurothallis não era um grupo monofilético, e Acianthera passou a ser circunscrito novamente como gênero de Pleurothallidinae. Após recente revisão taxonômica baseada em dados moleculares, Acianthera foi subdividido em dez seções, dentre elas Acianthera seção Pleurobotryae, que engloba as espécies anteriormente pertencentes ao gênero Pleurobotryum. Acianthera seção Pleurobotryae é formada por quatro espécies: A. atropurpurea, A. crepiniana, A. hatschbachii e A. mantiquyrana. Seus representantes apresentam alto grau de diferenciação morfológica, podendo apresentar cauloma ereto, subereto ou pendente, folhas compressas lateralmente ou cilíndricas. Assim, estudos anatômicos dos representantes da seção podem facilitar a caracterização de seus membros, bem como colaborar na compreensão das relações filogenéticas do gênero. Amostras de raízes, ramicaules e folhas de 15 espécies, representantes de oito das dez seções de Acianthera, foram analisadas em microscopia eletrônica de varredura e microscopia de luz. Os estudos anatômicos de órgãos vegetativos e micromorfológicos florais revelaram caracteres anatômicos sinapomórficos para os representantes de A. seção Pleurobotryae: a presença de folhas unifaciais circulares ou elípticas em secção transversal, folhas circulares com feixes {{vascular}}es organizados em círculos concêntricos e mesofilo formado por 28 a 30 camadas de células. Verificamos ainda que as folhas elípticas presentes em A. crepiniana surgiram a partir das folhas circulares presentes nas demais espécies de A. seção Pleurobotryae. Em Acianthera foram observados tricomas radiculares simples e espiralados que se originam na camada mais externa do velame e permanecem na raiz mesmo após o seu completo desenvolvimento. Estes tricomas radiculares atuam na adesão da planta ao substrato e na captação de água e nutrientes. A anatomia floral das espécies de A. seção Pleurobotryae e de outras espécies analisadas, indica que as pétalas reduzidas destas espécies apresentam um feixe vascular colateral, enquanto que as sépalas e o labelo apresentam três feixes vasculares. Em todos os representantes de A. seção Pleurobotryae, a base e o sulco central do labelo apresentaram células com características de nectários. As sépalas e o labelo de todas as espécies analisadas apresentaram células papilosas e tricomas que podem atuar na emissão de odores. As sépalas apresentam poros estomáticos que possivelmente atuam na liberação de odores e o labelo apresenta diferentes tipos de ornamentações na cutícula, além de poros e rupturas, por onde pode ocorrer a liberação de frangrâncias. A presença de tecidos produtores de néctar no labelo das espécies de A. seção Pleurobotryae, é uma característica floral compartilhada entre os representantes desta seção, pois as demais espécies analisadas não apresentaram esta característica. Assim, as espécies de A. seção Pleurobotryae podem atrair os polinizadores pela emissão de odores e recompensá-los produzindo néctar, enquanto que as demais espécies analisadas podem atrair os polinizadores pela emissão de odores e não oferecer recompensas florais.

Abstract: Acianthera {{is formed}} by approximately 291 species of epiphytic and lithophyte plants, in Brazil there are 125 species. In 1986 Acianthera and Pleurobotryum {{came to be}} considered subgenus of Pleurothallis, but molecular studies pointed out that Pleurothallis was not a monophyletic group and Acianthera was again circumscribed as a genus of Pleurothallidinae. After recent taxonomic revision based on molecular data, Acianthera was subdivided into ten sections, among them Acianthera sect. Pleurobotryae that encompasses the species previously belonging to the genus Pleurobotryum. Acianthera sect. Pleurobotryae is formed by four species: A. atropurpurea, A. crepiniana, A. hatschbachii e A. mantiquyrana. Its representatives present {{a high degree of}} morphological differentiation, being able to present erect, subereto or pendent ramicaul, lateral or cylindrical compressive leaves. Thus, anatomical studies of the representatives of the section can facilitate the characterization of its members, as well as collaborate in the understanding of the phylogenetic relationships of the genus. Roots, ramicauls and leaves of 15 species representative of eight of the ten sections of Acianthera were analyzed in Scanning electron microscopy and light microscopy. The study of the vegetative anatomy and floral micromorphology revealed unique anatomical characters for the representatives of A. sect. Pleurobotryae: unifacial leaves, circular or elliptical leaves in cross-section, circular leaves with organized vascular bundles in concentric circles and mesophyll formed by 28 to 30 layers of cells. We also verified that the elliptic leaves present in A. crepiniana appeared from the circular leaves present in the other species of A. sect. Pleurobotryae. In Acianthera, simple and spiraled root trichomes originate in the outermost layer of the velamen and remain in the root even after their complete development. These root trichomes act in the adhesion of the plant to the substrate as well as the water and nutrient uptake. The floral anatomy of the species of A. sect. Pleurobotryae and other species analyzed indicates that the reduced petals of these species present a collateral vascular bundle, whereas the sepals and the lip have three vascular bundles. In all the representatives of the A. sect. Pleurobotryae, the base and the central groove of the lip had cells with nectary characteristics. The sepals and the lip of all the analyzed species presented papillary cells and trichomes that can act in the emission of odors. The sepals have stomatal pores that may act on the release of odors and the lip presents different types of ornaments in the cuticle, as well as pores and ruptures, where the release of frangrances may occur. The presence of nectar-producing tissues in the lip of A. sect Pleurobotryae is a floral characteristic shared by representatives of this section, since the other species analyzed did not present this characteristic. Thus, the species of A. sect. Pleurobotryae can attract pollinators by the emission of odors and reward them producing nectar, While the other species analyzed can attract pollinators by the emission of odors and do not offer floral rewards.
