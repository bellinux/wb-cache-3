5|$|Bahá'u'lláh {{stated that}} he was a {{messenger}} <b>of</b> <b>God,</b> and he used the term Manifestation <b>of</b> <b>God</b> to define the concept of an intermediary between humanity and God. In the Bahá'í writings, the Manifestations <b>of</b> <b>God</b> are a series of interrelated personages who speak with a divine voice and who reflect the attributes of the divine into the human world for the progress and advancement of human morals and civilization. The Manifestations <b>of</b> <b>God,</b> as explained by Bahá'u'lláh, are not incarnations <b>of</b> <b>God,</b> but have a two-fold station; one which is the divine in that they reveal God's attributes, but not God's essence, and one which is human in that they represent the physical qualities of common man, and have human limitations. Bahá'u'lláh wrote that God will never manifest his essence into the world.|$|E

5|$|In {{the twentieth}} century, Ian Ramsey {{developed}} {{the theory of}} analogy, a development later cited in numerous works by Alister McGrath. He argued that various models <b>of</b> <b>God</b> are provided in religious writings that interact with each other: a range of analogies for salvation and the nature <b>of</b> <b>God.</b> Ramsey proposed that the models used modify and qualify each other, defining the limits of other analogies. As a result, no one analogy on its own is sufficient, but the combination of every analogy presented in Scripture gives a full and consistent depiction <b>of</b> <b>God.</b> The use of other analogies may then {{be used to determine}} if any one model <b>of</b> <b>God</b> is abused or improperly applied.|$|E

An early doctrinal controversy led to a split between Trinitarian and Oneness Pentecostals, the latter founded the Pentecostal Assemblies of the World in 1916.|$|E

5|$|Thomas Aquinas, while proposing five proofs of God's {{existence}} in his Summa Theologica, objected to Anselm's argument. He suggested that people cannot know the nature <b>of</b> <b>God</b> and, therefore, cannot conceive <b>of</b> <b>God</b> {{in the way}} Anselm proposed. The ontological argument would be meaningful only to someone who understands the essence <b>of</b> <b>God</b> completely. Aquinas reasoned that, as only God can completely know His essence, only He could use the argument. His rejection of the ontological argument caused other Catholic theologians to also reject the argument.|$|E
5|$|William Lane Craig criticised Oppy's {{study as}} too vague for useful classification. Craig argued that an {{argument}} can be classified as ontological if it attempts to deduce the existence <b>of</b> <b>God,</b> along with other necessary truths, from his definition. He suggested that proponents of ontological arguments would claim that, if one fully understood the concept <b>of</b> <b>God,</b> one must accept his existence. William L.
