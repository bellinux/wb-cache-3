40|$|To {{maximize}} {{crop productivity}} fertilizer P is generally applied to arable soils, {{a significant proportion}} of which becomes stabilized by mineral components and in part subsequently becomes unavailable to plants. However, {{little is known about the}} relative contributions of the different organic and inorganic P bound to Fe/Al oxides in the smaller soil particles. Alkaline (NaOH–Na 2 EDTA) extraction with solution 31 P-nuclear magnetic resonance (31 P-NMR) spectroscopy is considered a reliable method for extracting and quantifying organic P and (some) inorganic P. However, any so-called residual P after the alkaline extraction has remained unidentified. Therefore, in the present study, the amorphous (a) and crystalline (c) Fe/Al oxide minerals and related P in soil aggregate-sized fractions (> 20, 2 – 20, 0. 45 – 2 and < 0. 45 μm) were specifically extracted by <b>oxalate</b> (a-Fe/Al <b>oxides)</b> and dithionite–citrate–bicarbonate (DCB, both a- and c-Fe/Al oxides).

Micro-Raman spectrometry offers the advantage of spatial chemical characterization of the stone, based upon its molecular makeup and was performed on the bulk body of the stone.

40|$|Heterogeneous {{photodegradation}} of Linuron under UV irradiation was investigated. Natural {{iron oxide}} (NIO) {{was used in}} this study, {{to take a closer look}} at its adsorption capacity in the dark. The results obtained showed that the substrate photolysis is very slowly in artificial light (λ = 365 nm). However, the introduction of oxalic acid (Ox) in the system improves the degradation process greatly. The dependence of Linuron degradation was attributed to the formation of the dissolved Fe-Ox in the solution and the adsorbed Fe-Ox on the surface of natural iron oxide. The effect of different parameters such as the oxalate concentration, pH and initial concentration of NIO on the photodegradation were studied in the iron oxide/ oxalate system. The results demonstrated that the optimal pH should be in the range of 2 – 3. The system efficiency is directly proportional to the concentration of polycarboxylate ions. The optimum mass of NIO used a good inducing disappearance of linuron was 1 g. L- 1. Furthermore, changes in the concentrations of Fe 3 + and Fe 2 + ions in the photo-reaction were also strongly dependent on the initial <b>oxalate</b> and iron <b>oxide</b> concentration.

Variation in content of total irons (FeT and Fea) were not significant in the soils, but content of Feh, Fed, Fex and Fex/d significantly varied in the soils on the various parent materials. Therefore processes and extent of pedogenesis were considered to influence the variations resulting in recrystallization and increase in content of Feh and Fed in these soils. The significant correlation between various forms of Fe (Fea, Fed, and Fex) with active iron ratio further affirmed that as soils on basement complexes increase in their pedogenetic age, Fe content generally increases irrespective of total forms of iron. The strong correlation between FeT, Fea and Fed indicate that these forms of iron were extracted from similar sources...|$|R

Processes for the recovery of critical rare-earth (RE) elements from the phosphor powder waste, however, often involve use of aggressive acid or alkali digestion, multi-stage separation procedures, and production of large aqueous waste streams which require further treatment.

The gel was synthesized using the Fe(II) salt, non-ionic surfactant, and propylene <b>oxide.</b> <b>Oxalate</b> powder was sandwiched between two mesoporous Y 2 O 3 barrier layers on a metal foil, whereas the Fe-oxyhydroxide gel was coated directly on a foil to prepare the reactive substrates.

40|$|The cadmium/zinc hyperaccumulator Thlaspi caerulescens is {{sensitive}} toward copper (Cu) toxicity, {{which is a}} problem for phytoremediation of soils with mixed contamination. Cu levels in T. caerulescens grown with 10 microm Cu(2 +) remained in the nonaccumulator range (< 50 ppm), and most individuals were as sensitive toward Cu as the related nonaccumulator Thlaspi fendleri. Obviously, hyperaccumulation and metal resistance are highly metal specific. Cu-induced inhibition of photosynthesis followed the "sun reaction" type of damage, with inhibition of the photosystem II reaction center charge separation and the water-splitting complex. A few individuals of T. caerulescens were more Cu resistant. Compared with Cu-sensitive individuals, they recovered faster from inhibition, at least partially by enhanced repair of chlorophyll-protein complexes but not by exclusion, since the content of Cu in their shoots was increased by about 25 %. Extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements on frozen-hydrated leaf samples revealed that a large proportion of Cu in T. caerulescens is bound by sulfur ligands. This is in contrast to the known binding environment of cadmium and zinc in the same species, which is dominated by oxygen ligands. Clearly, hyperaccumulators detoxify hyperaccumulated metals differently compared with nonaccumulated metals. Furthermore, strong features in the Cu-EXAFS spectra ascribed to metal-metal contributions were found, in particular in the Cu-resistant specimens. Some of these features may be due to Cu binding to metallothioneins, but a larger proportion seems to result from biomineralization, most likely Cu(II) <b>oxalate</b> and Cu(II) <b>oxides.</b> Additional contributions in the EXAFS spectra indicate complexation of Cu(II) by the nonproteogenic amino acid nicotianamine, which has a very high affinity for Cu(II) as further characterized here...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{synthesise}} and control a nanostructured composite of copper/cobalt. Both the copper and cobalt oxalate exhibit a nanostructure. Attempts to produce nanocomposite particles in the size range of 10 - 70 nm were made via an oxalate co-precipitation route followed by the appropriate thermal treatment to finally obtain the metal nanocomposite. Much attention was focussed on {{the understanding of the}} copper oxalate precipitation and its further transformation into metal before the investigation of the co-precipitation system. One major challenge of this thesis work was to achieve {{a better understanding of the}} copper oxalate precipitation mechanism. This was made by following kinetic parameters in order to shed light on the various steps of the precipitation from a supersaturated solution (nucleation, growth and aggregation of nanocrystals). Following the pH as a function of time and using the thermodynamic solubility data it was possible to propose a kinetic model of copper oxalate precipitation, with the co-precipitation of slight amounts (around 0. 40 % wt) of malachite (CuCO 3 ·Cu(OH) 2). The copper oxalate nanostructured particle growth mechanism, from the self-assembly of nanosized buildings blocks, was confirmed for intermediate precipitation times (1 - 15 minutes). Evidence for such organisation of the particles was shown by a combination of XRD diffraction, SEM and AFM measurements showing the presence of steps at the particle surface with a height that corresponds to a multiple of the mean crystallite size in that particular crystallographic orientation. Further investigations were performed for the early steps of the precipitation by SAXS but either the precipitated volume fraction was too low for detection of the particles or nucleation and growth kinetics were to fast (less than one second) to be followed. The TEM cross-section analyses showed a possible core-shell assembly mechanism. The core showed a random organisation of the crystallites with a size of around 25 nm, while the crystallite in the shell with a size of around 40 nm presented certain order along the 110 axis, particularly towards the particle surface. All these details provided the opportunity to propose a new and more detailed mechanism of the copper oxalate polycrystalline particle formation. In order to master the conditions of the Cu/Cu oxalate decomposition, a good understanding of the simple copper oxalate decomposition was necessary. All along this thesis, much attention was paid to the transformation of the copper oxalate cubic particles into the metal. The objective was thus to conserve the particles cubic macrostructure morphology and their internal nanoscale spatial organisation. To this goaltwo routes were investigated: a direct transformation and another, an indirect one, that required the formation of an oxide. Both the copper <b>oxalate</b> and the <b>oxide</b> showed an anisotropic behaviour during the transformation into the metal. It is shown experimentally that the anisotropy, nanostructure and inhomogeneity of the initial nanocrystallites of both the <b>oxalate</b> and the <b>oxide</b> have an important influence on the mechanism and evolution of transformation into the metal. The particle morphology was shown to be lost for a transformation yield of α> 0. 80 in the case of the direct transformation from the oxalate whereas the morphology was kept up to the metallic state when passing via the oxide. A kinetic model was proposed for both systems using the method of the sudden change in temperature and pressure. The kinetics analysis did not permit a total understanding of the transformations studied, as several stages were shown to have complex and concurrently competing mechanisms. However, a geometrical model was proposed using the ex-situ analysis of the samples as a function of the reaction yield for both routes. For the initial stages of the copper oxide reduction under He/H 2 atmospheres, the kinetic analysis showed hydrogen dissociation as a rate-limiting step. With a view to producing a cobalt/copper composite, preliminary experiments were carried out for the co-precipitation of the Co/Cu oxalate with different cationic ratios. Thermodynamic calculations showed the formation of the two solids was possible independent of the ratio Co/Cu. Experimentally, however a co-precipitation was obtained only for a ratio Co/Cu of 1, whereas for other ration only one single phase (either copper oxalate or cobalt oxalate) was formed. A second route was investigated using cobalt <b>oxalate</b> or cobalt <b>oxide</b> seeds. The amount of the cobalt detected by TEM in the precipitate using either the oxalate or from the oxide seeds was around 3 %wt, which is lower than the value of 10 %wt necessary to provide desired magnetic properties in the resulting precipitate. The exact nature and spatial distribution of the cobalt was not ascertained and further analysis of the nanostructure by TEM needs to be carried out to confirm the premise of the seed route. This thesis has shown that it is possible to get to a deeper understanding of the kinetics and the mechanism of the copper oxalate precipitation using the appropriate techniques. The cubic macrostructure can be conserved from the initial CuO nanoparticles (13 nm) to metallic Cu (42 nm) by a controlled transformation in a reducing atmosphere. Preliminary experiments made on the possible formation of a Co/Cu composite via the use of the cobalt oxide seeds as heterogeneous nuclei for the copper oxalate precipitation seems most promising...|$|R

Addition of uranium lowered both factors, the maximum effect giving a DELTA E/sub a/ of approximately 14 kcal with an A of approximately 10 /sup - 2 /.

The whole procedure includes seven steps: (1) crushing and milling of the magnet into coarse powder, (2) roasting to transform the metals into the corresponding oxides, (3) the selective leaching of the rare-earth elements with acids (HCl, HNO 3) to leave iron behind in the precipitate, (4) extracting remaining transition metals (Co, Cu, Mn) into the ionic liquid trihexyl(tetradecyl) phosphonium chloride, (5) precipitating the rare earths by the addition of oxalic acid, (6) removing the precipitate by filtration and (7) calcining the rare-earth <b>oxalates</b> to rare-earth <b>oxides</b> which can be used as part of the feedstock for the production process of new magnets. The magnet dissolution process from the oxides utilized four molar equivalents less acid to dissolve all rare earths in comparison with a dissolution process from the non-roasted magnet. Moreover, the less valuable element iron is already removed from the magnet during the dissolution process. The remaining transition metals are extracted into the ionic liquid which can be reused after a stripping process. Hydrochloric acid, the side product of the rare-earth oxalate precipitation process, can be reused in the next selective leaching process. In this way, a recycling process consuming only air, water, oxalic acid and electricity is developed to recover the rare earths from NdFeB magnets in very high purity. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|A crucial {{issue in}} soil C {{dynamics}} modelling {{is to develop}} models suitable for regional scale, but based on local and short-time scale observations. Recent research has illustrated the strong linkage between SOC dynamics and landscape processes. There is increasing evidence that lateral fluxes of SOC, sediment and water will further enhance the variability of SOC dynamics, especially on agricultural land. Hence, in this study, we aim to improve our understanding of soil C dynamics by quantifying the soil respiration response of carbon pools at different positions along a slope catena, characterized by different soil moisture and temperature conditions and by different SOC stock and C pool distributions. The study was performed on a hillslope in the belgian loamy belt. Time series of soil moisture, temperature and surface CO 2 fluxes were monitored {{on a regular basis}} (at least once a week, during spring and autumn 2011) along the hillsope, at the soil surface. At the same positions, soil cores (1 to 1. 5 m depth) were collected and analyzed for SOC, C distribution (using a chemical fractionation), mineral <b>oxides</b> (<b>oxalate</b> extractions), pH, and texture. Our results show that substantial lateral transport of soil materials takes place along this hillslope, with a continuous burying of surface C and minerals {{at the bottom of the}} slope. This results in the development of a colluvial soil with an increasing SOC stock. This colluvial C stock mainly consists of labile C (66 %), and this labile C stock in the colluvium is 3. 5 higher than the labile C stock at the other slope positions. This stock is thus poorly stabilized and has a higher potential for mineralization. The other part of this C stock is stabilized by organo-mineral associations (19 %) or is recalcitrant C (15 %). Compared to the other slope positions, this colluvial stable C stock is significant, as it is 1. 5 to 2 times higher. The spatial gradient of the measured soil respiration is consistent with the previous C pool distribution observations along the hillslope, since there is a significant higher respiration at the bottom of the slope (colluvial area) than at the other slope positions. The measured temporal dynamics of the soil respiration is explained by moisture and temperature variations. This measured space-time dynamics, completed with further additional field measurement campaigns, will be the basis for calibrating and validating hillslope scale soil C turn-over models...|$|R
40|$|The {{surface area}} and pore {{structure}} of easily dispersed soil particles < 2 μm in size (water-dispersible colloids, WDCs) {{are important for}} carbon sequestration and transport in soil, two processes which are essential for the terrestrial carbon cycling. In this work, we {{determine the effects of}} dithionite-citrate-bicarbonate (DCB) extractable metal <b>oxides,</b> and <b>oxalate</b> extractable metal <b>oxides</b> on the specific surface area (SSA) and pore structure of WDCs from silt loam topsoils of three TERENO test sites with a similar clay content (20 %) in Germany (arable (Selhausen), grassland (Rollesbroich) and forest (Wuestebach) soils). The N 2 gas-adsorption (- 196 °C), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and microelectrophoretic (ME) methods were used and compared. Results show that 1) the SSA of the WDCs from Selhausen, Rollesbroich, and Wuestebach decreased more after DCB treatment (27 %, 35 %, and 44 %) than after oxalate treatment (5 %, 14 %, and 22 %). DCB removed metal oxide nanoparticles from WDCs were found to have diameters (dp) ranging from 4 nm to 8 nm and the surface loading ratios on the surface of aluminosilicate residues in WDCs were estimated to be 11 % to 22 % for three soils where the highest value was found in the acidic forest soil. 2) Pore sizes in the mesopore range (2 nm to 50 nm) were analyzed in the WDC fractions. The results were discussed in terms of accessible open pores for the pristine WDCs and WDC samples from which metal oxide nanoparticles and organic carbon (OC) had been removed. The lower average pore radius (Rp) measured by the N 2 gas-adsorption method based on the total volume (Vt) to SSA ratio variations in WDCs without metal oxides compared to WDC with metal oxides indicated a contraction of the porous structure of WDCs due to the presence of metal oxide nanoparticles. The pore size distribution (PSD) analysis showed a sensitive contribution of metal oxide nanoparticles in the low range of pore sizes (< 25 nm) of WDCs. In SAXS measurements, higher surface fractal dimensions (Ds) were observed in WDCs before the metal oxide's removal, which supports a roughness increase of the interfaces in the presence of nanoparticles. The colloidal characterization of WDCs by the DLS and ME methods shows, at a μm scale, the role of positively charged metal oxide nanoparticles in forming WDCs with a more compact structure by decreasing the particle size (dz) and the negative zeta potential (ζ). 3) The comparison of Rp, k, dz and dp results between different soils also indicates the dependence on the clay mineralogy of WDCs so that the heterocoagulation between kaolinite and illite (clay minerals of different aspect ratios) increases the size of soil mesopores (Rollesbroich). In conclusion, {{the results of this study}} clearly show that the combination of the N 2 gas-adsorption, SAXS, DLS and ME methods allows the characterization of soil porosity in the nanometer range where metal oxide nanoparticles contribute to a more compact structure of WDC. © 2014 Elsevier B.
