5|$|Adaptation {{had been}} in {{development}} {{as far back as}} 1994. Jonathan Demme brought the project to Columbia Pictures with Kaufman writing the script.

Though the film is billed as an adaptation of The Orchid Thief, its primary narrative focus is Charlie Kaufman's struggle to adapt The Orchid Thief into a film, while dramatizing the events of the book in parallel. Adaptation also adds a number of fictitious elements, including Kaufman's twin brother (also credited as a writer for the film) and a romance between <b>Orlean</b> <b>and</b> Laroche, and culminates in completely invented events including fictional versions of <b>Orlean</b> <b>and</b> Laroche three years after the events related in The Orchid Thief.|$|R
