40|$|Experiments are {{described}} in this thesis on the <b>optical</b> <b>bleaching</b> at room temperature of F centres in freshly cleaved single crystal KBr, coloured by fast electron (50 KV) irradiation and illuminated with light from a focused helium-neon laser. Using a specially constructed microspectrophotometer bleaching apparatus, which is described in Chapter Two, data was obtained on <b>optical</b> <b>bleaching</b> at illuminating power densities up to 10 KW. cm- 2 in KBr having initial F centres concentrations of 10 (18) - 10 (19) centres cm. - 3. The bleaching light intensity is some 10 (6) times greater than that used in previous experiments, and the initial defect concentrations produced by electron irradiation are considerably higher than {{those found in the}} additively coloured specimens used in earlier experiments. Essentially, there have been no previous studies made on the <b>optical</b> <b>bleaching</b> of electron irradiated alkalil halide, and very little work has been done on the laser bleaching of this material coloured by any of the other methods possible. It is found that KBr which has been coloured by electron irradiation at room temperature bleaches by the random aggregation of F centres, a process which also occurs in additively coloured material. Prolonged bleaching, to absorbed doses of > 4 x 10 (8) J. oa- 3, does not result in a complete disappearance of absorption in the F band region, but leads to the formation of a residual coloration which is due to excited states of the M and R centres. A technique of optical modulation spectroscopy described in Chapter Five, showed that R+ centres are formed during illumination, which points to the importance of the F +o M+ and M+∝ -> R+ reactions in the aggregation process. In marked contrast, a vacancy interstitial recombination mechanism occurs in KBr which has been coloured by electron irradiation at 90 K warmed in the dark to room temperature for bleaching. There is a direct proportionality between the height of the V band and the total number of vacancies present in F, M and R centre throughout the <b>optical</b> <b>bleaching</b> ot KBr coloured at low temperature. Prolonged bleaching leads to the complete disappearance of the F, M, R and V bands, and the optical absorption spectrum of the crystal is similar to that seen prior to coloration. The atomic mechanisms responsible for bleaching under illumination at room temperature in KBr coloured additively, and by fast electron irradiation at room and liquid nitrogen temperatures, are discussed at length in Chapters Four and Five. Chapter Six describes investigations into the coloration and bleaching properties of the sodalites using a dark trace cathode ray tube with an aluminised chlorosodalite powder screen.

In this paper, we use a modified version of a comprehensive model to simulate the complete experimental sequence of the new protocol, and to fit the experimental dose?response graphs of the OSL, TT-OSL and basic-TT-OSL signals for doses up to 4000 Gy. Two possible mechanisms for the production of the TT-OSL signals in this quartz are discussed, namely the double transfer mechanism suggested for the recuperation effect, and a single transfer mechanism in which the TT-OSL signal is due to the thermal transfer of charge from a ?source trap? into the fast OSL trap of quartz. The results of the simulation indicate that the latter mechanism is more likely to be responsible for the observed TT-OSL dose growth in fine-grained quartz extracted from Chinese loess.

The products are optically active, are alike, and {{are the same as}} the one obtained in the acid-catalyzed reaction of the glycol with formaldehyde. II. The coloration of sodium chloride by white x-radiation has been separated into two distinct types. The intense color at the surface involves the creation of new anionic vacancies by longwave radiation; aggregate color centers result from <b>optical</b> or thermal <b>bleaching.</b> The less intense coloration throughout the crystal is due to the short-wave radiation; no new vacancies are created and no secondary coloration occurs. Plastic deformation does not affect the overall colorability but greatly enhances the secondary coloration effects. Tentative mechanisms for these processes are discussed. Studies of the secondary radiative coloration, the so-called colloidal band in additively colored crystals, and the color of blue rocksalt have led to the suggestion that these color centers are members of a continuous series of F center aggregates. The possibility of a true colloidal dispersion in additively colored sodium chloride has been investigated by comparison of these crystals with sodium chloride, known to contain colloidal copper. Crystals of sodium chloride have been grown containing heavy metal ion impurities. Spectrophotometric studies have been made of these crystals before and after radiative and additive coloration. The ultraviolet absorption bands in the uncolored crystals have been tentatively explained in terms of V centers. X-radiation and bleaching destroys some of the absorption bands and creates others.

The second phase, SrZn 5, contains 24 atoms in its unit cell, is orthorhombic, and has been tentatively assigned the symmetry Pmnb. The third phase, SrZn 2, is also orthorhombic, and has 12 atoms in a body centered unit cell. No single crystals of the fourth phase have been isolated, but the composition has been shown to correspond approximately to Sr 3 Zn 2 or Sr 4 Zn 3. The structure of the [ [...] . ] phase has been worked out in detail. It has the space group [ [...] . ]-Imma, and corresponds to an orthorhombic distortion of the hexagonal magnesium boride structure...|$|R
40|$|Catalyst covered (few {{nanometers}} of Platinum or Palladium) {{tungsten oxide}} films of some hundred nanometers color in hydrogen containing atmosphere blue {{because of an}} absorption with a maximum in the infrared region. In oxygen containing atmosphere the films bleach. This coloration and bleaching is reversible and shows remarkable potential for industrial applications. Main goal of the thesis is {{the identification of the}} atomistic switching process. Two different models describing the switching effect on an atomic level are known. The model of hydrogen-intercalation predicts the building of tungsten bronzes by the intercalataion of hydrogen atoms into the film during coloration in hydrogen containing atmosphere. This reduces the tungsten atoms. Small polarons are build which generate an absorption in the infrared region. During bleaching in oxygen containing atmosphere the intercalated hydrogen atoms reach the pores of the tungsten oxide films, where they build water with oxygen atoms out of the gas-atmosphere. The second model describes that oxygen vacancies are build during coloration under hydrogen containing atmosphere. So this model is named oxygen-vacancies model. Tungsten is reduced from oxidation state VI+ to V+. Again polaron absorption is generated. The oxygen atoms form water in the pores of the tungsten oxide film with the hydrogen atoms out of the atmosphere. Oxygen containing atmosphere generates the reverse reactions. Oxygen vacancies are filled again by oxygen atoms. Tungsten atoms are oxidized from V+ to VI+ and the film <b>bleaches.</b> <b>Optical</b> in-situ analysis of tungsten oxide films during coloration and bleaching give important hints to the atomistic process. The oxygen vacancies model can describe the results: Transmission spectroscopy and ellipsometric spectroscopy were performed at the same time for the same tungsten oxide sample. The simulation of these spectra results in a variation of the film thickness. During coloration in hydrogen containing atmosphere the thickness is reduced by around one percent. In oxygen containing atmosphere the thickness reaches after bleaching that film thickness of the bleached film before coloration again. In-situ XRR-analysis confirmed this result for the variation of the film thickness. Spectroscopic in-situ analysis in the near infrared region detect a strong increase of the amount of water during coloration in hydrogen containing atmosphere. It does not during bleaching in oxygen containing atmosphere. Variation of the tungsten oxide film thickness of around one percent and the development of the amount of water during coloration and bleaching could be explained by the oxygen vacancies model only. The hydrogen intercalation model is not able to explain the results...|$|R
