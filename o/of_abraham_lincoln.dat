5|$|For {{many years}} after Curry's death, McGugin had three {{photographs}} displayed over his desk. The three pictures were <b>of</b> <b>Abraham</b> <b>Lincoln,</b> Robert E. Lee, and Curry. McGugin read military history, and before a tough game enjoyed reading about Lee's strategies.|$|E

5|$|In {{the former}} Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia, the Museum of the Confederacy was {{involved}} in a controversy regarding a statue of Davis donated by the Sons of Confederate Veterans in 2008. Likewise, a statue <b>of</b> <b>Abraham</b> <b>Lincoln,</b> donated to the Civil War Visitor Center in Richmond in 2003, resulted in protests.|$|E
5|$|Nora Titone recounts in {{her book}} My Thoughts Be Bloody (2010) how the shame and {{ambition}} of Junius Brutus Booth's illegitimate actor sons Edwin and John Wilkes eventually spurred them to strive for achievement and acclaim as rivals—Edwin, a Unionist, and John Wilkes, the assassin <b>of</b> <b>Abraham</b> <b>Lincoln.</b>|$|E
5|$|Indiana, a {{free state}} and the boyhood home <b>of</b> <b>Abraham</b> <b>Lincoln,</b> {{remained}} {{a member of the}} Union during the American Civil War. Indiana regiments were involved in all the major engagements of the war and almost all the engagements in the western theater. Hoosiers were present in the first and last battles of the war. During the war, Indiana provided 126 infantry regiments, 26 batteries of artillery, and 13 regiments of cavalry to the cause of the Union.|$|E

5|$|Lincoln's mother, Nancy, {{is widely}} {{assumed to have}} been the {{daughter}} of Lucy Hanks, although no record of Nancy Hanks' birth has ever been found. According to William Ensign Lincoln's book The Ancestry <b>of</b> <b>Abraham</b> <b>Lincoln,</b> Nancy was the daughter of Joseph Hanks; however, the debate continues over whether she was born out of wedlock. Still another researcher, Adin Baber, claims that Nancy Hanks was the daughter of Abraham Hanks and Sarah Harper of Virginia.|$|E
5|$|On January 8, 1861 Helm chaired {{a meeting}} in Louisville that {{advocated}} for Kentucky's neutrality in the Civil War. Helm was an outspoken opponent of secession, but also denounced the election <b>of</b> <b>Abraham</b> <b>Lincoln</b> and his {{use of military force}} to subdue the southern states. Because Helm did not condemn his son, Benjamin, for joining the Confederate Army, federal authorities classified him as a southern sympathizer.|$|E
5|$|President Garfield {{came to the}} Sixth Street Station {{on his way to}} {{his alma}} mater, Williams College, where he was {{scheduled}} to deliver a speech. Garfield was accompanied by two of his sons, James and Harry, and Secretary of State Blaine. Secretary of War Robert Todd Lincoln waited at the station to see the President off. Garfield had no bodyguard or security detail; with the exception <b>of</b> <b>Abraham</b> <b>Lincoln</b> during the Civil War, early U.S. presidents never used any guards.|$|E

5|$|Though {{alarmed by}} the {{election}} <b>of</b> <b>Abraham</b> <b>Lincoln</b> in the election of 1860, Hawes was an opponent of secession, supporting instead the idea of armed neutrality. In May 1861, Hawes, Breckinridge, and Kentucky governor Beriah Magoffin represented the Southern Rights viewpoint at a convention to decide Kentucky's course in the Civil War. He attended another such convention in September 1861. Neither convention produced a conclusive decision.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he owned}} a number of slaves, and his {{marriage}} to Virginia Shelby had {{left him with a}} good many more, Breckinridge had been a supporter of gradual emancipation and colonization of blacks since his early political career. As the sectional crisis worsened, this led him into several high-profile debates, notably with fellow Kentuckian Robert Wickliffe, the uncle of Robert C. Wickliffe. His support <b>of</b> <b>Abraham</b> <b>Lincoln</b> for president in the election of 1860 pitted him against his own nephew, Vice President John C. Breckinridge.|$|E
5|$|As the {{sectional}} conflict {{leading up}} to the Civil War escalated, Breckinridge was put in the unusual position of being a slaveholder who opposed slavery. His support <b>of</b> <b>Abraham</b> <b>Lincoln</b> for president in the election of 1860 put him at odds with his nephew, John C. Breckinridge. The tragic scenario of brother against brother literally played out in Breckinridge's family, with two of his sons joining each side during the war. Following the war, Breckinridge retired to his home in Danville, where he died on December 27, 1871.|$|E

5|$|Following {{his term}} as governor, Powell {{was elected to}} the U.S. Senate. Before he could assume office, President James Buchanan {{dispatched}} Powell and Major Benjamin McCulloch to Utah to ease tensions with Brigham Young and the Mormons. Powell assumed his Senate seat on his return from Utah, just prior to the election <b>of</b> <b>Abraham</b> <b>Lincoln</b> as president. Powell became an outspoken critic of Lincoln's administration, {{so much so that the}} Kentucky General Assembly asked for his resignation and some of his fellow senators tried to have him expelled from the body. Both groups later renounced their actions.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{assassination}} <b>of</b> <b>Abraham</b> <b>Lincoln,</b> Old Bob was again brought out of retirement. During the cortège preceding the funeral in Springfield, Old Bob was caparisoned {{in a black}} mourning blanket trimmed with silver fringe and tassels. Henry Brown, an African Methodist Episcopal minister and friend of the Lincoln family, led Old Bob, whose spot in the procession was immediately behind the hearse {{and in front of}} the carriage carrying Robert Todd Lincoln. It has been said that Robert Lincoln and Old Bob were the only members of Lincoln's family present at his funeral.|$|E
5|$|The {{assassination}} <b>of</b> <b>Abraham</b> <b>Lincoln</b> {{was deemed}} a fluke {{due to the}} Civil War, and Garfield, like most people, saw no reason why {{the president should be}} guarded; Garfield's movements and plans were often printed in the newspapers. Guiteau knew the president would leave Washington for a cooler climate on July 2, and made plans to kill him before then. He purchased a gun he thought would look good in a museum, and followed Garfield several times, but each time his plans were frustrated, or he lost his nerve. His opportunities dwindled to one—Garfield's departure by train for New Jersey on the morning of July 2, 1881.|$|E

5|$|The {{centerpiece}} of the Lincoln Room is a portrait <b>of</b> <b>Abraham</b> <b>Lincoln</b> painted by 19th-century American portraitist Edward Dalton Marchant; {{it is one of}} a number of drawings, paintings, and photographs of Lincoln used to decorate this room. The sitting room in the Blair House wing of the complex was originally used by the Blair family to receive U.S. presidents. In this room in 1861, Montgomery Blair, acting on Lincoln's orders, offered the command of the Union Army to Robert E. Lee, an offer that Lee declined.|$|E
5|$|The {{need for}} strong leaders {{who could take}} charge and steer America out of its crisis is seen in Gabriel Over the White House (1933), about a benevolent {{dictator}} who takes control of the United States. Walter Huston stars as a weak-willed, ineffectual president (likely modeled after Hoover) who is inhabited by the archangel Gabriel upon being knocked unconscious. The spirit's behavior {{is similar to that}} <b>of</b> <b>Abraham</b> <b>Lincoln.</b> The president solves the nation's unemployment crisis and executes an Al Capone-type criminal who has continually flouted the law.|$|E
5|$|With the 1860 {{election}} <b>of</b> <b>Abraham</b> <b>Lincoln,</b> {{the first}} president from the largely anti-slavery Republican Party, conventions in thirteen slave states ultimately declared secession and formed the Confederate States of America, while the federal government maintained that secession was illegal. The ensuing war was at first for Union, then after 1863 as casualties mounted and Lincoln delivered his Emancipation Proclamation, a second war aim became abolition of slavery. The war remains the deadliest military conflict in American history, resulting {{in the deaths of}} approximately 618,000 soldiers as well as many civilians.|$|E
