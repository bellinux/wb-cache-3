5000|$|Tests {{to assess}} the {{cleanroom}} suitability of a machine or <b>operating</b> <b>utility</b> using measurement techniques are performed in a cleanroom {{in order to be}} certain that the particles detected are emitted from the test piece. The test cleanroom has to be at least one class cleaner that the desired suitability of the test piece, otherwise it would not be possible to relate the particles detected to the test piece in question. An exception to this is when determining the suitability of a test piece for use in Class 1 cleanrooms in accordance with DIN EN ISO 14644-1: such tests have to be carried out in a Class 1 cleanroom because no other cleanroom classes are defined which are better than this. The test cleanroom must have a low-turbulence airflow (often known as laminar in this context) in order to prove high air cleanliness classes and also accurately locate particle sources.|$|E

40|$|This study aims at {{analyzing}} {{nuclear power}} plant performances {{of the last decade}} through clustering techniques. Annual trends of performance indicators for light water reactors included in the IAEA PRIS database are used to discover a natural clustering of nuclear plants. The analysis of the obtained clusters allows identifying plants with similar performance trends and recognizing outliers and relationships, helping the identification of determinant factors leading to successful nuclear operation. In detail, a cluster analysis is performed jointly using the following three performance indicators: Unit Capability Factor (UCF), Unplanned Capability Loss Factor (UCLF), and Forced Loss Rate (FLR). Physical and technical parameters (e. g., technology design, supplier, country) and managerial aspects (e. g., kind of <b>operating</b> <b>utility)</b> are included in the analysis to characterize and interpret, through conditional barplots, the identified clusters. Reasons for the division are discussed, considering hypotheses for similarities among the plants included in the cluster...|$|E

40|$|High voltage {{transformers}} use {{paper to}} insulate the electrical windings {{present in the}} core which is then subsequently immersed in oil. In service, {{the temperature of the}} windings will increase to typically 80 degrees C. If the transformer is loaded to beyond its design ratings, the temperature can exceed 100 degrees C causing the cellulose chains in the paper to cleave at an accelerated rate, resulting in the degradation of mechanical strength and performance of the insulation. If unchecked, this can lead to catastrophic failure of the transformed and accompanying disruption to electricity supply and large economic losses to the <b>operating</b> <b>utility.</b> Furfuraldehyde (FFA) is a chemical by-product which is released into the oil by the thermal degradation of the paper winding. The concentration of FFA within the oil has been directly related to the condition of the paper insulation. We have developed absorbance and fluorescence optical techniques incorporating a novel FFA- sensitive material which we have invested at our laboratories. This material has been incorporated into a prototype portable optoelectronic instrument for the measurement of FFA {{at the site of the}} transformer. Results of experiments will be presented, and the implication of these results for condition monitoring of HV transformer will be discussed...|$|E

40|$|Power {{transformers}} use Kraft {{paper as}} insulation in the electrical windings {{present in the}} core, which is immersed in oil. In service, {{the temperature of the}} windings of core will go to 750 C to 850 C. If the transformer is over loaded, then the temperature can exceed upto 100 Â°C causing the cellulose chains in the paper to cleave at an accelerated rate, which results in the degradation of mechanical strength and performance of the insulation. The Degree of Polymerization (DP) will also decrease. If proper action will not take, this can lead to failure of the transformer and disruption to electricity supply and large economic losses to the <b>operating</b> <b>utility.</b> Transformer condition should be maintained because of its importance to electricity network. The life of transformer depends on the life of the oil impregnated paper insulation system to greater extent. Degradation of the cellulose insulation is an irreversible process. After thermal degradation of the paper winding, Furfuraldehyde (FFA) is the chemical compound, which is released into the oil from paper. The concentration of FFA has been directly related to the condition of the paper insulation. In the present paper an experimental investigation has been made to evaluate the degradation of transformer oil contaminated by nano-particles of pine wood under accelerated thermal and electrical stress and results are correlated with breakdown strength, density & interfacial tension of the pure oil. The contaminated oil samples are tested at electric stress of 2. 0 kV, 3. 0 kV, 4. 0 kV & 5. 0 kV for 24, 48, 72 & 96 hours simultaneously...|$|E
40|$|In {{a nuclear}} power plant, {{one of the most}} {{important}} systems for both safety and performance is the reactor cooling system. The cooling system is generally driven by one or more very large centrifugal pumps. Most reactor coolant pumps utilize a multi-stage mechanical face seal system for fluid containment. As a result, these seal systems are critical to safe, continued operation of a nuclear reactor. Without adequate sealing, loss of coolant volume can occur, and a reactor may be forced to shut down, costing the <b>operating</b> <b>utility</b> significantly until it can be brought online again. The main advantage of mechanical face seals is their self-adjusting properties. These seals are tuned so that they automatically adjust to varying fluid conditions to provide adequate leakage control. Because of the enormous pressures, complicated water chemistry, and possible large temperature transients, the mechanical seals inside a reactor coolant pump must be some of the most robust seals available. In addition, their long service life and continuous operation demand durability and the capability to adjust to a wide range of conditions. However, over time, wear, chemical deposition, or changing operating conditions can alter the face gap, which is the critical geometry between the sealing faces of a seal. An altered face gap can lead to undesirable conditions of too much or not enough leakage, which must be maintained within a certain range to provide lubrication and cooling to the seal faces without resulting in uncontrolled coolant volume loss. Nuclear power plants operate within strict leakage ranges, and long-term effects causing undesirable leakage can eventually necessitate a reactor shutdown if the seal cannot self-adjust to control the leakage. This document will examine possible causes of undesirable leakage rates in a commonly-used reactor coolant pump assembly. These causes will be examined to determine the conditions which promote them, the physical explanation for their effect on the operation of a mechanical seal, and possible methods of mitigation of both the cause and its effect. These findings are based on previous publications by utilities and technical and incident reports from reactor stations which detail actual incidents of abnormal seal performance and their root causes as determined by the utilities. Next, a method of increasing the ability of a mechanical seal to adapt to a wider range of conditions will be proposed. This method involves modifying an existing seal face to include a method of active control. This active control focuses on deliberately deforming one face of the mechanical sealing face pair. This deformation alters the face gap in order to make the fluid conditions inside the face gap more preferable, generating more or less leakage as desired. Two methods of actuation, hydraulic pressure and piezoelectric deformation, will be proposed. Finally, a model of the actively controlled seal faces will be introduced. This model includes a method of numerically solving the Reynolds equation to determine the fluid mechanics that drive the lubrication problem in the seal face and coupling the solution with a deformation analysis in a finite element model of a seal face. The model solves iteratively until a converged solution of a sealed pressure distribution, a resulting face deformation, and a calculated leakage rate is reached. The model includes a study of the effects of induced deformation in the seal via both hydraulic and piezoelectric actuation and the ability of this deformation to control the leakage rate.
