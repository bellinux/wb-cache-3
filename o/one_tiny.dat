25|$|At 12.50, {{just after}} I {{had emerged from}} a state of jubilation at finding the first {{definite}} fossils on Everest, {{there was a sudden}} clearing of the atmosphere, and the entire summit ridge and final peak of Everest were unveiled. My eyes became fixed on <b>one</b> <b>tiny</b> black spot silhouetted on a small snow-crest beneath a rock-step in the ridge; the black spot moved. Another black spot became apparent and moved up the snow to join the other on the crest. The first then approached the great rock-step and shortly emerged at the top; the second did likewise. Then the whole fascinating vision vanished, enveloped in cloud once more.|$|E

500|$|The Head Wall {{was built}} in 1834 when the medieval village was {{abandoned}} and a new one planned between Tobar Childa and the sea some 700feet (200 m) down the slope. This came about {{as the result of}} a visit by Sir Thomas Dyke Ackland, one of the members of parliament for Devon. Appalled by the primitive conditions, he gave money for the building of a completely new settlement of thirty new blackhouses. These houses were made of dry stone, had thick walls, and were roofed with turf. Each typically had only <b>one</b> <b>tiny</b> window and a small opening for letting out smoke from the peat fire that burnt in the middle of the room. As a result, the interiors were blackened by soot. The cattle occupied one end of the house in winter, and once a year the straw from the floor was stripped out and spread on the ground. [...] In October 1860, several of the new dwellings were damaged by a severe gale, and repairs were sufficient only to make them suitable for use as byres. According to Alasdair MacGregor's analysis of the settlement, the sixteen modern, zinc-roofed cottages amidst the black houses and new Factor's house seen in most photographs of the native islanders were constructed around 1862.|$|E

He uses the Compleat Atlas of the House, a magic book which contains all the information of the entire house, to rebuild the house, and the secondary realms exactly {{as it was a}} few seconds before its ultimate demise. Unfortunately, as it only [...] "saved" [...] the universe a few seconds before its end, only <b>one</b> <b>tiny</b> part of the house remained, containing only a few people. The Great Architect splits himself into two, one part himself and the other part Arthur, whom he lets go back to Earth.|$|E

2500|$|With time an issue, the {{construction}} team worked around the clock. The domed top, housing {{the top five}} levels (including the restaurants and observation deck), was perfectly balanced so that the restaurant could rotate {{with the help of}} <b>one</b> <b>tiny</b> electric motor, originally , later replaced with a [...] motor. With paint colors named Orbital Olive for the body, Astronaut White for the legs, Re-entry Red for the saucer, and Galaxy Gold for the roof, the Space Needle was finished in less than one year. It was completed in April 1962 at a cost of $4.5 million. The last elevator car was installed the day before the Fair opened on April 21. During the course of the Fair nearly 20,000 people a day rode the elevators to the Observation Deck. The 20,000 mark was never reached, missed by fewer than 50 people one day. At the time of construction, it was the tallest building in the West, taking the title from the Smith Tower across town that had held that title since 1914.|$|E
2500|$|Frank P. Ramsey {{visited him}} on 17 September 1923 {{to discuss the}} Tractatus; he had agreed to write a review of it for Mind.

Ramsey shared an evening meal with him of coarse bread, butter, and cocoa. Wittgenstein's school hours were eight to twelve or one, and he had afternoons free. After Ramsey returned to Cambridge a long campaign began among Wittgenstein's friends {{to persuade him to}} return to Cambridge and away from what they saw as a hostile environment for him. He was accepting no help even from his family. Ramsey wrote to John Maynard Keynes: [...] " [...] are very rich and extremely anxious to give him money or do anything for him in any way, and he rejects all their advances; even Christmas presents or presents of invalid's food, when he is ill, he sends back. And this is not because they aren't on good terms but because he won't have any money he hasn't earned ... It is an awful pity." ...|$|E

[...] A. O. Scott of the New York Times stated the film [...] "is at once bloated and efficient, executed with tremendous discipline and intelligence and conceived with not too much of either" [...] and found that [...] "it surpasses Roland Emmerich’s 1998 Hollywood version" [...] and praised the film's aftermath destruction scenes, stating, [...] "the vistas of trampled cityscapes are frequently more memorable and always more haunting than the chaotic scenes of smashing and flooding that clutter the film’s climax" [...] but felt the characterization was [...] "thin" [...] and the performances were [...] "squandered" [...] but felt that the [...] "soul" [...] of the film [...] "dwells with the monsters". Matt Zoller Seitz highly praised the film's direction and craftsmanship, giving it three and a half out of four stars and stating that [...] "Godzilla represents some sort of high water mark (pun intended) in Hollywood's nearly forty year crusade to turn once-disreputable genre films into pop art that demands our contemplation, if only because of the wit and skill that its army of technicians lavished on each frame. The long shots of kaiju grappling in ruined cities are gloomily magnificent, like oil paintings of Biblical miracles." ...|$|E
