5|$|A 2006 {{study by}} Milan Ćirković and colleagues {{extended}} {{the notion of}} a time-dependent galactic habitable zone, analyzing various catastrophic events as well as the underlying secular evolution of galactic dynamics. The paper considers that the number of habitable planets may fluctuate wildly with time due to the unpredictable timing of catastrophic events, thereby creating a punctuated equilibrium in which habitable planets are more likely at some times than at others. Based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> Monte Carlo simulations on a toy model of the Milky Way, the team found that the number of habitable planets is likely to increase with time, though not in a perfectly linear pattern.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{medications}} are being studied for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, including bedaquiline and delamanid. Bedaquiline received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in late 2012. The {{safety and effectiveness}} of these new agents are still uncertain, because they are based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> a relatively small studies. However, existing data suggest that patients taking bedaquiline in addition to standard TB therapy are five {{times more likely to}} die than those without the new drug, which has resulted in medical journal articles raising health policy questions about why the FDA approved the drug and whether financial ties to the company making bedaquiline influenced physicians' support for its use.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 2010, Juventus {{considered}} challenging the stripping of their scudetti from 2005 and 2006, dependent <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> trials {{connected to the}} 2006 scandal. Subsequent investigations found in 2011 that Juventus' relegation in 2006 was without merit. When former general manager Luciano Moggi's conviction in criminal court {{in connection with the}} scandal was thrown out by an appeals court in 2015, the club sued the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) for €443million for damages caused by their 2006 relegation. FIGC president Carlo Tavecchio offered to discuss reinstatement of the lost scudetti in exchange for Juventus dropping the lawsuit.|$|E
5|$|During the season, {{the team}} scored 90 goals {{at an average}} of four goals per game, beat Walsall Town Swifts 12–0 to set a club record League victory which, , still stands, {{remained}} undefeated on their own ground throughout the season, and won the last nine matches of the League season to take the Second Division title at their first attempt. Promotion to the First Division was not automatic, even for the champions, but depended <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> test matches between the top three Second Division and bottom three First Division teams.

5|$|Strep throat {{is spread}} by {{respiratory}} droplets from an infected person. It may be spread directly or by touching {{something that has}} droplets on it and then touching the mouth, nose, or eyes. Some people may carry the bacteria without symptoms.

The diagnosis is made based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> a rapid antigen detection test or throat culture in those who have symptoms.|$|E
5|$|Anomalies and malformations of the pinna are common. These {{anomalies}} include chromosome syndromes such as ring 18. Children {{may also}} present cases of abnormal ear canals and low ear implantation. In rare cases no pinna is formed (atresia), or is extremely small (microtia). Small pinnae can develop when the auricular hillocks do not develop properly. The ear canal can fail to develop {{if it does}} not channelise properly or if there is an obstruction. Reconstructive surgery to treat hearing loss is considered as an option for children older than five, with a cosmetic surgical procedure to reduce the size or change the shape of the ear is called an otoplasty. The initial medical intervention is aimed at assessing the baby's hearing and the condition of the ear canal, as well as the middle and inner ear.

5|$|Because {{there is}} a maximum number of {{established}} positions for ranks warrant officer first class (one per squadron), promotions are based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> a merit review board. The composition of the merit review board includes {{a minimum of three}} to a maximum of five members. As appointed by the squadron commanding officer, members include: Commanding officer (or delegate) acting as board chairperson; Air Cadet League or local sponsor representative; and a minimum of one and maximum of three additional members from the following: representative(s) of the RCSU CO (area Cadet Instructor Cadre officer, regional cadet advisor, area cadet officer, etc.), squadron CIC officer(s) (from within own or members of neighbouring squadrons), and member(s) of the community (to include: school principal, Legion member, etc.). Prior to 1976 the size of the squadron dictated the top rank available and many squadrons were ineligible to carry a WO1 on their establishment effectively capping promotion at WO2 for the squadron's ranking cadet.|$|E
5|$|It {{was clear}} that the planned {{processing}} flow could not be followed and still meet the 1986 launch date.

The module arrived at the launch site on 6 May, with 1100 of 2500 cables requiring rework based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> tests to the ground test model at Khrunichev. In October, the base block was rolled outside its cleanroom to carry out communications tests.

5|$|Since the 1996–97 season, European Sports Media have {{awarded the}} Golden Shoe {{based on a}} points system that allows players in tougher leagues to win even if they score fewer goals than a player in a weaker league. The {{weightings}} {{are determined by the}} league's ranking on the UEFA coefficients, which in turn depend <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> each league's clubs in European competition over the previous five seasons. Goals scored in the top five leagues according to the UEFA coefficients list are multiplied by a factor of two, goals scored in the leagues ranked six to 21 are multiplied by a factor of 1.5, and goals scored in leagues ranked 22 and below are multiplied by a factor of 1. Thus, goals scored in higher ranked leagues will count for more than those scored in weaker leagues. Since this change, there was only been one winner was not playing in one of the top five leagues (Henrik Larsson, 2000–01 Scottish Premier League).|$|E
