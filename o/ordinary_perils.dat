60|$|These legends {{came across}} {{the mind of the}} clergyman, and, solitary as he was, a melancholy smile shaded his cheek, as he thought of the {{inconsistency}} of human nature, and reflected how many brave men, whom the yell of the pibroch would have sent headlong against fixed bayonets, as the wild bull rushes on his enemy, might have yet feared to encounter those visionary terrors, which he himself, a man of peace, and in <b>ordinary</b> <b>perils</b> no way remarkable for the firmness of his nerves, was now risking without hesitation.|$|E
60|$|Upon {{the evening}} of the seventh day the door of the hut {{suddenly}} opened, and two Highlanders entered, whom Waverley recognised as having been a part of his original escort to this cottage. They conversed for a short time with the old man and his companion, and then made Waverley understand, by very significant signs, that he was to prepare to accompany them. This was a joyful communication. What had already passed during his confinement made it evident that no personal injury was designed to him; and his romantic spirit, having recovered during his repose much of that elasticity which anxiety, resentment, disappointment, and the mixture of unpleasant feelings excited by his late adventures had for a time subjugated, was now wearied with inaction. His passion for the wonderful, although it is the nature of such dispositions to be excited by that degree of danger which merely gives dignity to the feeling of the individual exposed to it, had sunk under the extraordinary and apparently insurmountable evils by which he appeared environed at Cairnvreckan. In fact, this compound of intense curiosity and exalted imagination forms a peculiar species of courage, which somewhat resembles the light usually carried by a miner--sufficiently competent, indeed, to afford him guidance and comfort during the <b>ordinary</b> <b>perils</b> of his labour, but certain to be extinguished should he encounter the more formidable hazard of earth damps or pestiferous vapours. It was now, however, once more rekindled, and with a throbbing mixture of hope, awe, and anxiety, Waverley watched the group before him, as those who were just arrived snatched a hasty meal, and the others assumed their arms and made brief preparations for their departure.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 52 - 53) ???The mere imputation {{of homosexuality}} in America {{may be enough}} to ruin a man's reputation, his livelihood, {{his relationship with his}} government, and any hopes he has for future happiness. Beyond these calamities, moreover, the American male who becomes involved in homosexual contacts must actually fear for his freedom; for to the more <b>ordinary</b> social <b>perils</b> of this behavior have been added the threat of outright persecution under the law [...] . Does a civilized and free society have the right to require such sacrifices from any human being???? (Churchill: 1967) The major focus of the research up to now on homosexuality has been etiology. Irving Bieber's work (1962) is perhaps most often referred to in this vein. His sample consisted of 106 homosexual subjects and 100 heterosexual comparisons, all patients of prominent psychiatrists. Based on the response of the psychiatrists, he concluded that homosexuality is pathological in origin. Evans (1969) research focused on validating or refuting Bieber's findings in a non-patient sample. Because of Bieber's methodology, I find his results questionable, and my main concern is the focus of all the literature on etiology. While I view the attempt to develop a concrete theory on the origins of homosexuality to be a stimulating intellectual exercise, I feel it is largely irrelevant to the individuals who have {{for one reason or another}} chosen a homosexual lifestyle. My concern centers much more on the ethnology of the gay lifestyle. As Sonenschein (1968) says, ???Given a homosexual individual, what does he do about it, what does he do with it, and what happens to him as a result. ??? I feel this is a much more immediately relevant question to both homosexuals and heterosexuals alike. There has been recently some attention given to this question. Unfortunately, all too often either hearsay or mere observation has been the method used for drawing conclusions (an example is Sonenschein's (1968) work.) Others have attempted to understand their gay samples in ways I consider to be cold and detached. The administration of psychological and sociological instruments by experimenters is widespread. Evans (1971) used the Adjective Check List in his study. Thompson, McCandless, and Strickland (1971) administered the Adjective Check List and the Semantic Differential in their sample. Clark and Epstein (1969) used the Tennessee Self Concept Scale. The use of questionnaires was also frequent. Weinberg (1970 a) in his attempt to find variations in social and psychological characteristics between various age brackets of homosexuals employed the use of a questionnaire. I take exception to dealing with the complex question of homosexuality solely on the basis of the experimenter's observation. Additionally, I feel that the humanity of the individual is diminished through testing, and questionnaires cannot possibly capture the intricate variations of human emotion. Consequently, I decided that through human interactions, I could best evaluate the personal difficulties and adjustments gays must face. (See more in text. ...|$|R

5000|$|Both {{under the}} common law and under the Hague-Visby Rules, the term [...] "seaworthiness" [...] covers not just the ship itself, but its crew, its {{provisions}} and equipment, and its suitability for both the cargo and the voyage. The Hong Kong Fir confirmed that the term [...] "seaworthiness" [...] has a very broad meaning ranging from trivial defects like a missing life preserver or a major flaw that would sink the ship. Accordingly, {{it is impossible to}} determine ahead of time what type of term it is. Thus, the type of breach must be determined by the judges. [...] "Seaworthiness" [...] is defined both by common law and by statute. In McFadden v Blue Star Lines 1905 1 KB 607 it was stated that, to be seaworthy, a vessel must have the degree of fitness that an ordinarily careful and prudent shipowner would require his vessel to have at the commencement of a voyage, having regard to all possible circumstances. And the Marine Insurance Act 1906 s 39(4) provides that [...] "a ship is deemed to be seaworthy when she is reasonably fit in all respects to encounter the <b>ordinary</b> <b>perils</b> of the adventure insured." ...|$|E
40|$|An {{insurance}} contract is one under which, for some considerations, the policyholder secures to himself some benefit upon {{the occurrence of}} an uncertain event beyond his own control and adverse to his interests by transferring {{some or all of}} the risk to the insurers. Thus according to the general principle of insurance: insurance is a commodity to protect against casualties and against unforeseeable losses. An issue arises where an unfit vessel is unable to encounter <b>ordinary</b> <b>perils</b> while at sea, and where such unfitness could have been avoided had the shipowner excised due diligence to make the vessel properly equipped, manned and maintained; the risk caused by the unfitness would be foreseeable and outside the scope of insurance in principle. Thus in marine {{insurance contract}}s, there are corresponding rules to prevent such certain risks. The practical significance for such rules is that the insurer can value the risk properly and adjust the premium accordingly without facing certain risks caused by substandard ships. Examinations on such rules under English and Norwegian jurisdiction will be presented in this paper. The United Kingdom is well known as the international market center of marine insurance; while on the other hand an extensive and far-reaching internationalization of the Norwegian Marine Insurance Market has been observed since the early 1980 s. A comparative look between the dominating English marine insurance market and the competitive Norwegian marine insurance market should in my opinion therefore be interesting...|$|E
