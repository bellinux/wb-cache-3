Shortly afterwards, another four people on the square set themselves alight. One of the four, a man, was detained and driven away in a police van.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the surface}} low {{pressure}} center dissipated, {{the remnants of}} Mitch maintained a circulation aloft that reached the Bay of Campeche on November2. That day, the system began to trigger convection once again. Late on November3, the Hurricane Hunters <b>observed</b> <b>a</b> well-defined low-level center and flight-level winds of 60mph (95km/h). On that basis, the NHC began reissuing advisories on Mitch about 55mi (90km) west-southwest of Campeche, Campeche on the Yucatán Peninsula. Upon reforming, Mitch was moving to the east-northeast, influenced by an approaching cold front. Early on November4, Mitch made landfall just north of Campeche with winds of about 40mph (65km/h), and it quickly weakened into a tropical depression while crossing the Yucatán Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|Bessel roughly {{estimated}} {{the period of}} the companion of Sirius to be about half a century; C. A. F. Peters computed an orbit for it in 1851. It was not until 31 January 1862 that Alvan Graham Clark <b>observed</b> <b>a</b> previously unseen star close to Sirius, later identified as the predicted companion. Walter Adams announced in 1915 that he had found the spectrum of Sirius B to be similar to that of Sirius.|$|E
5|$|Captain Louis Mountbatten's 5th Flotilla of K class destroyers {{were painted}} Mountbatten pink in 1940. Mountbatten <b>observed</b> <b>a</b> Union-Castle Liner {{disappear}} from convoy during an autumn sunset {{because of the}} company's unusual lavender-mauve-gray hull color. Mountbatten reasoned the color would be effective camouflage during dawn and dusk periods, and devised a similar shade by mixing medium gray {{with a small amount}} of venetian red. Its effectiveness was much disputed; but it was applied to other destroyers, a few cruisers, and numerous small warships which maintained the scheme through 1944 for use in coastal waters.|$|E

5|$|Chemists {{who studied}} {{platinum}} dissolved it in aqua regia (a mixture of hydrochloric and nitric acids) to create soluble salts. They always <b>observed</b> <b>a</b> {{small amount of}} a dark, insoluble residue. Joseph Louis Proust thought that the residue was graphite. The French chemists Victor Collet-Descotils, Antoine François, comte de Fourcroy, and Louis Nicolas Vauquelin also observed the black residue in 1803, but did not obtain enough for further experiments.|$|E
5|$|Confusion in naming {{began when}} the tree was {{described}} by all three men with three different names. In Paris, Linnaeus gave the plant the name Rhus succedanea, while it was known commonly as grand vernis du Japon. In London the specimens were named by Miller as Toxicodendron altissima and in Busbridge it was dubbed in the old classification system as Rhus Sinese foliis alatis. There are extant records from the 1750s of disputes over the proper name between Philip Miller and John Ellis, curator of Webb's garden in Busbridge. Rather than the issue being resolved, more names soon appeared for the plant: Jakob Friedrich Ehrhart <b>observed</b> <b>a</b> specimen in Utrecht in 1782 and named it Rhus cacodendron.|$|E
5|$|During Stearn's initial {{four years}} in Cambridge (1929–1933), he {{published}} twenty-four papers, predominantly in the Gardeners' Chronicle and Gardening Illustrated and the Journal of Botany, his first in 1929. While working as a gardener's boy during school holidays he had <b>observed</b> <b>a</b> specimen of Campanula pusilla (Campanula cochleariifolia) with a distorted corolla. He then described and published the first appearance of the causative agent, the mould Peronospora corollaea, in Britain, using the facilities of the Botany library.|$|E

5|$|During the War of 1812, Governor Shelby {{called for}} volunteers {{to serve in}} the Army of the Northwest. Colonel John Allen raised a regiment, and Madison was {{commissioned}} as his second-in-command. The regiment, known as the 1st Rifle Regiment of Kentucky Volunteers, fought under James Winchester at the Battle of Frenchtown. Winchester was captured by General Henry Procter, but about four hundred men under Madison repelled several charges by the British. Madison's men believed they had won the victory when they <b>observed</b> <b>a</b> white flag {{in the midst of the}} British force, but the flag was being waved by Winchester as an order for Madison's force to surrender.|$|E
5|$|Experiments {{confirming}} {{the role of}} kin selection in worker policing demonstrate the effects of multiple matings, {{which can lead to}} lower average relatedness between workers. Queens of the social wasp Dolichovespula saxonica mate singly or multiply. Researchers who study these wasps have <b>observed</b> <b>a</b> strong positive correlation between worker relatedness and male production. After controlling for the absolute number of eggs laid, these scientists conclude that the queen's multiple matings favor mutual worker policing.|$|E

5|$|He {{would have}} tried to reconquer the {{province}} if he had the resources, but now he had neither the men nor the money to defend the province any more. Instead he retreated to the cathedral of Antioch, where he <b>observed</b> <b>a</b> solemn service of intercession. He summoned a meeting of his advisers at the cathedral and scrutinized the situation. He was told almost unanimously, and accepted the fact, that the defeat was God's decision and a result of the sins {{of the people of the}} land, including him. Heraclius took to the sea on a ship to Constantinople in the night.|$|E
5|$|Hobbs missed more cricket with {{injuries}} and illnesses in 1929; between 1926 and 1930, he missed {{more than a}} third of Surrey's matches. However, he scored heavily and compiled 2,263 runs at an average of 66.55 to lead the first-class averages. Unfit for the first two Tests against South Africa, he chose to miss the next two, and played in the final game, scoring 10 and 52. Critics <b>observed</b> <b>a</b> general slowing in Hobbs' scoring throughout the season, and he scored more often in singles than in his earlier years.|$|E
5|$|In 1868, Sirius {{became the}} first star to have its {{velocity}} measured, {{the beginning of the}} study of celestial radial velocities. Sir William Huggins examined the spectrum of the star and <b>observed</b> <b>a</b> red shift. He concluded that Sirius was receding from the Solar System at about 40km/s. Compared to the modern value of −5.5km/s, this was an overestimate and had the wrong sign; the minus means it is approaching the Sun.|$|E
