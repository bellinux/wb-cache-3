In 1922, Periyar was elected the President of the Madras Presidency Congress Committee during the Tirupur session, where he advocated strongly for reservation in government jobs and education.

40|$|Objective: Limited {{data are}} {{available}} on the prevalence and patterns <b>of</b> body weight <b>discrimination</b> from representative samples. This study examined experiences <b>of</b> weight/height <b>discrimination</b> in a nationally representative sample of US adults and compared their prevalence and patterns with discrimination experiences based on race and gender. Method and procedures: Data were from the National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States, a 1995 – 1996 community-based survey of English-speaking adults aged 25 – 74 (N 2290). Reported experiences <b>of</b> weight/height <b>discrimination</b> included a variety of institutional settings and interpersonal relationships. Multivariate regression analyses were used to predict weight/height discrimination controlling for sociodemographic characteristics and body weight status. Results: The prevalence <b>of</b> weight/height <b>discrimination</b> ranged from 5 % among men to 10 % among women, but these average percentages obscure the much higher risk <b>of</b> weight <b>discrimination</b> among heavier individuals (40 % for adults with body mass index (BMI) of 35 and above). Younger individuals with a higher BMI had a particularly high risk <b>of</b> weight/height <b>discrimination</b> regardless <b>of</b> their race, education and weight status. Women were at greater risk for weight/ height discrimination than men, especially women with a BMI of 30 – 35 who were {{three times more likely to}} report weight/height discrimination compared to male peers of a similar weight. Discussion: Weight/height discrimination is prevalent in American society and is relatively close to reported rates <b>of</b> racial <b>discrimination,</b> particularly among women.
