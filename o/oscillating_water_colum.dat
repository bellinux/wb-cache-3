40|$|<b>Oscillating</b> <b>water</b> tunnels are {{experimental}} facilities {{commonly used}} in coastal engineering research. They are intended to reproduce near-bed hydrodynamic and sediment transport phenomena at a realistic scale. In an <b>oscillating</b> <b>water</b> tunnel, a piston generates an oscillatory motion that propagates almost instantaneously to the whole tunnel; consequently, flow is uniform along the tunnel, unlike the propagating wave motion in the sea or in a wave flume. This results in subtle differences between the boundary-layer hydrodynamics of an <b>oscillating</b> <b>water</b> tunnel and of a propagating wave, which may {{have a significant effect}} in the resulting sediment transport. In this paper, we present a zeroth-order analytical model of the turbulent boundary-layer hydrodynamics in an <b>oscillating</b> <b>water</b> tunnel. By using a time-varying eddy viscosity and by accounting for the constraints arising from the tunnel's geometry, the model predicts the <b>oscillating</b> <b>water</b> tunnel hydrodynamics and yields analytical expressions to compute bed shear stresses for asymmetric and skewed waves, both in the absence or presence of an imposed current. These expressions are applied to successfully quantify bedload sediment transport in <b>oscillating</b> <b>water</b> tunnel experiments.

40|$|Model-based {{selection}} of full-scale Wells turbines for ocean wave energy conversion and prediction of their aerodynamic and acoustic performances R Starzmann and T Carolus One {{of the most}} intensively studied principles of harnessing the energy from ocean waves is the <b>oscillating</b> <b>water</b> column device. The <b>oscillating</b> <b>water</b> column converts {{the motion of the}} water waves into a bi-directional airflow, which in turn drives an air turbine. The bi-directional axial Wells turbine as a candidate for <b>oscillating</b> <b>water</b> column power take-off systems was the object of considerable research conducted in the last decades.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} an investigation to the thermodynamics {{of the air}} flow in the air chamber for the <b>oscillating</b> <b>water</b> column wave energy converters, in which the <b>oscillating</b> <b>water</b> surface {{in the water column}} pressurizes or de-pressurises the air in the chamber. To study the thermodynamics and the compressibility of the air in the chamber, a method is developed in this research: the power take-off is replaced with an accepted semi-empirical relationship between the air flow rate and the <b>oscillating</b> <b>water</b> column chamber pressure, and the thermodynamic process is simplified as an isentropic process. This facilitates the use of a direct expression for the work done on the power take-off by the flowing air and the generation of a single differential equation that defines the thermodynamic process occurring inside the air chamber. Solving the differential equation, the chamber pressure can be obtained if the interior water surface motion is known or the chamber volume (thus the interior water surface motion) if the chamber pressure is known. As a result, the effects of the air compressibility can be studied. Examples given in the paper have shown the compressibility, and its effects on the power losses for large <b>oscillating</b> <b>water</b> column devices. peer-reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Sea {{wave energy}} {{is one of}} the high {{potential}} renewable energy sources. The Wells turbine as the main part of <b>Oscillating</b> <b>Water</b> Column energy plant is analyzed in this paper. The Wells turbine uses air flow produced by the pressure change inside the <b>oscillating</b> <b>water</b> column. Efficient energy transformation is achieved with the use of self-rectifying Wells air turbine. Since the tangential force of the rotor acts only in one direction, even though airflow is oscillating, turbine rotates always in the same direction. Series of numerical simulations are performed using software package FLUENT for a wide span of the non-dimensional flow rate coefficient I and employing three different turbulent models. Structured numerical mesh and the application of axisymmetric periodical boundary conditions raised the accuracy of the numerical model while reducing computational load three times compared to the model with the fully meshed domain.

40|$|Wave energy {{converters}} {{based on}} mechanical interactions {{with a solid}} body or the devices builder on <b>oscillating</b> <b>water</b> column movement created by an input pressure variation, can be easily modelled {{in the framework of}} linear theory of free surface perfect fluid flow. In the case of bidimensional devices (e. g. facing the incident wave filed), the theoretical and numerical modelling can be performed beyond the restrictions of linear theory (low wave steepness). The devices can be simulated using non-linear time step methods up to wave breaking limit. In this work, we addressed the simulation of <b>oscillating</b> <b>water</b> column devices, in both linear and non-linear approaches. According to the conclusions established by Maisondieu in 1993, we have initially developed and tested an improvement of a dynamical controller designed to drive a piston wave absorber.

In the first part of the research work, the hydrodynamic performance of OWC wave energy converter has been extensively examined, targeting on a reliable numerical assessment method. In this part of the research work, the application of the air turbine power take-off (PTO) to the OWC device leads to a coupled model of the hydrodynamics and thermodynamics of the OWC wave energy converters, in a manner that under the wave excitation, the varying air volume due to the internal water surface motion creates a reciprocating chamber pressure (alternative positive and negative chamber pressure), whilst the chamber pressure, in turn, modifies the motions of the device and the internal water surface. To do this, the thermodynamics of the air chamber is first examined and applied by including the air compressibility in the <b>oscillating</b> <b>water</b> columns for different types of the air turbine PTOs. The developed thermodynamics is then coupled with the hydrodynamics of the OWC wave energy converters.
