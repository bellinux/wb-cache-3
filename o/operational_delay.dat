Early missiles used liquid-fueled rocket motors. Many liquid-fueled ICBMs could not be kept fueled all the time as the cryogenic fuel liquid oxygen boiled off and caused ice formation, and therefore fueling the rocket was necessary before launch. This procedure was a source of significant <b>operational</b> <b>delay,</b> and might allow the missiles to be destroyed by enemy counterparts before they could be used. To resolve this problem the United Kingdom invented the missile silo that protected the missile from a first strike and also hid fuelling operations underground.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe need {{to balance}} safety and {{operational}} efficiency at intersections requires special attention for accommodating left turn movements. Signalized intersections epitomise this need because unnecessary protection of left turns can significantly increase <b>operational</b> <b>delay.</b> Left turn protection however, increases safety {{and there is}} a need for proper balancing between the conflicting goals of safety and operations. The long time required to collect crash data to evaluate the use of existing warrants render them frequently ineffective and the need for a preliminary design tool to assist in left turn phasing decisions is needed. This research developed a quantitative safety assessment tool that predicts left turn related conflicts and uses them to determine the appropriate phasing scheme for left turns.

A baseline maneuver sequence to retarget from this injection orbit to the desired operational orbit has been designed based upon the expected worst-case 3 -sigma injection and maneuver execution errors. The sequence requires seven maneuvers, including an initial calibration burn, and achieves the operational orbit with the desired ground track pattern in 30 days. A delay sensitivity analysis has been conducted to estimate the allowable <b>operational</b> <b>delay</b> for each maneuver without increasing the total orbit acquisition period. The baseline sequence provides back-ups for a one-revolution delay for each maneuver and one-day delay for most maneuvers.

Subsequently a generalized scheme for architecture implementation for nD cross product is proposed based on this algorithm. Secondly, we show that if 4 D cross product is used as the fundamental operation for formulating nD cross product problem, then exploiting the inherent mathematical symmetry of 4 D cross product it is possible to reduce the total hardware cost of nD cross product significantly at the architecture level (symmetry-based approach).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} two {{stochastic programming}} {{models for the}} allocation of time slots over a network of airports. The proposed models address three key issues. First, they provide an optimization tool to allocate time slots, which takes several operational aspects and airline preferences into account; second, they execute the process on a network of airports; and third they explicitly include uncertainty. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, these are the first models for time slot allocation to consider both the stochastic nature of capacity reductions and the problem's network structure. From a practical viewpoint, the proposed models provide important insights for the allocation of time slots. Specifically, they highlight the tradeoff between the schedule/request discrepancies, i. e., the time difference between allocated time slots and airline requests, and <b>operational</b> <b>delays.</b> Increasing schedule/request discrepancies enables a reduction in <b>operational</b> <b>delays.</b> Moreover, the models are computationally viable. A set of realistic test instances that consider the scheduling of four calendar days on different European airport networks has been solved within reasonable - for the application's context - computation times. In one of our test instances, we were able to reduce the sum of schedule/request discrepancies and <b>operational</b> <b>delays</b> by up to 58 %. This work provides slot coordinators with a valuable decision making tool, and it indicates that the proposed approach is very promising and may lead to relevant monetary savings for airlines and aircraft operators. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims at {{presenting}} {{a framework for}} obtaining and evaluating multiple timetablesin operational conditions on different infrastructure alternatives. Evaluating several differenttimetables, which share characteristics regarding departure frequencies, helps in gettinga more comprehensive picture of how scheduled and <b>operational</b> <b>delays</b> are affected byimprovements or reductions in the infrastructure. In order to flexibly create infrastructure alternatives a script is developed in which differentstation layouts can be defined and expanded into a railway line by connecting stationstogether. This is then compiled to files that RailSys can interpret, thereby facilitating in includingthe infrastructure as a variable in the analysis. Timetables are obtained by definingnominal train paths in a combinatorial approach and simulating these in RailSys in order toget conflict free timetable solutions. A case study is presented where the infrastructure, applied departure frequencies andsuperimposed stochastic delays are varied.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{focuses on}} an {{automated}} batch man-ufacturing system with material-handling robots (MHRs) and material-processing robots (MPRs). In this robotic manufactur-ing system, materials transported by the MHRs are processed by the MPRs. These operations cause a bottleneck in the system. Furthermore, the bottleneck induces congestion of the MHRs. In the system, {{the effect of}} an <b>operational</b> <b>delay</b> due to bottlenecks affects the entire operation. Accordingly, there is an event in which the congestion extends and the system throughput not only fails to increase but also may become worse, even if more robots are used to improve the productivity. For this challenge, we propose a behavior control method for the MHRs to eliminate or ease the congestion that arises from a bottleneck. Each MHR controls its own behavior adequately by using the external force of a virtual damper {{in order not to}} become involved in the congestion. Finally, through a simulation experiment, we show that the proposed control method improves the system throughput and its effectiveness for a more efficient system operation. I...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Energy {{consumption}} {{is a major}} concern in nanoscale CMOS ICs; the power-off operational mode and low voltage circuits have been proposed to alleviate energy dissipation. Static Random Access Memories (SRAMs) are widely used in today’s chips; non-volatile SRAMs (NVSRAMs) have been proposed to preserve data, while providing fast power-on/off speeds. Non-volatile operation is usually accomplished by the use of a Resistive RAM circuit (hence referred to as RRAM); the utilization of a RRAM with an SRAMs not only enables chips to achieve low energy consumption for non-volatile operation, but it also permits to restore data when a restore on power-up is performed (this operation is also commonly referred to as “Instant-on”). This paper presents a novel NVSRAM circuit for “Instant-on” operation and evaluates its performance at nanometric feature sizes. The proposed memory cell consists of a SRAM core (in this case, a 6 T cell) and an Oxide Resistive RRAM circuit (1 T 1 R), thus making a 7 T 1 R scheme. The proposed cell offers better non-volatile performance (in terms of operations such as “Store”, “Power-down ” and “Restore”) when compared with existing non-volatile cells. The scenario of multiple-context configuration is also analyzed. Figures of merit such as energy, <b>operational</b> <b>delay</b> and area are also substantially improved, making the proposed design a better scheme for “Instant-on ” operation...|$|E
40|$|Background: Equipment-related {{incidents}} {{in the operating room}} (OR) can affect quality of care. In this study, the authors determined the occurrence and effects on the care process in a large teaching hospital. - Methods: During a 4 -week period, OR nurses reported equipment-related incidents during surgery procedures in both locations of the hospital. The incidents were reported using a separate form for each incident. A structured analysis (PRISMA) was used to analyse incidents that resulted in serious delays (> 15 min). - Results: Forms were returned for 911 out of 1580 surgeries (57. 7 %). In total, 148 incidents were registered, relating to a total of 29 h and 45 min of extra work. In addition, 12 h and 9 min of <b>operational</b> <b>delay</b> was registered. Most {{incidents in}}volved instruments (46 %) or medical devices (28 %). 68 % occurred during surgery and 32 % during the preparation phase. No direct physical harm was reported, although indirect harm, like longer anaesthesia, did occur and can be defined as an adverse event. 10 % of the incidents led to a delay of over 15 min. For these incidents, ‘management decisions’ (eg, inventory capacity, planning procedure) was the most encountered root cause. Only six out of the 148 incidents found corresponded with the blame-free reporting database. - Conclusions: Equipment-related incidents occurred frequently in the involved hospital sites (up to 15. 9 %) and resulted in some extra work and additional minutes of delay per event. Management decisions have considerable influence on the occurrence of equipment-related incidents. There was serious under-reporting of incidents...|$|E

40|$|In the {{tropical}} area of Veracruz (Mexico) {{the decision of}} {{when and how to}} carry out tillage operations is based on qualitative criteria. It often results in excessive and unnecessary work, energy waste, <b>operational</b> <b>delay,</b> soil exposure to water erosion and soil structural damage. Objective criteria are needed in this area for selecting when and how to do cultivation in order to meet crop and conservation requirements. The workable range of typical soils of the area (Haplic Pheaozems) was quantified by assessing in-field implement effects on the soil structure and measuring the specific energy applied by the tractor-implement combination. This was done over a range of soil moisture contents inside and outside the theoretical friable consistency state of the soils, determined by the shrinkage and plastic limits. Empirical relationships between initial moisture content and the technological result of tillage showed that these results for moist loam and clay soils shifted from optimum to poor at soil water potentials that coincides quite well with the plastic limit. However, as soil was drying out, the implement effect changed from optimum to sub-optimum at soil moisture contents well above the shrinkage limit, so the actual field workable range was smaller than the theoretical friable status of the soils. The minimum input of specific energy to obtain optimum results, was close to the soil water potential where results changed to sub-optimum as soils were drying out. To support decisions for tillage planning and operation, valuable information on workable periods can be obtained by making use of quantified workability thresholds. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V.

This project presents an alternative tool that will supplement local decision making but maintain a full appreciation of the complexity and sophistication of today’s regional model and local traffic impact study methodologies. This alternative method is tailored to the desires of local agencies, which requested a better, faster, and easier way to evaluate land uses and their impact on future traffic demands at the sub-area or project corridor levels. A particular emphasis was placed on scenario planning for currently undeveloped areas. The scenario planning tool was developed using actual land use and roadway information for the communities of Johnston and West Des Moines, Iowa. Both communities used the output from this process to make regular decisions regarding infrastructure investment, design, and land use planning. The City of Johnston case study included forecasting future traffic for the western portion of the city within a 2, 600 -acre area, which included 42 intersections. The City of West Des Moines case study included forecasting future traffic for the city’s western growth area covering over 30, 000 acres and 331 intersections. Both studies included forecasting a. m. and p. m. peak-hour traffic volumes based upon a variety of different land use scenarios. The tool developed took goegraphic information system (GIS) -based parcel and roadway information, converted the data into a graphical spreadsheet tool, allowed the user to conduct trip generation, distribution, and assignment, and then to automatically convert the data into a Synchro roadway network which allows for capacity analysis and visualization.
