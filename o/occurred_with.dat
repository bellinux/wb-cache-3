5|$|Contrary {{to initial}} reports of monogamy, ruffed lemurs {{in the wild}} exhibit {{seasonal}} polygamous breeding behavior, with {{both males and females}} mating with more than one partner within a single season. Mating is not restricted to just community members, but also involves members of neighboring communities. Females mate primarily with males with whom they had affiliative relations prior to mating season, although some matings <b>occurred</b> <b>with</b> roaming males from other communities.|$|E

Daniel Burnham built an architectural plan for Manila which would have transformed it into a modern city.|$|E
5|$|The {{atmosphere}} on Mir {{was similar}} to Earth's. Normal air pressure on the station was 101.3kPa (14.7psi); the same as at sea level on Earth. An Earth-like atmosphere offers benefits for crew comfort, and is much safer than the alternative, a pure oxygen atmosphere, because of increased fire risk such as <b>occurred</b> <b>with</b> Apollo 1.|$|E
5|$|The major {{development}} of {{weapons in the}} early modern and modern periods <b>occurred</b> <b>with</b> firearms, which became progressively more efficient. Gunpowder settled into its standard ratio in the 17th century, and general ballistic technology improved. Initially, iron round shot replaced the earlier stone balls for cannon then, latterly, different types of shot were invented.|$|E

5|$|The medieval {{world was}} a much less urban society than either the Roman Empire or the modern world. The fall of the Roman Empire had caused a catastrophic de-population of the towns and cities that had existed within the Empire. Between the 10th and 12th centuries, however, {{a revival of the}} European city <b>occurred,</b> <b>with</b> an {{increase}} in the urbanisation of society.|$|E
5|$|The orally {{lethal dose}} in humans has been {{reported}} as approximately 1.4 mL/kg of pure ethylene glycol. That is approximately 224 mL (7.6 oz.) of 50% ethylene glycol for an 80kg adult and 56 mL (2 oz.) for a 20kg child. Although survival with medical treatment has <b>occurred</b> <b>with</b> doses much higher than this, death has <b>occurred</b> <b>with</b> 30 mL of the concentrate in an adult. In the EU classification of dangerous substances it is 'harmful' (Xn) while more toxic substances are classified as 'toxic' (T) or 'very toxic' (T+). The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency generally puts substances which are lethal at more than 30 g to adults in Toxicity Class III.|$|E

5|$|Volcanism in this {{chain is}} calc-alkaline, {{yielding}} both andesite, dacite, and rhyolite. Three million years ago, {{a change in}} the chemistry of volcanism <b>occurred,</b> <b>with</b> an increased content of potassium in the rocks.

5|$|A {{weakening}} trend soon <b>occurred,</b> <b>with</b> it weakening to a Category1 hurricane {{early on}} September15. About four days later, the hurricane completed its cyclonic loop and then headed west-northwestward. The system weakened to {{a tropical storm}} early on September20. During the next few days, the storm decelerated and turned westward. Late on September22, it weakened to a tropical depression. The depression continued westward, until dissipating at 1800UTC on September23, while located about 745 miles (1,200km) east-southeast of Bermuda.|$|E
5|$|After {{a troubled}} pre-production, with The Halcyon Company {{acquiring}} the {{rights for the}} franchise from Andrew G. Vajna and Mario Kassar and several writers working on the screenplay, filming began in May 2008 in New Mexico and ran for 77 days. Terminator Salvation was released on May 21, 2009, in the United States and Canada, followed by early June releases in the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. Warner Bros. handled the North American release while Columbia Pictures handled the international release. The film grossed over $371 million worldwide and was met with mixed reviews. A reboot of the film franchise <b>occurred</b> <b>with</b> the release of Terminator Genisys in 2015.|$|E

40|$|The verb "play" {{can take}} nouns expressing {{various kinds of}} sport as its object: play tennis, play baseball, etc. But not all can <b>occur</b> <b>with</b> "play": *play boxing, *play camping. (*shows an {{ungrammatical}} sentence.) In this paper, first we studied the semantic change of "play" diachronically. Next we divided various kinds of sport into two groups and analyzed them: one {{is a group of}} nouns expressing sports which can <b>occur</b> <b>with</b> "play", the other is a group of those which cannot. As a result, we found that almost all kinds of sport <b>occurring</b> <b>with</b> "play" had six features; while meeting the six features, the noun expressing the sport could occur in the object position of "play". Therefore we suggest that the six features are the semantic restrictions of nouns expressing sports <b>occurring</b> <b>with</b> "play". Also we add {{that in the case of}} having a shortage of two features and over, the noun expressing the sport could not <b>occur</b> <b>with</b> "play"...|$|R
30|$|It {{is found}} that the {{decomposition}} of NPK fertilizers <b>occurs</b> <b>with</b> the strong exothermal effect and NP fertilizers decomposition <b>occurs</b> <b>with</b> the endothermal effect.

5|$|Although a clear {{relative}} to the common hippopotamus, H. lemerlei was much smaller, {{roughly the size of}} the modern pygmy hippopotamus. The largest specimens were 6.5ft (2 m) long and 2.5ft (0.7 m) tall. The ancestors of H. lemerlei may have been full-sized hippos who shrunk through the process of insular dwarfism. A similar dwarfing process has <b>occurred</b> <b>with</b> hippos in many Mediterranean islands such as with the Cretan dwarf hippopotamus or the Cyprus dwarf hippopotamus.|$|E
5|$|An {{air attack}} from the Formidable had {{disabled}} the cruiser Pola and Iachino, unaware of Cunningham's pursuing battlefleet, ordered a squadron of cruisers and destroyers to return and protect the Pola. Cunningham, meanwhile, was joining up with Pridham-Wippell's cruiser squadron. Throughout the day several chases and sorties <b>occurred</b> <b>with</b> no overall victor. None of the Italian ships were equipped for night fighting, and when night fell, they made to return to Taranto. The British battlefleet equipped with radar detected the Italians shortly after 22:00. In a pivotal moment in naval warfare during the Second World War, the battleships Barham, Valiant and Warspite opened fire on two Italian cruisers at only 3,800 yards (3.5km), destroying them in only five minutes.|$|E

5|$|Descent 3 {{takes place}} in a science fiction setting of the Solar System where the player is cast as Material Defender MD1032, a {{mercenary}} working for a corporation called the Post Terran Mining Corporation (PTMC). The game begins moments after the events of Descent II, with the Material Defender escaping the destruction of a planetoid where he was clearing PTMC's robots infected by an alien virus. He was about to return to Earth to collect his reward, but a malfunction <b>occurred</b> <b>with</b> the prototype warp drive in the ship he was piloting, making it drift towards the Sun's atmosphere. At the very last moment, the Material Defender is rescued via a tractor beam by an organization known as the Red Acropolis Research Team.|$|E
5|$|During the Kimmeridgian, Europe {{was covered}} by the shallow inland Tethys Ocean, with exposed landmasses being a series of {{scattered}} archipelagos. Highly variable sea levels supported a highly diverse insular crocodilian fauna, with biodiversity (that of atoposaurids in particular) being driven strongly by allopatric speciation. The two species of Knoetschkesuchus were part of similar faunas, in both of which they functioned as small predators ecologically partitioned from the other contemporary crocodilians; {{it is likely that}} these faunas originated through dispersal over larger landmasses. A similar faunal exchange <b>occurred</b> <b>with</b> the Wessex-Weald Basin of England.|$|E
