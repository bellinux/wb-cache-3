40|$|Cellobiose {{dehydrogenase}} (CDH) is {{a versatile}} bioelectrocatalyst lately at focus {{due to its}} sugar <b>oxidising</b> <b>properties</b> in combination with its inherent ability for direct electron transfer communication with electrodes {{making it possible to}} be used in bioanodes in the enzymatic fuel cells (EFCs), self-powered biosensors, and biosupercapacitors. During the last 20 years, many new nanomaterials and hybrid nanocomposites have been developed and employed in combination with various oxidoreductases, such as CDH, to increase the overall performance of electrical devices (e. g. biosensors, EFCs etc.). It has also been shown that nanomaterials can be further chemically modified to facilitate electron transfer pathways between the biocomponent and electrodes. Both carbon and metal based nanomaterials and combinations thereof have been used together with CDH to improve the performance. In this review, we resume all the findings related to the influence of effective nanostructuration to improve the electron transfer communication with electrodes yielding higher sensitivity of biosensors or increasing the power output of EFC based on CDH from different sources...|$|R

In order to better understand these electro- optical effects, we designed a more precise protocol of measuring this data. This procedure includes manipulating polarizing filters and measuring the transmitted light intensities with a camera attached to the microscope. From this, we can more successfully analyze the electroclinic effects of liquid crystal displays.
