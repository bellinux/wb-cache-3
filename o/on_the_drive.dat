5|$|Boston College {{began its}} second {{possession}} of the fourth quarter knowing it had to score a touchdown to tie the game. Quarterback Matt Ryan had his best success of the day, connecting on sevenof tenpasses during the drive and picking up 58yards. All of the Eagles' yardage <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> came through the air, and with 2:25 remaining, the Eagles found themselves at the Virginia Tech 14-yard line. Facing a fourth down and needing fouryards for a first down, Matt Ryan fell back to attempt a pass. The throw was intercepted by Virginia Tech's Vince Hall.|$|E

The 11th Brigade, independent of the 3rd Division, assumed control of the drive to the north, while the 3rd Division concentrated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> south towards Buin, where the main Japanese force was concentrated. Rotating his brigades, the division's commander, Major General William Bridgeford, advanced south from Torokina towards the Puriata river.

Roberts then scored the Rams' only other points on their next possession with his 31-yard field goal. Early in the fourth quarter, Trey DePriest both forced and recovered a Garrett Grayson fumble. On the next play, Alabama scored on a 30-yard McCarron touchdown pass to DeAndrew White for a 24–6 lead. The Crimson Tide then made the final score 31–6 with a 15-yard Blake Sims touchdown pass to Chris Black.

5|$|After {{receiving}} the opening kickoff, Ball State's first drive stalled, and it ultimately went three-and-out. Their punter, Kyle Schmidt, managed only 24 {{yards on the}} punt, and gave Arkansas State the ball at Ball State's 36-yard line. Arkansas State failed {{to capitalize on the}} good field position, however, missing a 34-yard field goal attempt. Subsequently, the teams exchanged punts. After being pinned at their own 11-yard line, the Cardinals embarked on a 14-play, 89-yard drive that featured six rushes by Jahwan Edwards for a total of 44 yards, including one 22-yard rush. Also <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>drive,</b> Keith Wenning completed four of five passes, three of which were to Willie Snead, including a 9-yard touchdown pass that was the first score of the game.

On the next drive, Cyrus Jones intercepted a Manziel pass in the end zone for a touchback and an Alabama possession. McCarron then threw his third touchdown pass on the game from 51yards to Kenny Bell and gave the Crimson Tide their first lead of the game, 21–14.

40|$|A novel type of {{integral}} {{squeeze film}} damper (ISFD) is proposed to reduce and isolate vibration excitations of the gear system through bearing to the foundation. Four ISFD designs were tested experimentally with an open first-grade spur gear system. Vibration reduction characteristics were experimentally studied at different speeds for cases where ISFD elastic damping supports were simultaneously installed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> driving and <b>driven</b> shafts, installed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>driven</b> shaft, or only installed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> driving shaft. Experimental {{results show that the}} ISFD elastic damping support can effectively reduce shock vibration of the gear system. Additionally, resonant modulation in gear shafts caused by meshing impact was significantly reduced. Different vibration amplitudes of gear shafts with ISFD installed only on driven or driving shafts were compared. Results indicated that vibration reduction is better when ISFD is only installed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>driven</b> shaft than <b>on</b> <b>the</b> driving shaft...|$|R

The Tide struck first, driving 47 yards with the opening possession before Leigh Tiffin kicked a 48-yard field goal and a 3–0 lead. Following a Florida three and out on their first possession, Alabama responded with an 8-play, 76-yard touchdown drive. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>drive,</b> Greg McElroy completed key passes to Colin Peek and Marquis Maze and Mark Ingram rushed for 37 yards and the touchdown in taking a 9–0 lead following a missed extra point.

5|$|Down {{by three}} {{to start the}} second half, Georgia responded {{with a pair of}} touchdowns and took a 21–10 lead early in the third quarter. The first was scored on a three-yard Todd Gurley run that {{completed}} a 75-yard drive that opened the quarter. The second came on a special teams play <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> that ensued, when Cornelius Washington blocked a 49-yard Cade Foster field goal attempt that was recovered by Alec Ogletree and returned 55 yards for a touchdown and a 21–10 lead. Alabama responded on their next possession with a four-play, 77-yard drive that was capped by a 10-yard T. J. Yeldon touchdown run followed with Yeldon converting the two-point conversion on a two-yard run and made the score 21–18.

5|$|During a {{visit to}} a {{division}} command post on 24 August 1944 Strachwitz was badly injured in an automobile accident. The vehicle rolled over and the other occupants were killed. He sustained a fractured skull, and broken ribs, legs, arms and hands, and he was in critical condition. He was immediately taken to a field hospital, before being transferred to a hospital at Riga. He was then flown to Breslau in a Junkers Ju 52 for further treatment, where he was visited by his son, Harti. The doctors informed him that it would take him eight months to recover fully. Refusing to accept this, he worked out his own rehabilitation plan, and after seven days, Strachwitz signed himself out of the hospital, officially having himself transferred to the hospital at Oppeln. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> back he lost consciousness at almost every turn, arriving at his manor in Alt Siedel on 28 November 1944.

This time Landon Collins made the play at the 11-yard line and returned it 89-yards for a touchdown and a 35–0 halftime lead. Tennessee opened the second half with their first points on a 37-yard Michael Palardy field goal that made the score 35–3.

5|$|Skyline Drive was {{originally}} lined with miles of chestnut log guardrails. However, the guardrails rotted and were removed in the 1950s and not replaced.

In 1983, the Federal Highway Administration began work to replace several of the original stone walls <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> with concrete walls that used the original stone as a veneer.
