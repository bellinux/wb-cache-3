5|$|A second joint {{appearance}} {{took place}} in Beverly Hills. According to Nixon campaign adviser Bill Arnold, Douglas arrived late, while Nixon was already speaking. Nixon ostentatiously looked at his watch, provoking laughter from the audience. The laughter recurred as Nixon, sitting behind Douglas as she spoke, fidgeted to indicate his disapproval <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> saying; she appeared bewildered at the laughter. Douglas concluded her remarks and Nixon rose to speak again, {{but she did not}} stay to listen.|$|E

One of the first generation of opera singers to appear widely in recordings and on the radio, her performances, now reappearing on both compact disc and video, have provided a lasting testament to her ability. From these recordings, future generations will be able to form some impression <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> like as a singer and to understand what made her unique as an artist.|$|E
25|$|In the English version, Bast is a cat 'Goddess' who was {{rejected}} after rumor was spread {{that she was}} an evil monster. In the original, she is just a monsterish half-breed named Myohyang; discarded by family because <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was.</b> She {{plays a key role in}} the story as one of the main 'bad guys'. She teams up with Yuri (Ryang's psycho-ex) to plot to take down Fanta and Ryang, though she comments to Yuri at one point that she somewhat likes Fanta, but has to do what her 'mastuh' wants done. Her 'mastuh' is in fact Lady Oran/Oreadia.|$|E

500|$|... "Mulder and Scully" [...] {{is a song}} by Catatonia, {{released}} as a single from their 1998 album, International Velvet. The song makes direct reference to fictional FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), the two main characters of the popular sci-fi TV series The X-Files who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In an interview Cerys Matthews, co-writer of the song, explained that while {{she was not a}} serious fan of the show, the basic premise of the series matched the conceit <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> trying to express.|$|E
500|$|I {{needed to}} {{maintain}} a very strong relationship with Tommy [...] During that period, {{the beginning of their}} end, I had to stay away more than normal from her because she was going through a rough time. She felt that shutting her relationship with Tommy was also a cleansing of who she was. She felt that part <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> dropping was the shmaltzy pop singer ballad kind of stuff he was adamant about. I had to make my exit and say 'Mariah, you need to redefine yourself, that's fine. I'm here doing what I do and if and when you want to come back and do it again, I'm here.|$|E
500|$|In Nashville, Swift {{worked with}} {{experienced}} Music Row songwriters such as Troy Verges, Brett Beavers, Brett James, Mac McAnally, and The Warren Brothers. She eventually formed a lasting {{working relationship with}} Liz Rose. They began meeting for two-hour writing sessions every Tuesday afternoon after school. Rose thought that the sessions were [...] "some of the easiest I've ever done. Basically, I was just her editor. She'd write {{about what happened in}} school that day. She had such a clear vision <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> trying to say. And she'd come in with the most incredible hooks". Swift was signed by the Sony/ATV Tree publishing house, but left RCA Records when she was 14. She later recalled: [...] "I genuinely felt that I was running out of time. I wanted to capture these years of my life on an album while they still represented what I was going through".|$|E
50|$|The great {{virtue of}} her {{philosophical}} writing {{is that it}} is enactive, leaving the reader with the very experience, and, therefore, some real understanding <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> discussing.

500|$|Lopez {{began working}} on a [...] "collection of songs" [...] in 2011, unaware <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> [...] "going to do with them". At the time, she was {{deciding}} whether she wanted to release a greatest hits album or a new studio album. Lopez stated {{that when it comes}} time to make an album, she doesn't sit down and write for the entire thing. She revealed that she is always working on new music and that her albums [...] "happen organically" [...] when she has recorded enough material. Lopez explained: [...] "I don't ever stop. I keep going with it. These records, like 'Follow the Leader,' [...] they just kind of came about. It wasn't something like, 'Oh, I'm going to sit down and make a record right now.'" [...] Among the songs she recorded, two were chosen to be included on Dance Again... The Hits: [...] "Dance Again" [...] and [...] "Goin' In".|$|E
500|$|One {{noticeable}} {{feature of}} the work is its near-total lack of names. This is because Virgil never used Hebrew names like [...] "Jesus" [...] and [...] "Mary", and thus Proba was limited in terms <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> able to work with. To compensate, the poet used [...] "general and vague words such as mater, dominus deus, pater, magister, [...] vates" [...] to designate key characters. In places, this handicap interferes with readability (according to G. Ronald Kastner and Ann Millin, [...] "Necessary passives and circumlocutions brought about by the ... absences in [...] of appropriate terminology render the text impassable at times"). An exception to the poem's lack of names is found in a reference to Moses, whom Proba refers to by invoking the name [...] "Musaeus". According to the classicist Sigrid Schottenius Cullhed, [...] "Proba may have used the name Musaeus for the Judeo-Christian prophet, since it was often believed from the Hellenistic era onward that Mousaios was the Greek name for Moses".|$|E
500|$|During Russ' trial, Mercedes {{decided to}} go to the court to testify for him due to Nancy Hayton (Jessica Fox), who {{explained}} to Mercedes that her sister died because Justin Burton (Chris Fountain) was [...] "too gutless to come forward and tell the truth". This encouraged Mercedes to [...] "take a long, hard look at herself", and she realised that she was doing the same thing in the situation with Warren. On her way to the court however, Mercedes was [...] "all over the place". According to Metcalfe, everyone was shocked when Mercedes walked into the courtroom. She said that Mercedes was unsure <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> going to tell the court, [...] "but her alibi is vital to Warren's case - his fate lies in her hands". Metcalfe said that even if Mercedes and Russ ended their relationship, which they did shortly after she confessed the truth, would not matter because she believed that it would not take Mercedes [...] "long before she goes back to her old ways" [...] because [...] "that's just the type of person she is - Mercedes likes playing the field and having fun, and no man's going to change her" ...|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} {{for the song}} was {{directed}} by long-time collaborator Melina Matsoukas and Knowles under the alias Bee-Z. The video took two-three weeks of preparation and one day to film in Los Angeles on Mount Olympus. The main set of the video was a house owned by a wealthy 95-year-old man who allowed Knowles and Matsoukas to use his house and collectible cars for the video shoot. During an interview with USA Today on January 28, 2010, Knowles announced {{that she would be}} taking a break from her music career saying [...] "to live life, to be inspired by things again". She was then inspired to shoot a music video for the bonus track. In an interview with People magazine in August 2010, Knowles explained: [...] "I came up with the concept for that video because lately I decided to take a break, and I‚Äôve been home, being a wife. I figured it could be nice to give a little wink toward the things that I‚Äôve been doing, so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm a housewife in the video." [...] However, she explained that the video is [...] "an exaggerated, over-the-top version" [...] <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> doing right then, just living her life, being a woman at home, relaxing and trying to enjoy her life other than performing and creating music. For instance, dusting off her Grammys and getting under the hood of a car while wearing six-inch heels are not regular occurrences for Knowles.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the success}} of the singer's 1993 career best-selling album Music Box, Carey and her {{management}} at Columbia Records began devising ideas and strategies for subsequent projects. Carey's then-husband, Tommy Mottola, head of Columbia's parent label Sony Music Entertainment, began mapping out possible follow ups for the singer during the pinnacle years of her career. During initial discussions regarding the thought of doing a Christmas-themed album with Carey and her writing partner of over four years, Walter Afanasieff, fear arose that it was not commercially expedient or wise to release holiday music at the peak of one's career, as it was more often equated with a release towards the end of a musician's waning career. Afanasieff recalled his sentiments during initial discussions for a holiday record: [...] "Back then, you didn't have a lot of artists with Christmas albums. It wasn't a known science at all back then, and there was nobody who did new, big Christmas songs. So we were going to release it as kind of an everyday, 'Hey, you know, we're putting out a Christmas album. No big deal.'" [...] Ultimately, with Mottola's persistence and Carey's initiative to be a [...] "risk-taker" [...] as Afanasieff put it, the song and its parent album, Merry Christmas, began taking form in early-mid 1994. Recording for the album began in June, while the Carey-Afanasieff songwriting duo penned [...] "All I Want for Christmas Is You" [...] in late August. Often referencing herself a festive person and demonstrating a usual penchant for her love of all things Christmas, Carey began decorating the home she shared with Mottola in upstate New York (which also came equipped with a personal recording studio) with Christmas ornaments and other holiday-inspired trinkets. In doing so, Carey felt she could capture the essence and spirit <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> singing and make her vocal performance and delivery more emotive and authentic. The songwriting pair carved out the chords, structure and melody for the song in just a quarter of an hour: [...] "It's definitely not 'Swan Lake,'‚Äâ' admits Afanasieff. 'But that's why it's so popular ‚Äî because it's so simple and palatable!". At first, Afanasieff admitted that he was puzzled and [...] "blanched" [...] as to where Carey wanted to take the melody and vocal scales, though she was [...] "adamant" [...] in her direction for the song. In an interview with Billboard, Afanasieff described the type of relationship he and Carey shared in the studio and as songwriters for the song and in general: ...|$|E

However, their pitches were not helped by Nargis, who lost track <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> saying, even snapping at the buyers, and the calendar received criticism for being irrelevant to the charity and for having the dates printed too small to make usable. Despite these issues, all three retailers made orders. Meanwhile, Invicta decided on a calendar featuring [...] "fun" [...] photos of children dressed up in various costumes. While the calendar's design was criticised, and Mani's early pitches were extremely poor, the team received a large order from one retailer that effectively earned them victory.|$|E

When it was pointed out to the judge that Anderson was the publisher, he declared that he was sure [...] "she didn‚Äôt know the significance <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> publishing".
