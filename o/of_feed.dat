For this purpose shepherds may use herding dogs in this effort, with a highly bred herding ability. Sheep are food-oriented, and association of humans with regular feeding often results in sheep soliciting people for food.

5|$|A {{major problem}} was that of loss <b>of</b> <b>feed</b> {{material}} and product. Only 1 part in 5,825 of the feed material became finished product. About 90 percent was splattered over the feed bottles or vacuum tanks. The problem was particularly acute with the enriched feed of the Beta calutrons. Extraordinary {{efforts were made to}} recover product, including burning the carbon receiver liners to recover the uranium in them. Despite everything, some 17.4 percent of Alpha product and 5.4 percent of Beta product was lost. Frank Spedding from the Manhattan Project's Ames Laboratory and Philip Baxter from the British Mission were sent to advise on improvements to recovery methods. The death of a worker from exposure to phosgene also prompted a search for a safer production process.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Nursing {{intervention}} is nursing action with a supportive and educative approach done by nurses cooperating with families in overcoming {{the problems of}} nursing family. The {{aim of the research}} was to explain the effect of nursing intervention through family pathnership toward behavior in practice <b>of</b> <b>feeding</b> pattern on infant of age 6 – 24 months for nuclear and extended family, including the breastfeeding (ASI), PASI, soft food, family food, snacks, and way <b>of</b> <b>feeding.</b> Method: The design of the research was experimental. The sample of the research was ninety six (96) samples, which was chosen with simple random sampling. The sample was then divided into two parts of family in Kenjeran District and Bulak Surabaya, namely nuclear family and extended family. The variables measured were breastfeeding, PASI, soft food, family food, and a way <b>of</b> <b>feeding</b> through interviewing and observation. The data analysis used was Mann Whitney U. Result: Result showed that effect of nursing interventions on the style <b>of</b> <b>feeding</b> containing <b>of</b> giving PASI (p = 0. 003), soft food (p = 0. 005), family food (p = 0. 00), snacks (p = 0. 034), and way <b>of</b> <b>feeding</b> (p = 0. 00). Those effects can be shown with the increasing of frequency and way <b>of</b> <b>feeding</b> before and after intervention. Discussion: The conclusion is nursing intervention through the supportive and educative approach as the form of actions on families with problems on the pattern <b>of</b> <b>feeding</b> has the influence on the practice <b>of</b> <b>feeding</b> pattern. The increasing <b>of</b> <b>feeding</b> frequency shows the cognitive and behavioral change on the practice <b>of</b> <b>feeding</b> pattern which can possibly improve the status of infants nutrient...|$|R

The distribution <b>of</b> <b>feeding</b> trees used by the group was significantly different from the distribution of the same tree species in the botanical plots (&Chi; 2 = 74.3, df = 9, p< 0.001), thus indicating that large feeding trees are a critical key component for the survival of Siberut macaques.|$|R
5|$|Although the MP 40 was {{generally}} reliable, a major weakness was its 32-round magazine. Unlike the double-column, dual-feed magazine insert {{found on the}} Thompson M1921-28 variants, the MP 40 used a double-column, single-feed insert. The single-feed insert resulted in increased friction against the remaining cartridges moving upwards towards the feed lips, occasionally resulting in feed failures; this problem was exacerbated {{by the presence of}} dirt or other debris. Another problem was that the magazine was also sometimes misused as a handhold. This could cause the weapon to malfunction when hand pressure on the magazine body caused the magazine lips {{to move out of the}} line <b>of</b> <b>feed,</b> since the magazine well did not keep the magazine firmly locked. German soldiers were trained to grasp either the handhold on the underside of the weapon or the magazine housing with the supporting hand to avoid feed malfunctions.|$|E
5|$|Even a {{slightly}} dehydrated horse is {{at higher risk}} of developing impaction colic. Additionally, dehydration can lead to weight loss because the horse cannot produce adequate amounts of saliva, thus decreasing the amount <b>of</b> <b>feed</b> and dry forage consumed. Thus, {{it is especially important}} for horse owners to encourage their horses to drink when there is a risk of dehydration; when horses are losing a great deal of water in hot weather due to strenuous work, or in cold weather due to horses' natural tendency to drink less when in a cold environment. To encourage drinking, owners may add electrolytes to the feed, additives to make the water especially palatable (such as apple juice), or, when it is cold, to warm the water so that it is not at a near-freezing temperature.|$|E
5|$|Several {{measures}} {{can be taken}} to control infection in aquaculture once an S.iniae outbreak has been confirmed. Decreasing the quantity <b>of</b> <b>feed</b> given to fish has been shown to reduce mortality rates, as the uptake of bacteria in water is expedited by feeding. Decreasing the density of the fish stock increases survival by reducing injury to fish and lowering the general stress level in the population. Lowering the water temperature and keeping optimal oxygen levels has also been shown to reduce stress to fish and inhibit bacterial growth.|$|E

5|$|Smith's metallurgists {{found ways}} of {{fabricating}} boron, producing beryllium bricks, and heat-treating steel. They {{also had to}} work with uranium. Frank Spedding had developed a large-scale process for producing pure uranium metal at the Ames Laboratory which was fine for producing tons <b>of</b> <b>feed</b> for the nuclear reactors, but enriched uranium could not be handled in this way, as it would form a critical mass. Smith was initially asked to produce cubes of uranium hydride, which he did, but the 1950s uranium hydride bomb tests were found to be inefficient, and the idea was set aside for the duration, although further work was carried out after the war. By July 1944, they were producing pure uranium metal in 200g amounts with a newly devised process.|$|E
5|$|Worldwide, more {{chickens}} {{are kept}} {{than any other}} type of poultry, with over 50 billion birds being raised each year as a source of meat and eggs. Traditionally, such birds would have been kept extensively in small flocks, foraging during the day and housed at night. This is still the case in developing countries, where the women often make important contributions to family livelihoods through keeping poultry. However, rising world populations and urbanization have led to the bulk of production being in larger, more intensive specialist units. These are often situated close to where the feed is grown or near to where the meat is needed, and result in cheap, safe food being made available for urban communities. Profitability of production depends very much on the price <b>of</b> <b>feed,</b> which has been rising. High feed costs could limit further development of poultry production.|$|E
5|$|Animal {{husbandry}} has {{a significant}} impact on the world environment. It is responsible for somewhere between 20 and 33% of the fresh water usage in the world, and livestock, and the production <b>of</b> <b>feed</b> for them, occupy about a third of the earth's ice-free land. Livestock production is a contributing factor in species extinction, desertification, and habitat destruction. Animal agriculture contributes to species extinction in various ways. Habitat is destroyed by clearing forests and converting land to grow feed crops and for animal grazing, while predators and herbivores are frequently targeted and hunted because of a perceived threat to livestock profits; for example, animal husbandry is responsible for up to 91% of the deforestation in the Amazon region. In addition, livestock produce greenhouse gases. Cows produce some 570 million cubic metres of methane per day. Livestock is responsible for 65% of all human-related emissions of the powerful and long-lived greenhouse gas nitrous oxide. As a result, ways of mitigating animal husbandry's environmental impact are being studied. Strategies include using biogas from manure.|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate the effect of time <b>of</b> initiation <b>of</b> <b>feeding</b> after hatching and influence of dietary ascorbic supplementation during realimentation on productivity, carcass characteristics and mortality of Ross 308 broiler chickens. The study was a factorial arrangement in a complete randomized design. Six hundred and seventy five unsexed Ross 308 broiler chickens with an initial weight of 32 ± 2 g per bird were assigned to 15 treatments in a 3 (times <b>of</b> initiation <b>of</b> <b>feeding)</b> x 5 (ascorbic acid supplemental levels) factorial arrangement with three replications, each having 15 birds each. The experimental diets were isocaloric and isonitrogenous but with different ascorbic acid supplementation levels. Ascorbic acid supplementation started three days after hatching. More than 50 % of the birds died between one and three days of age when initiation <b>of</b> <b>feeding</b> after hatching was above 36 hours. Time <b>of</b> initiation <b>of</b> <b>feeding</b> above 36 hours of hatching resulted in lower (p 0. 05) on <b>feed</b> intake <b>of</b> the bird's irrespective of time <b>of</b> initiation <b>of</b> <b>feeding</b> after hatching. It is concluded that time <b>of</b> initiation <b>of</b> <b>feeding</b> above 36 hours after hatching is not desirable, mainly because of its effect on mortality. However, the beneficial effect of ascorbic acid supplementation could be exploited in reducing mortality rate and improving growth rates in broiler chickens subjected to delayed initiation <b>of</b> <b>feeding</b> after hatching...|$|R

40|$|We {{are what}} we eat. There are three aspects of feeding: what, when, and how much. These aspects {{represent}} the quantity (how much) and quality (what and when) <b>of</b> <b>feeding.</b> The quantitative aspect <b>of</b> <b>feeding</b> has been studied extensively, because weight is primarily determined by the balance between caloric intake and expenditure. In contrast, less {{is known about the}} mechanisms that regulate the qualitative aspects <b>of</b> <b>feeding,</b> although they also significantly impact the control of weight and health. However, two aspects <b>of</b> <b>feeding</b> quality relevant to weight loss and weight regain are discussed in this review: macronutrient-based diet selection (what) and feeding pattern (when). This review covers the importance of these two factors in controlling weight and health, and the central mechanisms that regulate them. The relatively limited and fragmented knowledge on these topics indicates that we lack an integrated understanding of the qualitative aspects <b>of</b> <b>feeding</b> behavior. To promote better understanding of weight control, research efforts must focus more on the mechanisms that control the quality and quantity <b>of</b> <b>feeding</b> behavior.
