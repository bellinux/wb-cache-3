[...] Under a law of 1970, in the upper secondary school system “gymnasium,” “fackskola” and vocational “yrkesskola” were integrated to form one school with 3 sectors (arts and social science, technical and natural sciences, economic and commercial). In 1975, a law was passed that established free admission to universities. A number of reforms were also carried out to enhance workers' rights. An employment protection Act of 1974 introduced rules regarding consultation with unions, notice periods, and grounds for dismissal, together with priority rules for dismissals and re-employment in case of redundancies. That same year, work-environment improvement grants were introduced and made available to modernising firms “conditional upon the presence of union-appointed ‘safety stewards’ to review the introduction of new technology with regard to {{the health and safety of}} workers.” In 1976, an Act on co-determination at work was introduced that allowed unions to be consulted at various levels within companies before major changes were enforced that would affect employees, while management had to negotiate with labour for joint rights in all matters concerning <b>organisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>work,</b> hiring and firing, and key decisions affecting the workplace.|$|E

He became known to Hansen through the Coates family's connection with Joseph Fels, who had worked with Lansbury in the <b>organisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> schemes to assist the unemployed. In 1889 Lansbury had acted as agent for Jane Cobden when she was elected to the London County Council, and was known to Emmeline Pankhurst who had campaigned for him at Walworth during the 1895 general election.

40|$|In {{sociology}} of organisation, {{as a special}} branch of {{sociology of}} work, prevailing opinions today are {{those that do not}} separate <b>organisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> from globalisation processes. No matter whether globalisation processes are seen from optimistic, pessimistic, or skeptical point of view, the fact that globalisation processes do exist in modern societies and that they do influence transformation of <b>organisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> is not disputable. Globalisation processes imposed distribution of risk, instead of earlier interior processes, which were happening within the frame of distribution of goods (and services) among agents in processes of work. Transformation of <b>organisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> has been happening in the direction of becoming more changeable, adaptable and temporary. Although on the path of transformation of <b>organisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> resistance can be seen, which come from prevailing bureaucratic structures and relations, globalisation processes “put” into them some dominant neo-liberal values. As value basis of these processes are mostly seen in the form of neo-liberal ideology, its influence to transformation of <b>organisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> cannot be neglected; behind each ideology is a function of “protection” of certain social agents. Neo-liberal ideology “makes sense” of changes of <b>organisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> in the way that it gives them legitimacy of “promoters” of globalisation processes, in the centre of which is the struggle for profit on the international market. This is the reason why globalisation processes appear as a good (international) frame for spreading of neo-liberal ideology, as like in economically high developed societies as in societies of post-socialistic transition. Neo -liberal ideology does not care much for characteristics of other aspects of work, which concern content of work and position of agents of work in its organisation. In accordance with neo-liberal ideology, today we can identify some influences of globalisation processes to organisation of work: organisation is getting smaller, more equal distribution of power in organisation and cutting off “auxiliary” functions of organisation...|$|E
