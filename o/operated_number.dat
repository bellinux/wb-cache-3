40|$|This study {{examined}} the effect of farm size on the mortality and survival of Eastern Finnish farms in the late 1990 s. Three different dimensions of farm size (i. e. hectares <b>operated,</b> <b>number</b> of milk cows, and hectares of forest) were compared. Data were extracted from administrative records and covered all 4, 527 active farms in North Karelia from 1995 to 1998. Results {{did not support the}} “disappearing middle size” hypothesis presented by Weiss (1999). Farm size distributions were not bimodal. No empirical evidence was found of a process of polarisation into two “centres of attraction”. As a whole, the analysis provides some support for the conclusion that the size of forest holding as measured by hectares of forest owned by farm does not have an independent effect on the likelihood of survival. Its contribution depends on the other variables in the model...|$|E

50|$|A five-axled, metre gauge, {{steam engine}} with the Luttermöller system was {{procured}} {{by the private}} South Harz Railway (Südharz-Eisenbahn; Braunlage - Walkenried - Tanne) in 1928 from Orenstein & Koppel with <b>operating</b> <b>number</b> 61.It proved itself so well on the winding route, that in 1930 two Mallet locomotives, built in 1925, were converted to the Luttermöller system by Henschel (<b>operating</b> <b>numbers</b> 56 and 57). Henschel had to obtain a licence from Orenstein & Koppel to use Luttermöller axles.|$|R
50|$|The DB and DR {{locomotives}} had <b>operating</b> <b>numbers</b> 42 001-2810 and 42 5000. However {{they did}} not run consecutively and there were gaps.|$|R

50|$|The Deutsche Reichsbahn {{took over}} four {{examples}} from the Bavarian State Railways, which had survived World War I and gave them the <b>operating</b> <b>numbers</b> 56 401-404. They continued in service until 1927.|$|R
50|$|The firm of Krauss-Maffei {{initially}} delivered 13 {{engines in}} 1951 and a further 5 from 1955 to 1956. The first engine, with <b>operating</b> <b>number</b> 65 001, was retired {{as early as}} 1966.|$|R
50|$|With the {{exception}} of Bavarian classes, new locomotives built after 1923 were delivered from the outset with their new <b>operating</b> <b>numbers.</b> The actual renumbering of older engines did not begin until 1926.|$|R

50|$|In 1937-1938, {{locomotive}} 242 (serial no 1614) was rebuilt as a 2-4-4-0 tender locomotive at the SM {{workshop in}} Divinópolis, MG. At {{the completion of}} this rebuild, the locomotive's <b>operating</b> <b>number</b> was changed to 330.|$|R
50|$|On the {{introduction}} of the DR's new EDP numbering scheme in 1970 the engine was given <b>operating</b> <b>number</b> 99 7222, which she carries to this day because the HSB has retained the DR numbering from 1970.|$|R

50|$|Like {{the leading}} E used with {{electric}} locomotives, these engines were allocated the letter V for Verbrennungslokomotive (internal combustion locomotive).

50|$|All {{examples}} {{were taken}} {{on by the}} Deutsche Reichsbahn and retired between 1922 and 1924. According to the provisional renumbering plan of 1923 {{they were to be}} allocated <b>operating</b> <b>numbers</b> 34 7501 to 7513, but they did not appear in the final renumbering plan.|$|R
50|$|Numbers 1-200 were {{reserved}} for steam railbuses. <b>Operating</b> <b>numbers</b> were supplemented {{by the name}} of the Reichsbahn railway division in which they were stationed.

50|$|In 1952, {{the firm}} of Henschel rebuilt {{locomotives}} 52 893 and 52 894 with Franco-Crosti economisers (Abgasvorwärmer).
