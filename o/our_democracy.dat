But he should not be able to reach out from the muck of Irangate, reach into the muck of Watergate and impose his reactionary vision of the Constitution on the Supreme Court and the next generation of Americans.

[...] Textualists, like Scalia, only feel comfortable using the first four of these tools; while pragmatists, like Breyer, believe that [...] "purpose" [...] and [...] "consequences" [...] are particularly important interpretative tools.|$|E

Our {{contemporary}} {{views on}} the role of shame in <b>our</b> <b>democracies</b> seem sometimes to be reduced to a distorted opposition between the condemnation of this conservative emotion in societies, which lead to humiliation and exclusion, and a praise of a sense of shame crucial for instilling respect and openness to differences.

Paul Krugman wrote an op-ed piece arguing that political rhetoric had become toxic. With renewed calls to tone down political rhetoric after the shooting, Keith Olbermann said, [...] "Violence, or the threat of violence, has no place in <b>our</b> <b>Democracy,</b> and I apologize for and repudiate any act or any thing in my past that may have even inadvertently encouraged violence." [...] Jon Stewart stated that he did not know whether or not the political environment contributed to the shooting, but, [...] "For all the hyperbole and vitriol that's become a part of our political process—when the reality of that rhetoric, when actions match the disturbing nature of words, we haven't lost our capacity to be horrified. ...

500|$|Ricardo López Murphy, {{minister}} of economy of president Fernando de la Rúa, said that Alfonsín was [...] "the man {{who fought for}} <b>our</b> <b>democracy</b> and the strengthening of institutions, {{during a time of}} conflicts and polarizations that our society was merged into". Cristian Ritondo, legislator of the Republican Proposal, said that [...] "Alfonsín was the main actor of the return of democracy to Argentina. He was a sinonym of work, responsibility and patriotism". Gerardo Morales said that [...] "when we were young in 1983 and sang 'we are life, we are peace', {{it was more than a}} slogan, it was a synthesis of our hopes: do not suffer more persecutions, live in democracy, in freedom and peace. We were part of the collective project led by Alfonsín". Elisa Carrió pointed that she had political disputes with him, but respected him nonetheless. Julio César Strassera, judge of the trial of the juntas, hoped that Alfonsín would be remembered as a great democrat. Daniel Scioli, governor of the Buenos Aires province, praised that he died with a complete peace of mind. Mauricio Macri, mayor of Buenos Aires, considered that he must have died in peace, after fulfilling his goals.|$|E
500|$|The Florida recount {{was stopped}} {{a few weeks}} later by the U.S. Supreme Court. In the ruling, Bush v. Gore, the Justices held that the Florida recount was unconstitutional and that no constitutionally valid recount could be {{completed}} by the December 12 deadline, effectively ending the recounts. This 7–2 vote ruled that the standards the Florida Supreme Court provided for a recount were unconstitutional due to violations of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and further ruled 5–4 that no constitutionally valid recount could be completed by the December 12 deadline. This case ordered an end to recounting underway in selected Florida counties, effectively giving George W. Bush a 537 vote victory in Florida and consequently Florida's 25 electoral votes and the presidency. The results of the decision led to Gore winning the popular vote by approximately 500,000 votes nationwide, but receiving 266 electoral votes to Bush's 271 (one District of Columbia elector abstained). On December 13, 2000, Gore conceded the election. Gore strongly disagreed with the Court's decision, but in his concession speech stated that, [...] "for the sake of our unity as a people and the strength of <b>our</b> <b>democracy,</b> I offer my concession." ...|$|E

(ii) This Cosmopolitanism was a {{situated}} answer for a historically contextualized problem; now this answer is very old and alien to our present.

Sinclair suggested {{that the fact that}} Harding received two-fifths of the Southern vote in 1920 led him to see political opportunity for his party in the Solid South. On October 26, 1921, Harding gave a speech in Birmingham, Alabama, to a segregated audience of 20,000 whites and 10,000 blacks. Harding, while stating that the social and racial differences between whites and blacks could not be bridged, urged equal political rights for the African American. Many African Americans at that time voted Republican, especially in the Democratic South, and Harding stated he did not mind seeing that support end if the result was a strong two-party system in the South. He was willing to see literacy tests for voting continue, if applied fairly to white and black. [...] "Whether you like it or not," [...] Harding told his segregated audience, [...] "unless <b>our</b> <b>democracy</b> is a lie, you must stand for that equality." [...] The white section of the audience listened in silence while the black section cheered.|$|E
