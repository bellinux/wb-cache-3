5|$|Beginning November 1984, geologists {{observed}} {{an increasing}} level of seismic activity near Nevado del Ruiz. <b>Other</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> a forthcoming eruption included increased fumarole activity, deposition of sulfur {{on the summit}} of the volcano, and small phreatic eruptions. In the latter, hot magma came in contact with water, resulting in explosions as the water was almost instantly turned into steam. The most notable of these events was an ash ejection on September 11, 1985. The activity of the volcano decreased in October 1985. The most likely explanation of the events is that new magma rose into the volcanic edifice before September 1985.|$|E
5|$|On 10 April, {{officials}} publicly accused Rajab of fabricating photos {{posted on}} his Twitter {{account of the}} body of Ali Isa Ibrahim Saqer, who died in detention on 9 April. The Ministry of Interior announced that Rajab would be referred to the Military Prosecutor for legal action. The photos showed slash marks all over Saqer's back and <b>other</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> physical abuse, and were also stated to be accurate by an HRW researcher who had seen the body prior to burial. Five prison guards were subsequently charged with Saqer's death.|$|E
5|$|In 1854, John Rae, while {{surveying}} the Boothia Peninsula for the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC), discovered {{further evidence of}} the expedition's fate. Rae met an Inuk near Pelly Bay (now Kugaaruk, Nunavut) on 21 April 1854, who told him of a party of 35 to 40white men who had died of starvation near the mouth of the Back River. Other Inuit confirmed this story, which included reports of cannibalism among the dying sailors. The Inuit showed Rae many objects that were identified as having belonged to Franklin and his men. In particular, Rae brought from the Inuit several silver forks and spoons later identified as belonging to Franklin, Fitzjames, Crozier, and Robert Osmer Sargent, a shipmate aboard Erebus. Rae's report was sent to the Admiralty, which in October 1854 urged the HBC to send an expedition down the Back River to search for <b>other</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> Franklin and his men.|$|E

5|$|By April 1955 the Guatemalan government's foreign {{exchange}} reserves had declined from $42million {{at the end of}} 1954 to just $3.4million. The regime was thus facing difficulties borrowing money, leading to capital flight. The government also received criticism for the presence of black markets and <b>other</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> approaching bankruptcy. By the end of 1954 the number of unemployed people in the country had risen to 20,000, four times higher than it had been during the latter years of the Árbenz government. In April 1955 the Eisenhower administration approved an aid package of $53million and began to underwrite the debt of the Guatemalan government. Although officials in the USgovernment complained about Castillo Armas's incompetence and corruption, he also received praise in that country for acting against communists, and his human rights violations generally went unremarked. In 1955, during a corn famine, Castillo Armas gave corn import licences to some of his old fighters in return for a $25,000 bribe. The imported corn, upon inspection by the United Nations, turned out to be unfit for consumption. When a student newspaper exposed the story, Castillo Armas launched a police crackdown against those criticizing him. Castillo Armas returned some of the privileges that the United Fruit Company had had under Ubico, but the company did not benefit substantially from them; it went into a gradual decline following disastrous experiments with breeding and pesticides, falling demand, and an anti-trust action.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{decided to}} have surgery secretly, to avoid further panic that might worsen the {{financial}} depression. The surgery occurred on July 1, to give Cleveland {{time to make a}} full recovery in time for the upcoming Congressional session. Under the guise of a vacation cruise, Cleveland and his surgeon, Dr. Joseph Bryant, left for New York. The surgeons operated aboard the Oneida, a yacht owned by Cleveland's friend E. C. Benedict, as it sailed off Long Island. The surgery was conducted through the President's mouth, to avoid any scars or <b>other</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> surgery. The team, sedating Cleveland with nitrous oxide and ether, successfully removed parts of his upper left jaw and hard palate. The size of the tumor and the extent of the operation left Cleveland's mouth disfigured. During another surgery, Cleveland was fitted with a hard rubber dental prosthesis that corrected his speech and restored his appearance. A cover story about the removal of two bad teeth kept the suspicious press placated. Even when a newspaper story appeared giving details of the actual operation, the participating surgeons discounted the severity of what transpired during Cleveland's vacation. In 1917, one of the surgeons present on the Oneida, Dr. William W. Keen, wrote an article detailing the operation.|$|E

25|$|The {{sequence}} of events of pubertal development can occasionally vary.
