She said, [...] "With Ali, <b>our</b> <b>discussion</b> started with wanting really clean, classic and sharp lines, whereas Beyoncé's character [...] more soft, more textural cashmeres and knits." [...] Sharon wore clothes designed by Zac Posen, Yves Saint Laurent, Jimmy Choo, Diane von Fürstenberg, Valentino, Stella McCartney and Missoni, while Lisa wore Gucci, Dolce & Gabbana and Burberry outfits. Derek was dressed in Dolce & Gabbana and Versace suits with Thomas Pink shirts to create a [...] "prestigious yet contemporary" [...] look.|$|E

Though Raeder insisted on the operation, he advised Lütjens to act thoughtfully and carefully without taking too high a risk. Raeder did, however, admonish his subordinate to one end: if he were brought to battle despite his best efforts, it should be conducted with full force, to the end. He gave Lütjens full freedom of action, since only he {{was in a position to}} judge the immediate situation while at sea. Raeder later wrote, [...] "It does Lütjens great credit that he did not hesitate to express this view to me so frankly.

2500|$|On 1 August 1943, the Japanese {{declared}} Burma {{an independent}} nation. Aung San was appointed War Minister, {{and the army}} was again renamed, {{this time as the}} Burma National Army (BNA). Aung San soon became doubtful about Japanese promises of true independence and of Japan's ability to win the war. As William Slim, 1st Viscount Slim put it: It was not long before Aung San found that what he meant by independence had little relation to what the Japanese were prepared to give—that he had exchanged an old master for an infinitely more tyrannical new one. As one of his leading followers once said to me, [...] "If the British sucked our blood, the Japanese ground our bones!" [...] He became more and more disillusioned with the Japanese, and early in 1943 we got news from Seagrim, a most gallant officer who had remained in the Karen Hills at the ultimate cost of his life, that Aung San's feelings were changing. On 1 August 1944 he was bold enough to speak publicly with contempt of the Japanese brand of independence, and it was clear that, if they did not soon liquidate him, he might prove useful to us. ... At our first interview, Aung San began to take rather a high hand. ... I pointed out that he was in no position to take the line he had. I did not need his forces; I was destroying the Japanese quite nicely without their help, and could continue to do so. I would accept his help and that of his army only on the clear understanding that it implied no recognition of any provisional government. ... The British Government had announced its intention to grant self-government to Burma within the British Commonwealth, and we had better limit <b>our</b> <b>discussion</b> to the best method of throwing the Japanese out of the country as the next step toward self-government.Aung San made plans to organize an uprising in Burma and made contact with the British authorities in India, in cooperation with the Communist leaders Thakin Than Tun and Thakin Soe. On 27 March 1945, he led the BNA in a revolt against the Japanese occupiers and helped the Allies defeat the Japanese. 27 March came to be commemorated as Resistance Day, until the military regime renamed it [...] "Tatmadaw (Armed Forces) Day".|$|E
