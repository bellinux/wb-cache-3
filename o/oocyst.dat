25|$|Oocysts {{are passed}} in the feces of an {{infected}} definitive host. The <b>oocyst</b> undergoes sporogony creating two sporocysts. Once this is complete the <b>oocyst</b> itself undergoes lysis releasing the sporocysts into the environment. Sporocysts typically contain 4 sporozoites and measure 15-19 by 8-10 micrometres.|$|E
25|$|Once the {{intermediate}} host is eaten by the definitive host {{such as a}} dog or human, the parasite undergoes sexual reproduction within the gut to create macrogamonts and microgamonts. Most definitive hosts do not show any clinical sign or symptoms. Fusion of a macrogamont and a microgamont creates a zygote which develops into an <b>oocyst.</b> The <b>oocyst</b> is passed through the faeces completing the life cycle.|$|E
25|$|Within the {{mosquito}} midgut, the female gamete maturation process entails slight morphological changes, becoming more enlarged and spherical. The male gametocyte undergoes a rapid nuclear division within 15 minutes, producing eight flagellated microgametes {{by a process}} called exflagellation. The flagellated microgamete fertilizes the female macrogamete to produce a diploid cell called a zygote. The zygote then develops into an ookinete. The ookinete is a motile cell, capable of invading other organs of {{the mosquito}}. It traverses the peritrophic membrane of the mosquito midgut and crosses the midgut epithelium. Once through the epithelium, the ookinete enters the basal lamina, and settles to an immotile <b>oocyst.</b> For several days, the <b>oocyst</b> undergoes 10 to 11 rounds of cell division to create a syncytial cell (sporoblast) containing thousands of nuclei. Meiosis takes place inside the sporoblast to produce over 3,000 haploid daughter cells called sporozoites {{on the surface of}} the mother cell. Immature sporozoites break through the <b>oocyst</b> wall into the haemolymph. They migrate to the mosquito salivary glands where they undergo further development and become infective to humans.|$|E

40|$|Filtration {{abilities}} of Cryptosporidium parvum <b>oocysts</b> by rotifers (Brachionus calyciflorus) were studied. The filtration rate of rotifers is quick: {{the passage of}} <b>oocysts</b> through the digestive system is few minutes only. During the first 10 minutes 24300 of whole amount one million <b>oocysts</b> passed through the digestive system of 100 rotifers. Moreover, 93 % of <b>oocysts</b> were death after passage. All <b>oocysts</b> expelled were unable to infect suckling BALB/c mice. <b>Oocysts</b> were degraded in mastax, stomach and intestine. Rotifers can be use for detection of cryptosporidia <b>oocysts</b> in water and they effectively decrease their numbers...|$|R
40|$|Three {{methods of}} {{isolating}} Cryptosporidium parvum <b>oocysts</b> from rat feces were evaluated. <b>Oocysts</b> were initially isolated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. They were further purified by passage {{through a glass}} bead column or a Percoll gradient or by dialysis. Although <b>oocysts</b> recovered from the glass bead column and by dialysis were relatively free of fecal debris, only <b>oocysts</b> recovered from the Percoll gradient were free of bacteria. Recovered <b>oocysts</b> retained their antigenicity and infectivity. The ability to effectively recover <b>oocysts</b> from rat feces suggests that the laboratory rat may be a convenient substitute for ruminants in the propagation and maintenance of C. parvum <b>oocysts</b> for in vitro and in vivo use...|$|R
25|$|Sporozoites are {{the stage}} of the {{parasite}} residing within oocysts. When a human or other warm-blooded host consumes an <b>oocyst,</b> sporozoites are released from it, infecting epithelial cells before converting to the proliferative tachyzoite stage.|$|E
25|$|The zygote remains {{inactive}} for sometime {{but it soon}} elongates, becomes vermiform (worm-like) and motile. It is {{now known}} as ookinete. The pointed ends of ookinete penetrate the stomach wall and come to lie below its outer epithelial layer. Here the zygote becomes spherical and develops a cyst wall around itself. The cyst wall is derived partly from the stomach tissues and partly produced by the zygote itself. At this stage, the zygote is known as an <b>oocyst.</b> The <b>oocyst</b> absorbs nourishment and grows in size. Oocysts protrude from the surface of stomach, giving it a blistered appearance. In a highly infected mosquito, as many as 1000 oocysts may be seen.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, a {{vast number}} of species were tested for the ability to shed oocysts upon infection. Whereas at least 17 {{different}} species of felids have been confirmed to shed oocysts, no nonfelid {{has been shown to be}} permissive for T. gondii sexual reproduction and subsequent <b>oocyst</b> shedding.|$|E

25|$|In the mosquito, the gametocytes {{move along}} with the blood meal to the mosquito's midgut. Here the gametocytes develop into male and female gametes which {{fertilize}} each other, forming a zygote. Zygotes then develop into a motile form called an ookinete, which penetrates {{the wall of the}} midgut. Upon traversing the midgut wall, the ookinete embeds into the gut's exterior membrane and develops into an <b>oocyst.</b> Oocysts divide many times to produce large numbers of small elongated sporozoites. These sporozoites migrate to the salivary glands of the mosquito where they can be injected into the blood of the next host the mosquito bites, repeating the cycle.|$|E
25|$|P. falciparum {{does not}} have a fixed {{structure}} but undergoes continuous change during the course of its life cycle. A sporozoite is spindle-shaped and 10-15 μm long. In the liver it grows into an ovoid schizont of 30-70 μm in diameter. Each schizont produces merozoites, each of which is roughly 1.5 μm in length and 1 μm in diameter. In the erythrocyte the merozoite form a ring-like structure, becoming a trophozoite. A trophozoites feed on the haemoglobin and forms a granular pigment called haemozoin. Unlike those of other Plasmodium species, the gametocytes of P. falciparum are elongated and crescent-shaped, by which they are sometimes identified. A mature gametocyte is 8-12 μm long and 3-6 μm wide. The ookinete is also elongated measuring about 18-24 μm. An <b>oocyst</b> is rounded and can grow up to 80 μm in diameter. Microscopic examination of a blood film reveals only early (ring-form) trophozoites and gametocytes that are in the peripheral blood. Mature trophozoites or schizonts in peripheral blood smears, as these are usually sequestered in the tissues. On occasion, faint, comma-shaped, red dots are seen on the erythrocyte surface. These dots are Maurer's cleft and are secretory organelles that produce proteins and enzymes essential for nutrient uptake and immune evasion processes.|$|E
2500|$|T. gondii is {{considered}} to have three stages of infection; the tachyzoite stage of rapid division, the bradyzoite stage of slow division within tissue cysts, and the <b>oocyst</b> environmental stage. [...] When an <b>oocyst</b> or tissue cyst is ingested by a human or other warm-blooded animal, the resilient cyst wall is dissolved by proteolytic enzymes in the stomach and small intestine, freeing sporozoites from within the <b>oocyst.</b> [...] The parasites first invade cells in and surrounding the intestinal epithelium, and inside these cells, the parasites differentiate into tachyzoites, the motile and quickly multiplying cellular stage of T. gondii. [...] Tissue cysts in tissues such as brain and muscle tissue, form about 7–10 days after initial infection.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>oocyst</b> nucleus divides {{repeatedly}} to form {{large number of}} daughter nuclei. At the same time, the cytoplasm develops large vacuoles and forms numerous cytoplasmic masses. These cytoplasmic masses then elongate and a daughter nuclei migrates into each mass. The resulting sickle-shaped bodies are known as sporozoites. This phase of asexual multiplication is known as sporogony and is completed in about 10–21 days. The <b>oocyst</b> then bursts and sporozoites are released into the body cavity of mosquito. [...] Sporozoites eventually reach the salivary glands of mosquito via its hemolymph. The mosquito now becomes infectious. Salivary glands of a single infected mosquito may contain as many as 200,000 sporozoites.|$|E
2500|$|Ingestion of oocysts {{by humans}} or other warm-blooded animals {{is one of}} the common routes of infection. [...] Humans can be exposed to oocysts by, for example, {{consuming}} unwashed vegetables or contaminated water, or by handling the feces (litter) of an infected cat.

40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2011. Includes bibliographical references. The {{presence}} of Cryptosporidium parvum <b>oocysts</b> in source waters {{is a cause}} of major public health concern for drinking-water treatment plants. The <b>oocysts</b> occurring in the feces of livestock can be disseminated horizontally via runoff during storm events and contaminate surface waters. Soils are often the initial barrier to subsurface transport of Cryptosporidium parvum <b>oocysts</b> which receive oocyst-laden manure from grazing livestock. However, rainfall events can cause rapid vertical movement of <b>oocysts</b> through preferential flow paths in the soils leading to ground water contamination. A systematic study was undertaken to assess the efficacy of three disparate agricultural soils (two tropical, variable-charge soils of volcanic origin from Hawaii and a humic, quartz-rich temperate soil from Illinois) to remove Cryptosporidium parvum <b>oocysts</b> and oocystsized microspheres in batch and flow-through columns. To test the effect of soil mineralogy on <b>oocysts</b> transport, saturated flow-through column experiments were conducted by packing the three agricultural soils and injecting <b>oocysts</b> and microspheres. The results showed that <b>oocysts</b> were transported through preferential flow paths in high-clay, high-iron tropical soil from Hawaii and humic-rich quartz dominated temperate soil from Illinois. Transport through volcanic-ash soil collected from the island of Hawaii was highly reversible because of high soil organic matter content. The effects of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) on <b>oocysts</b> and microspheres transport through these soils were assessed in a subsequent phase of this study. DOC in form of natural organic matter enhanced the removal of oocyst-sized colloids (microspheres and <b>oocysts),</b> whereas surfactants lowered the removal efficiency of <b>oocysts</b> and microspheres. The transport potentials of <b>oocysts</b> and microspheres were affected differentially by the physicochemical properties of the soils. Whereas <b>oocysts</b> transport was more strongly affected by soil mineralogy, microspheres transport was much {{more sensitive to the}} nature of DOC...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{determine}} {{the ability of}} oysters to trap and maintain viable Cryptosporidium <b>oocysts,</b> and the feasibility of Cryptosporidium multiplication in oysters' organs. MethodsSeventy oysters were raised in experimentally seeded natural seawater for up to 3 months, with weekly <b>oocysts</b> inoculations. Cryptosporidium <b>oocysts,</b> viable and non-viable, {{as well as other}} stages were detected using two immunofluorescence vital staining techniques (Sporo-Glo and Merifluor®) with confocal microscopy. Viability rate at various times after inoculations were calculated. ResultsCryptosporidium <b>oocysts</b> were found most concentrated in oysters' digestive organs than in gill and water inside the oysters. <b>Oocysts</b> numbers were 857. 33 at 24  h after inoculation and strikingly decreased to 243. 00 and 126. 67 <b>oocysts</b> at 72  h and 7 days, respectively. The <b>oocysts</b> in oyster were also less viable over time; 70 %, 60 % and 30 % viable at 24  h, 72  h and 7 days after inoculation, respectively. At 77 days, the number of <b>oocysts</b> was very low and none was found at 84 days onwards. Although some <b>oocysts</b> were ruptured with released sporozoites, there was no evidence throughout the study of sporozoites multiplication to indicate that oyster is a biological host. Despite the significant reduction in <b>oocysts</b> number after 7 days of inoculation, the remained viable <b>oocysts</b> can still cause cryptosporidiosis. ConclusionThe findings confirm that Cryptosporidium parvum does not multiply in oyster, and is therefore not a biological host. Nevertheless, the results suggest that oyster can be an effective transmission vehicle for Cryptosporidium <b>oocysts,</b> especially within 24 – 72  h of contamination, with viable <b>oocysts</b> present at up to 7 days post infection. Unless consuming well-cooked oyster dishes, eating raw oyster remains a public health concern and at least 3 days of depuration in clean sea water prior to consumption is recommended...|$|R
2500|$|Cryptosporidium spp. {{exist as}} {{multiple}} cell types which correspond to different stages in an infection (e.g., a sexual and asexual stage). As an <b>oocyst</b> – {{a type of}} hardy, thick-walled spore – it can survive in the environment for months and is resistant to many common disinfectants, particularly chlorine-based disinfectants. After being ingested, the sporozoites within oocysts excyst (i.e., are released) in the small intestine. [...] The released sporozoites subsequently attach to the microvilli of the epithelial cells of the small intestine. [...] From there they become trophozoites that reproduce asexually by multiple fission, {{a process known as}} schizogony.

2500|$|A {{recombinant}} Cryptosporidium parvum <b>oocyst</b> surface protein (rCP15/60) vaccine {{has produced}} an antibody response {{in a large}} group of cows and also antibody response in calves fed rCP15/60-immune colostrum produced by these vaccinated cows. [...] This is very promising. [...] Human Cryptosporidium parvum infections are particularly prevalent and often fatal in neonates in developing countries and to immunocompromised people, such as AIDS patients. [...] There is no commercially available effective vaccine against Cryptosporidium parvum, although passive immunization utilizing different zoite surface (glyco)proteins has shown promise. [...] Developmental stages of the life cycle of the parasite might act as possible targets for vaccine development. The organism is detected in 65–97% of the surface-water supply in the United States and is resistant to most disinfectants used for the treatment of drinking water. Antibodies in the serum of humans and animals infected with Cryptosporidium parvum react with several antigens, one of which is a 15 protein (CP15) located {{on the surface of the}} organism. This protein is a good candidate for use as a molecular vaccine because previous studies have shown that a monoclonal antibody to CP15 confers passive immunity to mice.
