5|$|Amino acids {{that share}} the same biosynthetic pathway tend {{to have the same}} first base in their codons. This could be an {{evolutionary}} relic <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>early,</b> simpler genetic code with fewer amino acids that later evolved to code a larger set of amino acids. It could also reflect steric and chemical properties that had another effect on the codon during its evolution. Amino acids with similar physical properties also tend to have similar codons, reducing the problems caused by point mutations and mistranslations.|$|E
5|$|Ancient writers {{believed}} that the worship of Terminus had been introduced to Rome {{during the reign of}} the first king Romulus (traditionally 753717 BC) or his successor Numa (717673 BC). Modern scholars have variously seen it as the survival <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>early</b> animistic reverence for the power inherent in the boundary marker, or as the Roman development of proto-Indo-European belief in a god concerned with the division of property.|$|E
5|$|Ascetic {{practices}} (tapas), {{concentration and}} bodily postures used by Vedic priests to conduct yajna (sacrifice), {{might have been}} precursors to yoga. Vratya, a group of ascetics mentioned in the Atharvaveda, emphasized on bodily postures which may have evolved into yogic asanas. Early Samhitas also contain references to other group ascetics such as munis, the keśin, and vratyas. Techniques for controlling breath and vital energies are mentioned in the Brahmanas (texts of the Vedic corpus, c. 1000–800 BCE) and the Atharvaveda. Nasadiya Sukta of the Rig Veda suggests the presence <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>early</b> contemplative tradition.|$|E

5|$|Between the 13th {{century and}} the {{dissolution}} five monks were sent from Muchelney to the University of Oxford studying at either Canterbury College or Gloucester College. By the 16th century the Abbey included an Abbey Church, the demesne farm barton, an almonry, the parish church of St Peter and St Paul with its vicarage, and a Cross dating from the 15th century (moved in 1830 to near the parish church).

5|$|Blinded in {{both eyes}} {{as a result}} <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>early</b> {{childhood}} accident, Braille mastered his disability while still a boy. He excelled in his education and received scholarship to France's Royal Institute for Blind Youth.

Inspired by the military cryptography of Charles Barbier, Braille constructed a new method built specifically for the needs of the blind. He presented his work to his peers {{for the first time in}} 1824.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} {{eleventh}} century {{the church in}} Wales began to come under Norman influence, but Llanbadarn Fawr still essentially belonged to a Welsh world, that <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>early</b> Welsh clas, with its hereditary succession to the abbacy and its married clerics.

5|$|NGC 821 is an E6 {{elliptical}} galaxy.

Segue 2 is a dwarf galaxy that is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, recently discovered to be a potential relic of the epoch of reionization.|$|E

5|$|The bronzes of Igbo-Ukwu pay special {{attention}} to detail depicting birds, snails, chameleons, and other natural aspects of the world such as a hatching bird.

None of these extra details were made separately; the bronzes were all one piece. Igbo-Ukwu gave the evidence <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>early</b> bronze casting tradition in Nri.|$|E
