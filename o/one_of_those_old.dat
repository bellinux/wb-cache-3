500|$|Peter Kingdom (played by Stephen Fry) is Cambridge-graduated {{lawyer and}} {{one half of}} Kingdom & Kingdom, a {{practice}} he ran with his father. Peter is respected and regarded as compassionate by the local community. Fry describes him as [...] "kind and empathetic", [...] "on {{the side of the}} ordinary people" [...] and as being [...] "lonely and isolated" [...] and not revealing his true emotions. Phyllida Law describes Peter as [...] "into the community like <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>old</b> French village priests".|$|E
500|$|Vincent Law, in {{a review}} {{published}} in the Gerry Anderson-centric fanzine Andersonic, considers The Day After Tomorrow an [...] "oddity" [...] and an [...] "uncharacteristically lacklustre entry in the Anderson canon", commenting that the programme [...] "cracks along at a fair old pace, but the educational content does tend to deaden {{the first half of}} the story and limits the room for character development." [...] Although he credits the production for [...] "getting its science lesson across in a superficial way", he expresses a negative view of the narration, remarking that [...] "at times Ed [...] comes across like a presenter of <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>old</b> schools programmes from the 70s, just imparting a string of dry facts." [...] He believes that Jane is the only character who develops over the course of the special. The adults, by contrast, are [...] "pretty much peripheral", while David can be considered a [...] "miniature Spock" [...] who [...] "lurks around the ship either brandishing his slide rule, threatening to calculate something, or staring out of the porthole (a nice touch!) dribbling about pulsars." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tech media website CNET gave new Super Slim 4 out of 5 stars ("Excellent"), saying [...] "The Super Slim PlayStation 3 shrinks a {{powerful}} gaming machine into an even tinier package {{while maintaining the}} same features as its predecessors: a great gaming library and a strong array of streaming services [...] ", whilst also criticising the [...] "cheap" [...] design and disc-loader, stating: [...] "Sometimes [...] doesn't catch {{and you feel like}} you're using <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>old</b> credit card imprinter machines. In short, it feels cheap. You don't realize how convenient autoloading disc trays are until they're gone. Whether it was to cut costs or save space, this move is ultimately a step back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I was wrong!" [...] said Charley, ingenuously. [...] "And I {{would risk}} my life, rather than <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> good <b>old</b> royalists should be tarred and feathered." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ⁂ This is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> {{sterling}} <b>old</b> works {{which were}} written [...] for “all time,” full of learning, humor, and quaint conceits. [...] No library can {{be complete without}} it.|$|R
50|$|Sheikh Nasser is {{a son of}} the King of Bahrain, Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa. He is {{the elder}} of the two {{children}} born to the king by his second wife, Sheia bint Hasan Al Khrayyesh Al Ajmi; he has one full brother, Sheikh Khalid bin Hamad. Sheikh Naseer also has ten other half-siblings, the children of his father's other three wives. These include four half-siblings, all older than him, who are {{the children of the}} king's first wife. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>older</b> half-siblings, Salman al-Khalifa, is the crown prince of Bahrain.|$|R
6000|$|... "Didn't {{approve of}} you to such an extent?" [...] Holderness remarked. [...] "Was she <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>old</b> country frumps--all starch and prejudice?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You make me {{feel like}} <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>old</b> knights," [...] he said, [...] "who rode about the country looking for dragons and {{beautiful}} maidens and chivalresque adventures." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{look like}} <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>old</b> fortune tellers," [...] Sherikov said jokingly, but a cold shiver crawled up his spine. [...] "Better hand {{it back to}} me." [...] He held out his hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "The Professor is just <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> amiable <b>old</b> idiots, {{absorbed in}} his mouldy old work, {{who would never}} notice anything," [...] Lenora persisted. [...] "He is just the man to be {{completely}} hoodwinked by a clever servant." ...|$|R
5000|$|Earth-C's {{population}} also {{consisted of}} the various [...] "funny animal" [...] characters that appeared in DC Comics over the years, particularly those in such Golden Age and Silver Age DC titles as Funny Stuff, The Dodo and the Frog, Real Screen Comics, and so forth. Indeed, several characters from these series made cameos during the run of Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>older</b> characters, Peter Porkchops, {{was a member of}} the Zoo Crew itself in the form of Pig-Iron. Reference was also made to Fastback's uncle being Merton McSnurtle, a Golden Age funny animal superhero known as the Terrific Whatzit.|$|R
25|$|Among the district's 23 {{buildings}} and structures are many that are architecturally distinctive or unique, or important to the village's history. Two {{of them have been}} listed individually on the Register; <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those,</b> the <b>Old</b> Croton Aqueduct, is a National Historic Landmark.|$|R
6000|$|... "I believe so; <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>old</b> chaps in raglan vests {{and golf}} trousers. I don't care a {{continental}} for a Continental, myself. But the mother has set her heart on pomp and heraldry and pyrotechnics, and I {{want her to}} be happy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It would, indeed," [...] {{answered}} I. [...] "The {{summer house}} itself, so airy and so broken, is like <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>old</b> tales, imperfectly remembered; and these living {{branches of the}} Baldwin apple tree, thrusting so rudely in, are like your unwarrantable interpolations. But, by the by, have you added any more legends to the series, {{since the publication of}} the 'Wonder-Book'?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Stanbury's {{income is}} sure. I don't {{know why it}} shouldn't be sure. He goes on writing and writing every day, {{and it seems to}} me that of all professions in the world it is the finest. I'd much sooner write for a {{newspaper}} than be <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>old</b> musty, fusty lawyers, who'll say anything that they're paid to say." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Suppose, then, for {{the sake}} <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> {{pleasant}} <b>old</b> games <b>of</b> ours, an argument, that he wished to manifest his righteousness to the world.... The only method for him, according to Plato, would be Glaucon's, of calumny and persecution, the scourge and the cross?' ...|$|R
60|$|Arthour Twain {{was a man}} of {{considerable}} note--a solicitor on the highway in William Rufus' time. At about the age of thirty he went to <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> fine <b>old</b> English places of resort called Newgate, to see about something, and never returned again. While there he died suddenly.|$|R
6000|$|... "She is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> cursed <b>old</b> women," [...] {{replied the}} Doctor, [...] "who take {{currently}} and impudently {{upon themselves to}} act as advisers and curers of the sick, {{on the strength of}} some trash of herbs, some rhyme of spells, some julap or diet, drink or cordial." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly {{is nice to}} have <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>old</b> families. It's {{something}} like---- As you say, you and I {{have gotten}} pretty well acquainted along the line, so I guess I can say it to you---- My father and his folks came from {{that same kind of}} family. Father's dad was a judge, back in Maine, and in the war, grand-dad was quite friendly with Grant." ...|$|E
60|$|The Yankee Carterets {{went into}} {{business}} in New York {{long before the}} war. Their house, as far as Leather Belting and Mill Supplies was concerned, was as musty and arrogant and solid as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>old</b> East India tea-importing concerns that you read about in Dickens. There were some rumors of a war behind its counters, {{but not enough to}} affect the business.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm going {{across to}} Old St. John's after lunch," [...] said Anne. [...] "I don't {{know that a}} {{graveyard}} {{is a very good}} place to go to get cheered up, but it seems the only get-at-able place where there are trees, and trees I must have. I'll sit on <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>old</b> slabs and shut my eyes and imagine I'm in the Avonlea woods." ...|$|E
60|$|LIEUTENANT (starting). I forgot that. (Resolutely.) I'll {{go after}} him, General: I'll find that horse if it's alive {{anywhere}} in Italy. And I shan't forget the despatches: never fear. Giuseppe: go and saddle <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> mangy <b>old</b> posthorses <b>of</b> yours, while I get my cap and sword and things. Quick march. Off with you (bustling him).|$|R
60|$|A general silence {{followed}} the sudden rebuke {{of this very}} rich man. The subject, however, was too interesting to be readily abandoned. The conversation soon broke forth again from the lips of Peechy Prauw Van Hook, the chronicler <b>of</b> the club, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> narrative <b>old</b> men who seem to grow incontinent of words, as they grow old, until their talk flows from them almost involuntarily.|$|R
60|$|And so I leave him, {{with two}} hints. If any {{one wishes to}} see the justice of my censure, let him read <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the Alexandrian hymns, and {{immediately}} after it, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> glorious <b>old</b> Homeric hymns to the very same deities; let him contrast the insincere and fulsome idolatry of Callimachus with the reverent, simple and manful anthropomorphism of the Homerist--and let him form his own judgment.|$|R
6000|$|... "At 'em, Freddy!" [...] Lane shouted, {{seizing the}} nearest of his assailants {{by the neck}} and {{throwing}} him out into the darkness. [...] "To hell with you!" [...] he added, just escaping a murderous blow and driving his fist {{into the face of}} the man who had aimed it. [...] "Good for you, Hunterleys! There isn't <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>old</b> guns of theirs that'll go off. They aren't even loaded." ...|$|E
60|$|Gudruna herself, of whom I spoke just now, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>old</b> Norse heroines {{who helped}} to {{discover}} America, though a historic personage, is a symbolic one likewise, and {{the pattern of}} a whole class. She too, after many journeys to Iceland, Greenland, and Winland, goes {{on a pilgrimage to}} Rome, to get, I presume, absolution from the Pope himself for all the sins of her strange, rich, stormy, wayward life.|$|E
60|$|Close to {{the curb}} stood Jerry O'Donovan's cab. Night-hawk was Jerry called; but no more lustrous or cleaner hansom than his ever closed its doors upon point lace and November violets. And Jerry's horse! I am within bounds when I {{tell you that he}} was stuffed with oats until <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>old</b> ladies who leave their dishes {{unwashed}} at home and go about having expressmen arrested, would have smiled--yes, smiled--to have seen him.|$|E
60|$|Before {{proceeding}} any farther, I would beg {{that the}} Squire {{might not be}} confounded with that class of hard-riding, foxhunting gentlemen so often described, and, in fact, so nearly extinct in England. I use this rural title partly because it is his universal appellation throughout the neighbourhood, and partly because it saves me the frequent repetition of his name, which is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> rough <b>old</b> English names at which Frenchmen exclaim in despair.|$|R
60|$|Perhaps {{it would}} have been more true had {{he said that he had}} wanted to elude his sisters, but he was glad to accept a seat on a bundle of sacks tremulous with the motion of the mill, and to enter into a {{conversation}} with the <b>old</b> foreman, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> good <b>old</b> peasants whose integrity and skill render them privileged persons, worth their weight in gold long after their bodily strength has given way.|$|R
60|$|So I said it again, and he {{said his}} again, and I said mine again, and then he did, and then I did, and then he did, and we kept on doing it, and doing it, and I never had such a good time, {{and he said}} the same. In my opinion there isn't {{anything}} that is as killing as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> dear <b>old</b> ripe pensioners {{if you know how to}} snatch it out in a kind of a fresh sort of original way.|$|R
60|$|She was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>old</b> women, was Mrs Betty Higden, who {{by dint of}} an indomitable {{purpose and}} a strong {{constitution}} fight out many years, though each year has come with its new knock-down blows fresh to the fight against her, wearied by it; an active old woman, with a bright dark eye and a resolute face, yet quite a tender creature too; not a logically-reasoning woman, but God is good, and hearts may count in Heaven as high as heads.|$|E
60|$|Arm-in-arm, {{looking like}} some china, but {{exceedingly}} substantial china, shepherd and shepherdess, they descend upon the town. One rubs one's eyes and stares after {{them as they}} pass. They seem to have stepped from the pictured pages of <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>old</b> story-books that we learnt to love, sitting beside the high brass guard that kept ourselves and the nursery-fire from doing each other any serious injury, {{in the days when}} the world was much bigger than it is now, and much more real and interesting.|$|E
60|$|There {{are some}} traits about the Squire's family, also, which appear {{to me to}} be national. It is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>old</b> aristocratical families, which, I believe, are {{peculiar}} to England, and scarcely understood in other countries; that is to say, families of the ancient gentry, who, though destitute of titled rank, maintain a high ancestral pride; who look down upon all nobility of recent creation, and would consider it a sacrifice of dignity to merge the venerable name of their house in a modern title.|$|E
60|$|New Orleans will readily recall to {{mind the}} {{circumstances}} attendant upon the death of Mr. Gaspard Morin, in that city. Mr. Morin was an artistic goldsmith and jeweller in the old French Quarter, and a man held in the highest esteem. He belonged to <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the oldest French families, and was of some distinction as an antiquary and historian. He was a bachelor, about fifty years of age. He lived in quiet comfort, at <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> rare <b>old</b> hostelries in Royal Street. He was found in his rooms, one morning, dead from unknown causes.|$|R
6000|$|They took {{a cab to}} the hospital, and, {{with some}} trouble, got the man's name and address, and drove in search of him. They had some {{difficulty}} in finding his abode, for it was up an alley {{at the back of}} Drury Lane, in the top <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> foul <b>old</b> houses which hold a family in every room; but, by dint <b>of</b> knocking at <b>one</b> door and the other, and bearing meekly much reviling consequent thereon, they arrived, [...] "per modum tollendi" [...] at a door which must be the right one, as all the rest were wrong.|$|R
60|$|I shall now {{proceed to}} the history of my own {{experience}} in this inexplicable mystery. We found M. C---- buried in the heart <b>of</b> Paris, in <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> vast <b>old</b> hotels, which give to this town the air of generations of houses, commencing with the quaint and noble of the sixteenth century, and ending with the more fashionable pavilion of our own times. His cabinet looked upon a small garden, a pleasant transition from the animal within to the vegetable without. But one meets with gardens, with their verdure and shrubbery and trees, in the most unexpected manner, in this crowded town.|$|R
