5|$|Not {{all forms}} <b>of</b> <b>policing</b> require the {{presence}} of a queen; it also occurs in a few species of ants which establish a dominance hierarchy of reproductive female workers, where top-ranking individuals reproduce.|$|E
5|$|The ant species Aphaenogaster smythiesi japonica also display {{evidence}} <b>of</b> <b>policing.</b> When researchers {{separated and}} then reunited workers from colonies that {{did or did}} not have queens, workers from the queen-containing colonies attacked the workers with activated ovaries from the queenless colonies.|$|E
5|$|A higher {{percentage}} of female workers of the bee species Apis cerana are reported to activate their ovaries than those of Apis mellifera or Apis florea. When queens were removed, up to 40% of the workers activated their ovaries in subsequent days.
