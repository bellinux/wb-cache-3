This {{is the first time that}} this type of system has been reported in surface metrology. The system is designed to be compact, robust and stable even though it does not involve noise compensation and feedback control. Compared to currently available techniques, this system has great potential for on-line surface measurements. This application is based on a Michelson interferometer and wavelength scanning method. Considering the fabrication capability and effective cost, the system consists of two parts, an <b>optical</b> <b>chip</b> and an optical probe.

40|$|Embedded {{metrology}} is {{the provision}} of metrology on the manufacturing platform, enabling measurement without {{the removal of the}} work piece. Providing closer integration of metrology upon the manufacturing platform can lead to the better control and increased throughput. In this work we present the development of a high precision hybrid <b>optical</b> <b>chip</b> interferometer metrology device. The complete metrology sensor system is structured into two parts; <b>optical</b> <b>chip</b> and optical probe. The hybrid <b>optical</b> <b>chip</b> interferometer is based on a silica-on-silicon etched integrated-optic motherboard containing waveguide structures and evanescent couplers. Upon the motherboard, electro-optic components such as photodiodes and a semiconductor gain block are mounted and bonded to provide the required functionality. The key structure in the device is a tunable laser module based upon an external-cavity diode laser (ECDL). Within the cavity is a multi-layer thin film filter which is rotated to select the longitudinal mode at which the laser operates. An optical probe, which uses a blazed diffracting grating and collimating objective lens, focuses light of different wavelengths laterally over the measurand. Incident laser light is then tuned in wavelength time to effectively sweep an ‘optical stylus’ over the surface. Wavelength scanning and rapid phase shifting can then retrieve the path length change and thus the surface height. We give an overview of the overall design of the final hybrid photonic chip interferometer, constituent components, device integration and packaging as well as experimental test results from the current version now under evaluation. © (2014) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

40|$|In telecommunication, <b>optical</b> <b>chips</b> modulate, switch or amplify light, {{enabling}} a {{large amount}} of data to be transmitted through optical fibers. Moreover, such chips are also used in very sensitive medical and environmental sensors. Instead of electrons, <b>optical</b> <b>chips</b> handle photons; they manipulate light on micro- and nanoscales. Designers need to simulate how light behaves in their chips, but in most cases, calculating fully three-dimensional vectorial solutions of Maxwell's equations is computationally too expensive. This thesis attempts to reduce the computational cost of such simulations by globally expanding the field in one spatial direction in the modes of some cross-section(s). A variational procedure is applied to obtain a system of coupled partial differential equations in the other one or two directions - effectively reducing the dimensionality of the simulations by one. The system is solved by means of semi-analytical or finite element methods. The procedure is applied to scalar and vectorial mode solvers, and 2 D and 3 D scattering problems. For the scattering problems, special attention is paid to the boundary conditions; the boundaries of the calculation window are transparent for outgoing radiation, while allowing influx to be prescribed. When using one or a low number of modes in the expansion, the methods prove to be an improvement on other approximate techniques like the Effective Index Method, while using more modes yields results that converge to those of rigorous methods...|$|R
