5|$|As decolonisation {{proceeded}} {{throughout the}} British Empire in the 1950s and 1960s, former colonies often did not reject English but rather {{continued to use}} it as independent countries setting their own language policies. For example, the view of the English language among many Indians has gone from associating it with colonialism to associating it with economic progress, and English continues to be an official language of India. English is also widely used in media and literature, and the number of English language books published annually in India is the third largest in the world after the US and UK. However English is rarely spoken as a first language, numbering only around a couple hundred-thousand people, and less than 5% of the population speak fluent English in India. David Crystal claimed in 2004 that, combining native and non-native speakers, India now has more people who speak or understand English than any <b>other</b> <b>country</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> but the number of English speakers in India is very uncertain, with most scholars concluding that the United States still has more speakers of English than India.|$|E

25|$|The Robotics {{industry}} {{is more important}} in Japan than any <b>other</b> <b>country</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> Japan employs {{over a quarter of}} a million industrial robot workers.

25|$|The United States {{has more}} active {{nuclear power plants}} than any <b>other</b> <b>country</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> with 104 plants out of the total 441 active sites and another 62 under {{construction}} worldwide. This is nearly twice as many sites as the next two countries, France (58) and Japan (55), combined. Construction of U.S. nuclear facilities peaked between the 1970s and 1980s, during which time, these facilities were granted 20–40 year operational permits.|$|E

The number of employers who offer health insurance is declining. Costs for employer-paid health insurance are rising rapidly: since 2001, premiums for family coverage have increased 78%, while wages have risen 19% and prices have risen 17%, according to a 2007 study by the Kaiser Family Foundation.|$|E
25|$|Italy {{has more}} UNESCO World Heritage Sites (53) than any <b>other</b> <b>country</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> and has rich {{collections}} of art, culture and literature {{from many different}} periods. The country has had a broad cultural influence worldwide, also because numerous Italians emigrated to other places during the Italian diaspora. Furthermore, the nation has, overall, an estimated 100,000 monuments of any sort (museums, palaces, buildings, statues, churches, art galleries, villas, fountains, historic houses and archaeological remains).|$|E
25|$|Any type {{of sexual}} {{activity}} outside a heterosexual marriage is forbidden. Transsexuality in Iran is legal if accompanied by a gender confirmation surgery, with Iran carrying out more gender realignment operations than any <b>other</b> <b>country</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> after Thailand. These surgeries are typically partially funded by the state – there have been claims that some homosexual men may have been pressured to undergo them both by government and society. Transsexuals still report societal intolerance as in other societies around the world.|$|E

25|$|Solitary {{confinement}} {{is widely}} used in US prisons, yet it is underreported by most states, while some don't report it at all.

At over 80,000 at any given time, the US has more prisoners confined in isolation than any <b>other</b> <b>country</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> In Louisiana, with 843 prisoners per 100,000 citizens, there have been prisoners, such as the Angola Three, held for as long as forty years in isolation.|$|E
25|$|In a 2000 {{review article}} of twentieth century Finnish architecture, Frédéric Edelmann, arts {{critic of the}} French {{newspaper}} Le Monde, suggested that Finland has more great architects {{of the status of}} Alvar Aalto in proportion to the population than any <b>other</b> <b>country</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> Finland's most significant architectural achievements are related to modern architecture, mostly because the current building stock has less than 20% that dates back to before 1955, which relates significantly to the reconstruction following World War II and the process of urbanisation which only gathered pace after the war.|$|E
25|$|A further {{financial}} burden was {{imposed on the}} new post-apartheid government through its obligation to provide antiretroviral (ARV) treatment to impoverished victims of the HIV/AIDS epidemic sweeping the country. South Africa had the highest prevalence of HIV/AIDS compared to any <b>other</b> <b>country</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> with 5,600,000 people afflicted by the disease and 270,000 HIV-related deaths were recorded in 2011. By that time, more than 2,000,000 children were orphaned due to the epidemic. The provision of ARV treatment resulted in 100,000 fewer AIDS-related deaths in 2011 than in 2005.|$|E

25|$|The Russian Constitution {{guarantees}} free, {{universal health}} care for all its citizens. In practice, however, free health care is partially restricted because of mandatory registration. While Russia has more physicians, hospitals, and health care workers than almost any <b>other</b> <b>country</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> on a per capita basis, since the dissolution of the Soviet Union the health of the Russian population has declined considerably as a result of social, economic, and lifestyle changes; the trend has been reversed only in the recent years, with average life expectancy having increased 5.2 years for males and 3.1 years for females between 2006 and 2014.|$|E
25|$|The UAE {{spends more}} than any <b>other</b> <b>country</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> to {{influence}} U.S. policy and shape domestic debate, and it pays former high-level government officials who worked with it {{to carry out its}} agenda within the U.S. The largest expatriate presence in the UAE is Indian. Following British withdrawal from the UAE in 1971 and the establishment of the UAE as a state, the UAE disputed rights to a number of islands in the Persian Gulf against Iran. The UAE {{went so far as to}} bring the matter to the United Nations, but the case was dismissed. The dispute has not significantly impacted relations because of the large Iranian community presence and strong economic ties.|$|E
25|$|The {{state of}} human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran has been criticized both by Iranians and {{international}} human right activists, writers, and NGOs. The United Nations General Assembly and the Human Rights Commission have condemned prior and ongoing abuses in Iran in published critiques and several resolutions. The government of Iran is criticized both for restrictions and punishments that follow the Islamic Republic's constitution and law, and for actions by state actors that do not, such as the torture, rape, and killing of political prisoners, and the beatings and killings of dissidents and other civilians. Iran executes more prisoners than any <b>other</b> <b>country</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> with the exception of China, beating out its regional rival Saudi Arabia by nearly an order of magnitude.|$|E

25|$|Through the {{juvenile}} {{courts and the}} adult criminal justice system, the United States incarcerates more of its youth than any <b>other</b> <b>country</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> {{a reflection of the}} larger trends in incarceration practices in the United States. This {{has been a source of}} controversy for a number of reasons, including the overcrowding and violence in youth detention facilities, the prosecution of youths as adults and the long term consequences of incarceration on the individual's chances for success in adulthood. In 2014, the United Nations Human Rights Committee criticized the United States for about ten judicial abuses, including the mistreatment of juvenile inmates. A UN report published in 2015 criticized the US for being the only nation in the world to sentence juveniles to life imprisonment without parole.|$|E
25|$|Anti-Americanism is {{felt very}} {{strongly}} in Jordan and {{has been on the}} rise since at least 2003. Despite the fact that Jordan is one of America's closest allies in the Middle East and the Government of Jordan is pro-American and pro-Western, the anti-Americanism of Jordanians is {{among the highest in the}} world. Anti-Americanism rose dramatically after the 2003 invasion of Iraq, when the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and many other allies, invaded Iraq to remove Saddam Hussein from power. According to several Pew Research Attitudes polls conducted since 2003, 99% of Jordanians viewed the U.S. unfavorably and 82% of Jordanians viewed American people unfavorably. Although negative attitudes have gone down to 85%, anti-Americanism is still amongst the most widespread in Jordan than any <b>other</b> <b>country</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b>|$|E
25|$|Lord Ashley {{now retired}} to the Netherlands, {{where he became}} acquainted with Jean Leclerc, Pierre Bayle, Benjamin Furly, the English Quaker merchant, at whose house Locke had resided during his stay at Rotterdam, and {{probably}} Limborch {{and the rest of}} the literary circle of which Locke had been a cherished and honoured member nine or ten years before. To Lord Ashley this society was probably far more congenial than his surroundings in England. Unrestrained conversation on the topics which most interested him—philosophy, politics, morals, religion—was at this time to be had in the Netherlands with less danger and in greater abundance than in any <b>other</b> <b>country</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> To the period of this sojourn in the Netherlands must probably be referred the surreptitious impression or publication of an imperfect edition of the Inquiry concerning Virtue, from a rough draught, sketched when he was only twenty years of age. This liberty was taken, during his absence, by Toland.|$|E
