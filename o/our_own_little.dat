They settled in California, where Wanda, always fond of nature, was delighted {{to be able to}} raise her own garden. In a letter to a friend, Szigeti describes their California life: Wanda is happy, doing wonders with her gardening, chicken and rabbit raising, preserve and pâté de foie making. She doesn't budge from our place, doesn't {{want to come back to}} New York even for a visit, which I, for one, can well understand! Two dogs, an aviary full of exotic birds, tomatoes, grapes, strawberries, asparagus, artichokes, lovely flowers (camellias too!), right in <b>our</b> <b>own</b> <b>little</b> world.|$|E
500|$|This {{episode was}} written by Glen Morgan and James Wong and {{directed}} by David Nutter. Originally, the season two premiere {{was supposed to be}} written by series creator Chris Carter. In the rough draft of this version, Mulder would have been sent to Moscow. Carter, instead, assigned Morgan and Wong the task of writing the season opener. Before working on The X-Files, Morgan had written a script with the same name about a man who goes to a telescope located in Chile. The script was never made, but Morgan liked various elements of it, so he cannibalized parts for [...] "Little Green Men". In addition, the episode was specifically written for Mulder to question himself and his beliefs. According to the two writers, one of the main themes of the episode is “the idea that we all have to fight <b>our</b> <b>own</b> <b>little</b> green men and carry on.” ...|$|E
500|$|Tiring of the {{guessing}} game, some newspapers {{descended to}} satire. [...] The New Orleans Daily Picayune surveyed the lengthy {{list of candidates}} and announced that [...] "the authors of The Bread Winners [...] will all meet at Chautauqua next summer". Another columnist suggested that a statistic {{be put in the}} next census for the number of people named as the author. The appearance of President Arthur's annual message to Congress in December 1883 caused the Rochester Herald to opine that he had written The Bread-Winners [...] "because a careful comparison of his message with the story shows many words common to both". Another Upstate New York paper, the Troy Times, evoked Parson Weems's tales of George Washington: [...] "We cannot tell a lie. [...] We wrote The Bread winners [...] with <b>our</b> <b>own</b> <b>little</b> hatchet. [...] If any one doubts it, we can show him the hatchet." [...] This admission, the Buffalo Express felt, should {{put an end to the}} discussion.|$|E

"I almost wish {{we were at}} {{home with}} <b>our</b> <b>own</b> kind <b>little</b> mothers," [...] began Flo, for even her spirits were {{depressed}} by bad treatment, but just then a door opened and she cried out in amazement, [...] "Bless my heart, this man has more children than even Mr. Poppleheimer!" ...|$|R

500|$|NBC {{wanted the}} game's prime time {{portions}} aired live from an outdoor location in Manhattan {{with the city}} skyline for background. Production designer Anton Goss, who also designed the set for NBC's The Voice, {{came up with a}} three-story bent-steel structure {{in the shape of a}} giant hourglass laced with lights and containing the custom-made Money Chair - [...] "...on a rooftop with the city behind us...we have to do something significant...It's like we're building <b>our</b> <b>own</b> <b>little</b> skyscraper." [...] Because of the 18,000 lb weight of the hourglass structure in addition to bleachers full of audience members during show times, the building's rooftop required shoring so that the second floor could help carry the large loads. Geiger Engineers provided the structural engineering for the hourglass and other rooftop structures as well as the required rooftop shoring. Two years after the U.S. version of the show was broadcast, an international version of the show aired on China's Hunan TV in September 2015, entitled [...]|$|E
500|$|In her {{review for}} the About.com, Nancy Basile's review was mixed to {{positive}} {{and gave the}} episode a score of four out of five. She wrote, [...] "...though I disagree {{with a few of}} the animator's choices, this Christmas special is a treat." [...] Basile criticized its characters especially the use of foam to create the characters and the way Santa Claus was depicted saying [...] "...he looks like a pig with liver spots." [...] The animators responded to this comment about their interpretation of Santa Claus, saying [...] "We definitely wanted to keep an element of strangeness, almost scary aspects in the story." [...] Caballero explained that the idea of making Santa Claus look tired and strange came when they saw a drawing of him by Marc Ceccarelli or Luke Brookshier. Caballero said, [...] "We thought that was a great idea. So we came up with <b>our</b> <b>own</b> <b>little</b> back story where Bikini Bottom is the last stop for Santa. He's tired, he wants to get home, take his shoes off ... We honed in on the old descriptions of Santa being a jolly old elf. We pictured him as humanoid, but not necessarily directly human." ...|$|E
500|$|The Wrong Goodbye {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics and garnered {{an audience of}} 1.36 million viewers. New York Magazine drew out the references from past seasons and commented on how the season finale was written. [...] "The Last Episode of the Fourth Season of the Greatest Show of Our Time felt in many ways like {{it might have been}} written to end the series, what with the many This Is Your Life moments (such as the return of Georgina Sparks and Blair's old minions Izzy and Kati), the wry references to episodes past, the wrapping up of story lines (including the revelation that Dan has been secretly novelizing his observations of the Upper East Side for the entire time we've thought we've [...] "known" [...] him), and the meaningful departure of its most marketable star to none other than Hollywood." [...] Critical praise went to the storyline twist behind Charlie's identity, citing her as [...] "the big “shocker” of the Gossip Girl finale" [...] and the cameo appearance of Gossip Girl author, Cecily von Ziegesar. Television Without Pity included the episode in its gallery of [...] "Season Finales 2011: The Best and Worst", declaring the finale {{as one of the best}} and stating that it [...] "had a lot of storylines pay off" [...] and [...] "was <b>our</b> <b>own</b> <b>little</b> version of a fairy tale." ...|$|E

6000|$|Ah! why do we, even in {{religious}} and moral matters, {{even in the}} doing good to the souls and bodies of our fellow-creatures, allow ourselves to be the puppets of fashions? Of fashions which even when harmless, even beautiful, are but the garments, or rather stage-properties, in which we dress up the high instincts which God's Spirit bestows on us, {{in order to make}} them agreeable enough for <b>our</b> <b>own</b> prejudices, or pretty enough for <b>our</b> <b>own</b> tastes. How <b>little</b> do we perceive <b>our</b> <b>own</b> danger--so <b>little</b> that we yield to it every day--the danger of mistaking our fashion of doing good for the good done; aye, for the very Spirit of God Who inspires that good; mistaking the garment for the person who wears it, the outward and visible sign for the inward and spiritual grace; and so in our hearts falling actually into that very error of transubstantiation, of which we repudiate the name! ...|$|R
500|$|Brian Epstein {{managed the}} Beatles from 1962 until his {{untimely}} death in 1967. He had no prior experience managing artists, {{but he had}} a strong influence on the group's dress code and attitude on stage. Lennon initially resisted his attempts to encourage the band to present a professional appearance, but eventually complied, saying, [...] "I'll wear a bloody balloon if somebody's going to pay me". McCartney took over on bass after Sutcliffe decided to stay in Hamburg, and Pete Best was replaced with drummer Ringo Starr; this completed the four-piece line-up that would entertain millions of fans until the group's break-up in 1970. The band's first single, [...] "Love Me Do", was released in October 1962 and reached No. 17 on the British charts. They recorded their debut album, Please Please Me, in under 10 hours on 11 February 1963, a day when Lennon was suffering the effects of a cold, which is evident in the vocal on the last song to be recorded that day, [...] "Twist and Shout". The Lennon–McCartney songwriting partnership yielded eight of its fourteen tracks. With few exceptions—one being the album title itself—Lennon had yet to bring his love of wordplay to bear on his song lyrics, saying: [...] "We were just writing songs... pop songs with no more thought of them than that—to create a sound. And the words were almost irrelevant". In a 1987 interview, McCartney said that the other Beatles idolised John: [...] "He was like <b>our</b> <b>own</b> <b>little</b> Elvis... We all looked up to John. He was older and he was very much the leader; he was the quickest wit and the smartest." ...|$|E
2500|$|It was {{announced}} in May 2009 that a reimagining of the 1983 miniseries V created by Kenneth Johnson, had been picked up by ABC. Cast member Mitchell noted that the show would do service to the most iconic moments from the original franchise. Executive producer Scott Peters later confirmed that the new series would incorporate memorable elements of the original, including [...] "the huge ships [...] the red uniforms" [...] seen in the pilot, as: [...] "we {{are well aware of}} those moments and looking to put <b>our</b> <b>own</b> <b>little</b> spin on them to tip our hat to the old audience." [...] Asked about the 1983 reveal of the Visitors' reptilian appearance beneath their human disguise, Peters noted of the reimagining: [...] "We tried to put our own [...] We're ... a little bit different than their execution of it. It wasn't so much latex mask as it is real flesh and blood." ...|$|E
2500|$|Author Michael Zager {{wrote that}} Pet Sounds resembles Spector's {{productions}} {{more than it}} does Rubber Soul, and that it recycles many of Spector's Wall of Sound production watermarks. Wilson talked of Spector's influence on his work, having learned how to produce records through attending his sessions, and in a 1988 interview, Wilson asserted that the album aspired to [...] "extend" [...] Spector's music, that [...] "in one sense of the word, we [...] were his messengers." [...] In Pet Sounds, Wilson sought to emulate Spector's Wall of Sound, driven by his fascination with [...] "combining one [...] to make another... It's amazing". Shortly before the album's release, Wilson spoke of recent popular music trends, saying [...] " [...] helped the Beach Boys evolve. We listen to what's happening and it affects what we do too. The trends have influenced my work, but so has my own scene." [...] In 1996, Wilson said of his partnership with Asher: [...] "none of us looked back... We went forward, kind of like on <b>our</b> <b>own</b> <b>little</b> wavelength. It wasn't like we were thinking, 'Okay, let's beat Spector,' let's out-do Motown.' It was more what I would call exclusive collaboration not to specifically try to kick somebody's butt, but just {{to do it the}} way you really want it to be. That's what I thought we did." ...|$|E

Terry Corso, the band's guitarist, addressed this in an MTV interview {{on the set of}} the music video, saying, [...] "We want to pay homage to Michael Jackson, but on our level.
