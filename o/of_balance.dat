Second, the creation of dual branches of police to investigate particular crimes: one which presumes the innocence of the accused, the other presuming guilt (Russell 1938:233).|$|E

40|$|A {{different}} approach to the theory <b>of</b> <b>balancing</b> numbers is possible {{by means of a}} Pell’s equation which can be derived from the definition <b>of</b> <b>balancing</b> numbers. Each balancing number corresponds to a balancer, and each balancer, in turn, is a cobalancing number. Similarly, each cobalancing number corresponds to a cobalancer and interestingly, each cobalancer is a balancing number. The cobalancing numbers as well as their cobalancers are also solutions of a Diophantine equation similar to that satisfied by balancing numbers and their balancers. Some Diophantine equations exhibit beautiful solutions in terms <b>of</b> <b>balancing</b> and cobalancing numbers. The Lucas-balancing and Lucas-cobalancing numbers, obtained respectively as functions <b>of</b> <b>balancing</b> and cobalancing numbers, are useful in the computation <b>of</b> <b>balancing</b> and cobalancing numbers of higher order.
