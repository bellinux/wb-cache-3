40|$|A {{significant}} issue encountered when fusing data {{received from}} multiple sensors is {{the accuracy of}} the timestamp associated with each piece of data. This is particularly important in applications such as Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) where vehicle velocity forms {{an important part of the}} mapping algorithms; on fastmoving vehicles, even millisecond inconsistencies in data timestamping can produce errors which need to be compensated for. The timestamping problem is compounded in a robot swarm environment due to the use of non-deterministic readily-available hardware (such as 802. 11 -based wireless) and inaccurate clock synchronisation protocols (such as Network Time Protocol (NTP)). As a result, the synchronisation of the clocks between robots can be out by tens-to-hundreds of milliseconds making correlation of data difficult and preventing the possibility of the units performing synchronised actions such as triggering cameras or intricate swarm manoeuvres. In this thesis, a complete data fusion unit is designed, implemented and tested. The unit, named BabelFuse, is able to accept sensor data from a number of low-speed communication buses (such as RS 232, RS 485 and CAN Bus) and also timestamp events that occur on General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) pins referencing a submillisecondaccurate wirelessly-distributed "global" clock signal. In addition to its timestamping capabilities, it can also be used to trigger an attached camera at a predefined start time and frame rate. This functionality enables the creation of a wirelessly-synchronised distributed image acquisition system over a large geographic area; a real world application for this functionality is the creation of a platform to facilitate wirelessly-distributed 3 D stereoscopic vision. A ‘best-practice’ design methodology is adopted within the project to ensure the final system operates according to its requirements. Initially, requirements are generated from which a high-level architecture is distilled. This architecture is then converted into a hardware specification and low-level design, which is then manufactured. The manufactured hardware is then verified to ensure it operates as designed and firmware and Linux Operating System (OS) drivers are written to provide the features and connectivity required of the system. Finally, integration testing is performed to ensure the unit functions as per its requirements. The BabelFuse System comprises of a single Grand Master unit which is responsible for maintaining the absolute value of the "global" clock. Slave nodes then determine their local <b>clock</b> <b>o.</b> set from that of the Grand Master via synchronisation events which occur multiple times per-second. The mechanism used for synchronising the clocks between the boards wirelessly makes use of specific hardware and a firmware protocol based on elements of the IEEE- 1588 Precision Time Protocol (PTP). With the key requirement of the system being submillisecond-accurate clock synchronisation (as a basis for timestamping and camera triggering), automated testing is carried out to monitor the o. sets between each Slave and the Grand Master over time. A common strobe pulse is also sent to each unit for timestamping; the correlation between the timestamps of the di. erent units is used to validate the <b>clock</b> <b>o.</b> set results. Analysis of the automated test results show that the BabelFuse units are almost threemagnitudes more accurate than their requirement; clocks of the Slave and Grand Master units do not di. er by more than three microseconds over a running time of six hours and the mean <b>clock</b> <b>o.</b> set of Slaves to the Grand Master is less-than one microsecond. The common strobe pulse used to verify the <b>clock</b> <b>o.</b> set data yields a positive result with a maximum variation between units of less-than two microseconds and a mean value of less-than one microsecond. The camera triggering functionality is verified by connecting the trigger pulse output of each board to a four-channel digital oscilloscope and setting each unit to output a 100 Hz periodic pulse with a common start time. The resulting waveform shows a maximum variation between the rising-edges of the pulses of approximately 39 ¥ìs, well below its target of 1 ms...|$|R

It was said afterwards {{that many of the}} houses in the neighbourhood of Palace Yard and the Bridge were filled with soldiers; but if so, the men did not show themselves. In the course of the evening three or four companies of the Guards in St. James's Park did show themselves, and had some rough work to do, for many of the people took themselves away from Westminster by that route. The police, who were very numerous in Palace Yard, had a hard time of it all the afternoon, and it was said afterwards {{that it would have been}} much better to have allowed the petition to have been brought up by the procession on Wednesday. A procession, let it be who it will that proceeds, has in it, of its own nature something of order. But now there was no order. The petition, which was said to fill fifteen cabs,--though the absolute sheets of signatures were carried into the House by four men,--was being dragged about half the day and it certainly would have been impossible for a member to have made his way into the House through Westminster Hall between the hours of four and six. To effect an entrance at all they were obliged to go round at the back of the Abbey, as all the spaces round St. Margaret's Church and Canning's monument were filled with the crowd. Parliament Street was quite impassable at five <b>o</b> <b>clock,</b> and there was no traffic across the bridge from that hour till after eight. As the evening went on, the mob extended itself to Downing Street and the front of the Treasury Chambers, and before the night was over all the hoardings round the new Government offices had been pulled down. The windows also of certain obnoxious members of Parliament were broken, when those obnoxious members lived within reach. One gentleman who unfortunately held a house in Richmond Terrace, and who was said to have said that the ballot was the resort of cowards, fared very badly;--for his windows were not only broken, but his furniture and mirrors were destroyed by the stones that were thrown. Mr. Mildmay, I say, was much blamed. But after all, it may be a doubt whether the procession on Wednesday might not have ended worse.

We find these components respond as differentially to D 2 O as they do to temperature; we conclude, however, with a warning that this result may be equivocal if, as we now suspect, the frequency of circadian oscillations is generally homeostatically conserved—not only in the face of temperature change, but change in any variable to which it is sensitive.

40|$|In {{fruit flies}} Drosophila melanogaster, {{courtship}} is an elaborate ritual comprising chasing, dancing and singing by males to lure females for mating. Courtship interactions {{peak in the}} night and heterosexual couples display enhanced nighttime activity. What we do not know is if such socio-sexual interactions (SSI) leave long-lasting after-effects on circadian clock(s). Here we report the results of our study aimed at examining the after-effects of SSI (as a result of co-habitation of males and females in groups) between males and females on their circadian locomotor activity rhythm. Males undergo reduction in the evening activity peak and lengthening of circadian period, while females show a decrease in overall activity. Such aftereffects, at least in males, require functional circadian clocks during SSI as loss-of-function clock mutants and wild type flies interacting under continuous light (LL), do not display them. Interestingly, males with electrically silenced Pigment Dispersing Factor (PDF) -positive ventral lateral (LNv) clock neurons continue to show SSI mediated reduction in evening activity peak, suggesting that the LNv clock neurons are dispensable for SSI mediated after-effects on locomotor activity rhythm. Such after-effects in females may not be clock-dependent because clock manipulated females with prior exposure to males show decrease in overall activity, more or less similar to rhythmic wild type females. The expression of SSI mediated after-effects requires a functional olfactory system in males because males with compromised olfactory ability do not display them.

40|$|Most organisms {{anticipate}} daily environmental variations and orchestrate cellular functions {{thanks to}} a circadian clock which entrains robustly to the day/night cycle, despite fluctuations in light intensity due to weather or seasonal variations. Marine organisms are also subjected to fluctuations in light spectral composition as their depth varies, due to differential absorption of different wavelengths by sea water. Studying how light input pathways contribute to circadian clock robustness is therefore important. Ostreococcus tauri, a unicellular picoplanktonic marine green alga with low genomic complexity and simple cellular organization, has become a promising model organism for systems biology. Functional and modeling approaches have shown that a core circadian oscillator based on orthologs of Arabidopsis TOC 1 and CCA 1 clock genes accounts for most experimental data acquired under {{a wide range of}} conditions. Some evidence points at putative light input pathway(s) consisting of a two-component signaling system (TCS) controlled by the only two histidine kinases (HK) of O. tauri. LOVHK is a blue light photoreceptor under circadian control, that is required for circadian clock function. An involvement of Rhodopsin-HK (RhodHK) is also conceivable since rhodopsin photoreceptors mediate blue to green light input in animal circadian clocks. Here, we probe the role of LOVHK and RhodHK in mediating light input to the TOC 1 -CCA 1 oscillator using a mathematical model incorporating the TCS hypothesis. This model agrees with clock gene expression time series representative of multiple environmental conditions in blue or green light, characterizing entrainment by light/dark cycles, free-running in constant light, and resetting. Experimental and theoretical results indicate that both blue and green light can reset <b>O.</b> tauri circadian <b>clock.</b> Moreover, our mathematical analysis suggests that Rhod-HK is a blue-green light receptor and drives the clock together with LOV-HK...|$|R
40|$|Considerando o conceito de épico tal como o analisado por teóricos do teatro como Szondi (2001) e Rosenfeld (2006), este trabalho objetiva empreender a análise de elementos épicos presentes na estrutura de The American <b>Clock</b> (<b>O</b> Relógio Americano, 1980), do dramaturgo norte-{{americano}} Arthur Miller (1915 - 2005). O estudo será de como a forma teatral desta peça (com seus traços épicos) representa cenicamente a Grande Depressão econômica que assolou os Estados Unidos após a quebra da bolsa de valores em 1929 e durante toda a década de 1930. The American Clock conta com mais de 40 personagens (muitos deles também narrado-res) que comentam e ao mesmo tempo vivenciam os problemas gerados pela recessão econô-mica dos anos 1930, em que milhões de pessoas chegaram ao nível da miséria. Embora não seja uma das obras teatrais mais estudadas de Arthur Miller (tanto no contexto americano co-mo no brasileiro), a análise de The American Clock é fundamental para um maior entendimen-to da poética deste autor, tão debatida por críticos e dramaturgos brasileiros: diferentemente do que acontece em outros trabalhos teatrais de sua autoria, Miller assume abertamente, em seus ensaios, a importância do elemento épico para a construção de The American <b>Clock,</b> e <b>o</b> resultado deste uso explícito e consciente do épico por parte do dramaturgo é uma utiliza-ção mais abrangente e aprofundada de recursos épicos nesta peça, tanto dos que já eram co-muns em outras obras de Miller (personagens-narradores, por exemplo), quanto novos recur-sos como a dança e a música. Outra consequência desta consciência do épico é a apropria-ção que o autor faz de conceitos como o de mural, vaudeville e narrativa oral para a constru-ção formal da peça. Esta preocupação de Arthur Miller em considerar o épico na criação de The American Clock existe, dentre outras coisas, devido à necessidade de representar cenica-mente a Depressão econômica, uma temática de cunho social, econômico e histórico, cujas transformações sociais, políticas e culturais que ela provocou são cruciais por reverberarem em outras décadas da história dos EUA (e, consequentemente, no processo histórico de outros países como o Brasil). Considering {{the concept}} of epic in theater theories such as Szondis (2001) and Rosenfelds (2006), this research aims at analyzing the epic elements present {{in the structure of}} The Amer-ican Clock (1980), a play by the American playwright Arthur Miller (1915 - 2005). The objec-tive is to study how this plays theatrical form (with its epic traces) puts on stage the Great Depression, which was responsible for devastating The United States economy after the 1929 stock market crash and during the 1930 s. The American Clock contains more than 40 charac-ters (many of them are also narrators) who simultaneously discuss and experience the eco-nomic problems generated by this 1930 s recession, which led millions of people to face mis-ery in this period. Although The American Clock is not one of Millers most studied theatrical works (both in Brazilian and American context), the analysis of this play is essential to a bet-ter understanding of the authors poetics, largely discussed by Brazilian critics and play-wrights: Miller overtly declares, in his essays, the importance of the epic element in The American Clocks creation, which is something singular in this playwrights career. The result of this explicit and conscious use of the epic by Miller is a deepened and broadened inser-tion of epic resources in this play, both the ones already present in other Millers works (char-acters-narrators, for example), and new ones such as dance and music. Another consequence of this epic consciousness is the authors use of concepts such as mural, vaudeville and oral narrative in order to create the form of the play. Arthur Millers concern in considering the epic in the creation of The American Clock exists, among other things, due to the necessity of putting on stage the Great Depression, a social, economic and historical subject, which brought crucial changes responsible for affecting socially, politically and culturally other dec-ades of American history (and, consequently, this 1930 s economic crisis also affected the his-torical process of other countries such as Brazil) ...|$|R
40|$|Relógios biológicos são mecanismos endógenos de marcar a passagem do tempo e podem ser encontrados em animais, plantas, fungos e até organismos unicelulares. No modelo Drosophila, o mecanismo {{molecular}} que controla os ritmos circadianos (~ 24 horas) funciona através de alças de retroalimentação negativa envolvendo alguns genes, sendo os principais: period, timeless, cycle e <b>Clock.</b> <b>Os</b> homólogos destes genes já foram encontrados em várias espécies de animais, apontando para uma origem ancestral comum. Mosquitos são vetores de diversos agentes causadores de doenças a humanos e animais, mas apesar da sua importância epidemiológica pouco se conhece sobre os mecanismos moleculares que controlam os ritmos de atividade e hematofagia neste grupo de insetos. O presente trabalho objetivou o estudo do relógio biológico circadiano em mosquitos, usando como modelos a espécie diurna Aedes aegypti e a noturna Culex quinquefasciatus Os estudos moleculares foram sempre acompanhados de experimentos de monitoramento da atividade/repouso dos insetos. A primeira etapa da pesquisa compreendeu a obtenção em Ae. aegypti da seqüência codificante integral do gene homologo {{a timeless}} de Drosophila melanogaster e o estudo comparativo da seqüência do mesmo entre as duas espécies. Os resultados apontaram para uma alta similaridade em regiões de timeless conhecidas como importantes em Drosophila para manutenção do relógio biológico, sugerindo conservação de sua função nos mosquitos. A segunda etapa da pesquisa envolveu a determinação do padrão de expressão circadiana de period, timeless, cycle e Clock em mosquitos. Após estudos preliminares sobre a expressão de timeless e cycle em machos de Aedes aegypti, foram obtidas as curvas de expressão circadiana de period, timeless, cycle e Clock na cabeça de fêmeas de Ae. aegypti e Cx. quinquefasciatus Os resultados sugerem que o relógio central funcione de forma muito semelhante nas duas espécies. Análise da expressão desses genes nos corpos decapitados das fêmeas de Ae. aegypti, entretanto, aponta para padrões diferentes de expressão em relação à cabeça. Foi analisado também o efeito da inseminação e da hematofagia na expressão dos genes de relógio em Ae. aegypti. Apesar de dados da literatura mostrarem que a inseminação e a alimentação com sangue (após inseminação), causam alteração no comportamento das fêmeas de mosquito, apenas a hematofagia parece exercer alteração significativa na expressão dos genes de relógio. Finalizando, foi efetuado o silenciamento de timeless em Ae. aegypti por técnica de RNA de interferência, através da injeção de RNA dupla-fita de timeless no tórax de fêmeas adultas. O silenciamento da expressão foi detectado tanto na cabeça quanto no corpo das fêmeas no quarto dia após a injeção do RNA dupla-fita, mesmo dia em que foi detectada alteração no padrão de comportamento. Esse resultado confirma o papel de timeless no controle da atividade em mosquitosBiological clocks are endogenous time keepi ng systems {{that can be}} found in animals, plants, fungi and even unicellular organisms. In the Drosophila model, the molecular mechanism that controls the circadian rhythm (~ 24 hours) works through negative feedback loops composed of a number of genes, among which the principal genes are: period, timeless, cycle and Clock. The homologues of these genes have been found in many animal species and their comparison points to a common ancestral origin. Mosquitoes ar e vectors of several organisms and viruses that cause diseases in hu mans and other animals, however despite their epidemiological relevance not much is known about the molecular mechanisms controlling their activity rhythms and bloodfeedin g behaviour. The purpose of the present work was to investigate the molecular regulati on of the biological clock in mo squitoes, using as models the diurnal species Aedes aegypti and the nocturnal species Culex quinquefasciatus. Analysis of the mosquitoes’ activity/rest behaviour was performed in parallel to the molecular studies. The first stage of this research was to obtain, in Aedes aegypti, the full coding sequence of the gene homologue to the timeless gene of Drosophila melanogaster and to perform comparative analysis between them. The results s howed high similarities between the timeless gene of the two species, mainly in regions known, in Drosophila, to have a crucial involvement in the operation of the biological clock, thus sugg esting function conservation of the gene in mosquitoes. The second stage of the research involved the determination of the patterns of expression of the clock genes period, timeless, cycle and Clock in mosquitoes. After preliminary studies of male Ae. aegypti, in which the temporal pattern of the expression of timeless and cycle was determined, the circadian expression of period, timeless, cycle and Clock was characterised in the heads of females of the species Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus. The results suggest that the central clock works in a very similar way in both species. The expression of the same four genes in the behead ed bodies of females of Ae. aegypti, however, showed a pattern {{different from that of the}} head. The effect s of insemination and blood meal intake upon the expression of clock genes in Ae. aegypti were also analysed. In spite of the data in the literature showing that insemination drives important change s in the behaviour of the female mosquito, in this study only the intake of blood seemed to cau se significant changes in the expression of the clock genes. To finalize the st udy of the biological clock in mosquitoes, silencing of the timeless gene in the head and body of Ae. aegypti mosquitoes was performed using an interference RNA technique in which the thoraxes of adult females were injected with timeless double-stranded RNA. Silencing of gene expre ssion was achieved on the fourth da y after injection, the same day in which a significant alteration of the activity pattern of these females was detected. This result confirms the role of timeless in the control of activity behaviour in mosquitoe...|$|R

The original {{face of the}} watch, now called 'O clock Classic' consisted of a plain white face without numbers. The face can {{be removed from the}} strap allowing the colour of the strap or face to be changed. There were originally 15 straps but this has grown to 29 which are still in production. Fullspot’s watch packaging takes inspiration from the tin can, a cylindrical tin with a ring pull. <b>O</b> <b>clock</b> developed into a series with the Tone on Tone range consisting of 21 watch face colours to mix and match with 21 straps making a total of 441 possible combinations with Tone on Tone. Other <b>O</b> <b>clock</b> ranges include Camouflage, 80’ clock, Disney, Gold & Silver, Mirror, Numbers, Flower Power and Safari.|$|E
