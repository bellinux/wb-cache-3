40|$|Asphalt {{emulsions}} {{are one of}} {{the alternatives}} for stabilizing base layers. The use of asphalt emulsion treated mixtures can be cost effective especially in cold regions where supplying hot mix is not economical. However, in cold climates emulsion <b>aggregate</b> <b>mixtures</b> show low strength at early ages and require a longer curing time to develop breaking of asphalt emulsions throughout the aggregates. The breaking period depends on the rate of water loss from the mixture which is impacted by ambient temperatures. Type of asphalt emulsion, curing temperature, curing time and moisture content are four significant factors in early age development of engineering properties of the emulsion base <b>aggregate</b> <b>mixture.</b> In this study, a proposed dense-graded gravel base material was treated with an anionic slow setting emulsion with low viscosity (SS- 1). In order to evaluate early curing, one set of samples was cured for 7 days at another set was cured at 24 C. Dynamic resilient modulus and permanent deformation tests were performed to assess the effect of curing and temperature on stiffness and resistance to the repeated traffic load. The study showed that high resilient modulus and low deformation values were attained for 7 days curing at 24 ° C.

40|$|It {{has been}} well {{demonstrated}} that a positive subsurface drainage is beneficial in enhancing pavement performance and thus extending pavement service life. Typical permeable base materials include asphalt/cement-treated, <b>open-graded</b> <b>aggregates</b> and unbound <b>aggregates.</b> Although asphalt/cement-treated, <b>open-graded</b> permeable bases perform well based on the past engineering practice, they are expensive solutions and less desirable for some roadways when compared to unbound aggregates, especially for low- to medium-volume roadways. In these situations, {{it is possible to}} use a properly graded unbound aggregate that is adequately drainable and structurally stable during the construction and service lifetime after the roadway is open to traffic. This study is to determine a proper/optimum gradation by conducting laboratory testing for unbound aggregates of Mexican limestone that are commonly used in Louisiana highways. However, there is trade-off between structural stability and permeability of unbound aggregates. The increase of permeability is often at the cost of structural stability or vice verse. Therefore, the criteria for selecting an optimum gradation are: (1) an adequate permeability to drain the infiltrated-water from the pavement as quickly as possible; and (2) a sufficient structural stability to support the traffic loading. The permeability of unbound aggregate is quantified by its saturated hydraulic conductivity while its structural stability is characterized by variou...|$|R
40|$|The {{utilization}} of porous asphalt mixtures {{has become increasingly}} important. This type of pavement {{has been used in}} many developed countries for many years with the addition of by-products to reduce the consumption of aggregates in road construction. Recently, the Malaysian Public Works Department (PWD) launched specifications for specialty mixtures and surface treatments, including porous asphalt. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the use of steel slag as a conventional aggregate replacement in porous asphalt mixtures. Two porous asphalt gradations, designated as Grade A and Grade B, were used in this study in accordance with the new specification - JKR/SPJ/ 2008 -S 4. Steel slag was chosen because its characteristics are quite similar to those of aggregates compared with other by-products such as crumb rubber, glass and many more. It was observed that steel slag aggregate meets all the criteria of the PWD specification except for the water absorption test. The samples of steel slag <b>aggregate</b> <b>mixtures</b> produced were tested for resilient modulus, rutting and permeability, which were later compared with conventional <b>aggregate</b> <b>mixtures.</b> The results show that there is a significant difference in terms of resilient modulus between the steel slag aggregate-based mixture and the conventional aggregate-based mixture.

However the mixtures made from conventional aggregate had higher permeability values compared to the steel slag mixtures.

The investigated properties are unconfined compressive strength, indirect tensile strength, indirect tensile static modulus, toughness, dynamic modulus of elasticity, dynamic modulus of rigidity and dynamic Poisson's ratio. Increasing cement content increases strength of both types of mixtures, especially in the CSAMs. It is found that using crumb rubber at low cement content is more feasible than with high cement contents.

In this previous study, three test sections were constructed in a new pavement on a by-pass around Fort Wayne Indiana. These test sections were instrumented to record temperatures, moisture, frost penetration, rainfall and subdrainage system outflow. Collected data and Finite Element Method (FEM) analysis indicate the systems are performing satisfactorily. However, concern developed over the stability and rutting characteristics of the open-graded drainage layers.

Hence, Si, Al and Ca species were dissolved to form C–S–H gel through polymerization resulting in a higher compressive strength of CLSM.

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} ensure the bearing {{capacity}} and durability of road pavement in cold climate areas, it is necessary use materials which are resistant to harmful frost impact, known as frost-heaving. Frost heave cause adverse volume changes, the upwards swelling of the pavement after freezing and deterioration of the bearing capacity of the structure after thawing. In winter, road carriageway temperatures may reach tmin = - 30 ̊C under Polish conditions, which results in the freezing of the structural pavement and subgrade layers. Due to frost penetration into the pavement and the subgrade, heaves may form in soils and in structural layers (unbound mixtures), and during the thaw period {{a high level of}} moisture is maintained in the frozen layers, and therefore the structure has a low bearing capacity. The aim of this research was to evaluate frost susceptibility of <b>aggregates</b> <b>mixtures</b> based on content of fine-grain fractions and plasticity index IP. Potential frost susceptibility of road materials and soils is determined by laboratory testing. Frost susceptibility is connected directly with the content and quality of fines, which is why the basic test is that material grading. The criterion based on fines content is the most frequently used indicator in determining frost susceptibility for soils. The article shows whether the limit values adopted for this criterion are also applicable to aggregates. The results of frost-heaving properties are presented of 14 typical natural <b>aggregate</b> road <b>mixtures,</b> continuously graded 0 / 31. 5 mm.

For the French aggregate, all the necessary properties were given by the RRT coordinator, including grain density of particular fraction and its coefficient of water absorption. Recycled aggregate was obtained by crushing and sieving of concrete rubble. The grain density and the coefficient of water absorption of coarse fractions of recycled aggregates were determined in laboratory of UL FGG.

Chromatographically reproducible cuts of relatively narrow size heterogeneity were obtained by 15 min time fractionation. The reactivity of sized aggregates was studied with pooled purified IgM rheumatoid factor {{as well as with}} various individual IgM RF sera. The inhibition of agglutination method employing IgG-coated tanned sheep cells was used to assay relative reactivities. With all RF preparations studied, reactivity of sized IgG was primarily a function of aggregate size. Reactivity increased from virtually zero with monomeric IgG to maximal values with aggregates in the 10 (6) size range. Larger aggregates (mol. wt. 10 (7) or greater) exhibited diminishing and ultimately negligible reactivity. Reactivity of aggregates of given size was independent of heating time but increased with decrease in heating temperature. The maximal reactivity of certain sizes of IgG aggregates with RF suggests that at least two factors are operative. Enhanced reactivity may be due to unblocking of potential reactive sites on IgG during denaturation that precedes aggregation or to the more favourable energetics of binding with aggregates as compared to monomer. Subsequent loss of reactivity may be due to steric hindrance in large aggregates and/or to destruction of binding sites as a result of continued denaturation...|$|R
40|$|Porous {{pavement}} is {{a special}} type of pavement that allows rain and snowmelt to pass through it, thereby reducing the runoff from a site and surrounding areas. In addition, porous pavement filters some pollutants from the runoff if maintained. There {{are two types of}} porous pavement: porous asphalt and pervious concrete. Porous asphalt pavement consists of an <b>open-graded</b> coarse <b>aggregate,</b> bonded together by asphalt cement, with sufficient interconnected voids to make it highly permeable to water. Pervious concrete consists of specially formulated mixtures of Portland cement, uniform, <b>open-graded</b> coarse <b>aggregate,</b> and water. Pervious concrete has enough void space to allow rapid percolation of liquids through the pavement. The porous pavement surface is typically placed over a highly permeable layer of open-graded gravel and crushed stone. The void spaces in the aggregate layers act as a storage reservoir for runoff. A filter fabric is placed beneath the gravel and stone layers to screen out fine soil particles. Figure 1 illustrates a common porous asphalt pavement installation. Two common modifications made in designing porous pavement systems are (1) varying the amount of storage in the stone reservoir beneath the pavement and (2) adding perforated pipes {{near the top of the}} reservoir to discharge excess storm water after the reservoir has been filled. Some municipalities have also added storm water reservoirs (in addition to stone reservoirs) beneath the pavement. These reservoirs should be designed to accommodate runoff from a design storm and should provide for infiltration through the underlying subsoil.

Brown and Bassett [6] studied the effects of maximum aggregate size (MAS) on the properties of asphalt <b>aggregate</b> <b>mixtures</b> by conducting studies on five different aggregate gradations with five MAS’s. Xie et al. [10] and Cooley and Hurley [11] studied the performance of SMA mixtures with different nominal maximum aggregate sizes (NMAS) (9.5 and 4.75  mm). The basic principle of SMA lies on the coarse aggregate skeleton, and {{it is very important to}} achieve proper stone-to-stone contact with good quality aggregates for any SMA <b>mixture.</b> Coarse <b>aggregates</b> with Los Angeles abrasion value < 30  % were observed to give better performance to SMA [12]. Inferior quality aggregates may lead to aggregate break down during mixing and compaction, which could alter the mix gradation, potentially causing a loss of stone-on-stone contact between the coarse aggregate particles [13].|$|R
40|$|Clustering {{methods are}} {{designed}} to separate heterogeneous data into groups of sim-ilar objects such that objects within a group are similar, and objects in different groups are dissimilar. From the machine learning perspective, clustering can also be viewed {{as one of the}} most important topics within the unsupervised learning problem, which involves finding structures in a collection of unlabeled data. Various clustering methods have been developed under different problem contexts. Specif-ically, high dimensional data has stimulated a high level of interest in combining clustering algorithms and variable selection procedures; large data sets with expand-ing dimension have provoked an increasing need for relevant, customized clustering algorithms that offer the ability to detect low probability clusters. This dissertation focuses on the model-based Bayesian approach to clustering. I first develop a new Bayesian Expectation-Maximization algorithm in fitting Dirichlet process mixture models and an algorithm to identify clusters under <b>mixture</b> mod-els by <b>aggregating</b> <b>mixture</b> components. These two algorithms are used extensivel...|$|R
40|$|The use of clay {{alone or}} amended with {{aggregates}} as core material of embankment dams and backfill materials for nuclear waste disposal is common. Composite clay {{is a mixture}} of clay, as the main body and aggregates which are floating within the clayey matrix. The hydraulic conductivity of composite clay in its natural or compacted has great importance for geotechnical engineers. An extensive test program was conducted on clayaggregate mixtures to investigate various effects of aggregate content, aggregate size, confining stress and fabric anisotropy on the hydraulic properties of mixtures. Test results reveal that hydraulic conductivity of clay <b>aggregate</b> <b>mixtures</b> decreases with increase in aggregate content up to an addition of 40 % aggregate. With the addition of more than 40 % aggregate, hydraulic conductivity increases. In addition, the presence of aggregate may induce a heterogeneous field of hydraulic conductivity in the clayey matrix, after specimen preparation in compaction mold, compaction and isotropically or anisotropically consolidation...|$|R
