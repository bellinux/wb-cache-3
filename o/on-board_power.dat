25|$|In Transrapid vehicle {{versions}} TR08 and earlier, when travelling {{at speeds}} below , the vehicle levitation system and all on-board vehicle electronics were supplied with power through physical {{connections to the}} track guideway. At vehicle speeds above , all <b>on-board</b> <b>power</b> was supplied by recovered harmonic oscillation of the magnetic fields created from the track’s linear stator. (Since these oscillations are parasitic, they cannot be used for vehicle propulsion). A new energy transmission system, version TR09, has since been developed for Transrapid, in which maglev vehicles now require no physical contact with the track guideway for their <b>on-board</b> <b>power</b> needs, regardless of the maglev vehicle speed. This feature helps to reduce on-going maintenance and operational costs.|$|E
25|$|For the {{manufacturing}} of the <b>on-board</b> <b>power</b> plant, a contract was {{signed with the}} German MAN Diesel company based in Augsburg. The contract, worth over €100 million, includes the supply of 24 large-bore diesel engines, along with electro-mechanical equipment to be installed on four powerships with a total output of 400 MW. Twenty one of them are of type 18V51/60DF dual-fuel diesel engines {{and the three of}} type 14V48/60 heavy fuel oil engines. The dual-fuel diesel engines allow the powership to generate electricity running either on heavy fuel or natural gas, whatever the infrastructure is available at site.|$|E
40|$|The article {{addresses}} in {{a complex}} way the problem of cooperation between the <b>on-board</b> electric <b>power</b> sources of an aircraft with its on-board electric network. The authors paid special attention to conditions related to correct switching of the <b>on-board</b> electric <b>power</b> sources. Structural protection of the electric power sources against harmful impact of loads, and of the loads against incorrectly operating sources, as well as certain methods to counteract such phenomena, are discussed. Exploring these relations will enable the user to undertake actions which can reduce the failure rate of the <b>on-board</b> electrical <b>power</b> network, and ensure power supply to the electrical loads under all flight conditions. Their correct operation determines correct operation of the <b>on-board</b> electrical <b>power</b> network. The authors tried to discuss all {{the problems in the}} most universal way possible, so the deliberations presented here could be helpful in analyzing defects in various aircrafts...|$|R

40|$|Properly 3 D {{placement}} of {{unmanned aerial vehicle}} mounted base stations (UAV-BSs) can effectively prolong the life-time of the mobile ad hoc network, since UAVs are usually powered by batteries. This paper involves the <b>on-board</b> circuit consumption <b>power</b> and considers the optimal placement that minimizes the UAV-recall-frequency (UAV-RF), which is defined to characterize the life-time {{of this kind of}} network. Theoretical results show that the optimal vertical and horizontal dimensions of UAV can be decoupled. That is, the optimal hovering altitude is proportional to the coverage radius of UAVs, and the slope is only determined by environment. Dense scattering environment may greatly enlarge the needed hovering altitude. Also, the optimal coverage radius is achieved when the transmit <b>power</b> equals to <b>on-board</b> circuit <b>power,</b> and hence limiting <b>on-board</b> circuit <b>power</b> can effectively enlarge life-time of system. In addition, our proposed 3 D placement method only require the statistics of mobile users' density and environment parameters, and hence it's a typical on-line method and can be easily implemented. Also, it can be utilized in scenarios with varying users' density. Comment: 6 pages, 4 figures, submitted to globecom 1...|$|R
40|$|This work {{considers}} {{the placement of}} unmanned aerial vehicle base stations (UAV-BSs) with criterion of minimum UAV-recall-frequency (UAV-RF), indicating the energy efficiency of mobile UAVs networks. Several different power consumptions, including signal transmit <b>power,</b> <b>on-board</b> circuit <b>power</b> and the power for UAVs mobility, and the ground user density are taken into account. Instead of conventional empirical stochastic models, this paper utilizes a pattern formation system to track the instable and non-ergodic time-varying nature of user density. We show that for a single time-slot, the optimal placement is achieved when the transmit power of UAV-BSs equals their <b>on-board</b> circuit <b>power.</b> Then, for multiple time-slot duration, we prove that the optimal placement updating problem is a nonlinear dynamic programming coupled with an integer linear programming. Since the original problem is NP-hard {{and can not be}} solved with conventional recursive methods, we propose a sequential-Markov-greedy-decision method to achieve near minimal UAV-RF in polynomial time. Further, we prove that the increment of UAV-RF caused by inaccurate predicted user density is proportional to the generalization error of learned patterns. Here, in regions with large area, high-rise buildings or low user density, large sample sets are required for effective pattern formation.

50|$|The newest M109 {{version for}} U.S. service is the M109A7, {{formerly}} known as the M109A6 Paladin Integrated Management (PIM). The M109A7 shares common components with the Bradley Fighting Vehicle such as the engine, transmission, and tracks. This creates commonality with other systems and maximizes costs-savings in production, parts inventory, and maintenance personnel. The M109A7's <b>on-board</b> <b>power</b> systems harness technologies originally developed for the Non-Line-of-Sight Cannon; the electric drive is faster than the previous hydraulic system, and the automatic rammer more consistently rams the round into the gun for consistent velocities and better accuracy. It features a 600-volt <b>on-board</b> <b>power</b> system to accommodate additional armor and future networking technologies as they become ready. The M109A7 can sustain a one round per-minute rate of fire and a maximum rate of fire of four rounds per-minute. Weighing 78,000 lb, the M109A7 is 10,000 lb heavier than its predecessor, and it has the capacity to grow to 110,000 lb. Even with the weight increase, the M109A7 can travel faster than previous versions at 38 mph and is more maneuverable than a Bradley Fighting Vehicle.|$|E
