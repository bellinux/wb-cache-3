5|$|Other commercially {{valuable}} products from birds include feathers (especially the down <b>of</b> <b>geese</b> and ducks), {{which are used}} as insulation in clothing and bedding, and seabird faeces (guano), which is a valuable source of phosphorus and nitrogen. The War of the Pacific, sometimes called the Guano War, was fought in part over the control of guano deposits.|$|E

5|$|As well as {{providing}} {{a home for}} some species of birds, Surtsey has also {{been used as a}} stopping-off point for migrating birds, particularly those en-route between Europe and Iceland. Species that have been seen briefly on the island include whooper swans, various species <b>of</b> <b>geese,</b> and common ravens. Although Surtsey lies {{to the west of the}} main migration routes to Iceland, it has become a more common stopping point as its vegetation has improved. In 2008, the 14th bird species was detected with the discovery of a common raven's nest.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{are visible}} in stalls. Behind {{them is a}} {{crumbling}} wall with three low Romanesque windows. Four shepherds in contemporary 15th-century clothing are chatting amiably, leaning against the wall, looking into the shed. Two are positioned {{to the left and}} two to the right; in each pair one is dressed in red and an other in blue. Behind the shed is a small hill where two shepherds herd sheep along a pathway, and beyond is a Netherlandish town with two domed structures in its center, symbolizing Jerusalem and Christ's Passion. The large domed building is based on the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem, a replica of which the Adornes family built in Bruges in 1427, called the Jerusalem chapel. A flock <b>of</b> <b>geese</b> is visible high in the sky through the roof's trusses.|$|E
5|$|The reedbeds, {{the largest}} of which are at the Cley, Salthouse and Titchwell reserves, are {{dominated}} by common reed, and salt marsh rush, brackish water crowfoot, sea clubrush and common bulrush also occur in the various wetland habitats. The coastal pastures at Cley and Salthouse Marshes have jointleaf rush, common silverweed, and less common grasses such as annual beard grass, marsh foxtail, and slender hare's-ear. The flat land just inland from the dunes at Holkham was reclaimed from the marshes by {{the nineteenth century and}} was initially used for grazing. It was made arable during World War II, but the water levels have been raised to make the fields attractive to breeding and wintering birds. The pastures are of international importance for the tens of thousands <b>of</b> <b>geese</b> and ducks that feed there in the winter months.|$|E

40|$|The fast {{real-time}} application {{message is}} an object-oriented substation event—GOOSE (Generic Object Oriented Substation Event). It mainly {{works on the}} process layers and bay layers <b>of</b> digital substation. <b>GOOSE</b> intelligent substation communication network can realize the key function of the overall intelligent sub-station functions. This paper will make a systematic analysis <b>of</b> <b>GOOSE.</b> At first, it will provide {{a detailed analysis of}} the transmission mechanism and process <b>of</b> <b>GOOSE</b> message. As certain practical operability lacks the actual application of the multicast filtering method which is applied to GOOSE message based on IEC 61850 standard, this paper will summarize three message filtering methods, compare the advantages and disadvantages in topological networks of different kinds in accordance with the instantaneity <b>of</b> <b>GOOSE</b> intelligent substation communication network and draw a conclusion that the independent configuration scheme <b>of</b> <b>GOOSE</b> and SV can adapt to the requirement of times, so as to provide theoretical references for the selection of practical intelligent substation communication network in the future...|$|R
5|$|In {{spring and}} early summer, migrant birds {{including}} the little gull, black tern, Temminck's stint and garganey may pass through {{on their way to}} breed elsewhere. In the autumn, birds arrive from the north; some, such as whimbrels, curlew sandpipers and little stints, just pausing for a few days to refuel before continuing south, others staying for the winter. Offshore, great and Arctic skuas, northern gannets and black-legged kittiwakes may pass close by in favourable winds. Large numbers of ducks winter along the coast, including many Eurasian wigeons, Eurasian teals, mallards and gadwalls, goldeneyes and northern pintails. Red-throated divers are usually on the sea, and brent geese feed on sea lettuce and other green algae. Barn owls and sometimes hen harriers quarter the marshes in winter, and snow bunting flocks {{can be found on the}} beaches. Thousands <b>of</b> <b>geese,</b> mainly pink-footed, roost at Holkham.|$|E
5|$|Henri Christophe's {{widow and}} {{children}} are taken to Europe by English merchants, who used to supply the royal family. Solimán accompanies them and enjoys the summers in Rome, where he is treated well and tells embellished tales of his past. He encounters a statue of Pauline whose form brings back memories, and sends him into a howl, causing the room to be rushed. He is reminded of the night of Henri Christophe's demise and flees before succumbing to malaria. Ti Noel recalls things told by Macandal, and the former plantation of Lenormand de Mezy has become a happy place, with Ti Noel presiding over celebrations and festivities. Surveyors disrupt the peace at the plantation, and mulattoes have risen to power; they force hundreds of black prisoners to work by whiplash, and many have lost hope as the cycle of slavery continues. Ti Noel, thinking of Macandal, decides to transform into various animals to observe the ongoing events; he metamorphoses into a bird, a stallion, a wasp, and then an ant. He eventually becomes a goose, but is rejected by the clan <b>of</b> <b>geese.</b> He understands that being a goose {{does not imply that}} all geese are equal, so he returns to human form. The book concludes with the end of Ti Noel's life, and his own self-reflection upon greatness and The Kingdom of This World.|$|E

25|$|Traditionally, {{foie gras}} was {{produced}} from special breeds <b>of</b> <b>geese.</b> However, by 2004, geese accounted {{for less than}} 10% of the total global foie gras production and by 2014 only 5% of total French production. Goose breeds used in modern foie gras production are primarily the grey Landes goose (Anser anser) and the Toulouse goose.|$|E

25|$|On January 15, 2009, US Airways Flight 1549 from LaGuardia Airport to Charlotte/Douglas International Airport ditched {{into the}} Hudson River after {{experiencing}} {{a loss of}} both turbines. It is suspected that the engine failure was caused by running into a flock <b>of</b> <b>geese</b> {{at an altitude of}} about 975 m (3,200 feet), shortly after takeoff. All 150 passengers and 5 crew members were safely evacuated after a successful water landing. On May 28, 2010, the NTSB published its final report into the accident.|$|E
25|$|Like their wild ancestors, {{domestic}} geese {{are very}} protective of their offspring {{and other members}} of the flock. The gander will normally place himself between any perceived threat and his family. Owing to their highly aggressive nature, loud call and sensitivity to unusual movements, geese can contribute towards the security of a property. In late 1950s South Vietnam, the VNAF used flocks <b>of</b> <b>geese</b> to guard their parked aircraft at night due to the noise they would make at intruders.|$|E
25|$|In August 2003, the Supreme Court of Israel {{ordered the}} Israeli Ministry of Agriculture {{to ban the}} force feeding <b>of</b> <b>geese,</b> {{effective}} 31 March 2005. The last appeal was withdrawn in October 2005, but the law was left unenforced until February 2006. Most protest activities were conducted by the Anonymous for Animal Rights organization, which also tracks {{the enforcement of the}} ban, and files complaints against farms that conduct illegal force feeding. In May 2013, a bill proposed by Knesset Member Dov Lipman plans to prohibit all sales of the delicacy due to the controversial methods.|$|E

25|$|In AD 371 Martin was {{acclaimed}} {{bishop of}} Tours, where he impressed {{the city with}} his demeanour. He had been drawn to Tours by a ruse— he was urged to come to minister to someone sick— and {{was brought to the}} church, where he reluctantly allowed himself to be consecrated bishop. According to one version, he was so unwilling to be made bishop that he hid in a barn full <b>of</b> <b>geese,</b> but their cackling at his intrusion gave him away to the crowd; that may account for complaints by a few that his appearance was too disheveled to be commensurate with a bishopric, but the critics were hugely outnumbered.|$|E
