5|$|These guns fired {{two types}} <b>of</b> <b>shells</b> during World War I: armor-piercing (AP) L/3.1 and high {{explosive}} (HE) L/4 types. During World War II, the guns fired {{a wider variety}} <b>of</b> <b>shells,</b> including armor-piercing L/3,4 and L/4,9 types, and high explosive L/3.8, L/5, and L/4.8 shells, as well as specially designed coast defense artillery projectiles. The AP and HE rounds weighed between 405 and 415kg (915lb), while the coastal artillery projectiles weighed only 250kg (551lb).|$|E
5|$|Australia {{returned}} to Sydney in November 1921, and was paid off into reserve in December. By this time battlecruisers built before the Battle of Jutland were considered obsolete, {{and there is}} no record of the Admiralty suggesting that Australia purchase a replacement. Moreover, {{it is unlikely that the}} Australian Government would have agreed to such a suggestion given the prevailing political and financial conditions. As the Admiralty had decided to phase out 12-inch guns and had stopped the manufacture <b>of</b> <b>shells</b> for these weapons shortly after the war, it would have been necessary to replace Australias main armament once the Navy's stock <b>of</b> <b>shells</b> reached their expiry date given that it was not possible to produce replacement shells in Australia. This was also not financially feasible for the government, particularly given the RAN's lack of interest in retaining the ship.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} {{minimise}} the casualties to his brigade, Porter decided {{to isolate the}} Pocket with two infantry companies while a heavy artillery barrage was fired into the area over several days. An attempt to capture the Pocket would only be made once it was judged that the Japanese were no longer capable of resisting effectively. As part of this plan, the 2/12th Field Regiment eventually fired 140 tons <b>of</b> <b>shells</b> into the Pocket between 15 and 20 June.|$|E

5|$|By mid-1917, Haig was {{planning}} an offensive in the heavily defended Ypres region of Flanders. His plan involved {{a series of}} steps, {{the first of which}} was the capture of Messines Ridge by II ANZAC Corps.

5|$|In May 1943 Albert Speer, the Reich's Minister of Armaments and War Production, {{informed}} Adolf Hitler of {{work that}} was being carried out to produce a supergun capable of firing hundreds <b>of</b> <b>shells</b> an hour over long distances. The newly designed gun, codenamed the Hochdruckpumpe ("High Pressure Pump", HDP for short) and later designated as the V-3, {{was one of the}} V-weapons– Vergeltungswaffen ("retaliation weapons")– developed by Nazi Germany in the later stages of the war to attack Allied targets. Long-range guns were not a new development, but the high-pressure detonations used to fire shells from previous such weapons, including the Paris gun, rapidly wore out their barrels.|$|E

5|$|The Cliff House Sandstone is the area's {{youngest}} rock layer. It {{was formed}} after the Cretaceous sea had completely receded {{and as a}} result has a high sand content from beaches, dunes, etc. and from this receives its characteristic yellow tint to its canyon faces. Like the Point Lookout Sandstone, it is about 400 feet thick. It contains numerous fossil beds of different types <b>of</b> <b>shells,</b> fish teeth, and other invertebrate leftovers from the receded sea. The shale zones in this feature determine where alcoves formed where the Ancestral Puebloans constructed their dwellings.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT In these experiments, 2560 {{eggs from}} {{commercial}} laying hens were examined {{to determine the}} effects of age of bird and season of the year on selected egg shell quality charac-teristics. Shell thickness was significantly lower in the summer months. Specific gravity was significantly higher in the younger birds and during the cooler seasons. Age and season significandy affected shell weight and percentage <b>of</b> <b>shell.</b> Shell weight increased with increasing age of bird while percentage <b>of</b> <b>shell</b> decreased. During the spring and summer months both shell weight and per-centage <b>of</b> <b>shell</b> decreased. Shell density was not significantly affected by age of bird but increased during the warmer months <b>of</b> the year. <b>Shell</b> weight per unit of egg surface area decreased during warmer months and no significant age effect was observed.

5|$|The D-1 {{howitzer}} {{was essentially}} {{a combination of the}} barrel of the 152-mm howitzer model 1938 (M-10) on the carriage of the 122-mm howitzer M1938 (M-30). Since the new carriage was lighter than that of the M-10, the barrel was fitted with a massive double-baffle muzzle brake DT-3 to soften the shock of recoil. The breech block was of interrupted screw type, the recoil system consisted of a hydraulic buffer and a hydro-pneumatic recuperator. The separately loaded ammunition included a variety <b>of</b> <b>shells</b> and eight different propellant charges in cartridges.|$|E
5|$|The Muisca played music, {{sang and}} danced mainly {{as part of}} religious, burial and {{initiation}} rituals, with harvests and sowing and after the victory in battles. Also during the construction of their houses, the Muisca performed music and dances. The early Spanish chronicles noted that the music and singing was monotonous and sad. As musical instruments they used drums, flutes made <b>of</b> <b>shells</b> or ceramics, trumpets of gold, zampoñas and ocarinas. At the rituals, the people would be dressed in feathers, animal skins (mainly jaguar) and decorated their bodies with paint. At the dances the women and men held hands and both the commoners and the higher social classes participated in these activities. The main deities associated with the dances were Huitaca and Nencatacoa.|$|E
5|$|Around 9,000 years ago, {{the climate}} warmed, melting {{much of the}} polar ice caps and many glaciers, {{creating}} a wetter environment and submerging half the peninsular shelf. As Paleo-Indians now {{did not have to}} travel as far to find water, their camps became more permanent, turning into villages. With evidence {{of a wide variety of}} tools constructed around this time, archeologists note the transition into Archaic people. The Archaic people made tools from bone, animal teeth, and antlers. They wove fibers from plants such as cabbage palms and saw palmettos. A few burial sites have been excavated—including the Windover Archaeological Site in Brevard County near Titusville—that provide evidence of burial rituals. Archaic peoples interred their dead in shallow peat marshes, which preserved much of the human tissue. Further climate change between 5,000 and 3,000 years ago led to the Middle Archaic period; evidence suggests that human habitation near the St. Johns River first occurred during this era. Populations of indigenous people increased significantly at this time, and numerous settlements near the St. Johns have been recorded from this era; the banks of the St. Johns and its arteries are dotted with middens filled with thousands <b>of</b> <b>shells,</b> primarily those of Viviparus georgianus—a freshwater snail—and oysters.|$|E

5|$|Following overhaul, Texas resumed duty {{with the}} Atlantic Fleet early in 1919. On 10 March, {{she became the}} first American {{battleship}} to launch an airplane when Lieutenant Commander Edward O. McDonnell flew a British-built Sopwith Camel off the warship. Later in 1919 Texass captain, Nathan C. Twining, successfully employed naval aircraft to spot the fall <b>of</b> <b>shells</b> during a main battery exercise. The results were that aircraft-borne gunfire spotters were significantly more accurate than shipboard spotters. In testimony to the Navy General Board, Lieutenant Commander Kenneth Whiting attested that the increase in gunfire effectiveness with air spotting was likely to be as great as 200%. As a result of these first experiments, the Navy would add floatplanes to all of the fleet's battleships and newer cruisers. In May 1919, Texas served as a plane guard and navigational aid for the successful attempt by Navy Curtiss NC flying boat NC-4 to become the first airplane to cross the Atlantic. On 26 July 1919 Texas entered the Pacific Ocean as part of the newly formed Pacific Fleet and she would spend the next five and half years as a part of Pacific Fleet. On 17 July the following year, she was designated BB-35 under the Navy's newly adopted alpha-numeric system of hull classification symbols.|$|E
5|$|Jiyuan {{was hit by}} a {{multitude}} <b>of</b> <b>shells,</b> disabling her forward-mounted Krupp gun and severely damaging all the structures above her armour belt. Captain Fang gave orders to flee at full speed towards Waihaiwei, with Yoshino in pursuit. Reports differed on why Jiyuan was not overtaken by the faster Japanese cruiser, with one claim stating that Jiyuans aft mounted Krupp gun scored a hit on the bridge of the Yoshino, and another indicating that shot was fired by the Kuang Yi. While Jiyuan got away, the Kuang Yi fought against the remaining two cruisers until she was holed and sinking, at which point she was beached to allow her crew to escape. As the Tsi Yuan headed to Weihaiwei, she passed the Kowshing which was still heading to Korea. The troop ship was stopped by the Japanese, and after prolonged negotiations she was sunk with loss of a great number of the troops and crew on board.|$|E
5|$|With Attu Island secure, the Americans {{diverted}} {{their attention}} towards forcing the Japanese off Kiska. U.S. intelligence estimated {{at that point}} that the number of Japanese troops on Kiska was likely to be 10,000, so Kinkaid deployed 34,426 men, composed of both Americans and Canadians, to the Aleutians to work on recapturing Kiska. With the recapturing operation scheduled to begin on August 15, the Eleventh Air Force dropped 424 tons of bombs on Kiska during the month of July. In addition, the Navy fired 330 tons <b>of</b> <b>shells</b> onto the island during the same period. In late July, the pilots charged with scouting for enemy forces on Kiska reported a sharp decline in the amount of fire received by their planes from Japanese forces on the ground. The Americans believed that one of two events had occurred – either Kiska had been evacuated, or the Japanese had retreated into the hills of Kiska.|$|E
