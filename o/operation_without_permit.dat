5000|$|On July 24, 2009, Duvall filed {{a motion}} to dismiss the {{criminal}} charges against Shaffer and Vetter. According to Duvall, there {{has been more than}} one rock in the river known as [...] "Indian Head Rock" [...] or [...] "Indian Rock" [...] and there is confusion over which is the [...] "official" [...] one. In his 12-page motion, Duvall said he was dropping the case because he would not able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the 8-ton boulder that Shaffer and his associates pulled out of the river in September 2007 is, in fact, the same Indian Head Rock that was registered with the University of Kentucky as a protected archaeological object in the mid-1980s. [...] "The official Indian Head Rock cannot be in several places at once," [...] the motion states. According to Duvall, Shaffer would still face other consequences for his actions, including being cited by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for undertaking a dredging <b>operation</b> <b>without</b> a <b>permit.</b> Judge Conley granted the motion and dismissed the charges on July 30, 2009.|$|R
5000|$|Renewed {{threat was}} {{experienced}} in 2016. In 2014 the Department of Minerals (DMR) issued a permit for mining {{to take place}} on part of the declared site. The South African Heritage Resources Agency (SAHRA) was alerted and in response, because of the existing formal declaration, a Cease Works Order {{was put in place}} to prevent mining from taking place. Pressure was exerted however and in March 2016 the Cease Works Order was lifted, following which, on 16 March 2016, a diamond mining operation commenced work by fencing off an area around that for which they have a DMR mining permit. Public access to the remainder of the heritage site was blocked. Section 27(18) of the National Heritage Resources Act (NHRA) (Act 25 of 1999) states that: [...] "No person may destroy, damage, deface, excavate, alter, remove from its original position, subdivide or change the planning status of any heritage site <b>without</b> a <b>permit</b> issued by the heritage resources authority responsible for the protection of such site." [...] Section 51. (1) of the NHRA states that: [...] "Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, any person who contravenes— (a) sections 27(18), 29(10), 32(13) or 32(19) is guilty of an offence and liable to a fine or imprisonment or both such fine and imprisonment as set out in item 1 of the Schedule." [...] Since the mining concern has commenced mining <b>operations</b> <b>without</b> such a <b>permit</b> issued by SAHRA, it is clearly in contravention of an Act of the Republic of South Africa and therefore is guilty of an offence.|$|R
