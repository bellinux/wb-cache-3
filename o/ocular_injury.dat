50|$|TGFβ2 {{levels have}} been shown to be {{elevated}} up to three times normal during the progression of PVR. TGFβ2 is the most predominant isoform in the eye and is secreted as a latent inactive peptide into the vitreous by epithelial cells of the ciliary body and the lens epithelium and is also produced by the RPE cells and the Muller cells of the retina. TGFβ2 is known to induce EMT in RPE cells and fibrosis in the eye. Expression of PDGF in particular PDGF-AA is triggered during <b>ocular</b> <b>injury</b> and contributes to PVR pathology. RPE cells express the receptor for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). HGF stimulates RPE cell migration and its presence is also strongly detected in retinal membranes.

40|$|AIM: To {{study the}} {{clinical}} profile of <b>ocular</b> <b>injuries</b> in {{children in a}} tertiary care center in Northern India. METHODS: This was a hospital based descriptive study. All children of <b>ocular</b> <b>injuries</b> up to 16 y of age were included. Data regarding the socio-economic status, medical/surgical treatment, and condition at discharge were recorded. Follow-up to 3 mo {{was done in the}} study. Initial and final visual acuity was recorded. Ocular Trauma Classification Group guidelines and Birmingham Eye Trauma Terminology were used for the definitions and classifications of ocular trauma. Socio-economic status grading is done according to modified B. G. Prasad classification and Kuppuswamy's socio-economic scale. RESULTS: Out of 42 children, male to female ratio was 3. 6 : 1. Maximum number(50 %) of injuries occurred between 11 - 16 y of age. Most of the children(59. 52 %) belonged to lower socio-economic class and were from arural background. <b>Ocular</b> <b>injuries</b> occurred at home in 20 (47. 61 %) children followed by 6 (14. 28 %) each in school, playground, and street. Open globe injuries were seen in 19 (45. 24 %) children and 23 (54. 75 %) children had closed globe injuries. Injuries by wooden stick, stone, firework, fall, toy were 12 (28. 57 %), 5 (11. 90 %), 3 (7. 14 %), 3 (7. 14 %), and 2 (4. 76 %). Seventeen(40. 47 %) children required medical management and 25 (59. 53 %) were treated surgically. CONCLUSION:Male children in rural regions and of lower socio-economic background were more prone to <b>ocular</b> <b>injuries.</b> Children were more risk of <b>ocular</b> <b>injuries</b> at home.

50|$|Depending on {{the type}} of <b>ocular</b> <b>injury,</b> either a {{pressure}} patch or shield patch should be applied. Up until circa 1987, pressure patches were the preferred method of treatment for corneal abrasions in non-contact lens wearers; Multiple controlled studies conducted by accredited organizations such as the American Academy of Ophthalmology have shown that pressure patching is of little or no value in healing corneal abrasions and is actually detrimental to healing in some cases. A Cochrane Review found that patching simple corneal abrasions may not improve healing or reduce pain. Pressure patching should never be used on an individual presenting with a corneal abrasion who has a history of contact lens wear. In this circumstance, a virulent infection caused by the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa is at a clearly delineated increased risk for occurrence. These infections can cause blindness within 24 - 48 hours and {{there is a possibility that}} the infection can move into the peri-orbital socket, resulting in the need for evisceration of the eyeball. In rare cases, the infection can enter the brain and cause death to the patient.|$|E
50|$|Microdermabrasion {{crystals}} {{are typically}} {{made of a}} very fine, abrasive material like aluminum oxide. Other inert microderm crystals include magnesium oxide, sodium chloride, and sodium bicarbonate. All ultra-fine white crystals are disposable and should be discarded after each use. The microdermabrasion vacuum removes the crystals and exfoliated skin cells. Inhalation of crystals should be avoided and masks are sometimes worn by the operator doing the treatment. <b>Ocular</b> <b>injury</b> may occur if crystals are inadvertently sprayed in the eye or if crystals remain around the eye and cause a corneal abrasion. There are some possible concerns of inhalation exposure and basic safety precautions should be taken. Patient goggles or eye shields, as well as operator face masks are recommended when treating with crystal based systems. Alternatively, microderm crystals can be safely replaced by the roughened surface of a diamond tip microdermabrasion system.The newer diamond based systems like Vacubrasion utilize a fine diamond dust that is essentially electroplated onto a stainless steel round tip that comes {{in contact with the}} skin.|$|E

Methods The epidemiological literature concerning military <b>ocular</b> <b>injury</b> occurring in our country and abroad in recent five years was retrieved by information research;the problems and experiences in the aspects of epidemiological survey,registry,data collection,systematic treatment and prevention of military <b>ocular</b> <b>injury</b> existed in PLA were also summarized and analyzed. Results There were currently no systematic epidemiological data about <b>ocular</b> <b>injury</b> in PLA. A few articles about epidemiological study on <b>ocular</b> <b>injury</b> showed that servicemen were the high risk population of <b>ocular</b> <b>injury.</b> Both in peacetime or wartime the <b>ocular</b> <b>injury</b> was the primary cause leading to monocular blindness of soldiers. As to the ocular injury,in 51. 55 % of the patients,it occurred in the military operations and work,and 30. 31 % in military training. The incidence of <b>ocular</b> <b>injury</b> was different in various services,for example,the incidence in the internal security forces of armed police could be as high as 78. 85 % due to training of martial arts and boxing and wrestling. The deficiency of microsurgery equipments and untimely evacuation were the main causes affecting prognosis during treatment course in primary military hospitals. Conclusions Military affairs,physical training,military maneuver and defense constructions are the main causes of <b>ocular</b> <b>injury</b> in servicemen,and young male soldiers are the main group for prevention and treatment for military <b>ocular</b> <b>injury.</b> More attention should be paid to the epidemiological survey of military <b>ocular</b> <b>injury</b> to find out the causes leading to ocular injury,to improve treatment strategies,to formulate feasible protective measures and then military <b>ocular</b> <b>injury</b> can be effectively prevented...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: This {{investigation}} retrospectively examined <b>ocular</b> <b>injuries</b> {{associated with}} air bag deployment {{to gain a}} better appreciation of potential risk factors in motor vehicle accidents. National statistics regarding the efficacy of air bags were reviewed. METHODS: Review of the literature from 1991 to 1998 identified 44 articles describing 97 patients with air-bag-induced <b>ocular</b> <b>injuries.</b> Variables extracted from each case were age, sex, height, position in the car, eye wear, vehicle impact speed, visual acuity, and specific <b>ocular</b> <b>injuries.</b> RESULTS: Corneal abrasions occurred in 49 % of occupants, hyphemas in 43 %, vitreous or retinal hemorrhages in 25 %, and retinal tears or detachments in 15 %. The globe was ruptured in 10 patients. Patients involved in higher-speed accidents (over 30 mph) sustained a greater percentage of vitreous or retinal hemorrhages and traumatic cataracts, while those at slower speeds were more prone to retinal tears or detachments. In a subset of 14 patients with serious <b>ocular</b> <b>injuries,</b> the impact speed of 11 patients was recorded at 30 mph or less. Slower speed may be a risk factor for some <b>ocular</b> <b>injuries.</b> Occupant height was not a significant factor. National statistics confirm that air bags reduce fatalities in motor vehicle accidents. However, children sitting in the front seat without a seat belt and infants in passenger-side rear-facing car seats are at risk for fatal injury. CONCLUSION: Air bags combined with seat belts are an effective means of reducing injury and death in adults during motor vehicle accidents. However, this study has documented a wide variety of <b>ocular</b> <b>injuries</b> associated with air bag deployment. It is hoped that researchers can develop modifications that continue to save lives while minimizing additional harm...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Ocular</b> <b>injuries</b> {{are common}} in {{survivors}} of terror incidents that involve the use of explosive materials. These explosives are commonly of a High Explosive type (HE) and may be fashioned into improvised explosive devices (IED) that incorporate additional materials to maximise trauma and injuries. Serial IED explosions have occurred in commuter trains in several cities including London and Madrid but data on <b>ocular</b> <b>injuries</b> is limited. We report the <b>ocular</b> <b>injuries</b> of the survivors {{of a series of}} IED explosions in crowded commuter trains. Methods 28 patients (56 eyes, 28 male, ages ranging from 22 to 52 years (mean 35. 27 years) were screened in the triage area or the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Testing included bedside visual acuity testing, torchlight examination of the anterior segment and dilated (or if necessary, undilated) fundus examination. Selected patients underwent B-scan examination, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, orbits and the optic nerves or visual evoked potential assessment. The injuries, investigations and procedures were entered into the patient's case sheet as well as into a standardised format suggested by the Indian eye injury registry (IER). Results 16 of 28 patients (57. 1 %) had <b>ocular</b> <b>injuries</b> whereas 12 (42. 8 %) were found to be normal. Injuries were seen unilaterally in 10 patients and bilaterally in six yielding a total of 22 injured eyes. The common injuries were periorbital haemorrhages (09 eyes, 40 %); first or second degree burns to the upper or lower lids (seen in 07 eyes, 31. 8 %) and corneal injuries (seen in 08 eyes, 36. 3 %). Open globe injuries were seen in two eyes of two patients (09 %). One patient (4. 5 %) had a traumatic optic neuropathy.
