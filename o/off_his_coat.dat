25|$|Priscilla Tirado was {{too weak}} to grab the line when the {{helicopter}} returned to her. A watching bystander, Congressional Budget Office assistant Lenny Skutnik, stripped <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>coat</b> and boots, and in short sleeves, dove into the icy water and swam out to successfully pull her to shore. The helicopter then proceeded to where Felch had fallen, and paramedic Gene Windsor stepped out onto the helicopter skid and grabbed her by the clothing to lift her onto the skid with him, bringing her to shore. When the helicopter crew returned for Williams, the wreckage he was strapped into had rolled slightly, submerging him—according to the coroner, Williams was the only passenger to die by drowning. His body and those of the other occupants were later recovered.|$|E
500|$|While in high school, Ward {{had decided}} to attend Dartmouth College. [...] With Kipke's {{assurance}} {{that he would be}} given full opportunity to play football, Ward enrolled at Michigan. [...] Kipke had played with African-American athletes in high school and was eager to have Ward on his team. [...] According to John Behee, {{the author of a book}} on the history of African-American athletes at Michigan, Kipke “threatened to fight, physically fight, those alumni and fellow coaches who opposed his playing Ward.” [...] Behee wrote that [...] "on several occasions Kipke took <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>coat</b> and was prepared to fight with those who bitterly opposed having a Negro play for Michigan." ...|$|E
500|$|Believing the {{military}} forces to be neutralised, Goldfinger's private army breaks into Fort Knox and accesses the vault itself as Goldfinger arrives {{in a helicopter}} with the atomic device. In the vault, his henchman Kisch handcuffs Bond to the bomb. The troops attack; Goldfinger takes <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>coat,</b> revealing a US Army colonel's uniform, and kills Mr. Ling and the troops seeking to open the vault, then makes his escape. Kisch attempts to stop the bomb, but Oddjob kills him. Bond frees himself from the handcuffs, but Oddjob attacks him before he can disarm the bomb. Bond manages to electrocute Oddjob, then forces the lock off the bomb using gold bars from the vault, but is unable to disarm it. An atomic specialist who accompanied Leiter arrives with seconds to spare, and simply turns off the device with the timer stopped on [...] "0:07".|$|E

500|$|During {{the course}} of filming, a {{decision}} was made {{to take advantage of a}} massive flooding of the San Joaquin River in central California in order to obtain some spectacular footage for the film. The female collie was still in training and refused to enter the raging waters created by the flood. Weatherwax was on the site with Pal and offered to have his dog perform in a five-stage shot in which Pal would swim the river, haul himself out, lie down without shaking the water <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>coat,</b> attempt to crawl while lying on his side and finally lie motionless, completely exhausted. Pal performed exceptionally well and the scene was completed in one take. Weatherwax said [...] director Fred M. Wilcox was so impressed with Pal during the sequence that he had [...] "tears in his eyes." [...] In response, producers released the female collie and hired Pal in her stead, reshooting the first six weeks of the filming with Pal now portraying Lassie. Other sources say that the female collie was replaced because she began to shed excessively during shooting of the film in the summer, resulting in Weatherwax substituting the male collie, Pal, in the role of [...] "Lassie". In any case, MGM executives were so impressed, they upgraded the production to an A film with full advertising support, top publicity and filming in Technicolor. Pal went through his paces with enthusiasm, rarely required multiple retakes, and did his own stunt work.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1920s, Blanding {{also served as}} the {{president}} of the Lansing Senators, a baseball team that played in the Central League in 1921 and 1922. In May 1921, The Sporting News reported that Blanding [...] "has announced on various and sundry occasions he intends leaving his auto sales-rooms and going out to the lot, where he is going to take <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>coat</b> and put the young pitchers of the Lansing team through a course of sprouts." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1988, Ali and Frazier joined Foreman, Larry Holmes, and Ken Norton in Las Vegas for {{the making}} of the film Champions Forever. At a local gym, Frazier came across Ali before a crowd of spectators, and said: [...] "Look at Ali. Look what's {{happened}} to him. All your talkin', man. I'm faster than you are now. You're damaged goods." [...] Ali, already afflicted with Parkinson's, insisted that he remained faster than Frazier and pointing to a heavy bag suggested a contest of who can hit the bag the fastest. Frazier immediately took <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>coat,</b> and moving to the bag, threw a dozen rapid punches at it accompanied by loud grunts. Without removing his coat, Ali strolled towards the bag, held the ready stance, mimicked a Frazier grunt without throwing a punch, and then addressed Frazier with the words [...] "Wanna see it again, Joe?" [...] Everyone laughed, except Frazier.|$|E

2500|$|In 1904, the London Daily Mirror {{newspaper}} challenged Houdini {{to escape}} from special handcuffs that it claimed had taken Nathaniel Hart, a locksmith from Birmingham, five years to make. Houdini accepted the challenge for March 17 during a matinée performance at London's Hippodrome theater. It was reported that 4000 people and more than 100 journalists turned out for the much-hyped event. The escape attempt dragged on for over an hour, during which Houdini emerged from his [...] "ghost house" [...] (a small screen used to conceal the method of his escape) several times. On one occasion he asked if the cuffs could be removed so he could take <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>coat.</b> The Mirror representative, Frank Parker, refused, saying Houdini could gain an advantage if he saw how the cuffs were unlocked. Houdini promptly took out a pen-knife and, holding the knife in his teeth, used it to cut his coat from his body. Some 56minutes later, Houdini's wife appeared on stage {{and gave him a}} kiss. Many thought that in her mouth was the key to unlock the special handcuffs. However, it has since been suggested that Bess did not in fact enter the stage at all, and that this theory is unlikely due {{to the size of the}} 6-inch key Houdini then went back behind the curtain. After an hour and ten minutes, Houdini emerged free. As he was paraded on the shoulders of the cheering crowd, he broke down and wept. Houdini later said it was the most difficult escape of his career.|$|E
