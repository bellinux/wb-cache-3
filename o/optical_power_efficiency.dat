40|$|Abstract—We {{discuss the}} use of {{orthogonal}} frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) for combating group-velocity dispersion (GVD) effects in amplified direct-detection (DD) systems using single-mode fiber. We review known OFDM techniques, in-cluding asymmetrically clipped optical OFDM (ACO-OFDM), DC-clipped OFDM (DC-OFDM) and single-sideband OFDM (SSB-OFDM), and derive a linearized channel model for each technique. We present an iterative procedure to achieve optimum power allocation for each OFDM technique, {{since there is no}} closed-form solution for amplified DD systems. For each tech-nique, we minimize the optical power required to transmit at a given bit rate and normalized GVD by iteratively adjusting the bias and optimizing the power allocation among the subcarriers. We verify that SSB-OFDM has the best <b>optical</b> <b>power</b> <b>efficiency</b> among the different OFDM techniques. We compare these OFDM techniques to on-off keying (OOK) with maximum-likelihood se-quence detection (MLSD) and show that SSB-OFDM can achieve the same <b>optical</b> <b>power</b> <b>efficiency</b> as OOK with MLSD, but at the cost of requiring twice the electrical bandwidth and also a complex quadrature modulator. We compare the computational complexity of the different techniques and show that SSB-OFDM requires fewer operations per bit than OOK with MLSD.

The characterization consists in investigations of transient electrical {{processes in the}} diode sources under heating by direct current. The time dependence of the heating temperature of the active region of a source ∆T(t), calculated from direct bias change, is analyzed using a thermal RTCT equivalent circuit (the Foster and Cauer models), where RT is the {{thermal resistance}} and CT is the heat capacity of the source elements and external heat sink.

Five constellation combinations denoted by A to E, which {{are listed in}} Table 2, are applied to odd subcarriers (ACO-OFDM) and even subcarriers (DCO- or SCO-OFDM) of two schemes. ADO-OFDM is represented by squares, and ASCO-OFDM is represented by stars. Star F represents ASCO-OFDM with 64 -QAM symbols on all subcarriers. If two systems are modulated by the same constellation combination, the bit rate/normalized bandwidth of ASCO-OFDM is {{less than that of}} ADO-OFDM. However, ASCO-OFDM requires much less optical power for each bit than ADO-OFDM does due to no DC bias added in the SCO-OFDM modulation. Although the bit rate/normalized bandwidth of ASCO-OFDM is lower, we can use larger constellation combinations to achieve the same bit rate with that of ADO-OFDM. When the same bit rate/normalized bandwidth is achieved, for example square B vs. star D and squares C and D vs. star E, the ASCO-OFDM exhibits more <b>optical</b> <b>power</b> <b>efficiency</b> than ADO-OFDM does. Therefore, ASCO-OFDM is more optical power efficient compared to ADO-OFDM. Moreover, if the required optical power per bit of ASCO-OFDM is close to that of ADO-OFDM, the bit rate/normalized bandwidth of ASCO-OFDM improves, which is shown as squares B and C vs. star F.|$|E

3000|$|This paper {{shows that}} SSFO and motion blur can impair the BER {{performance}} of spatial OFDM based communication systems. The individual presence of SSFO and the simultaneous presence of defocus and motion blur modelled together as APSF cause attenuation and phase distortion in the spatial-frequency domain. However, {{the effect of}} SSFO can be decreased by ensuring {{that the number of}} received pixels is much larger than the transmitted pixels. Moreover, the use of an equalizer and the use of only the lower subcarriers can further minimize the effect of SSFO. The effect of APSF is different from that of SPSF since SPSF does not cause phase distortion. Depending on the magnitude of motion blur, APSF can create significant BER degradations even when the higher subcarriers are unused for data transmission. Therefore, the relative motion between the transmitter and the receiver must be kept to minimum to ensure reliable data transmission. Next, it is shown that the performance of SACO-OFDM in the joint presence of SSFO and APSF can be improved by forming NCS-OFDM by exploiting the anti-symmetry property of SACO-OFDM. Simulation results show that for a given data rate and for the combined perturbations of vignetting, fractional misalignment, SSFO and APSF, NCS-OFDM shows slightly better <b>optical</b> <b>power</b> <b>efficiency</b> than SACO-OFDM and SDCO-OFDM.

This oxonitridosilicate phosphor features strong 4 f 65 d 1 - 4 f 7 luminescence originating from the Eu 2 + ion, with a narrow emission band peaking at 467 nm and a full width at half maximum of only 41 nm. Thermal quenching of the blue luminescence only sets in above 450 K, making this material an interesting candidate as LED conversion phosphor. The fast decay of the luminescence prevents the phosphor to be susceptible to saturation effects at high excitation fluxes. Furthermore it is proven to be chemically stable against moisture. The only drawback is the relatively low quantum efficiency of the synthesized powder, provisionally preventing this material {{to be used in}} applications. In addition, the phosphor features a weak yellow emission band, originating from small domains featuring a different crystal structure.

40|$|The {{semiconductor}} industry growth is driven {{to a large}} extent by steady advancements in microlithography. According to the newly updated industry roadmap, the 70 nm generation is anticipated to be available in the year 2008. However, the path to get there is not obvious. The problem of construction of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) quantum laser for lithography is still unsolved: progress in this field is rather moderate and we can not expect a significant breakthrough in the near future. Nevertheless, there is clear path for optical lithography to take us to sub- 100 nm dimensions. Theoretical and experimental work in self-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE) free electron lasers (FEL) physics, and the physics of superconducting linear accelerators over the last ten years has pointed to possibility of the generation high-power optical beams with laser-like characteristics in the EUV spectral range. Recently there have been important advance in demonstrating a high-gain SASA FEL at 100 nm wavelength [1]. The SASE FEL concept eliminates the need for an optical cavity. As a result, there are no apparent limitations which would prevent operation at very short wavelength range and to increase the average output power of this device up to 10 -kW level.

40|$|In {{the last}} decades the fields of {{photonics}} and nanotechnology have led to some impressive scientific and technological achievements. Among them, the exploration of yet unexploited spectral regions, such as the Terahertz (THz) range, i. e. wavelengths of 60 micron- 300 micron, {{has been a major}} breakthrough. On the one hand, this was possible after the novel theoretical concept of light amplification in multiple quantum wells and superlattices was proposed in the Seventies, introducing the groundbreaking quantum cascade laser (QCL) idea. On the other hand, the development of new nanofabrication technologies and crystal growth techniques, such as the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), allowed an unprecedented control over the material structure, down to the deposition of nanometer-thick semiconductor layers. This paved the way to the practical realization of electrically pumped multi-stage gain media, the QCL, and to the successful demonstrations of their operation in a broad frequency range, from the mid-IR to the far-infrared. Apart from the purely scientific interest, Terahertz photonics has now a fundamental role in many applications, like metrology, spectroscopy, biomedical and pharmaceutical imaging, quality and process control, communications and security. Nowadays, a lot of effort is made to improve the performance of Terahertz QCL in terms of <b>optical</b> <b>power,</b> <b>efficiency,</b> beam pattern, frequency control and thermal management. Some of these crucial issues can be addressed by the use of photonic structures, i. e. specially designed patterns of dielectric scatterers superimposed to the active region. Such structures can be implemented in one- (1 D), two (2 D) - or three (3 D) -dimensional architectures, to provide a tight control of the frequencies and far-field emission pattern of the laser. Periodic photonic crystals have been studied for long time, providing intriguing insights. More recently, aperiodic patterns have attracted increasing attention due to their greater flexibility and the possibility to study and explore novel physical phenomena. The aim of the present thesis is to design, fabricate and investigate the transport and optical behavior of THz QCLs exploiting distributed feedback, achieved through the use of 2 D quasi-periodic and random resonators. The main goal is to demonstrate multimode emission over a broad frequency bandwidth, centered around 3. 1 THz. Unlike perfect photonic crystals, quasi-crystal geometries do not possess discrete translational invariance, yet they do possess long-range order which gives rise to a rich spectrum. After developing a simulation code based on the generation algorithm called "Generalized Dual Method", we designed the following quasi-crystal geometries: i) a 7 -fold pattern with a perfect symmetry under 2 π/ 7 rotations around a central axis, ii) an imperfect 7 -fold geometry where small defect points are introduced. This allowed to compare the effects of introducing a small amount of disorder {{in the design of the}} photonic structures. In order to understand the effect of a further increase of disorder, a third type of random structures was also studied, whose scatterers positions were extracted from a uniform pseudo-random distribution. We then simulated these photonic structures using the numerical approach of finite elements analysis, to understand how light propagation is affected by the size, the number and the arrangement of the scatterrers. A set of devices for each geometry was selected among those with the largest number of electromagnetic modes with predicted high quality factors Q. They were then nano-fabricated with the same QCL active region in a cleanroom facility, using a combination of UV optical lithography, plasma-assisted etching, metal deposition, chemical processes and ultrasonic wedge bonding. Finally, all lasers were characterized electrically and optically to study how the different physical and geometrical parameters affect the lasing threshold, the slope efficiency, the emitted power and the far-field intensity profile. The emission spectra were probed via Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), demonstrating the predicted multimode emission in most devices. In a future perspective, such multimode emission could be used to mode-lock radiation in a THz QCL, for example using passive optical components. An interesting possibility is the future integration of graphene in QCL to exploit its saturable absorption in the THz region. To this end, the transmission of THz radiation through a few layers of graphene transferred on an intrinsic silicon substrate was measured, reporting saturable absorption in the THz...|$|E

We here exploit electrically pumped terahertz quantum cascade heterostructures to devise two-dimensional seven-fold quasi-crystal resonators, exploiting rotational order or irregularly distributed defects.

In {{conventional}} InGaN/GaN light-emitting diodes (LEDs), thin InGaN quantum wells are usually adopted {{to mitigate the}} quantum confined Stark effect (QCSE), caused due to strong polarization induced electric field, through spatially confining electrons and holes in small recombination volumes. However, this inevitably increases the carrier density in quantum wells, which in turn aggravates the Auger recombination, since the Auger recombination scales with the third power of the carrier density. As a result, the efficiency droop of the Auger recombination severely limits the LED performance.

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. InGaN/GaN {{light-emitting}} diodes (LEDs) make an important class of optoelectronic devices, increasingly used in lighting and displays. Conventional InGaN/GaN LEDs of c-orientation exhibit strong internal polarization fields and suffer from significantly reduced radiative recombination rates. A reduced polarization within the device {{can improve the}} optical matrix element, thereby enhancing the <b>optical</b> output <b>power</b> and <b>efficiency.</b> Here, we have demonstrated computationally that the step-doping in the quantum barriers is effective in reducing the polarization-induced fields and lowering the energy barrier for hole transport. Also, we have proven experimentally that such InGaN/GaN LEDs with Si step-doped quantum barriers indeed outperform LEDs with wholly Si-doped barriers and those without doped barriers in terms of output power and external quantum efficiency. The consistency of our numerical simulation and experimental results indicate the effects of Si step-doping in suppressing quantum-confined stark effect and enhancing the hole injection, and is promising in improving the InGaN/GaN LED performance...|$|R
40|$|In {{conventional}} InGaN/GaN {{light-emitting diodes}} (LEDs), thin InGaN quantum wells are usually adopted {{to mitigate the}} quantum confined Stark effect (QCSE), caused due to strong polarization induced electric field, through spatially confining electrons and holes in small recombination volumes. However, this inevitably increases the carrier density in quantum wells, which in turn aggravates the Auger recombination, since the Auger recombination scales with the third power of the carrier density. As a result, the efficiency droop of the Auger recombination severely limits the LED performance. Here, we proposed and showed wide InGaN quantum wells with the InN composition linearly grading along the growth orientation in LED structures suppressing the Auger recombination and the QCSE simultaneously. Theoretically, the physical mechanisms behind the Auger recombination suppression are also revealed.

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the {{integration}} potential and explore the design space of low power thermal reliable on-chip interconnect synthesis featuring nanophotonics Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM). With the recent advancements, it is foreseen that nanophotonics holds the promise to be employed for future on-chip data signalling due to its unique <b>power</b> <b>efficiency,</b> signal delay and huge multiplexing potential. However, there are major challenges to address before feasible on-chip integration could be reached. In this paper, we present GLOW, a hybrid global router to provide low power opto-electronic interconnect synthesis under the considerations of thermal reliability and various physical design constraints such as <b>optical</b> <b>power,</b> delay and signal quality. GLOW is evaluated with testing cases derived from ISPD 07 - 08 global routing benchmarks. Compared with a greedy approach, GLOW demonstrates around 23 %- 50 % of total <b>optical</b> <b>power</b> reduction, revealing great potential of on-chip WDM interconnect synthesis...|$|R
