25|$|Following the {{accident}} the Canadian TSB issued several recommendations, {{one of which}} was a recommendation to the FAA regarding the crew training and flight manual, and another being a recommendation to install an <b>overheat</b> <b>warning</b> system inside the wheel-wells of every Metroliner; before {{the accident}} warning systems were not required on such aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Approximately 30 {{seconds after}} Flight 420's request to return, control {{problems}} started to occur. The aircraft became harder {{to control and}} a warning indicator showed that an engine problem was developing. 40 seconds later, the wing <b>overheat</b> <b>warning</b> system was illuminated. Before the crew had conducted the checklist for handling such an emergency, the warning light went off. 5 minutes later the left engine appeared to be on fire. The crew later shut down the engine.|$|E
2500|$|A brake <b>overheat</b> <b>warning</b> {{system should}} have warned the crew. However, [...] a brake <b>overheat</b> <b>warning</b> system was not {{required}} {{on the type of}} the aircraft, so the crew of Flight 420 did not know that a fire had developed. Since hydraulic lines were located near the wheel wells, the fire ruptured the aircraft's hydraulic line, which caused the fire to intensify.|$|E
2500|$|Teething {{problems}} in service {{have so far}} included three areas: The onboard Maintenance, Repair, Overhaul (MRO) network needed software improvements; Airbus issued service bulletins regarding onboard equipment and removed galley inserts (coffee makers, toaster ovens) because of leaks; and has had to address spurious <b>overheating</b> <b>warnings</b> in the bleed air system by retrofitting an original connector with a gold-plated connector. [...] Airbus targets a 98.5% dependability {{by the end of}} 2016 and to match the mature A330 reliability by early 2019.|$|R
50|$|Standard {{features}} include analog speedometer and tachometer and an LCD multi-function gauge that includes fuel and oil gauge, hour meter, low fuel, oil, voltage and <b>overheat</b> <b>warnings,</b> compass, trip meter and clock, {{air and water}} temperature, average and peak speed and various maintenance information. The gauges are recessed in the hood, {{in front of the}} handlebars. The craft also features dual mirrors and a true tow rope hook. Like all of Sea-Doo's models, the GTX features Sea-Doo's Digital Electronic Security System, which uses a lanyard fitted with a computer chip encoded with a specific code for your boat.|$|R
5|$|Sid {{finds the}} eighth spirit at the crater {{site of the}} alien asteroid's impact on Earth. He lowers a {{shielded}} vehicle, with Aki and Gray aboard, into the crater to locate the final spirit. Just before they can reach it, Hein fires the Zeus cannon into the crater, not only destroying the eighth spirit but also revealing the Phantom Gaia. Aki has {{a vision of the}} Phantom home planet, where she is able to receive the eighth spirit from the alien particles in herself. When Aki awakens, she and Gray combine it with the other seven. Hein continues to fire the Zeus cannon despite <b>overheating</b> <b>warnings</b> and unintentionally destroys the cannon and himself. Gray sacrifices himself as a medium needed to physically transmit the completed spirit into the alien Gaia. The Earth's Gaia is returned to normal as the Phantoms ascend into space, finally at peace. Aki is pulled from the crater holding Gray's body, and is seen looking into the newly liberated world.|$|R

40|$|This {{specification}} {{establishes the}} requirements for performance, design, test, and qualification of the SMS total power and grounding system. This is defined as designing a new PDU to be useable for SMS adding FBCS and modifying and adding to the OAS power systems, the emergency off system and the <b>overheat</b> <b>warning</b> system. The above design considers all S. O. W. requirements...|$|E
5000|$|... 1984 {{would prove}} to be a {{frustrating}} year for Moffat. After finishing 3rd in the opening round of the ATCC at Sandown behind winner Brock and second placed Dick Johnson (Johnson had taken Moffat's 1970's mantle of being the leading Ford driver in the country), he claimed pole in his RX-7 (fitted with the 13B rotary engine instead of the 12A of 1983) at Symmons Plains. However, due to the cold conditions the team put a cover over {{the front of the car}} to help warm up the engine. Unfortunately the fuse for the <b>overheating</b> <b>warning</b> light had blown and Moffat's race only lasted until the hairpin on lap one before his rotary engine expired, handing an easy win to Brock. He then won at Wannerroo in Perth, before crashing out of the championship at Surfers Paradise when his Mazda was hit while lapping the XD Falcon of Gary Willmington at high speed going under the Dunlop Bridge at the end of the main straight. Due to the wet conditions the Mazda slid off the road at high speed, took out an ABC television camera cable and slammed head on into a bush that was hiding a tree stump. In what was his biggest crash since rolling his XA Falcon at Phillip Island in 1973, Moffat suffered a fractured sternum and broken finger in the accident, while the RX-7 was a write off.|$|R
