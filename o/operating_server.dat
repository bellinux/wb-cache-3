The authors treat the queueing process with continuous time parameter as a semi-regenerative process and obtain its stationary probability distribution. The authors also study the {{input and output}} processes and establish ergodic theorems for some functionals of these processes. The results obtained in the article are illustrated by various examples.

40|$|Hospital as {{a health}} {{institution}} {{must be able to}} give good services for its stakeholders, especially patients. However, patients often have to wait {{for quite a long time}} in queues before service. A study case in an internal medicine polyclinic in a large scale hospital in Yogyakartashowed that for around 60 patients in a day, they have to stay in queues for more than one hour averagely. This observation occurred when appointment scheduling was used, i. e. patient must make an appointment for the service time. This research evaluated some scenarios that can reduce the waiting time in this system. Results showed that patient 2 ̆ 7 s arrival was recommended to be schedulled every 15 minutes with adjustment on the number of <b>operating</b> <b>server.</b> This recommendation can reduce patient 2 ̆ 7 s waiting time by 28 - 50...|$|E
40|$|Long queuing is not {{expected}} by anyone, because it’s taking much time and tiresome. However, this situation is not avoidable in public area, for example Ahmad Yani International Airport Semarang. Aircraft queuing that will take off and landed resulted in increasing of the queuing of passengers to aboard. The suitable queuing system model for Ahmad Yani Internasional Airport Semarang to solve its air traffic is using (M/M/ 6) :(GD/∞/∞), with six aprons as server of reguler commercial flight. Moreover, based on the result of system performance measure, service system in Ahmad Yani Internasional Airport Semarang report is good enough. The result of system performance measure said that average number of aircraft in the system (Ls) was 1, 0716 aircraft per hour, average number of aircraft in the queue (Lq) was 0, 0002 aircraft per hour, average time aircraft spends in the system (Ws) was 0, 4977 from an hour, and average time aircraft spends in the queue (Wq) was 0, 0001 from an hour. The simulation showed that by using four <b>operating</b> <b>server</b> or adding two more arrival additionals in every hour, the service system is quite effective.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the group replacement problems for a service system with multiple independent <b>operating</b> <b>servers</b> {{and a single}} Markovian queue. The servers are unreliable with identically exponentially distributed failure times and the repair time is assumed negligible. This proposed model is formulated as a continuous time Markov decision process. Two classes of group replacement policies are developed where the decision to trigger the repair processes dynamically depends {{on the number of}} customers and the number of <b>operating</b> <b>servers</b> in the system. For the theoretical analysis, it is proved that the optimal group replacement policies have a threshold structure following several significant mathematical properties. Finally two numerical examples are given to illustrate the main theoretical results, and also present two classes of optimal replacement policies for finding the related threshold of number of customers and the number of <b>operating</b> <b>servers</b> to trigger the group replacement.

40|$|Recently, a {{distribution}} management system (DMS) that can conduct periodical system analysis and control by mounting various applications programs has been actively developed. In this paper, we summarize {{the development and}} demonstration of a database structure that can perform real-time system analysis {{and control of the}} Korean smart distribution management system (KSDMS). The developed database structure consists of a common information model (CIM) -based off-line database (DB), a physical DB (PDB) for DB establishment of the <b>operating</b> <b>server,</b> a real-time DB (RTDB) for real-time server operation and remote terminal unit data interconnection, and an application common model (ACM) DB for running application programs. The ACM DB for real-time system analysis and control of the application programs was developed by using a parallel table structure and a link list model, thereby providing fast input and output as well as high execution speed of application programs. Furthermore, the ACM DB was configured with hierarchical and non-hierarchical data models to reflect the system models that increase the DB size and operation speed through the reduction of the system, of which elements were unnecessary for analysis and control. The proposed database model was implemented and tested at the Gochaing and Jeju offices using a real system. Through data measurement of the remote terminal units, and through the operation and control of the application programs using the measurement, the performance, speed, and integrity of the proposed database model were validated, thereby demonstrating that this model can be applied to real systems...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{describes}} the mechanism for data synchronisation between different relational data servers {{of a business}} operating system {{on one side and}} different relational data servers of a web store on the other. In other words, this denotes the synchronisation between any business operating system with any web store. In addition, a very similar concept could be introduced for synchronisation of other information systems. However, the synchronisation between a business <b>operating</b> <b>server</b> and a web store must have a wider scope than the mere data exchange {{at the level of the}} relational database. Nevertheless, the thesis will mainly deal with this level and certain support mechanisms in the Delphi environment, and briefly mention other mechanisms necessary for the synchronisation as a whole. In terms of content, the thesis first presents the global functioning concept, which is explained in more detail later on and used as a concrete example. As for the functional aspect, the thesis focuses on the synchronisation of stock, prices and orders, which are the core of the synchronisation between the business operating system and the web store. On a related note, the same or similar logic may be applied to other functions and areas of synchronisation. The main idea for this type of synchronisation was based on practical experience and actual needs expressed by different business entities who have been using the Pantheon software. The idea was further explored in this thesis and it is our hope that it will become fully implemented sometime in the future. ...|$|E
