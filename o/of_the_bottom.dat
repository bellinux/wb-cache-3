5|$|From the 1986–87 season, {{the club}} {{finishing}} {{bottom of the}} Football League's basement division was relegated to the Conference National (now National League), {{the highest level of}} non-League football, depending on the ability of the Conference champions to meet FA requirements. Before this, clubs would lose their League status by failing to gain re-election after finishing in the bottom four <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> division. Since the 2002–03 season, the bottom two clubs of League Two face relegation to the Conference/National League.|$|E

5|$|Hayes {{kept his}} {{pledge not to}} run for re-election, retired {{to his home in}} Ohio, and became an {{advocate}} of social and educational reform. Biographer Ari Hoogenboom said his greatest achievement was to restore popular faith in the presidency and to reverse the deterioration of executive power that had set in after Abraham Lincoln's death. Although supporters have praised his commitment to civil service reform and defense of civil rights, Hayes is generally listed among the high-end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> half in historians' rankings of U.S. presidents.|$|E
5|$|Professor Layton and the Last Specter also {{features}} several small minigames that are playable {{in the main}} game, available by selecting them from the Professor's Suitcase located in the top-right corner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> screen while moving about the town. In order to play these minigames, the plot must have progressed far enough to have unlocked each of them, and more difficult levels require the completion of puzzles in the main game.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bottoms</b> Gang never {{recovered}} from <b>the</b> convictions <b>of</b> 1909. They degenerated into lowly street thugs {{with little or}} no political backing who were no match for the criminal superpower that was Egan's Rats. Older members, like Tony Foley and Bev Brown, retired from street rackets and went into the saloon business. A splinter group <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bottoms</b> Gang became known as the [...] "Nixie Fighters" [...] because of their penchant for fighting police officers. The two main leaders of this group, Edward Devine and Charles von der Ahe, were murdered by Egan gunmen in <b>the</b> fall <b>of</b> 1911. <b>The</b> remaining members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bottoms</b> Gang were either locked up, killed, or cast their lots with other criminal organizations.|$|R

5|$|The plain maskray {{generally}} hunts at {{the surface}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> substrate, rather than digging for prey. Its diet consists predominantly of caridean shrimp and polychaete worms. Small bony fishes are also eaten, along with the occasional penaeid prawn or amphipod. Larger rays consume {{a greater variety of}} prey and relatively more polychaete worms when compared to smaller rays. This species is parasitized by the tapeworm Acanthobothrium jonesi.|$|E
5|$|Bottom time is {{the time}} spent at depth before {{starting}} the ascent. Bottom time used for decompression planning may be defined differently depending on the tables or algorithm used. It may include descent time, but not in all cases. It is important to check how bottom time is defined for the tables before they are used. For example, tables using Bühlmann's algorithm define bottom time as the elapsed time between leaving the surface {{and the start of}} the final ascent at 10 metres per minute, and if the ascent rate is slower, then the whole of the ascent time needs to be considered part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> time for the algorithm to remain safe.|$|E
5|$|The Nintendo DS's two screens {{act as one}} tall screen; however, in practice, this {{essentially}} {{just gives}} the player {{a better view of}} the surroundings and, save for one boss battle, (Hector the Reflector, where the bottom screen acts as a mirror through which to see Hector during the battle) only provides the benefit of being able to see more (above) and, when the player is on the top screen, below. The game does not make use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> screen's touch sensitivity for basic gameplay, though it is an option for selecting levels and in some mini-games. Each of DSs five worlds has two bosses, each with a weakness that must be identified and exploited. Most of the time, these are simply giant-sized versions of normal enemies, though some are more inventive.|$|E

5|$|The inner {{peridium}} {{is a thin}} shiny {{tissue that}} is depressed into areas demarcated by the pyramidal plates. The puffball base, which occupies about a third to a quarter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the fruit body, consists of moderately-sized chambers that persist even after the gleba has matured and the spores have dispersed. The base can assume a purplish hue after weathering. The base is rooted into the soil with rhizomorphs. Initially white, the gleba turns color from yellow to golden brown to dark brown as the spores mature. As the gleba dries, the inner peridium dries and cracks, exposing the spore mass in cracks between the scales. The gleba {{is supported by a}} yellowish-brown to light brown subgleba.|$|E
5|$|The {{long-term}} success of implants is determined, in part, {{by the forces}} they have to support. As implants have no periodontal ligament, there is no sensation of pressure when biting so the forces created are higher. To offset this, the location of implants must distribute forces evenly across the prosthetics they support. Concentrated forces can result in fracture of the bridgework, implant components, or loss of bone adjacent the implant. The ultimate location of implants is based on both biologic (bone type, vital structures, health) and mechanical factors. Implants placed in thicker, stronger bone like that found in the front part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> jaw have lower failure rates than implants placed in lower density bone, such as the back part of the upper jaw. People who grind their teeth also increase the force on implants and {{increase the likelihood of}} failures.|$|E
5|$|The next match {{featured}} Chris Benoit {{defending the}} United States Championship against Chavo Guerrero (accompanied by Vickie Guerrero). Before {{the bell rang}} to start the match, Chavo tried to attack Benoit, but as the match began, Benoit retaliated by delivering a clothesline. Benoit and Guerrero wrestled inconclusively until Benoit covered Chavo to try to pin him. Chavo managed to place his foot on top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> rope, which forced Benoit to break the pin per official wrestling match rules. While Guerrero was lying on his stomach, Benoit applied the Sharpshooter, and made Chavo submit to retain the championship.|$|E
