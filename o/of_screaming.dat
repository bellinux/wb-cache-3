25|$|While on tour {{again in}} the UK in 1965, Orbison broke his foot falling off a {{motorcycle}} in front of thousands <b>of</b> <b>screaming</b> fans at a race track; he performed his show that evening in a cast. His reconciliation with Claudette occurred {{when she went to}} visit him while he was recuperating from the accident.|$|E
25|$|Rounding out {{the core}} {{recording}} lineup of Homme, Oliveri, and Grohl, was singer/songwriter Mark Lanegan, formerly <b>of</b> <b>Screaming</b> Trees, {{a band that}} Homme had toured with previously. Lanegan joined the band as a full-time member in 2001 after having guested on the band's previous album, Rated R, and provided additional songwriting and lyrics to the group, in addition to lead vocals on several songs.|$|E
25|$|Bardot {{performed}} a farewell show at Channel V – their last public performance – {{in front of}} dozens <b>of</b> <b>screaming</b> fans and {{it proved to be}} highly emotional for both fans and the band members.

25|$|Upon {{the release}} of their second album Ascendancy, Trivium were {{identified}} as melodic metalcore with strong elements of thrash metal, with the third track on the album “Pull Harder on the Strings of Your Martyr” becoming a permanent fixture in the band's set lists {{and the rest of}} the album selling itself to gold status. Ascendancy was even featured as one of Metal Hammer’s Albums of the Decade. Later releases have marked changes in the band. The Crusade was seen as a major shift in musical direction due to the change in vocal style, namely the absence <b>of</b> <b>screaming,</b> and some of the melodies featured.|$|E
25|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Wayne Isham {{is set at}} Los Angeles International Airport and was filmed on April 1, 1999. The Tom Bradley International Terminal is seen in numerous shots and also appears as the band sings and dances to the chorus. In the final chorus, as the band prepares to board their plane, a Boeing 727, they are greeted by a crowd <b>of</b> <b>screaming</b> fans bearing signs and flowers. The scenes involving the plane and the final scenes which featured the fans were filmed {{in one of the}} hangars of LAX. Additionally, a Delta Air Lines L-1011 appears when Howie D. sings the fourth verse.|$|E
25|$|The {{inspiration}} for the recurring motif <b>of</b> <b>screaming</b> mouths in many Bacons of the late 1940s and early 1950s was drawn {{from a number of}} sources, including medical text books, the works of Matthias Grünewald and photographic stills of the nurse in the Odessa Steps scene in Sergei Eisenstein's 1925 silent The Battleship Potemkin. Bacon saw the film in 1935, and viewed it frequently thereafter. He kept in his studio a photographic still of the scene, showing a close-up of the nurse's head screaming in panic and terror and with broken pince-nez spectacles hanging from her blood-stained face. He referred to the image throughout his career, using it as a source of inspiration.|$|E

25|$|In November 1990, Tutunjian's {{high school}} friend Andy Bernick was enlisted to play bass and MIT student Ben Drucker was {{recruited}} on drums. The band began writing and recording songs characterized by shifting tempos, loud vibrato guitars played through numerous effects pedals, Tutunjian and Carmody's melodic vocal interplay, and occasional bursts <b>of</b> <b>screaming</b> and other noise. They completed their first 4-track demo in December 1990, and played their first show on January 25, 1991. Because of the band's practice of alternate guitar tunings, Bernick took to playing tapes or static {{from an old}} AM radio to fill time while Carmody and Tutunjian adjusted their guitars. This lo-fi sound would later spill over between songs on the band's recorded work.|$|E
25|$|Funeral for a Friend's {{popularity}} {{rose in the}} United Kingdom {{with the}} release of their debut album, Casually Dressed & Deep in Conversation (2003). Achieving both a gold certification and three top twenty singles in their home country, Casually Dressed & Deep in Conversation is often acclaimed as one of the landmark emo records of the 2000s. Hours (2005) featured a similar musical style to their debut, but also featured more melodic sensibilities, and Tales Don't Tell Themselves (2007) showed an evolution in Funeral for a Friend's musical style from the style which defined their debut, as the group began to diverge from their use <b>of</b> <b>screaming</b> vocals and post-hardcore influenced guitars, favouring a more melodic rock influence. These albums achieved gold and silver sales certificates respectively in the UK.|$|E
25|$|On 1 April 1978, {{he started}} an ambitious tour of SFR Yugoslavia with Lokice dance group {{in support of}} the album that had already sold 150,000 copies. Čolić also started to play the guitar {{occasionally}} on stage. Putujući zemljotres (Traveling Earthquake Tour) produced and organized by Maksa Ćatović moved all over the country, soon becoming a phenomenon the likes of which the country had not seen before. The scenes <b>of</b> <b>screaming</b> girls rushing the stage were repeated in city after city. The tour's climax took place in Belgrade at Red Star FC stadium on 5 September 1978 with 70,000 people in attendance despite the fact that Čolić already played two sold out shows in Belgrade a few months earlier on 4 and 8 April at Hala Pionir. Supporting Čolić on stage that night were Chris Nicholls on keyboards and Dado Topić on bass guitar with old favourites Kornelije Kovač, Arsen Dedić, Kemal Monteno, Josip Boček, Trio Strune and RTV Belgrade singing quintet appearing as guests. Čolić and the massive tour essentially became a cultural phenomenon transcending musical boundaries such that in the lead up to the big Belgrade concert journalist Dušan Savković and film director Jovan Ristić decided to make a movie about Čolić. Savković wrote a rudimentary screenplay, but the movie ended up being a 90-minute feature documentary titled Pjevam danju, pjevam noću that follows Čolić from Belgrade concert onwards and looks back on his career up to that point. Two days after the Belgrade concert, Čolić was in his hometown Sarajevo at Koševo Stadium for the tour's grand finale, however the rain interrupted much of the concert and the whole thing {{turned out to be a}} little anticlimactic. By the end of its promotion cycle, the album sold more than 700,000 copies and with later re-releases during the 1990s went over the million mark.|$|E

500|$|The final {{fight with}} the Ducky Boys was {{absolutely}} wild, [...] {{for all practical purposes}} it was real. For an entire week hundreds <b>of</b> <b>screaming,</b> stunted madmen—armed with real baseball bats, axe handles, and chains—hurled themselves at us in wave after wave of unabated Celtic fury. It got totally out of hand, with the mayhem sometimes continuing for a full five minutes after [...] yelled cut.

500|$|Nirvana used dynamic shifts {{that went}} from quiet to loud. Cobain {{had sought to}} mix heavy and pop musical sounds; he commented, [...] "I wanted to be totally Led Zeppelin in a way and then be totally extreme punk rock and then do real wimpy pop songs". When Cobain heard the Pixies' 1988 album Surfer Rosa after {{recording}} Bleach, he felt it had the sound he wanted to achieve but until then was too intimidated to try. The Pixies' subsequent popularity encouraged Cobain to follow his instincts as a songwriter. Like the Pixies, Nirvana moved between [...] "spare bass-and-drum grooves and shrill bursts <b>of</b> <b>screaming</b> guitar and vocals". Near {{the end of his}} life, Cobain noted the band had become bored by the formula, finding it limited, but he expressed doubts that the band was skilled enough to try other dynamics.|$|E
500|$|James Whale {{lived as}} an openly gay man {{throughout}} {{his career in the}} British theatre and in Hollywood, something that was virtually unheard of in the 1920s and 1930s. He and David Lewis lived together as a couple from around 1930 to 1952. While he did not go {{out of his way to}} publicize his homosexuality, he did not do anything to conceal it either. As filmmaker Curtis Harrington, a friend and confidant of Whale's, put it, [...] "Not in the sense <b>of</b> <b>screaming</b> it from the rooftops or coming out. But yes, he was openly homosexual. Any sophisticated person who knew him knew he was gay." [...] While there have been suggestions that Whale's career was terminated because of homophobia, and Whale was supposedly dubbed [...] "The Queen of Hollywood", Harrington states that [...] "nobody made a thing out of it as far as I could perceive".|$|E

500|$|As {{the second}} {{rendition}} of the chorus begins, they go to an open field where they run through 10 banners in the quickest time ever of 9.19 s. Quickly after breaking their sixth world record, Williams breaks her first individual record, of doing the [...] "most cartwheels while wearing boots for 20 seconds" [...] by doing 7. The band members reunite and start walking backwards for 30 feet, while blindfolded and holding stuffed animals. This achievement is done by York in the fastest time ever of 6.14 seconds. For the penultimate record, Davis and York break the record of unwrapping a [...] "mummy" [...] in the least time; they unwrap Williams, who is covered in toilet paper, in 9.75 s. During the closing scene, Williams, York and Davis stand on a moving convertible, with Williams breaking the last record <b>of</b> <b>screaming</b> for the maximum time while in a convertible—for 8.48 s. The video concludes as it is revealed that [...] "Ain't It Fun" [...] itself holds the world record of depicting the most world records—10—broken in a music video.|$|E
500|$|On 1 November 1963, The Beatles {{began their}} {{fourth and final}} {{nationwide}} tour of 1963. Tour stops this time included Dublin and Belfast. Three days before the tour started, the band, returning from a five-day Swedish tour, were greeted at Heathrow Airport in heavy rain by thousands <b>of</b> <b>screaming</b> fans, 50 journalists and photographers, and a BBC TV camera crew. The wild scenes at the airport caused the British Prime Minister, being chauffeured in the vicinity, to be delayed, his car obstructed by the crowds. Meanwhile, the current Miss World, passing through the airport herself, was completely ignored by journalists and public alike, and when the American TV presenter Ed Sullivan, numbered among those held up at Heathrow, was told {{the reason for the}} delay, he asked, [...] "Who the hell are The Beatles?". Not long after, there would be similar scenes at an airport in Sullivan's own country, when the Beatles' arrived there for the first time, and he would himself introduce the band to the American nation on The Ed Sullivan Show, watched by 73million viewers.|$|E
500|$|... "The Wall Street Part of Town" [...] {{incorporates}} mandolin, Americana guitar riffs, {{and offers}} encouragement to protesters. Literary journalist Alec Wilkinson {{writes that the}} song's narrator is [...] "looking for refuge {{in the part of}} town where the wind always blows at your back and the ground tilts in your favor." [...] "Guantanamo" [...] features cascading guitar by Cooder and handclaps. The song is about the nadir of human depravity. A slow, 12-bar blues lament, [...] "Cold Cold Feeling" [...] features juke joint, bottleneck guitar, and lyrics placing Barack Obama as the narrator singing his blues in the White House. Cooder meant to draw sympathy from listeners for Barack Obama. Geoff Cowart of musicOMH draws similarities of the song to [...] "the voodoo blues <b>of</b> <b>Screaming</b> Jay Hawkins". [...] "Going to Tampa" [...] is a string band country song in Alla breve meter. Using scathing humor and burlesque lyrical elements, the song's farcical lyrics depict a fictional hijacking of the 2012 Republican National Convention by the Tea Party, as Cooder accuses both parties of racism and social engineering.|$|E
