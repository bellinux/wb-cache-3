5|$|Tessa Ludwick (born October 5, 1988) is a Korean American actress from Apollo Beach, Florida. She began acting at age five, {{when she}} held a lead role in Allegra's Window, a Nick Jr. children's {{television}} program show taped at Universal Studios in Orlando, Florida. When filming on Allegra's Window ended in May 1996, seven-year-old Ludwick went from Allegra's Window to a lead role in Big Bag, a live action television puppet program for preschoolers on the Cartoon Network. At 8, she landed the role <b>of</b> <b>Kate,</b> an orphan girl in the touring Broadway musical Annie, the 20th Anniversary. For the next eight months, she toured the United States and Canada with the musical, during which time Ludwick gave eight performances per week.|$|E

5|$|During the 1880s, Evans printed two {{to three}} Greenaway books a year, {{including}} a run of 150,000 copies <b>of</b> <b>Kate</b> Greenaway's Birthday Book (1880), as well as Mother Goose (1881), The Language of Flowers (1884), Marigold Garden (1885), The Pied Piper of Hamelin (1887), and King Pepito (1889). From the mid-1880s to the mid-1890s Evans printed, and Greenaway illustrated, nine almanacs—one each year. Greenaway benefitted from her association with Evans. As the leading publisher of children's books, Routledge provided Greenaway with a commercial base she may not have achieved without Evans' influence. Children's literature scholar Anne Lundin claims the distinctive quality of Evans' printing, as wells as his popularity as a children's book printer, linked Greenaway's name with his, thereby increasing her commercial appeal. Greenaway often visited the Evans family, played with their three daughters and continued to visit Evans after his move to Ventnor. During her career as an illustrator, Greenaway used Evans as sole engraver and printer.|$|E
5|$|Fred {{prompted}} a hurricane warning for Cape Verde {{for the first}} time ever and was the first storm to pass through the islands as a hurricane since 1892. Strong winds there left about $2.5million in damage. Two deaths were presumed to have occurred after two fishermen never returned to port. Seven other sailors likely drowned offshore Guinea-Bissau after their fishing boat collapsed. Tropical storms Grace, Henri, and Ida left negligible impact on land. Hurricane Joaquin's intensity and slow movement in the vicinity of the Bahamas resulted in severe damage on some islands. Additionally, the American cargo ship SS El Faro went missing near Crooked Island and eventually capsized during the storm, drowning 33people. Rough seas in Haiti also caused damage and one death from a fisherman drowning. Joaquin was the most intense satellite era tropical cyclone of non-tropical origins. The remnants <b>of</b> <b>Kate</b> affected the British Isles, particularly Wales in the United Kingdom. Throughout the season, these storms collectively caused at least $730.4million in damage and 89deaths.|$|E
5|$|From September 28 to October 7, 33ships {{reported}} {{winds of}} over 40mph (65km/h) {{in relation to}} Kate, though nearly all occurred as the storm was becoming extratropical. The highest wind reported was 59mph (95km/h), while the lowest pressure reported from a ship was 989mbar. The interaction between Kate and a high pressure area to its north produced 3–4foot (1m) waves {{along the coast of}} North Carolina and New England. The strongest winds <b>of</b> <b>Kate</b> remained away from any landmasses, though the large circulation produced sustained winds of up to 40mph (65km/h) at Cape Race, Newfoundland. The storm also generated strong swells and surf along the southern portion of the Avalon Peninsula, reaching heights of 9–13feet (3–4m). The combination of moisture from Kate and a stalled frontal system produced moderate amounts of rainfall, with some regions in southeastern Newfoundland receiving more than 4inches (100mm). St. John's reported 1.8inches (45mm) on October 6, a record for the date. Due to dry conditions in the preceding weeks, the ground easily absorbed the water, resulting in a lack of flooding. The extratropical remnant of Hurricane Kate produced winds of up to 70mph (110km/h) in northern Scotland. Overall, there were no reports of damage or deaths associated with Kate.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after peaking, {{the western}} {{portion of the}} central dense overcast, or the area of high, thick clouds around the eye, began to deteriorate, and Hurricane Kate started to weaken. On October 5, the storm dropped below major {{hurricane}} status. Kate turned sharply northward due to it moving around the western periphery of a powerful anticyclone, and consequently slowed its forward motion. It slowly weakened as it turned to the north-northeast, with an eye occasionally re-appearing on satellite images. On October 7, however, Kate weakened to a tropical storm while moving over cooler waters. It accelerated to the northeast, and after passing about 260mi (420km) east of Newfoundland, Kate became extratropical as cold air clouds entrained the center. The system remained a powerful system, and later on October 8 the extratropical remnant <b>of</b> <b>Kate</b> retained winds of up to 75mph (140km/h) while passing south of Greenland. The storm turned to the east, passed a short distance south of Iceland, and merged with another extratropical storm near Scandinavia on October 10.|$|E
