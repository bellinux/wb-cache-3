5|$|A dwarf, in the Dungeons & Dragons (D) fantasy roleplaying game, is a {{humanoid}} race, one of {{the primary}} races available for player characters. The idea for the D dwarf comes from European mythologies and J. R. R. Tolkien's novel The Lord of the Rings (1954-1955), and has been used in D and its predecessor Chainmail since the early 1970s.

5|$|After Poland regained independence, provincial sejms were {{restored}} in the Second Polish Republic, {{although they were}} called sejms rather than sejmiks.

District Commissioners report to the County/Area/Regional Commissioner, who in turn report to the UK Chief Commissioner.|$|E
5|$|At his 1st dan judo examination, Abbe {{had caught}} the {{attention}} of Shotaro Tobata from the Butoku Kai, who had been refereeing at the event.

With the additional help of a teacher named Nakano, Abbe now prepared for the entrance examination in Kyoto.

In one case, he successfully represented the seller of a slave against allegations that the seller knew the slave had incurable tuberculosis. Although Benjamin tried some jury cases, he preferred bench trials in commercial cases and was an expert at appeals.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the general}} {{election}} in February 2011, and {{the election of the}} members of the 24th Seanad, only three political parties had the minimum 20 members of Oireachtas to nominate a candidate: Fine Gael (76 TDs and 19 senators), the Labour Party (37 TDs and 13 senators) and Fianna Fáil (19 TDs and 14 senators). Sinn Féin, the next largest party in the Dáil Éireann, have 14 TDs and 3 senators. For other candidates to be nominated, support from members of smaller parties, independents (<b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>there</b> are currently 14 TDs and 11 senators) or excess members of the three larger parties was needed, or the support of four local authorities.|$|E
5|$|Genetics {{play a role}} in the {{development}} of COPD. It is more common among relatives of those with COPD who smoke than unrelated smokers. Currently, the only clearly inherited risk factor is alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency (AAT). This risk is particularly high if someone deficient in alpha 1-antitrypsin also smokes. It is responsible for about 1–5% of cases and the condition is present in about 3–4 in 10,000 people. Other genetic factors are being investigated, <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>there</b> are likely to be many.|$|E

5|$|In {{the case}} of a driven wheel, a torque must be applied to {{generate}} the locomotive force. In human technology, this torque is generally provided by a motor, <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>there</b> are many types, including electric, piston-driven, turbine-driven, pneumatic, and hydraulic. (Torque may also be provided by human power, as in {{the case of}} a bicycle.) In animals, motion is typically achieved by the use of skeletal muscles, which derive their energy from the metabolism of nutrients from food. Because these muscles are attached to both of the components that must move relative to each other, they are not capable of directly driving a wheel. In addition, large animals cannot produce high accelerations, as inertia increases rapidly with body size.|$|E
5|$|Like the series, {{the game}} takes place over 24 hours {{and has the}} same start and end clocks for each hour, marking the start and end of {{each part of the}} game. The hours are broken down into 58 {{separate}} missions, <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>there</b> are three broad types, each described in further detail below. Some missions are objective based, while others have a time-restricted element. Each mission is graded out of 100 points, based on the quality of performance, number of objectives completed, shooting accuracy and so on. A grade of 90 points or higher rewards the player by unlocking some form of bonus feature, including three movies (interviews with cast about the game, TV promos), 98 images (wallpaper-like images of main characters) and 23 characters (3D models that the player can view).|$|E
