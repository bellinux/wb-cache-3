5|$|Comics {{historian}} Peter Sanderson {{compares the}} 1960s DC {{to a large}} Hollywood studio, and argues that after having reinvented the superhero archetype, DC by {{the latter part of}} the decade was suffering from a creative drought. The audience for comics was no longer just children, and Sanderson sees the 1960s Marvel as the comic equivalent of the French New Wave, developing new methods <b>of</b> <b>storytelling</b> that drew in and retained readers who were in their teens and older and thus influencing the comics writers and artists of the future.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{selling point}} of Front Mission was its {{storytelling}} approach. Taking {{place during the}} 21st and 22nd centuries, the series revolves around military conflicts and political tension between powerful supranational unions and their member states. Although the Front Mission video games use self-contained, standalone stories, these tie into a greater overarching storyline that encompasses the entire series. In combination with the stories from its other media, the series possesses a level <b>of</b> <b>storytelling</b> depth and continuity comparable to a serial drama.|$|E
5|$|Hanna M. Roisman compares Kint to Odysseus, {{capable of}} {{adapting}} both his personality and his tales {{to his current}} audience. Throughout his tale, Kint adapts his confession to Kujan's revealed biases. Roisman draws direct parallels to Odysseus' tales to the Phaeacians: like Odysseus, Kint allows his audience to define him and his narrative. Appealing to Kujan's arrogance, Kint allows himself to be outwitted, humiliated, and broken by his interrogator; Kint further invents a mythical villain that he credulously believes in and gives Kujan the privileged perspective of the skeptic. Kint thus creates a neo-noir thriller inside of a neo-noir thriller and demonstrates the artificiality <b>of</b> <b>storytelling.</b> Benjamin Widiss identifies post-structural elements to the film, such as {{the lack of a}} clear protagonist throughout much of the film. This extends to ambiguity over Kint's role as author or reader, and whether he is Kint pretending to be Söze or the reverse.|$|E

5|$|In 1935, Clouzot was {{diagnosed}} with tuberculosis and was sent first to Haute-Savoie and then to Switzerland, where he was bedridden for nearly five years in all. Clouzot's time in the sanatorium would be very influential on his career. While bedridden, Clouzot read constantly and learned the mechanics <b>of</b> <b>storytelling</b> to help improve his scripts. Clouzot also studied the fragile nature {{of the other people}} in the sanatorium. Clouzot had little money during this period, and was provided with financial and moral support by his family and friends. By the time Clouzot left the sanatorium and returned to Paris, World War II had broken out. French cinema had changed because many of the producers he had known had fled France to escape Nazism.|$|E
5|$|Victorian {{painting}} {{had gone}} through radical changes, and by the 1870s the realism of Etty and the Pre-Raphaelites {{had given way to}} the ideas of the Aesthetic Movement, abandoning the traditions <b>of</b> <b>storytelling</b> and moralising in favour of painting works designed for aesthetic appeal rather than for their narrative or subject. Although the aesthetic movement ultimately led to a brief revival of history painting, these works were in a very different style to Etty's. The new generation of history painters such as Edward Burne-Jones, Lawrence Alma-Tadema and Frederic Leighton sought to depict passivity, rather than the dynamism seen in previous works depicting the classical world. By the end of the 19th century, the value of all of Etty's works had fallen below their original prices. As the 20th century began, the increasingly influential Modernist movement, which came to dominate British art in the 20th century, drew its inspiration from Paul Cézanne and had little regard for 19th-century British painting.|$|E
5|$|The {{transition}} from 2D graphics to 3D environments overlaid on pre-rendered backgrounds {{was accompanied by}} a focus on a more realistic presentation. In previous entries, the sizes for characters and environments were fixed, and the player saw things from a scrolling perspective. This changed with Final Fantasy VII; environments shifted with camera angles, and character model sizes shifted depending on both their place in the environment and their distance from the camera, giving a sense of scale. The choice of this highly cinematic style <b>of</b> <b>storytelling,</b> contrasting directly with Square's previous games, was attributed to Kitase, who was a fan of films and had an interest in the parallels between film and video game narrative. Character movement during in-game events was done by the character designers in the planning group. While designers normally cooperate with a motion specialist for such animations, the designers taught themselves motion work, resulting in each character's movements differing depending on their creators—some designers liked exaggerated movements, while others went for subtlety. Much of the time was spent on each character's day-to-day, routine animations. Motion specialists were brought in for the game's battle animations. The first characters the team worked with were Cloud and Barret. Some of the real-time effects, such as an explosion near the opening, were hand-drawn rather than computer animated.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} how individuals’ {{satisfaction with their}} family, {{as well as the}} ways they negotiated the telling of a family story, combined to predict their perceived quality <b>of</b> the <b>storytelling</b> interaction. Drawing from family members’ (150 individuals, 50 families) joint telling of an often told family story, multilevel modeling analyses revealed significant variance within and between families’ perceived quality <b>of</b> their <b>storytelling</b> interaction. These variances were explained by family satisfaction and family-level ratings <b>of</b> engagement during <b>storytelling.</b> These findings drive our suggestions for future assessment of multiple members’ perspectives <b>of</b> joint family <b>storytelling</b> interactions...|$|R

25|$|Several {{storytelling}} organizations {{started in}} the U.S. during the 1970s. One such organization was the National Association for the Perpetuation and Preservation <b>of</b> <b>Storytelling</b> (NAPPS), now the National Storytelling Network (NSN) and the International Storytelling Center (ISC). NSN is a professional organization that helps to organize resources for tellers and festival planners. The ISC runs the National Storytelling Festival in Jonesborough, TN. Australia followed their American counterparts with the establishment <b>of</b> <b>storytelling</b> guilds in the late 1970s. Australian storytelling today has individuals and groups {{across the country who}} meet to share their stories. The UK's Society for Storytelling was founded in 1993, bringing together tellers and listeners, and each year since 2000 has run a National Storytelling Week the first week of February.|$|E
25|$|Storytelling festivals {{feature the}} work of several storytellers. Elements of the oral {{storytelling}} art form include visualization (the seeing of images in the mind's eye), and vocal and bodily gestures. In many ways, the art <b>of</b> <b>storytelling</b> draws upon other art forms such as acting, oral interpretation and performance studies.|$|E
25|$|Storytelling predates writing. The {{earliest}} forms <b>of</b> <b>storytelling</b> {{were usually}} oral combined with gestures and expressions. In {{addition to being}} part of religious rituals, some archaeologists believe rock art may {{have served as a}} form <b>of</b> <b>storytelling</b> for many ancient cultures. The Australian aboriginal people painted symbols from stories on cave walls as a means of helping the storyteller remember the story. The story was then told using a combination of oral narrative, music, rock art and dance, which bring understanding and meaning of human existence through remembrance and enactment of stories. People have used the carved trunks of living trees and ephemeral media (such as sand and leaves) to record stories in pictures or with writing. Complex forms of tattooing may also represent stories, with information about genealogy, affiliation and social status.|$|E

25|$|This {{teaching}} practice <b>of</b> <b>storytelling</b> allowed {{children to}} formulate ideas {{based on their}} own experiences and perspectives. In Navajo communities, for children and adults, storytelling {{is one of the many}} effective ways to educate both the young and old about their cultures, identities and history. Storytelling help the Navajos know who they are, where they come from and where they belong.|$|E
25|$|Storytelling {{also serves}} {{to deliver a}} {{particular}} message during spiritual and ceremonial functions. In the ceremonial use <b>of</b> <b>storytelling,</b> the unity building theme of the message becomes {{more important than the}} time, place and characters of the message. Once the message is delivered, the story is finished. As cycles of the tale are told and retold, story units can recombine, showing various outcomes for a person's actions.|$|E
25|$|Oral traditions <b>of</b> <b>storytelling</b> {{are found}} in several civilisations, they predate the printed and online press. Storytelling was used to explain natural phenomena, bards told stories of {{creation}} and developed a pantheon of gods and myths. Oral stories passed {{from one generation to}} the next and storytellers were regarded as healers, leader, spiritual guides, teachers, cutural secret keeper and entertainers. Oral storytelling came in various forms including songs, poetry, chants and dance.|$|E
