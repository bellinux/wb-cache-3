40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the effects of}} self-production on <b>outcome</b> <b>evaluations</b> and preferred level {{of involvement in the}} self-production task. Although several studies have already addressed this issue, we extend these findings and emphasize the importance of the recipient of the outcome of self-production, which appears often to be ignored. In two experimental studies, we distinguish between self-production for oneself and self-production for someone else, and investigate the effects and potential differences with regard to this aspect. In Study 1, we hypothesized that self-production for someone else results in more negative <b>outcome</b> <b>evaluations</b> and higher preferences for low self-production treatment. Moreover, we assumed a self-produced outcome (the coffee) mainly reflects the self-producer’s ideal selfconcept when adapted for a friend. Eight hypotheses are subsequently proposed, for situations involving preparing a coffee under two different levels of self-production produced for either oneself or someone else, i. e. a friend. All of them are supported by theories from academic articles, books and other relevant marketing sources. A real self-production experiment design was chosen: the data were obtained from students with different international background. The findings from Study 1 demonstrate that self-production for a friend does not result in more negative <b>outcome</b> <b>evaluations.</b> In fact, {{there were no significant differences}} in <b>outcome</b> <b>evaluations</b> between self-producers that were preparing the outcome for themselves and selfproducers that were preparing the outcome for their friend. Moreover, results did not show higher preferences for low-self-production treatment when self-producing for a friend. We did not observe more positive <b>outcome</b> <b>evaluations</b> in low-self-production conditions or any relationship with higher perceived risk, as we had assumed. Lastly, the self-produced outcome reflects self-producer’s perceptions about the recipient rather than his or her ideal selfconcept. In Study 2 we proposed three additional hypotheses. The analysis showed that outcome satisfaction mediates the positive effects of both process enjoyment and self-production effort on taste evaluations. Moreover, self-production for oneself enhances perceived selfproduction effort while self-production for a friend boosts process enjoyment instead according to our results. Last but not least, limitations and both theoretical and managerial implications are addressed and suggestions for future research are provided. nhhma...|$|R

40|$|<b>Outcomes</b> <b>evaluation</b> is an {{essential}} part of maintaining and improving quality of care. 1, 2 Often mortality rates or other outcomes are collected and compared across hospitals or against a common benchmark. Fair comparison of results requires adequate adjustment for differences in patient risk and type of intervention performed. This is called case mix and determines the risk profile of a hospital. For this purpose, the so-called risk-adjustment methods are used. By correcting for patient characteristics and variables describing the inter-vention, these methods level the playing field and enable the comparison of results. Risk-adjustment models thus constitute a fundamental element in <b>outcomes</b> <b>evaluation.</b> 2 However, much concern has been expressed about the accuracy of cod-ing of risk factors included in such models. 3, 4 After all, errors in the coding of risk factors could invalidate the comparison of outcomes...|$|R

PURPOSE: To evaluate how satisfied are those patients who underwent rhinoplasty to correct crooked nose, through the questionnaire Rhinoplasty <b>Outcomes</b> <b>Evaluation</b> (ROE). MATERIAL AND METHOD: A longitudinal study with retrospective analysis of preoperative satisfaction and prospective analysis of postoperative satisfaction of patients who underwent rhinoplasty. ROE questionnaire was applied twice in the same visit aiming at measuring patient satisfaction in both pre and postoperative periods. Nineteen patients who underwent rhinoplasty answered the ROE. RESULTS: For all patients who underwent rhinoplasty, the average preoperative satisfaction score was of 24. 6 ± 11. 3, while the average postoperative score was of 76. 1 ± 19. 5 (p 30 -year-old patients (p= 0. 05).
