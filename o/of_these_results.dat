5|$|Linezolid was {{associated}} with significantly greater mortality than the comparator antibiotics. When data from all participants were pooled, {{the study found that}} 21.5% of those given linezolid died, compared to 16% of those not receiving it. The difference was found to be due to the inferiority of linezolid in the treatment of Gram-negative infections alone or mixed Gram-negative/Gram-positive infections. In participants whose infection was due to Gram-positive bacteria alone, linezolid was as safe and effective as vancomycin. In light <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>results,</b> the FDA issued an alert reminding healthcare professionals that linezolid is not approved for the treatment of catheter-related infections or infections caused by Gram-negative organisms, and that more appropriate therapy should be instituted whenever a Gram-negative infection is confirmed or suspected.|$|E
5|$|The {{results of}} the local {{elections}} were announced the following day; the remaining councils under Labour control all became Conservative-controlled.

Further pressure followed the {{results of the}} European parliamentary elections, which were announced on 7 June. These showed large declines in the Labour Party's vote.
