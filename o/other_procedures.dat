In 1562 Pius IV issued a papal bull that introduced regulations {{relating to the}} enclosure of the conclave and <b>other</b> <b>procedures.</b> Gregory XV issued two bulls that covered the most minute of details relating to the election; the first, in 1621, concerned electoral processes, while the other, in 1622, fixed the ceremonies to be observed. In December 1904 Pope Pius X issued an apostolic constitution consolidating almost all the previous rules, making some changes, Vacante sede apostolica. John Paul II instituted several reforms in 1996.|$|E

While positive inotropic medications such as norepinephrine sometimes are used in hemorrhagic shock as a result of trauma, {{there is a lack of}} evidence for their use. Therefore, as of 2012 they have not been recommended. Allowing a low blood pressure may be preferred in some situations.|$|E
25|$|When managed {{according}} to the standards, policies and procedures developed by the CSIRO, lambs are normally mulesed {{a few weeks after}} birth. The operation usually takes less than a minute. Standard practice is to do this operation simultaneously with <b>other</b> <b>procedures</b> such as ear marking, tail docking, and vaccination. Because the procedure removes skin, not any underlying flesh or structure, there is little blood loss from the cut other than a minor oozing on the edges of the cut skin.|$|E

The 1908 British Letters Patent was transmitted to the Argentine Foreign Ministry and was formally acknowledged on 18 March 1909 without objections. Argentina also recognised de facto the British permanent local administration set up in 1909, with commercial and naval Argentine vessels that visited the island in the subsequent years duly complying with normal harbour, customs, immigration and <b>other</b> <b>procedures.</b>|$|E

25|$|Osbourne has freely {{admitted}} to having extensive cosmetic surgery. As well as documenting this in her autobiography, she appeared on Dr. Phil on 14 December 2006, and commented on everything that had been surgically changed on her body to improve her appearance. She stated {{that she had had}} a full rhytidectomy, abdominoplasty, mastopexy, as well as many <b>other</b> <b>procedures,</b> but commented that she would not have any surgery performed on her eyes or lips. She has {{admitted to}} spending £300,000 on plastic surgery.|$|E
25|$|MALDI/TOF spectra {{are used}} for the {{identification}} of micro-organisms such as bacteria or fungi. A portion of a colony of the microbe in question is placed onto the sample target and overlaid with matrix. The mass spectra generated are analyzed by dedicated software and compared with stored profiles. Species diagnosis by this procedure is much faster, more accurate and cheaper than <b>other</b> <b>procedures</b> based on immunological or biochemical tests. MALDI/TOF is becoming a standard method for species identification in medical microbiological laboratories.|$|E
25|$|Computer {{models can}} predict tsunami arrival, usually {{within minutes of}} the arrival time. Bottom {{pressure}} sensors can relay information in real time. Based on these pressure readings and other seismic information and the seafloor's shape (bathymetry) and coastal topography, the models estimate the amplitude and surge height of the approaching tsunami. All Pacific Rim countries collaborate in the Tsunami Warning System and most regularly practise evacuation and <b>other</b> <b>procedures.</b> In Japan, such preparation is mandatory for government, local authorities, emergency services and the population.|$|E

This evaluation requires the auditor to interview employees, observe operations, obtain third-party references, {{and read the}} recipient’s prior audit reports, among <b>other</b> <b>procedures.</b> This helps the auditor understand the recipient and determine whether {{it is likely that}} it does or doesn’t comply with federal laws and regulations. This is performed because the recipient’s operations, procedures, and work ethic directly affects the compliance of individual federal programs with laws and regulations.|$|E
25|$|The Ex-Maze is a {{minimally}} invasive procedure, first reported in 2007, that also creates a lesion pattern across both atria epicardially on the beating heart. As with <b>other</b> <b>procedures</b> off-bypass, the surgeon can confirm that AF corrects to normal sinus rhythm during the procedure. Laparoscopic instruments {{are used to}} access the pericardium through the diaphragm. Like many heart-cauterizing instruments, the Ex-Maze device uses heat generated by a radiofrequency coil. The coil is inside a plastic tube that uses suction to maintain contact against the beating heart’s surface.|$|E

25|$|Diagnostic Radiographers can specialise {{in-house}} {{or through}} a university course as a postgraduate in CT, MRI, Ultrasound or Nuclear Medicine with opportunities to gain an MSc or PhD in their field. Diagnostic Radiographers in the UK are also taking on roles that were typically only undertaken by the radiologist (a medical doctor who specialised in interpreting X-rays), Urologist or Cardiologist in the past. This extended practice includes various interventional procedures not excluding barium enemas, barium meals/swallows, peripheral angioplasties, nerve root injections, central line insertions and many <b>other</b> <b>procedures.</b>|$|E
25|$|Sōshi (Japanese) {{means the}} {{creation}} of a Japanese family name (shi, Korean ssi), distinct from a Korean family name or seong (Japanese sei). Japanese family names represent the families they belong to and can be changed by marriage and <b>other</b> <b>procedures,</b> while Korean family names represent paternal linkages and are unchangeable. Japanese policy dictated that Koreans either could register a completely new Japanese family name unrelated to their Korean surname, or have their Korean family name, in Japanese form, automatically become their Japanese name if no surname was submitted before the deadline.|$|E
25|$|Fasting {{is often}} practiced prior to surgery or <b>other</b> <b>procedures</b> that require general anesthetics {{because of the}} risk of {{pulmonary}} aspiration of gastric contents after induction of anesthesia (i.e., vomiting and inhaling the vomit, causing life-threatening aspiration pneumonia). Additionally, certain medical tests, such as cholesterol testing (lipid panel) or certain blood glucose measurements require fasting for several hours so that a baseline can be established. In the case of a lipid panel, failure to fast for a full 12 hours (including vitamins) will guarantee an elevated triglyceride measurement.|$|E

25|$|From 1991 to 1995, the Croatian {{police were}} a militarised force, {{charged with the}} role of {{defending}} the country during the secession from Yugoslavia, in addition to their regular police tasks. Military training taught police officers to use firearms before exhausting <b>other</b> <b>procedures,</b> which has affected the philosophy and behaviour of police officers in using excessive force. Significant developments have been made to achieve democratic policing in a modern, professional force that is also accountable to the public. However, citizen complaints of violent police behaviour suggest that the militarisation of the police force in the early 1990s continues to influence the level of force accepted as legitimate and reasonable by Croatian police officers.|$|E
25|$|The court first {{considered}} clause 2.1 in the Development Agreement. They noted that, {{while on}} its face it seemed to create in Burger King a right to terminate {{in the event of}} non-compliance by Hungry Jack's, it was actually subject to a number of qualifications, and that there were <b>other</b> <b>procedures</b> within the agreement for dealing with situations of non-compliance. The court disagreed with Burger King's broad reading of the consequences of a breach of clause 2.1, concluding that such an interpretation would mean that Hungry Jack's could not take advantage of the grace period, and that a narrower view should be preferred. Accordingly, they found that since Burger King had not allowed the 12-month grace period to expire, its termination was not effective.|$|E

The artist believes that this pencil sketch was the turning point in his life. Expenses made for this painting were 500,000 Rs.
