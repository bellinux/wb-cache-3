5|$|In February 2000, Jeremy and his brother, Julian, formed Soule Media as an {{independent}} music production company; its name has since been changed to Artistry Entertainment. Julian works as a sound engineer and composer for the company, and has assisted Jeremy in several projects throughout his career, both credited and uncredited. The first large project that Jeremy Soule worked <b>on</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> company was 2000's Icewind Dale, which won the best music {{of the year award}} from both IGN and GameSpot.|$|E
5|$|In {{the male}} frog, the two testes are {{attached}} to the kidneys and semen passes into the kidneys through fine tubes called efferent ducts. It then travels <b>on</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> ureters, which are consequently known as urinogenital ducts. There is no penis, and sperm is ejected from the cloaca directly onto the eggs as the female lays them. The ovaries of the female frog are beside the kidneys and the eggs pass down a pair of oviducts and through the cloaca to the exterior.|$|E

5|$|Isopods have {{a simple}} gut which lacks a midgut section; instead there are caeca {{connected}} {{to the back of}} the stomach in which absorption takes place. Food is sucked into the esophagus, a process enhanced in the blood-sucking parasitic species, and passed by peristalsis into the stomach, where the material is processed and filtered. The structure of the stomach varies, but in many species there is a dorsal groove into which indigestible material is channelled and a ventral part connected to the caeca where intracellular digestion and absorption take place. Indigestible material passes <b>on</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> hindgut and is eliminated through the anus, which is on the pleotelson.|$|E
5|$|The Kangaroos {{never forgot}} their roots and {{continued}} to work in Canada off and <b>on</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> years; in addition to Stampede Wrestling, the team also worked for NWA All-Star Wrestling based in Vancouver, British Columbia. Costello featured in a National Film Board of Canada short subject La Lotta/Wrestling/Le Catch. Their stint in NWA All-Star Wrestling {{was the last time}} Costello and Heffernan teamed together. In June 1965, The Kangaroos lost to Don Leo Jonathan and Jim Hardy and then split up. Heffernan had left Australia to tour the world in 1953 and wanted to return to his homeland, while Costello was determined to remain in the United States for a while longer.|$|E
5|$|After {{capturing}} the crater, Cherry pushed <b>on</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> village, where his party emerged {{from among the}} buildings on the far side. Another stiff fight ensured {{with a group of}} Germans in dug-outs {{by the side of the}} road, before the company was able to meet up with its fellow units which had bypassed the village and were already established to the north and east of the area. Cherry's orders were to fall back into reserve, but he disregarded them as he sensed a counter-attack was forthcoming. At 09:00 on 27 March, the Germans launched a very strong counter-attack under heavy artillery fire. At one point, Cherry noticed that the Germans were firing yellow flares to pinpoint Australian positions to their gunners. He found some of these flares, and fired them away from his position. The German attempts to retake Lagnicourt—at a cost to the 7th Brigade of 377 casualties—raged all day before they abandoned the counterattack.|$|E

5|$|After the Iberian king Pharasmanes I had his son Rhadamistus (r.51–55AD) invade Armenia to depose the Roman client king Mithridates, Vologeses I of Parthia (r. c.51–77AD) {{planned to}} invade and place his brother, the later Tiridates I of Armenia, on the throne. Rhadamistus was {{eventually}} driven from power, and, {{beginning with the}} reign of Tiridates, Parthia would retain firm control over Armenia—with brief interruptions—through the Arsacid Dynasty of Armenia. Even {{after the fall of}} the Parthian Empire, the Arsacid line lived <b>on</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Armenian kings. However, not only did the Arsacid line continue through the Armenians, it as well continued through the Georgian kings with the Arsacid dynasty of Iberia, and for many centuries afterwards in Caucasian Albania through the Arsacid Dynasty of Caucasian Albania.|$|E
5|$|After the Japanese {{occupied}} Indonesia in 1942, Santoso {{left her}} work as a teacher and found employment as legal assistant to Soepomo, who later became the country's first minister of justice. In 1945, with the Japanese preparing to withdraw from the Indies and the proclamation of independence looming, Santoso {{became a member of the}} Committee for Preparatory Work for Indonesian Independence. On 12 March 1946, Santoso became the first ever female cabinet member when she was selected as services minister in the Second Sjahrir Cabinet. Working quickly and efficiently, she found herself organising the return of internees from Japanese-run camps. She was kept <b>on</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Third Sjahrir Cabinet, but when it dissolved on 26 June 1947, Santoso refused another term as social minister. She instead chose to work as head of prime minister Amir Sjarifuddin's secretariat. She kept this position into the First Hatta Cabinet. During Operation Kraai, a Dutch-led offensive on the city of Yogyakarta on 19 December 1948, her husband was killed outside Maguwo.|$|E
5|$|All five {{ships of}} the class served with the Atlantic Fleet for the {{majority}} of their careers. In 1907, Virginia, Georgia, and New Jersey took part in the Jamestown Exposition to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the founding of the Jamestown colony. The five ships took part in the cruise of the Great White Fleet in 190709, though Nebraska, which had been built on the west coast of the United States, joined the fleet after it had reached California in 1908. The fleet left Hampton Roads on 16 December 1907 and steamed south, around South America and back north to the US west coast. The ships then crossed the Pacific and stopped in Australia, the Philippines, and Japan before continuing <b>on</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Indian Ocean. They transited the Suez Canal and toured the Mediterranean before crossing the Atlantic, arriving bank in Hampton Roads on 22 February 1909 for a naval review with President Theodore Roosevelt.|$|E

5|$|Core Design {{improved}} and modified the character with each instalment. Developers for Tomb Raider II {{increased the number}} of polygons in the character's model and added more realistic curves to its design. Other changes included new outfits and manoeuvres. Core Design reportedly planned to implement crawling as a new gameplay option, but the option did not appear until Tomb Raider III. Actress Judith Gibbins took over voice acting responsibilities and stayed <b>on</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> third game. For Tomb Raider III, the developers {{increased the number of}} polygons in Croft's 3D model to about 300, and introduced more abilities to the gameplay. Core Design wanted to reintroduce the character to players in Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation and included a flashback scenario with a younger Lara. The developers expanded the character's set of moves threefold to allow more interaction with the environment, like swinging on ropes and kicking open doors. The character model was altered to feature more realistic proportions, and Jonell Elliott replaced Gibbins as the voice of Lara Croft. By the time development for The Last Revelation began, Core Design had worked on the series constantly for four years and the staff felt they had exhausted their creativeness. Feeling the series lacked innovation, Core Design decided to kill the character and depicted Croft trapped by a cave-in during the final scenes of the game.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} of the 2014 live-action film was generally negative among Japanese and Western film critics, especially following the film’s showing at LA EigaFest. Areas frequently targeted for criticism were Ryuhei Kitamura's direction, the film’s supporting characters, screenplay, cinematography and editing (especially in the action scenes), costume design and soundtrack. The film was also criticized for having most of the its dialogue performed in English (resulting in poor delivery and intonation of numerous lines by its Asian cast members), and for overall squandering its potential as an adaptation of Monkey Punch’s manga. Shun Oguri, Tetsuji Tamayama, Gō Ayano, Meisa Kuroki and Tadanobu Asano were, however, frequently seen as well-cast in their respective roles. Audience opinions were mixed, with some viewing the film as “an enjoyable time to be had to the whole family”, while others viewed {{it as part of}} a “terrible live-action adaptation trend that has been going <b>on</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> years”.|$|E

5|$|During the passage, Nelson {{captured}} the Spanish frigate Santa Sabina and placed Lieutenants Jonathan Culverhouse and Thomas Hardy {{in charge of}} the captured vessel, taking the Spanish captain on board Minerve. Santa Sabina {{was part of a larger}} Spanish force, and the following morning two Spanish ships-of-the-line and a frigate were sighted closing fast. Unable to outrun them, Nelson initially determined to fight but Culverhouse and Hardy raised the British colours and sailed northeast, drawing the Spanish ships after them until being captured, giving Nelson the opportunity to escape. Nelson went on to rendezvous with the British fleet at Elba, where he spent Christmas. He sailed for Gibraltar in late January, and after learning that the Spanish fleet had sailed from Cartagena, stopped just long enough to collect Hardy, Culverhouse, and the rest of the prize crew captured with Santa Sabina, before pressing <b>on</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> straits to join Sir John Jervis off Cadiz.|$|E
5|$|Following the explosions, the Allied advance was {{virtually}} unopposed as the Germans were too stunned and demoralised {{to put up}} much resistance. However, not everything went the Australians' way. The 3rd Division, under Major General John Monash, suffered heavy casualties when they were shelled by phosgene gas and shrapnel shells while moving towards the line of departure, nevertheless the division still managed to get into position {{for the start of}} the attack. Strong German counterattacks were launched the next day, once again supported by concentrated artillery fire; however, the advance was able to continue <b>on</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> mess of concrete blockhouses the Germans had erected and continued on until all the objectives had been taken. Australian casualties amounted to nearly 6,800 men. On 2 July 1917, Major General Holmes was mortally wounded by a German shellburst while surveying the Messines battlefield with the Premier of New South Wales, William Holman.|$|E
5|$|From {{that date}} <b>on,</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Age of Discovery, European {{colonization}} brought extensive American territory {{under the control}} of Europe's monarchs, though the majority of these colonies subsequently gained independence from their rulers. Some did so via armed conflict with their mother countries, as in the American Revolution and the Latin American wars of independence, usually severing all ties to the overseas monarchies in the process. Others gained full sovereignty by legislative paths, such as Canada's patriation of its constitution from the United Kingdom. A certain number of former colonies became republics immediately upon achieving self-governance. The remainder continued with endemic constitutional monarchies—in the cases of Haiti, Mexico, and Brazil—with their own resident monarch and, for places such as Canada and some island states in the Caribbean, sharing their monarch with their former metropole, the most recently created being that of Belize in 1981.|$|E

5|$|In the beginning, {{there was}} only Primus, the god of light and creation, who had been brought forth by Cybertron itself as the {{counterpart}} to another, unnamed being. Deeming that his power was too great to be contained by himself alone, he split his potency into five beings, including of course himself, and also Solomus, who possessed great wisdom; Epistemus, who was a fount of knowledge; Adaptus, who could alter his shape into an infinity of forms; and Mortilus, the embodiment of death, the necessary end of life. For a time, these five entities, known as the Guiding Hand, led life on Cybertron to heights of harmony and creation, but eventually Mortilus tried to {{change the course of}} life so that the Cybertronians would become a Universe-conquering army. What followed was a veritable war of the gods, which ended in tragedy and devastation. Mortilus himself perished, but not before dealing severe and irreversible damage to {{the other members of the}} Guiding Hand. On the verge of death, Primus withdrew into the planet itself, communicating from then <b>on</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> supercomputer Vector Sigma; while the other three only survive as relics which are essential to the Cybertronian race. Solomus' essence had been imprisoned by Mortilus in a crystal container, but he managed to change it into a vessel which would let those who were worthy partake of his undying wisdom. In this form he is known as the Matrix of Leadership, which also provides a link to Primus and thus to life itself. Epistemus and Adaptus had been shred down to their very cores, but now became the first blueprints for the two most basic components of all Cybertronians from then on, namely the brain module and the transformation cog. With the death of Mortilus himself, a Cybertronian's life force would be immune to the ravages of time, rendering them effectively immortal.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Jin {{had been}} afflicted by {{multiple}} revolts. In Manchuria, the Khitans, {{under the leadership}} of Yelü Liuge, declared their independence from the Jin and allied with the Mongols. Yelü was enthroned a puppet ruler subordinate to the Mongols in 1213, and given the title emperor of the Liao Dynasty. The Jurchen expedition sent against him commanded by Puxian Wannu was not successful. Wannu, realizing the Jin dynasty {{was on the verge of}} collapse, rebelled and declared himself king of Dazhen in 1215. Further south, rebellions had broken out in Shandong beginning with Yang Anguo's revolt in 1214. The rebels were known as Red Coats, from the color of the uniforms they wore starting in 1215. After the fall of Zhongdu in 1215, the Mongols downsized their war effort against the Jin, and shifted their resources in preparation for the invasion of Central Asia. The Jurchens tried to make up for their territorial losses to the Mongols by invading the Song in 1217. The invasion was fruitless, so the Jin wanted to negotiate for peace, but the Song rebuffed the offers. By 1218, Jurchen diplomats were prohibited from traveling to the Song. The Mongol war against the Jurchens had subsided, but not stopped, and went <b>on</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> early 1220s under the command of the general Muqali. Muqali died from sickness in 1223, and the Mongol campaigns against the Jin wound down. The Jin settled for peace with the Song, but the Song continued to assist the Red Coats insurgency against the Jin. Genghis Khan fell ill and died in 1227. Ögedei was his successor, and he renewed the war against the Jin in 1230.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 1/2 November 1942, the Eighth Army {{attacked}} again in the north, with 2nd New Zealand Division in the lead. Freyberg placed 151 Brigade {{on the right and}} 152 Brigade on the left. The aim was to attack directly westwards across the Rahman track, with the infantry leading the night assault and 9th Armoured Brigade (now commanded by Brigadier John C. Currie) again passing through to break the enemy gun line and allow X Corps to break out. The assault went to plan except that opposition on the left was heavier than expected which slowed the advance. As a result, the advancing tanks were highlighted against the dawn sky in the east and began to be picked off by Axis anti-tank fire. The Regiment was in the centre of the 9th Armoured Brigade, and the CO lost touch with both his artillery support and close anti-tank support. In the growing light, the B squadron commander (Major M.StJ.V.Gibbs) realised that he was in a ring of enemy anti-tank guns, ahead and to both flanks. He gave the order to 'Charge' and B Squadron overran the anti-tank positions, losing some vehicles but destroying the enemy gun line. Meanwhile, the 21st Panzer Division was counter-attacking A and C Squadrons and at 4pm the Regiment (now down to four tanks) was withdrawn. The 1st Armoured Division from X Corps were just behind the 9th Armoured Brigade but there were no liaison officers between the units and 1st Armoured did not take the opportunity to push <b>on</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> broken Axis gun-line.|$|E
