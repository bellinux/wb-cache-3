40|$|Oxygen and nitric <b>oxide</b> <b>reductases</b> are enzymes {{found in}} aerobic and {{anaerobic}} respiration, respectively. Both enzyme groups {{belong to the}} superfamily of Heme-Copper Oxidases, which is further divided into several subgroups: oxygen-reducing enzymes into A-, B- and C-type and nitric <b>oxide</b> <b>reductases</b> into qNORs and cNORs. Oxygen reducing enzymes use the energy released from oxygen reduction to take up electrons and protons from different sides of the membrane. Additionally, protons are pumped. These processes produce a membrane potential, which {{is used by the}} ATP-synthase to produce ATP, the universal energy currency of the cell. Nitric <b>oxide</b> <b>reductases</b> are not known to conserve the energy from nitric oxide reduction, although the reaction is highly exergonic. Here, the detailed mechanism of a B-type oxidase is studied with special interest in an element involved in proton pumping (proton loading site, PLS). The study supports the hypothesis that the PLS is protonated in one and deprotonated in the consecutive step of the oxidative catalytic cycle, and that a proton is pumped during the final oxidation phase. It further strengthens the previous suggestion that the PLS is a cluster instead of a single residue or heme propionate. Additionally, it is proposed that the residue Asp 372, which is in vicinity of the heme a 3  propionates previously suggested as PLS, is part of this cluster. In another study, we show that the Glu 15 II at the entry of the proton pathway in the B-type oxidase is the only crucial residue for proton uptake, while Tyr 248 is or is close to the internal proton donor responsible for coupling proton pumping to oxygen reduction. The thesis also includes studies on the mechanism and electrogenicity of qNOR. We show that there is a difference in the proton-uptake reaction between qNOR and the non-electrogenic homolog cNOR, hinting at a different reaction mechanism. Further, studies on a qNOR from a different host showed that qNOR is indeed electrogenic.

40|$|Limited {{availability}} of carbon sources has {{been regarded as}} an important factor leading to N 2 O accumulation during denitrification in wastewater treatment. By varying the carbon (methanol) loading rate to a methanol utilizing denitrifying culture {{in the presence of}} various electron acceptors (nitrate, nitrite, N 2 O and their combinations), this study quantitatively investigated the electron distribution among different nitrogen <b>oxide</b> <b>reductases</b> during denitrification. The results showed that electron competition occurs under not only carbon limiting but also carbon abundant conditions. The electron distribution among the nitrogen <b>oxide</b> <b>reductases</b> is affected by the carbon loading rate, with a lower fraction of electrons distributed to the N 2 O reductase with reduced carbon loading rate. N 2 O accumulation occurs when the electron flux going to nitrite reduction is higher than that going to N 2 O reduction. The study also showed that, for the culture investigated, the carbon to nitrogen ratio is not a key factor leading to N 2 O accumulation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} the {{bacteria}} that form associations with plants are denitrifiers. To learn more about how the association with plants affects expression of denitrification genes, the regulation of nitrite and nitric <b>oxide</b> <b>reductases</b> was investigated in Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Analysis of free-living cells revealed that expression of the genes encoding nitrite and nitric <b>oxide</b> <b>reductases,</b> nirK and nor, respectively, requires low-oxygen conditions, nitric oxide, and the transcriptional regulator NnrR. Expression of nor was monitored in plant-associated bacteria using nor-gfp fusion expression.

Inactivation of nirK had no significant effect on the ability of A. tumefaciens to bind to plant roots regardless of the oxygen tension, but it did decrease the occurrence of root-associated fluorescent cells. When wild-type cells containing the gfp fusion were infiltrated into leaves, most cells eventually became fluorescent. The same result was obtained when a nirK mutant was used, suggesting that nitric oxide activated nor expression in the endophytic bacteria. Addition of a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor to block nitric oxide generation by the plant prevented gfp expression in infiltrated nitrite reductase mutants, demonstrating that plant-derived nitric oxide can activate nor expression in infiltrated cells...|$|R

40|$|Two genes, norB and norZ, {{encoding}} {{two independent}} nitric <b>oxide</b> <b>reductases</b> {{have been identified}} in Alcaligenes eutrophus H 16. norB and norZ predict polypeptides of 84. 5 kDa with amino acid sequence identity of 90 %. While norB resides on the megaplasmid pHG 1, the norZ gene is located on a chromosomal DNA fragment. Amino acid sequence analysis suggests that norB and norZ encode integral membrane proteins composed of 14 membrane-spanning helices. The region encompassing helices 3 to 14 shows similarity to the NorB subunit of common bacterial nitric <b>oxide</b> <b>reductases,</b> including the positions of six strictly conserved histidine residues. Unlike the Nor enzymes characterized so far from denitrifying bacteria, NorB and NorZ of A. eutrophus contain an amino-terminal extension which may form two additional helices connected by a hydrophilic loop of 203 amino acids. The presence of a NorB/NorZ-like protein was predicted from the genome sequence of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803. While the common NorB of denitrifying bacteria is associated with a second cytochrome c subunit, encoded by the neighboring gene norC, the nor loci of A. eutrophus and Synechocystis lack adjacent norC homologs. The physiological roles of norB and norZ in A. eutrophus were investigated with mutants disrupted in the two genes. Mutants bearing single-site deletions in norB or norZ were affected neither in aerobic nor in anaerobic growth with nitrate or nitrite as the terminal electron acceptor. Inactivation of both norB and norZ was lethal to the cells under anaerobic growth conditions. Anaerobic growth was restored in the double mutant by introducing either norB or norZ on a broad-host-range plasmid.
