[...] "Either you directly perceive beauty, <b>or</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not. And either you directly perceive God in intuition, <b>or</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not." [...] Further, he maintains {{the arguments of}} both mystics and naturalists in denying each other’s positions are invalid, as they concern different realities.|$|E
2500|$|In the 2006 general election, Chiam and Low {{retained}} their seats, and Sylvia Lim {{from the}} WP was appointed an NCMP. The Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong referred to Low, {{who is the}} WP's Secretary-General, as Leader of the Opposition during a debate in the House on 13 November 2006. However, following the 2011 general election, Low announced {{he would not be}} accepting the title. He said: [...] "Either you have a leader of the opposition, <b>or</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not have it. There's no need to have an unofficial leader of the opposition." [...] He also noted that the title appeared [...] "derogatory" [...] to him because it implied that [...] "you only qualify as unofficial".|$|E

We gave you four years, and looking into your face, I {{think that it}} has been enough. I think that the weariness is there already. In any case, the charge which I lay upon you in these my last moments, is one which you can escape by death only." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{said nothing}} about various documents, Miss Harmer," [...] Dr. Ashleigh said, sternly. [...] "I asked <b>you,</b> <b>do</b> <b>you,</b> <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> not, know where the will is?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll {{make the}} riffle yet," [...] he said quietly. [...] "Just now I don't see what I could do, or where I could chip in your little game; but if I DO, <b>or</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> count me in {{and let me}} know. You know where to write,--my old address at Sacramento." [...] He walked to the corner, took up his still wet serape, threw it over his shoulders, {{and picked up his}} broad-brimmed riding-hat.|$|E
60|$|You {{charge that}} we stir up insurrections among your slaves. We deny it; {{and what is}} your proof'? Harper's Ferry! John Brown!! John Brown was no Republican; and you have failed to {{implicate}} a single Republican in his Harper's Ferry enterprise. If any member of our party is guilty in that matter you know it <b>or</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not know it. If you do know it, you are inexcusable for not designating the man and proving the fact. If you do not know it, you are inexcusable for asserting it, and especially for persisting in the assertion after you have tried and failed to make the proof. You need not be told that persisting in a charge which one does not know to be true is simply malicious slander.|$|E
60|$|But what is Beauty, you ask, {{and what}} will Power do? And here I reach my utmost point in the {{direction}} of what you are free to call the rhapsodical and the incomprehensible. I will not even attempt to define Beauty. I will not because I cannot. To me it is a final, quite indefinable thing. Either you understand it <b>or</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not. Every true artist and many who are not artists know--they know there is something that shows suddenly--it may be in music, it may be in painting, it may be in the sunlight on a glacier or a shadow cast by a furnace or the scent of a flower, it may be in the person or act of some fellow creature, but it is right, it is commanding, it is, to use theological language, the revelation of God.|$|E

[...] "No! <b>you</b> <b>do</b> what is worse--you {{believe in}} your own opinion; you persist {{in your own}} conclusion--with the newspaper before <b>you!</b> <b>Do</b> <b>you,</b> <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> not, believe the newspaper?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear fellow," [...] said Trefusis, almost affectionately, [...] "if {{a man has}} a {{conscience}} he can have no choice in matters of conviction. I have read somewhere {{in your book that}} the man who will not shed his blood for the liberty of his brothers is a coward and a slave. Will you not shed a drop of ink--my ink, too--for the right of your brothers to the work of their hands? I at first sight did not care to sign this petition, because I would as soon petition a tiger to share his prey with me as our rulers to relax their grip of the stolen labor they live on. But Donovan Brown said to me, 'You have no choice. Either you believe that the laborer should have the fruit of his labor <b>or</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not. If you do, put your conviction on record, even if it should be as useless as Pilate's washing his hands.' So I signed." ...|$|E
6000|$|I next went, as {{a matter}} of course, to the Uffizi gallery, and, in the first place, to the Tribune, where the Venus de' Medici deigned to reveal herself rather more satisfactorily than at my last visit. [...] . I looked into all the rooms, bronzes, drawings, and gem-room; a volume might easily be written upon either subject. The {{contents}} of the gem-room especially require to be looked at separately in order to convince one's self of their minute magnificences; for, among so many, the eye slips from one to another with only a vague outward sense that here are whole shelves full of little miracles, both of nature's material and man's workmanship. Greater [larger] things can be reasonably well appreciated with a less scrupulous though broader attention; but in order to estimate the brilliancy of the diamond eyes of a little agate bust, for instance, you have to screw your mind down to them and nothing else. You must sharpen your faculties of observation to a point, and touch the object exactly on the right spot, <b>or</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not appreciate it at all. It is a troublesome process when there are a thousand such objects to be seen.|$|E
6000|$|Another is John Brown: [...] "You stir up insurrections, you {{invade the}} South; John Brown! Harper's Ferry!" [...] Why, John Brown {{was not a}} Republican! You have never implicated a single Republican in that Harper's Ferry enterprise. We tell you that if {{any member of the}} Republican party is guilty in that matter, you know it <b>or</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not know it. If you do know it, you are inexcusable not to {{designate}} the man and prove the fact. If you do not know it, you are inexcusable to assert it, and especially to persist in the assertion after you have tried and failed to make the proof. You need not be told that persisting in a charge which one does not know to be true is simply malicious slander. Some of you admit that no Republican designedly aided or encouraged the Harper's Ferry affair, but still insist that our doctrines and declarations necessarily lead to such results. We do not believe it. We know we hold to no doctrines, and make no declarations, which were not held to and made by our fathers who framed the Government 'under which we live, and we cannot see how declarations that were patriotic when they made them are villainous when we make them. You never dealt fairly by us in relation to that affair--and I will say frankly that I know of nothing in your character that should lead us to suppose that you would. You had just been soundly thrashed in elections in several States, and others were soon to come. You rejoiced at the occasion, and only were troubled that there were not three times as many killed in the affair. You were in evident glee; there was no sorrow for the killed nor for the peace of Virginia disturbed; you were rejoicing that by charging Republicans with this thing you might get an advantage of us in New York, and the other States. You pulled that string as tightly as you could, but your very generous and worthy expectations were not quite fulfilled. Each Republican knew that the charge was a slander as to himself at least, and was not inclined by it to cast his vote in your favor. It was mere bushwhacking, because you had nothing else to do. You are still on that track, and I say, go on! If you think you can slander a woman into loving you or a man into voting for you, try it till you are satisfied! ...|$|E

5000|$|Here is the argument, {{as found}} in Origen:If it is fated that you will recover from this illness, then, {{regardless}} of whether you consult a doctor <b>or</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not consult doctor you will recover. But also: if it is fated that you won't recover from this illness, then, regardless of whether you consult a doctor <b>or</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not consult doctor you won't recover. But either it is fated that you will recover from this illness or it is fated that you won't recover. Therefore it is futile to consult a doctor. The argument has force only for those who accept that what happens to people is determined by fate.|$|E
5000|$|Some of St. Mother Teresa's {{defenders}} {{have argued}} that baptisms are either soul-saving or harmless and hence the criticisms would be pointless (a variant of Pascal's Wager).

5000|$|On the {{television}} show Ebert & Roeper, Richard Roeper gave Mission: Impossible III a [...] "thumbs up," [...] while Roger Ebert gave it a marginal [...] "thumbs down." [...] In Ebert's print review, he gave the film a score of {{two and a half}} stars out of four, saying, [...] "Either you want to see mindless action and computer-generated sequences executed with breakneck speed and technical precision, <b>or</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not. I am getting to the point where I don't much care." [...] He felt [...] "surprised that the plot hangs together more than in the other two films." ...|$|E
5000|$|A group e-mail sent by Cerner CEO Neal Patterson to {{managers}} of a facility in Kansas City concerning [...] "Cerner's declining work ethic" [...] read, in part, [...] "The {{parking lot is}} sparsely used at 8 A.M.; likewise at 5 P.M. As managers—you either {{do not know what}} your EMPLOYEES are doing; <b>or</b> <b>YOU</b> <b>do</b> not CARE ... In either case, you have a problem and you will fix it or I will replace you." [...] After the e-mail was forwarded to hundreds of other employees, it quickly leaked to the public. On the day that the e-mail was posted to Yahoo!, Cerner's stock price fell by over 22% from a high market capitalization of US$1.5 billion.|$|E
5000|$|Hopkins {{said after}} Predator 2 he [...] "looked {{around for a}} good film for a long time, and I couldn't get {{anything}} I wanted to do... I didn't realise the Hollywood trick. In American action movies, people get shot to death and their arms are blown off, and they get up and they're fine. These films {{are supposed to be}} fun things that people can laugh at. I always thought, `That's wrong, that's not what violence is like.' I took these films too seriously and tried to add profound depths, and that's not what's wanted. You either do that film <b>or</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> the other one, but I kept mixing the two up, and probably unsuccessfully.' ...|$|E

5000|$|In 1862 as {{an audit}} student, M. Kropyvnytsky {{attended}} {{classes at the}} Law Faculty of Kiev University.

He later criticized this work as it was an attempt by inexperienced author. Now the play is known in the version, that has undergone numerous fundamental revisions. M. Kropyvnytsky had not completed his education for various reasons; yet he constantly complemented to his knowledge independently, especially after he moved to Elisavetgrad, {{where there was a}} library. There, {{he had a chance to}} get acquainted with Robert Owen, John Stuart Mill, Shakespeare, Byron, Goethe, Heine, Dumas, George Sand, Thackeray and many others. At the government service, he almost got no promotion, and often completely lost his earnings due to his devotion for art and amateur performances.|$|E
