40|$|Organizational {{creativity}} is increasingly important for organizations aiming {{to survive and}} thrive in complex and unexpectedly changing environments. It is precondition of innovation and a driver of an organization’s performance success. Whereas innovation research increasingly promotes high-involvement and participatory innovation, the models <b>of</b> organizational <b>creativity</b> are still mainly based on an individual-creativity view. Likewise, the definitions <b>of</b> organizational <b>creativity</b> and innovation are somewhat equal, and they are used as interchangeable constructs, while {{on the other hand}} they are seen as different constructs. Creativity is seen as generation of novel and useful ideas, whereas innovation is seen as the implementation of these ideas. The research streams of innovation and organizational creativity seem to be advancing somewhat separately, although together they could provide many synergy advantages. Thereby, this study addresses three main research gaps. First, as the knowledge and knowing is being increasingly expertized and distributed in organizations, the conceptualization <b>of</b> organizational <b>creativity</b> needs to face that perspective, rather than relying on the individual-creativity view. Thus, the conceptualization <b>of</b> organizational <b>creativity</b> needs clarification, especially as an organizational-level phenomenon (i. e., creativity by an organization). Second, approaches to consciously build organizational creativity to increase the capacity of an organization to demonstrate novelty in its knowledgeable actions are rare. The current creativity techniques are mainly based on individual-creativity views, and they mainly focus on the occasional problem-solving cases among a limited number of individuals, whereas, the development <b>of</b> collective <b>creativity</b> and creativity by the organization lacks approaches. Third, in terms <b>of</b> organizational <b>creativity</b> as a collective phenomenon, the engagement, contributions, and participation of organizational members into activities of common meaning creation are more important than the individualcreativity skills. Therefore, the development approaches to foster creativity as social, emerging, embodied, and collective creativity are needed to complement the current creativity techniques. To address these gaps, the study takes a multiparadigm perspective to face the following three objectives. The first objective {{of this study is to}} clarify and extend the conceptualization <b>of</b> organizational <b>creativity.</b> The second is to study the development <b>of</b> organizational <b>creativity.</b> The third is to explore how an improvisational theater based approach fosters organizational creativity. The study consists of two parts comprising the introductory part (part I) and six publications (part II). Each publication addresses the research questions of the thesis through detailed subquestions. The study makes three main contributions to the research <b>of</b> organizational <b>creativity.</b> First, it contributes toward the conceptualization <b>of</b> organizational <b>creativity</b> by extending the current view <b>of</b> organizational <b>creativity.</b> This study views organizational creativity as a multilevel construct constituting both of individual and collective (group and organizational) creativity. In contrast to current views <b>of</b> organizational <b>creativity,</b> this study bases on organizational (collective) knowledge that is based on and demonstrated through the knowledgeable actions of an organization as a whole. The study defines organizational creativity as an overall ability of an organization to demonstrate novelty in its knowledgeable actions (through what it does and how it does what it does). Second, this study contributes toward the development <b>of</b> organizational <b>creativity</b> as multi-level phenomena, introducing developmental approaches that face two or more of these levels simultaneously. More specifically, the study presents the cross-level approaches to building organizational creativity, by using an approach based in improvisational theater and considering assessment of organizational renewal capability. Third, the study contributes on development <b>of</b> organizational <b>creativity</b> using an improvisational theater based approach as twofold meaning. First, it fosters individual and collective creativity simultaneously and builds space for creativity to occur. Second, it models collective and distributed creativity processes, thereby, contributing to the conceptualization <b>of</b> organizational <b>creativity...</b>|$|R

5|$|After Egypt's central {{government}} collapsed {{at the end}} of the Old Kingdom, the administration could no longer support or stabilize the country's economy. Regional governors could not rely on the king for help in times of crisis, and the ensuing food shortages and political disputes escalated into famines and small-scale civil wars. Yet despite difficult problems, local leaders, owing no tribute to the pharaoh, used their new-found independence to establish a thriving culture in the provinces. Once in control of their own resources, the provinces became economically richer—which was demonstrated by larger and better burials among all social classes. In bursts <b>of</b> <b>creativity,</b> provincial artisans adopted and adapted cultural motifs formerly restricted to the royalty of the Old Kingdom, and scribes developed literary styles that expressed the optimism and originality of the period.|$|E

5|$|The article follows Gibson's {{observations}} of the architecture, phenomenology and culture of Singapore, and the clean, bland and conformist impression the city-state conveys during his stay.

Singapore, Gibson details, is lacking any sense <b>of</b> <b>creativity</b> or authenticity, absent of any indication of its history or underground culture. He finds the government to be pervasive, corporatist and technocratic, and the judicial system rigid and draconian. Singaporeans are characterized as consumerists of insipid taste.
