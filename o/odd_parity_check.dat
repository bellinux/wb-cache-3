5000|$|Memory was {{accessed}} two decimal digits at {{the same}} time (even-odd digit pair for numeric data or one alphameric character for text data). Each decimal digit was 6 bits, composed of an <b>odd</b> <b>parity</b> <b>Check</b> bit, a Flag bit, and four BCD bits for the value of the digit in the following format: C F 8 4 2 1The Flag bit had several uses: ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{memory of}} the IBM 1620 is {{organized}} into 6-bit addressable digits, the usual 8, 4, 2, 1 plus F, used as a flag bit and C, an <b>odd</b> <b>parity</b> <b>check</b> bit. BCD alphamerics are encoded using digit pairs, with the [...] "zone" [...] in the even-addressed digit and the [...] "digit" [...] in the odd-addressed digit, the [...] "zone" [...] being related to the 12, 11, and 0 [...] "zone punches" [...] as in the 1400 series. Input/Output translation hardware converted between the internal digit pairs and the external standard 6-bit BCD codes.|$|E
25|$|The lower 15 bits of each {{memory word}} held AGC {{instructions}} or data, with each word being {{protected by a}} 16th <b>odd</b> <b>parity</b> bit. This bit was set to 1 or 0 by a parity generator circuit so a count of the 1s in each memory word would always produce an <b>odd</b> number. A <b>parity</b> <b>checking</b> circuit tested the parity bit during each memory cycle; if the bit didn't match the expected value, the memory word {{was assumed to be}} corrupted and a parity alarm panel light was illuminated.|$|R
50|$|A normal block ending {{character}} (ETB or ETX) {{is followed}} by a check sum (block check character or BCC). For USASCII, this is a one character longitudinal redundancy check (LRC); for Transcode and EBCDIC, the check sum is a two character cyclic redundancy check(CRC). A data frame may contain an intermediate check sum preceded by an ITB character. This ability to include intermediate check sums in a long data frame allows a considerable improvement of the error detection probability. USASCII characters are also transmitted using <b>odd</b> <b>parity</b> for additional <b>checking.</b>|$|R
50|$|A seventh bit {{is added}} to the {{character}} to indicate <b>parity.</b> <b>Odd</b> <b>parity</b> is used so that the number of stop polarity elements (1) is always <b>odd.</b> The <b>parity</b> bit is <b>checked</b> by the receiver to tell if an error has occurred in the transmission of the character. The return channel will include the RQ signal if an error is detected.|$|R
5000|$|The IBM 1400 {{series are}} character-addressable machines, each {{location}} being six bits labeled B, A, 8, 4, 2 and 1, plus an <b>odd</b> <b>parity</b> <b>check</b> bit (C) and a word mark bit (M). For encoding digits 1 through 9, B and A are zero and the digit value represented by standard 4-bit BCD in bits 8 through 1. For most other characters bits B and A are derived simply from the [...] "12", [...] "11", and [...] "0" [...] "zone punches" [...] in the punched card character code, and bits 8 through 1 from the 1 through 9 punches. A [...] "12 zone" [...] punch set both B and A, an [...] "11 zone" [...] set B, and a [...] "0 zone" [...] (a 0 punch combined with any others) set A. Thus the letter A, which is (12,1) in the punched card format, is encoded (B,A,1). The currency symbol $, (11,8,3) in the punched card, was encoded in memory as (B,8,2,1). This allowed the circuitry to convert between the punched card format {{and the internal}} storage format to be very simple {{with only a few}} special cases. One important special case is digit 0, represented by a lone 0 punch in the card, and (8,2) in core memory.|$|E

3000|$|The {{processing}} time per iteration {{can be reduced}} substantially if some means is employed to eliminate the inter-lane communications associated with performing <b>parity</b> <b>checks.</b> Consider an alternative approach to testing the correctness of code-symbol polarities in which the <b>parity</b> <b>checks</b> for a given block of rows are incorporated within the corresponding message-passing subiterations.

40|$|Recently {{there has}} been {{interest}} {{in the construction of}} small <b>parity</b> <b>check</b> sets for iterative decoding of the Hamming code with the property that each uncorrectable (or stopping) set of size three is the support of a codeword and hence uncorrectable anyway. Here we reformulate and generalise the problem, and improve on this construction. First we show that a <b>parity</b> <b>check</b> collection that corrects all correctable erasure patterns of size m for the r-th order Hamming code (i. e, the Hamming code with codimension r) provides for all codes of codimension $r$ a corresponding ``generic'' <b>parity</b> <b>check</b> collection with this property. This leads naturally to a necessary and sufficient condition on such generic <b>parity</b> <b>check</b> collections. We use this condition to construct a generic <b>parity</b> <b>check</b> collection for codes of codimension r correcting all correctable erasure patterns of size at most m, for all r and m = 3 and r large enough.
