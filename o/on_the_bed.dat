5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{is growing}} {{increasingly}} jealous of Gabe's relationship with Erin. While observing Gabe's room, Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) {{tells him that}} a Chinese virility supplement that Gabe keeps in his room is incredibly potent. Once alone Andy drinks the entire bottle of the supplement, which makes him intoxicated, prompting him to admit his jealousy to Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith). Phyllis volunteers to talk to Erin and find out if she is having sex with Gabe, but as Phyllis is fairly intoxicated herself, her inquiries segue into an explicit account of her sexual experiences with her husband Bob, which mortifies Erin. Andy's intoxication turns into sickness, and he ultimately retreats to Gabe's room and vomits <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b>|$|E
5|$|As good fluids are {{supposed}} to be transferable, the Antoinist dress used during the worship is often placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> of a suffering person to help his recovery; similarly, some faithful put a request on a paper in a box under the platform so that the wish happen, others buy a photo of Antoine at a ceremony to be protected. To prevent negative fluids to enter the temple, several rules were established: for example, those who perform the worship are not allowed to wear jewelry or makeup in the building.|$|E
5|$|Avril {{talked about}} her life and what things were {{important}} to her – she was {{the inspiration for the}} song :-) :-). Matthew began creating the melody and track, and I started working on the lyrics. I remember staying in bed for three days, writing 25 versions of the lyric. I love being in bed and writing lyrics, and having my dog Jet and my kitty Dash <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b> Anyway, we finally finished the lyric, then we completed the demo.|$|E

Maxwell is disturbed first by Jorg (Pemberton), a drunk, flatulent German who climbs into bunk 9D, then by Kath (Hesmondhalgh) and Les (Benton), a couple travelling to their daughter's wedding. Jorg is in Les's bed, but the couple climb into 9A. Australian backpacker Shona (Gunning) enters; she places her bag on bunk 9C then leaves, and Maxwell closes the door. Kath and Les, laughing at Maxwell, begin to undress <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b> Les wakes Jorg, but understanding is limited until Maxwell translates. Jorg switches to 9F and Les climbs into 9D.|$|E
5|$|If {{traditional}} {{practices were}} adhered to, feasting would have continued for two days, while guests {{would have given}} gifts, mainly of money, to the newlyweds. The wedding ceremony would have culminated with the guests entering the bridal chamber, where they would have made various sexual references and innuendos, led by a figure with his face painted black. In Chinese rural tradition, the bride was expected to show the bloodstains <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> sheets from her wedding night to prove that her hymen had been broken during sexual intercourse, {{and that she had}} therefore been a virgin.|$|E

5|$|On Friday 9 November, prostitute Mary Jane Kelly {{was murdered}} in the single room where she lived at 13 Miller's Court, behind 26 Dorset Street, Spitalfields. One of the earlier victims, Chapman, had lived in Dorset Street, and another, Eddowes, was {{reported}} to have slept rough there. Kelly's severely mutilated body was discovered shortly after 10:45am lying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b> The first doctor at the scene, Dr George Bagster Phillips, believed that Kelly was killed by a slash to the throat. After her death, her abdominal cavity was sliced open and all her viscera removed and spread around the room. Her breasts had been cut off, her face mutilated beyond recognition, and her thighs partially cut through to the bone, with some of the muscles removed. Unlike the other victims, she was undressed and wore only a light chemise. Her clothes were folded neatly on a chair, with the exception of some found burnt in the grate. Abberline thought the clothes had been burned by the murderer to provide light, as the room was otherwise only dimly lit by a single candle. Kelly's murder was the most savage, probably because the murderer had more time to commit his atrocities in a private room rather than in the street. Her state of undress and folded clothes have led to suggestions that she undressed herself before lying down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> which would indicate that she was killed by someone she knew, by someone she believed to be a client, or when she was asleep or intoxicated.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, Asmoro {{sees the}} businessman, Adjeng's boyfriend, leaving her apartment, which {{puts him in}} a foul mood.

As Adjeng lies <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> she recalls how her mother's lover raped her and how her mother murdered him. As the phone rings, Adjeng watches the people from her past going about life in a residential complex, smiles, and returns to writing.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} grave, {{and the most}} spectacular set of artefacts, was found near {{the centre of the}} cemetery. Grave 42 was a deep, wide pit in which a high-status individual was buried on top of a wooden bed with iron fittings. The body lying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> was most likely that of a woman of very high-ranking noble descent, possibly royalty, as {{the quantity and quality of}} the jewellery found in the grave is indicative of a woman ranking at the top of Anglo-Saxon society. Such burials are highly unusual; only a dozen are known in the whole of the UK, and the one at Street House is the most northerly known.|$|E

5|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Sophie Muller and features a tearful and distraught Stefani, lying in bed as she begins to sing to the camera. In a white inside-out L.A.M.B. T-shirt, she wanders around her apartment lost and questioning her lover, who is in fact absent from the video. The lyrics describe an argument, which she has with an off-screen lover throughout the video. After lying around her apartment and crying during a bath, she leaves her house at night and travels in a car, as she sits tearfully in the back. The video ends with Stefani rolling <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b>|$|E
5|$|The video focuses {{solely on}} lead singer, Jason Wade, {{as the rest}} of the band members do not appear in the video. The video begins by showing Wade sitting alone on a bed, with {{pictures}} of him and his girlfriend on the wall. He proceeds to walk around the house, while various things in the room he's in begin to explode around him, such as the bed and pictures in the bedroom, and various food and drink items in the kitchen. Near the end things begin going in reverse, and everything that had exploded is put back together. The video ends with Wade sitting back <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> with his girlfriend now lying next to him.|$|E
5|$|Academic {{standards}} and enrollment numbers at the Baltimore City College (B.C.C.) after reaching {{a high of}} near 4,000 boys by the mid-1960s went {{through a period of}} decline first in the late 1960s to mid 1970s, with the rapid opening of newer additional high schools both in the outreaches of the city along with the rapidly expanding suburbs in surrounding Baltimore County. Two in the city system were Northwestern in 1965 and Northern in the following year. Three high schools were completed and opened all at one time in September 1971, with Southwestern, Walbrook and a massive huge complex nearby to City in Clifton Park <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> of the old reservoir off Harford Road, Lake Clifton. The 'A' and 'B' courses were slowly dying out and unfortunately discontinued by 1973, and a single academic track was offered.|$|E

5|$|Five Nights at Freddy's 4 reintroduces removed tools, {{specifically}} {{the doors and}} flashlight, albeit with slightly altered usage. The doors can only be closed when the player is next to them, and will re-open if the player moves away. However, if the player shuts the doors too early, the animatronics will jump scare the player when the door is opened. The flashlight can no-longer run out, but only alerts player {{to the presence of}} animatronics as opposed to warding them away, excluding the miniature Freddies that appear <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b> If the player flashes the flashlight while an animatronic is in the doorway, the player will be jumpscared. There is one new mechanic, where the player must listen for breathing audio. This can determine whether to use the flashlight or close the door.|$|E
5|$|In any event, the {{molluscs}} and scavengers did not consume everything organic. Some of {{the wooden}} objects on the ship and in the debris field have not been consumed, particularly those made of teak, a dense wood {{that seems to have}} resisted the borers. The First Class reception area off the ships Grand Staircase is still remarkably intact and furniture is still visible among the debris on the floor. Although most of the corridors have lost their walls, furniture is still in place in many cabins; in one, a mattress is still <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> with an intact and undamaged dresser behind it. Robert Ballard has suggested that areas within the ship or buried under debris, where scavengers may {{not have been able to}} reach, may still contain human remains. According to Charles Pellegrino, who dived on Titanic in 2001, a finger bone encircled by the partial remains of a wedding ring was found concreted to the bottom of a soup tureen that was retrieved from the debris field. It was returned to the sea bed on the next dive.|$|E
5|$|In most species, the nymphs are herbivores or detritivores, {{feeding on}} algae, diatoms or detritus, {{but in a}} few species, they are predators of chironomid and other small insect larvae and nymphs. Nymphs of Povilla burrow into {{submerged}} wood and {{can be a problem}} for boat owners in Asia. Some are able to shift from one feeding group to another as they grow, thus enabling them to utilise a variety of food resources. They process a great quantity of organic matter as nymphs and transfer a lot of phosphates and nitrates to terrestrial environments when they emerge from the water, thus helping to remove pollutants from aqueous systems. Along with caddisfly larvae and gastropod molluscs, the grazing of mayfly nymphs has {{a significant impact on the}} primary producers, the plants and algae, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> of streams and rivers.|$|E
