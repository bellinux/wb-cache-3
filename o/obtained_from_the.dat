5|$|Data <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{composition}} of soil samples collected on Apollo 15 show that most (about 90%) of the samples from the Apennine Front are brown-glass breccias, and approximately 60–70% <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> mare surface are basalt. Although the basalts seem to vary in their texture, their ages appear to be approximately the same. Most of the samples obtained on the Apennine Front are KREEP (potassium, rare-earth elements, phosphorus) materials, anorthosites, recrystallized norite, or recrystallized breccia.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the term}} lipid is {{sometimes}} {{used as a}} synonym for fats, fats are a subgroup of lipids called triglycerides.

Although humans and other mammals use various biosynthetic pathways both to break down and to synthesize lipids, some essential lipids cannot be made this way and must be <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> diet.|$|E

5|$|By 1910, most glacial {{acetic acid}} was <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> pyroligneous liquor, {{a product of the}} {{distillation}} of wood. The acetic acid was isolated by treatment with milk of lime, and the resulting calcium acetate was then acidified with sulfuric acid to recover acetic acid.

5|$|Chemolithotrophy {{is a type}} of {{metabolism}} {{found in}} prokaryotes where energy is <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> oxidation of inorganic compounds. These organisms can use hydrogen, reduced sulfur compounds (such as sulfide, hydrogen sulfide and thiosulfate), ferrous iron (FeII) or ammonia as sources of reducing power and they gain energy from the oxidation of these compounds with electron acceptors such as oxygen or nitrite. These microbial processes are important in global biogeochemical cycles such as acetogenesis, nitrification and denitrification and are critical for soil fertility.|$|E
