5|$|Following the 1991 Gulf War and the {{subsequent}} dissolution of the Soviet Union, the United States Navy began to decommission and mothball many of the ships it had brought out of its reserve fleet in the drive to attain a 600-ship Navy. At the height of Navy Secretary John F. Lehman's 600-ship Navy plan, nearly 600ships of all types were active within the Navy. This included fifteen aircraft carriers, four battleships and over 100submarines, along with various other types of ships the <b>overall</b> <b>plan</b> specified. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 the Navy sought to return to its traditional, 313-ship composition. While reducing the fleet created under the 600-ship Navy program, {{the decision was made}} to deactivate the four recommissioned Iowa-class battleships and return them to the reserve fleet.|$|E

In March 1939, Hitler demanded {{the return of}} the Free City of Danzig and the Polish Corridor, a strip of land that separated East Prussia from the rest of Germany. The British announced they would {{come to the aid of}} Poland if it was attacked. Hitler, believing the British would not actually take action, ordered an invasion plan should be readied for a target date of September 1939. On 23 May, Hitler described to his generals his <b>overall</b> <b>plan</b> of not only seizing the Polish Corridor but greatly expanding German territory eastward at the expense of Poland and he expected this time they would be met by force.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} week of August 1944, the Second Panzer Army was finally ready to move to thwart the Partisan advance from Bosnia into Serbia, {{originally}} planned as Operation Rose. Renamed Operation Rübezahl (Mountain Spirit), the revamped plan required the 7th and 13th SS Divisions to form the Bosnian phase of the operation, named Operation Hackfleisch (Minced Meat). Hackfleisch aimed to drive out the Partisans occupying the area between the towns of Kladanj, Vlasenica, Sokolac and Olovo, south of the security zone. The <b>overall</b> <b>plan</b> involved columns that were to force the Partisans eastwards into the pincers of the other units, thereby destroying them.|$|E

5|$|Despite the Interior Department's {{rejection}} of the overall Rampart Dam project, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers continued its engineering feasibility study on the project. That plan was completed on June 25, 1971, and it included most of the previous federal documents pertaining to the project, including the electricity market studies published by the Department of the Interior in 1965, the Fish and Wildlife study of 1964, and other studies about the economic feasibility of the project. A detailed description of potential construction methods and the <b>overall</b> <b>plan</b> for the project were included, as were reports about the site's geography and hydrology. In total, the report encompassed two volumes including more than 480 pages. Because the construction season at the site is only five months, the Corps of Engineers projected that several decades {{would be needed to}} build the dam and associated structures.|$|E

The house's third story is separated visually by a stone string course and is topped with a modillioned cornice. From a shallow hipped roof rise brick chimneys that are trimmed and capped with stone. The pavilion pediments have decorative urn-shaped elements. The house's windows are primarily rectangular, double hung, one-over-one panel style, except for a large triple Palladian window, which has stained glass and is situated midway up the house's main staircase, illuminating its lower steps. The house has distinctive quoins, pediments, and classical balustrades of pale gray limestone.|$|E

25|$|After Hitler's {{attack on}} the Soviet Union, both the Polish Government in Exile and the Ukrainian OUN-B {{considered}} the possibility that {{in the event of}} mutually exhaustive attrition warfare between Germany and the Soviet Union, the region would become a scene of conflict between Poles and Ukrainians. The Polish Government in Exile, which wanted the region returned to Poland, planned for a swift armed takeover of the territory as part of its <b>overall</b> <b>plan</b> for a future anti-Nazi uprising. This view was compounded by OUN's prior collaboration with the Nazis, that by 1943 no understanding between the Polish government's Home Army and OUN was possible.|$|E

These plans were approved by the Combined Chiefs of Staff at the Cairo Conference and although other offensives in Burma were scaled back or cancelled, Stilwell's Northern Front offensive with the Chindits' participation survived the cuts. The uncertainty of the plans nevertheless meant that the plans and contingency plans for the use of the Chindits repeatedly changed up to the very start of operations.|$|E
40|$|Abstract It is {{valuable}} in large organization with multiple hierarchical levels {{that the general}} goals are communicated {{at all levels of}} the organization. Organizations usually have an <b>overall</b> business <b>plan,</b> which should serve as a guide and indicate the organization’s direction. Middle managers have an important part in communicating the <b>overall</b> business <b>plan</b> since they are a link between upper management and employees.   The purpose of this study was to examine how middle managers, in their role as a link between upper management and employees, communicate the <b>overall</b> business <b>plan.</b> The study was conducted at the County council in Värmland, which represents a large hierarchical organization. The <b>overall</b> business <b>plan</b> was landstingplanen. The theoretical framework used was primarily theories and previous research in organizational communication, communicative leadership and communication and structure. Eight middle managers were selected through a variety selection. The eight respondents were interviewed to examine in what way they are communicating and establishing the County council's <b>overall</b> business <b>plan.</b>   The results showed that the <b>overall</b> business <b>plan</b> is established and communicated in the different levels of the organization since it is broken down in two steps. The <b>overall</b> business <b>plan</b> functions as a support and gives guidance in how to accomplish the goals that are conveyed. The balanced scorecard that is a part of the <b>overall</b> business <b>plan</b> fills an important role in what middle management choose to priorities and communicate to their employees. However, the results indicated that the general formulation in the <b>overall</b> business <b>plan</b> resulted in a relatively free interpretation among the middle managers. Furthermore, the results showed that the attitudes against the County council’s vision among the respondents were fairly negative. The results also indicated that the middle managers are operating from a communicative leadership in communicating the <b>overall</b> business <b>plan</b> to their employees, but for this to be realized there must be a communicative empowerment.  The results also showed that discrepancy between the upper management and the employees was perceived as large, which may obstruct the middle managers to establish the <b>overall</b> business <b>plan...</b>|$|R
