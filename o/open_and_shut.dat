25|$|The {{disadvantage}} {{of the mechanical}} system {{is the use of}} breaker points to interrupt the low-voltage high-current through the primary winding of the coil; the points are subject to mechanical wear where they ride the cam to <b>open</b> <b>and</b> <b>shut,</b> as well as oxidation and burning at the contact surfaces from the constant sparking. They require regular adjustment to compensate for wear, and the opening of the contact breakers, which is responsible for spark timing, is subject to mechanical variations.|$|E
25|$|In the French comb the {{slivers of}} wool are fed forward by ratchet-operated rollers and a pinned feed grid, the leading {{end of the}} fibres being pushed beyond the nipper jaws which <b>open</b> <b>and</b> <b>shut</b> to receive and hold them, leaving a fringe of fibres {{protruding}} through which the pins of the revolving cylinder comb pass, removing the short fibres or noil and any impurities. These are carried round to the underside and deposited in a box for removal. Whilst the above initial combing is taking place the drawing-off rollers, mounted on a carriage, move towards the nipper jaws and grip the fringe of fibres {{as soon as the}} last row of pins on the comb cylinder has passed through the fringe projecting from the nipper jaws. As the drawing-off rollers grip the projecting fringe, the intersector comb descends, piercing the fringe of fibres, the nipper jaws open and the fibres are given their second combing by the rotation and recession of the drawing-off rollers pulling the fibres through the pins of the intersector comb and the pins of the feed grid. The combed fibres are then conveyed by the leather apron of the drawing-off rollers to the front rollers of the carriage, down a funnel and through the calender rollers, into a can placed directly underneath.|$|E
500|$|A music video, co-directed by Neil Pollock and Jonathan Bekemeier, {{to promote}} the single shows the band playing its {{instruments}} through a distorted fish-eye lens, the camera variously panning horizontally across the performance space and vertically over the individual band members. Keeping {{in the spirit of}} the mimed performance, Francis and bassist Kim Deal <b>open</b> <b>and</b> <b>shut</b> their mouths in time with their prerecorded vocals, yet make no attempt to articulate their lips in synch with the words that they are supposed to be singing. Instead, they simply keep their mouths wide open with blank expressions for the duration of each verse. Francis stated that [...] "Water on the brain" [...] was the theme of the clip.|$|E

2500|$|An {{air-tight}} stove is a {{wood-burning stove}} designed to burn solid fuel, traditionally wood, {{in a controlled}} fashion so as to provide for efficient and controlled fuel use, {{and the benefits of}} stable heating or cooking temperatures. [...] They are made of sheet metal, consisting of a drum-like combustion chamber with airflow openings that can be <b>open</b> <b>and</b> <b>shut,</b> and a chimney of a metre or more length.|$|E
2500|$|Much of Heller's prose in Catch-22 is {{circular}} and repetitive, exemplifying in {{its form}} {{the structure of}} a Catch-22. Circular reasoning is widely used by some characters to justify their actions and opinions. Heller revels in paradox, for example: [...] "The Texan turned out to be good-natured, generous and likable. In three days no one could stand him", and [...] "The case against Clevinger was <b>open</b> <b>and</b> <b>shut.</b> The only thing missing was something to charge him with." [...] This atmosphere of apparently logical irrationality pervades the book.|$|E
2500|$|In 2001 {{the latest}} {{addition}} to the Tyne bridges was completed. This was the Gateshead Millennium Bridge, a foot and cycle bridge, [...] wide and [...] long. The road deck {{is in the form}} of a curve and is supported by a steel arch. To allow ships to pass, the whole structure, both arch and road-deck, rotate on huge bearings at either end so that the road deck is lifted. The bridge can be said to <b>open</b> <b>and</b> <b>shut</b> like a human eye. It is an important {{addition to the}} re-developed quayside area, providing a vital link between the Newcastle and Gateshead quaysides.|$|E

2500|$|To help boats leave (downstream) a lock, the locksman would {{sometimes}} open the paddles {{to create a}} swell, which would help [...] "flush" [...] the boat out of the lock. In one case, a boatsman asked for a back swell, that is, <b>open</b> <b>and</b> <b>shut</b> the paddles {{a few times to}} create some waves, to help him get off the bank where he was stuck. If boats ran aground (from being overloaded) they sometimes asked passing crews to tell the upstream lock to give them an extra heavy swell, which consisted of opening all the paddles on the lock gate, creating a surge that affected the whole pound below.|$|E
2500|$|Robert Englund {{continued}} {{his role as}} Krueger on October 9, 1988, in the television anthology series, Freddy's Nightmares. The show was hosted by Freddy, who did not take direct part {{in most of the}} episodes, but he did show up occasionally to influence the plot of particular episodes. Further, a consistent theme in each episode was characters having disturbing dreams. The series ran for two seasons, 44 episodes, ending March 10, 1990. Although most of the episodes did not feature Freddy taking {{a major role in the}} plot, the pilot episode, [...] "No More Mr. Nice Guy", depicts the events of his trial, and his subsequent death at the hands of the parents of Elm Street after his acquittal. In [...] "No More Mr. Nice Guy", though Freddy's case seems <b>open</b> <b>and</b> <b>shut,</b> a mistrial is declared based on the arresting officer, Lt. Tim Blocker, not reading Krueger his Miranda rights, which is different from the original Nightmare that stated he was released because someone forgot to sign a search warrant in the right place. The episode also reveals that Krueger used an ice cream van to lure children close enough so that he could kidnap and kill them. After the town's parents burn Freddy to death he returns to haunt Blocker in his dreams. Freddy gets his revenge when Blocker is put to sleep at the dentist's office, and Freddy shows up and kills him. The episode [...] "Sister's Keeper" [...] was a [...] "sequel" [...] to this episode, even though it was the seventh episode of the series. The episode follows Krueger as he terrorizes the Blocker twins, the identical twin daughters of Lt. Tim Blocker, and frames one sister for the other's murder. Season two's [...] "It's My Party And You'll Die If I Want You To" [...] featured Freddy attacking a high school prom date who stood him up twenty years earlier. He got his revenge with his desire being fulfilled in the process.|$|E
