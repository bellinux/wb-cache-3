40|$|Analytical {{methods for}} RCRA listed {{elements}} on Portland cement type waste have been employed using both microwave and <b>open</b> <b>hot</b> plate digestions with subsequent analysis by {{inductively coupled plasma}} atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-AES), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), graphite furnace atomic absorption (GFAA) and cold vapor atomic absorption and fluorescence (CVAA/CVAFS). Four different digestion procedures were evaluated including an <b>open</b> <b>hot</b> plate nitric acid digestion, EPA SW- 846 Method 3051, and 2 methods using modifications to Method 3051. The <b>open</b> <b>hot</b> plate and the modified Method 3051, which used aqua regia for dissolution, were the only methods which resulted in acceptable data quality for all 14 RCRA-listed elements. Results for the nitric acid <b>open</b> <b>hot</b> plate digestion were used to qualify the analytical methods for TRU waste characterization, and resulted in a 99 % passing score. Direct chemical analysis of TRU waste is being developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory {{in an attempt to}} circumvent the problems associated with strong acid digestion methods. Technology development includes laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS), dc arc CID atomic emission spectroscopy (DC-AES), and glow discharge mass spectrometry (GDMS). Analytical methods using the Portland cement matrix are currently being developed for each of the listed techniques. Upon completion of the development stage, blind samples will be distributed to each of the technology developers for RCRA metals characterization...|$|R

40|$|How to {{identify}} influential nodes {{is still an}} <b>open</b> <b>hot</b> issue in complex networks. Lots of methods (e. g., degree centrality, betweenness centrality or K-shell) {{are based on the}} topology of a network. These methods work well in scale-free networks. In order to design a universal method suitable for networks with different topologies, this paper proposes a Multiple Attribute Fusion (MAF) method through combining topological attributes and diffused attributes of a node together. Two fusion strategies have been proposed in this paper. One is based on the attribute union (FU), and the other is based on the attribute ranking (FR). Simulation results in the Susceptible-Infected (SI) model show that our proposed method gains more information propagation efficiency in different types of networks. © 2014 Springer International Publishing...|$|R
40|$|The distant {{planetary}} magnetotails of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune {{are assumed}} to be partially <b>open,</b> <b>hot,</b> long plasma cavities generally in pressure equilibrium with the solar wind. Most of the magnetosheath magnetic field lines drape around the magnetotails. Conservation of momentum density, magnetic field, plasma density, and energy density fluxes are invoked at the tail boundaries to determine the shape of the magnetotails and the variations of plasma and magnetic field characteristics with distance down the magnetotail. Voyager observations are used to initialize calculations in the near-planet portions of each magnetotail. Estimates of magnetotail cross sections, magnetic field strengths, and plasma densities are described as a function of downstream distance. The model accurately predicts properties of the Jovian magnetotail {{at least as far as}} Saturn's orbit...|$|R

30|$|The Hot Air Balloon {{through the}} {{properties}} of its components (e.g. {{the volume of the}} balloon providing buoyancy through the air it displaces; and the envelope, basket and its contents providing weight) experiences an interaction between the Buoyancy and Weight. [This puts the focus on the Principle.] When Weight is greater than Buoyancy the Balloon falls, when Weight is less the Balloon rises, and when equal the Balloon floats. To decrease the Weight the burner heats the air which expands and leaves the balloon: to increase the Weight the vent is <b>opened,</b> <b>hot</b> air leaves the balloon and cooler/denser air enters from the open base of the Balloon. [This puts the focus on the Process.] By use of the burner and the vent, the pilot can control the altitude of the Balloon.|$|R

40|$|The {{two-dimensional}} Hubbard {{model is}} studied within the composite operator method (COM) with the self-energy computed in the self-consistent Born approximation (SCBA). The COM describes interacting electrons {{in terms of}} the new elementary excitations that appear in the system owing to strong correlations; residual interactions among these excitations are treated within the SCBA. On decreasing the doping (from the overdoped to underdoped region), anomalous features develop in the spectral function A(k,ω), the Fermi surface, the momentum distribution function n(k), the dispersion, and the density of states N(ω) in the intermediate-coupling regime (U= 8) at low temperatures (T= 0. 01 – 0. 02). At high doping (n= 0. 7), the system resembles an ordinary weakly interacting metal. At low doping (n= 0. 92), a pseudogap <b>opens,</b> <b>hot</b> and cold spots appear, and non-Fermi-liquid features develop. This behavior, together with the presence of kinks in the calculated electronic dispersion, is in agreement with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy data for high-Tc cuprates superconductors...|$|R
