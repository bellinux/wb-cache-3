5|$|Although {{the usual}} natural numbers satisfy the axioms of PA, {{there are other}} models as well (called {{non-standard}} models); the compactness theorem implies {{that the existence of}} nonstandard elements cannot be excluded in first-order logic. The upward Löwenheim–Skolem theorem shows that there are nonstandard models of PA of all infinite cardinalities. This is not the case for the original (second-order) Peano axioms, which have only <b>one</b> <b>model,</b> up to isomorphism. This illustrates one way the first-order system PA is weaker than the second-order Peano axioms.|$|E

5|$|In a 2003 {{review of}} the literature, Rowan et al. {{proposed}} <b>one</b> <b>model</b> for how LTP might be affected in AD. AD appears to result, at least in part, from misprocessing of amyloid precursor protein (APP). The result of this abnormal processing is the accumulation of fragments of this protein, called amyloid β (Aβ). Aβ exists in both soluble and fibrillar forms. Misprocessing of APP results in the accumulation of soluble Aβ that, according to Rowan's hypothesis, impairs hippocampal LTP and {{may lead to the}} cognitive decline seen early in AD.|$|E
5|$|Due to its sudden {{development}} and project track into southwest Florida, the National Hurricane Center issued {{a tropical storm}} warning and hours later a hurricane warning from the Dry Tortugas to Marathon in the Florida Keys and along the southwestern coastline northward to Fort Myers. A hurricane watch was also issued from Marathon to Jupiter Inlet. At {{the time of the}} issuance of the hurricane warning, Alberto had been moving steadily northeastward; extrapolating its motion indicated a landfall on Key West within 12hours and a mainland landfall at Key Largo within 24hours. Additionally, most computer models predicted Alberto to continue northeastward across south Florida. Only <b>one</b> <b>model,</b> not available until later, suggested a weakness in steering currents that would prevent a Florida landfall.|$|E

Most were given improvements to their engines to run faster, while <b>one</b> <b>model</b> had an extra steering wheel {{on the back of the}} cabin so a hidden stuntman could drive while Carey Lowell was in the front and another received extra suspension on its back so it could lift its front wheels. Although a rig was constructed to help a rig tilt onto its side, it was not necessary as Julienne was able to pull off the stunt without the aid of camera trickery.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Jeanne {{steadily}} intensified as {{it turned}} eastward, developing a 52mi (83km) wide eye. A motion to the southeast began on September 22, and {{around the same time}} it reached winds of 100mph (160km/h), making it a Category2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale. At the same time, the National Hurricane Center forecast to turn westward and later northwestward, with its projected five-day track within 60mi (100km) of Cape Fear, North Carolina. The westernmost outlier during <b>one</b> <b>model</b> run was the NOGAPS model, which predicted a continued westward motion across central Florida. The official forecast changed early on September 23 to bring Jeanne across northeastern Florida, though initially the cyclone was predicted to turn northeastward and hit South Carolina as a hurricane.|$|E
5|$|In {{the twentieth}} century, Ian Ramsey {{developed}} {{the theory of}} analogy, a development later cited in numerous works by Alister McGrath. He argued that various models of God are provided in religious writings that interact with each other: a range of analogies for salvation {{and the nature of}} God. Ramsey proposed that the models used modify and qualify each other, defining the limits of other analogies. As a result, no one analogy on its own is sufficient, but the combination of every analogy presented in Scripture gives a full and consistent depiction of God. The use of other analogies may then be used to determine if any <b>one</b> <b>model</b> of God is abused or improperly applied.|$|E
5|$|<b>One</b> <b>model</b> for the {{formation}} of this category of supernova is a close binary star system. The progenitor binary system consists of main sequence stars, with the primary possessing more mass than the secondary. Being greater in mass, the primary is the first of the pair to evolve onto the asymptotic giant branch, where the star's envelope expands considerably. If the two stars share a common envelope then the system can lose significant amounts of mass, reducing the angular momentum, orbital radius and period. After the primary has degenerated into a white dwarf, the secondary star later evolves into a red giant and the stage is set for mass accretion onto the primary. During this final shared-envelope phase, the two stars spiral in closer together as angular momentum is lost. The resulting orbit can have a period as brief as a few hours. If the accretion continues long enough, the white dwarf may eventually approach the Chandrasekhar limit.|$|E

5|$|Visual effects {{producer}} James Tichenor {{claimed that}} visual effects work better when not highlighted, {{and that a}} major part of effective visual effects are the actors' reactions to nonexistent things. Replicator models were used to give the actors an idea at what they were looking and to match their eyelines. <b>One</b> <b>model</b> was mounted on a plexiglass rod and shown on-screen, giving the impression of an organic Replicator hologram. The computer-generated Replicators on board the submarine were tracked with small lights, some of which post-production left in for good looks. The reflections of the green screen on the floor aboard Thor's ship ("green spill", usually an undesired side effect) were used to key selective patches for the reflection of the big spaceship screen.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} for Thunderbird 6 commenced on 1 May 1967, {{by which}} time Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons had already entered production. One of the Century 21 production units was transferred from Captain Scarlet to the second Thunderbirds film and shooting was completed in four months alongside that of the new television series. Special effects director Derek Meddings constructed the Skyship <b>One</b> <b>model</b> and supervised the creation of scale replicas of destinations explored in the film, such as the Great Sphinx of Giza, the Egyptian Pyramids and the Grand Canyon. The Swiss Alps shots which frame a scene set inside the fictional Whistle Stop Inn called for the FAB1 model to skate across ice, while scale figures of Alan and Tin-Tin follow the Rolls-Royce on skis. The length of movement required necessitated {{the construction of a}} special effects set that was between 40 and 50feet (12 and 15m) wide (the largest used for the film), filled with salt to simulate the snow-capped Swiss mountains. The film was also shot in parallel with Joe 90, as evidenced by special effects footage of the destruction of the Dover Missile Complex re-appearing in the pilot episode of that series, and a brief appearance of Sam Loover's car during the evacuation of the Complex.|$|E
