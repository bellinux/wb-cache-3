5|$|In {{addition}} to the instruments, the term taiko also refers to the performance itself, and commonly to one style called kumi-daiko, or ensemble-style playing (as opposed to festival performances, rituals, or theatrical use of the drums). Kumi-daiko was developed by Daihachi Oguchi in 1951. He is considered a master performer and helped transform taiko performance from its roots in traditional settings in festivals and shrines. Oguchi was trained as a jazz musician in Nagano, and at one point, a relative gave him an <b>old</b> <b>piece</b> of written taiko music. Unable to read the traditional and esoteric notation, Oguchi found help to transcribe the piece, and on his own added rhythms and transformed the work to accommodate multiple taiko players on different-sized instruments. Each instrument served a specific purpose that established present-day conventions in kumi-daiko performance.|$|E

Lynnwood Farnam, noted concert organist {{of the early}} 20th century, visited the church on November 27, 1919, and wrote {{in one of his}} notebooks that the organ was a fine <b>old</b> <b>piece</b> in very bad condition, located west gallery, had tracker action, and electric blowing.|$|E
25|$|MD 665 was {{originally}} assigned to Forest Drive. The road existed as a county highway between MD 387 and Bay Ridge Avenue, {{which was then}} designated MD 181, by 1939. This highway was extended west to MD 2 (now MD 393) by 1946. MD 665 {{was assigned to the}} highway between MD 2 and MD 181 in 1950. MD 665 was routed along Chinquapin Round Road west of its rakish intersection with MD 387 and Neck Road east of MD 387. The whole highway was named Forest Drive in 1955, the same year the state highway was extended west to the present alignment of MD 2. The eastern end of MD 665 was relocated in 1964 to the current eastern end of Forest Drive at Bay Ridge Avenue and Hillsmere Drive. The old alignment along Forest Hills Avenue remained in the state highway system until 1972. MD 665 was relocated at its intersection with MD 387 to make the intersection less oblique in 1968. An <b>old</b> <b>piece</b> of Forest Drive in the southeast quadrant of the intersection is MD 788A (Old Forest Drive).|$|E

500|$|Revolution Software's {{point and}} click {{adventure}} game [...] was first released in 1996. While investigating a murder, protagonist and player character George Stobbart finds himself uncovering a dark mystery regarding the Knights Templar. A medieval manuscript which he obtained {{during the investigation}} leads him to a castle located in Lochmarne, Ireland. As he cannot enter the castle through the main entrance door, he climbs a haystack, which stops short {{of the top of}} the wall. He puts a sewer key which he obtained {{at the beginning of the}} game in a crack in the wall, which forms a step, allowing him to climb over the wall. Inside the castle, an entrance to an underground dig is located. A tied-up goat is sitting near the entrance; however, the rope to which it is tied is long enough to allow it to prevent George from reaching the entrance by butting him. An <b>old</b> <b>piece</b> of farming machinery is located at the left side of the screen, but George is unable to interact with it, as the goat continues to butt him. George must allow the goat to butt him when trying to reach the entrance, but while the goat is returning to its original position, the player must click on the farming machinery, which causes George to quickly jump up and run to the machinery and slightly reposition it. When returned to its original position, the goat again charges and butts George, but while doing so, gets its rope entangled with the machinery, due to its repositioning. This allows George to move freely and enter the dig.|$|E

2500|$|Elastic's Creative Director Patrick Clair [...] "came up {{with the}} idea of making a red world that was {{revealed}} by liquid." [...] Simulating the CG liquid, which was meant to be an ambiguous reference to poison and blood that behaved like [...] "something in between liquid chocolate and tar", was difficult, with Clair saying [...] "It's hard to make an algorithm act [...] "insidious"". CG Lead Andrew Romatz elaborated that [...] "Developing the right consistency and behavior of the fluids was definitely a tricky process. Getting the scale to feel right was something that we had to play with quite a bit in simulation and also in lighting and texturing. Patrick wanted the sculptures we were forming to feel like miniatures, so we did a lot of experimenting with scene scale and with camera settings, simulating depth of field to achieve that look." [...] Fluids Lead Miguel A. Salek stated that [...] "Each shot required custom flow maps to be painted on the sculptures, along with small attraction fields and thousands of tiny adjustments to achieve the shapes and behavior Patrick was looking for. In the end I simulated hundreds of tests and thousands of frames of fluids to achieve just the right balance for each shot." [...] Due to time constraints, references to Murdock's boxing history such as a punching bag and boxing ring were cut from the final sequence. The final sequence was animated to a temp track—"an <b>old</b> <b>piece</b> of 90s trip hop"—before John Paesano's music for the sequence was completed.|$|E
