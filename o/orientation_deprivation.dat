40|$|In {{the visual}} system, {{the methods used}} {{traditionally}} to induce plasticity cause experience-dependent plasticity without damage {{to any of the}} supporting neural system. For example, mononcular deprivation in the cat, where an eye lid is sutured closed (Wiesel & Hubel 1965), or <b>orientation</b> <b>deprivation</b> in the cat, where the view of the world is restricted to a striped environment (Sengpiel et al. 1999), alter the range of visual experience without damage to the nervous system. Both methods produce profound plasticity within a critical period of development. As mentioned in § 1, in the rat and monkey somatosensory system, the methods used traditionally to induce plasticity lead to direct and indirect damage to the peripheral and central nervous system. For example, peripheral nerve transection or dorsal column lesions are used t...|$|E
40|$|Background: Most chronic {{diseases}} are {{strongly associated with}} four modifiable behaviours: smoking, alcohol consumption, low fruit and vegetable consumption and physical inactivity. When established early in life, these lifestyle factors could persist in adulthood and predict the incidence of {{chronic diseases}}. Little is known about how these behaviours cluster together, and what factors are associated with their prevalence and clustering in individuals. The objective {{of this study was}} to ascertain the association between sociodemographic and personal factors and clustering of multiple health-risk behaviours in young people in the city of Brighton and Hove (population, 274, 000) in Southeast England. Methods: Data from the Brighton and Hove Safe and Well at School Surveys (2011 - 2014) were analysed to examine the clustering of these behaviours in Year 10 and 11 pupils (n= 10, 099; aged 14 - 16 year). The results were weighted and studied in the context of sociodemographic/personal characteristics: gender, ethnicity, sexual <b>orientation,</b> <b>deprivation,</b> school year, feeling safe at school, enjoying school, been bullied at school, health problems, family problems, feeling happy, feeling anxious and feeling lonely. Results: The majority (97...|$|E
40|$|No {{one factor}} {{describes}} Trump’s supporters. But {{an array of}} factors – many of them reflecting five major social psychological phenomena can help to account for this extraordinary political event: authoritarianism, social dominance <b>orientation,</b> prejudice, relative <b>deprivation,</b> and intergroup contact. Research on the topic demonstrates that these theories and concepts of social psychology prove centrally important in helping to understand this unexpected event. This paper describes the supporting data for this statement and demonstrates the close parallels between these American results and those of research on far-right European supporters...|$|R
