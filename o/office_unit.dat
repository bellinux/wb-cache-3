50|$|The new {{franchise}} holder, Meridian Broadcasting, {{originally had}} plans to base itself in an <b>office</b> <b>unit</b> (which it did a little over 10 years later), as its operation required only presentation and play out facilities with a small studio for local news. They {{had no plans to}} make programmes themselves and would therefore have no use for a studio facility as large as the TVS base in Southampton. This would have left TVS with two studio complexes, the modern studios in Maidstone being their choice for a base as an independent production company. However, following TVS's franchise loss, the two companies negotiated the takeover of the studios by Meridian, ending in Meridian's purchase of the Northam studio complex. This also preserved a number of jobs originally not planned by Meridian. However, it still meant huge job losses: 100 of TVS's original workforce of 760 continued to work for Meridian, the others mainly working as freelances, many for independent companies.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this paper}} is to explore lean {{retrofit}} strategies for transparent envelope of existing Italian office buildings, to improve their performance and to ensure low energy use and a good thermal and visual comfort. Solar and light control is necessary to prevent overheating in office buildings those generally present high internal loads.

A sensitivity analysis was assessed to evaluate the <b>office</b> <b>unit</b> primary energy use under different retrofit solution, weather conditions and window to wall ratio. A conventional existing <b>office</b> <b>unit</b> was modeled in EnergyPlus and LBNL Radiance to assess heating, cooling and lighting energy demand coupled with visual comfort parameters.

40|$|Metal mesh grids and {{perforated}} screens {{are used}} in new and renovated buildings as an external second skin for the building envelope; to enhance architecture design, to filter daylight and to reduce solar gains. Their effectiveness as shading devices depends on their geometry, texture and application. In {{the first part of}} the paper six types of shadings with similar transparencies, depending on geometry and openness factor of metal mesh grid and perforated screen, were investigated. Integrating sphere measurements were collected to obtain spectral optical properties of the shading devices. The optical properties were measured for incidence angles between normal and 60 °with a step of 15 °. The data collected were integrated to obtain visible and solar transmittance values in accordance with ISO 9050. In the second part of the paper a parametric study on spacing and thread dimension of metal mesh grids was done using Window 6. 2 models to evaluate their shading potential, defining annual different shading profiles depending on shading geometry, latitude and orientation. A conventional <b>office</b> <b>unit</b> with a curtain wall façade with a metal mesh grid shading system was modeled in TRNSYS to evaluate the solar gain profiles and their effects on the energy balance of the <b>office</b> <b>unit,</b> under different weather conditions...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the potential of}} a two-order spatiotemporal autoregressive model with a Bayesian heteroskedasticity robust procedure in modeling strata-titled Singapore <b>office</b> <b>unit</b> transaction prices and in constructing transaction-based disaggregate office price indexes. The model reduces the problems caused by the infrequent trading of individual commercial properties. However, for those office properties that are located outside the CBD and also for those less frequently transacted, {{the power of the}} model in capturing these particular office buildings' price dynamics is limited. The significant differences of the office prices across the various office buildings and submarkets show that the model can capture the variation in office prices and track the timing of capital gains and losses that investors may accrue on spatially distributed office properties more accurately than hedonic or weighted least squares estimates.

40|$|Abstract: This study {{investigated}} whether {{sick building syndrome}} (SBS) complaints among office workers {{were associated with the}} indoor air quality. With informed consent, 417 employees in 87 office rooms of eight high-rise buildings completed a self-reported questionnaire for symptoms experienced at work during the past month. Carbon dioxide (CO 2), temperature, humidity and total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs) in each office were simultaneously measured for eight office hours using portable monitors. Time-averaged workday difference between the indoor and the outdoor CO 2 concentrations (dCO 2) was calculated as a surrogate measure of ventilation efficiency for each <b>office</b> <b>unit.</b> The prevalence rates of SBS were 22. 5 % for eye syndrome, 15. 3 % for upper respiratory and 25. 4 % for non-specific syndromes.

Metal mesh are used in new and renovated buildings, especially in office building, as an external second envelope skin to enhance architecture design, to manage daylight levels and to control solar gains. The aim is the optimization of their position, compared to the façade raising plane, enhancing the metal mesh systems energy performance, increasing the comfort requirements and reducing the amount of used material to minimize costs. In order to evaluate their performances (mesh spacing and orientation) an estimation of the primary energy consumption for heating, cooling, lighting and daylight comfort has been carried out.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the Chicago CBD office market, an {{important}} market at the local, regional, national and international levels. The {{purpose of this study}} is to develop a hedonic regression model that explains the variation in office rent per square foot. Five functional forms (linear, reciprocal, logarithmic, semi-log and log-linear) of the model are considered. A generally log-linear model is determined to be the best model based on a series of Box-Cox/Box-Tidwell type transformations and likelihood ratio tests. The regression results reveal that the model has very high explanatory power. The methodology of this study differs substantially from that of previous studies on this topic. Perhaps most importantly, the unit of analysis is the <b>office</b> <b>unit</b> rather than the building. This choice suggested the use of specific lease terms for actual transactions and location of the unit within the building as new variables. Finally, the modeling of location of the building within the CBD was found to be a critical step. Copyright American Real Estate and Urban Economics Association. ...|$|E
