5|$|Theorists {{also try}} to {{generate}} or modify models {{to take into account}} new data. In the case of an inconsistency between the data and model's results, the general tendency is to try to make minimal modifications to the model so that it produces results that fit the data.

5|$|A simple rule {{of thumb}} is that for {{high-pressure}} areas, where generally air flows from the center outward, the coriolis force given by the earth's rotation to the air circulation is in the opposite direction of earth's apparent rotation if viewed from above the hemisphere's pole. So, both the earth and winds around a low-pressure area rotate counter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere, and clockwise in the southern. The opposite to these two cases occurs {{in the case of a}} high. These results derive from the Coriolis effect; that article explains in detail the physics, and provides an animation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> to aid understanding.|$|E

5|$|Of {{the many}} studies on behavior-based early {{intervention}} programs, most are case reports {{of up to}} five participants and typically examine a few problem behaviors such as self-injury, aggression, noncompliance, stereotypies, or spontaneous language; unintended side effects are largely ignored. Despite the popularity of social skills training, its effectiveness is not firmly established. A randomized controlled study <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> for training parents in problem behaviors in their children with AS showed that parents attending a one-day workshop or six individual lessons reported fewer behavioral problems, while parents receiving the individual lessons reported less intense behavioral problems in their AS children. Vocational training is important to teach job interview etiquette and workplace behavior to older children and adults with AS, and organization software and personal data assistants can improve the work and life management of people with AS.|$|E
5|$|The second {{argument}} that Fodor provides {{in favour of}} representational realism involves the processes of thought. This argument touches on {{the relation between the}} representational theory of mind and models of its architecture. If the sentences of Mentalese require unique processes of elaboration then they require a computational mechanism of a certain type. The syntactic notion of mental representations {{goes hand in hand with}} the idea that mental processes are calculations which act only on the form of the symbols which they elaborate. And this is the computational theory of the mind. Consequently, the defence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> of architecture based on classic artificial intelligence passes inevitably through a defence of the reality of mental representations.|$|E

INTRODUCflON Simulations of neural network models on digital computers perform various computations by applying linear or nonlinear functions, defined in a program, to weighted sums of integer or real numbers retrieved and stored by array reference. The numerical values are model dependent parameters like time averaged spiking frequency (activation), synaptic efficacy (weight), the error in error back propagation models, and computational temperature in thermodynamic models.
