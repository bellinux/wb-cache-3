40|$|This study {{owes its}} {{inception}} to {{the wisdom and}} experience of {{the staff of the}} Northeast Fisheries Science Center who, after several decades of surveys in the New York Bight, recognized a unique opportunity to capitalize on the decision to stop ocean dumping of sewage sludge and designed an innovative field study to evaluate effects on living marine resources and their habitats. For decades ocean dumping was viewed as a cheap and effective means for disposal of wastes generated by urbanized coastal areas. Even after the 12 -mile site was closed, sewage sludge continued to be dumped at Deepwater Dumpsite 106. The 6 -mile site off the NewJersey coast is still used as a dumpsite for dredged material from New York Harbor areas. Discussions continue on the propriety of using the deep <b>ocean</b> spaces for <b>disposal</b> of a variety of material including low level radioactive wastes.

5000|$|Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 (MPRSA) or Ocean Dumping Act is one {{of several}} key {{environmental}} laws passed by the US Congress in 1972. The Act has two essential aims: to regulate intentional <b>ocean</b> <b>disposal</b> of materials, and to authorize any related research. While the MPRSA regulates the ocean dumping of waste and provides for a research program on ocean dumping, it also provides for the designation and regulation of marine sanctuaries. The act regulates the ocean dumping of all material beyond the territorial limit (3 mi from shore) and prevents or strictly limits dumping material that [...] "would adversely affect human health, welfare, or amenities, or the marine environment, ecological systems, or economic potentialities”. The MPRSA authorized the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to regulate ocean dumping of materials including, but not limited to, industrial waste, sewage sludge, biological agents, radioactive agents, NBC (nuclear, biological, and chemical), garbage, chemicals, and biological and laboratory, as well as other wastes, into the territorial waters of the United States through a permit program. The EPA can issue permits for dumping of materials other than dredge spoils if the agency determines, through a full public notice and process, that the discharge will not unreasonably degrade or endanger human health or welfare or the marine environment. The law also has provisions related to creating marine sanctuaries, conducting <b>ocean</b> <b>disposal</b> research and monitoring coastal water quality.|$|E

50|$|Although {{disposal}} or reuse occurs after treatment, it must {{be considered}} first. Since disposal or reuse are the objectives of wastewater treatment, disposal or reuse options are the basis for treatment decisions. Acceptable impurity concentrations may vary {{with the type of}} use or location of disposal. Transportation costs often make acceptable impurity concentrations dependent upon location of disposal, but expensive treatment requirements may encourage selection of a disposal location on the basis of impurity concentrations. <b>Ocean</b> <b>disposal</b> is subject to international treaty requirements. International treaties may also regulate disposal into rivers crossing international borders. Water bodies entirely within the jurisdiction of a single nation may be subject to regulations of multiple local governments.

25|$|<b>Ocean</b> floor <b>disposal</b> of {{radioactive}} waste {{has been suggested}} by the finding that deep waters in the North Atlantic Ocean do not present an exchange with shallow waters for about 140 years based on oxygen content data recorded {{over a period of}} 25 years.

40|$|The {{application}} of remote sensing to detection and monitoring of <b>ocean</b> waste <b>disposal</b> in the New York Bight is discussed. Attention {{is focused on}} the two major pollutants in this area [...] sewage sludge and iron-acid waste [...] and on detecting and identifying these pollutants. The emphasis is on the use of LANDSAT multispectral data in identifying these pollutants and distinguishing them from other substances. The analysis technique applied to the LANDSAT data is the eigenvector. This approach proved to be quite successful in detecting iron-acid waste of the coast of Delaware and is applied here with relatively minor modifications. The results of the New York Bight work are compared to the Delaware results.

50|$|In 1977, Congress {{amended the}} Act {{to require that}} dumping of {{municipal}} sewage sludge or industrial wastes, which unreasonably degrade the environment, to cease by December 1981. Because that deadline was not achieved, amendments were passed in 1988 that extended the deadline to December 1991. In 1986 amendments, Congress directed that <b>ocean</b> <b>disposal</b> of all wastes end at the traditional 12-mile site off the New York/New Jersey coast and that they be {{moved to a new}} site 106 miles offshore. Congress amended the Act again in 1992, giving permission to states to adopt ocean dumping standards more stringent than federal standards and to require that permits conform with long-term management plans for designated dumpsites. This amendment was put into place to ensure that permitted activities are consistent with expected uses of the site.|$|E

40|$|Clostridium perfringens, {{a marker}} of {{domestic}} sewage contamination, was enumerated in sediment samples obtained from {{the vicinity of the}} 106 -Mile Site 1 month and 1 year after cessation of sewage disposal at this site. C. perfringens counts in sediments collected at the disposal site and from stations 26 nautical miles (ca. 48 km) and 50 nautical miles (ca. 92 km) to the southwest of the site were, in general, more than 10 -fold higher than counts from an uncontaminated reference site. C. perfringens counts at the disposal site were not significantly different between 1992 and 1993, suggesting that sewage sludge had remained in the benthic environment at this site. At stations where C. perfringens counts were elevated (i. e., stations other than the reference station), counts were generally higher in the top 1 cm and decreased down to 5 cm. In some cases, C. perfringens counts in the bottom 4 or 5 cm showed a trend of higher counts in 1993 than in 1992, suggesting bioturbation.

40|$|There are {{different}} {{options for the}} brine disposal from seawater desalination plants, but <b>ocean</b> brine <b>disposal</b> is considered the least expensive one. Discharging strategies for negatively buoyant effluents (BLENINGER et al., 2006) has to be optimized in the design phase {{in order to meet}} the mandatory ambient standards. During the exploitation phase, it is becoming usual to have in place an alarm system to check the compliance of the ambient standards. An innovative approach is to proactively alert the plant managers before the ambient standards are exceeded to avoid damaging protected communities such as coral reefs or sea grass meadows. In this context the ASDECO project (Automated System for Desalination Dilution Control) was created.

40|$|Concentrate stream {{control is}} of the most {{prevalent}} problems with brackish water desalination. Aside from a few communities located next to the ocean, the rest of country does not have {{direct access to the}} <b>ocean</b> for <b>disposal</b> of the concentrate stream. Thus conventional methods for concentrate management of inland water desalination are commonly designed to dispose of the concentrate. However recent research has shown {{that it is possible to}} precipitate and recover metals and nutrients (salts) from concentrate using chemical and biological processes. The recovery of salts could provide a substantial increase in revenue, offsetting the cost of inland desalination, ideal for small developing communities. For example, lime pellets produced from chemical precipitation processes could be used as construction materials, animal feed supplements, and soil stabilization. Furthermore precipitated metals could also reduce the need for invasive mining techniques, reducing the environmental footprint while creating revenue for local communities. Therefore it is vital to develop a protocol for addressing the issue of salt recovery from the concentrate stream of inland desalination and find appropriate uses through the use of emerging technologies. This presentation will focus on discussing the various salt recovery technologies, recoverable products and potential markets for these products. It is important to note that the goal is to extract salts; additional water may not be recovered during processes discussed in this presentation...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the conference was to review the status of our {{capability}} to predict the environmental effects of the disposal of digested sewage sludge in the ocean {{off the coast of}} Southern California. At present, the <b>ocean</b> <b>disposal</b> of sewage sludge is prohibited by State and Federal regulations. <b>Ocean</b> <b>disposal</b> of sludge, however, is a complex of many alternative combinations of what, where and how; and the environmental consequences of all such combinations have not yet been determined. There is, in fact, some evidence that at least one environmentally sound mode of sludge disposal in the ocean off the Southern California coast may exist. This is the trapping of sludge in the sediments of deep, nearshore ocean basins. such as the Santa Monica Basin. Details of this method are given in Section 3. 3. p. 12. It is the philosophy of the Environmental Quality Laboratory to study and evaluate policy alternatives but not to be an advocate of one alternative or another. Some of the policies studied may be contrary to existing laws or regulations, but it is believed that there is a better chance for improvement in the laws or regulations if alternatives currently outside them are also studied. The conference was sponsored by the Environmental Quality Laboratory in the belief that sufficient information is now available to begin making reasonable estimates of the environmental consequences of existing or alternative <b>ocean</b> <b>disposal</b> methods in order to compare them to land-based disposal methods.

Using expected value-variance analysis, the study looks at the effects on the optimal disposal strategy of uncertainty associated with waste-management cost and the community's risk preferences. The results indicate that, based on available cost data, the optimal strategy of a moderately risk-averse decision maker is to manage sludge through land-based facilities. These results hold {{over a wide range}} of risk-aversion parameters and even at low levels of cost uncertainty.

40|$|We used a {{comparative}} approach {{to investigate the}} impact of the disposal of gold mine tailings into the ocean near the Lihir mine (Niolam Island, Papua New Guinea).

We also found relatively high trace metal concentrations in lower trophic level groups, especially zooplankton, near the mine discharge, but few differences in tissue concentrations of micronekton, bait-fish and pelagic fish between the two regions. Biomagnification of some trace metals by micronekton, and of mercury by fish was evident in both regions. We conclude that <b>ocean</b> mine waste <b>disposal</b> at Niolam Island has a local impact on the smaller and less mobile pelagic communities in terms of trace metal concentrations, but has little effect on the abundance and biodiversity of the local food web.
