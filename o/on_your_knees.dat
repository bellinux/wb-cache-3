It became Blue Öyster Cult's most popular album, eventually selling over 2 million copies.|$|E

25|$|The Settlement of the Americas coastal {{migration}} hypothesis {{suggests that}} the first North Americans may have been here as the oldest human remains known from Alaska or Canada are from <b>On</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Knees</b> Cave. Anthropologists have found striking parallels between the myths, rituals, and dwelling types of the Koryaks—inhabitants of the Kamchatka Peninsula—and those of the Native peoples of America's Northwest Coast. At this time the island was {{twice as large as}} today. There is strong genetic evidence for these early people having an origin there. The Koryaks were a matrilinear seafaring people hunting whales and other marine mammals. Their god was Kujkynnjaku, the Raven. Most of the Raven myths {{are similar to those of}} the Koryak.|$|E
500|$|The {{perceived}} lack {{of remorse}} by Waddle, plus {{reports in the}} Japanese media that Greeneville had {{made no effort to}} assist Ehime Maru survivors as they waited for almost one hour for rescue angered many Japanese citizens, especially the family members of the missing. [...] One Japanese family member publicly referred to Waddle as, [...] "the most terrible criminal of them all." [...] Another family member, referring to Waddle said, [...] "If you're a man, you should fall <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>knees</b> and ask for our pardon!" [...] In response, Waddle delivered letters of apology to the Japanese consulate in Hawaii for delivery to the victims' families during the last week of February.|$|E
500|$|Away {{from his}} expeditions, Shackleton's life was {{generally}} restless and unfulfilled. In {{his search for}} rapid pathways to wealth and security, he launched business ventures which failed to prosper, and he died heavily in debt. Upon his death, he was lauded in the press, but was thereafter largely forgotten, while the heroic reputation of his rival Scott was sustained for many decades. Later in the 20th century, Shackleton was [...] "rediscovered", and rapidly became {{a role model for}} leadership as one who, in extreme circumstances, kept his team together in a survival story described by cultural historian Stephanie Barczewski as [...] "incredible". In his 1956 address to the British [...] Association, Sir Raymond Priestley, one of his contemporaries, said [...] "Scott for scientific method, Amundsen for speed and efficiency but when disaster strikes and all hope is gone, get down <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>knees</b> and pray for Shackleton", paraphrasing what Apsley Cherry-Garrard had written in a preface to The Worst Journey in the World.|$|E

500|$|In the United States, shock-rock pioneer Alice Cooper {{achieved}} mainstream {{success with}} the top five album School's Out (1972), which {{was followed by the}} #1 album Billion Dollar Babies in 1973. Also in 1973, blues rockers ZZ Top released their classic album Tres Hombres and Aerosmith produced their eponymous début, as did Southern rockers Lynyrd Skynyrd and proto-punk outfit New York Dolls, demonstrating the diverse directions being pursued in the genre. Montrose, including the instrumental talent of Ronnie Montrose and vocals of Sammy Hagar and arguably the first all American hard rock band to challenge the British dominance of the genre, released their first album in 1973. Former bubblegum-pop family act the Osmonds recorded two hard rock albums in 1972 and had their breakthrough in the UK with the hard-rock hit [...] "Crazy Horses." [...] Kiss built on the theatrics of Alice Cooper and the look of the New York Dolls to produce a unique band persona, achieving their commercial breakthrough with the double live album Alive! in 1975 and helping to take hard rock into the stadium rock era. In the mid-1970s Aerosmith achieved their commercial and artistic breakthrough with Toys in the Attic (1975), which reached number 11 in the American album chart, and Rocks (1976), which peaked at number three. Blue Öyster Cult, formed in the late 60s, picked up on some of the elements introduced by Black Sabbath with their breakthrough live gold album On Your Feet or <b>on</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Knees</b> (1975), followed by their first platinum album, Agents of Fortune (1976), containing the hit single [...] "(Don't Fear) The Reaper", which reached number 12 on the Billboard charts. Journey released their eponymous debut in 1975 and the next year Boston released their highly successful début album. In the same year, hard rock bands featuring women saw commercial success as Heart released Dreamboat Annie and the Runaways débuted with their self-titled album. While Heart had a more folk-oriented hard rock sound, the Runaways leaned more towards a mix of punk-influenced music and hard rock. The Amboy Dukes, having emerged from the Detroit garage rock scene and most famous for their Top 20 psychedelic hit [...] "Journey to the Center of the Mind" [...] (1968), were dissolved by their guitarist Ted Nugent, who embarked on a solo career that resulted in four successive multi-platinum albums between Ted Nugent (1975) and his best selling Double Live Gonzo!

2500|$|Lyrically, This Means War! {{took the}} {{implicit}} spiritual warfare theme {{that had been}} present in Petra's albums and tours since Never Say Die and emphasized it further. Although the album ended for good the band's longstanding tradition of featuring electric guitars as warcraft, its picture of a warrior on his knees complemented songs with titles such as [...] "Get <b>on</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Knees</b> and Fight Like a Man," [...] "All the King's Horses" [...] and the title track, a rousing rocker backed by a marching drumbeat that addressed Satan as the preordained loser of the war he had declared against Christ and his followers.|$|E

Other major songs on the album were [...] "(This Ain't) The Summer of Love", [...] "E.T.I. (Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence)" [...] and [...] "The Revenge of Vera Gemini". For the tour, the band added lasers to their light show, for which they became known. They were among the first acts to use lasers in performance.|$|E

Hamlet thinks of Polonius' perfidy (Hamlet: Sur moi tombent les cieux avant que cet hymen funeste s'accomplisse! [...] "May the heavens fall upon me before such an ill-fated {{marriage}} can be solemnized!"). Ophélie asks what he means. He responds: Non! Allez dans un cloître, allez, Ophélie. [...] "No!

Ophélie despairs (Ophélie: Cet amor promis à genoux [...] "The love that <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>knees</b> you swore"). She returns her ring to him (Theme of Hamlet's Love), and Hamlet weeps. The Queen turns to Ophélie saying he weeps, he remembers, he loves you. Hamlet cries out again (Hamlet: Non! Allez dans un cloître, allez, Ophélie [...] "No! Go to a nunnery, go, Ophélie"). Each continues to express conflicting feelings in an extended ensemble. Ophélie leaves, hiding her tears.|$|E

Barakat said the pair had [...] "an amazing chemistry together. He added this sweet dynamic to the band we never had before. He made us think in ways we never would have thought before." [...] "Forget About It" [...] was written by Gaskarth and Fields. [...] "Time-Bomb" [...] was written by Gaskarth, Bouvier, Comeau and Squire.

[...] Adalgisa is aghast. Norma: [...] "I beg you for his children's sake." [...] (Duet, first Norma: Deh! con te, con te li prendi, Li sostieni, li difendi / [...] "Please, take them with you, support them and protect them; I don't ask you for honour or power, let that be kept for your own children.") Adalgisa tells her that she'll never leave Gaul and only agreed to the request in order to do what was good for Norma. (Duet, Adalgisa: Vado al campo, ed all'ingrato Tutti io reco i tuoi lamenti.) In the duet, Adalgisa agrees to go to the Roman camp and tell Pollione of Norma's grief but her hope is to persuade him to return to Norma. She then renounces Pollione: (Duet: Mira, o Norma / [...] "O Norma, look at your dear children of yours <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>knees.</b> Be moved by pity for them, even if you have no pity for yourself.") They sing together, each expressing her own thoughts and feelings until Norma realises that Adalgisa will give up Pollione and remain with her: (Cabaletta: Duet, Norma and Adalgisa: Si fino all'ore estreme, compagna tua m'avrai / [...] "Yes, you will have me as your friend until your last hour; the world is large enough to be a shelter to both of us together.") ...|$|E
