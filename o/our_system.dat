25|$|Third, Searle {{argues that}} much of {{rational}} deliberation involves adjusting our (often inconsistent) patterns of desires to decide between outcomes, {{not the other way}} around. While in the Classical Model, one would start from a desire to go to Paris greater than that of saving money and calculate the cheapest way to get there, in reality people balance the niceness of Paris against the costs of travel to decide which desire (visiting Paris or saving money) they value more. Hence, he believes rationality is not a system of rules, but more of an adverb. We see certain behavior as rational, no matter what its source, and <b>our</b> <b>system</b> of rules derives from finding patterns in what we see as rational.|$|E

This paper {{describes the}} work on these tasks done by France Telecom Team (Beijing) at the fourth International Chinese Language Processing Bakeoff. In particular, we employ Conditional Random Fields with different features for these tasks. In order to improve NER relatively low recall; we exploit non-local features and alleviate class imbalanced distribution on NER dataset to enhance the recall and keep its relatively high precision. Some other post-processing measures such as consistency checking and transformation-based error-driven learning are used to improve word segmentation performance. <b>Our</b> <b>systems</b> participated in most CWS and POS tagging evaluations and all the NER tracks. As a result, <b>our</b> NER <b>system</b> achieves the first ranks on MSRA open track and MSRA/CityU closed track. <b>Our</b> CWS <b>system</b> achieves the first rank on CityU open track, which means that <b>our</b> <b>systems</b> achieve state-of-the-art performance on Chinese lexical processing...|$|R
