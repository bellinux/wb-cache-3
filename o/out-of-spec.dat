40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{discusses}} {{a quality}} control method, based on artificial neural networks, that enables a plant operator to quickly detect property variations during {{the production of}} stone aggregates. The group texture concept in digital image analyses, two-dimensional wavelet transforms, and artificial neural networks are reviewed first. An artificial intelligence based aggregate classification system is then described. This system relies on three-dimensional aggregate particle surface data, acquired with a laser profiler, and conversion of this data into digital images. Two-dimensional wavelet transforms are applied to the images and used to extract important features that can help to differentiate between in-spec and <b>out-of-spec</b> aggregates. These wavelet-based features are used as inputs to an artificial neural network, {{which is used to}} assign a predefined class to the aggregate sample. Verification tests show that this approach can potentially help a plant operator determine, in a fast and accurate manner, if the aggregates currently being produced are in-spec or <b>out-of-spec...</b>|$|E
40|$|For {{refueling}} on-board hydrogen tanks, table-based or formula based protocols {{are commonly}} used. These protocols {{are designed to}} achieve a tank filling close to 100 % SOC (State of Charge) in s safe way: without surpassing temperature (- 40 °C to 85 °C) and pressure limits (125 % Nominal Working Pressure, NWP). The ambient temperature, the initial pressure and the volume category of the (compressed hydrogen storage system, CHSS are used as inputs to determine the final target pressure and the pressure ramp rate (which controls the filling duration). However, abnormal <b>out-of-spec</b> events (e. g. misinformation of storage system status and characteristics of the storage tanks) may occur and result in a refueling in which the safety boundaries are surpassed. In the present article, the possible out of specification (<b>out-of-spec)</b> events in a refueling station have been analyzed. The associated hazards when refueling on-board hydrogen tanks have been studied. Experimental results of <b>out-of-spec</b> event tests performed on a type 3 tank are presented. The results show that on the type 3 tank, the safety temperature limit of 85 °C was only surpassed under a combination of events; e. g. an unnoticed stop of the cooling of the gas combined with a wrong input of ambient temperature at a very warm environment. On the other hand, under certain events (e. g. cooling the gas below the target temperature) and in particular under cold environmental conditions, the 100 % SOC limit established in the fuelling protocols has been surpassed.

A Mew type of regression, called multiway covariates regression, ir used Co Sind {{the relationship between the}} process variables and the quality variables of the final product. The three-way structure of the batch process data is modeled by means of a Tucker 3 or a PARAFAC model. The only information needed is a historical data set of past successful batches.

40|$|The {{structural}} integrity of interconnect structures containing ultra-low-k (ULK) dielectrics is {{highly dependent on}} the mechanical properties of the porous dielectrics, e. g. fracture toughness elastic modulus and adhesion as well. Four-point-bending (FPB) and double-cantilever-beam (DCB) methods {{for the evaluation of}} fracture properties require out-of-fab sample preparation and testing. The reliable characterization of interfacial adhesion is important for in-line/at-line process development and control in microelectronics manufacturing. The ability to detect an <b>out-of-spec</b> or defective ULK film at an early process step could potentially save processing and materials cost. Therefore, the development of quick turnaround experimental methodologies for monitoring in-line/at-line mechanical stability of ULK films and ULK-containing interconnects is of great interest for semiconductor industry. This study presents two novel experimental approaches for the evaluation of inter face adhesion and mechanical robustness of on-chip interconnects structures based on nanoindentation and nanoscratch, (a) wedge indentation and (b) bump assisted BEOL stability indentation (BABSI) tests, respectively. Wedge indentation tests on ULK films with increasing porosity show a decrease of adhesion values.

This paper {{presents the results}} of applying the finite element method to calculating the spring back of an automotive hood assembly, and its application to the functional build method. The assembly was comprised of six individual panels: an inner panel, an outer panel, a major reinforcement, a latch reinforcement, and two hinge reinforcements. Finite element simulations were conducted for forming each of the six components. Each component was formed, trimmed, and positioned in car position. The outer panel required several secondary forming operations including a re-meshing, remapping, trim, and flanging operation. Once in car position, the components were moved so that they just contacted each other, and were “spot welded ” together through the application of nodal constraints. Mastic between components was simulated with tied contact. Contact between components was simulated with contact interfaces. Finally, a spring back analysis was conducted. The models clearly illustrate {{that it is possible to}} predict spring back of large automotive assemblies, and that the assembly process yields different final shapes than those obtained from spring back of individual components. With this newly developed tool it is possible to predict whether or not the assembly process can correct <b>out-of-spec</b> components, a key factor in utilizing the functional build method...|$|E
40|$|Samples of {{the three}} {{cushioning}} foams used in the H 1259 weapon storage container were obtained in 1997, 1998, 2000 and 2001 and tested for density, compression set and compressive strength using the same procedures specified for acceptance testing. Foams from six containers, all about 30 years old and located at Pantex, were evaluated. The bottom cushioning foam is a General Plastics polyurethane foam and the two side pads are rebonded polyurethane foams. All the tests were carried out at room temperature. When compared to the original acceptance requirements the foams were generally in-spec for density and compressive strength at 10 % strain and were generally <b>out-of-spec</b> for compression set and compressive strength at 50 % strain. Significant variability was noted {{in the performance of}} each foam sample and even more in the container-to-container foam performance. The container-to-container variability remains the major unknown in predicting the long-term suitability of these containers for continued use. The performance of the critical bottom cushion foams was generally more uniform and closer to the specified performance than that of the rebonded foams. It was judged that all the foams were adequate for continued use as storage container foams (not shipping) under controlled conditions to mitigate temperature extremes or high impact. This archived information is important in evaluations of the continued suitability for weapon storage use of the H 1259 containers and other containers using the same foam cushions...|$|E

40|$|Tolerance {{allocation}} is {{a design}} tool. It provides a rational basis for assigning tolerances to dimensions. Several algorithms {{are described in}} this paper for performing tolerance allocation, which {{is defined as the}} re-distribution of the "tolerance budget" within an assembly to reduce over-all cost of production, while meeting target levels for quality. The task of placing +/- tolerances on each dimension of a CAD model or set of engineering drawings may seem menial and of little consequence. However, it can have enormous impact on cost and quality. On the engineering design side, it affects the fit and function of the final product, which can cause poor performance and dissatisfied customers. On the manufacturing side, tolerance requirements determine the selection of machines, tooling and fixtures; operator skill levels and setup costs; inspection precision and gaging; and scrap and rework. In short, it affects nearly every aspect of the product life cycle. Using the new CAD-based tolerance analysis tools, designers can perform variation analysis on the CAD model, before parts are made or tooling purchased. They can determine where tolerance controls are needed and how tight the limits must be set, to assist in process planning and tool design. Using the same CAD model, production personnel can use tolerance tools to determine whether marginal or <b>out-of-spec</b> parts can still be used. Tolerance analysis tools provide a quantitative basis for design for manufacture decisions, resulting in shorter product development time and increased quality. There is probably no other design improvement effort which can yield greater benefits for less cost than the careful analysis and assignment of tolerances.

40|$|Log {{processor}} heads {{have become}} increasingly used in New Zealand (NZ) forest harvesting operations to increase productivity and improve worker safety. Information regarding the measurement accuracy and productivity of new model processor heads is limited. As a result, log quality control (QC) is carried out on logs that have been merchandised by a processor head. This task can have a high risk for injury from man – machine interaction. A trend between studies was that older model Waratah’s did not have sufficient measurement accuracy to alleviate the requirement for log QC. In this study, a Waratah HTH 625 c processor head operating in NZ was analysed for measurement accuracy and productivity. Measurement accuracy was considered by measuring logs for length, diameter and branch size. A comparison of two methods of processing was also considered to determine measurement accuracy, productivity and production efficiency for the way logs are delimbed and merchandised. Once gathered, the data was then analysed to identify significant effects, trends and relationships between variables. Length measurements were highly accurate but diameter measurements were under- estimated. It was also evident that although there was absolute accuracy, there was a high variability in measurements with underestimating and overestimating. Branch size was also {{found to have a}} significant impact in reducing length measurement accuracy and productivity. Single pass processing has significantly higher production efficiency than two pass processing, although single pass processing had a higher length error associated with it. The Waratah HTH 625 c processor head has better measurement accuracy than older model Waratah’s. However, logs are still cut <b>out-of-spec</b> which will require a log QC to identify. As measurement technology is further improved in processor heads, and improvements to NZ’s plantation resource (improved form and smaller branching) are realised at harvest age, measurement accuracy and productivity of log processor heads will further improve...|$|E

As a result, {{it becomes very}} challengingto verify those billion-transistor chips {{and there is an}} urgent need to develop advancedand parallel simulation technique. On the other hand, the counterfeit ICs have becomea major security threat for commercial and mission-critical systems. In addition to thehuge economic impacts, they post significant security and safety threats on those systems. The objective of this thesis is to develop new techniques to address above two tough issuesencountered in VLSI research: new fast parallel circuit simulation and potential solutionsto mitigate the counterfeit IC problem. To accelerate the circuit simulation, we study several important linear algebraoperations in simulation steps, such as sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV), directlinear LU factorization and iterative general minimum residual linear solver. Parallel computing such as general purpose GPU programs are good solutions for improving performance of these operations. We apply GPU for these tasks and attain impressive speedup over traditional or CPU methods. All algorithms and implementations are demonstrated withrepresentative numerical experiments and thorough comparisons among different methodsand platforms. For various types of counterfeit ICs - recycled, remarked, cloned, <b>out-of-spec,</b> andover-produced, we propose a multi-functional on-chip sensor and post-authentication policyfor detecting and preventing them. Especially for recycled ICs, we propose two kindsof aging sensors, which are based on electromigration (EM) -induced aging effects and ring oscillator (RO) -based frequency aging effects. These two aging sensors can effectively detectchip usage time for both short and long periods. Simulated results show the advantage of theproposed multi-purpose sensor against the existing on-chip sensors in terms of functionality,detection coverage and usage time estimation range and accuracy...|$|E
