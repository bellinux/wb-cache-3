5|$|A {{survey in}} 2012 {{revealed}} that passengers who used Metrolink everyday for commuting rated service levels as poor and/or unreliable, with those respondents particularly frustrated by delays and disruptions. TfGM recognised {{that the older}} vehicles in its fleet – the T68/T68As — were outdated {{and the cause of}} much disruption, and agreed to replace them with M5000s by 2014. Among those who used Metrolink less regularly, the system scored far better in the survey. A survey in 2013 by the non-departmental government body Passenger Focus found that of the five major light rail systems in the United Kingdom – Metrolink, Sheffield Supertram, NET, Midland Metro and Blackpool tramway – Metrolink had the lowest <b>overall</b> <b>satisfaction</b> rating in the United Kingdom.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between the household's financial position and <b>overall</b> life <b>satisfaction.</b> The empirical analysis, based on a large nationally representative panel survey for Germany, aims to ascertain the impact of a household's subjective and monetary financial positions on <b>overall</b> life <b>satisfaction.</b> Within a fixed effects framework, the level of household assets and net wealth are positively related to <b>overall</b> life <b>satisfaction,</b> as is household income. Allowing for different types of debt to have differential impacts on <b>overall</b> life <b>satisfaction</b> reveals that unsecured debt, opposed to secured debt, has a detrimental impact on <b>overall</b> life <b>satisfaction.</b> In addition, the household's subjective financial position is found to be an important determinant of <b>overall</b> life <b>satisfaction.</b> The potential endogeneity of the subjective financial measures in the <b>overall</b> life <b>satisfaction</b> equation is accounted for using a recursive bivariate ordered probit model. The results suggest that the subjective financial position mediates the association between the household's monetary financial position and <b>overall</b> life <b>satisfaction...</b>|$|R

In an interview with the TechRadar website in 2009, he stated that DAB+ was a [...] "red herring" [...] and may not be introduced in the UK for the foreseeable future due to the growing number of digital radio sets currently being sold and used in the future which cannot decode HE-AAC and therefore access DAB+ stations. Moretta also cited greater expense for broadcasters and <b>overall</b> <b>satisfaction</b> with the current audio quality of DAB stations of which a move to DAB+ would only benefit a small number of audiophiles as other reasons.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to examine the impact of caring climate, employees' job satisfaction, and affective {{commitment}} on employees' job performance in a banking sector. This study proposes that caring climate has a significant direct effect on <b>overall</b> job <b>satisfaction,</b> affective commitment, and job performance. Moreover, it suggests that caring climate has an influence on job performance through <b>overall</b> job <b>satisfaction</b> and affective commitment. Additionally, affective commitment is considered to be a mediator in the relationship between <b>overall</b> job <b>satisfaction</b> and job performance. In this study, the relationships among the variables were evaluated using factor analysis, descriptive statistics, correlations, and regression. The results based on a sample of 152 employees from one public and three private banks in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina support the hypotheses. This study demonstrates that caring climate has a significant direct influence on <b>overall</b> job <b>satisfaction,</b> affective commitment, and job performance. Furthermore, caring climate has an indirect effect on job performance.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{conducted}} {{in the context of}} the hotel industry. Every year, the hotel investigated in this thesis completes a job satisfaction survey. The survey is built upon several facets from which an <b>overall</b> job <b>satisfaction</b> is derived. The problem is that the survey has through time shown poor results, especially with facets concerning management. When those facets were summed up with other facets, it had a strong negative influence on the <b>overall</b> job <b>satisfaction</b> at Hotel X. Scarpello and Campbell (1983) argue that all facets may not directly influence <b>overall</b> job <b>satisfaction,</b> and as a consequence the sum of several facets might contribute to misleading conclusions. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate how managerial processes influence employees’ <b>overall</b> job <b>satisfaction</b> at Hotel X. By managerial processes is meant what managers do or is perceived by employees to do. The thesis investigates job satisfaction at both an overall and a facet level. Questions on which facets that influence <b>overall</b> job <b>satisfaction,</b> as well as whether managerial processes have a direct or indirect influence on overall job satisfac-tion are answered. In order to fulfil our purpose multiple sources of evidence were used. Surveys made by the hotel were used as secondary data. The primary data consisted of qualitative observations and indepth interviews with employees. The facets investigated were; Job Contents, Equip-ment, Salary, Rewards, Benefits, Conditions of Employment, Personal Development, Co-workers, Immediate Management and Top Management. The managerial processes dealt with were organisational structure, managerial style and communication. The company survey of 2005 and the results from qualitative data corresponded well. Job Contents, Conditions of Employment, Personal Development, Co-workers, Immediate Management and Top Management all influenced <b>overall</b> job <b>satisfaction.</b> However, there were no indications found that Equipment, Salary, Rewards and Benefits influenced <b>overall</b> job <b>satisfaction.</b> Managerial processes were significant for all facets, except for Salary. Top Management and Immediate Management were the only facets with a direct connection between managerial processes and <b>overall</b> job <b>satisfaction.</b> Communication was found to be the process which influence job satisfaction the most. It turned out to influence all the facets that were either directly or in-directly linked to <b>overall</b> job <b>satisfaction...</b>|$|R

2500|$|A {{meta-analysis}} {{that was}} performed indicates research {{studies conducted in}} PGD underscore future research. This is due to positive attitudinal survey results, postpartum follow-up studies demonstrating {{no significant differences between}} those who had used PGD and those who conceived naturally, and ethnographic studies which confirmed that those with a previous history of negative experiences found PGD as a relief. Firstly, in the attitudinal survey, women with a history of infertility, pregnancy termination, and repeated miscarriages reported having a more positive attitude towards preimplantation genetic diagnosis. They were more accepting towards pursuing PGD. Secondly, likewise to the first attitudinal study, an ethnographic study conducted in 2004 found similar results. Couples with a history of multiple miscarriages, infertility, and an ill child, felt that preimplantation genetic diagnosis was a viable option. They also felt more relief; [...] "those using the technology were actually motivated to not repeat pregnancy loss". In summary, although some of these studies are limited due to their retrospective nature and limited samples, the study's results indicate an <b>overall</b> <b>satisfaction</b> of participants for the use of PGD. However, the authors of the studies do indicate that these studies emphasize the need for future research such as creating a prospective design with a valid psychological scale necessary to assess the levels of stress and mood during embryonic transfer and implantation.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ed. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2003 The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine what role working in a union or {{nonunion}} college has in influencing faculty perceptions of control over their work and <b>overall</b> job <b>satisfaction.</b> Using data from the 1993 National Study of Postsecondary Faculty, this study explored the relative importance of variables in influencing perceived control and <b>overall</b> job <b>satisfaction</b> among 3, 636 full-time teaching faculty in two-year unionized and nonunionized colleges. A conceptual framework was adapted for this study from the situational model of job satisfaction (Locke, 1976) to select and organize variables according to background characteristics, characteristics of the job task, and financial reward variables. Results of correlational analyses confirm a positive relationship between perceived control and <b>overall</b> job <b>satisfaction</b> for two-year college teaching faculty in both union and nonunion colleges. For both perceived control and <b>overall</b> job <b>satisfaction,</b> multiple regression analyses reveal few differences in the predictive value of independent variables among faculty in union and nonunion colleges. Job task variables and financial reward variables, not including salary and benefits, were found to be predictive of perceived control for faculty in both union and nonunion colleges. Perceived control was found to be predictive of <b>overall</b> job <b>satisfaction</b> irrespective of union status. Satisfaction with workload and financial reward variables were found predictive of <b>overall</b> job <b>satisfaction</b> for faculty irrespective of union status. Gender (female) was found to be a predictor of job satisfaction for union faculty. A significant interaction among some variables and union status was found suggesting some variables predictive of perceived control and <b>overall</b> job <b>satisfaction</b> carry a greater importance for faculty at nonunion colleges. This study's findings have theoretical implications for support of the situational model of job satisfaction and the importance of perceived control or autonomy in influencing <b>overall</b> job <b>satisfaction.</b> The findings further have practical implications for two-year colleges concerned with improving the work environment for teaching faculty...|$|R
