40|$|Current network control systems, {{including}} {{quality of}} service systems in general, base optimization decisions on assumptions about {{the needs of a}} canonical user. We propose focusing optimization on the needs of individual users. This approach has the potential to increase <b>overall</b> <b>user</b> <b>satisfaction</b> while using fewer resources. We apply the approach to home networks. A careful user study clearly demonstrates that measured end-user satisfaction with a given set of home network conditions is highly variable—user perception and opinion of acceptable network performance is very different from user to user. To exploit this fact we design, implement, and evaluate a prototype system, EmNet, that incorporates direct user feedback from a simple user interface layered over existing web content. This feedback is used to dynamically configure a weighted fair queuing (WFQ) scheduler inside a broadband router that schedules the wide-area link. We evaluate EmNet in terms of the measured satisfaction of end-users, {{and in terms of the}} bandwidth required. We compare EmNet with an uncontrolled link (the common case today), as well as with statically configured WFQ scheduling. On average EmNet is able to increase <b>overall</b> <b>user</b> <b>satisfaction</b> by 24 % over the uncontrolled network and by 19 % over static WFQ. EmNet does so by only increasing the average application bandwidth by 6 % over the static WFQ scheduler...|$|R

Study designIn a Phase III study in 36 European centers, 304 healthy nulliparous or parous postmenarcheal adolescents (12 – 17 years) received LNG-IUS 8 for 12 months. The primary outcome was the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Secondary outcomes included: serious TEAEs, adverse events of special interest, <b>overall</b> <b>user</b> <b>satisfaction,</b> discontinuation rate at 12 months, and Pearl Index. ResultsLNG-IUS 8 placement was successful in 303 / 304 participants (99. 7 %). Overall, 82. 6 % of participants reported TEAEs, and serious TEAEs and serious study drug-related TEAEs were reported by 7. 6 % and 1. 0 % of participants, respectively. No cases of pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, or uterine perforation were reported. No pregnancies were reported during the 12 -month study. At Month 12 /study end, the <b>overall</b> <b>user</b> <b>satisfaction</b> rate was 83. 9 %. Overall, 51 participants (16. 8 %) prematurely discontinued the study before 12 months; 13. 8 % of participants discontinued owing to TEAEs. ConclusionsNo new or unexpected safety events {{were associated with the}} low-dose LNG-IUS 8. The safety profile of LNG-IUS 8 in adolescents was consistent with that previously reported in adults. The high overall user-satisfaction rate at study end and the low discontinuation rate over 12 months demonstrate that LNG-IUS 8 is a highly acceptable contraceptive method among adolescents. ImplicationsThis study is the first to assess the low-dose levonorgestrel intrauterine system LNG-IUS 8 (average approximate release rate 8 μg/ 24 h over the first year and total content 13. 5 mg) specifically in females< 18 years of age and confirms the safety and efficacy of LNG-IUS 8 in an adolescent population...|$|R

Non-experts are categorised as apprentice investigator and general public. UX factors and website features that influence <b>user</b> <b>satisfaction</b> were identified and investigated. The relevancy is to examine whether existing digital cultural heritage online collections are able to satisfy general type users. Two existing digital culture heritage online collections were used as the vehicle to get the findings. A qualitative approach was adopted in this pilot study.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to {{contribute}} to our knowledge of what haptics can {{bring to the table}} as a human-computer interface rendering technique, which other rendering techniques cannot. An experiment was set up in which a multi-interfaced game was used to convey an information structure to interface users. Each of the game’s three user interfaces utilized one of three different rendering techniques: haptic rendering, graphic rendering, and graphic-haptic rendering. The capacity of each rendering technique to represent the information structure was assessed in terms of the effect of the corresponding interface on three aspects of the user interaction: <b>user</b> performance, <b>user</b> <b>satisfaction</b> and system usability. The result indicated that user performance benefitted from a graphic or graphic-haptic rendering over a haptic rendering. There were no differences between the rendering techniques with regards to the <b>overall</b> <b>user</b> <b>satisfaction.</b> However, there were notable differences on the <b>user</b> <b>satisfaction</b> metric subscale level. The haptic rendering required higher attentive effort than other renderings. Also, the graphic rendering better facilitated the perception of having clear goals and feedback.

40|$|In video {{streaming}} over multicast network, user bandwidth requirement is often heterogeneous possibly with {{orders of magnitude}} difference (say, from hundreds of kb/s for mobile devices to tens of Mb/s for high definition TV). Multiple description coding (MDC) {{can be used to}} address this bandwidth heterogeneity issue. In MDC, the video source is encoded into multiple independent descriptions. A receiver, depending on its available bandwidth, joins different descriptions to meet their bandwidth requirements. An important but challenging problem for MDC video multicast is how to assign bandwidth to each description in order to maximize <b>overall</b> <b>user</b> <b>satisfaction.</b> In this paper, we investigate this issue by formulating it as an optimization problem, with the objective to maximize user bandwidth experience by taking into account the encoding inefficiency due to MDC. We prove that the optimization problem is in general NP-hard. However, if the description number is larger than or equal to a certain threshold (for a bandwidth heterogeneity of a factor of 100, such threshold is 7 descriptions), there is an exact and simple solution to achieve maximum <b>user</b> <b>satisfaction,</b> i. e. meeting all the receiving bandwidth requirements. For the case when the description number is smaller, we present an efficient heuristic called SAMBA (Simulated Annealing for MDC Bandwidth Assignment) to assign bandwidth to each description given the distribution of user bandwidth requirement. We evaluate our algorithm using simulations. SAMBA achieves virtually the same optimal performance based on exhaustive search. By comparing with other assignment algorithms, SAMBA significantly improves <b>user</b> <b>satisfaction.</b> We also show that, if the coding efficiency decreases with the number of descriptions, there is an optimal description number to achieve maximal <b>user</b> <b>satisfaction...</b>|$|R
