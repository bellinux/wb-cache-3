40|$|Microcantilever based {{sensors can be}} {{used for}} {{detection}} of specific target molecules in a solution. In conventional mode <b>of</b> <b>sensing,</b> receptor molecules are immobilized on the cantilever surface and the chemical interaction between receptors and ligand molecules causes surface stress change resulting in cantilever deformation; however, in the competition mode <b>of</b> <b>sensing,</b> the cantilever surface is covered with complex molecules and after immerging cantilever in the solution of target molecules, ligand molecules diffuse away from the cantilever surface and causes cantilever deflection. In this method, the rate of ligand dissociation can be measured as a sensing tool. In this report, both mode <b>of</b> <b>sensing</b> is considered and theoretical models are developed to understand the mechanism of cantilever tip deflection in conventional mode <b>of</b> <b>sensing</b> and ligand dissociation rate in competition mode <b>of</b> <b>sensing.</b> For the conventional mode <b>of</b> <b>sensing,</b> it is shown that, the molecular interaction model, which is based on interaction energy between double strand DNAs, can predict the cantilever deflection better than entropy model.

5|$|Jane Austen lived {{her entire}} life {{as part of a}} large and close-knit family on the lower fringes of the English gentry. Her family's steadfast support was {{critical}} to Austen's development as a professional writer. Austen read draft versions of all of her novels to her family, receiving feedback and encouragement, and it was her father who sent out her first publication bid. Austen's artistic apprenticeship lasted from her teenage years until she was about thirty-five. During this period, she experimented with various literary forms, including the epistolary novel which she tried and then abandoned, and wrote and extensively revised three major novels and began a fourth. With the release <b>of</b> <b>Sense</b> and Sensibility (1811), Pride and Prejudice (1813), Mansfield Park (1814) and Emma (1815), she achieved success as a published writer.|$|E
5|$|Jane Austen was {{primarily}} educated {{at home by}} her father and older brothers and through her own reading. Her apprenticeship as a writer lasted from her teenage years until she was about thirty-five years old. During this period, she wrote three major novels and began a fourth. From 1811 until 1815, with the release <b>of</b> <b>Sense</b> and Sensibility (1811), Pride and Prejudice (1813), Mansfield Park (1814), and Emma (1815), she achieved success as a published writer. She wrote two additional novels, Northanger Abbey (originally written in 1798–1799 and revised later) and Persuasion, both published after her death in 1817, and began a third (eventually titled Sanditon), but died {{before it could be}} completed. A product of 18th-century literary traditions, Austen's works were influenced most by those of renowned writer and critic Samuel Johnson and novelists Frances Burney and Maria Edgeworth. She considered poet and novelist Sir Walter Scott a rival. Family theatricals, which included plays by Richard Brinsley Sheridan and other 18th-century dramatists, shaped Austen's writing from an early age. William Cowper's poetry was a favourite as were the novels of Samuel Richardson. Austen's engagement with sensibility illustrates her debt to sentimental writers such as Laurence Sterne.|$|E
5|$|Nervous {{tissue is}} {{composed}} of many nerve cells known as neurons which transmit information. In some slow-moving radially symmetrical marine animals such as ctenophores and cnidarians (including sea anemones and jellyfish), the nerves form a nerve net, but in most animals they are organized longitudinally into bundles. In simple animals, receptor neurons in the body wall cause a local reaction to a stimulus. In more complex animals, specialized receptor cells such as chemoreceptors and photoreceptors are found in groups and send messages along neural networks {{to other parts of}} the organism. Neurons can be connected together in ganglia. In higher animals, specialized receptors are the basis <b>of</b> <b>sense</b> organs and there is a central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and a peripheral nervous system. The latter consists of sensory nerves that transmit information from sense organs and motor nerves that influence target organs. The peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system which conveys sensation and controls voluntary muscle, and the autonomic nervous system which involuntarily controls smooth muscle, certain glands and internal organs, including the stomach.|$|E

5|$|The {{body of a}} fish {{is divided}} into a head, trunk and tail, {{although}} the divisions between the three are not always externally visible. The skeleton, which forms the support structure inside the fish, is either made of cartilage, in cartilaginous fish, or bone in bony fish. The main skeletal element is the vertebral column, composed of articulating vertebrae which are lightweight yet strong. The ribs attach to the spine {{and there are no}} limbs or limb girdles. The main external features of the fish, the fins, are composed of either bony or soft spines called rays, which {{with the exception of the}} caudal fins, have no direct connection with the spine. They are supported by the muscles which compose the main part of the trunk. The heart has two chambers and pumps the blood through the respiratory surfaces of the gills and on round the body in a single circulatory loop. The eyes are adapted for seeing underwater and have only local vision. There is an inner ear but no external or middle ear. Low frequency vibrations are detected by the lateral line system <b>of</b> <b>sense</b> organs that run along the length of the sides of fish, and these respond to nearby movements and to changes in water pressure.|$|E

5|$|There is {{speculation}} {{of several}} {{mechanisms by which}} the brain cells could be lost. One mechanism consists of an abnormal accumulation of the protein alpha-synuclein bound to ubiquitin in the damaged cells. This insoluble protein accumulates inside neurones forming inclusions called Lewy bodies. According to the Braak staging, a classification of the disease based on pathological findings, Lewy bodies first appear in the olfactory bulb, medulla oblongata and pontine tegmentum; individuals at this stage may be asymptomatic or may have early non-motor symptoms (such as loss <b>of</b> <b>sense</b> of smell, or some sleep or automatic dysfunction). As the disease progresses, Lewy bodies develop in the substantia nigra, areas of the midbrain and basal forebrain and, finally, the neocortex. These brain sites are the main places of neuronal degeneration in PD; however, Lewy bodies may not cause cell death {{and they may be}} protective (with the abnormal protein sequestered or walled off). Other forms of alpha-synuclein (e.g., oligomers) that are not aggregated in Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites may actually be the toxic forms of the protein. In people with dementia, a generalized presence of Lewy bodies is common in cortical areas. Neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques, characteristic of Alzheimer's disease, are not common unless the person is demented.|$|E

5|$|Well, I {{think the}} subject of race has been so {{difficult}} and so polluted by malign ideas that most people have just left it alone, including geneticists. … Most genetic variation is neutral – it doesn't do anything for or against the phenotype, and evolution ignores it – so most previous attempts to look at race have concluded that there's little difference between races. I think this position is the one on which the social scientists are basing their position. … If {{you look at the}} genes that do make a difference, selected genes, which are a tiny handful of the whole, you do find a number of differences, not very many, but a number of interesting differences between races as to which genes have been selected. This, of course, makes a lot <b>of</b> <b>sense,</b> because once the human family dispersed from its homeland in Africa, people faced different environments on each continent, different climates, different evolutionary challenges, and each group adapted to its environment in its own way.|$|E
5|$|When Brion sent a {{bill for}} the {{abandoned}} sessions to DreamWorks, executives Lenny Waronker and Luke Wood scheduled a meeting with Smith to determine what went wrong with the sessions.

In May 2001, Smith set out to re-record the album, mostly on his own, but with some help from David McConnell of Goldenboy.

Notably, it was examined whether the effects of SCD on such aspects <b>of</b> self-experience as <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> having inner contents, <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> uniqueness, <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> one’s own boundaries, <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> coherence, <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> continuity in time, and <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> self-worth depend on individuals’ epistemic motivation, and more specifically their joint need for cognition, reflection, and integrative self-knowledge scores. Cluster analysis revealed three distinct profiles of epistemic motivation: disengaged, engaged and struggling, and engaged and integrating group. Subsequent analysis showed, first, that the three groups differed in SCD and <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> identity, with the epistemically disengaged group having the highest levels of SCD, and the epistemically engaged and integrating group having consistently the strongest <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> identity. Second, and more importantly, it showed that SCD was negatively related to overall <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> identity, and, in particular, <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> having inner contents, coherence and continuity in time, but only among individuals in the epistemically engaged and struggling group...|$|R
40|$|Mirror-touch {{synaesthesia}} (MTS) is {{a condition}} that leads people to experience tactile sensations on their own body when watching at someone else being touched.

This study investigates changes in <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> agency and <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> ownership in MTS. Using a paradigm that deliberately blurs the boundaries between the self and the other, we not only found that MTS affects <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> agency and <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> ownership, but that these aspects of self-awareness are affected differently. We suggest that alterations in <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> agency can be linked to more profound disturbances in <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> ownership in MTS, and that MTS may be characterised by underlying difficulties in self-other processing...|$|R
