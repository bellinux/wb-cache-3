5|$|In 2001, Martin {{was still}} <b>optimistic</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fourth {{installment}} might {{be released in}} the last quarter of 2002. However, the five-year gap did not work for all characters during writing. On one hand, Martin was unsatisfied with covering the events during the gap solely through flashbacks and internal retrospection. On the other hand, it was implausible to have nothing happen for five years. After working on the book for about a year, Martin realized he needed an additional interim book, which he called A Feast for Crows. The book would pick up the story immediately after the third book, and Martin scrapped the idea of a five-year gap. The material of the written 250-page prologue was mixed in as new viewpoint characters from Dorne and the Iron Islands. These expanded storylines and the resulting story interactions complicated the plot for Martin.|$|E

Tendulkar (148* in 1991–92, 241* in 2003–04) and V. V. S. Laxman (167 in 1999–2000, 178 in 2003–04) had both scored much-lauded Test centuries at the ground.|$|E

25|$|On 22 November Haig, Chief of the Imperial General Staff William Robertson, First Sea Lord Admiral Henry Jackson and Dover Patrol {{commander}} Vice-Admiral Reginald Bacon, {{wrote to}} General Joffre urging that the Flanders operation be undertaken in 1917, which Joffre accepted. In late 1916 and early 1917, military leaders in Britain and France were <b>optimistic</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> casualties they had inflicted on the German army at the Battle of Verdun, the Battle of the Somme {{and on the}} Eastern Front had brought the German army close to exhaustion, although the effort had been immensely costly.

Haig had hoped that the delay in producing tanks had been overcome and that enough would be ready to be used in September. Despite the small numbers of tanks available and the limited time for the training of crews by September 1916, Haig had committed them in the Battle of Flers–Courcelette, in view {{of the importance of the}} general Allied offensive being conducted on the Western Front in France, by Italy against the Austro-Hungarians and by Brusilov in Russia, which could not continue indefinitely.

25|$|Another {{concern with}} the Games was that venue {{construction}} had fallen behind. In 2009, {{two years before the}} start of the games, the athletes' village was still not under construction and the aquatics and athletics stadiums fell way behind schedule. Some venues and the athletes village were finished only a few weeks {{before the start of the}} games, including the Telcel Athletics Stadium and the beach volleyball stadium in Puerto Vallarta. This meant that not all disciplines could have a test event before the games began. Organizers guaranteed that all the sports venues being built for the games would be ready before September 2011. Many of the venues were scaled down, including the Telmex athletics stadium, which had the number of seats halved. During the election of the host city of the 2015 Pan American Games, PASO president Mario Vázquez Rana said that if Guadalajara did not address the delays, Toronto, the host of the next games, would step in and replace Guadalajara as host. In August 2011, the athletics stadium was further delayed by constant rain which prevented the installation of the track. This development put the test event scheduled for September at risk of being cancelled. Several days before the opening ceremony, the organizing committee announced that they were <b>optimistic</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> venues would be ready by the start of the games.|$|E
25|$|In fall of that year, Sweetland began {{football}} {{practice on}} September 4, 1900 with 10 returning {{players from the}} 1899 team. His team finished {{the season with a}} 7–2–1 record including victories over Amherst and Oberlin. One of his losses was to his former school, Cornell by a score of 6–0. Syracuse coming into the game did have several advantages that made their fans <b>optimistic</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Orange could pull out a victory. First the game was being played early in the season, September, 29th. The Orangemen had been practicing for several weeks longer than Cornell. The second benefit was a large crowd of Syracuse rooters attended the game. Even with the game being played at Cornell's Percy Field, Syracuse rooters filled half the grand stand and part of the bleachers. The third advantage was that Cornell's captain, Raymond Starbuck, had been hurt earlier in practice and could not play. Sweetland's team started out strongly and had several opportunities to score. Early in the game, after stopping Cornell on their first possession, Syracuse drove the ball into scoring position at the Cornell's 15 yard line but could not score. Later, just before half time, Cornell returned a fumble to the Syracuse's seven yard line but Sweetland's defence stopped them from scoring and took over on downs. Then in Syracuse's next possession, Carr, Syracuse's half-back, went {{through a hole in the}} Cornell line and ran seventy yards before Cornell's halfback A. B. Morrison caught him to prevent a touchdown. The game remained tied until about two minutes to play when Cornell's Morrison ran 25 yards for a touchdown. After the game Cornell accused Coach Sweetland's team of rough and dirty play.|$|E

500|$|Grant began {{experimenting with}} the drug LSD in the late 1950s, before it became popular. His wife, Betsy Drake, {{displayed}} {{a keen interest in}} psychotherapy, and through her Grant developed a considerable knowledge of the field of psychoanalysis. Radiologist Mortimer Hartman began treating him with LSD in the late 1950s, with Grant <b>optimistic</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> treatment could make him feel better about himself and rid of all of his inner turmoil stemming from his childhood and his failed relationships. He had an estimated 100 sessions over several years. For a long time, Grant viewed the drug positively, and stated that it was the solution after many years of [...] "searching for his peace of mind", and that for {{first time in his life}} he was [...] "truly, deeply and honestly happy".

500|$|According to {{zoologist}} and conservationist Sheila Conant, A. brownii {{is important}} {{due to its}} uniqueness in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands as [...] "the only Hawaiian endemic in this large genus which contains many economically and nutritionally important species." [...] However, {{in more than a}} decade of field surveys on Nihoa, no living plants have been identified. Wildlife refuge staff have visited the island during the dry season at least 21 times between 1983 and 1996. The absence of the plant in recent field surveys might be explained by the time of visit. Because winter surveys of Nihoa tend to be difficult and dangerous due to poor landing conditions, surveys have not been conducted during the moist, winter growing season from December through March when the plant is easiest to find. Most of the surveys have been completed during the summer months, when it is easiest to visit Nihoa, but during this time, the stems of A. brownii dry up and cannot be distinguished from other herbaceous plants. A seven-day visit to the island in April 2006 still did not find any specimens but botanists are <b>optimistic</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> species has survived. Additional winter surveys are required to accurately assess the conservation status of the plant.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} {{relationship}} between managerial optimism and corporate external financing decisions by empirically testing Heaton’s (2002) model. Heaton theoretically shows that, besides traditional information explanations, managerial optimism is also able to lead to managers’pecking order preferences in financing decisions. By using a specification of Shaym-Sunder and Myers (1999), we conduct a comparative test to see whether the pecking order hypothesis performs better when managers are <b>optimistic.</b> <b>That</b> is, <b>the</b> sensitivities of the net debt issues in relation to financing deficits for optimistic managers are larger than those for non-optimistic ones. Using listed Taiwanese companies as our sample, we find <b>that</b> <b>optimistic</b> managers indeed exhibit greater net-debt-issue/financing-deficit sensitivities than do non-optimistic ones.
