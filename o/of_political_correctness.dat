The topic of discussion was the effect <b>of</b> <b>political</b> <b>correctness</b> on free speech, and whether political correctness culture has grown to be detrimental. Additional topics included social justice, feminism, trigger warnings, and microaggressions. Some students attending began protesting mid-event, accusing the panelists of hate speech and demanding that they leave campus.|$|E
25|$|Nawaz notes how all {{transnational}} {{social movements}} of today, whether European Neo-fascism or Islamism, are extremist in nature, and democracy aspirants {{all over the}} world are left behind. He criticises the idea <b>of</b> <b>political</b> <b>correctness,</b> and the hesitation of democrats in asserting the universality of democratic norms. He also points to the political failure of many states in the Muslim world as a contributing factor. According to Nawaz, there is absence of democratic choice in many Muslim-majority countries, which means that their democratic parties often find themselves competing with non-democratic parties, including theocratic and military-backed ones. The political failure of democratic parties is taken as a failure of democracy itself in the Muslim world.|$|E

Throughout this period Patriarch Justinian took great care that his public statements met the regime's standards <b>of</b> <b>political</b> <b>correctness</b> and to avoid giving offence to the government; indeed the hierarchy at the time claimed that the arrests of clergy members were not due to religious persecution.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims at {{analysing}} <b>political</b> <b>correctness</b> in {{the context}} <b>of</b> education. <b>Political</b> <b>correctness</b> has already been widely studied and commented on; however, the phenomenon has received surprisingly little attention in relation to schooling and, particularly, teachers. In the Polish system <b>of</b> education, <b>political</b> <b>correctness</b> is manifest first of all in the overt policy applied by people in charge of education, who refrain from using terminology of e. g. “free market,” “commercial value,” “product,” “competition,” or “profit,” which could be unfavourably received or assessed by teachers. It turns out that <b>political</b> <b>correctness,</b> though founded upon proper assumptions and ideally contributing to common good, can be incorrectly understood or used for political purposes, and thus lose its initial sense, thwart communication between politicians and teachers and hinder their mutual understanding or even render it impossible. This paper attempts to reveal yet another set of conditions, this time the language-related ones, in which contemporary teachers work...|$|R

25|$|Sales of The Yellow Tape were jump-started {{when the}} band {{was taken off the}} bill for the 1991 New Year's Eve concert in Nathan Phillips Square outside Toronto City Hall because a staffer for then-mayor June Rowlands saw the band's name and felt it {{objectified}} women; the decision was further affirmed by city councillor Chris Korwin-Kuczynski. The band shrugged it off and booked another show at McMaster University. However, the media got wind of the story and decided to write about it as an example <b>of</b> <b>political</b> <b>correctness</b> gone too far. The first article earned the paper a large quantity of mail against City Hall's decision. The story became more and more prominent until about a week after New Years, when {{the band was}} asked to take a photo in front of City Hall for {{the front page of the}} Toronto Star. The stories targeted Rowlands even though she had not been directly involved in the decision to remove the band from the concert, but in fact had been out of town at the time. The following week, sales of the Yellow Tape exploded — by February 1992, it was outselling even Michael Jackson's Dangerous, Genesis' We Can't Dance and U2's Achtung Baby in some downtown Toronto record stores. They received enough publicity from the incident that MuchMusic offered them its second-ever Intimate and Interactive special on January 17. The tape eventually became the first ever indie release to achieve platinum status (100,000 copies) in Canada.|$|E

Jeffrey Lee Puckett of The Courier-Journal cited [...] "Whacking Day" [...] as [...] "the series' richest episode". He wrote: [...] "In 22 remarkable minutes, 'Whacking Day' skewers the quality of America's educational system, self-aggrandizing politicians, greed, the mob mentality, sexuality in the age <b>of</b> <b>political</b> <b>correctness</b> and the whole notion <b>of</b> <b>political</b> <b>correctness,</b> and makes a hero of Barry White." [...] Chris Vognar of The Dallas Morning News noted the episode {{was one of the}} fourth season's best episodes in his review of the DVD.

500|$|The {{episode was}} written and {{directed}} by the series' co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone.

500|$|While {{some conservatives}} have {{condemned}} {{the show for}} its vulgarity, a growing population of people who hold center-right political beliefs, including teenagers and young adults, have embraced the show for its tendency to mock liberal viewpoints and lampoon liberal celebrities and icons.

500|$|Before {{the episode}} was released, Debbie Liebling, then-Comedy Central vice {{president}} of development and production, herself described the episode as [...] "adorably offensive".

Matt Roush of USA Today praised the episode, which he described as [...] "ribald, raunchy and riotous". A.J.
