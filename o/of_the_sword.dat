5|$|Several stories also feature knights {{struggling}} {{to stave off}} the advances of voluptuous women, including Yder, the Lancelot-Grail Cycle, Hunbaut, and The Knight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sword.</b> The Green Knight parallel in these stories is a King testing a knight {{as to whether or not}} he will remain chaste in extreme circumstances. The woman he sends is sometimes his wife (as in Yder), if he knows that she is unfaithful and will tempt other men; in The Knight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sword</b> the king sends his beautiful daughter. All characters playing the Green Knight's role kill unfaithful knights who fail their tests.|$|E

They are attacked by Toral (Rick Pasqualone), son of Duras who had hired the Lethean and wants the sword for the prestige of finding it. Kor, Worf and Jadzia fight past Toral and his men and after finding that they cannot transport back to the Runabout in orbit, they head into the adjoining cave system {{in order to try to}} get out of range of whatever Toral is using to block the transporter. As they travel through the caves, the Klingons begin to be affected by the prestige <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sword.</b> Kor begins to talk about how it would allow him to overthrow Chancellor Gowron and Emperor Kahless II but Worf says that he should be the one to lead their people. Suddenly, Kor slips down the side of a cliff but refuses to let go <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sword.</b> Worf grabs the other end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sword,</b> and tries to convince Kor to let go as he cannot pull him and the sword up.|$|E

5|$|In the 16th {{century the}} Grand Duchy of Lithuania became {{increasingly}} interested in extending its territorial rule to Livonia, especially {{to gain control}} of Baltic seaports, such as Riga, and for other economic benefits.

This paper proposes a new method for creating one type of sound called aerodynamic sound. Examples of aerodynamic sound include sound generated by swinging swords or by wind blowing. A major source of aerodynamic sound is vortices generated in fluids such as air. First, we propose a method for creating sound textures for aerodynamic sound by making use of computational fluid dynamics.

5|$|The three {{actors were}} given martial arts {{training}} ahead of filming.

5|$|Critics who {{admire his}} middle work might {{characterize}} it as supple and muscular in its rhythms and sometimes harshly modernist, while others find these poems barren and weak in imaginative power.

In many ways, this poetry is a return to the vision of his earlier work.

5|$|During Thomas' episcopate, Finland {{is listed}} among the lands under the papal legate in the Baltic region, {{originally}} the Bishop of Zemgale, Baldwin, and then William of Modena, first on 28 January 1232 and last on 15 July 1244. This was a radical realignment of the bishopric's position, since the Pope had earlier used Swedish bishops {{to assist the}} Finnish church, as evident from papal letters from 1171 (or 1172), 1221 and 1229.

5|$|Initially {{presented}} {{as the primary}} antagonist who he must capture, Nero’s encounters with Dante {{over the course of}} the game reveal that the Order <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sword</b> is in fact responsible for a number of atrocities. Chief among them, is the Order's High-Ranking Scientist Agnus, who has succeeded in transforming himself, Credo, and a very-much-alive Sanctus into Demons with incredible power by siphoning demonic energy from Yamato, the long lost Devil Arm of Dante's twin brother Vergil. Furthermore, Sanctus has used Agnus' research to summon an army of demons to attack Fortuna, while simultaneously awakening a long dormant weapon called The Savior (a giant colossus made in Sparda's image) to destroy the threat; posing as the second coming of Sparda in order to eliminate non-believers, and strengthen his congregation’s worship.|$|E
