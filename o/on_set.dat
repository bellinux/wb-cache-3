5|$|Black Sabbath {{was made}} {{at the end of}} {{production}} of The Girl Who Knew Too Much during an eight-week period between February and March 1963. American International Production's involvement with the film allowed Salvatore Billitteri of the Titra Sound Corporation to be <b>on</b> <b>set</b> to supervise the film for dubbing on its English-language release. As the film was going to be dubbed in different languages, actors could no longer phonetically pronounce their dialogue as {{it had to be done}} rhythmically to match various languages. Billitteri was also <b>on</b> <b>set</b> to give suggestions to Bava on how to make his film more appropriate for American audiences which led to decreasing the amount of violence in the film. The film was first conceived under the title The Fear.|$|E

5|$|Ganino and Stillwell {{visited the}} set {{frequently}} during filming. Members {{of the main}} cast approached Stillwell with questions {{about the nature of}} the altered universe, trying to determine if they were still playing the same characters. Goldberg asked Ganino about changing a piece of dialogue <b>on</b> <b>set,</b> but since Ganino was not the author of the teleplay, he deferred to Stillwell, who in turn notified the production office. When Berman found out that Ganino and Stillwell were <b>on</b> <b>set</b> and talking to the actors, he banned them from setting foot on the sets again.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the episode}} was shot <b>on</b> <b>set</b> at the Irish studios of The Paint Hall. The exteriors of the {{entrance}} of Vaes Dothrak were filmed in the Sandy Brae area, and for the confrontation between Eddard and Cersei {{taking place in the}} Red Keep's gardens (identified as a godswood in the novels) the production used the cloister of the St Dominic Monastery in Rabat, in Malta.|$|E
5|$|Steve Frankel was {{the only}} {{carpenter}} <b>on</b> <b>set,</b> which made him the art direction's sole contributor.

The cabin had no plumbing, but phone lines were connected to it.|$|E
40|$|Anti-convex fuzzy <b>set</b> based <b>on</b> invex <b>set</b> and its related {{properties}} were researched, and anti-convex {{fuzzy set}} and some {{results in the}} related references were generalized. By applying thought of invex set to anti-convex fuzzy set, a new generalized anti-convex fuzzy set called anti-convex fuzzy <b>set</b> based <b>on</b> invex <b>set</b> was proposed. Let A∈F(Rn), andA is called Anti-convex fuzzy <b>set</b> based <b>on</b> invex <b>set,</b> whereη:Rn×Rn→Rn, and A(y+αη(x,y)) ≤A(x) ∨A(y),x,y∈Rn,α∈［ 0, 1 ］. Then, the relation between anti-convex fuzzy set and anti-convex fuzzy <b>set</b> based <b>on</b> invex <b>set</b> was discussed. If η(x,y) =x－y, then anti-convex fuzzy <b>set</b> based <b>on</b> invex <b>set</b> was degenerated into anti-convex fuzzy set, and obviously, anti-convex fuzzy set was made particular case of anti-convex fuzzy <b>set</b> based <b>on</b> invex <b>set.</b> Anti-convex fuzzy <b>set</b> based <b>on</b> invex <b>set</b> was not anti-convex fuzzy set by building an example, and anti-convex fuzzy <b>set</b> based <b>on</b> invex <b>set</b> was a true generalization of anti-convex fuzzy <b>set.</b> Thirdly, based <b>on</b> the definition of anti-convex fuzzy <b>set</b> based <b>on</b> invex <b>set,</b> the properties about the union and denseness of anti-convex fuzzy <b>set</b> based <b>on</b> invex <b>set</b> and the condition for fuzzy sets to be anti-convex fuzzy <b>set</b> based <b>on</b> invex <b>set</b> were studied. Lastly, similarly to ant-convex fuzzy <b>set</b> based <b>on</b> invex <b>set,</b> the conditions for fuzzy set to be strongly anti-convex fuzzy <b>set</b> based <b>on</b> invex <b>set</b> and strictly anti-convex fuzzy <b>set</b> based <b>on</b> invex <b>set</b> fuzzy sets were respectively studied...|$|R

5|$|The bats {{were entirely}} digital (except in shots {{containing}} {{only one or}} two bats), as it was decided directing larger numbers of real bats <b>on</b> <b>set</b> would be problematic. Dead bats were scanned to create digital models. Locations and sets were recreated on the computer so the flying bats would not be superfluous once incorporated into the finished film.|$|E
5|$|The role of Mr. Jinx the cat {{was played}} by two five-year-old Himalayan cats named Bailey and Misha (sometimes written as Meesha). The American Humane Association oversaw the filming of all scenes where the cats were used and ensured the animals' {{obedience}} and well-being by keeping two trainers and a veterinarian <b>on</b> <b>set</b> at all times.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Schaefer, {{many members}} of RKO's board of {{governors}} did not like Welles or the control that his contract gave him. However such board members as Nelson Rockefeller and NBC chief David Sarnoff were sympathetic to Welles. Throughout production Welles had problems with these executives not respecting his contract's stipulation of non-interference and several spies arrived <b>on</b> <b>set</b> to report what they saw to the executives. When the executives would sometimes arrive <b>on</b> <b>set</b> unannounced the entire cast and crew would suddenly start playing softball until they left. Before official shooting began the executives intercepted all copies of the script and delayed their delivery to Welles. They had one copy sent to their office in New York, resulting in it being leaked to press.|$|E

5|$|A July 2015 {{sighting}} of Harington arriving in Belfast, a primary filming {{location for the}} series where other actors were arriving for season 6 script read-throughs, prompted further speculation about the character's return. However, a story in Vanity Fair pointed out that Charles Dance had been seen in Belfast the previous year after his character Tywin Lannister's death as well, and he only appeared in the first episode of the subsequent season as a corpse. Another photo that showed Harington <b>on</b> <b>set</b> in Belfast in a costume that varied from the Night's Watch outfit was published on September 25, 2015. A season 6 Game of Thrones promotional poster released in November 2015 featured a bloodied Jon.|$|E
5|$|A binder {{with the}} film's storyboards {{served as a}} {{reference}} for live-action filming, shots that would be filmed {{in front of a}} chroma key blue screen, and shots that would be composed using CGI. The sets were often built with the parts that would be required on screen; often they were built only up to the heights of the actors. Chroma key was extensively used for digital set extensions, backgrounds or scenes that required cinematographer David Tattersall to seek powerful lamps to light the sets and visual effects supervisor John Knoll to develop software that would remove the blue reflection from shiny floors. Knoll, who remained <b>on</b> <b>set</b> through most of the production, worked closely with Tatterstall to ensure that the shots were suitable to add effects later. The cameras were fitted with data capture models to provide technical data for the CGI artists.|$|E

30|$|Formula (3.8) {{gives us}} a method of {{computing}} the reachable set {{in the case of}} linear systems. In this method, the computation of the reachable set is transformed into several operations <b>on</b> the <b>sets.</b> As long as the matrices of all the subsystems are invertible, the reachable set can be expressed by (3.8). It is true for linear systems, but not for nonlinear systems. From (3.8), the computation of the reachable set involves the operations performed <b>on</b> <b>sets</b> including Minkowski sum, linear transformation, and union. In addition, {{it is easy to see}} that the operation of intersection <b>on</b> <b>sets</b> is required in the computation of the viability kernel. In the following, we illustrate the processes of these operations performed <b>on</b> <b>sets</b> of polytopes.|$|R

5|$|After {{the liberation}} of France, Clouzot and several other {{directors}} were tried in court for collaborating with the Germans. For his sentence, Clouzot was forbidden from going <b>on</b> <b>set</b> of any film or from using a film camera {{for the rest of}} his life. Clouzot received letters of support from filmmakers and artists Jean Cocteau, René Clair, Marcel Carné and Jean-Paul Sartre, who were against the ruling. Clouzot's sentence was later shortened from life to two years. There is no official document making note of any apology or appeal. During his two-year banishment from filming, Clouzot worked with one of his supporters, Jean-Paul Sartre, who had been one of the first people to defend Le Corbeau.|$|E
5|$|After {{they started}} to break apart, further orders were placed for {{additional}} suits and all the suits used eventually fell apart during the four days they were used <b>on</b> <b>set.</b> In order to film one scene, McChesney wore the suit open-backed due to the damage. No optical effects were used in creating Armus. For the scene where Riker is pulled into the oil, a stuntman {{was used as a}} stand in for Jonathan Frakes. Where Riker's face emerges from the oil, it was actually a plaster cast of Frakes' face painted black. It was placed on the same grate used to lift McChesney, and filmed lifting out of the liquid. The twitching effect in Yar's death was due to a wire tied around Crosby's waist being pulled on.|$|E
5|$|Agent Carter {{was filmed}} over five days, with Gabriel Beristain serving as cinematographer. The budget {{did not allow}} for a {{storyboard}} artist to be hired, so D'Esposito, Winderbaum, and Beristain worked together to plan a shot list for the production using stand-in actors. The stunts were also pre-filmed to show the actors. D'Esposito explained that having the shots planned helped with planning the visual effects for the film. The mid-credits scene with Neal McDonough as Dum Dum Dugan was planned to show the character in a pool, but had to be changed <b>on</b> <b>set</b> to taking place beside the pool when {{it was found that}} the muscle suit McDonough wears to portray the character could not get wet.|$|E
