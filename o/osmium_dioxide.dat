500|$|The {{most common}} {{compound}} exhibiting the +8 oxidation state is osmium tetroxide. This toxic compound is formed when powdered osmium {{is exposed to}} air. It is a very volatile, water-soluble, pale yellow, crystalline solid with a strong smell. Osmium powder has the characteristic smell of osmium tetroxide. Osmium tetroxide forms red osmates [...] upon reaction with a base. With ammonia, it forms the nitrido-osmates [...] Osmium tetroxide boils at 130°C and is a powerful oxidizing agent. By contrast, <b>osmium</b> <b>dioxide</b> (OsO2) is black, non-volatile, and much less reactive and toxic.|$|E
2500|$|Osmium(VIII) oxide forms monoclinic crystals. It has a {{characteristic}} acrid chlorine-like odor. [...] The element name osmium {{is derived from}} osme, Greek for odor.

The osmium tetroxide molecule is tetrahedral and therefore non-polar. This nonpolarity helps OsO4 penetrate charged cell membranes. OsO4 is 518 times more soluble in carbon tetrachloride than in water.|$|E
50|$|<b>Osmium</b> <b>dioxide</b> is an {{inorganic}} compound with the formula OsO2. It exists as brown to black crystalline powder, but single crystals are golden and exhibit metallic conductivity. The compound crystallizes in the rutile structural motif, i.e. the connectivity {{is very similar}} to that in the mineral rutile.|$|E

40|$|In the U. S., {{the chief}} source of new osmium is copper refining, where this metal is {{produced}} as a byproduct. Probably less than 10 % of the osmium {{in the original}} copper ore is recovered, and 1000 – 3000 oz troy of osmium is lost each year to the environment as the toxic, volatile tetroxide from copper smelters. In 1971, about 2000 oz troy of osmium was domestically refined, most of which was from secondary sources. An additional 4169 oz troy of osmium was toll-refined. Major uses for osmium tetroxide identified are for catalysis, especially in steroid synthesis, and for tissue staining. Minor uses of osmium metal are for electrical contacts and for imparting hardness to alloys for mechanical pivots, etc. Unreclaimed osmium tetroxide that reaches wastewater streams is probably rapidly reduced by organic matter to nontoxic <b>osmium</b> <b>dioxide</b> or osmium metal, which would settle out in the sediment of the water course. Waste osmium metal, itself innocuous and chemically resistant, would be oxidized to the toxic tetroxide if incinerated...|$|E

Stoichiometry with compounds of arsenic, selenium, tellurium, transition and other elements. J. Bacteriol. 84 : 647 – 658. 1962. —Extracts of Micrococcus lactilyticus (Veillonella alcalescens) oxidize molecular hydrogen {{at the expense}} of certain compounds of arsenic, bismuth, selenium, tellurium, lead, thallium, vanadium, manganese, iron, copper, molybdenum, tungsten, osmium, ruthenium, gold, silver, and uranium, as well as molecular oxygen. Chemical and manometric data indicate that the following reductions are essentially quantitative: arsenate to arsenite, pentavalent and trivalent bismuth to the free element, selenite via elemental selenium to selenide, tellurate and tellurite to tellurium, lead dioxide and manganese dioxide to the divalent state, ferric to ferrous iron, osmium tetroxide to osmate ion, <b>osmium</b> <b>dioxide</b> and trivalent osmium to the metal, uranyl uranium to the tetravalent state, vanadate to the level of vanadyl, and polymolybdate ions to molybdenum blues with an average valence for molybdenum of + 5.
