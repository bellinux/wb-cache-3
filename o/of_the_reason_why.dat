5|$|Denver {{has many}} nationally {{recognized}} museums, {{including a new}} wing for the Denver Art Museum by world-renowned architect Daniel Libeskind, the second largest Performing Arts Center in the nation after Lincoln Center in New York City and bustling neighborhoods such as LoDo, filled with art galleries, restaurants, bars and clubs. That is part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> Denver was, in 2006, recognized {{for the third year}} in a row as the best city for singles. Denver's neighborhoods also continue their influx of diverse people and businesses while the city's cultural institutions grow and prosper. The city acquired the estate of abstract expressionist painter Clyfford Still in 2004 and built a museum to exhibit his works near the Denver Art Museum.|$|E
5|$|The South financed a {{much lower}} {{proportion}} of its expenditures through direct taxes than the North. The share of direct taxes in total revenue for the North was about 20%, while for the South the same share was only about 8%. A major part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> tax revenue did not play as large a role for the Confederacy was the individual states' opposition to a strong central government and the belief in states' rights which precluded giving too much taxing power to the government in Richmond. Another factor for not extending the tax system more broadly was the belief, present in both the North and the South, that the war would be of limited duration, and hence there was no compelling reason to increase the tax burden.|$|E

25|$|Part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> social liberalisaton {{was widely}} {{accepted}} by the 1990s was due to a very damaging series of scandals in that decade. The revelation that one senior Catholic bishop, Eamon Casey, fathered a child by a divorcée caused a major reaction, as did {{the discovery of a}} child abuse ring whereby offenders became clerics in order to use their position in the Roman Catholic Church to obtain access to victims—notably the infamous paedophile Father Brendan Smyth. Another bishop, McGee, subsequently resigned over his mishandling of child abuse cases in his diocese.|$|E
25|$|After {{many years}} where in Israel the wine {{industry}} was almost non-existent, {{the past twenty}} years herald a change in path. In the late eighties there were only a couple of wineries in Israel, making mostly boiled wines for sacramental use. That is part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> wines from Israel are mistakenly considered to be boiled wines and Israel is not yet considered and recognised to be a wine region as many other countries are. Over the last twenty years, the Israeli wine industry has grown tremendously and today there are around 300 wineries of different sizes in all areas of Israel.|$|E

The attack had been cancelled, {{and as a result of}} this Farran believed that he would be court-martialled for disobeying orders. This did not occur, however, and he was in fact awarded the American Legion of Merit for his actions during Tombola.|$|E
25|$|Other caustic {{medications}} include eugenol and chlorpromazine. Hydrogen peroxide, used {{to treat}} gum disease, is also capable of causing epithelial necrosis at concentrations of 1–3%. Silver nitrate, sometimes used for pain relief from aphthous ulceration, acts as a chemical cauterant and destroys nerve endings, but the mucosal damage is increased. Phenol is used during dental treatment as a cavity sterilizing agent and cauterizing material, {{and it is also}} present in some over-the-counter agents intended to treat aphthous ulcerations. Mucosal necrosis has been reported to occur with concentrations of 0.5%. Other materials used in endodontics are also caustic, which is part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> use of a rubber dam is now recommended.|$|E
25|$|Physical {{systems that}} are too {{turbulent}} to have temperatures may still differ in hotness. A physical system that passes heat to another physical system {{is said to be}} the hotter of the two. More is required for the system to have a thermodynamic temperature. Its behavior must be so regular that its empirical temperature is the same for all suitably calibrated and scaled thermometers, and then its hotness is said to lie on the one-dimensional hotness manifold. This is part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> heat is defined following Carathéodory and Born, solely as occurring other than by work or transfer of matter; temperature is advisedly and deliberately not mentioned in this now widely accepted definition.|$|E

25|$|The C-Lab programmers {{left that}} company to form Emagic, and in 1993 {{released}} a new program, Notator Logic, which attempted to fuse both track- and pattern-based operation (but looked {{much more like}} track-based sequencers than Notator). While rich in features, early versions of Logic on the Atari lacked the intuitiveness and immediacy of either Cubase or Notator, and never achieved the same success. However, {{by this time the}} Atari was becoming obsolete, and part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> Notator Logic had been written from scratch with an object oriented GUI (though it shared the same nomenclature as its predecessor) was {{to make it easier to}} port to other platforms. The Notator preface was dropped from the product name and the software became known as simply Logic.|$|E
25|$|The {{interaction}} of a loudspeaker system with its environment {{is complex and}} is largely out of the loudspeaker designer's control. Most listening rooms present {{a more or less}} reflective environment, depending on size, shape, volume, and furnishings. This means the sound reaching a listener's ears consists not only of sound directly from the speaker system, but also the same sound delayed by traveling to and from (and being modified by) one or more surfaces. These reflected sound waves, when added to the direct sound, cause cancellation and addition at assorted frequencies (e.g., from resonant room modes), thus changing the timbre and character of the sound at the listener's ears. The human brain is very sensitive to small variations, including some of these, and this is part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> a loudspeaker system sounds different at different listening positions or in different rooms.|$|E
25|$|Inflammation in {{the body}} may lead to effects on the brain via the blood-brain barrier (BBB). During {{systemic}} inflammation, whether {{in the form of}} infection or sterile inflammation, the BBB may undergo changes which may be disruptive or non-disruptive. Such changes may be part of a productive host response to systemic inflammation, or may lead to deleterious consequences within the central nervous system. These BBB changes likely {{play a role in the}} generation of sickness behaviour during systemic infection (why we feel 'unwell' when we have an infection). These changes may also induce or accelerate disease within the brain, for example in multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease, and may be part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> patients with these conditions can deteriorate during an infection. Also, in patients with neurological disease the BBB may be abnormally sensitive to the effects of systemic inflammation.|$|E

25|$|Complete and {{correctly}} copied texts {{would usually}} be immediately placed in use and thus usually would wear out fairly quickly, requiring repeated recopying. Further, because manuscript copying was highly costly when it required a scribe's attention for extended periods, a manuscript might only be made when commissioned, {{in which case}} the size of the parchment, script used, any illustrations (thus raising the effective cost), whether it was one book or a collection of several, etc. would be determined by the one commissioning the work. The idea of stocking extra copies would probably have been considered at best wasteful and unnecessary since the form and presentation of a manuscript were more often than not customized to the aesthetic tastes of the buyer. This is part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> scholars are more likely to find incomplete, and at times conflicting, segments of manuscripts than complete and largely consistent works.|$|E

While having the arena's capacity had been part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> the team went from an under-performing side to British Basketball League champions for which the team were thankful, {{part of the reason for}} the move was that due to clashes with Friday night concerts the team would have to play away from home, leading to lost revenue, with the final season seeing the team go on the road for three straight months, while the arena hosted the musical Mamma Mia!. The move also offered improved training arrangements, and enhanced pre-existing links with the university teams. The team had also only been averaging 3,000 crowds in the arena, which could hold 6,500.|$|E
25|$|After ruling Mexico {{for most}} of the past century, the return of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) brought hope to the {{supporters}} and fear to those remembering the old PRI tactics of making deals with the cartels in exchange for relative peace. According to an article published by The Economist on 23 June 2012, part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> Peña Nieto and the PRI won lies in the disappointment of the rule of the National Action Party (PAN). Buffeted by China's economic growth and the economic recession in the United States, the annual growth of Mexico's economy between 2000 and 2012 was of 1.8%. Poverty worsened, and without a ruling majority in Congress, the PAN presidents were unable to pass structural reforms, leaving monopolies and Mexico's educational system unchanged. In 2006, Felipe Calderón chose to make the battle against organized crime the centerpiece of his presidency. Nonetheless, with over 60,000 dead, many Mexican citizens are tired of a fight they had first supported.|$|E

25|$|Peter Medawar was a {{zoologist}} turned clinician, {{who specialized}} in burn trauma. A plane crash near his home changed the path of his career, turning his work with burns from mere academia to a full on quest to save lives. Medawar and a Scottish surgeon, Tom Gibson, were tasked with working the Burns Unit of the Glasgow Royal Infirmary. The first insight came when the pair decided to experiment, and grafted part of a wound with the patient's skin, and another part with skin from the patient's brother. Within days the skin grafts from the brother were completely destroyed. Successive skin grafts from the brother were destroyed even faster, a fact that gave them the evidence they needed to implicate the immune system. Medawar later repeated this experiment on rabbits and 625 surgeries later validated their initial conclusions. Medawar then set out in search <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> rabbits rejected non-self grafts.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of {{radiotherapy}} to the mouth, radiation-induced stomatitis may develop, which {{can be associated with}} mucosal erosions and ulceration. If the salivary glands are irradiated, there may also be xerostomia (dry mouth), making the oral mucosa more vulnerable to frictional damage as the lubricating function of saliva is lost, and mucosal atrophy (thinning), which makes a breach of the epithelium more likely. Radiation to the bones of the jaws causes damage to osteocytes and impairs the blood supply. The affected hard tissues become hypovascular (reduced number of blood vessels), hypocellular (reduced number of cells), and hypoxic (low levels of oxygen). Osteoradionecrosis is the term for when such an area of irradiated bone does not heal from this damage. This usually occurs in the mandible, and causes chronic pain and surface ulceration, sometimes resulting in non-healing bone being exposed through a soft tissue defect. Prevention of osteradionecrosis is part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> all teeth of questionable prognosis are removed before the start of a course of radiotherapy.|$|E
25|$|The {{climate of}} the wine region tends to dictate what style of Chenin blanc is most {{prevalent}} in the area. In the northernmost reaches of Jasnières, Chenin blanc is at its limits for cultivation with the wines being mostly dry and thin. While most of the Middle Loire experiences a continental climate, the Coteaux du Layon receives more climatic influence from the Atlantic Ocean, which promotes the development of Botrytis cinerea, than in nearby Vouvray or Montlouis. While all three AOCs produce sweet, botrytized wine there tends to be less vintage variation in the Coteaux du Layon. The cool continental influence in Montlouis and Vouvray lends itself to producing {{a wide range of}} Chenin blanc including grapes with the necessary balance of acidity to sugar needed to produce sparkling wine. In the AOC of Savennières, there is less fog and mist from the nearby rivers and more wind that makes it difficult for botrytis to take root. This is part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> Savennières is the one Loire AOC that produces predominately dry Chenin blanc. In the south of France, the warm Mediterranean {{climate of the}} Languedoc region encourages the production of much more dry styles of Chenin blanc rather than sweet.|$|E
