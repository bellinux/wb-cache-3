5|$|As dawn came, {{the army}} {{approached}} a stream called Stony Brook. The road the army took followed Stony Brook for a mile farther until it intersected the Post Road from Trenton to Princeton. However, <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> of this road, {{there was an}} unused road which crossed the farmland of Thomas Clark. The road was not visible from the Post Road, and ran through cleared land to a stretch from which the town could be entered at any point because the British had left it undefended.|$|E
25|$|Approaching Dawlish railway station, Coastguard's Cottage {{is on the}} right. Although now a café, this {{building}} {{was used by the}} railway during its construction and then sold to the coastguard. Their boat house is below the footbridge.

25|$|The Caledonia was {{considered}} a success and began serving not only the Skeena River, but also the northern coastal regions. In 1895, the Caledonia was overhauled and lengthened at Bonser's request, making her more maneuverable. Bonser named eleven of the canyons and rapids on the Skeena River, using {{the character of the}} obstacle as a guide. Among them were the Whirly Gig Rapids, Hornet’s Nest Rapids and the Devil’s Elbow Canyon where the Skeena rushed directly towards a rock bluff before twisting <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>right.</b> Despite these perils the Caledonia operated for seven seasons.|$|E
25|$|Erste Invasion (First Invasion). As {{the sound}} bombs {{continue}} to detonate, approaching signals of trumpets and trombones can be heard. Lucifer's troops, wearing {{black and red}} battle dress invade the hall, pursued by Michael's trumpeter troops, dressed in light blue and red. As the combatants move to and fro, the Lucifer troops succeed in removing some of the camouflage from the precipice, revealing a chrome bunker wall. The combat moves <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>right,</b> the bass detonations cease, the music flak falls silent, and the melancholy Wednesday segment of Eve's formula in the octophonic music suffuses the space.|$|E
25|$|The ghost floats, footless {{and with}} arms bent {{up at the}} elbows as is {{customary}} for ghost images of the period, in flames above a grassy field. Her head is framed by pine boughs. She stares <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>right,</b> her gaze following her outstretched right arm. Covering {{the palm of her}} right hand is a blue cloth on top of which rests a rolled up kakemono or makimono scroll. In her left hand she grasps a red cloth—possibly a furoshiki—which is tied up as a round, flat parcel. Peaking out over her right shoulder is the brown feathered fletching of a single arrow.|$|E

25|$|By this time, {{there were}} {{approximately}} 27,000 to 30,000 Franco-Italian {{troops in the}} bridgehead. Assembling the available troops, Eugène planned to hurl MacDonald's corps, elements of Durutte's division, and Sahuc's division at the Piavisella line. <b>Off</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>right,</b> the viceroy ordered Grenier to pin the left wing of IX Armeekorps at San Michele and Cimadolmo with Pully's and Guérin's cavalry and Abbé's infantry. The French attack got rolling in the late afternoon. Abbé's advance was counterattacked by squadrons of the Archduke Josef Hussar Regiment, the last unbroken Austrian horsemen on the field. Pully and Guérin quickly repulsed the gallant Austrian riposte and Kalnássy evacuated San Michele and Cimadolmo before Grenier's pressure. Kalnássy fell back to Tezze where he sturdily held his ground until evening, suffering 1,200 casualties during the battle.|$|E
25|$|Grenier {{instructed}} Quesnel to {{form the}} center column in two lines with skirmishers out in front. His objective was to get soldiers onto {{the east side of}} the Bärenthal ravine. Schmitz, who fought under the eye of his division commander Rouyer, was also ordered to form his men into two lines. He was to clear Mittel- and Ober-Feistritz of enemies so that the French soldiers could fire on the Austrian soldiers on {{the east side of the}} ravine. <b>Off</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>right,</b> Campi already had instructions to assist the attacks of the center and left columns as well as to attack the Austrians from the rear. From Jesenice in the upper Sava valley, Eugène directed two battalions of the Italian Guard to move north and clear away any Austrian outposts to the south of Feistritz.|$|E
25|$|Notification Center {{was added}} in the {{operating}} system. It {{provides an overview of}} alerts from applications and displays notifications until the user completes an associated action, rather than requiring instant resolution. Users may choose what applications appear in Notification Center, and how they are handled. There are three types of notifications: banners, alerts, and badges. Banners are displayed {{for a short period of}} time in the upper right corner of the Mac's screen, and then slide <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>right.</b> The icon of the application is displayed on the left side of the banner, while the message from the application will be displayed on the right side. Alerts are the same as banners, but will not disappear from the screen until the user takes action. Badges are red notification icons that are displayed on the application's icon. They indicate the number of items available for the application.|$|E

25|$|The same {{situation}} is in evidence in everyday life, however, whenever attention is fixated {{with a question}} or an experience of the amazing, the unusual, or anything that holds a person's interest. At such moments people experience the common everyday trance; they tend to gaze <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> or left, depending upon which cerebral hemisphere is most dominant (Baleen, 1969) and get that faraway or blank look. Their eyes may actually close, their bodies tend to become immobile (a form of catalepsy), certain reflexes (e.g., swallowing, respiration, etc.) may be suppressed, and they seem momentarily oblivious to their surroundings until they have completed their inner search on the unconscious level for the new idea, response, or frames of reference that will restabilize their general reality orientation. We hypothesize that in everyday life consciousness is in a continual state of flux between the general reality orientation and the momentary microdynamics of trance...|$|E

500|$|The Palisades enters Orange County {{north of}} Lake Welch Parkway at exit16 {{and south of}} the Palisades Interstate Park Commission Visitor Center, located in the center median in what was {{originally}} a parkway service area. The first interchange in Orange County is exit17 at Anthony Wayne Recreation Area. At exit18, the PIP intersects US6 and Seven Lakes Drive. US6 west heads toward the Thruway and NY17 five miles (8km) west in Harriman. US6 east forms the PIP's only concurrency for the last two miles (3km) of the PIP's run. Seven Lakes Drive joins the two routes for one mile (1.6km) before departing at exit19. The two routes then enter Bear Mountain State Park in an eastern direction. Finally, the Palisades Interstate Parkway meets its end at US9W and US202 at a traffic circle inches from the Hudson River and the Bear Mountain Bridge. US6 and US202 head east over the bridge, while US9W heads north toward the United States Military Academy in West Point.

60|$|The {{spot where}} all the party had halted must have lain some eight hundred meters from the coast; {{the sound of the}} sea came only very faintly, as from a distance.

500|$|The rest of {{the first}} wave was jumbled up. Major P.H. Pike found his A Company of the 2/17th mixed up with Captain Paul Deschamps' B Company of the 2/13th. Since the latter had further to travel, {{and there was no}} Japanese opposition, Pike agreed to hold his company back while Deschamps' moved on to his objective. Pike then moved his men inland [...] and waited for daylight. C Company's task was to seize Arndt Point, but part of it was already there, facing a steep cliff. The only platoon to {{encounter}} serious opposition was Lieutenant C. Huggett's platoon, which had veered <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>right,</b> and landed on Scarlet Beach near the mouth of the Song River. It came under fire from two Japanese machine gun posts there. With the help of an American Amphibian Scout, Lieutenant Herman A. Koeln, Huggett attacked the posts with grenades and small arms. Another Amphibian Scout, Lieutenant Edward K. Hammer, encountered a party of Japanese that he fired on. Koeln and Hammer were conspicuous because they were carrying the [...] red canvas signs to mark the beach. The beachmaster, Lieutenant Commander J. M. Band, was fatally wounded making his way to Scarlet Beach. He was posthumously awarded the US Navy Cross.|$|E
2500|$|Bonser named {{eleven of}} the canyons and rapids on the Skeena River, using the {{character}} of the obstacle as a guide. Among them were the Whirly Gig Rapids, Hornet’s Nest Rapids and the Devil’s Elbow Canyon, where the Skeena rushed directly towards a rock bluff before twisting <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>right.</b> Despite these perils the Caledonia operated for seven seasons until the HBC replaced her with a new sternwheeler in 1898, also named the Caledonia. By this time, the Klondike Gold Rush was in full swing and there was more interest in the north than ever previously. Robert Cunningham had prospered during this period and now owned a cannery and a lumber mill. He decided that a sternwheeler would be a fine addition to his enterprises, and he bought the Monte Cristo and hired Captain Bonser away from the HBC to pilot it. The HBC built a second sternwheeler, the Strathcona, and were little concerned about Cunningham’s rival vessel.|$|E
2500|$|He {{was posted}} to No. 40 Squadron in {{northern}} France, flying a Nieuport 23 single-seat fighter, {{and became a}} balloon buster with his first aerial victory on 7 May 1917. He would score twice more in June and July, driving down two Albatros D.IIIs. He then transferred to No. 24 Squadron, flying a S.E.5a fighter. He began his tenure with them with his greatest feat. On 15 March 1918, Redler was leading four other No. 24 Squadron pilots on patrol. He passed {{to the east of}} a westward bound patrol of six German aircraft—three Albatros fighters and three Fokker triplanes. With the sun behind them, the British patrol dove upon a surprised sextet of Germans from Jasta 12. Redler fired at the highest flying of the triplanes, pressing his attack to a near-collision while pumping 40 rounds into its cockpit. The triplane stalled in flight, falling <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> and spiralling down out of the dogfight into a forced landing. Redler claimed an [...] "out of control" [...] victory over it. However, Tutschek had apparently been rendered insensible during the fight, and was found dead in his landed aircraft under puzzling circumstances. Redler had killed one of Germany's leading aces. Redler ran off a string of six more victories by 20 April. The following day, he was wounded in action. He was relieved from his combat posting and returned to England.|$|E
