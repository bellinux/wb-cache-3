5|$|A {{wide variety}} of weather can be found along an {{occluded}} front, with thunderstorms possible, but usually their passage {{is associated with a}} drying of the air mass. Within the occlusion of the front, a circulation of air brings warm air upward and sends drafts of cold air downward, <b>or</b> <b>vice</b> <b>versa</b> depending on the occlusion the front is experiencing.

40|$|The Curie {{temperature}} of diluted magnetic semiconductor (DMS) nanowires and nanoslabs is investigated using the mean-field model. The Curie temperature in DMS nanowires {{can be much}} larger than that in corresponding bulk material due to the density of states of one-dimensional quantum wires, and when only one conduction subband is filled, the Curie temperature is inversely proportional to the carrier density. The T-C in DMS nanoslabs {{is dependent on the}} carrier density through the number of the occupied subbands.

5|$|Eye {{color is}} {{considered}} a subset of coloring, and coat color definitions often include standards for the eyes, as many genes which control eye color will also affect the coat color <b>or</b> <b>vice</b> <b>versa.</b> The American Fancy Rat and Mouse Association (AFRMA) lists black, pink, ruby, and odd-eyed (two different-colored eyes) as possible eye colors, depending on the variety of rat shown.

5|$|Initial {{grouping}} {{of several of}} the highland terriers (including the Scottie) under the generic name Skye Terriers caused some confusion in the breed’s lineage. There is disagreement over whether the Skye Terriers mentioned in early 16th century records actually descended from forerunners of the Scottie <b>or</b> <b>vice</b> <b>versa.</b> It is certain, however, that Scotties and West Highland White Terriers are closely related—both their forefathers originated from the Blackmount region of Perthshire and the Moor of Rannoch. Scotties were originally bred to hunt and kill vermin on farms and to hunt badgers and foxes in the Highlands of Scotland.|$|E
