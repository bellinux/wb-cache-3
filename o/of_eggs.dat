5|$|The number <b>of</b> <b>eggs</b> laid {{depends on}} species, with batch sizes ranging {{from two to}} several dozen. The total number <b>of</b> <b>eggs</b> {{produced}} in a female's lifetime (fecundity) varies from around one hundred to several thousand. In some species, the flea lives in the nest or burrow and the eggs are deposited on the substrate, but in others, the eggs are laid on the host itself and can easily fall off onto the ground. Because of this, areas where the host rests and sleeps {{become one of the}} primary habitats <b>of</b> <b>eggs</b> and developing larvae. The eggs take around two days to two weeks to hatch. Experiments have shown that fleas lay more eggs on hosts which have limited food intakes, and that eggs and larvae survive better under these conditions, perhaps because the host's immune system is compromised.|$|E
5|$|The {{reproductive}} system of female insects {{consist of a}} pair of ovaries, accessory glands, one or more spermathecae, and ducts connecting these parts. The ovaries are made up of a number of egg tubes, called ovarioles, which vary in size and number by species. The number <b>of</b> <b>eggs</b> that the insect is able to make vary by the number of ovarioles with the rate that eggs can develop being also influenced by ovariole design. Female insects are able make eggs, receive and store sperm, manipulate sperm from different males, and lay eggs. Accessory glands or glandular parts of the oviducts produce a variety of substances for sperm maintenance, transport and fertilization, as well as for protection <b>of</b> <b>eggs.</b> They can produce glue and protective substances for coating eggs or tough coverings for a batch <b>of</b> <b>eggs</b> called oothecae. Spermathecae are tubes or sacs in which sperm can be stored between the time of mating and the time an egg is fertilized.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the {{construction}} of dams on the Missouri, pallid sturgeon migrated hundreds of miles upstream to spawn, and sought out rocky or hard surfaces to deposit hundreds of thousands <b>of</b> <b>eggs.</b> One female pallid sturgeon caught in the upper Missouri River was estimated to be carrying 170,000 eggs, representing over 11 percent of its total body weight. After fertilization, pallid sturgeon eggs hatch in 5 to 8 days, after which the larvae drift back downstream for several weeks. As the larvae develop tails, they seek out slower-moving waterways and slowly mature over a period of a dozen years. The rate of survival to maturity for pallid sturgeon larvae is extremely low, and of the hundreds of thousands <b>of</b> <b>eggs</b> spawned, only a few live to adulthood.|$|E

Therefore, unadjustedpH wastewater was used with an initial lead concentration of about 2. 365 mg/L, initial pH of 1. 35 - 1. 45. Unadjusted pH wastewater decreased the use of expensive chemical reagent for adjusting pH and reducedchemical residues in the environment due to basic properties <b>of</b> <b>egg</b> shell which immediately increased the pH of solution.
