A total of 190 5 th grade students were assigned to three different conditions: surface salience analogical reasoning without the use of <b>on-line</b> learning (<b>condition</b> 1), the same surface salience analogical reasoning with <b>on-line</b> learning (<b>condition</b> 2), and relational salience analogical reasoning with <b>on-line</b> learning (<b>condition</b> 3). Results indicate that condition 2 significantly outperformed condition 1, regardless of the progression of scientific concept construction and analogical reasoning. Condition 2 performed at the same level that condition 3 did, regardless of the progression of scientific concept construction and analogical reasoning. The stepwise regression indicated that the best predictor for scientific concept construction is analogical reasoning followed by scientific reasoning. This study highlights the idea that on-line learning benefits students more than classroom learning, surface salience analogical reasoning is as efficient as relational salience analogical reasoning, and analogical reasoning can better predict scientific concept construction than can scientific reasoning.

Over {{the course of}} several tutorials, 157 students were randomly allocated to one of the two teaching methods: face-to-face or on-line.
