40|$|Unconditional alpha {{estimates}} are biased when conditional beta covaries with market risk premia (“market-timing”) or volatility (“volatility-timing”). We demonstrate an additional bias (“overconditioning”) {{that can occur}} any time an empiricist uses a risk proxy not in the investor information set — for example when asset payoffs are nonlinear and the conditional loading is proxied by contemporaneous realized beta. Calibrating to U. S. equity returns, volatility-timing and <b>overconditioning</b> plausibly impact alphas much more than market-timing, {{which has been the}} focus of prior literature. A variety of instrumental variables estimators using realized betas can substantially correct market- and volatility-timing biases, while eliminating <b>overconditioning.</b> Empirically, appropriate instrumentation reduces momentum alphas by 20 - 40 % relative to unconditional, whereas overconditioned alphas overstate performance by up to 2. 5 times. Volatility-timing inflates unconditionally estimated momentum alpha because the formationperiod market return (i) positively predicts holding-period beta (Grundy and Martin, 2001) and (ii) negatively predicts holding-period market volatility (French, Schwert, and Stambaugh...|$|E
40|$|Reliable {{information}} about hydrological behavior {{is needed for}} water‐resource management and scientific investigations. Hydrological signatures quantify catchment behavior as index values, and can be predicted for ungauged catchments using a regionalization procedure. The prediction reliability is affected by data uncertainties for the gauged catchments used in prediction and by uncertainties in the regionalization procedure. We quantified signature uncertainty stemming from discharge data uncertainty for 43 UK catchments and propagated these uncertainties in signature regionalization, while accounting for regionalization uncertainty with a weighted‐pooling‐group approach. Discharge uncertainty was estimated using Monte Carlo sampling of multiple feasible rating curves. For each sampled rating curve, a discharge time series was calculated and used in deriving the gauged signature uncertainty distribution. We found that the gauged uncertainty varied with signature type, local measurement conditions and catchment behavior, with the highest uncertainties (median relative uncertainty ± 30 – 40 % across all catchments) for signatures measuring high‐ and low‐flow magnitude and dynamics. Our regionalization method allowed assessing the role and relative magnitudes of the gauged and regionalized uncertainty sources in shaping the signature uncertainty distributions predicted for catchments treated as ungauged. We found that (1) if the gauged uncertainties were neglected {{there was a clear}} risk of <b>overconditioning</b> the regionalization inference, e. g., by attributing catchment differences resulting from gauged uncertainty to differences in catchment behavior, and (2) uncertainty in the regionalization results was lower for signatures measuring flow distribution (e. g., mean flow) than flow dynamics (e. g., autocorrelation), and for average flows (and then high flows) compared to low flows. Key Points:We quantify impact of data uncertainty on signatures and their regionalizationMedian signature uncertainty ± 10 – 40 %, and highly variable across catchmentsNeglecting gauging uncertainty causes <b>overconditioning</b> of regionalizatio...|$|E

Currently, the metabolic syndrome gains much attention in human medicine. Research shows that the adipose tissue itself plays a crucial role in the increased susceptibility of obese people to a range of health problems, with cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus as the most important problems. The purpose of the present paper is to describe the human metabolic syndrome and the fat cow syndrome with emphasis on both the similarities and differences. It may lead to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of the fat cow syndrome, giving rise to innovative insights into how to improve the management of modern dairy cows in the transition period...|$|E
40|$|Continuous-time {{stochastic}} volatility {{models are}} becoming a more and more popular way to describe moderate and high-frequency financial data. Recently, Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard (2001 a) proposed a class of models where the volatility behaves according to an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, driven by a positive Levy process without Gaussian component. They also consider superpositions of such processes and we extend that to the inclusion of an uncorrelated component. Our aim is to design and implement practically relevant inference methods for such models, within the Bayesian paradigm. The algorithm is based on Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and we use a series representation of Levy processes. Inference for such models {{is complicated by the}} fact that parameter changes will often induce a change of dimension in the representation of the process and the associated problem of <b>overconditioning.</b> We avoid this problem by dependent thinning methods. An application to stock price data shows the models perform very well, even in the face of data with rapid changes, especially if a superposition of processes is used. After introducing some extra flexibility, the model can even be used to describe spot interest rate data with considerable success.

40|$|Copyright © 2014 American Society of Civil EngineersWater {{distribution}} system model parameter calibration {{is an important}} step to obtain a representative system model, such that it may be applied to understand system operational performance, often in real time. However, few approaches have attempted to quantify uncertainty in calibrated parameters, model predictions, and consider the sensitivity of model predictions to uncertain parameters. A probabilistic Bayesian approach is applied to calibrate and quantify uncertainty in the pipe roughness groups of an Epanet 2 hydraulic model of a real-life water distribution network. Within the applied Bayesian framework, the relative performance of formal and informal Bayesian likelihoods in implicitly quantifying parameter and predictive uncertainty is considered. Both approaches quantify posterior parameter uncertainty with similar posterior distributions for parameter values (mean and standard deviation). However, the uncertainty intervals identified with the informal likelihood are too narrow, regardless of the behavioral threshold applied to derive these bounds. In contrast, the formal Bayesian approach produces more realistic 95 % prediction intervals based on their statistical coverage of the observations. This results as the error model standard deviation is jointly inferred during calibration, which also helps to avoid potential <b>overconditioning</b> of the posterior parameter distribution. However, posterior diagnostic checks reveal that the prediction intervals are not valid at percentiles other than the 95 % interval as the assumptions of normality, residual homoscedasticity, and noncorrelation, often assumed in hydraulic model calibration, do no hold. More robust calibration requires the development of error models better suited to the nature of residual errors found in water {{distribution system}} models.

40|$|The partial {{selection}} of high milk yield in dairy breeding {{led to an}} enormous increase of milk yield {{but a series of}} sanitaryproblems within the dairy cattle stocks, too. Cows with high milk yield show a low level of insulin. Insulin occupies a central position in the metabolic arrangement for milk yield, fertility and metabolism by regulating metabolic arrangements. To counteract this trend in dairy cattle selection, the glucose-tolerance-test ought to determine the individual copability of metabolism regulation and with that to mark the breeding animal´s typ of metabolism. Thereby important additional information for breeding valuation could be determine {{but it is clear that}} the results of the glucose-tolerance-test are influenced by several factors. It exists a need for standartisation of the tests to get to reproducable results for a single animal and a whole group of animals. This experimaental study examines the influences of of feeding, body condition and acute stress on the results of the glucose-tolerance-test under consideration of gender and age. 23 GTT´s have been carried out in a period of six months with six bulls, six oxen and six heifers. The animals were on average age of 9. 2 months in the beginning and 14. 8 months in the end of the tests. The whole period of six months was divided into three perservative phases. Each phase showed a rotation of feeding between food of high energetic potential (4 - 6 kg concentrated feed stuff plus 4 kg hay) and food with a low energy and protein (4 kg hay ad libitum). Addtionally a ratio with high protein and energy content rotated with a ratio of low energy and protein. Hunger, jealousy of food and accustical stress were used to create stress. A weekly determination of back fat thickness, live weight and a GTT was placed. The bull´s glucose half-life is significantly more constant than the glucose half-life of oxen and heifers. The is no significant difference of glucose half-life between oxen and heifers but heifers showed the affinity of shortest glucose half-life. The glucose expanse-equivalent showed no difference between the genders and is therefore not usable for comparison of GTT-results between bulls and heifers. As expected heifers are significantly fatter than bulls and oxen. There are no existing differences of the back fat thickness between bulls and oxen. The energy-supply-level influences the GTT-result significantly. The influence of feeding acts indipendently rectified from gender. Low energy feeding shows significant shorter glucose half-life in comparison to a high energy feeding. The aprupt change of ratio from high to less energy lowered the glucose half-life significantly. With a change from low to to high energy ratios showed a decrease of glucose half-life after a few weeks. Along with this effect goes an excursive increase of the back fat thickness. The way of feeding influences the results of GTT significantly by using the data of body condition. The influence of the body condition on the GTT-results rises with the increase of <b>overconditioning.</b> In this interrelation it is necessary to differ between <b>overconditioning</b> and age-caused adiposis. A high content of protein in the ratio influences the GTT-results, too. Especially a simultanious lack of energy in the ratio leads to a decrease of the basal glucose concentration and an increase of the glucose half-life. An impact on the GTT-results by using acute stress turns out to be different and addicted to the moment of occurence. Thereby an untypical developing of the glucose concentration in GTT can be caused. With bulls the acute stress significantly extent the glucose half-life but with oxen and heifers it significantly decreases. To get reproductable results the animals should be fed well balanced over at least four weeks before starting the test. Withal the body condition of the animals should range between mark 2. 5 and mark 3. 5 of the body-condition-score. Partial ratios and radical change of the ratio need to be avoided...|$|E
40|$|In {{traditional}} hydrogeological investigations, one {{geological model}} {{is often used}} based on subjective interpretations and sparse data availability. This deterministic approach usually {{does not account for}} any uncertainties. Stochastic simulation methods address this problem and can capture the geological structure uncertainty. In this study the geostatistical software TProGS is utilized to simulate an ensemble of realizations for a binary (sand/clay) hydrofacies model in the Norsminde catchment, Denmark. TProGS can incorporate soft data, which represent the associated level of uncertainty. High-density (20 m × 20 m × 2 m) airborne geophysical data (SkyTEM) and categorized borehole data are utilized to define the model of spatial variability in horizontal and vertical direction, respectively, and both are used for soft conditioning of the TProGS simulations. The category probabilities for the SkyTEM data set are derived from a histogram probability matching method, where resistivity is paired with the corresponding lithology from the categorized borehole data. This study integrates two distinct data sources into the stochastic modeling process that represent two extremes of the conditioning density spectrum: sparse borehole data and abundant SkyTEM data. In the latter the data have a strong spatial correlation caused by its high data density, which triggers the problem of <b>overconditioning.</b> This problem is addressed by a work-around utilizing a sampling/decimation of the data set, with the aim to reduce the spatial correlation of the conditioning data set. In the case of abundant conditioning data, it is shown that TProGS is capable of reproducing non-stationary trends. The stochastic realizations are validated by five performance criteria: (1) sand proportion, (2) mean length, (3) geobody connectivity, (4) facies probability distribution and (5) facies probability–resistivity bias. In conclusion, a stochastically generated set of realizations soft-conditioned to 200 m moving sampling of geophysical data performs most satisfactorily when balancing the five performance criteria. The ensemble can be used in subsequent hydrogeological flow modeling to address the predictive uncertainty originating from the geological structure uncertainty...|$|E
40|$|Ketosis is {{associated}} with many transition cow diseases and the subclinical form {{has been found to}} be a common condition in high-producing dairy cows. The objectives of this field study in the Netherlands were (1) to determine risk factors for subclinical ketosis [SCK; 1. 2 - 2. 9 mmol of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) /L of serum] and clinical ketosis (CK: >/= 3. 0 mmol of BHBA/L of serum) at 7 to 14 d in milk and (2) to assess the association of SCK and CK with production parameters at the first dairy herd improvement (DHI) testing. Twenty-three dairies were enrolled by a local veterinary practice from 2009 to 2010, and 1, 715 cows were screened for ketosis by measuring serum BHBA concentrations at 7 to 14 d in milk. Overall, 47. 2 % of cows had SCK and 11. 6 % had CK. Mixed generalized logit models with a random effect of herd were used to evaluate cow level factors associated with SCK and CK. The associations of SCK and CK with milk production parameters were tested using mixed linear models with a random effect of herd. Cows at a moderate (3. 25 - 3. 75) or fat (>/= 4) body condition score before calving were more likely to develop SCK and CK than thin (body condition score /= 3 cows had a higher risk. The quarter of the year in which a cow calved was associated with the risk for SCK and CK. For SCK quarter 1 (January-March) and quarter 2 (April-June), and for CK quarter 1, quarter 2, and quarter 3 (July-September) all increased the risk of development of the condition compared with quarter 4 (October-December). An increased yield of colostrum at first milking was associated with increasing risk for SCK and CK. Prolonged previous lactation length and dry period length were both associated with increased odds for SCK and CK. Subclinical ketosis and CK were associated with a higher milk yield, a higher milk fat percentage, and a lower milk protein percentage at first DHI test day. Overall the study reinforces previous findings that the major risk factors for both SCK and CK are increasing parity, <b>overconditioning</b> of animals prepartum, season of calving, and dry period length. In addition, previous lactation length and liters of colostrum have been identified as additional risk factors for the development of ketosis...|$|E
40|$|Insulin plays {{a central}} role in the {{transition}} period of dairy cows by influencing the glucose, lipid and protein metabolism. The effect of insulin is regulated by the secretory capacity of the pancreas and the insulin sensitivity of peripheral tissues. <b>Overconditioning</b> is known to induce insulin resistance in heifers and sheep. In the present study, we identified the effect of BCS on insulin sensitivity in 9 healthy, dry dairy cows at the end of pregnancy. To assess insulin resistance, we performed hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp (HEC) tests, generally accepted as the gold standard method, consisting of 4 consecutive insulin infusions 0. 1; 0. 5; 2 and 5 mU/kg/min. At regular time intervals during the infusions, blood glucose concentration was determined using a glucometer and the speed of a concomitant glucose infusion was adapted to keep the blood glucose concentration constant. At the end of each infusion, a steady state was maintained for at least 30 minutes. During the steady state, minor changes of the glucose infusion were necessary to maintain a normal blood glucose level. The steady state glucose infusion rate (SSGIR) was calculated as the amount glucose infused per kg bodyweight and per minute. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS. Cows had been selected to assure a good spread in BCS at the end of lactation. Four cows had a normal BCS (3 - 3. 5) and 5 cows were overconditioned (4 - 5). During the dry period, cows were fed according to the NRC requirements to avoid changes in BCS and hence confounding of the results by under- or overfeeding. The average SSGIR(±SD) was 1. 44 ± 0. 44; 8. 77 ± 2. 50; 13. 61 ± 2. 91 and 17. 92 ± 4. 16 μmol/kg/min for the insulin infusions of 0. 1; 0. 5; 2 and 5 mU/kg/min respectively. The Pearson correlation coefficient was not significant for the insulin dose of 0. 1 mU/kg/min but significant negative correlations were found between the BCS and SSGIR at insulin doses of 0. 5 (R=- 0. 906; P< 0. 01), 2 (R=- 0. 872; P< 0. 01) and 5 mU/kg/min (R=- 0. 888; P< 0. 01). The negative correlations point to a lower SSGIR for fatter cows which is indicative for a higher insulin resistance of the glucose metabolism in fatter cows. It can be concluded that at the end of pregnancy, dairy cows with a higher BCS are more insulin resistant compared to leaner cows. This insulin resistance is characterized by decreased insulin sensitivity and decreased insulin responsiveness...|$|E
40|$|Insulin plays {{a central}} role during the {{transition}} period of dairy cows by influencing glucose, lipid, and protein metabolism. At the adipose tissue, insulin stimulates lipogenesis and inhibits lipolysis, thereby regulating the circulating NEFA concentration. <b>Overconditioning</b> is known to induce insulin resistance of the glucose metabolism in dairy cows. In the present study, we identified if factors related to adiposity (BCS, BFT, NEFA concentration during the dry period) influenced insulin sensitivity of the lipid metabolism in 8 healthy dairy cows {{at the end of}} pregnancy across a range of BCS (2. 75 to 5). Hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp tests were performed consisting of 4 insulin infusions: 0. 1, 0. 5, 2, or 5 mU·kg- 1 ·min- 1. At regular time intervals during the infusions, blood glucose concentration was determined using a glucometer and the speed of a concomitant glucose infusion was adapted to keep blood glucose concentration constant. At the end of each infusion, a steady state (SS) was maintained for 30 min. During the SS, minor changes of the glucose infusion were necessary to maintain normal blood glucose level. During the SS, blood samples were taken at 10 min interval to determine SS insulin (SSIC) and NEFA (SSNEFA) concentrations. The SSIC was 8. 77 ± 3. 04; 52. 38 ± 16. 11; 339. 04 ± 122. 01; 1411. 5 ± 500. 08 μU/mL and the SSNEFA was 0. 62 ± 0. 20; 0. 26 ± 0. 08; 0. 14 ± 0. 09; 0. 11 ± 0. 08 mmol/L for the insulin infusions of 0. 1, 0. 5, 2, and 5 mU·kg- 1 ·min- 1, respectively. The SSNEFA is the resultant of both the inhibitory effect of insulin on lipolysis and the stimulatory effect of insulin on lipogenesis. To correct for different basal NEFA levels, the NEFA lowering effect of insulin was calculated as % compared with basal values. Dose response curves were created using PROC NLIN in SAS (SAS Inst. Inc., Cary, NC) to determine maximal effect and insulin dose needed to elicit half-maximal effect (logED 50). Maximal effect and logED 50 were, respectively, 0. 90 ± 0. 07 % and 1. 24 ± 0. 29 μU/mL. Effects on both parameters were analyzed using PROC MIXED in SAS, with parity as random factor and BCS, BFT, and NEFA concentration during the dry period as independent variables. Maximal effect of insulin was negatively influenced by NEFA concentrations during the dry period (β = - 0. 3065; P < 0. 05) while the effect of BFT and BCS was not significant. None of the independent variables had a significant influence on logED 50. It can be concluded that elevated NEFA concentrations during the dry period decrease the maximal effect of insulin on lipolysis and lipogenesis...|$|E
