40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} fundamental properties of an 'off-line' three-dimensional transport model, that is, a model which uses prescribed rather than predicted winds. The model is currently used primarily for studying {{problems of the}} middle atmosphere because we have not (yet) incorporated a formulation for the convective transport of trace species, a prerequisite for many tropospheric problems. The <b>off-line</b> <b>model</b> is simpler and less expensive than a model which predicts the wind and mass evolution (an 'on-line' model), {{but it is more}} complex than the two-dimensional (2 -D) zonally averaged transport models often used in the study of chemistry and transport in the middle atmosphere. It thus serves as a model of intermediate complexity and can fill a useful niche for the study of transport and chemistry. We compare simulations of four tracers, released in the lower stratosphere, in both the on- and <b>off-line</b> <b>models</b> to document the difference resulting from differences in modeling the same problem with this intermediate model. These differences identify the price to be paid in going to a cheaper and simpler calculation. The <b>off-line</b> <b>model</b> transports a tracer in three dimensions. For this reason, it requires fewer approximations than 2 -D transport model, which must parameterize the effects of mixing by transient and zonally asymmetric wind features. We compare simulations of the <b>off-line</b> <b>model</b> with simulations of a 2 -D model for two problems. First, we compare 2 -D and three-dimensional (3 -D) models by simulating the emission of an NO(x) -like tracer by a fleet of high-speed aircraft. The <b>off-line</b> <b>model</b> is then used to simulate the transport of C- 14 and to contrast its simulation properties to that of the host of 2 -D models which participated in an identical simulation in a recent NASA <b>model</b> intercomparison. The <b>off-line</b> <b>model</b> is shown to be somewhat sensitive to the sampling strategy for off-line winds. Simulations with daily averaged winds are in very good qualitative agreement but are less diffusive than when driven with instantaneous winds sampled at half-hour intervals. Simulations with the off-line and 2 -D models are quite similar in the middle and upper stratosphere but behave quite differently in the lower stratosphere, where the 3 -D model has a substantially more vigorous circulation. The <b>off-line</b> <b>model</b> is quite realistic in its simulation of C- 14. While there are still systematic differences between the 3 -D calculation and the observations, the differences seem to be substantially reduced when compared with the body of 2 -D simulations documented in the above mentioned NASA intercomparison, particularly at 31 deg N...|$|R

Neural network and neuro-fuzzy models are the most popular tools, but they do not embed physical knowledge. On the other hand, current physically-based models are too complex for industrial application and are less efficient than neural networks. A combination of neuro-fuzzy and physically-based models has therefore been developed, which is termed a “hybrid model”. The hybrid model has been applied to predict flow stress and microstructural evolution during thermomechanical processing. Comparison with experimental data shows generally good agreement for Al– 1 % Mg alloy deformed under thermomechanical processing conditions.

40|$|Efficient {{disturbance}} detection {{is important}} for power system security and stability. In this paper, a new detection method is proposed based on a time series analysis technique known as k nearest neighbor (kNN) analysis. Advantages of this method are that it {{can deal with the}} electrical measurements with oscillatory trends and can be implemented in real time. The method consists of two stages which are the <b>off-line</b> <b>modelling</b> and the on-line detection. The off-line stage calculates a sequence of anomaly index values using kNN on the historical ambient data and then determines the detection threshold. Afterwards, the on-line stage calculates the anomaly index value of presently measured data by readopting kNN and compares it with the established threshold for detecting disturbances. To meet the real-time requirement, strategies for recursively calculating the distance metrics of kNN and for rapidly picking out the kth smallest metric are built. Case studies conducted on simulation data from the reduced equivalent model of Great Britain power system and measurements from an actual power system in Europe demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method...|$|E
40|$|To meet future {{emission}} targets, {{it becomes}} increasingly important {{to optimize the}} synergy between engine and aftertreatment system. By using an integrated control approach minimal fluid (fuel and DEF) consumption is targeted within the constraints of emission legislation during real-world operation. In such concept, the on-line availability of engine-out NOx emission is crucial. Here, {{the use of a}} Virtual NOx sensor can be of great added-value. Virtual sensing enables more direct and robust emission control allowing, for example, engine-out NOx determination during conditions in which the hardware sensor is not available, such as cold start conditions. Furthermore, with use of the virtual sensor, the engine control strategy can be directly based on NOx emission data, resulting in reduced response time and improved transient emission control. This paper presents the development and on-line implementation of a Virtual NOx sensor, using in-cylinder pressure as main input. The development steps from <b>off-line</b> <b>modelling,</b> calibration and validation towards real-time on-line implementation and validation will be presented in great detail. The Virtual NOx sensor is validated on a state-of-the-art EURO-VI Heavy Duty Diesel Engine. Steady-state validation results show that the performance of the Virtual NOx sensor is similar to the physical NOx sensor. Transient load ramp tests and frequency response function evaluation both show improved transient response from the Virtual NOx sensor. Furthermore, the Virtual NOx sensor is successfully applied as substitute for the physical NOx sensor as input to the air path controller over a transient cycle. These validation results demonstrate the application of the Virtual NOx sensor for engine control and show the potential for improved transient emission control...|$|E

40|$|Various {{techniques}} {{are used by}} modellers in order to overcome difficulties inherent to the modelling of biogeochemical cycles over long time periods. <b>Off-line</b> <b>modelling</b> or asynchronous coupling are among the popular methods used for this purpose. In some other cases the numerical scheme used for the transport of tracers may differ from that used for the active variables (temperature T and salinity S) in order to guarantee positivity or conservation, or {{to get rid of}} spurious oscillations. These techniques imply that the different scalars in the model may be subject to slightly different numerical transport equations. It is highly desirable that the chosen method be assessed as it might strongly affect the ocean ventilation rate as actually experienced by the tracers. However the available techniques allowing to test for the consistency of the chosen method suffer from strong limitation. A salinity tracer essentially provides information about surface processes. Age tracers constitute interesting diagnosis tools but their use is impeded by the need of long-duration experiments. In this work we show how a simple tracer, the solubility oxygen, offers an easy way of testing the coherency of the numerical model. It is straightforward to implement and provides at once informations on surface as well as deep ocean processes without calling for additional experiments. Due to the nonlinearity of O 2 solubility,mixing of different water masses may only result in a body of water slightly oversatured with respect to the final T and S. A solubility oxygen tracer, not affected by biological processes, is included in the transport model. This tracer obeys the same solubility equation as oxygen but its piston velocity is very large, so that surface waters in the model are at equilibrium with the atmosphere. By comparing the solubility oxygen distribution to the theoretical oxygen saturation obtained from the model temperature and salinity fields a clear diagnostic of the ability of the tracer model to correctly reproduce the ventilation scales of the OGCM may be drawn. This procedure is applied to transport models forced by the outputs of different OGCMs. Reasons for departures are investigated and discussed. We then present a method based on age tracers which allow to improve the consistency between the OGCM and the tracer model ocean ventilation rates...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the development of}} self adaptive flight controller for an unmanned helicopter system under hovering manoeuvre. The neural network (NN) based model predictive control (MPC) approach is utilised in this work. We use this controller due to its ability to handle system constraints and the time varying nature of the helicopter dynamics. The non-linear NN based MPC controller is known to produce slow solution convergence due to high computation demand in the optimisation process. To solve this problem, the automatic flight controller system is designed using the NN based approximate predictive control (NNAPC) approach that relies on extraction of linear models from the non-linear NN model at each time step. The sequence of control input is generated using the prediction from the linearised model and the optimisation routine of MPC subject to the imposed hard constraints. In this project, the optimisation of the MPC objective criterion is implemented using simple and fast computation of the Hildreth's Quadratic Programming (QP) procedure. The system identification of the helicopter dynamics is typically performed using the time regression network (NNARX) with the input variables. Their time lags are fed into a static feed-forward network such as the multi-layered perceptron (MLP) network. NN based modelling that uses the NNARX structure to represent a dynamical system usually requires a priori knowledge about the model order of the system. Low model order assumption generally leads to deterioration of model prediction accuracy. Furthermore, massive amount of weights in the standard NNARX model can result in an increased NN training time and limit {{the application of the}} NNARX model in a real-time application. In this thesis, three types of NN architectures are considered to represent the time regression network: the multi-layered perceptron (MLP), the hybrid multi-layered perceptron (HMLP) and the modified Elman network. The latter two architectures are introduced to improve the training time and the convergence rate of the NN model. The model structures for the proposed architecture are selected using the proposed Lipschitz coefficient and k-cross validation methods to determine the best network configuration that guarantees good generalisation performance for model prediction. Most NN based modelling techniques attempt to model the time varying dynamics of a helicopter system using the <b>off-line</b> <b>modelling</b> approach which are incapable of representing the entire operating points of the flight envelope very well. Past research works attempt to update the NN model during flight using the mini-batch Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) training. However, due to the limited processing power available in the real-time processor, such approaches can only be employed to relatively small networks and they are limited to model uncoupled helicopter dynamics. In order to accommodate the time-varying properties of helicopter dynamics which change frequently during flight, a recursive Gauss-Newton (rGN) algorithm is developed to properly track the dynamics of the system under consideration. It is found that the predicted response from the off-line trained neural network model is suitable for modelling the UAS helicopter dynamics correctly. The model structure of the MLP network can be identified correctly using the proposed validation methods. Further comparison with model structure selection from previous studies shows that the identified model structure using the proposed validation methods offers improvements in terms of generalisation error. Moreover, the minimum number of neurons {{to be included in the}} model can be easily determined using the proposed cross validation method. The HMLP and modified Elman networks are proposed in this work to reduce the total number of weights used in the standard MLP network. Reduction in the total number of weights in the network structure contributes significantly to the reduction in the computation time needed to train the NN model. Based on the validation test results, the model structure of the HMLP and modified Elman networks are found to be much smaller than the standard MLP network. Although the total number of weights for both of the HMLP and modified Elman networks are lower than the MLP network, the prediction performance of both of the NN models are on par with the prediction quality of the MLP network. The identification results further indicate that the rGN algorithm is more adaptive to the changes in dynamic properties, although the generalisation error of repeated rGN is slightly higher than the off-line LM method. The rGN method is found capable of producing satisfactory prediction accuracy even though the model structure is not accurately defined. The recursive method presented here in this work is suitable to model the UAS helicopter in real time within the control sampling time and computational resource constraints. Moreover, the implementation of proposed network architectures such as the HMLP and modified Elman networks is found to improve the learning rate of NN prediction. These positive findings inspire the implementation of the real time recursive learning of NN models for the proposed MPC controller. The proposed system identification and hovering control of the unmanned helicopter system are validated in a 6 degree of freedom (DOF) safety test rig. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed controller under disturbances and parameter changes of the dynamic system...|$|E

The efficiency of response and mitigation actions is directly associated {{to the accuracy of}} the volcanic ash cloud detection and modeling systems. Operational forecasts build on <b>off-line</b> coupled <b>modeling</b> systems where meteorological variables are updated at the specified coupling intervals. Despite the concerns from other communities regarding the accuracy of this strategy, the quantification of the systematic errors and shortcomings associated to the <b>off-line</b> <b>modeling</b> systems has received no attention. This paper employs the NMMB-MONARCH-ASH model to quantify these errors by employing different quantitative and categorical evaluation scores. The skills of the off-line coupling strategy are compared against those from an on-line forecast considered to be the best estimate of the true outcome. Case studies are considered for a synthetic eruption with constant eruption source parameters and for two historical events, which suitably illustrate the severe aviation disruptive effects of European (2010 Eyjafjallajökull) and South-American (2011 Cordón Caulle) volcanic eruptions. Evaluation scores indicate that systematic errors credited to <b>off-line</b> <b>modeling</b> are of the same order of magnitude that those associated to the source term uncertainties. In particular, traditional off-line forecasts employed in operational model setups can result in significant uncertainties, failing to reproduce, in the worst cases, up to 45 – 70  % of the ash cloud of an on-line forecast.

The FANC systems cancel periodic and predictable components in the primary signal. Hybrid active noise control (HANC) systems based on the combination of feedforward and feedback ANC principles are proposed. HANC systems employing finite impulse response (FIR) and infinite impulse response (HR) structures are developed. The HANC systems use low order filters and are effective in canceling the predictable components in the primary signal that are not correlated with the reference signal. Traditional <b>off-line</b> <b>modeling</b> schemes for the secondary path are inefficient in the presence of interference. A new technique for modeling the secondary path using an adaptive predictor is presented. It is shown to attenuate the interfering signal significantly during <b>off-line</b> <b>modeling</b> and to provide a good estimate of the secondary path. The idea is extended to an on-line modeling technique which is then implemented in a single-channel FANC system. The results of the computer simulations and real-time experiments reinforce that the algorithms developed in this work are feasible for practical applications. M. S. (Master of Science...|$|R

The objective {{of this paper is}} to show functional aspects of routing and wavelength assignement algorithms in WDM routing networks. Based on this classification, we compare different solutions for each category. Several challenges and trade-offs are identified. Although no algorithm in our study is a clear winner, advantages and disadvantages of several functional characteristics are discussed inorder to help a system developer make a reasonable choice among candidate algorithms.

In this paper, several reeursive partial east squares (RPLS) algorithms are proposed for on-line process modeling to adapt process changes and <b>off-line</b> <b>modeling</b> {{to deal with a}} large number of data samples. A block-wise RPLS algorithm is proposed with a moving window and forgetting factor adaptation schemes. The block-wise RPLS algorithm is also used off-line to reduce computation time and computer memory usage in PLS regression and cross-validation.

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} markerless real-time, model-based 3 D face {{tracking}} methodology. The system combines two robust and complimentary optimization-based strategies, namely active contours and mutual information template matching, {{in order to}} obtain real-time performances for full 6 dof tracking. First, robust head contour estimation is realized by means of the Contracting Curve Density algorithm, effectively employing local color statistics separation for contour shape optimization. Afterwards, the 3 D face template is robustly matched to the underlying image, through fast mutual information optimization. <b>Off-line</b> <b>model</b> building is done using a fast modeling procedure, providing a unique appearance model for each user.
