50|$|Five {{operational}} OVs were built: Columbia (OV-102), Challenger (OV-099), Discovery (OV-103), Atlantis (OV-104), and Endeavour (OV-105). A mock-up, Inspiration, currently {{stands at}} the entrance to the Astronaut Hall of Fame. An additional craft, Enterprise (OV-101), was built for atmospheric testing gliding and landing; it was originally intended to be outfitted for orbital <b>operations</b> <b>after</b> the <b>test</b> program, but it was found more economical to upgrade the structural test article STA-099 into orbiter Challenger (OV-099). Challenger disintegrated 73 seconds after launch in 1986, and Endeavour was built as a replacement from structural spare components. Building Endeavour cost about US$1.7 billion. Columbia broke apart over Texas during re-entry in 2003. A Space Shuttle launch cost around $450 million.|$|R

40|$|With the {{constant}} increase in air traffic, airports are facing capacity problems. Optimisation methods for specific airport processes {{are starting to}} be increasingly utilised by many large airports. However, many processes do happen in parallel, and maximising the potential benefits will require a more complex optimisation model, which can consider multiple processes simultaneously and {{take into account the}} detailed complexities of the processes where necessary, rather than using more abstract models. This paper focuses on one of these complexities, which is usually ignored in ground movement planning; showing the importance of the pushback process in the routing process. It investigates whether taking the pushback process into consideration can result in the prediction of delays that would otherwise pass unnoticed. Having an accurate model for the pushback process is important for this and identifying all of the delays that may occur can lead to more accurate and realistic models that can then be used in the decision making process for ground movement <b>operations.</b> <b>After</b> <b>testing</b> two different routing methods with a more detailed pushback process, we found that many of the delays are not predicted if the pushback process is not explicitly modelled. Having a more precise model, with accurate movements of aircraft is very important for any integrated model and will allow ground movement models to be of use in more reliable integrated decision making systems at airports. Minimising these delays can help airports increase their capacity and become more environmentally friendly...|$|R

40|$|The Solar Thermal Program at Sandia {{supports}} work developing dish/Stirling {{systems to}} convert solar energy into electricity. Heat pipe technology {{is ideal for}} transferring the energy of concentrated sunlight from the parabolic dish concentrators to the Stirling engine heat tubes. Heat pipes can absorb the solar energy at non-uniform flux distributions and release this energy to the Stirling engine heater tubes at a very uniform flux distribution thus decoupling {{the design of the}} engine heater head from the solar absorber. The most important part of a heat pipe is the wick, which transports the sodium over the heated surface area. Bench scale heat pipes were designed and built to more economically, both in time and money, test different wicks and cleaning procedures. This report covers the building, testing, and post-test analysis of the sixth in a series of bench scale heat pipes. Durability heat pipe No. 6 was built and tested {{to determine the effects of}} a high temperature bakeout, 950 C, on wick corrosion during long-term operation. Previous tests showed high levels of corrosion with low temperature bakeouts (650 - 700 C). Durability heat pipe No. 5 had a high temperature bakeout and reflux cleaning and showed low levels of wick corrosion <b>after</b> long-term <b>operation.</b> <b>After</b> <b>testing</b> durability heat pipe No. 6 for 5, 003 hours at an operating temperature of 750 C, it showed low levels of wick corrosion.

40|$|The {{importance}} of robotic {{systems in the}} automation of industrial units is well known. In this paper is described the logic programming and computer control system of a robotic manipulator (IBM Scara robot) utilized in specific palletizing and assembling tasks in a machines constructions company. At low level of communication control is achieved through AML assembly routines in conjunction with C programming modules, while at user interface Prolog predicates are used for interactive and comprehensive communication. The system incorporates visual data (through a grip camera) for specific objects identification and definition of their location. Effective machine vision processing algorithms intend to strengthen the reliability of system's control and operation in real-time. Although high-level control and task planning in robotics remain a particular difficult problem, this combined approach of low and high level control and image processing algorithms, seems to ease the operator's work and ensures higher quality of <b>operation.</b> <b>After</b> long-lasting <b>tests</b> and measurements of control system's implementation the outcomes and the production results achieved (e. g. reduced errors, time and cost), have reconfirmed its effectiveness compared to previous solutions...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{combined}} {{effect of}} posteroventral pallidotomy and optimal medical treatment was assessed in 22 patients with levodopa sensitive Parkinson's disease. METHODS: Timed motor tests, video recordings, and computer assisted optoelectronic movement analysis {{were used for}} serial hourly assessments performed preoperatively and four and 12 months <b>after</b> <b>operation.</b> <b>Tests</b> were made while patients were on optimal medical therapy. RESULTS: There were no serious adverse events of surgery. Two of the 22 patients could not complete all the <b>tests</b> <b>after</b> <b>operation.</b> The proportion of dyskinesia periods decreased in the 20 patients {{and there was a}} proportional increase in normal or fairly normal occasions. "Off" periods were not significantly affected. In 12 of 13 patients with limb dyskinesia this symptom was completely abolished in the contralateral limbs. There was also some degree of improvement axially and ipsilaterally. Tremor was moderately improved contralaterally. Bradykinesia remained unchanged. Results at 12 months follow up were similar to those at four months. CONCLUSION: Pallidotomy produced a pronounced positive effect on dyskinesia and a moderate effect on tremor. Bradykinesia was not affected. Posteroventral pallidotomy may be useful in patients with Parkinson's disease who have severe motor fluctuations and may allow an increase in levodopa dose to alleviate bradykinesia in "off" states...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe present work {{provides}} {{a detailed analysis}} of already published reports on the observation of an anomalous force in a vacuum associated with vacuum sparks in asymmetric capacitors charged with “constant” high voltages. Known experimental details of these experiments are put forward and propulsion performance is compared with the only known propulsion system known to exist in a vacuum associated with sparks: the vacuum arc thruster (VAT). VAT's are known for decades and work on principles of momentum conservation. They vaporize particles from the electrodes themselves through a high spark current in one direction in order to develop a thrust in the opposite direction. However, the known performance trend for these thrusters does not account for the vacuum spark force values published by NASA. Furthermore, they have not observed the electrode erosion usually associated with VAT <b>operation,</b> even <b>after</b> extended <b>testing.</b> Therefore it is possible that a new propulsion mechanism might be at work, but that should be verified and confirmed experimentally in the future in order to resolve the question...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} therapeutic {{effects of}} dacryocystorhinostomy combined lacrimal laser plasty and silicone intubation implantation for lacrimal duct with multi-point obstruction. METHODS: Thirty-five patients {{with one or}} more point obstruction in upper lacrimal duct received lacrimal laser plasty at first. Then, when the obstruction was broken, modified surgery of dacryocystorhinostomy combined silicone intubation implantation in the both lacrimal ductule was performed. Irrigating of the lacrimal passage was made regularly <b>after</b> <b>operation.</b> The silicone tube was extracted in 4 weeks. The follow-up time was 6 months. RESULTS: There were no intraoperation complications and the silicone tube did not fall off <b>after</b> <b>operation.</b> Irrigating <b>test</b> results of lacrimal passage showed 30 out of the 35 eyes(86 %) were cured, improved in 3 cases, 2 cases was ineffective.

40|$|Machining {{residual}} stresses correlate {{very closely with}} the cutting parameters and the tool geometries. This research work aims to investigate the effect of cutting speed, feed rate and depth of cut on the surface residual stress of steel AISI 1045 <b>after</b> face milling <b>operation.</b> <b>After</b> each milling <b>test,</b> the residual stress {{on the surface of}} the workpiece was measured by using X-ray diffraction technique. Design of Experiment (DOE) software was employed using the response surface methodology (RSM) technique with a central composite rotatable design to build a mathematical model to determine the relationship between the input variables and the response. The results showed that both the feed rate and the cutting speed are the significant factors controlling the surface residual stress, while the depth of cut had no influence. A quadratic empirical model was developed with a 95 % confidence level, and a good agreement was found between the experimental and predicted results. A numerical optimization was then conducted through DOE program to find the optimum surface residual stress at the optimum cutting parameters, depending on the maximum desirability obtained. The optimum compressive surface residual stress (- 224. 361 MPa) was found at cutting speed of 69. 2 m/min, feed rate of 0. 4 m/min and depth of cut of 0. 4 mm...|$|R
