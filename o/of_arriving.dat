5|$|Within a year <b>of</b> <b>arriving</b> in Harbin, China, Kalep's {{son died}} {{and her husband}} disappeared. Kalep was able to support herself by working as an interpreter—she spoke Russian, German, English and Chinese—for a British general in Shenyang. She was also {{employed}} by Zhang Zuolin and later his son, Zhang Xueliang, but {{decided to return to}} Estonia in 1925. She traveled through Indonesia, Italy and France before eventually arriving in Tallinn in 1926. Soon afterwards she settled in Paris, where she studied the art of oil painting with Russian painter Alexandre Jacovleff. She married Rolf Baron von Hoeningen-Bergendorff, who was of German or Austrian descent.|$|E
5|$|About 12,500 {{species of}} insects are native to Florida, {{most of which}} {{naturally}} flew into the region from the Caribbean or Southeastern United States. An additional 1,000 {{have been identified as}} exotic. Insects create about $1 billion of damage to structures and agriculture in Florida each year. The tide <b>of</b> <b>arriving</b> insects is nearly impossible to control with the volume of goods and shipments coming into South Florida. Imported citrus is a major avenue for damaging insects. Twenty-one species have been imported and released to act as biological control agents: to impede the growth of invasive plants or counter the effects of other insects. Others, such as the Madagascan hissing cockroach (Gromphadorhina portentosa) and European cricket (Acheta domesticus) are sold as pets or fishing bait, and are then released into backyards. Similarly, aquatic invertebrates such as mussels, clams, snails, and melania find their ways into local waters from the bottoms of ships or in bilge holds. The aquarium trade also supplies enthusiasts with exotic species which are dumped or escape into waterways.|$|E
5|$|Hargest and his brigade {{took part}} in the {{subsequent}} Battle of Crete in May. The 2nd New Zealand Division was under the command of Brigadier Edward Puttick due to Freyberg taking command of Creforce, which consisted of all the Allied troops on Crete. Puttick gave Hargest's brigade the task of defending the airfield at Maleme and its easterly approaches. The 21st Battalion, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Leslie Andrew, guarded the airfield itself and a neighbouring hill, Point 107, with the other two battalions of the brigade positioned further east while Hargest situated his headquarters at some distance from the airfield. Within days <b>of</b> <b>arriving</b> on Crete, the Allied positions began to be the subject of strafing and bombing attacks by German planes as a precursor to an airborne invasion mounted by German paratroopers of the 1st Parachute Division. The bombing triggered in Hargest an occurrence of his shell shock, rendering him lethargic and confused.|$|E

5|$|Unable to {{take any}} further part in the war as an infantryman, Phillipps would {{normally}} have been repatriated to Australia, but instead engineered a transfer to the Australian Flying Corps (AFC) as adjutant of No.2 Squadron. After getting a taste of flying as a passenger, the twenty-five-year-old applied for pilot training, altering his birthdate from 1892 to 1896. The official age limit for pilots in the AFC was thirty, but the preferred age was under twenty-three. Phillipps' application was accepted in May 1917 and, after qualifying for his wings, his proficiency was considered such that in August he was attached to No.32 Squadron of the Royal Flying Corps to gain operational experience in France. Within three days <b>of</b> <b>arriving</b> he crash-landed his Airco DH.5 after it was hit by anti-aircraft fire near Ypres, but he escaped injury; {{by the time he}} completed his attachment in September he was leading combat patrols.|$|E
5|$|Within months <b>of</b> <b>arriving</b> in Washington, D.C., Fletcher was {{selected}} as the leadership liaison for the 17-member freshman class of Republican legislators. He was appointed to the Committee on Education and Workforce, and John Boehner, chair of the committee's employer/employee relations subcommittee, chose Fletcher as his vice-chair. The committee's purpose is to oversee the rules for employer-paid health plans, among other issues, and although it is rare for a freshman legislator to attain a committee leadership post, Boehner cited Fletcher's experience in the medical field and work on reforming the Kentucky health care system as reasons for the appointment. Fletcher also served {{as a member of the}} House Committees on the Budget and Agriculture. In June 1999, he sponsored an amendment to a youth violence bill that allowed school districts to use federal funds to develop curricula which included elements designed to promote and enhance students' moral character; the amendment passed 422—1. Later, Fletcher was assigned to the Committee on Energy and Commerce and {{was selected}} as chairman of the Policy Subcommittee on Health.|$|E

25|$|It is {{difficult}} or impossible to find compounds {{with more than one}} IUPAC name. This is because shorter chains attached to longer chains are prefixes and the convention includes brackets. Numbers in the name, referring to which carbon a group is attached to, should be as low as possible so that 1- is implied and usually omitted from names of organic compounds with only one side-group. Symmetric compounds will have two ways <b>of</b> <b>arriving</b> at the same name.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the optimal estimation of linear systems over unreliable communication channels with random delays. The measurements are delivered without time stamp, and the probabilities of time delays are assumed to be known. Since the estimation is time-driven, the actual time delays are converted into virtual time delays among the formulation. The receiver of estimation node stores the sum <b>of</b> <b>arrived</b> measurements between two adjacent processing time instants and also counts the number <b>of</b> <b>arrived</b> measurements. The original linear system is modeled as an extended system with uncertain observation to capture the feature of communication, then the optimal estimation algorithm of systems with uncertain observations is proposed. Additionally, a numerical simulation is presented to show the performance of this work. © 2013 The Franklin Institute...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. On {{the basis}} of {{actuated}} control method, the number <b>of</b> car <b>arrived</b> <b>of</b> the current phase and the number <b>of</b> car <b>arrived</b> <b>of</b> the next phase are considered altogether. It is decided to prolong the green time of the current phase according to {{the relationship of the}} number <b>of</b> cars <b>arrived</b> <b>of</b> the current phase and the next phase. The experience and principle of traffic control are described as knowledge here. The entire condition of intersection is consisted from classified arrived car number. The knowledge face to the controlling of isolate intersection is applied in the space of intersection state. Then a rough set is formed. Finally, signal control rule set face to every situation is made after some work was done to make one condition corresponding to one action of signal control. The results of simulation indicates that the total stop delay of cars of this signal control method based on rough set reduces 23. 1 % averagely than the fixed-time approach and reduces 9. 5 % averagely than the actuated approach in the same condition...|$|R
