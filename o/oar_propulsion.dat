50|$|Despite popular depiction, {{the turtle}} ship {{was not an}} {{extremely}} slow ship. The turtle ship had <b>oar</b> <b>propulsion</b> as well as sails, and could turn on its axis like the panokseon.

50|$|These vessels may be {{regarded}} as floating fortresses rather than true warships, and were only used in coastal actions. They used <b>oars</b> for <b>propulsion,</b> as their full iron cladding, if it existed, {{as well as their}} bulk (i.e. the armament and people they were carrying) likely impeded wind-based propulsion via sails.|$|R
5000|$|Xebecs {{were similar}} to galleys used by Algerian corsairs and Barbary pirates having both lateen sails and <b>oars</b> for <b>propulsion.</b> Early xebecs had two masts; later ones three. Xebecs {{featured}} a distinctive hull with pronounced overhanging bow and stern, [...] and rarely displaced more than 200 tons, making them slightly smaller and with slightly fewer guns than frigates of the period.|$|R

The {{absence of a}} gas release valve meant that the duke had to slash the ballonnet to prevent rupture when they reached an altitude of about 4,500 metres.|$|R

50|$|After the Treaty of Nystad in 1721, the Swedish {{high command}} {{realized}} {{the need of}} a fast and agile marine unit that could maneuver in littoral waters. A squadron based in Stockholm {{was the first to}} be created. However, the Russo-Swedish War of 1741-1743 demonstrated that the unit was too small to defeat the Russian forces. An official fleet of the army was planned, and the ships would be modeled after Mediterranean galleys and xebecs (a sailing ship hybrid with <b>oar</b> <b>propulsion).</b> These were fast and dangerous ships that were used by the Barbary pirates off the coast of North Africa. The Swedish galleys were redesigned, and made smaller.|$|E

50|$|At {{the start}} of August 1759, the Swedish {{squadron}} under Ruthensparre moved into the Oder, moving towards the Stettin lagoon. On 8 August it forced the defences of Peenemünde and penetrated the western half of the lagoon (called Kleines Haff, or Little Lagoon, by the Germans). On 22 August the Swedes won an initial engagement against a fleet under captain von Köller off Anclam. On 10 September, the two fleets again faced each other, near Neuwarp. The Swedish ships commanded by Wilhelm von Carpellan were ranged in 4 lines - in the first were the most powerful ships (four 13-gun galleys armed), then four 5-gun demi-galleys (with mixed sail and <b>oar</b> <b>propulsion),</b> then 3 sloops and 1 ship with howitzers, and finally a line of 13 gunboats. For their part, the Prussians had four galiots and four galleys with 12 cannon each as well as 5 canonnières. Once within range, the Swedes placed themselves in a single line. However, the three Swedish demi-galleys and 9 gunboats sailed towards the south where unidentified sailing vessels had appeared - these {{turned out to be}} neutral ships, but this meant these Swedish ships did not take part in {{the start of}} the four-hour battle. The battle ended in a heavy Prussian defeat, with their main ships sunk or captured and more than 600 of their sailors captured, for smaller losses (13 killed and 14 wounded) on the Swedish side.|$|E
2500|$|At {{about the}} same time, the Scandinavians were also {{building}} innovative boats. People living near Kongens Lyngby in Denmark, {{came up with the}} idea of segregated hull compartments, which allowed the size of boats to gradually be increased. [...] A crew of some two dozen paddled the wooden Hjortspring boat across the Baltic Sea long before the rise of the Roman Empire. Scandinavians continued to develop better ships, incorporating iron and other metal into the design and developing <b>oars</b> for <b>propulsion.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1784 {{professor}} Jacques Charles and the Robert brothers {{built an}} elongated, steerable craft that followed Jean Baptiste Meusnier's proposals. Their design incorporated Meusnier's internal ballonnet (air cell), a rudder, and <b>oars</b> for <b>propulsion</b> which proved useless. On July 15 the brothers flew it for 45 minutes from Saint-Cloud to Meudon accompanied by M. Collin-Hullin and Louis Philippe II, the Duke of Chartres. The {{absence of a}} lifting gas release valve meant that the Duke had to slash the envelope to prevent it rupturing when they reached an altitude of about 4,500 metres (15,000 ft).|$|R
25|$|The Scandinavians were {{building}} innovative boats millennia ago, {{as shown by}} the many petroglyph images of Nordic Bronze Age boats. The oldest archaeological find of a wooden Nordic boat is the Hjortspring boat, built about 350 BC. This is the oldest known boat to use clinker planking, where the planks overlap one another. It was designed as a large canoe, 19 m long and crewed by 22–23 men using paddles. Scandinavians continued to develop better boats, incorporating iron and other metal into the design, adding keels, and developing <b>oars</b> for <b>propulsion.</b> Another Nordic shipfind is the Nydam boat, found preserved in the Nydam Mose bog in Sundeved, Denmark. It has been dendro dated to 310-320 AD. Built of oak, it is also clinker-built, is 23 metres long and was rowed by thirty men.|$|R
5000|$|An oar is an {{implement}} used for water-borne <b>propulsion.</b> <b>Oars</b> have a flat blade at one end. Rowers grasp the oar {{at the other}} end. The difference between oars and paddles are that paddles are held by the paddler, and are not connected with the vessel. Oars generally {{are connected to the}} vessel by means of rowlocks or tholes which transmit the applied force to the boat. In this system (known as a second class lever) [...] the water is the fulcrum.|$|R
