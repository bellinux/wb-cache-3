40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a comparison of}} web crippling tests of cold-formed unlipped channels with flanges restrained or unrestrained. The tests were performed under end and interior two-flange loading conditions specified in the Australian/New Zealand Standard (AS/NZS 4600, 1996) and the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI, 1996) Specification for cold-formed steel structures, namely End-Two-Flange (ETF) and Interior-Two-Flange (ITF) loading conditions. The concentrated load was applied by a bearing plate at <b>the</b> top flange <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>channels,</b> and <b>the</b> reaction force applied by an identical bearing plate at <b>the</b> bottom flange <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>channels.</b> <b>The</b> bearing plates acted across the full flange widths <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>channels.</b> <b>The</b> flanges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>channels</b> were bolted to the bearing plates for the specimens with flanges restrained. The web crippling test strengths are compared with the current design strengths obtained using the AS/NZS 4600 and the AISI Specification. It is shown that the design strengths predicted by the specifications are unconservative for <b>the</b> tested <b>channels</b> with flanges restrained or unrestrained. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

5|$|While her {{half-sister}} , normally flagship <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Channel</b> Squadron, was refitting in 1873–75, Agincourt, {{normally the}} flagship {{of the fleet}} second-in-command, replaced her as flagship and Northumberland became flagship of the second-in-command until Minotaurs return to duty. She served as the flagship for Rear Admirals George Hancock and Lord John Hay. Northumberland received her own refit and rearmament from 1875–79 and rejoined the Channel Squadron upon its completion. The ship was paid off in 1885 for another refit and became the flagship of Vice Admirals Sir William Hewett and John Baird, successive commanders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Channel</b> Squadron, upon her completion in 1887.|$|E

Warrior was transferred to the 1st Cruiser Squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet in 1913.|$|E
5|$|As the geyser fills, {{the water}} {{at the top of}} the column cools off, but because of the narrowness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>channel,</b> {{convective}} cooling of the water in the reservoir is impossible. The cooler water above presses down on the hotter water beneath, not unlike the lid of a pressure cooker, allowing the water in the reservoir to become superheated, i.e. to remain liquid at temperatures well above the standard-pressure boiling point.|$|E

5|$|Assuming this {{warning shot}} {{had been fired}} {{in the belief that}} his brig, which was not flying a flag, may be an enemy vessel, Barlow ordered the British naval ensign and the pennant <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Channel</b> Fleet run up.

The French battery responded by raising tricolour flags and red pennants, a move copied by the other batteries covering the Goulet. Having drifted much closer to two batteries Childers suddenly came under heavy fire, the batteries containing very large 48-pounder cannon.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I in August 1914, Lord Nelson became flagship <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Channel</b> Fleet and was based at Portland.

5|$|Because it {{was used}} as a water supply for agriculture, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>channel</b> {{remained}} in water, although bridges were lowered. Since the 1970s, the Grantham Canal Society have been working towards its restoration, and two stretches are navigable to small vessels. Full restoration will require a new route where the canal joins the Trent, as road building has effectively severed the original route.|$|E
