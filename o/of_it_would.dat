5|$|Quatre Bras was a hamlet at a {{strategic}} crossroads {{on the road}} to Brussels. French control <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> not only threaten the city, but divide Wellington's allied army from Blucher's Prussians. At 14:00 on 16 June 1815, after some initial skirmishing, the main French force under Marshall Ney, approached Quatre Bras from the south. They came up against the 2nd Netherlands Division who had formed a line well in advance of the crossroads. Facing three French infantry divisions and a cavalry brigade, the Dutch and Nassau troops were forced back but did not break. Reinforcements arrived at 15:00, being a Dutch cavalry brigade, Picton's 5th British Division, followed closely by the Brunswick Corps. The sharpshooters of the Brunswick Advance Guard regiment were sent to support Dutch skirmishers in Bossou Wood on the allied right (western) flank; the rest of the corps took up a reserve position across the Brussels road. The Duke reassured his inexperienced troops by walking up and down in front of them, calmly puffing on his pipe.|$|E
5|$|Since all {{isotopes}} of neptunium have half-lives {{that are}} many times {{shorter than the}} age of the Earth, any primordial neptunium should have decayed by now. After only about 80 million years, the concentration of even the longest lived isotope, 237Np, would have been reduced to less than one-trillionth (10−12) of its original amount; and even if the whole Earth had initially been made of pure 237Np (and ignoring that this would be well over its critical mass of 60kg), 2100 half-lives would have passed since the formation of the Solar System, and thus all <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have decayed. Thus neptunium is present in nature only in negligible amounts produced as intermediate decay products of other isotopes.|$|E
5|$|The 1920s saw high {{inflation}} and large public deficits. Several public committees were created solely to cut costs. One such proposal {{was to build}} a road to Flåm, with the proposal being led by Hans Kristian Seip, who was director of Bergen Public Road Administration. In 1925, following the appointment of Mowinckel's First Cabinet, it was proposed that the railway be built as a road, and the tracks laid later. One of NSB's board members proposed instead building a suspended railway. The plans to cancel the railway were stopped because of parliamentarian support for the railway. Part of the political support was because there was agreement on a national railway plan, and removing parts <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> disrupt the geographical compromise. However, Parliament did vote {{to reduce the number}} of intermediate stations to one, which would allow trains to meet at Berekvam. The cost saving for a road was estimated at 30 percent. The issue of a road was taken up in a new vote in Parliament in 1927, but was again rejected.|$|E

5|$|The longest-lived isotope of curium, 247Cm, has a {{half-life}} of 15.6 million years. Therefore, any primordial curium, that is curium {{present on}} the Earth during its formation, should have decayed by now, although some <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be detectable as an extinct radionuclide as an excess of its nearly stable daughter 235U. Curium is produced artificially, in small quantities for research purposes. Furthermore, it occurs in spent nuclear fuel. Curium is present in nature in certain areas used for the atmospheric nuclear weapons tests, which were conducted between 1945 and 1980. So {{the analysis of the}} debris at the testing site of the first U.S. hydrogen bomb, Ivy Mike, (1 November 1952, Enewetak Atoll), beside einsteinium, fermium, plutonium and americium also revealed isotopes of berkelium, californium and curium, in particular 245Cm, 246Cm and smaller quantities of 247Cm, 248Cm and 249Cm. For reasons of military secrecy, this result was published only in 1956.|$|E
25|$|The Virovitica–Karlovac–Karlobag {{line is a}} {{hypothetical}} boundary that describes the western extent of an irredentist nationalist Serbian state.

25|$|In the 1940s and 1950s, {{a number}} of {{researchers}} explored the connection between neurology, information theory, and cybernetics. Some of them built machines that used electronic networks to exhibit rudimentary intelligence, such as W. Grey Walter's turtles and the Johns Hopkins Beast. Many of these researchers gathered for meetings of the Teleological Society at Princeton University and the Ratio Club in England. By 1960, this approach was largely abandoned, although elements <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be revived in the 1980s.|$|E

25|$|However it {{cannot be}} stated affirmatively where {{the mind of}} an arahant exists or that it exists at all, because {{describing}} an arahant's mind in terms of existence would limit it to the confines of time and space, which Nirvana occurs outside <b>of.</b> <b>It</b> <b>would</b> be equally incorrect {{to say that the}} mind of an arahant does not exist — the Buddha said that the idea of existence or non-existence “does not apply” to the behavior of an arahant's mind. Ajaan Mun argued all of this by describing a unique class of “objectless” or “themeless” consciousness specific to Nirvana, which differs from the consciousness aggregate.|$|E

25|$|On {{the first}} play of the third quarter, Jets linebacker Kevin McArthur {{increased}} his team's lead to 28-6 by returning an interception 21 yards for a touchdown, {{which would be the}} only score of the quarter. Most <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be taken up by the Chiefs' ensuing drive, which ended with a failed fourth and 1 conversion attempt. In the fourth quarter, they finally managed to score when defensive back Albert Lewis recovered a blocked punt in the end zone for a touchdown. However, this was quickly countered on the Jets next possession as Ryan completed a 38-yard pass to Wesley Walker before finishing it with a 6-yard touchdown throw to tight end Billy Griggs (his first NFL reception). The only other score of the game would be a safety when Jets punter Dave Jennings ran out of the end zone in the game's closing minutes.|$|E

Nearby, 143 Madison went up five years later. It, too, is a Federal building, but with some exterior alterations from the later 19th century. After {{the opening of the}} Erie Canal in 1825 sparked economic growth, new residential land was sought. While most <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> come north and west of downtown, Trinity Place was opened (as Broad Street) in 1836. The first rowhouses in the future Mansion Historic District, 16–24 and 39–45a Trinity, were built in 1839–40 along with 2 Ashgrove Street nearby. David Orr, one of the wealthiest men in Albany, built the row at 57-65 Grand around the same time, the last houses in the district built in High Greek Revival style. This marks the beginning of the Mansion neighborhood as it is known today.|$|E
25|$|Kelland {{was educated}} at Repton School during World War II, {{where he was}} Head of his House and played in the school cricket team. Alongside Donald Carr, the school's captain, he was the school's main bowler, taking 43 wickets in 1944. No school side Repton played against during this period managed to make a score of at least 100 against them. After leaving Repton, he {{spent two years in}} the Royal Marines. After two years in the Marines he began his studies at the University of Cambridge. He made his {{first-class}} debut for Cambridge University Cricket Club against Sussex at Fenner's in 1949. He made eleven further first-class appearances for the university, the last of which came against Oxford University in The University Match at Lord's in 1950. In twelve first-class matches for the university, he took 26 wickets at an average of 35.46, with best figures of 3/24. With the bat, he scored 55 runs at a batting average of 9.16, with a high score of 25.

He angrily {{declares}} that her absence is to blame for the current state of his life, declaring that he is the reason Phil has left due to his homosexuality, but Kathy tells him that she and Phil knew that he was gay before he even started school, and that they have always loved him. Ian later decides to rebuild his relationship with his mother and allows Kathy to move into his house. Gavin meets Kathy in Walford and reveals that he has kidnapped Phil and threatens to kill him if she does not follow his instructions and give him money. Kathy and Ben reluctantly agree to give into Gavin's demands, but after trying to steal Ian's safe, Kathy decides not to do so. Ian later tells Kathy that her grandson Bobby Beale (Elliot Carrington) killed Lucy. Kathy, after seeing Ben drunk and angry at her, confesses to Ian that she is still on the run and she and Ben were planning to con him as Gavin has kidnapped Phil, so Ian throws her out, thinking she cares more about Phil than him. Jane is horrified that he told Kathy about Bobby, but Ian is confident she will not say anything to the police. Kathy then goes to the police station to report the kidnapping, while Ben tells Ian what Gavin has done. Ian contacts Gavin, telling him he knows what he has been doing. It is subsequently revealed that he has been keeping Phil locked in his closet, but by the time Kathy and the police come to his house looking for him, he is not there although a fresh blood stain is found in the kitchen. Kathy later tells the Beales what she has done, and Sharon is incensed when she finds out the truth, insisting none <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have happened if Kathy had not returned. Phil returns home severely injured and Ian allows Kathy to move back into his house. Gavin later holds Kathy, Ben and Phil hostage in their house and when Sharon confronts him, he reveals himself as her father before fleeing. Kathy is given a suspended sentence after pleading guilty to fraud.|$|E
