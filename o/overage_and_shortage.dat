40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study on}} selecting electricity contracts for a large-scale chemical production plant, which requires electricity importation, under demand uncertainty. Two common types of electricity contracts are considered, time zone (TZ) contract and loading curve (LC) contract. A multi-period linear probabilistic programming model is adopted for the contract selection and optimization. Hence, by using the probabilistic programming, a solution procedure is proposed that allow users {{to determine the best}} electricity contract according to their desired confident level of the uncertainties. In addition, {{due to the fact that}} the demand of product is uncertain, if one considers the <b>overage</b> <b>and</b> <b>shortage</b> of the products in the market as well, an interesting result can be obtained. The methodology is explained in the paper. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we present}} an {{analytical}} model to investigate how the optimal production strategy of new energy vehicles (NEVs) {{is influenced by}} subsidy, market fluctuation, and loss aversion. We find that a loss averse decision maker may produce more production quantity than the optimal quantity in risk neutrality under the certain conditions. We demonstrate that the expected utility is substantially influenced by subsidy, loss aversion, <b>and</b> the <b>shortage</b> cost. Although the relationship between subsidy and loss aversion is not straightforward when considering shortage cost, subsidy {{may play a role}} to regulate the possible <b>overages</b> <b>and</b> <b>shortages</b> in NEV manufacturing.

The assumptions made and formulas used in computations are presented in detail, along with a general view of the modelling approach. The model, beginning with {{the selection of a}} subject rating, calculates an estimate of the yearly gains and losses of personnel, the promotions within, and the new recruits to the rating. A policy affecting the personnel system can be quickly evaluated for its effect on <b>overages</b> <b>and</b> <b>shortages</b> of personnel, its effect on the advancement system, and the need for new personnel, for multiple years in the future.

40|$|Demand {{patterns}} for products with seasonality and or short life-cycles {{do not follow}} a clear discernible pattern (to allow predictive time-series modeling of demand) for individual sales events or seasons due to such factors as considerable demand volatility, product promotions, and unforeseen marketplace events. Suppliers supporting such atypical demand patterns typically incur higher holding costs, lower capacity utilization, and lower order fill-rates, particularly under long lead-times and uncertainty in effective capacity. Retailers {{on the other hand}} struggle with product <b>overages</b> <b>and</b> supply <b>shortages.</b> On the other hand, atypical demand settings bring huge financial opportunity to supply chain players, and are pervasive. It is suggested in the literature that an effective means to reap these benefits is through increased information sharing between retailers and suppliers, superior forecasting with forecast update techniques, proper replenishment, and custom designed inventory/manufacturing policies. We also believe that sharing of order forecasts, also known as soft-orders, in advance by the buyer could be beneficial to both parties involved. This dissertation in particular studies a two-player supply chain, facing atypical demand. Among the two-players is a buyer (retailer/distributor/vendor) that makes ordering decision(s) in the presence of upstream supply uncertainty and demand forecast revision(s). We propose a stochastic dynamic programming model to optimally deicide on soft-order(s) and a final firm-order under a deposit scheme for initial soft-order(s). While sharing of upstream soft-order inventory position information by the supplier before receiving a final order is not a common industrial practice, nor is it discussed in the literature, our analysis shows that such information sharing is beneficial under certain conditions. Second player of the supply chain is a supplier (manufacturer) that makes production release decision(s) in the presence of limited and random effective capacity, and final order uncertainty. Our stochastic dynamic programming model for optimal production release decision making reveals that substantial savings in order fulfillment cost (that includes holding, <b>overage,</b> <b>and</b> underage costs) can be realized in the presence of advance soft-order(s). Soft-orders can also be shown to improve order fill-rate for the buyer. This research explores complex interactions of factors that affect the operational decision making process, such as costs, demand uncertainty, supply uncertainty, effective capacity severity, information accuracy, information volatility, intentional manipulation of information etc. Through extensive analysis of the operational policies, we provide managerial insights, many of which are intuitively appealing, such as, additional information never increases cost of an optimal decision; many are also counterintuitive, for example, dynamic programming models cannot fully compensate for intentional soft-order inflation by the buyer, even under conditions of a stable and linear order inflation pattern, in the absence of deposits. ...|$|R
40|$|Until 1980, {{the world}} {{merchant}} fleet expanded rapidly {{in response to}} thriving seatrade markets. Since then, it has not grown much. The industry did not adjust effectively to periodic global recession, and the fleet's earnings deteriorated as the gap widened between the supply of tonnage {{and the demand for}} transport. The unpredictability of seatrade markets and the changing structure of demand for ocean transport complicated shipowners'efforts to retrench and draw up defensive strategies. Advances in ship design and ocean transport technologies allowed shipowners to adjust to the greater need for specialized vessels, but chose to retain their assets and their adoption was expensive. Most shipowners added a few new vessels after 1980, often supported by government subsidies. Government regulations created serious distortions in ocean transport and impeded free market adjustments. The most serious issues the industry faces are a critically <b>overaged</b> fleet <b>and</b> <b>shortage</b> of capital. Becauseof reduced freight earnings, maintenance has been neglected, leading to frequent structural failure. Ship casualties - often with serious envionmental damage - have reached alarming levels. The deteriorating safety record has caused insurance costs to escalate and has provoked calls for stricter liability rules, stringent technical standards, and rigorous inspection. Enforcement would make ocean transport more expensive. To meet expected demand for ocean transport safely and efficiently, a great deal of overaged tonnage must be replaced, maintenance must be improved, and new tonnage has to be added. The estimated cost: almost US$ 400 billion in constant 1992 prices. But traditional financing, through mortgage lending and government subsidy, is becoming scarce. Leasing or cashflow-based lending are promising alternatives, but they required predictable revenue streams based on long-term freight contracts predicated on cargo-owners'cooperation, which remains doubtful. No effective arrangements have been made to meet the industry's capital requirements, and doubts are more numerous than assurances in the industry. The crisis that has developed is unprecedented.

30|$|The {{original}} {{model by}} Arrow et al. (1951) maximizes the expected value of profits without resource constraints and demand substitution. Then the multi-product model is decomposable into multiple single-product models in each product {{and has a}} simple analytical closed-form optimal solution for each product. This solution {{is known as a}} fractile, described with <b>overage</b> <b>and</b> underage profits, of the arbitrary (cumulative) demand distribution function.

Owing to its simple solution with trade-off analysis between underage <b>and</b> <b>overage</b> profits, it has many applications in industries such as overbooking problems or facility capacity problems.|$|R
