5|$|Transient global amnesia is a dramatic, sudden, temporary, near-total loss <b>of</b> <b>short-term</b> memory. Various causes {{have been}} {{hypothesized}} including ischemia, epilepsy, migraine and disturbance of cerebral venous blood flow, leading to ischemia of {{structures such as}} the hippocampus {{that are involved in}} memory.|$|E
5|$|Around the {{beginning}} of the mating season, adult females move from the periphery towards the central male territories where they become part <b>of</b> <b>short-term</b> ‘harems’ that consist of a male and an unstable group of up to five females. Centrally located males are polygamous, while males on the periphery are monogamous or single. The mating system of the grey-headed flying fox is best described as a lek because males do not provide any essential resources to females and are chosen {{on the basis of their}} physical location within the roost, which correlates with male quality.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to such examples, creationists specify that they are objecting only to macroevolution, not microevolution: most creationist organizations do not dispute the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>short-term,</b> relatively minor evolutionary changes, such as that observed even in dog breeding. Rather, they dispute the occurrence of major evolutionary changes {{over long periods of}} time, which by definition cannot be directly observed, only inferred from microevolutionary processes and the traces of macroevolutionary ones.|$|E

5|$|Past {{studies have}} {{reported}} other social organizations in ruffed lemurs including monogamous pair bonding. This {{may have been due}} to the use <b>of</b> <b>short-term,</b> seasonal field studies instead of yearlong studies that take into consideration the effects that changing seasons have on ruffed lemur communities. For instance, during the cold, rainy season, which corresponds with the breeding season, interactions between core groups within a community are significantly reduced. During this time small subgroups form consisting of a mature female, a mature male, and sometimes offspring. This can be misinterpreted as monogamous pair bonding.|$|E

5|$|As {{with many}} banks around the world, the Icelandic banks found it {{increasingly}} difficult or impossible to roll over their loans in the interbank market, their creditors insisting on payment while no other banks were willing to make fresh loans. In such a situation, a bank would normally {{have to ask for}} a loan from the central bank as the lender of last resort. However, in Iceland the banks were so much larger than the national economy that the Central Bank of Iceland and the Icelandic government could not guarantee the payment of the banks' debts, leading to the collapse of the banks. The official reserves of the Central Bank of Iceland stood at 374.8 billion krónur at the end of September 2008, compared with 350.3 billion krónur <b>of</b> <b>short-term</b> international debt in the Icelandic banking sector, and at least £6.5 billion (1,250 billion krónur) of retail deposits in the UK.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the market}} {{turbulence}} of the 1990s financial crises and September 11 {{attacks on the}} U.S. in 2001, financial integration intensified among developed nations and emerging markets, with substantial growth in capital flows among banks and in the trading of financial derivatives and structured finance products. Worldwide international capital flows grew from $3 trillion to $11 trillion U.S. dollars from 2002 to 2007, primarily in the form <b>of</b> <b>short-term</b> money market instruments. The United States experienced growth in the size and complexity of firms engaged in {{a broad range of}} financial services across borders {{in the wake of the}} Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act of 1999 which repealed the Glass–Steagall Act of 1933, ending limitations on commercial banks' investment banking activity. Industrialized nations began relying more on foreign capital to finance domestic investment opportunities, resulting in unprecedented capital flows to advanced economies from developing countries, as reflected by global imbalances which grew to 6% of gross world product in 2007 from 3% in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Kent vs Lancashire at Canterbury is an oil {{on canvas}} {{painting}} by Albert Chevallier Tayler completed in 1907. It was commissioned by the Kent County Cricket Club {{at the suggestion of}} chairman Lord Harris to celebrate their first County Championship title win. Tayler painted the picture after taking individual sittings with each of the Kent players. With the exception <b>of</b> <b>short-term</b> loans, the painting remained at the St Lawrence Ground until 1999, at which time it was moved to the Lord's Pavilion as the Kent Club could no longer afford the insurance. In 2006, Kent sold the painting to a charity foundation at an auction. The piece is currently on display at Lord's Cricket Ground in London.|$|E

On November 16, 2010, he suffered a stroke, from which he largely recovered. Also at the close of 2010, a skin-grafting surgery saved his left foot from being amputated. Around this time, Shulgin began showing early signs of dementia, mostly severe loss <b>of</b> <b>short-term</b> memory. With progression of the dementia since 2010, his wife Ann Shulgin had been trying to sell part of their property to raise more money to cover care costs.|$|E
5|$|Varner {{completed}} a Bachelor of Arts in philosophy at Arizona State University in 1980, before studying for a Master of Arts in philosophy at the University of Georgia, which he completed in 1983. He read for a PhD at University of Wisconsin–Madison, writing a thesis on environmental ethics; {{this was one}} of the first on the topic. Developed versions of some of the thesis's chapters were later published as chapters 2, 3 and 4 Varner's first book, In Nature's Interests?. His doctoral research was supervised by Jon Morline, who continued as a supervisor even after leaving Madison to work at St. Olaf College. Graduating from Madison in 1988, Varner had a number <b>of</b> <b>short-term</b> jobs in the late 1980s; he lectured in philosophy at the University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point from 1987 to 1988, acted as a visiting assistant professor at Madison's Institute of Environmental Studies in the Summer of 1988, and took up the same role, this time in philosophy, at Washington University in St. Louis from 1988 to 1990.|$|E
5|$|Upon activation, ERK may phosphorylate {{a number}} of cytoplasmic and nuclear {{molecules}} that ultimately result in the protein synthesis and morphological changes observed in L-LTP. These cytoplasmic and nuclear molecules may include transcription factors such as CREB. ERK-mediated changes in transcription factor activity may trigger the synthesis of proteins that underlie the maintenance of L-LTP. One such molecule may be protein kinase Mζ (PKMζ), a persistently active kinase whose synthesis increases following LTP induction. PKMζ is an atypical isoform of PKC that lacks a regulatory subunit and thus remains constitutively active. Unlike other kinases that mediate LTP, PKMζ is active {{not just in the}} first 30 minutes following LTP induction; rather, PKMζ becomes a requirement for LTP maintenance only during the late phase of LTP. PKMζ thus appears important for the persistence of memory and would be expected to be important in the maintenance of long-term memory. Indeed, administration of a PKMζ inhibitor into the hippocampus of the rat results in retrograde amnesia with intact short-term memory; PKMζ does not {{play a role in the}} establishment <b>of</b> <b>short-term</b> memory. PKMζ has recently been shown to underlie L-LTP maintenance by directing the trafficking and reorganization of proteins in the synaptic scaffolding that underlie the expression of L-LTP. Even more recently, transgenic mice lacking PKMζ demonstrate normal LTP, questioning the necessity of PKMζ.|$|E

Jakub Kok tejn, Ph. D. Objectives: The aim of the thesis is to verify the effectiveness <b>of</b> a <b>short-term</b> {{intervention program}} for sprint speed development in young soccer players (U 15). Methods: The research sample included soccer players (15 year old; n= 12; 14, 2 ± 0, 3 years) from the highest competitive level in the Czech Republic. For the interventional effect verification we used several sprint tests (sprint on 5, 10 and 30 meters, shuttle sprint 2 x 10 meters). Data analysis was performed by using IBM SPSS software version 22. Results: In the experimental group we did not found any significant improvement in the posttest in any individual tests after completion <b>of</b> the <b>short-term</b> speed-oriented intervention. Based on our results we note that we have failed to verify the effectiveness <b>of</b> the <b>short-term</b> intervention program for the sprint development in the young soccer players.
