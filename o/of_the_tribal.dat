50|$|However, tribal {{religious}} {{movements that}} intended {{to safeguard the}} belief system and identity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tribals</b> continued at a regional level like the Donyi-Polo movement, Gondi movement, Khasi religion, Sanamahi movement, Sari Dharam movement, Sarna movement etc., but a national level movement encompassing all <b>the</b> <b>tribals</b> was lacking. <b>The</b> early post-Independence literate tribals did feel {{a need for a}} national level movement in order to safeguard <b>the</b> religious beliefs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tribals.</b> <b>The</b> term 'Adi-Dharam' to denote nationally <b>the</b> belief system <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tribals</b> was very much used among <b>the</b> literate <b>tribals</b> in <b>the</b> early post independence era as is evident from Shri Kartik Oraon's, (a <b>tribal</b> leader and <b>the</b> then State Minister of Aviation and Communication, Govt. of India) book Bees Varsh ki Kaali Raat (1970s) where he uses the word 'Adi Dharm' to denote <b>the</b> belief system <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tribals</b> nationally.|$|R

5|$|Characteristic of {{the turn}} of the 10th century in most Polish tribal {{settlement}} areas was a particular intensification of gord building activity.

Religious cult locations were commonly located in the vicinity, while the gords themselves were frequently visited by traders and artisans.|$|E

Although the various tribes could even thereafter act in concert for raids, they did not obey a strong central authority any more.|$|E
5|$|Recension A, the {{earliest}} and most complete copy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tribal</b> Hidage, {{dates from the}} 11th century. It is included in a miscellany of works, written in Old English and Latin, with Aelfric's Latin Grammar and his homily De initio creaturæ, a work written in 1034. It is in the keeping of the British Library, reference MS Harley 3271. It was written by several different scribes, at a date no later than 1032.|$|E
5|$|Sir Henry Spelman was {{the first}} to publish the Tribal Hidage in his first volume of Glossarium Archaiologicum (1626) and there is also a version of the text in a book written in 1691 by Thomas Gale, but no actual {{discussion}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tribal</b> Hidage emerged until 1848, when John Mitchell Kemble's The Saxons in England was published. In 1884, Walter de Gray Birch wrote a paper for the British Archaeological Society, in which he discussed in detail the location of each of the tribes. The term Tribal Hidage was introduced by Frederic William Maitland in 1897, in his book Domesday Book and Beyond. During the following decades, articles were published by William John Corbett (1900), Hector Munro Chadwick (1905) and John Brownbill (1912 and 1925). The most important subsequent accounts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tribal</b> Hidage since Corbett, according to Campbell, are by Josiah Cox Russell (1947), Cyril Hart (1971), Wendy Davies and Hayo Vierck (1974) and David Dumville (1989).|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} purpose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tribal</b> Hidage remains unknown: many scholars {{believe that it}} was a tribute list created by a king, but other possibilities have been suggested. The hidage figures may be purely symbolic and merely reflect the prestige of each territory, or they may represent an early example of book-keeping. Many historians are convinced that the Tribal Hidage originated from Mercia, which dominated southern Anglo-Saxon England until the start of the 9th century, but others have argued that the text was Northumbrian in origin.|$|E
5|$|The {{suppression}} of Ibn al-Ash'ath's revolt signalled {{the end of}} the power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tribal</b> nobility of Iraq, which henceforth came under the direct control of the Umayyad regime's staunchly loyal Syrian troops. Later revolts, under Yazid ibn al-Muhallab and Zayd ibn Ali, also failed, and {{it was not until the}} success of the Abbasid Revolution that the Syrian dominance of Iraq was broken.|$|E
5|$|According to legend, the Roman King Servius Tullius {{enacted a}} series of {{constitutional}} reforms in the 6th century BC. One of these reforms resulted {{in the creation of}} a new organizational unit with which to divide citizens. This unit, the Tribe, was based on geography rather than family, and was created to assist in future reorganizations of the army. In 471 BC, a law was passed which allowed the Plebeians to begin organizing by Tribe. Before this point, they had organized on the basis of the Curia. The only difference between the Plebeian Council after 471 BC and the ordinary Tribal Assembly (which also organized on the basis of the Tribes) was that the Tribes of the Plebeian Council only included Plebeians, whereas the Tribes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tribal</b> Assembly included both Plebeians and Patricians.|$|E

Notable among its achievements is the good health indicator in terms of mortality and fertility rates {{and high levels of}} utilization of formal health services and cent percent literacy. Later, it was observed that this model has several outlier communities in which <b>tribal</b> communities were <b>the</b> most victimized ones. <b>The</b> <b>tribals</b> are children <b>of</b> nature and their lifestyle is conditioned by the Ecosystem. After <b>the</b> sixty years <b>of</b> formation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state <b>tribals</b> continues as one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most marginalized community within the state, the post globalised developmental projects and developmental dreams <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state has again made <b>the</b> deprivation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tribals</b> <b>of</b> Kerala and <b>the</b> developmental divide has increased between <b>the</b> <b>tribal</b> and non-tribal in the state.

40|$|Entrepreneurship is {{considered}} as tactical development interference {{to speed up}} <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> economic development. <b>The</b> promotion <b>of</b> entrepreneurship {{is directly related to}} <b>the</b> socio-economic development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poor <b>tribal</b> population <b>of</b> <b>the</b> society. Scheduled tribes constitute <b>the</b> poorest section <b>of</b> population in rural areas of India. They generally depend on forest and agriculture for livelihood.

In <b>the</b> district cultivation <b>of</b> sabai grass (Eulaliopsis binata) and its processing of consumer goods remain a good enterprise for <b>the</b> <b>tribal</b> entrepreneurs. <b>The</b> study was conducted to examine the socio-economic, personal characteristics and entrepreneurial characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tribals</b> in sabai grass enterprise.

5|$|Protoss {{society is}} shown in the {{background}} of the series to have been tribal with a strong warrior culture, until a planet-wide civil war allowed a mystic, Khas, to access a natural psionic link shared by all Protoss. Khas' discovery and teachings, labelled the Khala, are then used as a base for a new caste-based society. The Judicator caste forms the Conclave, the ruling body of the Khalai Protoss. The Templar caste constitutes the military, and the Khalai caste includes all other Protoss. The player controls a Templar character in the Protoss campaigns of all the video games to date. Khalai Protoss society is depicted as collectivism, being stubbornly conservative while maintaining the warrior culture and honor values <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tribal</b> system.|$|E
5|$|The Tribal Assembly (comitia populi tributa) of the Roman Republic was the {{democratic}} assembly of Roman citizens. The Tribal Assembly was organized as an Assembly, {{and not as}} a Council. During the years of the Roman Republic, citizens were organized on the basis of thirty-five Tribes which included patricians and plebeians. The Tribes gathered into the Tribal Assembly for legislative, electoral, and judicial purposes. The president <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tribal</b> Assembly was usually either a Consul (the highest ranking Roman Magistrate) or a Praetor (the second-highest ranking Roman Magistrate). The Tribal Assembly elected three different magistrates: Quaestors, Curule Aediles, and Military Tribunes. The Tribal Assembly also had the power to try judicial cases.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} had promulgated the Powers of Nomad Shiekhs Ordinance in 1922, and had recognized and reinforced the judicial powers of over 300 tribal leaders by 1923. They had ignored {{the aspirations of}} educated Sudanese in government employment to take {{a greater role in}} administration. The principle of indirect rule had also given the Sayyids, including Abd al-Rahman, more power to prevent changes demanded by the secular opposition. In a shift of policy, the Graduates' General Congress was launched in 1938 as a forum for the intelligentsia of Sudan to express their opinions and as an alternative voice to that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tribal</b> leaders, who had become discredited.|$|E

5|$|Kemble {{recognised}} the antiquity of Spelman's {{document and}} used historical texts (such as Bede's Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum) to assess its date of origin. He proposed locations for each tribe, without attempting to locate each one, {{and suggested that}} some Anglo-Saxon peoples were missing from the document. Birch, in his paper An Unpublished Manuscript of some Early Territorial Names in England, announced his discovery of {{what became known as}} Recension A, which he suggested was a 10th or 11th century copy of a lost 7th-century manuscript. He methodically compared all the publications and manuscripts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tribal</b> Hidage that are available at the time and placed each tribe using both his own theories and the ideas of others, some of which (for instance when he located the Wokensætna in Woking, Surrey) are now discounted. Maitland suspected that the accepted number of acres to each hide needed to be reconsidered to account for the figures in the Tribal Hidage and used his own calculations to conclude that the figures were probably exaggerated. John Brownbill advised against using Latin versions of the document, which he described as error-prone. He determined that the Old English manuscript was written in 1032 and was a copy of an original Mercian manuscript. Chadwick attempted to allocate each tribe to one or more English shires, with the use of key passages from historical texts.|$|E
5|$|The Tribal Hidage {{has been}} of great {{importance}} to historians {{since the middle of}} the 19th century, partly because it mentions territories unrecorded in other documents. Attempts to link all the names in the list with modern places are highly speculative and all resulting maps are treated with caution. Three different versions (or recensions) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tribal</b> Hidage have survived, two of which resemble each other: one dates from the 11th century and is part of a miscellany of works; another is contained in a 17th-century Latin treatise; the third version, which has survived in six mediaeval manuscripts, has many omissions and spelling variations. All three versions appear {{to be based on the}} same lost manuscript: historians have been unable to establish a date for the original compilation. The Tribal Hidage has been used to construct theories about the political organisation of the Anglo-Saxons, and to give an insight into the Mercian state and its neighbours at a time when Mercia held hegemony over a number of other peoples. It has been used to support theories regarding the origin and location of the tribes in the list and the way in which the tribes were systematically assessed and ruled by others. Some historians have proposed that the Tribal Hidage is not a list of peoples but of administrative areas.|$|E
5|$|In the mid- to late-1940s, the Menominee tribe was {{considered}} {{by a government}} survey to identify tribes for termination, {{a process in which}} federal recognition of the tribe would be withdrawn and the tribe would no longer be dependent on the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) to support them. The Menominee were thought to be a tribe that could be terminated because they were one of the richest tribes in the nation. The federal government thought that termination would allow the tribal members to be assimilated into mainstream American culture, becoming hard-working, tax-paying, productive citizens. In 1954, Congress terminated the federally recognized status of the tribe with the Menominee Indian Termination Act. According to the terms of the Termination Act, the federally recognized status was to end in 1958. The tribe and the state of Wisconsin successfully lobbied for a delay in the implementation of termination until 1961. The tribe was opposed to termination for a number of reasons; their concerns included the loss of tribal culture, the loss of land due to tax liens, the possibility of bankruptcy and loss <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tribal</b> timber industry, and the lack of tribal members who were trained to run a county government. The state of Wisconsin was concerned that with no industry for the tribe to tax, the state would be responsible for the large financial outlay that would be required to maintain governmental operations for the former reservation.|$|E
