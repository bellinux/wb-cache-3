5|$|The ADO {{is seeking}} to expand the number <b>of</b> <b>Indigenous</b> Australians it {{recruits}} and improve their retention rate. Restrictions on Indigenous Australians' ability to enlist in the military existed until the 1970s, though hundreds <b>of</b> <b>Indigenous</b> men and women had joined the military when restrictions were reduced during the world wars. By 1992 the representation <b>of</b> <b>Indigenous</b> Australians in the ADF was equivalent to their proportion of the Australian population, though {{they continue to be}} under-represented among the officer corps. Two of the Army's three Regional Force Surveillance Units (NORFORCE and the 51st Battalion, Far North Queensland Regiment) are manned mostly by Indigenous Australian reservists. In 2015 Indigenous Australians made up around 1.5% of ADF personnel, which is smaller than the Indigenous share of the total Australian population.|$|E

5|$|Between 1945 and 1955, {{the number}} of day schools run by Indian Affairs {{expanded}} from 9,532 to 17,947. The growth in day schools was accompanied by {{an amendment to the}} Indian Act in 1951 that allowed federal officials to establish agreements with provincial and territorial governments and school boards regarding the education <b>of</b> <b>Indigenous</b> students in the public school system. These changes were indicative of the government's shift in policy from assimilation-driven education at residential schools to the integration <b>of</b> <b>Indigenous</b> students into public schools. It was believed that Indigenous children would receive a better education {{as a result of their}} transition into the public school system.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the shift}} in policy from {{educational}} assimilation to integration, the removal <b>of</b> <b>Indigenous</b> children from their families by state officials continued {{through much of the}} 1960s and 70s. The removals were the result of the 1951 addition of Section 88 to the Indian Act, which allowed for the application of provincial laws to Indigenous peoples living on reserves in instances where federal laws were not in place. The change included the monitoring of child welfare. With no requirement for specialized training regarding the traditions or lifestyles of the communities they entered, provincial officials assessed the welfare <b>of</b> <b>Indigenous</b> children based on Euro-Canadian values that, for example, deemed traditional diets of game, fish and berries insufficient and grounds for taking children into custody. This period resulted in the widespread removal <b>of</b> <b>Indigenous</b> children from their traditional communities, first termed the Sixties Scoop by Patrick Johnston, the author of the 1983 report Native Children and the Child Welfare System. Often taken without the consent of their parents or community elders, some children were placed in state-run child welfare facilities, increasingly operated in former residential schools, while others were fostered or placed up for adoption by predominantly non-Indigenous families throughout Canada and the United States. While the Indian and Northern Affairs estimates that 11,132 children were adopted between 1960 and 1990, the actual number may be as high as 20,000.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} 20th century {{to at least}} the mid-1980s, {{educational}} policies in Mexico focused on the hispanicization (castellanización) <b>of</b> <b>indigenous</b> communities, teaching only Spanish and discouraging the use <b>of</b> <b>indigenous</b> languages. As a result, today there is no group of Nahuatl speakers having attained general literacy in Nahuatl; while their literacy rate in Spanish also remains {{much lower than the}} national average. Even so, Nahuatl is still spoken by well over a million people, of whom around 10% are monolingual. The survival of Nahuatl as a whole is not imminently endangered, but the survival of certain dialects is, and some dialects have already become extinct within the last few decades of the 20th century.|$|E

5|$|On 26 October 1925, Houphouët {{began his}} career as a doctor's aide at a {{hospital}} in Abidjan, where he founded an association <b>of</b> <b>indigenous</b> medical personnel. This undertaking proved short-lived as the colonial administration viewed it unsympathetically, considering it a trade union. As a consequence, they decided to move Houphouët to a lesser hospital in Guiglo on 27 April 1927. After he proved his considerable talents, however, he was promoted on 17 September 1929 to a post in Abengourou, which until then had been reserved for Europeans.

5|$|The Spanish conquest had as its {{principal}} aims the physical {{incorporation of the}} indigenous peoples of Chiapas into the Spanish Empire, and their spiritual conversion to Christianity. This involved the dismantling <b>of</b> <b>indigenous</b> power structures, the destruction of pagan temples and idols, the concentration <b>of</b> <b>indigenous</b> populations in centralised settlements that could be more easily controlled and evangelised, the incorporation of these new settlements into the Spanish system of tributes and taxes, {{and the introduction of}} Christian imagery. One side of this involved armed struggle and the imposition of Spanish colonial administration by force; the religious side of this struggle was the generally peaceful conversion <b>of</b> <b>indigenous</b> populations to Christianity. In Chiapas, such evangelisation efforts were generally carried out by the Dominican Order. The Dominicans became involved in the concentration of Indians into new settlements, the construction of churches and convents, and the religious instruction of the natives.|$|E
