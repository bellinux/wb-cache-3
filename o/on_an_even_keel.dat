5|$|On {{the night}} of 1314 December, Köln was {{attacked}} by British bombers in Oslofjord; several near misses caused damage to her propulsion system that required repair in Germany. She departed Norway on 23 January 1945 in company with Admiral Hipper and a destroyer, and arrived in Kiel on 8 February. She then proceeded to Wilhelmshaven, where she was again attacked by Allied bombers repeatedly. On 30 March, B-24 Liberators from the Eighth Air Force attacked the harbor; Köln was hit and sank <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> <b>keel.</b> Since her guns remained above water, the ship {{was used as an}} artillery battery to defend the city from advancing Allied forces. She served in this capacity {{until the end of the}} war in May. She was partially dismantled in situ after the end of the war, and finally raised in 1956 for scrapping.|$|E
5|$|The three ships all {{participated in}} the {{non-intervention}} patrols during the Spanish Civil War in 1936–1939. After the outbreak of war, {{they were used to}} lay defensive minefields along with Emden, and in April 1940, {{participated in the}} invasion of Norway. Two of the three cruisers, Karlsruhe and Königsberg, were sunk during the invasion; Karlsruhe was torpedoed by a British submarine off Kristiansand and Königsberg was sunk by British divebombers in Bergen. Köln was used in a variety of roles after the conclusion of the campaign, including as a testbed for operating the Flettner Fl 282 helicopter at sea. She was bombed and sunk by American heavy bombers in Wilhelmshaven in March 1945, though she sank in shallow water <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> <b>keel,</b> which allowed her guns to provide gunfire support to German troops {{until the end of the}} war.|$|E

5|$|Köln was {{the only}} ship of the class to survive the {{operations}} off Norway. After returning to Germany, she was modified {{to serve as a}} testbed for the Flettner Fl 282 helicopter. She thereafter served in the Baltic, providing gunfire support to advancing German troops in 1941. In mid 1942, she returned to Norwegian waters, and unsuccessfully attempted to attack Convoy PQ 18 along with several other German warships. She was then ordered back to Germany, where she served in a variety of roles, including training ship and convoy escort, before again returning to Norway. She was damaged by British bombers in December 1944 and forced to return to Germany for repairs. While in dock in Wilhelmshaven in March 1945, she was attacked and sunk by American heavy bombers. She sank <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> <b>keel,</b> with her guns still above water, which permitted their use against advancing British forces until {{the final days of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|Like {{her sister}} ships, Köln {{served as a}} {{training}} ship for naval cadets in the 1930s, and joined the non-intervention patrols during the Spanish Civil War during {{the latter part of}} the decade. After the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, she conducted several operations in the North Sea, but did not encounter any British warships. She participated in the attack on Bergen during Operation Weserübung in April 1940, and she was the only member of her class to survive the operation. In 1942, she was modified to carry a Flettner Fl 282 helicopter experimentally. Later in 1942, she returned to Norway, but did not see significant action. She remained there until early 1945, when she returned to Germany; in March, she was sunk by American bombers in Wilhelmshaven. She remained <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> <b>keel,</b> with her gun turrets above water; this allowed her to provide gunfire support to defenders of the city until the end of the war in May 1945.|$|E
5|$|The fleet {{remained}} in captivity during the negotiations in Versailles that ultimately produced the treaty {{that ended the}} war. A copy of The Times informed von Reuter that the Armistice was to expire at noon on 21 June 1919, the deadline by which Germany was to have signed the peace treaty. Rear Admiral von Reuter {{came to the conclusion}} that the British intended to seize the German ships after the Armistice expired. To prevent this, he decided to scuttle his ships at the first opportunity. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers; at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships. Hindenburg was the last ship to sink, at 17:00. Her captain had deliberately arranged that the ship sank <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> <b>keel</b> to make it easier for her crew to escape. After several unsuccessful attempts, she was raised on 23 July 1930, only to be scrapped at Rosyth between 1930 and 1932. Her bell was presented to the Bundesmarine (Federal Navy) on 28 May 1959.|$|E
50|$|At that juncture, Peterson dived {{into the}} sea and swam through the {{tumbling}} surf with a line to the nearby Chauncey, which was also aground but in a far better predicament since she had remained <b>on</b> <b>a</b> comparatively <b>even</b> <b>keel.</b> The crew of Chauncey hauled Peterson aboard and made the line fast. Soon, a seven-man life raft from the Chauncey {{was on its way}} to Young as a makeshift ferry. The raft ultimately made 11 trips bringing the 70 Young survivors to safety. By 2330, the last men of the crew were on board Chauncey; at that point, Lt. Cmdr. Calhoun and Lt. Herzinger (the latter having returned to the ship after having been in the first raft across) left 'Young's' battered hull.|$|R
500|$|At 8:17 am, Missouri slid up <b>on</b> <b>a</b> shoal (or mud bar) {{and stuck}} to the ground. In a last-ditch effort to save the ship, Peckham {{sent a message to}} Brown stating [...] "Come right immediately! Twist ship!", but this effort was too little, too late; Missouri had already run aground. Her hull had {{traveled}} approximately , which was very nearly {{the entire length of the}} shoal, raising the battleship several feet out of the water, and her engines were shut down after the bay sand began to clog the battleship's intakes in engineering. She had come to rest <b>on</b> <b>an</b> almost <b>even</b> <b>keel</b> <b>on</b> the sandbar within plain sight of a number of admirals of the United States Navy stationed at Hampton Roads, and similar number of high-ranking officers of the United States Army stationed at Fort Monroe.|$|R
50|$|It {{was soon}} {{discovered}} that they possessed only twelve gallons of water and no food at all, and the boats, containing eleven men each, leaked {{and needed to be}} bailed out throughout the night. The next day, seeing that the Ann Alexander had not yet sunk but was on her beam ends, Deblois went on board to cut away the masts with a hatchet, in the hope this would lessen the drag. The ship partially righted itself, and the crew, using spades, were able to cut the foremast anchor chain, which helped bring her <b>on</b> <b>a</b> more <b>even</b> <b>keel.</b> Using ropes tied around their waists, the whalers then lowered themselves over the side and cut holes through the decks to get to the food stores, but obtained only five gallons of vinegar and twenty pounds of waterlogged bread. The ship became unstable, so they returned to their boats and rowed away.|$|R
25|$|The {{aircraft}} was airborne after {{a run of}} approximately 1100 yards, climbed to about 150 feet in a perfectly normal manner and then gradually lost height, striking the sea <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> <b>keel</b> approximately 1200 yards after leaving the ground.|$|E
25|$|Great Western was an iron-strapped, wooden, side-wheel paddle steamer, {{with four}} masts to hoist the {{auxiliary}} sails. The sails {{were not just}} to provide auxiliary propulsion, but also were used in rough seas to keep the ship <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> <b>keel</b> and ensure that both paddle wheels remained in the water, driving the ship in a straight line. The hull was built of oak by traditional methods. She was the largest steamship for one year, until the British and American's British Queen went into service. Built at the shipyard of Patterson & Mercer in Bristol, Great Western was launched on 19 July 1837 and then sailed to London, where she was fitted with two side-lever steam engines from the firm of Maudslay, Sons & Field, producing 750 indicated horsepower between them. The ship proved satisfactory in service and initiated the transatlantic route, acting {{as a model for}} all following Atlantic paddle-steamers.|$|E
25|$|Another theory {{involves}} Titanics watertight doors. This {{theory suggests}} that if these doors had been opened, the Titanic would have settled <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> <b>keel</b> and therefore, perhaps, remained afloat long enough for rescue ships to arrive. However, this theory appears to be far from reality for two reasons: first, there were no watertight doors between any of the first four compartments, thus {{it was impossible to}} lower the concentration of water in the bow significantly. Second, Bedford and Hacket have shown by calculations that any significant amount of water aft of boiler room No.4 would have resulted in capsizing of the Titanic, which would have occurred about 30 minutes earlier than the actual time of sinking. Additionally, the lighting would have been lost about 70 minutes after the collision due to the flooding of the boiler rooms. Bedford and Hacket also analysed the hypothetical case that there were no bulkheads at all. Then, the vessel would have capsized about 70 minutes before the actual time of sinking and lighting would have been lost about 40 minutes after the collision.|$|E
60|$|We left London amid rumours of all kinds. The Metropolis was {{shrouded}} {{in a fog}} of credulous uncertainty, {{broken only by the}} sinister gleam of the placarded lie or the croak of the newsman. Terrible disasters had occurred and had been contradicted; great battles were raging--unconfirmed; and beneath all this froth the tide of war was really flowing, and no man could shut his eyes to grave possibilities. Then the ship sailed, and all was silence--a heaving silence. But Madeira was scarcely four days' journey. There we should find the answers to many questions. At Madeira, however, we learned nothing, but nothing, though satisfactory, is very hard to understand. Why did they declare war if they had nothing up their sleeves? Why are they wasting time now? Such were the questions. Then we sailed again, and again silence shut down, this time, however, <b>on</b> <b>a</b> more <b>even</b> <b>keel.</b>|$|R
500|$|During the [...] and [...] seasons, Sidle {{seems to}} be <b>on</b> <b>a</b> {{downward}} spiral as her memories of childhood resurface, with cases becoming more difficult for her emotionally. Also, the fact that Grissom decided to promote Nick Stokes instead of Sidle, did not help. Season Four concludes with Sidle being stopped by a traffic cop. Although she is driving under the influence, she is not charged, but Grissom, as her supervisor, is informed of her arrest. He arrives at the station to bring her home, and finally seems to notice her emotional state. Later, in , she loses her temper with a domestic abuse suspect and then argues with supervisors Catherine Willows and Conrad Ecklie, which results in her suspension. Following this incident, she admits to Grissom {{that she has a}} problem with authority, has chosen emotionally unavailable men (like Grissom), and has a self-destructive streak.

40|$|Japan's reevaluation of its {{security}} {{position and the}} role it wishes to play in regional and international matters has {{been influenced by the}} reemergence of China and continue to affect Japan as it moves to its newly described role. Japan's ongoing modernization of its forces, which are directed under its National Defense Program Outline and Midterm Defense Program, do not, however, seem to be in reaction to any overt perception of a Chinese threat or Chinese influence. These programs reflect Japan's decision to take a "balanced approach" to security, <b>an</b> approach based <b>on</b> the United States-Japan security arrangements, supported by a self-reliant defense force and in conjunction with regional and international approaches to security. The Japanese, with their balanced approach to security, are carefully preparing for the 21 st Century.

The then Captain Malcolm Campbell owned the {{franchise}} for Ballot in England and raced one of its models at Brooklands and was considering buying a new model for a Grand Prix campaign so Foresti and Villa were despatched with the car that French star Jules Goux had driven in the Grand Prix Villa had missed. Campbell was so impressed with Villa's manner and ability he offered him a job and though he was very much so Campbell's employee Villa was to be a key part in Malcolm Campbell's nine land and four water world speed record attempts. Not long after by then Sir Malcolm's death on New Year's Eve 1948 Villa was approached by Sir Malcolm's son Donald Campbell with a proposition, the junior Campbell had heard that the Americans were planning <b>an</b> attempt <b>on</b> his fathers world water speed record and the fiercely patriotic Campbell wanted to push it out of their reach before they even got started. The older and wiser Villa wasn't against such an idea he did however advise that record breaking wasn't as easy as Campbell thought it was and once Campbell got started he would be addicted for life. The headstrong young Campbell wasn't to be dissuaded and so Villa found himself again playing chief mechanic to a Campbell's many record attempts. However this time round far from being just an employee Villa's relationship with the young Campbell was <b>on</b> <b>a</b> much more <b>even</b> <b>keel</b> having watched Campbell grow up and having covered for him on numerous occasions so as he didn't suffer the wrath of Sir Malcolm he was held in great affection by Donald who regularly referred to him as Unc.

Campbell proved to be as adept at record breaking as his father and he went on to set no fewer than 7 world water speed record and 1 world land speed record with Villa being instrumental in every one. It was a successful partnership that was only broken upon Campbell's death in 1967 whilst attempting his eighth world water speed record.|$|R
