25|$|Large-scale dealing, production, import {{and export}} are prosecuted {{to the fullest}} extent of the law, {{even if it does}} not supply end users or coffeeshops with more than the allowed amounts. Exactly how coffeeshops get their {{supplies}} is rarely investigated, however. The average concentration of THC in the cannabis sold in coffeeshops has increased from 9% in 1998 to 18% in 2005. This means that less plant material has to be consumed to achieve the same effect. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>is</b> plant breeding and use of greenhouse technology for illegal growing of cannabis in Netherlands.|$|E

25|$|According to {{a survey}} by the {{regulatory}} body in 2007, only 30 percent of those connected to the public water network enjoyed continuous water supply. On average, customers received water 12 hours per day. Tap water quality, at least in some areas and at some times, is poor: For example, residents of Cilincing, North Jakarta, have complained that their tap water has been cloudy for two months and blame skin irritation and diarrhoe on the poor water supply. According to interviews with residents in South and West Jakarta, shown in a 2011 video by the Amrta Institute for Water Literacy, service quality has actually deteriorated since the concessions began. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>is</b> that, because of low pressure, some customers pump directly from the pipes, therefore sucking dirty groundwater through leakages of the pipes.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{also common}} for {{competitive}} swimmers to shave hair off their legs, arms, and torsos, to reduce drag {{and provide a}} heightened [...] "feel" [...] for the water by removing the exterior layer of skin along with the body hair. [...] Some professional soccer players also shave their legs. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>is</b> that {{they are required to}} wear shin guards and in case of a skin rash the affected area can be treated more efficiently.|$|E
2500|$|According to the study, Christians in North America, Europe, Middle East, North Africa and Asia-Pacific {{regions are}} highly educated {{since many of}} the world {{universities}} were built by the historic Christian Churches, in addition to the historical evidence that [...] "Christian monks built libraries and, in the days before printing presses, preserved important earlier writings produced in Latin, Greek and Arabic". According to the same study, Christians have a significant amount of gender equality in educational attainment, and the study suggests that <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>is</b> the encouragement of the Protestant Reformers in promoting the education of women, which led to the eradication of illiteracy among females in Protestant communities.|$|E

2500|$|The {{territory}} of Slovenia mainly ( [...] , i.e. 81%) {{belongs to the}} Black Sea basin, and a smaller part ( [...] , i.e. 19%) belongs to the Adriatic Sea basin. These two parts are divided into smaller units in regard to their central rivers, the Mura River basin, the Drava River basin, the Sava River basin with Kolpa River basin, and the basin of the Adriatic rivers. In comparison with developed countries, water quality in [...] Slovenia {{is considered to be}} among the highest in Europe. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>is</b> undoubtedly that most of the rivers rise on the mountainous {{territory of}} Slovenia. But {{this does not mean that}} Slovenia has no problems with surface water and groundwater quality, especially in areas with intensive farming.|$|E

6000|$|I think <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>is</b> that I have so allowed {{silence and}} {{separation}} to accumulate--the effort of {{breaking through the}} mass becomes in that case so formidable; the mass being thus the monstrous mountain that blocks up the fair scene and {{that one has to}} explain away. I am engaged in that effort at the present moment, however--I am breaking through the mass, boring through the mountain, I feel, as I put pen to paper--and this, too, though I don't, though I shan't, though I can't particularly [...] "explain." [...] And why should I treat you at this time of day--or, to speak literally, of night--as if you had begun suddenly {{not to be able to}} understand without a vulgar demonstration on the blackboard? As I should never dream of resorting to that mode of public proof that I tenderly and unabatedly love you, so why should I think it necessary to chalk it up there that there was, all those strange weeks and months during which I made you no sign, an absolute inevitability in the graceless appearance? I call them strange because of the unnatural face that they wear to me now--but they had at the time the deadliest familiar look; the look of all the other parts of life that one was giving up and doing without--even if it didn't resemble them in their comparative dismissability. From them I learned perforce at last to avert my head, whereas there wasn't a moment of the long stretch during which I never either wrote or wired you for generous leave to come down to tea or dinner or both, there wasn't a moment when I hadn't, from Chelsea to Windsor, my eyes fondly fixed on you. You seemed rather to go out of their reach when I was placed in some pretended assurance that you had left Qu'acre for Scotland, but now that I hear, by some equally vague voice of the air, that you are still at home--and this appears more confirmed to me--I have you intensely before me again; yes, and so vividly that I even make you out as sometimes looking at me. I think in fact it's a good deal the magnanimous sadness I so catch from you that makes me feel to-night how little longer I can bear my own black air of having fallen away while I yet really and intensely stick, and therefore get on the way to you again, so far as this will take me.|$|E

50|$|Generally speaking, Shanxi cuisine is less {{known to}} {{people outside the}} region. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>is</b> that Shanxi is less {{populated}} as compared to other provinces in China.

50|$|Umkirch is a {{separate}} community; it has still maintained its village-like character. However, this idyll {{is influenced by the}} freeway which leads through 20.000 cars a day through the city, which create often traffic jams. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>is</b> possibly the location of the industrial area just opposite the freeway connection. Also, the creation of high-riser restroyed much of the village atmosphere.|$|E
