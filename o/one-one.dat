25|$|Two main {{methods for}} music therapy are group {{meetings}} and <b>one-one</b> sessions. Group music therapy can include group discussions concerning moods and emotions in or toward music, songwriting, and musical improvisation. Groups emphasizing mood recognition and awareness, group cohesion, and improvement in self-esteem {{can be effective}} in working with adolescents. Group therapy, however, {{is not always the}} best choice for the client. Ongoing one-on-one music therapy has also been shown to be effective. One-on-one music therapy provides a non-invasive, non-judgmental environment, encouraging clients to show capacities that may be hidden in group situations.|$|E

The Jivamukti In-Class Private (or ICP) allows students to experience both methods of teaching simultaneously: the student {{and his or her}} private certified Jivamukti Yoga teacher together attend a regular group class. From beginning to end, the student practices with the guidance and hands-on assists of the private teacher. ICPs always conclude with a special deep relaxation yoga massage in shavasana, or corpse pose. An ICP can be adapted to almost any Jivamukti Yoga class, but is most frequently given in an Open class.|$|E
25|$|A {{numbering}} is an enumeration of functions; {{it has two}} parameters, e and x and outputs {{the value}} of the e-th function in the numbering on the input x. Numberings can be partial-recursive although some of its members are total recursive, that is, computable functions. Admissible numberings are those into which all others can be translated. A Friedberg numbering (named after its discoverer) is a <b>one-one</b> numbering of all partial-recursive functions; it is necessarily not an admissible numbering. Later research dealt also with numberings of other classes like classes of recursively enumerable sets. Goncharov discovered for example a class of recursively enumerable sets for which the numberings fall into exactly two classes with respect to recursive isomorphisms.|$|E
25|$|A {{family is}} indexed by an index set. In {{the case of}} a family of {{operations}} forming an algebra, the indices are called operation symbols, constituting the language of that algebra. The operation indexed by each symbol is called the denotation or interpretation of that symbol. Each operation symbol specifies the arity of its interpretation, whence all possible interpretations of a symbol have the same arity. In general it is possible for an algebra to interpret distinct symbols with the same operation, {{but this is not the}} case for the prototype, whose symbols are in <b>one-one</b> correspondence with its operations. The prototype therefore has 22n n-ary operation symbols, called the Boolean operation symbols and forming the language of Boolean algebra. Only a few operations have conventional symbols, such as ¬ for negation, ∧ for conjunction, and ∨ for disjunction. It is convenient to consider the i-th n-ary symbol to be n'f'i as done below in the section on truth tables.|$|E

Bradman started slowly and then, [...] "...the old Bradman [...] back with us, in the twinkling of an eye, almost". He went on to make 140, with the last 90runs coming in just 45minutes. On {{the opening day of}} the Fourth Test at Headingley (Leeds), England were out for 200, but Australia slumped to 3/39, losing the third wicket from the last ball of the day. Listed to bat at number five, Bradman would start his innings the next day.|$|E

2500|$|... was {{the first}} to observe that the {{composition}} of partial transformations is a special case of the composition of binary relations. He recognised also that the domain of composition of two partial transformations may be the empty set, so he introduced an empty transformation to take account of this. With the addition of this empty transformation, the composition of partial transformations of a set becomes an [...] everywhere-defined associative binary operation. Under this composition, the collection [...] of all partial <b>one-one</b> transformations of a set X forms an inverse semigroup, called the symmetric inverse semigroup (or monoid) on X. This is the [...] "archetypal" [...] inverse semigroup, {{in the same way that}} a symmetric group is the archetypal group. For example, just as every group can be embedded in a symmetric group, every inverse semigroup can be embedded in a symmetric inverse semigroup (see below).|$|E
2500|$|Feynman was {{particularly}} adept at leavening hard work with light-hearted games. His genius {{was as much}} playful as serious. He took pride in deceiving the mail censors, guessing the combinations of safes in which secret files were stored, picking door locks, and teasing the guards (he would depart from the main gate, circle around the perimeter to {{a hole in the}} fence, re-enter the facility, and then exit the gate again, thus causing confusion and consternation both.) He also liked to pound his bongo drums, a practice which made those within hearing range grit their teeth but which he believed put him in touch with the spirits of the Indians who formerly inhabited the place. Physicists are known for their love of music, particularly classical music, and their ability to play it. Feynman wasn't unusual in his affection for drumming but his choice of musical genres was atypical as was his lack of skill as a drummer. It appears that the music produced by his friends offended him as much as his relentless noise offended them. When Ashkin played the recorder, Feynman said he was using [...] "an infernally popular wooden tube ... for making noises bearing a <b>one-one</b> correspondence to black dots {{on a piece of paper}} -- in imitation to music." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many {{prominent}} Democrats have praised Bryan and his legacy. In 1962, former President Harry Truman said Bryan [...] "was a great <b>one—one</b> of the greatest."

[...] In 1900, Truman, aged 16, was a page at the Democratic National Convention in Kansas City. He heard Bryan speak and was deeply impressed. In 1900 Truman and his father [...] "declared themselves thorough 'Bryan men'... Bryan remained an idol for Harry, as the voice of the common man." [...] Tom L. Johnson, the progressive mayor of Cleveland, Ohio, referred to Bryan's campaign in 1896 as [...] "the first great struggle of the masses in our country against the privileged classes." [...] In a 1934 speech dedicating a memorial to Bryan, President Franklin D. Roosevelt said [...] "I think that we would choose the word 'sincerity' as fitting him [...] most of all...it was that sincerity that served him so well in his life-long fight against sham and privilege and wrong. It was that sincerity which made him a force for good in his own generation and kept alive many of the ancient faiths on which we are building today.

60|$|We {{may take}} another {{illustration}} from {{the hypothesis of}} psycho-physical parallelism. Let us assume, {{for the purposes of}} this illustration, that to a given state of brain a given state of mind always corresponds, and vice versa, i.e. that there is a <b>one-one</b> relation between them, so that each is a function of the other. We may also assume, what is practically certain, that to a given state of a certain brain a given state of the whole material universe corresponds, since it is highly improbable that a given brain is ever twice in exactly the same state. Hence there will be a <b>one-one</b> relation between the state of a given person's mind and the state of the whole material universe. It follows that, if n states of the material universe are determinants of the material universe, then n states of a given man's mind are determinants of the whole material and mental universe--assuming, that is to say, that psycho-physical parallelism is true.|$|E
6000|$|Frege next {{asks the}} question: When do two {{collections}} {{have the same}} number of terms? In ordinary life, we decide this question by counting; but counting, as we saw, is impossible in the case of infinite collections, and is not logically fundamental with finite collections. We want, therefore, a different method of answering our question. An illustration may help to make the method clear. I do not know how many married men there are in England, but I do know that the number {{is the same as the}} number of married women. The reason I know this is that the relation of husband and wife relates one man to one woman and one woman to one man. A relation of this sort is called a <b>one-one</b> relation. The relation of father to son is called a one-many relation, because a man can have only one father but may have many sons; conversely, the relation of son to father is called a many-one relation. But the relation of husband to wife (in Christian countries) is called <b>one-one,</b> because a man cannot have more than one wife, or a woman more than one husband. Now, whenever there is a <b>one-one</b> relation between all the terms of one collection and all the terms of another severally, as in the case of English husbands and English wives, the number of terms in the one collection is the same as the number in the other; but when there is not such a relation, the number is different. This is the answer to the question: When do two collections have {{the same number of}} terms? ...|$|E
6000|$|We can now at last {{answer the}} question: What {{is meant by}} the number of terms in a given collection? When there is a <b>one-one</b> {{relation}} between all the terms of one collection and all the terms of another severally, we shall say that the two collections are [...] "similar." [...] We have just seen that two similar collections have the same number of terms. This leads us to define the number of a given collection as the class of all collections that are similar to it; that is to say, we set up the following formal definition: ...|$|E

We speak of ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, etc., in defiance of the beautiful system of decimal notation in which we write those numbers.

Let us suppose it to be the letter o pronounced short as in [...] "on," [...] then instead of ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, etc., we might say on-naught, on-one, on-two, on-three, etc.|$|E
