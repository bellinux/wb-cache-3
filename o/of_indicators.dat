The work seems composed to be symmetrically balanced towards an accompanying right-hand wing: Mary is positioned slightly to the right of centre, while her downward, almost coy glance is directed at a space beyond the edge of the panel, suggesting that she is looking at, or in the direction of, a kneeling donor in a right-hand wing. The visible architectural features – with the exception of the niches, the crucifixion and the windows directly behind it, which are at a right angle to the nave and centre front, facing the viewer – are at the left of the panel, facing right.|$|E

Concentration of total coliforms and E. coli was comparable for leachate obtained from Kulim Landfill Site (KLS) and Ampang Landfill Site (ALS) with little variations. However, the level <b>of</b> <b>indicator</b> bacteria was significantly lower for Kuala Sepetang Landfill Site (KSLS), whereas Pulau Burung Landfill Site (PBLS) had the lowest concentration for both total coliforms and E. coli. Considering the landfills are currently operational, {{with the exception of}} ALS, the presence <b>of</b> <b>indicator</b> bacteria implies their inactivation prior to discharge. High concentration <b>of</b> <b>indicator</b> bacteria in ALS is attributed to the run-off entering the leachate pond. Greater concentration of ammonia and salinity level were partly responsible for lower concentration <b>of</b> <b>indicator</b> bacteria in leachate from KSLS and PBLS, indicating that salinty and ammonia could significantly affect the survival <b>of</b> <b>indicator</b> bacteria...|$|R

25|$|Statistical {{techniques}} {{were used to}} determine which, if any, of the criteria were the best indicators of alcoholism. Surprisingly, the answer was that all criteria were of roughly equal importance. No particular indicator or cluster <b>of</b> <b>indicators</b> predominated: it was the number and frequency of problems that best defined alcoholism. More importantly, the medical, sociological, and behavioural criteria were equally reliable (i.e. highly correlated). In other words, it was equally valid to call alcoholism a medical or a behavioural disorder—evidence that doctors and sociologists are indeed talking about the same “unitary disorder”.|$|E

25|$|Although {{a number}} <b>of</b> <b>indicators</b> {{are useful in}} {{diagnosing}} copper deficiency, there are no reliable biomarkers of copper excess resulting from dietary intake. The most reliable indicator of excess copper status is liver copper concentration. However, measurement of this endpoint in humans is intrusive and not generally conducted except in cases of suspected copper poisoning. Increased serum copper or ceruolplasmin levels are not reliably associated with copper toxicity as elevations in concentrations can be induced by inflammation, infection, disease, malignancies, pregnancy, and other biological stressors. Levels of copper-containing enzymes, such as cytochrome c oxidase, superoxide dismutase, and diaminase oxidase, vary not only in response to copper state but also {{in response to a}} variety of other physiological and biochemical factors and therefore are inconsistent markers of excess copper status.|$|E

25|$|Equatorial Guinea is {{considered}} wealthy by African standards, with a GDP that routinely outperforms neighboring African nations, {{in most instances}} by over 300 percent, and that has grown steadily in recent years. Indeed, its per capital GDP now exceeds those of Italy, Israel, and South Korea. But thanks to the massive diversion of funds from the national treasury into the Nguema/Mongomo group's bank accounts, the people of Equatorial Guinea live in desperate poverty, with over 60% earning less than $1 a day. Life expectancy is below 50, 57% of the people lack clean drinking water, 47% lack safe plumbing, {{and the level of}} medical care is primitive. The country has the world's fourth-highest infant mortality rate. Many of these kinds <b>of</b> <b>indicators</b> have gone from bad to worse in recent years.
