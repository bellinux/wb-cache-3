5|$|An {{ordinary}} sphere in three-dimensional space — the surface, not {{the solid}} ball — is just <b>one</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> what a sphere means in topology. Geometry defines a sphere rigidly, as a shape. Here are some alternatives.|$|E
5|$|Heart murmurs are {{abnormal}} heart sounds {{which can}} be either pathological or benign. <b>One</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> a murmur is Still's murmur, which presents a musical sound in children, has no symptoms and disappears in adolescence.|$|E

5|$|Marble Hill is <b>one</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> how Manhattan's {{land has}} been {{considerably}} altered by human intervention. The borough has seen substantial land reclamation along its waterfronts since Dutch colonial times, {{and much of}} the natural variation in its topography has been evened out.|$|E
5|$|The class {{continued}} {{to operate with}} British Railways until withdrawn during 1961 and 1962. Only <b>one</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> the class – the first engine, Lord Nelson itself – has been saved from scrapping. This has been seen running on mainline tours and preserved railways throughout Britain.|$|E
5|$|Characters {{throughout}} the film studios and movie sets will help Seymour on his quest with new objects and advice, {{but only if}} he helps them first. Seymour's observations when collecting objects and sarcastic exchanges with other characters are communicated through speech bubbles. <b>One</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> a puzzle is the Frankenstein's monster which must be created by combining body parts in a specific location on the horror film set. Once the monster is completed it smashes {{through one of the}} set's walls, allowing Seymour to access the set next door.|$|E
50|$|The term usually {{refers to}} {{thermoplastic}} materials rather than thermosetting <b>ones.</b> <b>Examples</b> <b>of</b> engineering plastics include {{acrylonitrile butadiene styrene}} (ABS), used for car bumpers, dashboard trim and Lego bricks; polycarbonates, used in motorcycle helmets; and polyamides (nylons), used for skis and ski boots.|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} various calculi have been {{proposed}} for modelling biological systems, typically intracellular pathways. These calculi generally {{fall into one of}} two camps: ones based on process calculi, such as Milner’s pi-calculus [24], and rule-based <b>ones.</b> <b>Examples</b> <b>of</b> the former include [31, 32, 30]; <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> the latter include BIOCHAM, κ, BioNet...|$|R

5|$|Exports {{and imports}} by air in 2005 were {{estimated}} at £62.7billion and £59.6billion respectively, {{with a significant}} majority of air freight operations being conducted with countries outside of the EU, and express freight operations transporting 5 per cent by value of all UK exports in 2004. Whilst export/import facilities provide opportunities for international trade and competition, they are not without negative effect, and British horticulture is <b>one</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> domestic industry damaged by cheap imports.|$|E
5|$|Fishers {{have also}} been {{captured}} and bred by zoos, {{but they are not}} a common zoo species. Fishers are poor animals to exhibit because, in general, they hide from visitors all day. Some zoos have had difficulty keeping fishers alive since they are susceptible to many diseases in captivity. Yet there is at least <b>one</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> a fisher kept in captivity that lived to be ten years old, and one case of a fisher living to be approximately 14 years old, well beyond its natural lifespan of 7 years.|$|E
5|$|In 1834, King Ludwig I {{granted the}} city its old {{coat of arms}} again {{in the form of}} large and small crests. These {{embodied}} the small crest seal of 1304 and the large one of 1323. The 1835 coat of arms had a blue background, though this was later corrected to argent under Ludwig II in 1865. The background was rarely changed. <b>One</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> its occurrence, however, was when or was used in the 16th century instead.|$|E

5|$|In later years, {{because it}} was {{impossible}} for parishioners to travel to Llanbadarn Fawr from the more distant parts of the parish, the church eventually had many chapels of ease, as the population of the parish grew. <b>One</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> the latter is All Saints Church, Llangorwen, which was built in the early 1840s. In the course of the nineteenth century the original parish of Llanbadarn Fawr was finally divided into some 17 new parishes, comprising 20 churches.|$|E
5|$|In some cases, {{travelers}} and the aircraft can clear customs and immigration at the departure airport. As <b>one</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> this, are airports in Canada with United States border preclearance facilities. This allows flights from those airports {{to fly into}} US airports {{that do not have}} customs and immigration facilities. Luggage from such flights can also be transferred to a final destination in the U.S. through the airport of entry.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the origin and early years of Jakub Świnka, except for his mention in a {{document}} issued by Bolesław the Pious. As Archbishop of Gniezno, the cooperation between him and Przemysł II was excellent. <b>One</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> this was the fact that he appeared as witness in 14 diplomats issued by the Duke of Greater Poland, including the confirmation of all his existing privileges and the permission to mint his own coins in Żnin and the castellany of Ląd.|$|E

5|$|Nitrogen analogues of the Nazarov {{cyclization}} reaction (known as imino-Nazarov cyclization reactions) {{have few}} instances; there is <b>one</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> a generalized imino-Nazarov cyclization reported (shown below), and several iso-imino-Nazarov reactions in the literature. Even these tend {{to suffer from}} poor stereoselectivity, poor yields, or narrow scope. The difficulty stems from the relative over-stabilization of the pentadienyl cation by electron donation, impeding cyclization.|$|E
5|$|Nuttin {{frames the}} cause {{in terms of}} ownership, which has roots in {{economic}} psychology. The endowment effect has found that people ascribe more value to things merely because they own them. Nuttin puts the name-letter effect down to people automatically liking and valuing anything that is connected to them. As such, the name-letter effect is just <b>one</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> a more general mere-ownership effect. In which case, various verifiable predictions follow.|$|E
5|$|Oxelösund is <b>one</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> a {{municipality}} {{emerging from}} a split between two cities – in this case, Nyköping and Oxelösund, which are now in neighboring municipalities since the splitting of Nikolai rural municipality in 1950. The town of Oxelösund was established in 1900 and became a city in 1950, when it became a separate municipality from Nyköping.|$|E

50|$|There {{is also a}} {{separate}} 2D graphics engine, which can operate independently from the 3D <b>one.</b> <b>Examples</b> <b>of</b> 2D engine features includes lights, shadows, shaders, tile sets, parallax scrolling, polygons, animations, physics and particles. It is also possible to mix 2D and 3D using a 'viewport node'.|$|R
5|$|Several {{organizations}} have adopted Xgrid in large international computing networks. <b>One</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> an Xgrid cluster is MacResearch's OpenMacGrid, where scientists can request access to {{large amounts of}} processing power to run tasks related to their research. Another was the now defunct Xgrid@Stanford project, which used a range of computers on the Stanford University campus {{and around the world}} to perform biochemical research.|$|E
5|$|Some protein {{complexes}} {{contain a}} large central cavity that is {{isolated from the}} remainder of the cytosol. <b>One</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> such an enclosed compartment is the proteasome. Here, a set of subunits form a hollow barrel containing proteases that degrade cytosolic proteins. Since these would be damaging if they mixed freely with {{the remainder of the}} cytosol, the barrel is capped by a set of regulatory proteins that recognize proteins with a signal directing them for degradation (a ubiquitin tag) and feed them into the proteolytic cavity.|$|E
5|$|Stars {{condense}} from {{regions of}} space of higher matter density, yet those regions are less dense than within a vacuum chamber. These regions – known as molecular clouds – consist mostly of hydrogen, with about 23 to 28 percent helium {{and a few}} percent heavier elements. <b>One</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> such a star-forming region is the Orion Nebula. Most stars form in groups of dozens {{to hundreds of thousands}} of stars.|$|E
