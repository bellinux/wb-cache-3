5|$|According to a 1996 {{study by}} Barbara Metcalf, in TJ women were {{encouraged}} to participate {{since the beginning of}} the movement. Some scholars objected to the participation <b>of</b> <b>women,</b> but Muhammad Ilyas slowly gained their support and the first jamaat <b>of</b> <b>women</b> was formed in Nizamuddin, Delhi. Accompanied by a close male relative, (محرم), that is husband, brother, father or son, women are encouraged to go out in jamaats and work among other women and family members while following the rules of modesty, seclusion and segregation. They observe strict rules of hijab by covering their faces and hands. Jamaats <b>of</b> <b>women</b> sometimes participate in large annual meetings; otherwise, they commonly hold neighbourhood meetings. Since South Asian Islamic culture discourages women from going to the mosque and saintly shrines, these venues offer an opportunity for women to pray together and congregate religiously.|$|E

5|$|Before the 20th century, and in {{some cases}} as late as the 1940s, historians largely took ancient {{literary}} sources at face value as evidence for the lives <b>of</b> <b>women</b> in the ancient world.

5|$|Christian {{feminism}} is {{a branch of}} feminist theology which seeks to interpret and understand Christianity {{in light of the}} equality <b>of</b> <b>women</b> and men, and that this interpretation is necessary for a complete understanding of Christianity.

40|$|This essay {{attempts}} to define Mary Wollstonecraft’s Mary: A Fiction and Maria or The Wrongs <b>of</b> <b>Woman</b> as early feminist propaganda from its historical perspective.

The conclusion reached is that Wollstonecraft had a political and feminist aim when writing her novels as there are many similarities between Mary: A Fiction and Maria or The Wrongs <b>of</b> <b>Woman</b> and her political text A Vindication of the Rights <b>of</b> <b>Woman.</b> Thus, it is possible to regard Mary: A Fiction and Maria or The Wrongs <b>of</b> <b>Woman</b> as early feminist propaganda...|$|R
