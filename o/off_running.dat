5|$|Jeff Glaser, a local {{technician}} {{armed with}} a FLIR device, joins Fazekas, Mulder, and Scully on {{a search for the}} creature. They soon spot two creatures on the FLIR which travel in separate directions, causing the four to split up. Fazekas is attacked and disappears. Mulder deduces from this that the creatures {{may be related to the}} Mothman of Point Pleasant, West Virginia. After a brief encounter with the creatures, Glaser takes <b>off</b> <b>running</b> and is swiftly killed by a creature. Mulder is grabbed by the other creature, though it releases him after Scully manages to wound it with her firearm.|$|E
25|$|Moseley's two {{field goals}} {{were the only}} scoring in the third quarter. Then in the fourth quarter, {{defensive}} back Darrell Green intercepted a pass from Ferragamo after it bounced <b>off</b> <b>running</b> back Eric Dickerson and returned it 72 yards for a touchdown.|$|E

25|$|Ohio {{received}} the opening second half kickoff, {{but failed to}} avenge the first half time of possession deficit (ECU possessed the ball for more than 20 of the 30 minutes in the first half), and quickly punted the ball to ECU, but the Pirates also punted after an ineffective series. On Ohio's ensuing drive, Tettleton took <b>off</b> <b>running</b> on one play, and exited the game with an apparent ankle injury; Vick subsequently entered the game for one play before Tettleton's return. Later on the drive, Ohio converted a fourth down to advance into the red zone; Josiah Yazdani subsequently attempted a 29-yard field goal, which he made, tying the game, to culminate a 16-play, 60-yard drive. After exchanging punts, ECU advanced into Ohio territory on a drive highlighted by a 37-yard pass from Carden to Worthy, but that was decimated once deep in Ohio's territory by a chop block penalty, ultimately forcing the Pirates {{to settle for a}} 29-yard field goal attempt that Harvey missed wide right. At the end of the quarter, the game was tied at 17.|$|E
500|$|On February 12, with {{insufficient}} cash {{to pay his}} overdue {{rent and}} a growing suspicion that police were closing in on him, Bundy stole a car and fled Tallahassee, driving westward across the Florida Panhandle. Three days later, at around 1:00a.m., he was stopped by Pensacola police officer David Lee near the Alabama state line after a [...] "wants and warrants" [...] check showed his Volkswagen Beetle was stolen. When told he was under arrest, Bundy kicked Lee's legs {{out from under him}} and took <b>off</b> <b>running.</b> Lee fired a warning shot followed by a second round, gave chase and tackled him. The two struggled over Lee's gun before the officer finally subdued and arrested Bundy. In the stolen vehicle were three sets of IDs belonging to female FSU students, 21 stolen credit cards and a stolen television set. Also found were a pair of dark-rimmed non-prescription glasses and a pair of plaid slacks, later identified as the disguise worn by [...] "Richard Burton, Fire Department" [...] in Jacksonville. As Lee transported his suspect to jail, unaware that he had just arrested one of the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives, he heard Bundy say, [...] "I wish you had killed me." ...|$|E

But already in 1909, {{he had met}} {{a young man named}} Ernest Lea Nash (later known as Ted Healy), who was later to provide a significant boost for his career aspirations. In 1912, they both held a summer job working in Annette Kellerman's aquatic act as diving [...] "girls".|$|E
2500|$|Lane {{was adopted}} and raised by Ella Lane, {{who also had}} four other children. As a youth in Austin, Lane grew up poor, busing tables at local hotels and shining shoes on Congress Avenue. [...] He also helped his mother with a laundry {{business}} {{she ran out of}} the home. [...] Lane became known as [...] "Cue Ball" [...] and later recalled how he acquired the nickname: [...] "I was in a pool hall in 12th street. We were playing for money, maybe a dime. As soon as I made the eight ball, the other guy took <b>off</b> <b>running.</b> He didn't want to pay. I grabbed that cue ball and just as he made the corner I threw it and hit him upside the head. The guy didn't know what had hit him." ...|$|E
2500|$|On May 13, {{the body}} of a well-dressed man was found in the canal at Willow Springs, some 20 miles from Lockport and 14 miles from Albany Avenue. He had no identification, only a Catholic holy card with a prayer in Polish, with the words [...] "Sig. Hoff" [...] written on it. Detectives {{believed}} this man also may have had some connection with Elsie's death. An anonymous letter was said to have been received by the detectives. The writer described having seen a little girl walking along the canal with a young man the day Elsie disappeared. On the same day, another loner living in a shack by the canal was identified as a possible person of interest. Mr. Kinsella, described as a [...] "religious enthusiast," [...] was [...] "supposed to be demented." [...] When he saw Detectives Gormley, Slad, and Froenicke approaching his home, he took <b>off</b> <b>running,</b> [...] "making a move as if to draw a revolver." [...] Calling out that they only wanted to question him, the officers fired their weapons into the air. After a three-mile chase through gullies and underbrush, Kinsella escaped into the forest.|$|E

2500|$|Gelman later {{stated that}} since {{he knew he would}} be caught, {{he was going to take}} down [...] "rats" [...] who had wronged him. Gelman then went to the house of a female {{acquaintance}} named Yelena Bulchenko, where he killed her mother, Anna, at about 10:30a.m. He then allegedly left the crime scene and waited several hours for Yelena, who had been staying at a friend's house, to return home. Once she did, she found Anna dead and called 9-1-1, but Gelman was on his way back to the scene to check if she returned home. Upon arrival at about 4:00p.m., he spotted her outside on the phone and got out of the car, upon which she yelled at him. He hid the knife in his jacket sleeve and approached her, but she took <b>off</b> <b>running.</b> However, Gelman caught up with her and stabbed her eleven times, killing her, before speeding off in Kuznetsov's car. Ramming into another car, Gelman stabbed and wounded the driver, Arthur DiCrescento, three times when he confronted him, before carjacking the vehicle. Gelman later ran down 62-year-old pedestrian Stephen Tanenbaum, who subsequently died of his injuries.|$|E
2500|$|Helmer took <b>off</b> <b>running</b> to the north-east, {{through the}} hills, toward Schuyler Lake and then north to Andrustown (near present-day Jordanville, New York) where he warned his sister’s {{family of the}} {{impending}} raid and obtained fresh footwear. He also warned settlers at Columbia and Petrie’s Corners, most of whom then fled to safety at Fort Dayton. When Helmer arrived at the fort, severely torn up from his run, he told Colonel Peter Bellinger, {{the commander of the}} fort, that he had counted at least 200 of the attackers en route to the valley. [...] (see Attack on German Flatts (1778)). The straight-line distance from Carr’s farm to Fort Dayton is about thirty miles, and Helmer’s winding and hilly route was far from straight. It was said that Helmer then slept for 36 hours straight. During his sleep, on September 17, 1778, the farms of the area were destroyed by Brant’s raid. The total loss of property in the raid was reported as: 63 houses, 59 barns, full of grain, 3 grist mills, 235 horses, 229 horned cattle, 279 sheep, and 93 oxen. Only two men were reported killed in the attack, one by refusing to leave his home when warned.|$|E
2500|$|Jesse is an Australian {{resistance}} sailor and Derek Reese's love interest. In her timeline, she {{sailed to}} Australia to deliver supplies aboard the upgraded nuclear submarine , captained by a reprogrammed Terminator, Queeg, {{of which she}} is the executive officer. Queeg diverts the submarine {{to pick up a}} package and return it to John Connor. Her crew is curious of what is in the package so they open it. Inside is a T-1001 and one of the crew members, a woman, points her gun at it. The T-1001 kills her and takes her form, then shakes its finger at the rest of the crew. Queeg kills a crewman after he beat on Jesse. Jesse does not trust Queeg so she relieves him of command. Queeg does not obey her orders so she terminates him and destroys the submarine in an attempt to kill the T-1001. On her way out, she encounters the T-1001 and it tells her, [...] "the answer is no." [...] In 2007, she is on a possibly self-imposed mission to find and stop Cameron from adversely influencing young John, by recruiting Riley Dawson in the future and bringing her back to frame Cameron for her murder. In the future from which Jesse comes, John has withdrawn from humans and speaks only with Cameron. It is unclear whether this mission is self-appointed, but comments by her and the fact she was able to access the time travel machinery with Riley suggests others in the Resistance leadership group may share her concerns about Cameron's influence on John. John Connor later figures out that Jesse killed Riley and informs Derek, but orders her life to be spared. Derek confronts Jesse. He tells her that they are from two different futures and that he doesn't know who she is. He tells her, [...] "John Connor wanted to let you go. I'm not John Connor." [...] He pulls his gun on her and she takes <b>off</b> <b>running.</b> Whether or not Derek actually kills her is left ambiguous, although he does pull the trigger on his handgun. When asked about it by John he just says, [...] "John Connor wanted to let her go." [...] This could either mean that he obeyed John Connor's order or since he is not John Connor, he didn't want to let her go and he shot her. Later on in a flashback, Cameron is seen talking to Jesse. Cameron tells her that she is sorry for her loss. She says that the pressure from leaving the submarine killed her baby, she was pregnant with Derek's baby. Jesse tells Cameron, [...] "Tell John Connor it said [...] "The answer is no"" [...] Then, Jesse asks Cameron, [...] "If the answer is no, what was the question?" [...] Cameron answers with, [...] "Will you join us?" [...] Cameron tells Derek about the miscarriage and he says he never had any kids.|$|E
