40|$|ABSTRACT. Projected {{growth in}} the elderly {{population}} is expected to impact all aspects of society, including <b>our</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>systems,</b> transportation, and housing, and if current trends continue, the <b>health</b> <b>care</b> needs of older adults {{are likely to be}} the primary concern. Therefore, the importance of education in promoting positive health behaviors to prevent and relieve chronic illness among the elderly cannot be overstated. Educational programs that focus on maintaining health and fitness as long as possible will help elders age well, and prevent unnecessary strain on <b>our</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> and social service systems. In this paper, we address what educators {{need to know about the}} unique issues involved in teaching the senior population, and what we learned from teaching an interactive class on senior health and wellness. During the next 20 years we will witness a record {{growth in the}} number of older adults worldwide. By 2030, approximately 1 in 5 Americans (71 million people) will be 65 years of age or older. Nevada has the fastest growing senior population, experiencing a 72 % increase in 65 + year olds between 1990 and 2000 (U. S. Census Bureau, 2005 a). Nevada’s oldest-old population (those 85 + years) has doubled since 1990.
