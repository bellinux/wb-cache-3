In both cases, the arousal of organizational learning curves is conceived as the emergence of routines. In both cases, the conditions for this to occur are that (i) there are sufficiently many novel possibilities of arranging the units composing the organization, and that (ii) these units are sufficiently many and sufficiently flexible. ...|$|R

25|$|A false consequent, in contrast, is a {{conclusion}} {{known to be}} false, fictional, imaginary, or insufficient. In a conditional statement, a fictional conclusion {{is known as a}} non sequitur, which literally means <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sequence.</b> A conclusion that is <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sequence</b> is not contingent on any premises that precede it, and it does not follow from them, so such a sequence is not conditional. A conditional sequence is a connected series of statements. A false consequent cannot follow from true premises in a connected sequence.

After the Chinese crossed the Jinsha River and defeated the Tibetan army in October 1950, a Tibetan delegation was sent to Beijing and agreed on the Seventeen Point Agreement for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet. Meanwhile, the Dalai Lama left Lhasa and took refuge on the border with India and Sikkim. The Dalai Lama disliked the agreement. He returned to Lhasa, and for several years tried to work within its terms.|$|E
25|$|An early {{development}} of sequential control was relay logic, by which electrical relays engage electrical contacts which either start or interrupt {{power to a}} device. Relays were first used in telegraph networks before being developed for controlling other devices, such as when starting and stopping industrial-sized electric motors or opening and closing solenoid valves. Using relays for control purposes allowed event-driven control, where actions could be triggered <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sequence,</b> in response to external events. These were more flexible in their response than the rigid single-sequence cam timers. More complicated examples involved maintaining safe sequences for devices such as swing bridge controls, where a lock bolt needed to be disengaged before the bridge could be moved, and the lock bolt could not be released until the safety gates had already been closed.|$|E

500|$|The A.V.

However, Fox decided that [...] "Serenity" [...] was unsuitable to open the series, and [...] "The Train Job" [...] was specifically created to act as a new pilot. In addition, Firefly was promoted as an action-comedy rather than the more serious character study it was intended to be, and the showbiz trade paper Variety noted Fox's decision to occasionally preempt the show for sporting events.|$|E

This paper aims at bringing them into consideration also by the research communities of evolutionary computation and of computational approaches to the evolution of behaviour, which are still overly dominated by the adaptationist tradition.
