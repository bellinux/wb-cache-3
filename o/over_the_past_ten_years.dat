Bozell is a prominent conservative activist who has, among other things, served as Executive Director of the Conservative Victory Committee, a political action committee that has supported the election of dozens of conservative candidates <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>ten</b> <b>years.</b> He was also National Finance Chairman for Pat Buchanan's 1992 presidential campaign, and later president of the National Conservative Political Action Committee. Bozell was succeeded as PTC President by Timothy F. Winter. Winter served as Executive Director of the PTC for three years prior to becoming president. Prior to joining the PTC, Mr. Winter's 20-year career as a media executive included positions with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and NBC. Until 2015 when his position was terminated, Dan Isett, Director of Corporate and Government Affairs of the PTC, represented the PTC on the Consumer Advisory Committee of the Federal Communications Commission.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to continuing descriptive {{studies of the}} effects of infection by defense mutualist endophytes, there has been a sharp {{increase in the number of}} studies which delve further into the ecology of plant-fungus associations and especially their multi-trophic impacts. The processes by which endophytic fungi alter plant physiology and volatile chemical levels are virtually unknown, and limited current results show a lack of consistency under differing environmental conditions, especially differing levels of herbivory. Studies comparing the relative impacts of mutualistic endophytes on inducible defenses and tolerance show a central function of infection in determining both responses to herbivore damage. On the whole, molecular mechanisms behind endophyte-mediated plant defense has been an increasing focus of research <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>ten</b> <b>years.</b>|$|E
25|$|However, {{according}} to a study commissioned by the German industry association BGW in 2006, the average household water bill was only 82 euro per year in Germany, lower than in France or in England and Wales, but higher than in Italy. The study shows that subsidies are more prevalent in the three comparator countries and service levels are lower. Taking into account these differences, the cost of supplying water at an equalized service level would be 84 euros in Germany, 106 euro in both France and England/Wales, and 74 euro in Italy. The apparent discrepancy between higher unit tariffs and lower bills is due to the lower water consumption in Germany. Water tariffs have remained stable in real terms <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>ten</b> <b>years.</b>|$|E

Of minority students, 48% are Hispanic, 24% Asian American, 16% African American, and 12% Native American. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>ten</b> <b>years,</b> minority enrollment has increased 35%, from 2,361 to 3,178, an increase from 10.9% to 13.2% of the student population.

25|$|Since 2004, India had {{not been}} doing as well in One-day Internationals. The players who took India to great heights <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>ten</b> <b>years</b> such as Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and Anil Kumble grew older and did not {{maintain}} their form and fitness. Following the series loss to Australia, India collapsed {{on the final day}} in the Third Test in Bangalore in early 2005 against Pakistan to squander a series victory, and then lost four consecutive ODIs against Pakistan. This was exacerbated by the suspension handed to captain Ganguly for slow over-rates. Greg Chappell took over from John Wright as the new coach of the Indian cricket team following the series, and replaced Kumble and V. V. S. Laxman from the ODI team with younger players. India's unconvincing ODI form continued, scraping past a West Indian team depleted by industrial action in the 2005 Indian Oil Cup and a similarly depleted Zimbabwean team only to be defeated twice in the finals by New Zealand, continuing a poor ODI finals record.|$|E
