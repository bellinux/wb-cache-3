50|$|The native food {{plants of}} the larvae are Casuarina species. The larvae {{feed on the}} needles. Young larvae feed on young needles, while older larvae feed on <b>older</b> <b>needles.</b> They only consume {{a small portion of}} a needle, the rest drops to the ground. Pupation takes place in the needles on the tree or on the ground in a cocoon made of tied up needles.|$|E
50|$|This sawfly has 1 or 2 generations per year. In Ontario, {{the larvae}} overwinter in cocoons in the litter layer and change into pupae in the spring. The adults emerge soon thereafter. Males are very rare, and {{reproduction}} usually takes place without fertilization. The females {{lay their eggs}} in slits cut in the needles. Upon hatching, the larvae feed on the <b>older</b> <b>needles</b> in June and July. Full-grown larvae (about 20 mm long) drop {{to the ground and}} spin cocoons. The adults emerge within a month and lay their eggs, the (second-generation) larvae from which feed from mid-August through September.|$|E

The results underline that silvicultural practices reduce plant density favouring the natural growth {{pattern of the}} Pine: the largest structural changes are observed between 15 and 34 years old stands, by Pine stem height elongation and the increased canopy volume. Crown height increases up to 34 years then decreasing at 104 years old stands. LAI changes with stand density and Pine developmental stage. Pine biomass changes accordingly, reaching the highest value at 104 years <b>old</b> stands. <b>Needles</b> morphology varies significantly between one and two year <b>old</b> <b>needles.</b> LMA shows the highest value in 34 years old stands.

50|$|The {{symptoms}} {{give the}} disease its name. The {{first signs of}} infection {{that can be seen}} are yellow and brown spots that develop on the living needles, which soon turn red. This infection starts on the base of the crown on <b>older</b> <b>needles,</b> which then turn a brownish red at the tip, {{while the rest of the}} needle continues to remain green. This can be seen clearly between the months of June and July, after which the needles begin to 'turn up', much like a lions tale. This infection is then passed on to the following years growth, which continues year after year. This ongoing spread of infection weakens the tree over time, with larger percentages of crown infection leading to lower yields of timber and, in some cases, to the mortality of the tree.|$|E
50|$|The insect overwinters {{underground}} as a larva in a dark-brown papery cocoon {{encrusted with}} soil (Rose and Lindquist 1985). In the spring, the cocoon changes into a pupa, {{from which the}} adult emerges, mainly in May or June at {{about the time the}} spruce bud scales are sloughed off. The spring-emerging females lay their eggs in shallow slits at the base of expanding needles, generally 1 per needle. Hatching takes place in 6 to 14 days, and the larvae feed in groups on the new needles until only short, brown stubs are left, after which the larvae move back on the twig to feed on the <b>older</b> <b>needles</b> until they are full-grown—usually in late July or early August. Larvae drop to the ground and spin overwintering cocoons. A single generation occurs per season.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} webspinning sawflies feed on spruce, {{but most of}} them are rare and solitary feeders, Cephalcia fascipennis Cresson being the most common (Rose and Lindquist 1985). It {{occasionally}} causes damage to ornamental spruce trees or hedges across Canada and the northeastern United States. The larvae overwinter in cells in the ground and pupate in the spring. The adults soon emerge and the female lays green cylindrical eggs singly or in end-to-end rows of 2 to 4 on the needle. On hatching, the larvae construct shelters of silk and excreta at the crotch of a twig and branch. The larvae forage from these shelters by cutting the <b>older</b> <b>needles</b> and eating them from the base outwards, usually leaving the tips of the needles which may be incorporated into the shelters. Larvae of this family typically have elongate antennae, bear a pair of jointed appendages at the posterior end, and lack abdominal legs. The colour is variable, but the head is usually dark and the body brownish with a reddish line along the back. Full-grown larvae, about 25 mm long, drop to the ground to overwinter.|$|E

40|$|Two-year-old {{seedlings}} of Sitka spruce {{were exposed}} to 70 nl 1 − 1 ozone or to filtered air over three successive summers in outdoor large-scale fumigation chambers (Solardomes). Seven months after the last period {{of exposure to the}} pollutant and just prior to budburst, upper-surface chlorisis affecting only the <b>older</b> <b>needles</b> of ozone-exposed trees was observed. In many respects, the symptoms appeared to be similar to those characteristic of type 1 spruce damage occurring in parts of mainland Europe. Chlorophyll pigments were reduced in the ozone-exposed older foliage, but no change in the ratio of chlorophylls to carotene was observed. The content of ascorbic acid was clearly related to the amount of foliar damage observed on the trees exposed to ozone and the largest increases were seen in those trees which were most visibly damaged. Although none of the foliage examined was deficient in any of the nutrient cations which were measured, the concentration of Mg in the <b>older</b> <b>needles</b> was significantly reduced by exposure to ozone, irrespective of damage symptoms. Exposure to ozone also resulted in increases in the ratios of K: Mg and Ca: Mg. In the <b>older</b> <b>needles,</b> leaching of Mg 2 − and K− by 0. 5 mM H 2 SO 4, pH 3. 0, was enhanced by prior exposure to ozone, but the amounts removed were small (< 6 %).

Dark respiration rate, specific leaf area (SLA) and the concentrations of starch and soluble sugars in needles were measured in the fourth year. Respiration rates, on both an area and a mass basis, and SLA decreased in EC relative to CON, but increased in ET and EC+ET, regardless of needle age class. Starch and soluble sugar concentrations for a given needle age class increased in EC, but decreased slightly in ET and EC+ET. Respiration rates and SLA were highest in current-year needles in all treatments, whereas starch and soluble sugar concentrations were highest in 1 -year-old needles. Relative to that of <b>older</b> <b>needles,</b> respiration of current-year needles was inhibited less by EC, but increased in response to ET and EC+ET.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we show spatial carbon isotope {{variations}} in black pine (Pinus nigra Arnold) needles, collected in spring 2001 and autumn 2003, from {{trees at the}} coast of south-western Croatia island (Žirje) and southern Spain (Benalmadena near Malaga), respectively. Needles were segmented perpendicularly to the longer axis (base, middle and top) and each segment was analysed separately. d 13 C values in needles from Croatia varied between - 26. 65 ‰ to - 24. 43 ‰ (2 months <b>old</b> <b>needles)</b> and from - 28. 25 ‰ to - 25. 21 ‰ (1 year <b>old</b> <b>needles),</b> while d 13 C values in needles from Spain varied from - 27. 58 ‰ to - 25. 27 ‰. The difference between d 13 Cb (base) and d 13 Ct (top) in the same needle (D 13 Cb-t) varied from 1. 85 to 2. 05 ‰ (in young needles from Croatia), from 0, 02 to 1, 80 ‰ (young needles from Spain), and 1. 16 to 2. 32 ‰, (in <b>old</b> <b>needles</b> from Croatia).

This evidences that carbon isotopes are not retranslocated after its fixation into the leaf structure (after the growth process is over). Temperature variation was most probably negligible for the discovered intraneedle carbon isotope distribution. Although, the intraneedle carbon isotope inhomogeneity can be partly the result of seasonal variation in d 13 C of atmospheric CO 2, most probably the remarkably high D 13 Cb-t values, and regular pattern, are predominantly resulting from isotopic and chemical composition of primary and secondary products contained in the growin part of needle and kinetic isotope fractionation during decomposition of storage materials at the base...|$|R

30|$|Although {{these models}} predict that xylem {{cavitation}} will occur under some conditions, {{it is not}} evident where the cavitation will occur within the xylem. It has been demonstrated that branch junctions and leaf connections are points of high resistance to water flow within the stem (Zimmermann 1983, Tyree and Sperry 1988) and thus {{would be the most}} likely location for xylem cavitation. The older branches in the lower canopy are also found to have more resistance to water flow relative to the upper canopy (Zimmermann 1983). Therefore, the hydraulic architecture of the tree suggests that cavitation would occur at branch and leaf junctions especially in older branches and perhaps <b>older</b> <b>needles.</b> The loss of older branches and foliage would not be as detrimental compared to loss of newer foliage and branches that are typically located in full sun.|$|E
