40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} whether advanced visualizations of spirography-based objective measures {{are useful in}} differentiating drug-related motor dysfunctions between Off and dyskinesia in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Background: During {{the course of a}} 3 year longitudinal clinical study, in total 65 patients (43 males and 22 females with mean age of 65) with advanced PD and 10 healthy elderly (HE) subjects (5 males and 5 females with mean age of 61) were assessed. Both patients and HE subjects performed repeated and time-stamped assessments of their objective health indicators using a test battery implemented on a telemetry touch screen handheld computer, in their home environment settings. Among other tasks, the subjects were asked to trace a pre-drawn Archimedes spiral using the dominant hand and repeat the test three times per test occasion. Methods: A web-based framework was developed to enable a visual exploration of relevant spirography-based kinematic features by clinicians so they can in turn evaluate the motor states of the patients i. e. Off and dyskinesia. The system uses different visualization techniques such as time series plots, animation, and interaction and organizes them into different views to aid clinicians in measuring spatial and time-dependent irregularities that could be associated with the motor states. Along with the animation view, the system displays two time series plots for representing drawing speed (blue line) and displacement from ideal trajectory (orange line). The views are coordinated and linked i. e. user interactions in one of the views will be reflected in other views. For instance, when the user points in one of the pixels in the spiral view, the circle size of the underlying pixel increases and a vertical line appears in the time series views to depict the corresponding position. In addition, in order to enable clinicians to observe erratic movements more clearly and thus improve the detection of irregularities, the system displays a color-map which gives an idea of the longevity of the spirography task. Figure 2 shows single randomly selected spirals drawn by a: A) patient who experienced dyskinesias, B) HE subject, and C) patient in Off state. Results: According to a domain expert (DN), the spirals drawn in the Off and dyskinesia motor states are characterized by different spatial and time features. For instance, the spiral shown in Fig. 2 A was drawn by a patient who showed symptoms of dyskinesia; the drawing speed was relatively high (cf. blue-colored time series plot and the short timestamp scale in the x axis) and the spatial displacement was high (cf. orange-colored time series plot) associated with smooth deviations as a result of uncontrollable movements. The patient also exhibited low amount of hesitation which could be reflected both in the animation of the spiral as well as time series plots. In contrast, the patient who was in the Off state exhibited different kinematic features, as shown in Fig. 2 C. In the case of spirals drawn by a HE subject, there was a great precision during the drawing process as well as unchanging levels of time-dependent features over the test trial, as seen in Fig. 2 B. Conclusions: Visualizing spirography-based objective measures enables identification of trends and patterns of drug-related motor dysfunctions at the patient’s individual level. Dynamic access of visualized motor tests may be useful during the evaluation of drug-related complications such as under- and <b>over-medications,</b> providing decision support to clinicians during evaluation of treatment effects as well as {{improve the quality of life}} of patients and their caregivers. In future, we plan to evaluate the proposed approach by assessing within- and between-clinician variability in ratings in order to determine its actual usefulness and then use these ratings as target outcomes in supervised machine learning, similarly as it was previously done in the study performed by Memedi et al. (2013) ...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{develop a}} method for {{objective}} assessment of fine motor timing variability in Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients, using digital spiral data gathered by a touch screen device. BACKGROUND: A retrospective analysis was conducted on data from 105 subjects including 65 patients with advanced PD (group A), 15 intermediate patients experiencing motor fluctuations (group I), 15 early stage patients (group S), and 10 healthy elderly subjects (HE) were examined. The {{subjects were asked to}} perform repeated upper limb motor tasks by tracing a pre-drawn Archimedes spiral as shown on the screen of the device. The spiral tracing test was performed using an ergonomic pen stylus, using dominant hand. The test was repeated three times per test occasion and the subjects were instructed to complete it within 10 seconds. Digital spiral data including stylus position (x-ycoordinates) and timestamps (milliseconds) were collected and used in subsequent analysis. The total number of observations with the test battery were as follows: Swedish group (n= 10079), Italian I group (n= 822), Italian S group (n = 811), and HE (n= 299). METHODS: The raw spiral data were processed with three data processing methods. To quantify motor timing variability during spiral drawing tasks Approximate Entropy (APEN) method was applied on digitized spiral data. APEN is designed to capture the amount of irregularity or complexity in time series. APEN requires determination of two parameters, namely, the window size and similarity measure. In our work and after experimentation, window size was set to 4 and similarity measure to 0. 2 (20 % of the standard deviation of the time series). The final score obtained by APEN was normalized by total drawing completion time and used in subsequent analysis. The score generated by this method is hence on denoted APEN. In addition, two more methods were applied on digital spiral data and their scores were used in subsequent analysis. The first method was based on Digital Wavelet Transform and Principal Component Analysis and generated a score representing spiral drawing impairment. The score generated by this method is hence on denoted WAV. The second method was based on standard deviation of frequency filtered drawing velocity. The score generated by this method is hence on denoted SDDV. Linear mixed-effects (LME) models were used to evaluate mean differences of the spiral scores of the three methods across the four subject groups. Test-retest reliability of the three scores was assessed after taking mean of the three possible correlations (Spearman’s rank coefficients) between the three test trials. Internal consistency of the methods was assessed by calculating correlations between their scores. RESULTS: When comparing mean spiral scores between the four subject groups, the APEN scores were different between HE subjects and three patient groups (P= 0. 626 for S group with 9. 9 % mean value difference, P= 0. 089 for I group with 30. 2 %, and P= 0. 0019 for A group with 44. 1 %). However, {{there were no significant differences}} in mean scores of the other two methods, except for the WAV between the HE and A groups (P< 0. 001). WAV and SDDV were highly and significantly correlated to each other with a coefficient of 0. 69. However, APEN was not correlated to neither WAV nor SDDV with coefficients of 0. 11 and 0. 12, respectively. Test-retest reliability coefficients of the three scores were as follows: APEN (0. 9), WAV(0. 83) and SD-DV (0. 55). CONCLUSIONS: The results show that the digital spiral analysis-based objective APEN measure is able to significantly differentiate the healthy subjects from patients at advanced level. In contrast to the other two methods (WAV and SDDV) that are designed to quantify dyskinesias (<b>over-medications),</b> this method can be useful for characterizing Off symptoms in PD. The APEN was not correlated to none of the other two methods indicating that it measures a different construct of upper limb motor function in PD patients than WAV and SDDV. The APEN also had a better test-retest reliability indicating that it is more stable and consistent over time than WAV and SDDV.

40|$|Objective To design, {{develop and}} set up a web-based system for {{enabling}} graphical visualization of upper limb motor performance (ULMP) of Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients to clinicians. Background Sixty-five patients diagnosed with advanced PD have used a test battery, implemented in a touch-screen handheld computer, in their home environment settings {{over the course of a}} 3 -year clinical study. The test items consisted of objective measures of ULMP through a set of upper limb motor tests (finger to tapping and spiral drawings). For the tapping tests, patients were asked to perform alternate tapping of two buttons as fast and accurate as possible, first using the right hand and then the left hand. The test duration was 20 seconds. For the spiral drawing test, patients traced a pre-drawn Archimedes spiral using the dominant hand, and the test was repeated 3 times per test occasion. In total, the study database consisted of symptom assessments during 10079 test occasions. Methods Visualization of ULMP The web-based system is used by two neurologists for assessing the performance of PD patients during motor tests collected over the course of the said study. The system employs animations, scatter plots and time series graphs to visualize the ULMP of patients to the neurologists. The performance during spiral tests is depicted by animating the three spiral drawings, allowing the neurologists to observe real-time accelerations or hesitations and sharp changes during the actual drawing process. The tapping performance is visualized by displaying different types of graphs. Information presented included distribution of taps over the two buttons, horizontal tap distance vs. time, vertical tap distance vs. time, and tapping reaction time over the test length. Assessments Different scales are utilized by the neurologists to assess the observed impairments. For the spiral drawing performance, the neurologists rated firstly the ‘impairment’ using a 0 (no impairment) – 10 (extremely severe) scale, secondly three kinematic properties: ‘drawing speed’, ‘irregularity’ and ‘hesitation’ using a 0 (normal) – 4 (extremely severe) scale, and thirdly the probable ‘cause’ for the said impairment using 3 choices including Tremor, Bradykinesia/Rigidity and Dyskinesia. For the tapping performance, a 0 (normal) – 4 (extremely severe) scale is used for first rating four tapping properties: ‘tapping speed’, ‘accuracy’, ‘fatigue’, ‘arrhythmia’, and then the ‘global tapping severity’ (GTS). To achieve a common basis for assessment, initially one neurologist (DN) performed preliminary ratings by browsing through the database to collect and rate at least 20 samples of each GTS level and at least 33 samples of each ‘cause’ category. These preliminary ratings were then observed by the two neurologists (DN and PG) to be used as templates for rating of tests afterwards. In another track, the system randomly selected one test occasion per patient and visualized its items, that is tapping and spiral drawings, to the two neurologists. Statistical methods Inter-rater agreements were assessed using weighted Kappa coefficient. The internal consistency of properties of tapping and spiral drawing tests were assessed using Cronbach’s α test. One-way ANOVA test followed by Tukey multiple comparisons test was used to test if mean scores of properties of tapping and spiral drawing tests were different among GTS and ‘cause’ categories, respectively. Results When rating tapping graphs, inter-rater agreements (Kappa) were as follows: GTS (0. 61), ‘tapping speed’ (0. 89), ‘accuracy’ (0. 66), ‘fatigue’ (0. 57) and ‘arrhythmia’ (0. 33). The poor inter-rater agreement when assessing “arrhythmia” may be as a result of observation of different things in the graphs, among the two raters. When rating animated spirals, both raters had very good agreement when assessing severity of spiral drawings, that is, ‘impairment’ (0. 85) and irregularity (0. 72). However, there were poor agreements between the two raters when assessing ‘cause’ (0. 38) and time-information properties like ‘drawing speed’ (0. 25) and ‘hesitation’ (0. 21). Tapping properties, that is ‘tapping speed’, ‘accuracy’, ‘fatigue’ and ‘arrhythmia’ had satisfactory internal consistency with a Cronbach’s α coefficient of 0. 77. In general, the trends of mean scores of tapping properties worsened with increasing levels of GTS. The mean scores of the four properties were significantly different to each other, only at different levels. In contrast from tapping properties, kinematic properties of spirals, that is ‘drawing speed’, ‘irregularity’ and ‘hesitation’ had a questionable consistency among them with a coefficient of 0. 66. Bradykinetic spirals were associated with more impaired speed (mean = 83. 7 % worse, P < 0. 001) and hesitation (mean = 77. 8 % worse, P < 0. 001), compared to dyskinetic spirals. Both these ‘cause’ categories had similar mean scores of ‘impairment’ and ‘irregularity’. Conclusions In contrast from current approaches used in clinical setting for the assessment of PD symptoms, this system enables clinicians to animate easily and realistically the ULMP of patients who at the same time are at their homes. Dynamic access of visualized motor tests may also be useful when observing and evaluating therapy-related complications such as under- and <b>over-medications.</b> In future, we foresee to utilize these manual ratings for developing and validating computer methods for automating the process of assessing ULMP of PD patients...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} examine {{the root causes of}} <b>over-medication</b> in China. I have applied Donald Light’s {{theoretical}} model of “Countervailing Powers” in the context of socio-economic transition in China, focusing on the important causes of <b>over-medication</b> (over-prescription) in the healthcare system and seeking to explore how the interacting powers of government, the pharmaceutical industry and the medical profession relate to the phenomenon of prescription drug over-use. The study has mainly used documentary and interview research methods. The primary methods of data collection are: 1) a review of documents and literatures obtained from governmental (e. g. MOH report and Year Book of Public Health, etc.) and non-governmental sources, and 2) semi-structured and structured interviews that focus on doctors in Shandong Province. The findings of this thesis suggest that a complex of interactive social relationships in China causes its problem of <b>over-medication.</b> These include insufficient government subsidy for hospitals and doctors, loopholes in the drug pricing policy and regulations, close ties between the pharmaceutical industry and doctors, doctors’ prescribing practice, and the financial incentives involved in drug sales. This thesis is the first study to apply the countervailing powers theory in China’s healthcare context. The study of the interaction between different groups of actors in the healthcare domain provides a novel understanding of the phenomenon of <b>over-medication</b> in China. The findings are expected to {{contribute to the development of}} strategies and recommendations that could reduce drug over-use and improve the healthcare system by improving policy design, implementation and evaluation, doctors’ prescribing behaviour and the doctor–patient relationship.

40|$|Children {{in foster}} care and youth {{involved}} in {{the juvenile justice system}} are prescribed psychotropic medications at alarmingly high rates. Foster children are given psychotropic medications at a rate nine times higher than children not {{in foster care}}. And over fifty percent of the youth involved in the juvenile justice system are prescribed psychotropic medications within one month of intake. While psychotropic medications can be a useful part of a child’s treatment plan, <b>over-medication</b> causes these children and youth to “act like zombies”, contemplate harming themselves, or worse, commit suicide. Additionally, the side effects of <b>over-medication</b> are endless. They can range from, but are not limited to, the less severe to the most extreme – anxiety, dizziness, confusion, and changes in behavior, to excessive weight gain, seizures, and death from liver failure. Children in foster care and youth in the juvenile justice system are overmedicated because they are often prescribed psychotropic medication: (1) without informed consent by the child, his/her parent, or the court-appointed guardian; (2) without the review of a full medical history and diagnostic assessment, without record keeping by the agency who has custody of the child, without protocols to monitor and review medication use on a short or long-term basis, and with inadequate court oversight; (3) to control behavior, often concomitantly with other psychotropic medication, in dosages exceeding the maximum recommendation, and for off-label use; and (4) without previous or concurrent use of any alternate therapies or psychosocial treatments.

40|$|Paracetamol {{is widely}} used and {{effective}} {{for the management of}} dental pain in the UK. Acute dental pain is a recognised precipitant of unintentional paracetamol overdose and in a small but significant number of cases this results in hepatotoxicity. Patients' understanding of the risks of excess paracetamol ingestion remains poor and risk of <b>over-medication</b> before presentation is increased due to a variety of factors including dental anxiety and fragmented provision of dental emergency services. Early recognition of overdose is crucial to preventing significant hepatotoxicity and death.

40|$|Over {{the past}} few years the use of stimulants such as {{methylphenidate}} and modafinil among the student population has attracted considerable debate in the pages of bioethics journals. Under the rubric of cognitive enhancement, bioethicists have discussed this use of stimulants—along with future technologies of enhancement—and have launched a sometimes forceful debate of such practices. In the following paper, it is argued that even if we focus solely upon current practices, the term cognitive enhancement encompasses a wide range of ethical considerations that can usefully be addressed without the need for speculation. In taking this position it is suggested that we divide cognitive enhancement into a series of empirically-constructed frameworks—medical risks and benefits, self-medication and under-prescription, prescription drug abuse and <b>over-medication,</b> and finally, the intention to cognitively enhance. These are not mutually exclusive frameworks, but provide a way in which to identify the scope of the issue at hand and particular ethical and medical questions that may be relevant to enhancement. By a process of elimination it is suggested that we can indeed talk of cognitive enhancement as an observable set of practices. However, in doing so we should be aware of how academic commentaries and discussion may be seen as both capturing reality and reifying cognitive enhancement as an entity...|$|E
40|$|Background: In the United Kingdom, an {{approach}} to improving end-of-life care has been the introduction of ‘just in case’ or ‘anticipatory’ medications. Nurses are often responsible for deciding when to use anticipatory medications, but {{little is known about}} their experiences. Aim: To examine nurses’ decisions, aims and concerns when using anticipatory medications. Design: An ethnographic study in two UK regions, using observations and interviews with nurses working in community and nursing home teams (n = 8). Findings: Observations (n = 83) and interviews (n = 61) with community nurses. Nurses identified four ‘conditions’ that needed to be established before they implemented anticipatory medications: (1) irreversibility; (2) inability to take oral medication; (3) where the patient was able, they should consent and (4) decision had to be independent of demands or requests from patient’s relatives. By using anticipation medications, nurses sought to enable patients to be ‘comfortable and settled’ by provision of gradual relief of symptoms at the lowest dose possible. They aimed to respond quickly to needs, seeking to avoid hospital admission or medical call-out, while adhering to local prescribing policies. Worries included distinguishing between pain and agitation, balancing risks of under- and <b>over-medication</b> and the possibility of hastening death. Conclusion: Nurses take {{a leading role in the}} administration of anticipatory medications. Nurses apply consideration and caution to the administration of anticipatory medications but some experience emotional burden. Education, training and experience played a role in the nurses’ confidence and should continue to be central to efforts to improving the quality of palliative care in the community and nursing homes...|$|E
40|$|Family use and {{understanding}} of modern medicines was studied in two villages in rural Bahia, Brazil. It emerged that pharmaceuticals figure {{in the treatment of}} most reported health problems. Nursing infants above all are treated with drugs frequently and intensively. The three most commonly used medicine-groups are antibiotics, analgesics and vitamins. The majority of these medications are 'prescribed' by a pharmacy attendant or the patient himself. Roughly half of the applied medications appear on neither the WHO list nor the Brazilian national list of 'essential drugs'. In almost one third of the cases studied 'dangerous' substances were used. If we consider the medications in use from a strictly biomedical viewpoint, it must be said that between half and two thirds of them ought to be regarded as irrational. A lot of money, moreover, is being spent on modern medicines. In one of the two villages, each week every family spent, on the average, a full day's wages to obtain a wide range of medications. The attitude of the families studied towards modern pharmaceuticals was highly positive. In general, people held the view that medicines should be used in the event of any sickness or discomfort. Possible hazards accruing from the use of modern medicines were scarcely acknowledged, if at all. Furthermore the notion obtained that many drugs should be used {{at the same time in}} cases of severe illness, or whenever a quick recovery was desired. A remarkably vigorous interest in diseases and their treatment was observed. Perhaps in this keen interest was a potential solution to problems of <b>over-medication</b> and the irrational use of pharmaceuticals in the Third World.

This research project aimed to describe the reasons for declination of the seasonal influenza vaccine as well as any motivating factors that might promote vaccination among a sample of 10 public health workers at Public Health - Seattle & King County. The results would inform possible areas for Public Health - Seattle & King County to target in order to increase their organizational rates of seasonal influenza vaccination. Qualitative, semi-structured interviews were conducted with each of the participants. The subsequent transcripts were analyzed using directed content analysis [Hsieh & Shannon, 2005]; codes were developed from the research questions, interview guides, and the Health Belief Model. Participants declined for many reasons, including: lack of perceived susceptibility, lack of perceived benefits of vaccination, and concerns about the safety of the vaccine. Additionally, five categories of motivational factors emerged from the analysis: 1) evidence about influenza or seasonal influenza vaccine, 2) incentives to promote vaccination, 3) mandatory vaccination policies, 4) generalized risks of acquiring/transmitting seasonal influenza, and 5) personalized risks of acquiring/transmitting seasonal influenza. Measures adopted by Public Health - Seattle & King County that are perceived to be coercive may prompt some participants to reassert their anti-vaccination stance more firmly. Therefore, three areas were chosen for Public Health - Seattle & King County to target based on these results: 1) shifting perceptions away from influenza vaccination as a form of <b>over-medication,</b> 2) promoting vaccination as a way to benefit the common good, and 3) personalizing the risks of seasonal influenza. Pursuit of any or all of these recommendations hopefully will yield cost-effective interventions that can be utilized by Public Health - Seattle & King County to increase their organizational seasonal influenza vaccination rate...|$|E
40|$|ADHD is {{the fastest}} growing {{diagnosis}} {{of the last decade}} and there is an ongoing debate about how ADHD should be understood with a psychosocial perspective opposed to a medical perspective. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate how a Swedish daily and evening newspaper (Aftonbladet and Dagens Nyheter) portrays ADHD. Further, the study asked whether medical or social explanation is used in the discourse that appears in newspaper articles, how ADHD is described as well as which people are quoted in the articles. In this study we used Norman Fairclough´s critical discourse analysis with the 26 sampled articles which we believe highlight different perspectives on ADHD diagnosis. Our study shows that there are representatives cited in the articles from school, the judiciary and the medical field. However representatives from social work are conspicuous by their absence. We have found that there are clearly defined areas in which ADHD is written about. The largest group of stories consists of school, then crime rates, the increase in ADHD and finally a category we call life stories. Our analysis examines the discourse types used within the media discourse with regard to ADHD. We have established that medical discourse dominates when it comes to explaining ADHD. We have found some resistance against what is sometimes called psychosocial discourse and a drug sceptical discourse as evidenced by articles critical of <b>over-medication</b> and malpractice. Our analysis shows that ADHD diagnosis is represented as something unproblematic, with an undifferentiated view of diagnosis, whereby ADHD is reproduced as a taken-for-granted problem which is rarely questioned. ADHD är den snabbast växande diagnosen det senaste decenniet och det finns en pågående debatt om hur ADHD ska förstås utifrån ett psykosocialt perspektiv och ett medicinskt perspektiv. Syftet med den här studien var att studera hur en svensk dags- och kvällstidning (Aftonbladet och Dagens Nyheter) framställer ADHD. Vidare studerades om det är den medicinska eller sociala förklaringsmodellen som används i diskursen, hur ADHD beskrivs i tidningarna samt vilka personer det är som kommer till tals i artiklarna. Vi har i studien använt oss av Norman Fairclough´s kritiska diskursanalys för att analysera de 26 utvalda artiklar. Vår studie visar att det finns representanter i artiklarna från skolan, rättsväsende och det medicinska fältet. Däremot lyser representanter från socialt arbete med sin frånvaro. Vi har funnit att när det gäller den bild som ges av ADHD i media är det genomgående en reproducering av den medicinska modellen och därmed ett befästande av den rådande dominansordningen och medicinens starka ställning. Vi har funnit några drag mot det som ibland kallas psykosocial diskurs och en läkemedelsskeptisk diskurs som visar sig genom kritiska artiklar till övermedicinering och felbehandling. Analysen visar även att ADHD som diagnos omskrivs som något förgivettaget, med en onyanserad bild av diagnosen, där ADHD framställs ur ett problemperspektiv som sällan ifrågasätts...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of four research papers presenting a microdata analysis approach to assess and evaluate the Parkinson’s disease (PD) motor symptoms using smartphone-based systems. PD is a progressive neurological disorder that is characterized by motor symptoms. It is a complex disease that requires continuous monitoring and multidimensional symptom analysis. Both patients’ perception regarding common symptom and their motor function need {{to be related to}} the repeated and time-stamped assessment; with this, the full extent of patient’s condition could be revealed. The smartphone enables and facilitates the remote, long-term and repeated assessment of PD symptoms. Two types of collected data from smartphone were used, one during a three year, and another during one-day clinical study. The data were collected from series of tests consisting of tapping and spiral motor tests. During the second time scale data collection, along smartphone-based measurements patients were video recorded while performing standardized motor tasks according to Unified Parkinson’s disease rating scales (UPDRS). At first, the objective of this thesis was to elaborate the state of the art, sensor systems, and measures that were used to detect, assess and quantify the four cardinal and dyskinetic motor symptoms. This was done through a review study. The review showed that smartphones as the new generation of sensing devices are preferred since they are considered as part of patients’ daily accessories, they are available and they include high-resolution activity data. Smartphones can capture important measures such as forces, acceleration and radial displacements that are useful for assessing PD motor symptoms. Through the obtained insights from the review study, the second objective of this thesis was to investigate whether a combination of tapping and spiral drawing tests could be useful to quantify dexterity in PD. More specifically, the aim was to develop data-driven methods to quantify and characterize dexterity in PD. The results from this study showed that tapping and spiral drawing tests that were collected by smartphone can detect movements reasonably well related to under- and <b>over-medication.</b> The thesis continued by developing an Approximate Entropy (ApEn) -based method, which aimed to measure the amount of temporal irregularity during spiral drawing tests. One of the disabilities associated with PD is the impaired ability to accurately time movements. The increase in timing variability among patients when compared to healthy subjects, suggests that the Basal Ganglia (BG) has a role in interval timing. ApEn method was used to measure temporal irregularity score (TIS) which could significantly differentiate the healthy subjects and patients at different stages of the disease. This method was compared to two other methods which were used to measure the overall drawing impairment and shakiness. TIS had better reliability and responsiveness compared to the other methods. However, in contrast to other methods, the mean scores of the ApEn-based method improved significantly during a 3 -year clinical study, indicating a possible impact of pathological BG oscillations in temporal control during spiral drawing tasks. In addition, due to the data collection scheme, the study was limited to have no gold standard for validating the TIS. However, the study continued to further investigate the findings using another screen resolution, new dataset, new patient groups, and for shorter term measurements. The new dataset included the clinical assessments of patients while they performed tests according to UPDRS. The results of this study confirmed the findings in the previous study. Further investigation when assessing the correlation of TIS to clinical ratings showed the amount of temporal irregularity present in the spiral drawing cannot be detected during clinical assessment since TIS is an upper limb high frequency-based measure. ...|$|E
40|$|Psychotropic {{medications}} {{are widely}} used {{for the treatment of}} mental health problems in children and adolescents, yet there are growing concerns about their risk-benefit profile in this population. Particularly controversial is the widespread use of antidepressants, which have been associated with an increased risk of self-harm, suicidal ideation and attempts in young people. Children and adolescents also appear less likely to benefit from antidepressant treatment than adults, and may be more susceptible to adverse long-term effects. Despite these concerns, recent studies from around the world suggest that the prescription of antidepressants and other psychotropic medications to children and adolescents is increasing. This thesis investigated these issues using two different approaches: pharmacoepidemiological (Part 1) and neurobehavioural (Part 2). Chapter 1 gives an historical account of international trends {{in the use of the}} psychotropics from the 1950 s to the present day. Various key events are covered, including the introduction of the modern psychotropics during the 1950 s; the rise of sedatives, anxiolytics and hypnotics (1960 s and 1970 s); increasing use of stimulants in children (1970 s); and the emergence and increasing popularity of the second-generation antidepressants and antipsychotics (1990 s to present). It also briefly considers the drivers of these trends, with reference to historical and current controversies including changing ideology, diagnostic broadening, pharmaceutical marketing and expanding clinical uses. This chapter concludes with a focus on the particular issues surrounding the use of psychotropics in children and adolescents. Given the scarcity of systematic data on the current use of psychotropic medications in Australia, Part 1 investigated psychotropic dispensing trends using data obtained from the Department of Human Services within the Australian Government. The first study (Chapter 2) examined dispensing to the overall Australian population from the beginning of 2000 to the end of 2011. Results revealed major increases in the use of antidepressants, antipsychotics and ADHD medications, a smaller increase in mood stabilisers, relatively stable use of anxiolytics and a small decline in the use of sedatives. A second study (Chapter 3) extended on these findings, focusing on trends in the use of antidepressants, antipsychotics and ADHD medications among children, adolescents and young adults between the start of 2009 and the end of 2012. Increasing trends were observed for all three classes of drug in all age groups investigated (3 - 9 years, 10 - 14 years, 15 - 19 years, 20 - 24 years and 25 + years). Notably, more rapid increases in antidepressant and antipsychotic use were observed in those aged under 25 than in those aged over 25, although younger age groups showed much lower overall use of these psychotropics. Use of ADHD medications was highest in younger age groups and increased most rapidly in young adults aged 20 - 24 years. While prescribing patterns showed general adherence to treatment guidelines, concerns exist regarding the increasing use of serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and the likely <b>over-medication</b> of mild cases of illness. Given the marked increase in antidepressant use among children and adolescents in the Australian population and the ongoing controversy surrounding this practice, Part 2 of this thesis used a preclinical neurobiological approach to explore the effects of antidepressants on the adolescent brain and behaviour. Chapter 4 introduces to this section by reviewing the literature on the effects of antidepressants on adolescent neural development. This chapter also provides a rationale for the use of animal models in the second part of this thesis. Three preclinical studies are then presented, in which the serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant, paroxetine, is administered to adolescent and adult rats. In the first study (Chapter 5), rats were chronically treated with paroxetine in their drinking water for 22 days, during which time they were exposed to a variety of behavioural tests. Compared to adults, adolescent rats showed behavioural signs indicative of less antidepressant efficacy (in the forced swim test) and greater adverse effects (including increased anxiety and reduced social interaction), mimicking the lower efficacy and greater adverse effects often reported in adolescent humans. As little is known about the neural mechanisms underlying these effects, ex vivo analyses were conducted on serotonergic and dopaminergic markers on completion of treatment. Results revealed that markers of dopaminergic function were altered only in adults, and upregulation of the serotonin transporter occurred only in adolescents. Evidence of differential paroxetine pharmacokinetics (lower plasma levels in adolescent animals) was also obtained. A second preclinical study (Chapter 6) explored changes in hippocampal protein expression in rats treated chronically with paroxetine using the methods described above. Paroxetine-induced protein changes seen in adults were generally indicative of a neurotrophic, anti-apoptotic and antioxidant effect of the drug, as shown by upregulation of neurogenin- 1 and aldose reductase, and downregulation of cathepsin B. These effects were absent or reversed in adolescents given paroxetine. Age-specific effects on cellular signalling proteins such as phosphodiesterase 10 A and protein kinase C were also apparent. The third and final preclinical study (Chapter 7) explored age-related differences in the neural activation pattern induced by acute paroxetine (10 mg/kg) injection using c-Fos immunohistochemistry. Again, results indicated differential neural responses in adults and adolescents: Adults showed greater activation of cortical, brainstem and hypothalamic neuropeptidergic regions (such as the prelimbic cortex, Kölliker-Fuse nucleus and supraoptic nucleus), while adolescents showed more pronounced activity in dopaminergic regions (such as the ventral tegmental area). Paroxetine also increased plasma corticosterone concentrations in adults but not adolescents. There was a trend toward lower plasma paroxetine levels in adolescent rats. Chapter 8 ties together the five studies in this thesis, with a strong focus on the complex issues involved in the use of antidepressants in adolescents. Overall, this thesis shows that antidepressant treatment of children and adolescents is widespread and increasing in Australia, and that there are some significant concerns arising from current clinical practices. It also shows that antidepressant neurobehavioural effects can vary greatly according to stage of development, with atypical neural and behavioural effects of antidepressants observed in an adolescent rat model. Although conclusions are necessarily limited by the scope of the available data, these findings suggest the need for a more judicious use of antidepressants in treating children and adolescents suffering from depression and anxiety.
