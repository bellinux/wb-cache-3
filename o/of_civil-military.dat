25|$|Civil–military {{relations}} (Civ-Mil or CMR) {{describes the}} relationship between civil {{society as a whole}} and the military organization or organizations established to protect it. More narrowly, it describes {{the relationship between}} the civil authority of a given society and its military authority. Studies <b>of</b> <b>civil-military</b> relations often rest on a normative assumption that civilian control of the military is preferable to military control of the state. The principal problem they examine, however, is empirical: to explain how civilian control over the military is established and maintained.|$|E

25|$|According to Huntington {{and early}} studies <b>of</b> <b>civil-military</b> relationships, it is {{considered}} that effective civil- military relations {{should be in the}} form of objective civilian control over their armed forces. This control is indicated by the following factors; (1) the military's adoption of professional ethos and their recognition of boundaries of professional roles, (2) effective subordination of the military to civilian political leadership that formulates strategic directives on foreign and military policies, (3) recognition and approval from political leaders to the professional authorities and autonomy of the military and (4) minimal intervention of the military in politics and of politicians in military affairs.|$|E
25|$|The {{solution}} to this problem throughout most of American history was to keep its standing army small, relying on augmentation from militias (the predecessor of modern-day Reserve forces, to include the National Guard) and volunteers. While armed forces were built up during wartime, the pattern after every war up to and including World War II was to demobilize quickly and return to something approaching pre-war force levels. However, {{with the advent of the}} Cold War in the 1950s, the need to create and maintain a sizable peacetime military force engendered new concerns of militarism and about how such a large force would affect civil-military relations in the United States. For the first time in American history, the problem <b>of</b> <b>civil-military</b> relations would have to be managed during peacetime.|$|E
25|$|The March 1994 Washington Agreement, {{ended the}} Croat–Bosniak War and created {{conditions}} for provision of US {{military aid to}} Croatia. Croatia requested US military advisors from the Military Professional Resources Incorporated (MPRI) to provide training <b>of</b> <b>civil-military</b> relations, programme and budget services of the HV the same month, and the MPRI training was licensed by the US Department of State upon endorsement from Richard Holbrooke in August. The MPRI was hired because the UN arms embargo was still in place, ostensibly to prepare the HV for NATO Partnership for Peace programme participation. They trained HV officers and personnel for 14 weeks from January to April 1995. It was also speculated that the MPRI also provided doctrinal advice, scenario planning and US government satellite information to Croatia. MPRI and Croatian officials dismissed such speculation. In November 1994, the United States unilaterally ended the arms embargo against Bosnia and Herzegovina, in effect allowing the HV to supply itself as 30% of arms and ammunition shipped through Croatia was kept as a trans-shipment fee. The US involvement reflected a new military strategy endorsed by Bill Clinton since February 1993.|$|E

25|$|Feaver {{argued that}} his theory was {{different}} from other theories or models {{in that it was}} purely deductive, based on democratic theory rather than on anecdotal evidence, and better enabled analysis of day-to-day decisions and actions {{on the part of the}} civilian and military leadership It operated at the intersection of Huntington's institutional approach and Janowitz's sociological point of view. Huntington concentrated on the relationship between civilian leadership and the military qua institution while Janowitz focused on the relationship of the military qua individuals to American society. Agency theory provided a link between the two enabling an explanation of how civil-military relations work on a day-to-day basis. Specifically, agency theory would predict that the result of a regime of intrusive monitoring by the civilian leadership combined with shirking on the part of the military would result in the highest levels <b>of</b> <b>civil-military</b> conflict. Feaver suggested that post-Cold War developments had so profoundly reduced the perceived costs of monitoring and reduced the perceived expectation of punishment that the gap between what civilians ask the military to do and what the military would prefer to do had increased to unprecedented levels.|$|E

2500|$|Charles Moskos {{developed}} the institutional/occupational hypothesis {{as a means}} to promote comparative historical studies of military organization and military change. This hypothesis evolved into the Postmodern Military Model, which helped predict the course <b>of</b> <b>civil-military</b> relations {{after the end of the}} Cold War. The I/O hypothesis argued that the military was moving away from an institutional model towards one that was more occupational in nature. An institutional model presents the military as an organization highly divergent from civilian society while an occupational model presents the military more convergent with civilian structures. While Moskos did not propose that the military was ever [...] "entirely separate or entirely coterminous with civilian society", the use of a scale helped better to highlight the changing interface between the armed forces and society.|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to this apparent [...] "puzzle," [...] Peter D.

He used the concepts of [...] "working" [...] and [...] "shirking" [...] to explain {{the actions of the}} subordinate. In his construct, the principal is the civilian leadership that has the responsibility of establishing policy. The agent is the military that will work – carry out the designated task – or shirk – evading the principal's wishes and carrying out actions that further the military's own interests. Shirking at its worst may be disobedience, but Feaver includes such things as [...] "foot-dragging" [...] and leaks to the press.|$|E

40|$|Explained and analyzed, in {{the context}} <b>of</b> the <b>civil-military</b> relationship, are {{the reasons why the}} American Revolution was not {{undermined}} by an American military tyranny. The early chapters are devoted to explaining the ideological and historical background of the American revolution with respect to American fears of power, anarchy, standing armies, and military despotism; the American 2 ̆ 7 s faith in their militia; and their insistence on civil supremacy being the guiding principle <b>of</b> the <b>civil-military</b> relationship. Also detailed is how the Continental Army was created, structured, and maintained so as to minimize the possibility of it subverting the civilian governments. Additionally addressed in the early chapters are the personal and political dynamics <b>of</b> the <b>civil-military</b> relationship. How the Continental Congress and state governments controlled and directed their military forces, as well as how the military controlled themselves, is detailed in the middle chapters. Also included in these chapters is an analysis of the military 2 ̆ 7 s often critical opinion of the civilian governments and the American people; explanations for those instances when the military threatened and violated the lives, liberties, and properties of their fellow citizens; and a discussion of the military 2 ̆ 7 s frequent involvement in and interference with the civilian governments and the political process. The last chapters are devoted to an analysis <b>of</b> the <b>civil-military</b> relationship during the last four years of the Revolutionary War, when it was most severely tested, and when the American Revolution was most susceptible to being undermined by a domestic military tyranny. Special attention is given in these chapters to the factors which prevented the Continental Army from subverting the civilian governments, particularly during the last year of the war.
