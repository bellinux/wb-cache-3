5|$|Bradman {{thought his}} faster bowlers could not extract much bounce {{from the surface}} and soon removed the short leg fielder, and pursued a 63 <b>off-side</b> field with three slips and a deep point, trying to {{encourage}} the English openers {{to cut through the}} vacant area between the slips and extra cover. However, they declined Bradman's incentive and decided to bat in a low-risk manner, favouring straight-batted shots. After 80 minutes of batting, England's openers reached 50, the first time they had put on a half-century in the series. Hutton and Washbrook appeared set for the long haul, and did not react to the applause. They continued on cautiously, and persisted in eschewing the cross-batted cut and pull shots and relying on the safe accumulation of singles.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of {{the origins}} of the position, Ellison was {{instrumental}} in promoting its adoption throughout New Zealand. Although it is unclear whether the wing-forward was used during the 1893 tour of Australia, {{by the time of the}} All Blacks' first Test match, played during their 1903 Australian tour, the position was engrained within the New Zealand style of play. The use of a wing-forward provoked controversy both in New Zealand, and later in the British Isles after the All Blacks toured there in 1905; wing-forwards were often accused of <b>off-side</b> obstruction of the opposition half-back. According to Ellison however, if the position was implemented properly, then there would be no cause for complaint. The wing-forward continued as a vital component of New Zealand rugby until long-standing complaints from the unions of the Home Nations resulted in the position being outlawed by the International Rugby Football Board in 1932.|$|E

25|$|In 1980, Olsen {{moved to}} 16-time Belgian champions R.S.C. Anderlecht, to play {{alongside}} Danish internationals Benny Nielsen and Kenneth Brylle. At Anderlecht, Olsen {{won his first}} trophy of his senior career. In {{his first year at}} Anderlecht, the club won the 1979–80 Belgian First Division, conceding only 24 goals in 34 games. Olsen played six years at Anderlecht, winning three Belgian championships with the club, and he was eventually named Anderlecht team captain. During most of 1982, Olsen suffered from a severe shin injury, which prompted Anderlecht manager Tomislav Ivic to move him back from the midfield into the libero position. As the libero at Anderlecht, Olsen controlled an aggressive form of <b>off-side</b> trap, which had 3–4 players converge towards the ball-possessing player as the <b>off-side</b> trap was sprung, in order to prevent the ball-possessing player from countering the <b>off-side</b> by dribbling on his own.|$|E
25|$|He {{was known}} as the Pocket Hercules, because {{although}} short he could hit powerfully. He was particularly strong on the <b>off-side,</b> and appeared to {{have plenty of time to}} play his shots.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} Owen's {{tactical}} mind {{was seen in}} one of his early international matches against England in 1902. Wales were behind in the game with little time remaining when Owen tricked his opposite number, Bernard Oughtred, into an <b>off-side</b> tackle near the English posts. With the Welsh in charge of the scrum on the English '25', Owen told his forwards, in Welsh, to keep hold of the ball, while Owen bent down and pretended to collect it. Oughtred came around the scrum to tackle Owen and finding the Welshman empty handed was penalised for being <b>off-side.</b> John Strand-Jones kicked the penalty, allowing Wales to win 9-8.|$|E
5000|$|Suffridge {{was noted}} for his quickness.

25|$|Leg before wicket {{decisions}} are notoriously difficult to judge {{and only the}} umpire is in the correct position to judge {{the line of the}} ball and its height when its hits the batsmen. The lbw laws of the time meant that a batsman could not be lbw to a ball that pitched outside the off-stump unless he was also outside the off-stump. Though this was meant to encourage <b>off-side</b> strokeplay and prevent batsmen from padding away balls it resulted in batsmen padding-up to <b>off-side</b> balls while in front of the wicket and encouraged inswing bowlers such as Alec Bedser who normally hit the batsmen in front of the leg-stump.|$|E
25|$|Whether on {{the front}} or back foot, he plays well on the on- and <b>off-side.</b> He’s not Brian Lara or Ricky Ponting in terms of {{aggression}} or flair but he is rock solid and, added to that, has every shot in the book.|$|E
25|$|With {{the advent}} of {{full-time}} professionals in the early 1990s, and the consequent speeding up of the game, the five metre <b>off-side</b> distance between the two teams became 10metres, and the replacement rule was superseded by various interchange rules, among other changes.|$|E
50|$|There are no fouls or <b>off-sides.</b> In {{the case}} of a draw penalty kicks are shot which decide who the winner is. Before the {{beginning}} of the 2nd half of each game there is a short cheerleaders show. At {{the end of the show}} their leader gives a message to the player.|$|R
500|$|Technical fouls include holding, interference, pushing, illegal {{offensive}} screening (usually {{referred to}} as a [...] "moving pick"), [...] "warding off", stalling, and <b>off-sides.</b> A screen, as employed in basketball strategy, is a blocking move by an offensive player, by standing beside or behind a defender, to free a teammate to shoot, or receive a pass; as in basketball players must remain stationary when screening. Warding off occurs when an offensive player uses his free hand to control the stick of an opposing player.|$|R
500|$|Illinois got {{the ball}} to start the game, and on their opening drive, Scheelhaase threw an interception, setting up Penn State at their own 16, from which they ran a 7-play, 84-yard drive {{highlighted}} by a 47-yard pass to Allen Robinson, and culminating with Bill Belton rushing for a 1-yard touchdown. Penn State scored on their second drive as well, a lengthy 17-play drive that encapsulated 7:15, and resulted in Christian Hackenberg running for a 9-yard touchdown {{early in the second}} quarter to take a 14–0 lead. After another Illinois punt, Penn State again drove down the field, but Sam Ficken missed a 37-yard field goal, his first miss on a kick inside of 40 yards on the season. On the final drive of the first half, Illinois finally achieved points, with kicker Taylor Zalewski making a 21-yard field goal as time expired. After Penn State's first second-half drive faltered, Illinois took the field, and embarked on a 13-play, 88-yard drive, ended by an 8-yard touchdown run from Josh Ferguson. At {{the end of the third}} quarter, Penn State led 14–10. In the fourth quarter, the two teams each failed to score on their first drive, but on Illinois' second, Scheelhaase connected with Ferguson on a 7-yard pass to finish off a 13-play, 77-yard drive and take the lead for the first time in the game. Penn State's ensuing drive had promise, but ultimately ended when Belton lost a fumble at the two-yard line. Illinois failed to capitalize, however, and went three-and-out. Taking the field in Illinois territory, Penn State drove into field goal range, at which point Ficken made a 37-yard field goal to tie the game at 17 with 0:41 remaining. Illinois {{got the ball}} back, but after a false start penalty on them and a subsequent <b>off-sides</b> penalty on Penn State, they called timeout, and ran one additional play, on which Penn State recorded their first sack of the game. Time expired. In overtime, Penn State's second overtime game in their past three, they got the ball to start, and were faced with a third-down situation needing 11 yards to convert at the 15-yard line. Coming out of a timeout following a holding penalty that brought back a touchdown, Kyle Carter made his first and only reception of the day, a 15-yard touchdown pass thrown into a tight window by Hackenberg on one of Penn State's [...] "favorite" [...] plays known simply as [...] "pearl". Illinois did not achieve a touchdown on their subsequent drive, as Ryan Keiser intercepted a pass on its first play, ending the game with Penn State emerging victorious, 24–17.|$|R
25|$|He {{looked the}} {{embodiment}} of India's famous opener, Gavaskar, and indeed was {{wearing a pair of}} his pads. While he displayed a full repertoire of strokes in compiling his maiden Test hundred, most remarkable were his <b>off-side</b> shots from the back foot. Though only 5ft 5in tall, he was still able to control without difficulty short deliveries from the English pacemen.|$|E
25|$|Murdoch {{was more}} of an <b>off-side</b> player whose drives and cut strokes were {{regarded}} as among the best of his day; but his leg-side play was reputedly not so strong, and his ability against good spin bowling was not as impressive as it might be. Also, he was believed to be lacking in command against top-class pace bowling on difficult wickets; if conditions, were perfect, however, his batting often followed suit.|$|E
25|$|A fielder in the {{equivalent}} {{position on the}} on side of the wicket-keeper {{is known as a}} leg slip; this is considerably less common than the <b>off-side</b> slip, and for a team to employ more than one leg slip is highly unusual. It is illegal, under Law 41.5, to have more than two fielders in the area between square leg and long stop, to prevent the fielding team from making use of bodyline tactics.|$|E
25|$|While at Anderlecht, Olsen {{became the}} seventh Dane to play 50 {{games for the}} {{national}} team, in June 1981. For Olsen's 53rd national team game in April 1983, the German national team manager of Denmark, Sepp Piontek, named Olsen permanent national team captain, as Olsen replaced the retiring Per Røntved as both libero and team captain. Olsen played as an attacking libero, and had defensive midfielder Jens Jørn Bertelsen cover {{for him when he}} was on the attack. Olsen, alongside defender Søren Busk, persuaded Piontek to implement the aggressive <b>off-side</b> trap they practiced at Anderlecht.|$|E
25|$|He was {{considered}} by some observers to have trouble against quality spin, especially against Indian off spinner Harbhajan Singh, who dismissed Ponting on 13 occasions in international cricket. Ponting {{had a tendency to}} rock onto the front foot and thrust his wrists at spinning deliveries, resulting in many catches close to the wicket. Ponting rarely employed the sweep shot against spin, something considered unusual for a top-order batsman. Instead, he looked to use his feet to come down the wicket to spinners, or play off the back foot through the <b>off-side.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{family was}} also very {{involved}} in cricket and his main sporting fame was as a cricket player and administrator. On the field he was a free-hitting batsman, strong on the <b>off-side,</b> fielded well at long-leg or cover-point, and bowled fast round-arm. Starting at school, in away matches he made 120 not out for Clifton against Sherborne in 1874 and a faultless 164 against Cheltenham in 1875.He also played for Gloucestershire, making his debut in 1875, just after leaving school. Going up to Oxford, {{he played in the}} University XI for four seasons from 1876 to 1889, with a best score of 71 against Middlesex.|$|E
25|$|After {{the end of}} the round, Palmeiras signed former Chilean idol, Jorge Valdivia, for 5 {{years from}} the Arabian side Al Ain. The signing of Valdivia left the club and {{especially}} the fans really glad. In the beginning of the 12th round, Palmeiras faced old rivals Corinthians, in the so-called Paulista Derby, and drew at home by 1–1. Although the bad result, Palmeiras attacked Corinthians almost every time in the match. Jorge Henrique scored for Corinthians at the 11th minute and Edinho equalized for Palmeiras at the 33rd minute, after that, Palmeiras scored three times, with Ewerthon twice and with Lincoln, but the referee pointed <b>off-side</b> in all of them.|$|E
25|$|John Shuter (9 February 1855 Thornton Heath, Surrey, England – 5 July 1920, Blackheath, Kent, England) was a cricketer {{who played}} for England and Surrey in the late 19th century. He is best remembered for captaining Surrey to a string of wins in the County Championship around the time it became {{official}} in 1890, aided by the bowler George Lohmann and back up by John Sharpe and William Lockwood. Shuter first led Surrey to the County Championship in 1887. They then came first in 1888, tied with Lancashire and Nottinghamshire in 1889, and won again in 1890, 1891 and 1892. Shuter was a batsman and chiefly an <b>off-side</b> player.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{putting in}} an {{impressive}} display, Bohemians who were again reduced to 10 {{men on the}} 43rd minute were beaten 3–1 in Tolka Park in the first leg, and suffered from some careless defensive lapses and a controversial red card. In Germany, Bohemians shocked the hosts by winning 1–0 thanks to a goal from Glen Crowe, and were unlucky not to score more (even having a goal ruled out for <b>off-side).</b> Bohemians were out of Europe, and had made history by achieving successive away victories in European competition. It was {{at this time in}} his career that Collins is rumoured to have applied for a job with Dublin Corporation as a traffic warden to escape the hectic lifestyle of football.|$|E
25|$|The {{second day}} saw 87 overs of play before bad light ended the day's play. Warwickshire put on 347 for 5 declared. Nick Knight's 115 {{was the first}} century of the season. Wagh contributed 66 and Trott 75. The third day started with a {{confident}} and chanceless first wicket partnership of 109 between Alastair Cook and Matt Prior. Then Cook, who grafted out his innings with careful footwork and plenty of <b>off-side</b> shots, and Owais Shah, who {{got off to a}} difficult start, put on 166 runs for the second wicket, before Cook fell for 120. The MCC declared soon after at 275 for 2, 70 runs behind. Warwickshire started their second innings confidently, and were 70 for 3 at close on the third day.|$|E
25|$|With {{the return}} of the Test players the {{following}} summer, Chappell held his place in the South Australian side and was promoted to the number four position, following brother Ian at number three. The highlight of Chappell's season was a brilliant 154 against Western Australia, but his continuing preference for leg side shots was seen as a weakness if he wanted to make Test cricket. During a brief dressing room encounter with the great Don Bradman, then a state and national selector, Chappell was advised to change his grip on the bat in order to improve his <b>off-side</b> play. Without hesitation, Chappell made the recommended change and at season's end, wrote to the English county team Somerset, asking for a contract to play county cricket to further his development.|$|E
25|$|Sangakkara is a left-handed top order batsman {{who likes}} {{to hit the ball}} square of the wicket on the <b>off-side.</b> While the cut and the pull are natural strokes for him, he tends to play off the front foot. The cover drive is one of his regular scoring shots. Sangakkara {{averaged}} 57.40 in Test cricket. In ODI cricket, he retired with an average of 42. Sangakkara handed his wicket-keeping duties in Test cricket to Prasanna Jayawardene in 2006. He played as a specialist batsman in Tests, and retired as a wicket keeper-batsman in other formats of the game. He is the first on the list of wicket keepers who contributed to the most number of dismissals in ODI cricket, With 499. He is also the wicket keeper with the highest number of stumpings—99—in ODI cricket.|$|E
25|$|Brett Lee had {{dominated}} {{the clash between}} himself and Sehwag for some brief moments when he hit Sehwag on the helmet twice, with just-short of a length deliveries each time. Sehwag also enjoyed a slice of luck, when a comedy of errors by the Australian fielders resulted in a run-out chance being put down. Sehwag had just struck a ball off Lee on the <b>off-side,</b> and had run a single, and had made his mind {{to go for the}} second, but a moment's hesitation, left {{him in the middle of}} the pitch and when the fielder threw the ball to Lee, the bowler, Sehwag was a few yards away from the crease. Unmindful of this, Lee threw the ball to the batting end, where Chopra was struggling to get to. The wicketkeeper, however, dropped the ball, only for Chopra to make it back to the crease in time.|$|E
25|$|Kapil Dev was a fast bowler. However, a fluent run-up and a {{gather that}} was {{perfectly}} side-on {{at the time}} of delivery meant that the outswinger came naturally to him. Usually bowled at a length and direction that always troubled the right-hander, this beautifully bowled delivery was the source of most of Kapil Dev's victims as he sought to beat the bat on the outside edge, either caught on the <b>off-side</b> cordon or indeed LBW and bowled in case the ball missed the edge. The side-on action meant that, for the first few years, this was the only delivery he could bowl. The deliveries that held their lines or came into the right-hander came through natural variations off the pitch. However, as he gained maturity and indeed his litheness receded, the action became less side-on and he developed an inswinger too. A highly skillful bowler, he noted in the mid-1980s that the only delivery he could not bowl at will was the leg-cutter.|$|E
25|$|Sehwag's {{technique}} {{is often cited}} as being particularly unorthodox, often backing away (considered technically incorrect) to free his arms whilst playing his shots, in particular,a to cut or drive spinners inside out. He is frequently cited by commentators for his extremely strong (physically) square cutting and upper cutting and power through the <b>off-side.</b> He is also an excellent player of the late cut. In particular, his tendency to strike {{the ball in the}} air and risk dismissal is a trait which has seen him noted for his chancy and adventurous mindset. He is also noted for a relative lack of footwork, with his timing often attributed to his eyesight. Of late, Sehwag has shown a proclivity to be dismissed by inswing deliveries, something attributed to his leaden-footed batting style. He has also got dismissed playing the cut shot when the ball was too close to his body to cut, especially in limited over matches.|$|E
25|$|The {{political}} fallout resulting from Bodyline ensured that Voce, despite taking eight wickets against the Australians in 1934, was not chosen {{for any of}} the Tests, and before the 1935 season started, Voce asked MCC not to choose him. However, in county cricket, Voce was as good a bowler as ever, and may have taken over 150 wickets in both 1935 and 1936, but for faulty catching in the slips. He declared himself available again during the latter year, and became party to the 1936/1937 tour under Gubby Allen. Bowling this time to an <b>off-side</b> field, Voce, after a disappointing beginning, bowled superbly in the first Test at the Gabba with six for 41 on a perfect pitch, and crushed Australia with four for sixteen, after rain, on the fifth day. England won by 322 runs, and Voce again utilised a rain-affected pitch in the second Test with match figures of seven for 76, including three wickets in four balls. After taking seventeen wickets in the inaugural two Tests, Voce did not keep up his form in the last three due to a back problem. He still finished with 26 wickets to be the leading bowler for the series.|$|E
25|$|Foster {{was educated}} at Malvern College and University College, Oxford. He first played for Oxford University Cricket Club in 1897; in {{addition}} to cricket, he also represented Oxford at football, racquets and golf. However, although he did fairly well, {{it was not until}} 1899 that his beautiful and immaculate driving to the <b>off-side</b> made him into one of the finest batsmen of his time. He had played for Worcestershire while they were still a minor county but in 1899, their inaugural season as a first-class county, he and his brother Wilfrid Foster both scored two hundreds in a match (against Hampshire), a feat which remains unique in county cricket. In 1900, as captain of Oxford, he scored 171 to set the record for the highest individual score in the Varsity Match, and he scored 102 not out and 136 for the Gentlemen against the Players at Lord's, the first man to score two centuries in a match in the Gentleman v Players series. In total, Foster scored 930 runs at an average of 77.5 for Oxford in the 1900 season, a record in University cricket.|$|E
25|$|Ricky Ponting, {{the next}} man in, {{had a great}} start to his innings, {{creaming}} a boundary off only the second ball he faced. When Ponting had added just six to his tally, Virender Sehwag dropped a chance at third slip off Pathan, and when he reached 12, a close lbw decision against him off Ajit Agarkar's bowling was turned down. Overcoming these hiccups, Ponting strove on further with his innings, reaching his fifty off 64 balls, with a four off Ashish Nehra's bowling, in the 23rd over of Australia's innings. One over later, Langer joined the party, too, amassing 20 runs off Anil Kumble's sixth over with two boundaries and two sixes apiece. However, Kumble {{was to have the}} last laugh, as he trapped Langer, who nevertheless, made a dominating and attacking 58 from a mere 72 deliveries in the fifth ball of the 26th over, when Australia were cruising along at a run-rate of above five per over. The dismissal occurred shortly before lunch, providing the Indians with a vital breakthrough, but the relief was a short one, as Langer was replaced by Martyn, who proved to be a thorn in the Indian team's flesh. Martyn seemed to be in a graceful touch from his first ball, stroking some good shots to the fence against the pace duo of Agarkar and Pathan, the latter being unable to replicate his good start with the new ball. Just when he seemed set for a big score, Martyn threw away his wicket when he chased a wide ball from Nehra to VVS Laxman. Steve Waugh the next batsman also played a few through the <b>off-side</b> for his 30 before he was bowled by a clever piece of bowling from Nehra. Simon Katich came in at the fall of the fourth wicket at 252, and then he proceeded to add 138 runs for the fifth wicket with Ponting. Katich started slowly, but gained momentum and proceeded to pepper shots all over the wicket once he settled down, the most memorable shot being a six of Nehra. The partnership ended in the 88th over of the Australian over of the day, when he top-edged a pull from Agarkar, only to be caught by a spectacular catch by Sehwag, who came in diving full-length and held on to the cherry with both hands.|$|E
