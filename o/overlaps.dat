In {{the study}} of the <b>overlapping</b> {{mechanism}} in selective laser melting (SLM) process based on interlayer-staggered scan strategy, relationship between the intra-layer <b>overlapping</b> rate and the inter-layer <b>overlapping</b> rate was obtained by theoretical deduction based on the continuity of layers; the <b>overlapping</b> mechanism and the depositing efficiency were later analyzed. Results showed that three types of <b>overlapping</b> mechanism exist under different values of <b>overlapping</b> rate: the intra-layer <b>overlapping</b> mechanism, the inter-layer <b>overlapping</b> mechanism and the mixed <b>overlapping</b> mechanism with coexistence of the first two types; the maximal depositing efficiency of intra-layer <b>overlapping</b> mechanism and inter-layer <b>overlapping</b> mechanism is 0. 38 and 0. 5 respectively. This study has provided basic theory for improving depositing efficiency in SLM process...|$|R

40|$|An {{analysis}} of cloud <b>overlap</b> based on high temporal and vertical resolution retrievals of cloud condensate from {{a suite of}} ground instruments is performed at a mid-latitude atmospheric observation facility. Two facets of <b>overlap</b> are investigated: cloud fraction <b>overlap,</b> {{expressed in terms of}} a parameter " α " indicating the relative contributions of maximum and random <b>overlap,</b> and <b>overlap</b> of horizontal distributions of condensate, expressed in terms of the correlation coefficient of condensate ranks. The degree of proximity to the random and maximum <b>overlap</b> assumptions is also expressed in terms of a decorrelation length, a convenient scalar parameter for <b>overlap</b> parameters assumed to decay exponentially with separation distance. Both cloud fraction <b>overlap</b> and condensate <b>overlap</b> show significant seasonal variations with a clear tendency for more maximum <b>overlap</b> in the summer months. More maximum <b>overlap</b> is also generally observed when the domain size used to define cloud fractions increases. These tendencies also exist for rank correlations, but are significantly weaker. Hitherto unexplored <b>overlap</b> parameter dependencies are investigated by analyzing mean parameter differences at fixed separation distance within different layers of the atmospheric column, and by searching for possible systematic relationships between alpha and rank correlation. We find that for the same separation distance the <b>overlap</b> parameters are significantly distinct in different atmospheric layers, and that random cloud fraction <b>overlap</b> is usually associated with more randomly <b>overlapped</b> condensate ranks...|$|R

Compared to terrestrial carnivores, relatively {{little is known about}} the factors influencing conspecific spatial <b>overlap</b> in snakes, although across snake taxa there appears to be substantial variation in conspecific spatial <b>overlap.</b> In this study, we described conspecific spatial <b>overlap</b> of eastern indigo snakes (Drymarchon couperi) in peninsular Florida and examined how conspecific spatial <b>overlap</b> varied by sex and season (breeding season vs. non-breeding season). We calculated multiple indices of spatial <b>overlap</b> using 6 - and 3 -month utilization distributions (UD) of dyads of simultaneously adjacent telemetered snakes. We also measured conspecific UD density values at each telemetry fix and modeled the distribution of those values as a function of <b>overlap</b> type, sex, and season using generalized Pareto distributions. Home range <b>overlap</b> between males and females was significantly greater than <b>overlap</b> between individuals of the same sex and male home ranges often completely contained female home ranges. Male home ranges <b>overlapped</b> little during both seasons, whereas females had higher levels of <b>overlap</b> during the non-breeding season. The spatial patterns observed in our study are consistent with those seen in many mammalian carnivores, in which low male-male <b>overlap</b> and high inter-sexual <b>overlap</b> provides males with greater access to females. We encourage additional research on the influence of prey availability on conspecific spatial <b>overlap</b> in snakes as well as the behavioral mechanisms responsible for maintaining the low levels of <b>overlap</b> we observed...|$|R
