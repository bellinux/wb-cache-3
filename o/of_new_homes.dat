5|$|In the 1930s and 1950s however massive {{programmes}} of state-sponsored {{house building}} saw thousands <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>homes</b> built in Coatbridge {{and some of}} the worst examples of slum housing were cleared away. By the early 1980s 85% of homes in Coatbridge were part of local authority housing stock.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Savings and Loan {{crisis of}} the 1980s and early 1990s was the failure of 747 savings and loan {{associations}} (S) in the United States. The ultimate cost of the crisis is estimated to have totaled around $160.1 billion, about $124.6 billion of which was directly {{paid for by the}} U.S. federal government. The accompanying slowdown in the finance industry and the real estate market may have been a contributing cause of the 1990-1991 economic recession. Between 1986 and 1991, the number <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>homes</b> constructed per year dropped from 1.8 million to 1 million, at the time the lowest rate since World War II.|$|E
5|$|A {{major upgrade}} is being planned by Transport for London to bring {{improvements}} to the station; these include a new Northern line ticket hall, three new escalators and additional lifts to provide step-free access to the Northern line platforms. This will be done {{in conjunction with the}} major transformation in the Elephant & Castle area to create thousands <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>homes</b> and potential for new retail development to provide growth in the area. This is also in line with a further consultation on its worksite for the Bakerloo line due to the highly constrained space surrounding the platforms of the line. New tunnels could be dug alongside with new platforms to accommodate the increase in demand if the Bakerloo line extension comes into service.|$|E

5|$|After Leonid Brezhnev assumed {{power in}} 1964, much of Khrushchev's reforms were reversed. The Brezhnev era began {{a new state}} of stagnation, and saw a decline in both the quality and {{quantity}} of products in the Soviet Union. Armenia was severely affected by these policies, as was to be demonstrated several years later in the catastrophic earthquake that hit Spitak. Material allocated to the building <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>homes,</b> such as cement and concrete, was diverted for other uses. Bribery and a lack of oversight saw the construction of shoddily built and weakly supported apartment buildings. When the earthquake hit on the morning of December 7, 1988, the houses and apartments least able to resist collapse were those built during the Brezhnev years. Ironically, the older the dwellings, the better they withstood the quake.|$|E

50|$|The {{agricultural}} community <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>Home</b> was originally {{part of the}} Deuce of Hearts Ranch. A portion of the ranch was platted and opened for settlement in the 1890s. The community was initially called Deuce of Hearts but the name was later changed to <b>New</b> <b>Home.</b> Farming began in the area between 1905 and 1910, and an identifiable community had formed there by the 1930s. The economy <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>Home</b> has always been closely linked to cotton production and ginning. In 1985, the <b>New</b> <b>Home</b> Co-op Gin processed 12,000 bales of cotton.|$|R
50|$|The {{purchase}} {{of an existing}} home is exempt from the HST, while the purchase <b>of</b> a <b>new</b> <b>home</b> was subject to a GST rebate of 36% if the purchase price was below $350,000, up to a maximum rebate of $8,750 (which made the tax rate effectively 3.2%). Under the PST, the purchase <b>of</b> a <b>new</b> <b>home</b> was tax exempt. Under the BC HST, up to $200,000 of the provincial part of the HST could be refunded (making the purchase <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>home</b> under $400,000 virtually tax free).|$|R

25|$|There {{are also}} {{concerns}} about enforcement, with a Building Research Establishment study in 2004 indicating that 60% <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>homes</b> do {{not conform to}} existing regulations. A 2006 survey for the Energy Saving Trust revealed that Building Control Officers considered energy efficiency 'a low priority' and that few would take any action over failure to comply with the Building Regulations because the matter 'seemed trivial'.|$|E

25|$|Southwest Boise {{contains}} {{sparsely populated}} neighborhoods built from the 1960s {{to the early}} 1980s. Many include acre-sized plots and the occasional farmhouse and pasture. In the 1980s, growth in the area was stunted to prevent urban sprawl. Since this has been lifted, there has been widespread growth <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>homes</b> and neighborhoods. The area lies near Interstate 84, theaters, shopping, the airport, golf and the Boise Bench area.|$|E

25|$|A study {{commissioned}} by the Curtin University of Technology, Perth in 2000 argued that {{the introduction of the}} GST would negatively impact the real estate market as it would add up to 8 percent to the cost <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>homes</b> and reduce demand by about 12 percent. The real estate market returned to boom between 2002 and 2004 where property prices and demand increased dramatically, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne.

25|$|In 2004, the {{trustees}} acquired Mountaintop Farm (also {{known locally as}} Patterson's or Brown's Mountain), the only property that overlooks Monticello. Jefferson had called the taller mountain Montalto. To prevent development <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>homes</b> on the site, {{the trustees}} spent $15 million to purchase the property. Jefferson had owned {{it as part of}} his plantation, but it was sold off after his death. In the 20th-century, its farmhouses were divided into apartments for many University of Virginia students. The officials at Monticello had long considered the property an eyesore, and planned to acquire it when it became available.|$|E
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{the first}} decade after 2000, a housing crisis began in Auckland with the market not being able to sustain the demand for {{affordable}} homes. The Housing Accords and Special Housing Areas Act 2013 mandated that a minimum of 10 per cent of new builds in certain housing areas be subsidized to make them affordable for buyers who had incomes on par with the national average. In a new subdivision at Hobsonville Point, 20 per cent <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>homes</b> were reduced to below $550,000. Some of the demand for new housing at this time was attributed to the 43,000 people who moved into Auckland between June 2014 and June 2015.|$|E
25|$|In the Watton Green {{area of the}} estate, eleven {{houses were}} {{completed}} in February 2001 {{with a focus on}} low-energy features. Designed by PCKO Architects and built by Focus Housing Group, they broke the trend <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>homes</b> constructed entirely of brick on the estate. The shells of these buildings were constructed quickly with insulated wall panels and roof pieces, manufactured using recycled newspaper and containing no foam or resin. The internal walls are not load-bearing, allowing changes to the plans of the buildings in the future. The buildings are clad in cedar cladding and Tresca panels. For water conservation, low flush toilets, aerated taps and water butts were installed. Altogether, the scheme cost £958,000, with an average unit cost of £87,000.|$|E
