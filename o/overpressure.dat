Bursting discs are not required in all jurisdictions.|$|E
5|$|As part of {{president}} Ronald Reagan's and Navy Secretary John Lehman's {{effort to create}} a 600-ship Navy, New Jersey was selected for reactivation in the spring of 1981, and she was towed from Puget Sound Naval Shipyard to Long Beach Naval Shipyard at the end of July 1981 for modernization/reactivation. At the time of the reactivation the Navy envisioned using New Jersey and her sister ship Iowa to meet sustained global requirements and relieve the strain on the Navy created by an increase in U.S. commitments to the Indian Ocean and Caribbean Sea regions. During this time the Navy developed several proposals to update their battleships to carry cruise missiles and anti-ship missiles, as well as point defense system mounts. Preliminary modernizations schemes included the removal of four of the ten 5inch gun mounts on New Jersey {{to make room for the}} armored box launchers that would be required to carry and launch the BGM-109 Tomahawk missiles. At one point the NATO Sea Sparrow was to be installed on the reactivated battleships; however, it was determined that the system could not withstand the <b>overpressure</b> effects when firing the main battery.|$|E

Accurate pore-pressure {{prediction}} {{is critical in}} hydrocarbon exploration and is especially important in the rapidly deposited Tertiary Baram Delta province where all economic fields exhibit <b>overpressures,</b> commonly of high magnitude and with narrow transition zones. A pore-pressure database was compiled using wireline formation interval tests, drillstem tests, and mud weights from 157 wells in 61 fields throughout Brunei. <b>Overpressures</b> are observed in 54 fields both in the inner-shelf deltaic sequences and in the underlying prodelta shales. Porosity vs. vertical effective stress plots from 31 fields reveal that <b>overpressures</b> are primarily generated by disequilibrium compaction in the prodelta shales but have been generated by fluid expansion in the inner-shelf deltaic sequences. However, the geology of Brunei precludes <b>overpressures</b> in the inner-shelf deltaics being generated by any conventional fluid expansion mechanism (e. g., kerogen-to-gas maturation), and we propose that these <b>overpressures</b> have been vertically transferred into reservoir units, via faults, from the prodelta shales.

40|$|The ‘window’ of safe mud weights between pore {{pressure}} and fracture pressure is narrower in <b>overpressured</b> sediments than in normally pressured sediments. This ‘window’ also controls the maximum buoyancy pressure, {{and hence the}} maximum height of hydrocarbon columns.

5|$|The HL234, {{an engine}} born from the {{developments}} initiated {{by attempting to}} convert the Maybach HL230 to fuel injection, would have increased the power to about 800 to 900 PS (hp). The Entwicklungskommission Panzer unanimously decided that HL234 be immediately included in the engine design and procurement program. The AK-7-200 was also explored {{as an alternative to}} the Maybach Olvar-B drive train, but Waffenamt research and development department Wa Prüf 6 found that it offered inferior driving characteristics and so the Maybach Olvar-B was retained. There are also a program using the Simmering- Graz-Pauker Sla.16 engine, but the war's constraint on supplies and capitulation resulted in the cancellation of this program. Krupp proposed mounting a new main weapon, the 10.5cm KwK L/68. Wa Prüf 6 was not supportive of this as the Heer had not accepted the cannon itself. Other suggested improvements included stabilised sights, a stabilised main gun, an automatic ammunition feed, a Zeiss stereoscopic range finder, heated crew compartment, stowage for an additional 12 rounds, and an <b>overpressure</b> & air filtration system to protect against poison gas. However, these also never got beyond the proposal stage or did not enter production before the war ended.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The South Adriatic {{foreland}} basin in Albania contains up to 7 km of Neogene molasse strata aVected by gentle NNW-trending monoclines and anticlines. Gas-prone terrigenous-derived {{organic matter}} occurs in low amounts (< 0. 4 % TOC) throughout the Neogene sequence. <b>Overpressures</b> aVect the strata up to Upper Miocene (Messinian) level, creating anomalous values of density and resistivity in mudstones and of porosity and sonic travel time. The <b>overpressures</b> are principally {{due to the}} high Neogene sedimentation rates. Further gas discoveries are expected, onshore and oVshore, in both normally pressured and <b>overpressured</b> Neogene reservoirs...|$|R
50|$|It is {{extremely}} important {{to be able to}} diagnose <b>overpressured</b> units when drilling through them, as the drilling mud weight (density) must be adjusted to compensate. If it is not, there is a risk that the pressure difference down-well will cause a dramatic decompression of the <b>overpressured</b> layer and result in a blowout at the well-head with possibly disastrous consequences. Because <b>overpressured</b> sediments tend to exhibit better porosity than would be predicted from their depth, they often make attractive hydrocarbon reservoirs and are therefore of important economic interest.|$|R
40|$|In {{drilling}} for oil, we occasionally encounter <b>overpressured</b> shale zones {{which can be}} disastrous to drilling. The <b>overpressured</b> zones usually exhibit lower electrical resistivity. Electromagnetic methods are therefore proposed to predict the location and intensity of the <b>overpressured</b> zones at tens of meters ahead of a drill-bit. The existing methods in petroleum well logging {{are sensitive to the}} formation volume up to 3 meters lateral to the borehole. To predict the formation ahead of drill-bit, it is essential to use a time-domain or a wide-band frequency domain approach. In a conductive medium, the high frequency fields are more confined to the volume around the source while the low frequency components reach larger volume of formation. In the time-domain situation, early time response is closely related to the formation property near the sensor while later time measurement is more sensitive to the property of the far away formation. It is found that the presence of an <b>overpressured</b> zone at 10 's of meters ahead of a drill-bit can be detected. Besides the prediction of <b>overpressured</b> zone, the method can also provide better geosteering to guide the drilling trajectory and to improve formation evaluation. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
