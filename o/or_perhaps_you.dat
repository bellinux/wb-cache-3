25|$|The report, {{compiled}} {{by researchers at}} the Los Alamos National Laboratory, shows that in the hands of hoaxers and conmen, red mercury can do almost anything the aspiring Third World demagogue wants it to. You want a short cut to making an atom bomb? You want the key to Soviet ballistic missile guidance systems? <b>Or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>you</b> want the Russian alternative to the anti-radar paint on the stealth bomber? What you need is red mercury.|$|E
2500|$|The couple {{continued}} to live separately after the civil marriage. In October 1956, Davidman was walking across her kitchen when she tripped over the telephone wire {{and fell to the}} floor, thereby breaking her left upper leg. At the Churchill Hospital, Oxford, she was diagnosed with incurable cancer, with bone metastases from breast carcinoma. It was at this time that Lewis recognized that he {{had fallen in love with}} her, realizing how despondent he would feel to lose her. He wrote to a friend: [...] "new beauty and new tragedy have entered my life. You would be surprised (<b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>you</b> would not?) to know how much of a strange sort of happiness and even gaiety there is between us." [...] Davidman underwent several operations and radiation treatment for the cancer. In March 1957, Warren Lewis wrote in his diary: [...] "One of the most painful days of my life. Sentence of death has been passed on Joy, and the end is only a matter of time." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I, too," [...] {{she said}} at last, [...] "have had some telegrams. I have been hesitating whether to show them to <b>you</b> <b>or</b> not. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>you</b> had better see them." ...|$|R
60|$|My dearest Mr. Boyd,--I wish I had a {{note from}} you to-day--which optative aorist I am not sure of being either {{grammatical}} <b>or</b> reasonable! <b>Perhaps</b> <b>you</b> have expected to hear from me with more reason....|$|R
60|$|Oh, my dear madam! {{you thought}} we were going to tell you. Pooh! nonsense!--no such thing! not for two or three and seventy pages <b>or</b> so,--when, <b>perhaps,</b> <b>you</b> MAY know what Mrs. Catherine never would have done.|$|R
6000|$|Cashel turned {{upon him}} curtly, and said, [...] "Don't you make so free with other people's names, <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>you</b> may {{get into trouble}} yourself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, what castles they were! And {{they seem}} further off than ever! <b>Or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>you</b> will fulfil them, {{and go and}} teach the Australian blacks!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is it not true? <b>Or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>you</b> do {{not find}} it strange that M. de La Tour d'Azyr should so conduct himself at such a time?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sir; I {{only thought}} {{you ought to}} be told. I leave it with you to mention it to others <b>or</b> not. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>you</b> will think it best to say nothing until the story gets about. Then you can say you are aware of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Craft {{might be}} a better word, since craft means {{knowledge}} as well as trickery. 'Impossible to man!' After what you saw a while ago in the temple of Amon, do you hold that there is anything impossible to man <b>or</b> woman? <b>Perhaps</b> <b>you</b> could do as much yourself." ...|$|R
5000|$|... 2. “Evidence of your {{reliance}} on the alleged conduct or omission, by reference to the steps you took or failed to take by reason of the alleged conduct <b>or</b> omission <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> how <b>you</b> would have acted differently, but for the alleged conduct or omission; and ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are ill, Duchesse!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "You {{will allow}} me to call the deck steward? <b>Or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>you</b> would prefer your own maid? I have some brandy in this flask." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then we'll have {{to remain}} here. <b>Or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>you</b> had better remain here while I go {{scouting}} around and see if I can find some of our soldiers, or the ambulance corps." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “With your aunt, <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>you</b> {{had just}} gone to school. I can’t fix the exact time,” Osborne {{answered}} unguardedly; and the girl {{was filled with a}} confused sense of love and gratitude.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then do {{not worry}} about THEM. I can easily explain. And if you would not mind letting her in, Mrs Gull can come in every other day or so just to keep things in order. She's entirely {{trustworthy}} and discreet. <b>Or</b> <b>perhaps,</b> if <b>you</b> would prefer--' ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{announce}} a man <b>or</b> woman coming, <b>perhaps</b> <b>you</b> are the one, (So long!) [...] I announce the great individual, fluid as Nature, chaste, [...] affectionate, compassionate, fully arm'd.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know if that}} {{is strange}} <b>or</b> not, but <b>perhaps</b> <b>you</b> had better read it. I expect it will clear the ground for me and I have {{something}} to say." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't like," [...] she {{retorted}} at once. [...] "It is not {{the time}} to be frivolous. What are you flinging your very heart against? <b>Or,</b> <b>perhaps,</b> <b>you</b> are only playing a part." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is finished," [...] he said, [...] "as {{everything}} finishes, and {{for once}} I am sorry. Now what next? Sleep, I suppose, in which all ends, <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>you</b> would say all begins." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I believe," [...] she said, looking with a {{smile at}} the pile of {{magazines}} and papers littered all over the seat, [...] "that you are an impostor. <b>Or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>you</b> have a peculiar taste in literature!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Beat {{her in the}} spirit. You will domineer over her, {{and desire}} to have your own way. When she is toiling for you, you will frown at her. Because you have {{business}} on hand, <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> pleasure, <b>you</b> will leave her in solitude. There may a time come when the diamonds shall have all gone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind, Davie. It is only deferred, and at {{any rate}} we can keep {{together}} till Midsummer. Then I can go out again for a year <b>or</b> two, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>you</b> will settle somewhere where the curate's sister could get a daily engagement." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why not try {{the fair}} young gentleman over there?' {{pointing}} to {{a copy of the}} Apollo which we call Belvedere--'What is his name? Old maids are always cross and jealous, you know. But he--he could not be cruel to such a sweet face as that. Try the fair young lad! <b>Or,</b> <b>perhaps,</b> if <b>you</b> are bashful, the old Jewess might try him for you?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why {{do you ask}} such a {{thing as}} that?" [...] she returned, in the same hard frost. [...] "You know where the idea of the {{character}} came from, and why it was sacred to me. <b>Or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>you</b> forget!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No. You must escort her home. She {{lives with}} Mrs. Cecil Forrester, in Lower Camberwell: {{so it is}} not very far. I will wait for you here if you will drive out again. <b>Or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>you</b> are too tired?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well!' said Mr. Gradgrind, {{breaking}} into a smile, after being for the moment at a loss, 'you are even more dispassionate than I expected, Louisa. <b>Or,</b> <b>perhaps,</b> <b>you</b> are not unprepared for the announcement I have it in charge to make?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There must be {{a mistake}} somewhere, <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> I {{misunderstand}} <b>you.</b> It is obvious that you, being a man, could not have destroyed the world. That could only {{be done by the}} Power which made it and you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I like that!" [...] cried Bob, angrily. [...] "Of {{course we}} opened it without his {{knowledge}} <b>or</b> consent, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>you</b> {{can tell us}} why {{it would have been}} necessary to consult him about it. What has he got to do with us?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Madame," [...] I broke out, [...] "you are a sensualist. Under {{all your}} serenity, your peace, and your decorum, {{you are an}} undenied sensualist. Make your own bed warm and soft; take {{sedatives}} and meats, and drinks spiced and sweet, {{as much as you}} will. If you have any sorrow <b>or</b> disappointment--and, <b>perhaps,</b> <b>you</b> have--nay, I know you have--seek your own palliatives, in your own chosen resources. Leave me, however. Leave me, I say!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For--well, to go {{away for}} a day or two," [...] said the visitor. [...] "I find you in bed; it may be a cold or a bilious attack; <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>you</b> had a little upset of the nerves when the trains kissed each other." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will show}} you the way, Mr. Hubbard, if you will kindly follow me. <b>Or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>you</b> had better go in front. I am afraid it is {{right at the top}} of the house. We will go up by the front staircase, as it is wider." ...|$|E
6000|$|Abdul Mourak laughed loudly. [...] "Pay for it?" [...] he cried. [...] "What with--the rags {{that you}} have upon your back? <b>Or,</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>you</b> are concealing beneath your coat a {{thousand}} pounds of ivory. Get out! You are a fool. Do not bother me again or I shall have you whipped." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well; yes, <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> forty-five. <b>You</b> {{were locked}} {{up at the}} time, poor fellow,--and had other things to think of; but all the {{interest}} we had for anything beyond you through May and June was devoted to Laurence and his prospects. It was off and on, and on and off, {{and he was in}} a most wretched condition. At last she wouldn't consent unless she was to be asked here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll {{need a new}} {{bowsprit}} and she's {{drawn the}} stay-bolt on the stem," [...] he said. [...] "I think that's all, but it will keep us here two <b>or</b> three days. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>you</b> had better {{see if you can}} wake Mrs. Evans before we land the girls." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{there is}} any {{misinterpretation}} here of what <b>you</b> said, <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> of what <b>you</b> meant to say, pray destroy what I have written without turning to the next page; and forgive me for having innocently startled you by a false alarm." ...|$|R
