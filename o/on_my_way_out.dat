50|$|There was {{probably}} a period when I was reading and trying to imitate Lovecraft, whilst equally exploring {{what was then a}} considerably ruined Merseyside landscape. Whole slews of ruined streets, which I was perfectly happy to wander through <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> to odd, <b>out</b> of the <b>way</b> cinemas. And because I saw the city all around me as this kind of gothic, almost supernatural landscape, I think a lot of that fed into my writing.|$|R
40|$|My own {{scientific}} {{career was}} a descent from higher to lower dimension, {{led by the}} desire to understand life. I went from animals to cells, from cells to bacteria, from bacteria to molecules, from molecules to electrons. The story had its irony, for molecules and electrons have no life at all. <b>On</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> life ran <b>out</b> between my fingers. ‚Äù-Albert Szent-Gyorgi, The Living State, Academic Press, 1972 As we work out intricate details regarding protein-protein interactions and discover how genes are regulated in specific cellular environments, are we tending towards {{a better understanding of the}} cell? Or are we merely stamp-collecting, mindlessly cataloguing useless details of cell function? Like Szent-Gyorgi in the quote above, most molecular biologists work according to a reductionist paradigm.

60|$|As I {{walked across}} the great hall <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> I {{came face to face}} with Lady Silchester, who was thoughtfully contemplating one of a long line of oil-paintings dark with age, yet vivid still with the marvellous {{colouring}} of an old master.

60|$|I {{examined}} the tickets carefully {{and placed them}} in my pocket-book. Then I paused to light a cigarette <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> of the office, and almost immediately felt a hand upon my arm. I looked at first at the hand.

6000|$|As I {{passed the}} back parlor door <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>out,</b> I {{heard the voice}} of Mrs. Baggs raised indignantly. The words [...] "bottle!" [...] "audacity!"

60|$|To my sinking {{heart and}} wearied mind, good Dame Nature {{presented}} a more acceptable prospect, when I happened {{to look out}} of the window of my room.
