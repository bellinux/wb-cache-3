5|$|From 21 February 1917, Bodrog and Körös were {{deployed}} as guardships at Brăila. On 1 March, Bodrog became stuck in ice at nearby Măcin. LSL Guido Taschler took command of Bodrog in 1918. That year's spring thaw saw Bodrog, Körös, Szamos, Bosna and several <b>other</b> <b>vessels</b> sent through {{the mouth of}} the Danube into the Black Sea as part of Flottenabteilung Wulff (Fleet Division Wulff) under the command of Flottenkapitän (Fleet Captain) Olav Wulff, arriving in Odessa on 12 April.

5|$|The ageing frigate {{was finally}} removed from Navy service later that year, and her crew {{discharged}} to <b>other</b> <b>vessels.</b> She was broken up at Deptford Dockyard in 1780, having secured {{a total of}} 31 victories over 21 years at sea.|$|E
5|$|The storm sank three {{merchant}} ships, and two <b>other</b> <b>vessels.</b> On one ship, the Sinaloa, 21 of 38 hands went down. On another, the El Caribe, {{all hands}} were lost. As many as 150 total boats were sunk.|$|E

5|$|A thermæ and caravanserai of {{the same}} period were also found, and {{is similar to the}} thermæ at Ashkelon and others in the nearby country. A row of rooms from an earlier, 1st century BCE to 1st century CE {{fortress}} revealed artefacts pointing to a Nabatæan occupation predating Roman annexation. Coins bearing the likeness of Nabatæan kings were found, along with storage jars and <b>other</b> <b>vessels.</b>|$|E
5|$|Early in June, Bridgeport made a round-trip {{voyage to}} Hampton Roads, Virginia, {{arriving}} back at New London on 23 June. She took on cargo and got underway on 28 June in {{a convoy of}} 18 subchasers and <b>other</b> <b>vessels,</b> bound for Europe by way of Bermuda and the Azores. Throughout the crossing, Bridgeport provided medical assistance and repair work as required.|$|E

5|$|The 4th Infantry Division did {{not meet}} all their D-Day {{objectives}} at Utah, partly because they had arrived {{too far to the}} south, but they landed 21,000 troops at the cost of only 197 casualties. Airborne troops arriving by parachute and glider numbered an additional 14,000 men, with 2,500 casualties. Around 700 men were lost in engineering units, 70th Tank Battalion, and LCTs and <b>other</b> <b>vessels</b> sunk by the enemy. German losses are unknown.|$|E

In the confusion that followed a number of the landing craft were damaged and forced to turn back, while others were reported as missing and believed sunk. As a result {{the decision was made to}} abandon the attack.|$|E
5|$|Before the Eighty Years' War began, people {{realized}} that the West Indies trade might bring great prosperity {{to the country and}} that more power might be developed against Spain. Rather than travel to the area singly on an armed ship or {{in the company of a}} few <b>other</b> <b>vessels,</b> traders could do business in the manner of the large and prosperous East India Company. A company for carrying on commerce in the West Indies and Africa could be organized, which might, like the sister company, act as the war-waging power in those parts and be supported by the treasury, ships, and troops of the United Netherlands.|$|E

5|$|Bonnet {{returned}} to Topsail Island {{to find that}} Blackbeard had beached {{the majority of their}} former crew, robbed the Revenge and two <b>other</b> <b>vessels</b> of the squadron of most of their supplies, and sailed away for parts unknown aboard the sloop Adventure, carrying all the loot with him. Bonnet now (probably late June or early July 1718) resumed command of the Revenge. Few, if any, of his original crew from Barbados were still aboard. Bonnet reinforced the Revenge by rescuing a number of men whom Blackbeard had marooned on a sandbar in Topsail Island.|$|E
5|$|Catastrophe {{struck the}} Old Bay Line on May 24, 1919, when the Virginia II caught fire shortly after midnight {{in the middle}} of Chesapeake Bay with 156passengers and a crew of 82on board. The ship burned {{completely}} as many passengers jumped overboard and a lifeboat capsized. The Chesapeake Line's City of Norfolk and <b>other</b> <b>vessels</b> came to the rescue and pulled people from the water to safety. The Virginia's captain, Walter Lane, remained with his ship to the end and suffered burns.|$|E
5|$|For the {{remaining}} {{week of the}} fighting in South Norway, Kommandøren was docked at Kvamsøya, immobilized by a damaged axle. As part of the ceasefire agreement accepted by the Norwegians in Western Norway in the evening of 1 May 1940, Kommandøren was {{to be handed over}} to the Germans, along with the ferry Lærdal and 40 smaller boats. The transfer of the ships occurred at Lærdal on 2 May, and the ceasefire was announced on 3 May. The Germans used Kommandøren and the <b>other</b> <b>vessels</b> for a limited period to transport troops to occupy various places in Western Norway.|$|E

5|$|He {{also studied}} <b>other</b> <b>vessels</b> from the period, {{such as the}} Le Soleil Royal, La Couronne, La Royale and Le Reale de France, to better {{understand}} 17th-century ship design. It was from the Le Reale de France that he gained a basis for his design of the Unicorn jolly boat. No ship named the Unicorn was listed {{in the annals of}} the French Navy, but Hergé instead took the name from a British frigate which had been active in the mid-18th century; the fictional ship's unicorn figurehead was also adopted from the frigate.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{assessments}} of Belfasts damage showed that, while the mine had done little direct {{damage to the}} outer hull, causing only a small hole directly below one of the boiler rooms, {{the shock of the}} explosion had caused severe warping, breaking machinery, deforming the decks and causing the keel to hog (bend upwards) by three inches. On 4 January 1940 Belfast was decommissioned to Care and Maintenance status, becoming the responsibility of Rosyth Dockyard, and her crew dispersed to <b>other</b> <b>vessels.</b> By 28 June she had been repaired sufficiently to sail to Devonport, arriving on 30 June under the command of Lt Cdr H W Parkinson.|$|E
5|$|Jiyuan then {{travelled}} back to Port Arthur, {{where the}} foreign engineer refused {{to serve the}} captain of the vessel any longer, and left. Captain Fang Peh-Kien was executed for his actions in the battle, with command passed to First Lieutenant Huang Tsu-Lien. Of the surviving Chinese warships from the battle, the Jiyuan was the least damaged. As the other surviving ships from the battle arrived in Port Arthur, their guns were dressed in red. Jiyuan was the exception, with no decoration and was docked away from the <b>other</b> <b>vessels.</b>|$|E
