5|$|Cave 12 {{is a small}} {{dwelling}} {{entered by}} a door from the veranda of cave 11. It has its own open veranda, which has a partly broken floor and ceiling and recessed benches {{on the left and}} right of the door to the middle room. The middle room has a small window to the left <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> a seat recess in its right wall. In the back wall of the middle room to the left is a half cell - which has a seat recess - and a cell with a grooved door. The floor of the cave has a coating of cement, while the ceiling of the middle room bears painted concentric circles.|$|E
5|$|Notable in Western Chalukya {{architecture}} are {{the decorative}} door panels that {{run along the}} length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> over on top to form a lintel. These decorations appear as bands of delicately chiseled fretwork, moulded colonettes and scrolls scribed with tiny figures. The bands are separated by deep narrow channels and grooves and run {{over the top of}} the door. The temple plan often included a heavy slanting cornice of double curvature, which projected outward from the roof of the open mantapa. This was intended to reduce heat from the sun, blocking the harsh sunlight and preventing rainwater from pouring in between the pillars. The underside of the cornice looks like woodwork because of the rib-work. Occasionally, a straight slabbed cornice is seen.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} {{walls of the}} throne hall are painted with a lotus bud design arranged in a geometric pattern. Within the lotus buds are seated praying deities, a common Thai motif often associated with holy places. The ceiling, which has a coffered octagonal shape section directly below the spire, is decorated with glass mosaic stars. This reinforces the impression {{of being in a}} heavenly abode. The interior panel <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> window shutters depicted standing deities facing each other holding weapons as guards for the king. The thickness of the walls allow further spaces between the shutters and the wall to be decorated, these are decorated with murals depicting trees in Chinese style.|$|E

25|$|Opening upwards, {{the doors}} evoke {{the image of}} a seagull's wings. In French they are portes {{papillon}} (butterfly doors). The papillon door, slightly different in its architecture from a gullwing door – designed by Jean Bugatti in 1939 Type 64, 14 years before Mercedes-Benz produced its similar, famous 300SL gullwing door – is a precursor, but is often overlooked when discussing gull-wing design. Conventional car doors are typically hinged at the front-facing edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> the door swings outward in a horizontal plane.|$|E
25|$|At {{the west}} end of the north aisle is a small and unusual 15th-century priests' room – an oak framed {{apartment}} of two stages lighted by a small 15th-century square-headed window. This has a heavy plank and muntin screen with narrow door and roof of heavy joists supporting the upper floor. The screen is 15th-century oak with a moulded and embattled head and rail. The door is narrow, massive and nail studded. The use of this chamber is unknown, {{it may have been the}} sacristy and muniment room or a priests' room to accommodate the monk when the Church was served by Prittlewell Priory. The hinges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> the trap door are probably original. The lower chamber is now used as the Vicar's vestry and there is an oak bier, dated 1706, in the upper chamber.|$|E
500|$|After a {{dramatic}} Atlantic Ocean recovery, Commander Shepard observed that he [...] "...didn't really feel {{the flight was}} a success until the recovery had been successfully completed. It's not the fall that hurts; it's the sudden stop." [...] Splashdown occurred with an impact comparable to landing a jet aircraft on an aircraft carrier. A recovery helicopter arrived after a few minutes, and [...] the capsule was lifted partly {{out of the water}} to allow Shepard to leave by the main hatch. He squeezed out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> into a sling hoist, and was pulled into the helicopter, which flew both the astronaut and spacecraft to the aircraft carrier [...] The whole recovery process took just eleven minutes. Shepard was celebrated as a national hero, honored with ticker-tape parades in Washington, New York and Los Angeles, and received the NASA Distinguished Service Medal from President John F. Kennedy. He was also awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.|$|E

500|$|The {{window on}} the north wall of the nave is to the east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> was added in the 19th century. It has two rounded lights (sections of window {{separated}} by mullions), in similar style to the two-light 17th-century window in the north wall of the north transept. [...] The second window in the transept, in the east wall, is from the 19th century. The two windows in the south transept, {{in the south and}} east walls, are both from the 17th century, and are square-headed with two lights. The window in the east wall of the chancel is from the 19th-century and has three lights topped with stonework trefoils. It has an external hoodmould (a decorative stone border) around the top. The glass of all the windows is patterned, and some is coloured; the coloured glass is used {{in the same way as}} in other Anglesey churches whose 19th-century restorations were aided by Henry Stanley, 3rd Baron Stanley of Alderley, an Anglesey nobleman who converted to Islam.|$|E
500|$|On October 31, 2011, Gaga {{performed}} a Bollywood version of [...] "Marry the Night" [...] in India during a Formula One after party in Greater Noida. Before the performance, she announced [...] "I feel like I've {{waited a long}} time to come here. And I feel very grateful.... For the first time ever, I'm going to sing 'Marry the Night'." [...] She sat on the piano and played a slow version of the song, accompanied by a sitar. At the 2011 MTV Europe Music Awards, Gaga gave her first televised performance of [...] "Marry the Night" [...] dressed as a satellite landing on the moon. Wearing a red bikini, and a large red disc around her, Gaga was perched atop a semi-circular replica of the moon which was covered in silver chains. Flames erupted around the stage as Gaga revealed another circular disc covering her face. She sang the song from that vantage point and near the end of the performance, removed the metal disc and {{performed a}} choreographed dance routine with her back-up dancers. She also performed the song at the 2011 Bambi Awards in Wiesbaden, Germany, on November 10. The stage included a vintage convertible with a keyboard built into the side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> Gaga also won an award later that night at the gala.|$|E
500|$|Naomi and Emily {{escape to}} the {{countryside}} later that evening and cycle to one of Emily's favourite places by a lake before sunset. After swimming in the lake, they light a campfire, and share a cannabis joint. An act of blowbacking the joint leads the two to share a kiss and they proceed to make love. Emily wakes up the following morning to find Naomi preparing to leave. She pleads with Naomi not to leave her a second time and tells her that she should accept {{that she needs to}} be loved. Naomi goes home to find Kieran in bed with her mother, and leaves for college, devastated. She sees her teachers rigging the election to prevent Cook from winning, and reveals this to the form when she is announced the winner. As his first presidential act, Cook starts a riot. In the ensuing chaos, Naomi forgives Kieran, encouraging him that if he likes her mother, he should tell her so. Naomi begins to have sex with Cook before she realises that it [...] "isn't right". Surprisingly, Cook doesn't seem to mind, as he says that she must have a good reason not to follow through because she's clever. Naomi leaves, with her and Cook now sharing a better understanding of each other. That night, she visits Emily's house, but Emily refuses to open the door, not wanting Naomi to see her after she had been crying. They sit on opposite sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> Naomi admits that she does need somebody to love her. Emily offers her hand through the door's cat flap to Naomi, who finally reciprocates Emily's feelings.|$|E

2500|$|The runestone was {{discovered}} in the early 1820s by Wallin, the caretaker of the castle, {{and it was then}} forming the threshold of the cellar of the eastern tower of the castle, the so-called [...] "theatre tower". It was under both side walls <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> also covered with tar, which suggests that it had been part of another construction before being used as construction material for the castle. It would take an additional 100 years before the stone was retrieved from the castle and could be read in its entirety.|$|E
2500|$|The tagged man chases a group into {{a subway}} station, where they cram {{themselves}} into a departing train. He manages to jam his arm between the closing doors, but the people in reach shrink away. He frustratedly pulls his arm out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and,</b> after glancing to his left, begins strolling nonchalantly past the train, its occupants jammed against the window watching him. The camera cuts ahead to reveal a lone straggler who failed to make it onto the train.

2500|$|Savile {{presented}} {{a series of}} Public Information Films promoting road safety, notably [...] "Clunk Click Every Trip", which promoted the use of seatbelts, the clunk representing the sound <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> the click {{the sound of the}} seatbelt fastening. It led to Savile's Saturday-night chat/variety show from 1973 on BBC1 entitled Clunk, Click, which in 1974 featured the UK heats of the Eurovision Song Contest featuring Olivia Newton-John. After two series, Clunk, Click was replaced by Jim'll Fix It, which he presented from 1975 to 1994. Savile won an award from Mary Whitehouse's National Viewers' and Listeners' Association in 1977 for his [...] "wholesome family entertainment". He fronted a long-running series of advertisements in the early 1980s for British Rail's InterCity 125, in which he declared [...] "This is the age of the train".
