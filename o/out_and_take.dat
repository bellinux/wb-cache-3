5|$|The Tramp {{encounters}} {{the drunken}} millionaire {{a third time}} and is again invited to the mansion. The Tramp relates the girl's plight and the millionaire gives him money for her operation. Two burglars knock the millionaire <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> {{the rest of his}} money. The burglars flee before the arrival of the police, who find the Tramp with the money the millionaire gave him, but because of the knock on his head the millionaire does not remember giving it. The Tramp evades the police long enough to get the money to the girl, telling her he will be going away for a time, but in due course he is apprehended and imprisoned.|$|E
5|$|Three months later, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) shows Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) a photo taken {{moments before}} Teddy's death, {{showing that the}} balloon moved {{horizontally}} against the wind. Chuck Burks (Bill Dow), a digital photo expert, uses software to uncover evidence of electromagnetic disturbances {{in the shape of}} a child, holding the balloon. During a visit by the agents, the Holveys adamantly dispute Mulder's theory that Teddy was led onto the tracks. Scully sees Golda (Lilyan Chauvin), Maggie's elderly Romanian mother, drawing a swastika on Charlie’s hand. Scully hypothesizes that the Holvey children may be victims of Munchausen by proxy, perpetrated by their grandmother. At a meeting with Steve Holvey, he explains that Golda was against his marriage to Maggie, and that strange things began to happen when Teddy was born and Golda came to live with the family. Steve hints that Golda might be hurting Charlie, leading Scully to suggest that they visit a social worker named Karen Kosseff (Christine Willes). When preparing to leave for a session with Kosseff, Steve and Charlie get in the car but the garage sliding door seems to be malfunctioning, making Steve to step <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> a double-sided ladder to reset the sliding door's motor but in doing so, his tie is caught in the door rails with the motor suddenly starting, strangling and hanging him. Meanwhile Charlie, having been mysteriously locked in the car, starts crying over his father's death.|$|E

By 14 April, pro-Russian separatists had taken control of government buildings in many other cities within the oblast, including Mariupol, Horlivka, Sloviansk, Kramatorsk, Yenakiieve, Makiivka, Druzhkivka, and Zhdanivka.|$|E

25|$|Preuss {{requires}} {{physical education}} through the tenth grade. At this point, students may chose to opt <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> another elective or {{try out for}} one of Preuss' five athletic teams. All Preuss teams compete in Division IV of the San Diego section of the California Interscholastic Federation. Offered sports include soccer, basketball, and lacrosse for boys and girls, as well as volleyball for girls only. Most Preuss teams are non-league and have yet to develop rivalries with other schools. Preuss has yet to win a section title game, although it appeared in one in boys' soccer in 2006–07. The game resulted in a 5–1 loss to repeat champion Francis Parker.|$|E
25|$|The economy rate is more {{important}} in one-day cricket and Twenty20 matches than in Test match cricket. The shorter forms of the game (ODI and T20) demand that bowlers (and fielders) restrict the flow of runs from the opposition to give their team {{a better chance of}} finishing the game with more runs on the board. In Tests, however, the priority when in the field is to bowl the opposition <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> all ten wickets in both the innings. A bowler's economy rate is normally calculated from their career record, but one might also calculate it for a specific period of time, such as a calendar year or the duration of a World Cup tournament. In one day matches, a career economy rate of less than five runs per over is good. Conceding too many quick runs in a Test match is sure to get you taken off by your captain and replaced with another bowler, while taking a wicket in limited overs matches invariably slows the run rate. Like many aspects of cricket, economy rate vs bowling average vs bowling strike rate is a matter of finding a good balance. In Twenty20 matches, anything under seven runs per over is considered to be good.|$|E

The closest he got to it in the film was, [...] "Come <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> it, you dirty, yellow-bellied rat, or I'll give it to you through the door!"

There is a lot of authority and a lot of strict regiment, and the kids lash <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> over the school and destroy the place." [...] The band's main goal for the video was for it to resemble an art piece, much in the same way they viewed the production of the album, to keep in line with tone. To this end, they enlisted director David LaChapelle. LaChapelle's input—which [...] "ranges from an evil prison warden cracking a whip at marching school kids to escapees ripping their uniforms and doing acrobatic moves down the hallways"—was regarded by the band as [...] "completely wacked out and twisted, which is exactly what we love." ...|$|E

2500|$|Garrison {{came under}} {{contemporary}} criticism from writers including Sylvia Meagher, who in 1967 wrote: [...] "...as the Garrison investigation continued to unfold, it gave cause for increasingly serious misgivings {{about the validity}} of his evidence, the credibility of his witnesses, and the scrupulousness of his methods. The fact that many critics of the Warren Report have remained passionate advocates of the Garrison investigation, even condoning tactics which they might not condone on the part of others, is a matter of regret and disappointment." [...] According to Clay Shaw's defense team, witnesses, including Perry Russo, claimed to have been bribed and threatened with perjury and contempt of court charges by Garrison in order to make his case against Shaw. However, in a later interview with public radio, Perry Russo stated: [...] "Well {{the truth of the matter}} was that Garrison was very sincere.

2500|$|Rankin jeopardised {{his season}} when in April 2008 he injured himself during fielding {{practice}} before a County Championship match against Worcestershire. He dived {{to stop a}} ball and landed awkwardly on his shoulder, suffering a SLAP tear to his right shoulder. He underwent an operation and {{was expected to be}} on the sidelines for about six months. After just four months, Rankin was back playing cricket. In August 2008, he made his debut for Warwickshire in a first-class match against Essex. He finished with figures of 4/80 in a drawn match as Warwickshire only bowled once. He finished the season with 12first-class wickets for Warwickshire in five matches at an average of 30.16, and did not play any one-day matches for Warwickshire. Speaking in October 2008 about his first season with Warwickshire and being coached by Allan Donald, Rankin said [...] "He [...] doesn't seek to make many technical changes during the season– that's more for the winter.

2500|$|Bowen and the Terpsichore {{spent some}} time in the North Sea, until December 1795, when his old patron, Jervis, {{replaced}} Admiral William Hotham as commander of the Mediterranean Fleet. Jervis requested Bowen to come <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> command of a squadron of small vessels operating around Gibraltar in defence of British trade and the garrison there. In early October 1796 the British squadron under Sir John Man was chased into Gibraltar by a Spanish fleet.

This was instantly met with a broadside, and a general action began. After an hour and forty minutes the frigate surrendered, and was discovered to be the Spanish Mahonesa. Terpsichore had four men wounded during the battle and none killed. Mahonesa was taken into service with the British as [...] Bowen received a piece of plate valued at 100 guineas.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the end of}} the 18th century a new room in the pub was established: the saloon. Beer establishments {{had always}} {{provided}} entertainment of some sort—singing, gaming or sport. Balls Pond Road in Islington was named after an establishment run by a Mr Ball that had a duck pond at the rear, where drinkers could, for a fee, go <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> a potshot at the ducks. More common, however, was a card room or a billiard room. The saloon was a room where for an admission fee or a higher price of drinks, singing, dancing, drama or comedy was performed and drinks would be served at the table. From this came the popular music hall form of entertainment—a show consisting of a variety of acts. A most famous London saloon was the Grecian Saloon in The Eagle, City Road, which is still famous because of a nursery rhyme: [...] "Up and down the City Road / In and out The Eagle / That's the way the money goes / Pop goes the weasel." [...] This meant that the customer had spent all his money at The Eagle, and needed to pawn his [...] "weasel" [...] to get some more. The meaning of the [...] "weasel" [...] is unclear but the two most likely definitions are: a flat iron used for finishing clothing; or rhyming slang for a coat (weasel and stoat).|$|E
2500|$|Nancy {{soon after}} becomes pregnant. Nancy begins helping her friend, Mitzeee (Rachel Shenton) who has escaped from prison. Mitzeee {{was in prison}} for the {{stabbing}} of Mercedes McQueen (Jennifer Metcalfe), Fox explained that Nancy has [...] "always known her friend was innocent" [...] as she knows that she is not capable of stabbing Mercedes. Nancy knows Mercedes has set Mitzeee up as she has threatened her on a couple of occasions, even saying [...] "something bad might happen to Nancy's baby if she doesn't get her nose out and that's made Nancy more determined". Fox said that Nancy's attitude towards Mitzeee's situation stems from when Becca was wrongly accused, sent to prison and murdered in jail which makes her [...] "really desperate to get this right for Mitzeee - to get her <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> Mercedes down!" [...] Explaining why Nancy and Mitzeee are such good friends, Fox said: [...] "They're such different people on the surface, but deep down Ann Minniver - Mitzeee's alter ego - is very moral, kind and caring and she's a very clever girl. I think those are all things that Nancy responds to and enjoys. Also, I think Mitzeee just makes Nancy laugh. Mitzeee can be a bit silly sometimes, and that makes Nancy smile". During the storyline, Nancy feuds with Mercedes. Fox said that Nancy has a bit of a [...] "bad girl" [...] in her which she shows during her confrontations with Mercedes, adding that the character has got [...] "more fire in her belly than maybe we'd realised".|$|E
