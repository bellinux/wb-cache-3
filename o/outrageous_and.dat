25|$|Young {{children}} learn {{from experience that}} stating an untruth can avoid punishment for misdeeds, before they develop the theory of mind necessary to understand why it works. In this stage of development, children will sometimes tell <b>outrageous</b> <b>and</b> unbelievable lies, because they lack the conceptual framework to judge whether a statement is believable, or even to {{understand the concept of}} believability.|$|E
25|$|Although burlesque on the surface, the novel, {{especially}} {{in its second}} half, has served as an important thematic source not only in literature but also in much of art and music, inspiring works by Pablo Picasso and Richard Strauss. The contrasts between the tall, thin, fancy-struck and idealistic Quixote and the fat, squat, world-weary Panza is a motif echoed ever since the book's publication, and Don Quixote's imaginings are the butt of <b>outrageous</b> <b>and</b> cruel practical jokes in the novel.|$|E
25|$|The {{nature that}} these demands {{were to take}} was never fully determined. In Peking, the French consul Bellonet had made <b>outrageous</b> (<b>and</b> {{as it turned out}} unofficial) demands that the Korean monarch forfeit his crown and cede {{sovereignty}} to France. Such a stance was not in keeping with the more circumspect goals of Rear Admiral Roze, who hoped to force reparations. In any case, the demands of Bellonet were never officially endorsed by the French government of Napoleon III. Bellonet would later be severely reprimanded for his importunate blusterings.|$|E

25|$|Snorri then relates that Aðils was in {{war with}} a Norwegian king named Áli, and they fought in the Battle on the Ice of Lake Vänern. Aðils was married to Yrsa, the mother of Hrólfr (Hroðulf) and so sent an embassy to Hrólfr asking him for help against Áli. He would receive three {{valuable}} gifts in recompense. Hrólfr {{was involved in a}} war against the Saxons and could not come in person but sent his twelve berserkers, including Bödvar Bjarki. Áli died in the war, and Aðils took Áli's helmet Battle-boar and his horse Raven. The berserkers demanded three pounds of gold each in pay, and they demanded to choose the gifts that Aðils had promised Hrólfr, that is the two pieces of armour that nothing could pierce: the helmet battle-boar and the mailcoat Finn's heritage. They also wanted the famous ring Svíagris. Aðils considered the pay <b>outrageous</b> <b>and</b> refused.|$|E
25|$|Snorri also {{presents}} {{the story of}} Aðils and Hrólfr Kraki (Hroðulf) in order to explain why gold was known by the kenning Kraki's seed. Snorri relates that Aðils was in war with a Norwegian king named Áli (Onela), and they fought in the Battle on the Ice of Lake Vänern. Aðils was married to Yrsa, the mother of Hrólfr and so sent an embassy to Hrólfr asking him for help against Áli. He would receive three valuable gifts in recompense.

25|$|Konoe's {{terms for}} making peace were so extreme and harsh {{that even the}} Japanese {{military}} objected to them, {{on the grounds that}} Chiang would never accept peace with them. The German Foreign Minister, Konstantin von Neurath, who was attempting to mediate a compromise peace between China and Japan as the Reich, which had friendly relations with Japan and China did not wish to choose between the two, complained, upon seeing Konoe's peace terms, that these were so intentionally <b>outrageous</b> <b>and</b> humiliating demands that they seemed to be designed only to inspire rejection on Chiang's part. Konoe's main demands were that China recognise Manchukuo, sign the Anti-Comintern Pact, allow Japanese officers to command the Chinese National Revolutionary Army, allow Japanese troops to remain indefinitely in all the areas of China they had occupied, and pay reparations to Japan. China was not only to pay the entire costs of the war run up by Japan but also a punitive amount so that the Chinese people might reflect on the folly of seeking to challenge the might of Japan.|$|E

500|$|After Hamlet, {{the company}} {{presented}} Twelfth Night {{in what the}} director, Tyrone Guthrie, summed up as [...] "a baddish, immature production of mine, with Olivier outrageously amusing as Sir Toby and a very young Alec Guinness <b>outrageous</b> <b>and</b> more amusing as Sir Andrew". Henry V was the next play, presented in May to mark the Coronation of George VI. A pacifist, as he then was, Olivier was as reluctant to play the warrior king as Guthrie was to direct the piece, but the production was a success, and Baylis had to extend the run from four to eight weeks.|$|E

So they came up with the bizarre idea of putting his presence into Anna Torv, which is outrageous. <b>Outrageous,</b> <b>and</b> yet we did it, and {{had a lot of fun}} doing it. Then we had to get him out of it. Because Leonard’s officially retired, so we did the animation to use his voice." ...|$|E
500|$|Denise Richards as Dr. Christmas Jones, an American nuclear {{physicist}} assisting Bond in his mission. Richards {{stated that}} she liked the role because it was [...] "brainy", [...] "athletic", and had [...] "depth of character, in contrast to Bond girls from previous decades". Richards stated {{that a lot of}} viewers [...] "made fun of" [...] the character's attire but that [...] "These Bond girls are so <b>outrageous</b> <b>and</b> if I did really look like a scientist, the Bond fans would have been disappointed."

A representative of the singer claimed that Carey had alerted production staff that her in-ear monitors were not working, but that they refused to address the situation, and alleged that they were [...] " [...] her up to fail." [...] Dick Clark Productions denied any wrongdoing, stating that they [...] "had no involvement" [...] in the incident, and that the allegations by Carey's management that they had intentionally sabotaged her performance were [...] "defamatory, <b>outrageous</b> <b>and</b> frankly absurd." ...|$|E

[...] Liam Lacey of Globe and Mail criticized the film, stating [...] "Though Little Miss Sunshine is consistently contrived in its characters' too-cute misery, the conclusion, which is genuinely <b>outrageous</b> <b>and</b> uplifting, is almost worth the hype." [...] Anna Nimouse of National Review {{wrote that the}} [...] "film is praised as a 'feel-good' film, perhaps for moviegoers who like bamboo under their fingernails.

500|$|... "Pinkeye" [...] {{has been}} {{described}} as one of the classic episodes of South Park.

[...] Eric Mink of the New York Daily News complimented the episode, which he felt illustrated many of the <b>outrageous</b> <b>and</b> shocking elements that had made South Park so popular. He said the episode was particularly notable for its graphic violence: [...] "Most sitcoms would have a problem doing an episode in which one regular character slices another regular character in half with a chainsaw. Not South Park." [...] Mike Higgins of The Independent said this episode helped [...] "cement (Eric Cartman's) position as one of the great, obnoxious characters of the Nineties", particularly through his Adolf Hitler Halloween costume.|$|E
500|$|On March 12, 2014, Sheindlin filed {{a lawsuit}} {{for the first time}} in her life. It was filed against Hartford, Connecticut {{personal}} injury lawyer John Haymond and his law firm. In the lawsuit, Sheindlin accused Haymond and his firm of using her television image without consent in advertisements that falsely suggested she endorsed him and his firm. Sheindlin's producer allegedly told the firm that use of her image is not permitted in March 2013, but ads continued to be produced. The lawsuit filed in federal court sought more than $75,000 in damages. Sheindlin said in her statement that any money she wins through the lawsuit will go toward college scholarships through the Her Honor Mentoring Program. Sheindlin further stated, [...] "Mr. Haymond is a lawyer and should know better. The unauthorized use of my name is <b>outrageous</b> <b>and</b> requires legal action." [...] Haymond later filed a countersuit for punitive damages and attorney's fees, alleging defamation of him and his firm by Sheindlin. Haymond insisted that local affiliates asked him to appear in Judge Judy promos to promote Sheindlin for which he obliged.|$|E

Obama said the incident did not represent the [...] "exceptional character" [...] of the American military and the respect that the United States had for the people of Afghanistan. On 13 March, he said, [...] "the United States takes this as seriously as if it were our own citizens and our own children who were murdered. We’re heartbroken over the loss of innocent life. The killing of innocent civilians is <b>outrageous</b> <b>and</b> it’s unacceptable." [...] In response to a reporter asking whether the killings could be likened to the 1968 My Lai massacre of civilians by U.S. forces in South Vietnam, Obama replied, [...] "It's not comparable.

500|$|In Shaw's view, the London theatres of the 1890s {{presented}} {{too many}} revivals of old plays {{and not enough}} new work. He campaigned against [...] "melodrama, sentimentality, stereotypes and worn-out conventions". As a music critic he had frequently been able to concentrate on analysing new works, but in the theatre he was often obliged {{to fall back on}} discussing how various performers tackled well-known plays. In a study of Shaw's work as a theatre critic, E. J. West writes that Shaw [...] "ceaselessly compared and contrasted artists in interpretation and in technique". Shaw contributed more than 150 articles as theatre critic for The Saturday Review, in which he assessed more than 212 productions. He championed Ibsen's plays when many theatregoers regarded them as <b>outrageous,</b> <b>and</b> his 1891 book Quintessence of Ibsenism remained a classic throughout the twentieth century. Of contemporary dramatists writing for the West End stage he rated Oscar Wilde above the rest: [...] "...our only thorough playwright. He plays with everything: with wit, with philosophy, with drama, with actors and audience, with the whole theatre". Shaw's collected criticisms were published as Our Theatres in the Nineties in 1932.|$|E

Everett would {{play a major role}} in Queen's early success when, in 1975, armed with an advance copy of the single [...] "Bohemian Rhapsody", Mercury went to see Everett. While privately Everett doubted any station would play the song due to its length at over 6 minutes, he said nothing to Mercury and placed the song on the turntable, and, after hearing it, enthused: [...] "forget it, it's going to be number one for centuries". While Capital Radio hadn't officially accepted the song, the anarchic Everett would talk incessantly about a record he had but couldn't play, before the song [...] "accidentally" [...] started playing, with Everett stating: [...] "Oops, my finger must've slipped." [...] Capital's switchboard was jammed with callers wanting to know when the song was going to be released – on one occasion Everett aired the song 36 times in one day.|$|E
