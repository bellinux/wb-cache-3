40|$|PURPOSE To {{validate}} <b>the</b> German version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{spinal stenosis}} measure (SSM), a disease-specific questionnaire assessing symptom severity, physical function, {{and satisfaction with}} treatment in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis. METHODS After translation, cross-cultural adaptation, and pilot testing, we assessed internal consistency, test-retest reliability, construct validity, and responsiveness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>SSM</b> subscales. Data from a large Swiss multi-center prospective cohort study were used. Reference scales for <b>the</b> assessment <b>of</b> construct validity and responsiveness were the numeric rating scale, pain thermometer, and the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire. RESULTS One hundred and eight consecutive patients were included in this validation study, recruited from five different centers. Cronbach's alpha was above 0. 8 for all three subscales <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>SSM.</b> <b>The</b> objectivity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>SSM</b> was assessed using a partial credit approach. The model showed a good global fit to <b>the</b> data. <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> 108 patients 78 participated in the test-retest procedure. The ICC values were above 0. 8 for all three subscales <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>SSM.</b> Correlations with reference scales were above 0. 7 for the symptom and function subscales. For satisfaction subscale, it was 0. 66 or above. Clinically meaningful changes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reference scales over time were associated with significantly more improvement in all three SSM subscales (p < 0. 001). Conclusion: <b>The</b> proposed version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>SSM</b> showed very good measurement properties and can be considered validated {{for use in the}} German language...|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> this {{research}} {{paper is to}} analyse the individual and collective information security risks which could arise from using a security strategy model (<b>SSM)</b> ; <b>the</b> objective <b>of</b> creating <b>the</b> <b>SSM</b> was so as to protect a {{wireless local area network}} (WLAN). As such <b>the</b> focus <b>of</b> this paper shall be on the individual operational components used to create <b>the</b> <b>SSM</b> and <b>the</b> information security risks which stem from their being part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>SSM.</b> In order to review <b>the</b> components <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>SSM</b> <b>the</b> paper shall use the BS ISO/IEC 17799 : 2005 which is the British Standard, International Standard and also the European Standard for using Information Communication Technology (ICT) correctly in order to effectively mitigate against <b>the</b> exposure <b>of</b> an organizations data to unauthorized access. <b>The</b> general idea <b>of</b> using <b>the</b> BS ISO/IEC 17799 : 2005 is so that <b>the</b> <b>SSM</b> is created based on best practice within <b>the</b> ICT industry <b>of</b> protecting confidential data or at least that the possible risks that stem from using <b>the</b> <b>SSM</b> are mitigated against; this is also known as risk based auditing.

40|$|We use Metropolis Monte Carlo and {{umbrella}} sampling {{to calculate}} <b>the</b> free energies <b>of</b> interaction of two methane molecules and their charged derivatives in cylindrical water-filled pores. Confinement strongly alters {{the interactions between}} the nonpolar solutes and completely eliminates the solvent separated minimum (SSM) that is seen in bulk water. The free energy profiles show that the methane molecules are either in contact or at separations corresponding to the diameter and <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cylindrical pore. Analytic calculations that estimate <b>the</b> entropy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> solutes, which are solvated at the pore surface, qualitatively explain <b>the</b> shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> free energy profiles.

40|$|The {{financial}} and economic crisis has hit Europe in its core. While the crisis {{may not have}} originated in the European Union, it has laid bare structural weaknesses in the EU’s policy framework. Both public finances and the banking sector have been heavily affected. For a long time, the EU failed {{to take into account}} sufficiently the perverse link that existed between the two. Negative evolutions in one field <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crisis often dragged along the other in its downward spiral. In June 2012, in <b>the</b> early hours <b>of</b> a yet another EU Summit, <b>the</b> leaders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eurozone finally decided to address the link between the banking and sovereign debt crises. Faced with soaring public borrowing costs in Spain and Italy, they decided to allow for the direct European recapitalisation <b>of</b> banks when <b>the</b> Member State itself would no longer {{be in a position to}} do so. In exchange, supervision <b>of</b> <b>the</b> banking sector would be lifted to the European level by means of a Single Supervisory Mechanism. The Single Supervisory Mechanism, or <b>SSM</b> in <b>the</b> EU jargon, is a first step in <b>the</b> broader revision <b>of</b> policies towards banks in Europe. The eventual goal is <b>the</b> creation <b>of</b> a Banking Union, which is to carry out effective surveillance and – if needed – crisis management <b>of</b> <b>the</b> banking sector. <b>The</b> <b>SSM</b> is to rely on national supervisors and the ECB, with the ECB having final authority on the matter. <b>The</b> involvement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> latter made it clear that <b>the</b> <b>SSM</b> would be centred on the eurozone – while it is to remain open to other Member States willing to join. Due to the ongoing problems and the link between <b>the</b> creation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>SSM</b> and <b>the</b> recapitalisation <b>of</b> banks, <b>the</b> <b>SSM</b> became one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> key legislative priorities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> EU. In December 2012, Member States reached an agreement on <b>the</b> design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>SSM.</b> After discussions with the European Parliament (which were still ongoing at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> writing), <b>the</b> process towards making <b>the</b> <b>SSM</b> operational can be initiated. The goal is to have <b>the</b> <b>SSM</b> fully up and running in <b>the</b> first half <b>of</b> 2014. <b>The</b> decisions that were taken in June 2012 are likely to have had a bigger impact than <b>the</b> eurozone’s Heads <b>of</b> State and Government could have realised at the time for two important reasons. On the one hand, creating <b>the</b> <b>SSM</b> necessitates a full Banking Union and therefore shared risk. On the other hand, the decisions improved <b>the</b> ECB’s perception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> willingness <b>of</b> governments to take far-reaching measures. This undoubtedly played a significant role in <b>the</b> creation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Outright Monetary Transactions programme by the ECB, which has led to a substantial easing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crisis in the short-term. 1 These short-term gains should now be matched with a stable long-term framework for bank supervision and crisis management. The agreement on <b>the</b> <b>SSM</b> should be <b>the</b> first step in <b>the</b> direction <b>of</b> this goal. This paper provides an analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>SSM</b> and its role in <b>the</b> creation <b>of</b> a Banking Union. The paper starts with a reminder <b>of</b> why <b>the</b> EU decided to put in place <b>the</b> <b>SSM</b> (§ 1) and <b>the</b> state <b>of</b> play <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ongoing negotiations on <b>the</b> <b>SSM</b> (§ 2). Subsequently, <b>the</b> supervisory responsibilities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>SSM</b> are detailed, including its scope and <b>the</b> division <b>of</b> labour between <b>the</b> national supervisors and the ECB (§ 3). <b>The</b> internal functioning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>SSM</b> (§ 4) and its relation to the other supervisors are discussed afterwards (§ 5). As mentioned earlier, <b>the</b> <b>SSM</b> is part <b>of</b> a wider move towards a Banking Union. Therefore, this paper sheds light on the other building blocks of this ambitious project (§ 6). The transition towards the Banking Union is important and will prove to be a bumpy ride.
