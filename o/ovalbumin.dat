The non-inhibitory serpin <b>ovalbumin</b> is the most abundant protein in egg white. Its exact function is unknown, but it is thought to be a storage protein for the developing foetus. Heat shock serpin 47 is a chaperone, essential for proper folding of collagen. It acts by stabilising collagen's triple helix whilst it is being processed in the endoplasmic reticulum.|$|E
500|$|In the 1980s, {{it became}} clear that these inhibitors were part of {{superfamily}} of related proteins that included both protease inhibitors (e.g. alpha 1-antitrypsin) and non-inhibitory members (e.g. <b>ovalbumin).</b> The name [...] "serpin" [...] was coined based on the most common activity of the superfamily (serine protease inhibitors). Around the same time, the first structures were solved for serpin proteins (first in the relaxed, and later in the stressed conformation). The structures indicated that the inhibitory mechanism involved an unusual conformational change and prompted the subsequent structural focus of serpin studies.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ovalbumin</b> (abbreviated OVA) is {{the main}} protein found in egg white, making up {{approximately}} 55% of the total protein. <b>Ovalbumin</b> displays sequence and three-dimensional homology to the serpin superfamily, but unlike most serpins {{it is not a}} serine protease inhibitor.

50|$|Different {{brands and}} even {{individual}} batches of flu vaccine do {{vary in their}} egg protein content. Allergists formerly used skin testing with flu vaccine to predict if receiving the flu shot might be safe, but {{the results of this}} type of testing are totally unpredictive and this type of testing should be abandoned. Instead, the age-appropriate immunization material containing the lowest amount of egg proteins should be chosen, then a 1/10 dose should be given followed by a 30-minute observation period in a medical setting fully equipped to treat any possible reaction. <b>Ovalbumin</b> is usually used as a marker for the egg proteins. Vaccines available as recently as 2010 in the US contained up to 21 µg of <b>ovalbumin</b> per 0.5 mL dose. In 2011 the <b>ovalbumin</b> content varies from less than 5.0 µg/dose down to less than 0.05 µg/dose, depending on the brand. One study done on 83 egg allergic patients resulted in a lack of serious reactions at doses of <b>ovalbumin</b> ranging from 0.10 µg to 0.60 µg. Thus so some brands available in the US in 2011 are probably safe for most egg allergic patients (administered with caution), but others may not be. For reference modern MMR vaccine (which is generally accepted now to be well tolerated by egg allergic patients, but which is still given with caution) was shown in a 2009 study reported in the BMJ to contain 0.0005 to 0.0010 µg/dose (0.5 to 1.0 ng/dose).|$|E

50|$|<b>Ovalbumin</b> is {{the most}} {{abundant}} protein in albumen. Classed as phosphoglycoprotein, during storage, it converts into s-ovalbumin (5% {{at the time of}} laying) and can reach up to 80% after six months of cold storage. <b>Ovalbumin</b> in solution is heat-resistant. Denaturation temperature is around 84°C, but it can be easily denatured by physical stresses.Conalbumin/ovotransferrin is a glycoprotein which has the capacity to bind the bi- and trivalent metal cations into a complex and is more heat sensitive than <b>ovalbumin.</b> At its isoelectric pH (6.5), it can bind two cations and assume a red or yellow color. These metal complexes are more heat stable than the native state. Ovomucoid is the major allergen from egg white and is a heat-resistant glycoprotein found to be a trypsin inhibitor. Lysozyme is a holoprotein which can lyse the wall of certain Gram-positive bacteria and is found at high levels in the chalaziferous layer and the chalazae which anchor the yolk towards the middle of the egg. Ovomucin is a glycoprotein which may contribute to the gel-like structure of thick albumen. The amount of ovomucin in the thick albumen is four times greater than in the thin albumen.|$|E
5000|$|Note {{that the}} protein [...] "albumin" [...] is spelled with an [...] "i", while [...] "albumen" [...] with an [...] "e", {{is the white}} of an egg, which {{contains}} (among other things) several dozen types of albumin (with an [...] "i"), mostly <b>ovalbumin.</b>|$|E

50|$|Petrunkin and Petrunkin (1927, 1928) {{appear to}} be the first who studied the binding of GndCl to gelatin and a mixture of {{thermally}} denatured protein from brain extract.

5000|$|There is {{evidence}} that phagosome-to-cytosol diversion (cytolic diversion) of endocytosed <b>ovalbumin</b> antigens (OVA) occur in Archaea, after which classical antigen processing for presentation by MHC I occurs. The process of endocytosis and cross-presentation (involving cytosolic diversion) can be enhanced {{by the addition of}} an adjuvant in the form of isoprenoid glycerolipid vesicles named archaeosomes and filled with the antigens. The adjuvant is recognized by phosphatidylserine receptors.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Ovalbumin</b> is {{the protein}} which makes up around {{two-thirds of the}} white of an egg. [...] When an egg is cooked, the <b>ovalbumin</b> changes {{conformation}} from its folded and soluble form to an insoluble all-β-sheet structure with exposed hydrophobic regions, leading to aggregation. This {{is a classic example}} of protein denaturation, defined as the loss of the quaternary, tertiary and secondary structures that are present in the protein's native state, by application of some external chemical or radiative stress (including heat). In order to [...] "unboil" [...] the egg, the individual protein strands must be separated from the aggregate and then re-folded back to their native form. Raston had the idea of using mechanical energy from spinning the aggregate to achieve this and developed vortex fluidic technology to implement his idea. Using it to unboil an egg (at least in part) was meant as a demonstration of the technology and won Raston and colleagues the 2015 Ig Nobel Prize in chemistry. Applications of the technology include boosting the potency of anti-cancer drugs like carboplatin and improving the production of biodiesel.|$|E
50|$|Eggs contain {{multiple}} proteins which gel {{at different}} temperatures within the yolk and the white, {{and the temperature}} determines the gelling time. Egg yolk gelifies, or solidifies, between 65 and 70 C. Egg white gels at different temperatures 60 to 73 C- the white contains <b>ovalbumin</b> that sets at the highest temperature. However, in practice, in many cooking processes the white gels first because it is exposed to higher temperatures for longer.|$|E
