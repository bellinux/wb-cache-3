These facts seemed to me to throw some light on the origin of species—that mystery of mysteries, as it has been called by one <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>greatest</b> philosophers.|$|E

Garfield wore the shirt, explaining that [...] "these shirts underscore the idea that anyone {{has the power to}} be a hero. Cancer is one <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>greatest</b> villains. I'm proud to join others in standing up to this disease." [...] Ziskin's death from cancer was used as inspiration for the cause. Sony created a website for the cause.

In 1971, Fisher's first book of poems, Poems <b>Of</b> <b>Our</b> <b>Great</b> Outdoors, was {{published}} and distributed. Red Fisher would famously give each guest {{on his show}} a copy of these poems. Three editions <b>of</b> Poems <b>Of</b> <b>Our</b> <b>Great</b> Outdoors were released, each one simply adding more poems to the previous collection. Red released a record on Saga Records also called Poems <b>of</b> <b>Our</b> <b>Great</b> Outdoors in which he read his poems to a symphonic background.|$|R

500|$|DAAS employ an aggressive, confrontational style, which {{author and}} {{journalist}} Geoff Bartlett describes as [...] " [...] {{the boundaries of}} humour and good taste to their absolute limits". They frequently delve into topical and taboo subject matter with songs such as [...] "Commies for Christ" [...] and [...] "I Fuck Dogs". [...] "Long before anyone knew the term, one <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>greatest</b> driving forces was to be politically incorrect," [...] said Ferguson. Each band member developed distinctive onstage characters, with McDermott adopting a nasty, mean persona, while Ferguson played a narcissistic character who was [...] "gorgeous but stupid". Fidler initially played the straight man, but as the group became more aggressive he developed into a character who was naturally happy and caring but frequently victimised by his fellow band members.|$|E
500|$|After Crane's {{premature}} death from tuberculosis {{at the age}} of 28, his work enjoyed a resurgence of popularity. Author and critic Elbert Hubbard wrote in Crane's obituary in the Philistine that [...] "The Open Boat" [...] was [...] "the sternest, creepiest bit of realism ever penned". Also noting the depressing Realism utilized in the story, editor Vincent Starrett stated: [...] "It is a desolate picture, and the tale is one <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>greatest</b> short stories." [...] Another of the author's friends, H. G. Wells, wrote that [...] "The Open Boat" [...] was [...] "beyond all question, the crown of all [...] work." [...] Singling out Crane's usage of color and chiaroscuro in his writing, Wells continued: [...] "It has all the stark power of the earlier stories, with a new element of restraint; the color is as full and strong as ever, fuller and stronger, indeed; but those chromatic splashes that at times deafen and confuse in The Red Badge, those images that astonish rather than enlighten, are disciplined and controlled." [...] The story remains popular with critics; Thomas Kent referred to [...] "The Open Boat" [...] as Crane's [...] "magnum opus", while Crane biographer Stanley Wertheim called it [...] "Crane's finest short story and one of the masterworks of late nineteenth-century American literature".|$|E

2500|$|André Bazin, the {{founding}} editor of Cahiers, made a more measured assessment: [...] "René Clair has remained {{in a way}} a film-maker of the silent cinema. Whatever the quality and importance of his recent films, expression through the image always predominates over that of the word and one almost never misses the essence if one can only vaguely hear the dialogue." [...] It was also in a special number of Cahiers du Cinéma reviewing {{the current state of}} the French cinema in 1957 that Clair received one of his most positive appreciations: [...] "A complete film author who, since the silent era, has brought to the French cinema intelligence, refinement, humour, an intellectual quality that is slightly dry but smiling and in good taste.... Whatever may follow in his rich career, he has created a cinematic world that is his own, full of rigour and not lacking in imagination, thanks to which he remains one <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>greatest</b> film-makers." ...|$|E

Lee Gaze stated [...] "Start Something is the greatest hits of what Lostprophets do". Aled Phillips of Kids In Glass Houses said [...] "it was a turning point for a lot of bands" [...] but also that [...] "everyone's jeans got tighter and started wearing Nike Dunks - it was a cultural shift. With them it was never just about the music, everybody got swept up in the whole aesthetic as well". Five British rock records - All Our Kings Are Dead, We Are the Dynamite, World Record, Free and Hold Me Down - were all cited as being heavily influenced by Start Something.|$|E
