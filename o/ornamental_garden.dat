5|$|The {{botanic garden}} {{may be an}} {{independent}} institution, a governmental operation, or affiliated to a college or university. If a department of an educational institution, it {{may be related to}} a teaching program. In any case, it exists for scientific ends and is not to be restricted or diverted by other demands. It is not merely a landscaped or <b>ornamental</b> <b>garden,</b> although it may be artistic, nor is it an experiment station or yet a park with labels on the plants. The essential element is the intention of the enterprise, which is the acquisition and dissemination of botanical knowledge.|$|E
5|$|Robert {{went on to}} rent further {{land around}} the north of Plas Mawr. The land {{at the south end}} of the burgage, however, facing onto the High Street, belonged to a Robert Laythwood, who had a house there. Wynne {{purchased}} this in 1585, probably for the relatively high price of £40, and demolished it to enable the final phase of development, using the space to build a gatehouse that formed the new entrance to Plas Mawr. Further small pieces of land were bought on the north-west side of the house and converted into an <b>ornamental</b> <b>garden,</b> bringing the total cost of the land to around £300. The result was the grandest Elizabethan town house in Wales at the time.|$|E

25|$|On {{the hill}} to the east of Grenadier Pond, {{extending}} up to Colborne Lodge Road, is a landscaped <b>ornamental</b> <b>garden</b> area. There is a 'rock garden' extending {{from the top of the}} hill near Grenadier Cafe, extending south-west nearly to the pond shore. Along Colborne Lodge Road is a hanging garden and <b>ornamental</b> <b>garden</b> with fountains, the 'sunken gardens.' At the bottom of the hill, nearly at the shore line is a large maple leaf-shaped flower bed, visible from the top of the hill. The area was a tobogganing area in the early 1900s. Toboggan runs were constructed from the top of the hill extending down to the pond's ice surface. Wedding photography is no longer permitted in the hillside gardens area.|$|E

25|$|The {{largest single}} ransacking of the {{monument}} was the removal of several hundred tons to construct the nearby turnpike road. Stones from the monument were also taken to build the nearby house and farm; other stones were used in an <b>ornamental</b> <b>garden</b> in Tunstall Park. The holed stone was broken some time before 1854; the top half was found replaced in 1877, but was gone again by 1935.|$|E

25|$|Believed to {{have been}} built around 1905, the wall {{was part of the}} {{original}} gardens of Wardown House before it was made into a public park. The condition of the Daisy Chain Wall had deteriorated over the years until many of its features were damaged and destroyed, however with extensive re-construction the wall now appears as it did one hundred years ago. The wall separates the main park from the pleasure garden, which was formerly an <b>ornamental</b> <b>garden</b> containing trees such as giant redwoods and an avenue of limes.|$|E
25|$|Softly, {{well before}} the winter dawn, the yellow monster lurched towards the grey façade.

25|$|During {{the period}} of {{dereliction}} much of the garden (including kitchen gardens and greenhouses to the north) became severely overgrown, and the parkland was used as grazing land (with the Library employed as a grain store). Much of the <b>ornamental</b> <b>garden</b> {{to the south and}} east has been restored and replanted, with work done by volunteers from the National Trust Activities Group (NTAG) and the London Wildlife Trust (and, in the replanting of trees, by the Stanley Smith Horticultural Trust, the Men of the Trees, the Countryside Commission and the South East Electricity Board after the Great Storm of 1987). Forming part of the High Weald AONB since October 1983, the parkland and gardens were given Grade II listed status in 1987.|$|E
25|$|Aloeae is a {{tribe of}} {{succulent}} {{plants in the}} subfamily Asphodeloideae of the family Asphodelaceae, consisting of the aloes and their close relatives. The taxon may also be treated as the subfamily Alooideae by those botanists who retain the narrower circumscription of Asphodelaceae adopted prior to the APG III system. Typically, plants have rosettes of more or less succulent leaves, {{with or without a}} distinct stem. Their flowers are arranged in racemes and tend to be either small and pale, pollinated by insects, or larger and more brightly coloured, pollinated by birds. , 11 genera are recognized, most created since 2010 by splitting off another five genera from Aloe and another two from Haworthia. Only two genera, Aloe and Aloidendron, are native outside southern Africa, extending northwards to the Arabian Peninsula. Seven genera are restricted to South Africa, some with small ranges. Members of the Aloeae are cultivated by succulent plant enthusiasts; Aloe species especially are used in temperate climates as <b>ornamental</b> <b>garden</b> plants. Some species are used in traditional medicine. Aloe vera and Aloe ferox are cultivated for their extracts, whose uses include moisturizers and emollients in cosmetics.|$|E
25|$|Fritillaria (fritillaries) is a genus {{of spring}} {{flowering}} herbaceous bulbous perennial {{plants in the}} lily family (Liliaceae). The type species, Fritillaria meleagris, was first described in Europe in 1571, while other species from the Middle East and Asia were also introduced to Europe at that time. The genus has about 130–140 species divided among eight subgenera. The flowers are usually solitary, nodding and bell-shaped with bulbs that have fleshy scales, resembling those of lilies. They {{are known for their}} very large genome size and genetically are very closely related to lilies. They are native to the temperate regions of the Northern hemisphere, from the Mediterranean and North Africa through Eurasia and southwest Asia to western North America. Many are endangered due to enthusiastic picking. The name Fritillaria is thought to refer to the checkered pattern of F. meleagris, resembling a box in which dice were carried. Fritillaries are commercially important in horticulture as <b>ornamental</b> <b>garden</b> plants and also in traditional Chinese medicine, which is also endangering a number of species. Fritillaria flowers have been popular subjects for artists to depict and as emblems of regions and organisations.|$|E

40|$|Climate, water shortages, poor soils, pests, {{isolation}} and the impermanence of settlements made <b>ornamental</b> <b>gardening</b> difficult for householders on the mining fields of Queensland's dry tropics between 1860 and 1960. Only some tried {{to overcome these}} disadvantages. Out of the many motivations that exist for <b>ornamental</b> <b>gardening,</b> the principal reasons here {{seem to have been}} the love of plants, climate mitigation, expectations of gender and class, the desire of schools to civilise their students, aesthetics derived from European tastes, and attempts to improve the raw rough mining settlements...|$|R
500|$|Explorer Thomas Mitchell {{collected}} the type specimen, from which George Bentham wrote the species description in 1842. No subspecies are recognised. The bark of A. pycnantha produces more tannin {{than any other}} wattle species, resulting in its commercial cultivation for production of this compound. It has been widely grown as an <b>ornamental</b> <b>garden</b> plant and for cut flower production, but has become a weed in South Africa, Tanzania, Italy, Portugal, Sardinia, India, Indonesia, New Zealand, as well as Western Australia, Tasmania and New South Wales. [...] Acacia pycnantha was made the official floral emblem of Australia in 1988, and has been featured on the country's postal stamps.|$|E
500|$|There {{are three}} war {{memorials}} in the park. There is a Boer War memorial {{in the central}} section of the park around 100 metres south of Saltwell Towers. This consists of a bronze angel perched on a granite plinth and is dated 1905. A modern Durham Light Infantry memorial was unveiled on 12 July 1981 by the mayor of Newcastle. This {{takes the form of}} a sandstone wall with adjoining flanking walls which create a small <b>ornamental</b> <b>garden.</b> There are three plaques and a description commemorating men of the battalion who died in battle between 190045. The third war memorial is the bridge adjoining the lawned, central gardens to the belvedere walls of Saltwell Towers. This timber footbridge, [...] long and [...] wide, is named the Primosole Bridge and is a copy of the original Edwardian bridge which once crossed the ha-ha. The name is carved onto a low stone wall which runs alongside and an inscription commemorates the men of the Durham Light Infantry who died whilst crossing the original Primosole Bridge during Operation Fustian in the Second World War.|$|E
