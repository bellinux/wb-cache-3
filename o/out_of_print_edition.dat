40|$|Women's Work" is {{a generous}} {{anthology}} of women's poetry in English featuring writers from 1900 {{through to the}} present. The poems are gathered under themed subject headings (Work, Childhood, Demotics, the Divine, Lust) which reflect women's lives, rather than chronology or nationality. Authors from the USA, Canada, UK, Australia, New Zealand and the Caribbean are included. The book aims to be scholarly in its inclusiveness yet popular in scope. "Women's Work" showcases in a unified way the range, craft, intelligence and skill of women's poetry, seen in context with its development {{over the last century}} and alongside writing from around the world. It does not seek to establish a canon, other than one of excellence and is an unwilling participator in the inevitable gender politicisation of such anthologies.

500|$|Rand's first {{published}} novel, the semi-autobiographical We the Living, {{was published in}} 1936. Set in Soviet Russia, it focused on the struggle {{between the individual and}} the state. In a 1959 foreword to the novel, Rand stated that We the Living [...] "is as near to an autobiography as I will ever write. It is not an autobiography in the literal, but only in the intellectual sense. The plot is invented, the background is not..." [...] Initial sales were slow and the American publisher let it go <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>print,</b> although European <b>editions</b> continued to sell. After the success of her later novels, Rand was able to release a revised version in 1959 that has since sold over three million copies. In 1942, without Rand's knowledge or permission, the novel was made into a pair of Italian films, Noi vivi and Addio, Kira.

5000|$|A Complete Concordance to the Holy Scriptures, {{generally}} {{known as}} Cruden's Concordance, is a concordance of the King James Bible (KJV) that was singlehandedly created by Alexander Cruden (1699-1770). The Concordance {{was first published}} in 1737 and has not been <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>print</b> since then.Two <b>editions</b> <b>of</b> the Concordance appeared during his lifetime, 1761 and 1769.(Reference 1955 edition)Cruden's concordance {{was first published in}} 1737, one of the first copies being personally presented to Queen Caroline on November 3, 1737. Cruden began work on his concordance in 1735 whilst a bookseller in London. Cruden worked alone from 7am to 1am every day and completed the bulk of the work in less than a year. The proofreading and layout took a little longer. His brain was occupied with nothing else, so much so that he failed to notice the diminishing stock in his bookshop and the consequent lack of custom. [...] "Was there ever, before or since the year 1737", writes his biographer Edith Olivier, [...] "another enthusiast for whom it was no drudgery, but a sustained passion of delight, to creep conscientiously word by word through every chapter of the Bible, and that not once only, but again and again?".|$|R

However, around 1987, the United Dairies catalogue began to describe this as a [...] "remix". http://www.brainwashed.com/common/htdocs/discog/ud08.html. Some sources declare that this edition is drastically reworked http://www.nndb.com/music/154/000035049/. If this is the case, then the exact date at which Stapleton destroyed the tapes may be moot. The cassette format is still available via U.S. label RRR under a licensing deal covering a number of early United Dairies cassette releases. A widely circulated [...] "United Dairies" [...] CD edition was a bootleg. The 2007 CD edition used the aforementioned remaster by Kevin Spencer and came as a standard CD in digipak covered with a plastic slipcase with Stapleton's sleevenote and a special edition with a framed and mounted insect in a box signed by Stapleton.http://raashrecords.com/shop/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=1&products_id=61 When this went <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>print,</b> a new <b>edition</b> was prepared in 2010 that disposed of the plastic slipcase and added a newly prepared remix track, entitled [...] "Tooth, Teeth, Milk, Teeth, Skin." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1622 Banister {{published}} a second edition of a Treatise of One Hundred and Thirteen Diseases of the Eyes and Eyelids, with some profitable additions of certain principles and experiments, by Richard Banister, oculist and practitioner in physic. It is a translation from the French of Jacques Guillemeau, made by one A. H., {{and at its}} first publication dedicated to the elder Banister. Guillemeau was a distinguished surgeon at the courts of Charles IX, Henry III, and Henry IV of France, and his work, Traité des Maladies de l'Œil (Handbook for treatment of ailments of the eye), was published in Paris in 1585, and at Lyon in 1610, and was translated both into Flemish and into German. The English translation by A. H. having become <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>print,</b> a second <b>edition</b> was published in 1622 by Richard Banister, together with an ‘appendant part’ called Cervisia Medicata, Purging Ale, with divers aphorisms and principles. The work received the name of Banister's Breviary of the Eyes in which the curative properties of Malvern water are also mentioned. In this treatise he names the best oculists for the last fifty or sixty years, not university graduates. Banister was buried at St. Mary's, Stamford, Lincolnshire, 7 April 1626. His wife Anne was buried there 16 April 1624.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Harcourt's reprint of John Evelyn's Life of Mrs. Godolphin is {{a welcome}} {{addition}} {{to the list of}} charming library books. Mr. Harcourt's grandfather, the Archbishop of York, himself John Evelyn's great-great- grandson, inherited the manuscript from his distinguished ancestor, and in 1847 entrusted it for publication to Samuel Wilberforce, then Bishop of Oxford. As the book has been for a long time <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>print,</b> this new <b>edition</b> is sure to awake fresh interest {{in the life of the}} noble and virtuous lady whom John Evelyn so much admired. Margaret Godolphin was one of the Queen's Maids of Honour at the Court of Charles II., and was distinguished for the delicate purity of her nature, as well as for her high intellectual attainments. Some of the extracts Evelyn gives from her Diary seem to show an austere, formal, almost ascetic spirit; but it was inevitable that a nature so refined as hers should have turned in horror from such ideals of life as were presented by men like Buckingham and Rochester, like Etheridge, Killigrew, and Sedley, like the King himself, to whom she could scarcely bring herself to speak. After her marriage she seems to have become happier and brighter, and her early death makes her a pathetic and interesting figure in the history of the time. Evelyn can see no fault in her, and his life of her is the most wonderful of all panegyrics.|$|R
