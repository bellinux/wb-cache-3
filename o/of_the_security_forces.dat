5|$|In 1956, over 9,000 socialist and populist {{politicians}} were released from prison. A few Jewish functionaries <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> <b>forces</b> {{were brought to}} court {{in the process of}} de-Stalinization. According to Heather Laskey, it was not a coincidence that the high ranking Stalinist security officers put on trial by Gomułka were Jews. Władysław Gomułka was captured by Światło, imprisoned by Romkowski in 1951 and interrogated by both, him and Fejgin. Gomułka escaped physical torture only as a close associate of Joseph Stalin, and was released three years later. According to some sources, the categorization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> <b>forces</b> as a Jewish institution—as disseminated in the post-war anticommunist press at various times—was rooted in Żydokomuna: the belief that the secret police was predominantly Jewish became one of the factors contributing to the post-war view of Jews as agents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> <b>forces.</b>|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} attack, {{hundreds}} of policemen and army forces personnel and two {{armored personnel carriers}} were brought into Yerevan, positioned on Baghramyan Avenue surrounding the National Assembly building. An anti-terrorist squad from Russia also participated in the operation. Meanwhile, ambulance vehicles rushed {{to the site of}} the shooting. President Robert Kocharyan was directing the operation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> <b>forces</b> around the parliament building. While holding around 50 hostages inside the building, the men demanded a helicopter and airtime on national television for a political statement.|$|E
5|$|Soviet-oriented parties, {{backed by}} the Soviet Red Army and in control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> <b>forces,</b> held most of the power, {{concentrated}} especially in the Polish Workers' Party under Władysław Gomułka and Bolesław Bierut. Bierut represented the influx of appointees to the Polish party coming (during and after the war) from the Soviet Union and imposed by the Soviets, a process accelerated {{at the time of}} the PPR Congress of December 1945. The party's membership dramatically increased from perhaps a few thousand in early 1945 to over one million in 1948.|$|E

5|$|Fireforce was {{a variant}} on the {{vertical}} envelopment tactic in which ground {{troops would be}} carried directly to the target by air and dropped. It was designed to react instantly to guerrilla ambushes, farm attacks and sightings, and could also be called upon by members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> <b>forces</b> as reinforcements. Preparatory deployment was very flexible: all that was required for a base was an airstrip. There would usually be three main Fireforces in operation at each time, each {{of which would be}} handled by a company-sized body of men, usually one of the RLI Commandos or a company of the Rhodesian African Rifles. The unit in question would be posted at a forward airfield for six weeks (though sometimes for longer) and given responsibility for thousands of square kilometres of Rhodesian countryside. The Selous Scouts' hidden forward observation posts (OPs) allowed for instant reactions by Fireforce to sightings of the enemy guerrillas.|$|E
5|$|Heydrich {{developed}} close professional relationships {{only within}} the circle of the SS security forces. Heinrich Müller was one such example, and Heydrich appears to have trusted him. Adolf Eichmann's straightforward loyalty impressed Heydrich, and was one reason why he appointed him as secretary for the Wannsee Conference. Herbert Kappler, who was appointed as commander of all SS security forces in Rome, {{was said to have}} been a protégé of Heydrich. SS personnel favoured by Heydrich, especially those who attended the Wannsee conference, possessed similar traits of devotion to SS, lack of remorse regarding brutal or genocidal orders, and above all personal loyalty to Heydrich in his capacity as commander <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> <b>forces.</b> On the other hand, Heydrich's dislike and distrust of Arthur Nebe and Walter Schellenberg may have stemmed from their independence and ambition.|$|E
5|$|Turner and Meyszner clashed {{continually}} throughout 1942, as Meyszner {{sought to}} remove all police matters from Turner's remit, including the supervision <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> <b>forces</b> of the Serbian collaborationist regime. In response, Turner fought hard to maintain control over these areas. Meyszner believed {{the only way to}} maintain peace and security was the use of brutal police methods; Turner wanted to empower the Nedić regime and then replace the military administration with a civil one, akin to the Reichskommissariat Niederlande, with himself as Reichskommissar (governor). Meyszner attempted to have Turner's staff downgraded and incorporated into Bader's staff but Wolff intervened to prevent this. However, Turner's approach was also seriously out-of-step with the Wehrmacht, which considered the territory a combat zone and wanted to eliminate inefficiencies and overlapping jurisdictions.|$|E

5|$|The book is {{a fictional}} autobiography, {{describing}} the life of Maximilien Aue, a former officer in the SS who, decades later, {{tells the story of}} a crucial part of his life when he was an active member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> <b>forces</b> of the Third Reich. Aue begins his narrative as a member of an Einsatzgruppe in 1941, before being sent to the doomed German forces locked in the Battle of Stalingrad, which he survives. After a convalescence period in Berlin, and a visit to occupied France, he is designated for an advisory role for the concentration camps, and visits the extermination camps. He is ultimately present during the 1945 Battle of Berlin, the Nazi regime's last stand. By the end of the story, he flees Germany under a false French identity to start a new life in northern France. Throughout the account, Aue meets several famous Nazis, including Adolf Eichmann, Heinrich Himmler and Adolf Hitler. In the book, Aue accepts responsibility for his actions, but most of the time he feels more like an observer than a direct participant.|$|E
