40|$|This paper {{describes}} a telematic {{system based on}} an intelligent van which is capable of tracing pharmaceutical drugs <b>over</b> <b>delivery</b> routes from a warehouse to pharmacies, without altering carriers' daily conventional tasks. The intelligent van understands its environment, taking into account its location, the assets and the predefined delivery route; with the capability of reporting incidences to carriers in case of failure according to the established distribution plan. It is a non-intrusive solution which represents a successful experience of using smart environments and an optimized Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) embedded system in a viable way to resolve a real industrial need in the pharmaceutical industry. The combination of deterministic modeling of the indoor vehicle, the implementation of an ad-hoc radiating element and an agile software platform within an overall system architecture leads to a competitive, flexible and scalable solution.

40|$|The {{advantages}} of delivering injections via needle-free methods are numerous. However, conventional methods for needle-free injection lack sufficient control over {{depth of penetration}} and shape of injection. Thus, a needle-free injector was designed, constructed, and tested, using a controllable linear Lorentz-force actuator. This actuator allows rapid control of the injection pressure during injections. Using this device, precise control <b>over</b> <b>delivery</b> parameters can be achieved. In addition, several portable power systems for this injector were developed, allowing the energy-intensive needle-free injector {{to be used in}} the field. The injector design was tested for repeatability and use for both in-vitro and in-vivo testing on murine tissue using a bacterial collagenase. by Brian D. Hemond. Thesis (S. B.)

The demand {{comes at a}} certain time in the future. The manufacturer may order the product in advance with a relatively low cost. She can order additional amount by expediting after the demand is realized. There are a number of expediting options, each of which corresponds to a certain delivery lead time and a unit procurement price. The unit procurement price is decreasing <b>over</b> <b>delivery</b> lead time. The selling price is also decreasing over time. In this paper, we assume that the manufacturer must deliver all products to the customer in a single shipment. The problem can be formulated as a profit maximization problem.

40|$|Malignant gliomas are {{the most}} common primary brain tumors. Despite {{intensive}} clinical investigation and many novel therapeutic approaches, average survival for the patients with malignant gliomas is only about 1 year. Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inclucing ligand (TRAIL) has shown potent and cancer-selective killing activity and drawn considerable attention as a promising therapy for cancers, but concerns <b>over</b> <b>delivery</b> and toxicity have limited progress. We have developed a secretable trimeric TRAIL (stTRAIL) and here evaluated the therapeutic potential of this stTRAIL-based gene therapy in brain tumors. An adenovirus (Ad-stTRAIL) delivering stTRAIL was injected into intra-cranial human glioma tumors established in nude mice and tumor growth monitored using the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Ad-stTRAIL gene therapy showed potent tumor suppressor activity with no toxic side effects at therapeutically effective doses. When compared with 1, 3 -bis(2 -chloroethyl) - 1 -nitrosourea (BCNU), a conventional therapy for malignant gliomas, Ad-stTRAIL suppressed tumor growth more potently. The combination of Ad-stTRAIL and BCNU significantly increased survival compared to the control mice or mice receiving Ad-stTRAIL alone. Our data indicate that Ad-stTRAIL, either alone or combined with BCNU, has promise as a novel therapy for malignant gliomas. Copyright: © 2009 Jeong et al...|$|E
40|$|Nanoparticles (NPs) {{can be used}} to {{overcome}} the side effects of poor distribution of anticancer drugs. Among other NPs, colloidal gold nanoparticles (GNPs) offer the possibility of transporting major quantities of drugs due to their large surface-to-volume ratio. This is while confining these anticancer drugs as closely as possible to their biological targets through passive and active targeting, thus ensuring limited harmful systemic distribution. In this study, we chose to use bleomycin (BLM) as the anticancer drug due to its limited therapeutic efficiency (harmful side effects). BLM was conjugated onto GNPs through a thiol bond. The effectiveness of the chemotherapeutic drug, BLM, is observed by visualizing DNA double strand breaks and by calculating the survival fraction. The action of the drug (where the drug takes effect) is known to be in the nucleus, and our experiments have shown that some of the GNPs carrying BLM were present in the nucleus. The use of GNPs to deliver BLM increased the delivery and therapeutic efficacy of the drug. Having a better control <b>over</b> <b>delivery</b> of anticancer drugs using GNPs will establish a more successful NP-based platform for a combined therapeutic approach. This {{is due to the fact}} that GNPs can also be used as radiation dose enhancers in cancer research...|$|E
