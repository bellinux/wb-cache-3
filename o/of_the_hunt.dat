40|$|This bachelor's thesis {{deals with}} <b>the</b> {{compulsory}} connection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rights to <b>hunt</b> with <b>the</b> ownership <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hunting</b> lands. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> {{this work is}} to divide and describe two kinds of hunting grounds according to <b>the</b> types <b>of</b> ownership <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hunting</b> lands. There is also an economic analysis of revenues and expenses regarding hunting rights in these hunting grounds. It further analyses <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> diminishing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> minimum area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hunting</b> grounds on <b>the</b> economy <b>of</b> <b>hunting.</b> It also tries {{to find out whether}} the diminishing would lead to hunting rights more interwoven with <b>the</b> ownership <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hunting</b> lands. <b>The</b> conducted research confirmed <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> two types of hunting grounds that differ by <b>the</b> kind <b>of</b> ownership and also revenues and expenses regarding hunting rights in these hunting lands. It was further found out that <b>the</b> diminishing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> minimum area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hunting</b> grounds would increase <b>the</b> bindingness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hunting</b> rights with <b>the</b> ownership <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hunting</b> lands. <b>The</b> economic impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> diminishing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> minimum area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hunting</b> ground couldn't be unequivocally determined...|$|R
50|$|In Kenya, Tanzanian cheetahs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Masai Mara <b>hunt</b> {{after sunset}} to escape <b>the</b> high {{temperatures}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day.

5|$|Related to weapon {{dances and}} war dances is the dance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hunt.</b> A very early {{reference}} to a weapon dance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hunt</b> {{comes in the form}} of a rock engraving at Çatal Höyük, the large neolithic settlement in south-central Anatolia. It depicts a hunting ritual involving dancers holding their bows; one figure has a bow in each hand, two perform artistic leaps and another holds a horn-shaped stick and is striking a frame drum.|$|E

5|$|A {{party of}} noblemen seeking {{refreshment}} following the rigors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hunt</b> {{arrive in the}} village. Albrecht hurries away, knowing he would be recognized by Bathilde, who is in attendance. The villagers welcome the party, offer them drinks, and perform several dances. Bathilde is charmed with Giselle's sweet and demure nature, not knowing of her relationship with Albrecht. Giselle is honored when the beautiful stranger offers her a necklace as a gift before the group of nobles depart.|$|E
5|$|About a {{thousand}} pilot whales are killed this way {{each year on}} the Faroe Islands together with usually a few dozen up to a few hundred animals belonging to other small cetaceans species, but numbers vary greatly per year. The amount of Pilot Whales killed each year is not {{believed to be a}} threat to the sustainability of the population, but the brutal appearance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hunt</b> has resulted in international criticism especially from animal welfare organisations.|$|E
50|$|The tower - {{and also}} <b>the</b> <b>hunting</b> lodge <b>of</b> Kehrdichannichts only 600 metres away - were {{probably}} built by John Frederick of Leiningen (1661-1722) initially to guard <b>the</b> boundary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hunting</b> grounds between Leiningen and Electoral Palatinate, {{and then later}} expanded into a small Baroque hunting lodge. They lie fairly high up on <b>the</b> southwestern ridge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dreispitz; and enabled good observation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hunting</b> activities <b>of</b> their neighbours from Electoral Palatinate.|$|R

5|$|In August 1928, Godley was {{appointed}} to the governorship of Gibraltar, a position in which he remained until his retirement in 1933. Godley was considered the ablest of the immediate post war governors although he made a misjudgement in interfering in the politics of the Royal Calpe Hunt. The King had to intercede after Godley removed the master <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hunt</b> creating large divisions that were not repaired until his successor took charge.|$|E
5|$|The rush: If {{the prey}} {{attempts}} to flee, the wolves immediately pursue it. This {{is the most}} critical stage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hunt,</b> as wolves may never catch up with prey running at top speed. If their prey is travelling in a group, the wolves either attempt {{to break up the}} herd, or isolate one or two animals from it.|$|E

5|$|French cuisine varies {{according}} to the season. In summer, salads and fruit dishes are popular because they are refreshing and produce is inexpensive and abundant. Greengrocers prefer to sell their fruit and vegetables at lower prices if needed, rather than see them rot in the heat. At the end of summer, mushrooms become plentiful and appear in stews throughout France. The hunting season begins in September and runs through February. Game of all kinds is eaten, often in elaborate dishes that celebrate the success <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hunt.</b> Shellfish are at their peak when winter turns to spring, and oysters appear in restaurants in large quantities.|$|E
5|$|HMS Ledbury was {{an escort}} {{destroyer}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hunt</b> class Type II. The Royal Navy ordered Ledburys construction {{two days after}} the outbreak of the Second World War and J. I. Thornycroft Ltd laid down her keel at their Southampton yard on 24 January 1940. Air raid damage to the yard delayed her construction and she did not launch until 27 September 1941. Her initial assignment was to perform escort duties between Scapa Flow and Iceland. She remained in this theatre for {{the first part of the}} war, during which time she served with the ill-fated Arctic convoy PQ 17 in June 1942, from which twenty-four ships were lost.|$|E
5|$|Porpoises {{and other}} smaller cetaceans, mainly dolphins, are hunted in an {{activity}} known as drive hunting. This is accomplished by driving a pod together with boats and usually into a bay or onto a beach. Their escape is prevented by closing off the route to the ocean with other boats or nets. Porpoises are hunted this way in several places around the world, including the Solomon Islands, the Faroe Islands, Peru, and Japan, the most well-known practitioner of this method. By numbers, porpoises are mostly hunted for their meat, though some end up in dolphinariums. Despite the controversial nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hunt</b> resulting in international criticism, and the possible health risk that the high methylmercury levels impose, thousands of porpoises are caught in drive hunts each year.|$|E
40|$|In recent years, for {{progress}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> semiconductor devices, synchronous motor {{is used for}} variable speed drive.

5|$|The terrier of {{this period}} was short of leg, built in a chunky fashion, and had a skull that was broad across the top. Used in hunting packs and kept in kennels along with English Foxhounds, they were bred {{for their ability to}} drive the fox out of its den. Gradually the pace <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hunt</b> became faster, and the terriers were bred with longer legs for more speed {{towards the end of the}} 18th century. However the {{increased}} size meant that the Fox Terrier became too big to be used for its original purpose, and its use in fox hunting began to decline.|$|E
5|$|Violence {{reached a}} peak on 12 August 1969, {{culminating}} in the Battle of the Bogside—a three-day pitched battle between residents and the RUC. On 14 August units of the British Army were deployed {{at the edge of}} the Bogside and the RUC were withdrawn. The Derry Citizens Defence Association (DCDA) declared their intention to hold the area against both the RUC and the British Army until their demands were met. The British Army made no attempt to enter the area. The situation continued until October 1969 when, following publication <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hunt</b> Report, military police were allowed in.|$|E
5|$|Talion is then {{sought out}} by the warrior Lithariel, the {{daughter}} of Queen Marwen (Claudia Black), who claims {{to be able to}} assist Celebrimbor with his mission. Marwen is the ruler of Núrn, a kingdom of sea raiders located in the south of Mordor. She uses her powers to guide Talion and Celebrimbor to another of Celebrimbor's relics. Talion also gets help from a Dwarf hunter named Torvin, teaching Talion the ways <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hunt</b> to dominate Caragors and Graugs (beasts native to Mordor), eventually fighting a massive Graug from Torvin's past who killed Torvin's hunting partner, later revealed to be his brother. Later, Marwen advises them to use Celebrimbor's powers to take control of an army of orcs and other beasts, using them to lead an assault against Sauron. Talion eventually realizes that the wizard Saruman is possessing Marwen, and assists Lithariel in freeing her from his control. Talion, however, still carries out Saruman's plan, leading an army of mind-controlled orcs in an assault against the Black Hand's stronghold at Ered Glamhoth. However, rather than the Black Hand, Talion finds the Tower of Sauron waiting for him. The Tower mockingly taunts Talion that Celebrimbor chose him as a host and can free him at any time and offers the elf a place at Sauron's side. Refusing the offer, the two battle and Talion emerges victorious after viciously stabbing the Tower to death with his son's sword. Afterwards, Celebrimbor confesses that the Tower told the truth and promises to let Talion join his family in death if he wishes, once the Black Hand is slain.|$|E
