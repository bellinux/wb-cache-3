5|$|Mullen's film debut {{was in a}} film by Phil Joanou called Entropy {{where he}} played himself {{alongside}} bandmate Bono. He played a thief in Man <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Train,</b> which starred Donald Sutherland. Filmed in Orangeville, Ontario, Canada, Man <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Train</b> was released in 2011. The following year, {{it was announced that}} Mullen would appear in his second film, A Thousand Times Goodnight, starring Juliette Binoche. On 3 September 2013 the film won Special Grand Prix of the Jury at Montreal World Film Festival.|$|E
5|$|When B {{was first}} founded, the linear {{magnetic}} eddy brake {{had yet to}} be developed, so it used friction brakes as its main braking system. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>train,</b> pads are fitted beneath the seating areas. On the brakes, similar pads are connected to steel supports. When the pads <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> come into contact with the brakes, friction is created which slows the train. Beginning with Kumba in 1993, friction brakes have also been used as trim brakes that regulate the speed of the train while it is still navigating the course.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, one of {{the trains}} was re-themed to endorse Stride Gum. The train was wrapped in Stride Gum advertisements, showing a {{different}} flavor of Stride gum on each car. The advertisements remained <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> for the entire 2011 season, but were removed {{before the start of}} the 2012 season and replaced with Kia Soul advertising.|$|E

However, the Licker is hiding <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> and attacks them, clawing Matt and killing Kaplan. In the ensuing battle, Alice subdues the Licker before Matt is {{attacked}} by a now-zombified Rain. He shoots Rain dead, causing her head to hit a trapdoor button, opening it and dropping the Licker under the train which ultimately kills it for good. At the mansion, Matt's wound begins mutating. Before Alice can give him the anti-virus, the mansion doors burst open {{and a group of}} Umbrella scientists seizes them. They subdue Alice and take Matt away, revealing he is to be put into the Nemesis Program.|$|E

The posse chases them to the Mexican border, only to be foiled again as the robbers blow up a trestle spanning the Rio Grande, dumping the entire posse into the river.

5|$|Bethe {{managed to}} work it out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> from New York to Schenectady. He arrived at a value of 1040MHz, {{extremely}} close to that obtained experimentally by Lamb and Retherford. He did so by realising that it was a non-relativistic process, which greatly simplified the calculations. His paper, published in the Physical Review in August 1947 was only two pages long and contained just 12 mathematical equations, but was enormously influential. Hitherto, it had been assumed that the infinities meant that QED was fundamentally flawed, and that a new, radical theory was required. Bethe demonstrated that this was not necessary.|$|E

Meanwhile, Mulder enters the train and finds that the secret railcar is quarantined and protected by a security system. He searches for Zama, enlisting the train conductor for help. In Zama's compartment, they find hand-written journals in Japanese. However, elsewhere <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>train,</b> the Red-Haired Man intercepts and strangles Zama.|$|E

The girl with Boyd in the dining car scene is Prudence Bury. Phil Collins, within a few years a band member of Genesis, was an uncredited schoolboy extra in the concert audience.|$|E
5|$|Hastings {{eventually}} switched {{sides and}} joined the Labour Party. His conversion, especially {{in the light of}} later events, was regarded by some as suspect: his entry in the Dictionary of Labour Biography reports speculation that Hastings foresaw that Labour may come to Government and had few senior lawyers to fill the Law Officer posts. John Paton, after speaking from the same Independent Labour Party (ILP) platform as Hastings, {{came to the conclusion that}} Hastings gave political speeches using his skill as a lawyer to master a brief; <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> home, Hastings appeared not to have heard of the ILP.|$|E

Boxy two-story brick stations opened at Wedgemere and Winchester Center in 1957. The ticket office in the new station was closed in 1960 after just three years in service; thereafter, passengers bought tickets <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>train.</b> The station building hosted a coffee shop from 2008 to 2014.|$|E

When {{questioned}} by Tommy Gorman about his issue, Gardiner lied to Gorman and insisted it was only a minor headache. However, when Gardiner woke up <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> in the morning, he had trouble seeing, as black spots obscured his vision. This was Gardiner's first uremic convulsion.|$|E
