5|$|As one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>ambitious</b> and {{expensive}} {{projects in the}} history of maritime archaeology, the Mary Rose project broke new ground within this field in the UK. Besides becoming one of the first wrecks to be protected under the new Protection of Wrecks Act in 1973 it also created several new precedents. It {{was the first time that}} a British privately funded project was able to apply modern scientific standards fully and without having to auction off part of the findings to finance its activities; where previous projects often had to settle for just a partial recovery of finds, everything found in connection with the Mary Rose was recovered and recorded. The raising of the vessel made it possible to establish the first historic shipwreck museum in the UK to receive government accreditation and funding. The excavation of the Mary Rose wreck site proved that it was possible to achieve a level of exactness in underwater excavations comparable to those on dry land.|$|E

25|$|Strathclyde Passenger Transport began {{planning}} an extensive modernisation of the Partick station site - which had remained largely unchanged since its opening in 1979 - {{as early as}} 1998. Work began in late 2005 and was originally scheduled for completion in January 2007. However, delays to the project resulted in this date being put back {{on a number of}} occasions. The demolition and construction work was carried out while the site remained open to avoid any disruption in rail and underground services, arguably one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>ambitious</b> attributes of the project.|$|E
25|$|New Orleans' zenith versus other American cities {{occurred}} in the ante-bellum period. It was the nation's fifth-largest city and was significantly larger than all other southern cities. From the mid-19th century onward rapid economic growth shifted to other areas, while New Orleans' relative importance steadily declined. The growth of railways and highways decreased river traffic, diverting goods to other transportation corridors and markets. Thousands <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>ambitious</b> people of color left {{the state in the}} Great Migration around World War II and after, many for West Coast destinations. From the late 1800s, most censuses recorded New Orleans' decline versus other American cities.|$|E

25|$|In {{the middle}} of these polemics, Brandes began to issue volumes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>ambitious</b> of his works, Main Currents in the Literature of the Nineteenth Century, of which four volumes {{appeared}} between 1872 and 1875 (English translation, 1901–1905). The brilliant novelty of this criticism of the literature of major European countries {{at the beginning of}} the 19th century, and his description of the general revolt against the pseudo-classicism of the 18th century, at once attracted attention outside Denmark. The tumult which gathered round the person of the critic increased the success of the work, and the reputation of Brandes grew apace, especially in Germany and Russia.|$|E
25|$|The Thirteenth World Congress, in February 1991, was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>ambitious,</b> {{addressing}} a systematic {{change in the}} global balance of forces. Its resolutions spanned the 'New World Order', European integration, feminism and {{the crisis of the}} Latin American left. The resolutions discussed a fundamental reversal of fortune for the anti-capitalist struggle, reflected by defeats in Central America, the 1989 revolutions in the Eastern Bloc, and the weakening of the workers' movement. The congress rejected a counter-resolution on the world situation from a tendency supported by members of the International Socialist Group and the Revolutionary Communist League: the tendency was supported by six of the 100 delegates to the congress. In the opinion of the tendency, the crisis of imperialism was set to accelerate.|$|E
25|$|The {{mansion in}} the village overlooks Rutland Water. The house in the manner {{associated}} with Sir Christopher Wren, {{was built in the}} 1690s by the 2nd Earl of Nottingham, who was to a large extent his own architect and involved himself in the minutiae of construction, but employed Henry Dormer (died 1727) to supervise its building. Nottingham replaced Dormer with John Lumley in 1697. Before embarking on the project, Lord Nottingham consulted Sir Christopher Wren and had measurements taken at Berkeley House and Montagu House in London. The house, in an H-plan, has a pedimented central block and lightly projecting end pavilions. With its symmetrical wings and outbuildings forming a cour d'honneur, and segmental walling linking matching blocks in a larger outer grassed court, it forms one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>ambitious</b> aristocratic ensembles of the late seventeenth century.|$|E

25|$|In the mid 1840s, {{the charismatic}} nonconformist preacher George Dawson began {{to promote a}} {{doctrine}} of social responsibility and enlightened municipal improvement that {{became known as the}} Civic Gospel. His philosophy inspired a group of reformers – including Joseph Chamberlain, Jesse Collings, George Dixon, and others – who from the late 1860s onwards began to be elected to the Town Council as Liberals, and to apply these ideas in practice. This period reached its peak during the mayoralty of Chamberlain, 1873–1876. Under his leadership, Birmingham was transformed, as the council introduced one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>ambitious</b> improvement schemes outside London. The council purchased the city's gas and water works, and moved to improve the lighting and provide clean drinking water to the city, income from these utilities also provided a healthy income for the council, which was re-invested into the city to provide new amenities.|$|E
25|$|Campbell Island is a sub Antarctic island 700km {{south of}} New Zealand that became infested with rats in the 19th century. Several endemic birds, {{including}} the Campbell teal and Campbell snipe, only survived on small rocky islets {{just off the}} island, and the populations were perilously low. Several teals were taken into captivity for ex-situ conservation, but once they had bred in captivity there was no-where else to return them to until the island was cleared of rats. The DOC's plan to remove rats from the island was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>ambitious</b> attempted, as the island was so remote, the rat populations had the highest density of rats anywhere in the world, the weather treacherous and, at 113km2, {{it was the largest}} island at that point where eradication had been attempted. The poison had to be dropped in the winter, to minimize disturbance to nesting seabirds and reduce the chance of bird strike for the pilots. After several experiments, the eradication began in 2001. In 2003 trackers with dogs were unable to find any rats. Soon after the island was cleared it was possible to return the teals to the island. Snipe have self-reintroduced to the island and have begun breeding.|$|E
25|$|Special {{revitalization}} {{efforts are}} being aimed at Main Street, which began seeing an exodus of department and specialty {{stores in the}} 1990s. The goal is to re-establish Main Street as a vibrant commercial and residential corridor, and the stretch of Main Street home to most businesses—-from Gervais to Blanding streets—-has been streetscaped in recent years. Notable developments completed in recent years along Main Street include an 18-story, $60 million tower at the high-profile corner of Main and Gervais streets, the renovation of the 1441 Main Street office building as the new Midlands headquarters for Wells Fargo Bank (formerly Wachovia Bank), a new sanctuary for the Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church, the location of Mast General store in the historic Efird's building, and the relocation of the Nickelodeon theater. A façade improvement program for the downtown business district, implemented in 2011, {{has resulted in the}} restoration and improvement of the façades of several historic Main Street shopfronts. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>ambitious</b> development projects in the city's history is currently underway which involves old state mental health campus downtown on Bull Street. Known formally as Columbia Common, this project will consist of rehabbing several historic buildings on the campus for residential, hospitality, and retail use. A new minor league baseball stadium was recently built on the campus as well.|$|E
