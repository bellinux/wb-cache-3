5|$|The {{way that}} leads to the abyss for the German people has now come. The party patriots {{continue}} ever to believe and hope. Also, there are still those who do not want to see, and they expect a miracle from the Führer. Those are the kind <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not give up hope even {{at the edge of the}} grave. In all other respects, the number of peace seekers grows from hour to hour. The coming generations, and the foreign countries, will want to understand why the German people themselves did not turn against the party tyranny and stop the Nazi Party leaders by force in order to terminate this horrible war. For this, something should be said to clear up the question.|$|E

It's a demonstration against thoughtlessness and carelessness.|$|E

25|$|Some {{research}} suggests {{that there may be}} a degree of inherited susceptibility to develop sleep bruxism. 21–50% of people with sleep bruxism have a direct family member who had sleep bruxism during childhood, suggesting that there are genetic factors involved, although no genetic markers have yet been identified. Offspring of people who have sleep bruxism are more likely to also have sleep bruxism than children <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not have bruxism, or people with awake bruxism rather than sleep bruxism.|$|E
25|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 2000s, only small groups of militant straight edge individuals remained. Contrary to news reports that portrayed straight edge as a gang, several studies have shown that straight edge individuals as a whole are mostly peaceful people. In the 2000s, there was a growing amount of tolerance <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not follow the straight edge lifestyle by straight edge individuals. In this incarnation of straight edge, the musical styles of the bands involved are more varied, ranging from a youth crew revival style to metalcore to posicore. Straight edge bands from the 2000s include Champion, Down to Nothing, Embrace Today, Have Heart, and Throwdown.|$|E

40|$|I {{argue that}} a policy of presumed consent for cadaveric organ procurement, which assumes that people do want to donate their organs for {{transplantation}} after their death, would be a moral improvement over the current American system, which assumes that {{people do not want}} to donate their organs. I address what I take {{to be the most important}} objection to presumed consent. The objection is that if we implement presumed consent we will end up removing organs from the bodies <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not want their organs removed, and that this situation is morally unacceptable because it violates the principle of respect for autonomy that underlies our concept of informed consent. I argue that while removing organs from the bodies <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not want them removed is unfortunate, it is morally no worse that not removing organs from the bodies <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> want them removed, and that a policy of presumed consent will produce fewer of these unfortunate results than the current system...|$|R

25|$|The HPI (Human Poverty Index) {{is used to}} {{calculate}} the percentage of people in a country who live in relative poverty. In order to better differentiate {{the number of people in}} abnormally poor living conditions the HPI-1 is used in developing countries, and the HPI-2 is used in developed countries. The HPI-1 is calculated based on the percentage of people not expected to survive to 40, the adult illiteracy rate, the percentage of people without access to safe water, health services and the percentage of children under 5 who are underweight. The HPI-2 is calculated based on the percentage <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not survive to 60, the adult functional illiteracy rate and the percentage of people living below 50% of median personal disposable income.|$|E
25|$|All {{statistical}} hypothesis tests have a probability of making type I and type II errors. For example, all blood tests for a disease will falsely detect {{the disease in}} some proportion of people who don't have it, and will fail to detect the disease in some proportion <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> have it. A test's probability of making a type I error is denoted by α. A test's probability of making a type II error is denoted by β. These error rates are traded off against each other: for any given sample set, the effort to reduce one type of error generally results in increasing the other type of error. For a given test, {{the only way to}} reduce both error rates is to increase the sample size, and this may not be feasible.|$|E
25|$|From {{the sociological}} perspective, group {{processes}} scholars study how power, status, justice, and legitimacy impact {{the structure and}} interactions that take place within groups. Group processes scholars study how group size affects the type and quality of interactions that take place between group members, an area of study initiated {{by the work of}} the German social theorist, Georg Simmel. Dyads consist of two people and triads consist of three people, and the fundamental difference is that one person who leaves a dyad dissolves that group whereas the same is not true of a triad. The difference between these two types of groups also indicates the fundamental nature of group size, which is that every additional member of a group increases the group's stability but also decreases the possible amount of intimacy or interactions between any two members. Groups are also distinguished in terms of how and why the members know each other, and this stems from whether they are members of primary groups consisting of close friends and family held together by expressive ties; secondary groups consisting of coworkers, colleagues, classmates, etc. held together by instrumental ties; or reference groups consisting <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not necessarily know or interact with each other but who use each other for standards of comparison for appropriate behaviors. Group processes researchers also study interactions between groups, such {{as in the case of}} Muzafer Sherif's Robbers Cave Experiment.|$|E

500|$|... "Creative evolution", Shaw's {{version of}} the new science of eugenics, became an {{increasing}} theme in his political writing after 1900. He introduced his theories in The Revolutionist's Handbook (1903), an appendix to Man and Superman, and developed them further during the 1920s in Back to Methuselah. A 1946 Life magazine article observed that Shaw had [...] "always tended to look at people more as a biologist than as an artist". By 1933, {{in the preface to}} On the Rocks, he was writing that [...] "if we desire a certain type of civilization and culture we must exterminate the sort <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not fit into it"; critical opinion is divided on whether this was intended as irony. In an article in the American magazine Liberty in September 1938, Shaw included the statement: [...] "There are many {{people in the world who}} ought to be liquidated". Many commentators assumed that such comments were intended as a joke, although in the worst possible taste. Otherwise, Life magazine concluded, [...] "this silliness can be classed with his more innocent bad guesses".|$|E
500|$|We {{disliked the}} English {{language}} in the past. I disliked it because I was forced to learn Shakespeare and Milton, for which I had no taste at all. If {{we are going to}} be compelled to learn Hindi, I would perhaps not be able to learn it because of my age, and perhaps I would not be willing to do it because of the amount of constraint you put on me. This kind of intolerance makes us fear that the strong Centre which we need, a strong Centre which is necessary will also mean the enslavement <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not speak the language at the centre. I would, Sir, convey a warning on behalf of people of the South for the reason that there are already elements in South India who want separation..., and my honourable friends in U.P. do not help us in any way by flogging their idea of [...] "Hindi Imperialism" [...] to the maximum extent possible. So, it is up to my friends in Uttar Pradesh to have a whole India; it is up to them to have a Hindi-India. The choice is theirs.|$|E
500|$|Vincent Canby {{began his}} review {{by calling the}} film [...] "very {{beautiful}} and the first truly interesting American-made Western in years. It's also so full of violence--of an intensity that can hardly be supported by the story—that it's going to prompt a lot <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not know the real effect of movie violence (as I do not) to write automatic condemnations of it." [...] He said, [...] "Although the movie's conventional and poetic action sequences are extraordinarily good and its landscapes beautifully photographed ... {{it is most interesting}} in its almost jolly account of chaos, corruption, and defeat". Among the actors, he commented particularly on William Holden: [...] "After years of giving bored performances in boring movies, Holden comes back gallantly in The Wild Bunch. He looks older and tired, but he has style, both as a man and as a movie character who persists in doing what he's always done, not because he really wants the money but because there's simply nothing else to do." [...] Time also liked Holden's performance, describing it as his best since Stalag 17 (a 1953 film that earned Holden an Oscar); said Robert Ryan gave [...] "the screen performance of his career"; and concluded that [...] "The Wild Bunch contains faults and mistakes" [...] (such as flashbacks [...] "introduced with surprising clumsiness"), but [...] "its accomplishments are more than sufficient to confirm that Peckinpah, along with Stanley Kubrick and Arthur Penn, belongs with the best of the newer generation of American filmmakers." ...|$|E

500|$|Peggy and Frank {{were married}} {{on-screen}} on 1 April 1999. A [...] "hen night" [...] was thrown for Windsor with the show's make-up team, and the BBC threw a [...] "massive" [...] {{party in the}} show's Albert Square to celebrate the event. Actors Windsor and Reid joined fellow stars, celebrities and TV executives for a celebration on the programme's set in Elstree, Hertfordshire. Windsor admitted {{she had been so}} nervous before filming the wedding she was sick on set. She commented, [...] "I broke out in spots and threw up in the vestry. I was very nervous – we were both very nervous. The day you stop getting nervous you can hold your hands up. It shows you care." [...] The soap wedding was filmed in Harrow, North West London in February 1999. A BBC spokesman commented: [...] "It {{is one of the best}} weddings Walford has ever seen but it is not problem free. There are a lot <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not want to see Frank and Peggy married – Grant being one of them – and it remains to be seen whether they will get through the day without a major upset. And as if the wedding is not gripping enough, there are certainly shocking revelations back at the Vic." [...] In the eventual episode, it was actually Grant Mitchell who persuaded his mother to marry Frank – with whom he had been feuding following his accidental killing of wife Tiffany – after Peggy was having second thoughts, thinking that Frank was only marrying her out of pity. Nearly 20 million viewers watched Peggy and Frank marry.|$|E
