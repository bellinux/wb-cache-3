During a commercial break that night, Vince McMahon announced a Gauntlet Bra & Panties Match for New Year's Revolution between all five girls. At the event, Maria {{was the first to}} enter the Gauntlet match and eliminated Michelle and Wilson before being eliminated by Victoria. The match was ultimately won by Massaro.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{with the}} release of WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw, online {{gameplay}} was made available for players who had a Sony Network Adapter and a Sony PlayStation 2. Online gameplay was kept at a minimum, as online players only had two game modes to compete in: one-on-one and a Bra and Panties match, in which a player competes as a WWE Diva and strips the opposition <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>clothes,</b> until she is left with only her undergarments. When WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw 2006 was released, the online gameplay was changed, and players were able to compete in more match types, defend the created championships, and compete with up to four players in each match. With the release of WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008 on the Xbox 360 console (PS3 would not see this feature until WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009), players were able to select music from their system's hard disk drive into the video game, where the music can be used in superstars' ring entrances.. WWE 2K18 adds Road to Glory as a continuation of MyCareer Mode in lieu of being the end part of the game. Backstage brawls and 8 man matches are also added to this feature.|$|E
5|$|Whistler was {{not entirely}} content with the realism the {{painting}} displayed in its original form, a trait he blamed on the influence Courbet had on him at the time. Later, between 1867 and 1872, he reworked it {{to give it a}} more spiritual expression. Even though Symphony was begun before Whistler first met Rossetti, the Pre-Raphaelite influence is still clear. The painting was an early experiment in white on white, with a woman standing in a white dress in front of a white background. This colour scheme was a subject he would return to later, in two paintings that would be given the titles of Symphony in White, No. 2 (1864) and Symphony in White, No. 3 (1865–67). The panel is long and slender, and the model's pose and the shape <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>clothes</b> further emphasise the vertical nature of the painting. The woman is bold, almost confrontational, in her direct gaze at the viewer, and her features are highly individualised. Art critic Hilton Kramer sees in Whistler's portraits a charm and a combination of craft and observational skills that his more radical landscapes lacked.|$|E

25|$|Ten days later, {{he killed}} Helen Rytka, an 18-year-old prostitute from Huddersfield. He struck Rytka {{on the head}} five times as she exited his vehicle, before {{stripping}} many <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>clothes</b> from her body (although her bra and polo-neck jumper were positioned above her breasts), before repeatedly stabbing her in the chest. Her body was found beneath railway arches in the timber-yard {{to which he had}} driven her three days later.|$|E
25|$|Detective novelist Ariadne Oliver is Agatha Christie's humorous self-caricature. Like Christie, she is {{not overly}} fond of the detective whom she is most famous for creating–in Ariadne's case, Finnish sleuth Sven Hjerson. We never learn {{anything}} about her husband, {{but we do know}} that she hates alcohol and public appearances and has a great fondness for apples until she is put off them by the events of Hallowe'en Party. She also has a habit of constantly changing her hairstyle, and in every appearance by her much is made <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>clothes</b> and hats. Her maid Maria prevents the public adoration from becoming too much of a burden on her employer, but does nothing to prevent her from becoming too much of a burden on others.|$|E
25|$|By {{the age of}} 11, Wuornos began {{engaging}} in sexual activities in school in exchange for cigarettes, drugs, and food. She had also engaged in sexual activities with her brother. Wuornos said that her alcoholic grandfather had sexually assaulted and beaten {{her when she was}} a child. Before beating her, he would force her to strip out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>clothes.</b> In 1970, at age 14, she became pregnant, having been raped by an accomplice of her grandfather. Wuornos gave birth to a boy at a home for unwed mothers on March 23, 1971, and the child was placed for adoption. A few months after her son was born, she dropped out of school {{at about the same time}} that her grandmother died of liver failure. When Wuornos was 15, her grandfather threw her out of the house, and she began supporting herself as a sex worker and living in the woods near her old home.|$|E

500|$|For River, mostly jewel tones {{were used}} to set her {{apart from the rest}} of the Serenity crew.

500|$|Kapoor {{auctioned}} some <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>clothes</b> on stylist Pernia Qureshi's online fashion boutique, Pernia's Pop-Up Shop, in 2012. The proceeds were {{donated to}} Smile Foundation, a child-welfare organisation. In 2014, she attended a charitable art exhibition organised by the Rouble Nagi Art Foundation, and donated clothing and accessories to a website raising funds for In Defense of Animals. Kapoor walked the ramp in a 2015 fashion show by Manish Malhotra for the Mijwan Welfare Society, a non-profit organisation dedicated to empowering girls. The same year, she appeared with Hrithik Roshan {{in the music}} video for [...] "Dheere Dheere", whose profits were donated to charity.|$|E
500|$|The {{painting}} {{shows the}} moment from Summer in which Musidora, having removed the last <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>clothes,</b> steps into [...] "the lucid coolness of the flood" [...] to [...] "bathe her fervent limbs in the refreshing stream". Damon is not shown; instead, Etty illustrates {{the scene from}} Damon's viewpoint. By placing the audience in Damon's position, Etty aimed to induce the same reactions in the viewer as Damon's dilemma as described by Thomson; that of whether to enjoy the spectacle despite knowing it to be inappropriate, or to follow the accepted morality {{of the time and}} look away, in what art historian Sarah Burnage has described as [...] "a titillating moral test for spectators to both enjoy and overcome".|$|E

500|$|... "Until It Beats No More" [...] {{was used}} as an {{introduction}} to Lopez's performance at the American Music Awards on November 20, 2011. She wore a golden gown, with the words: [...] "Love... It's a journey and I still have questions" [...] appearing in a screen behind her. Lopez began to break down, appearing as though she was about to cry. She then paused, looked up and shed most <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>clothes</b> for a performance of [...] "Papi". Critics noted the [...] "fake breakdown" [...] to be poking fun at her breakdown during her performance of the song at the Mohegan Sun casino a month earlier. The performance was compared to Britney Spears's music video for [...] "Toxic" [...] and Lopez's performance during the 2001 American Music Awards.|$|E
500|$|Candaules, King of Lydia, Shews his Wife by Stealth to Gyges, One of his Ministers, as She Goes to Bed, {{also known}} as The Imprudence of Candaules, is a [...] oil {{painting}} on canvas by English artist William Etty, first exhibited in 1830. It shows {{a scene from the}} Histories by Herodotus, in which Candaules, king of Lydia, invites his bodyguard Gyges to hide in the couple's bedroom and watch his wife Nyssia undress, to prove to him her beauty. Nyssia notices Gyges spying, and challenges him to either kill himself or Candaules as a punishment; Gyges chooses to kill Candaules and to take his place as king. The painting shows the moment at which Nyssia, at this point unaware that she is being watched by anyone other than her husband, removes the last <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>clothes.</b>|$|E
500|$|... "Russian Roulette" [...] was {{the opening}} song on Rihanna's setlist for her Last Girl on Earth Tour, after the {{presentation}} [...] "Mad House". She performed the song on a movable platform while wearing a floor-length gown covered with red LED lights. Neil McCormick of The Telegraph, {{in a review}} of one of the tour's concerts, said: [...] "She kicked off with the homicidal pop-rock ballad Russian Roulette to screen imagery of burning naked mannequins and had shed most <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>clothes</b> by her second song...". Later the track was excluded from the setlist for the Australian leg of the tour, together with [...] "Rehab", and was replaced with [...] "Only Girl (In the World)" [...] as the tour starter. English singer George Michael covered [...] "Russian Roulette" [...] during his orchestral concert tour, titled the Symphonica Tour (2011—12).|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} her steadfastly. She was dressed in white muslin, and she wore a big black hat without any touch <b>of</b> colour. <b>Her</b> <b>clothes</b> were those which her uncle had ordered in New York. She was slim and dainty and elegant, and he found it hard indeed to keep his heart steeled against her.|$|R
60|$|That wretched woman, meanwhile, {{with her}} rouged cheeks (for rouge it IS, Miss Clapperclaw swears, {{and who is}} a better judge?) has walked on conscious, and yet somehow braving out the Street.

500|$|Guest {{describes}} how {{his mother was}} initially raised in strict Catholicism, but later turned to a tape of Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh after going {{through a period of}} experimenting with sex and drugs. She dyed all <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>clothes</b> orange, took on the name of [...] "Ma Prem Vismaya", and [...] "Yogesh" [...] for her son, and moved to an Rajneesh movement commune near Bombay. Guest's mother moved to many different communes, and had leadership roles within the movement, eventually running a commune in Suffolk. Guest recounts how he regretted the absence of his mother's presence during this time, and describes controversial living conditions with other children at the various ashrams. Guest and his mother moved to the [...] commune in Oregon, but his mother was demoted in position and sent to live at a different commune in Cologne. His family later disassociated from the Rajneesh movement and moved back to North London, where they each encountered difficulties reintegrating back into mainstream society.|$|E
500|$|In 1973 the Walker Art Center curated a major {{exhibition}} of her work, which traveled for two years. In 1975 she designed the chapel of St. Peter's Lutheran Church in midtown Manhattan. When {{asked about her}} role as a Jewish artist creating Christian-themed art, Nevelson stated that her abstract work transcended religious barriers. Also in 1975, she created and installed a large wood sculpture titled Bicentennial Dawn at the new James A. Byrne United States Courthouse in Philadelphia. During the last half of her life, Nevelson solidified her fame and her persona, cultivating a personal style for her [...] "petite yet flamboyant" [...] self that contributed to her legacy: dramatic dresses, scarves and large false eyelashes. When Alice Neel asked Nevelson how she dressed so beautifully, Nevelson replied [...] "Fucking, dear, fucking", in reference to her sexually liberated lifestyle. The designer Arnold Scaasi created many <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>clothes.</b> Nevelson died on April 17, 1988.|$|E
500|$|Tim Guest's mother Anne {{was born}} in 1950 into a Catholic family. She took courses in {{psychology}} at the University of Sheffield. His father was a psychologist on staff at the university. She gave birth to Tim Guest in 1975. [...] Guest's mother {{fell in love with}} another man when Guest was six months old. She became a feminist, studied Ronald David Laing, and experimented with sex and drugs. [...] Guest's mother became a follower of Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh when Guest was a toddler, after listening to a cassette tape of Rajneesh which displayed the cover text [...] "Surrender to me, and I will transform you", and was titled: [...] "Meditation: the art of ecstasy". Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh taught his followers his perspective on chaotic therapy, sexual freedom and mysticism. She brought her son into the movement in 1979. She was given the name of [...] "Ma Prem Vismaya" [...] (Sanskrit: Mother Love Wonder), and dyed all <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>clothes</b> orange.|$|E

500|$|Lead actress Anna Torv later cited two {{scenes in}} [...] "Marionette" [...] {{of which she}} was most proud of during her time on Fringe. The first was Olivia's {{discovery}} that Peter was sleeping with Fauxlivia and her reaction— going through all <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>clothes</b> in disgust; the second related to her comment to Peter that she couldn't [...] "believe that you didn't know it was me." [...] Torv explained, [...] "The reason I love those scenes is because it’s really easy to be great in your own bedroom , {{but when you get}} on set you have so many different obstacles. The scene with Peter and me outside was done at like 1:30 in the morning, in the middle of town, so we had piles of drunk people screaming up and down the street, and massive fire engines and trucks coming through…. We're doing this quiet scene where I have to cry and we're on the clock, but that’s what TV teaches you -– to just go with it very quickly." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the same}} year, Etty painted {{the first version}} of , an {{illustration}} from the poem Summer by James Thomson and arguably Etty's last history painting painted while he still had all his powers. Musidora shows a scene in which the titular character, having removed the last <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>clothes,</b> steps into [...] "the lucid coolness of the flood" [...] to [...] "bathe her fervent limbs in the refreshing stream", unknowing that she is being watched by her suitor Damon. Etty's composition is shown from the viewpoint of Damon; by so doing Etty aimed to induce the same reactions in the viewer as Damon's dilemma as described by Thomson; that of whether to enjoy the spectacle despite knowing it to be inappropriate, or to follow the accepted morality of the time and look away, in what art historian Sarah Burnage has described as [...] "a titillating moral test for spectators to both enjoy and overcome". Musidora met with almost universal acclaim, compared favourably to Titian and Rembrandt, and described by The Critic as [...] "a preeminent work" [...] and [...] "the triumph of the British school".|$|E
500|$|Of Etty's two {{original}} works {{exhibited at}} the RA in 1830, The Storm, inspired by Psalm 22, attracted little interest and was dismissed by The Gentleman's Magazine—typically a staunch supporter of Etty's work—as [...] "a sad failure". The other painting exhibited was Candaules, King of Lydia, Shews his Wife by Stealth to Gyges, One of his Ministers, as She Goes to Bed, which was to prove {{one of the most}} controversial works of Etty's career. Candaules is based on a story from Herodotus in which king Candaules arranges for his servant Gyges to spy on his wife Nyssia undressing without her knowledge. Gyges is discovered and at Nyssia's behest kills Candaules, marries Nyssia and rules the kingdom in his stead. The painting shows the moment at which Nyssia removes the last <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>clothes.</b> By positioning the figures in such a way that none are looking out of the picture, and the viewer is directly behind Nyssia, Etty aimed for the viewer to feel the same sense of voyeurism and intrusion that Gyges would have felt, forced to spy on his master's naked wife against his will and without her knowledge.|$|E
