40|$|Abstract. - Cold atoms from a {{magneto-optic}} trap {{have been used}} as a nonlinear (χ (3)) medium in a nearly resonant cavity. Squeezing in a probe beam passing through the cavity was demonstrated. The measured noise reduction is 40 % for free atoms and 20 % for weakly trapped atoms. Soon after the first implementations of {{magneto-optic trap}}s [1, 2], the strong nonlinear properties of laser cooled atoms were recognized. It was shown that a probe beam going through a cloud of cold atoms could experience gain due to Raman transitions involving the trapping beams [3, 4]. When the atoms were placed in a resonant optical cavity, laser action corresponding to that gain feature was demonstrated [5]. Meanwhile, when cold atoms are driven by a slightly detuned probe laser beam inside an <b>optical</b> cavity, <b>bistability</b> is observed at very low light powers [6].
