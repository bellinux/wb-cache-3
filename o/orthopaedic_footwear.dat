Commonly {{referred to as}} [...] "orthotics" [...] these orthoses provide support for the foot by redistributing ground reaction forces as well as realigning foot joints while standing, walking or running. A great body of information exists within the orthotic literature describing the sciences that {{might be used to}} aid people with foot problems as well as the impact [...] "orthotics" [...] can have on foot, knee, hip, and spine deformities. They are used by everyone from athletes to the elderly to accommodate biomechanical deformities and a variety of soft tissue inflammatory conditions such as plantar fasciitis.

40|$|Objectives: To get {{insight into}} medical {{opinions}} {{about the use of}} <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>footwear</b> and the medical and social factors related to the prescription of <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>footwear</b> by orthopaedists and rehabilitation practitioners. Methods: In this study 85 orthopaedists and 96 rehabilitation practitioners filled out a questionnaire measuring perceived desirability of prescribing <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>footwear</b> in specific medical conditions, the perceived advantages of <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>footwear,</b> the perceived disadvantages of <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>footwear,</b> the attitude to <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>footwear</b> and satisfaction with the co-operation with the pedorthist. Clinicians were asked to estimate their referral rate of <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>footwear.</b> Results: Orthopaedists and rehabilitation practitioners agree that the prescription of <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>footwear</b> should be considered in the case of rheumatoid arthritis, amputation of the foot and diabetic foot and not be considered in the case of sprain and back pain. In the case of hallux valgi, dermatological problems and clavus (severe corn) a reticent prescription policy seems to be the optimal choice. In the other medical conditions studied no unequivocal prescription policy could be derived. Respondents who prescribed <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>footwear</b> more than the median (more than 50 prescriptions per year) were more often rehabilitation practitioner, perceived more advantages of prescription footwear, perceived less disadvantages of prescription footwear and were more satisfied about the co-operation with the pedorthist. Conclusion: In some medical conditions orthopaedists and rehabilitation practitioners agree about the optimal use of <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>footwear.</b> In some other medical conditions orthopaedists and rehabilitation practitioners are divided about the use of <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>footwear.</b> Reported rate of prescription was not related to desirability of prescription, but was related to beliefs such as perceived advantages, perceived disadvantages and satisfactio...|$|E

40|$|In {{people with}} {{diabetes}} mellitus, foot ulcers are a major problem because they {{increase the risk of}} a foot infection and amputation and reduce quality of life. After a foot ulcer has healed, the risk of recurrence is high. Orthopaedic shoes and orthotics are often prescribed to high risk patients and aim to reduce the mechanical pressure on the plantar surface of the foot. <b>Orthopaedic</b> <b>footwear</b> that is modified to reduce pressure is not much more effective in preventing foot ulcer recurrence than <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>footwear</b> that did not undergo such modification, unless the shoes are worn as recommended. In that case, the risk of ulcer recurrence is reduced by 46 %. In patients with a history of ulceration, compliance in wearing orthopaedic shoes at home is low, while these patients walk more inside the house than outside the house.

40|$|Charcot's arthropathy is a {{relative}} uncommon complication of diabetic neuropathy. The aetiology remains poorly understood. According to the neurotraumatic theory, the foot, which has become insensitive through neuropathy, is subjected to extensive (micro) trauma through continuation of use. Ultimately this leads to destruction. According to the neurovascular theory, autonomic neuropathy results in an increased blood flow in the foot with osteopenia consequently resulting due to increased osteoclastic activity and decreased osteoblastic activity. Acute Charcot's arthropathy presents with a red, warm, swollen foot, which is usually not painful and which eventually becomes ulcerated. An insidious development of the condition is also possible. The X-ray of the foot often is normal at presentation, but will later show local osteoporosis, erosions, subluxations or fractures. Technetium scintigraphy will be abnormal from the beginning, while IgG scans are usually normal. The traditional treatment is cast immobilisation with careful introduction of protected weight-bearing.

A clinical trial has been conducted on the Shoemaster (Clarks Shoes) upper design system both to assess its technical capabilities and to consider its role in improvement of service and cosmetic appearance. This particular system works throughout on a three-dimensional representation of the shoe last, which offers particular advantages for integration with shape capture and reproduction. The report concentrates on the technical evaluation to assess (a) its ability to work with unusual last shapes dictated by medical requirements and (b) its potential for integration into a complete computer system for design of both shoe lasts and shoe uppers.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the present work is to improve the comfort, in <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>footwear</b> {{associated}} with orthosis, applying new materials and new finishing. The most important aspects associated with the performance of this type of footwear are taken in consideration, namely, comfort, ergonomics, materials with breathable properties and capability to reduce odours. This desideratum will be reached through the selection and application of advanced materials, such, breathable membranes and fabric finished with anti-fungal and anti-bacteria treatments. In this work, midsole water release parameters were evaluated, as tensile strength, water vapour permeability, resistance of fabric to penetration by water were determined for the hydrophilic membranes. A new lining with breathable membrane and anti-odour finishing has been developed and tested.

This desideratum is reached through the selection and application of advanced materials, such as, breathable membranes and fabric finished with anti-fungal and anti-bacteria treatments. In this study, water vapour permeability was evaluated to determine the water vapour transport property produced by skin transpiration. Furthermore, a new lining with hydrophilic breathable membrane and anti-odour finishing has been developed and tested. Water vapour permeability of the new lining was compared with other conventional materials. From the obtained results, it can be drawn that the application of membranes with weave fabric by lamination decreases the breathability of material.

This procedure starts with full characterization of the problem with the purpose to characterize a plantar of a patient’s foot with polio. A 3 D Scanner was used to collect their feet's data to produce an anatomic insole. After this step, the patient performs a study of his gait using a static and dynamic study with the aim of characterizing the parameters to improve quality in the footwear. The insole was produced using a 3 D printing technology. It was essential to optimize manufacturing processes and it was developed a footwear prototype with innovative characteristics, which is 25 % lighter, allowing the user to consume less energy in daily routines.

40|$|In Europe, bespoke {{orthopaedic}} {{shoes are}} usually sent {{for a trial}} fitting in order to check the fit and indicate any modifications required before final finishing. The use of shell shoes at the fit assessment stage, rather than the traditional alternative of partially or fully finished shoes, can offer service advantages, and is widely used for example in the Netherlands. However the comparability of shell fit assessment with the traditional method of trial shoe fit assessment has not been evaluated, either to assess its sensitivity or to elucidate any difference in assessment technique required of the orthotist. In this work, the results of fit assessments by both methods are compared. The trial involved a group of normal subjects wearing high street shoes of styles {{similar to those used}} for <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>footwear.</b> The results indicate that the shell fit assessments were in the main comparable to those for trial shoe fit. The only consistent area of deviation noted, in the heel at the topline, is attributable to a construction factor in shoe making.

40|$|<b>Orthopaedic</b> <b>footwear</b> {{design has}} {{traditionally}} been a craft process. In service delivery, this poses problems of delays in production and inconsistency in quality of fit, function and cosmetic appearance. Advanced technology, {{in the form of}} techniques for measurement and computer-aided design (CAD) systems, is proposed to solve some of these problems. The thesis examines the clinical needs and analyses the application philosophy of such technology to related medical applications. The limitations of current understanding of technical requirements for plantar stress measurement are probed through experimental work to evaluate the effects of spatial resolution and threshold, and three case studies of interest in shoe insert prescription and design are presented. The design of shoe inserts requires consideration of both interface pressure and shape: a further study evaluates the basic information that is required to simulate aspects of the manual shaping process by a computer algorithm. The design of the shoe upper is another stage of vital importance to both fit and appearance. In the volume trade, CAD systems have been extensively developed: the potential to develop on from this established technology is explored via a trial involving the provision of computer-designed shoes for ten patients. From the above investigations into aspects of footwear design, the stages of the integrated system are identified and considered with regards to their service and technology requirements.

40|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that foot complications are common in people with diabetes, with this being more prominent in less developed countries (Forlee, 2010; Rayman 2004). As a result, there has been an increase in multidisciplinary foot-care teams being set up across the world to advise patients on the proper type of footwear to use or to avoid (Boulton, 2005; Tyrrell, 2009). However, in Africa and other less developed countries, there is still lack of awareness of foot care among patients and health care providers, leading to further foot complications (Abbas, 2007). To resolve this, the International Diabetes Federation and the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (2005) advocate new research so as to collect data on diabetic foot complications and to identify appropriate preventative measures. Previous studies showed that improper footwear is probably the reason for high foot ulceration and amputation among diabetics; and many foot problems could still be potentially averted by wearing appropriate shoes (Caselli, 2011; Vernon, 2007). As a result, the authors argue that proper footwear {{is an essential part of}} rehabilitative care and an important consideration in the clinical management of diabetic foot disorders. The aim of this work is to first explore current medical knowledge and practice concerning the use of <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>footwear</b> to manage diabetic foot problems, particularly in Nigeria. This survey was conducted from August to September 2012, involving three government hospitals at Kaduna State in Nigeria. A framework consisting of participants selection criteria, a Standard Operating Procedure and research ethical consent form was prepared and used as a guide during the survey. Six doctors from the three hospitals were interviewed by means of structured questionnaires and the outcome was analyzed. This approach was used by the authors because of its potential to elicit a wide range of information from the medical experts despite the small sampling. The pilot survey showed that the percentage of diabetic patients suffering from foot problems ranged from 10...|$|E
40|$|Background: Foot pain is {{a common}} problem {{affecting}} up to 1 in 5 adults and is known to adversely affect {{activities of daily living}} and health related quality of life. <b>Orthopaedic</b> <b>footwear</b> interventions are used as a conservative treatment for foot pain, although adherence is known to be low, in part due to the perception of poor comfort and unattractiveness of the footwear. The objective of this trial was to assess the efficacy of flip-flop style footwear (Foot Bio-Tec©) with a moulded foot-bed in reducing foot pain compared to participant's usual footwear. Methods: Two-arm parallel randomised controlled trial using computer generated random allocation schedule at an Australian university podiatry clinic. 108 volunteers with disabling foot pain were enrolled after responding to an advertisement and eligibility screening. Participants were randomly allocated to receive footwear education and moulded flip-flop footwear to wear as much as they were comfortable with for the next 12 weeks (n = 54) or footwear education and instructions to wear their normal footwear for the next 12 weeks (n = 54). Primary outcome was the pain domain of the Foot Health Status Questionnaire (FHSQ). Secondary outcomes were the foot function and general foot health domains of the FHSQ, a visual analogue scale (VAS) for foot pain and perceived comfort of the intervention footwear. Results: Compared to the control group, the moulded flip-flop group showed a significant improvement in the primary outcome measure of the FHSQ pain domain (adjusted mean difference 8. 36 points, 95 % CI 5. 58 to 13. 27, p < 0. 01). Statistical and clinically significant differences were observed for the secondary measure of foot pain assessed by a VAS and the FSHQ domains of foot function and general foot health. None of the participants reported any pain or discomfort from the intervention footwear and six (footwear group = 4) were lost to follow up. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that flip-flop footwear with a moulded foot-bed can {{have a significant effect on}} foot pain, function and foot health and might be a valuable adjunct therapy for people with foot pain...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{is a part}} of CoReNet (Customer-ORiented and Eco-friendly NETworks for healthy fashionable goods), an European 7 th Framework Program project, whose objective is to implement innovative methods and tools to fulfil needs and expectations of specific target groups – elderly, obese, disabled and diabetic people – by improving the supply network structure of the European Textile, Clothing and Footwear Industry (TCFI) to produce small series of functional and fashionable clothes and footwear. This thesis particularly focuses on the footwear sector and analyses how the European fashion footwear companies could reengineer their supply networks {{to address the needs of}} the project target groups. In order to stay competitive, European footwear companies need to enter new markets implementing innovative production methodologies based on networking economy. In fact, footwear sector has become a global industry where competition is planetary and key players are no longer concentrated only in Europe and North America but even in emerging low labour cost countries, because of the combined effects of labour intensity, low entry and exit barriers, and changes in international trade regulations. Moreover, the overall performance of this industry is deeply affected by unpredictable and seasonal demand as well as emerging consumers’ needs in terms of comfort, health and environmental attention. This context forces companies to rethink their strategies. The production of small series of specialized and customized high value added products for the project target groups represents a key opportunity for European Footwear Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs) to foster their competitiveness entering new niche markets. Comparing literature and multiple case studies from the fashion and <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>footwear</b> supply networks, this research aims at highlighting the guidelines for designing an innovative reference model for footwear supply networks. Along this vein the present proposal addresses the design, production and distribution of small series of healthy and fashionable goods for specific target groups, particularly through personalised and comfortable shoes. The reference model aims at supporting collaboration along the whole value chain in the footwear sector to get and manage consumer data to know their needs, involve consumer into design and product configuration phases, exchange consumer data through adequate data models and secure systems, manage the collaboration with suppliers and other partners in order to plan and distribute on time, implement innovative manufacturing tools delivering the product to the final customer, monitoring the quality and sustainability of product...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the use of prostheses, some secondary complications and functional aspects among children who had a congenital leg deficiency or an acquired leg amputation. Rehabilitation physicians were asked to refer children, aged 1 - 18 years, with a leg deficiency or amputation. Mentally retarded children, children who had only had a toe amputated and children within one year after amputation were excluded. A total of 88 children were included; 64 with a congenital deficiency and 24 with an acquired amputation. In 25 of these 88, both legs were affected; 28 children also had an arm deficiency or amputation. A structured interview was held and the Child-HAQ assessed. Five (5) questions from the Child-HAQ, all relating to leg functions, were analysed. All but 7 children had had a prosthesis fitted, most (89 %) using it for almost the entire day. In the children with congenital deficiencies, the first prosthesis had been fitted at an average age of approximately 18 months. Four (4) of the 7 children without prostheses used <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>footwear.</b> The 10 children with congenital deficiencies necessitating prostheses with articulated knees had the first knee of this type fitted at an average age of approximately 37 months. Forty-seven (47) of the 88 children had needed one or more (secondary) operations. In the children with congenital deficiencies, this was usually a conversion procedure, while the children with an acquired amputation had usually been operated on for osseous overgrowth. Twenty (20) of the 88 children experienced or had previously experienced phantom sensations, 5 children phantom pain. Skin problems were common. Most children (95 %) were able to walk, most of them (93 %) more than 100 m and 93 % of the children aged 4 years or over were able to cycle. Most children (94 %) aged 6 years or over were able to don and doff their prostheses independently. Some 90 % of the children aged 4 years or over attended a normal primary or secondary school. Most (93 %) of the children were able to take part in the physical education programme at school, although frequently (47 %) with some degree of difficulty.
