25|$|As {{facilities}} and structures closed, assets {{were transferred to}} the Government of Canada {{under the terms of}} the U.S.-Britain lend-lease program; Newfoundland having become a Canadian province in 1949. In 1973 Naval Air Station Argentia was closed and by 1975 the entire north side of the base was <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>U.S.</b> hands. In 1994 Naval Operating Base Argentia, was officially decommissioned and the site was transferred to the Government of Canada. From 1994 to 2007, Government of Canada carried out a $106 million environmental remediation program at Argentia which included the removal of many building structures, and the clean up, removal or safe containment of various hazardous materials on the land and in the water about the site. Concurrently, by 2001, the site was turned over to a private, not-for-profit organization to manage and lead the redevelopment of Argentia.|$|E
25|$|These {{principles}} of reason, cause and substance, given thus psychologically, {{enable us to}} pass {{beyond the limits of}} the relative and subjective to objective and absolute reality, they enable us, in a word, to pass from psychology, or the science of knowledge, to ontology or the science of being. These laws are inextricably mixed in consciousness with the data of volition and sensation, with free activity and fatal action or impression, and they guide us in rising to a personal being, a self or free cause, and to an impersonal reality, a not-me—nature, the world of force—lying <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> and modifying us. As I refer to myself the act of attention and volition, so I cannot but refer the sensation to some cause, necessarily other than myself, that is, to an external cause, whose existence is as certain for me as my own existence, since the phenomenon which suggests it to me is as certain as the phenomenon which had suggested my reality, and both are given in each other. I thus reach an objective impersonal world of forces which corresponds to the variety of my sensations. The relation of these forces or causes to each other is the order of the universe.|$|E

500|$|After a {{year and}} a half of touring, Rise Against reconvened at the Blasting Room to record their fourth album, The Sufferer & the Witness. The band members were {{dissatisfied}} with Richardson's contributions to Siren Song of the Counter Culture, as he produced a more polished and heavier album than their previous works. As a result, they decided to return to Stevenson and Livermore, whom they felt had accurately captured the punk sound they were going for on Revolutions per Minute. Unlike the stressful recording sessions for Siren Song of the Counter Culture, the band had a much more enjoyable time with The Suffer & the Witness, as they no longer sought the approval of Geffen executives. According to McIlrath: [...] "It went great, the songs just flowed <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> There were really few questions and the song lyrics would just come <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> it went really well and everyone really liked them." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1985, Dale {{was cast}} in the {{continuing}} role of Jim Robinson in the Australian soap opera Neighbours, earning him acclaim across the world, including the United Kingdom. He appeared on the show from the first episode and stayed for eight years before his character was killed off in 1993. He found working on Neighbours [...] "exciting" [...] and it enabled him to provide for his sons, but he noted: [...] "You were a totally replaceable commodity; [...] didn't put any value {{on any of the}} people appearing in the show." [...] He expanded: [...] "I didn't like it there, they were not nice people. When we decided that we hated each other, the company and me, {{one of the things the}} company did was to market everything they could <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> and pay us nothing."

During his onscreen absence, contract negotiations ensued with unknown predictions from the series. On the situation of the soap cutting his contract, Braeden stated during an interview: [...] "When I sign a three-year deal, I'm obligated to fulfill that deal. The producers, however, can come to me after a half-year and say, 'We've changed our minds.' Where in the world of business does this kind of contract exist?

The band returned to Miami in December to complete work on their third studio album.

500|$|The album's {{recording}} sessions {{took place}} from July 1993 to September 1993 at Bad Animals Studio in Seattle, Washington, as according to Cornell [...] "there {{was never a}} decent studio in Seattle and now there's one with a Neve console, so it seemed obvious to use it". Bad Animals' resident engineer Adam Kasper, {{who went on to}} produce Soundgarden's following albums, assisted Beinhorn on the recording process. Soundgarden took the approach of recording one song at a time. The drum and bass parts were recorded first for each song, and then Cornell and Thayil would lay down their parts over top. Cornell said that getting to know Beinhorn contributed to the length of time Soundgarden spent working on the album. The band spent time experimenting with different drum and guitar sounds, as well as utilizing techniques such as layering, resulting in an expansive production sound. Cornell said, [...] "Michael Beinhorn was so into sounds. He was so, almost, anal about it, that it took the piss <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> a lot of the time... By the time you get the sounds that you want to record the song, you're sick and tired of playing it." [...] Beinhorn tried to add many of his preferred musicians to mold the band's sound, in what Billboard described as [...] "weaning the band from brute force, giving it the impetus to invest in a more subtle power". For instance, prior to recording the vocals of [...] "Black Hole Sun", Beinhorn made Cornell listen to Frank Sinatra.|$|E

[...] It's an instrumental, it was a real collaboration and it just kind of came <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> in the studio, real improvised natural music, very simple. I think it's beautiful.

This time we recorded most of the songs live with the whole band and then after one song was done, Warrel would immediately sing on it [...] of saving all of [...] to the very end, which kind of saves his voice in the overall recording process.
