25|$|Aircraft {{are a major}} threat, {{making the}} use of boats against any fleet with air cover very risky. The low height of the radar mast makes it {{difficult}} to acquire and lock onto a target while maintaining a safe distance. As a result, fast attack craft are being replaced for use in naval combat by larger corvettes, which are able to carry radar-guided anti-aircraft missiles for self-defense, and helicopters for <b>over-the-horizon</b> <b>targeting.</b>|$|E
25|$|The frigates will be {{equipped}} with Sikorsky S-70B naval helicopters, an international derivative of the Sikorsky SH-60B Seahawk. MINDEF {{signed a contract with}} Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation in January 2005 to acquire six of these helicopters, which will be organic to the frigates. These naval helicopters are equipped with anti-surface and anti-submarine combat systems, extending the ship’s own surveillance and <b>over-the-horizon</b> <b>targeting</b> and anti-submarine warfare capabilities. The naval helicopters will be raised as a squadron in the Republic of Singapore Air Force and piloted by air force pilots, but the system operators will be from the RSN. Two more S-70B helicopters were ordered in February 2013.|$|E
500|$|The upgrade {{programme}} {{resulted in}} the Sea King AEW fleet being upgraded with a new mission system, Comms, NavAids, JTIDS, Active Noise Reduction and Videographic recording. [...] The Mission System Upgrade (MSU) component (Radar and partial JTIDS integration) was based around the improved Searchwater 2000AEW radar, with an all-new man Machine Interface. [...] This MSU component was later termed [...] "Project Cerberus" [...] by Thales, after successful integration was conducted by Westland and GEC-Marconi. This variant was initially {{referred to as the}} Sea King AEW7, but renamed ASaC7 just before In Service Date. [...] (Airborne Surveillance and Control Mk.7). The main role of the Sea King ASaC7 is detection of low-flying attack aircraft; it also provides interception/attack control and <b>over-the-horizon</b> <b>targeting</b> for surface-launched weapon systems. In comparison to older versions, the new radar enables the ASaC7 to simultaneously track up to 400 targets, instead of an earlier limit of 250 targets. The effectiveness of the AEW7 was greatly increased via the addition of a Link 16 data link, allowing gathered radar information to be analysed and rapidly put to use by multiple allied platforms in range.|$|E
50|$|With their onboard radar {{helicopters}} {{can also}} be used to reconnoitre <b>over-the-horizon</b> <b>targets</b> and, if equipped with anti-ship missiles such as Penguin or Sea Skua, to attack them. The helicopter is also invaluable for search and rescue operation and has largely replaced the use of small boats or the jackstay rig for such duties as transferring personnel, mail and cargo between ships or to shore. With helicopters these tasks can be accomplished faster and less dangerously, and without the need for the frigate to slow down or change course.|$|R

50|$|Its {{future is}} unclear. However, {{it is certain}} that as the navy {{receives}} more attention, the PLANAF will receive newer aircraft and much more funding, as its significant role in projecting power over the sea is becoming evermore realized. A new transport helicopter, the Z-15, may enter naval service by 2015 as a dedicated medium-sized multi-role shipborne helicopter. This would replace the Z-9C and complement the Ka-28 Helix. In early 2006, an article reported a deal between China and Russia, which sees the PLANAF's acquisition of 40 Ka-29 assault transports, 20+ Ka-31 AEW helicopters (mounted with search radar) and up to 20 Be-200 jet amphibians. If the purchase goes ahead, that would represent a major step forward for the PLANAF in terms of capabilities. The Ka-29 may form the first dedicated transport for the marine corps, the Ka-31's powerful radar can serve in <b>over-the-horizon</b> <b>target</b> acquisitions and early warning for Chinese surface ships, and the Be-200 jet amphibian would replace the SH-5 in maritime patrol duties and ASW.|$|R

40|$|An Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) is an unmanned, {{remotely}} controlled, small air vehicle. It has {{an important}} role in antisurface warfare. This implies <b>over-the-horizon</b> detection, classification, <b>targeting</b> and battle damage assessment. To perform these tasks several UAVs are needed to assist or interchange with each other. An important problem is to determine how many UAVs are needed in this respect. The answer depends on the characteristics of the UAV and its mission. The UAV availability problem is very complex and the usual method to solve such a problem is simulation. A disadvantage of simulation is that it can be very time-consuming. Hence it is not very suitable for sensitivity analysis. Moreover, since simulation gives mere approximations and is not very genetic, theoretical insights are hardly gained. In this paper we show how such a complex problem can still be tackled analytically by using a basic model from reliability theory, viz., a 1 -out-of-n system with cold standby, ample repair facility and general life time and repair distribution...|$|R
40|$|High Frequency Surface Wave Radar (HFSWR), {{which is}} {{currently}} applied in <b>over-the-horizon</b> detection of <b>targets</b> and sea states remote sensing, can receive a huge mass of ionospheric echoes, {{making it possible for}} the ionospheric clutter suppression to become a hot spot in research area. In this paper, from another perspective, we take the ionospheric echoes as the signal source rather than clutters, which provides the possibility of extracting information regarding the ionosphere region and explores a new application field for HFSWR. Primarily, pretreatment of threshold segmentation as well as connected region generation is used in the Range-Doppler (R-D) Spectrum to extract the ionospheric echoes. Then, electron density and plasma frequency of field aligned irregularities (FAIs) caused by plasma instabilities in the F region are obtained by the coherent backscattered radar equation. The plasma drift velocity of FAIs can also be estimated from Doppler shift. Ultimately, the effectiveness of inversion is verified by comparing with IRI 2012...|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, the Israeli Navy sought {{to acquire a}} {{purpose-built}} maritime helicopter to bolster its <b>over-the-horizon</b> detection and <b>targeting</b> capabilities. Several helicopter types were evaluated, including the Westland Lynx and SH-60 Seahawk; in 1983, Israel announced {{the selection of the}} HH-65 Dolphin. Seeking a few examples to gain service experience and with limited funding, Israel acquired two used HH-65A developmental test aircraft from the USCG, the first HH-65A pre-production prototype (c/n 6002) and the third prototype (c/n 6005). These were delivered on August 4, 1985 and although owned by the navy, they were operated by the Israeli Air Force. Initially serving as the maritime flight of 124 Squadron at Palmachim, in June 1987 the IAF formed a dedicated maritime squadron,193 Squadron, to which the two Dolphins were assigned. On 16 September 1996 one crashed in the Mediterranean, killing the three crew members on board. The remaining helicopter was retired a year later, replaced by the Eurocopter AS565 Panther. The Dolphins were operated by a crew consisting of an IAF Pilot, and IAF mechanic and an IN maritime support officer. First deployed in USCG colors, they were later given a blue and gray color scheme.|$|R

50|$|The squadron's {{primary mission}} is to employ the {{versatility}} of the MH-60R helicopter to support the battle group commander's objectives, with emphasis on Surface Warfare (SUW) and Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW). Secondary missions include Search and Rescue (SAR), Vertical Replenishment (VERTREP), Medical Evacuation (MEDEVAC), Naval Surface Fire Support (NSFS), and Communications Relay (COMREL). The Saberhawks of HSM-77 fly the newest aircraft in the U.S. Navy fleet, the MH-60R Seahawk helicopter, which elevates tactical maritime mission capability to a new level, far surpassing previous fleet capability. With its state-of-the-art avionics, mission systems, and cockpit, the MH-60R is the world’s most capable Naval helicopter. The aircraft features a glass cockpit and significant mission system improvements over the SH-60B, which give the MH-60R unmatched capability as an airborne multi-mission Naval platform.

5000|$|The key {{threat in}} modern naval combat is the {{airborne}} cruise missile, {{which can be}} delivered from surface, subsurface or airborne platforms. With missile speeds ranging up to Mach 4, engagement time may be only seconds and such missiles can be designed to [...] "skim the sea" [...] mere metres above the sea surface. The key to successful defence was argued to be to destroy the launch platform before it fires, thus removing a number of missile threats at once. This is not always possible so the anti-aircraft warfare (AAW) resources need to be balanced between the outer and inner air battles. Missile tactics are now mostly fire and forget {{in the manner of}} the Harpoon or Exocet or utilize <b>over-the-horizon</b> <b>targeting,</b> such as the Tomahawk or Silkworm. Close-range missile defence in the modern age depends heavily on close-in weapon systems (CIWS) such as the Phalanx or Goalkeeper.|$|E

In previous studies we reported on model-based-measures (MBMs) d igned to link systems performance changes to mission effectiveness, focusing on the capabilities of afloat-command in-formation systems to support <b>over-the-horizon</b> <b>targeting</b> (OTH-T). Using knowledge of the ar-chitectures, the planned information flow changes, the tactical information required for OTH-T, the data collection plans used during the experiments and the ground truth for a posteriori as-sessments, we investigate here the potential gain in OTH-T effectiveness that results from im-provements in sensor-to-shooter information flow and timeliness. This gain may be independent of the particular implementation of system changes but should depend strongly {{on the ability of}} a specific change to deliver timely, precise and appropriate information to the shooter. Changes could depend on independent dedicated asset and systems, as will be investigated in one of the Joint Warrior Interoperability Demonstrations (JWID) planned for 1999. Alternatively they could result from the integration of the sensor-to-shooter concept within the current archi ecture using a modified standard operating procedure (SOP) and appropriate middleware. The current archi-tecture combines the Force Over-the-horizon Track Coordinator (FOTC), the Allied Command Information Exchange System (ACIXS) and the Global Command and Control System (GCCS).
