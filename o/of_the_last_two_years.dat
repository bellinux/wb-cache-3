5|$|The {{work done}} on the film to date was nearly lost in 1998 {{when one of the}} animators, while {{routinely}} clearing some files, accidentally started a deletion of the root folder of the Toy Story 2 assets on Pixar's internal servers. Associate technical director Oren Jacobs {{was one of the first}} to notice as character models disappeared from their works in progress. They shut down the file servers but had lost 90% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> of work, and the backups were found to have failed some time previously. The film was saved when technical director Galyn Susman, who had been working from home to take care of her newborn child, revealed she had backups of the assets on her home computer. The Pixar team was able to recover nearly all of the lost assets save for a few recent days of work, allowing the film to proceed.|$|E

25|$|Over {{the course}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>years,</b> Magellus had {{acquired}} {{large tracts of}} uncleared land from the Samnites which, although they were technically public land, he was treating as his own. Instead of immediately going to join Gurges, who was besieging Cominium, he used some 2,000 of his soldiers to begin clearing the land, which he had them do for some considerable time, before moving to finally join Gurges. According to Dionysius of Halicarnassus, a jealous Megellus prevented Gurges from taking the Samnite stronghold of Cominium. Approaching the town, Megellus wrote to Gurges, ordering him to withdraw from Samnium. Gurges declined, declaring his command {{had been given to}} him by the Senate, and wrote to Rome, asking the Senate to confirm his command. The Senate sent a delegation of senators to Megellus, stating that he was not to countermand the Senate’s decree. He responded to the deputation that, {{as long as he was}} the duly elected consul of Rome, it was up to him to command the Senate, not for the Senate to dictate to him how he was to go about his duties. He then marched on to Cominium, and forced Gurges to stand down from his command. Gurges had no choice but to obey, and Megellus, having taken command of both armies, immediately sent Gurges back to Rome. Cominium quickly fell, and he followed this up with a campaign against the Hirpini, followed by the capture of Venusia.|$|E

2500|$|As he {{had been}} in his two seasons with , Haussler was active in the Tour of Qatar in February. After {{finishing}} second to Tom Boonen in stage 1, Haussler won stage 2, outkicking Daniele Bennati at the finish, and moved within one second of Boonen in the overall classification. Though he had won the event's points classification in each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>years,</b> this was Haussler's first ever stage win at the Tour of Qatar. In stage 3, Boonen flatted at a critical moment when the peloton was at its top speed and lost three minutes, leaving the top of the overall standings wide open. Haussler picked up a second consecutive stage win in Mesaieed, and in so doing he also moved into the overall race leadership. He credited the win to the team treating the third stage like a one-day classic, while also mentioning that 's Bernhard Eisel performed an effective leadout for all the sprinters at the finish. Haussler lost the overall lead in stage 4, as 's Mark Renshaw took the stage win and opened a six-second gap with his time bonus at the finish. Haussler was a distant ninth in the event's final stage, meaning the bonus time on offer went wanting and he finished second overall, though winning the points classification for the third year in a row. Similarly continuing 's legacy, the squad won the teams classification as their antecedents also had in each of the previous two editions. Haussler stated that he was pleasantly surprised by his early-season form and hoped it would portend for Milan–San Remo and the Tour of Flanders. At Paris–Nice in March, Haussler won the points classification without winning any stage. He had stage finishes in every position from second through fifth, however. At the concurrent Tirreno–Adriatico, Farrar won the first road race stage after an effective leadout from Hushovd. The next stage was also flat, and Hushovd again performed a leadout that was strong in form, but it was perhaps too strong this time. The world champion opened up a slight gap on Farrar in the final kilometer, and left him to sprint for the line from [...] out. Farrar lost out at the last moment to 's Juan José Haedo.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the turmoil}} of 1982, Renault de México took over VAM from the Mexican {{government}} in February 1983. As with AMC, Renault was most interested in the Jeep line, VAM's production facilities, and its established dealer network. As soon as the agreement was finalized, Renault ordered the termination of VAM's passenger car line so it would not compete with its own products. VAM's 1983 models existed mainly to use up the highest possible amount of existing inventories as well as fulfilling previous agreements with sourcing companies. The American line for 1983 soldiered on in a very limited form. The American GFS and American ECD models were virtually not produced for the final year. Both sedan models existed as the base manual and semi-equipped automatics units. Cars with manual transmissions had a parcel shelf as standard equipment while the units with automatic transmission featured aluminum road wheels, the same door panels and seat designs as the previous GFS and ECD models along with their respective door armrest safety reflectors. The two-door automatic models had a reclining mechanism for their front seats. Regardless of the transmission, standard equipment included power brakes, power steering, and dual remote mirrors. The American DL station wagon model was virtually the only high-trim American model to be available. For 1983, the base automatic and the basic DL were merged into a single version alongside the equipped DL and the base manual, creating three versions for the year unlike the four <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>years.</b> The mid-range version had the same equipment as the sedan models with automatic transmission of the year, it was also called [...] "American DL" [...] and carried the same woodgrain panels and moldings that were never seen in the base automatics of the previous two years. The differences between the mid-range DL and the top-of-the-line DL are {{the presence of the}} AM/FM stereo radio, reading dome light, lighted vanity mirror, intermittent wipers and air conditioning in the latter model. The only optional accessories available were the AM/FM stereo tape player radio, remote-controlled door mirrors and electric antenna. Only the top-of-the-line DL carried the [...] I6 while the rest had the [...] Cars equipped with air conditioning included the larger 282 engine. Leftover 1983 VAM Americans were sold as 1984 models.|$|E
