25|$|UDDTs {{have also}} been commercially {{produced}} in Sweden since the mid-1990s. For example, between 1994 and 2010 the Separett company sold approximately 200,000 UDDTs. Numerous <b>off-the</b> <b>shelf</b> commercial products are now available and are used in locations where a connection to a sanitary sewer system is not possible, permitted or desired such as in remote summer cottages or for camping activities. At all times, users {{have also been}} building their own low-cost UDDTs with simple materials such as a funnel connected to a hose, a bucket and a seat.|$|E

50|$|Salary surveys: Semco asks their {{factory and}} office workers to visit {{comparable}} manufacturing companies and interview their counterparts. Thus, no one distrusts the surveys {{and there is}} no need for <b>off-the</b> <b>shelf</b> surveys, ultimately creating more trust in the process and findings. The ultimate goal is to have all employees set their own salary.|$|E
50|$|The {{software}} used by Character TDs {{may vary}} widely from studio to studio, from <b>off-the</b> <b>shelf</b> tools to proprietary in-house systems. Autodesk Maya is used predominantly throughout the VFX and Animation industry, with Softimage also having a large user-base.

5000|$|The Skeeto was {{initially}} {{intended to be}} an affordable light aircraft that could be built complete for under $500 in 1957. The fuselage was welded steel tubing, with mostly fabric covered wood construction for the wings and control surfaces. The engine for this kit venture was to be an low cost <b>off-the</b> <b>shelf</b> model.|$|E
50|$|Breast {{prostheses}} are breast forms {{intended to}} simulate breasts. There {{are a number}} of materials and designs; although, the most common construction is silicone gel in a plastic skin. <b>Off-the</b> <b>shelf</b> breast prostheses come in a range of shapes and sizes, while customised breast prostheses are moulded to fit an individual's chest by taking an impression of both breasts and sculpting a mirror image. Pals Breast Forms consist of a non silicone gel which can be trimmed to fit with scissors, then sent back for customization. Fabrication of customised prostheses is typically done by an anaplastologist who makes somato prostheses. The areola and nipple may be replicated by being moulded into the breast form or a separate nipple prosthesis may be attached to the breast prosthesis. Both custom made and <b>off-the</b> <b>shelf</b> breast prostheses come in varieties that are designed to either be held in a pocket in a specially designed mastectomy bra or attached to the skin and worn with a standard bra.|$|E
5000|$|The {{monitors}} had a box-like hull, {{with very}} bluff bow and stern, and were fitted with anti-torpedo bulges. In order to speed construction, {{it was intended}} to use <b>off-the</b> <b>shelf</b> merchant ship engines, giving about , which were expected to drive the ships to 10 kn. The rushed design, however, meant that the ships were much slower than expected — Raglans engines gave [...] but the ship could only reach 6+1/2 kn.|$|E
50|$|The {{decision}} {{to design the}} PC to use any old <b>off-the</b> <b>shelf</b> cassette tape recorder made the load and save speeds slow. The {{need to keep the}} end-user cost down dictated the need for extra complexity to output a TV signal capable of working with a domestic TV. When TI finally did put the 99/4 onto the European market a few months later, it was initially sold only in a pair with an American NTSC TV because it could not drive European PAL and SECAM sets.|$|E
50|$|The most {{commonly}} encountered full-sphere systems are cubes or rectangular cuboids. The same localisation trade-offs apply as for square vs. rectangle (see above).Cuboids are easily fit into standard rooms and provide precise localisation in first {{order for a}} single listener plus enjoyable envelopment {{for one or two}} more, and they can be built using <b>off-the</b> <b>shelf</b> 7.1 components.If all speakers are placed in room corners, their acoustic loading and resulting bass boost will be uniform, which means they can all be equalised in the same way.|$|E

50|$|Although petro-hydraulic hybrid {{technology}} {{has been known for}} decades, and used in trains and very large construction vehicles, high costs of the equipment precluded the systems from lighter trucks and cars. In the modern sense an experiment proved the viability of small petro-hydraulic hybrid road vehicles in 1978. A group of students at Minneapolis, Minnesota's Hennepin Vocational Technical Center, converted a Volkswagen Beetle car to run as a petro-hydraulic hybrid using <b>off-the</b> <b>shelf</b> components. A car rated at 32 mpg was returning 75 mpg with the 60 hp engine replaced by a 16 hp engine. The experimental car reached 70 mph.|$|E
50|$|Electronic Yellow Pages or Online Yellow Pages use {{software}} to quickly edit and change online content for display on the internet. Printed Yellow Pages or business directories often discontinue publication to limit printing costs and instead publish {{directly to the}} internet as a web directory. Online yellow pages or directories continue publishing online because advertisers pay for the visual exposure from those who read or use these online publications on the internet. Publishers or people that create these online directories create software with their own resources or use opensource or <b>Off-the</b> <b>shelf</b> {{software to}} build their website or online directory. Banana Pages was an online directory function built with their own resources. The cost of online yellow pages or online directory software is limited compared to the large cost of physical printing and distribution of a phone book or directory of information.|$|E
50|$|The {{design and}} {{development}} process for these systems tends {{to fall into}} one of two categories. In the first case, these systems are developed on an adhoc basis rather than as part of a formal project and are not tested, documented or secured with the same rigor as more formally engineered reporting solutions. This makes them comparatively quick and cheap to develop, but unsuitable in most cases for long term use. In the second case, the systems are developed by experienced software developers that {{are not part of the}} organizations's information systems department. These systems may be off-the-shelf software products or custom solutions developed by contract programmers. FinLab and IT Works are examples of companies that produce <b>off-the</b> <b>shelf</b> shadow systems. Depending on the expertise of the developers, these solutions may exceed the reliability of those created by the organizations's information systems department.|$|E

A car rated at 32 mpg was returning 75 mpg with the 60 hp engine {{replaced by a}} 16 hp engine, and reached 70 mph.In the 1990s, engineers at EPA’s National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory developed a petro-hydraulic powertrain for a typical American sedan car. The test car achieved over 80 mpg on combined EPA city/highway driving cycles. Acceleration was 0-60 mph in 8 seconds, using a 1.9 liter diesel engine. No lightweight materials were used. The EPA estimated that produced in high volumes the hydraulic components would add only $700 to the cost. Under EPA testing, a hydraulic hybrid Ford Expedition returned 32 mpg (7.4 L/100 km) City, and 22 mpg (11 L/100 km) highway. UPS currently has two trucks in service using this technology.|$|E

30|$|The {{final design}} was entirely made from <b>off-the</b> <b>shelf</b> parts that are {{available}} to any consumer, and are usually already owned by institutions that display paintings. The main components are two cameras and a projector. The cameras we had used were borrowed, while for the software we made use of multiple open-source libraries. Therefore, our costs for this project were around € 800 because we already owned two camera sets and a projector. We have tested multiple NIKON and CANON models and lens combinations with our system and all of them worked with our software.|$|E

In this work, we apply the above mentioned filter for tracking the mouth of a speaker under adverse conditions, i. e. in a shaky car environment, with <b>off-the</b> <b>shelf</b> camera equipment and severe compression artifacts. A Viola-Jones based detector identifies possible locations, which are then treated as multiple observations in a Bayesian filtering framework. I...|$|E

While acoustic signatures are distinct, {{they can also be}} highly variable, even for an individual target, making detection and tracking a challenging problem. This thesis presents a low-cost acoustic array using commercial <b>off-the</b> <b>shelf</b> (COTS) hardware to detect and track multiple small, moving, acoustic targets. It implements a cross-correlation method for calibration, delay-and-sum beamforming, CA-CFAR detection, a discrete Kalman filter for tracking, and nearest neighbor data association.
