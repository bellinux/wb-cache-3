Evidence is provided {{from a new}} dataset on 178 inputs gathered from UK engineering firms. The probability <b>of</b> <b>buying-in</b> specialised inputs is higher if the production technology is non-specific, but only if there are economies of scale or scope. Furthermore, the economies of scale/scope effect is much reduced {{in the presence of}} specific assets. This interactive hypothesis has not been formally tested before. We also believe this to be the first cross-section empirical test of transaction cost make-or-buy theory using European data. © 1995...|$|R
40|$|Mišúnová, M., Development {{and economy}} of {{renewable}} energy sources in Slovakia on example of landfill gas. Bachelor thesis. Brno: 2014. This bachelor thesis analyzes development {{of renewable energy}} sources in Slovakia with focus on the utilization of landfill gas. It generally explains what the renewables are, which types are nowadays being used for the electricity production. It closely specifies the landfill gas, its creation, physical and chemical properties, composition, production and utilization for energy purposes. Moreover it characterizes the legislation of The European Union as well as Slovak one. The next part defines the problems and barriers that accrue from the development of renewables in Slovakia. The last analytical part expresses the criticism of constant changes in legislation (mostly in regulation <b>of</b> <b>buying-in</b> prices and fees) before and especially after the year 2009 which results in significant decrease of the available renewable energy sources utilization and their farther development (predominantly {{from the viewpoint of}} economic profitability) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{algebraic}} notion <b>of</b> <b>openings</b> <b>of</b> a map-germ {{is introduced}} in this paper. An opening separates the self-intersections {{of the original}} map-germ, preserving its singularities. The notion <b>of</b> <b>openings</b> {{is different from the}} notion <b>of</b> unfoldings. <b>Openings</b> do not unfold the singularities. For example, the swallowtail is an <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> the Whitney’s cusp map-germ from plane to plane and the open swallowtail is a versal <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> them. <b>Openings</b> <b>of</b> map-germs appear as typical singularities in several problems of geometry and its applications. The notion <b>of</b> <b>openings</b> has close relations to isotropic map-germs in a symplectic space and integral map-germs in a contact space. We describe the <b>openings</b> <b>of</b> Morin singularities, namely, stable unfoldings of map-germs of corank one. The relation <b>of</b> unfoldings and <b>openings</b> are discussed. Moreover we provide a method to construct versal <b>openings</b> <b>of</b> map-germs and give versal <b>openings</b> <b>of</b> stable map-germs (R 4, 0) ! (R 4, 0). Lastly the relation of lowerable vector fields and openings is discussed. ...|$|R
