5|$|During {{his tenure}} as {{a teacher at the}} ICY, White closely collaborated with Octavius Catto, an {{important}} civil rights activist and long-time friend of White's who shared a similar social group and views on education. Both men, former cricket players at the ICY, believed baseball was another outlet for African Americans to promote social reform and prove their right for full citizenship. In the spring of 1866, White and Catto established the Philadelphia Pythians, a baseball club composed mainly of men from the Knights of Pythias fraternal organization. Catto, a hard-hitting shortstop and second baseman, was the de facto captain on the field, while White became the team's secretary, responsible for scheduling games, arranging festivities, and recording statistics. Soon, Pythian games became a popular fixture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>community.</b>|$|E
5|$|The 1970s, however, {{witnessed}} {{the publication of}} revisionist studies that departed from the traditional historiography of slavery. Focusing on {{the perspective of the}} slave, new studies incorporated the slave narratives and WPA interviews: George Rawick's From Sunup to Sundown: The Making <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> <b>Community</b> (1972), Eugene D. Genovese's Roll, Jordan, Roll: The World the Slaves Made (1974), Peter H.

Gutman's The Black Family in Slavery and Freedom, 1750–1925 (1976), and Lawrence W. Levine's Black Culture and Black Consciousness: Afro-American Folk Thought from Slavery to Freedom (1977). One of the more controversial of these studies was John W. Blassingame's The Slave Community.|$|E

The preferential treatment was reported to include biased actions by law enforcement and allocations of government resources amongst others. Furthermore, many members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>community</b> were concerned about the expansion of Jews moving into the neighborhood, believing the latter were buying all of the property.|$|E

25|$|Up {{until the}} 1950s, Southern Rhodesia had a vibrant {{political}} life with {{right and left}} wing parties competing for power.

25|$|Around this time, she {{was criticized}} by members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>community</b> for the roles she {{accepted}} and for pursuing roles aggressively rather than rocking the Hollywood boat.

As <b>the</b> embodiment <b>of</b> subversion, she becomes the “village witch”, <b>the</b> symbolic expression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> African community’s confrontation with evil. In fact, through Sula, Morrison refl ects intensively on evil. The demonic female {{comes to be}} a scapegoat, <b>the</b> target <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>community’s</b> social frustrations. Sula is a modern Dark Lady with a radical power of self-creation and self-affi rmation...|$|R
25|$|The {{wearing of}} blackface {{was once a}} regular part of the annual Mummers Parade in Philadelphia. Growing dissent from civil rights groups and the offense <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>community</b> led to a 1964 city policy, ruling out blackface. Despite the ban on blackface, brownface was still used in the parade in 2016 to depict Mexicans, causing outrage once again among civil rights groups. Also in 1964, bowing to {{pressure}} from the interracial group Concern, teenagers in Norfolk, Connecticut, reluctantly agreed to discontinue using blackface in their traditional minstrel show that was a fund-raiser for the March of Dimes.|$|E
25|$|Finding {{that other}} black congregations {{in the region}} were also seeking {{independence}} from white control, in 1816 Allen organized a new denomination, the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the first fully independent black denomination. He was elected its first bishop in 1816. While he and Jones led different denominations, they continued to work closely together and with the black community in Philadelphia. Soon thereafter, Allen. Jones, and others began soliciting funds, again {{with the help of}} Rush. Their appeals met with resistance from white church leaders, many of whom had been supportive <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>community,</b> but disapproved of a separate black church.|$|E
25|$|Massey and Denton {{propose that}} the {{fundamental}} cause of poverty among African Americans is segregation. This segregation has created the inner city black urban ghettos that create poverty traps and keep blacks {{from being able to}} escape the underclass. It is sometimes claimed that these neighborhoods have institutionalized an inner city black culture that is negatively stigmatized and purports the economic situation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>community.</b> Sociolinguist, William Labov argues that persistent segregation supports the use of African American English (AAE) while endangering its speakers. Although AAE is stigmatized, sociolinguists who study it note that it is a legitimate dialect of English as systematic as any other. Arthur Spears argues that there is no inherent educational disadvantage in speaking AAE and that it exists in vernacular and more standard forms.|$|E
