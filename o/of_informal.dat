Yet Johnson's business was never large; he usually had only one assistant and never took on an apprentice. Only {{in the last years of}} his life did two relatives assist him.|$|E
5|$|From {{the overall}} stock of an {{estimated}} 458 million workers, 394million (86%) operate in the unorganised sector (of which 63% are self-employed) mostly as informal workers. There is a strong relationship between the quality of employment and social and poverty characteristics. The relative growth <b>of</b> <b>informal</b> employment was more rapid within the organised rather than the unorganised sector. This informalisation is also related to the flexibilisation of employment in the organised sector that {{is suggested by the}} increasing use of contract labour by employers in order to benefit from more flexible labour practices.|$|E

The thesis is trying to find a place <b>of</b> political <b>informals</b> within the Soviet society and within perestrojka as well as it is trying to portray informals as a pluralist element in the Soviet society, as a beginning of multipartism, as an alternative structure to official state organizations and as a strong politization and radicalization factor for masses of Soviet citizens. First part of the thesis is dedicated to the theoretical part of the problem and so it concentrates on basic characteristics <b>of</b> <b>informals,</b> its variety, ideological and social differences.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the {{determinants of}} the size <b>of</b> the <b>informal</b> economy using cross-country regressions. Two sets of global data using indirect estimation techniques {{and the perception of}} business leaders for 109 countries as well as a regional set for Latin America based on direct data are used to estimate the size <b>of</b> the <b>informal</b> economies. Indirect estimation techniques arrive at higher estimates of the size <b>of</b> the <b>informal</b> economy than the perceptions of business leaders because they include not only the (fundamentally legal) activities <b>of</b> the <b>informal</b> sector, but also those activities which are illegal per se. Both kinds of estimate show strong regional differences in the size <b>of</b> the <b>informal</b> economies. Regressions on a set of indicators covering the intensity of regulations, taxes and the cost of establishing a business reveal that the intensity of labour regulations seems {{to be the most important}} factor in explaining the size <b>of</b> the <b>informal</b> economy in cross-country regressions using the rational behaviour approach. Socio-cultural indicators are only important in explaining the size <b>of</b> the <b>informal</b> economies in Latin America. Government efficiency is an important factor in explaining the size <b>of</b> the <b>informal</b> economy in world regressions. Regional regressions reveal that different aspects of governance dominate the relationship between government efficiency and the size <b>of</b> the <b>informal</b> economy in the different regions. Governments that seek to limit or decrease the size <b>of</b> the <b>informal</b> economy must therefore start from a country-specific analysis of the reasons why economic agents choose to conduct their business in the informal sector. informal sector, tax evasion, business regulation, Political Economy, O 17, H 26,...|$|R
5|$|In {{countries}} where {{women have to}} do paid work in order to feed their family, {{there is a lack}} of regulation and safety standards regarding female workers due to the large amount <b>of</b> <b>informal</b> work available. In Thailand for example, due to the severe economic crisis in 1997, many women have jobs in the informal industry, and often do home-based work so that they can do their domestic jobs concurrently with their paid jobs. This increases the work intensity by women doing more than one job at a time, and has been shown to have deteriorating effects on women's health.|$|E

Cotillo’s 1921 banking reform bill, which placed express companies and steamship agencies that transferred money abroad {{under the supervision of}} the New York State Banking Department, annoyed powerful interests of such companies as Wells Fargo and the Cunard Lines. He received death threats and offers of bribes to drop the legislation he had introduced in the Senate. During the hearings on Cotillo’s bill in March 1921, a devastating crash of the Tisbo Brothers immigrant bank in lower Manhattan left 2,000 angry depositors with losses of more than three million dollars. As a result, four bills that regulated the sector were signed into law on May 1, 1921.|$|E
5|$|Cohesion between {{sentences}} is achieved {{through the use}} of deictic pronouns as anaphora (e.g. that is exactly what I mean where that refers to some fact known to both interlocutors, or then used to locate the time of a narrated event relative to the time of a previously narrated event). Discourse markers such as oh, so or well, also signal the progression of ideas between sentences and help to create cohesion. Discourse markers are often the first constituents in sentences. Discourse markers are also used for stance taking in which speakers position themselves in a specific attitude towards what is being said, for example, no way is that true! (the idiomatic marker no way! expressing disbelief), or boy! I'm hungry (the marker boy expressing emphasis). While discourse markers are particularly characteristic <b>of</b> <b>informal</b> and spoken registers of English, they are also used in written and formal registers.|$|E

The aircraft were distributed in small numbers to fighter aviation regiments based in the USSR, Poland, Romania, Hungary, and Manchuria for use as conversion trainers.

5|$|Gossip {{was also}} a noted writer. His {{treatise}} The Chess-Player's Manual—A Complete Guide to Chess, a 900-page tome published in 1874 {{after several years of}} work, was harshly received by the critics, largely because he had included a number <b>of</b> <b>informal</b> skittles games that he had (atypically) won against stronger players. As a result, Gossip developed a lifelong enmity toward chess critics, whom he often attacked ferociously in his books. However, his 1879 book Theory of the Chess Openings was well received. Wilhelm Steinitz, the first World Chess Champion, wrote that the 1888 edition of The Chess-Player's Manual {{was one of the best}} available books on the game. Thanks in part to a 122-page appendix by S. Lipschütz, it became one of the standard opening works of the time.|$|E
