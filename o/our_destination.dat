Barlett commented to the Gleaner, [...] "We {{just have to say}} that care has to be taken by all, including our creative artists, in portraying images of <b>our</b> <b>destination</b> and people, Gun culture, while not unique to Jamaica, is not enhancing [...] ". Mavado's manager defended the video, stating, [...] "The concept that they came up with, where did they come up with that? If Mavado did not do it, another Jamaican actor would have done it.

The Gaza coastal area and Gaza Harbour are closed to all maritime traffic. The Israeli government supports delivery of humanitarian supplies to the civilian population in Gaza Strip and invites you to enter Ashdod port.
