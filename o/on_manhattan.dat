5|$|On September 15, 1776, British forces under Howe landed <b>on</b> <b>Manhattan.</b> The next morning, some British troops marched toward Harlem, {{where the}} two armies clashed again, while others marched into the city.|$|E
5|$|The battle delayed British {{movements}} {{long enough}} for Washington to move the main army to White Plains and avoid being surrounded <b>on</b> <b>Manhattan.</b> After losing to the British in a battle at White Plains, and losing Fort Washington, Washington retreated across New Jersey to Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|There {{was little}} {{fighting}} for the next month of the campaign, but Washington moved his army to White Plains in October after hearing that the British were attempting to trap him <b>on</b> <b>Manhattan.</b> After being defeated at the Battle of White Plains and later at Fort Washington, Washington and his army retreated across New Jersey, pursued by the British, into Pennsylvania.|$|E

5|$|A {{permanent}} European {{presence in}} New Netherland began in 1624 with {{the founding of}} a Dutch fur trading settlement on Governors Island. In 1625, construction was started on the citadel of Fort Amsterdam <b>on</b> <b>Manhattan</b> Island, later called New Amsterdam (Nieuw Amsterdam), {{in what is now}} Lower Manhattan. The 1625 establishment of Fort Amsterdam at the southern tip of Manhattan Island is recognized as the birth of New York City.|$|E
5|$|Brigadier General Samuel Holden Parsons and Colonel Atlee were {{stationed}} farther {{north on the}} Gowanus Road. Parsons was a lawyer from Connecticut who had recently secured a commission in the Continental Army; Atlee was {{a veteran of the}} French and Indian War in command of the First Regiment of Pennsylvania Musketry. Putnam had been awakened by a guard at 03:00 and told that the British were attacking through the Gowanus Pass. He lit signals to Washington, who was <b>on</b> <b>Manhattan,</b> and then rode south to warn Stirling of the attack.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, British ships {{continued}} to arrive. On August 1, 45 ships arrived with generals Henry Clinton and Charles Cornwallis, along with 3,000 troops. By August 12, 3,000 more British troops and another 8,000 Hessians had arrived. At this point, the British fleet numbered over 400 ships, including 73 war ships, and 32,000 troops were camped on Staten Island. Faced with this large force, Washington was unsure {{as to where}} the British would attack. Both Greene and Reed thought that the British would attack Long Island, but Washington felt that a British attack on Long Island might be a diversion for the main attack <b>on</b> <b>Manhattan.</b> He broke his army in half, stationing half of it <b>on</b> <b>Manhattan,</b> {{and the other half}} on Long Island; the army on Long Island was commanded by Greene. On August 20, Greene became ill and was forced to move to a house in Manhattan where he rested to recover. John Sullivan was placed in command until Greene was well enough to resume command.|$|E

5|$|The next day, September 16, {{there was}} further {{fighting}} when {{a clash of}} outposts escalated into a running battle below Washington's lines on Harlem Heights. After several hours exchange of musketry, the forces engaged returned to their start lines, and {{the position of the}} two armies <b>on</b> <b>Manhattan</b> remained relatively unchanged for the next two months. Having held their own against picked British troops, the American army received a much needed boost to their morale after the debâcle of the previous day, while the British acquired a renewed respect for the American ability to stand and fight.|$|E
5|$|With the British advance delayed, {{the main}} American army under Washington {{was able to}} safely {{evacuate}} from Harlem (on the island of Manhattan) to White Plains. Howe slowly moved his army through New Rochelle and Scarsdale. On October 28, he sent 13,000 men to attack the Americans, resulting in a minor victory over Washington at the Battle of White Plains. Fort Washington, the last American stronghold <b>on</b> <b>Manhattan,</b> fell on November 16. With these defeats, Washington and his army retreated across New Jersey and into Pennsylvania, {{paving the way for}} the Battles of Trenton and Princeton.|$|E
5|$|Many wars were fought {{during the}} 17th century between the slave trading {{companies}} for {{areas that were}} economically dependent on slaves. The West India Company gained many slaves through these wars (specifically with Portugal) by captains who had captured enemy ships; between 1623 and 1637, 2,336 were captured and sold in the New World by the West India Company. The selling of slaves to the New World opened up trading posts in North America; the Dutch opened their first <b>on</b> <b>Manhattan</b> Island in 1613. The West India Company had also opened a trading post in the Caribbean and the company was also carrying slaves to a colony of New Netherland.|$|E

5|$|By early November 1776, the {{majority}} of the regiment's officers and enlisted men had joined Washington's Main Army while it was engaged in the battle for New York City during the New York and New Jersey campaign. They were initially stationed at Fort Washington <b>on</b> <b>Manhattan</b> Island and nearby Fort Lee {{on the opposite side of}} the Hudson River. On November 16, most of the regiment was captured or killed during the Battle of Fort Washington. The riflemen were defending the northern end of the American position from a much larger force of several thousand Hessian troops. After heavy fighting that lasted most of the day and during which the Hessians suffered many casualties, the riflemen were eventually driven from the outer works into the fort where they and the rest of the outnumbered American garrison surrendered to the combined British and German attack force. Lieutenant Colonel Rawlings was commanding the regiment during the battle because Colonel Stephenson had died of illness in August or September and had not been replaced. About 140 of the regiment's officers and enlisted men—one-third of the unit's total complement of about 420 men—were not present at the battle, however, because they were still completing organization and recruiting. A few enlisted men of the regiment who escaped from their captors within the short chaotic period following the battle augmented this remaining active force, which continued to serve with the Main Army. On December 1, the first day of the army's next regular reporting period following the fall of Fort Washington, Washington provisionally grouped these remnants of the diminished regiment into two composite rifle companies commanded by the unit's highest ranking officers still free—Capts. Alexander Lawson Smith and Gabriel Long. Smith's company comprised all the remaining Marylanders in the regiment, whereas the Virginians of the unit were placed under Long's command.|$|E
