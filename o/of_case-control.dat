40|$|The most {{difficult}} {{and most important}} considerations in planning the protocol <b>of</b> a <b>case-control</b> study are ascertainment of cases, selection of controls {{and the quality of}} the exposure measurement. Plans to ensure careful field work are equally important; without attention to data collection, the protocol will be meaningless. In most case-control studies, the measurement problem is magnified because one cannot implement the collection of exposure information at the beginning of follow-up, and instead must rely on interviews, existing records or extrapolation into the past.

50|$|Retrospective studies compare {{unrelated}} {{individuals who}} {{fall into two}} categories, controls without the disease or phenotype of interest, and cases who have the phenotype of interest.

40|$|Q. Do oral {{contraceptives}} put {{women with a}} family history of breast cancer at increased risk? Evidence-based answer: No. Modern combined oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) don’t increase breast cancer risk in women with a family history (strength of recommendation [SOR]: B, systematic review <b>of</b> cohort, <b>case-control</b> studies). However, older, higher-dose OCPs (in use before 1975) did increase breast cancer risk in these women (SOR: C, case-control study). Similarly, modern OCPs don’t raise breast cancer risk in women with BRCA 1 / 2 mutations, although higher-dose, pre- 1975 OCPs did (SOR: B and C, a meta-analysis <b>of</b> cohort and <b>case-control</b> studies) ...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Recent case-control {{studies on}} the {{effectiveness}} of population-based breast cancer screening show differences in the magnitude of breast cancer mortality reduction. We investigated the role played by aspects <b>of</b> the <b>case-control</b> study design on these differences, e. g. the definition of cases and exposure to screening. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We investigated six case-control studies conducted in East Anglia (UK), Wales, Iceland, central and northern Italy, South Australia and The Netherlands. RESULTS: The breast cancer mortality reduction in the different case-control studies ranged from 38 % to 70 % in the screened versus the nonscreened women. We identified differences in design, e. g. the inclusion or exclusion of the first years of screening, and the correction factor for self-selection bias. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the design <b>of</b> the <b>case-control</b> studies was similar. The differences in the magnitude of breast cancer mortality reductions are therefore unlikely to be caused by variations in the design <b>of</b> the <b>case-control</b> studies. These differences must be due to other factors, like the organisation of the service screening programme and the attendance rate. The reduction in breast cancer mortality estimated in these case-control studies indicates that the impact of current mammographic screening is at least consistent with the effect reported by the former randomised screening trials...|$|R
