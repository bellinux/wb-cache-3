5|$|Giant mouse lemurs {{have two}} pairs of mammae, one on the chest (pectoral) {{and one on the}} abdomen (abdominal). Their fur is {{typically}} grayish-brown on the dorsal (back) side and more gray in color on the ventral (front) side. The tail is typically black-tipped. The new population found by WWF in 2010 has an overall lighter color, along with reddish or rusty patches near the hands and feet on the dorsal side of the arms and legs. This population also has a red tail, which darkens at the end. Vibrissae are found above the eyes (superciliary), above the mouth (buccal), under the lower jaw (genal), {{near the top of the}} jaw (interramal), and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrist</b> (carpal). Like mouse lemurs, the ears are large and membranous.|$|E
5|$|Generating {{alternative}} behaviours {{that the}} person can engage in instead of self-harm is one successful behavioural method that is employed to avoid self-harm. Techniques, aimed at keeping busy, may include journaling, taking a walk, participating in sports or exercise or being around friends when the person has the urge to harm themselves. The removal of objects used for self-harm from easy reach is also helpful for resisting self-harming urges. The provision of a card that allows the person to make emergency contact with counselling services should the urge to self-harm arise may also help prevent the act of self-harm. Alternative and safer methods of self-harm that do not lead to permanent damage, for example the snapping of a rubber band <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrist,</b> may also help calm the urge to self-harm. Using biofeedback may help raise self-awareness of certain pre-occupations or particular mental state or mood that precede bouts of self-harming behaviour, and help identify techniques to avoid those pre-occupations before they lead to self-harm. Any avoidance or coping strategy must be appropriate to the individual's motivation and reason for harming.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{most other}} land carnivorans, bears are plantigrade. They {{distribute}} their weight toward the hind feet, {{which makes them}} look lumbering when they walk. They are capable of bursts of speed but soon tire, {{and as a result}} mostly rely on ambush rather than the chase. Bears can stand on their hind feet and sit up straight with remarkable balance. Their front paws are flexible enough to grasp fruit and leaves. Bears' non-retractable claws are used for digging, climbing, tearing, and catching prey. The claws on the front feet are larger than those on the back and may be a hindrance when climbing trees; black bears are the most arboreal of the bears, and have the shortest claws. Pandas are unique in having a bony extension <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrist</b> of the front feet which acts as a thumb, and is used for gripping bamboo shoots as the animals feed.|$|E

25|$|Ankle sprains {{and wrist}} sprains {{are common in}} wrestling. Ankle sprains {{typically}} occur from twisting the ankle and injuring the ligaments within the ankle. Wrist sprains occur from falling hard <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrist</b> and damaging the ligaments in the wrist.|$|E

25|$|An actigraph unit is a motion-sensing device worn <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrist,</b> {{generally}} {{for one or}} two weeks. It gives a gross {{picture of}} sleep-wake cycles and is often used to verify the sleep diary. It is cost-efficient when full polysomnography is not required.|$|E
25|$|First baseman Ryan Zimmerman {{returned}} to the disabled list on August 6, having missed several games after {{being hit by a}} pitch <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrist.</b> Outfielder Brian Goodwin was called up to the major leagues {{for the first time to}} replace him on the Nationals' 25-man roster. He made his debut that evening, going 0-for-1 with a deep flyout to right field in a loss versus the San Francisco Giants at Nationals Park.|$|E
25|$|On August 11, 2005, {{after the}} NHL labour dispute had {{cancelled}} the 2004–05 season, Lindros signed a one-year, $1.55 {{million contract with}} the Maple Leafs for the 2005–06 season. After a steady start to his tenure with Toronto in which he recorded 22 points in 32 games, Lindros suffered a tear of a ligament in his left wrist against the Dallas Stars on December 10, 2005. After a 27-game absence, Lindros returned to the Toronto lineup on February 28, 2006, his 33rd birthday, against the Washington Capitals. His return was brief, however, as he re-injured his wrist while taking a slapshot {{in a game against}} the Ottawa Senators on March 4, effectively ending his season. He had surgery <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrist</b> at the Hand and Upper Limb Centre in London, Ontario, two days after the game.|$|E

50|$|Kalava (कलावा) is {{the sacred}} Hindu thread also called mauli (मौली) or charadu in Hindi. It is tied by a priest or an older family member, {{typically}} grandparents or parents <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrists</b> of all <b>the</b> people attending the prayer ceremony. The Kalava is tied <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right <b>wrist</b> {{of men and}} unmarried women and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left <b>wrist</b> of <b>the</b> married women. Cotton strings in form of yarn in full red are most common as is red with small bits of yellow, however, other dye combinations exist.

A stylised form of the Kalava is used for the holiday of Raksha Bandhan.|$|R
25|$|The Dodgers handed Strasburg a loss, {{his first}} of the season, on July 21. The loss snapped a string of 16 winning {{decisions}} for the Nationals pitcher, who finished the month at 14–1 after recording a win over the Cleveland Indians, pitching seven scoreless innings in interleague play at Progressive Field, on July 27. Also during the series in Cleveland, Zimmerman was activated from the disabled list on July 26, with outfielder Michael A. Taylor being optioned to Syracuse {{to make room for}} him on the roster, while infielder Stephen Drew landed on the disabled list with vertigo-like symptoms and was replaced on the roster by Wilmer Difo, a Senators infielder, the following day. The Nationals also lost catcher José Lobatón to injury, as he was placed on the disabled list on July 29 with tendinitis in his left elbow. Pedro Severino was recalled from Syracuse to take Lobatón's place as the Nationals' backup catcher. Zimmerman was injured again just days after coming off the disabled list when he was hit <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrist</b> by a fastball thrown by San Francisco Giants closer Santiago Casilla on July 31.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} Test match at Hamilton, Bell was hit hard <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrist</b> during New Zealand's first innings, whilst fielding at short leg. Despite initial fears that his wrist was broken and his tour would be over, the blow {{turned out to}} have only caused {{swelling}} and bruising. Bell went on to score 25 in England's first innings and top scored in the second innings with an unbeaten 54 as England crumbled to 110 all out and lost the match by 189 runs, the next highest score in the innings being 13 by Alastair Cook. In the second Test, Bell scored 11 and 41 as England won the match to level the series. His finest innings of the tour was in the final Test. After scoring 9 in the first innings, Bell was under some pressure to post a big score. He joined Andrew Strauss at the crease with England 140/3 and the pair proceeded to put on 187 runs and effectively put the match beyond New Zealand. In the process, Bell scored his 7th Test century, and his first overseas for more than two years. He finished the series with a batting average of 50.00, and became the second youngest England player to reach 2,500 runs.|$|E
25|$|The video {{begins with}} a small boy and girl playing on a {{playground}} together, teasingly pushing each other around. The young girl {{is intended to be}} Clarkson as a child, presumably with her young male best friend. The boy hands her a beaded necklace, which she puts on admiringly. The shot closes in on the necklace, then pulls back to reveal it's still worn as a bracelet <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrist</b> of now-adult Clarkson, her boyfriend (played by Houston Rhines) shows up at her apartment door, presumably after an argument. Clarkson teases him with a set of keys, which she then throws down the toilet. The two are then shown sitting on a couch, reading magazines, when Clarkson grabs her boyfriend's magazine. The two are shown throwing various possessions of one another out of the apartment window, though in a playful manner. Such items include numerous articles of clothing, magazines, a guitar (which Clarkson tries to stop him throwing out), and a fishbowl (with the fish being taken out and put in a glass first, after which they look out the window). After throwing these items out the window, the two are seen sitting affectionately on the couch. Clarkson and her boyfriend are shown still fighting and bickering as they did as children, over the TV Guide and remote control. The latter portion of the video shows the two driving in a first generation Ford Bronco (with the necklace/bracelet hanging from the rear view mirror), eventually getting into an argument. Distracted by the tiff over directions, the Bronco nearly ends up in a head-on collision with an approaching car. After spinning out to avoid the crash, Clarkson simply grabs her boyfriend and pulls him into a kiss, where the video ends.|$|E

Snake forces Brain and his girlfriend Maggie to lead him to the Duke's compound at Grand Central Terminal. He finds the President, but is captured by the Duke's men.|$|E
500|$|The company H. Williamson Ltd., {{based in}} Coventry, {{was one of}} the first to {{capitalize}} on this opportunity. During the company's 1916 AGM it was noted that [...] "...the public is buying the practical things of life. Nobody can truthfully contend that the watch is a luxury. It is said that one soldier in every four wears a wristlet watch, and the other three mean to get one as soon as they can." [...] By the end of the War, almost all enlisted men wore a wristwatch, and after they were demobilized, the fashion soon caught on – the British Horological Journal wrote in 1917 that [...] "...the wristlet watch was little used by the sterner sex before the war, but now is seen <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrist</b> of nearly every man in uniform and of many men in civilian attire." [...] Within a decade, sales of wristwatches had outstripped those of pocket watches.|$|E
500|$|After his {{retirement}} from an mechanical failure, Bräck stated it affected his championship chances slightly and {{his retirement}} {{from the race}} was [...] "something that you don't want to have happen but unfortunately it happens sometimes and today {{it was one of}} those days." [...] Three days after the race, Tracy and Takagi was penalized by CART chief stewart Chris Kneifel for [...] "unjustifiable risk" [...] and for causing several caution periods by contact with other competitors. Tracy had two championship points deducted and was placed on probation for the next three road or street course races, while Takagi also had two points taken off his total and was given a probation period of three events. Kneifel said why the penalties were issued: We did not want to simply issue probations without accompanying them with a strong signal that actions like this will not be tolerated. Championship points are very hard-earned, and they're more valuable than money. We want our response to send out the very strong message that this isn't a slap <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrist,</b> or a token punishment.|$|E

[...] As the questions from the board continue, Ron angrily defends Leslie, insisting, [...] "Leslie has never broken a rule in her life, to the point that it's annoying."
