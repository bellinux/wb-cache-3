Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has argued that this stringent screening process is necessary as the President does not stand as a political party nominee. He is thus not subjected to the internal screening mechanism of the ruling People's Action Party (PAP).|$|E
5|$|Moral {{rights in}} United Kingdom law {{are parts of}} {{copyright}} law that protect the personal interests of {{the author of a}} copyrighted work, as well as the economic interests protected by other elements of copyright. Found in the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, the moral rights are the right to be identified as the author of a work, known as the right of paternity, the right to object to derogatory treatment of a work, known as the right <b>of</b> <b>integrity,</b> the right not to be identified as the author of someone else's work, and the right to privacy. The right of paternity exists for the entire copyright term, and requires individuals who commercially broadcast, sell, perform or exhibit literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works to identify the author of the work – but this does not apply to things such as typefaces, encyclopaedias or works subject to crown copyright.|$|E

5|$|Morris aided the DF {{using his}} artistic and {{literary}} talents; he designed the group's membership card, and helped author their manifesto, Socialism Made Plain, {{in which they}} demanded improved housing for workers, free compulsory education for all children, free school meals, an eight-hour working day, the abolition of national debt, nationalisation of land, banks, and railways, and the organisation of agriculture and industry under state control and co-operative principles. Some of his DF comrades {{found it difficult to}} reconcile his socialist values with his position as proprietor of the Firm, although he was widely admired as a man <b>of</b> <b>integrity.</b> The DF began publishing a weekly newspaper, Justice, which soon faced financial losses that Morris covered. Morris also regularly contributed articles to the newspaper, in doing so befriending another contributor, George Bernard Shaw.|$|E
5|$|Western gunslinger {{heroes are}} portrayed as local lawmen or {{enforcement}} officers, ranchers, army officers, cowboys, territorial marshals, nomadic loners, or skilled fast-draw artists. They are normally masculine persons <b>of</b> <b>integrity</b> and principle - courageous, moral, tough, solid, and self-sufficient, maverick characters (often with trusty sidekicks), possessing an independent and honorable attitude (but often characterized as slow-talking). They are depicted as similar to a knight-errant, wandering {{from place to place}} with no particular direction, often facing curious and hostile enemies, while saving individuals or communities from those enemies in terms of chivalry. The Western hero usually stands alone and faces danger on his own, commonly against lawlessness, with an expert display of his physical skills (roping, gun-play, horse-handling, pioneering abilities, etc.).|$|E
5|$|Presidential {{elections}} in Singapore, {{in which the}} President of Singapore is directly elected by popular vote, were introduced through amendments to the Constitution of Singapore in 1991. Potential candidates for office have to fulfil stringent qualifications {{set out in the}} Constitution. Certificates of eligibility are issued by the Presidential Elections Committee (PEC). In particular, the PEC must assess that they are persons <b>of</b> <b>integrity,</b> good character and reputation; and if they have not previously held certain key government appointments or were the chief executives of profitable companies with shareholders' equity of an average of S$500 million for the most recent three years in that office, they must demonstrate to the PEC that they held a position of comparable seniority and responsibility in the public or private sector that has given them experience and ability in administering and managing financial affairs. The general strictness of the required qualifications led to the walkovers in 3 out of 5 of the presidential elections, as presidents S. R. Nathan and Halimah Yacob were the sole candidates to receive a certificate of eligibility from the PEC in their respective years in the 1999, 2005 and 2017 elections. The stringent criteria, the transparency of the PEC's decision-making process and the practice of political parties endorsing candidates have drawn criticism.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This thesis {{intends to}} {{understand}} historical integrity {{and how it}} {{plays a role in}} historic rehabilitation and adaptive reuse projects. More importantly, this study allows for {{a better understanding of the}} Kirkbride Plan as a particular building type that dominated state mental hospital design in between 1848 - 1890 and advanced the field of psychiatry. This study examines three adaptively reused Kirkbride hospitals Athens State Hospital, Athens, OH; Weston State Hospital, Weston, WV; and Danvers State Hospital Danvers MA. The three case studies were surveyed using the National Park Service seven aspects <b>of</b> historical <b>integrity,</b> to examine if historical integrity was preserved in the adaptive reuses. Results: The results of this study strived to uncover the best adaptive reuse method that best preserves the historical <b>integrity</b> <b>of</b> Kirkbride hospitals. Three outcomes of the retention <b>of</b> historical <b>integrity</b> were revealed: The retention <b>of</b> historical <b>integrity,</b> the potential loss <b>of</b> historical <b>integrity,</b> and the loss <b>of</b> historical <b>integrity...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to describe}} and analyse individual stages of a civil process for the protection <b>of</b> personal <b>integrity.</b> The civil process is a unique stream, within {{which there is a}} protection of personal rights offered to individuals. Immaterial damage caused by unauthorized interference in such important personal right such as rights <b>of</b> personal <b>integrity</b> without doubt are, is often correctly replaced only by the judicial decision. For this reason, it requires knowledge of both the substantive civil law, which underlines the protection of the rights <b>of</b> personal <b>integrity,</b> as well as civil procedure law, in which the substantive law is being implemented. The content of this dissertation is the analysis of the various parts of the judicial process from filing an action for protection <b>of</b> personal <b>integrity</b> to the court's decision, enforcement and execution in matters of protection <b>of</b> personal <b>integrity.</b> The dissertation illustrates the complex picture into the issues of civil proceedings in the matters of protection <b>of</b> personal <b>integrity</b> and quotes directly from court decisions in each of the stages of the proceedings.
