5|$|The player {{controls}} the boy throughout the game. As {{is typical of}} most two-dimensional platform games, the boy can run left or right, jump, climb onto short ledges or up and down ladders and ropes, and push <b>or</b> <b>pull</b> objects. Limbo is presented through dark, greyscale graphics and with minimalist ambient sounds, creating an eerie, haunting environment. The dark visuals also hide numerous environmental and physical hazards, such as deadly bear traps on the forest floor, or lethal monsters hiding in the shadows, such as a giant spider. Among the hazards are glowing worms, which attach themselves to the boy's head and force him to travel in only one direction until they are killed.|$|E

25|$|A {{flexible}} flyer or steel runner sled is a steerable wooden sled {{with thin}} metal runners whereby a rider may sit upright on the sled or lie on their stomach, allowing {{the possibility to}} descend a snowy slope feet-first or head-first. To steer the sled, the rider may either push on the wooden cross piece with their hands or feet, <b>or</b> <b>pull</b> on the rope attached to the wooden cross-piece. The flexible flyer was invented in 1889 by Philadelphia resident Samuel Leeds Allen. U.S. patent #408,681 was issued to Allen on August 13, 1889.|$|E
25|$|A soft contact lens may {{be removed}} by {{pinching}} the edge between the {{thumb and index}} finger. Moving the lens off the cornea first can improve comfort during removal and reduce risk of scratching the cornea with a fingernail. It is also possible to push <b>or</b> <b>pull</b> a soft lens far enough to the side or bottom of the eyeball {{to get it to}} fold then fall out, without pinching and thereby damaging it. If these techniques are used with a rigid lens, it may scratch the cornea.|$|E

25|$|The oval {{dimensions}} {{were originally}} 190m x 125m, both unusually long and unusually narrow for an Australian cricket/football ground. The arrangement was highly favourable for batsmen who played {{square of the}} wicket, and heavily penalised bowlers who delivered the ball short or wide so that the batsman could play cut, hook <b>or</b> <b>pull</b> shots. Before the far ends in front of and behind the wicket were roped off, making the playing area shorter, {{it was not uncommon}} for batsmen to hit an all-run four or even occasionally a five.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes a spinner will bowl leg {{theory and}} have seven fielders {{on the leg}} side, and will bowl {{significantly}} wide of the leg stump to prevent scoring. Often the ball is so wide that the batsman cannot hit the ball straight of mid-on while standing still, and cannot hit to the off side unless they try unorthodox and risky shots such as a reverse sweep <b>or</b> <b>pull,</b> or switch their handedness. The batsman can back away to the leg side to hit through the off side, but can expose their stumps in doing so.|$|E
25|$|For {{the next}} 6 days the Marines {{continued}} patrolling, suffering frequent ambushes despite strong preparatory fires. The Marines altered their tactics {{so that when}} the enemy was encountered they would hold their positions <b>or</b> <b>pull</b> back to allow air and artillery to deal with the entrenched forces. From 24–7 May a sustained fight took place at the hamlet of Le Bac (1), only ending when torrential rain made further fighting impossible. By the end of May total casualties for the battle were 138 Marines killed and 686 wounded while PAVN/Vietcong losses exceeded 600 killed.|$|E

25|$|The {{lightweight}} demand helmets {{in general}} use by surface-supplied divers are integrally ballasted for neutral buoyancy in the water, {{so they do}} not float off the diver's head <b>or</b> <b>pull</b> upwards on the neck, but the larger volume free-flow helmets would be too heavy and cumbersome if they had all the required weight built in. Therefore, they are either ballasted after dressing the diver by fastening weights to the lower parts of the helmet assembly, so the weight is carried on the shoulders when out of the water, or the helmet may be held down by a jocking strap and the harness weights provide the ballast.|$|E
25|$|Domesticated {{horses are}} also subject to {{inconsistent}} movement between stabling and work; they must carry <b>or</b> <b>pull</b> additional weight, and in modern times, {{they are often}} kept and worked on very soft footing, such as irrigated land, arena footing, or stall bedding. In some cases, management is also inadequate. The hooves of horses that are kept in stalls or small turnouts, even when cleaned adequately, are exposed to more moisture than would be encountered in the wild, {{as well as to}} ammonia from urine. The hoof capsule is mostly made from keratin, a protein, and is weakened by this exposure, becoming even more fragile and soft. Shoes do not prevent or reduce damage from moisture and ammonia exposure. Rather, they protect already weakened hooves. Further, without the natural conditioning factors present in the wild, the feet of horses grow overly large and long unless trimmed regularly. Hence, protection from rocks, pebbles, and hard, uneven surfaces is lacking. A balanced diet with proper nutrition also is a factor. Without these precautions, cracks in overgrown and overly brittle hoof walls are a danger, as is bruising of the soft tissues within the foot because of inadequately thick and hard sole material.|$|E
25|$|In mid-July, with Sherman {{practically}} on {{the doorstep}} of Atlanta, Confederate President Jefferson Davis demonstrated his dissatisfaction with Gen. Joseph E. Johnston's efforts to stop him by relieving him of command and placing the troops under Gen. John Bell Hood instead. Living up to his aggressive and often reckless nature, Hood wasted little time in ordering {{an attack on the}} Union forces near Peachtree Creek. Late in the afternoon on July 20, the Confederates assaulted Union Maj. Gen. George Henry Thomas' Army of the Cumberland, to which the XX Corps was assigned, catching them completely off guard. Occupying the right flank of Alpheus Williams' First Division, the 46th was in danger of being overlapped by the Confederates. The companies positioned on the right were ordered to refuse the regiment's line, <b>or</b> <b>pull</b> back to form a right angle to the companies on the left. Eventually, with reinforcements arriving to plug a gap between Williams and the next Union division to his right, the Confederates were beaten back. For the 46th, the Battle of Peachtree Creek was second only to Cedar Mountain in the losses they sustained: 26 officers and men killed or mortally wounded, 86 wounded, and 1 missing.|$|E

25|$|LucasArts' {{previous}} graphic adventure, Sam & Max Hit the Road (1993), {{introduced a}} new inventory and interaction system to replace those of their prior games, which had taken up the lower third of the player's screen. Full Throttle continued to refine on the changes introduced in Sam & Max Hit the Road: Objects or characters with which Ben can interact are indicated by a red square appearing around the cursor's crosshairs when the cursor is placed over the object. When this occurs, holding down the left mouse button causes a contextual pie menu {{to appear in the}} shape of the emblem of Ben's biker gang: a flaming circle topped by a skull and flanked by a boot and a gloved hand. The player hovers the cursor over elements of the emblem and then releases the mouse button to attempt various interactions with the object; for example, selecting the skull's mouth to speak to a character, its eyes to examine an object, or the hand to pick up, use, <b>or</b> <b>pull</b> the object. Right-clicking anywhere on the screen brings up the player's inventory of collected objects, which can be examined or dragged and dropped in order to use them with other items in the inventory or with objects or characters in the scene. These gameplay features would be further developed for The Curse of Monkey Island (1997).|$|E
500|$|An elastic force acts {{to return}} a spring to its natural length. An ideal spring is taken to be massless, frictionless, unbreakable, and {{infinitely}} stretchable. Such springs exert forces that push when contracted, <b>or</b> <b>pull</b> when extended, {{in proportion to the}} displacement of the spring from its equilibrium position. This linear relationship was described by Robert Hooke in 1676, for whom Hooke's law is named. If [...] is the displacement, the force exerted by an ideal spring equals: ...|$|E
500|$|A {{fundamental}} principle of equine conformation is [...] "form to function". Therefore, {{the type of}} horse used for various forms of warfare depended on the work performed, the weight a horse needed to carry <b>or</b> <b>pull,</b> and distance travelled. Weight affects speed and endurance, creating a trade-off: armour added protection, but added weight reduces maximum speed. Therefore, various cultures had different military needs. In some situations, one primary type of horse was favoured over all others. In other places, multiple types were needed; warriors would travel to battle riding a lighter horse of greater speed and endurance, and then switch to a heavier horse, with greater weight-carrying capacity, when wearing heavy armour in actual combat.|$|E

500|$|Injury to {{the ears}} has been present since Roman {{times as a}} method of {{reprimand}} or punishment - [...] "In Roman times, when a dispute arose that could not be settled amicably, the injured party cited the name of the person thought to be responsible before the Praetor; if the offender did not appear within the specified time limit, the complainant summoned witnesses to make statements. [...] If they refused, as often happened, the injured party was allowed to drag them by the ear and to pinch them hard if they resisted. [...] Hence the French expression [...] "se faire tirer l’oreille", of which the literal meaning is [...] "to have one's ear pulled" [...] and the figurative meaning [...] "to take a lot of persuading". We use the expression [...] "to tweak [...] (<b>or</b> <b>pull)</b> someone's ears" [...] to mean [...] "inflict a punishment"." ...|$|E
500|$|Bradman's early {{development}} {{was shaped by}} the high bounce of the ball on matting-over-concrete pitches. He favoured [...] "horizontal-bat" [...] shots (such as the hook, pull and cut) {{to deal with the}} bounce and devised a unique grip on the bat handle that would accommodate these strokes without compromising his ability to defend. Employing a side-on stance at the wicket, Bradman kept perfectly still as the bowler ran in. His backswing had a [...] "crooked" [...] look that troubled his early critics, but he resisted entreaties to change. His backswing kept his hands in close to the body, leaving him perfectly balanced and able to change his stroke mid-swing, if need be. Another telling factor was the decisiveness of Bradman's footwork. He [...] "used the crease" [...] by either coming metres down the wicket to drive, or playing so far back that his feet ended up level with the stumps when playing the cut, hook <b>or</b> <b>pull.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{long hair}} {{tradition}} was widespread among English and French {{men in the}} 11th and 12th centuries, though it was considered, mostly because of endorsement of the Roman Catholic Church, acceptable for men also to have shorter hair. [...] The tradition was largely brought about by monarchs who rejected the shorter hairstyle, causing the people to follow. [...] Wulfstan, a religious leader, worried that those with longer hair would fight like women, and be unable to protect England from foreign invasion. This idea {{can be found in}} later military leaders as well, such as those of the American Confederacy. Knights and rulers would also sometimes cut <b>or</b> <b>pull</b> out their hair in order to show penitence and mourning, and a squire's hair was generally shorter than a knight's. Married women who let their hair flow out in public were frowned upon, as this was normally reserved for the unwed, although they were allowed to let it out in mourning, to show their distressed state. Through these centuries it was expected of Eastern Christians to wear long hair as well as long beards, which was especially expected from clergy and monks.|$|E
