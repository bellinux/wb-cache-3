The method {{developed}} {{in this study}} requires the incubation of enzyme solution droplets {{on the surface of}} the film, and in a matter of minutes <b>opaque</b> hydrolysis <b>spots</b> will be visible on the film surface. The density of the <b>opaque</b> <b>spots</b> can be quantified and correlated to the enzyme concentration. This method provides a more sensitive way to observe and measure the rate of hydrolysis of polymer films by lipases. In addition, comparison with conventional lipase assays revealed that some lipases showed better activity when PHA was used as a substrate.|$|R

50|$|A major {{exception}} to this rule should be applied when <b>opaque</b> <b>spot</b> colors are used.

The histological analysis of biopsy samples obtained during the initial endoscopy examination showed both neoplastic follicles and an inter-follicular infiltration of lymphoma cells, whereas the biopsy samples obtained at the endoscopy performed 9 months later showed only neoplastic follicle formation.

30|$|Due to the {{observation}} of ring or full <b>opaque</b> <b>spot</b> patterns, and high or low intensity of opaque spots produced by different types of lipases, it was initially thought that each type of lipase may produce their own unique patterns on polymer films. After further investigation {{of the effect of}} lipase concentration on hydrolysis spot patterns, it was revealed that the patterns were actually caused by different reaction rate of the enzymes. Different lipases may produce the same spot intensity at different concentration. It is then very obvious that this novel assay method not only detects the hydrolysis of polymer film by lipases, but also differentiates the rate of reaction or the activity of the enzymes on the film.|$|E
30|$|Preparation of lipase samples {{as well as}} {{qualitative}} and quantitative analysis of hydrolysis spot densities were carried out as previously described (Ch’ng and Sudesh 2013). Different types of lipases were weighed and dissolved in PBS (pH 7.4) respectively. Triplicates of 10 µL lipase solution were dropped on P(3 HB-co- 4 HB) film. Buffer without addition of lipase was used as negative control. The film with lipase droplets was incubated at 37  °C for 30  min. After that, the droplets were washed away by gently rinsing with distilled water and the film was allowed to dry. The image of the film was then scanned using optical scanner with a black background. The brightness and contrast of image was adjusted and the <b>opaque</b> <b>spot</b> formed on the P(3 HB-co- 4 HB) film was cropped out, aligned and further analyzed using ImageJ, a freeware downloaded from internet. The color of the picture was inverted by changing the spot to black color with white background. The density of spot was measured and the average density was further calculated as relative density by dividing the density of sample by that of negative control.|$|E
40|$|The Kaman microspectroscopic {{method was}} used to {{determine}} the local water and protein content in human lenses. In 18 lenses of varying age position-defined water/protein content measurements were carried out along the visual and the equatorial axis. A main characteristic of the human lens is its constant and relatively low protein content. In addition this constant nuclear value is reached within a short distance from the capsular surface. For statistical analysis of age-related changes the data points in individual lenses were piecewise linearized. (1) The mean nuclear water content was calculated from the data points in the inner 80 % of the visual axis. (2) The steep drop in water content was linearized using a least-squares linear regression approach. The distance between lenticular surface and the intersection of the regression line with the line representing the nuclear mean was denominated as surface layer width. It proved that: (i) the mean nuclear water content significantly increased with age, (ii) the width of the surface layer was age independent in the anterior and posterior poles of the visual axis, and (iii) in the equatorial axis the surface layer width significantly decreased with age.

5000|$|In the {{earliest}} non-electronic information processing devices, such as Jacquard's loom or Babbage's Analytical Engine, a bit was often stored as {{the position of}} a mechanical lever or gear, or {{the presence or absence of}} a hole at a specific point of a paper card or tape. The first electrical devices for discrete logic (such as elevator and traffic light control circuits, telephone switches, and Konrad Zuse's computer) represented bits as the states of electrical relays which could be either [...] "open" [...] or [...] "closed". When relays were replaced by vacuum tubes, starting in the 1940s, computer builders experimented with a variety of storage methods, such as pressure pulses traveling down a mercury delay line, charges stored on the inside surface of a cathode-ray tube, or <b>opaque</b> <b>spots</b> printed on glass discs by photolithographic techniques.|$|R
30|$|A {{concentration}} {{profile for}} all 12 types of lipases were constructed by dropping different concentrations {{of the same}} type of enzyme on a single film and observing the patterns and intensity of <b>opaque</b> <b>spots</b> produced after incubation. Apart from the lipase of A. oryzae, which produced ring patterns regardless of its concentration, the other 11 types of lipases all showed a similar trend of increasing opacity when lipase concentration was increased (results not shown). In order to obtain a nice concentration profile for each lipase, its minimum and maximum concentration that can produce <b>opaque</b> <b>spots</b> {{visible to the naked eye}} should be taken into consideration. The minimum concentration marks the point where the lowest hydrolytic activity on the film can be observed whereas the maximum concentration is the point before the rate of hydrolysis is fast enough to cause substrate depletion. It is difficult to differentiate between no hydrolysis and substrate depletion, since both also leave behind a transparent background. A very simple and effective method for the confirmation of substrate depletion is by scraping the surface of the hydrolysis spot with something pointed such as the tip of a mechanical pencil. If there is no substrate depletion, there will be a scrape mark produced, showing that there are still traces of polymer left on the glass petri dish. Similarly, if the thin polymer film had been hydrolyzed into water soluble subunits, and are washed away during the rinsing step after incubation with lipase solution, then it will be impossible to produce a scrape mark on the petri dish. The different working ranges of the film in detecting polymer degrading ability of the lipases are shown in Figure  6. It is important to bear in mind that with different thickness of cast film produced, incubation time, or lipase concentration, the range may shift depending on the enzymatic rate and substrate amount beneath the lipase droplet.|$|R

The correlation between protein content and refractive index and the observed decrease in nuclear protein content in aging human lenses can be taken as strong evidence that upon aging the refractive index of {{a major part of the}} human lens is reduced. The implications of this decrease is discussed with the respect to the problem known as the lens Paradox, i. e. the discrepancy between the theoretically expected age-related loss of far vision due to changes in lens curvature and axial position in the eye and the actually observed loss in near vision upon age...|$|R

40|$|Hot-pressing {{schedules}} – able {{to ensure}} a proper balance between positive and negative effects of LiF – allow fabrication of highly transparent MgAl 2 O 4 parts under low-pressure (≤ 50 MPa); peak temperatures in excess of 1550 °C are needed, with best results obtained at ∼ 1650 °C. At the concentration-levels and conditions present during hot-pressing, LiF does not react with spinel; it is inert also toward graphite. The lubricant and solvent abilities of liquid LiF make possible achievement of densification levels > 90 %TD under 1200 °C. All LiF leaves the specimens as such at temperatures ≤ 1550 °C. LiF's ability to close porosity at temperatures lower than those (> 1350 °C) - which allow significant carbon penetration into spinel – is essential in achievement of transparency. Light absorption – occurring when carbon is present – is thus prevented.

5000|$|Before {{the advent}} of digital image sensors, photography, {{for the most part}} of its history, used film to record light information. At the heart of every {{photographic}} film are a large number of light-sensitive grains of silver-halide crystals. During exposure, each micron-sized grain has a binary fate: Either it is struck by some incident photons and becomes [...] "exposed", or it is missed by the photon bombardment and remains [...] "unexposed". In the subsequent film development process, exposed grains, due to their altered chemical properties, are converted to silver metal, contributing to <b>opaque</b> <b>spots</b> on the film; unexposed grains are washed away in a chemical bath, leaving behind the transparent regions on the film. Thus, in essence, photographic film is a binary imaging medium, using local densities of opaque silver grains to encode the original light intensity information. Thanks to the small size and large number of these grains, one hardly notices this quantized nature of film when viewing it at a distance, observing only a continuous gray tone.|$|R
