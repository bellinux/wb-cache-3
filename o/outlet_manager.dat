40|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{explaining}} governance structure variety in franchising, we explore the impact of governance structure on the incentives to invest in specific assets for the franchisor {{as well as the}} distributors. Wholly-owned, wholly-franchised, and mixed (dual distribution) franchise systems are considered. Circumstances are identified when a dual distribution governance structure uniquely allocates efficient ownership over assets. Whether dual distribution benefits are realized in a franchise or a cooperative franchise depends on whether most value is added upstream or downstream. A disadvantage of a dual distribution system is the deterioration of the investment incentives of the party having no authority, i. e. either the company-owned <b>outlet</b> <b>manager</b> in a traditional franchise or the franchisor in a cooperative franchise. A wholly-franchised system may therefore be efficient even when unique dual distribution benefits are present. A necessary condition for the efficiency of a dual distribution governance structure is a positive systemic effect, not the value of the brand name or location (or other) differences between outlets.

The researcher asked the respondents to rate the series of statement that evolve from their viewpoints of job characteristics and job satisfaction. Meanwhile the factors that contribute to job characteristics are autonomy, feedback, skill variety, task identity and task significance. The five main factors may become the strong or weakness factors that contribute to the relationship between job characteristics and job satisfaction.

40|$|Background: Vending {{machines}} and shops located within {{health care facilities}} {{are a source of}} food and drinks for staff, visitors and outpatients and they have the potential to promote healthy food and drink choices. This paper describes perceptions of parents and managers of health-service located food outlets towards the availability and labelling of healthier food options and the food and drinks offered for sale in health care facilities in Australia. It also describes the impact of an intervention to improve availability and labelling of healthier foods and drinks for sale. Methods: Parents (n = 168) and food <b>outlet</b> <b>managers</b> (n = 17) were surveyed. Food and drinks for sale in health-service operated food outlets (n = 5) and vending machines (n = 90) in health care facilities in the Hunter New England region of NSW were audited pre (2007) and post (2010 / 11) the introduction of policy and associated support to increase the availability of healthier choices. A traffic light system was used to classify foods from least (red) to most healthy choices (green). Results: Almost all (95 %) parents and most (65 %) food <b>outlet</b> <b>managers</b> thought food <b>outlets</b> on health service sites should have signs clearly showing healthy choices. Parents (90 %) also thought all food outlets on health service sites should provide mostly healthy items compared to 47 % of managers. The proportion of healthier beverage slots in vending machines increased from 29 % to 51 % at follow-up and the proportion of machines that labelled healthier drinks increased from 0 to 26 %. No outlets labelled healthier items at baseline compared to 4 out of 5 after the intervention. No changes were observed in the availability or labelling of healthier food in vending machines or the availability of healthier food or drinks in food outlets. Conclusions: Baseline availability and labelling of healthier food and beverage choices for sale in health care facilities was poor in spite of the support of parents and <b>outlet</b> <b>managers</b> for such initiatives. The intervention encouraged improvements in the availability and labelling of healthier drinks but not foods in vending machines...|$|R
40|$|This study {{deals with}} {{corporate}} social responsibility (CSR) and focuses on managerial perceptions of CSR at McDonald’s South Africa (SA) and how social responsibility is translated into social practices. The key objectives of the research are: to analyse McDonald’s both internationally and locally in South Africa to establish whether CSR policies exist, then to investigate how these policies are perceived and integrated by <b>outlet</b> <b>managers.</b> Lastly to investigate what kind of social responsibility (SR) involvement, if at all, occurs at outlet level. The research site covers three regions in South Africa, which are the Eastern Cape, Western Cape and Gauteng. The total research sample is 38. 33 interviewees were <b>outlet</b> <b>managers,</b> who were purposively selected, and 5 additional interviews took place with: 2 McDonald’s SA Head Office representatives, 2 interviews with beneficiaries of McDonald’s SR involvement and 1 with the trade union SACCAWU. The research was carried out through questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. The design {{of this research is}} based on an interpretive social science approach. The aim of the research was to investigate outlet managers’ perceptions of CSR and social practices present at McDonald’s SA outlets. The key findings of the research indicate that: CSR policies at McDonald’s SA head office are not communicated sufficiently to <b>outlet</b> <b>managers,</b> SR involvement is evident, especially for initiatives focusing on children’s welfare, but far too little occurs at the outlet level. There are also too few checks on social involvement by head office and no formal reporting system is available to the outlets except through an internal magazine, called the Big Mag. There is no official CSR report at McDonald’s SA. The fact that no report exists makes this study more relevant since this research investigates matters pertaining to CSR and social practices. The overall significance of the study is that it brings to the forefront the importance of internal company and external broader regulation {{which is part of the}} greater debate of CSR. This is because the analysis of managerial perceptions and implementation of CSR shows some unwarranted discrepancies between policies and practices, locally, nationally and internationally even within the same organisation. ...|$|R

40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Business Administration of the University of Luton. Over recent years, the service sector has grown at a dramatic rate, and with it has come significant challenges for the operators in this field. Not least of these has been the desire of these operators to create real competitive advantage by offering levels of service that call upon the servers in the interaction to engage in an emotional way with their customers, in addition to offering transactional efficiency and cost containment. The focus {{of this study is}} to examine the emotional dimension of the service experience from the perspective of the key stakeholders in the encounter, the customer, the service employee and the <b>outlet</b> <b>manager.</b> This study is carried out in the pub restaurant sector, with the brand leader in the full-service restaurant business. The research focuses on the role that emotions play in the performance outputs of outlet management in particular using the concept of emotional intelligence and the use of the Bar-On Emotional Quotient Inventory (Eqi) as a measurement instrument to explore the relationships between emotions and performance. The study then focuses on the server population who interact with the customers everyday, using measures of emotional intelligence and emotional labour to understand their relationship to the performance outputs of the servers, essentially the service quality offered to their customers. Finally the responses of the customer are measured from an emotional perspective, gathering their emotional response to a range of service cues. This customer data forms the basis of the relationships explored between server emotional competence and their delivery of service quality. The research reveals significant relationships between the emotional competencies of the managerial group and their business performance achievements in the areas of customer satisfaction, employee satisfaction, employee turnover and outlet profit growth. It demonstrates relationships between the emotional make-up of service personnel and aspects of emotional labour. The study also demonstrates the level of emotional response of customers to a range of service stimulants and finally the research reveals the extent to which a range of interactive service stimulants can create positive emotional expression in customers. The study culminates in the presentation of two models that are designed to guide service organisations to developing and then maintaining an integrated approach to emotional service development in their own market sector. These models build on the findings in the research that demonstrate a high level of inter-relationship between the different components that contribute to the overall service experience. The study ultimately argues that to ignore or isolate the consideration of the emotions right across the service chain, from brand proposition through to recruitment, development and measurement of the overall service quality at best leaves the service organisation exposed to sub-optimising its service offering. Conversely the value of adopting a fully integrated approach to the development of the service organisation could lead to a level of loyalty from both employees and customers that would provide sustainable competitive advantage in the service market...|$|E

40|$|Cooperative {{organizational}} forms such as franchising {{and joint}} venturing {{have long been}} popularamong hospitality chains. However, not all chains use cooperative organizational forms {{and those that do}} varygreatlyin theirproclivityto use them. One possible explanation for this variation is that when a chain confronts critical resource scarcities, its managers will use cooperative organization in order to build upon the resources of their partners. However a second approach, agency theory, suggests that chain managers use cooperative organization to minimize the costs of monitor-ing <b>outlet</b> <b>managers.</b> Using data on 94 restaurant chains, hypotheses are tested that investigate the independent and joint efficacy of these explanations. Results show that capital and brand name are important resources affecting the choice of organizational form whereas geographic dispersion, task programmability, and asset specificity are key agency variables. Overall, perhaps the key finding is that the ability of agency theory to explain organizational form is diminished among resource scarce chains. The results, therefore, suggest that both perspectives are needed to fully explain the choice of organizational form. Key words: hospitality management, resource scarcity, agency theory, organizational form. &dquo;Billions and billions served&dquo;- this motto has been proudly displayed at McDonald’s restaurants worldwide.

40|$|The article {{draws on}} the theory of {{conventions}} to analyse the shift in the geographical origin of salted codfish consumed in Spain. Since the mid- 1990 s, Norway has lost most of its market share to new suppliers such as Iceland. The authors analyse a dataset comprising statistical data and information from semi-structured interviews conducted with Spanish processing companies, retail <b>outlets,</b> foodservice <b>managers,</b> and private consumers. They find that this substitution process {{is a consequence of}} the ability of new suppliers to meet the more complex demands of the increasingly segmented Spanish market. Further, regional consumption patterns in Spain are diverging from the comparatively homogeneous situation that underpinned the traditional Norwegian hegemony. Industrial, market, and public conventions have become more influential in the most populated regions, such as Madrid, Catalonia, and the Basque Country. The authors argue that a stronger focus on the upper segment of the Spanish codfish market, based on domestic, ecological, and civic conventions, might constitute a reliable strategy for Norwegian producers to recapture some of their market share. It is concluded that concerned consumers in Spain are still sensitive to attributes related to origin, sustainability, and local development, all of which underpin the Norwegian salted codfish production system.

40|$|Diversity? {{has become}} one of the most {{commonly}} used words by U. S. corporations. Indeed, many companies claim that they have spent millions, sometimes billions of dollars to create an egalitarian workplace for all workers. Given the amount of money spent and the increased amount of research that corporations have done on the issue of diversity, we should expect some progress in terms of equality or equal rights for minority and female workers. However, while there has been a substantial increase in the rise of corporate philosophy espousing diversity, there is also overwhelming data that suggests minorities and women are still unable to obtain opportunities or to achieve success at the same rates as their white male counterparts. How can we explain the apparent contradictions? Furthermore, why are many companies that have historically barred minorities and women from their workplace now publicizing their support for racial and gender integration? I suggest that corporations are using the word ?diversity? as an ideological tool designed to promote themselves at the forefront of equality in the U. S. Using in-depth interviews conducted with 40 middle and senior-level managers and upper-level executive officers from Fortune 1000 companies, I find that while the word diversity is frequently uttered by managers (and strategically used in various media <b>outlets),</b> most <b>managers</b> are unable to clearly define diversity. Moreover, while managers claim their companies are interested in diversity, there is no convincing evidence that would suggest this is true. Thus, my findings suggest that many corporations use ?diversity? as a shield to hide the fact that nothing has really changed in the structure of U. S corporations. That is, U.

An Australian survey by BIS Shrapnel (1993) found that nationwide there are 12, 000 independent take away food outlets, and 2, 000 take away chain food stores. However, despite being a primary source of unhealthy foods for many individuals, the literature shows a surprising lack of any study conceming intervention with respect to take away food outlets. This study was undertaken to develop a baseline level of information regarding the types of food sold, current preparation and cooking practices in take away food outlets. Information was also sought to develop an understanding of the characteristics of the customers and owners of take away food outlets, including their attitudes towards health, as well as the business itself Data was collected by face to face interviews with <b>outlet</b> owners or <b>managers,</b> using a structured questionnaire, which contained both open and closed questions. The questionnaire included sections focussing on foods sold, common food preparation methods, customers, owners, the business, and the possibility of working with health promotion units. Data collected enabled a baseline level of descriptive information to be compiled regarding take away food outlets. Results of types of food sold and preparation methods indicate that most foods available at take away food outlets are high fat foods. Although there are some healthy food options offered at take away food outlets they tend to be less frequently available.

40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} to University of Manchester for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy in the Faculty of Business Administration. A major {{aim of this study}} is to offer a relatively comprehensive picture of marketing channel behaviour and performance. Given the statistical difficulties in testing a very large, comprehensive model to achieve this aim, two separate but overlapping models are proposed. One model specifically addresses behaviour in marketing channels, while the other integrates key behavioural outcomes with objective measures of performance. Within the second model the personalities of key boundary managers are introduced to help explain the linkages between the behavioural outcomes and economic outcomes. Empirical research to test the models was undertaken in one large marketing channel­ Post Office Counters Ltd. (POCL). This research focuses on privately owned agencies-the sub-post office [...] and only those with a viable second business. The marketing channel is otherwise similar in form to many franchises and agencies. The agents are owners-managers of small businesses in which they are the key decision makers. POCL provided a sample of 2, 400 post offices with a second viable business. The research followed a dyadic design. A self-completion questionnaire, which had been previously validated, was sent to the sub-postmaster in each <b>outlet.</b> The area <b>manager</b> acting on behalf of the principal for each of the outlets for which a return was received was sent a mirror image questionnaire (the same questionnaire about the relationship but rephrased to be relevant to the principal). A total of 497 cases that contained complete data for the dyad represent the sample used in this study. The questionnaire was designed to measure a number of constructs. These were: the satisfaction of the sub-postmaster- the agent- with the overall channel relationship; the balance of power in their relationship with POCL-the principal; wh ther POCL were using power coercively or non-coercively; trust (using two measures, honesty and benevolence); conflict, and the personality of both the agent and the area manager. Conflict is treated as a dyadic measure. The personality instrument was the NEO Five­ Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI; Costa and McCrae 1992), a standard, well-validated personality test. This assesses the five broad dimensions of personality: Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness to Experience, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness. Two measures of performance-business and operational-were computed. based on data supplied by Post Office Counters Limited. Structural Equation Modelling was used to test the two hypothesised models and to obtain robust information about how constructs interrelate. The behavioural model adds to the streams of research on power and on trust. Past research on trust has emphasised the investigation of antecedents other than that of power structure and power use. The present study has extended the knowledge of the impact of power (power asymmetry, coercive power, and non-coercive power) on critical behavioural outcomes-co-operation, conflict, and satisfaction-by showing that trust is an important mediating variable. The second model, the model of channel member behaviour and performance also makes several contributions to the channels literature. One is to play a part in the integration of the economic and the behavioural perspectives on the channels literature. The work is unique in that it combines the channels literature with the personality and industrial/organisational psychology literatures to improve the understanding of channel phenomena. The main contribution of this study is the confirmation that the personality traits (Openness to Experience, Extraversion, and Agreeableness) of key interface managers helps to explain channel member satisfaction, conflict, and performance. Concretely, the personality dimension Agreeableness proved useful to help explain the controversial link between conflict and performance. The findings reveal that personality is relevant to help predict not only the attitudes and behaviour of channel members, but also objective, non-perceptual and non-self reported dimensions of performance (e. g., sales growth) ...|$|R
