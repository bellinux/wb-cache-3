6000|$|... "So," [...] responded Mr. Beach, [...] "I {{have been}} informed." [...] He brooded for a space. [...] "I, too," [...] he proceeded, [...] "suffer from my stomach. I have a weak stomach. The lining <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>stomach</b> {{is not what}} I could wish the lining <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>stomach</b> to be." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{that is most}} curious now! I wear {{an order}} over the pit <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>stomach!</b> I think that is very curious: a curious place to wear an order." ...|$|E
60|$|Ah! Ow! Don't be talking! I {{was blue}} mouldy for the want of that pint. Declare to God I {{could hear it}} hit the pit <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>stomach</b> with a click.|$|E
6000|$|... "I gotcha Steve," [...] said Billy; [...] "go to it; but first, stake me to a feed. The {{front side}} <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>stomach's</b> wrapped around <b>my</b> back bone." ...|$|R
50|$|References to Bath buns {{date from}} 1763, and Jane Austen {{wrote in a}} letter <b>of</b> 'disordering <b>my</b> <b>stomach</b> with Bath Bunns' in 1801. The {{original}} 18th-century recipe used a brioche or rich egg and butter dough which was then covered with caraway seeds coated in several layers of sugar similar to French dragée.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I've {{neglected}} {{the warnings}} <b>of</b> <b>my</b> lord the <b>stomach</b> too long. Hence these spots before the eyes, Binkie. I can see {{as well as}} I ever could.' ...|$|R
60|$|For all {{the pains}} that my infirmities ever brought upon me were never half so grievous an affliction to me, as the {{unavoidable}} loss of my time, which they occasioned. I could not bear, through the weakness <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>stomach,</b> to rise before seven {{o'clock in the}} morning, &c.|$|E
60|$|The long, intense, soul-trying {{scrutiny}} this brutal wretch had subjected me to {{came to a}} very sudden end. Quick as lightning a long, broad knife flashed {{out from}} its concealment under his poncho, and with one cat-like bound he was before me, the point of his horrid weapon touching my poncho just over the pit <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>stomach.</b>|$|E
60|$|I {{knew the}} debilitated state <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>stomach,</b> and I ate {{sparingly}} {{in the knowledge}} that my natural voracity would surely kill me did I yield myself to it. Never had sweeter morsels passed my lips, and I make free to confess that I shed tears of joy, again and again, at contemplation of that putrefied carcass.|$|E
6000|$|... "I then pass to {{the back}} of the stage and lie down on <b>my</b> <b>stomach,</b> still holding the skull before my eyes. After holding this posture for some time, I crawl slowly forward, portraying by the {{movement}} <b>of</b> <b>my</b> legs and <b>stomach</b> the whole sad history of Yorick. Finally I turn my back on the audience, still holding the skull, and convey through the spasmodic movements <b>of</b> <b>my</b> back Hamlet's passionate grief at the loss of his friend." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{not sure}} it was wholly {{fortunate}} for me," [...] he said, [...] "although I admit I have no wish to end my uninteresting life by drowning. I am not a misanthrope, in spite <b>of</b> <b>my</b> bad <b>stomach.</b> The world is more useful to me than I am to the world, {{but that is not}} my fault. Pardon me for talking so much about myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I say, cumber not {{yourself}} about it, father," [...] answered Howleglas, [...] "but {{move off}} with your train, male and female, or I will not undertake to save yonder she-saint from the ducking-stool--And as for bearing <b>of</b> malice, <b>my</b> <b>stomach</b> has {{no room for}} it; it is," [...] he added, clapping {{his hand on his}} portly belly, [...] "too well bumbasted out with straw and buckram--gramercy to them both--they kept out that madcap's dagger as well as a Milan corslet could have done." ...|$|R
60|$|If {{you could}} bring me some wine when you come, 'twould {{be a good}} move: I fear vin d'Anstruther; and having {{procured}} myself a severe attack of gripes by two days' total abstinence on chilly table beer I {{have been forced to}} purchase Green Ginger ("Somebody or other's 'celebrated'"), for the benefit <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>stomach,</b> like St. Paul.|$|E
60|$|First of all, I must beg {{forgiveness}} {{of my body}} for the vileness through which I have dragged it, and forgiveness <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>stomach</b> for the vileness which I have thrust into it. I {{have been to the}} spike, and slept in the spike, and eaten in the spike; also, I have run away from the spike.|$|E
60|$|A {{distrust}} of myself, which has often beset me in life on small occasions, {{when it would}} have been better away, was assuredly not stopped in its growth by this little incident outside the Canterbury coach. It was in vain to take refuge in gruffness of speech. I spoke from the pit <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>stomach</b> for the rest of the journey, but I felt completely extinguished, and dreadfully young.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah me!" [...] she said, {{turning the}} {{miniature}} round {{on her wrist}} till {{it was out of}} sight. [...] "What animals we are, after all! The spiritual part of us is at the mercy <b>of</b> the <b>stomach.</b> <b>My</b> heart is absorbed by tender thoughts, yet I am not the less ready for luncheon! Come, my children and fellow-mortals. Allons cultiver notre jardin!" ...|$|R
60|$|Warn. Good old sir, be pacified; I {{was pouring}} {{out a little}} of the dregs that I had left in me <b>of</b> <b>my</b> former service, and now they are gone, <b>my</b> <b>stomach's</b> clear <b>of</b> them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Poison, do {{you call}} it?" [...] quoth the grim doctor. [...] "That's entirely {{as it may be}} used. Doubtless his bite would send a man to kingdom come; but, on the other hand, no one need want a better life-line than that fellow's web. He and I are firm friends, and I believe he would know my enemies by instinct. But come, sit down, and take a glass of brandy. No? Well, I'll drink it for you. And how is the old aunt yonder, with her infernal nostrum, the {{bitterness}} and nauseousness <b>of</b> which <b>my</b> poor <b>stomach</b> has not yet forgotten?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{is a black}} gate, if {{you speak}} {{according}} to the letter," [...] answered Richie; [...] "but if metaphorically, there are worse places in this great city than the Devil Tavern; and I care not if I go thither with you, and bestow a pottle of burnt sack on you--it will correct the crudities <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>stomach,</b> and form a gentle preparative for the leg of a cold pullet." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{sat down}} on a stone, with a sigh, and by a natural impulse one of my hands sought my forehead, and the other the base <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>stomach.</b> I believe I never appreciated, till then, the poverty of the human machinery--for I still needed a hand or two to place elsewhere. Pen cannot {{describe}} how I was jolted up. Imagination cannot conceive how disjointed I was--how internally, externally and universally I was unsettled, mixed up and ruptured. There was a sympathetic crowd around me, though.|$|E
6000|$|... "Does it? Well, let me {{tell you}} that it isn't so thin as you suppose, for it's what you will {{actually}} have to do most nights. Two nights out of three I have to be read to sleep. My indigestion gives me insomnia." [...] As though to push this fact home, Mr. Peters suddenly bent double. [...] "Oof!" [...] he said. [...] "Wow!" [...] He removed the cigar from his mouth and inserted a digestive tabloid. [...] "The lining <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>stomach</b> is all wrong," [...] he added.|$|E
5000|$|... "It was a {{new kind}} of agony for me. My head was exploding, <b>my</b> <b>stomach</b> ripping and even the tips <b>of</b> <b>my</b> fingers ached. The only thing I could think was, 'If I live, I will never run again.'" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I was neck-deep {{in western}} rock, but [...] "eastern"-sounding melodies always got to me. In particular, the soaring majestic violin solo of Aboud Abdel Al on Killing Joke's song [...] "Communion". It {{never failed to}} unleash a torrent <b>of</b> {{butterflies}} in <b>my</b> <b>stomach</b> - the kind of deep, nervous, painful longing you only feel when you are stupidly {{in love with a}} girl you cannot have. Why did that violin make me feel that way? And more importantly, how do you play a melody like that?" [...] Khyam Allami on reconnecting with his musical roots. However, Allami had remained interested in the music of the Middle East, which had continued to inspire him throughout his time in rock bands. In 2002, he began to experiment with playing the oud, but his initial attempts were unsuccessful and he gave up after a few weeks.|$|R
30|$|<b>My</b> <b>stomach</b> is showing, so I {{just get}} the one piece but <b>my</b> <b>stomach</b> still shows. You can see my rolls {{in the back and}} I don’t like that so I just try to put stuff over so you don’t see.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{not going}} to cry, Mrs. Dr. dear, and that you may tie to, but whether I shall manage to smile or not will be as Providence ordains and as the pit <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>stomach</b> feels. Have you room there for this fruit-cake? And the shortbread? And the mince-pie? That blessed boy shall not starve, whether they have {{anything}} to eat in that Quebec place or not. Everything seems to be changing all at once, does it not? Even the old cat at the manse has passed away. He breathed his last at a quarter to ten last night and Bruce is quite heart-broken, they tell me." ...|$|E
60|$|And sure enough, {{the moment}} her bows passed beyond the pier, the sea struck her, and tossed her like an eggshell, and the deck, from stem to stern, was drenched in a moment, and running with floods {{as if she}} had been under water. For a few moments H. and I both enjoyed the motion. We stood amidships, she in her shawl, I in a great {{tarpauling}} which I had borrowed of Jack, and every pitch sent the spray over us. We exulted that we were not going to be sick. Suddenly, however, so suddenly that it was quite mysterious, conscience smote me. A profound, a deep-seated remorse developed itself just exactly in the deepest centre of the pit <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>stomach.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "What do ye want?" [...] says he. [...] "A {{man should}} aye put his best foot forrit with the womenkind; he should aye {{give them a}} bit of a story to divert them, the poor lambs! It's what ye should learn to attend to, David; ye should get the principles, it's like a trade. Now, if this had been a young lassie, or onyways bonnie, she would never have heard tell <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>stomach,</b> Davie. But aince they're too old to be seeking joes, they a' set up to be apotecaries. Why? What do I ken? They'll be just the way God made them, I suppose. But I think a man would be a gomeral that didnae give his {{attention}} to the same." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I {{was young}}... once. I was young twelve years ago, and I had hair on top <b>of</b> <b>my</b> head, and <b>my</b> <b>stomach</b> was lean as a runner's, and the longest day was none {{too long for}} me. I was a husky back there in '98. You {{remember}} me, Milner. You knew me then. Wasn't I a pretty good bit of all right?" ...|$|R
50|$|Nineteen, twenty, <b>my</b> <b>stomach's</b> empty.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will think}} {{all this is}} awful grousing, but the point I want to make--I hereby to ease my {{feelings}} make it now in a fair round hand--is that all this business could be done far better and far cheaper if it wasn't left to these absolutely inexperienced and extremely exclusive military gentlemen. They think they are leading England and showing us all how; instead {{of which they are}} just keeping us back. Why in thunder are they doing everything? Not one of them, when he is at home, is allowed to order the dinner or poke his nose into his own kitchen or check the household books.... The ordinary British colonel is a helpless old gentleman; he ought to have a nurse.... This is not merely the trivial grievance <b>of</b> <b>my</b> insulted <b>stomach,</b> it is a serious matter for the country. Sooner or later the country may want the food that is being wasted in all these capers. In the aggregate it must amount to a daily destruction of tons of stuff of all sorts. Tons.... Suppose the war lasts longer than we reckon!" ...|$|R
60|$|Now I was {{so clean}} of alcohol {{that even a}} single {{cocktail}} was provocative of pitch. A single cocktail would glow the mind and tickle a laugh for the few minutes prior to sitting down to table and starting the delightful process of eating. On the other hand, such was the strength <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>stomach,</b> of my alcoholic resistance, that the single cocktail was only the glimmer of a glow, the faintest tickle of a laugh. One day, a friend frankly and shamelessly suggested a second cocktail. I drank the second one with him. The glow was appreciably longer and warmer, the laughter deeper and more resonant. One does not forget such experiences. Sometimes I almost {{think that it was}} because I was so very happy that I started on my real drinking.|$|E
60|$|Then came another {{stirring}} of Wolf Larsen’s tremendous strength. It {{was utterly}} unexpected, {{and it was}} {{over and done with}} between the ticks of two seconds. He had sprung fully six feet across the deck and driven his fist into the other’s stomach. At the same moment, as though I had been struck myself, I felt a sickening shock in the pit <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>stomach.</b> I instance this to show the sensitiveness of my nervous organization at the time, and how unused I was to spectacles of brutality. The cabin-boy—and he weighed one hundred and sixty-five at the very least—crumpled up. His body wrapped limply about the fist like a wet rag about a stick. He lifted into the air, described a short curve, and struck the deck alongside the corpse on his head and shoulders, where he lay and writhed about in agony.|$|E
6000|$|Mourner laughed. It was {{the softest}} of little cooing laughs, very {{pleasant}} to hear. [...] "I {{see that as}} usual you are judging others by yourself," [...] said he. [...] "You ought to know by this time {{that you can do}} nothing more foolish. I haven't the least doubt that a breakfast of gravel would give you the worst kind of a stomach-ache. But you are you and I am I, and there is {{all the difference in the}} world. You know I eat grain and hard seeds. Not having any teeth I have to swallow them whole. One part <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>stomach</b> is called a gizzard and its duty is to grind and crush my food so that it may be digested. Tiny pebbles and gravel help grind the food and so aid digestion. I think I've got enough now for this morning, and it is time for a dust bath. There is a dusty spot over in the lane where I take a dust bath every day." ...|$|E
40|$|I {{lean forward}} {{and as we}} flip through the air, <b>my</b> <b>stomach</b> leaves <b>my</b> body. I am free falling, plummeting to the earth at 120 miles per hour. An inexplicable feeling of invincibility mixed with a humbling sense <b>of</b> <b>my</b> {{mortality}} wash over me. Intense adrenaline rushes out every extremity. Somehow, {{there is a huge}} grin on my face which wouldn’t disappear until long after I arrived back on the ground...|$|R
6000|$|... 'He {{talks to}} me then and there. No shouting, no {{swearing}} (it was too bad for that); but good, memorable counsel, bitten in slowly. Then he sets me to draft {{out a pair of}} iron gates, to take, as he said, the taste <b>of</b> <b>my</b> naughty dolphins out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mouth. Iron's sweet stuff if you don't torture her, and hammered work is all pure, truthful line, with a reason and a support for every curve and bar of it. A week at that settled <b>my</b> <b>stomach</b> handsomely, and the Master let me put the work through the smithy, where I sweated out more <b>of</b> <b>my</b> foolish pride.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You can't make me angry." [...] Al {{smiled with}} cunning, and glanced triumphantly at his wife. [...] "You can't make me angry," [...] he repeated, {{as though the}} idea were {{thoroughly}} gratifying to him. [...] "I know your game. It's <b>my</b> <b>stomach,</b> I tell you. I can't help it. Before God, I can't! Isn't it <b>my</b> <b>stomach,</b> Mary?" ...|$|R
