2500|$|As {{a company}} nears insolvency, UK law {{provides}} four main procedures {{by which the}} company could potentially be rescued or wound down and its assets distributed. First, a company voluntary arrangement, allows the directors of a company {{to reach an agreement}} with creditors to potentially accept less repayment in the hope of avoiding a more costly administration or liquidation procedure and less in returns overall. However, only for small private companies is a statutory moratorium on debt collection by secured creditors available. Second, and since the Enterprise Act 2002 the preferred insolvency procedure, a company which is insolvent can go under administration. Here a qualified insolvency practitioner will replace the board of directors and is charged with a public duty of rescuing the company in the interests of all creditors, rescuing the business through a sale, getting a better result for creditors than immediate liquidation, or if nothing can be done effecting an <b>orderly</b> <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> and distribution of assets. Third, administrative receivership is a procedure available for a fixed list of eight kinds of operation (such as public-private partnerships, utility projects and protected railway companies) where the insolvency practitioner is appointed by the holder of a floating charge that covers a company's whole assets. This stems from common law receivership where the insolvency practitioner's primary duty was owed to the creditor that appointed him. After the Insolvency Act 1986 it was increasingly viewed to be unacceptable that one creditor could manage a company when the interests of her creditor might conflict with those holding unsecured or other debts. Fourth, when none of these procedures is used, the business is wound up and a company's assets are to be broken up and sold off, a liquidator is appointed. All procedures must be overseen by a qualified insolvency practitioner. While liquidation remains the most frequent end for an insolvent company, UK law since the Cork Report has aimed to cultivate a [...] "rescue culture" [...] to save companies that could be viable.|$|E

The final sweepstake was held in January 1986 and the company was unsuccessful for a licence bid for the Irish National Lottery, which was won by An Post later that year.

5000|$|Their Lordships {{felt that}} it was clear from Lord Goff's {{formulation}} that he was making the same distinction as Lord Cranworth had made in Carron Iron between cases such as the insolvency cases, in which there is an equitable jurisdiction to enforce the statutory scheme of distribution according to its terms, and cases in which the court intervenes on the ground of vexation or oppression. The Privy Council also reflected upon its recent decision in Singularis Holdings Ltd v PriceWaterhouseCoopers where it was held that there is a broader public interest in the ability of a court exercising insolvency jurisdiction in the place of the company's incorporation to conduct an <b>orderly</b> <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> of its affairs on a world-wide basis, notwithstanding the territorial limits of its jurisdiction. In such cases [...] "the court is not standing on its dignity", but it intervenes because the proper distribution of the company's assets depends upon its ability to get in those assets so that comparable claims to them may be dealt with fairly in accordance with a common set of rules applying equally to all of them, and there is no jurisdiction other than that of the insolvent's domicile in which that result can be achieved.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims {{to analyse}} the pari passu {{principle}} of insolvency law (which provides that the creditors {{of a company}} in liquidation are to be paid rateably), and to ask how it relates to other principles available {{for the treatment of}} claims in corporate liquidation. The discussion reveals that the principle has rather limited effect in governing distributions of the insolvent 2 ̆ 7 s estate. Not only do various types of secured claim fall beyond its ambit, even unsecured claims are often exempt from its application. Nevertheless, the principle thrives both in judicial rhetoric and in academic arguments. For example, many a challenge to the different priorities accorded to different types of claim in a company 2 ̆ 7 s insolvency begins with an incantation of the pari passu principle. Commentators see an inherent tension between the 2 ̆ 7 two fundamental principles of credit and insolvency law 2 ̆ 7, that of the freedom of contract which allows one to bargain for priority, and the mandatory pari passu principle. The pari passu principle is said to be 2 ̆ 7 the foremost principle in the law of insolvency around the world 2 ̆ 7. It is thought to be 2 ̆ 7 all-pervasive 2 ̆ 7, and its effect is to 2 ̆ 7 strike down all agreements which have as their object or result the unfair preference of a particular creditor by removal from the estate on winding up of an asset that would otherwise have been available for the general body of creditors. 2 ̆ 7 The principle is said to be supported both by the need for an orderly liquidation of insolvents 2 ̆ 7 estates, and by requirements of fairness. So {{it is not surprising that}} its invocation as the starting point for, say, the debate on the priority of secured or preferential claims, weights the argument in a particular way. Since the pari passu principle has been recognised so widely and for so long as vital, and since it serves such desirable aims as orderliness in liquidation and fairness to all creditors, any deviation from it must be a cause for concern. On this view, the priority (say) of secured or preferential claims is an abnormality, a pathology to be diagnosed and controlled, perhaps even 2 ̆ 7 cured 2 ̆ 7. Since 2 ̆ 7 equality 2 ̆ 7 is the norm, the onus must be on those supporting differing priorities to justify their claim. To the extent that their efforts are unpersuasive, the case for priority must be considered not established, and the 2 ̆ 7 default principle 2 ̆ 7 of 2 ̆ 7 equality 2 ̆ 7 must prevail. This paper seeks to overturn this order of things. It is suggested the pari passu principle does not constitute an accurate description of how the assets of insolvent companies are in fact distributed, has no role to play in ensuring an <b>orderly</b> <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> of such companies, does not explain or justify distinctive features of the formal insolvency regime, and has little to do with fairness in liquidation. The actual role of the principle, it is argued, is merely to provide a low-cost method for dealing with those types of claim which both Parliament and commercial parties themselves have decided should receive little or nothing in most insolvencies. The principle, long regarded as the core distributional principle in corporate liquidation, is more properly understood as a principle of non-distribution. To the extent that these arguments succeed, the initial onus of justifying their position shifts from those arguing in favour of the priority of secured credit, to those who support a more 2 ̆ 7 equal 2 ̆ 7 distribution of the insolvent 2 ̆ 7 s estate...|$|E
