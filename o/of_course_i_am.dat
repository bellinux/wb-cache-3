25|$|If {{you wish}} you may tell the police {{to be careful not}} to rile me. <b>Of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a {{reasonable}} spirit. I take no offense at the way they have conducted their investigations in the past. In fact, they have been so utterly stupid as to not only amuse me, but His Satanic Majesty, Francis Josef, etc. But tell them to beware. Let them not try to discover what I am, for it were better that they were never born than to incur the wrath of the Axeman. I don't think there is any need of such a warning, for I feel sure the police will always dodge me, as they have in the past. They are wise and know how to keep away from all harm.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{following}} year potato blight brought famine which impinged on the Darwins' servants and workmen, and led to overthrow of the Corn Laws. Darwin welcomed this, but as a landowner now found that it affected his income from rent and {{he wrote to his}} agent that [...] "Although I am on principle a free-trader, <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not willing to make a larger reduction than necessary to retain a good tenant." [...] Despite his own illness recurring, Darwin pressed on with South America, having to jointly subsidise it with the publisher when the Treasury grant ran out, and it was completed by October 1846.|$|E
60|$|LORD GORING. He {{walks in}} the mire. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> only talking {{generally}} about life.|$|E
60|$|<b>Of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{invited to}} the wedding. After the {{ceremony}} I dragged Lathrop aside.|$|R
60|$|<b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> complimented, {{but felt}} bound {{to point out}} Hans's share in our joint achievement.|$|R
60|$|STEPHEN. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{thinking}} only <b>of</b> his income. However, he is {{not likely}} to be extravagant.|$|R
60|$|I {{have not}} heard from Higgins, but <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> ready {{to serve on the}} Committee.|$|E
60|$|You said I must be {{very sure}} of my complexion. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> Here it is.|$|E
60|$|MRS. COADE. Wasn't there a Lob in Shakespeare? No, <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{thinking}} of Robin Goodfellow.|$|E
60|$|<b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{delighted to}} hear that this charming lady was to be my fellow-auditor, and said so.|$|R
6000|$|... "All {{those things}} <b>are</b> very bad <b>of</b> <b>course.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> very much grieved,--because you {{have both been}} {{intimate}} friends of mine." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> glad to {{have such}} an {{opportunity}} of acquiring knowledge, and professed myself delighted to receive my uncle's instruction.|$|R
6000|$|... "You whet my curiosity, monsieur; and, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a dutiful niece. It {{follows that}} I shall be honoured to receive you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What do you think? <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> I'm {{not going}} to have any of Appleby's crew coming into Seymour's and ragging studies." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'A really curious resemblance. <b>Of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{speaking}} only from memory; and perhaps it's {{not quite so}} vivid in this light; but still astonishingly clear.' ...|$|E
6000|$|He became {{instantly}} contrite. [...] "There, now, don't {{you mind}} my joking. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> fooling. It's all safe between us, anyway." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Great Heavens!" [...] cried Kemp. [...] "Of <b>course,</b> <b>of</b> <b>course!</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{thinking}} {{only last}} night of the sea larvae and all jelly-fish!" ...|$|R
6000|$|NORA. Oh, {{you came}} to see the tower. I thought--[confused, trying to recover her manners] Oh, <b>of</b> <b>course.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> so startled--It's a {{beautiful}} night, isn't it? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, it {{does seem}} odd," [...] agreed the flustered Godfrey, [...] "but it's lucky, isn't it, for, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> glad to see her again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear mother wished {{me to be}} {{with her}} friends, nor can the King's {{appointment}} be neglected, though <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> extremely grieved to go." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I mean it {{on every}} ground," [...] said Mr. Turnbull, rising {{on his legs}} and {{standing}} {{with his back to}} the fire. [...] "Of course I am not fit to have diplomatic intercourse with men who would come to me simply with the desire of deceiving me. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> unfit to deal with members of Parliament who would flock around me because they wanted places. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> unfit to answer every man's question so as to give no information to any one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'How {{extremely}} diplomatic! The attach√© in {{your very}} air. <b>I</b> thought, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> to surprise you; but future ambassadors have such extraordinary sources of information.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The younger ones, <b>of</b> <b>course.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{in hopes}} that Aubrey {{would have been more}} like old June, but he'll never be so much of a fellow.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> highly {{delighted with}} the success of my search, and as I brought forth the pocketbook all the others gave a cry of surprise.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, you were. You were {{soft and}} gracious,--gracious for you, at least. And now, dear, do {{tell me about}} it. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> dying to know." ...|$|E
60|$|GERALD. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> It means {{everything}} to me - things that {{were out of the}} reach of hope before may be within hope's reach now.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No!' {{said the}} yeoman, his face again in flames. 'Why, <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> only {{telling you what}} would be the word of command if--there now! you la--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>was.</b> <b>Of</b> that lovely self-trimming on that {{cashmere}} {{dress of}} the lady {{that came with}} Miss Manners. What--what are you laughing at, Grace?" ...|$|R
60|$|MRS. JONES. Yes, sir, <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>'m</b> afraid <b>of</b> what {{he might}} do to me if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> to leave him; he can be so very violent.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well; I {{must ask}} you to forget it. <b>Of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> wrong, but I'll try not to vex you again. What {{are we going to}} do now?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The {{secret of}} the true authorship {{of the book is}} out at last, and it is Ethelberta <b>of</b> <b>course.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> so glad to have it proved hers.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Alive? <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>am!</b> You don't suppose I {{am going}} to be frightened at a lot of bats? There, look at them, they are still {{streaming}} out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am glad to}} see you again, Joe, and I am glad to {{hear you}} are first mate now; though <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sorry for Mr. Probert." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he confessed, [...] "I have {{certainly}} <b>been</b> shamefully remiss. <b>Of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> busy {{from dawn to}} sunset, but, after all, I'm afraid that is really no excuse." ...|$|R
60|$|LORD ILLINGWORTH. Oh, duty is {{what one}} expects from others, {{it is not}} what one does oneself. <b>Of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{influenced}} by my mother. Every man is when he is young.|$|R
60|$|<b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{described}} also as an Englishman. Miss Haldin spoke rapidly, {{faster than}} I {{have ever heard}} her speak, and that by contrast made the quietness of her eyes more expressive.|$|R
