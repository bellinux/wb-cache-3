5|$|The Bahraini Economic Vision 2030 {{published}} in 2008 {{does not indicate}} how the stated goal of shifting from an economy built on oil wealth to a productive, globally competitive economy will be attained. Bahrain has already diversified its exports to some extent, out of necessity. It has the smallest hydrocarbon reserves of any Gulf state, producing 48,000 barrels per day from its one onshore field. The bulk of the country’s revenue comes from its share in the <b>offshore</b> <b>field</b> administered by Saudi Arabia. The gas reserve in Bahrain is expected to last for less than 27 years, leaving the country with few sources of capital to pursue {{the development of new}} industries. Investment in research and development remained very low in 2013.|$|E

25|$|A similar {{process had}} taken place with American oil {{companies}} in Venezuela a few years earlier. The American government granted US Aramco member companies a tax break known as the golden gimmick equivalent to the profits given to King Abdulaziz. In {{the wake of the}} new arrangement, the company's headquarters were moved from New York to Dhahran. In 1951, the company discovered the Safaniya Oil Field, the world's largest <b>offshore</b> <b>field.</b> In 1957, the discovery of smaller connected oil fields confirmed the Ghawar Field as the world's largest onshore field.|$|E

Two examples are the Baird and the Deborah Gas Storage projects.|$|R
30|$|For <b>offshore</b> <b>fields,</b> {{sea water}} is usually {{available}} for preparing polymer solution. Test data from Dalia <b>field</b> <b>offshore</b> Angola showed that PAM viscosity decreased rapidly with increase in water salinity. Moreover, shearing at the wellhead chokes caused 25 – 50 % of loss in polymer viscosity (Morel et al. 2008).|$|R
