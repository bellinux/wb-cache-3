25|$|In 1864, Hubbard {{became an}} Anglican deaconess and became {{active in the}} deaconess {{movement}} after a friend introduced her to the society. The movement, which had been present in the Anglican church since 1850, focused on providing community life for women and training them work with the poor as nurses or teachers. She began serving with the society and organized a number of gatherings. In 1871, she published a pamphlet entitled Anglican Deaconesses; <b>or</b> <b>Is</b> <b>There</b> No Place for Women in the Parochial System? This work contained descriptions of meetings that she had with church leaders, including Harold Browne. She also met with potential donors {{to tell them about}} the movement. She also published a letter in John Bull detailing the aims of the movement. However, she later became discouraged by the slow pace of growth that came to characterise the movement. She ceased active involvement with the group in 1874.|$|E

On the {{structure}} of the season and shifting the focus between the two parts, Bell stated it was the intent to follow the format from season two, by tying [...] "a whole bunch of [...] but not all of them off by the midseason. And then we launch something exciting for the back half...the promise of more to come." [...] Whedon added that [...] "though we do break the season up, we feel that the season as a whole is one arc" [...] and so the series would explore the same themes in the second half, [...] "themes {{of what it means to}} be human and Inhuman. What does it mean to all these people when they have to live with their actions? Are they capable of the things their enemies are capable of?...What is the true nature of a person? Is everybody capable of everything if put in a terrible position? <b>Or</b> <b>is</b> <b>there</b> true good and a true evil?" [...] The second half of the season sees the introduction of the comics' right-wing hate group the Watchdogs, depicted as radicals wishing to [...] "eliminate the Inhumans", as well as a [...] "cure" [...] that can prevent terrigenisis in yet-to-transition Inhumans.|$|E

500|$|In the Hebrew Bible, {{there are}} thirty-five verses which mention salt. One of these {{mentions}} Lot's wife, who {{was turned into}} a pillar of salt when she looked back at the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 19:26) as they were destroyed. When the judge Abimelech destroyed the city of Shechem, he is said to have [...] "sown salt on it," [...] probably as a curse on anyone who would re-inhabit it (Judges 9:45). The Book of Job contains the first mention of salt as a condiment. [...] "Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>there</b> any taste in the white of an egg?" [...] (Job 6:6). In the New Testament, six verses mention salt. In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus referred to his followers as the [...] "salt of the earth". The apostle Paul also encouraged Christians to [...] "let your conversation be always full of grace, seasoned with salt" [...] (Colossians 4:6). Salt is mandatory in the rite of the Tridentine Mass. Salt is used in the third item (which includes an Exorcism) of the Celtic Consecration (cf. Gallican Rite) that is employed in the consecration of a church. Salt may be added to the water [...] "where it is customary" [...] in the Roman Catholic rite of Holy water.|$|E
