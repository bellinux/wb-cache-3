5|$|Either way, {{many of the}} {{countries}} involved in the crisis are on the euro, so devaluation, individual interest rates, and capital controls are not available. The only solution left to raise a country's level <b>of</b> <b>saving</b> is to reduce budget deficits and to change consumption and savings habits. For example, if a country's citizens saved more instead of consuming imports, this would reduce its trade deficit. It has therefore been suggested that countries with large trade deficits (e.g., Greece) consume less and improve their exporting industries.|$|E

One of the justices in attendance also said that this evidence invalidated the findings of the jury in the first trial, as the jury had heard testimony that the water shortage resulted from the poor condition of the ship, brought on by unforeseen maritime conditions, rather than from errors committed by its captain.

Twenty-nine different weather years {{were used to}} obtain a set <b>of</b> <b>savings</b> results under each method. Variability <b>of</b> <b>savings</b> was quantified by the average standard deviation of the 29 percent savings results across all post-commissioning periods for each method. For the combined chilled and hot water savings, the average standard deviation is 0. 39 % savings for Option D using the NAC weather normalization approach, 0. 57 % savings for Option D using the standard IPMVP weather normalization approach, 0. 71 % savings for Option C with regression models using the NAC weather normalization approach, and 0. 98 % savings for Option C with regression models using the standard IPMVP weather normalization approach. The variability <b>of</b> <b>savings</b> persistence results deviate a little from variability <b>of</b> <b>savings</b> results. For the combined chilled and hot water persistence <b>of</b> <b>savings,</b> the average standard deviation across all post-commissioning periods is 0. 48 % persistence for Option D using the NAC weather normalization approach, 0. 55 % persistence for Option D using the standard IPMVP weather normalization approach, 0. 52 % persistence for Option C with regression models using the NAC weather normalization approach, and 1. 26 % persistence for Option C with regression models using the standard IPMVP weather normalization approach. Overall, the NAC weather normalization approach shows less variability in savings and persistence than the standard IPMVP weather normalization approach. Additionally, Option D of the IPMVP generally shows less variability in <b>savings</b> and persistence <b>of</b> <b>savings</b> than Option C with regression models. This thesis also determines the <b>savings</b> and persistence <b>of</b> <b>savings</b> from commissioning for three Texas A&M University buildings.

5|$|BioShock {{is set in}} 1960. The player {{guides the}} protagonist, Jack, after his {{airplane}} crashes in the ocean near the bathysphere terminus {{that leads to the}} underwater city of Rapture. Built by the business magnate Andrew Ryan, the city was intended to be an isolated utopia, but the discovery of ADAM, a genetic material which can be used to grant superhuman powers, initiated the city's turbulent decline. Jack tries {{to find a way to}} escape, fighting through hordes of ADAM-obsessed enemies, and the iconic, deadly Big Daddies, while engaging with the few sane humans that remain and eventually learning of Rapture's past. The player, as Jack, is able to defeat foes in a number of ways by using weapons, utilizing plasmids that give unique powers, and by turning Rapture's own defenses against them. BioShock includes elements of role-playing games, giving the player different approaches in engaging enemies such as by stealth, as well as moral choices <b>of</b> <b>saving</b> or killing characters; additionally, the game and biopunk theme borrow concepts from the survival horror genre.|$|E

Points are awarded for the following: leaping over obstacles; destroying objects with a hammer power-up; collecting items such as hats, parasols, and purses (presumably belonging to Pauline); removing rivets from platforms; and completing each stage (determined by a steadily decreasing bonus counter). The player typically receives three lives with a bonus awarded for the first 7,000 points, although this can be modified via the game's built in DIP switches. One life is lost whenever Mario touches Donkey Kong or any enemy object, falls too far through a gap or off the end of a platform, or lets the bonus counter reach zero.|$|E

5|$|In Reformed theology, sacraments {{are held}} to be, along with the word of God preached, the means of grace. In the sacraments, God graciously condescends to use common {{material}} objects to communicate divine promises to people. The grace promised consists not only in benefits which God bestows on people, but Christ's person himself, to whom God unites the believer. Sacraments confirm or ratify the promises communicated in preaching. Both preaching and the sacraments are not merely symbolic and representative of the reality to which they refer, but actually create the reality <b>of</b> <b>saving</b> grace. The sacraments are made efficacious by the Holy Spirit in actually bringing into effect the promises signified in the sacraments. This efficacy is only beneficial, however, {{for those who have}} faith. The sacrament remains efficacious regardless of the recipient's response. Its effect is negative, resulting in judgement, for the faithless; while it confers Christ and his benefits for the faithful.|$|E

The results show that there is no shift in the growth rate <b>of</b> the domestic <b>savings</b> both at aggregate and disaggregate levels during post economic reform period. However there has been acceleration in the growth rates <b>of</b> domestic <b>savings</b> <b>of</b> household and private sectors and deceleration in public sector during 1950 [...] 2002. The estimate of constant income elasticity <b>of</b> household <b>savings</b> is found to be more than unity implying that the marginal propensity to save is higher than the average propensity to save, all else equal. Further the constant income elasticity <b>of</b> household <b>savings</b> is moderately higher than that of the income elasticities <b>of</b> domestic <b>savings</b> estimated for private and public sectors during pre economic reform period. The results point out that there is no shift in the magnitude of income elasticity <b>of</b> <b>savings</b> <b>of</b> household, private and public sectors during post economic reform period showing the homogeneity {{in the size of the}} income elasticity <b>of</b> domestic <b>savings.</b> Thus the economic reforms that have been initiated in 1992 could not bump up the growth rate <b>of</b> <b>savings</b> and magnitude <b>of</b> the income elasticity <b>of</b> domestic <b>savings</b> both at aggregate and disaggregate levels in the Indian Economy during post economic reform period. ...|$|R
