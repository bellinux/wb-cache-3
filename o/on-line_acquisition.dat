In a previous work, we have solved the theoretically complex problem of automatically classifying surfaces according to the quality of their aspect.

40|$|In this book, {{several issues}} related to the {{metrological}} characterization of high-performance pulsed power converters are addressed. Initially, a background and state-of-the-art on measurement systems for high-performance power converter are presented. Modern power converters usually exploit digital control loops to enhance their performance. In this context the final performance of a power converter has to be validated by a reference instrument with better metrological characteristics. In addition, an on-line measurement system is also needed to digitize the quantity to be controlled with high-accuracy. In industrial applications of power converters metrology, specifications are often given in terms of Worst-Case Uncertainty (WCU). Therefore, an analytical model for predicting the WCU of a measurement system is required. In this book such a model is discussed and detailed for an instrument affected by Gaussian noise. In addition, the study and the design of a Reference Acquisition System for characterizing high-power pulses are presented.
