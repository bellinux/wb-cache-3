40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether androgen promotes AT 1 aR expression on smooth muscle to confer high prevalence of AngII-induced AAAs in hyperlipidemic mice. In addition, we also investigate the role of androgen in the progression <b>of</b> <b>established</b> AngII-induced AAAs. First, we sought to examine the role of endogenous androgen in the growth <b>of</b> <b>established</b> AngII-induced AAAs. By castrating male mice, we demonstrated that removal of endogenous androgen significantly decreased the progressive lumen dilation <b>of</b> <b>established</b> AngII-induced AAAs in male ApoE-/-mice, but had no effect on external AAA diameters. These results suggest that androgen contributes to the progression <b>of</b> <b>established</b> AAAs through distinct mechanisms that differentially influence aortic lumen and wall diameters...|$|R
40|$|Kinase {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{productive}} classes <b>of</b> <b>established</b> targets, but the majority of approved drugs against kinase were developed only for cancer. Intensive efforts were therefore exerted for releasing its therapeutic potential by discovering new therapeutic area. Kinases in clinical trial could provide great opportunities for treating various diseases. However, no systematic comparison between system profiles <b>of</b> <b>established</b> targets and those of clinical trial ones was conducted. The reveal of probable difference or shift of trend would help to identify key factors defining druggability <b>of</b> <b>established</b> targets. In this study, a comparative analysis of system profiles of both types of targets was conducted. Consequently, the systems profiles of the majority of clinical trial kinases were identified to be very similar to those <b>of</b> <b>established</b> ones, but percentages <b>of</b> <b>established</b> targets obeying the system profiles appeared to be slightly but consistently higher than those of clinical trial targets. Moreover, a shift of trend in the system profiles from the clinical trial to the established targets was identified, and popular kinase targets were discovered. In sum, this comparative study may help to facilitate the identification of the druggability <b>of</b> <b>established</b> drug targets by their system profiles and drug-target interaction networks...|$|R

5|$|After {{a year of}} negotiation, Tiberius led {{a sizable}} force into Armenia, presumably with the goal <b>of</b> <b>establishing</b> it as a Roman client-state and ending the threat it posed on the Roman-Parthian border.

5|$|After this failure, Pyrrhus ravaged the Spartan {{hinterland}} whilst {{fending off}} counter-attacks by the victorious Spartans. On {{the invitation of}} an Argive ally, Pyrrhus attempted to seize Argos. The assault culminated in a fiasco with Pyrrhus being attacked by his Argive opponents, the pursuing Spartan army of Areus and a Macedonian army commanded by Antigonus Gonatas. Pyrrhus {{was killed in the}} ensuing battle in the streets of Argos, ending Epiriote hopes <b>of</b> <b>establishing</b> a hegemony in Greece.|$|E

As a result of the battle, al-Mukhtar gained control over Mosul and the surrounding region, and he appointed Ibn al-Ashtar governor of Mosul.

5|$|Although the United States Navy was {{prevented}} from developing fortifications on the Aleutian Islands {{due to the}} terms of the Washington Naval Treaty, the Navy believed that at some point the United States' treaty obligations would no longer apply, and began to scout the Aleutians for possible naval bases. In 1923, two scouting ships investigated the possibility <b>of</b> <b>establishing</b> anchorages off the Islands, and attempted to claim the United States Army's bases on the Aleutians for the purposes of national security.|$|E

This would see HCI partnering a top local school for exchange and mutual learning programmes.|$|E
