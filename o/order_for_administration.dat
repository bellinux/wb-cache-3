The report provides updated recommendations to improve prevention of perinatal and early childhood HBV transmission, including implementation of universal infant vaccination beginning at birth, and to increase vaccine coverage among previously unvaccinated children and adolescents. Strategies to enhance implementation of the recommendations include 1) establishing standing <b>orders</b> <b>for</b> <b>administration</b> of hepatitis B vaccination beginning at birth; 2) instituting delivery hospital policies and procedures and case management programs to improve identification of and administration of immunoprophylaxis to infants born to mothers who are hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive and to mothers with unknown HBsAg status at the time of delivery; and 3) implementing vaccination record reviews for all children aged 11 [...] 12 years and children and adolescents aged < 19 years who were born in countries with intermediate and high levels of HBV endemicity, adopting hepatitis B vaccine requirements for school entry, and integrating hepatitis B vaccination services into settings that serve adolescents. The second part of the ACIP statement, which will include updated recommendations and strategies to increase hepatitis B vaccination of adults, will be published separately. prepared by Eric E.

40|$|Problem: Process {{analysis}} and staff interviews revealed several barriers to appropriate adult vaccination.

Evidence: Pneumonia mortality rate is a staggering 5 - 36 percent in adults and 18 - 60 percent in the elderly (Zimmerman, Tabbrah, & Norwalk 2005). It is undeniably important that qualifying patients are vaccinated. Strategy: A multidisciplinary group was organized {{to look at these}} issues.

40|$|Executing a will is an {{important}} step in estate planning. A will gives the testator the opportunity to bequeath his assets and to indicate how he wants his estate to be distributed after his death. Not only is the proper execution of a will important but it should be updated regularly and carefully to provide for changed circumstances. The will must accordingly be readily available for the testator to amend or revoke. The availability of the will after the testator’s death is crucial in <b>order</b> <b>for</b> the <b>administration</b> process to commence. Although an easy accessible will can lead to problems surrounding the authenticity of the will, it can contribute to the prompt administration of the estate as it must be submitted to the master in terms of the Administration of Estates Act. In this article numerous problems relating to the existence, availability and recovery of a will at the death of the testator are discussed. Interrelated issues such as forgery, lost wills, missing wills, concealment of wills and revocation by destruction of a will are discussed with reference to case law and other examples. Questions as to the proper custody of the will, before and after the death of the testator, resolving disputes amongst next-of-kin, and the onus of proof, are discussed. Cases that in fact dealt with common law lost wills, but where section 2 (3) condonation applications were incorrectly brought, are discussed. Possible resolutions for the miscellaneous problems with wills are explored and recommendations made to solve potential problems. [URL]...|$|R
