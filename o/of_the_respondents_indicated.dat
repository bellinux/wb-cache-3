The study used a descriptive research design that answered questions how competition affects the independent variables of the study i. e. new market entrants, competitive rivalry and buyer power. Simple stratified sampling was used to select the sample of the respondents to avoid bias and ensure that samples drawn were representative of the population of mobile service subscribers of the four firms. Data collection was done using questionnaires and analyzed using Ms Excel. The results were presented using bar graphs and pie charts. The study found out that competition has an impact on the performance of firms and this accounted for 79. 8 % while 20. 2 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>respondents</b> <b>indicated</b> that competition did not have an impact on performance of firms.

AMTA degree program coordinators were asked about 3 therapy modalities, in particular: verbal therapy, music therapy, and expressive arts therapies (excluding music therapy). It was predicted that less than a quarter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>respondents</b> would <b>indicate</b> that personal therapy of any modality was required in their undergraduate curricula, but that a larger percentage would indicate that it was encouraged. Both hypotheses were supported, with just over 14 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>respondents</b> <b>indicating</b> that they require some form of personal therapy and 32 % indicating that they encourage it, with 73 % of this latter subgroup encouraging verbal therapy and 46 % encouraging music therapy. It was further predicted that, when music therapy was required or encouraged, it was most often provided by an individual who was associated with the college/university and that therapy was usually provided in a group format. Respondent comments related to these 2 questions revealed considerable confusion between experiential exercises and personal therapy, leading to dubious validity <b>of</b> some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> numerical data.
