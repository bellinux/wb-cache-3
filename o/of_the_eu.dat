5|$|Steering the {{multilingualism}} language policy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>EU,</b> Orban {{focused on}} promoting {{foreign language learning}} through EU programmes such as the Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013. In addition, his remit also included the effective functioning of the EU's extensive interpretation, translation and publication services in the 23 official languages. To support the remit of his portfolio, Orban oversaw a staff of 3,400 in total (approximately 15 per cent of the Brussels executive's workforce) and approximately 1 per cent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>EU</b> budget.|$|E
5|$|The Council {{votes in}} one of three ways; unanimity, simple majority, or {{qualified}} majority. In most cases, the Council votes on issues by qualified majority voting, meaning that there must be a minimum of 55% of member states agreeing (at least 15) who together represent at least 65% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>EU</b> population. A 'blocking minority' can only be formed by at least 4 member states representing at least 35% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>EU</b> population.|$|E
5|$|The Treaty of Lisbon {{made the}} European Council a formal {{institution}} {{distinct from the}} (ordinary) Council <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>EU,</b> and created the present longer term and full-time presidency. As {{an outgrowth of the}} Council <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>EU,</b> the European Council had previously followed the same Presidency, rotating between each member state. While the Council <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>EU</b> retains that system, the European Council established, with no change in powers, a system of appointing an individual (without them being a national leader) for a two-and-a-half-year term - which can be renewed for the same person only once. Following the ratification of the treaty in December 2009, the European Council elected the then-Prime Minister of Belgium Herman Van Rompuy as its first permanent president (resigning from Belgian Prime Minister).|$|E

5|$|Although in most {{countries}} English is not an official language, it is currently the language most often taught as a foreign language. In the countries <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>EU,</b> English is the most widely spoken foreign language in nineteen of the twenty-five member states where {{it is not an}} official language (that is, the countries other than the UK, Ireland and Malta).

The next most commonly mentioned foreign language, French (which is the most widely known foreign language in the UK and Ireland), could be used in conversation by 12 percent of respondents.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} of the 1997 general election, polls {{suggested}} that Eurosceptic sentiment was running high in the UK, and the question of the country's ongoing membership <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>EU</b> was a topic of regular discussion in the media. Much of this press coverage took a negative stance toward the EU, mainstream newspapers like the Daily Mail, The Telegraph and The Times promoting Eurosceptic sentiment. Such debates were influenced by the UK's recent signing of the Maastricht Treaty and the looming possibility that the country would adopt the euro currency.|$|E
5|$|Capital {{within the}} EU may be {{transferred}} in any amount {{from one country}} to another. All intra-EU transfers in euro are treated as domestic transactions and bear the corresponding domestic transfer costs. This includes all member states <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>EU,</b> even those outside the eurozone providing the transactions are carried out in euro. Credit/debit card charging and ATM withdrawals within the eurozone are also treated as domestic transactions; however paper-based payment orders, like cheques, have not been standardised so these are still domestic-based. The ECB has also set up a clearing system, TARGET, for large euro transactions.|$|E
