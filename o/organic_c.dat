50|$|Southern Ocean sediments {{are a major}} sink for {{biogenic}} silica (50-75% of the oceanic {{total of}} 4.5 × 1014 g SiO2 yr−1; DeMaster, 1981), but only a minor sink for organic carbon (<1% of the oceanic 2 × 1014 g of <b>organic</b> <b>C</b> yr−1). These relatively high rates of biogenic silica accumulation in the Southern Ocean sediments (predominantly beneath the Polar Front) relative to organic carbon (60:1 on a weight basis) results from the preferential preservation of biogenic silica in the Antarctic water column. In contrast to what was previously thought, these high rates of biogenic silica accumulation are not the result from high rates of primary production. Biological production in the Southern Ocean is strongly limited due to the low levels of irradiance coupled with deep mixed layers and/or by limited amounts of micronutrients, such as iron. This preferential preservation of biogenic silica relative to organic carbon {{is evident in the}} steadily increasing ratio of silica/organic C as function of depth in the water column. About, thirty-five percent of the biogenic silica produced in the euphotic zone survives dissolution within the surface layer; whereas only 4% of the organic carbon escapes microbial degradation in these near-surface waters. Consequently, considerable decoupling of <b>organic</b> <b>C</b> and silica occurs during settling through the water column. The accumulation of biogenic silica in the seabed represents 12% of the surface production, whereas the seabed organic-carbon accumulation rate accounts for solely <0.5% of the surface production. As a result, polar sediments account for most of the ocean’s biogenic silica accumulation, but only a small amount of the sedimentary organic-carbon flux.|$|E

50|$|Denitrification is a microbially {{facilitated}} {{process where}} nitrate is reduced and ultimately produces molecular nitrogen (N2) {{through a series}} of intermediate gaseous nitrogen oxide products. Facultative anaerobic bacteria perform denitrification as a type of respiration that reduces oxidized forms of nitrogen in response to the oxidation of an electron donor such as organic matter. The preferred nitrogen electron acceptors in order of most to least thermodynamically favorable include nitrate (NO3−), nitrite (NO2−), nitric oxide (NO), nitrous oxide (N2O) finally resulting in the production of dinitrogen (N2) completing the nitrogen cycle. Denitrifying microbes require a very low oxygen concentration of less than 10%, as well as <b>organic</b> <b>C</b> for energy. Since denitrification can remove NO3−, reducing its leaching to groundwater, it can be strategically used to treat sewage or animal residues of high nitrogen content.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. June 2015. Major: Natural Resources Science and Management. Advisor: Paul Bolstad. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xi, 204 pages. The ability to accurately map and monitor forest carbon (C) has gained global attention as countries seek {{to comply with}} international agreements to mitigate climate change. However, attaining precise estimates of forest C storage is challenging due to the inherent heterogeneity occurring across different scales. To develop cost-effective sampling protocols, {{there is a need}} for more unbiased estimates of the current C stock, its distribution among forest compartments and its variability across different scales. As a contribution to this work, this dissertation used high-resolution field measurements of C collected from different forest compartments across a boreal forest stand in South East Norway. 	In the first paper, we combined the use of airborne scanning light detection and ranging (lidar) systems with fine-scale spatial C data relating to vegetation and the soil surface to describe and contrast the size and spatial distribution of C pools across the forest. We found that predictor variables from lidar derived metrics delivered precise models of above and belowground tree C, which comprised the largest of the measured C pool in our study. We also found evidence that lidar canopy data correlated well with the variation in field layer C stock. By using topographical models from lidar ground returns we were able to establish a strong correlation between lidar data and the <b>organic</b> layer <b>C</b> stock at a stand level. In the search for an effective tool to measure and monitor forest C pools, we found the capabilities of lidar to map forest C encouraging. 	In the second paper, we used a geostatistical approach to analyze the fine-scale heterogeneity of the soil organic layer (forest floor) C storage. Our results showed that the C stocks were highly variable within each plot, with spatial autocorrelation distances < 3 m. Further, we established that a minimum of 20 to 25 inventory samples is needed to determine the <b>organic</b> layer <b>C</b> stock with a precision of � 0. 5 kg C m- 2 in inventory plots of ~ 2000 m 2. 	In the third paper, we investigated how the short-range spatial variability of <b>organic</b> layer <b>C</b> affects sampling strategies aiming to monitor and detect changes in the C stock. We found that sample repeatability rapidly declines with sample separation distance, and the a priori sample sizes needed to detect a change a fixed change in the <b>organic</b> layer <b>C</b> stock vary by a factor of ~ 4 over 15 to 125 cm separation distance. Unless care is taken by the surveyor to ensure spatial sampling precision, substantially larger samples sizes, or longer time intervals between baseline sampling and revisit are required to detect a change. 	In the final paper, we utilized the nested sampling protocol to investigate the spatial variability of <b>organic</b> layer <b>C</b> across different scales and incorporated inventory expenses in the development of a cost-optimal sampling approach. Because precise estimates are costly to obtain, it is of great interest for surveyors to develop cost-efficient sampling protocols aimed at maximizing the spatial coverage, while minimizing the estimate variance. We found that the majority of the estimate variance is confined within small subplots (100 m 2) of the forest (25 km 2), emphasizing the importance of considering the short-range variability when conducting a large-scale inventory. Further, this chapter demonstrated how optimal allocation of sampling units (plot, subplot and sample) is not only a function of the variance component within that dimension, but also changes with the sampling unit costs and the acceptable margin of error. We found that the costs of conducting an <b>organic</b> layer <b>C</b> inventory could be reduced by more than 60 % by increasing the inventory uncertainty from � 0. 25 Mg C ha- 1 to � 0. 5 Mg C ha- 1. Finally, we established that sampling costs can be reduced with as much 80 % by conducting a double sampling procedure that utilizes the correlation between <b>organic</b> layer <b>C</b> stock (r = 0. 79 to 0. 85) and measurements of layer thickness...|$|R
