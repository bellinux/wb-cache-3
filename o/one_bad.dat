So I felt like, well, I've finally got this thing going but it's dead. Flood and I had to record Broken under a {{different}} band name, because if TVT found out we were recording, they could confiscate all our shit and release it. Jimmy Iovine got involved with Interscope, and we kind of got slave-traded. It wasn't my doing. I didn't know anything about Interscope. And I was real pissed off at him at first because it was going from <b>one</b> <b>bad</b> situation to potentially another one. But Interscope went into it like they really wanted to know what I wanted. It was good, after I put my raving lunatic act on.|$|E

In earlier systems, when a worn pawl or other problem in a Strowger selector caused it to fail to advance, only the calling party could detect the error as no connection was achieved. The caller eventually lost patience and redialed the call. The same user or another might get connected to the faulty selector again. Therefore, <b>one</b> <b>bad</b> Strowger selector could block many calls until subscriber complaints alerted staff to the problem.|$|E
25|$|He {{made his}} Test debut against Australia at Cape Town in November 2011 and since then, {{he has been}} a regular part of the squad. In the Test series against Pakistan in UAE in 2013, he was not picked for the first Test, but he came back {{strongly}} in the second by bagging a five-wicket haul {{on the first day of}} the Test match. Tahir was left out once again after <b>one</b> <b>bad</b> Test with the ball against India and was replaced by Robin Peterson, but he continued to do well in the shorter forms of the game. He was also the highest wicket-taker in the 2014 ICC World Twenty20, with 12 wickets at an average of 10.91. He continued to be a regular member of the South African side in all formats and played Test matches in spin-friendly conditions.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} year saw Richardson go from strength to strength both in dry weather {{and when the}} pitches became treacherous after mid-July. Despite having to bowl 8,491 balls at a great pace, he never showed any sign of losing his form and set a new record in taking 290 wickets (bettered only by Tich Freeman, a slow bowler, in 1928 and 1933). In 1896, Richardson's bowling at Lord's dismissed Australia for 53 and won England the match. During the following Test at Old Trafford, which England lost by three wickets, after bowling 390 balls in the first innings in perfect batting conditions (taking seven for 168), when Australia were set 125 to win on a pitch showing no sign of wear, Richardson was able to bowl 178 balls without a rest, take six for 76 and almost win England a seemingly lost game. It is {{said that he did}} not bowl <b>one</b> <b>bad</b> ball during this spell of three hours and J.T. Hearne dropped a catch off his bowling when Australia were 99 for 7.|$|E

500|$|Since the composer's death writers {{sympathetic}} to his music have expressed regret {{that he is}} known by the musical public for {{only a handful of}} his scores such as The Carnival of the Animals, the Second Piano Concerto, the Organ Symphony, Samson et Dalila, Danse macabre and the Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso. Among his large output, Nicholas singles out the Requiem, the Christmas Oratorio, the ballet Javotte, the Piano Quartet, the Septet for trumpet, piano and strings, and the First Violin Sonata as neglected masterpieces. In 2004, the cellist Steven Isserlis said, [...] "Saint-Saens is exactly the sort of composer who needs a festival to himself... there are Masses, all of which are interesting.

In response to the general acclaim from critics, Roberts wished that the track would be well received amongst her peers, saying [...] "I haven't seen <b>one</b> <b>bad</b> review from the single or album samplers – it seems {{too good to be}} true.

500|$|The Killing Joke (in {{which the}} Joker is the {{unreliable}} narrator) explains {{the roots of}} his insanity as [...] "one bad day": losing his wife and unborn child and being disfigured by chemicals, paralleling Batman's origin {{in the loss of}} his parents. He tries (and fails) to prove that anyone can become like him after <b>one</b> <b>bad</b> day by torturing Commissioner Gordon, physically and psychologically. Batman offers to rehabilitate his foe; the Joker apologetically declines, believing it too late for him to be saved. Other interpretations show that the Joker is fully aware of how his actions affect others and that his insanity as merely an act. Comics scholar Peter Coogan describes the Joker as trying to reshape reality to fit himself by imposing his face on his victims (and fish) in an attempt to make the world comprehensible by creating a twisted parody of himself. Englehart's [...] "The Laughing Fish" [...] demonstrates the character's illogical nature: trying to copyright fish which bear his face, and not understanding why threatening the copyright clerk cannot produce the desired result.|$|E
500|$|Batman: The Killing Joke (1988) {{built on}} the Joker's 1951 origin story, portraying him as a failed comedian {{pressured}} into committing crime as the Red Hood to support his pregnant wife. Batman's interference causes him to leap into a chemical vat, which disfigures him. This, combined with the trauma of his wife's earlier accidental death, causes him to go insane and become the Joker. However, the Joker says that this story may not be true, as he prefers his past to be [...] "multiple choice". In this graphic novel, the Joker shoots and paralyzes Barbara Gordon and tortures her father, Commissioner James Gordon, {{to prove that it}} only takes <b>one</b> <b>bad</b> day to drive a normal man insane. After Batman rescues Gordon and subdues the Joker, he offers to rehabilitate his old foe and end their rivalry. Although the Joker refuses, he shows his appreciation by sharing a joke with Batman. Following the character's maiming of Barbara, she became a more important character in the DC Universe: Oracle, a data gatherer and superhero informant, who has her revenge in Birds of Prey by shattering the Joker's teeth and destroying his smile.|$|E

[...] Ford said of Scott in 2000: [...] "I admire his work. We had a bad patch there, and I'm over it." [...] In 2006 Ford reflected on the production of the film saying: [...] "What I remember more than anything else when I see Blade Runner is not the 50 nights of shooting in the rain, but the voiceover... I was still obliged to work for these clowns that came in writing <b>one</b> <b>bad</b> voiceover after another." [...] Ridley Scott confirmed in the summer 2007 issue of Total Film that Harrison Ford contributed to the Blade Runner Special Edition DVD, and had already recorded his interviews. [...] "Harrison's fully on board", said Scott.|$|E

500|$|The {{vote was}} held on Saturday 23 April 1887, with the booths open for twelve hours from eight in the morning. There were seven polling {{stations}} across Taunton, which was busy as it was market day. The Taunton Courier reported that party colours of both sides were on display, but {{that there was more}} [...] "Conservative blue" [...] than the tri-colour and Union Jack of the Liberals. Campaigning continued throughout the day, but was conducted in a civil manner. Two hours into the voting it was announced that a third of the constituency had voted, and the Conservatives declared that they were leading by a ratio of two to <b>one.</b> <b>Bad</b> weather {{in the middle of the}} day caused a lull in the voting, but the polls were very busy throughout the afternoon when the weather cleared, as most of the town only worked half of the day. Based upon their polling on the day, the Conservatives continued to claim victory during the afternoon. The votes were counted in the Municipal Office, and the results were announced at quarter-past nine in the evening. Allsopp received 1,426 votes to Sanders' 890, granting him a 536 majority. Both Allsopp and Sanders spoke briefly to praise the Returning Officer, and Allsopp was then called upon to give a speech. During that speech, Allsopp thanked the people of Taunton, and gently mocked Sanders for the money he had banked in case of corruption.|$|E
500|$|Manohla Dargis of The New York Times deplored the film's pacing as [...] "mostly just plods" [...] {{and said}} it lacked humor. Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film only 2 out of 4 stars, feeling, [...] "for every slam-bang action sequence, there are far too many {{sluggish}} scenes." [...] David Edelstein of New York magazine misses the [...] "centrifugal threat" [...] of Alfred Molina's character, adding that [...] "the three villains here don't add up to one Doc Ock" [...] (referring to Alfred Molina's portrayal of the character in Spider-Man 2). James Berardinelli felt director Sam Raimi [...] "overreached his grasp" [...] by allowing so many villains, specifically saying, [...] "Venom is <b>one</b> <b>bad</b> guy too many." [...] Roger Ebert, who gave Spider-Man 2 a glowing review, gave the sequel 2 out of 4 stars and thought Church never expressed how Sandman felt about his new powers, something Molina, as Doc Ock in Spider-Man 2, did [...] "with a vengeance"; he said the film was [...] "a mess," [...] with too many villains, subplots, romantic misunderstandings, conversations and [...] "street crowds looking {{high into the air}} and shouting 'oooh!' this way, then swiveling and shouting 'aaah!' that way." [...] The New Yorker's Anthony Lane, who gave Spider-Man 2 a favorable review, gave the film a negative review, characterizing the film as a [...] "shambles" [...] which [...] "makes the rules up as it goes along." ...|$|E
500|$|In the 1980s, Alvin Plantinga {{presented}} {{a version of}} the free will defence which, he argued, demonstrated that the existence of an omnipotent benevolent God and of evil are not inconsistent. He believed that, unless it could be shown that the two are not inconsistent, they would be necessarily contradictory. To do this, Plantinga believed that a [...] "possible state of affairs" [...] must be proposed which, if actual, would make God's existence and the existence of evil consistent. He argued that a third proposition– that evil {{is the result of the}} actions of free, rational, fallible human beings– allows the existence of God and evil to be consistent. Plantinga supported this argument by claiming that there are some things that an omnipotent God could not do, yet remain omnipotent– for example, if an omnipotent God has necessary existence, he could not create a world in which he does not exist. For this reason, Plantinga argued that an omnipotent God could not create any universe that he chooses, as Leibniz had proposed. He suggested that, even in a world where humans have free will, their actions may be so predictable that God could not create a world where they would do something unpredictable. Finally, he argued that if every moral agent freely makes at least <b>one</b> <b>bad</b> moral decision in any possible universe, God cannot create a universe where there is human freedom and no evil. Plantinga maintained that the existence of an omnipotent, benevolent God and the existence of evil are not inconsistent.|$|E

40|$|The {{greater power}} of bad events over good ones {{is found in}} {{everyday}} events, major life events (e. g., trauma), close relationship outcomes, social network patterns, interpersonal interactions, and learning processes. Bad emotions, bad parents, and bad feedback have more impact than good <b>ones,</b> and <b>bad</b> information is processed more thoroughly than good. The self is more motivated to avoid bad self-definitions than to pursue good <b>ones.</b> <b>Bad</b> impressions and bad stereotypes are quicker to form and more resistant to disconfirmation than good ones. Various explanations such as diagnosticity and salience help explain some findings, but the greater power of bad events is still found when such variables are controlled. Hardly any exceptions (indicating greater power of good) can be found. Taken together, {{these findings suggest that}} bad is stronger than good, as a general principle across a broad range of psychological phenomena...|$|R
