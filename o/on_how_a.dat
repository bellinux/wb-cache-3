5|$|IQ classifications from IQ testing are not {{the last}} word <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>a</b> test-taker will do in life, nor are they the only {{information}} {{to be considered for}} placement in school or job-training programs. There is still a dearth of information about how behavior differs between persons with differing IQ scores. For placement in school programs, for medical diagnosis, and for career advising, factors other than IQ must also be part of an individual assessment.|$|E
5|$|Like many {{scientists}} {{working on the}} project, Woods affected a casual attitude towards the danger posed by radiation. After a morning with Willard Libby soldering a canister containing a mixture of radium salt and beryllium metal, Woods absorbed about 200 roentgens, and her {{white blood cell count}} halved. The doctors gave her a lecture <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>a</b> woman has only a fixed number of egg cells, a proposition that Woods was skeptical of. She considered that the important thing was that the solder was done correctly. When the team moved to their new home at Argonne, Woods had a dormitory all to herself.|$|E

25|$|An older {{name for}} the subject was {{combinatorial}} topology, implying an emphasis <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>a</b> space X was constructed from simpler ones (the modern standard tool for such construction is the CW-complex). In the 1920s and 1930s, there was growing emphasis on investigating topological spaces by finding correspondences from them to algebraic groups, {{which led to the}} change of name to algebraic topology. The combinatorial topology name is still sometimes used to emphasize an algorithmic approach based on decomposition of spaces.|$|E

25|$|Today, it is {{generally}} accepted among scholars that fertility was essential in Viking society, and the most famous find that testifies to such rites is a small phallic statuette that was found in Rällinge in Sweden in the early 20th century. The appearance of this statuette indicates that it was related to fertility rites and it is usually interpreted as Freyja's brother Freyr. Adam of Bremen tells of the phallic statue of Freyr in the Temple at Uppsala and of the ribald songs that were sung during the rituals. In Völsa þáttr, there is an account <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>a</b> horse's penis was worshipped by a pagan family, an account that has connections with an old Indo-Aryan sacrificial rite.|$|E
25|$|Parents play a {{vital part}} in a child’s early life, for {{they are the first}} group of people that a child meets and learns from. The {{information}} that surrounds a child at home becomes reinforcements for desired behaviors of a male or female. Studies have shown that as immediate as 24 hours after a child is born most parents have already engaged in gender stereotypic expectations of sons or daughters. Through examples such as painting a room pink or blue, encouragement to participate in shared sex-typed activities, offering gender differentiated toys, or treating the opposite sex child differently, these parent-child interactions have long lasting influence <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>a</b> child connects to certain gender-specific behaviors.|$|E

But there is little on organizational {{learning and}} knowledge management literatures <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>an</b> individual creates or innovates: processes like information storage and dissemination have received much more attention.

25|$|The drum {{head has}} the most effect <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>a</b> drum sounds. Each type of drum head serves its own musical purpose and has its own unique sound. Double-ply drumheads dampen high {{frequency}} harmonics because they are heavier and they are suited to heavy playing. Drum heads with a white, textured coating on them muffle the overtones of the drum head slightly, producing a less diverse pitch. Drum heads with central silver or black dots tend to muffle the overtones even more. And drum heads with perimeter sound rings mostly eliminate overtones (Howie 2005). Some jazz drummers avoid using thick drum heads, preferring single ply drum heads or drum heads with no muffling. Rock drummers often prefer the thicker or coated drum heads.|$|E
25|$|In the 11th century BC, the Zhou Dynasty of Shaanxi {{arrived from}} the west and overthrew the Shang Dynasty. The capital was moved to Chang'an, and the {{political}} and economical center was moved away from Henan for the first time. In 722 BC, when Chang'an was devastated by Xionites invasions, the capital was moved back east to Luoyang. This began the Spring and Autumn period, a period of warfare and rivalry. What is now Henan and all of China was divided {{into a variety of}} small, independent states, constantly at war for control of the central plain. Although regarded formally as the ruler of China, the control that Zhou king in Luoyang exerted over the feudal kingdoms had virtually disappeared. Despite the prolonged period of instability, prominent philosophers such as Confucius emerged in this era and offered their ideas <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>a</b> state should be run. Laozi, the founder of Taoism, was born in northern Chu, part of modern-day Henan.|$|E
25|$|Song Ci (sometimes {{referred}} to as Sung Tzu) was a judicial intendant who lived in China 1188-1251 AD. In 1247 AD Song Ci wrote a book entitled Washing Away of Wrongs as a handbook for coroners. In this book Song Ci depicts several cases in which he took notes <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>a</b> person died and elaborates on probable causes. He explains in detail on how to examine a corpse {{both before and after}} burial. He also explains the process of how to determine a probable cause of death. The main purpose of this book was {{to be used as a}} guide for other investigators so they could assess the scene of the crime effectively. His level of detail in explaining what he observed in all his cases laid down the fundamentals for modern forensic entomologists and is the first recorded account in history of someone using forensic entomology for judicial means.|$|E
