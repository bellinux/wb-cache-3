5|$|Kate is {{revealed}} to be the marshal's prisoner, wearing the handcuffs that Walt found in the jungle. As the turbulence hits, the marshal is knocked unconscious by a falling suitcase. Kate struggles to put on her <b>oxygen</b> <b>mask</b> due to the handcuffs, so she uncuffs herself using the marshal's keys and puts the marshal's <b>oxygen</b> <b>mask</b> on him before attaching her own, {{at which point the}} tail end of the plane suddenly breaks off and flies away.|$|E
5|$|Douglas Trumbull was {{the visual}} effects supervisor, while Carlo Rambaldi {{designed}} the aliens. Trumbull joked that the visual effects budget, at $3.3million, {{could have been}} used to produce an additional film. His work helped lead to advances in motion control photography. The mother ship was designed by Ralph McQuarrie and built by Greg Jein. The look of the ship was inspired by an oil refinery Spielberg saw at night in India. Instead of the metallic hardware look used in Star Wars, the emphasis was on a more luminescent look for the UFOs. One of the UFO models was an <b>oxygen</b> <b>mask</b> with lights attached to it, used because of its irregular shape. As a subtle in-joke, Dennis Muren (who had just finished working on Star Wars) put a small R2-D2 model onto the underside of the mothership. The model of the mothership is now on display in the Smithsonian Institution's Air and Space Museum Udvar-Hazy Annex at Washington Dulles Airport in Chantilly, Virginia.|$|E
5|$|Having seen Xavier chasing his son, Eric brutally assaults John {{and forces}} him {{to lead him}} to the house. John's sitting area is {{revealed}} to be a lift, which they use to leave the factory. The tech team tracks the video's source and Rigg leads his team to a house, where they find VCRs playing previously recorded images. As Kerry realizes the game took place before they found John, the timer expires and a large safe opens, revealing Daniel bound and breathing into an <b>oxygen</b> <b>mask.</b> Eric enters the house alone and eventually locates the bathroom, where he is attacked by a pig-masked figure. He awakens shackled at the ankle to a pipe; a tape recorder left by Amanda reveals that she is John's accomplice and intends to continue his work after he dies. Amanda {{appears in the doorway}} and seals the door, leaving Eric to die.|$|E
30|$|Introduction Oxygen {{therapy is}} one of the most popular {{treatments}} in the ICU. We typically use <b>oxygen</b> <b>masks</b> to give <b>oxygen</b> to patients who breathe spontaneously. However, ordinary <b>oxygen</b> <b>masks</b> have a risk of CO 2 rebreathing—especially at lower flow rates (less than 5  l/min).|$|R
50|$|Medical <b>oxygen</b> <b>masks</b> {{are held}} in place by medical {{personnel}} or the user by hand, or they may be fitted with a lightweight elastic headband so the mask can be removed quickly. Full-face masks are secured by several straps. Tightly fitting <b>oxygen</b> <b>masks</b> are secured at four points by two head straps. Aviators’ masks are often equipped with “quick don” harnesses that allow those in pressurized aircraft to rapidly don the masks in emergencies. Military aviators’ <b>oxygen</b> <b>masks</b> are secured to flight helmets with quick-release systems.|$|R
50|$|If a {{pressurized}} aircraft {{suffers a}} pressurization failure above 10,000 feet (~3,000 meters), then {{it could be}} deemed as an emergency. Should this situation occur, the aircraft should begin an emergency descent and <b>oxygen</b> <b>masks</b> should be activated for all occupants. In the majority of passenger aircraft, the passengers' <b>oxygen</b> <b>masks</b> are activated automatically if the cabin pressure falls below the atmospheric pressure equivalent of 14,000 feet (~4,500 meters).|$|R
5|$|When {{the news}} of Bohr's escape reached Britain, Lord Cherwell sent a {{telegram}} to Bohr asking {{him to come to}} Britain. Bohr arrived in Scotland on 6 October in a de Havilland Mosquito operated by the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC). The Mosquitos were unarmed high-speed bomber aircraft that had been converted to carry small, valuable cargoes or important passengers. By flying at high speed and high altitude, they could cross German-occupied Norway, and yet avoid German fighters. Bohr, equipped with parachute, flying suit and <b>oxygen</b> <b>mask,</b> spent the three-hour flight lying on a mattress in the aircraft's bomb bay. During the flight, Bohr did not wear his flying helmet as it was too small, and consequently did not hear the pilot's intercom instruction to turn on his oxygen supply when the aircraft climbed to high altitude to overfly Norway. He passed out from oxygen starvation and only revived when the aircraft descended to lower altitude over the North Sea. Bohr's son Aage followed his father to Britain on another flight a week later, and became his personal assistant.|$|E
25|$|Armies {{may also}} require males to {{maintain}} clean-shaven faces as facial hair can prevent an air-tight seal between {{the face and}} breathing or safety equipment, such as a pilot's <b>oxygen</b> <b>mask,</b> a diver's mask, or a soldier's gas mask.|$|E
25|$|In 1941, Shure was {{contracted}} by the United States {{armed forces}} to supply microphones during World War II, and by the following year, the T-17B was the microphone most widely used by the U.S. Army and Navy. Shure also manufactured throat, headset, and <b>oxygen</b> <b>mask</b> microphones, and adopted the United States Military Standard for all Shure microphones.|$|E
50|$|Aircraft safety {{cards and}} {{in-flight}} safety demonstrations {{shown at the}} beginning of each flight explain the location and use of <b>oxygen</b> <b>masks.</b>|$|R
2500|$|After the accident, {{numerous}} passengers {{said that}} some <b>oxygen</b> <b>masks</b> did not deploy, whilst others had deteriorated elastic. Consequently, {{it was reported that}} one passenger smashed a panel of the ceiling to attempt {{to gain access to the}} masks. [...] It was stated that these passengers were deprived of oxygen until the plane was lowered to a breathable altitude. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau interviewed passengers who reported problems with the <b>oxygen</b> <b>masks</b> as part of their investigation.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} years of {{commercial}} flight, before pressurized cabins were invented, airliner passengers sometimes had to wear <b>oxygen</b> <b>masks</b> during routine flights.|$|R
25|$|On 9 October a {{spokesman}} for the Dutch national prosecutor's office stated that one victim had been found with an <b>oxygen</b> <b>mask</b> around his neck; a forensic investigation of the mask for fingerprints, saliva and DNA did not produce any results and it is therefore not known how or when that mask got around the neck of the victim.|$|E
25|$|Captain Lampe's <b>oxygen</b> <b>mask</b> {{failed and}} he left his seat to get a spare oxygen maskfrom that point he was never heard on the CVR again. It was {{believed}} that the fire had also cut off the oxygen supply to the spare <b>oxygen</b> <b>mask,</b> leaving Captain Lampe with no oxygen left {{to return to the}} pilot seat and fly the plane. The co-pilot was instructed to land on the airport's runway 12L. The aircraft was too high on the approach and the gear did not extend. The aircraft passed over the airport before making a tight turn. Bell attempted to turn towards Sharjah International Airport but unknowingly turned in the wrong direction. Radar contact was lost shortly thereafter at 15:42 UTC. The aircraft finally slammed into the ground at a shallow angle and at high speed in an unpopulated area between the Emirates Road and Al Ain Highway, barely missing Dubai Silicon Oasis. The aircraft hit right wing first and skidded a few meters, and exploded in a fireball, killing both pilots. Other than ATC, many initial reports came from pilots working for Emirates who were living in the community.|$|E
25|$|Somewhat later, Delgado's team mates {{got back}} to Delgado, and {{together}} they chased Roche, and caught him just before the climb of La Plagne. Roche then anticipated that Delgado would keep attacking on the climb. Knowing Delgado was the better climber, Roche decided he would not follow Delgado's attack. Instead, he let Delgado get away until the margin was one minute, giving Delgado {{the impression that he}} could safely save energy for the next stages, and at {{the last part of the}} stage gave it everything he had to reduce the margin. Roche followed that tactic, and confused not only Delgado, but also the commentators and the Tour organisation. Roche finished a few seconds behind Delgado, and after the finish he collapsed and was given an <b>oxygen</b> <b>mask</b> in an ambulance.|$|E
50|$|Three main {{kinds of}} <b>oxygen</b> <b>masks</b> {{are used by}} pilots and crews who fly at high altitudes: {{continuous}} flow, diluter demand, and pressure demand.|$|R
50|$|Many {{designs of}} aviator's <b>oxygen</b> <b>masks</b> contain a {{microphone}} to transmit speech to other crew members {{and to the}} aircraft's radio. Military aviators' <b>oxygen</b> <b>masks</b> have face pieces that partially cover {{the sides of the}} face and protect the face against flash burns, flying particles, and effects of a high speed air stream hitting the face during emergency evacuation from the aircraft by ejection seat or parachute. They are often part of a pressure suit or intended for use with a flight helmet.|$|R
50|$|Typical <b>oxygen</b> <b>masks</b> {{allow the}} patient to breathe in room air in {{addition}} to their therapeutic oxygen, but because filtered <b>oxygen</b> <b>masks</b> use a closed design that minimizes or eliminates the patient's contact with and ability to inhale room air, delivered oxygen concentrations to the patient {{have been found to be}} higher, approaching 99% using adequate oxygen flows. Because all exhaled particles are contained within the mask, nebulized medications are also prevented from being released into the surrounding atmosphere, decreasing the occupational exposure to healthcare staff and other patients.|$|R
25|$|On July 1, 2004, Brando died of {{respiratory}} failure from pulmonary fibrosis with {{congestive heart failure}} at the UCLA Medical Center. He left behind 14 children (two of his children, Cheyenne and Dylan Brando, had predeceased him), as well as over 30 grandchildren. He was also survived by his sister Jocelyn. The {{cause of death was}} initially withheld, with his lawyer citing privacy concerns. He also suffered from failing eyesight caused by diabetes and liver cancer. Shortly before his death and despite needing an <b>oxygen</b> <b>mask</b> to breathe, he recorded his voice to appear in , once again as Don Vito Corleone. However, Brando only recorded one line due to his health and an impersonator was hired to finish his lines. Some lines from his character were directly lifted from the film.|$|E
25|$|Masaharu Mochizuki, a {{passenger}} on the flight, recalled that passengers, both injured and uninjured, initially {{tried to move}} away from the blast site, but cabin crew told passengers to remain where they were until an assessment of the situation could be made. Assistant purser and lead economy class flight attendant, Fernando Bayot, moved an injured passenger named Yukihiko Osui away from the bomb site. Bayot then saw Ikegami and tried to pull him out of the hole, but soon realized that most of Ikegami's body below the waist was either damaged or missing entirely. Ikegami died minutes later. Bayot called another flight attendant over to pretend to minister to Ikegami's needs with a blanket and <b>oxygen</b> <b>mask</b> in order to prevent additional panic, then reported the extent of the passenger injuries to the cockpit.|$|E
25|$|In April 1941, the RAF {{sent two}} Spitfire Mark VA fighters to Dayton for testing. The variant used a {{pressurized}} cockpit for high-altitude pilot comfort—the pilot {{would not have}} to wear an <b>oxygen</b> <b>mask.</b> Kelsey ferried one of the aircraft to and from Los Angeles so that it could be examined further at a California facility. Because of the Spitfire's inherent range limitations, Kelsey was forced to make a number of refueling stops at little-used air fields. Kelsey noted engine overheating during taxiing and brake fade on long desert runways in the presence of significant crosswind. He found long cross-country flight very tiring due to the Spitfire's marginal stability (which gave it high maneuverability in combat.) Kelsey felt that the highly lauded fighter would not have been approved for purchase in the United States where requirements included long range.|$|E
5000|$|... ==Masks for high-altitude climbers== <b>Oxygen</b> <b>masks</b> {{are used}} by climbers of high peaks such as Mt. Everest. Because of the severe cold and harsh {{conditions}} <b>oxygen</b> <b>masks</b> for use at extreme altitude must be robust and effective. The oxygen storage tanks used with the <b>masks</b> (called <b>oxygen</b> bottles) are made of lightweight, high-strength metals and are covered in high-strength fiber such as kevlar. These special oxygen bottles are filled with oxygen {{at a very high}} pressure which provides a longer time duration of oxygen for breathing than standard pressure oxygen bottles. These systems are generally only used above 7000 m.|$|R
5000|$|One or more {{subjects}} (usually, pilots or crew members, though {{anyone interested}} in the effects of high altitude can usually arrange a visit) are placed in the chamber. Before [...] "ascending" [...] to the desired altitude, subjects breathe <b>oxygen</b> from <b>oxygen</b> <b>masks</b> to purge nitrogen from their bloodstream so decompression sickness (DCS) does not occur. With masks in place, the atmospheric pressure inside the chamber is then reduced to simulate altitudes of up {{to tens of thousands}} of feet. The subjects then remove their <b>oxygen</b> <b>masks</b> and experience the symptoms of hypoxia. An inside safety observer, breathing <b>oxygen</b> by <b>mask,</b> should always be present to place a subject's mask back on in the event a subject passes out unconscious. Outside observers monitor the subjects' condition via closed circuit television and viewing ports.|$|R
50|$|In 1995, Bonatti {{published}} The Mountains of My Life, {{an autobiography}} {{with stories about}} the expedition of 1954. Bonatti displays proof of his innocence, including a photograph of Lacedelli and Compagnoni wearing <b>oxygen</b> <b>masks</b> on the summit.|$|R
25|$|One flight {{attendant}} and an off-duty airline employee received minor injuries, but were both treated at the airport. The {{flight attendant}} had been {{attempting to make}} an interphone call to the pilots or a PA announcement to the passengers, instead of immediately donning his <b>oxygen</b> <b>mask</b> {{as he had been}} trained. As a result, he lost consciousness, fell, and struck the forward cabin partition, breaking his nose. An off-duty airline employee rushing to assist the flight attendant also lost consciousness, fell, and received a cut to the head. Both regained consciousness as the aircraft descended. A spare aircraft with maintenance technicians, ground crew, and customer service agents was dispatched from Phoenix to take the passengers to Sacramento. The replacement aircraft was expected to reach Sacramento with a 4-hour delay to the passengers on board Flight 812.|$|E
25|$|Following his release, Megrahi {{was taken}} to Tripoli Medical Center, Libya's most {{advanced}} public clinic, for cancer treatment. A video {{of him in the}} hospital showed him using an <b>oxygen</b> <b>mask</b> to breathe. On 2 September 2009, it was reported that his cancer had worsened, and that he had been transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). Libyan Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammed Seyala claimed that Megrahi had been moved to a special VIP wing of the hospital, was receiving full treatment from a team of doctors, and that his condition was not dangerous. Megrahi's family claimed that they had been informed that he had been taken to the ICU, but they were not allowed to visit him. The Foreign Ministry confirmed that his family were not allowed to visit him, but said that it was to ensure his safety. On 5 September, Megrahi was released from the ICU, but remained under close observation by a team of doctors.|$|E
25|$|Professor Montagnier, the co-discoverer of the Human Immuno-deficiency Virus (H.I.V), {{testified that}} the virus in the 393 {{children}} studied is a rare type found mostly in West Africa, but also throughout the continent. Montagnier told the court that the outbreak was probably started by an infected child admitted for treatment at the hospital. He said that injection {{was not the only}} possible means of infection, any other manipulation involving penetration of the skin, or even multiple use of the same <b>oxygen</b> <b>mask,</b> could have transmitted the virus. Montagnier was certain that the epidemic at the hospital started about a year before the Bulgarian nurses were hired. He said he was familiar with the case before his first visit to Libya in 1999 because he {{was in the process of}} studying the cases of hundreds of HIV-positive children from El-Fatih that were being examined or treated in hospitals in Switzerland, France, and Italy. At the time he was working on these cases, some of the children did not yet have the symptoms because the incubation period of the virus is about 10 years.|$|E
5|$|Treatments are {{flexible}} enough {{to be used in}} hospitals, the patient's home, or increasingly by portable devices. Oxygen tents were once commonly used in oxygen supplementation, but have since been replaced mostly by the use of <b>oxygen</b> <b>masks</b> or nasal cannulas.|$|R
50|$|On 7 September 2007, an Airbus A321 {{aircraft}} lost {{cabin pressure}} on a charter flight from Dalaman Airport to Birmingham Airport, {{resulting in an}} emergency landing at Atatürk International Airport.

25|$|Eraserheads went onstage {{for their}} reunion concert on August 30, 2008 at The Fort Open Field, Taguig City. The concert, however, {{was cut short}} halfway through a planned 30-song setlist as Buendia {{was rushed to the}} Makati Medical Hospital after {{experiencing}} chest pains. He was reported to be in stable condition. Buddy Zabala had checked on Buendia in his tent right after they went to their planned 20 minute break and saw that he already was on an <b>oxygen</b> <b>mask</b> with paramedics checking his blood pressure. As he left and came back, paramedics were already taking Buendia on an ambulance. Bandmates Zabala, Marasigan and Adoro further said that they had no idea that Buendia was already having difficulty performing. In the spirit of the reunion, Marasigan, Zabala and Adoro went to Saguijo after the concert and they continued their sets there. Kris Gorra-Dancel, Ebe Dancel, Aia De Leon and many other OPM artists joined them as well. During the concert, Jazz Nicolas of the Itchyworms and a close friend of the band, also joined the band and played synths, keyboards, and other back-up instruments.|$|E
25|$|With the U.S. Army's {{approval}} of the Shure T-17 microphone for use during World War II, Shure began producing what would be several specialized microphones for U.S. military use during that war. Shure's adoption of the Military Standard Specification, and product redesigns intended to conserve raw materials essential to the war effort, positioned the company to fulfill the military's needs for specialized microphones. The T-17 Battle Announce Microphone was {{the most widely used}} microphone in the U.S. Army and Air Force during World War II, and featured a plastic case that conserved aluminum and lighter and more reliable {{in a wide range of}} temperatures and climates. A waterproof version was used on nearly all U.S. Navy ships. Shure also designed the T-30 Throat Microphone for flight crews. A cloth strap held the T-30 against the throat, capturing the user's voice box vibrations directly and avoiding the background noise of the airplane. Shure also manufactured specialized headsets and the MC-1 <b>oxygen</b> <b>mask</b> microphone. In yet another example of the widespread use of Shure microphones by the U.S. military, U.S. lookout Private Lockhard used a Shure 700A microphone to announce his sighting of Japanese planes approaching Pearl Harbor on the morning of On December 7, 1941.|$|E
25|$|When Lynsey gives {{sexual health}} advice via a college radio, she angers Silas who {{prevents}} her receiving a promotion. Lynsey wears a naughty nurse's outfit on webcam for the show, further angering Silas who causes a blackout in Lynsey's flat, breaks in and grabs Lynsey from behind. Silas steals her ring but when Riley hears her screams he leaves. Upon hearing Silas' voice, Lynsey accuses {{him of being}} her attacker. Riley refuses to believe Lynsey and {{due to lack of}} evidence the police do not investigate. Lynsey and Texas begin to question whether Silas is responsible for India's murder. When searching Silas' belongings for her ring, Lynsey is interrupted by Riley and returns home to discover her ring has been returned. Texas makes Riley doubt Silas' innocence and when Lynsey accuses Silas of murdering India, Riley questions Silas. Silas collapses with a heart attack and is taken to hospital where Lynsey is assigned as Silas' nurse. Assuming he is faking a heart attack, Lynsey removes his <b>oxygen</b> <b>mask</b> and questions Silas about his innocence. Silas' daughter Heidi finds Lynsey withholding treatment from Silas and calls for help leading to Lynsey being suspended. Lynsey gives Cheryl some diet pills, which Silas replaces with his heart medication. Cheryl falls, knocking herself unconscious which leads to the discovery of sedatives in her system. Silas tells Cheryl that Lynsey could have given her the sedatives, making her doubt Lynsey's state of her mind.|$|E
