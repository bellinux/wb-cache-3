40|$|Purpose: This paper aims {{to discuss}} the context- and power-sensitive {{approach}} to the study <b>of</b> <b>multinationals</b> that has emerged in the last decade, argues for the need to supplement it by a clearer focus on the wider geopolitical context in which multinationals operate and outlines the implications {{for the development of}} IB research in this area. Design/methodology/approach: The paper provides a summary overview of context- and power-sensitive studies <b>of</b> <b>multinationals</b> before proposing a research agenda for the next decade. In particular, it argues for the need to combine the institutionalist angle taken by context/power analyses with post-colonial theory as a means of bringing geopolitics into the study <b>of</b> <b>multinationals,</b> a task that CPoIB is well positioned to accomplish. Findings: The paper identifies a lack of "criticality" in context/power research and, in particular, a lack of attention to the neo-imperial character <b>of</b> <b>multinationals</b> with specific regards to their management and organisation. Research limitations/implications: The implications of this paper are that the nature <b>of</b> contemporary <b>multinationals</b> is further illuminated, especially their role in (re-) producing (neo-) imperial relations in a supposedly post-colonial world. Further, the paper suggests an agenda for future research on the relationship between imperialism and multinationals.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{emphasized}} the links between trade reorientation and industrial restructuring in transition countries. In these studies trade has usually been considered as transactions among unrelated enterprises in different countries. However, an important and steadily growing share of trade are transactions with multinational enterprises and their foreign affiliates. Foreign direct investment <b>of</b> <b>multinationals</b> is the missing link in explaining this type of trade. The paper deals with the so-called intra-firm trade <b>of</b> <b>multinationals</b> operating in transition countries. It argues that trade within the internal networks <b>of</b> <b>multinationals</b> is the major route for international technology'transfer.

5|$|Economic {{conditions}} have fluctuated {{with the changing}} price of oil since 1985, for example during and following the Persian Gulf crisis of 1990–91. With its highly developed communication and transport facilities, Bahrain {{is home to a}} number <b>of</b> <b>multinational</b> firms and construction proceeds on several major industrial projects. A large share of exports consist of petroleum products made from imported crude oil, which accounted for 51% of the country's imports in 2007. Bahrain depends heavily on food imports to feed its growing population; it relies heavily on meat imports from Australia and also imports 75% of its total fruit consumption needs. Since only 2.9% of the country's land is arable, agriculture contributes to 0.5% of Bahrain's GDP. In 2004, Bahrain signed the US-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement, which will reduce certain trade barriers between the two nations. Due to the combination of the global financial crisis and the recent unrest, the growth rate decreased to 2.2% which is the lowest growth rate since 1994.|$|E

The Brigade deployed to Iraq in fall of 2007 following the Brigade Combat Teams and aviation brigade of the 3rd Infantry Division, however, for this deployment, the unit {{did not support the}} Division directly, as its mission in Multinational Division, North covered facilities management, not unit logistics. Brigade projects focused on building infrastructure throughout northern Iraq. The brigade served a total of 15 months in the country, headquartered at Contingency Operating Base Q-West in Northern Iraq under the command of the 316th Expeditionary Support Command. It was relieved during a change of command ceremony on 9 August 2008, at which time it returned to Fort Stewart. It was replaced by the 16th Sustainment Brigade. Since its return, the brigade participated in an intramural soccer tournament at Fort Benning, something many of its members enjoyed doing, even while deployed.|$|E
5|$|Like the FIFA World Cup, the Recopa Sudamericana is {{sponsored}} by a group <b>of</b> <b>multinational</b> corporations.

The deal running for a period of three years began with the 2012 edition. As the main sponsor of the tournament, the competition will carry the name of the bank. Thus, the competition is known officially as the '"Copa Santander Libertadores'". The first primary sponsor of the competition was Fox Sports Latinoamérica, a Latin American cable television network focusing on sports-related programming including live and pre-recorded event telecasts, sports talk shows, and other original programmings. The sponsorship was only for the 2005 edition of the competition, being known officially as '"Fox Sports Recopa Sudamericana"'. The second primary sponsor was Visa, an American multinational financial services corporation. The deal ran for a period of 3 years which began with the 2006 edition. As the main sponsor of the tournament, the competition carried the name of the corporation. Thus, the competition was known officially as '"Recopa Visa Sudamericana"'.|$|E
