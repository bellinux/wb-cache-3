5|$|In his book, German Architecture in China, Warner Torsten {{writes of}} the cathedral: According to residents] the cathedral {{is far too}} large for the scale of Qingdao. Its {{position}} {{on top of a}} hill makes this even more evident. Perhaps the idea was to produce a powerful building to hold its own with the Protestant Church, which for 20 years had been the largest religious building in Qingdao, or perhaps the intention was to <b>outstrip</b> the 46metre-high towers of the Franciscan church in Jinan. The towers of the cathedral in Qingdao were higher than all the other churches in the major cities of Northern China– Tianjin, Beijing, Dalian, or Jinan. They dominate the silhouette of Qingdao; they are particularly impressive from a ship entering the harbour.|$|E
5|$|The River Severn is {{considered}} a navigable river and Gloucester {{used to be an}} important port, with shipping having to deal with the bore. Vessels can ride the tide up from Sharpness to Gloucester. The tide will <b>outstrip</b> the vessel but by timing the journey correctly, a barge can reach Gloucester at high water. Descending is more difficult, and barges often needed to start their descent with one tide, lay up before crossing Longney Sands, and finish the descent at the next tide. These inconveniences in accessing Gloucester were overcome when the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal was opened in 1827, bypassing the need for shipping to use the river to reach Gloucester.|$|E

40|$|With {{the growth}} of unequal {{economic}} development {{in the global economy}} countries with a lower level of economic development realize the objective demand and the urgent need of the transition to a new model of economic development. The last would provide dynamic benefits to the economy in the long run. Variants of these economic models are considered mainly in terms of innovation economy, knowledge economy, information economy etc. However, the less successful economies require breakthrough model, economic model of trust that would ensure accelerated economic growth and qualitative economic development. Such kind of model is a model of <b>outstripping</b> economic development, which is based on the transition to innovative ways to compete with the developed countries, to overcome unequal exchange, understanding the insufficiency of favourable economic conditions for the qualitative development of a country, the focus on the human investments, and the development of human potential. Accordingly, {{there is a need to}} define the methodology of research in modern political economy and its theoretical representation. The subject of the research is the theoretical model of <b>outstripping</b> economic development and methodology of its research. The objectives of the article are to define the research methodology of of <b>outstripping</b> economic development theoretical model in modern political economy and to prove an objective need for this model for countries with post-transformational economies, and to reveal the essence of <b>outstripping</b> development and its types. General scientific methods – induction and deduction – are used in revealing the essence of <b>outstripping</b> development, historical method – when analyzing examples of <b>outstripping</b> development in the new economic history and specific methods – statistical method and economic analysis – in the application of statistical rules for GDP per capita growth for Ukraine to attain the middle-income countries. It is shown that the theoretical model of <b>outstripping</b> economic development can be realized in economic policy from the perspective of its compliance with the technical and economic paradigm and also with the main role of public management, activation of motivational system’s potential of society, and a technological system’s potential too. <b>Outstripping</b> development is not only meant to catch up economically successful countries but this is the type of development in which a country can faster than other countries master new technologies before their mass distribution. <b>Outstripping</b> economic development is a process of qualitative transformation of the economic system and society, social institutions, and behaviour of economic agents in identifying and meeting the spiritual and material needs of a human to outperform. It is followed by <b>outstripping</b> development of the civil society, <b>outstripping</b> in the quality of macroeconomic governance. It appears as the objective necessity which exists in potential and is released in the system of intellectual-stimulated incentives to improve the quality of society’s life, and particularly an individual in it. The tools of <b>outstripping</b> development are the advanced methods for macroeconomic management with the constructive character of relationships between government and business. Such kinds of relationships are oriented on the release economic potential and also on the innovation-intensive nature of the industry. The priority of <b>outstripping</b> development of investments in a human, his knowledge and experience, and in science is emphasized. Theoretical model of <b>outstripping</b> economic development has a legitimate right to exist as an objective need for the global community in the identification of a new model of economic development that responds to the realities and challenges of the international economy, {{the growth of}} the intellectualization of society, increasing demands to improve quality of human life. Theoretical model of <b>outstripping</b> economic development can be used as a basis by governments of countries with post-transformational economies for transition to a new model of economic development under conditions of instability in the world economy. The model has the goal not only to maintain sustainable economic growth, but to ensure the development by <b>outstripping</b> qualitative paces for the long term, to use innovative mechanisms of competition with developed countries, and to form the economy for a human being, the growth and development of his creative and health potential...|$|R

25|$|Book and {{magazine}} publishers {{spend a lot}} of their time buying or commissioning copy; newspaper publishers, by contrast, usually hire their staff to produce copy, although they may also employ freelance journalists, called stringers.

He gradually moved away from neoliberalism (partly under the influence of his brother Dirk, a social liberal political philosopher), and became more of a centrist figure, a change which especially became clear during his first term as Prime Minister.|$|E

25|$|In {{addressing}} {{the question of}} who invented the incandescent lamp, historians Robert Friedel and Paul Israel list 22 inventors of incandescent lamps prior to Joseph Swan and Thomas Edison. They conclude that Edison's version was able to <b>outstrip</b> the others because of a combination of three factors: an effective incandescent material, a higher vacuum than others were able to achieve (by use of the Sprengel pump) and a high resistance that made power distribution from a centralized source economically viable.|$|E

25|$|In {{terms of}} post-capitalist vision, anarcho-syndicalists most often {{subscribe}} to communist or collectivist anarchist economic systems {{on the issue}} of distributing goods. The aim is to use a radical trade union movement to achieve either a collectivist or communist (moneyless) mode of distribution; or first the former, then the latter, once a certain degree of technical-productive capacity has enabled production to <b>outstrip</b> consumption, making a moneyless economy more viable. However, anarcho-syndicalists differ from anarcho-communists on wanting federations of (trade-based) workers' syndicates as the locus of organising the economy, rather than confederations of (territory-based) free communes.|$|E

In weaker rock, erosion along a weaker zone may not greatly <b>outstrip</b> that of the cliff face. However, the world's largest sea cave has formed in the heavily fractured Caversham sandstone (Barth, 2013) changing our understanding of which host rocks can form large sea caves.|$|E
25|$|These beliefs were {{complemented by}} {{a belief that}} laborers could be best {{motivated}} by financial incentive.

Adopting Thomas Malthus's population theory, they saw poor urban conditions as inevitable, they believed population growth would <b>outstrip</b> food production and they regarded that consequence desirable, because starvation would help limit population growth. They opposed any income or wealth redistribution, which they believed would be dissipated by the lowest orders.|$|E

There are those within the community who take a different position, notably the late Coretta Scott King and the Reverend Al Sharpton, the latter of whom, when asked in 2003 whether he supported gay marriage, replied that he might as well have been asked if he supported black marriage or white marriage.|$|E

25|$|By {{the time}} that the Battle was {{entering}} service in 1937, the Battle had already been rendered obsolete by the rapid advances in aircraft technology were being made at the time. Specifically, the performance and capabilities of fighter aircraft had increased to <b>outstrip</b> the modest performance gains that the light bomber had achieved over its biplane antecedents. In terms of a self-defence capability, the Battle had been armed only with a single Browning machine gun and a trainable Vickers K in the rear position; in service, these proved to be desperately inadequate. Moreover, it lacked other common defensive features of the era, such as an armoured cockpit and self-sealing fuel tanks.|$|E
