He finished the regular season with 23,785 career points, which broke George Gervin's record for most points in a Spurs uniform (23,602). In the playoffs, the Spurs swept the Los Angeles Lakers, beat Golden State in six games and defeated the Memphis Grizzlies in the Western Conference Finals in a 4–0 sweep to reach the NBA Finals. In game 2 of the Western Conference Finals, Duncan recorded his 500th playoff block, becoming the first player in NBA history to reach that milestone, although the NBA did not track blocks prior to the 1973–74 season. The Spurs met defending NBA champions Miami Heat in the NBA Finals in a tightly contested series. Miami had home court advantage, but San Antonio took the first game and headed into game 6 with a 3–2 lead. In that game, Duncan scored 25 points in the first half, his biggest haul in a half of an NBA Finals game. However, the Spurs lost the game in overtime, and then lost the deciding seventh game.|$|E

5|$|Stroma's violent storms {{occasionally}} wrought destruction on the island. In December 1862, a great storm broke {{over the}} island {{with such force that}} it swept right across the northern end of Stroma, leaving wreckage, rocks and seaweed {{on the top of the}} 100-foot-high cliffs and destroying the channels leading to the watermill. However, the sea's destructive power had one positive benefit for the islanders, if not for those caught out by the currents and shoals of the Pentland Firth. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> hundred years, over sixty vessels ranging from fishing boats to large cargo vessels have been wrecked on the shores of Stroma, with many more vessels coming to grief on the reefs and shoals of the neighbouring mainland and Orkney coasts. Many vessels – at least 560 between 1830 and 1990 – have had to be refloated in the Pentland Firth after getting into difficulties. Shipwrecks were a valuable source of income, timber and goods for the islanders, who would salvage liberally – and often with little regard for legality – whenever a stranded ship was abandoned. The building of Stroma's first lighthouse in the late 19th century was initially opposed by some of the islanders who were more concerned with profiting from shipwrecks than preventing them.|$|E

The data set has considerable homoplasy, but still contains phylogenetic information. The phylogeny obtained is moderately resolved and, with some notable exceptions, supports the species complexes proposed by Hellenthal and Price <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> decades. <b>The</b> subgenera G.

The nominate subgenus of Geomydoecus may be monophyletic, but our cladogram was insufficiently resolved to corroborate this. Mapping the pocket gopher hosts onto the phylogeny reveals a consistent pattern of louse clades being restricted to particular genera or subgenera of gophers, but the history of the host-parasite association appears complex and will require considerable effort to resolve...|$|R

40|$|<b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>lasts</b> <b>two</b> decades equal channel angular {{pressing}} (ECAP) {{has been}} widely used to produce ultrafine grained microstructures with excellent mechanical properties in metallic materials. In this paper, a crystal plasticity finite element method (CPFEM) investigation {{has been carried out}} to examine the texture evolution and deformation heterogeneity of copper single crystals deformed by ECAP process. Two single crystals were simulated to examine the influence of initial crystallographic orientation. In the first crystal, the (111) slip plane and the [110] slip direction have been rotated by 20 ° in a clockwise direction around the transverse direction from the theoretical shear plane and theoretical shear direction of the ECAP die, respectively. By contrast in the second crystal, the (111) slip plane and the [110] slip direction were rotated 20 ° in a counter‐clockwise direction. The results of the simulation show that the initial crystallographic orientation has a great influence on the deformed geometry, formation of the corner gap, distribution of the plastic strain rate and texture evolution when copper single crystals are undergoing ECAP process. The crystallographic rotation patterns during deformation have been quantitatively estimated and the predicted textures are consistent with the experimental results in the literature...|$|R

According to version 2, students learn to use these practices when developing evidence-based explanations and when communicating ideas (Duschl and Grandy 2013).|$|R
