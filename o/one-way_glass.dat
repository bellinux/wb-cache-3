25|$|In 2002, the British artist Rod Dickinson created The Milgram Re-enactment, {{an exact}} {{reconstruction}} {{of parts of}} the original experiment, including the uniforms, lighting, and rooms used. An audience watched the four-hour performance through <b>one-way</b> <b>glass</b> windows. A video of this performance was first shown at the CCA Gallery in Glasgow in 2002.|$|E
25|$|The {{front door}} is {{equipped}} with a chain bolt, a bell that can be shut off as needed, and a pane of <b>one-way</b> <b>glass,</b> which enables Archie to see who is on the stoop before deciding whether to open the door. The front room is used as a waiting area for visitors while Archie informs Wolfe of their arrival, and also as a place for Archie to hide one visitor from another.|$|E
2500|$|In the Strange Situation, the toddler's {{behavior}} and stress is observed during a 21-minute free-play session through a <b>one-way</b> <b>glass</b> window as the caregiver and strangers come into {{and leave the}} room. The specific sequence of events is as follows: ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{structure}} {{itself is}} built of acid-washed concrete and faced in steel and glass, providing a high reflective surface, {{intended to be}} reminiscent of a [...] "sparkling white ‘Le Corbusier’ style, shining in the sun". The lower three floors (office) are faced with highly reflective <b>one-way</b> mirrored <b>glass,</b> while the remainder is green tinted glass panels, similar to those later used on the 66 metre Velocity Tower.|$|R
5000|$|The main NSA {{headquarters}} and operations building is what James Bamford, author of Body of Secrets, describes as [...] "a modern boxy structure" [...] that appears similar to [...] "any stylish office building." [...] The building {{is covered with}} <b>one-way</b> dark <b>glass,</b> which is lined with copper shielding {{in order to prevent}} espionage by trapping in signals and sounds. It contains 3000000 sq ft, or more than 68 acre, of floor space; Bamford said that the U.S. Capitol [...] "could easily fit inside it four times over." ...|$|R
50|$|House for Pigs and PeopleThe project House for Pigs and People, for documenta X in Kassel in 1997, was one {{of several}} collaborations {{realized}} by Höller in cooperation with the artist Rosemarie Trockel. It consisted of a box-like house structure with a concrete surface. Inside, the space was divided by a sheet of glass, separating two sections of the house—one side for pigs, the other side for people. The partition was <b>one-way</b> mirror <b>glass,</b> enabling the people to see the pigs, but not the other way around. The piece is a metaphor of ecological and social division, as well as an epistemological critique.|$|R
2500|$|The mechitza at the Bostoner Rebbe's synagogue Brookline, MA is made {{entirely of}} panels from the Boston John Hancock Tower (which were being removed due to safety concerns). The Bostoner Rebbe chose these panels {{because they are}} <b>one-way</b> <b>glass</b> so the women can see out, but men cannot see into the women's section. (Later, the Rebbe's wife put the {{curtains}} inside the women's section; so, now, women cannot see into the men's section either.) ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} {{accommodate}} stricter interpretations {{and provide a}} way for women to see, many synagogues will make an opaque wall that is 3–4 feet high and add a lattice, screen, <b>one-way</b> <b>glass,</b> or other semi-transparent material above that opaque wall. [...] The design shown above {{is an example of}} that design: [...] the etched glass is semi-transparent, while the opaque wall adheres to what the synagogue requires as the minimum height requirement. [...] A similar design is in the Or Torah synagogue in Skokie, Illinois.|$|E
2500|$|Hand {{signals are}} used to assist the [...] "eye in the sky", a person or video camera located above the table and {{sometimes}} concealed behind <b>one-way</b> <b>glass.</b> The eye in the sky usually makes a video recording of the table, which helps in resolving disputes and identifying dealer mistakes, and {{is also used to}} protect the casino against dealers who steal chips or players who cheat. The recording can further be used to identify advantage players whose activities, while legal, make them undesirable customers. In the event of a disagreement between a player's hand signals and their words, the hand signal takes precedence.|$|E
25|$|The EV1 was {{not only}} used to {{showcase}} the electric powertrain, but also premiered a number of features and technologies that would later find their way onto more common GM models and other manufacturers' cars. The EV1 {{was among the first}} production vehicles to utilize aluminum {{in the construction of the}} frame. The car's body panels were made of plastic rather than metal, making the car lightweight and dent resistant. The vehicle was fitted with Anti-lock brakes and a traction control system. Comfort improvements included a keyless entry and ignition system, a special <b>one-way</b> thermal <b>glass</b> for better heat rejection on sunny days, an automated tire pressure loss warning system, electric power steering, and a time-programmable HVAC system.|$|R
5000|$|The Moon Man was {{so named}} because he {{concealed}} his identity with a spherical helmet of Argus (<b>one-way</b> mirror) <b>glass,</b> which gave a mirrored appearance. The {{one of a kind}} helmet was hinged, allowing him to don it and had an inbuilt disperser so he did not fog up the inside of his helmet by his breathing. He also wore a black robe with black gloves. Though the Moon Man robbed mainly from villains, he was viewed by the police as a criminal and was wanted for very many burglaries, two kidnappings and a murder. All the loot he took was distributed secretly to the poor of Great City (it {{was in the midst of}} the Great Depression) by the Moon Man's ally, Ned [...] "Angel" [...] Dargan, an ex-boxer he had saved from starvation and sickness.|$|R
50|$|Milk can {{be shipped}} in many forms. One of the {{traditional}} forms was reusable returnable glass milk bottles, often home delivered by a milkman. While some of this continues, other options have recently been more common: one-way gable-top paperboard cartons, one-way aseptic cartons, <b>one-way</b> recyclable <b>glass</b> bottles, <b>one-way</b> milk bags, and others. Each system claims some advantages and also has possible disadvantages. From the zero waste standpoint, the reuse of bottles is beneficial because the material usage per trip can be less than other systems. The primary input (or resource) is silica-sand, which is formed into glass and then into a bottle. The bottle is filled with milk and distributed to the consumer. A reverse logistics system returns the bottles for cleaning, inspection, sanitization, and reuse. Eventually the heavy duty bottle would not be suited for further use and would be recycled. Waste and landfill usage would be minimized. The material waste is primarily the wash water, detergent, transportation, heat, bottle caps, etc. While true zero waste is never achieved, a life cycle assessment {{can be used to}} calculate the waste at each phase of each cycle.|$|R
2500|$|... 6. [...] Separate room: [...] {{the most}} strict {{separation}} has {{women in a}} separate room from the men, able to view through <b>one-way</b> <b>glass,</b> an open window from a balcony, or not view at all. [...] Examples of this are the Yeshiva of Ohr Someach {{in the neighborhood of}} Maalot Dafna in Jerusalem, where the men sit in a first floor room with a two story ceiling, and the women are on the second floor with a window overlooking the men's prayer hall. [...] A similar design (men first floor, women second floor) is in 770 Eastern Parkway, the main synagogue for the Chabad Lubavitch movement in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, and the Main Belzer Shul in Jerusalem.|$|E

40|$|This second {{semester}} {{our project}} was to transform a ‘generic city’ into its urban context among 15 other blocks. My Group {{is responsible for the}} city, Dubrovnik, Croatia. My block among the quarter city is number A 2. We were to research and understand the Dubrovnik culture, lifestyle, and architecture styles and were to transform one part of our individual site into a functional building, co-existing {{with the rest of the}} site. Within my site I have transformed one building into a homey local hotel, which the entire group has agreed upon. This hotel comprises of residential suites, with a whole set, kitchen, living room, dining room, bedroom and a bathroom. Among all that, double bedrooms, single bedrooms, we also have several facilities such as; pool, café, restaurant, gym, and a sauna. Due to the compact rows of buildings, next to one another, privacy is the primary issue of the hotel. This hotel is designed in way to ensure the privacy of the customers is executed. The building is covered in a <b>one-way</b> reflective <b>glass,</b> allowing only the customers to view outside and there are only reflective views of the neighbouring buildings when viewed from outside. Due to the reflective glass it allows the hotel building to fuse with its surrounding buildings, and receive its total mirrored reflection blending the rows of buildings together. In addition, the hotel includes a courtyard. It merges the building to the outside environment as one. The courtyard is located in the middle of the hotel building; it separates the public and levels of private spaces within the hotel and provides an obvious circulation path. Furthermore, it eliminates the sense of compression within the hotel. The hotel has also incorporated the Dubrovnik lifestyle and culture, by situating the pool on the roof of the hotel. This also provides open space environment and allows maximum sun exposure. DESA 1002 (Design and Practice...|$|R
50|$|The {{popularity}} of the television series 'The Invisible Bird Photographer' among children inspired Bence to design wildlife photography playgrounds, introducing children to wildlife photography. The hides are equipped with <b>one-way</b> <b>glass,</b> electric heating and nextboxes as well as monkey bars and slides {{in order to encourage}} children take part in outdoor activities.|$|E
50|$|Bence Máté is a Hungarian {{wildlife}} photographer. He {{pioneered the}} <b>one-way</b> <b>glass</b> photography technique now popular among hide-based nature photographers around the world. In 2010, his image 'Marvel of Ants' won the prestigious Wildlife Photographer of the Year grand title, {{making him the}} only contestant to date to win the grand title prizes in both the young and adult categories of the competition.|$|E
50|$|The new {{facility}} {{was the first}} Brewster post office to occupy a space that was specifically designed for the purpose, rather than being retrofitted from some previous use. It had a separate lobby to house post office boxes, a loading dock {{at the rear of}} the building and a postal inspector's separate entrance and hallway with <b>one-way</b> <b>glass</b> for observing postal workers and the public.|$|E
50|$|The {{album was}} created in {{sessions}} {{open to the public}} as part of an art installation at Somerset House in London called Recording in Progress. The sessions were forty-five minutes each in length and began on 16 January 2015 and concluded on February 14, 2015. Viewers could see Harvey create the album through <b>one-way</b> <b>glass</b> with producers Flood and John Parish, who both worked on Harvey's previous album, Let England Shake.|$|E

5000|$|In [...] "47 Seconds", Beckett reveals to {{a suspect}} that she remembered {{every second of}} being shot, not realizing that Castle was {{watching}} behind the <b>one-way</b> <b>glass</b> mirror. As a result, although Castle tried to hide it, he started to become distant with her, much to Beckett's confusion, concluding that she never mentioned her memory of the event because she didn't return his feelings and didn't want to create an awkward situation.|$|E
50|$|Arising from a {{successful}} bid for Mathematics and Computing College Status, {{the school has}} included a room specifically designed for lesson observation. It might look like an ordinary classroom; the only apparently unusual feature is a large mirror set {{into one of the}} walls. What appears to be a mirror, however, is actually a piece of <b>one-way</b> <b>glass,</b> Behind the glass is an observation booth, from which a teacher, or group of teachers, can observe the lesson and quietly discuss what is happening.|$|E

50|$|On 1 October 2003, {{at the age}} of 18, Bence {{founded a}} company and began to make a living from photo competitions, lectures, writing articles, {{building}} exhibitions and selling images, while continuing to spend thousands of hours in his hides. In November 2004, he switched from analogue to digital technology. In spring 2005, he experimented with a <b>one-way</b> <b>glass</b> photo technique, which allows him to photograph shy animals more closely without disturbing them. This technique soon became widespread among photographers shooting from hides.|$|E
50|$|In 2006, Bence {{launched}} an enterprise based on wildlife photography tourism. He renovated a farm {{and turned it}} {{into one of the most}} popular photographic venues for hide-based photography in Europe, thanks largely to his innovative <b>one-way</b> <b>glass</b> hides, which have transformed the practice of hide photography. In the same year, he was named Hungary's 'Wildlife Photographer of the Year' for the first time. He won this title in 2006, 2008, 2010, 2013, 2015, more times than any other person in the history of the competition.|$|E
50|$|To ensure {{fairness}} and reliability, {{there are certain}} recognised procedures for identity parades. The police also have standing rules to govern identity-parade procedures. Nowadays identity parades are often videotaped to minimise disputes about what occurred in or was established by them. Some specially-fitted identity-parade rooms have <b>one-way</b> <b>glass</b> so that witnesses do not feel intimidated by confrontation with possible suspects. Sometimes identity parades are not possible or feasible, in which case photo parades take place. For the suitable conditions for photo parades, see S v Ndika.|$|E
5000|$|The synagogue {{building}} is modeled after a Polish Hasidic shtiebel. The front doors are {{replicas of the}} doors fronting the Rema synagogue in Kraków. A huge mural depicting the Warsaw Ghetto appears inside the entrance. Israeli artist Ofra Friedland was commissioned to produce [...] "murals, ceramics, paintings, bronze sculpture, stained glass windows, woodwork and stone artwork" [...] throughout the synagogue. In the main sanctuary, the 6 ft high mechitza separating the men's and women's sections contains <b>one-way</b> <b>glass</b> so that women can observe the proceedings.|$|E
50|$|The project {{consisted}} of a web of CIA-run safehouses in San Francisco, Marin, and New York City. It was established in order to {{study the effects of}} LSD on unconsenting individuals. Prostitutes on the CIA payroll were instructed to lure clients back to the safehouses, where they were surreptitiously plied {{with a wide range of}} substances, including LSD, and monitored behind <b>one-way</b> <b>glass.</b> Every one of these acts was blatantly illegal, but several significant operational techniques were developed in this theater, including extensive research into sexual blackmail, surveillance technology, and the possible use of mind-altering drugs in field operations.|$|E

5000|$|According to John Bowker (theologian), traditionally, Jewish [...] "men {{and women}} pray separately. This {{goes back to}} ancient times when women could go {{only as far as}} the second court of the Temple." [...] The reason for this is so that the men do not gaze at the women (which in itself can be a sin) and get distracted from their prayers. Technically, however, a {{physical}} barrier of over four feet or so (ten handbreadths) suffices, even if the men can see the women, though it is not preferable. A typical mechitzah consists of wheeled wooden panels, often topped with <b>one-way</b> <b>glass</b> to allow women to view the Torah reading.|$|E
5000|$|... "Guilty" [...] was {{recorded}} during the sessions for PJ Harvey's ninth studio album, The Hope Six Demolition Project (2016). The sessions {{were held in}} a purpose-built studio in Somerset House in London, England from 15 January to 14 February 2015 as part of Recording in Progress, where {{members of the public}} could observe the sessions through <b>one-way</b> <b>glass</b> at 45-minute intervals. Several publications listed [...] "Guilty" [...] as among the song titles written on a wall chart in the studio {{during the first week of}} the sessions, and the track was finished by the end of January, according to the single's official press release.|$|E

50|$|Meanwhile, in the brig, Athena {{meets with}} Caprica Six who offers words of {{consolation}} and encouragement and states that her best chances lie with helping the humans. In an adjacent room, Roslin and Tory watch the discussion through <b>one-way</b> <b>glass.</b> Athena tells Caprica Six {{that she will}} see to her being treated fairly during Baltar's trial, but suddenly, Caprica Six's imaginary Baltar appears who asks about Caprica Six's desire to help the humans, speculating that she perhaps wishes {{to become one of}} them. Athena leaves saying she will return later with a change of clothes for her. Caprica Six talks to Baltar and they engage in a kiss. When Tory asks what she is doing, Roslin states she's seen this before, that she believes Caprica Six is communicating with someone they can't see.|$|E
5000|$|..... it was fun, fun, fun. Where {{else could}} a red-blooded American boy lie, kill, cheat, steal, rape and pillage with the {{sanction}} and bidding of the All-highest?"
