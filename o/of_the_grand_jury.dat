5|$|Rocket Science premiered on January 19, 2007 at the Sundance Film Festival and was theatrically {{released}} on August 10. It {{was not a}} financial success, earning only US$756,000 from its $4.5 million budget, though it was well-received by critics. Reviewers praised Thompson and Kendrick's performances and the film's parallels to real life; others believed that the film was deliberately quirky and forgettable. It was nominated for Sundance's Dramatic Grand Jury Prize and three Independent Spirit Awards. Though it failed to win any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Grand</b> <b>Jury</b> Prizes at Sundance, Blitz won its Dramatic Directing Award.|$|E

Due process is also the catchall vehicle for the enforcement of fundamental fairness, even if the infirmities of a given prosecution do not neatly sound in another enumerated provision.|$|E

5|$|On Monday, April 4, U.S. Attorney Garret S. Cannon {{took over}} the {{prosecution}} and moved that Jackalow {{be transferred to the}} U.S. Marshall in the Essex County Jail. Voorhies again objected to jurisdiction, arguing that if the alleged murder was committed in the Long Island Sound it could only be tried in New York. Vroom on the other hand held that a showing of probable cause had been made. Further, he argued that he had jurisdiction {{on the grounds that the}} murder was committed between the state of New York and the Norwalk Islands, and Jackalow's robbery had in any case continued until his arrival in Barnegat. Jackalow was remanded to Newark to await the decision <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury.</b>|$|E
5|$|In November 1955, a {{grand jury}} {{declined}} to indict Bryant and Milam for kidnapping, despite their own admissions of having taken Till. Mose Wright and {{a young man named}} Willie Reed, who testified to seeing Milam enter the shed from which screams and blows were heard, both testified in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury.</b> After the trial, T.R.M.Howard paid the costs of relocating to Chicago for Wright, Reed, and another black witness who testified against Milam and Bryant, {{in order to protect the}} three witnesses from reprisals for having testified. Reed, who later changed his name to Willie Louis to avoid being found, continued to live in the Chicago area until his death on July 18, 2013. He avoided publicity and even kept his history secret from his wife until she was told by a relative. Reed began to speak publicly about the case in the PBS documentary The Murder of Emmett Till aired in 2003.|$|E
5|$|On Thursday, April 7, 2011, {{instead of}} {{pleading}} guilty, {{as had been}} expected based on the previous statements, the Garridos {{pleaded not guilty to}} charges of kidnapping and raping Dugard, as well as other charges, in an amended Grand Jury indictment. Phillip's attorney, public defender Susan Gellman, alleged that the grand jury might have been selected improperly and might have acted improperly. Gellman did not elaborate on her claim in the courtroom, but said outside that she had questions about the racial and geographic makeup <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> that originally indicted the Garridos in September 2010. Judge Phimister noted that there were issues about the process itself before the grand jury, and also stated that the court would consider whether the grand jury acted appropriately. These developments were largely unforeseen by attorney Stephen Tapson, who represented Nancy; Tapson had said earlier that week that Phillip had made a deal with prosecutors to plead guilty and {{spend the rest of his}} life in prison. Gellman was upset with Tapson for telling reporters that her client had planned to plead guilty, saying that he should only speak about his own client, Nancy. Tapson said he found out about Gellman's plans only late on April 6. Neither attorney would elaborate further on the specific concerns about the grand jury. El Dorado, California District Attorney Vern Pierson said he did not think the complaints about the grand jury would ultimately derail the case against the Garridos.|$|E

50|$|The {{question}} {{addressed by}} the court was whether a district court may properly dismiss an indictment when the prosecutor withheld “substantial exculpatory evidence” that could lead <b>the</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> to reject <b>the</b> indictment, {{but that does not}} necessarily rise to <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> prosecutorial misconduct, which would require <b>the</b> dismissal <b>of</b> an indictment. <b>The</b> significance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ruling lies not only in its definition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> duty <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prosecutor in regard to presenting exculpatory evidence before <b>the</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury,</b> but also in its definition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury's</b> accusatory role.|$|R

25|$|On April 6, 1970, a Dukes County {{grand jury}} {{assembled}} in special session to investigate Kopechne's death.

Citing the orders of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, Paquet told the grand jury {{that it could not}} see the evidence or Boyle's report from the inquest, which were still impounded. Dinis, who had attended the inquest and seen Boyle's report, told the grand jury that there was not enough evidence to indict Kennedy on potential charges of manslaughter, perjury or driving to endanger. The grand jury called four witnesses who had not testified at the inquest: they testified for a total of 20 minutes, but no indictments were issued.|$|E
25|$|In 1956, the Jack Barry-hosted {{game show}} Twenty One {{featured}} a contestant, Herb Stempel, {{who had been}} coached by producer Dan Enright to allow his opponent, Charles Van Doren, to win the game.

A year later, Stempel told the New York Journal-Americans Jack O'Brien that his run as champion on the series had been choreographed {{and that he had}} been ordered to purposely lose his championship to Van Doren. With no proof, an article was never printed. Stempel's statements gained more credibility when match fixing in another game, Dotto, was publicized in August 1958. Quiz show ratings across the networks plummeted and several were cancelled amidst allegations of fixing. The revelations were sufficient to initiate a nine-month long County of New York grand jury. No indictments were handed down, and the findings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> were sealed by judge's order.|$|E
