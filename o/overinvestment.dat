Overproduction and overaccumulation were, he argued, inseparable phenomena, and surplus value could not be realized as profit income unless output was sold; consequently the average rate of profit and the rate of market expansion mutually determined each other. He maintained that falling profits were only one factor in the recurrent sequence from boom to slump. He argued that the basic reason why capitalist crises occurred is that capitalism is a system of production run by competing producers, based on private property. In this system, [...] "what is rational {{from the standpoint of the}} system as a whole is not rational from the standpoint of each great firm taken separately, and vice versa." [...] According to Mandel, that also explained why bourgeois macroeconomics and microeconomics contained quite different principles and concepts of economic behaviour (in contrast to Marx's economics, where macro and micro share the same concepts). Thus, in every branch of economic activity, capitalist business could never escape from recurrent problems of <b>overinvestment</b> and underinvestment, which periodically culminated in general crises. Following György Lukács, Mandel portrays capitalist rationality as a [...] "contradictory combination of partial rationality and overall irrationality." [...] It is not that competing businessmen are [...] "irrational", far from it, but that their own [...] "instrumental rationality" [...] and [...] "value rationality" [...] (in a Weberian sense) differ from the functional logic of capitalism as a system, and therefore the two run into serious conflicts at times - leading to crises.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the role of}} long-term debt in influencing <b>overinvestments</b> by analyzing the pattern of abnormal investments around a new debt offering by unlevered firms. Before being levered when the disciplining role of debt is missing, firms retain excessive amounts of cash. The introduction of debt leads to a dramatic decline in cash ratios and the relation is stronger for firms classified as having poor investment opportunities. For the sub-sample of firms that overinvest in real assets, issuing debt leads {{to a reduction in}} abnormal capital expenditures. The decline in <b>overinvestments</b> is explained by debt service obligations that reduce discretionary funds under managerial control.

50|$|Since the 1950s, {{the capital}} {{construction}} {{industry has been}} plagued by excessive growth and compartmentalization. There were frequent cost overruns and construction delays, and resources were overtaxed. Project directors often failed to predict accurately the need for such elements as transportation, raw materials, and energy. A large number of small factories were built, providing surplus capacity at the national level but with deficient economies of scale at the plant level. Poor cooperation among ministries and provinces resulted in unnecessary duplication. Because each area strove for self-sufficiency in all phases of construction, specialization suffered. Since {{the early years of the}} People's Republic, <b>overinvestment</b> in construction has been a persistent problem. Fiscal reforms in 1979 and 1980 exacerbated <b>overinvestment</b> by allowing local governments to keep a much greater percentage of the revenue from enterprises in their respective areas. Local governments could then use the retained earnings to invest in factories in their areas. These investments, falling outside the national economic plan, interfered with the central government's control of capital investment.|$|E

Since agency theory also suggests that a divergence between the interests of managers and shareholders can be aligned by effective managerial incentive, we also examine the effect of managerial compensation on the value of multinationality. Our results show that for high-"Q" (Tobin's "Q > 1 ") firms, investors do not associate the spending of free cash flow on multinationality with the problem of <b>overinvestments.</b> For high-"Q" firms, it is also found that the value of multinationality can be enhanced by effective managerial incentives.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{investigate}} {{changes in how}} long students stay in education, but also how they learn, when screening becomes more important. Using a human capital production function with different learning activities as inputs I show that when education becomes a better signal, initially students will increase study efforts, but also shift from unobservable to observable activities. This shift will lower the return to education and therefore – when the importance of screening further increases – also reduce efforts. By comparing study behavior in 69 European regions I find indeed a reduction in hours spend on learning. I show that empirically the shift in learning activities corresponds to a decrease in high quality education and good testing to freedom to choose, and combining learning with work and experience abroad. An important implication is that screening not necessarily leads to <b>overinvestments</b> in education, but {{can also lead to}} inefficient learning.

40|$|Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) {{is often}} {{portrayed as a}} policy that will {{mitigate}} climate change whilst fostering social and environmental improvements in the most isolated and under-developed regions of the world. Our work sets out to assess this cl aim by evaluating whether REDD is effectively designed as an instrument that is suitable for generating local development in forest regions. After revealing the underlying governance rationale through which REDD is expected to generate positive outcomes on the global and local levels, we develop a framework to assess whether the REDD strategies developed through the FCPF and the UN-REDD Readiness initiatives are putting in place the policy environment that is necessary for REDD {{to function as a}} development mechanism. Through the comparative analysis of six national Readiness strategies from the Latin American region, we reveal that policies designed under Readiness systematically {{pay more attention to the}} development of baseline emissions scenarios and MRV systems than to the establishment of the policy conditions that must be in place for REDD to generate local development. Our analysis suggests that a number of policy design elements might be resulting in the failure of national REDD strategies to address underlying governance problems. The phased approach to Readiness creates incentives for governments to rush through the institutional reform stages, and REDD’s current design only rewards quantifiable GHG emissions reductions, providing few incentives for countries to invest in social and environmental improvements. Furthermore, the reliance on carbon market finance and the operational structure of the FCPF may also result in <b>overinvestments</b> in MRV systems to the detriment of more complex institutional reforms. We conclude by presenting a set of recommendations for reforming the underlying governance logic of REDD in order to enhance its potential as a local development mechanism...|$|R
40|$|Society relies {{more and}} more on a {{continuous}} supply of electricity. However, while underinvestments in reliability lead to an unacceptable number of power interruptions, <b>overinvestments</b> result in too high costs for society. To give incentives for a socioeconomically optimal level of reliability, quality regulations have been adopted in many European countries. These quality regulations imply new financial risks for the distribution system operator (DSO) since poor reliability can reduce the allowed revenue for the DSO and compensation may have to be paid to affected customers. This thesis develops a method for evaluating the incentives for reliability investments implied by different quality regulation designs. The method can be used to investigate whether socioeconomically beneficial projects are also beneficial for a profit-maximizing DSO subject to a particular quality regulation design. To investigate which reinvestment projects are preferable for society and a DSO, risk-based methods are developed. With these methods, the probability of power interruptions and the consequences of these can be simulated. The consequences of interruptions for the DSO will to a large extent depend on the quality regulation. The consequences for the customers, and hence also society, will depend on factors such as the interruption duration and time of occurrence. The proposed risk-based methods consider extreme outage events in the risk assessments by incorporating the impact of severe weather, estimating the full probability distribution of the total reliability cost, and formulating a risk-averse strategy. Results from case studies performed show that quality regulation design has a significant impact on reinvestment project profitability for a DSO. In order to adequately capture the financial risk that the DSO is exposed to, detailed risk-based methods, such as the ones developed in this thesis, are needed. Furthermore, when making investment decisions, a risk-averse strategy may clarify the benefits or drawbacks of a project that are hard to discover by looking only at the expected net present value.
