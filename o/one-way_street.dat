5|$|A Caversham bypass was {{constructed}} in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and was officially opened in 1987. It now carries State Highway 1 away from the retail heart of the suburb, connecting at its northern end with the city's <b>one-way</b> <b>street</b> system. With {{the construction of the}} bypass, Caversham Valley Road was truncated close to its junction with South Road, and the upper stretch of the road continued as part of State Highway 1, connecting the bypass with Dunedin Southern Motorway.|$|E
5|$|At Unionville, M-25 turns more {{westerly}} {{to round}} {{the bottom of}} Saginaw Bay into Bay City along Bay City-Forestville Road in Tuscola County. In the community of Quanicassee, it transitions to Center Road and crosses into Bay County. M-25 is routed the <b>one-way</b> <b>street</b> pair of 7th Street and McKinley Street before crossing the Veterans Memorial Bridge over the Saginaw River. West of the bridge, the one-way pairing of Jenny Street and Thomas Street are used before the two merge into Thomas Street west of the M-13 intersections.|$|E
5|$|Nine of Milwaukee Avenue's houses {{had to be}} {{destroyed}} due to their decrepit conditions and a tenth was moved elsewhere. In the spaces where these houses once stood, townhomes were built, mirroring {{the style of the}} original houses. The rest of the houses got indoor plumbing, new basements, improved woodwork and porches added on. Additionally, a pedestrian mall was built down the center of Milwaukee Avenue to replace a <b>one-way</b> <b>street.</b> The Avenue is now bike and pedestrian friendly, and cars are prohibited.|$|E
5000|$|On occasion, [...] "couplet" [...] {{has been}} applied {{specifically}} {{to the point where}} the <b>one-way</b> <b>streets</b> and the two-way street meet, rather than the paired <b>one-way</b> <b>streets</b> themselves.|$|R

25|$|The {{city centre}} {{is laid out}} in a grid pattern, {{interrupted}} only by the curvilinear alignment of the Avon River, and the two diagonals High Street and Victoria Street. Christchurch has four pairs of <b>one-way</b> <b>streets.</b> The grid pattern within the outermost <b>one-way</b> <b>streets</b> is very regular, as this is the area that was laid out in the original survey. The surrounding area, i.e. the belt between the outer <b>one-way</b> <b>streets</b> and the avenues, was developed later in a progressive fashion and does not have the regularity of the core area.|$|R
5|$|M-13/M-84 {{crosses the}} west channel of the Saginaw River near the Ted Putz Nature Area to Middle Ground island. The highway {{continues}} over the east channel on the Lafayette Avenue Bridge, a drawbridge, to Lafayette Avenue {{on the eastern}} bank of the river. At the intersection with Broadway Street, M-13 turns southward, and M-84 continues eastward two more blocks. Turning north on Garfield Street, the highway runs parallel to the river through a residential area. North of the 14th Street intersection, Garfield Street curves northeasterly into Washington Avenue, passing {{to the east of}} an industrial complex on the river. At the intersection with McKinley Street, a <b>one-way</b> <b>street,</b> M-84 meets the eastbound direction of M-25 and BS I-75. One block north, M-84 terminates at the intersection with 7th Street, which carries westbound M-25 and BS I-75; both intersections also mark BS I-75's terminus immediately east of the Veterans Memorial Bridge.|$|E
5|$|NY61 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY384 (Buffalo Avenue) on the industrial {{banks of the}} Niagara River in eastern Niagara Falls. The route, named Hyde Park Boulevard for its entire length, heads north initially as a city-maintained, undivided four-lane highway; after two blocks, the roadway widens and becomes maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation. NY61 continues onward through the densely populated neighborhoods of Niagara Falls to Packard Road, where the route begins to parallel Gill Creek, a small stream leading south to the Niagara River. After five blocks, NY61 intersects with Ferry Avenue, a <b>one-way</b> <b>street</b> carrying southbound U.S. Route62 (US62), {{in the area of}} the Niagara Falls Courthouse. NY61 intersects with northbound US62 three blocks later at Walnut Avenue. At the intersection, Gill Creek passes under both US62 northbound and NY61 as it switches to the east side of Hyde Park Boulevard.|$|E
5|$|M-50 {{also joined}} the freeway at Cascade Road headed east, and {{together}} I-96/US16/M-50 continued through eastern Kent County. M-50 departed {{to the south}} near Lowell, and the freeway crossed into southern Ionia County. Passing south of Portland, the freeway crossed east into Clinton County. North of Grand Ledge, I-96 ended and US16 followed Wright Road off the freeway to Grand River Avenue. From there east, US16 resumed its historic routing into the city of Lansing. Grand River Avenue carried the highway past the Capital City Airport and east to Larch Street, where US16 turned south along US27 north of downtown Lansing. At Saginaw Street, eastbound US16 turned east on the <b>one-way</b> <b>street,</b> while westbound traffic ran a block north on Grand River Avenue. The two directions of travel merge at {{the east end of}} Saginaw Street in East Lansing. Grand River Avenue through East Lansing follows a tree-lined boulevard that forms the division between the campus of Michigan State University to the south {{and the rest of the}} city to the north. US16 continued east in Ingham County through Okemos and rural parts of the county through Williamston and Webberville.|$|E
50|$|The route {{connects the}} city center with the freeway. As the {{settlers}} of Utah laid their towns with amply wide <b>streets,</b> <b>one-way</b> <b>streets</b> are rare in the city, SR-269 being one of two such pairs in existence. As part of I-15's construction in the 1960s, planners felt that two <b>one-way</b> <b>streets</b> with many lanes leading {{to and from the}} freeway would be better utilized. The <b>one-way</b> <b>streets</b> continue (as non-state highways) east of US-89 to the block west of Trolley Square before becoming two-way and then intersecting SR-71.|$|R
50|$|In {{downtown}} Davenport, US 61 Bus. intersects US 67 at two <b>one-way</b> <b>streets,</b> Harrison Street southbound and Brady Street northbound. Continuing east {{along the}} river, River Drive passes under the Government Bridge. It enters Bettendorf and becomes two <b>one-way</b> <b>streets,</b> Grant Street southbound and State Street northbound. The two streets intersect Interstate 74 (I-74) and US 6 {{at the foot}} of the I-74 Bridges near downtown Bettendorf.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the context}} of roads, a one-way pair {{consists}} of two <b>one-way</b> <b>streets</b> whose flows combine on one or both ends into a single two-way <b>street.</b> The <b>one-way</b> <b>streets</b> may be separated by just a single block, such as in a grid network, or may be spaced further apart with intermediate parallel roads. One use of a one-way pair {{is to increase the}} capacity of a major route through a congested area such as a central business district. A one-way pair can be created by converting segments of two-way <b>streets</b> into <b>one-way</b> <b>streets,</b> which allows lanes to be added without widening.|$|R
5|$|There {{was nothing}} to link Murat or his friends to the disappearance, and Murat's arguido status was lifted on 21 July 2008 when the case was archived. In April 2008 he {{received}} £600,000 in out-of-court settlements for libel in what The Observer said was {{the largest number of}} separate libel actions brought in the UK by the same person in relation to one issue; his friends received £100,000 each. In July 2014, during Operation Grange, one of those friends was questioned again as a witness, this time by the Polícia Judiciária on behalf of Scotland Yard. In December that year Murat and his wife were questioned, also on behalf of Scotland Yard, along with eight others. In 2017 Murat's mother, Jenny Murat, added her voice to those who had witnessed suspicious events around 5A that night: she told the BBC that she had driven past apartment 5A that night, and had seen a young woman in a plum-coloured top behaving suspiciously just outside it, information she said she passed to the police at the time. She also said she had seen a small brown rental car speeding toward the apartment, driving the wrong way down a <b>one-way</b> <b>street.</b>|$|E
5|$|Willet Street is a {{northbound}} <b>one-way</b> <b>street</b> comprising three blocks, {{stretching from}} the southeastern corner of the park at the intersection with Madison Avenue to the northeastern corner with State Street. All of Willett Street is in the historic district, including approximately 33 buildings. The street is entirely residential except for the First Presbyterian Church, built in 1883 on the corner with State Street. Willett Street has many different styles including Queen Anne, Spanish Revival, Classical revival, Georgian, Romanesque, Italianate, and brownstones. Two larger apartment buildings, built in 1909 and 1927, break up the otherwise continuous row of older townhouses. One of those apartment buildings is the Willett, formerly the Wareham, a five-story building built in 1909 that spans 84–92 Willett Street. This building sits on a former site of the New York State Normal College, predecessor to the University at Albany, which burned in 1906. The oldest building on Willett to maintain its original facade, 22 Willett, was built in 1872. Nearby 28 Willett Street was the home of Martin Glynn, an owner {{and publisher of the}} Albany Times Union, a state comptroller, and the governor of New York from 1913 to 1914. Glynn was the first Catholic New York governor and the only longtime Albany resident to reach that position.|$|E
5|$|MD 213 enters Elkton at the {{intersection}} with US 40 (Pulaski Highway). Past this intersection, the route heads northwest on Bridge Street, passing through commercial areas. The route intersects Main Street, which continues east of MD 213 as a <b>one-way</b> <b>street</b> eastbound. Past Main Street, the road continues north and passes over Amtrak's Northeast Corridor before intersecting MD 545 (Elkton Boulevard). MD 213 continues past commercial areas {{to the west and}} residential areas to the east before its intersection with MD 279 (Elkton Road/Newark Avenue). Past the MD 279 intersection, the route leaves Elkton and becomes Singerly Road, which continues past residences. MD 213 enters a mix of woods and farms and passes over Interstate 95 (John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway) and CSX's Philadelphia Subdivision within a short distance of each other. It continues through a mix of farms and residences before the road reaches the Leeds roundabout with Leeds Road. Past the roundabout, the route resumes north, intersecting MD 273 (Telegraph Road) in Fair Hill west of the Fair Hill Training Center, where the Atlantic to Appalachians Scenic Byway leaves MD 213 and heads west along MD 273. From here, MD 213 continues northwest and west as Lewisville Road through a mix of rural areas and residences before ending at the Pennsylvania border. Here, the road continues north as PA 841 into Lewisville, intersecting the southern terminus of PA 472 just north of the state line.|$|E

25|$|<b>One-way</b> <b>street</b> {{systems can}} be viewed as either a product of traffic {{management}} that focuses on trying to keep motorized vehicles moving regardless of the social and other impacts, such as by some cycling campaigners, or seen as a useful tool for traffic calming, and for eliminating rat runs, in the view of UK traffic planners.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is often}} also {{incorrectly}} {{stated that the}} tracks were removed in the 1990s when the downtown area was redesigned with two <b>one-way</b> <b>streets</b> to enhance traffic along Gravenstein Highway (Route 116).

Woodmont Avenue, which becomes a southbound <b>one-way</b> <b>street</b> at the intersection, leads to Montgomery Lane, which provides access to MD 355 and eastbound MD 410 (Montgomery Avenue). MD 187 heads northwest from Woodmont Avenue as a four-lane highway with center turn lane that passes through a five-way intersection with MD 188 (Wilson Lane), Arlington Road, and St. Elmo Avenue and leaves downtown Bethesda. The state highway veers north and becomes a six-lane divided highway north of Huntington Parkway at Suburban Hospital, which sits opposite {{the southern end of}} the National Institutes of Health campus. MD 187 intersects several entrances to the federal campus and passes to the east of the tiny village of Oakmont at its junction with Cedar Lane.|$|E
