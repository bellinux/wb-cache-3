Modest defences, based around simple blockhouses and towers, existed in the south-west and along the Sussex coast, with a few more impressive works in the north of England, but in general the fortifications were very limited in scale.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the lack}} of written sources on this period, much of Nerva's life has {{remained}} obscure. The most substantial surviving account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reign</b> <b>of</b> Nerva was written by the 3rd-century historian Cassius Dio. His Roman History, which spans nearly a millennium, from the arrival of Aeneas in Italy until the year 229, was composed more than one hundred years after Nerva had died. Further details are added by an abridged biography from the Epitome de Caesaribus, a work alleged to have been authored by the 4th-century historian Aurelius Victor.|$|E

5|$|In 1257, Béla IV of Hungary (12351270) {{appointed}} {{his eldest}} son, the future Stephen V (12701272) {{to govern the}} kingdom's territories {{to the east of}} the Danube. Here the younger king ceded a significant part of his royal domains to noblemen. The first years <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reign</b> <b>of</b> Ladislaus IV of Hungary (12721290), were characterized by civil wars throughout the entire kingdom. In Transylvania, the Saxons engaged in a local conflict with the bishop, took Alba Iulia and set fire to the cathedral. The series of wars continued in 1285 with a second Mongol invasion. During its initial stage, the Székelys, the Romanians and the Saxons successfully blocked the Mongols' access and later organized a series of ambushes provoking panic among the retreating invaders.|$|E
5|$|In December, fifty-three peninsulars were banished to Salta, and the {{decision}} {{was sent to the}} Junta for approval. The vocal Domingo Matheu, who had business associations with Tulla and Pedro Salvador Casas, arranged the annulment of the act, arguing that Castelli had been influenced by slander and unfounded accusations. Support for Castelli began to decline, mainly due to the favourable treatment of natives and the determined opposition of the church, which attacked the public atheism of Bernardo Monteagudo, Castelli's secretary. Both royalists in Lima and Saavedra in Buenos Aires compared them with Maximilien Robespierre, leader <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Reign</b> <b>of</b> Terror of the French Revolution.|$|E
