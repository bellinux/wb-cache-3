25|$|The clutch size {{generally}} is 3–5 eggs {{with an average}} of four. For 22–26 days both sexes take turns incubating the eggs. The young are so precocial that they are seen swimming within two hours after hatching and are also capable of rapid land velocity at that early time. In spite of this early development the young normally return to the nest for resting for one <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>more</b> days. They fledge after about one month but remain dependent on their parents for some more weeks. Birds begin to breed at 1–2 years of age.|$|E
25|$|The deep {{depression}} {{around the}} middle of the 14th century marked the end of the period of great urban expansion.

It would not be until the Industrial Revolution that the same level of expansion of urban population would be reached again, although the number of newly created settlements would remain much lower than in the 12th and 13th centuries.|$|E

25|$|Sinocalliopteryx had an {{elongated}} {{head with a}} pointed snout, showing a convex upper profile. There were four teeth in the premaxilla which were small but exceptionally had denticles on their front edges.

Specimen CAGS-IG-T1 preserves ten maxillary tooth sockets with room for one <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>more</b> in damaged areas. The jugal was a strongly built element with a high-rising front branch that formed part of the lower front edge of the eye socket. The lower jaw lacked an opening in its outer side.|$|E
25|$|The Diamant is a conventional, low-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane {{and essentially}} an enlarged version of Piel's successful Emeraude {{designed to accommodate}} more passengers. This extra capacity is provided by a redesigned fuselage which is higher in the rear section and longer overall. While the Emeraude has only two seats, side-by-side, the Diamant has an extra bench seat {{at the rear of}} the cabin to seat one <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>more</b> people. The wingspan is also greater than that of the Emeraude, allowing for a greater maximum take-off weight. The 110 page set of plans included modifications for retractable gear, tricycle gear, and wing mounted fuel tanks.|$|E

25|$|Boat 4 {{appears to}} have had about 42 people aboard (about 40 women and {{children}} and two or three crew members) when it was lowered. As it had been ordered, Perkis steered the boat {{along the side of the}} ship in search for open gangways, since he had been told to take on board more passengers through them, but found no one. This way, the boat ended up near the davits of Boat 16 (which had been already launched), and two greasers, Thomas Ranger and Frederick William Scott, who were standing near them, climbed down the falls to Boat 4 (Scott fell into the water but was hauled aboard the lifeboat). The boat then rowed away from the ship in order to avoid suction. A third man, lamp trimmer Samuel Ernest Hemming, climbed down the falls of another lifeboat and swam over to No. 4, which was about 200 yards far. Immediately after the sinking the boat rowed back to the wreckage to pick up more survivors (the only lifeboat to try immediately to do so). The boat picked up six or seven more men (trimmer Thomas Patrick Dillon, seaman William Henry Lyons, stewards Andrew Cunningham and Sidney Conrad Siebert, storekeeper Frank Winnold Prentice, and one <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>more</b> unidentified swimmers) from the water. Two (Siebert and Lyons) later died of exposure. The number of occupants later increased when other people were transferred from Boat 14 and Collapsible Boat D. By the time it reached Carpathia at 8:00a.m. it had about 60 occupants.|$|E

[...] Usher was displeased with the decision; he felt returning to the studio was the hardest part and needed to re-motivate himself. He went on recording a few more tracks with help from fellow Atlantian's Lil Jon and Ludacris. Eventually, the team was able to produce songs like [...] "Red Light" [...] and [...] "Yeah!". He also recorded songs with P. Diddy and The Neptunes during one of those sessions, but those songs were not released.|$|E

500|$|At {{its peak}} in 1954, DuMont was {{affiliated}} with around 200 television stations. In those days, television stations were free to [...] "cherry-pick" [...] which programs they would air, and many stations affiliated with multiple networks, depending mainly {{on the number of}} commercial television stations available in a market at a given time (markets where only one commercial station was available carried programming from all four major networks). Many of DuMont's [...] "affiliates" [...] carried very little DuMont programming, choosing to air one <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>more</b> popular programs (such as Life Is Worth Living) and/or sports programming on the weekends. Few stations carried the full DuMont program lineup. For example, the promising WKLO-TV (UHF Ch. 21) in the growing Louisville, KY-IN market had to split its time between DuMont and ABC-TV. The station only lasted seven months (September 1953-April 1954) on the air.|$|E

Firefighting employees and equipment were stretched to the limit, and consequently, over 6,000 U.S. Military personnel assisted in the fire fighting efforts nationwide, with more than 600 assigned to Yellowstone. At {{the height of the}} fires, over 9,000 firefighters and support personnel were assigned to Yellowstone at one time, {{and by the time the}} fires finally went out, more than 25,000 had been involved in the fire suppression efforts. Crews would normally work for 2 to 3weeks, be sent home, and then return for one <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>more</b> tours of duty. The normal workday was as long as 14hours. Assignments included digging firelines, watering down buildings, clearing undergrowth near structures, and installing water pumps. Hundreds of firefighters were assigned to engine crews, as much of the firefighting effort was aimed at protecting structures. No firefighters died in the park as a result of the fires, but one firefighter and an aircraft pilot died in separate incidents outside the park. A number of firefighters were treated for various injuries with the more common complaints being fatigue, headaches, and smoke inhalation. A few firefighters were exposed to noxious fumes from sulfur emissions from a geothermal area.|$|E
