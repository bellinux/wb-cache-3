50|$|Predicted <b>outcome</b> <b>value</b> theory {{proposes that}} initial {{interaction}} behaviors serve two related functions in individuals' attempts to maximize future relational outcomes. First, communication {{is directed at}} reducing uncertainty (Berger & Calabrese, 1975) about new acquaintances to determine likely outcome-values for the relational future. Second, communication proceeds in a manner predicted to result in the most positive outcomes. In a broad sense, these <b>outcome</b> <b>value</b> predictions would lead to communicative attempts to terminate or curtail the conversation, to continue the entry-level conversation, or to escalate the conversation and relationship beyond this level. Attempts to continue or escalate would result from positive predicted outcome values, while attempts to terminate or curtail would result from negative predictions. Given this, predicted <b>outcome</b> <b>value</b> theory proposes that several specific behaviors associated with conversational termination-escalation should be related to predicted <b>outcome</b> <b>value</b> levels.Among these, Sunnafrank (1986) posits that predicted <b>outcome</b> <b>value</b> is positively related to amount of verbal communication, intimacy level of communication content, nonverbal affiliative expressiveness, and liking.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Tests {{that are}} usually {{employed}} for the clinical assessment of muscular strength have notable disadvantages. The Modified Sphygmomanometer Test (MST) is a promising method because it is low-cost and provides objective measures. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the most adequate method and sources of <b>outcome</b> <b>values</b> {{for the assessment of}} strength with the MST. METHOD: Methodological study with 40 healthy adults (22. 98 ± 2. 26 years), who did not practice physical activity regularly. The strength of the flexors and extensors of the elbow and knee, the handgrip of the dominant side and anterior trunk flexors were randomly assessed with portable dynamometers and the MST (bag and cuff adaptations, and sphygmomanometer without adaptation) by a single examiner. An independent examiner read and recorded the values. The sources of the investigated <b>outcome</b> <b>values</b> were the first trial and the means of two and three trials. One-way ANOVAs and Pearson Correlation Coefficients were used for the analyses (&# 945;= 0. 05). RESULTS: For the MST methods applied to assess all muscular groups, similar values were found for all sources of <b>outcome</b> <b>values</b> (0. 01 <F< 0. 26; 0. 77 <p< 1. 00) with significant and positive correlations between the measures obtained with the dynamometers (0. 51 <r< 0. 94; p< 0. 003). CONCLUSIONS: All MST methods showed adequate results for the assessment of strength in healthy individuals, and after familiarization, only one trial was sufficient to provide reliable measures. The sphygmomanometer without adaptation is not time consuming, compared to the other adaptations, and showed the capability of measuring higher values of strength. The bag method was easily trained to be used and stabilized...|$|R

50|$|Uncertainty {{reduction}} {{theory has}} sparked much {{discussion in the}} discipline of communication. Critics have argued that reducing uncertainty is not {{the driving force of}} interaction. Michael Sunnafrank's predicted <b>outcome</b> <b>value</b> theory (1986) indicated that the actual motivation for interaction is a desire for positive relational experiences. In other words, individuals engaging in initial interactions are motivated by rewards opposed to reducing uncertainties. According to Sunnafrank, when we communicate we are attempting to predict certain outcome to maximize the relational outcomes. Kellerman and Reynolds (1990) pointed out that sometimes there are high level of uncertainty in interaction that no one wants to reduce. Their study find that the central determinant of both information seeking (axiom 3) and liking (axiom 4) is the predicted outcome values rather than reducing uncertainty.|$|E

From the analysis of a sample including 178 customers of a large transportation and logistics company, the results demonstrate that process value imposes a larger effect on both affective and cognitive relationship strength than that of <b>outcome</b> <b>value.</b> Furthermore, cognitive strength is a stronger determinant of both attitudinal and behavioral loyaltyof customersthan affective strength.

40|$|When the {{probabilities of}} {{selecting}} the individuals {{for the sample}} depend on the <b>outcome</b> <b>values,</b> we say that the selection mechanism is informative. Under informative selection, individuals with certain <b>outcome</b> <b>values</b> appear more often in the sample and therefore the sample is not representative of the population. As a consequence, usual model-based inference based on the actual sample without appropriate weighting might be strongly biased. For estimation of general non-linear parameters in small areas, we propose a model-based pseudo empirical best (PEB) method that incorporates the sampling weights and reduces considerably the bias of the unweighted empirical best (EB) estimators under informative selection mechanisms. We analyze the properties of this new method in simulation experiments carried out under complex sampling designs, including informative selection. Our results confirm that the proposed weighted PEB estimators perform significantly better than the unweighted EB estimators in terms of bias under informative sampling, and compare favorably under non-informative sampling. In an application to poverty mapping in Spain, we compare the proposed weighted PEB estimators with the unweighted EB analogues.

40|$|There are {{increasing}} requirements for disclosure of future-oriented information, segmental reporting {{and information about}} financial risk management, i. e. information traditionally used internally in the management control process. The increasing influence of transnational corporations has contributed to pressure for wider accountability. An empirical study encompassing six transnational companies has been made. The research results suggest that information disclosed about goals for the group and <b>outcome</b> <b>values</b> for segments does not necessarily reflect how the company is managed. For industrial operations {{there appears to be}} a clear relationship between organization structure and goal parameters. None of these goal parameters and only certain <b>outcome</b> <b>values</b> for these parameters are disclosed which makes it difficult for external users to find out how the industrial operations are managed. For the financial activities there is no goal parameter used which is related to the goal for the group. Choice of organization structure and risk policy seems to influence disclosure. A lack of clear definitions and guidelines for futureoriented information makes difficult the comparison of what is disclosed with what it is required to disclose. The research results suggest the benefit of dealing with both management accounting and financial accounting when studying accountability. ...|$|R
