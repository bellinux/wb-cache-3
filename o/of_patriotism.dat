5|$|According to polls, {{about one}} out of three Poles say they own a Polish flag, and about {{one out of}} four fly it on {{national}} holidays.

5|$|The Sermons, a {{political}} treatise composed {{in the guise}} of sermons, went almost unnoticed by contemporaries. In the Sermons, Skarga discusses what he sees as the problems of the ailing Commonwealth: lack <b>of</b> <b>patriotism,</b> internal quarrels, tolerance of heretics, the king's relative powerlessness, perverse laws (a critique of the nobility's Golden Freedoms), and immorality. Another notable aspect of the book is its focus on the desperate plight of the serfs (the peasants).|$|E
5|$|The Turks agreed, but Prime Minister Deligiannis refused and {{dispatched}} 1400 {{troops to}} Crete {{under the command}} of Colonel Timoleon Vassos.

The announcement that Greece was finally at war with the Turks was greeted by delirious displays <b>of</b> <b>patriotism</b> and spontaneous parades in honor of the King in Athens.

5|$|This {{restriction}} {{and kind}} of state monopoly {{on the use of}} national symbols during the Communist regime made flying the Polish flag a symbol of resistance against the government.

5|$|Following Romania's {{transition}} to a Socialist Republic, the monarchy was excoriated by communist officials. Several biographies {{of the royal family}} described Marie either as a drunkard or as a promiscuous woman, referring to her many alleged affairs and to orgies she had supposedly organised before and during the war. In the years preceding the Romanian Revolution of 1989, Marie's popularity recovered and she was offered as a model <b>of</b> <b>patriotism</b> to the population. Marie is primarily remembered for her work as a nurse, but is also known for her extensive writing, including her critically acclaimed autobiography.|$|E
5|$|Public {{opposition}} to the German occupiers was heavily repressed. Displays <b>of</b> <b>patriotism,</b> such as singing the national anthem, La Brabançonne, or celebrating Belgian National Day were banned and those breaking the rules risked strict prison sentences. Newspapers, books and mail were all tightly censored and regulated. Numerous high-profile Belgian figures, including Adolphe Max, the mayor of Brussels, and the historian Henri Pirenne, were imprisoned in Germany as hostages. The aftermath of the Battle of Verdun in 1916 marked {{a turning point in}} the occupation and was followed by more repressive measures by the administration, including the deportation of workers to Germany.|$|E
5|$|The public's {{thirst for}} news and {{information}} was in part satisfied by news magazines, which were dedicated to reporting the war. They included amongst others The War Illustrated, The Illustrated War News, and The War Pictorial, and were lavishly filled with photographs and illustrations, regardless of their target audience. Magazines were produced for all classes, and ranged both in price and tone. Many otherwise famous writers contributed towards these publications, of which H.G. Wells, Arthur Conan Doyle and Rudyard Kipling were three examples. Editorial guidelines varied; in cheaper publications especially it was considered more important {{to create a sense}} <b>of</b> <b>patriotism</b> than to relay up-to-the-minutes news of developments of the front. Stories of German atrocities were commonplace.|$|E

5|$|World War I {{had a large}} {{impact on}} the school. A newfound sense <b>of</b> <b>patriotism</b> had the {{administration}} require students to recite the Pledge of Allegiance as an entrance requirement to the school. The war also {{had an effect on}} enrollment as all of the male students gradually left the school to join the war efforts; in 1916 there were 421 total students, 382 in 1917, 172 in 1918 (including only one male student), and in 1919, 147 students. In addition to the students, some of the faculty members joined the military. Due to the decreased student enrollment, the remaining faculty had the opportunity to further their own training. On campus, both students and faculty worked with the Red Cross, organized bond drives, and sent packages to troops overseas.|$|E

5|$|His legend {{had begun}} growing even during his lifetime, as {{he became a}} hero of poems and songs. Few {{negative}} rumors about him, popular {{in the last few}} years of his life, survived after his death. During the period of Enlightenment in Poland he was written about by poets and writers such as Stanisław Potocki, Franciszek Karpiński, Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz and Franciszek Ksawery Dmowski. A biography by Michał Krajewski cemented his legend of a hero rescuing Poland from anarchy and invasion. That legend that became even stronger during the times of the partitions of Poland in the 19th century, where the artists of the Polish romanticism period used him as a symbol <b>of</b> <b>patriotism,</b> and a reminder of military successes. He appears in the poem Przedświt of Zygmunt Krasiński, but much more significant was his portrayal in The Trilogy of Henryk Sienkiewicz, particularly the second book, The Deluge.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} the Indiana World War Memorial Plaza lay in a 1919 attempt {{by the city of}} Indianapolis to lure the newly formed American Legion from its {{temporary}} headquarters in New York City. The American Legion, chartered by Congress in 1919 after World War I, is an organization of veterans that sponsors youth programs, promotes patriotism and national security, and provides commitment to Americans who have served in the armed forces. Three Indianapolis veterans wanted to attract the Legion to the city, which already had the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument. At an American Legion national convention in Minneapolis during November 1919, cities sent representatives to lobby to become the new headquarters. Indianapolis drew support because of its central location within the United States and the city's shows <b>of</b> <b>patriotism.</b> Although Washington, D.C. received the most votes on the first ballot, Indianapolis gained a majority and won the second with 361 votes out of 684 cast.|$|E
5|$|From 1916 {{through his}} John F. Kennedy {{memorial}} cover on December 16, 1963, Rockwell created 321 magazine covers for the Post, {{which was the}} most popular American magazine {{of the first half of}} the 20th century with a subscribership that reached a peak of 4 million. Rockwell illustrated American life during World War I and World War II in 34 of his cover illustrations, and he illustrated 33 Post covers in total during World War II. Some of the war art involved American life. During much of the first half of the 1940s, Rockwell's cover illustrations focused on the human side of the war. Rockwell encouraged support of the war efforts during World War II by means of his covers that endorsed war bonds, encouraged women to work, and encouraged men to enlist in the service. His World War II illustrations used themes <b>of</b> <b>patriotism,</b> longing, shifting gender roles, reunion, love, work, community and family during wartime to promote the war. In his role as a magazine illustrator during times of war, Rockwell draws comparisons to Winslow Homer, an American Civil War illustrator for Harper's Weekly. Rockwell's artistic expressions were said to have helped the adoption of the goal of the Four Freedoms as set forth by United States President Franklin Roosevelt's 1941 State of the Union Address. His painting series, the Four Freedoms, toured in a war bond effort that raised $132 million.|$|E
5|$|Lord Chancellor Gardiner and the House of Commons unsuccessfully petitioned her to {{consider}} marrying an Englishman, fearing that England would {{be relegated to}} a dependency of the Habsburgs. The marriage was unpopular with the English; Gardiner and his allies opposed it on the basis <b>of</b> <b>patriotism,</b> while Protestants were motivated by a fear of Catholicism. When Mary insisted on marrying Philip, insurrections broke out. Thomas Wyatt the younger led a force from Kent to depose Mary in favour of Elizabeth, {{as part of a}} wider conspiracy now known as Wyatt's rebellion, which also involved the Duke of Suffolk, the father of Lady Jane. Mary declared publicly that she would summon Parliament to discuss the marriage, and if Parliament decided that the marriage was not to the advantage of the kingdom, she would refrain from pursuing it. On reaching London, Wyatt was defeated and captured. Wyatt, the Duke of Suffolk, his daughter Lady Jane, and her husband Guildford Dudley were executed. Courtenay, who was implicated in the plot, was imprisoned, and then exiled. Elizabeth, though protesting her innocence in the Wyatt affair, was imprisoned in the Tower of London for two months, then was put under house arrest at Woodstock Palace.|$|E
