Later that year, almost all Zbor publications, including Otadžbina, Buđenje, Zbor, Naš put (<b>Our</b> <b>Path)</b> and Vihor (Whirlwind), were prohibited. Ljotić exploited the connections {{he had with}} Nedić {{to ensure that the}} banned Zbor-published journal Bilten (Bulletin) was distributed to members of the Royal Yugoslav Army. The journal was published illegally in a military printing house and distributed throughout the country by military couriers. Ljotić was the journal's main contributor and editor-in-chief. Fifty-eight issues of Bilten were published from March 1939 until October 1940, in which Ljotić advocated a pro-Axis Yugoslav foreign policy and criticized Belgrade's tolerance of Jews. As many as 20,000 copies each were printed of later issues of the journal. Ljotić was particularly pleased with being able to exert his ideological influence over young military academy trainees as well as older officers.|$|E

40|$|Single node {{failures}} represent {{more than}} 85 % of all node {{failures in the}} today’s large communication networks such as the Internet [10]. Also, these node failures are usually transient. Consequently, having the routing paths globally recomputed does not pay off since the failed nodes recover fairly quickly, and the recomputed routing paths need to be discarded. Instead, we develop algorithms and protocols for dealing with such transient single node failures by suppressing the failure (instead of advertising it across the network), and route messages to the destination via alternate paths that do not use the failed node. This philosophy was also adopted in Ref. [14] where the authors address the same issues. We develop algorithms which are faster than those given in Ref. [14] by an order of magnitude, while <b>our</b> <b>paths</b> are equally good. We show via simulation results that <b>our</b> <b>paths</b> are usually within 9 - 12 % of the optimal for randomly generated graph with 100 - 1000 nodes...|$|R
