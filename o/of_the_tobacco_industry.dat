5|$|Though {{inhabited}} {{prior to}} the 16th century, {{little is known about}} Barbadian music before the arrival of the Portuguese in 1536 and then the English in 1627. The Portuguese left little influence, but English culture and music helped shape the island's heritage. Irish and Scottish settlers emigrated in the 17th century, working in the tobacco industry, bringing still more new music to the island. The middle of the 17th century saw the decline <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tobacco</b> <b>industry</b> and the rise of sugarcane, as well as the introduction of large numbers of African slaves. Brazilian exiles however, along with sugarcane introduced Samba to the island which featured a mixture of Latin music with African influences which soon developed into Soca-Samba which is indigenous to Barbados. Modern Barbadian music is thus largely a combination of English and African elements, with Irish, Scottish, and modern American and Caribbean (especially Jamaican) influences as well.|$|E

40|$|While {{there has}} been a redoubling of efforts to reduce smoking rates among Indigenous Australians, Indigenous health {{researchers}} have paid almost no attention to <b>the</b> <b>tobacco</b> <b>industry</b> — <b>the</b> “vector” <b>of</b> smoking-related diseases. <b>The</b> exceptions are two reports <b>of</b> <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> Aboriginal images to advertise Winfield cigarettes in Europe. 1, 2 We decided to examine industry documents to look for <b>the</b> inside story <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tobacco</b> <b>industry’s</b> approach to <b>the</b> Indigenous Australian market...|$|R

25|$|Though the {{relationship}} between smoking and schizophrenia is well established, a factor {{to be considered in}} this relationship is the role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tobacco</b> <b>industry.</b> Research based on internal industry documents shows a concerted effort by the industry to promote belief that people with schizophrenia need to smoke and that it is dangerous for them to quit. Such promotion includes monitoring or supporting research that endorsed the idea that people with schizophrenia are uniquely immune to the health consequences of smoking (since proved false) and that tobacco is needed for people with schizophrenia to self-medicate. The industry also provided cigarettes to hospital wards and supported efforts to block hospital-based smoking bans. Although this does not discredit the effects of nicotine in schizophrenia, it is argued that the efforts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tobacco</b> <b>industry</b> slowed the decline in smoking prevalence in people with schizophrenia as well as the development of clinical policies to promote smoking cessation.|$|E
25|$|During the 1990s, the Institute {{worked with}} tobacco company Philip Morris to {{question}} the links between smoking, secondhand smoke and health risks. Philip Morris commissioned Heartland to write and distribute reports. Heartland published a policy study which summarized a jointly prepared report by the Association of Private Enterprise Education and Philip Morris.

According to the UK newspaper The Independent, Eysenck received more than £800k in this way. Eysenck conducted many empirical investigations elucidating the role of personality in cigarette smoking and disease.|$|E

25|$|The Tobacco Institute {{was founded}} in 1958 as a trade {{association}} by cigarette manufacturers, who funded it proportionally to each company's sales. It was initially to supplement the work <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tobacco</b> <b>Industry</b> Research Committee (TIRC), which later became the Council for Tobacco Research. The TIRC work had been limited to attacking scientific studies that put tobacco in a bad light, and the Tobacco Institute had a broader mission to put out good news about tobacco, especially economic news. It also attacked scientific studies, although more by casting doubt on them rather than by rebutting them directly. It also lobbied Congress, although initially at a low level. Robert Hockett (first scientific director of Sugar Research Foundation, a sugar-equivalent of TIRC) became TIRCs associate scientific director.|$|E

In the 1999 film The Insider, Lowell Bergman, a television producer for the CBS news magazine 60 Minutes, played by Al Pacino, is confronted by Mike Wallace, played by Christopher Plummer, after an exposé <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tobacco</b> <b>industry</b> is edited down to suit CBS management and then, itself, gets exposed in the press for the self-censorship. Wallace passes Bergman an editorial printed in The New York Times, which accuses CBS of betraying the legacy of Edward R. Murrow. Good Night, and Good Luck is a 2005 Oscar-nominated film directed, co-starring and co-written by George Clooney about the conflict between Murrow and Joseph McCarthy on See It Now. Murrow is portrayed by actor David Strathairn, who received an Oscar nomination. In the film, Murrow's conflict with CBS boss William Paley occurs immediately after his skirmish with McCarthy.|$|E
40|$|Although {{previous}} research provides examples <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tobacco</b> <b>industry's</b> internal coded, acronyms and abbreviations, no studies {{to date have}} undertaken a systematic review of this secretive internal jargon. In this study, we review <b>tobacco</b> <b>industry</b> documents to identify industry lists of codes and their definitions, types of codes, and patterns used for coding as well as specific codes related to product research. These findings are organized to assist other researchers in finding and decoding documents relevant to their own particular topics of interest. Likewise, we encourage documentresearchers to consider <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> code patterns, particularly those that are unique specific manufacturers, departments, project areas or types of research. We conclude that effective document research requires <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> coherent strategies to identify and decifer the coded and terminology used internally and that sharing this information will facilitate and expedite future research...|$|R

40|$|Japan {{presents}} an excellent case-study {{of a nation}} with low female smoking rates and a negligible menthol market which changed after the cigarette market was opened to foreign competition. Internal <b>tobacco</b> <b>industry</b> documents demonstrate <b>the</b> intent <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> manufacturers to increase initiation among young females through development and marketing of menthol brands. Japanese menthol market share rose rapidly from less than 1 % in 1980 to 20 % in 2008. Menthol brand use was dominated by younger and female smokers, in contrast with non-menthol brands which were used primarily by male smokers. Nationally representative surveys confirm industry surveys of brand use and provide further evidence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> end results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tobacco</b> <b>industry’s</b> actions—increased female smoking in Japan. These findings suggest that female populations may be encouraged to initiate into smoking, particularly in developing nations or where female smoking rates remain low, if <b>the</b> <b>tobacco</b> <b>industry</b> can successfully tailor brands to them. The Japanese experience provides a warning to public health officials who wish to prevent smoking initiation among young females...|$|R

40|$|Based on an {{examination}} of primarily <b>tobacco</b> <b>industry</b> internal documents, news sources and government data sources we conclude that <b>the</b> <b>tobacco</b> <b>industry</b> in Wisconsin has played a dominant role in shaping public policy on <b>tobacco</b> through <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> its {{economic and political power}} and strategic alliances with influential <b>industries.</b> <b>Tobacco</b> <b>industry</b> policies have contributed to higher than average rates of smoking among young people in the early nineties, higher rates of smoking among young adults than the national average and higher than expected smoking rates among adults in Wisconsin given its socioeconomic characteristics.

40|$|Objective: To analyse news {{portrayals of}} lung cancer and {{associated}} inferences about responsibility in Australian television news. Methods: Analysis of television news reports, broadcast on Sydney's five free-to-air television channels between 2 May 2005 and 31 August 2009, for all statements pertaining to lung cancer. Results: Of 2, 042 reports mentioning any cancer, 45 made reference to lung cancer, and 28 (62 %) referred to diagnoses {{of lung cancer}} in non-smokers. Of 157 statements in these reports, 107 (68 %) noted that the person featured was a non-smoker. Nonsmokers were portrayed sympathetically and as tragic victims, implying they were not responsible for their condition, the subtext being that smokers are responsible for theirs. Conclusions: Television news portrays non-smokers with lung cancer with considerable sympathy. Conversely, smokers are implicitly and occasionally explicitly depicted as responsible for their disease. Implications: <b>The</b> marginalisation <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> caused lung cancer in news, together with sympathetic reporting of lung cancer in non-smokers may contribute to stigma surrounding smoking caused disease that may promote delay in seeking treatment, and de-emphasise <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tobacco</b> <b>industry's</b> decadeslong smoker reassurance program in promoting smoking. 5 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Background: Targeting of marginalized {{groups with}} {{aggressive}} tobacco marketing {{has been identified}} as exacerbating health disparities. However, interpretation of such targeting by groups varies, from surprise and outrage to regarding such marketing as evidence of social legitimacy. We sought to learn how an often-overlooked marginalized group, older adults, would respond to industry documents offering evidence of tobacco company target marketing. Methods. We conducted 10 focus groups in California cities with older (≥ 50 years) smokers and former smokers. A set of previously-undisclosed <b>tobacco</b> <b>industry</b> documents related to target marketing was shown to the group in sequence. Audiotaped discussions were transcribed and data analyzed using qualitative approaches. Results: Responses to evidence of <b>tobacco</b> <b>industry</b> targeting varied, with some regarding it as exploitive and others as normal business practice. However, in most groups, discussions turned to government's failure to protect the public - even though government action /inaction was not prompted nor addressed in the discussion documents. Conclusion: Given the Food and Drug Administration's new authority to regulate tobacco products, these findings suggest that some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tobacco</b> <b>industry's</b> "best customers" (older, established smokers and ex-smokers) may be strong supporters of government regulation of tobacco. © 2013 Yerger et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|R
