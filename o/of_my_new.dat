25|$|On the 1stofMay {{the city}} of New York has the {{appearance}} of sending off a population flying from the plague, or of a town which had surrendered on condition of carrying away all their goods and chattels. Rich furniture and ragged furniture, carts, wagons, and drays, ropes, canvas, and straw, packers, porters, and draymen, white, yellow, and black, occupy the streets from east to west, from north to south, on this day. Every one I spoke to on the subject complained of this custom as most annoying, but all assured me it was unavoidable, if you inhabit a rented house. More than one <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>New</b> York friends have built or bought houses solely to avoid this annual inconvenience.|$|E
500|$|Hello, all you Cyberheads! Welcome to the 90's {{version of}} intimacy. You can hear me... You can even see me... But you can't touch me... do you {{recognize}} my voice?... It's Madonna. Often imitated, but never duplicated. Or, should I say, often irritated? If you feel like it, you can download the sound file <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>new</b> single [...] "Secret", from my new album, Bedtime Stories, which comes out next month. I just shot the video in New York, and will be premiering an exclusive sample of it online. So check back soon. In the meantime, why don't you post me a message {{and let me know}} what you think <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>new</b> song. And by the way, don't believe any of those online imposters pretending to be me... ain't nothing like the real thing. Peace out.|$|E
500|$|B in the Mix: The Remixes {{received}} little promotion compared to Spears' standards. A promotional extended play (EP) titled Key Cuts from Remixed with several remixes from {{the album was}} released in September 2005. A contest was launched on Spears' paid fan site for those who pre-ordered the album. The winner received a copy of , a bottle of Spears' fragrance Fantasy with an additional lotion and make-up kit, and a personalized autographed picture of Spears. On November 22, 2005, the day the album was released, a release party was held at an unspecified nightclub in Los Angeles, California, organized by Spears' management and the webmaster of the fansite WorldOfBritney.com. It was a limited event to five hundred people, including members of the fansite or her official fan club. Spears commented: [...] "I {{just wanted to say}} that I love the idea of all my fans getting together to celebrate the release <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>new</b> album. I was happy to help! I hope you have a great night out at the club and dance all night long!".|$|E

500|$|Throughout the book's seventeen-year gestation, Joyce {{stated that}} with Finnegans Wake he was {{attempting}} to [...] "reconstruct the nocturnal life", and that the book was his [...] "experiment in interpreting 'the dark night of the soul'." [...] According to Ellmann, Joyce stated to Edmond Jaloux that Finnegans Wake would be written [...] "to suit the esthetic of the dream, where the forms prolong and multiply themselves", and once informed a friend that [...] "he conceived of his book as the dream of old Finn, lying in death beside the river Liffey and watching the history of Ireland and the world – past and future – flow through his mind like flotsam on the river of life." [...] While pondering the generally negative reactions to the book Joyce said: I can't understand some of my critics, like Pound or Miss Weaver, for instance. They say it's obscure. They compare it, of course, with Ulysses. But the action of Ulysses was chiefly during the daytime, and the action <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>new</b> work takes place chiefly at night. It's natural things should not be so clear at night, isn't it now? ...|$|E
500|$|... "Hold It Against Me" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Max Martin, Dr. Luke and Billboard, with additional writing by Bonnie McKee. After it was written, Luke and Martin {{wanted to give}} the track to American recording artist Katy Perry, but they decided that [...] "it definitely wasn't a Katy Perry record." [...] They continued to work on the song with Billboard; Luke commented, [...] "I wanted to make sure it didn't sound like everything else I've done. [...] It can be hard in the verse, and the bridge is super, super hard, but the chorus is super-pop." [...] After rumored lyrics for the song surfaced on the web, Luke commented in his Twitter account on December 9, 2010, [...] "I / we never wrote a song called 'don't hold it against me'.... BewaRe of InaccuraTe info kids-) We did write 'hold it against me' but those lyrics are NOT the lyrics ...." [...] It was reported by news outlets that [...] "Hold It Against Me" [...] would premiere on January 7, 2011. However, this was denied by Spears' manager Adam Leber. An early demo of the track performed by McKee was leaked on January 6, 2011. Spears released the cover art for the song that same day and commented via Twitter, [...] "Heard an early demo <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>new</b> single leaked. If u think that's good, wait til you hear the real one Tuesday." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{final stages}} of {{composition}} overlapped with {{the early stages of}} publication. In June 1851, Melville wrote to Hawthorne that he was in New York to [...] "work and slave on my 'Whale' while it is driving through the press". By the end of the month, [...] "wearied with the long delay of printers", Melville came back to finish work on the book in Pittsfield. Three weeks later, the typesetting was almost done, as he announced to Bentley on 20 July: [...] "I am now passing thro' the press, the closing sheets <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>new</b> work". While Melville was simultaneously writing and proofreading what had been set, the corrected proof would be plated, that is, the type fixed in final form. Since earlier chapters were already plated when he was revising the later ones, Melville must have [...] "felt restricted in the kinds of revisions that were feasible".|$|E

2500|$|Gomez {{wanted the}} video {{to use the}} initial, stripped-down version of the song. The video uses this version, which reworks the {{original}} song, omitting Rocky's verse, and introducing string instrumentation and a toning-down of the original's sound effects. The stripped down version of the song is slower in tempo than the single version, and without Rocky's verse is thirty seconds shorter. Rocky is also absent from the music video. Emilee Lindner of MTV News described the {{new version of the}} track as [...] "slightly morose". Gomez created anticipation for the music video's release by posting several teasers on Instagram. On June 10, 2015, she shared a photograph of herself in a shower, captioned [...] "Ready..#itscomingsoon". Billboard said that image was a teaser for a music video, writing, [...] "the intense lighting suggests this wasn't a candid selfie". Gomez posted a blurred image of a television screen on June 12, asking, [...] "Now who would like the first look <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>new</b> music video?" [...] On June 18, she posted another image from the clip, and on June 22, shared a thirty-three-second preview. The full music video premiered on screens in Times Square on June 26, and was made available for digital download on the iTunes Store the following day.|$|E
