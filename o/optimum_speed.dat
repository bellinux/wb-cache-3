5|$|Turbo-electric {{propulsion}} {{was selected}} for the battlecruisers despite the fact it needed more room than geared turbines to allow for better underwater protection that wartime experience showed was essential. First used in the s, it also had several other advantages. The turbines could run at their <b>optimum</b> <b>speed,</b> without regard to propeller speed, which was economical on fuel and the machinery could be easily sub-divided which increased the ships' ability to withstand torpedo hits. The substitution of flexible electric cables for bulky steam-lines meant that the motors could be mounted further {{to the rear of}} the ship, which reduced both vibration and weight by shortening the propeller shafts. Also, the ship could go astern at full power simply by reversing the electrical polarity of the motors. Despite these factors and the fact that American companies would have struggled to produce the very large geared steam turbines needed for such big ships, the Curtis Company tried unsuccessfully to convince the Navy to reverse this decision. The Navy countered that doing so would mean a complete rearrangement of machinery spaces and a reduction in underwater protection.|$|E

500|$|Turbo-electric transmission, {{which had}} been used in the prior class, was {{retained}} here. Advantages included the ability for the turbines to run at <b>optimum</b> <b>speed</b> without regard to propeller speed, which led to greater fuel economy and range, and an easier sub-division of machinery, which increased the ships' ability to withstand torpedo hits. Each of the four propeller shafts was powered by a 5,424 kilowatt electric motor, fed by two two-phase turbo generators (General Electric for Maryland, Westinghouse for Colorado and West Virginia) rated at 5,000 volts). Eight oil-fired Babcock & Wilcox water-tube boilers, each in its individual compartment, provided steam for the generators. Altogether, the ships' power plant was rated at 28,900 electrical horsepower (EHP) to provide a flank speed of [...] With a maximum bunker capacity of 4570 tons, the Colorados range without refueling at sea was [...]|$|E
50|$|As {{bypass ratio}} increases, the mean radius {{ratio of the}} fan and {{low-pressure}} turbine (LPT) increases. Consequently, if the fan is to rotate at its <b>optimum</b> blade <b>speed</b> the LPT blading will spin slowly, so additional LPT stages will be required, to extract sufficient energy to drive the fan. Introducing a (planetary) reduction gearbox, with a suitable gear ratio, between the LP shaft and the fan enables both the fan and LP turbine to operate at their <b>optimum</b> <b>speeds.</b> Typical of this configuration are the long-established Honeywell TFE731, the Honeywell ALF 502/507, and the recent Pratt & Whitney PW1000G.|$|R

500|$|Off-site, the new {{brake wheel}} and fantail were made. The {{original}} brake wheel was too rotten to repair, and showed {{evidence that it}} had been altered from the original one installed in 1819. The original brake wheel was [...] diameter to allow the Common sails to run at their <b>optimum</b> <b>speed.</b> When the mill was modernised in 1832 it was necessary to alter the gear ratios within the mill, as Patent sails run at a slower speed than Common sails. The great spur wheel was increased in diameter and the stone nuts reduced in diameter. The brake wheel was also rebuilt, with a cast iron segment ring fitted in place of the original cogs, resulting in a wheel [...] in diameter. The opinion of professional millwrights was sought, and it was decided that a scaled-up version of the original brake wheel would be made, but retaining the cast iron teeth segments. The remains of the original brake wheel were retained as an exhibit in the mill. The original iron segments were all broken, so a pattern was made and new segments were cast in heat-treated malleable cast iron. When the brake wheel was completed it was dismantled and transported to the mill ready for reassembly.|$|E
500|$|Rossbach also {{highlighted}} the extraordinary talents {{of two of}} Frederick's officers, the artillery colonel Karl Friedrich von Moller and his cavalry general, Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz. Both men possessed the much coveted coup d'œil militaire, {{the ability to see}} at a glance what must be done to tactical advantage. This attribute allowed them to use the artillery and cavalry to full potential., Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften , Band 22 (1885), S. 127–128. Frederick himself called this [...] "he perfection of that art to learn at one just and determined view the benefits and disadvantages of a country where posts are to be placed and how to act upon the annoyance of the enemy. This is, in a word, the true meaning of a coup d'œil, without which an officer may commit errors of the greatest consequence.", T. Egerton, Military Library, 1824. On the morning of the battle Frederick had passed over two senior generals and placed Seydlitz in command of the whole of his cavalry, much to those men's annoyance and to Seydlitz' satisfaction. Seydlitz had spent the interim of the peace (1748–1756) training the cavalry to perform at <b>optimum</b> <b>speed</b> and force. The other outstanding officer, Colonel Moller, had invested the interim in developing a highly mobile artillery force. [...] His artillery engineers were trained similarly to hussars, to ride to a battle and fight dismounted; {{in the case of the}} artillery, they dragged their guns around the battlefield as needed. This was not yet the flying artillery that Frederick developed later, but it was similar in structure and function. Later developments refined the training and usage.|$|E

30|$|Another {{interesting}} {{result that}} could be concluded from Fig.  6 is that in low rotational speed (lower than the <b>optimum</b> rotational <b>speed</b> or 1570  rpm), impact strength (and also tensile strength in Fig.  4) will decrease with increasing traverse speed. But at high rotational speed (higher than 1570  rpm), this behavior could not be seen. In other words, at higher rotational speeds, traverse speed of 42  mm/min could be chosen as <b>optimum</b> traverse <b>speed</b> in which the mechanical properties of welded sheets could be maximized.|$|R
30|$|One {{interesting}} {{result that}} is obtained from Fig.  6 {{is the fact}} that as the traverse <b>speed</b> increases, the <b>optimum</b> rotational <b>speed</b> is almost constant. In other words, regardless of traverse <b>speed,</b> an <b>optimum</b> rotational <b>speed</b> (i.e., 1570  rpm) can be used for welding polyamide sheets. Nevertheless, if the traverse speed increases, the impact strength of welded samples decreases. This could be because with high traverse speed, the melted material will pour out of the welding area. Additionally, in a high travel speed, high value of temperature could not be created. Therefore, poor mixing of the melted material will happen, and consequently a poor quality weld is obtained.|$|R

Jockeys must be in superb muscular condition and possess outstanding balance; they cannot achieve the finesse of leg aids needed in other equestrian sports, and must rely primarily {{on the use of}} their seat and a crop for speed, and on their arm strength for directional control or slowing down. Their relative lack of control is clearly demonstrated by the use of [...] "pony" [...] horses to lead the race horse and jockey to the track, the use of assistants at the starting gate to load the horses, and the availability of outriders (all with much longer stirrups) to assist the jockey {{at the end of a}} race or in the event of an accident. If the horse does anything but run in essentially a straight line with long gradual curves, or if anything goes seriously wrong, jockeys can easily be thrown, as their high rate of injury so amply illustrates.|$|E
2500|$|Crowhurst {{left from}} Teignmouth, Devon, {{on the last}} day {{permitted}} by the rules: 31 October 1968. [...] He encountered immediate problems with his boat, his equipment, and his lack of open-ocean sailing skills and experience. In the first few weeks he was making less than half of his planned speed. [...] He did not have the skill to sail the complex tri-hulled boat at anything near its <b>optimum</b> <b>speed</b> while navigating a good course. [...] According to his logs, he gave himself only 50/50 odds of surviving the trip, assuming {{that he was able to}} complete some of the boat's safety features before reaching the dangerous Southern Ocean. [...] Crowhurst was thus faced with the choice of either quitting the race and facing financial ruin and humiliation or continuing to an almost certain death in his unseaworthy, disappointing boat. [...] Over the course of November and December 1968, the hopelessness of his situation pushed him into an elaborate deception. [...] He shut down his radio with a plan to loiter in the South Atlantic for several months while the other boats sailed the Southern Ocean, falsify his navigation logs, then slip back in for the return leg to England. As last-place finisher, he assumed his false logs would not receive the same scrutiny as those of the winner.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Empirical {{observations}} indicate striking similarities among locomotion in terrestrial animals, birds, and fish, but unifying physical grounds are lacking.

40|$|The {{responses}} of neurons {{in the middle}} temporal and medial superior temporal areas of macaque cortex are suppressed during saccades compared with saccade-like stimulus movements.
