5|$|In {{light of}} Ívarr's {{possible}} collusion with Haraldr Guðrøðarson, {{the slaying of}} Rǫgnvaldr Óláfsson may be evidence that the continuing strife between the rival branches descended from the half-brothers, Rǫgnvaldr Guðrøðarson and Óláfr, continued well into the mid thirteenth century. In fact, the killing is the last recorded example of regicide in the Norse-Gaelic realm, and may partly evidence the Europeanisation of the peripheral regions of the British Isles during the twelfth- and thirteenth centuries. As it turned out, the reign of Rǫgnvaldr Óláfsson's successor was short-lived, since Haraldr Guðrøðarson was recalled to Norway in 1250, for having unjustly seized the kingship. Once in Norway, the latter was detained from returning to the Isles, and is not heard of again. Within two years, Rǫgnvaldr Óláfsson's brother, Magnús, was installed in the kingship. The latter reigned {{until his death in}} 1265, and was the last member of the Crovan dynasty to rule as king in the Isles. An after-effect of the inter-dynastic warring within the Crovan dynasty was the partitioning of the kingdom between rival factions. For example, from about 1187 to 1226, and for a brief period in 1229, the kingdom was divided between the half-brothers; and for a brief period in 1230/1231 it was divided between Óláfr and his nephew, Guðrøðr Rögnvaldsson. Although Haraldr Óláfsson appears to have reigned over a united kingdom, the years between his death and the installation of Magnús in 1252 is a murky period indeed, and {{it is possible that the}} kingdom was divided between rival factions during this brief span of years. Rǫgnvaldr Óláfsson was evidently survived by a daughter, Maria. In 1305, a grandson <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> pursued a claim to Mann.|$|E

25|$|Fergus of Galloway (died 12 May 1161) was a twelfth-century Lord of Galloway. Although his {{familial}} origins are unknown, it {{is possible}} that he was of Norse-Gaelic ancestry. Fergus first appears on record in 1136, when he witnessed a charter of David I, King of Scotland. There is considerable evidence indicating that Fergus was married to a bastard daughter of Henry I, King of England. Although the identity <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> is unknown, {{it is possible}} that she was the mother of Fergus' three children.|$|E

Because <b>of</b> <b>this</b> system <b>women</b> are subject to more inequalities when living in rural/tribal areas. Customary law is the default except when it conflicts with the constitution. However, in practice, customary laws conflicting with the constitution generally go unchecked by the statutory system.

Later that same year, she received her third and final Academy Award nomination for Sudden Fear for RKO Radio Pictures. In 1953, she appeared in her final film for MGM, Torch Song. The movie received favorable reviews and moderate success at the box office.|$|E
500|$|Originally {{conceived}} as a television series, Mulholland Drive began as a 90-minute pilot produced for Touchstone Television and intended for the ABC television network. David Lynch sold the idea to ABC executives based only {{on the story of}} Rita emerging from the car accident with her purse containing $125,000 in cash and the blue key, and Betty trying to help her figure out who she is. An ABC executive recalled, [...] "I remember the creepiness <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> in this horrible, horrible crash, and David teasing us with the notion that people are chasing her. She's not just 'in' trouble—she is trouble. Obviously, we asked, 'What happens next?' And David said, 'You have to buy the pitch for me to tell you.|$|E

Fellow inmate and prison van driver Lorna Morello (Yael Stone) feels sorry for her and exits the van urging Miss Rosa to escape. The final scene {{features}} Miss Rosa driving away when she notices Vee also making an escape from prison. Recalling an earlier altercation with Vee, Miss Rosa careens the vehicle at Vee killing her instantly. Rosenblat told Silman that she joyfully screamed in the bathroom for five minutes when she learned of her character's actions. She added [...] "After all this effort to get rid <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman,</b> just evil incarnate, you know, and then I stroll along in my van. [...] 'So rude, that one.' Amazing. That final scene was really great." [...] During the scene Miss Rosa morphs into her younger incarnation as she becomes free once again. Rosenblat recalled the logistics of filming having to swap backwards and forth with Andujar to create the same position behind the wheel.|$|E

500|$|Beckinsale rose to fame in 2001 with {{a leading}} role in the war film Pearl Harbor as a nurse torn between two pilots, played by Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett. She was drawn to the project by the script: [...] "It's so unusual these days to read a script that has those old-fashioned values to it. Not morals, but movie values. It's a big, {{sweeping}} epic....You just never get the chance to do that." [...] Director Michael Bay initially had doubts about casting the actress: [...] "I wasn't sure about her at first...she wore black leather trousers in her screen test and I thought she was a little nasty...it was easy to think <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> as a slut." [...] He eventually decided to hire her because she wasn't [...] "too beautiful. Women feel disturbed when they see someone’s too pretty." [...] He asked her to lose weight during filming. In a 2004 interview, the actress noted that his comments were [...] "upsetting" [...] and said she wore leather trousers because [...] "it was snowing out. It wasn't exactly like I had my nipple rings in." [...] She felt grateful that she had not had to deal with such criticism at a younger age: [...] "If I had come on to a movie set at [...] age and someone had said, 'You're a bit funny-looking, can you go on a diet?'—I might have jumped off a building. I just didn't have the confidence to put that into perspective at the time." [...] However, speaking in 2011, she said she was [...] "very fond" [...] of Bay. Pearl Harbor received negative reviews. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly praised [...] "the avid eyed, ruby lipped Kate Beckinsale, the rare actress whose intelligence gives her a sensual bloom; she's like Parker Posey without irony." [...] A.O.Scott of The New York Times noted that [...] "Mr.Affleck and Ms.Beckinsale do what they can with their lines, and glow with the satiny shine of real movie stars." [...] However, Mike Clark of USA Today felt that the [...] "usually appealing Kate Beckinsale" [...] is [...] "inexplicably submerged—like her hospital colleagues—under heaps of tarty makeup that even actresses of the era didn't wear." [...] The film was a commercial success, grossing $449 million worldwide.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1980s, Mark Frost {{worked for}} three years as {{a writer for the}} {{television}} police drama Hill Street Blues, which featured a large cast and extended story lines. Following his success with The Elephant Man (1980) and Blue Velvet in 1986, David Lynch was hired by a Warner Bros. executive to direct a film about the life of Marilyn Monroe, based on the best-selling book Goddess. Lynch recalls being [...] "sort of interested. I loved the idea <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> in trouble, but I didn't know if I liked it being a real story." [...] Lynch and Frost first worked together on the Goddess screenplay and although the project was dropped by Warner Bros., they became good friends. They went on to work as writer and director for One Saliva Bubble, a film with Steve Martin attached to star, but it was never made either. Lynch's agent, Tony Krantz, encouraged him to do a television show. He took Lynch to Nibblers restaurant in Los Angeles and said, [...] "You should do a show about real life in America—your vision of America the same way you demonstrated it in Blue Velvet." [...] Lynch got an [...] "idea of a small-town thing," [...] and though he and Frost were not keen on it, they decided to humor Krantz. Frost wanted to tell [...] "a sort of Dickensian story about multiple lives in a contained area that could sort of go perpetually." [...] Originally, the show was to be titled North Dakota and set in the Plains region of North Dakota.|$|E

How can you explain away that she always kept ending up in the elevator in her bra and underwear over and over again? Stephanie’s whole mission was to get Taylor to smell the coffee and [...] that not everybody has as altruistic an agenda as she does." [...] Ridge and Taylor's twins, Stephanie ("Steffy") and Phoebe, are born in 1999. During the pregnancy Taylor experiences tuberculosis after interacting {{with a man who}} has it. Her pregnancy becomes high risk and she refuses treatment to protect the babies. Tylo said that this was [...] "a great way to bring awareness about the disease and the threat it poses to pregnant women". When Taylor dies in 2002, supervising producer Rhonda Friedman noted that Ridge refuses to accept the [...] "horrible reality", saying: [...] "He begs Taylor to come back to him. He just doesn't want to let go <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> who he has loved for so many years, someone he say himself growing old with." [...] Devin Owens of Soap Opera Digest called Taylor Ridge's soulmate. Taylor's [...] "ghost" [...] visits Ridge in 2004 and encourages him to be with Brooke. Following Taylor's return to the show, her marriage to Ridge fell apart in 2006 and they divorce. They have since reunited on several occasions but he continues going back to Brooke, despite Taylor's efforts to thwart this from happening.

[...] Another person who said Blavatsky was a remarkable woman was a former associate {{and publisher of the}} Theosophical magazine [...] "Lucifer" [...] 1887–1889, Mabel Collins. After leaving the movement she said [...] "She taught me one great lesson. I learned from her how foolish, how 'gullible', how easily flattered human beings are, taken en masse. Her contempt for her kind was on the same gigantic scale as everything else about her, except her marvellously delicate taper fingers. In all else, she was a big woman. She had a greater power over the weak and credulous, a greater capacity for making black appear white, a larger waist, a more voracious appetite, a more confirmed passion for tobacco, a more ceaseless and insatiable hatred for those whom she thought to be her enemies, a greater disrespect for les convenances, a worse temper, a greater command of bad language, and a greater contempt for the intelligence of her fellow-beings than I had ever supposed possible to be contained in one person. These, I suppose, must be reckoned as her vices, though whether a creature so indifferent to all ordinary standards of right and wrong can be held to have virtues or vices, I know not." ...|$|E
