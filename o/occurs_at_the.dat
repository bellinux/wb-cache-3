The creek flows through rock formations {{such as the}} Llewellyn Formation and the Pocono Formation. conglomerate and limestone have been observed in the creek's vicinity. There are coal measures {{in the vicinity of}} the creek. There are pyroclastic materials in foundry slag and coal mining waste in the watershed. Large deposits of drift have been observed near the creek. Substantial till deposits are also present in its valley.|$|E
5|$|Acamprosate may {{stabilise}} {{the brain}} chemistry that is altered due to alcohol dependence via antagonising {{the actions of}} glutamate, a neurotransmitter which is hyperactive in the post-withdrawal phase. By reducing excessive NMDA activity which <b>occurs</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> onset of alcohol withdrawal, acamprosate can reduce or prevent alcohol withdrawal related neurotoxicity. Acamprosate {{reduces the risk of}} relapse amongst alcohol dependent persons.|$|E

5|$|Likewise, group theory helps {{predict the}} changes in {{physical}} properties that occur when a material undergoes a phase transition, for example, from a cubic to a tetrahedral crystalline form. An example is ferroelectric materials, where the change from a paraelectric to a ferroelectric state <b>occurs</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Curie temperature and is related to a change from the high-symmetry paraelectric state to the lower symmetry ferroelectric state, accompanied by a so-called soft phonon mode, a vibrational lattice mode that goes to zero frequency at the transition.|$|E
5|$|People with cranial CSF leaks, the rarer form, have a 10% risk of {{developing}} meningitis per year. If cranial leaks last more than seven days, the chances {{of developing}} meningitis are significantly higher. Spinal CSF leaks cannot result in meningitis due to the sterile conditions of the leak site. When a CSF leak <b>occurs</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> temporal bone surgery becomes {{necessary in order to}} prevent infection and repair the leak. Orthostatic hypotension is another complication that occurs due to autonomic dysfunction when blood pressure drops significantly. The autonomic dysfunction is caused by compression of the brainstem, which controls breathing and circulation.|$|E

5|$|Some {{have argued}} that the pyramids were laid out as a map of the three stars in the belt of Orion, {{although}} this theory has been criticized by reputable astronomers. The site was instead probably governed by a spectacular hierophany which <b>occurs</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> summer solstice, when the sun, viewed from the Sphinx terrace, forms - together with the two giant pyramids - the symbol Akhet, which was also the name of the Great Pyramid. Further, the south east corners of all the 3 pyramids align towards the temple of Heliopolis, as first discovered by the Egyptologist Mark Lehner.|$|E
5|$|The Manhattan Project was {{replaced}} by the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) on 1 January 1947. Fermi served on the AEC General Advisory Committee, an influential scientific committee chaired by Robert Oppenheimer. He also liked to spend a few weeks of each year at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, where he collaborated with Nicholas Metropolis, and with John von Neumann on Rayleigh–Taylor instability, the science of what <b>occurs</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> border between two fluids of different densities.|$|E

5|$|The alpine pika inhabits mountainous {{areas in}} western Mongolia {{bordering}} the Gobi Desert, eastern Kazakhstan, southern Russia (Tuva, Irkutsk, Altai, and Krasnoyarsk) and China (northern Xinjiang and Heilongjiang). It is found on mountain ranges {{such as the}} Altai, Khangai, and Sayan, and is also distributed from the east and south of Lake Baikal eastward to the Amur River drainage. An isolated alpine pika population <b>occurs</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> northwest Ningxia-Hexi Zoulang-Gansu border, on the Helan Mountains. O. a. cinereofusca is found in Heilongjiang and Russia, while O. a. nitida is found in northern Xinjiang, Russia, Mongolia, and Kazakhstan.|$|E
5|$|The {{collision}} <b>occurs</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> termination shock, {{which is}} roughly 80–100AU from the Sun upwind of {{the interstellar medium}} and roughly 200AU from the Sun downwind. Here the wind slows dramatically, condenses and becomes more turbulent, forming a great oval structure known as the heliosheath. This structure is thought to look and behave {{very much like a}} comet's tail, extending outward for a further 40AU on the upwind side but tailing many times that distance downwind; evidence from Cassini and Interstellar Boundary Explorer spacecraft has suggested that it is forced into a bubble shape by the constraining action of the interstellar magnetic field.|$|E
5|$|The volcano's {{observed}} {{history has}} mostly {{been one of}} effusive eruptions; however, this is a relatively recent occurrence. Prior {{to the arrival of}} the first Europeans on the island, Kīlauea was the site of regular explosive activity, evidenced then by tribal chants referencing the volcano's fickle nature, and today by geological records of an explosively active mode of past activity. Although explosive activity still <b>occurs</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> volcano, it is not as intense as it once was, and the volcano would become much more dangerous to the general public if it returned to its old phase of activity once more.|$|E

5|$|A {{dominant}} male black wildebeest {{will have}} a harem of females and will not allow other males to mate with them. The breeding season <b>occurs</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of the rainy season and lasts a few weeks between February and April. When one of his females comes into oestrus the male concentrates on her and mates with her several times. Sexual behaviour by the male at this time includes stretching low, ears down, sniffing of the female's vulva, performing ritual urination and touching his chin to the female's rump. At the same time, the female keeps her tail upwards (sometimes vertically) or swishes it {{across the face of}} the male. The pair usually separates after copulation, but the female occasionally follows her mate afterwards, touching his rump with her snout. During the breeding season, the male loses condition as he spends little time grazing. Males are known to mount other males.|$|E
5|$|A large {{percentage}} of the people killed by brain trauma do not die right away but rather days to weeks after the event; rather than improving after being hospitalized, some 40% of TBI patients deteriorate. Primary brain injury (the damage that <b>occurs</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> moment of trauma when tissues and blood vessels are stretched, compressed, and torn) is not adequate to explain this deterioration; rather, it is caused by secondary injury, a complex set of cellular processes and biochemical cascades that occur in the minutes to days following the trauma. These secondary processes can dramatically worsen the damage caused by primary injury and account for the greatest number of TBI deaths occurring in hospitals.|$|E
5|$|The jackal moults twice a year, {{in spring}} and in autumn. In Transcaucasia and Tajikistan, the spring moult begins {{at the end of}} winter. If the winter has been warm, the spring moult starts in the middle of February; if the winter has been cold, it begins in the middle of March. The spring moult lasts for 60–65 days; if the animal is sick, it loses only half of its winter fur. The spring moult commences with the head and limbs, extends to the flanks, chest, belly and rump, and ends at the tail. Fur on the underparts is absent. The autumn moult occurs from mid-September with the growth of winter fur; the {{shedding}} of the summer fur <b>occurs</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same time. The development of the autumn coat starts with the rump and tail and spreads to the back, flanks, belly, chest, limbs and head, with full winter fur being attained at the end of November.|$|E

5|$|The kulintang player’s {{ability to}} improvise within the {{parameters}} of a rhythmic mode is a must. As with gamelan orchestras, each kulintang mode {{has a kind of}} theme the kulintang player “dresses up” by variations of ornamentation, manipulating segments by inserting repetitions, extensions, insertions, suspensions, variations and transpositions. This <b>occurs</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> discretion of the kulintang player. Therefore, the kulintang player functions not only as the one carrying the melody, but also as the conductor of the entire ensemble. She determines the length of each rendition and could change the rhythm at any time, speeding up or slowing down, accord to her personal taste and the composition she plays.|$|E
5|$|The nesting season starts early, {{with some}} birds {{incubating}} eggs by early April. American crows build bulky stick nests, nearly always in trees but sometimes also in large bushes and, very rarely, on the ground. They will nest {{in a wide}} variety of trees, including large conifers, although oaks are most often used. Three to six eggs are laid and incubated for 18 days. The young are usually fledged by about 36 days after hatching. Predation primarily <b>occurs</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> nest site and eggs and nestlings are frequently eaten by snakes, raccoons, ravens and domestic cats. Adults are less frequently predated but face potential attack from great horned owls, red-tailed hawks, peregrine falcons and eagles. They may be attacked by predators such as coyotes or bobcats at carrion when incautious although this is even rarer.|$|E
