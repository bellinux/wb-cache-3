The filing of observations by third parties at the EPO is free of charge and, according to the current practice of the EPO, may be anonymous. The observations must state the grounds on which they are based. The grounds must be written in one of the official languages of the EPO, i.e. in English, French or German. The documentary evidences (i.e., the publications, etc.) can be in any language, but the EPO may request a translation from the person filing the <b>observations,</b> <b>if</b> <b>necessary.</b> The observations are communicated to the applicant for or proprietor of the patent, who may comment on them.|$|E
40|$|A {{methodology}} {{for developing a}} knowledge-based expert system for assessing the structural condition of existing reinforced concrete buildings is proposed in this paper. The procedure incorporates the results of field <b>observations</b> and, <b>if</b> <b>necessary,</b> strength computations of individual members and combines these using weighting factors to obtain the overall structural condition of the building. The lack of precision associated with verbal descriptions used in recording some field observations is expressed using fuzzy set notation. Elements of fuzzy set theory are also used in the reasoning process. A KBES incorporating this methodology and using expertise based primarily {{on the experience of}} a team of investigating engineers at Tongji University, China, is described. ...|$|R
50|$|Upon {{their arrival}} in France, the St. Maixent Replacement Barracks {{was the primary}} {{reception}} center for new aero squadrons assigned to the Air Service American Expeditionary Force. There, units were classified as pursuit, bombardment or as <b>observation</b> units. <b>If</b> <b>necessary,</b> units were {{assigned to one of}} several Air Instructional Centers (AIC) for additional combat and gunnery training provided by the French. Once prepared fully for combat, units were sent to the 1st Air Depot at Colombey-les-Belles Airdrome for equipping. Initially equipped with British or French aircraft, later in 1918 American-built Dayton-Wright DH-4 aircraft equipped with American Liberty Engines began to arrive in France. The units were then assigned to one of the combat groups of the First or Second Army Air Service and transfer to their initial combat Aerodrome for combat duty.|$|R
40|$|Mesoscale model MM 5 (Version 3. 5) {{with some}} {{modifications}} {{in the cloud}} microphysics scheme of Schultz (1995), {{has been used to}} simulate two hailstorm events over Gangetic Plain of West Bengal, India. While the first event occurred on 12 March 2003 and the hails covered four districts of the state of West Bengal, India, the second hailstorm event struck Srinikatan (22. 65 &deg; N, 87. 7 &deg; E) on 10 April 2006 at 11 : 32 UT and it lasted for 2 – 3 min. Both these events can be simulated, if the same modifications are introduced in the cloud microphysics scheme of Schultz. However, the original scheme of Schultz cannot simulate any hail. The results of simulation were compared with the necessary products of Doppler Weather Radar (DWR) located at Kolkata (22. 57 &deg; N, 88. 35 &deg; E). Model products like reflectivity, graupel and horizontal wind are compared with the corresponding products of DWR. The pattern of hail development bears good similarity between model output and <b>observation</b> from DWR, <b>if</b> <b>necessary</b> modifications are introduced in the model. The model output of 24 h accumulated rain from 03 : 00 UT to next day 03 : 00 UT has also been compared with the corresponding product of the satellite TRMM...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{observations}} of Type Ia SNe at redshifts 0 ~ 0. 1 micron dust grains {{with a mass}} density of Omega_dust ~ (few) * 10 ^{- 5 } in the intergalactic (IG) medium. The same dust that dims the SNe absorbs the cosmic UV/optical background radiation around ~ 1 micron, and re-emits it at far infrared (FIR) wavelengths. Here we compare the FIR emission from IG dust with {{observations of}} the cosmic microwave (CMB) and cosmic far infrared backgrounds (FIRB) by the DIRBE/FIRAS instruments. We find that the emission would not lead to measurable distortion to the CMB, but would represent a substantial fraction (> 50 %) of the measured value of the FIRB in the 300 - 1000 micron range. This contribution {{would be consistent with}} the present unresolved fraction of the observed FIRB in an open universe. However, we find that IG dust probably could not reconcile the standard Omega= 1 CDM model with the SN <b>observations,</b> even <b>if</b> the <b>necessary</b> quantity of dust existed. Future observations able to resolve the FIRB to a flux limit of ~ 0. 5 mJy, along with a more precise measure of the coarse-grained FIRB, will provide a definitive test of the IG dust hypothesis in all cosmologies...|$|R
