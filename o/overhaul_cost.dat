40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedWith {{the end of}} the Cold War, the winds of military downsizing are blowing all over the world. Downsizing means fewer personnel, less facilities and smaller military budget. Therefore, understanding the relationships among factors responsible for force operating costs is extremely important when facing downsizing budgetary decisions. This study analyzes the U. S. Navy main combatant vessels' Operating and support costs. It seeks to reveal basic relationships of O and S costs through accounting and structural methods. The accounting oriented analysis found the VAMOSC-SHIPS and Jane's combined database to be relatively accurate with the exception of nuclear submarines and nuclear aircraft carriers. The structural analysis found that the <b>overhaul</b> <b>cost</b> should be analyzed separately due to essential differences used to calculate overhaul costs and a 1985 policy revision to ship overhaul. O and S cost relationships between factors other than overhauls were strong.

40|$|MIng (Mechanical Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 Typical {{deep level}} mines use up to 27 ML water {{per day for}} mining operations. Multistage {{centrifugal}} pumps up to 2500 MW are used in an upward cascading manor to dewater the shaft. The dewatering systems at some mines are automated to enable surface control. Automation of the pumps is typically based on the best practice procedure known when implemented. Best practice procedures are used to ensure safe pumping operations. It was found that pump failures could still occur even with the best practice implemented. Unexpected failures of pumps are of major concern because they can result in the flooding of a mine. Flooding {{increases the risk of}} environmental damage and injury to the mining personnel. An additional concern is the maintenance cost of multistage centrifugal pumps. <b>Overhaul</b> <b>cost</b> of a seized multistage centrifugal pump is almost R 1 -million. The aim {{of this study was to}} improve established best practice procedures for pump automation. This could be achieved by investigating the general root cause of failures of automated pumps. Additional instrumentation and protection devices to prevent similar incidents were examined. Revised system control parameters were developed to ensure that the pumps operated within the design specifications. The improved best practices proved to prevent failures as a result of overheating and cavitation. Increasing the pump reliability and availability enabled surface control. The control of the automated dewatering system realised an electricity cost saving of R 6 -million. The automated system also made it possible to calculate the real-time pump efficiency within 5 %. Previous best practice procedure was found to be inadequate to prevent all possibilities of failure. Additional precaution measurements were added to prevent pump failure. Master...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{work completed}} at Cardinal River Coals in Canada {{to improve the}} existing oil analysis condition-monitoring program being undertaken for wheel motors. Oil analysis results from a fleet of 55 haul truck wheel motors were analyzed along with their respective failures and repairs over a nine-year period. Detailed data cleaning procedures were applied to prepare data for modeling. In addition, definitions of failure and suspension were clarified depending on equipment condition at replacement. Using the proportional-hazards model (PHM) approach, the key condition variables relating to failures were found from among the 19 elements monitored, plus sediment and viscosity. Those key variables were then incorporated into a decision model that provided an unambiguous and optimal recommendation on whether to continue operating a wheel motor or to remove it for overhaul {{on the basis of}} data obtained from an oil sample. Wheel motor failure implied extensive planetary gear or sun gear damage necessitating the replacement of one or more major internal components in a general overhaul. The decision model, when triggered by incoming data, provided both a recommendation based on an optimal decision policy as well as an estimate of the unit's remaining useful life (RUL). By optimizing the times of repair as a function both of age and condition data a 20 - 30 % potential savings in <b>overhaul</b> <b>costs</b> over existing practice was identified...|$|R
5000|$|Idle {{reduction}} is particularly significant for vehicles in heavy traffic and trucks at the estimated 5,000 truck {{stops in the}} US. Many hybrid electric vehicles employ idle reduction to achieve better fuel economy in traffic. America's fleet of around 500,000 long-haul trucks consumes over a billion gallons (3.8×109 l; 830 million imp gal) of diesel fuel per year. [...] The trucking industry has analyzed the impact of idling on engines, {{both in terms of}} maintenance and engine wear costs. Long-duration idling causes more oil and oil filter deterioration and increases the need for more oil and filter changes. Similarly, the longer the idling time, the sooner the engine itself will need to be rebuilt. The trucking industry estimates that long duration idling costs the truck owner $1.13 per day, based on the need for more frequent oil changes and sooner <b>overhaul</b> <b>costs.</b> Services such as AireDock, IdleAire and Shorepower provide power at truck stops to resting truckers who would otherwise need to continue idling during mandatory breaks. Because the United States Department of Transportation mandates that truckers rest for 10 hours after driving for 11 hours, truckers might park at truck stops for several hours. Often they idle their engines during this rest time to provide their sleeper compartments with air conditioning or heating or to run electrical appliances such as refrigerators or televisions.|$|R
