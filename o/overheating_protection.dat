40|$|AbstractHybrid {{photovoltaic-thermal}} (PVT) collectors co-generate {{solar electricity}} and heat in a single component with an optimum utilization of space. Spectrally selective but transparent low-emissivity (low-e) coatings are a proven method to reduce thermal losses. However, overheating and stagnation are critical issues for these collectors due to material degradation, thermal stress, and low electrical efficiency. This paper presents a PVT collector concept with variable film insulation as <b>overheating</b> <b>protection.</b> An inflatable glass-film cushion regulates thermal losses. Performance and stagnation tests were carried out with a prototype. During normal operation the collector achieves a high thermal efficiency. In periods of standstill, the deflated cushion has a high heat dissipation rate by deactivating the low-e coating. Stagnation temperatures are thus limited to 95 ̊C. To conclude, the PVT collector combines the advantages of glazed and unglazed PVT collectors which are a high thermal efficiency and low stagnation temperatures...|$|E

40|$|Highly {{promoted}} by the European Union Climate and Energy Package for 2020, solar collectors stand out as the most promising alternative to meet water heating demands. One of the most limiting problems in these systems involves the overheating of the working fluid, resulting in rapid fluid degradation, scaling and premature component failure. This paper presents the computational design of a zero-power-consumption system that combines thermoelectric-self-cooling technology and thermosyphon effect to dissipate the excess heat from a real solar-collector installation. Thermoelectric self-cooling is a novel thermoelectric application proven to enhance the heat dissipation of any hot spot without electricity consumption.
