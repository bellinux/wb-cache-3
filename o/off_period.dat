2500|$|When the 1946 {{collective}} bargaining agreement expired in 1949, the United Steelworkers demanded that U.S. Steel provide each worker a pension. The Taft-Hartley Act's provisions permitting an injunction against a strike in an industry critical to national security were invoked {{an hour after the}} United Steelworkers walked off the job on July 7. Cyrus S. Ching, director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, attempted to mediate a solution to the strike, but these talks broke down on July 11. President Truman proposed a 60-day cooling <b>off</b> <b>period,</b> but Fairless rejected it. Fairless proposed a fact-finding board (which had worked in the 1946 strike) and 60-day cooling <b>off</b> <b>period</b> on July 14, and President Truman accepted the plan the following day. As the fact-finding board conducted its hearings, in August Fairless publicly denounced what he called was [...] "dictatorial" [...] governmental regulation of wages and prices. On September 14, the fact-finding board issued its report, and said that U.S. Steel should provide pensions for its workers. [...] Fairless denounced the recommendation as a [...] "revolution" [...] against free enterprise, and rejected the fact-finding panel's report wholesale. Nonetheless, Fairless agreed to attend a mediation session in Washington, D.C., two days later. On September 17, Murray accused Fairless of imposing a double-standard on workers when he revealed that U.S. Steel was paying the pensions of its executives. Public opinion turned sharply against Fairless, and with the Taft-Hartley injunction due to expire Murray announced that the union would strike. Fairless opened bargaining with the union, and President Truman won a postponement of the strike until October 1 in order to allow negotiations to bear fruit. But the negotiations did not result in a contract, and the union struck on schedule. Murray announced on October 13 that the union would settle for a pension plan funded by a 29 cents per hour contribution from U.S. Steel. Fairless continued to resist the pension plan idea. But as layoffs spread throughout the steel industry, other steel companies began meeting with Ching to seek a resolution. [...] On October 18, Fairless quietly sent an aide to meet with Ching and to discuss the pension plan proposal. On October 31, Bethlehem Steel reached an agreement with the United Steelworkers that implemented a pension plan. [...] Under pressure to agree to the same terms, Fairless agreed to meet with Ching and Murray. But no agreement was forthcoming. [...] Jones & Laughlin Steel signed a pension plan deal with the union on November 7, and Youngstown Sheet & Tube agreed to the union's terms two days later. With all the other major steel companies resuming production, Fairless set aside his previous opposition to the pension plan and signed with the union on November 11.|$|E
2500|$|On August 20, 2005, {{after months}} of negotiations, an impasse {{declared}} by the NMB and a 30-day cooling <b>off</b> <b>period,</b> the over 4,750 Northwest aircraft mechanics, janitors, and aircraft cleaners represented by AMFA went on strike against the company. After numerous negotiation sessions, no agreement was reached, and the company began hiring permanent replacement workers. In mid-October, after permanently hiring about 500 non-union workers, Northwest made a final offer to the union. The offer would have saved 500 union jobs and offered four weeks of severance pay to terminated employees. This offer was worse than the original declined by the union, which would have saved over 2,000 jobs and offered 16 weeks of severance pay. On October 20, 2005, AMFA {{announced that it would}} not allow its members to vote on the offer, citing that parts of the contract would violate the union's commitment to its members. Finally, in late December 2005, Northwest made what it termed its [...] "final offer" [...] to the union. The agreement would have terminated all striking workers and given them rights to unemployment compensation. The union voted down the offer. On October 9, 2006, AMFA leadership and Northwest reached an agreement. Under the settlement, all AMFA workers still on strike as of that date will be converted to lay-off status with 5 weeks of severance pay (10 weeks if they resign from Northwest). However, these employees will have a right of recall to their old jobs. Approval of the settlement was on November 6, 2006.|$|E

2500|$|As World War II ended, Fairless led U.S. Streel through {{yet another}} major steel strike. [...] The United Steelworkers demanded a {{significant}} pay increase {{in order to}} once more bring pay {{in line with the}} heavy inflation brought about by the war. [...] With prices still strictly regulated by the federal government, in November 1945 Fairless refused to grant any pay increase unless the government approved a $2 per ton increase in the price of steel. Secretary of Labor Lewis B. Schwellenbach urged the parties to come to an agreement out of a concern for national security, but Fairless refused without a price increase. Steel industry executives asked the National Labor Relations Board to prevent a strike, but the agency said it lacked the power. The Office of Price Administration on November 24 declined to permit a price increase, arguing it would violate its price regulations. But the union agreed to a 30-day cooling <b>off</b> <b>period,</b> and on December 31 President Harry S. Truman won agreement from Fairless and Murray to establish a fact-finding board to study the issue. One week later, the president conferred with OPA Administrator Chester Bowles, and Bowles agreed to consider a $2.50 per ton increase in the price of steel. But OPA's fact-finding was nowhere near complete. [...] With the steel strike scheduled to begin on January 13, Truman summoned Fairless and Murray to the White House on January 11. Truman convinced Murray to delay the strike one week, but the two sides were still far apart on the pay rise (Murray demanding 19 cents an hour, and Fairless offering just 15 cents an hour). On January 13, Fairless consulted with other steel industry executives about the talks. The following day, Truman indicated publicly that he would approve a $4 per ton price increase, but only if the two sides came to agreement via collective bargaining on a wage increase. Murray indicated he would accept Truman's offer. But Murray also reportedly said that the steel industry was engaged in a [...] "conspiracy" [...] to destroy the labor movement, a statement which outraged Fairless and led to a breakdown in talks. With no resolution, the strike occurred as scheduled on January 19. [...] Fairless denounced the strike as an attack on the president's wartime reconversion program, industry, and the public good. On January 24, Fairless asked the president to call a national wage and price conference covering all major industries to establish new national wage and price levels. But Truman rejected the plan, and reiterated that his basic proposal from January was the only one he would consider. On January 28, Fairless opened talks with the United Steelworkers. As the strike continued into February 1946 without resolution, Congress began holding hearings on the issue. [...] On February 9, Murray testified that Fairless had offered him a 19 cents per hour wage increase on January 12. Congressional and public opinion turned against Fairless, and on February 15 he and Murray agreed to an 18 cent an hour wage increase.|$|E
6000|$|So far we {{have studied}} {{some of the details}} in the legend of Zeus which did not conspicuously win their way into the {{national}} literature. The object has been to notice a few of the myths which appear the most ancient, and the most truly native and original. These are the traditions preserved in mystery-plays, tribal genealogies, and temple legends, the traditions surviving from the far <b>off</b> <b>period</b> of the village Greeks. It has already been argued, in conformity with the opinion of C. O. Müller, that these myths are most antique and thoroughly local. [...] "Any attempt to explain these myths in order, such, for instance, as we now find them in the collection of Apollodorus, as a system of thought and knowledge, must prove a fruitless task." [...] Equally useless is it to account for them all as stories originally told to describe, consciously or unconsciously, or to explain any atmospheric and meteorological phenomena. Zeus is the bright sky; granted, but the men who told how he became an ant, or a cuckoo, or celebrated a sham wedding with a wooden image, or offered Troy a golden vine, [...] "the work of Hephaestus," [...] like other articles of jewellery, were not thinking of the bright sky when they repeated the story. They were merely strengthening some ancient family or tribal tradition by attaching it to the name of a great, powerful, personal being, an immortal. This being, not the elemental force that was Zeus, not the power [...] "making for righteousness" [...] that is Zeus, not the pure spiritual ruler of the world, the Zeus of philosophy, is the hero of the myths that have been investigated.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{elucidate}} the clinical spectrum and frequency of non-motor symptoms during <b>off</b> <b>periods</b> (NMOS) in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with motor fluctuation. We compared clinical characteristics between PD patients with motor symptoms only (M-off) and those with both motor and non-motor symptoms (NM-off) during <b>off</b> <b>periods.</b> The association of NMOS with parkinsonian clinical characteristics was also investigated. Sixty-seven consecutive PD patients of both M-off and NM-off groups were included in this study. We reviewed medical records, interviewed the patients, and administered a structured questionnaire. NMOS is classified into three categories: autonomic, neuropsychiatric and sensory. The frequency of NMOS and their individual manifestations were assessed. Of 67 patients with off symptoms, 20 were M-off group and 47 NM-off group. Among NMOS, diffuse pain was the most common manifestation, followed by anxiety and sweating. There were no significant differences between M-off and NM-off groups with regard to age, duration of disease and treatment, interval between onset of parkinsonian symptoms and off symptoms and <b>off</b> <b>periods.</b> Patients taking higher dosage of levodopa had fewer NMOS.
