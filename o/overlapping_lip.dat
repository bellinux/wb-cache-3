The case is suspended parallel with the plane of the leaf, two or three fine silk threads attaching its anal extremity to the leaf. [...] Walsingham, 1907:602 ...|$|E
40|$|Most of {{the studies}} on the large igneous provinces (LIPs) focus on Phanerozoic times, and in particular, thoserelated to the {{disruption}} of Pangea (e. g. CAMP, Karoo, Parana–Etendeka) while Precambrian LIPs (e. g. Ventersdorpf, Fortescue) remain less studied. Although the investigation of Precambrian LIPs is difficultbecause they are relatively poorly preserved, assessment of their geochemical characteristics in parallel withyounger <b>overlapping</b> <b>LIP</b> is fundamental for monitoring {{the evolution of the}} mantle composition through time. Recent 40 Ar/ 39 Ar dating of the Okavango giant dyke swarm (and related sills) in southern Africa showed that~ 90 % of the dykes were emplaced at 179 ± 1 Ma and belong to the Karoo large igneous province whereas ~ 10 % ofdykes yielded Proterozoic ages (~ 1 – 1. 1 Ga). Here,weprovide newmajor, trace and rare earth elements analysesof the low-Ti Proterozoic Okavango dyke swarm (PODS) that suggest, combined with age data, a cognate originwith the 1. 1 Ga Umkondo large igneous province (UIP), southern Africa. The geochemical characteristics of the PODS and UIP basalts are comparable to those of overlapping low-TiKaroo basalts, and suggest that both LIPs were derived from similar enriched mantle sources. A mantle plumeorigin for these LIPs is not easily reconciled with the geochemical dataset and the coincidence of twocompositionally similar mantle plumes acting 900 Myr apart is unlikely. Instead,we propose that the Umkondoand Karoo large igneous provinces monitored the slight evolution of a shallow enriched lithospheric mantlefrom Proterozoic to Jurassic...|$|E

40|$|A brief {{review is}} given of the {{literature}} of the soleid genus Aseraggodes, restricted to the Indo-Pacific region except for one species in the Galapagos Islands. Aseraggodes ocellatus, described from Sri Lanka by Weed (1961), is synonymized with Pardachirus pavoninus (Lacepede). Aseraggodes is represented in the Hawaiian Islands by two shallow-water endemic species: A. borehami Randall, n. sp., is distinct in its combination of having 71 - 75 dorsal rays; 49 - 52 anal rays; 66 - 70 lateral-line scales; a moderately elongate body (depth 2. 55 - 2. 8 in SL); front of upper <b>lip</b> not <b>overlapping</b> lower <b>lip</b> when mouth closed; caudal peduncle present but short; moderately large size (largest of 10 specimens, 102. 8 mm SL); and an ocular-side color pattern of light brown with numerous irregular white spots, some scales variously edged in dark brown. Aseraggodes therese Randall, n. sp., has 72 - 79 dorsal rays; 5461 anal rays; 60 - 66 lateral-line scales; body depth 2. 25 to 2. 75 in SL; front of upper <b>lip</b> <b>overlapping</b> lower <b>lip</b> when mouth closed; no caudal peduncle; small size (largest of 27 specimens, 66 mm SL); and an ocular-side color pattern dominated by irregular dark brown blotches of variable size, the largest in three longitudinal series...|$|R
40|$|Closed form {{expressions}} {{are obtained}} for the stress intensity factors (SIFs) {{in case of a}} Brazilian disc with a short central crack, the length of which does not exceed one fifth of the disc radius. The disc is loaded by uniform radial pressure along two finite symmetric arcs of its periphery. The solution is achieved using the method of complex potentials introduced by Kolosov and Muskhelishvili. The advantage of the expressions obtained is that they are valid both for cracks under opening mode as well as for closing cracks. For the first case (opening cracks) {{the results of the present}} study are compared with existing approximate solutions and it is concluded that the agreement is excellent as long as the length of the crack remains relatively small compared to the radius of the disc. Regarding the case of a closing mode crack the procedure proposed here (based on a recent alternative approach of the cracked Brazilian disc) leads to a physically acceptable deformed crack shape instead to an unnatural crack with <b>overlapped</b> <b>lips.</b> At the same moment the dependence of the SIFs on the properties of the material is eliminated.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{investigation has}} been performed {{to determine the}} exact geometrical features of an inclined, biaxially loaded, crack in an infinite elastic plate. It {{has been shown that}} the shape of the deformed Griffith crack, as this follows from the exact linear elastic displacement field at the lips of the crack, is always an ellipse in opposition to the singular and two-term solutions which give a parabolic shape for the deformed lips of the crack. The combined effect of the mode of loading, the load biaxiality and the crack orientation on the lengths of the semiaxes of the ellipse, and the orientation of its major axis with respect to the initial crack was studied in detail. It is also shown that in general the positions of the initial crack tips after deformation on the curve of the ellipse do not coincide with the points of the maximum curvature of the ellipse. The case, where the ellipse presents <b>overlapping</b> <b>lips</b> and where the elastic solution becomes invalid, has been examined and the configurations of the problem-parameters for which this phenomenon happens has been established. These important features of the deformed shape of the loaded crack may have a considerable influence on the mode of loading and the behaviour in yielding and fracture of the cracked bodies. © 1986 Martinus Nijhoff Publishers...|$|R

40|$|During the {{starting}} transient of {{a note on}} a brass instrument it can take several cycles of lip vibration before acoustics reflections {{from the end of}} the instrument can influence the lip frequency. Under certain conditions the lip may fail to oscillate at the pitch of the air column resulting in an unwanted pulse-like waveform with relatively low repetition rates (similar to the vocal fry register of phonation in the human voice). This is often observed in the playing of beginners if the lips are insufficiently tense or if the top and bottom <b>lips</b> <b>overlap</b> to a large extent. In this study the reasons for this behavior will be investigated using modeling techniques with the aim of improving the agreement between physical models and measured transients by including the forces responsible for this effect.

40|$|An {{analysis}} of the displacement field along the lips of an internal crack in an infinite elastic plate, submitted to pure shear, was undertaken, based on the exact solution. It was shown that the in-plane components of displacement of the lips of the crack consist of: (i) a linear term, normal to the initial axis of the crack, which brings this axis to its effective position. The angle λ formed by this axis and the initial axis of the crack has a tangent given by tan λ = 2 σ∞ E, where σ∞ is the normal stress applied to the plate at infinity and E the elastic modulus of the material, and (ii) a parallel to the initial axis component of displacement, which {{is proportional to the}} square of the distance from the tip of the crack. This component for pure shear is always negative, making the lips of the crack overlap each other. If to these in-plane displacements the out-of-plane component is added, the topography of the lips of the crack in pure shear is presenting a ravine with negative slopes, which terminates to two hills around the crack tips, which are sliced in halves along the crack-axis. Either half of each hill is replaced by its mirror surface, relative to the undeformed lateral faces of the plate. It was shown that the <b>overlapping</b> of <b>lips</b> starts with the application of any shearing load and develops up to an eventual creation of plastic enclaves at the tips of the crack. Conditions for zero relative displacement between the respective lips were established, which consist in adding a complementary lateral tensile load, whose magnitude depends on the applied load to the plate. © 1986...|$|R
40|$|Endoplasmic {{reticulum}} (ER) stress elicits the unfolded protein response (UPR), initially {{aimed at}} {{coping with the}} stress, but triggering cell death upon further stress. ER stress induces the C/EBP-® variant Liver-enriched Activating Protein (LAP), followed by the dominant-negative variant, Liver Inhibitory Protein (LIP). However, the distinct role of LAP and LIP in ER stress is unknown. We found that the kinetics of the ER stress-induced expression of <b>LIP</b> <b>overlapped</b> {{with that of the}} cell death in mouse B 16 melanoma cells. Furthermore, inducible over-expression of LIP augmented ER stress-triggered cell death whereas over-expression of LAP attenuated cell death. Similar results were obtained in human 293 T cells. Limited vasculature in tumors triggers hypoxia, nutrient shortage and accumulation of toxic metabolites, all of which eliciting continuous ER stress. We found that LAP promoted and LIP inhibited B 16 melanoma tumor progression without affecting angiogenesis or accelerating the cell cycle. Rather, LAP attenuated, whereas LIP augmented tumor ER stress. We therefore suggest that C/EBP-® regulates the transition from the protective to the death–promoting phase of the UPR. We further suggest that the over-expression of LAP observed in many solid tumors promotes tumor progression by attenuating ER stress–triggered tumor cell death...|$|R
40|$|Whereas the {{singular}} solution for an internal crack in an infinite plate induced to a biaxial loading at infinity defines that the crack tips remain unmoved during deformation, the twoterm approximate solution implies some {{movement of the}} tips. The exact solution based on Muskhelishvili's complex potentials gives a thorough and exact view of {{the form of the}} deformed crack. The paradoxes of the aspect of the exact solution are several and may be classified as follows, (i) While overall tension opens the crack lips and overall compression makes the <b>lips</b> <b>overlap</b> congruently, so that the crack resembles a completely closed line without any stress concentration at its tips, the contribution of shear is always to make the crack flanks overlap in a non-congruent manner, thus developing strongly variable friction between the closed lips, (ii) The deformed crack length under shear loading is always different than its initial length depending on the angle of obliquity and the loading step, (iii) The deformed crack axis is different from the initial axis, (iv) The shape of the deformed crack is always elliptic with the upper lip penetrating inside the lower lip and vice versa, (v) There is always a clockwise or anticlockwise displacement of the lips depending on the sign of shear in a carousel mode, (vi) In this way new points behind the crack tips are replacing them as points of the vertices of the elliptic crack during continued loading, (vii) The curvature of the vertices is decreasing as the load is increased, (viii) The elliptic shape of the crack for the exact solution becomes a double parabolic shape with corners behind the vertices of the parabolas for {{the singular}} and the two-term solution. These unrealistic shapes of the deformed crack overestimate its relative lip-displacements, as compared with the exact solution. © 1987...|$|R
