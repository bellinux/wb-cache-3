For both nonzero cbb, constraints exist. The positive one is capped by the society’s availability to finance other countries {{instead of using}} their own budget resources for internal needs.

We first review the framework that defines budgetary arrangements in place in Spain, with a special emphasis on the decentralization process. We then present official budgetary projections for the balance of the different levels of Government and compare them with both <b>outturn</b> and national <b>accounts</b> data. We assess the magnitude of the differences between budgetary and national accounts balance data and between the latter and a balance obtained with currently available data on a broad definition of public sector activity.

Morocco’s fiscal management system, which remains highly centralized, is essentially reliable and supported by legal safeguards, and adequate for steering budget performance.

40|$|Fiscal Responsibility Laws (FRLs) {{appear to}} be more popular in middle-income {{countries}} than advanced countries, even though their success is limited. The reasons why few advanced countries have a FRL include: the existing legal framework for the budget system is adequate; supranational rules and political agreements in EU countries; failed attempts to include quantitative fiscal rules in laws; lack of consensus or interest in attaining the goals of FRL-type legislation; and lack of need for a law to regulate fiscal transparency, accountability and macro-fiscal stabilization. Without commitment to fiscal discipline, adoption of a FRL may not contribute to attaining fiscal consolidation goals.

This paper examines the experience of OECD countries in introducing such reforms and assesses whether the same reform strategy be applied to non-OECD countries. It examines how emerging economies should begin such reforms, and how they should be sequenced thereafter. Based on a thorough review of the technical assistance provided by the IMF's Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD) to middle-income countries, this paper will be useful to policymakers and administrators in emerging economies who are contemplating such reforms.
