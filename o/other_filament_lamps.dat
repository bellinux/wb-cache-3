40|$|The aging {{characteristics}} and lifetimes of tungsten <b>filament</b> encoder <b>lamps</b> were determined {{as a function}} of operating voltage and filament material. For pure tungsten and thoria doped (1 pct.) <b>filament</b> <b>lamps,</b> crystal grain growth over the center portion of the filament leads to the ultimate failure of the lamp. The development of notches associated with this grain growth is the cause of lamp burn out. Eventually, one of the notches will 'etch' through the filament, causing it to fail open. For rhenium doped (3 pct.) <b>filament</b> <b>lamps,</b> distortion of the filament leads to the ultimate failure of the lamp. The lifetime of these lamps is about 1 year at an operating voltage of 5. 0 volts. The pure tungsten <b>filament</b> <b>lamps</b> have the longest average lifetime, and the thoria doped <b>filament</b> <b>lamps</b> have the shortest at 5. 0 volts. The lifetimes of these lamps is about 7 years at an operating voltage of 3. 5 volts. Data suggest that the rhenium doped lamps will have the longest average lifetime at 3. 5 volts, and the thoria doped will have the shortest. These lifetimes are comparable to the desired lifetimes of 7 years...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a {{constant}} illumination level {{control of a}} reading lamp is considered, with the microcontroller PIC, by continuously adjusting the illumination level on a desk from the <b>filament</b> <b>lamp.</b> The illumination, from the <b>filament</b> <b>lamp,</b> is transformed into the voltage by the phototransistor on the desk. From the voltage thus transformed, we can know the illumination level on the desk indirectly. For the purpose of constant illumination level control, the phase control of the AC voltage, {{in terms of the}} triac, is adopted. Since the transformed voltage through the phototransistor is small, the voltage is amplified by the operational amplifier. The amplified voltage is applied to the microcomputer PIC and A/D converted in the PIC with a resolution of 10 bits. The microcontroller program is implemented as follows. If the A/ D converted value is larger than the reference input value, the phase delay of the AC voltage, applied to the <b>filament</b> <b>lamp,</b> is set to increase. Then the brightness of the <b>filament</b> <b>lamp</b> decreases, and vice versa. According to these adjustments of the illumination level on the desk, the feedback control of the constant illumination level from the reading lamp, is carried out...|$|R
