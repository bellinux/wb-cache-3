5|$|A.phalloides {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{poisonous}} of all known toadstools. It is estimated that as little as half a mushroom contains enough toxin to kill an adult human.

It has been the subject <b>of</b> <b>much</b> research, and many of its biologically active agents have been isolated. The principal toxic constituent is α-amanitin, which damages the liver and kidneys, causing hepatic and renal failure that can be fatal.|$|E

5|$|After leaving Cambridge, Horrocks {{returned}} {{to his home in}} Lancashire and began collecting books and instruments in order to pursue his main interest, the study of astronomy.

5|$|After the war ended, the OSS {{conducted}} {{an investigation into}} Cicero, interviewing key German players including Moyzisch. It was postulated that of the intelligence conveyed by Cicero to the Germans, the most notable information came from Knatchbull-Hugessen's notes, particularly regarding diplomatic efforts with the Turkish government. Many of the other documents were considered by Ostuf Schuddekoft, head of the British section of Amt VI , to be {{too old to be}} <b>of</b> <b>much</b> value to the Germans. Moyzisch was aggressively interviewed by the Allies and was a witness at the Nuremberg trials, after which he wrote a book to address rumors and explain his role during the war. He was never charged with a war crime.|$|E

5|$|Although Montcalm {{and other}} French {{officers}} attempted to stop further attacks, others did not, and some explicitly refused to provide further protection to the British.

5|$|As the 100,000-year {{periodicity}} only {{dominates the}} climate of the past million years, there is insufficient information to separate the component frequencies of eccentricity using spectral analysis, making the reliable detection of significant longer-term trends more difficult, although the spectral analysis <b>of</b> <b>much</b> longer palaeoclimate records, such as the Lisiecki and Raymo stack of marine cores and James Zachos' composite isotopic record, helps to put the last million years in longer term context. Hence {{there is still no}} clear proof of the mechanism responsible for the 100ka periodicity—but there are several credible hypotheses.|$|E

5|$|As {{with the}} related genus Barosaurus, the very long neck of Diplodocus {{is the source}} <b>of</b> <b>much</b> {{controversy}} among scientists. A 1992 Columbia University study of diplodocid neck structure indicated that the longest necks would have required a 1.6-ton heart — {{a tenth of the}} animal's body weight. The study proposed that animals like these would have had rudimentary auxiliary 'hearts' in their necks, whose only purpose was to pump blood up to the next 'heart'. Some argue that the near-horizontal posture {{of the head and neck}} would have eliminated the problem of supplying blood to the brain, as it would not be elevated.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} there was a growing {{movement}} to attract native intelligentsia, educated at schools run by the Dutch colonial government, and convince them to view domestic films, which were generally considered to be <b>of</b> <b>much</b> lower quality than imported Hollywood productions. This was blamed, in part, on the dominance of theatrically trained actors and crew. As such, Ariffien invited Gani, at the time a medical doctor and a prominent member of the nationalist movement, to join the cast. Although some nationalists considered Gani's involvement in Asmara Moerni as besmirching the independence movement, Gani considered it necessary: he believed audiences needed to have higher opinions of domestic film productions.|$|E
