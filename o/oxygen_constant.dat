40|$|Aims:  The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a system that would allow biofilms to be {{cultivated}} under strictly defined conditions in terms of dissolved oxygen, fluid shear and to assess whether the method was suitable for the detection of respiratory activity stratification in biofilm samples. Methods:  The system is a modified version a commercially available laboratory biofilm reactor and incorporates a number of features such as the provision of defined levels of dissolved <b>oxygen,</b> <b>constant</b> average shear, enhanced gas–liquid mass transfer, aseptic operation and the ability to remove biofilm for ex situ analysis during or after continuous cultivation. Conclusions:  The system was shown to be effective for the characterization of the effects of dissolved oxygen on a pure culture of Staphylococcus epidermidis. The versatility of the system offers the potential for cultivating pure culture biofilm in defined, controlled conditions and facilitates a range of analyses that can be performed ex situ. Significance and Impact of the Study:  The ability to provide strict regulation of environmental conditions and enhanced transfer of oxygen to the biofilm during cultivation are important, first because oxygen is known to regulate biofilm development in several micro-organisms and second because many conventional biofilm cultivation systems may not provide adequate oxygen supply to the biofilm...|$|E
40|$|Material erosion data {{collected}} during flight experiments {{such as the}} Environmental Oxygen Interaction with Materials (EOIM) - 3 and the Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) have raised questions as to the sensitivity of material erosion to levels of atomic oxygen exposure and vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) radiation. The erosion sensitivity of some materials such as FEP Teflon used as a thermal control material on satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO), is particularly important but difficult to determine. This is in large {{part due to the}} inability to hold all but one exposure parameter constant during a flight experiment. This is also difficult to perform in a ground based facility, because often the variation of the level of atomic oxygen or VUV radiation also results in a change in the level of the other parameter. A facility has been developed which allows each parameter to be changed almost independently and offer broad area exposure. The resulting samples can be made large enough for mechanical testing. The facility uses an electron cyclotron resonance plasma source to provide the atomic oxygen. A series of glass plates is used to focus the atomic oxygen while filtering the VUV radiation from the plasma source. After filtering, atomic oxygen effective flux levels can still be measured which are as high as 7 x 10 (exp 15) atoms/cm(exp 2) -sec which is adequate for accelerated testing. VUV radiation levels after filtering can be as low as 0. 3 suns. Additional VUV suns can be added with the use of deuterium lamps which allow the VUV level to be changed while keeping the flux of atomic <b>oxygen</b> <b>constant.</b> This paper discusses the facility, and results from exposure of Kapton and FEP at pre-determined atomic oxygen flux and VUV sun levels...|$|E
40|$|Oxygen {{levels in}} {{cancerous}} tissue {{can have a}} significant effect on treatment response: hypoxic tissue is both more radioresistant and more chemoresistant than well-oxygenated tissue. While recent advances in medical imaging have facilitated real-time observation of macroscopic oxygenation, the underlying physics limits the resolution to the millimetre domain, whereas oxygen tension varies over a micrometre scale. If the distribution of oxygen in the tumour micro-environment can be accurately estimated, then the effect of potential dose escalation to these hypoxic regions could be better modelled, allowing more realistic simulation of biologically adaptive treatments. Reaction-diffusion models are commonly used for modelling oxygen dynamics, with a variety of functional forms assumed for the dependence of oxygen consumption rate (OCR) on cellular status and local oxygen availability. In this work, we examine reaction-diffusion models of oxygen consumption in spherically and cylindrically symmetric geometries. We consider two different descriptions of oxygen consumption: one in which the rate of consumption is constant and one in which it varies with oxygen tension in a hyperbolic manner. In each case, we derive analytic approximations to the steady-state oxygen distribution, which are shown to closely match the numerical solutions of the equations and accurately predict the extent to which oxygen can diffuse. The derived expressions relate the limit to which oxygen can diffuse into a tissue to the OCR of that tissue. We also demonstrate that differences between these functional forms are likely to be negligible within the range of literature estimates of the hyperbolic <b>oxygen</b> <b>constant,</b> suggesting that the constant consumption rate approximation suffices for modelling oxygen dynamics for most values of OCR. These approximations also allow the rapid identification of situations where hyperbolic consumption forms can result in significant differences from constant consumption rate models, and so can reduce the computational workload associated with numerical solutions, by estimating both the oxygen diffusion distances and resultant oxygen profile. Such analysis may be useful for parameter fitting in large imaging datasets and histological sections, and allows easy quantification of projected differences between functional forms of OCR...|$|E
