40|$|It is {{possible}} to reduce crosstalk between optical signals in intersecting <b>optical</b> <b>conductors</b> by taking two steps: Minimize amount of light diffracted into wrong conductor by selecting optimum conductor width, and place light traps in each conductor.

40|$|The {{theoretical}} description for the reflectivity {{properties of}} dielectric, metal and semiconductor plates coated with graphene is {{developed in the}} framework of the Dirac model. Graphene is described by the polarization tensor allowing the analytic continuation to the real frequency axis. The plate materials are described by the frequency-dependent dielectric permittivities. The general formulas for the reflection coefficients and reflectivities of the graphene-coated plates, as well as their asymptotic expressions at high and low frequencies, are derived. The developed theory is applied to the graphene-coated dielectric (fused silica), metal (Au and Ni), and semiconductor (Si with various charge carrier concentrations) plates. In all these cases the impact of graphene coating on the plate reflectivity properties is calculated over the wide frequency ranges. The obtained results can be used in many applications exploiting the graphene coatings, such as the <b>optical</b> detectors, transparent <b>conductors,</b> anti-reflection surfaces etc. Comment: 17 pages, 9 figures.

50|$|Electrochromic {{devices are}} {{one kind of}} {{electrochromic}} cells. The basic structure of ECD consists of two-EC layers separated by an electrolytic layer. The ECD works on an external voltage, for which the conducting electrodes are used on the either side of both EC layers. Electrochromic devices can be categorized in two types depending upon the kind of electrolyte used viz. laminated ECD are {{the one in which}} liquid gel is used while in solid electrolyte EC devices solid inorganic or organic material is used. The basic structure of electrochromic device embodies five superimposed layers on one substrate or positioned between two substrates in a laminated configuration. In this structure there are three principally different kinds of layered materials in the ECD: The EC layer and ion-storage layer conduct ions and electrons and belong to the class of mixed conductors. The electrolyte is a pure ion conductor and separates the two EC layers. The transparent conductors are pure electron <b>conductors.</b> <b>Optical</b> absorption occurs when electrons move into the EC layers from the transparent conductors along with charge balancing ions entering from the electrolyte.|$|R

40|$|Hybrid perovskites (CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{promising}} novel materials for solar harvesting. Toxicity of lead (Pb), however, has always remained a concern. We investigated the electronic structure of complete replacement of Pb by alkaline earths (Ca, Sr, Ba) and found it to be wide band gapped (Eg) semiconductors (band gap 3. 7 to 4. 0 eV), and hence not suitable as absorber material. This opens up a new avenue to explore these materials as transparent conductor (TC). We doped CH 3 NH 3 BaI 3 (largest Eg) with La, which shifts its Fermi level (EF) at conduction band bottom and induces states at EF for conduction. This is precisely what is required for a transparent <b>conductor.</b> <b>Optical</b> and transport properties simulated from linear response (within Density Functional Theory (DFT)) calculations suggested it to be a very good TC material with a high figure of merit (σ/α), where σ is the electrical conductivity and α is the optical absorption coefficient. This claim is also supported by our calculated results on density of states at EF, effective mass, carrier concentration etc. at various La-doping. We propose CH 3 NH 3 (Ba 1 -xLax) I 3 (x 12. 5...|$|R
40|$|Photonics is an {{exciting}} area of study that is situated at the cross-section of physics, material science, and electrical engineering. The integration of photonic devices serves to reduce the size, weight, power consumption, and cost of the photonics- based systems, whose applications can be as disparate in nature as communications and medicine. In particular, an integrated all-optical logic gate and wavelength converter for fiber-optic telecommunications and an integrated tunable laser for trace-gas sensing are investigated in this thesis. These devices are fabricated in the indium phosphide (InP) material system, which includes InP and the ternary/quaternary III-V semiconductors that can be grown closely lattice-matched on the InP substrate. The all-optical logic gate is designed as a Mach-Zehnder interferometer with semi- <b>conductor</b> <b>optical</b> amplifiers as active nonlinear elements that are optically coupled to the passive waveguides using the asymmetric twin waveguide technique. The device is grown and fabricated monolithically and carrier-dependent optical interference is demonstrated at the 1. 55 [mu]m wavelength. The tunable diode laser is designed {{to operate in the}} wavelength range of 1. 55 [mu]m - 2 [mu]m for trace-gas spectroscopic sensing and comprises of strained InGaAs quantum wells. The laser is monolithically fabricated using mask-less lithography techniques and tuning is demonstrated in Fabry-Perot cavity lasers under continuous-wave operation. A ring-coupled 2 [mu]m wavelength laser is designed that will exhibit a tuning range of tens of nanometers. by Ta-Ming Shih. Thesis (Ph. D.)
