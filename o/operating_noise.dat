40|$|Time delay {{estimation}} (TDE) {{is essential}} for PD location using the UHF technique. However, noise and effects of multi-path propagation are two main problems affecting {{the accuracy of the}} estimate. Comparing two methods, which are based on cumulative energy curve and power curve respectively, a cross correlation based method is employed to achieve the estimation. A high-pass filter is applied to the UHF signal to eliminate <b>operating</b> <b>noises.</b> The phase characteristic of the filter is designed to be linear for making the time delay a constant in terms of frequency. A window in the time domain is selected to reduce the effect of multi-path propagation...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} <b>operating</b> system <b>noise,</b> {{which we}} identify {{as one of}} the main reasons for a lack of synchronicity in parallel applications. Using a microbenchmark, we measure the noise on several contemporary platforms and find that, even with a general-purpose <b>operating</b> sys-tem, <b>noise</b> can be limited if certain precautions are taken. We then inject artificially generated noise into a massively parallel system and measure its influence on the performance of collec-tive operations. Our experiments indicate that on extreme-scale platforms, the performance is correlated with the largest interruption to the application, even if the probability of such an in-terruption on a single process is extremely small. We demonstrate that synchronizing the noise can significantly reduce its negative influence...|$|R

The line re-opened in March 2013 with the 45 cars operational.

50|$|Lubricants are {{typically}} used to separate moving parts in a system. This separation has {{the benefit of}} reducing friction and surface fatigue, together with reduced heat generation, <b>operating</b> <b>noise</b> and vibrations. Lubricants achieve this in several ways. The most common is by forming a physical barrier i.e., {{a thin layer of}} lubricant separates the moving parts. This is analogous to hydroplaning, the loss of friction observed when a car tire is separated from the road surface by moving through standing water. This is termed hydrodynamic lubrication. In cases of high surface pressures or temperatures, the fluid film is much thinner and some of the forces are transmitted between the surfaces through the lubricant..|$|E
5000|$|Columbia's basic runabout {{was typical}} of the time, {{resembling}} a horseless carriage, and was steered via a tiller. It cost , [...] more than the contemporary Curved Dash Oldsmobile. The 1200 lb, single bench seat vehicle had a wheelbase of 64 in, and rode on 30 in wooden spoked wheels, with leather fenders. The drivetrain had clear evolutionary roots in Pope's bicycle business, driving the rear axle via a chain drive, producing virtually the only <b>operating</b> <b>noise.</b> Between the motor and the chain drive was a transmission with three forward and two reverse speeds. Twenty batteries manufactured by Exide Batteries, also associated with Electric Vehicle Company, were placed above both axles in order to balance the weight. Brakes on both rear wheels featured a bell, which rang when the vehicle reached a full stop. Top speed was about 15 mi/h km/h.|$|E

40|$|Optical tools {{respond to}} {{internal}} vibration {{that can be}} excited by the external acoustic environment. The degree to which this occurs depends on many factors, but primarily the correspondence between the resonance characteristics of the tool and the frequency content of the acoustic environment in which it <b>operates.</b> Adverse <b>noise</b> environments, such as those often found in operating laboratories and microelectronics fabrication facilities, can affect the threshold of resolution achievable by the tool. This paper reviews the (typically somewhat inadequate) state of noise specification for optical tools, and the noise levels in typical spaces in which these are intended to <b>operate.</b> Manufacturer’s <b>noise</b> specifications often overstate or understate the sensitivity of their tool when the noise sensitivity criterion is oversimplified.

5000|$|The biggest {{highlight}} to {{this line of}} notebook GPUs is the implementation of configured specifications close to (for the GTX 1060-1080) and exceeding (for the GTX 1050/1050 Ti) that of their desktop counterparts, as opposed to having [...] "cut-down" [...] specifications in previous generations. As a result, the [...] "M" [...] suffix is completely removed from the model's naming schemes, denoting these notebook GPUs to possess similar performance to those made for desktop PCs, including the ability to overclock their core frequencies by the user, something not possible with previous generations of notebook GPUs. This was made possible having lower TDP ratings as compared to their desktop equivalents, making these desktop-level GPUs thermally feasible to be implemented into OEM notebook chassis with improved thermal dissipation designs, and as such are only available through the OEMs that. In addition, the GP104 and GP106-based Notebook GPUs also come in lower-TDP and quieter variations called the Max-Q Design specifically made for ultra-thin gaming systems in conjunction with OEM Partners that incorporate enhanced heat dissipation mechanisms with lower <b>operating</b> <b>noise</b> volumes, largely made as an additional more powerful option to existing gaming notebooks as well, which was launched on 27th June 2017.|$|E
50|$|It is true the finder {{does not}} go black during exposure, but at small lens apertures, the eye has no time {{to adjust to the}} dark finder. The <b>operating</b> <b>noise</b> from the Pellix is {{surprisingly}} {{similar to that of the}} Canon FX using a moving reflex mirror. Canon made two fast lenses, the FL 50mm 1:1.4 and the FL 58mm 1:1.2, in order to compensate for the light loss, but fast lenses might increase the risk of the sun burning holes in the shutter curtain not being protected by a solid mirror; a fact anticipated and solved by providing the Pellix with a metal shutter curtain. Another obstacle is the risk of light finding its way into the camera by way of the finder window during exposure, since there is no mirror to block the path in its up-position. This was also anticipated, and a finder blind is provided which is operated by turning the ring under the rewind knob, especially useful when leaving the camera on a stand. The Meter circuit is susceptible to breakage due to the CdS meter arm being moved into position behind the pellicle mirror during exposure reading. A special lens was made available for the Canon Pellix, the FLP 38mm 1:2.8, utilising the fact the camera has a stationary mirror that will not hit the lens' rear element. The FLP code indicates that this lens is exclusively to be used on Pellix camera.|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{the flow}} inside an air {{purifier}} was visualized using {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD), and the noise caused by airflow was predicted using computational aero-acoustics (CAA). With the obtained results, the causes of blade passage frequency (BPF) noise and turbulent flow noise that dominate the <b>operating</b> <b>noise</b> of the air purifier were investigated. The relationship between design parameters and BPF noise was subsequently derived by the kriging metamodel, and the optimum fan blade dimensions that minimize <b>operating</b> <b>noise</b> were acquired by an evolutionary algorithm (EA). The relationship between BPF noise and design parameters mentioned {{was intended to be}} used as a design guide during the early stage of fan blade design. In addition, in this study was designed to be able to estimate the origin of noise intuitively by visualizing internal flow. Lastly, the low-noise performance of the air purifier was verified through analytical and experimental methods, including the fabrication and testing of a physical mockup. Compared to the initial model, the fan blade <b>operating</b> <b>noise</b> decreased by 4. 5 dB(A) in the main range. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Assessing the {{confidence}} of detection for candidate signals of gravitational waves is a particularly subtle matter. A fundamental step toward this achievement is the validation of the output data of the detectors involved.

In particular, the statistics of the <b>operating</b> <b>noise</b> is checked against its simple model and the compliance to the expected shape of the candidates for burst gravitational wave events is assessed by means of a χ 2 test. This approach helps in reducing the false alarm rate of each operating detector and moreover ensures the correctness of the estimated parameters of the candidate events...|$|E
