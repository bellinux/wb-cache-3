5|$|PA 997 was {{designated}} in 1928 between Mont Alto and US 30 in Fayetteville along Mont Alto Road. The same year, the present route between the Maryland border and Waynesboro {{became part of}} PA 316 while the section between Lurgan and Roxbury became part of PA 433. PA 333 {{was designated}} in 1928 to run from US 30 in Chambersburg northeast to US 11 in Shippensburg, heading north to Pleasant Hall, west to Upper Strasburg, northeast to Roxbury, east to Newburg, and south to Shippensburg. By 1930, PA 997 was extended south from Mont Alto to PA 16 in Waynesboro, while PA 333 was moved to a more direct alignment between Pleasant Hall and Roxbury (running concurrent with PA 433 between Lurgan and Roxbury) and PA 996 was designated <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> between Scotland and Green Village. In 1937, PA 997 was extended south to MD 60 at the Maryland border south of Waynesboro and northwest to US 11 in Green Village, replacing PA 996 between Scotland and Green Village, while {{the north end of}} PA 333 was cut back to PA 433 in Lurgan and PA 944 was designated <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> between Roxbury and McCrea. PA 997 swapped alignments with PA 316 south of Waynesboro in 1941, being rerouted to end at MD 64 at the Maryland border. PA 333 was rerouted to head southeast from Pleasant Hall to PA 433 in Culbertson in the 1940s, with a section of the former alignment south of Pleasant Hall removed for the Letterkenny Army Depot. PA 997 was extended north from Green Village to PA 233 in McCrea, replacing the entire length of PA 333, PA 433 between Lurgan and Roxbury, and PA 944 between Roxbury and McCrea. The route was shifted east to its current alignment between Mont Alto and north of Fayetteville in 1977.|$|E
5|$|The {{tensions}} between Stretford and the Estates Company {{began to come}} to a head in 1906, when in response to complaints in the press about the state of one particular road in the park, Trafford Park Road, Stretford issued formal notices demanding that all premises with frontage <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> pay for its improvement. Further disputes over the standard of roads in the park followed until, in 1907, the Estates Company presented a petition to Lancashire County Council demanding that Trafford Park should be an urban district in its own right, independent of Stretford. The county council dismissed the petition, but later that year, following a petition organised by the Trafford Park Ratepayers Association, a new local government ward, Park Ward, was created within Stretford, The new ward did not include {{the western part of the}} park however, which remained under the control of Barton-upon-Irwell.|$|E

5|$|By 1999, {{computer}} systems and software had finally become sophisticated {{enough to allow}} for the ability to underlay on the same workstation satellite imagery, radar imagery, and model-derived fields such as atmospheric thickness and frontogenesis in combination with surface observations to make for the best possible surface analysis. In the United States, this development was achieved when Intergraph workstations were replaced by n-AWIPS workstations. By 2001, the various surface analyses done within the National Weather Service were combined into the Unified Surface Analysis, which is issued every six hours and combines the analyses of four different centers. Recent advances in both the fields of meteorology and geographic information systems have made it possible to devise finely tailored products that take us from the traditional weather map into an entirely new realm. Weather information can quickly be matched to relevant geographical detail. For instance, icing conditions can be mapped <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> network. This will likely continue to lead to changes in the way surface analyses are created and displayed over the next several years.|$|E
5|$|Caracciola {{was lucky}} to escape from a crash in the Masaryk Grand Prix. He and Chiron were chasing Fagioli when Fagioli crashed into a wooden footbridge, {{bringing}} it crashing down <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> Caracciola and Chiron drove into a ditch {{at the side of}} the road to avoid the debris; while Chiron drove out of the ditch and was able to continue, Caracciola drove into a tree and retired. Despite this accident, Caracciola again performed strongly in the Hillclimbing Championship; he won eight climbs in his SSKL to take the title. Perhaps his most significant achievement of 1931 was his win in the Mille Miglia. The local fleet of Alfa Romeos battled for the lead early in the race, but when they fell back Caracciola was able to take control. His win, in record time, made him and his co-driver Wilhelm Sebastian (who allowed Caracciola to drive the entire race) the first foreigners to win the Italian race. The only other foreigners to win the race on the full course were Stirling Moss and Denis Jenkinson in 1955.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, PA 997 was {{extended}} south from Waynesboro to MD 60 at the Maryland border, following Potomac Street and Wayne Highway, and {{was extended}} northwest from Fayetteville to US 11 in Green Village, following Mont Alto Road, Main Street and Mount Pleasant Road before picking up its current alignment. PA 997 replaced the PA 996 designation between Scotland and Green Village. In addition, {{the north end}} of PA 333 was cut back to PA 433 near Lurgan, with PA 641 replacing the route between Roxbury and Newburg and PA 696 replacing the route between Newburg and Shippensburg, and an extended PA 944 was designated <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> between Roxbury and McCrea. In the 1930s, the entire length of both PA 333 and PA 997 were paved along with PA 433 between Lurgan and Roxbury, PA 944 between Roxbury and McCrea, and the unnumbered road between Mont Alto and north of Fayetteville via Black Gap. In 1941, PA 997 switched alignments with PA 316 south of Waynesboro, with PA 997 rerouted to head south along Clayton Avenue, State Hill road, and Anthony Highway to MD 64 at the Maryland border. In the 1940s, PA 333 was rerouted to head southeast from Pleasant Hall to PA 433 in Culbertson along a new paved road, with a section of the former route between Beautiful and Pleasant Hall removed for the Letterkenny Army Depot. In 1964, PA 997 was extended north from Green Village to PA 233 in McCrea, replacing the entire length of PA 333 between Culbertson and Lurgan, the section of PA 433 between Lurgan and Roxbury, and the section of PA 944 between Roxbury and McCrea. In the 1960s, PA 997 was rerouted to bypass Scotland to the northeast, with the former alignment now unnumbered Main Street. In 1977, PA 997 was moved off its alignment on Mont Alto Road, Main Street and Mount Pleasant Road and shifted east onto its current route via Black Gap.|$|E

25|$|McIntosh {{had planned}} to envelop Sigel's force from the {{northwest}} while Gates closed the trap on the south. However, McIntosh mistakenly took his 3,000-man cavalry brigade too far up a northerly road. After marching three miles out of his way, he turned his troopers <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> leading east into the Little Sugar Creek valley. By {{the time they reached}} the site where Sigel's northeast road met McIntosh's east-bound road, the Federal general's men had already passed the intersection thus avoiding a disaster.

25|$|In {{another example}} of the fierce, close fighting, a single soldier was {{responsible}} for disabling several tanks during a 24-hour period. On the evening of 17 December in nearby Rocherath, Pfc William A. Soderman of Company K, 9th Infantry, 2nd Infantry Division, heard enemy tanks approaching his position in the early evening. Armed with a bazooka, he waited until five Panthers were within pointblank range. He stood up in the road and fired a rocket into the lead tank, setting it on fire. The other tanks passed him by, but the next morning he repeated his actions. When five more German tanks approached, he jumped <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> in front of the tanks and disabled the lead tank. The remaining tanks were unable to bypass the lead tank and withdrew. Soderman was severely wounded and received the Medal of Honor for his actions.|$|E
