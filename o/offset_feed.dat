40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} implementing a low in-band scattering design for microstrip patch antennas based on the analysis of structural mode scattering and radiation characteristics. The antenna structure is first designed to have the lowest structural mode scattering in a desired frequency band. The operating frequency band of the antenna is then changed to coincide {{with that of the}} lowest structural mode scattering by adjusting the feed position on the antenna (<b>offset</b> <b>feeding)</b> to achieve an antenna with low in-band radar cross section (RCS). In order to reduce the level of cross polarization of the antenna caused by <b>offset</b> <b>feeding,</b> symmetry feeding structures for both single patch antennas and two-patch arrays are proposed.

40|$|Abstract—A compact printed {{dipole antenna}} with wide {{impedance}} bandwidth is proposed in this paper. This antenna {{consists of a}} pair of radiation metal arms and a microstrip-to-slotline transition structure. At the end of the feeding slotted line, a beveled slot with stepped connection structure is designed to realize an <b>offset</b> <b>feeding</b> structure for feeding the dipole antenna. By using the beveled <b>offset</b> <b>feeding</b> structure, the bandwidth of the dipole antenna is significantly improved. The microstrip-to-slotline transition is used as an integrated balun to realize a balanced feeding for the dipole antenna. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design, a prototype of the designed antenna is fabricated and measured. The measured results show that the designed dipole antenna achieves a gain of 2. 2 – 4. 4 dBi across a wide impedance bandwidth from 2. 65 GHz to 17. 5 GHz with a compact size (33 mm × 16 mm). The performance of the proposed dipole antenna is also compared with some similar printed dipole antennas with respect to overall size, substrate dielectric constant, impedance bandwidth and antenna gain. 1...|$|R

The Ku-band pencil beam scatterometer {{is an active}} microwave radar operating at 13.515 GHz providing a ground resolution cell of size 50 x 50 km. It consists of a parabolic dish antenna of 1 meter diameter which is offset mounted with a cant angle of about 46 degree with respect to earth viewing axis. This antenna is continuously rotated at 20.5 rpm using a scan mechanism with the scan axis along the +ve Yaw axis. By using two <b>offset</b> <b>feeds</b> at the focal plane of the antenna, two beams are generated which will conically scan the ground surface. The back scattered power in each beam from the ocean surface is measured to derive wind vector. It is an improved version of the one on Oceansat-1.

It covers a continuous swath of 1400 km for inner beam and 1840 km for outer beam respectively. The inner and outer beams are configured in horizontal and vertical polarization respectively for both transmit and receive modes.

40|$|In {{choosing}} an antenna topology for ultra wideband (UWB) design, several factors {{must be taken}} into account including physical profile, compatibility, impedance bandwidth, radiation efficiency, and radiation pattern. The main challenge in UWB antenna design is achieving the very broad bandwidth with high radiation efficiency and small in size. Accordingly, many techniques to broaden the impedance bandwidth of small antennas and to optimize the characteristics of broadband antennas have been widely investigated in many published papers as listed in references. Some examples of the techniques used to improve the impedance bandwidth of the planar monopole antenna include the use of beveling technique (Z. N. Chen(a) et al., 2006), (Giuseppe R. & Max J. Ammann, 2006), (M. C. Fabres(a) et al., 2005), semi-circular base (X. N. Qiu et al., 2005), cutting notches at bottom (Seok H. Choi, et al., 2004), (H. Ghannoum et al., 2006), an <b>offset</b> <b>feeding</b> (Z. N. Chen(a) et al., 2006), (Giuseppe R. & Max J. Ammann, 2006), (M. J. Ammann & Z. N. Chen, 2004), a shorting pin (Z. N. Chen(a) et al., 2006), (E. Lee et al., 1999), and a dual/triple feed (Z. N. Chen(a) et al., 2006), (S. Boris et al., 2005), (K. L. Wong et al., 2005), (H. Ghannoum et al., 2006), (E. Antonio-Daviu et al., 2003), magnetic coupling (N. Behdad & K. Sarabandi, 2005), folded-plate (D. Valderas et al., 2006),(Z. N. Chen et al., 2003), hidden stripline feed (E. Gueguen et al., 2005). The radiators may be slotted to improve the impedance matching, especially at higher frequency(Z. N. Chen(a) et al., 2006),(Z. N. Chen(b) et al., 2006). Planar monopole antennas are good candidates owing to their wide impedance bandwidth, omnidirectional radiation pattern, compact and simple structure, low cost and ease of construction.
