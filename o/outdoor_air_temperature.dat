Hence, climate change is threatening human well-being and health. People spend the majority of their time indoors. Therefore, indoor temperatures (especially during the night) are of special importance with respect to well-being and health. Indoor <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> depends on <b>outdoor</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperatures,</b> but is for example modified by type of urban structure, housing area, and may be also influenced by differences in the behavior of the inhabitants.

Hence, the questions arise how types of urban structures are related to inner-urban temperature differences and how <b>outdoor</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperatures</b> influence indoor temperatures in dependence on urban housing conditions. This work is a part of a pilot study conducted during the summer 2010 which gathered data from remote sensing, mobile measurements, stationary measurements of <b>air</b> <b>temperatures</b> and relative humidity in areas with different housing structures, and of indoor as well as outdoor temperatures in occupied apartments. Household-survey data reported the subjective perception of heat stress.

40|$|The {{combined}} {{effects of}} urban heat island (UHI), urban {{population growth and}} energy overexploitation are undermining the safety of urban areas. Urban morphology plays {{a prominent role in}} this context, because it affects building’s energy demand and local climate at urban scale. However, this contribution is recurrently neglected. The present contribution seeks to investigate the direct and indirect effect of urban morphology on buildings energy performance in the Mediterranean climate. Urban morphology affects energy demand by modifying two relevant variables: <b>outdoor</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperatures</b> and incident radiation. The relevance of these effects were studied on a sample of urban textures of Rome and Barcelona. The study is parametric in approach. The textures were modelled and parameterized and their performances were compared. The UHI in different urban textures was calculated, by Urban Weather Generator tool. Then a sensitivity analysis of the building energy demand to the <b>outdoor</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperatures</b> and the incoming solar radiation was carried out, by EnergyPlus engine. Results confirm the relevance of urban morphology to the UHI intensity. Warmer temperatures lead to an average increase of energy demand from 10 % to 35 %, according to different urban densities. At the same time, the incident radiation reduction due to urban obstruction is desirable in Mediterranean climate; it allows a reduction of annual energy demand up to the 19 % compared to an unobstructed environment. Therefore, relevant errors may occur if urban morphology’s contribution to energy demand is neglected, approximately 89 % for space heating and 131 % for space cooling calculations, depending on the texture density and the building orientation...|$|R

50|$|The {{concepts}} of degree days and balance point temperature are interconnected. By summing {{the differences between}} the balance point temperature and the outdoor temperature over a period of time, the resultant value is degree-time. Use of daily mean temperature data in the summation results in degree days, although degree hours or even degree minutes may be possible depending upon the granularity of the data used. The degree day is often further broken down into heating degree days (HDD), in which energy will need to be spent to heat the space, and cooling degree days (CDD), in which the space will need cooling (either through an input of energy or by natural means). This is achieved by counting any positive difference between the balance point temperature and the <b>outdoor</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> as HDD, and either discarding the remaining data or considering them to be CDD. Although degree days are calculated based on recorded energy use in the building, the balance point temperature of the building determines whether a building will annually have more HDD or CDD. A low balance point temperature (relative to the local climate) indicates that the building {{will be more likely to}} need additional cooling, while a high balance point temperature indicates that it is more likely to need heating. Ideally, a building should be designed such that the balance point temperature is as near as possible to the average outdoor temperature of the local climate, which will minimize both the CDD and HDD.|$|E

5000|$|Night {{flushing}} (also {{known as}} night ventilation, night cooling, night purging, or nocturnal convective cooling) is a passive or semi-passive cooling strategy that requires increased air movement {{at night to}} cool the structural elements of a building. Unlike free cooling, which assists in chilling water, night flushing cools down the thermal mass. To execute night flushing, the building envelope typically stays closed during the day, causing excess heat gains to be stored in the building's thermal mass. The building structure acts as a sink through the day and absorbs heat gains from occupants, equipment, solar radiation, and conduction through walls, roofs, and ceilings. At night, when the outside air is cooler and not too humid, the envelope is opened, allowing cooler air {{to pass through the}} building so the stored heat can be dissipated by convection. This process reduces the temperature of the indoor air and of the building's thermal mass, allowing convective, conductive, and radiant cooling to take place during the day when the building is occupied. Night flushing is most effective in climates with a large diurnal swing, i.e. a large difference between the daily maximum and minimum outdoor temperature. For optimal performance, the nighttime <b>outdoor</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> should fall below the daytime comfort zone limits of 22 C and 60% relative humidity. For the night flushing strategy to be effective at reducing indoor temperature and energy usage, the thermal mass must be sized sufficiently and distributed over a wide enough surface area to absorb the space's daily heat gains. Also, the total air change rate must be high enough to remove the internal heat gains from the space at night.There are three ways night flushing can be achieved in a building: ...|$|E

According to Fig.  6 a, the results of the weighted linear regression analysis in Type WM indicated that IR was 100  % when the daily mean <b>outdoor</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> was 15  °C.
