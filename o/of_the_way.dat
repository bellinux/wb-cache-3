5|$|The {{main event}} was the tag team match between John Cena and Batista versus {{the team of}} King Booker and Finlay. Batista {{wrestled}} the match with his left arm taped up due to a previous injury. Both teams wrestlers inconclusively until Cena applied the STFU on Booker. Finlay broke the submission hold, and The Little Bastard ran into the ring. Little Bastard attempted to kick Cena, but accidentally kicked himself in his head when Cena moved out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way.</b> Then, Booker tried to superkick Batista, but Batista moved out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> and Booker accidentally hit Finlay. Batista then delivered a Batista Bomb and pinned Booker to earn the victory for his team.|$|E

5|$|A similar {{play in the}} game's {{second half}} scored another {{touchdown}}. Quarterback Doc Kuhn dropped back for a more than 40-yard touchdown pass to Bomar. The pass went 28 yards in the air, with Bomar running the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way.</b> Georgia running back Dave Collings tackled him {{as he crossed the}} goal line (injuring himself), and Bomar also made an interception in the 12–0 Vanderbilt victory. The season's final game, against Vanderbilt's oldest rival Sewanee, had a trick play by the Commodores. A fake run ended with Kuhn tossing the ball to Bomar, who was left open behind the defense and easily ran it in; Vanderbilt won, 26–0.|$|E

5|$|After Hōshō was commissioned, {{experienced}} aircrews requested changes, and {{the ship}} was modified by the Yokosuka Navy Arsenal from 6 June to 20 August 1924. The island, tripod mast, and aircraft crane were removed since they partially obstructed the flight deck and obscured pilot visibility. The forward part of the flight deck was made horizontal, and the 8cm AA guns were moved forward, close {{to the position of}} the former island and out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> of landing operations. After the island was removed, the carrier's flight operations were controlled from a platform extending {{from the side of the}} flight deck, a design that would be repeated in subsequent Japanese aircraft carriers. The ship was then assigned to the 1st Fleet until 15 November 1924.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving the}} main line {{immediately}} south of Hellingly, the railway passed over gated level crossings at Park Road and New Road. Farm Siding, a single siding on {{the west of the}} line beyond the crossings, was a collection point for the farm's agricultural produce {{in the early years of}} the railway, but later fell out of use. The line climbed most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> from here to the hospital at 1 in 50. About halfway between Hellingly and the hospital the line entered the hospital grounds, passing to the west of Park House Siding, which served the hospital's Park House annexe.|$|E
5|$|All {{observation}} involves both {{perception and}} cognition. That is, {{one does not}} make an observation passively, but rather is actively engaged in distinguishing the phenomenon being observed from surrounding sensory data. Therefore, observations are affected by one's underlying understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> in which the world functions, and that understanding may influence what is perceived, noticed, or deemed worthy of consideration. In this sense, {{it can be argued}} that all observation is theory-laden.|$|E

5|$|Along a highway, {{the group}} is forced to stop {{as a number of}} {{abandoned}} cars litter the road, making it impossible to pass; further, Dale (Jeffrey DeMunn) must stop to fix his RV. As the others push cars out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> and scavenge for supplies, a horde of walkers appear behind them. The group take shelter under cars to avoid conflict, though in his haste, T-Dog (IronE Singleton) severely cuts his arm. Some walkers spot Sophia (Madison Lintz), daughter of Carol Peletier (Melissa McBride), hiding under a car, and she flees into the nearby forest. Rick follows her and tells her to find someplace safe to hide while he dispatches the walkers.|$|E
