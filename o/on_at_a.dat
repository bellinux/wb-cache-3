5|$|FITs {{were first}} {{formed in the}} early 1990s, {{as part of the}} Public Order Intelligence Unit (CO11), a section of the Public Order Branch of the Metropolitan Police. They {{initially}} targeted football fans, hunt saboteurs and political protesters (since at least 1996), using cameras, camcorders and audio recorders to conduct overt surveillance of the public. The police officers wear full uniform, and are intended to be a highly visible presence. Their uniform is sometimes different from normal police officers in that the upper half of their yellow fluorescent jackets is blue. Civilian photographers are also employed by the police to work alongside FITs. According to Scotland Yard, the aim of FIT teams at protests is to record evidence of protesters in case disorder occurs later <b>on</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> protest.|$|E
5|$|Rachel crashes her {{car into}} Adam's on a {{supermarket}} car park. After a brief argument Adam suggests they exchange phone numbers, under the pretence {{that it is}} for insurance purposes. She writes hers on his rear windscreen but rain washes it off. Prompted by Pete, Adam spends {{a day on the}} supermarket car park, in the hope that he and Rachel will cross paths, but they do not meet. At a dinner party held by Karen and David, Karen suggests Rachel get out more and advises her to call Adam. They go on a date but Adam is disappointed that Rachel does not want sex. Eventually, he suggests they see a play, which happens to be <b>on</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> theatre near his house. The play is dismal but Rachel decides it is time they slept together. Jenny takes another pregnancy test, but it is negative. Adam arrives and recounts his dates with Rachel to her and Pete, telling them he loves Rachel.|$|E

25|$|At {{a meeting}} of the Jockey Club in 1882, Byng's father was asked about his sons by his long-time friend, Albert Edward, Prince of Wales. Upon hearing that Byng had not yet found a {{permanent}} career, the Prince offered a place for him in his own regiment, the 10th Royal Hussars. This was the most expensive regiment in the army, and the Earl of Strafford could only afford to give Byng two hundred of the six hundred pounds he would need each year, but the Prince's offer could not be refused. Byng himself was delighted at the opportunity, as both his uncle, Lord Chesham, and his cousin, Charles Cavendish, had served in the regiment. By raising money through buying polo ponies cheaply, using his excellent horsemanship to train them, and then selling them <b>on</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> profit, Byng was able to transfer to the 10th Royal Hussars on 27 January 1883, and less than three months later he joined the regiment in Lucknow, India.|$|E
25|$|Vast {{areas of}} {{farmland}} in the Sacramento Valley were deeply buried by the mining sediment. Frequently devastated by flood waters, farmers demanded {{an end to}} hydraulic mining. In the most renowned legal fight of farmers against miners, the farmers sued the hydraulic mining operations and the landmark case of Edwards Woodruff v. North Bloomfield Mining and Gravel Company {{made its way to}} the United States District Court in San Francisco where Judge Lorenzo Sawyer decided in favor of the farmers and banned hydraulic mining on January 7, 1884, declaring that hydraulic mining was “a public and private nuisance” and enjoining its operation in areas tributary to navigable streams and rivers. Hydraulic mining on a much smaller scale was recommenced after 1893 when the United States Congress passed the Camminetti Act which allowed such mining if sediment detention structures were constructed. This led to a number of operations above sediment catching brush dams and log crib dams. Most of the water-delivery hydraulic mining infrastructure had been destroyed by an 1891 flood, so this later stage of mining was carried <b>on</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> much smaller scale in California.|$|E

500|$|Adrien Begrand of PopMatters {{dismissed}} the original recording, but praised the re-release, writing that the album [...] "blazes <b>on</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> furious pace". According to him, the record greatly influenced the heavy metal genre {{in the upcoming}} two decades. Sputnikmusic staff member Mike Stagno agreed with the praise for the remaster, saying that the [...] "fuzzy" [...] sound of the original release was replaced with a clearer production. Even so, he opined that the album still retained the [...] "thrashy" [...] sound characteristic for the band during this period. Mike Marsh of Drowned in Sound recommended the music [...] "for people who want it loud, fast and brutal". In a retrospective review for KNAC, Frank Meyer said that the album put Megadeth {{at the forefront of}} heavy metal scene in the early 1980s and credited it for paving the way for thrash metal's arrival. CMJ New Music Report praised Mustaine's [...] "masterful" [...] wordplay and called the record a representative of [...] "the golden age of speed metal".|$|E
500|$|Critics lauded the cast's acting, {{specifically}} Isaacs' performance. VanDerWerff {{concluded that}} the cast's performances were [...] "delicate and almost perfect", while Wagner felt that Isaacs was well-suited to the lead role and could easily captivate the audience; [...] "his touching, solid work grounds everything. He shows viewers what lengths one man in pain might go to hold onto those he loves. And it's heartbreaking." [...] Denise Duguay of the Montreal Gazette thought that Isaacs evoked a [...] "reservedness" [...] and ambiguity that attracted viewers to his character. Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter echoed analogous sentiment, writing, [...] "He perfectly conveys a man struggling with two horrible options." [...] Poniewozik iterated: [...] "Isaacs is utterly compelling: mature, soulful and wearied. Literally, he never gets a rest, and must deal in one reality with a son acting out from rage, in other other with a spouse who is moving <b>on</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> different pace, and in different ways, from him." [...] Although Stuever opined that Isaacs failed to engage the audience, he praised the performances of Wong and Jones; [...] "Jones and Wong [...] are excellent and even vaguely sinister as the dueling shrinks." ...|$|E
500|$|The game {{begins and}} Stanley {{proves to be}} a horrible player. Furthermore, Michael cannot make a shot, nor is he a fan of passing or defending. Upon gaining {{possession}} of the ball, Michael fools around and intentionally acts stupid to tease the opponents, which results in Roy Anderson (David Denman) snatching the ball and scoring against Michael's team. Despite the fact that Michael {{is the one who}} foolishly lost the ball, he blames the scoring on his teammates' ineptitude. Jim switches with Michael on defense and defends Roy. As Jim begins to show his prowess at the game, Roy and Jim gradually become aggressive toward each other, with Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) looking <b>on.</b> <b>At</b> <b>a</b> crucial point in the game, Michael is accidentally hit in the face and claims it is a [...] "flagrant personal intentional foul". He pettily stops the game and declares the office winners since they were winning when the foul occurred. The warehouse finds the call unfair and Michael caves under pressure, conceding the victory to the warehouse staff. As everybody returns to work, Kevin demonstrates his excellent shooting skills.|$|E

500|$|Over {{the course}} of Love and Rockets, the Hernandez {{brothers}} made increasing using of what Joseph Witek calls [...] "uncued closure": frequent use of abrupt ellipsis to pack large amounts of narrative into {{a small number of}} panels, relying on readers to fill in the gaps. [...] In Poison River the gaps between panels, which readers normally processed unconsciously, come to the forefront in a slow, staccato rhythm. [...] Panels are crowded with abundant dialogue, stretching out their perceived duration in time, while transitions from one panel to another are sudden—as are transitions from scene to scene, which can happen several times per page. [...] Hernandez limits the narrative only to important details, showing rapid growth in his characters and situations in limited space, rather than relating the story in a traditional step-by-step manner. [...] He compresses great a great deal of action into a minimum of panels, as in a two panel sequence which critic Jordan Raphael says [...] "delineates both the entirety (action and consequences) of a shootout between rival gangs even as [...] reveals each character's guiding motivation". [...] The narrative's chronology is fluid, with frequent jumps in time, such as an uncued 16-page flashback sequence. [...] Hernandez avoids using captions, leaving such jumps to the reader to sort out. [...] The copious, compact dialogue gives the reader an impression of what is going <b>on</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> given moment, but filtered through the speaker.|$|E
