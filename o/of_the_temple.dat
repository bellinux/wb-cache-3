5|$|The wall {{surrounding}} the temple was formerly {{part of a}} city wall that surrounded Quyang. The south gate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>temple</b> once served {{as one of the}} main gates for the town. Apart from the remnant that is part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>temple,</b> nothing more survives of this wall. The temple grounds are also home to over 137 stelae, dating from the Northern Wei Dynasty to the Qing Dynasty.|$|E
5|$|There is {{a series}} of Arabic {{graffiti}} on the walls <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>temple,</b> dated 9th-10th centuries.|$|E
5|$|A {{distinct}} feature {{noted in}} the entire temple complex is the stucco style embellishments built with brick masonry and finished with plaster. The motifs crafted are of floral (lotuses) and geometric designs, on the walls, in the niches and on arches. Apart from paintings on the walls, the niches in the interior parts of the shrines have 300 well crafted images of deities. The profusion of paintings and images on {{the internal and external}} faces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>temple</b> was considered an auspicious feature, instead of leaving the wall surfaces blank. However, the images and murals on the outer walls <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>temple</b> have since been demolished.|$|E
50|$|Jyothirlinga Group, at a short {{distance}} to <b>the</b> southwest <b>of</b> Ravalaphadi, is <b>the</b> group <b>of</b> <b>temples</b> called Jothirlinga group. Two small temples here are flat roofed {{and in front of}} them are Nandimantapas. <b>The</b> remaining <b>temples</b> have a sanctum, shukanasa and a front hall in each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>temples.</b> Two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>temples</b> have Kadambanagara towers. Two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>temples</b> have inscriptions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kalyana Chalukya period. <b>The</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>temples</b> now dilapidated are <b>of</b> about <b>the</b> 8th to 10th centuries.|$|R
50|$|Virvah Jain mandir, are {{a number}} of ruins of Jain <b>temples</b> here. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>temples</b> had 27 devakulikas in it. <b>The</b> ruins <b>of</b> legendary Parinagar are nearby. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>temples</b> is in good preservation.|$|R
50|$|The {{plan and}} design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Adinatha <b>temple</b> {{is similar to}} that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Vamana <b>temple.</b> There are only a few {{differences}} between <b>the</b> two <b>temples.</b> For example, <b>the</b> top row <b>of</b> <b>the</b> outer wall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Adinatha <b>temple</b> depicts a flying vidyadhara, while that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Vamana <b>temple</b> shows diamond-shaped decorations. <b>The</b> curvilinear tower <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Adinatha <b>temple</b> is <b>of</b> better proportions than that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Vamana <b>temple.</b> This, combined with a somewhat more evolved sculptural style, suggests that <b>the</b> Adinatha <b>temple</b> was constructed after <b>the</b> Vamana <b>temple.</b>|$|R
5|$|A {{large number}} of 'inscription stones' {{collected}} by King Bodawpaya are {{seen in a long}} gallery in the southeastern corner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>temple</b> courtyard. These inscriptions, some of which are made from gilded marble and sandstone, have been collected from many regions of the country. There is also a large water tank in the southeast direction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>temple</b> where fish and turtles are fed with rice cakes by the {{large number of}} pilgrims who visit the temple every day. Adjacent to the Buddha temple is the Mahamuni Museum, which contains displays of Buddhism throughout Asia.|$|E
5|$|A temple {{dedicated}} to the goddess Satet, personification of the Nile floods, had stood {{on the island of}} Elephantine to the south of Egypt since at least the late Predynastic Period around 3200 BC. The temple was enlarged and renovated several times from the Early Dynastic Period onwards and was again rebuilt {{in the course of the}} Fifth Dynasty, possibly during Nyuserre's reign. A faience plaque bearing Nyuserre's name was discovered in a deposit of votive offerings located under the floor of the sanctuary. Unfortunately, this deposit does not represent the original context of the plaque, which could have once adorned the walls <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>temple</b> or could equally have been deposed in a foundational offering made in anticipation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>temple</b> reconstruction.|$|E

5|$|Angkor Wat, {{located at}} , {{is a unique}} {{combination}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>temple</b> mountain (the standard design for the empire's state temples) and the later plan of concentric galleries. The temple is a representation of Mount Meru, {{the home of the}} gods: the central quincunx of towers symbolises the five peaks of the mountain, and the walls and moat symbolise the surrounding mountain ranges and ocean. Access to the upper areas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>temple</b> was progressively more exclusive, with the laity being admitted only to the lowest level.|$|E
5|$|As {{indicated}} in the temple records, the priests <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>temple</b> were Shiva ascetics called Dandi Sanyasis, who belonged to Nambudiri community, a religious group common in modern Kerala. When {{the last of the}} ascetics died without an heir in 1776 AD, the king invited non-ascetic Nambudiris from Kerala for priesthood, a practice that continues in modern times. Till 1939, all the offerings made by the devotees to the temple went to the Rawal (chief priest), but after 1939, his jurisdiction was restricted to religious affairs. The administrative structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>temple</b> consists of a chief executive officer who executes the orders from the state government, a deputy chief executive officer, two OSDs, an executive officer, an account officer, a temple officer and a publicity officer to assist the chief executive officer.|$|E
5|$|Birket Israel (trans. Pool of Israel) also Birket Israil or Birket Isra'in, {{abbreviated}} from Birket Asbât Beni Israìl (trans.

5|$|Robinson's Arch is {{the name}} given to a monumental {{staircase}} carried by an unusually wide stone arch, which once stood at the southwestern corner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Temple</b> Mount. It was built {{as part of the}} expansion of the Second Temple initiated by Herod the Great {{at the end of the}} 1st century BCE. Recent findings suggest that it may not have been completed until at least 20 years after his death. The massive stone span was constructed along with the retaining walls <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Temple</b> Mount. It carried traffic up from ancient Jerusalem's Lower Market area and over the Tyropoeon street to the Royal Stoa complex on the esplanade of the Mount. The overpass was destroyed during the Great Jewish Revolt, only a few decades after its completion.|$|E

5|$|Scholastic {{investigation}} of Vithoba's history often begins with {{consideration of the}} dating of the chief temple at Pandharpur, which {{is believed to be}} the earliest Vithoba temple. The oldest part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>temple</b> dates to the Yadava period of the 12th and 13thcenturies. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>temple</b> is believed to have been built in the 17thcentury, though addition to the temple has never ceased. The date the temple was first established is unclear to Bhandarkar, but he insists there is clear evidence to suggest it existed by the 13thcentury. According to S. G. Tulpule, the temple stood as early as 1189. In fact, a monument dated 1189 records establishment of a small Vithoba shrine at the present location of the temple; thus, Tulpule concludes, the worship of Vithoba predates 1189.|$|E
