5|$|We {{all have}} a Land of Beyond to seek in our life—what more can we ask? Our part {{is to find the}} trail that leads to it. A long trail, a hard trail, maybe; but the call comes to us, and we have to go. Rooted deep in the nature of every one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>is</b> the spirit of adventure, the call of the wild—vibrating under all our actions, making life deeper and higher and nobler.|$|E

5|$|The Last <b>of</b> <b>Us</b> <b>is</b> an action-adventure {{survival}} horror {{game played}} from a third-person perspective. Players traverse post-apocalyptic environments such as towns, buildings, forest and sewers {{to advance the}} story. Players use firearms, improvised weapons, and stealth to defend against hostile humans and cannibalistic creatures infected by a mutated strain of the Cordyceps fungus. For most of the game, players control Joel, a man tasked with escorting a young girl, Ellie, across the United States; Ellie and other companions are controlled by the artificial intelligence. Players also control Ellie throughout the game's winter segment.|$|E
5|$|The Last <b>of</b> <b>Us</b> <b>is</b> an action-adventure {{survival}} horror {{video game}} developed by Naughty Dog {{and published by}} Sony Computer Entertainment.

The game's development was led by Bruce Straley and Neil Druckmann, as game director and creative director, respectively.

It was awarded Most Anticipated Game from PlayStation Universe and Cheat Code Central, receiving a nomination at the 2012 Spike Video Game Awards.|$|E
5|$|The {{only reason}} the Nazis put on {{prisoner}} broadcasts {{is to get}} people justifiably anxious about relatives reported missing at the front {{to listen to their}} propaganda. Although many of the messages undoubtedly are true, they represent but a small fraction of our prisoners and we have no assurance that many of them are not faked from papers picked up on the battlefield. What concerns some <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>is</b> the consequences of listening to Nazi broadcasts unless you are a well-trained listener (and often, even if you are). Nazi arguments often sound plausible. A person may listen to them with all the skepticism in the world, knowing that every word is a lie. But if the content is sufficiently sensational (and it often is) the source may be forgotten in time, and out pops the Nazi lie, all unsuspecting.|$|E

25|$|A famous puzzle {{in human}} {{genetics}} is the genetic ability to taste phenylthiocarbamide (phenylthiourea or PTC), a morphism which {{was discovered in}} 1931. This substance, which to some <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>is</b> bitter, and to others tasteless, is of no great significance in itself, yet it is a genetic dimorphism. Because of its high frequency (which varies in different ethnic groups) it must be connected to some function of selective value. The ability to taste PTC itself is correlated {{with the ability to}} taste other bitter substances, many of which are toxic. Indeed, PTC itself is toxic, though not at the level of tasting it on litmus. Variation in PTC perception may reflect variation in dietary preferences throughout human evolution, and might correlate with susceptibility to diet-related diseases in modern populations. There is a statistical correlation between PTC tasting and liability to thyroid disease.|$|E
25|$|Time is {{a natural}} force from which none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>is</b> immune. This theme pervades the sonnet; the speaker recognizes that time will strip the beloved of his beauty and by saying that implies that time will take his beloved from him. Eventually, time will consume {{everyone}} in death, and, whether one chooses to recognize it or not, he will not have any control over exactly when that consumption will take place. This theme translates to Julius Caesar as well. Caesar is unfazed by the soothsayer's proclamation in act one, and even though Calpurnia seems for a time to have succeeded in keeping Caesar home {{on the day of}} his eventual murder, he goes to Senate anyway. Caesar walks into his own death, much less literally than Brutus, who does actually walk into the sword that kills him. But in these deaths {{in the context of the}} play serve to elucidate the truth that death (or 'Time', as the sonnet refers to it) will consume you regardless of your ambitions or future plans; it does not take you into consideration. Obviously, Caesar would not have gone to Senate if he knew he would be stabbed upon entering, just as Brutus and Cassius would not have engaged in a full-blown war if they knew they would be dead before it was over.|$|E

500|$|For {{decades the}} Roman Catholic Church avoided {{official}} refutation of evolution. However, it would rein in Catholics who proposed that evolution could {{be reconciled with}} the Bible, as this conflicted with the First Vatican Council's (1869–70) finding that everything was created out of nothing by God, and to deny that finding could lead to excommunication. In 1950, the encyclical Humani generis of Pope Pius XII first mentioned evolution directly and officially. It allowed one to enquire into the concept of humans coming from pre-existing living matter, but not to question Adam and Eve or {{the creation of the}} soul. In 1996, Pope John Paul II said that evolution is [...] "more than a hypothesis" [...] and acknowledged the large body of work accumulated in its support, but reiterated that any attempt to give a material explanation of the human soul is [...] "incompatible with the truth about man." [...] Pope Benedict XVI has reiterated the conviction that human beings [...] "are not some casual and meaningless product of evolution. Each <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>is</b> the result of a thought of God. Each <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>is</b> willed, each <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>is</b> loved, each <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>is</b> necessary." [...] At the same time, he has promoted the study {{of the relationship between the}} concepts of creation and evolution, based on the conviction that there cannot be a contradiction between faith and reason. Along these lines, the research project Thomistic Evolution, run by a team of Dominican scholars, endeavours to reconcile the scientific evidence on evolution with the teaching of Thomas Aquinas.|$|E
500|$|Almost {{immediately}} after the procession began, mourners engulfed Nasser's coffin chanting, [...] "There is no God but Allah, and Nasser is God's beloved… Each <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>is</b> Nasser." [...] Police unsuccessfully attempted to quell the crowds and, as a result, most of the foreign dignitaries were evacuated. The final destination was the Nasr Mosque, which was afterwards renamed Abdel Nasser Mosque, where Nasser was buried.|$|E
