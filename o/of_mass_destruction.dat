Nayyouf claimed that officers of the Special Republican Guard organized the smuggling in collaboration with relatives of Bashar al-Assad including Dhu al-Himma Shalish and Assif Shoakat, who is also CEO of Bhaha, an import/export company owned by the Assad family. Nayyouf identified sites near the cities of al-Baida, Tell Sinan, and Sjinsjar as alleged holding sites for Iraqi WMDs.|$|E
5|$|In his 2002 State of the Union Address, Bush {{referred}} to an {{axis of evil}} including Iraq, Iran and North Korea. After the September 11 attacks on New York, Bush launched the War on Terror, in which the United States military and a small international coalition invaded Afghanistan. In 2003, Bush then launched the invasion of Iraq, searching for Weapons <b>of</b> <b>Mass</b> <b>Destruction,</b> which he described as {{being part of the}} War on Terrorism. Those invasions led to the toppling of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and the removal of Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq.|$|E

Critics often point to {{his handling of the}} Iraq War, specifically the failure to find weapons <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> <b>destruction,</b> that were the main rationale behind the initial invasion—as well as his handling of tax policy, Hurricane Katrina, climate change and the 2008 financial crisis—as proof that George W.

5|$|This {{meeting was}} between NATO leaders and {{president}} of Ukraine Leonid Kuchma.

50|$|Computer network attacks are, like weapons <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> <b>destructions,</b> {{asymmetric}} in nature. Since infrastructure such {{as power}} grids, transportation, and telecommunications are interlinked, {{an attack on}} one site might have a catastrophic domino effect. The destructive capabilities of cyber-attacks have been compared {{to the effects of}} nuclear radiation and the EMP effect of nuclear blasts. Small countries wanting to have an impact can take advantage of how cheap it is to launch a CNA. Nuclear weapons have also not been outlawed, but along other weapons of warfare, {{there is a need to}} be very careful about using or threatening to use these weapons and follow rules of proportionality, necessity, and humanity. Both nuclear weapons and information weapons do not distinguish between civilians and non-civilians.|$|R

At the same time terror threats for smuggling weapons <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> <b>destructions,</b> or intentionally altering products, are pushing governments to require higher security from logistics and transport operators. As a consequence, supply chain managers {{have to face the}} difficult task of choosing among extensive sets of security solutions to protect their distribution networks. Many and conflicting analyses can be found in available scientific literature. Therefore this paper provides with an overview of available security solutions so as a framework to identify weak spots and related countermeasures in distribution chains. Moreover recommendations for managers and future research are put forward. A combination of methods is adopted: a literature search, a survey to collect security solutions, structured interviews, and collection and classification of the findings...|$|R
5|$|At first, Schwarzkopf was {{ambivalent}} {{during the}} run-up to the Iraq War in 2003.

He was critical of the lack of a reconstruction plan after the fall of Baghdad, feeling the initial offensive operations plans did {{not take into account the}} cultural complexities of Iraq.

Backstory details that {{hundreds}} of thousands of years before the modern era, humans were one of several interstellar civilizations. Following a war with the parasitic Flood, the humans came into conflict with the Forerunners, a powerful race that upheld a policy of benevolent shepherding of other races known as the Mantle of Responsibility. Humanity had begun an aggressive campaign of destroying any Flood infestations on a planet, which was misinterpreted as a desire for conquest. After centuries of war the Forerunners defeated the humans, ancestors of the contemporary human race, and stripped them of their technology and empire. The Forerunners soon fought the Flood themselves; after exhausting every other strategic option available to them, the Forerunners activated weapons <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> <b>destruction</b> known as the Halo Array. The Array's firing killed all sentient life in the galaxy to deprive the Flood of their food. Life that the Forerunners cataloged was then reseeded throughout the galaxy.|$|E

5|$|The {{commission}} is thought by some foreign policy analysts {{to be the}} basis for President George W.
