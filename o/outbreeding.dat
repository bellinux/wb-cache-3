5|$|Darwin's speculations on {{the origin}} of species {{convinced}} him that cross-fertilisation {{played an important role in}} keeping specific forms consistent. He rejected the doctrine that the characteristics of a species were static, and was aware from animal husbandry that inbreeding could lead to changes, often deleterious. He thought that natural <b>outbreeding</b> through cross-fertilisation would keep wild species homogenous yet vigorous. Cross-fertilisation would confer an evolutionary advantage by spreading favourable changes throughout a reproductive community. His ideas were contrary to the common supposition that plants were usually self-fertilising, and so every summer Darwin investigated the contribution of insect pollination to the cross-pollination of flowers.|$|E
25|$|Increasing {{urbanization}} {{changes the}} traditional values placed upon fertility {{and the value}} of children in rural society. Urban living also raises the cost of dependent children to a family. A recent theory suggests that urbanization also contributes to reducing the birth rate because it disrupts optimal mating patterns. A 2008 study in Iceland found that the most fecund marriages are between distant cousins. Genetic incompatibilities inherent in more distant <b>outbreeding</b> makes reproduction harder.|$|E
25|$|The {{existence}} of white Siberian tigers {{has not been}} scientifically documented, despite occasional unsubstantiated reports of sightings of white tigers in the regions where wild Siberian tigers live. It {{may be that the}} white mutation does not exist in the wild Siberian tiger population: no white Siberian tigers have been born in captivity, {{despite the fact that the}} subspecies has been extensively bred during the last few decades (with much <b>outbreeding</b> between the different Siberian lineages for purposes of conservation genetics); a recessive allele should occasionally turn up in a homozygous state during such breeding, and in this particular case yield white tigers from normally-colored parents, but no such animals have been reported.|$|E
25|$|Dating to {{approximately}} the year 1550, <b>outbreeding</b> in Charles II's lineage had ceased (see also pedigree collapse). From then on, all his ancestors were {{in one way}} or another descendants of Joanna and Philip I of Castile, and among these just the royal houses of Spain, Austria and Bavaria. Charles II's genome was actually more homozygous than that of a child whose parents are siblings. He was born physically and mentally disabled, and disfigured. Possibly through affliction with mandibular prognathism, he was barely able to chew. His tongue was so large that his speech could barely be understood, and he frequently drooled. It has been suggested that he suffered from the endocrine disease acromegaly, or his inbred lineage may have led to a combination of rare genetic disorders such as combined pituitary hormone deficiency and distal renal tubular acidosis.|$|E
500|$|Pollinated {{primarily}} by honeyeaters, the inflorescences appear from September to December. Prominent flowers, a red or pink colour, a straight style and a tubular perianth are features thought to promote pollination by birds. The structure of B.cuneatas flower, with the style end {{functioning as a}} pollen presenter, suggests that autogamous self-fertilisation must be common. This is countered, however, by protandry: pollen is released well before the pistil becomes receptive; usually {{by the time the}} pistil becomes receptive most of the pollen has either been transferred, or has lost its viability. This strategy is effective against individual flowers fertilising themselves, but does nothing to prevent geitonogamy: fertilisation of flowers by different flowers on the same plant. Because of the way flowers are clustered together in heads, this must be quite common, although whether it results in successful fruit set is another matter: isozyme studies have observed [...] "intense selection against homozygotes", a fairly common <b>outbreeding</b> strategy in plants that set lots of seed.|$|E

[...] This broad mixing of drones is how a virgin queen can ensure she will receive the genetic diversity needed for her colony.

2500|$|Recently, {{scientists}} {{have begun to}} notice that the warming Arctic Ocean and land is resulting in changed distribution of species with the result of breaking down climate barriers that have prevented hybridization between closely related species. The most reported examples have been the three confirmed grizzly-polar bear hybrids. In 2010, {{a team led by}} National Marine Mammal Laboratory ecologist Brendan Kelly counted 34 possible hybridizations between distinct populations or species of Arctic marine mammals, many of which are endangered or threatened. These observed hybridizations included in 2009, a cross between a bowhead whale and a North Pacific right whale in the Bering Sea. Kelly stated that [...] "The breedings between the North Pacific right whale, whose numbers have fallen below 200, and the more numerous bowhead whale, could push the former to extinction. (Over time, the hybrids would begin to outnumber the sparse right whales.)" [...] Co-author Andrew Whitely wrote: [...] "Breedings between these marine mammals near the North Pole are likely to result in fertile offspring, because many of these animals have the same number of chromosomes... Over the short term the hybrid offspring from these Arctic animal matings will likely be strong and healthy, because unlike inbreeding, which magnifies deleterious genes, so-called <b>outbreeding</b> can mask these genes...But over time, as the hybrids mate randomly, those harmful genes will come out of hiding and make the offspring less fit and less capable of surviving." ...|$|E

5000|$|In 1919, Edward M. East and Donald F. Jones worked {{together}} on monographs on experimental biology, including a book on inbreeding and <b>outbreeding</b> and their genetic and sociological significance. This work covers reproduction among plants and animals, the mechanism of reproduction, the mechanism of heredity, mathematical considerations of inbreeding, inbreeding experiments with animals and plants, hybrid vigor or heterosis, conceptions as {{to the cause of}} hybrid vigor, sterility and its relations to inbreeding and crossbreeding, the role of inbreeding and <b>outbreeding</b> in evolution, and the value of inbreeding and <b>outbreeding</b> in plant and animal improvement. East and Jones explicitly considered inbreeding and <b>outbreeding</b> in man, their effect on the individual, and the intermingling of races and review the national stamina literature. In Inbreeding and Outbreeding: Their Genetic and Sociological Significance, East proposed the theory that inbreeding in a genetically diverse stock caused increased homozygosity. Believing with the Drosophila workers that most mutations were recessive and deleterious, East concluded that the increased homozygosity caused by inbreeding should generally be accompanied by detrimental effects. His theory also explained why inbreeding was not necessarily deleterious in all cases. Unless deleterious recessives were present, inbreeding caused no ill effects. <b>Outbreeding</b> of course had the opposite effect of increasing heterozygosity and was often accompanied by heterosis, or hybrid vigor.|$|E

50|$|Heterosis, hybrid vigor, or <b>outbreeding</b> enhancement, is the {{improved}} or increased function of any biological quality in a hybrid offspring. The adjective derived from heterosis is heterotic.|$|E
50|$|The {{different}} {{mechanisms of}} <b>outbreeding</b> depression can operate {{at the same}} time. However, determining which mechanism is more important in a particular population is very difficult. Generally the first mechanism will be more prevalent in the first generation (F1) after the initial outcrossing when most individuals {{are made up of}} the intermediate phenotype. An extreme case of this type of <b>outbreeding</b> depression is the sterility and other fitness-reducing effects often seen in interspecific hybrids (such as mules), which involves not only different alleles of the same gene but even different orthologous genes.|$|E
50|$|Not all outcrosses {{result in}} heterosis. For example, when a hybrid {{inherits}} traits from its parents {{that are not}} fully compatible, fitness can be reduced. This {{is a form of}} <b>outbreeding</b> depression.|$|E
5000|$|Positive {{assortative mating}} and kin {{selection}} could also relieve fitness cost of male-specific deleterious mtDNA mutations, while negative assortative mating has an opposite function. So, {{we should be}} careful when <b>outbreeding</b> endangered species.|$|E

50|$|Workers {{within the}} same colony all have one of two {{maternal}} alleles, which guarantees relatedness as offspring of the same queen. This species chooses to forms drones {{in order to encourage}} <b>outbreeding</b> which increases the fitness of the colony unlike inbreeding.|$|E
50|$|The second {{mechanism}} may {{not appear}} until {{two or more}} generations later (F2 or greater), when recombination has undermined vitality positive epistasis. Hybrid vigor in the first generation can, in some circumstances, {{be strong enough to}} mask the effects of <b>outbreeding</b> depression. An example of this is that plant breeders will make F1 hybrids from purebred strains, which will improve the uniformity and vigor of the offspring, however the F1 generation are not used for further breeding because of unpredictable phenotypes in their offspring. Unless there is strong selective pressure, <b>outbreeding</b> depression can increase in further generations as co-adapted gene complexes are broken apart without the forging of new co-adapted gene complexes to take their place.|$|E
50|$|However, intermixing two {{different}} populations can {{give rise to}} unfit polygenic traits in <b>outbreeding</b> depression (i.e. yielding offspring which lack the genetic adaptations to specific environmental conditions). These, then, will have a lowered fitness than pure-bred individuals of a particular subspecies that has adapted to its local environment.|$|E
5000|$|A Vortex: The A vortex is {{a result}} of an {{increase}} in genetic drift and a corresponding decrease in genetic variance which leads to a decrease in [...] "population adaptive potential", and eventual extinction. This vortex can result from biological invasion, resulting in large scale hybridization and <b>outbreeding</b> depression.|$|E
50|$|The exact {{causes for}} the {{evolution}} of natal philopatry are unknown. Two major hypotheses have been proposed. Shields (1982) suggested that philopatry was a way of ensuring inbreeding, in a hypothesis known as the optimal-inbreeding hypothesis. He argued that, since philopatry leads to the concentration of related individuals in their birth areas, and thus reduced genetic diversity, there must be some advantage to inbreeding - otherwise the process would have been evolutionary detrimental and would not be so prevalent. The major beneficial outcome under this hypothesis is the protection of a local gene complex that is finely adapted to the local environment. Another proposed benefit is the reduction the cost of meiosis and recombination events. Under this hypothesis, non-philopatric individuals would be maladapted and over multi-generational time, philopatry within a species could become fixed. Evidence for the optimal-inbreeding hypothesis is found in <b>outbreeding</b> depression. <b>Outbreeding</b> depression involves reduced fitness as a result of random mating, which occurs due to the breakdown of coadapted gene complexes by combining allele that do not cross well with those from a different subpopulation. However, {{it is important to note}} that <b>outbreeding</b> depression becomes more detrimental the longer (temporally) that subpopulations have been separated, and that this does hypothesis does not provide an initial mechanism for {{the evolution of}} natal philopatry.|$|E
50|$|Introducing alleles from a {{different}} population can reverse inbreeding depression. Different populations {{of the same species}} have different deleterious traits, and therefore their cross breeding will not result in homozygosity at most loci in the offspring. This is known as <b>outbreeding</b> enhancement, practiced by conservation managers and zoo captive breeders to prevent homozygosity.|$|E
50|$|Scientists {{surmise that}} the drive in humans, {{as in many}} animals, to engage in exogamy (<b>outbreeding)</b> is {{evolutionarily}} adaptive, as it {{reduces the risk of}} children having genetic defects caused by inbreeding, as a result of inheriting two copies of a recessive gene. The genetic principles involved apply to all species, not just humans.|$|E
50|$|Incidences of Ethiopian wolf-dog {{hybridisation}} {{have been}} recorded in Bale's Web Valley. At least four hybrids were identified and sterilised in the area. Although hybridisation has not been detected elsewhere, it could {{pose a threat to}} the wolf population's genetic integrity, resulting in <b>outbreeding</b> depression or a reduction in fitness, though this {{does not appear to have}} taken place.|$|E
50|$|When {{a species}} has been extirpated from a site where it {{previously}} existed, individuals for the reintroduced population must be sourced from elsewhere. When sourcing for reintroductions, {{it is important}} to consider local adaptation, adaptation to captivity (for ex situ conservation), the possibility of inbreeding depression and <b>outbreeding</b> depression, and the genetic diversity of the source population.|$|E
5000|$|The chapter {{describes}} the famous experiment {{that called for}} female partners to sniff boxes containing their male partners' T-shirts, which they had worn for two days.

[...] The group developed the NOD strain by an <b>outbreeding</b> of the cataract-prone strain from JcI:ICR mice.|$|E
50|$|In biology, exogamy more {{generally}} {{refers to the}} mating of individuals who are relatively less related genetically: that is, <b>outbreeding</b> as opposed to inbreeding. This benefits the offspring as it {{reduces the risk of}} the offspring inheriting two copies of a defective gene. Increasing the genetic diversity of the offspring is thought to improve their chances of surviving to reproduce themselves.|$|E
50|$|A second {{hypothesis}} explains {{the evolution of}} natal philopatry {{as a method of}} reducing the high costs of dispersal among offspring. A review of records of natal philopatry among passerine birds found that migrant species showed significantly less site fidelity than sedentary birds. Among migratory species, the cost of dispersal is paid either way. If the optimal-inbreeding hypothesis was correct, the benefits of inbreeding should result in philopatry among all species. Inbreeding depression is a phenomenon whereby deleterious alleles become fixed more easily within an inbreeding population. Inbreeding depression is demonstrably costly and accepted by most scientists as a greater cost than those of <b>outbreeding</b> depression. Within a species, there has also been found to be variation in rates of philopatry, with migratory populations exhibiting low levels of philopatry - further suggesting that the ecological cost of dispersal, rather than genetic benefits of either inbreeding or <b>outbreeding,</b> is the driver of natal philopatry.|$|E

50|$|Inbreeding {{depression}} {{seems to}} be present in most groups of organisms, but varies across mating systems. Hermaphroditic species often exhibit lower degrees of inbreeding depression than outcrossing species, as repeated generations of selfing is thought to purge deleterious alleles from populations. For example, the outcrossing nematode (roundworm) Caenorhabditis remanei has been demonstrated to suffer severely from inbreeding depression, unlike its hermaphroditic relative C. elegans, which experiences <b>outbreeding</b> depression.|$|E
