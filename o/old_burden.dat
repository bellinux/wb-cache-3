It is evaluated here the pollution of selected areas, the size of the contaminated area in selected areas, the types of pollution and others. Selected areas were evaluated according to the available SEKM database data. At the end of this work is the overall evaluation of selected regions according to available data...|$|R

Although {{relieved}} of many of the <b>old</b> <b>burdens,</b> controls, and taxes, the peasantry was still highly traditional in its social and economic behavior. Many eagerly took on mortgages to buy as much land as possible for their children, so debt was an important factor in their calculations. The working class in the cities was a small element, and had been freed of many restrictions imposed by medieval guilds. However France was very slow to industrialize, and much of the work remained drudgery without machinery or technology to help. France was still localized, especially in terms of language, but now there was an emerging French nationalism that showed its national pride in the Army, and foreign affairs.|$|R

50|$|The old {{aristocracy}} had returned, {{and recovered}} {{much of the}} land they owned directly. However they completely lost all their old seigneurial rights {{to the rest of}} the farmland, and the peasants were no longer under their control. The old aristocracy had dallied with the ideas of the Enlightenment and rationalism. Now the aristocracy was much more conservative, and much more supportive of the Catholic Church. For the best jobs, meritocracy was the new policy, and aristocrats had to compete directly with the growing business and professional class. Anti-clerical sentiment became stronger than ever before, but was now based in certain elements of the middle class and indeed the peasantry as well. The great masses of the French people were peasants in the countryside, or impoverished workers in the cities. They gained new rights, and a new sense of possibilities. Although relieved of many of the <b>old</b> <b>burdens,</b> controls, and taxes, the peasantry was still highly traditional in its social and economic behavior.

The mining of uranium influenced in considerable way health and quality of miners´ lives, and also lives of their relatives and up to now it still influencing quality of lives of people living near mining locations. Above all the uranium industry made irreparable changes in our country and the leftovers are up to now influencing the quality of our environment. That´s why there is a must to pay special attention to this area. Nowadays in the Czech republic there is registered around 3768 old uranium mines, out of it there is 2523 mining cannons which are obliged to be regularly controlled. The negative influences are marked as <b>old</b> <b>burdens</b> of already eliminated mining or modificating act on our environment or in some other way threatening public interests. According to the character of negative expression we distinguish mining burdens, it means negative influence of mining activity on stableness of the surface, and ecological burdens, it means negative influence on our environment. In my opinion a matter of uranium industry is very rarely known to the wide public. The main reason why is it like this can be {{the fact that in the}} period of main expansion of uranium industry in the Czech republic all the information connected to the research, mining or maintaining of uranium, were top secret. The second reason can be no existence of complete source of information that could be used for study purposes and the same time for informing general public.

40|$|The dental {{profile of}} the {{population}} of most industrialised countries is changing. For the first time in at least a century most elderly people in the United Kingdom will soon have some of their own natural teeth. This could be beneficial for the frail and dependent elderly, as natural teeth are associated with greater dietary freedom of choice and good nutrition. There may also be problems including high levels of dental disease associated with poor hygiene and diet. New data from a national oral health survey in Great Britain is presented. The few dentate elderly people in institutions at the moment have poor hygiene and high levels of dental decay. If these problems persist as dentate younger generations get <b>older,</b> the <b>burden</b> of care will be substantial. Many dental problems in elderly people are preventable or would benefit from early intervention. Strategies to approach these problems are presented...|$|R

5000|$|The T1 had {{outstanding}} throughput {{with massive}} numbers of threads {{supported by the}} processor, but <b>older</b> applications <b>burdened</b> with single thread bottlenecks occasionally exhibited poor overall performance. Single threaded application weakness was mitigated with the follow-on SPARC T4 processor. The T4 core count was reduced to 8 (from 16 on the T3), the cores were made more complex, the clock rate was nearly doubled - all contributing to faster single thread performance (from between 300% to 500% increase over previous generations. Additional {{effort was made to}} add the [...] "critical thread API", where the operating system would detect a bottleneck and would temporarily allocate the resources of an entire core, instead of a 1 of 8 threads, to the targeted application processes exhibiting single threaded CPU bound behavior. This allowed the T4 to uniquely mitigate single threaded bottlenecks, while not having to compromise in the overall architecture to achieve massive multi-threaded throughput.|$|R

Here they observed the nightly progress of the moon and stars, grew familiar with the heaving of moles, the dancing of rabbits on the hillocks, the distant hoot of owls, the bark of foxes from woods further inland; but saw {{not a sign of}} the enemy. As, night after night, they walked round the two ricks which it was their duty to fire at a signal--one being of furze for a quick flame, the other of turf, for a long, slow radiance--they thought and talked of old times, and drank patriotically from a large wood flagon that was filled every day.|$|R
