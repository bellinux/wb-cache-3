40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to study the effect of silica (SiO 2) and calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) on compounding torque, mechanical, physical, morphological properties, and swelling behaviour <b>of</b> <b>cellular</b> natural <b>rubber,</b> using a compression moulding and conventional vulcanisation (CV) system with oxybisbenzenesulphonylhydrazine (OBSH) as a blowing agent, the moulding cure temperature and time being 160 oC and 7 mins respectively. The <b>cellular</b> <b>rubber</b> vulcanisates were characterised with respect to tensile strength, abrasion resistance, thermal aging, swelling and deswelling behaviours. The results in dicated that the addition of 20 phr SiO 2 in the rubber compound was the most preferable for the tensile strength and abrasion resistance, this being associated with reinforcing effects between the silica and rubber molecules, which also promoted the swelling resistance in toluene during equilibrium state. In the case of CaCO 3 filler, added into the rubber compounds having 20 phr SiO 2, the optimum CaCO 3 content to maintain the overall properties was between 20 and 30 phr. The CaCO 3 above 30 phr reduced the tensile and abrasive properties of the compounds due to the excessive fillers (silica and calcium carbonate) contents being greater than 50 phr. Addition of CaCO 3 {{had no effect on}} the swelling behaviour of the compounds. Considering the effect of thermal aging in the SiO 2 filled rubber compounds, it was observed that the mechanical properties <b>of</b> non-filler <b>cellular</b> <b>rubber</b> tended to decrease whereas the swelling resistance increased with aging, this being due to the desulphuration of the surphur crosslinks. However, the properties of the NR compounds containing 20 phr SiO 2 and various contents of CaCO 3 were unaffected by thermal aging. In summary, the recommended mixed fillers contents for SiO 2 and CaCO 3 in this work were 20 phr and 20 - 30 phr, respectively...|$|R

Treatment with 2 -aminopurine is shown to prevent suppression <b>of</b> <b>cellular</b> translation without disrupting the normal viral block in the transport <b>of</b> <b>cellular</b> mRNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.

Results are presented that indicate that activation of DAI kinase and phosphorylation of eIF- 2 alpha may be required but are not sufficient to achieve inhibition <b>of</b> <b>cellular</b> protein synthesis during adenovirus infection.

40|$|The inhibitions <b>of</b> <b>cellular</b> {{protein and}} RNA {{synthesis}} in picornavirus-infected cells are early events which require only limited synthesis of virus-specific proteins. The inhibition <b>of</b> <b>cellular</b> protein synthesis {{appears to be}} due to blocking of the association of ribosomes with host messenger RNA. Inhibition <b>of</b> <b>cellular</b> RNA synthesis involves inactivation of the template-enzyme complex and affects ribosomal RNA synthesis before messenger RNA synthesis. Inhibition <b>of</b> <b>cellular</b> DNA synthesis also occurs early and may be secondary to inhibition <b>of</b> <b>cellular</b> protein synthesis.

Stimulation of phospholipid synthesis in picornavirus-infected cells also requires only limited synthesis of virus-specific proteins.
