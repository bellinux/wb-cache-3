5|$|The {{species in}} Calostoma have been {{collected}} in regions of deciduous, temperate, tropical or subtropical forests, containing tree species from the families Fagaceae, Nothofagaceae, Myrtaceae, and Dipterocarpaceae. The type species C.cinnabarinum was shown to form ectomycorrhizae with Quercus species, using isotopic labeling, molecular and morphological analyses. Southeast Asian Calostoma have also been described as ectomycorrhizal. Calostoma sarasinii forms ectomycorrhizae with species of Lithocarpus (Fagaceae) while Calostoma retisporum forms ectomycorrhizae with species from the Myrtaceae. The ectomycorrhizal mode <b>of</b> <b>nutrition</b> is predominant in the Sclerodermatineae suborder. Historically, it had been assumed to be saprobic, due to its taxonomic uncertainly, and presumed relatedness to other saprobic fungi like the stalked puffballs and the earthstars.|$|E

5|$|Mutualism is {{well known}} in a few beetles, such as the ambrosia beetle, which {{partners}} with fungi to digest the wood of dead trees. The beetles excavate tunnels in dead trees in which they cultivate fungal gardens, their sole source <b>of</b> <b>nutrition.</b> After landing on a suitable tree, an ambrosia beetle excavates a tunnel in which it releases spores of its fungal symbiont. The fungus penetrates the plant's xylem tissue, digests it, and concentrates the nutrients on and near the surface of the beetle gallery, so the weevils and the fungus both benefit. The beetles cannot eat the wood due to toxins, and uses its relationship with fungi to help overcome the defenses of its host tree in order to provide nutrition for their larvae. Chemically mediated by a bacterially produced polyunsaturated peroxide, this mutualistic relationship between the beetle and the fungus is coevolved.|$|E
5|$|Products {{collected}} from living horses include mare's milk, used {{by people with}} large horse herds, such as the Mongols, who let it ferment to produce kumis. Horse blood was once used as food by the Mongols and other nomadic tribes, who found it a convenient source <b>of</b> <b>nutrition</b> when traveling. Drinking their own horses' blood allowed the Mongols to ride for {{extended periods of time}} without stopping to eat. The drug Premarin is a mixture of estrogens extracted from the urine of pregnant mares (pregnant mares' urine), and was previously a widely used drug for hormone replacement therapy. The tail hair of horses can be used for making bows for string instruments such as the violin, viola, cello, and double bass.|$|E

5|$|The {{first true}} dipterans known {{are from the}} Middle Triassic (around 240 million years ago), and they became {{widespread}} during the Middle and Late Triassic. Modern flowering plants did not appear until the Cretaceous (around 140 million years ago), so the original dipterans {{must have had a}} different source <b>of</b> <b>nutrition</b> other than nectar. Based on the attraction of many modern fly groups to shiny droplets, {{it has been suggested that}} they may have fed on honeydew produced by sap-sucking bugs which were abundant at the time, and dipteran mouthparts are well-adapted to softening and lapping up the crusted residues. The basal clades in the Diptera include the Deuterophlebiidae and the enigmatic Nymphomyiidae. Three episodes of evolutionary radiation are thought to have occurred based on the fossil record. Many new species of lower Diptera developed in the Triassic, about 220 million years ago. Many lower Brachycera appeared in the Jurassic, some 180 million years ago. A third radiation took place among the Schizophora at the start of the Paleogene, 66 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|The lactational {{amenorrhea}} method {{involves the}} use of a woman's natural postpartum infertility which occurs after delivery and may be extended by breastfeeding. This usually requires the presence of no periods, exclusively breastfeeding the infant, and a child younger than six months. The World Health Organization states that if breastfeeding is the infant's only source <b>of</b> <b>nutrition,</b> the failure rate is 2% in the six months following delivery. Six uncontrolled studies of lactational amenorrhea method users found failure rates at 6 months postpartum between 0% and 7.5%. Failure rates increase to 4–7% at one year and 13% at two years. Feeding formula, pumping instead of nursing, the use of a pacifier, and feeding solids all increase its failure rate. In those who are exclusively breastfeeding, about 10% begin having periods before three months and 20% before six months. In those who are not breastfeeding, fertility may return four weeks after delivery.|$|E
5|$|There are {{primarily}} two feeding guilds in Lepidoptera – the nectarivorous who obtain {{the majority of}} their nutritional requirements from floral nectar and those of the frugivorous guild who feed primarily on juices of rotting fruit or fermenting tree sap. There are substantial differences between the morphology of the proboscises of both feeding guilds. Hawkmoths (family Sphingidae) have elongated proboscises which enable them to feed on and pollinate flowers with long tubular corrollas. Besides this, a number of taxa (especially noctuid moths) have evolved different proboscis morphologies. Certain noctuid species have developed piercing mouthparts; the proboscis has sclerotised scales on the tip with which to pierce and suck blood or fruit juices. Proboscises in some Heliconius species have evolved to consume solids such as pollen. Some other moths, mostly noctuids, have modified proboscises to suit their mode <b>of</b> <b>nutrition</b> – lachrymophagy (feeding on tears of sleeping birds). The proboscises often have sharp apices as well as a host of barbs and spurs on the stem.|$|E

5|$|This early era was {{followed}} by peace and cultural expansion between the 12th and late 18th century. Land was divided into regions designed for both the immediate needs of the populace and the long-term welfare of the environment. These ahupuaa generally {{took the form of}} long strips of land oriented from the mountain summits to the coast. Mauna Kea's summit was encompassed in the ahupuaa of Kaohe, with part of its eastern slope reaching into the nearby Humuula. Principal sources <b>of</b> <b>nutrition</b> for Hawaiians living on the slopes of the volcano came from the māmane–naio forest of its upper slopes, which provided them with vegetation and bird life. Bird species hunted included the uau (Pterodroma sandwichensis), nēnē (Branta sandvicensis), and palila (Loxioides bailleui). The lower koa–ōhia forest gave the natives wood for canoes and ornate bird feathers for decoration.|$|E
5|$|Undeterred, Bruce {{was elected}} Chairman {{of the newly}} formed FAO Council in November 1947, working once more with John Boyd Orr, now Secretary-General of the FAO. Acute {{shortages}} of cereals and livestock were rampant following severe droughts in Europe, and the international food supply system was under serious strain after the devastation of the war. Bruce and the council worked in these years to distribute fertiliser and agricultural machinery, as well as improve nutrition, especially in less developed nations. More {{than two-thirds of the}} world was undernourished in 1949 and Bruce felt it imperative for the Council to bring these stark facts to the developed nations. A landmark agreement on technical aid between the FAO and the United Nations was reached in November 1949, and the FAO received the funding and logistical capacity to act on the food shortage crisis and the problems of poor nutrition in the developing world. Bruce and the FAO were successful in these years in supporting the recovery of world agricultural output. By 1951 this had exceeded pre-war levels, and general levels <b>of</b> <b>nutrition</b> were rising internationally, but by the time Bruce stepped down in that year neither had improved fast enough {{to keep pace with the}} post-war population boom. The Council faced major obstacles in supporting the improvement of conditions in the developing world as governments there began diverting resources to arms programs as independence, post-colonial and Cold War conflicts multiplied. Frustrated by continuing world conflict and the lack of commitment from the developed world to support the lofty but very difficult aims of the FAO, both Bruce and Orr resigned from the FAO disappointed by its modest gains and insufficient powers to alleviate world food problems.|$|E
