5|$|A {{number of}} {{alterations}} are {{visible to the}} naked eye as pentimenti. A piece of paper draped <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the table is clearly visible in outline, despite having been painted over with detailing of the table itself. Sigismunda's index finger which was bent towards and perhaps touching the heart has been straightened, but the outline of the tip is still visible on the surface of the heart. A looped cord in the top right-hand corner is poorly concealed under the topmost layer of paint. It is also known that, to attempt to appease critics, Hogarth repainted the fingers of Sigismunda so that the blood that was previously there would no longer be visible.|$|E
5|$|In the station, Dive Coasters {{that use}} non-floorless trains simply use a {{standard}} station. With Dive Coasters that use floorless trains, {{in order to}} allow riders to load and unload the train, a movable floor is necessary. Because the front row has nothing in front of it to stop riders from walking <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the station, a gate is placed in front of the train to prevent this from happening. Once all the over-the-shoulder restraints are locked, the gate opens and the floor separates into several pieces and moves underneath the station. When the next train enters the station, the gate is closed and the floors are brought back up where the next riders board.|$|E
5|$|When Cate {{traveled}} {{down the}} mountain via Gondola, defeating the H.A.R.M. helicopters in the process, she encounters Volkov and a gun duel ensues. During their duel, an explosion causes an avalanche to send Volkov <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> a cliff. Later, Cate is confronted by the Baroness, and another gun duel ensues. After defeating the Baroness, she reveals that she has also infected herself {{and is about to}} detonate. Cate hurries to clear the civilians off the streets, and hides inside a building as the Baroness explodes.|$|E

50|$|Individuals of {{this species}} have a {{prostrate}} growth habit with mat-forming stems 15-30 cm long. Its growth in long, matted tendrils makes the “String of Bananas” an excellent groundcover, as well as ideal for cascading <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> containers or hanging baskets.|$|R
60|$|It is convenient, but not necessary, {{to have a}} well-greased leather sheath, a tube of {{eighteen}} inches in length, through which the rope runs, as shown in both figures. It lies <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cliff, and the friction of the rock keeps it steadily in its place.|$|R
5|$|After seeing Marge and Ruth again while cooking {{breakfast on}} his car engine, Wiggum {{continues}} his chase of the two, aided by other Springfield Police vehicles. After noticing a cliff ahead, Homer believes that Marge and Ruth are attempting suicide because of him and, using a megaphone, apologizes to Marge for all the mistakes he has made in their marriage and urges them not to drive into the chasm. Ruth, who had not noticed the chasm, slams on the brakes and stops in time; however, Homer and Wiggum fail to stop and fly <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the cliff only to crash into a landfill. The episodes ends {{with a description of}} the fates of each of the characters involved in the episode.|$|E
5|$|If {{the player}} instead waits, the cabin gets transported to Aosagi Island. Yomogi, Mayuzumi, and Cocoro avoid the {{avalanche}} that was {{mentioned in the}} newspaper. The Yuni from 2011 is left at Akakura to be rescued by the rescue team in 2011, and to go to SPHIA in 2012 to repeat the loop, making sure that Cocoro, Yomogi, and Mayuzumi survive the week. Satoru reviews his theory regarding Inubushi; he thinks that she, too, was experiencing the transfer phenomenon, and that her consciousness ended up at Mount Akakura in the dying body of Hotori. He thinks the consciousness of Hotori inhabited Inubushi's body, rendering it free of homicidal tendencies, but realizes that since both his and Inubushi's consciousnesses remain at the island, Hotori cannot occupy Inubushi's body when he occupies his; Cocoro runs towards Inubushi, who is holding Utsumi's infant child <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> a cliff while singing. The game ends with Satoru meeting Mayuzumi, who says she does not recognize him.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the entire}} party, none were skilled skiers and only Bernacchi and Armitage had any {{experience}} with dog-sledges. The {{results of the}} men's early efforts to master these techniques were not encouraging, and tended to reinforce Scott's preference for man-hauling. The dangers of the unfamiliar conditions were confirmed when, on 11 March, a party returning from an attempted journey to Cape Crozier became stranded on an icy slope during a blizzard. In their attempts to find safer ground, one of the group, Able Seaman George Vince, slid <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> a cliff and was killed. His body was never recovered; a cross with a simple inscription, erected in his memory, still stands at {{the summit of the}} Hut Point promontory.|$|E

5|$|On {{a trip to}} {{the bird}} sanctuary, the Simpson family discovers that a {{speedway}} raceway built around the sanctuary is opening that day, to Lisa's dismay. The family watches from the stand and sees Ned Flanders and his family, who claims to enjoy the high levels of safety the drivers use. Later, a squad of cheerleaders fires free T-shirts from air cannons into the crowd, and Homer rudely demands one. Irritated, Maude leaves to buy hot dogs. The cheerleaders send a full salvo of T-shirts in Homer's direction, but he bends down at the last second to pick up a bobby pin on the ground. Maude returns at that exact moment, gets hit by the T-shirts and falls <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the bleachers to her death on the parking lot.|$|E
5|$|Six {{versions}} of the 8-foot high vault were built, each with specific uses. One of the vaults was a façade built onto {{the front of a}} semitruck and was used for filming close shots of the vault destroying street cars. Another vault was a reinforced, four-wheel self-drive vehicle that was connected to 30-foot cables and dragged through the streets of San Juan by the two stunt Dodge Chargers. The four-ton vault was driven by stunt driver Henry Kingi, who had to wear a temperature controlled suit to compensate for the temperatures within that could exceed 100 degrees. A scene where the vault tumbled as the cars rounded a corner was a practical effect, and the result was more violent than the filmmakers had anticipated. Over 200 vehicles were destroyed by the vault during filming. Several stunts had to be cut including a final scene that would have seen the vault hanging <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the Teodoro Moscoso Bridge. This stunt was abandoned when it was determined that even the powerful Chargers {{would not be able to}} support the vault's weight.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} a Floorless Coaster has one main {{difference}} from traditional steel roller coasters around the world: it has no floors between the seats. While a train is in the station, a floor is used only for loading and unloading purposes. Because the front row has nothing {{in front of it}} to stop riders from walking <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the station, a gate is placed in front of the train to prevent this from happening. Once all the over-the-shoulder restraints are locked, the floor separates into several pieces and moves underneath the station. The gate then opens, allowing the train to move forward. When the train returns to the station, the floor is brought back up and the gate is closed as the next riders board the roller coaster. Aside from the station, a Floorless Coaster has several inversions similar to B's Sitting Coasters.|$|E
25|$|The total mean {{curvature}} of a polyhedral surface {{has been defined}} as <b>the</b> sum <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> lengths multiplied by the exterior dihedral angles. Thus (for polyhedra without rational angles) it is a linear function of the Dehn invariant, although it does not provide full information about the Dehn invariant. It has been proven to remain constant for any flexing polyhedron.|$|R
50|$|The carpet {{measures}} 16 x 6 ft. In the Victoria and Albert Museum {{it covers}} an entire wall. However, {{it was made}} neither for wall nor floor, but as a table covering.

50|$|Soft rock (or lite rock) is a subgenre of {{pop music}} that largely {{features}} acoustic guitars and slow-to-mid tempos. Originating {{in the early}} 1970s in southern California, <b>the</b> style smoothed <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> singer-songwriter and pop, relying on simple, melodic songs with big, lush productions. Soft rock dominated radio throughout the 1970s and eventually metamorphosed into the synthesized music of adult contemporary in the 1980s.|$|R
5|$|The {{script is}} {{characterized}} by numerous inexplicable mood and personality shifts in characters. In analyzing the film's abrupt tone shifts, Greg Sestero highlighted two scenes in particular. In the first scene, Johnny enters the rooftop {{in the middle of}} a tirade about being accused of domestic abuse, only to become abruptly cheerful upon seeing Mark; a few moments later, he laughs inappropriately upon learning that a friend of Mark's had been severely beaten. On set, Sestero and first assistant director Sandy Schklair repeatedly tried to convince Wiseau that the line should not be delivered as comical, but Wiseau refused to refrain from laughing. In the second instance, occurring a few scenes later, Mark attempts to kill Peter by throwing him off a roof after Peter expresses his belief that Mark is having an affair with Lisa; just as Peter is about to fall to his death, Mark pulls Peter back <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the roof, apologizes, and the two continue their previous conversation with no acknowledgement of what just occurred.|$|E
5|$|While Kiara and Kovu's {{friendship}} {{continues to}} grow, Simba, encouraged by Nala, attempts to show Kovu kindness by spending {{a day with}} him. Realizing that Kovu is beginning to side with Simba because of his love for Kiara, Zira ambushes and attacks Simba. Convinced by Zira that Kovu {{is responsible for the}} ambush, Simba exiles him and forbids Kiara to see him, but she makes her father realize that he is acting irrationally, before leaving to find Kovu. When a battle ensues between the Pride Landers and the Outsiders, Kiara and Kovu arrive and stop them, with Kiara telling them that they are one. When a furious Zira attacks Simba, she is intercepted by Kiara, causing the two to fall <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> a cliff. Having landed safely on a ledge, Kiara offers to help Zira, who is struggling to hang on. However, Zira, consumed by her resentment towards Simba, falls to her death. Simba finally approves of Kiara's love for Kovu and reconciles with his daughter, and accepts the two lions as future king and queen of the Pride Lands.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} month, {{she sends}} Lauren {{a message and}} meets her outside the police station, looking rough, as she has been arrested for shoplifting. Whitney opts to live with Dot Branning (June Brown) instead of her close family, but Dot convinces her {{to move back to}} Ricky's. When Ryan returns from a holiday, he learns of Whitney's ordeal and urges her to go to the police and get tested for sexually transmitted infections. She says she is not ready to go to the police but agrees to the test, which shows she has a chlamydia infection. When Whitney starts a relationship with a man named Lee (Mitchell Hunt), it is revealed that he is a friend of Rob's, and when Whitney agrees to meet Lee by text, Rob takes control of Lee's mobile phone. She allows Rob to take her home but then tells him to wait outside while she escapes through the back door and hitches a lift to Southend-on-Sea with friends. She leaves him a voicemail message not knowing that he has followed her. He finds her in her hotel room and tells her how much he loves her, but when Fatboy (Ricky Norwood) comes in, Rob attacks him, so Whitney tells him to leave. Fatboy calls Ryan, who comes to Southend to look for Rob. When he finds him, they fight and fall <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the pier. The next day, a body is recovered from the sea, and is later revealed to be Rob who has died. Whitney thinks Ryan may also be dead until he appears. She tells him she has told the police everything about Rob, including Ryan's fight with him, and Ryan tells Whitney he has to leave. They say an emotional farewell.|$|E

The stunt took place one time; the studio got its shot, and Lewin broke his back.|$|R
50|$|The Appalachian Garden {{frames the}} southeastern {{corner of the}} gardens and {{represents}} the Appalachian Plateau. The garden consists of raised beds with outcropping of rocks. These resemble the rocky “hanging gardens” in which plants creep out and hang <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> cliff sides and outcrops of the area. These hanging gardens feature large stones from the washed out covered bridge near Zanesville and large Peebles dolomite from Adams County.|$|R

25|$|Blowing <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> a jug or bottle {{can create}} a nearly pure tone of low frequency. The driving force is the flow over the jug edge so one might expect an edge tone dipole sound field. In this case, The {{curvature}} and roundness of the edge makes a strong edge tone unlikely. Any periodicity at the edge is likely submerged in the Class III feedback from the jug volume. The unsteady edge flow sets up a classical Helmholtz resonator response in which the interior geometry and the jug neck determines the resultant frequency. A resonance equation is shown below.|$|E
25|$|In January 2015, {{while driving}} {{the men and}} women of Underworld to an up class hotel, Steve loses control of their minibus when he is distracted by {{reckless}} drivers, and ends up crashing. The vehicle is hanging <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> a cliff, and leaving the passengers' lives hanging in the balance. Steve regains consciousness first and abandons the wreckage. While everyone emerges alive from the crash, young Sinead Tinker is left paralysed, potentially for life, and Steve's depression takes a turn for the worse. The episode where the bus crashes was broadcast on the same night actress Anne Kirkbride's death occurred and was announced.|$|E
25|$|Rotary swaging {{is usually}} a cold working process, used to reduce the diameter, produce a taper, or add a point to a round workpiece. It can also impart {{internal}} shapes in hollow workpieces {{through the use of}} a mandrel (the shape must have a constant cross-section). Swaging a bearing into a housing means either flaring its groove's lips onto the chamfer of the housing, or flaring the housing's material <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the bearing. The flaring is done with a pair of rolls that travel around the hole and are fed down into the part, deforming the metal in a controlled, predicted way. Grease is often used to lubricate this swaging process, which is also called roller swaging.|$|E
