40|$|ABSTRACT Aim: The {{discharge}} {{of a patient}} with a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is often com-plicated by important practical and logistic but not medi-cal problems. The purpose of this survey study was to collect data about <b>discharge</b> <b>procedures</b> in patients with a PEG {{in order to improve}} <b>discharge</b> <b>procedures</b> and evalu-ate the home-care environment. Methods: Questionnaires were sent to 25 hospitals. Questions were related to the incidence of PEG tube placement, the discharge proce-dure, and problems experienced relating to the home-care setting. Results: The regional incidence of PEG tube place-ment was calculated to be 1 : 1500 inhabitants per year. The most frequent indications for PEG were neurologic and esophageal disease.

Yet, whether social dynamics are due to peer pressure, frequency of interaction, or genuine learning, for example, has important implications for questions of political representation and accountability. We demonstrate how a recent innovation can be used to study the di�usion of behavior within legislatures. In particular, we study di�usion within the U. S.

The <b>discharge</b> <b>procedure</b> shares many characteristics with other forms of legislative behavior, yet it has one important advantage when it comes to studying social dynamics: we can observe when members decide to sign petitions. Based on data from 1995 to 2014, we �nd that the social dynamics underlying the <b>discharge</b> <b>procedure</b> tend to involve the rational evaluation of information conveyed by the behavior of previous petition signatories...|$|R

40|$|After Yogyakarta {{earthquake}} in 2006, {{the main problem}} {{that occurred in the}} first yard of Prambanan Temple is ponding area that occurred after rainfall. Soil characterization needs to be determined by conducting several processes, especially permeability coefficient (k) in both saturated and unsaturated conditions to solve this problem. More accurate and efficient field testing procedure is required to obtain permeability data that present the field condition. One of the field permeability test equipment is Constant <b>Discharge</b> <b>procedure</b> to determine the permeability coefficient. Necessary adjustments of the Constant <b>Discharge</b> <b>procedure</b> are needed to be determined especially the value of geometric factor (F) to improve the corresponding value of permeability coefficient. The value of k will be correlated with the value of volumetric water content (θ) of an unsaturated condition until saturated condition. The principle <b>procedure</b> of Constant <b>Discharge</b> model provides a constant flow in permeameter tube that flows into the ground until the water level in the tube becomes constant. Constant water level in the tube is highly dependent on the tube dimension. Every tube dimension has a shape factor called the geometric factor that affects the result of the test. Geometric factor value is defined as the characteristic of shape and radius of the tube. This research has modified the geometric factor parameters by using empty material tube method so that the geometric factor will change. Saturation level is monitored by using soil moisture sensor. The field test results were compared with the results of laboratory tests to validate the results of the test. Field and laboratory test results of empty tube material method have an average difference of 3. 33 x 10 - 4 cm/sec. The test results showed that modified geometric factor provides more accurate data. The improved methods of constant <b>discharge</b> <b>procedure</b> provide more relevant results...|$|R

Charging noise {{has already been}} observed and confirmed in the GEO 600 detector and {{is thought to have}} been observed in one of the LIGO detectors.

The corona <b>discharge</b> <b>procedure</b> was used to discharge samples at atmospheric pressure and would be intended to be used to discharge the detector optics during the cleaning of the optics. Both techniques were shown to reduce both polarities of surface charge on fused silica to a level that would not limit advanced LIGO.
