50|$|A {{fiber optic}} node has a {{broadband}} optical receiver, which converts the downstream optically modulated signal {{coming from the}} headend or hub to an electrical signal going to the homes. , the downstream signal is a RF modulated signal that typically begins at 50 MHz and ranges from 550-1000 MHz on the upper end. The fiber optic node also contains a reverse- or return-path transmitter that sends communication from the home back to the headend. In North America, this reverse signal is a modulated RF ranging from 5-42 MHz while {{in other parts of}} the world, the range is 5-65 MHz.

These optical amplifiers use short, gain-specific lengths of fibre which are doped with erbium ions and spliced in-line with the transmission fibre.

5000|$|The LADS {{system is}} built around a Nd:YAG laser, which emits an infra-red beam at 990 hertz. The beam is {{frequency}} doubled to produce a green laser.

40|$|An {{optoelectronic}} system utilizes wavelength-dependent {{scattering of}} light {{for measuring the}} density and mass flow of a two-phase fluid in a pipe. The apparatus was invented for original use in measuring the mass flow of a two-phase cryogenic fluid (e. g., liquid hydrogen containing bubbles of hydrogen gas), but underlying principles of operation can readily be adapted to non-cryogenic two-phase fluids. The system (see figure) includes a laser module, which contains two or more laser diodes, each operating at a different wavelength. The laser module also contains beam splitters that combine the beams at the various wavelengths so as to produce two output beams, each containing all of the wavelengths. One of the multiwavelength output beams is sent, via a multimode fiberoptic cable, to a transmitting <b>optical</b> <b>coupler.</b> The other multiwavelength output beam is sent, via another multimode fiber-optic cable, to a reference detector module, wherein fiber-optic splitters split the light into several multiwavelength beams, each going to a photodiode having a spectral response that is known and that differs from the spectral responses of the other photodiodes. The outputs of these photodiodes are digitized and fed to a processor, which executes an algorithm that utilizes the known spectral responses to convert the photodiode outputs to obtain reference laser-power levels for the various wavelengths. The transmitting <b>optical</b> <b>coupler</b> is mounted in (and sealed to) {{a hole in the}} pipe and is oriented at a slant with respect to the axis of the pipe. The transmitting <b>optical</b> <b>coupler</b> contains a collimating lens and a cylindrical lens that form the light emerging {{from the end of the}} fiber-optic cable into a fan-shaped beam in a meridional plane of the pipe. Receiving optical couplers similar to the transmitting optical couplers are mounted in the same meridional plane at various longitudinal positions on the opposite side of the pipe, approximately facing the transmitting <b>optical</b> <b>coupler</b> along the same slant. Light collected by each receiving <b>optical</b> <b>coupler</b> is sent, via a multimode fiber-optic cable, to a detector module similar to the reference detector module. The outputs of the photodiodes in each detector module are digitized and processed, similarly to those of the reference detector module, to obtain indications of the amounts of light of each wavelength scattered to the corresponding receiving position. The value for each wavelength at each position is also normalized to the reference laser-power level for that wavelength. From these normalized values, the density and the mass flow rate of the fluid are estimated...|$|E

40|$|A four-pass <b>optical</b> <b>coupler</b> affords {{increased}} (in {{comparison with}} related prior two-pass optical couplers) utilization of light {{generated by a}} laser diode in side pumping of a solid-state laser slab. The original application for which this coupler was conceived involves a neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) crystal slab, which, when pumped by a row of laser diodes at a wavelength of 809 nm, lases at a wavelength of 1, 064 nm. Heretofore, typically, a thin laser slab has been pumped in two passes, the second pass occurring by virtue of reflection of pump light from a highly reflective thin film on the side opposite the side through which the pump light enters. In two-pass pumping, a Nd:YAG slab having a thickness of 2 mm (which is typical) absorbs about 84 percent of the 809 -nm pump light power, leaving about 16 percent of the pump light power to travel back toward the laser diodes. This unused power can cause localized heating of the laser diodes, thereby reducing their lifetimes. Moreover, if the slab is thinner than 2 mm, then even more unused power travels back toward the laser diodes. The four-pass <b>optical</b> <b>coupler</b> captures most of this unused pump light and sends {{it back to the}} laser slab for two more passes. As a result, the slab absorbs more pump light, as though it were twice as thick. The gain and laser cavity beam quality of a smaller laser slab in conjunction with this <b>optical</b> <b>coupler</b> can thus be made comparable to those of a larger two-pass-pumped laser slab...|$|E
