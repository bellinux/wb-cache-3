500|$|The Allman Brothers Band have {{generally}} been {{considered one of the}} pioneering bands in Southern rock, although the group distanced themselves from the term. Guitarist Dickey Betts was most vocal about this classification, which he considered unfair: [...] "I think it's limiting. I'd rather just be known as a progressive rock band from the South. I'm damned proud <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> and where I'm from, but I hate the term 'Southern rock.'

Commenting about the success of his singles, Songz stated that [...] "they're very strong records and they're not just radio records.

500|$|Derulo {{explained}} {{that he did not}} believe in the possibility of [...] "It Girl" [...] to be the next single from Future History. However, his peers believed that it was very distinct from the lead single, [...] "Don't Wanna Go Home" [...] and that response motivated him to pick it as the second single. He believed that showing the difference in the new album was important in picking the single. He did not want to put another dance song so that his fans do not assume that the entire album consisted of uptempo songs. He concluded that [...] "growing up has definitely taken place. My music has always been a representation <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> and I guess I speak differently, my demeanour is different." ...|$|E

Meyer says that she does not consciously intend her novels to be Mormon-influenced, or to promote the virtues of sexual abstinence and spiritual purity, but admits that her writing is shaped by her values, saying, [...] "I don't think my books are going to be really graphic or dark, because <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> There's {{always going to be a}} lot of light in my stories." ...|$|E

Robinson secured two top-20 finishes in the Busch Series in the team's No. 36 car, but retired from racing after four events {{to start a family}} with her husband Jeff Clark.

500|$|A {{secondary}} {{question of}} the Filegate controversy revolved around what the Office of Personnel Security was, who had authorized the hiring of Livingstone, and whether he was qualified for the job. [...] The Office was not responsible for actual White House security, as that was the charge of the United States Secret Service, nor did it perform background checks on potential White House employees, a task done by the FBI, nor did it keep the regular personnel files of employees, which were held in a different office within the White House. Rather, its role was {{to keep track of}} who was employed by the White House, make sure their security clearances were up to date, and give security briefings to new hires. [...] Nevertheless, Livingstone seemed to lack qualifications for even this position; he had worked on a number of Democratic Party campaigns and transitions, including being an advance man for the Clinton-Gore 1992 campaign, and his only prior job in the [...] "security" [...] field was that of a local bar bouncer at a Washington, D.C., night club. (At the congressional hearings, Livingstone objected to [...] "false and unfair caricatures <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> [...] I have worked hard for little or no pay in political campaigns for candidates who I felt would make this country a better place to live." [...] In later years Livingstone would continue to maintain on the internet that he had been qualified for the position, that the First Lady had signed off on hiring him, and that his character had been maligned by the general media). Clinton opponents stated that Livingstone had the highest level of security clearances in the U.S. government. White House officials could not explain why Livingstone was hired, nor who had hired him.|$|E

500|$|In September 2000, {{she joined}} the ABT Studio Company, which is ABT's second company, and {{became a member of}} its Corps de ballet in 2001. As part of the Studio Company, she {{performed}} the Pas de Deux in Tchaikovsky's The Sleeping Beauty. Eight months after joining the company, she was sidelined for nearly a year by a lumbar stress fracture. When Copeland joined the company, she weighed [...] (she is [...] tall). At age 19, her puberty had been delayed, a situation common in ballet dancers. After the lumbar fracture, her doctor told her that inducing puberty would help to strengthen her bones, and he prescribed birth control pills. Copeland recalls that in one month she gained 10 pounds, and her small breasts swelled to double D-cup size: [...] "Leotards had to be altered for me ... to cover my cleavage, for instance. I hated this sign that I was different from the others. ... I became so self-conscious that, {{for the first time in}} my life, I couldn’t dance strong. I was too busy trying to hide my breasts." [...] Management noticed and called her in to talk about her body. The professional pressure to conform to conventional ballet aesthetics resulted in body image struggles and a binge eating disorder. Copeland says that, over the next year, new friendships outside of ABT, including with Victoria Rowell and her boyfriend, Olu Evans, helped her to regain confidence in her body. She explained, [...] "My curves became an integral part <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> as a dancer, not something I needed to lose to become one. I started dancing with confidence and joy, and soon the staff at ABT began giving me positive feedback again. And I think I changed everyone’s mind about what a perfect dancer is supposed to look like." [...] During her years in the corps, as the only Black woman in the company, Copeland also felt the burden of her ethnicity in many ways and contemplated a variety of career choices. Recognizing that Copeland's isolation and self-doubt were standing in the way of her talent, ABT's artistic director, Kevin McKenzie, asked writer and arts figure Susan Fales-Hill, then vice-chair of ABT's Board of Directors, to mentor Copeland. Fales-Hill introduced Copeland to Black women trailblazers who encouraged Copeland and helped her to gain perspective.|$|E
