5|$|Mary's {{death on}} 28 December 1694 (O.S.) {{eventually}} led to a formal but cool reconciliation between WilliamIII and Anne, now heir to the throne. Marlborough hoped that the rapprochement would lead to his own return to office, but although he and Lady Marlborough were {{allowed to return to}} court, the Earl received no <b>offer</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nefarious explores how sex {{trafficking}} {{differs from}} country to country, and suggests that all the victims are both psychologically and emotionally enslaved. One of the initial assertions in the film is that slavery has not been abolished but is increasing, and that half of this slavery is sexual in nature. Nefarious identifies political corruption and difficult socioeconomic situations as elements that prevent sex slaves from escaping exploitation, and suggests that most victims do not survive {{for more than seven}} years after initially being trafficked. While the violent acquisition of sex slaves depicted in the first sequence of the film does occur in reality, Jimmy Stewart of Charisma wrote that most girls who are sexually trafficked in Europe are recruited through a fraudulent <b>offer</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> and an improved lifestyle overseas, neither of which ultimately materializes in the new country.|$|E
5|$|A December 2007 QSR Magazine {{article about}} the {{conflict}} claimed that Burger King Brands had devised a contingency plan to remove itself from the dispute. Citing internal company documents, the Associated Press stated BK had concerns that such agreements might {{prove to be a}} possible violation of anti-trust laws, had possible tax implications, and that there were issues with third-party oversight for the agreements. As part of the company's plan, QSR Magazine claimed that the company was going to cease purchasing product from suppliers with whom the CIW was in disagreement. In response, the company issued a press release in February 2007 claiming that while it is a large purchaser, it is not responsible for the pay rates of it suppliers' workers as wage disputes are the province of the producer. BK also pointed out that it has an open <b>offer</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> for any dissatisfied CIW members and scholarships (through its Have it Your Way Foundation) for family members of CIW workers.|$|E

5|$|Sonya gives Rodya a cross {{when he goes}} to turn {{himself in}} and symbolizes the burden Raskolnikov must bear. Sonya tells him they will bear the cross {{together}} and is taking part of his burden onto herself, encouraging him to confess. Sonya and Lizaveta had exchanged crosses, so originally the cross was Lizaveta's—whom Rodya didn't intend to kill, making it an important symbol of redemption. Sonya's face reminds him of Lizaveta's face, another example of his guilty conscience and symbolizes a shared grief. Self-sacrifice, along with poverty, is a larger theme of the novel. The desperation of poverty creates a situation where the only way to survive is through self-sacrifice, which Raskolnikov consistently rejects, as part of his philosophical reasoning. For example, he rejects Razumikhin's <b>offer</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> and the idea of his sister's arranged marriage. Raskolnikov originally rejects Sonya's offer to accompany him to the confession but, in a feverish state of mind, sees her following him through the market, and finds power in that idealism.|$|E
5|$|When his {{apprenticeship}} {{ended in}} 1847, Evans, then 21, refused an <b>offer</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> from Landells, deciding instead {{to go into}} business for himself as a wood-engraver and colour printer. In 1848 Evans engraved a title-page illustration, among other commissions, for the Illustrated London News. However, the Illustrated London News stopped employing him {{on the basis that}} his wood engraving was too fine for newspaper work. His final print for the Illustrated London News showed the four seasons, and was illustrated by Foster. In fact Foster received his first commission from the publisher Ingram, Cook, and Company to reproduce the four scenes in oil. In 1851, Ingram chose Evans to engrave three prints for Ida Pfeiffer's Travels in the Holy Land. He used three blocks for the work: the key-block, outlining the illustration, was printed in a dark-brown hue; the other two were in a buff colour and a grayish-blue colour. For the same firm, Evans completed an order for a book-cover using bright reds and blues on white paper. That year he received the first commission to print a book, written by Fanny Fern and illustrated by Foster. Evans had enough business to apprentice his two younger brothers, Wilfred and Herbert, and to buy a hand-press. Soon he moved his premises to Racquet Court, and bought three more hand-presses.|$|E

50|$|Generalist {{candidates}} who receive official <b>offers</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> must attend a 6-week training/orientation course known as A-100 at the Foreign Service Institute (FSI) in Arlington, VA.

25|$|On a hot, early August day {{sometime}} in the late 1930s, eight people arrive on a small, isolated island off the Devon coast of England. Each appears to have an invitation tailored {{to his or her}} personal circumstances, such as an <b>offer</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> or an unexpected late summer holiday. They are met by Thomas and Ethel Rogers, the butler and cook/housekeeper, who state that their hosts, Mr Ulick Norman Owen and his wife Mrs Una Nancy Owen, whom they have not yet met in person, have not arrived, but left instructions, which strikes all the guests as odd.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Simon and Sharon's {{relationship}} continues. Sharon makes {{plans to}} buy The Vic and run it with Simon. However, Simon finds this commitment daunting; he starts pining for Cindy and develops paternal feelings towards his son. Simon and Cindy resume their affair and when Ian finds out, he becomes obsessed with breaking them up and ruining Simon's life. Simon is accused of theft from The Queen Vic when marked notes are found in his pocket; however, it is Ian who planted them. When Simon loses his job he accepts Ian's <b>offer</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> at his catering company, where Ian attempts to frame him for theft. When this fails, Ian tries to kill Simon by sabotaging the brakes of the van he is driving on Christmas Day 1990. Realising that Ian will not stop the feud, Simon, Cindy and Steven leave Walford {{to start a new}} life together the following day.|$|E

Fortunately, Segrè had been given an <b>offer</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> in Tulsa, Oklahoma, by two European expatriates who were looking for an expert on neutron physics.

500|$|A {{phone call}} {{during the summer}} of 1996 from Barcelona {{vice-president}} Joan Gaspart to discuss Luís Figo resulted in an <b>offer</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> with the Spanish club. Robson took over in July 1996, where again his assistant was Mourinho; Robson had made Mourinho's move with him to the Camp Nou a condition of his employment. One of the key decisions Robson made during his brief tenure at Barcelona was the US$19.5million signing of Ronaldo, who was influential in a season when Barcelona won the Copa del Rey, Supercopa de España and European Cup Winners' Cup. Robson himself was voted European Manager of the Year for 1996–97, while Ronaldo stated, [...] "as a trainer without doubt [...] {{is one of the greatest}} in the world".|$|E
2500|$|The {{decision}} to leave academia was difficult for Carothers. At first he refused DuPont's <b>offer</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment,</b> explaining that [...] "I suffer from neurotic spells of diminished capacity which might constitute a much more serious handicap there than here." [...] In spite of this admission, a DuPont executive, Hamilton Bradshaw, traveled to Harvard and convinced Carothers to change his mind. His salary was $500 a month as compared with only $267 at Harvard ($3200 per year).|$|E
50|$|The Zebra was {{the third}} ship after the Bengalee and Prince George that brought Prussian Lutheran {{migrants}} to South Australia.

[...] Ghiselin apparently remained in Ferrara until 1505, when both he and Josquin fled {{the outbreak of the}} plague there; Jacob Obrecht, who had recently joined the spectacular musical establishment at the Estense court, remained behind, and succumbed to the contagion in July 1505.|$|E
2500|$|Nine {{days after}} the murder of Sean King, Bonin invited an 18-year-old {{homeless}} drifter named James Michael Munro {{to move into the}} apartment he shared with his mother. Munro had been evicted from his family's home in his native Michigan in early 1980 and had been living rough on the streets of Hollywood for several weeks. As such, Munro readily accepted Bonin's accommodation offer. As had earlier been the case with Gregory Miley, Munro—a bisexual who preferred sexual relations with females—also began a consensual sexual relationship with Bonin. He also accepted a subsequent <b>offer</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> at the Montebello delivery firm where Bonin worked. Munro later described his initial impression of Bonin as being [...] "a good guy; really normal", although on the evening of June 1, Bonin abruptly informed Munro he wanted the two of them to abduct, rape, and kill a teenage hitchhiker.|$|E
2500|$|Hobbs' {{father had}} a great love of cricket and his {{performances}} playing for a short-lived club formed by him and his colleagues led to an <b>offer</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> as a professional cricketer at Fenner's, the cricket ground of Cambridge University. His main duties were umpiring matches {{on the ground and}} bowling in the cricket nets to undergraduates. Although the pay was poor, Hobbs senior was happy to have achieved his lifetime ambition of a career in cricket. In 1889, he was appointed to the more prestigious position of groundsman and umpire at Jesus College, where Hobbs junior was able to watch cricket practice and occasionally become involved, although he received little formal coaching from his father, who was reluctant to exploit his position. Nevertheless, Hobbs soon acquired a love of cricket from his father. Hobbs later claimed that his father rarely coached him, but his mother once recounted that Hobbs senior [...] "trained him carefully since he was old enough to hold a bat". From an early age, Hobbs played cricket whenever he could and his first games were played in the streets near his house. He and his father frequently discussed the game and Hobbs closely followed local cricket.|$|E
