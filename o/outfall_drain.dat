In 1953, construction began on the Main <b>Outfall</b> <b>Drain,</b> {{also known as the}} Third River, which would drain water from the Central Marshes through a canal and eventually into the Persian Gulf. Construction on the Nasiriyah Drainage Pump Station, which would serve to pump the water to a siphon under the Euphrates, did not begin until 1983. A Brazilian contractor worked on the pump station until 1986 when political upheaval forced a construction halt. Construction continued in 1992, the same year the MOD was completed, but was intermittent until 1999 because of flooding and structural failures. Aside from agriculture, the MOD was viewed as a tool for Saddam Hussein to drain the Central Marshes in order to deny a refuge for Shia Muslims after the 1991 uprisings in Iraq.After the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers awarded Washington International Inc. a $78 million contract to complete the pump station. The original contract had included digging out the moth-balled pump station along with installing the internal electronic system, nine of the pumps, gates, and completing a major portion of the concrete siphon. Construction began again in August 2005 but problems with concrete and electrical components put the project over budget at $80 million. The increased costs led the Corps of Engineers and U.S. Government to terminate construction at 70% completion and transfer the project to the Government of Iraq. After the Iraq Government agreed, it was transitioned to their control on March 1, 2007. Later, in June 2007, Iraq's Ministry of Water Resources signed grant agreement for $20 million in U.S. funding that would help complete the pump station. The pump station opened on December 1, 2008 and was eventually completed in February 2009 but was originally projected to be completed on December 31, 2007.|$|E

40|$|Princess Royal Harbour (PRH) and Oyster Harbour (CH) are {{adjacent}} embayments on {{the south}} coast of Western Australia. Both harbours have received similar long-term nutrient loadings although the sources are different; inputs into PRH are primarily from industry, agriculture and community whereas most nutrients enter CH via agricultural runoff in river discharge. In both harbours prolific growth of algae has resulted in widespread dieback of seagrass meadows {{as a result of}} shading and smothering. PRH contains about ten times the macroalgal biomass of OH and biological, chemical and photic factors do not appear to completely explain this anomaly. A comparison of physical measurements of the density structure in PRH and OH suggests that the contrasting hydrodynamic characteristics of these systems play dominant roles in controlling their ecological status. PRH receives nutrient inputs all year round from <b>outfalls</b> and <b>drains,</b> receives no river discharge, has weak stratification and is typically well-mixed with circulation governed by barotropic wind and tide-forced currents; residence times for nutrients are relatively large. In contrast, OH receives nutrient-rich freshwater from two rivers in winter and is salt-wedge in nature. Baroclinic transport in OH is effective in flushing nutrients in surface waters to the ocean over relatively short time scales and the stratification may restrict nutrient availability by inhibiting downward transport to the benthos. Thus, differential nutrient availability as a result of dissimilar physical processes is postulated to explain the different ecological response of these two embayments to nutrient enrichment. A Wedderburn number classification scheme clarifies the hydrodynamic response of the two systems to meteorological forcings and supports the conclusion that the eutrophication response of estuaries is strongly correlated with the strength and persistence of density stratification...|$|R

In this study, a reverse osmosis (RO) system for brackish water desalination was theoretically investigated to produce both potable drinking and agricultural water with a lower overall and specific energy consumption. As a case study, the Main <b>Outfall</b> <b>Drain</b> in Iraq is used as the brackish water source. A numerical model based on solution-diffusion theory was developed in Matlab Simulink and used to analyse the design and performance of an RO system. The effect of feed water temperature, pressure, salinity and recovery ratio on {{the efficiency of the}} whole RO system was investigated {{for a wide range of}} design considerations. The design of an RO system for this application was optimised and economic assessment carried out. Results show that with boosting recovery ratio from 30 % to 60 %, the specific energy of desalinated water production below 400 ppm was reduced from 2. 8 kWh/m 3 to a more economically favourable value of 0. 8 kWh/m 3, when utilizing a pressure exchanger as a recovery device. Salt rejection was reduced from 97 % to 88 % to obtain large quantities of water for irrigation with an acceptable salinity (< 1600 ppm), for agricultural use. The reduction in salt rejection is influenced by the feed water temperature and pressure; also the average pore diameter of the RO membrane and in turn determines the reduction in system energy consumption. It was found that the total cost to produce 24, 000 m 3 /d of water from a feed salinity of 15, 000 ppm and a water quality of < 400 ppm would be 0. 11 £/m 3 with a corresponding investment cost of £ 14. 4 million for the drinking water, and for irrigation) obtained product < 1600 ppm) are £ 0. 9 /m 3 and £ 11. 3 million...|$|E
40|$|The {{concentrations}} of chromium, copper, iron, manganese, nickel, lead, and zinc have been estimated, primarily by flame AAS, in the sediments of the City <b>Outfall</b> <b>Drain</b> and Avon-Heathcote Estuary, Christchurch, New Zealand. These, and other metals {{have also been}} determined by XRF, and {{the two sets of}} results are compared. Sediment samples were obtained by the use of a simple coring device where possible, or by sampling the top two centimetres of sediment where this was not possible. The variation in metal concentration with location, depth, and rainfall are discussed, with reference to metal-metal correlations, organic matter content, particle size distribution, and a theory on the formation of the sediment units in the Avon-Heathcote Estuary. These results are then evaluated with regard to enrichment factors calculated from a set of local background levels defined in this study. The strongest metal-metal correlation is lead with zinc, although lead, zinc, copper, {{and to a lesser extent}} chromium, are commonly found in association with one another. Metal concentration generally decreases with depth, except in the case of the estuary core RH 2, which exhibits a profile of concentration vs. depth consistent with MacPherson's proposals for the formation of the Estuaries sediment units. Lead and zinc are found to be the metals most highly enriched above background levels in the clay, then sand, then silt fractions. No obvious reason for this was found as for all other metals, including those that correlated well with lead and zinc, the order was clay > silt > sand. The distribution of metal concentrations in the silt-clay size fraction wre investigated using a novel technique not requiring the separation of individual size fractions. The percentage of quartz present in each fraction was found to be the primary factor causing variation in metal concentration down to approximately 4 μm. Below this size metal speciation becomes dominant. The role of organic matter was not determined but is felt to be of possible significance. The thesis concludes with recommendations for areas of further research, including sediment dating, application of sequential extraction techniques, and a possible method of treatment for waste waters...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to assess the water {{resources}} and water conveyance system of the western part of the Mesopotamian marshes (Al-Hammar marsh) as well as develop a water conveyance system to distribute water throughout the western Al-Hammar marsh. These processes are significant to identify the current restoration problems and help to create restoration strategies for the marsh. Also, proper management strategy to the Al-Hammar marsh is necessary to preserve the marsh ecosystem, irrigate lands, and provide domestic necessities in the villages. The overall project is divided into three main chapters which address the current ecological and hydrological issues in the western Al-Hammar marsh. Chapter 1 assesses the water used in the restoration of the western Al-Hammar after 2003. Chapter 1 also provides updated calculations concerning the water balance and the water needed for the planned restoration which promotes more efficient water management for the marsh. Chapter 2 looks at the current condition of the water conveyance system in the western Al-Hammar in order to identify its problems, such as water loss, hydraulic problems, and inefficiency. Creating a high efficiency distribution system for the water supply will increase the rate of inundation and promote better management of surface water resources as well as obtain benefits for agricultural irrigation. Chapter 3 discusses how the restoration could be improved with current available surface water resources using multiple feeding points instead several feeder canals, which improves the health of the marsh and rehabilitate the area. The results of the water balance have showed a deficit in water supplied to the marsh, even using the drainage water from the Main <b>Outfall</b> <b>Drain</b> (MOD), due to the high evapotranspiration (ET) and limited surface water resources, which do not have a constant flow to the marsh. The feeder canals are not efficient enough to supply water for both irrigation and restoration purposes in their current condition.

Improving the feeder canals by creating a lined network of irrigation canals serve both the farmland and increase the restoration of the marsh...|$|E

Most Mariut lacustrine subfacies that date back to the last century me similar to those in modern Nile Delta lagoons (Idku, Burullus, Manzala), and also to older lagoon deposits examined in Holocene core sections. During this century, the lake has become artificially separated into three distinct regions, each with different petrologic attributes. These differences are a function of both natural and man-influenced factors in the three settings: sabkha-desert conditions prevail in the topographically most isolated western sector southwest of Alexandria; totally enclosed artificial salt ponds in the central sector, south of Alexandria's industrial complex, into which waters are pumped from the sea; and much lower salinity sub-basins in ea. tern Mariut which receive large, amounts of fresh water, much of it polluted, through a series of canals, sewage <b>outfalls</b> and <b>drains.</b> With time, there have been lake-wide changes such as decreased proportions of benthic fauna, including molluscs.

The objective of this research was to identify appropriate solutions within the limited scope of technical and financial feasibility with reference to Alexandra west bank as a case study area. The findings show that three physical site conditions hamper the application of onsite drainage approaches in Alexandra west bank Township, the case study area. They are: Congestion, due to haphazard development patterns, High drainage flow generation resulting from high population densities and the predominantly impermeable surface area due to intensive site development, and Poorly draining soils Congestion, high densities and intensive site development are characteristics common to low-income settlements in South Africa, and they result in lack of space availability for storage facilities, and interference with nature’s ability to retard, retain and infiltrate significant quantities of the storm runoff flows. Poor soil drainage capabilities, which is more specific to study area would result in a slow rate of exfiltration of drainage flows that would in turn cause ponding and the associated health hazards. Estimates of drainage flows generated from the study area as determined from field observations, flow measurements and computer simulation techniques indicate that if the minimum rate of production of just the wastewater component of the drainage flows is taken, which is approximately 37 m 3 /ha/day, it exceeds the rate recommended for safe onsite management of drainage flows by almost four times. Three off-site drainage system arrangements were compared {{on the basis of the}} cost of <b>outfall</b> pipe <b>drains</b> sized according to conservative design procedures, and it was found that the combined sullage and storm water drains with separate sewage (black water) drainage system arrangement is more economical than the commonly practiced approach of separate storm and combined sewage and sullage drainage system arrangement...|$|R
