5|$|Acting {{also plays}} a key role in Szabó’s films, as he values {{psychological}} complexity in his central characters. In his first several features, he tended to use the same lead actors over and over—first András Bálint, then Klaus Maria Brandauer. Consistent with this focus on acting, he frequently employs long close-up shots to emphasize the play <b>of</b> <b>emotions</b> on the faces of his characters.|$|E

Previous studies have tended to assess the expression <b>of</b> <b>emotion</b> in CG, but other aspects <b>of</b> <b>emotion</b> (mainly emotion recognition, and the subjective aspects <b>of</b> <b>emotion)</b> have not been addressed, despite their importance for practicing clinicians. A quasi-experimental design with two matched groups (Complicated Grief, N D 24 and Non-Complicated Grief, N D 20) was carried out. The Facial Expression <b>of</b> <b>Emotion</b> Test (emotion recognition), a set of pictures from the International Affective Picture System (subjective experience <b>of</b> <b>emotion)</b> and the Symptom Checklist 90 Revised (psychopathology) were employed. The CG group showed lower scores on the dimension of valence for specific conditions on the IAPS, related to the subjective experience <b>of</b> <b>emotion.</b> In addition, they presented higher values of psychopathology. In contrast, statistically significant results were not found for the recognition <b>of</b> <b>emotion.</b> In conclusion, from a neuropsychological point of view, the subjective aspects <b>of</b> <b>emotion</b> and psychopathology seem central in explaining the experience of those with CG.

5|$|Reported neuropsychiatric manifestations are anxiety, depression, {{a reduced}} display <b>of</b> <b>emotions</b> (blunted affect), egocentrism, aggression, and {{compulsive}} behavior, {{the latter of}} which can cause or worsen addictions, including alcoholism, gambling, and hypersexuality. Difficulties in recognizing other people's negative expressions have also been observed. The prevalence of these symptoms is highly variable between studies, with estimated rates for lifetime prevalence of psychiatric disorders between 33% and 76%. For many sufferers and their families, these symptoms {{are among the most}} distressing aspects of the disease, often affecting daily functioning and constituting reason for institutionalization. Suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts are more common than in the general population. Often individuals have reduced awareness of chorea, cognitive and emotional impairments.|$|E

5|$|There are {{potential}} problems when the MSE is applied in a cross-cultural context, when the clinician and patient are from different cultural backgrounds. For example, the patient's culture might have different norms for appearance, behavior and display <b>of</b> <b>emotions.</b> Culturally normative spiritual and religious beliefs {{need to be}} distinguished from delusions and hallucinations - these may seem similar to one who does not understand that they have different roots. Cognitive assessment must also take the patient's language and educational background into account. Clinician's racial bias is another potential confounder.|$|E
5|$|As {{the son of}} {{the filmmaker}} Rakesh, Roshan faced the media {{spotlight}} from a young age. Discussing nepotism in Bollywood, Shama Rana views him as one of several actors who managed film careers with the help of family relations in the industry. On the other hand, Roshan is acknowledged in the media {{as one of the most}} talented Indian actors of his generation, for his devotion to his work and for his ability to commit heavily to each role. He insists on learning any necessary skills and performing stunts himself, and is particularly known for his professionalism. The director Ashutosh Gowariker praised Roshan when he continued filming Mohenjo Daro despite several injuries and being in a troubled state of mind. Zoya Akhtar, who considers Roshan her favourite actor, and directed him in Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, remarks on his ability to display a range <b>of</b> <b>emotions</b> on screen.|$|E
5|$|During the Enlightenment and its {{debates about}} human origins, it became fashionable to {{speculate}} {{about the origin of}} language. Thinkers such as Rousseau and Herder argued that language had originated in the instinctive expression <b>of</b> <b>emotions,</b> and that it was originally closer to music and poetry than to the logical expression of rational thought. Rationalist philosophers such as Kant and Descartes held the opposite view. Around the turn of the 20th century, thinkers began to wonder about the role of language in shaping our experiences of the world– asking whether language simply reflects the objective structure of the world, or whether it creates concepts that it in turn imposes on our experience of the objective world. This led {{to the question of whether}} philosophical problems are really firstly linguistic problems. The resurgence of the view that language plays a significant role in the creation and circulation of concepts, and that the study of philosophy is essentially the study of language, is associated with what has been called the linguistic turn and philosophers such as Wittgenstein in 20th-century philosophy. These debates about language in relation to meaning and reference, cognition and consciousness remain active today.|$|E

5|$|Gabbar Singh, the film's antagonist, {{was well}} {{received}} by the audience, despite his pervasive sadistic cruelty. Dissanayake explains that the audience {{was fascinated by the}} dialogues and mannerisms of the character, and this element of spectacle outweighed his actions, a first for Indian melodrama. He notes that the picturisation of violence in the film was glamourised and uninhibited. He further notes that, unlike earlier melodramas in which the female body occupies the audience's attention as an object of male fetish, in Sholay, the male body becomes the centrepiece. It becomes the battleground where good and evil compete for supremacy. Dissanayake argues that Sholay {{can be viewed as a}} national allegory: it lacks a comforting logical narrative, it shows social stability being repeatedly challenged, and it shows the devaluation of human life resulting from a lack <b>of</b> <b>emotions.</b> Taken together, these elements comprise the allegorical representation of India. The narrative style of Sholay, with its violence, revenge, and vigilante action, is occasionally compared by scholars to the political unrest in India at the time of its release. This tension culminated in the Emergency (rule by decree) declared by prime minister Indira Gandhi in 1975.|$|E

5|$|The male {{actors were}} asked to grow their hair and moustaches. The actors also had to diet to lose weight to achieve the look of World War II characters. The costumes had a faded look, a {{reflection}} that people of the period owned few clothes, often only two outfits. None of the actors knew the script in advance and were only informed each night before {{of what they were}} to do in their daily scenes. The Romani were not aware of the historic events that were the basis of the movie, and were only told that the story was set in hard times comparable to Ceaușescu's tenure in Romania. In the scene where the Romani revolt against the police over the death of Taloche, they were made aware of the character's death only when the scene was being shot, leading to a genuine outpouring <b>of</b> <b>emotions,</b> making their fight with the police appear more real. Gatlif later remarked in an interview that this scene stands for the actual revolt by the Romani in Auschwitz on May 16, 1944.|$|E
50|$|A {{dominant}} theory <b>of</b> <b>emotion</b> <b>of</b> Cannon's {{time was}} the James-Lange theory <b>of</b> <b>emotion,</b> and Cannon recognized that to test this theory, an examination of emotional expression with no visceral afferent feedback was required.

To do so, Cannon experimented with severing afferent nerves of the sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system in cats. Cannon compiled his experimental results in 1915, then refined and expanded them, and finally proposed his model <b>of</b> <b>emotion</b> as a challenge and alternative to the James-Lange theory <b>of</b> <b>emotion.</b>|$|R

40|$|The concept <b>of</b> <b>emotion</b> dysregulation {{has been}} {{integrated}} into theory and treatment for borderline personality disorder (BPD), despite limited empirical support. Expanding upon existing {{research on the}} relationship between emotion dysregulation and BPD, the present study utilized a multimodal approach to the assessment <b>of</b> <b>emotion</b> dysregulation (including two behavioral measures of the willingness to tolerate emotional distress, and a self-report measure <b>of</b> <b>emotion</b> dysregulation broadly defined) {{to examine the relationship between}} emotion dysregulation and BPD among inner-city substance users in residential treatment (n = 76, with 25 meeting criteria for BPD). Results provide laboratory-based evidence for heightened emotion dysregulation in BPD, extending extant research on BPD to underserved clinical populations. Specifically, the presence of a BPD diagnosis among a sample of inner-city inpatient substance users was associated with both higher scores on the self-report measure <b>of</b> <b>emotion</b> dysregulation and less willingness to tolerate emotional distress on the behavioral measures <b>of</b> <b>emotion</b> dysregulation. Moreover, both self-report and behavioral measures <b>of</b> <b>emotion</b> dysregulation accounted for unique variance in BPD status, suggesting the importance of utilizing comprehensive assessments <b>of</b> <b>emotion</b> dysregulation within studies of BPD.
