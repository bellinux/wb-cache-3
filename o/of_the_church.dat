5|$|According to Armando Maya Castro, many {{students}} who are members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> have been discriminated against for refusing to partake in celebrations and customs concerning the Day of the Dead in their schools, and some have been punished for it. In one case reported by a Mexican newspaper, La Gaceta, a female member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> was pushed by a fellow bus passenger, who then crossed herself because the member was wearing a long skirt. In July 25, 2008, a public official sealed {{the entrance to a}} La Luz del Mundo temple in Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco, trapping the congregation inside until other officials removed the seals. This incident occurred because of complaints from individuals who did not like the presence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> in the area.

Later, there were not enough funds to maintain the church, which left the maintaining <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> to private and voluntary funds, such as Andrey Muraviov.|$|E

5|$|At {{the very}} {{beginning}} of his reign, he deemed it proper to promulgate by law the Church's belief in the Trinity and the Incarnation; and to threaten all heretics with the appropriate penalties; whereas he subsequently declared that he intended to deprive all disturbers of orthodoxy of the opportunity for such offense by due process of law. He made the Nicaeno-Constantinopolitan creed the sole symbol <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> and accorded legal force to the canons of the four ecumenical councils. The bishops in attendance at the Second Council of Constantinople in 553 recognized that nothing could be done in the Church contrary to the emperor's will and command, while, on his side, the emperor, {{in the case of the}} Patriarch Anthimus, reinforced the ban <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> with temporal proscription. Justinian protected the purity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> by suppressing heretics. He neglected no opportunity for securing the rights <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> and clergy, for protecting and extending monasticism. He granted the monks the right to inherit property from private citizens and the right to receive solemnia or annual gifts from the Imperial treasury or from the taxes of certain provinces and he prohibited lay confiscation of monastic estates.|$|E

5|$|During {{this time}} the church at Llanbadarn Fawr {{gradually}} declined, as the population of Aberystwyth dramatically outgrew the original settlement, {{and more and more}} chapels of ease became independent parish churches.

Unfortunately, although necessary, this work also swept away much of the detail of the interior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church.</b> Today, apart from the Celtic crosses and the baptismal font there is nothing mediaeval or even early modern; most of what is visible today is nineteenth century, apart from the structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church,</b> and some earlier monuments.|$|E
