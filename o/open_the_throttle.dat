500|$|According to the Smithsonian, Roper's first {{velocipede}} of 1867–1869 used {{a purpose}} built frame rather than adapting an existing velocipede frame by retrofitting a steam engine, but one contemporary newspaper account does assert that Roper repurposed a velocipede frame, and Setright and motoring author Roland Brown say Roper used a hickory wood frame {{built by the}} Hanlon Brothers, who made and demonstrated boneshakers at fairs and circuses, although the Smithsonian's Roper has an iron frame. It had a wheelbase of [...] and two [...] diameter wheels made of iron bands on wooden s with wooden spokes. It had a rigid, forged iron fork, and a solid handlebar with wooden grips. Unlike the modern twistgrip, where the grip on only one side is a sleeve that rotates around the handlebar to <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>throttle,</b> the Roper velocipede's entire bar was rotated with both hands, {{and it had a}} dual function. When turned forward, the throttle opened, and when turned backwards it applied the spoon brake on the front wheel. The seat doubled as the water reservoir; or the water tank can be described as saddle shaped. A hand pump transferred water from this tank to the boiler. The boiler was between the wheels with a [...] "nautical looking" [...] chimney from the boiler angling backwards behind the rider, with the firebox in the lower half of this housing, all of which hung from the frame with a spring to absorb shock, while two stay rods attached the bottom of the housing {{to the back of the}} frame.

The two cylinders, with bores of about [...] were located on either side of the frame, from the upper part of the boiler near the chimney, connecting to [...] cranks on the rear wheel. Exhaust steam, conveyed by tubing to the base of the chimney, provided a forced draft.|$|E

5000|$|In 2004, the NHTSA {{launched}} a probe of throttle control systems on around 1 million Lexus and Toyota sedans. [...] Upon that probe, Toyota urged the NHTSA {{to define the}} issues as quick bursts where the engine surged to [...] "something less than a wide-open throttle." [...] The company compared the complaints to previous sudden unintended acceleration cases the NHTSA deemed [...] "driver error."

50|$|An ALS {{requires}} an air bypass, generally done {{in one of}} two ways. The first method is to use a throttle air bypass; this may be an external bypass valve or a solenoid valve which <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> <b>throttle</b> 12-20 degrees. This allows air to bypass <b>the</b> closed <b>throttle</b> and to reach the engine. The second method is to use a bypass valve which feeds charge air directly to the exhaust manifold.|$|R

50|$|A {{design feature}} once {{found in some}} General Motors {{automatic}} transmissions was the variable-pitch stator, in which the blades' angle of attack could be varied in response to changes in engine speed and load. The effect of this was to vary the amount of torque multiplication produced by the converter. At the normal angle of attack, the stator caused the converter to produce a moderate amount of multiplication but with {{a higher level of}} efficiency. If <b>the</b> driver abruptly <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>throttle,</b> a valve would switch the stator pitch to a different angle of attack, increasing torque multiplication at the expense of efficiency.|$|R
50|$|At the time, the Airbus A320 is {{relatively}} new, having just been launched in 1988. Most pilots {{stated that the}} system of the aircraft was different than any other aircraft. The essential difference was that the A320 used the fly-by-wire (FBW) technology. In a conventional aircraft the pilot was in direct contact with the actuator; so if <b>the</b> pilot <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>throttle</b> more, <b>the</b> actuator immediately gave the pilot more power. But in the A320 the pilot’s command was first directed to an on-board computer — and the actuator responded only when the computer determined that it is okay to do so.|$|R
50|$|This {{very small}} car {{originated}} as a fairground Dodgem and was electrically powered. In 1934, the designer Jack Shillan changed {{the engine to}} a 98 cc Villiers Midget single-cylinder engine and sold it for road use. The transmission was single speed and operated by a single pedal which <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>throttle</b> on being pressed down and applied the brake when released. The clutch was automatic. There were no springs. Drive was {{to one of the}} rear wheels and the single brake operated on the other. It was said to be capable of reaching 15 mph (25 km/h). <b>The</b> body was <b>open</b> and had a single seat.|$|R
5000|$|Electronic {{throttle}} control (ETC) is an automobile technology which electronically [...] "connects" [...] the accelerator {{pedal to the}} throttle, replacing a mechanical linkage. [...] A typical ETC system consists of three major components: (i) an accelerator pedal module (ideally with two or more independent sensors), (ii) a throttle valve that can be opened and closed by an electric motor (sometimes referred to as an electric or electronic throttle body (ETB)), and (iii) a powertrain or engine control module (PCM or ECM). The ECM {{is a type of}} electronic control unit (ECU), which is an embedded system that employs software to determine the required throttle position by calculations from data measured by other sensors, including the accelerator pedal position sensors, engine speed sensor, vehicle speed sensor, and cruise control switches. The electric motor is then used to <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>throttle</b> valve to the desired angle via a closed-loop control algorithm within the ECM.|$|E
50|$|A {{supercharger}} compresses the air back to sea-level-equivalent pressures, or even much higher, {{in order}} to make the engine produce just as much power at cruise altitude as it does at sea level. With the reduced aerodynamic drag at high altitude and the engine still producing rated power, a supercharged airplane can fly much faster at altitude than a naturally aspirated one. The pilot controls the output of the supercharger with the throttle and indirectly via the propeller governor control. Since the size of the supercharger is chosen to produce a given amount of pressure at high altitude, the supercharger is oversized for low altitude. The pilot must be careful with the throttle and watch the manifold pressure gauge to avoid overboosting at low altitude. As the aircraft climbs and the air density drops, the pilot must continuously <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>throttle</b> in small increments to maintain full power. The altitude at which the throttle reaches full open and the engine is still producing full rated power is known as the critical altitude. Above the critical altitude, engine power output will start to drop as the aircraft continues to climb.|$|E

40|$|A V-type engine with a bi-turbocharger {{configuration}} utilizes {{the exhaust}} energy well which gives a fast torque response. An unwanted instability, called co-surge, {{can occur in}} such engines where the two interconnected compressors alternately go into flow reversals. If co-surge occurs, the control system must quell the oscillations with as little disturbance in engine torque as possible. A model of a bi-turbocharged engine is presented, combining a mean value engine model and a Moore-Greizer compressor model for surge. The model is validated against measurements on a vehicle dynamometer, showing that it captures the frequency and amplitude of the co-surge oscillation. The model is used to develop detection and control strategies for co-surge that rapidly returns the turbo to a stable operating point. Both simulations and experimental evaluation on the vehicle show that the developed strategies are successful in rapidly detecting and quelling co-surge. The selection of actuators is also studied. With no or small pressure drops over the throttle, {{it is necessary to}} use the bypass valves. However, for operating conditions with moderate and high pressure drops over the throttle, it is shown that it is sufficient to only <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>throttle.</b> This has the advantage, compared to opening the bypass valves, that it reduces the drop in boost pressure and thus reduces the drop in engine torque...|$|E
40|$|Correlations {{between the}} {{coefficient}} of variations (COV) of ion current integrals and COV of indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) are investigated. The investigations are made {{to see if there}} is a possibility to use ion sense technique for closed loop combustion control to maximize Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) level with remaining combustion stability. The engine studied in this thesis is a stoichiometric natural gas engine with a three way catalyst working with different EGR levels. One way to increase the efficiency in a stoichiometric natural gas engine is to maximize the EGR level [3]. With a higher EGR level it is possible to <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>throttle</b> even further with a result of lower pumping losses. Also temperature losses to chamber walls will be smaller with high EGR levels. A closed loop system controlling the EGR valve against COV of IMEP around 5 % is used for this engine. For COV of flame peak integral in range from 0 to 15 - 20 % of COV of IMEP a linear correlation was found for lambda less than 1. 3. For COV of two peaks integral a linear correlation was found for the entire measured range. This correlation may not be used for a robust EGR control system due to a small increase of COV of ion integral and due to a high variance in COV of ion integral. Correlations are discussed for different ion integrals with different air/fuels ratios and EGR levels. A control strategy is also presented...|$|E

50|$|The stator {{element of}} the torque {{converter}} has two blade positions, controlled by the driver via the accelerator pedal to offer a 'passing gear' and extra response at any speed from heavy throttle application. In normal driving the stator blades are arranged at 'cruise' angle, with improved efficiency and response at light <b>throttle.</b> <b>Opening</b> <b>the</b> <b>throttle</b> changes <b>the</b> angle of the stator vanes hydraulically to 'performance angle', which permits the converter to achieve stall about 1000 rpm higher than in 'cruise'. In this situation oil is redirected to strike the next-lowest drive turbine, which effectively lowers the drive ratio, and allows engine speed to flare to a speed where output is greatest. A few identifying features: the older Twin Turbine model was fitted with a rear pump, which meant the vehicle could be push-started (considered desirable at the time).|$|R

To the surprise of all, he <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>throttle,</b> and made series of short hops, managing to land successfully. The following Wednesday Parke, at his third attempt, succeeded in flying a half-circle in a stiff breeze, landing with minor damage to the undercarriage. The following Monday he successfully took the test for his pilots license in a Bristol Boxkite, and was awarded Royal Aero Club flying license no.73, awarded in a RAeC meeting that also awarded licenses to the pioneer naval aviators C.

He waved the lantern, but the lighter, with sea and current on her weather bow, forged almost {{straight}} ahead, and the straining hawser dragged the launch back. Reaching forward, Dick <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>throttle</b> valve to its limit, and then sat grim and still while the throb of the screw shook the trembling hull.

5000|$|The 700S {{continued}} to be developed at the Darley Abbey works in Derbyshire, along with the SPR Production Racing version. [...] Production was slow, with just two motorcycles a week coming off the production line. Customers could select from five colour schemes - British Racing Green, metallic blue or green, black with gold coachlines or plain red. There was also a Scott special edition in purple and cream - and a special scheme similar to Silk Cut cigarettes, which were popular at the time.As a precision engineering company, Silk {{were able to make}} the piston port twin cylinder engine in-house at their Derbyshire workshops. The pressed up, four roller bearing crank had the primary drive taken from the crankshaft centre, to an inverted Velocette Venom four-speed gearbox. The two stroke engine ran on a 50:1 petroil mix, with a separate oil tank reserved for main bearing lubrication fed by Silk's own design of oil pump. When <b>the</b> rider <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>throttle</b> <b>the</b> oil flowed faster, ensuring best possible lubrication. The engine's claimed 48 bhp was developed at 6,000rpm, giving good touring performance, and peak torque was at 3,000rpm, comparable to the Suzuki GT750. Twin siamesed exhaust pipes fed an Ossa silencer. The wheels on early models were 18 inch Borrani alloy rims, replaced with six spoke Campagnolo cast wheels on later Silks. The final drive chain was enclosed for longer life.|$|R
50|$|The {{first use}} of <b>the</b> twist grip <b>throttle</b> control was on the Roper steam {{velocipede}} of 1867-69. Rather than a sleeve that rotated around the handlebar, Sylvester H. Roper's steam motorcycle's entire handlebar rotated, with a dual mode operation. When rotated forward it <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>throttle,</b> and when rotated backwards it applied the spoon brake. Motorcycle Consumer News design columnist Glynn Kerr said that pioneering this technology was a point {{in favor of the}} Roper's precedence as the first motorcycle, in response to Cycle World Technical Editor Kevin Cameron's position that the 1885 Daimler Reitwagen was more deserving because it used the more successful technology, internal combustion rather than steam. The design drawings of the Reitwagen depicted a twist grip speed control, also applying the brake when turned one way, but when turned the other way, it would have tensioned the belt drive's idler pulley, applying power to the rear wheel {{in the manner of a}} clutch. The actual working model, however, did not have the twist grip, belt drive, or brakes.|$|R
50|$|When {{driving in}} a {{straight}} line the two engines were locked; turning the steering wheel gradually closed <b>the</b> <b>throttle</b> for <b>the</b> engine of one track and <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>throttle</b> for <b>the</b> engine driving the other. The two engines were joined at their cross-shafts, from which the final drive to the tracks was by chains to sprockets on either side. When steering the clutches joining the cross-shafts were released, one engine sped up while the other slowed down, the turn being on the side opposite to that of the faster running engine. The steering effect could be increased by use of the brakes on one engine or another. This arrangement had the advantage over that of earlier tanks of being controlled by one man only, but called for great skill {{on the part of the}} driver, because one or both of the engines could be stalled if care was not exercised. Although in theory a simple solution to give gradual steering, in practice it proved impossible to control the speeds of the engines, causing the vehicle to take an unpredictable path. Drivers grew wary and stopped the vehicle and locked one track before every turn; this caused many track breaks, as the movement became too abrupt.|$|R
