This work presents the experimental validation of the analytical model developed for an indentation-based process. The analytical model is originated from the Upper Bound Theorem application by means of its new modular distribution. The modules considered are composed of two Triangular Rigid Zones each. The experimental validation is performed through a series of indentation tests with work-pieces <b>of</b> <b>annealed</b> <b>aluminium</b> EN AW- 2030 and punches of steel AISI 304, under plane strain conditions. The results are compared with the ones obtained from the application of this new modular distribution of the Upper Bound Theorem, showing a good approximation and suitability of the model developed for an indentation-based process...|$|E
40|$|During {{uniaxial}} planar compression <b>of</b> <b>annealed</b> <b>aluminium</b> alloys, a novel {{approach to}} determine the surface asperity flattening (roughness R-a) is employed by analyzing {{the evolution of the}} surface 2 ̆ 7 s microtexture. With an increase in compression strain, the surface asperity tends to be flattened, and strain hardening increases. Lubrication can constrain the surface asperity flattening process and hinder the progress of grain surface flattening. The development of surface texture shows an obvious dependency: under the influence of friction, the normal deformation texture component (brass orientation 0 1 13 ̆c 1 1 2 3 ̆e can be generated easily, while lubrication can hinder this texture component generation. Simulated results show a good agreement with experimental results which predicated brass orientation.

40|$|Crystal {{plasticity}} {{finite element}} (CPFE) models are useful tools in modelling the anisotropic stress-strain responses in large deformation of polycrystalline metals. In this study, a CPFE model {{is applied to}} simulate the evolution of crystallographic textures during cold rolling of hot-rolled aluminium plates and during uniaxial tensile, uniaxial compression and simple shear tests <b>of</b> <b>annealed</b> <b>aluminium</b> sheets. The performance of the model is critically evaluated through quantitative comparisons of the simulated textures with those predicted by the full constraints (FC) Taylor model and the experimentally measured textures. It is shown that the CPFE model performs better than the FC Taylor model in all the cases. However, {{the quality of the}} texture predictions deteriorates with increasing strain values. The CPFE model gives better texture predictions in the moderately deformed tensile and compression samples (similar to 20 % strain), compared to the more heavily deformed simple shear (0. 85 - 0. 95 shear strain) and cold-rolled (40 - 98 % thickness reduction) samples. It is also shown that the CPFE predictions for cold rolling can be improved with finer discretization, i. e. by assigning multiple elements per grain instead of one element per grain in the finite element model. The improvement is mainly reflected in an improved prediction of the copper component and, in some cases, an improved prediction of the brass component. Inspection of the local deformation gradients reveals that these texture changes {{can be attributed to the}} increase of shear relaxations in the RD-ND and RD-TD planes. status: publishe...|$|E

The positron annihilation lifetime spectra of the anodized aluminium were measured and fitted into three lifetime components. The second component(tau(2), I(2)) was assigned to the positron annihilation in the anodic film. It has been deduced that, from the I(2) curves, the film thirkness is propertional to the cell voltage and reaches a limit under constant cell voltage and temperature and that, from the tau(2) curves, the crystallinity of the anodic film increase with increasing cell voltage and anodizing time. The local crystallization in the anodic film would induce the void-like defects and hence results in the film less compact.

40|$|Creep {{tests at}} room {{temperature}} under combined tension-torsion have been performed on thin walled tubes of commercially pure aluminium (ElA) in the annealed, extruded and prestrained conditions. The required creep stresses were achieved by incremental loading along a constant stress ratio path (radial loading). Axial ([epsilon][sub]zz) and shear ([gamma][sub][theta]z) strains were measured throughout deformation. Strains produced by radial loading on annealed and extruded aluminium consisted of an instantaneous component and a short-time creep component. For all stress paths the latter component was the form [epsilon][alpha]t[sup]m where the time exponent m lay in the parabolic range [omicron]<m< 1 / 2. The plastic prestraining <b>of</b> <b>annealed</b> <b>aluminium</b> was either beneficial or detrimental to its combined tension-torsion creep resistance. Forward prestrains (in tension or positive torsion) or large reversed prestrains (in compression or negative torsion) were beneficial to creep resistance by hardening the aluminium {{in the direction of}} the stress path. The effect was to eliminate the short-time creep component of radial loading and to reduce the primary creep strains and secondary creep rates of ensuing long-time creep. Small amounts of reversed prestrain were detrimental to creep resistance by softening the aluminium {{in the direction of the}} stress path. The effect was to increase the parabolic creep component of radial loading (m lowered) and to increase the primary creep strains and secondary creep rates of ensuing long-time creep. Experimental observations on flow behaviour were not in agreement with predictions from isotropic theory. The anisotrophy in the three conditions of aluminium was examined in the instantaneous plastic strain increment vector of loading (d[gamma][sup]P[sub][theta]z/d[epsilon][sup]P[sub]zz) and in the strain rate vector of short and long-time creep ([gamma][sub][theta]z/[epsilon][sub]zz). For each stress path on annealed aluminium the colinearity in these vectors indicated an initially anisotropic material which hardened uniformly throughout deformation. Stress paths on extruded aluminium produced rotations in the initial instantaneous vectors of loading while stress paths on prestrained aluminium produced rotations in the instantaneous vectors of loading and in the strain rate vectors of long-time creep. With increasing stress of loading or with accumulating creep strain the vectors rotated into colinearity. The behaviour was typical of the nature of anisotropic hardening in material possessing a strain history. Plastic strain increment ratios derived from the yield functions of Edelman and Drucker f= 1 / 2 C[sub]ijkl([sigma]ij-m[epsilon][sup]P[sub]ij) ([sigma]kl-m[epsilon][sub]kl) and Yoshimura the three conditions of aluminium. Hill’s yield function f= 1 / 2 C[sub]ijkl[sup]sigma][sub]ij[sup][sigma][sub]kl was descriptive of the plastic anisotrophy in uniform hardening. This led to an extension of each theory for creep. In general strain rate ratios derived from the extended theories were in good agreement with observations on creep anisotrophy...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{microstructure}} {{in heavily}} deformed metals {{can be characterized}} as a complex “mixture ” of low and high angle boundaries. By careful <b>annealing</b> <b>of</b> such cold deformed conditions, ultra-fine grained materials can be obtained. This phenomenon has been known for long and utilised in the production of special aluminium sheet qualities, and has received new interest with the emergence of the equal channel angular pressing (ECAP) technique. This work reviews the mechanical properties resulting from plastic deformation and <b>annealing</b> <b>of</b> <b>aluminium,</b> looking at alloys which prior to annealing was subjected to both severe plastic deformation (ECAP) and more conventional deformation by cold rolling. The effect of the resulting microstructures on the subsequent work hardening properties are model, applying the new microstructural metal plasticity model (MMP-model) developed in Trondheim over the last decade. Experimental background The effect of grain size on the tensile properties of various aluminium alloys processed by ECAP and subsequently annealing to achieve a wide range in grain sizes, has been studied by Horita et al.

40|$|The "relaxed constraints" (R. C.) {{models for}} the {{prediction}} of deformation textures are discussed with emphasis on their shortcomings. A generalized R.

The calculation of the increase of plastic work {{is based on an}} upper-bound solution of the problem of finding the plastic flow around an inclusion embedded in a matrix. The new "generalized R. C. model" has been implemented in a self-consistent scheme and can be used for the prediction of deformation textures. The upper-bound solution mentioned above has also been used in a study of the nucleation texture in the case <b>of</b> continuous <b>annealing</b> <b>of</b> an <b>aluminium</b> alloy with hard second phase particles, which were treated as "inclusions". Another result of this work is a classification of the "relaxations" (difference between local and macroscopic velocity gradient tensors) into an "orthogonal" and a "parallel" class.

40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{investigation}} of the resistance welding between carbon fiber (CF) rein-forced polyetherimide (PEI) and aluminium substrates (7075 -T 6 grade alloy) is presented. A three-dimensional transient finite element model (FEM) featuring heat transfer, consoli-dation and thermal degradation was used for simulating the process. Two mechanisms are distinguished in the consolidation model: (1) removal of the initial surface profile of the laminate modelled by the establishment of intimate contact between the two substrate sur-faces and (2) penetration of the thermoplastic (TP) polymer in the micro-pores of the alu-minium oxide surface modelled using a capillary flow model. The “optimal ” welding time based on the maximum lap shear strength (LSS) was determined for various power levels and correlated to the bonding time predicted by the FEM. Consolidation quality and failure mechanisms were discussed in relation to processing parameters. The effect of the welding operation on overaging (<b>annealing)</b> <b>of</b> the <b>aluminium</b> alloy also was investigated. Experi-mental and simulated processing windows were constructed and correlated to each other.

40|$|Our work {{focuses on}} an {{analysis}} of the processes for full and partial <b>annealing</b> <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> coils. Due to inefficient production management these processes show high inventory levels, long lead times and decreased delivery performance. We have also found inadequacies in the ways costs for these processes are distributed. We have established a new process mapping by initially investigating the strategic dimensions of the company and the processes for annealing, in order to later on establish performance measures congruent with the business objectives. Furthermore we have conducted extensive calculations and analyses to facilitate the successful implementation of a Just-in-time production philosophy, including necessary process improvements and redesigns to be made. Our proposed changes will lead to shorter lead times and low levels of WIP, which are important success factors of a JIT-based production philosophy. To do this we have developed a capacity analysis tool with which it is also possible to analyse other processing scenarios or the effect of load changes and/or product mix variations. This tool can also serve as a benchmark for capacity analysis of other processes. Finally, {{we have been able to}} establish more accurate costs per machine hour for full and partial annealing to be implemented in the managerial system. We believe that the processes for annealing are not the only ones suffering from poor cost control, why we would suggest that Sapa Heat Transfer investigates the cost distribution in more processes, and also develops and follows better guidelines for cost control...|$|R

40|$|Phenomena {{related to}} <b>annealing</b> <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> alloys {{are among the}} least {{understood}} in aluminium metallurgy but very important for industrial thermo-mechanical processing i. e. deformation and annealing. Physical models are used to predict recovery and recrystallization behaviour, and associated material properties, industrially. However, alloy development, e. g. to incorporate more recycled aluminium, has shown that current softening models are not satisfactory. Thus, improvements do require a better understanding and quantitative description of these phenomena. In this PhD work, subgrain growth has been studied by EBSD in cold rolled high and commercial purity aluminium alloys with emphasis on the subgrain growth behaviour of individual texture components (orientation dependent). The growth mechanisms do not appear particularly alloy dependent but coarsening is dissimilar in differently oriented subgrain structures. In the Cube and Goss texture components, growth is particularly fast after an incubation time, which is not observed in the Cu, S or Brass components. However, the local orientation gradients {{appear to be more}} important for the growth mechanism than the actual orientations. Typically, there are large orientation gradients and the boundary misorientations are increasing during annealing. However, in both S and Brass, decreasing misorientations were observed when the local orientation gradients were < 0. 5 °/µm, suggesting another growth mechanism. Subgrain sizes and misorientations were successfully characterized using a novel method developed within this PhD work, utilizing commercial EBSD and photo editing software. In addition, the effect of interannealing on softening and recrystallization was investigated in the commercial purity alloy and comprehensively described. In literature there is some uncertainty related to this topic. Interannealing greatly influence whether iron is dissolved in a solid solution or present as precipitates. Increasing deformation prior to interannealing enhances precipitation of Al 3 Fe and some αh-AlFeSi precipitates. The softening kinetics subsequent to interannealing are faster by a factor 103 and the recrystallization texture changes from a retained rolling texture to a more typical Cube recrystallization texture.
