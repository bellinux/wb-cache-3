500|$|In 1900 Bax {{moved on}} to the Royal Academy of Music, where he {{remained}} until 1905, studying composition with Frederick Corder and piano with Tobias Matthay. Corder was a devotee of the works of Wagner, whose music was Bax's principal inspiration in his early years. He later observed, [...] "For a dozen years <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>youth</b> I wallowed in Wagner's music to the almost total exclusion – until I became aware of Richard Strauss – of any other". Bax also discovered and privately studied the works of Debussy, whose music, like that of Strauss, was frowned on by the largely conservative faculty of the Academy.|$|E

500|$|At {{an early}} stage in his priesthood Lang decided to lead a celibate life. He had no {{objection}} to the institution of marriage, but felt that his own work would be hindered by domesticity. Years after Lang's death, his sexual orientation was questioned; [...] journalist Michael Gove and historian David Starkey suggested that Lang was a repressed homosexual. He had close friendships with colleagues such as Dick Sheppard, and with Wilfrid Parker, his one-time domestic chaplain to whom he wrote admitting his personal loneliness, and of his need for [...] "someone in daily nearness to love". He enjoyed the company of women and confessed in 1928, after {{a visit to the}} Rowntree's chocolate factory, that the sight of the girls there had [...] "stirred up all the instincts <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>youth...</b> very little subdued by the passage of years".|$|E

I was taking German in high school—which meant that we listened to it in school. I couldn't get away from it." [...] According to Broderick, Ferris's singing [...] "Danke Schoen" [...] in the shower was his idea. [...] "Although it's only because of the brilliance of John's deciding that I should sing [...] "Danke Schoen" [...] on the float in the parade. I had never heard the song before. I was learning it for the parade scene. So we're doing the shower scene and I thought, 'Well, I can do a little rehearsal.' And I did something with my hair to make that Mohawk. And you know what good directors do: they say, 'Stop! Wait till we roll.' And John put that stuff in." ...|$|E
500|$|The trio {{were called}} to active duty in January 1942, forcing them to leave the Bruins midway through the 1941–42 season. In their final game with the Bruins, the Kraut Line {{recorded}} eight points in a dominating victory over the Montreal Canadiens. [...] Following the contest, players from both teams fêted the trio, hoisting them up on their shoulders and parading them around the ice. Bauer was overwhelmed by the moment: [...] "The ovation, at the height <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>youth,</b> sort of grabbed me." [...] Schmidt, Dumart and Bauer were the first NHL players to join the Royal Canadian Air Force, and while training in Ottawa, they joined the Ottawa RCAF Flyers of the Quebec Senior Hockey League (QSHL). The trio helped the Flyers win the Allan Cup as Canadian senior champions. Bauer was sent to Halifax to continue his training and played with the Dartmouth RCAF team in 1942–43. Bauer, {{who served as a}} radio technician, was dispatched to the United Kingdom where he, Schmidt and Dumart were members of a bomber squadron. However, he was returned to Canada in 1944 after being ruled invalid due to a bout of sciatica caused by an old hockey injury. He played with a team in Toronto until the war's conclusion.|$|E

500|$|Shelley's {{trips to}} Italy were {{a way for}} her to revisit {{memories}} of her dead husband, Percy Shelley, and the children they had buried there. Moskal argues that Shelley needed to [...] "expiate" [...] her survivor guilt and Dolan {{that she needed to}} recover from a damaging trauma. Shelley writes about this in Rambles, using the trope of a pilgrimage; she believes that travelling to Italy and revisiting the scenes of her youth will cure her of her depression, writing, [...] "Besides all that Rome itself affords of delightful [...] to the eye and imagination, I revisit it as the bourne of a pious pilgrimage. The treasures <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>youth</b> lie buried here." [...] Shelley's pilgrimage follows in the tradition of Chaucer as well as the nineteenth-century trend to visit spas for healing, and like most pilgrimage narratives, hers does not relate the journey home. For Shelley, ultimately the most helpful part of travelling and visiting spas was seeing the beautiful scenery. In Rambles, Shelley contends that interacting with picturesque scenery can heal the body. Both the 1840 and 1842 trips followed times of ill health for Shelley and she used them as a way to recover both emotionally and physically. She opens Rambles by describing her poor health and hoping that by travelling her [...] "mind will... renew the outworn and tattered garments in which it has long been clothed".|$|E

Not much given to things of a bookey nature, I spent a large part <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>youth</b> smoking Number Six and cheating in French vocabulary tests." [...] He went on to Eton College, which he describes as [...] "the most private of private schools". He says he attended Selwyn College, Cambridge [...] "as a result of family tradition" [...] as his father [...] "went to Cambridge and I applied to the same college". Laurie notes his father had a successful bout as an oarsman at Cambridge and that he was [...] "trying to follow in his father's footsteps".

2500|$|Rachmaninoff {{sought the}} company of fellow Russian musicians and befriended pianist Vladimir Horowitz in 1928.

[...] About the pianist's interpretation of Rachmaninoff's own third concerto, the composer said to Abram Chasins that Horowitz [...] "swallowed it whole ... he had the courage, the intensity, the daring." [...] The men remained supportive of each other's work, each making a point of attending concerts given by the other. Horowitz remained a champion of Rachmaninoff's solo works and his Piano Concerto No. 3, about which Rachmaninoff remarked publicly after 7 August 1942 performance at the Hollywood Bowl: [...] "This is the way I always dreamed my concerto should be played, but I never expected to hear it that way on Earth." ...|$|E
2500|$|After media {{outrage at}} the 1976 Look Out for Lefty strip about {{football}} hooliganism in the IPC comic Action, Gifford controversially drew parallels with the Wertham censorship of the US comics industry in the 1950s, remarking that [...] "Perhaps its time we had another outcry against products like Action. Action is {{a new kind of}} comic geared to the lowest form of behaviour in children. Just as pornography caters for a mass market for adults, stuff like this provides violence for a mass market of children. As far as the people who produce Action are concerned, the children are simply a market and moral considerations do not apply." [...] Despite 2000 AD (#1 published in 1977) producing iconic characters and innovative and critically acclaimed stortelling and art, Gifford had similar reservations about its violent content: [...] "Whether children would actually enjoy living in ... is another matter, for as depicted... the future is a world of unrelieved violence." [...] Gifford was clear that his preferences in comics writing and art were informed by his nostalgia for UK comics of the 1930s, reflecting that [...] "I look back to the days <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>youth...</b> when comics were things of joy and pleasure, rather than blood and guts." ...|$|E
40|$|Buried in Polyester is a {{collection}} of essays in three parts loosely connected around the theme of the loss <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mother. Much like JoAnn Beard's The Boys <b>of</b> <b>My</b> <b>My</b> <b>Youth,</b> the essays hold up pieces <b>of</b> <b>my</b> life for inspection and puts them down again, not always with a sense of resolution. The subtext of the piece revolves around the search to put together the pieces <b>of</b> what <b>my</b> life was before and after my mother, and the transition from girlhood to adulthood with the absence <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mother. I hope also to explore how the self splits after a traumatic death, and the desperate attempt at recreation that takes the place of genuine mourning.
