40|$|Cooperative {{transmission}} in vehicular networks is {{studied by}} using coalitional game and pricing in this paper. There are several vehicles and roadside units (RSUs) in <b>the</b> networks. Each <b>vehicle</b> has {{a desire to}} transmit with a certain probability, which represents its data burtiness. The RSUs can enhance the vehicles' transmissions by cooperatively relaying the vehicles' data. We consider two kinds of cooperations: cooperation among <b>the</b> <b>vehicles</b> and cooperation between <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> and RSU. First, vehicles cooperate to avoid interfering transmissions by scheduling <b>the</b> transmissions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicles</b> in each coalition. Second, a RSU can join some coalition to cooperate <b>the</b> transmissions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicles</b> in that coalition. Moreover, due to <b>the</b> mobility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicles,</b> we introduce <b>the</b> notion <b>of</b> encounter between <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> and RSU to indicate <b>the</b> availability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relay in space. To stimulate the RSU's cooperative relaying for <b>the</b> <b>vehicles,</b> <b>the</b> pricing mechanism is applied. A non-transferable utility (NTU) game is developed to analyze <b>the</b> behaviors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicles</b> and RSUs. <b>The</b> stability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> formulated game is studied. Finally, we present and discuss the numerical results for the 2 -vehicle and 2 -RSU scenario, and the numerical results verify the theoretical analysis. Comment: accepted by IEEE ICC' 1...|$|R
