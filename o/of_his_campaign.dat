5|$|Huntsman {{formally}} {{entered the}} race for the Republican presidential nomination on June 21, 2011, announcing his bid in a speech at Liberty State Park in New Jersey, with the Statue of Liberty in the background—the same site where Ronald Reagan launched his campaign in 1980. After focusing his energy and resources on the New Hampshire primary in which he finished third, Huntsman announced the end <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>campaign</b> on January 16, 2012, endorsing Mitt Romney.|$|E
5|$|On June 10, 2013 he {{announced}} his intention to seek the Democratic nomination for Governor of Massachusetts in the 2014 election. Following an injunction by the State Ethics Commission over his ownership of Cape Air, {{he announced}} the suspension <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>campaign</b> and his intent to appeal the ruling. Although the Commission eventually ruled in his favor, the nomination process was already well along, and he would eventually run for re-election to the Senate.|$|E

5|$|A win by McCain over Huckabee in South Carolina, and by Romney over McCain in childhood-home Michigan, set up {{a pivotal}} battle in the Florida primary. Romney campaigned intensively on {{economic}} issues and the burgeoning subprime mortgage crisis, while McCain attacked Romney regarding Iraq policy and benefited from endorsements from Florida officeholders. McCain won a 5percentage point victory on January 29. Although many Republican officials were now lining up behind McCain, Romney persisted through the nationwide Super Tuesday contests on February 5. There he won primaries or caucuses in several states, but McCain won in more and in larger-population ones. Trailing McCain in delegates by a more than two-to-one margin, Romney announced the end <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>campaign</b> on February 7.|$|E
5|$|Although Johnson {{had focused}} the {{majority}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>campaign</b> {{activities on the}} New Hampshire primary, he announced on November 29, 2011 that {{he would no longer}} campaign there due to his inability to gain traction with less than a month until the primary. There was speculation in the media that he might run as a Libertarian Party candidate instead. Johnson acknowledged that he was considering such a move. In December, Politico reported that Johnson would quit the Republican primaries and announce his intention to seek the Libertarian Party nomination at a December 28 press conference. He also encouraged his supporters to vote for Ron Paul in 2012 Republican presidential primaries.|$|E
5|$|As a {{candidate}} for the Illinois state senate in 1996, Obama had said that he favored legalizing same-sex marriage. By the time of his Senate run in 2004, he said that he supported civil unions and domestic partnerships for same-sex partners, but he opposed same-sex marriages for strategic reasons. On May 9, 2012, shortly after the official launch <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>campaign</b> for re-election as president, Obama said his views had evolved, and he publicly affirmed his personal support for the legalization of same-sex marriage, becoming the first sitting U.S. president to do so.|$|E

5|$|Bert T. Combs put Breathitt {{in charge}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>campaign</b> against Wilson Wyatt in the Democratic gubernatorial primary in 1958. When Combs was elected {{governor}} in 1959, he appointed Breathitt as State Personnel Commissioner, charging him with writing legislation {{to create a}} merit system for state employees. After successfully guiding the legislation through the General Assembly, Breathitt resigned as personnel commissioner to accept an appointment to the Kentucky Public Service Commission. He was also served as chair of a failed state constitutional convention in 1960 {{and was a member}} of the Governor's Commission on Mental Health.|$|E
5|$|By the 18th century, Lajjun was {{replaced}} by Jenin as the administrative capital of the sanjak which now included the Sanjak of Ajlun. By the 19th century it was renamed Sanjak Jenin, although Ajlun was separated from it. Zahir al-Umar, who became the effective ruler of the Galilee {{for a short period}} {{during the second half of}} the 18th century, was reported to have used cannons against Lajjun in the course <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>campaign</b> between 1771-1773 to capture Nablus. It is possible that this attack led to the village's decline in the years that followed. By that time, Lajjun's influence was diminished by the increasing strength of Acre's political power and Nablus's economic muscle.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{his age and}} ill health, Brown {{was able}} to speak only once per week. At a {{campaign}} event in Madisonville, he challenged Goebel to a debate, but Goebel ignored the challenge. Brown, and other speakers enlisted on behalf <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>campaign,</b> frequently called attention to Goebel's refusal to acknowledge the challenge or agree to a debate. When William Jennings Bryan came to the state to campaign with Goebel, Brown sent him a letter challenging him to repudiate Goebel's nomination because of the broken agreement between Goebel and Stone. Bryan {{refused to comment on}} the events of the convention and stressed the importance of party loyalty. He denounced the Honest Election League's convention as irregular and invalid.|$|E

5|$|During the 1952 presidential election, the Eisenhower {{campaign}} toured Wisconsin with McCarthy. In {{a speech}} delivered in Green Bay, Eisenhower declared {{that while he}} agreed with McCarthy's goals, he disagreed with his methods. In draft versions of his speech, Eisenhower had also included a strong defense of his mentor, George Marshall, which was a direct rebuke of McCarthy's frequent attacks. However, under the advice of conservative colleagues who were fearful that Eisenhower could lose Wisconsin if he alienated McCarthy supporters, he deleted this defense from later versions of his speech. The deletion was discovered by William H. Laurence, a reporter for The New York Times, and featured on its front page the next day. Eisenhower was widely criticized for giving up his personal convictions, and the incident became the low point <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>campaign.</b>|$|E
5|$|During {{the entire}} course <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>campaign</b> in Dalmatia and Croatia, Tvrtko was also engaged in skirmishes {{in the east}} of his realm, which {{prevented}} him from focusing all of his manpower on expansion westwards. The Kingdom of Bosnia {{was believed to be}} far from the reach of the Ottomans during Tvrtko I's reign, shielded by a belt of independent Serbian statelets. George II of Zeta, however, purposely enabled the Turks to launch raids against Bosnia, first in 1386 (of which little is known) and again in 1388. In the second instance the Ottoman and Zetan invaders, led by Lala Şahin Pasha, penetrated as far as Bileća. The Battle of Bileća, which took place in late August 1388, ended with the victory of the Bosnian army, led by Duke Vlatko Vuković.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{appointment}} as a judge, Hand became politically {{active in the}} cause of New Nationalism. With reservations, in 1911 he supported Theodore Roosevelt's return to national politics. He approved of the former president's plans to legislate on behalf of the underprivileged and to control corporations, as well as <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>campaign</b> against the abuse of judicial power. Hand sought to influence Roosevelt's views on these subjects, both in person and in print, and wrote articles for Roosevelt's magazine, The Outlook. His hopes of swaying Roosevelt were often dashed. Roosevelt's poor grasp of legal issues particularly exasperated Hand.|$|E
50|$|Rosellini {{spent much}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>campaigning</b> proposing {{improvements}} to the state's institutions, including prisons and schools, while attacking the Langlie administration. Anderson, by contrast, made few promises and touted his qualifications as lieutenant governor.|$|R
25|$|In <b>his</b> <b>campaigns,</b> Cleveland baptized {{approximately}} 16,000 persons, including George Juko, the Crown Prince of Uganda.

5|$|In January 1874, Gladstone {{called a}} general election, {{convinced}} that if he waited longer, he would do worse at the polls. Balloting was spread over two weeks, beginning on 1 February. Disraeli devoted much <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>campaign</b> to decrying the Liberal programme {{of the past five}} years. As the constituencies voted, {{it became clear that the}} result would be a Conservative majority, the first since 1841. In Scotland, where the Conservatives were perennially weak, they increased from seven seats to nineteen. Overall, they won 350 seats to 245 for the Liberals and 57 for the Irish Home Rule League. The Queen sent for Disraeli, and he became Prime Minister for the second time.|$|E
5|$|In {{the general}} {{election}} campaign he faced Republican nominee Sean Bielat, a technology executive {{and member of the}} U.S. Marine Corps Reserve. Bielat had run an unsuccessful campaign against Barney Frank in the 2010 election for the 4th district seat. In a series of debates, Bielat challenged Kennedy's qualifications for Congress, saying that the Democrat's campaign was coasting on name recognition rather than experience, and that he would be a party-line vote. Kennedy tried to tie Bielat to the budget platform of U.S. Representative Paul Ryan, although Bielat responded that he only supported parts of the plan. Kennedy raised over $4 million in support <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>campaign,</b> far exceeding Bielat's draw of around $900,000. Kennedy won the November 6 election with 61 percent of the vote to Bielat's 36 percent.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{spent the}} early months <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>campaign</b> making media {{appearances}} on television programs such as The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and Red Eye w/Greg Gutfeld. Starting in September 2012, Johnson embarked on a three-week tour of college campuses throughout the US. On October 23, 2012, Gary Johnson participated in a third-party debate that was aired on C-SPAN, RT America, and Al Jazeera English. A post-debate online election allowed people to choose two candidates from the debate they thought had won to face each other head to head in a run-off debate. Gary Johnson and Jill Stein won the poll. They debated in Washington, D.C., on November 5, 2012.|$|E
50|$|In his 20s Emmanuel Philibert {{followed}} his father Thomas {{in the last}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>campaigns</b> in Lombardy, acquitting himself with great valour, {{and two years later}} he was named a colonel of cavalry in the service <b>of</b> <b>his</b> distant cousin Louis XIV, King of France.|$|R

50|$|Ranjit Singh's {{victory was}} {{to mark the}} highpoint <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>campaigns,</b> <b>his</b> empire now {{stretched}} from the Khyber Pass to the west, to the north Kashmir and to the south Multan.

5|$|The close {{relations}} with Byzantium, however, {{did not help}} Prince Vladimir. Samuel attacked Duklja in 1009 or 1010, as part <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>campaign</b> aimed at breaking up that pro-Byzantine bloc, which could have threatened him. Vladimir retreated with his army {{and many of his}} people to his fortress on a hill named Oblik, close to the southeastern tip of Lake Skadar. According to the Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja, he performed a miracle there: the hill was infested with venomous snakes, but when he offered up a prayer to the Lord, their bites became harmless.|$|E
5|$|After the {{surprise}} gains of the flamboyant Jelinčič {{in the first}} round, the campaigns of both candidates opted for more concrete political statements in public campaigning and debates. Peterle replaced the head <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>campaign,</b> and concentrated on questioning Türk's role in the 1991 secession from Yugoslavia. Peterle alleged {{that at the time}} when he, as Prime Minister, struggled for Slovenia's independence, Türk continued to act as an official representative of Yugoslavia in international institutions. The campaign was backed by the Prime Minister Janša and the Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel who {{went so far as to}} confirm Peterle's claims on the Foreign Ministry's official website. Türk denied the allegations, pointing to his opinion piece in the International Herald Tribune advocating international recognition of Slovenia, and the fact that it was Rupel himself who in 1992 appointed Türk as the Ambassador to the UN and praised him for his service to the country. Peterle's new strategy appeared to backfire, and the polls before the runoff predicted that Türk would win between 63% and over 70% of the vote.|$|E
5|$|Despite initial {{concerns}} {{that a strong}} conservative would run in the 1980 Republican primary, Mathias did not face any major opposition for his seat. He easily won his party's nomination, and was re-elected by a substantial margin in November. His Democratic counterpart in the election, Edward T. Conroy, positioned himself as more conservative than Mathias. Conroy also made national defense the primary issue <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>campaign,</b> where he accused Mathias of being weak. Mathias countered, stating he had voted for over $1.1 trillion in defense spending during {{his career in the}} Senate. By winning easy re-election, Mathias became the first Maryland Republican to win election to a third Senate term, and also the only Republican to win the city of Baltimore up to that point. He also secured support from several precincts of Baltimore's Democratic political machine, and several labor unions.|$|E
50|$|Napoleon formed his own Mamluk corps, {{the last}} known Mamluk force, {{in the early}} years of the 19th century, and used Mamluks in a number <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>campaigns.</b> Napoleon's famous {{bodyguard}} Roustam Raza was also a Mamluk who had been sold in Egypt.|$|R
