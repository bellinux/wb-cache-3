40|$|The {{problem with}} {{analysing}} organisational systems is the sheer complexity. These sociotechnical systems contain many entities {{with a high}} level of connectivity. This intrinsic complexity raises many challenges for the <b>operational</b> <b>analyst</b> because of the oddities associated with the mathematics of non-linearity, and the evolutionary nature of ecological systems. In addition, these systems are generally poorly defined, e. g. the nature of the human-human interaction is an intractable relationship. This paper discusses the problems associated with analysing complex, uncertain problems and develops a method for considering such systems. Throughout the paper references are made to information operations because of the broad scope and inherent difficulties in tackling this field of conflict.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedA test {{based on the}} Operations Analysis Curriculum at the United States Naval Postgraduate School was administered to 104 Naval Officers. All examinees were graduates or students of the Operations Analysis Curriculum and/or officers holding Operations Analysts billets in the Navy. The sub-sample, 34 examinees, consisting of officers holding Operations Analysts billets and/or Operations Analysis graduates was not sufficient to make adequate statistical determination of the measure of effectiveness proposed in a suggested methodology. The data gathered did crudely support hypothesized learning and forgetting curves and suggested that the effectiveness of Operations Analysis graduates assigned directly to Operations Analysts billets immediately after graduation is much enhanced compared to graduates who are returned first to fleet operational billets. The effectiveness of Operations Analysis trained officers in <b>Operational</b> <b>Analyst</b> billets was shown to be quantitatively and subjectively significantly superior to those with no formal Operations Analysis training. These results indicate that Naval assignment policies should be reviewed in hopes of assigning more Operations Analysis trained officers (consistent with other requirements) to these billets. Further investigation {{of the results of}} the test vehicle and other statistics common to Operations Analysis graduates yielded a feasible procedure with which to augment the screening of prospective Operations Analysis students. Final Quality Point Rating, an acceptable measure of performance, had a. 614 correlation with four readily available statistics. This evaluation suggests that further study in this area has great promise in yielding useful measures of effectiveness for all personnel filling billets requiring postgraduate education, provided a more effective method is employed to insure completion of the required test instrument(s).

40|$|AbstractIn this article, we {{describe}} simulation-based decision support techniques {{for evaluation of}} operational plans within effects-based planning. Using a decision support tool, developers of operational plans are able to evaluate thousands of alternative plans against possible courses of events and decide which of these plans are capable of achieving a desired end state. The objective {{of this study is}} to examine the potential of a decision support system that helps <b>operational</b> <b>analysts</b> understand the consequences of numerous alternative plans through simulation and evaluation. Operational plans are described in the effects-based approach to operations concept as a set of actions and effects. For each action, we examine several different alternative ways to perform the action. We use a representation where a plan consists of several actions that should be performed. Each action may be performed in one of several different alternative ways. Together these action alternatives make up all possible plan instances, which are represented as a tree of action alternatives that may be searched for the most effective sequence of alternative actions. As a test case, we use an expeditionary operation with a plan of 43 actions and several alternatives for these actions, as well as a scenario of 40 group actors. Decision support for planners is provided by several methods that analyze the impact of a plan on the 40 actors, e. g., by visualizing time series of plan performance. Detailed decision support for finding the most influential actions of a plan is presented by using sensitivity analysis and regression tree analysis. Finally, a decision maker may use the tool to determine the boundaries of an operation that it must not move beyond without risk of drastic failure. The significant contribution of this study is the presentation of an integrated approach for evaluation of operational plans...|$|R
40|$|Water vapor imagery from {{geostationary}} satellites {{has been}} available for over a decade. These data are used extensively by <b>operational</b> <b>analysts</b> and forecasters, mainly in a qualitative mode (Weldon and Holmes 1991). In addition to qualitative applications, motions deduced in animated water vapor imagery {{can be used to}} infer wind fields in cloudless regimes, thereby augmenting the information provided by cloud-drift wind vectors. Early attempts at quantifying the data by tracking features in water vapor imagery met with modest success (Stewart et al. 1985; Hayden and Stewart 1987). More recently, automated techniques have been developed and refined, and have resulted in upper-level wind observations comparable in quality to current operational cloud-tracked winds (Laurent 1993). In a recent study by Velden et al. (1993) it was demonstrated that wind sets derived from Meteosat- 3 (M- 3) water vapor imagery can provide important environmental wind information in data void areas surrounding tropical cyclones, and can positively impact objective track forecasts. M- 3 was repositioned to 75 W by the European Space Agency in 1992 in order to provide complete coverage of the Atlantic Ocean. Data from this satellite are being transmitted to the U. S. for operational use. Compared with the current GOES- 7 (G- 7) satellite (positioned near 112 W), the M- 3 water vapor channel contains a superior horizontal resolution (5 km vs. 16 km). In this paper, we examine wind sets derived using automated procedures from both GOES- 7 and Meteosat- 3 full disk water vapor imagery in order to assess this data as a potentially important source of large-scale wind information. As part of a product demonstration wind sets were produced twice a day at CIMSS during a six-week period in March and April (1994). These data sets are assessed in terms of geographic coverage, statistical accuracy, and meteorological impact through preliminary results of numerical model forecast studies...|$|R

40|$|Traditional, combat model based {{analysis}} of Dismounted Combatant Operations (DCO) {{has focused on}} the ‘lethal’ aspects in an engagement, and to a limited extent the environment in which the engagement takes place. These are however only two of the factors that should be taken into account when conducting an operational analysis. Analyses of DCO especially need to take the human factors, such as emotion, cognition, sociality and physiology into account in order to provide comprehensive analysis and soldiersystem focused input to military decision makers. Only recently has heat stress and fatigue modelling become possible when conducting research wargaming, due to the advances in science and improved modelling capabilities. The study presented in this paper looks at the possible changes to research wargaming outcomes when modelling heat stress within a combat situation. The study is based on a modelled attack into a defended building by soldiers bearing full personal protection equipment (PPE) and a typical combat load of weapon, ammunition, water and other required kit. The attack is modelled to be occurring in hot (above 45 degrees Celsius) dry conditions against a defender that does not possess any PPE and carries far less equipment. The “objective” of the study is to determine the relative combat effectiveness of different section sizes versus a standard opponent using specified measures of effectiveness. The attack is conducted under two different modelling environments using the same combat model. The first ignores the heat stress and fatigue caused by the PPE and equipment weight, the second causes the soldier’s performance to degrade as their core body temperature rises and they become fatigued. The combat effectiveness ranks of the section size options are developed under both environments and compared to determine what, if any, affect the human factors had on the relative combat effectiveness of the different section sizes. Further strengthening the links between <b>operational</b> <b>analysts</b> and human factors scientists, in order to provide military decision makers with solid operational analyses is vital to the success of future military operations.

40|$|Abstract—Enterprise {{systems are}} load tested for every added feature, {{software}} updates and periodic maintenance {{to ensure that}} the performance demands on system quality, availability and responsiveness are met. In current practice, performance analysts manually analyze load test data to identify the components that are responsible for performance deviations. This process is time consuming and error prone due to the large volume of performance counter data collected during monitoring, the limited <b>operational</b> knowledge of <b>analyst</b> about all the subsystem involved and their complex interactions and the unavailability of up-to-date documentation in the rapidly evolving enterprise. In this paper, we present an automated approach based on a robust statistical technique, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify subsystems that show performance deviations in load tests. A case study on load test data of a large enterprise application shows that our approach do not require any instrumentation or domain knowledge to operate, scales well to large industrial system, generate few false positives (89 % average precision) and detects performance deviations among subsystems in limited time.

40|$|Abstract—Large scale systems (LSS) contain {{multiple}} subsystems that interact {{across multiple}} nodes in sometimes unforeseen and complicated ways. As a result, pinpointing the subsystems {{that are the}} source of performance degradation for a load test in LSS can be frustrating, and might take several hours or even days. This is due to the large volume of performance counter data collected such as CPU utilization, Disk I/O, memory consumption and network traffic, the limited <b>operational</b> knowledge of <b>analysts</b> about all subsystems of an LSS and the unavailability of up-to-date documentation in a LSS. We have developed a methodology that automatically ranks the subsystems according to the deviation of their performance in a load test. Our methodology uses performance counter data of a load test to craft performance signatures for the LSS subsystems. Pair-wise correlations among the performance signatures of subsystems within a load test are compared with the corresponding correlations in a baseline test to pinpoint the subsystems responsible for the performance violations. Case studies on load test data obtained from a large telecom system an open source benchmark application show that our approach provides an accuracy of 79 % and our approach don’t require any instrumentation or domain knowledge to operate.

There are several benefits of developing SD models to simulate chemical production. SD is an effective tool for characterizing complex problems, especially the production process where the cascading effect of outages quickly taxes common understanding. By programming expert knowledge into an SD application, these tools are transformed into a knowledge management resource that facilitates rapid learning without requiring years of experience in production operations. It also permits the analyst to rapidly respond to crisis situations and other time-sensitive missions.

40|$|Funded by the Belgian National {{research}} fund (FRS-FNRS), I am currently {{collaborating with}} several {{services of the}} federal police of Belgium (strategic, <b>operational</b> and behavioural <b>analysts)</b> to develop <b>operational</b> techniques to implement geographic profiling – including temporal aspects of crime scene – on the Belgian territory. Belgium {{is characterized by a}} small and highly populated territory with a complex road network; which require more concerns about its geographical features than the regular grids of American cities. From an operational perspective, few studies have focused on the conditions favouring the application of GP. Rossmo defined five criteria for effective likelihood surface, but these criteria are often difficult to verify with the data gathered during the investigations. This presentation proposes to study the relationships between those applicability hypotheses, crime types, and spatio-temporal aspects of the crime in order to better predict the surface effectiveness. Then, we discuss the difficulty to meet those assumptions for serial rapes in Belgium. Non-uniform pattern and multiple residences for offenders are some of the factors hampering those assumptions. An unsolved case of rapes submitted by the police illustrates how a GP reasoning is still possible when Rossmo’s criteria are not met. The objective was to delineate a priority area around crime locations for DNA testing as the offender was assumed to be local. The series presents a pattern focusing on two different city centers. For this reason, the likelihood surface was generated under a different assumption than the classical distance decay. Indeed, our analysis of the crimes pattern in relation to the road network points out a new hypothesis for the offender’s spatial behaviour: spatial consistency in travelled distances to commit the crimes instead of a distance decay function. This hypothesis was supported by an analysis of the ‘neutrality’ of the series crime locations. Brantingham distinguished crime generators/attractors from neutral places {{as a function of the}} attractiveness of place. According to him, distance decay functions can only be applied to neutral places. In our series, it appears that only one location was located in rural area, in a very unattractive place for rapes. By contrast, the others were located in the city centers or near night clubs. We concluded that there was a high probability for the offender to come from this village. Subsequent DNA analyses of the residents of that village confirmed our hypothesis. Peer reviewe...|$|R
