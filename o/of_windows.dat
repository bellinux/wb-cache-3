5|$|Beginning with Intel Kaby Lake and AMD Bristol Ridge, Windows 10 is {{the only}} version <b>of</b> <b>Windows</b> that Microsoft will officially support on newer CPU microarchitectures. Terry Myerson stated that Microsoft {{did not want to}} make further {{investments}} in optimizing older versions <b>of</b> <b>Windows</b> and associated software for newer generations of processors. These policies were criticized by the media, who especially noted that Microsoft was refusing to support newer hardware (particularly Intel's Skylake CPUs, which was also originally targeted by the new policy with a premature end of support that was ultimately retracted) on Windows 8.1, a version <b>of</b> <b>Windows</b> that is still in mainstream support until January 2018.|$|E
