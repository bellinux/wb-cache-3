His rival was Carlos Duque, a candidate selected by Noriega. The US government contributed $10 million to Panamanian opposition campaigns, though it was unknown whether Endara received any <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>money.</b>|$|E

In 1996, when Crowded House decided to break up, they organised a farewell concert as a charity event for the Sydney Children's Hospital on 24 November. They approached Powderfinger and fellow Australian acts Custard and You Am I to also appear {{on the steps of}} the Sydney Opera House. The charity event, which was recorded and later released as a live album titled Farewell to the World, was claimed to have the largest Australian live concert audience, with estimates of between 100,000 and 250,000 people. In the wake of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, Powderfinger performed at the WaveAid fund-raising concert in Sydney in January 2005. The disaster killed more than 225,000 people from 11 countries in the area. The total profit from the funds raised from ticket sales and donations was A$2,300,000, however most <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>money</b> was spent in the administrative stream with little reaching those affected.|$|E

5|$|The stay of Cardinal Ottobono Fieschi (later Pope Adrian V) in England from 29 October 1265, until July 1268, {{led to a}} {{great deal}} of {{diplomatic}} activity in the Scottish church, in which Albin was perhaps involved. Cardinal Ottobono imposed a general tax on the English church, which he extended to Scotland. King Alexander III forbade the payment <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>money,</b> and appealed to the papacy; but in 1267 the Scottish clergy persuaded Alexander to abandon his appeal, while they made their own reduced payments. Meanwhile, Cardinal Ottobono's legatine council, to which the Scottish church had sent four delegates, promulgated canons for the English church which he expected the Scottish church to incorporate; the Scottish church {{does not appear to have}} done so, however.|$|E
5|$|After Charles's death, {{the former}} Austrian {{imperial}} family were soon to move again. Alfonso XIII of Spain had approached the British Foreign Office via his ambassador in London, and {{they agreed to}} allow Zita and her seven (soon to be eight) children to relocate to Spain. Alfonso duly sent the warship Infanta Isabel to Funchal and this took them to Cadiz. They were then escorted to the Pardo Palace in Madrid, where shortly after her arrival Zita {{gave birth to a}} posthumous child, Archduchess Elisabeth. Alfonso XIII offered his exiled Habsburg relatives the use of Palacio Uribarren at Lekeitio in the Bay of Biscay. This appealed to Zita, {{who did not want to}} be a heavy burden to the state that harboured her. For the next six years Zita settled in Lekeitio, where she got on with the job of raising and educating her children. They lived with straitened finances, mainly living on income from private property in Austria, income from a vineyard in Johannisberg, and voluntary collections. Other members of the exiled Habsburg dynasty, however, claimed much <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>money,</b> and there were regular petitions for help from former Imperial officials.|$|E
5|$|During {{the truce}} of 1206–1208, John focused on {{building}} up his financial and military resources {{in preparation for}} another attempt to recapture Normandy. John used some <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>money</b> to pay for new alliances on Philip's eastern frontiers, where the growth in Capetian power was beginning to concern France's neighbours. By 1212 John had successfully concluded alliances with his nephew Otto IV, a contender for the crown of Holy Roman Emperor in Germany, {{as well as with}} the counts Renaud of Boulogne and Ferdinand of Flanders. The invasion plans for 1212 were postponed because of fresh English baronial unrest about service in Poitou. Philip seized the initiative in 1213, sending his elder son, Louis, to invade Flanders with the intention of next launching an invasion of England. John was forced to postpone his own invasion plans to counter this threat. He launched his new fleet to attack the French at the harbour of Damme. The attack was a success, destroying Philip's vessels and any chances of an invasion of England that year. John hoped to exploit this advantage by invading himself late in 1213, but baronial discontent again delayed his invasion plans until early 1214, in what was his final Continental campaign.|$|E

25|$|Martin Bryant {{inherited}} about $570,000 AUD (£300,000 GBP or $450,000 USD) {{worth of}} property and other assets from a friend, Helen Harvey, who left her estate to him. He used part <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>money</b> to go on many trips around the world from 1993 onwards. Bryant also withdrew many thousands of dollars during this period. He used at least some <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>money</b> in late 1993 to purchase an AR-10 semi-automatic rifle through a newspaper advertisement in Tasmania. In March 1996, he had his AR-10 repaired at a gun shop and made enquiries about AR-15 rifles in other gun shops. At the time of purchase, no registration of guns outside of handguns was required in Tasmania.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, the {{community}} members have seen little <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>money,</b> due to conditions on its use and bureaucratic requirements by band councils.

25|$|Soon {{after the}} {{takeover}} was completed, the debt was transferred from HBOS and SMG {{to the financial}} institutions controlled by Romanov, Ūkio bankas and UBIG.

25|$|Unlike other generals who {{had failed}} in the Deccan, Jai Singh was punished harshly, partly {{because he was a}}lso held {{responsible}} for his son's actions at Agra (in letting Shivaji escape), and partly because he was a Hindu. For the expenses of this campaign, the Rajput general had received only 3 million rupees from Aurangzeb, and had spent 10 million rupees from the accumulated hoards in his ancestral kingdom. Not a paisa <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>money</b> was compensated by his ungrateful master; probably the opportunity of ruining a leading Hindu chief was too tempting for Aurangzeb.|$|E

50|$|The film {{reveals that}} much of the {{economic}} growth which took place in Miami during this period was a benefit of the drug trade. As members of the drug trade made immense amounts <b>of</b> <b>money,</b> <b>this</b> <b>money</b> flowed in large amounts into legitimate businesses. Consequently, drug money indirectly financed the construction of many of the modern high-rise buildings in southern Florida. Later, when law enforcement pressure drove many major players out of the picture, numerous high-end stores and businesses closed because of plummeting sales.|$|R
25|$|Despite an {{official}} ban on drug dealing by the American Mafia, the Italian Gambino brothers were {{heavily involved in}} international heroin trafficking out of Bensonhurst. The Cherry Hill Gambinos were the ultimate recipients of the heroin that was brought in by the Inzerillo-Gambino-Spatola-Di Maggio clan from Sicily. They smuggled an estimated US$600 million worth of heroin into the U.S. every year. A lot <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>money</b> {{was sent back to}} Italy to be invested in legitimate businesses. By 1982 the Inzerillo-Gambino-Spatola holdings in Palermo alone were estimated to be worth one billion US dollars.|$|E
25|$|These early tours were lucrative for {{the players}} and {{promoters}} and cricket administrators looked {{to find ways to}} channel some <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>money</b> to the destitute clubs, through the state associations. Formal discussions began in January 1905 in Sydney for the formation of a body to take control of tours from the players. A draft constitution was discussed by members of the New South Wales, Victoria, South Australian and Queensland associations. The first meeting of the new board was held at Wesley College in Melbourne on 6 May 1905.|$|E

As {{there is a widespread}} currency inflation during the war, the value <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>money</b> fluctuated erratically thus exchange with the former British Borneo dollars is useless. Increasing inflation coupled with Allied disruption of Japan's economy forced the Japanese administration to issue banknotes of larger denominations and increase the amount of money in circulation. From January 1942, the Japanese decide the military notes should be in par with the national yen.|$|E

In 1983, {{a federal grand jury}} indicted Metropolitan Edison on criminal charges for the falsification of safety test results prior to the accident. Under a plea-bargaining agreement, Met Ed pleaded guilty to one count of falsifying records and no contest to six other charges, four of which were dropped, and agreed to pay a $45,000fine and set up a $1million account to help with emergency planning in the area surrounding the plant.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after his}} return to Kassel, on his 66th birthday, Rundstedt {{received}} a cheque from Hitler for 250,000 Reichsmarks. This was part of Hitler's policy of buying the continuing loyalty of his senior commanders. Many found this offensive, but none turned down these gifts. Rundstedt {{tried to do the}} next best thing by failing to cash the cheque. By February this was attracting adverse comment in Berlin, and Rundstedt then cashed it. Some writers have sought to connect Rundstedt's acceptance <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>money</b> with his continuing refusal to support the resistance movement against Hitler's regime within the German Army. In fact Rundstedt refused {{to have anything to do}} with the money, handing it over to his daughter-in-law, and it was still untouched at his death in 1953.|$|E
