50|$|There {{remains to}} this day stark {{controversy}} over whether non-Irlen-certified Meares-Irlen syndrome and the original Irlen syndrome are the same condition. Irlen syndrome, for example, seems to include a broader array of symptoms, including severe variants of the core condition. Basic testing for scotopic sensitivity was tried by optometrists, opticians, and orthoptists in UK hospitals, and by optometrists and opticians in private practice employing a technique that used the Intuitive Colorimeter, developed under Medical Research Council license. An alternative approach to correct Irlen syndrome was tried by <b>Orthoscopics</b> franchise in the UK, with wide colour coverage and tints manufactured by Hoyato match. Other commercial organisations have produced sets of therapeutic tints, although most have not received scientific evaluation.|$|R

Bacteriologist Robert Koch was given the company's 100,000th microscope in 1907.

50|$|The Plössl is an {{eyepiece}} usually {{consisting of}} two sets of doublets, designed by Georg Simon Plössl in 1860. Since the two doublets can be identical this design is sometimes called a symmetrical eyepiece. The compound Plössl lens provides a large 50° or more apparent field of view, along with relatively large FOV. This makes this eyepiece ideal {{for a variety of}} observational purposes including deep-sky and planetary viewing. The chief disadvantage of the Plössl optical design is short eye relief compared to an <b>orthoscopic</b> since the Plössl eye relief is restricted to about 70-80% of focal length. The short eye relief is more critical in short focal lengths below about 10 mm, when viewing can become uncomfortable especially for people wearing glasses.|$|E

The spacing between the aperture plate and the converter is chosen such that the mini-images of an emitting object formed by the pinholes do not substantially overlap as they impinge on the converter. The output of the image intensifier is digitized by a digitizing camera in terms of position and intensity and fed into a digital computer.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, a {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) image security system combines {{the use of}} the smart pixel mapping (SPM) algorithm and the Fibonacci transformation technique is proposed. In order to reconstruct <b>orthoscopic</b> 3 D images with improved image quality, a smart pixel mapping process is adopted. Based on the SPM-based computational integral imaging (CII) system, the depth-converted elemental image array (EIA) is obtained for increasing the quality of the reconstructed image. In the encryption process, the depth-converted EIA is scrambled by the Fibonacci transformation (FT) algorithm. Meanwhile, the computational integral imaging reconstruction (CIIR) technique is used to reconstruct the 3 D image in the image reconstruction process. Compared with conventional CII-based 3 D image encryption methods, the proposed method enable us to reconstruct high-resolution <b>orthoscopic</b> 3 D images at long distance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, some numerical experiments are made to test the validity and the capability of the proposed 3 D image security system...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Integral imaging {{is widely}} {{considered}} as a promising technique able to enhance video by adding scene depth, i. e. producing 3 D video. However, an increase in spatial resolution of several orders of magnitude from todays 2 D video is required to provide a sufficient depth fidelity. We have recently proposed a pre-processing and compression scheme for integral images showing good performance {{on a set of}} reference images. This scheme forms pseudo video sequences by transforming the static integral image into a set of <b>orthoscopic</b> projections, so called modified elementary images. The pseudo video sequence is then compressed using H. 264 compression. In this paper we investigate how different orders of selecting the modified elementary images affect the schemes compression efficiency. Five different selection orders are evaluated on four reference images. The performance of each combination of selection order and reference image is presented. The obtained results indicate that for all but the most complex reference image, all selection order can provide a compression ratio of 320 : 1 or more, while keeping PSNR above 30 dB...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{promising}} techniques for visualizing three-dimensional objects is Integral Photography (IP). Two {{of the most}} common methods used in Computer Generated IP involve the development of simplified ray tracing algorithms for elementary 3 D objects or the realization of pinhole arrays. We present an alternative technique based on the POV-Ray software package for ray tracing to generate synthetic, high quality and photorealistic integral images, by accurately modeling all the optical elements of the capturing setup. Our work constitutes a straightforward approach for translating a computer generated 3 D model to an IP image and a robust method to develop modules that can be easily integrated in existing ray-tracers. The proposed technique simulates the procedure of a single stage IP capture for producing <b>orthoscopic</b> IP images, real or virtual. Full control is provided over geometry selection, size and refractive index of the elementary microlenses.

40|$|The {{discrepancy}} between the amplitude of erosive processes set off in {{the environment and the}} level of the measures taken to stop or to counter-balance the pollution effects, limited by the way of life, technologies, knowledge and conscience, entails high demands for the society as a whole and for each individual. This approach aims the addressing of the issue of consumer’s ecological behaviour as a process of conscious assumption of responsibilities for environmental preservation and manifestation of attitudes oriented to promoting the values of the ecosystem and delimitation of specific behavioural typology. In this respect, we proceeded at the holistic analysis of the domain’s inherent and specific conditions that allowed detection of influencing factors of the adoption of an ecological behavior and their synthetic structure into three groups of determinants: economic, psychosocial and organizational. In these three major coordinates, there are designed types of ecological behaviour, their effectiveness being at the intersection of the projections of different degrees of intensity considered on the chosen axes. Based on deductive reasoning there can be determined <b>orthoscopic</b> actions that are focused on eliminating the cause that generated behavioural deviations. ecological behaviour, determinants of ecological behaviour, typology of ecological behaviour, ecosystem relationship...|$|E
40|$|Pseudoscopic (inverted depth) {{images that}} keep a {{continuous}} parallax are {{shown to be}} possible due to a double diffraction process intermediated by a slit {{as a consequence of}} a simple symmetrical process object-image. One diffraction grating directing light to the slit acts as a wavelength encoder of views while a second diffraction grating decodes the projected image. The process results in the enlargement of the image under common white light illumination, up to infinite magnification at a critical point. This point is shown to correspond to another simple symmetry object-observer. The system can be considered as a magnifier instrument, having a definite focal length value although no curvature is present in it. Results are available in video through internet. We developed a theory which accounts main ray directions only, and made measurements selecting wavelengths by means of interference filters to compare with experience, in good agreement. We also show the existence of <b>orthoscopic</b> (normal depth) images within the same system, constituting a direct image system whose appearance resembles a holographic image. It can be mounted with plastic diffraction gratings available at science shops, so that any person with minimal skill can experience the new properties of diffractive white light imaging...|$|E

Includes bibliographical refences. A Fresnel lenslet array {{pattern is}} {{written on a}} phase-only LCoS spatial light {{modulator}} device (SLM) to replace the regular analog lenslet array in a conventional integral imaging system. We theoretically analyze the capture part of the proposed system based on Fresnel wave propagation formulation. Due to pixelation and quantization of the lenslet array pattern, higher diffraction orders and multiple focal points emerge. Because of the multiple focal planes introduced by the discrete lenslets, multiple image planes are observed. The use of discrete lenslet arrays also causes some other artefacts on the recorded elemental images. The results reduce to those available in the literature when the effects introduced by the discrete nature of the lenslets are omitted. We performed simulations of the capture part. It is possible to obtain the elemental images with an acceptable visual quality. We also constructed an optical integral imaging system with both capture and display parts using the proposed discrete Fresnel lenslet array written on a SLM. Optical results, when self-luminous objects, such as an LED array, are used indicate that the proposed system yields satisfactory results. The resulting system consisting of digital lenslet arrays offers a flexible integral imaging system. Thus, to increase the visual performance of the system, previously available analog solutions can now be implemented digitally by using electro-optical devices. We also propose a method and present applications of this method that converts a diffraction pattern into an elemental image set in order to display them on a display-only integral imaging setup. We generate elemental images based on diffraction calculations {{as an alternative to}} commonly used ray tracing methods. Ray tracing methods do not accommodate the interference and diffraction phenomena. Our proposed method enables us to obtain elemental images from a holographic recording of a 3 D object/scene. The diffraction pattern can be either numerically generated or digitally acquired from optical input. The method shows the connection between a hologram (diffraction pattern) of a 3 D object and an elemental image set of the same 3 D object. We obtained optical reconstructions with a display-only integral imaging setup where we used a digital lenslet array. We also obtained numerical reconstructions, again by using the diffraction calculations, for comparison. The digital and optical reconstruction results are in good agreement. Finally, we showed a method to obtain an <b>orthoscopic</b> image of a 3 D object. We converted an elemental image set that gives real pseudoscopic reconstruction into another elemental image set that gives real <b>orthoscopic</b> reconstruction. Again, we used wave propagation simulations for this purpose. We also demonstrated numerical and optical reconstructions from the obtained elemental image sets for comparison. The results are satisfactory given the physical limitations of the display system. Yöntem, Ali ÖzgürPh. D...|$|E
30|$|The wetting {{properties}} of the ZnO samples were determined by measuring the static contact angle (CA) with a Drop Shape Analysis System, model DSA 100 from Kruss GmbH (Hamburg, Germany) [35]. The sample was placed on a plane stage, under {{the tip of a}} water-dispensing disposable blunt-end stainless steel needle with an outer diameter of 0.5 mm. The needle was attached to a syringe pump controlled by a PC for delivery of the water droplet to the test surface. Drop volume was gradually increased until the drop adhered to the surface this being achieved when the volume reached approximately 3 to 4 μl. All the CA measurements were carried out in the static regime at room temperature. The analysis of the CA and of other drop parameters were performed by the PC using the DSA 3 ® software supplied with the instrument. CA was measured by fitting a circle equation to the shape of the sessile drop (due to the sphere-like shape of the drop) and then calculating the slope of the tangent to the drop at the liquid-solid vapor interface line. The camera was positioned in order to observe the droplet under an angle of about 2 ° to 4 ° with respect to the plane of the sample surface supporting the droplet. Roll-off angles were measured with a goniometer in order to control the tilt angle. The <b>orthoscopic</b> images were obtained using a commercial photocamera.|$|E

Large single crystals were grown from solution for N-methyl-MBANP, which crystallises in a monoclinic space group, and from the melt and solution for 3 -methyl-MBANP which crystallises in an orthorhombic space group. <b>Orthoscopic</b> examination of N-methyl-MBANP revealed no dispersion of the dielectric axes unlike the parent molecule and {{the position of the}} dielectric axes was correlated with the molecular structure. Preparation of prisms from single crystals of both materials facilitated the measurement of refractive indices in the visible and the near infra-red. The values obtained were correlated with the crystal structure and a Sellmeier equation fitted to each of the dispersion curves. The nonlinear optical properties of both materials were evaluated by use of the Maker fringe technique and phase matched intensities. By means of these two methods, the full nonlinear d_i_j tensor was obtained for both materials at a fundamental wavelength of 1064 nm. The linear electro-optic properties of N-methyl-MBANP were evaluated using a conoscopic experiment and correlated with the crystal structure together with the magnitude of all non-zero elements in the d_i_j tensor. Separately, the thermal properties of N-methylurea (NMU), 4 -nitro- 4 '-methylbenzylidene aniline (NMBA) and Zinc TrisThiourea Sulfate (ZTS) were evaluated and all correlated with the crystal structure and bonding.
