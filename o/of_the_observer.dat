40|$|Socially-influenced {{learning}} was studied in observer pigeons that observed a demonstrator in an adjacent chamber performing a target response comprising {{standing on a}} box and pecking a key 10 times. In Experiment 1 {{there was no evidence}} for social learning in <b>the</b> absence <b>of</b> reinforcement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>observer's</b> behavior. When <b>the</b> target response was already established in <b>the</b> <b>observer's</b> repertoire, but was not differentially reinforced in relation to the demonstrator's behavior, rates of extinction were not influenced by the demonstrator's behavior (Experiment 2). Reinforcement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>observer's</b> target response in <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> modeled target response, and not in its absence, resulted in control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>observer's</b> responding by <b>the</b> behavior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> demonstrator (Experiments 3 and 4). This control was extended in Experiment 5 to deferred responses that occurred following a delay since the demonstrator's target responses. <b>The</b> acquisition <b>of</b> social influence depended on differential reinforcement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>observer's</b> target response, with the demonstrator's target behavior serving as the explicit discriminative stimulus...|$|R
5|$|Distant {{regions of}} space {{are assumed to}} exist and {{to be part of}} reality as much as we are, even though we can never {{interact}} with them. The spatial region that we can affect and be affected by is the observable universe. The observable universe depends on the location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>observer.</b> By traveling, an observer can come into contact with a greater region of spacetime than an observer who remains still. Nevertheless, even the most rapid traveler {{will not be able to}} interact with all of space. Typically, the observable universe is taken to mean the portion of the Universe that is observable from our vantage point in the Milky Way.|$|E

5|$|Unless a star {{is being}} {{observed}} {{from the direction}} of its pole, sections of the surface have some amount of movement toward or away from the observer. The component of movement that is in the direction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>observer</b> is called the radial velocity. For the portion of the surface with a radial velocity component toward the observer, the radiation is shifted to a higher frequency because of Doppler shift. Likewise the region that has a component moving away from the observer is shifted to a lower frequency. When the absorption lines of a star are observed, this shift {{at each end of the}} spectrum causes the line to broaden. However, this broadening must be carefully separated from other effects that can increase the line width.|$|E
40|$|Following <b>the</b> work <b>of</b> D. Deutsch, D. Wallace has {{proposed}} a derivation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Born rule in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Everett interpretation.

I will propose a slightly different framework (without any uncertainty <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>observers),</b> which consists in interpreting directly <b>the</b> squared modulus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> amplitudes as proportions of worlds (without supposing that any counting of discrete worlds can be defined); it requires to examine <b>the</b> principles <b>of</b> rationality associated with <b>the</b> notion <b>of</b> proportion of observers in thought experiments involving non-quantum fission <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>observers.</b> I will then analyse <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Deutsch-Wallace derivation in this framework, which consists in an ordering <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rationality principles in the quantum splitting case (distinguishing the primitive principles from the derived ones) ...|$|R

5|$|Battle Mountain {{changed hands}} so often during August {{that there is}} no {{agreement}} on the exact number of times.

The usual pattern was for the North Koreans to take it at night and the US 24th Infantry to recapture it the next day. This type of fluctuating battle resulted in relatively high losses among artillery forward observers and their equipment. During the period of August 15–31, seven forward observers and eight other members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Observer</b> and Liaison Section of the 159th Field Artillery Battalion were casualties, and they lost eight radios, 11 telephones, and two vehicles in the process.|$|E

5|$|Camouflage for {{aircraft}} {{is complicated by}} the fact that the aircraft's background varies widely, depending on the location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>observer,</b> the nature of the background and the aircraft's motion. For this reason, military aircraft were often painted to match the sky when viewed from below, and to either match the ground or break up the aircraft's outline when viewed from above. This is a form of countershading, likely to work best on aircraft such as heavy bombers that do not do fly inverted during combat. Because of the way light hits it, patterns of dark and light will often be present on an aircraft even if it is entirely one color, making it easier to see Reflections and specular highlights can be counteracted by painting an aircraft in neutral shades with a non-reflective, matte finish. There is a trade-off between the effectiveness of camouflage and the size of recognition markings: larger markings reduce the risk of friendly fire through misrecognition, but compromise camouflage.|$|E

5|$|Following Olivia's disappearance, Peter discovers a {{surveillance}} camera in her apartment. He takes its memory device, {{which has been}} overwritten numerous times like a palimpsest, to Walter Bishop's (John Noble) laboratory, using forensic tools to examine previous images on the disc. Lincoln Lee (Seth Gabel) and Phillip Broyles (Lance Reddick) take Nina into custody, learning that someone with Nina's bio-metric signature had accessed the Massive Dynamic supply of Cortexiphan {{over the last few}} months; Nina is surprised by this but refuses to talk. As they work, Walter accuses Peter of taking advantage of Olivia's state, even if unintentionally, imprinting his memories of Olivia of the original timeline onto her. They identify a face belonging to Leland Spivey (Monte Markham), a man with ties to Jones and Nina, and Peter suspects that they are dosing Olivia with Cortexiphan for nefarious purposes.

5|$|In late May and June he {{collected}} and experimented {{on a number}} of the new Sopwith Pups which began to reach British units in January. He was impressed with the aircraft's agility and flew it often. During this period he met the now famous ace Albert Ball who advised him attack tactics against reconnaissance and bomber aircraft. Ball advised McCudden to fly underneath his target, in the blind spot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>observer,</b> and angle his guns directly above then fire. McCudden was intrigued at the prospect and believed this offered a much better chance of shooting down an enemy aircraft. It is not clear if, or how often, McCudden implemented Ball's advice in battle and how many of his victories were claimed that way. McCudden's principal tactics did stress surprise and minimal risk.|$|E
5|$|The {{rotation}} {{of a star}} causes a Doppler shift to the spectrum. On average, {{this results in a}} broadening of the absorption lines in its spectrum, with the lines increasing in width with higher rates of rotation. However, only the rotational motion in the direction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>observer</b> can be measured by this means, so the resulting data provides a lower limit on the star's rotation. This projected rotational velocity of Wolf 359's equator is less than 3 km/s, which is below the threshold of detection through spectral line broadening. This low rate of rotation may have been caused by loss of angular momentum through a stellar wind. Typically, the time scale for the spin down of a star at spectral class M6 is roughly 10 billion years, because fully convective stars like this lose their rotation more slowly than other stars. However, evolutionary models suggest that Wolf 359 is a relatively young star with an age of less than a billion years.|$|E

5|$|Uxbridge Football Club was {{provided}} {{with the use of}} the station stadium from 1923 and played evening matches there. Ten barrack blocks designed by A. Gilpin were built around the parade ground in 1925, as was the RAF officers' hospital and the original Operations Room, controlled by the Fighting Area of Air Defence of Great Britain (ADGB). The Air Ministry chose RAF Uxbridge as the new base for ADGB on 14 January 1926 owing to its proximity to Whitehall. The site had the added advantage of lying on the fringes of London and therefore difficult for an enemy to locate and bomb. Having also housed a gymnasium, the lecture hall building became the station cinema in 1927, initially for the use of station personnel only but soon opened to the general public. On 1 March 1929, the headquarters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Observer</b> Corps was established at Hillingdon House; Air Commodore Edward Masterman was appointed its first commandant. The Observer Corps remained at RAF Uxbridge until 1 March 1936, when it transferred to RAF Bentley Priory.|$|E
