2500|$|While Peter Hitchens {{used to be}} {{an atheist}} like his older brother Christopher Hitchens, he became a Christian later in his life. He {{became a member of the}} Church of England and is now an {{advocate}} of moral virtues founded <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>faith</b> and institutions such as marriage. Today Hitchens defends the use of the Church of England's 1662 Book of Common Prayer and of the King James Bible. Of the latter, he has written [...] "it is not simply a translation, but a poetic translation, written to be read out loud... to lodge in the mind and to disturb the temporal with the haunting sound of the eternal." [...] He argues Christianity has been systematically undermined by social liberals and cultural Marxists. [...] "The left's real interests are moral, cultural, sexual and social. They lead to a powerful state. This is not because they actively set out to achieve one," [...] Hitchens writes. [...] "It is because the left's ideas – by their nature – undermine conscience, self-restraint, deferred gratification, lifelong marriage and strong, indivisible families headed by authoritative fathers." [...] He also believes that the First World War is the cause of the demise of Christianity in Europe.|$|E

60|$|Definitely, then, the {{influence}} of the Popes restored to their ancient supremacy would be exercised in the renewal and consolidation of social order resting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>faith,</b> somewhat after this manner. The anarchic dogma of the sovereignty of peoples, having failed to do anything beyond showing that the greatest evils resulting from obedience do not equal the thousandth part of those which result from rebellion, would be superseded by the practice of appeals to the authority of the Holy See. Do not suppose that the Revolution is at an end, or that the column is replaced because it is raised up from the ground. A man must be blind not to see that all the sovereignties in Europe are growing weak; on all sides confidence and affection are deserting them; sects and the spirit of individualism are multiplying themselves in an appalling manner. There are only two alternatives: you must either purify the will of men, or else you must enchain it; the monarch who will not do the first, must enslave his subjects or perish; servitude or spiritual unity is the only choice open to nations. On the one hand is the gross and unrestrained tyranny of what in modern phrase is styled Imperialism, and on the other a wise and benevolent modification of temporal sovereignty in the interests of all by an established and accepted spiritual power. No middle path lies before the people of Europe. Temporal absolutism we must have. The only question is whether or no it shall be modified by the wise, disinterested, and moderating counsels of the Church, as given by her consecrated chief.|$|E

6000|$|These {{converts}} {{had been}} under preparation {{for more than a}} year, and seemed thoroughly convinced and fairly instructed. Therefore the baptismal service was read by Mr. Deerr; and when the vows were reached, the Bishop turned to <b>the</b> <b>Christians</b> around and asked if they would be witnesses and godparents to these candidates; and, with one voice, they shouted that they would. Each candidate was singly baptized, and then came up to the Bishop, by whom the words receiving him into the Ark of Christ's Church were spoken. At Ranobunda there was another baptism of 250, and, in the whole district, full a thousand were admitted. It was not in over-confident joy. [...] "Time will show," [...] said the Bishop, [...] "who are wheat and who are tares."
