40|$|The {{influence}} of polarization filtering on maximum detection, recognition, and identification ranges of a generic second generation FLIR sensor is examined with a computational model. The scenario studied represents a second generation FLIR sensor mounted on an aircraft {{in level flight}} at 3 OOm approaching a ship target. The target ship radiant signature is modeled with an advanced infrared signature prediction program, MuSES (Multi-Service Electro- <b>Optic</b> <b>Signature).</b> A weather file representative of Midlatitude Summer at sea conditions was utilized. Polarized sea background and path radiance calculations are performed with a polarized version of the SEARAD Radiance and Propagation Code. Results showed {{that there is an}} improvement in maximum range of the sensor for detection, recognition, and identification tasks when a horizontal filter is included, provided that the target does not have a negative degree of polarization. For detection task the improvements were found to be 33. 48 %, 35. 65 %, and 39. 78 % when the target has 0 %, + 2 %, and + 8 % degree of polarization respectively. A better modeling of Apparent Temperature Difference (ATD) calculation is also developed. To improve the model use of polarized target model is recommended[URL] Army author...|$|E
