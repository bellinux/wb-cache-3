The strong dependence of monochromatic surface brightness on redshift also implies that observed morphology of distant systems will be crucially dependent on the limiting surface brightness set by the sky background. Although the angle subtended by sources depends only weakly on z, the fraction of a galaxy whose surface brightness is above the detection threshold varies strongly with z.

The optical transmission of sapphire does not actually extend to cover the entire mid-infrared range (3-5 µm), but starts to drop off at wavelengths greater than approximately 4.5 µm at room temperature. While the strength of sapphire is better than that of other available mid-range infrared dome materials at room temperature, it weakens above 600 °C.

5000|$|The high accuracy, {{the large}} number of stars {{observed}} and the long period of observation make Kepler ideal for detecting superflares. Studies published in 2012 and 2013 involved 83,000 stars over a period of 500 days (much of the data analysis was carried out with the help of five first-year undergraduates). The stars were selected from the Kepler Input Catalog to have Teff, the effective temperature, between 5100 and 6000K (the solar value is 5750K) to find stars of similar spectral class to the Sun, and the surface gravity log g > 4.0 to eliminate sub-giants and giants. The spectral classes range from F8 to G8. The integration time was 30 min in the original study. 1547 superflares were found on 279 solar-type stars.The most intense events increased the brightness of the stars by 30% and had an energy of 1036 ergs. White-light flares on the Sun change the brightness by about 0.01%, and the strongest flares have a visible-light energy of about 1032 [...] ergs. (All energies quoted are in the <b>optical</b> <b>bandpass</b> and so are lower limits since some energy is emitted at other wavelengths.) Most events were much less energetic than this: flare amplitudes below 0.1% of the stellar value and energies of 2 × 1033 ergs were detectable with the 30 minute integration. The flares had a rapid rise followed by an exponential decay on a time scale of 1-3 hours. The most powerful events corresponded to energies ten thousand greater than the largest flares observed on the Sun. Some stars flared very frequently: one star showed 57 events in 500 days, a rate of one every nine days. For the statistics of flares, the number of flares decreased with energy E roughly as E−2, a similar behaviour to solar flares. The duration of the flare increased with its energy, again in accordance with the solar behaviour.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{timing and}} {{duration}} of the reionization epoch {{is crucial to the}} emergence and evolution of structure in the universe. The relative roles that star-forming galaxies, active galactic nuclei and quasars play in contributing to the metagalactic ionizing background across cosmic time remains uncertain. Deep quasar counts provide insights into their role, but the potentially crucial contribution from star-formation is highly uncertain due to our poor understanding of the processes that allow ionizing radiation to escape into the intergalactic medium (IGM). The fraction of ionizing photons that escape from star-forming galaxies is a fundamental free parameter used in models to "fine-tune " the timing {{and duration of}} the reionization epoch that occurred somewhere between 13. 4 and 12. 7 Gyrs ago (redshifts between 12 > z> 6). However, direct observation of Lyman continuum (LyC) photons emitted below the rest frame H I ionization edge at 912 Å is increasingly improbable at redshifts z> 3, due to the steady increase of intervening Lyman limit systems towards high z.

At faint magnitudes, the logarithmic slope of the galaxy counts is flatter than 0. 4 in all seven UBVIJHK <b>optical</b> <b>bandpasses</b> of the Hubble Deep Field-South imaging survey.

If the initial mass function has a Salpeter slope with a lower mass cutoff consistent with observations of M subdwarf disk stars, a lower limit of Omega_*> 0. 005 (at Hubble constant 50 km/s/Mpc) is derived for the visible (processed gas + stars) mass density needed to generate an extragalactic background light (EBL) at a level of 50 nW/m 2 /sr.

For the system TrES- 2, this thesis examines 14 different different transit observations. Because of this large quantity of data, the parameters Rp/R., b, a/R., and i are also fitted for with precision using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique, and the resultant parameter values are presented. Transit-timing analysis is performed on all systems: CoRoT- 2, GJ 436, HAT-P- 1, HD 17156, HD 189733, TrES- 1, TrES- 2, WASP- 2, WASP- 3, XO- 1, XO- 2, and XO- 3. Transit timing is important both for constraining the orbital period and to search for variations in the transit-to-transit interval that could indicate {{the presence of an}} unseen companion planet. The transit center times for nearly all observations are found, and the planetary periods for all systems are calculated. In many cases these periods are determined with much greater precision than previously known.
