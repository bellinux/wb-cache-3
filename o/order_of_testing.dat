The <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> diets comprised <b>of</b> two different sets: trial 1 with the fluid first and trial 2 with the semi-solid food first.

30|$|In {{this study}} we chose to model acute {{longitudinal}} tears of the posterior medial meniscus as lesions of this type are frequently seen in traumatic athletic injuries and chronic ACL deficiency. However, {{we have no evidence}} to support extrapolation of our findings to other tear morphologies observed in the knee (Yoo et al. 2009). We measured meniscal displacement and internal deformation under static loading simulating the principal phases of weight-bearing during gait, and observed no suture failures. However, during rehabilitation after meniscal injury, mechanical failure of the suture construct may occur due to the cyclic loading conditions imposed on the knee joint (Komistek et al. 1998; Pujol et al. 2008; Taylor et al. 2004). It would be interesting from a clinical standpoint to add additional gait cycles which may better simulate the initial response in the weeks after surgery but prior to healing. However, this model which uses multiples of body weight would likely fail as cadaveric tissue begins to degrade. While we used multiples of bodyweight necessary to simulate walking, joint reactive forces across the knee with running and stair-climbing were not addressed by this study and significantly exceed those generated during walking. The <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>testing</b> was always intact first, as this was followed by tear creation. Ideally, one would vary the <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>testing</b> for the torn and repaired states to minimize the potential laxity of cadaveric soft tissues, which can occur during repeated testing. However, the torn state was tested after the repaired state by removing the sutures and minimizing the chance that a bead was lost, as a pilot study had shown the torn state to be the most mobile.|$|E
40|$|Background: Pain {{markedly}} activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis {{and increases}} plasma corticosterone release interfering significantly with nociceptive {{behaviour as well}} as the mechanism of action of analgesic drugs. Aims/Methods: In the present study, we monitored the time course of circulating corticosterone in two mouse strains (C 57 Bl/ 6 and Balb/C) under different pain models. In addition, the stress response was investigated following animal handling, intrathecal (i. t.) manipulation and habituation to environmental conditions commonly used in nociceptive experimental assays. We also examined the influence of within-cage <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>testing</b> on plasma corticosterone. Results: Subcutaneous injection of capsaicin precipitated a prompt stress response whereas carrageenan and complete Freund's adjuvant induced an increased corticosterone release around the third hour post-injection. However, carrageenan induced a longer increased corticosterone in C 57 Bl/ 6 mice. In partial sciatic nerve ligation, neuropathic pain model corticosterone increased only in the first days whereas mechanical hypersensitivity remained much longer. Animal handling also represents an important stressor whereas the i. t. injection per se does not exacerbate the handling-induced stress response. Moreover, the <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>testing</b> animals from the same cage does not interfere with plasma corticosterone levels in the intrathecal procedure. Animal habituation to the testing apparatus also does not reduce the immediate corticosterone increase as compared with non-habituated mice. Conclusion: Our data indicate that HPA axis activation in acute and chronic pain models is time dependent and may be dissociated from evoked hyperalgesia. Therefore, HPA-axis activation represents an important variable to be considered when designing experimental assays of persistent pain as well as for interpretation of data.

40|$|Abstract—Software testing aims {{to assure}} the quality <b>of</b> {{software}} under <b>test.</b> To improve the efficiency <b>of</b> software <b>testing,</b> especially regression testing, test-case prioritization is proposed to schedule the execution <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> cases in software testing. Among various test-case prioritization techniques, the simple additional coverage-based technique, which is a greedy strategy, achieves surprisingly competitive empirical results. To investigate how much difference there is between the order produced by the additional technique and the optimal <b>order</b> in terms <b>of</b> coverage, we conduct a study on various empirical properties of optimal coverage-based test-case prioritization. To enable us to achieve the optimal order in acceptable time for our object programs, we formulate optimal coverage-based test-case prioritization as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem. Then we conduct an empirical study for comparing the optimal technique with the simple additional coverage-based technique. From this empirical study, the optimal technique can only slightly outperform the additional coverage-based technique with {{no statistically significant difference}} in terms of coverage, and the latter significantly outperforms the former in terms of either fault detection or execution time. As the optimal technique schedules the execution <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> cases based on their structural coverage rather than detected faults, we further implement the ideal optimal test-case prioritization technique, which schedules the execution <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> cases based on their detected faults.

40|$|Abstract—Test-case {{prioritization}} is {{to schedule}} the execution <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> cases {{so as to}} maximize some objective (e. g., revealing faults early). The existing test-case prioritization ap-proaches separate the process of test-case prioritization {{and the process of}} test-case execution by presenting the execution <b>order</b> <b>of</b> all <b>test</b> cases before programmers start running test cases. As the execution information of the modified program is not available for the existing test-case prioritization approaches, these approaches mainly rely on only the execution information of the previous program before modification. To address this problem, we present an adaptive test-case prioritization approach, which determines the execution <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> cases simultaneously during the execution <b>of</b> <b>test</b> cases. In particular, the adaptive approach selects test cases based on their fault-detection capability, which is calculated based on the output <b>of</b> selected <b>test</b> cases. As soon as a test case is selected and runs, the fault-detection capability <b>of</b> each unselected <b>test</b> case is modified according to the output of the latest selected test case. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive approach, we conducted an experimental study on eight C programs and four Java programs. The experimental results show that the adaptive approach is usually significantly better than the total test-case prioritization approach and competitive to the additional test-case prioritization approach. Moreover, the adaptive approach is better than the additional approach on some subjects (e. g, replace and schedule).

In this paper, we propose string dissimilarity-based priority assignment to test cases through the combination of classical and non-classical textual comparison metrics and elaborate a prioritization algorithm considering requirement changes. The proposed technique is suitable {{to be used as}} a preliminary testing when the information of the entire program is not in possession. We performed evaluation on random permutations and three textual comparison metrics and concluded the findings of the experiment...|$|R
