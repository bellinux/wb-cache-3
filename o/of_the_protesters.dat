5|$|More than 5,000 Brazilians {{marched to}} the crash site on July 29, 2007, blaming their government's failure to invest in airport {{infrastructure}} for the crash. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>protesters</b> also demanded the ousting of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} arguments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>protesters</b> {{were their}} concern about making wildlife species, {{such as the}} Chalkhill Blue butterfly, extinct, putting a highly visible scar on the landscape, and that they believed the new motorway would not adequately resolve traffic problems.|$|E

5|$|At {{about six}} {{o'clock in the}} morning, some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>protesters</b> {{discovered}} a small gate to the palace was unguarded. Making their way inside, they searched for the queen's bedchamber. The royal guards raced throughout the palace, bolting doors and barricading hallways {{and those in the}} compromised sector, the cour de marbre, fired their guns at the intruders, killing a young member of the crowd. Infuriated, the rest surged towards the breach and streamed inside.|$|E
5|$|During {{the night}} of 3–4 February, there were tanks {{on the street in}} Cairo as many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>protesters</b> again spent the night in Tahrir Square. Pro-government protesters were active and {{small-scale}} clashes happened in the early hours. Ahmad Mohamed Mahmoud of Al-Ta'awun became the first journalist to die covering the protests, from gunshot wounds sustained on 28January.|$|E
5|$|During the protest, {{the crowd}} {{assaulted}} a JNA armoured personnel carrier {{and managed to}} remove a machine gun mounted on the vehicle, while one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>protesters,</b> Ivica Balić, hoisted a Croatian flag at the building to singing of the Croatian anthem by the crowd. In a scuffle which broke {{out in front of}} the building, Saško Gešovski, a JNA conscript from Macedonia, was killed by a shot fired from the crowd. By the end of the afternoon, the crowd removed the Yugoslav flag from the building, moved away and dispersed.|$|E

50|$|After Nauru's main {{police station}} was burned on 7 March 2008 by protesters in Harris' Aiwo {{constituency}} who were upset by phosphate dust, the government accused Harris <b>of</b> instigating <b>the</b> <b>protesters.</b>|$|R
2500|$|During {{the park}} {{occupation}} the New York City Police Department assigned Rick Lee, a First Precinct community relations detective, to duty at the demonstration. He acted as one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main liaisons with <b>the</b> <b>protesters</b> on behalf <b>of</b> <b>the</b> police department, and advised protesters on {{such matters as}} avoiding arrest and getting along with police as well as attempting to get information <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>protester's</b> plans. As a plainclothes officer, he {{was referred to as}} the [...] "hipster cop" [...] for his attire consisting of glasses, cardigan sweaters, skinny ties and skinny trousers. Reaction to his presence was mixed.|$|R
5|$|The NAACP was {{responsible}} for managing most sit-in related cases that {{made it to the}} Supreme Court, winning nearly every decision. But it fell to the ACLU and other legal volunteer efforts to provide legal representation to hundreds of protestorswhite and blackwho were arrested while protesting in the South. The ACLU joined with other civil liberties groups to form the Lawyers Constitutional Defense Committee (LCDC) which subsequently provided legal representation to many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>protesters.</b> The ACLU provided the majority of the funding for the LCDC.|$|E
5|$|As {{the demonstrations}} continued, Ambassador Nolting managed to extract {{theoretical}} concessions from Diệm on 18 May. Diệm agreed a modest compensation package of USD $7000 {{for the families}} of the victims as a conciliatory gesture. Diệm also agreed to dismiss those responsible for the shootings. However, the publicly stated reason for this action was that the officials had failed to maintain order, rather than that they had been responsible for the deaths <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>protesters.</b> Despite these concessions, Diệm maintained that his government was not responsible for the deaths, resolutely continuing to blame the Việt Cộng. It was enough to satisfy Nolting, who immediately departed for his vacation. His absence allowed the remaining American diplomatic staff led by William Trueheart, Nolting's deputy, to end Nolting's policy of appeasing Diệm.|$|E
5|$|Life {{magazine}} {{decided to}} publish a photo story for their January 15, 1951 edition, which would document {{the results of the}} competition and feature a photograph <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>protesters.</b> Life initially wanted to photograph the painters {{on the steps of the}} Metropolitan, with their paintings. They refused on the grounds that it would look like they were trying to enter the museum, but were being rebuffed. The magazine capitulated; art editor for Life, Dorothy Seiberling, sent photographer Nina Leen to photograph them at a studio on 44th Street. They assembled there on November 24. Only three of the original signatories were absent: Weldon Kees, Hans Hofmann, and Fritz Bultman. Pollock made a special trip with James Brooks for the session.|$|E

25|$|About 1,000 draft {{cards were}} turned in on April 3, 1968, in {{nationwide}} protests organized by The Mobe. In Boston, 15,000 protesters watched 235 men turn in their draft cards. War protesters were increasingly choosing the more profound act of turning in their draft cards, an act {{which gave the}} government {{the name and address}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>protester.</b> Burning <b>the</b> draft card destroyed the evidence, and by this time was seen as less courageous.|$|R
50|$|Dozens of anti-government <b>protesters</b> took to <b>the</b> streets <b>of</b> Ma'ameer on Tuesday {{evening to}} commemorate <b>the</b> victims <b>of</b> <b>the</b> regime. <b>The</b> <b>protesters</b> held candles and {{pictures}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> victims including 16-year-old Ali Abbas Radhi, whom activists say {{was killed on}} 9 November when {{he was hit by}} a car as he was being chased by Bahraini police forces.|$|R
5|$|The {{following}} day {{a large number}} of people staged protests near Jantar Mantar, New Delhi. There were minor clashes between some groups of protesters and the police; the police then removed some protesters from the area. One group of protesters also observed a one-day hunger strike at Jantar Mantar. All roads leading to India Gate were closed by police and areas where protesters had gathered during the previous week were out of bounds to the public. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>protesters</b> drew graffiti and slogans on papers spread on the road, condemning the incident and demanding stricter laws and speedy judgement. The BJP renewed its demand for a special parliament session to discuss the case and to adopt stricter laws on crime against women.|$|E
5|$|When {{the state}} would not enforce his {{order to reduce the}} catch of non-Indian {{commercial}} fishermen, Boldt took direct action, placing the matter under federal supervision. The United States Coast Guard and the National Marine Fisheries Service were ordered to enforce the ruling and soon had boats in the water confronting violators. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>protesters</b> rammed Coast Guard boats and at least one member of the Coast Guard was shot. Those whom the officers caught breaking the court's orders were taken before federal magistrates and fined for contempt, and the illegal fishing as a protest stopped. The United States District Court continued to exercise jurisdiction over the matter, determining traditional fishing locations and compiling major orders of the court.|$|E
25|$|The {{university}} cut off outside resupply <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>protesters</b> on June 19, 2008. The university {{claimed in}} a letter to the Berkeley City Council that to the best of their knowledge the protesters had sufficient food and water and that the university would take action to maintain the health and safety <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>protesters</b> should they not come down. In response to the cutting off of supplies the City Council voted to send two city officials to the grove to check on the welfare <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>protesters</b> on June 24, 2008. The two officials, the Assistant City Manager and the Assistant Fire Chief, reported to the City Council on June 25, 2008, the protesters did indeed have sufficient food and water, and would refuse any supplies offered by the UCPD. Later that same day Mayor Tom Bates and City Manager Phil Kamlarz met with university officials to discuss the health of the tree-sitters.|$|E

5|$|During the Bahraini uprising, Bahrain foreign {{minister}} Khalid ibn Ahmad Al Khalifah labeled Hezbollah {{a terrorist group}} and accused them <b>of</b> supporting <b>the</b> <b>protesters.</b> On 10 April 2013, Bahrain blacklisted Hezbollah as a terrorist group, being the first Arab state in this regard.|$|R
5|$|The local {{government}} announced on <b>the</b> morning <b>of</b> 3 July that the copper plant construction would be suspended. Protests {{continued into the}} evening, with demonstrators demanding <b>the</b> release <b>of</b> <b>the</b> detained <b>protesters,</b> most <b>of</b> whom were students. Late in <b>the</b> evening <b>of</b> 3 July, authorities released 21 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 27 detained <b>protesters.</b> Protests subsided, though six remained in custody facing criminal and administrative charges for {{their role in the}} demonstrations.|$|R

25|$|When Singer {{tried to}} speak during a lecture at Saarbrücken, he was {{interrupted}} by a group of protesters including advocates for disability rights. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>protesters</b> expressed that entering serious discussions would be a tactical error.|$|E
25|$|Self-immolations by Tibetans protesting Chinese {{domination}} of Tibet {{have had a}} greater impact than earlier protests; despite considerable loss <b>of</b> life during <b>the</b> Tibetan protests in 2008 on <b>the</b> part <b>of</b> both <b>the</b> Tibetan and Han population in Tibet, casualties were simply not reported by the Chinese government. Self-immolations, on the other hand, result in dramatic images <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>protester</b> while burning or afterwards which can be easily transmitted over the internet to news media and supporters. Internet access has reached even remote areas in <b>the</b> parts <b>of</b> China where Tibetans live.|$|R
50|$|Following massive {{arrests of}} civilians and reformist activists by Iranian police, {{a number of}} Iranian intellectuals and reformist activists {{condemned}} the detentions, and called for <b>the</b> release <b>of</b> <b>the</b> imprisoned <b>protesters.</b>|$|R

25|$|A {{majority}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>protesters</b> in Tahrir square who {{had been}} at the sit-in after deadly clashes a week earlier, left their sit-in to join the polls before returning to Tahrir Square, although some boycotted the election.|$|E
25|$|Also at 9pm, as {{the protest}} began to gather, 300 members of {{conservative}} groups, including the Korea Parents Association, physically blocked two public buses from crossing Yeongdo bridge into Yeongdo shipyard. The conservative protesters asked the bus passengers to disembark before forcibly dragging passengers off the bus. Before police could {{take control of}} the situation, one man was injured. The bridge would not be cleared until 11pm, when the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>protesters</b> made their final advance to the official gathering place 800m from the Yeongdo shipyard. In the process of the final advance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>protesters,</b> there were more minor scuffles with police.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "Navy–Vieques protests" [...] is {{the name}} given by the English-speaking media {{to a series of}} protests {{starting}} in 1999 on the Puerto Rican island-municipality <b>of</b> Vieques. <b>The</b> <b>protesters</b> were against <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> island by the United States Navy and United States Marine Corps for bombing target practice.|$|R
50|$|Bart, needing {{money for}} the new video game console Gamestation 256, takes a job hanging menus on doors for a Thai restaurant. Lisa is {{concerned}} that the menus are wasting paper and hurting the environment, but the family ignores her worries. On a trip to Krusty Burger to celebrate Bart's new job, they see protesters dressed as cows on <b>the</b> roof <b>of</b> <b>the</b> restaurant. <b>The</b> <b>protesters</b> unfurl a banner and accuse Krusty Burger <b>of</b> deforesting <b>the</b> rainforest to create grazing land for cattle. The police arrive and shoot <b>the</b> <b>protesters</b> with bean bag rounds. As <b>the</b> <b>protesters</b> are being arrested, Lisa meets their leader—radical environmentalist Jesse Grass—and is instantly smitten with him.|$|R
25|$|Although the new fence was {{constructed}} {{to allow the}} UCPD to control entry into and out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> grove, <b>protesters</b> were still able to access their platforms by climbing a nearby telephone pole on city property.|$|R
