5000|$|In 2002, aerogel {{held the}} Guinness World Record {{for the least}} dense (lightest) solid. [...] Aerogel is mostly air because its {{structure}} is {{like that of a}} highly vacuous sponge. Therefore, the lightness and low density is due primarily to the large proportion of air within the solid and not the silicon construction materials. Taking advantage of this, SEAgel, in the same family as aerogel but made from agar, can be filled with helium gas to create a solid which floats when placed in an <b>open</b> <b>top</b> <b>container</b> filled with a dense gas.|$|E

50|$|Sand casting {{involves}} the use of hot molten glass poured directly into a preformed mould. It is a process similar to casting metal into a mould. The sand mould is typically prepared by using a mixture of clean sand and a small proportion of the water-absorbing clay bentonite. Bentonite acts as a binding material. In the process, a small amount of water is added to the sand-bentonite mixture and this is well mixed and sifted before addition to an <b>open</b> <b>topped</b> <b>container.</b> A template is prepared (typically made of wood, or a found object or even a body part such as a hand or fist) which is tightly pressed into the sand to make a clean impression. This impression then forms the mould.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: − This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the illustration, calculation and optimisation of dynamics of complex systems. The models to be analysed consist of ordinary differential equations (ODE) or their combination with partial differential equations (PDE). In order to perform an optimisation the systems must be modelled and simulated. The modelling is performed using standard approaches. The simulation is performed using the approach of direct shooting. This approach will be discussed and justified for the given applications. Furthermore two applications are illustrated. The optimisation of the motion of a six degree of freedom robot and an optimisation of the transport motion of an <b>open</b> <b>topped</b> fluid filled <b>container</b> within a warehouse environment. In particular optimal trajectories are numerically calculated using sequential quadratic programming (SQP). Several constraints must be accomplished. The objective of the optimisation is the motion time of these systems to reach a predefined position in space. Key-Words: − SQP; ODE; PDE; Optimal Control; Fluid-Structure Interaction...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} how Tipping Point Analysis {{can be used}} to predict the onset of structural strain, induced by ice formation. In civil structures, water-ice transitions present many potential issues that can lead to structural damage or plant shutdowns. Examples include freeze-thaw damage in concrete and masonry, and ice build-up on moving parts such as wind turbine blades. Early indication of ice formation could prevent irreparable damage if this information could be used to actuate de-icing procedures. The transition considered in this work is the strain induced in a polypropylene container by the volume change of water as it freezes, measured using surface-mounted fibre-optic strain sensors. This first order phase transition can be detected early on using degenerate fingerprinting, which identifies “slowing down” of the noise prior to the critical point of the transition. Water was supercooled which, at freezing, causes a rapid increase in temperature, presenting an identifiable specific transition point for reference. The analysis was able to consistently predict freezing around 5 - 10 minutes prior to the transition. A linear relationship was found between mass calculated from the calorimetric equation and mass from experimental measurements. Strain could not be estimated from this mass, since the random process of freezing in an <b>open</b> <b>top</b> <b>container</b> causes an irregular distribution of force. These tests will allow the method and the model to be continually developed towards a more practical application...|$|E
40|$|Three coiled tube heat {{exchanger}} prototypes were designed to extract heat from containers holding 0. 5 kg, 2. 3 kg, and 10. 5 kg of Sodium Nitrate-Potassium Nitrate salt. All of the prototypes were left with an open surface free to undergo radiation losses and surface convection. The first objective was to measure the power extraction over time for each prototype. Coiled tube {{heat exchanger}}s were modeled as a tube with a constant wall temperature. Air is used as the working fluid, with a maximum Reynolds number of 2000 at a maximum flow rate of 10 standard liters per minute (SLPM) at air flow temperatures above 900 °C. The accuracy of the power extraction model for the three prototypes in increasing order: 46 %, 35 %, and 43 % of the measured data. The duration of power extraction with an <b>open</b> <b>top</b> <b>container</b> for the first (P- 1), second (P-l 1), and third (P-II) prototype respectively are: 14 min, 29 min, 45 min producing an average power of 22 W, 23 W, and 22 W respectively. To compare across the prototypes, the data provided is for bath bulk temperatures starting at 330 °C and ending at 275 ' C. Prototype three produced 25 W for 123 minutes for the same temperature change in the bulk temperature (330 ° to 275 °C) with the lights off and a thermal lid, to reduce radiation and surface convection losses. The thermal lid improved the extraction duration {{by a factor of}} four. The second objective was to characterize the thermal loss rate (W) of the each prototype. The thermal loss rate model is accurate within 28. 9 % (P- 1), 28. 7 % (P- 11), and 24. 7 % (P-III) of the measured values. There is evidence of convection cells in prototype two and three. A high temperature Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) system has been proposed to measure the magnitude of the convection cells, and a proof of concept setup has been tested. Particles native to the molten salt are illuminated using a Class 3 b laser (power < 5 mW). The laser beam is converted into a plane using a polypropylene conical centrifuge tube filled with water. by Folkers Eduardo Rojas. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Waste biomass {{is often}} a {{liability}} to many municipalities. Technologies exist that can turn this biomass into energy which can then be sold. Anaerobic digestion {{is one of the}} important technologies that utilises this biomass to turn it into biogas. One of the factors that affects the rate that biogas can be produced is the speed that suitable organic compounds can be delivered to methanogenic microorganisms. These organic compounds such as sugars and amino acids are released from plant material at different rates depending on their availability. A portion of the compounds are readily soluble in water and are immediately available, some of the compounds are locked up inside the plant cells and some of the compounds such as cellulose are not soluble and need to be hydrolysed into sugars before they can be converted into methane. Hydrolysis is usually the rate limiting step in anaerobic digestion. Leaching of green waste was investigated as a form of pre-treatment to externalise the initial stages in anaerobic digestion that makes soluble organic compounds available for the consecutive mthanogenic stages of anaerobic digestion. The added benefit of leaching is it removes the complexity of solids handling from inside anaerobic digester. Many various forms of leaching technologies that are coupled to anaerobic digesters have been trialled with grass and silage, little research was found on leaching green waste and few trials had used the simplified unheated flooded tank system as tested here. Pilot and laboratory leaching trials were conducted on shredded green waste as well as grass clippings to establish the efficiency of leaching by measuring the COD yields in the leachate. Additionally, rumen contents from cattle rumen were added to grass clippings in order to investigate if the leaching efficiency from the grass could be improved. Leaching was tested at a pilot scale in an open to the air reactor tank in ambient temperature in a temperate climate. Hydraulic retention times ranging from 4 hours to 7 days were tested to establish the most effective leaching strategy. The laboratory trials were conducted with the temperature controlled at 25 °C to simulate ambient environmental conditions in a temperate climate. The effect of storing feedstock was tested to see how changes in handling times affected the process. Gas production from the leachate was tested using 2 L CSTR (Continuously Stirred Tank Reactor) anaerobic digesters to confirm the usability of the leachate as a feedstock in an anaerobic digester. Pilot scale trials of shredded green waste and grass clippings gave maximum COD concentrations of 5. 4 ± 0. 5 and 47 ± 4 g COD / L of leachate respectively. Pilot trials of shredded green waste and grass leachate reached a maximum total COD yields of 53 ± 2 and 410 ± 20 kg COD / tonne VS respectively. Laboratory scale trials of shredded green waste and grass clippings gave maximum COD concentrations of 7. 0 ± 0. 1 and 49 ± 2 g COD / L of leachate respectively. Laboratory trials of shredded green waste and grass leachate reached a maximum total COD yields of 132 ± 8 and 410 ± 20 kg COD / tonne VS respectively. Laboratory trials are indicative of how pilot trials will behave and differences are likely to be due to an increased bulk density in solids in pilot trials. Shredded green waste and grass leachate gave maximum 3. 7 and 7. 8 g BOD / L respectively. Nutrients in the leachate were tested: nitrogen levels in shredded green waste and grass leachate reached maximum levels of 51 and 460 mg / L respectively; DRP (Dissolved Reactive Phosphorus) levels in the shredded green waste and grass leachate reached maximum levels of 6 and 85 mg / L respectively. The leaching tanks produced gas while leaching was taking place; a sample of this gas was captured and the levels of CH 4, CO 2 and H 2 were measured as 0 %, 25. 5 % and 5. 0 % respectively. Gas production from anaerobic digestion of shredded green waste and grass in a CSTR at 35 °C produced 0. 23 ± 0. 01 and 0. 534 ± 0. 005 m 3 biogas / kg COD respectively. Use of grass that is fresh gives much higher yields of dissolved organic compounds in the leachate than when the grass is stored in covered area for 30 days. Leaching grass with an HRT (Hydraulic Retention Time) of 1 day gave optimal results in terms of concentration and yields of dissolved organic compounds in the leachate compared to leaching trials with an HRT of 4 hours or 7 days. Green waste gave much lower concentration and yields of COD than grass and an HRT of 7 days was the most suitable for gaining the best concentration and yield of dissolved organic compounds compared to a 4 hour or 1 day HRT. The overall mass transfer of organic compounds when leaching freshly shredded green waste is most likely limited by a combination of hydrolysis and the rate that soluble compounds are released from within plant cells as the cell membranes degrade. In trials of fresh and stored grass and stored shredded green waste, shortening the HRT increases the total yield of dissolved organic compounds leached into the leachate; however, this is at the expense of increased concentrations of dissolved organic compounds within the leachate. The lower leachate concentrations with the shorter HRTs means that the leachate is less suitable to uses as a feedstock for an anaerobic digester. Anaerobic digestion of grass leachate produced much more biogas / kg COD than anaerobic digestion of shredded green waste leachate, this may be a result of an inhibiting compounds such as tannins, additionally to this the material that the shredded green waste is composed of will have higher levels of lignocellulose materials that are not readily soluble. The leachate was found not to degrade when stored at 25 °C in an <b>open</b> <b>top</b> <b>container,</b> this maybe a result of low pH inhibiting degrading micro-organisms, this has significant benefit as the leaching process can be separated from the anaerobic digestion process without degrading the quality of the leachate while it is being stored...|$|E
5000|$|A well car, {{also known}} as a double-stack car or stack car (also well wagon), is a type of {{railroad}} car specially designed to carry intermodal containers (shipping containers) used in intermodal freight transport. The [...] "well" [...] is a depressed section which sits close to the rails between the wheel trucks of the car, allowing a container to be carried lower than on a traditional flatcar.

40|$|This study focusses on {{the urban}} {{infrastructure}} for water supply in Roman Pompeii. The water distribution network of lead pipes was constructed {{inside the city}} walls, {{at the time when}} the city was connected to an aqueduct. Life for the Pompeiians changed considerably when aqueduct water started running continuously in street fountains all around the city. The study is based on previous research and on my own investigations and measurements on site in connection with the Swedish Pompeii Project. The thesis presents a new interpretation of the main water system, in specific, the interconnection of the water towers. Three main water pipelines were connected from a distributor building, Castellum Aquae, located at the highest level in the city, and supplied water to the <b>top</b> <b>containers</b> on at least fourteen water towers. The main water system worked on the principle that water could flow down from the <b>top</b> <b>container</b> of one water tower to the next provided that this was located at a lower level. Investigations and measurements of the vertical grooves {{on the sides of the}} water towers support my conclusion that two of the water towers were designed to supply water to two public baths. Three of the water towers were built with a groove for a connection to other water towers in the not yet excavated parts of the city. The study also presents a small part of the water distribution for public and private use. The design of individual pipes from the <b>top</b> <b>container</b> of water towers to all street fountains, public baths, houses and workshops was based not only on the shortest distance between water tower and water user, but also on the head between the level of the <b>top</b> <b>container</b> and the level of the water user.
