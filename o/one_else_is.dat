25|$|In {{the process}} of {{investigating}} Cistern 10, Warren discovered tunnels that lay under the Triple Gate passageway. These passages lead in erratic directions, some leading beyond the southern edge of the Temple Mount (they are at a depth below the base of the walls); their purpose is currently unknown – as is whether they predate the Temple Mount – a situation not helped by the fact that apart from Warren's expedition no <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> known to have visited them.|$|E

25|$|The recent Sino-Angolan {{association}} is illustrative. When a petroleum-rich area called for investment and rebuilding, China advanced a $5 billion loan to be repaid in oil. They sent Chinese technicians, fixing {{a large part}} of the electrical system, and leading a part of the reconstruction. In the short term Angola benefits from Chinese-built roads, hospitals, schools, hotels, football stadiums, shopping centers and telecommunications projects. In turn, Angola mortgaged future oil production of a valuable, non-renewable resource. It may turn out to be a costly trade for Angola, but their needs for infrastructure is immediate and that is precisely what China provideds when no <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> willing to do so. And thusly, Angola has become China's leading energy supplier.|$|E

Peggy asks Frank to move in with her at the Vic and they soon announce their engagement. Roy remains jealous of Frank, believing Pat has feelings for her ex-husband. When Pat turns to Frank following an argument with Roy and is seen leaving his flat, Roy and Peggy believe Frank and Pat are having an affair.

500|$|According to Raul Hilberg, Finkelstein {{displays}} [...] "academic {{courage to}} speak the truth when no <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> out there to support him... I would say that his place in the whole history of writing history is assured, and that those who in the end are proven right triumph, and he will be among those who will have triumphed, albeit, it so seems, at great cost." [...] In a peer review for Beyond Chutzpah, Avi Shlaim said that Finkelstein [...] "has a most impressive track record in exposing spurious American-Jewish scholarship on the Arab-Israeli conflict." [...] He praised Finkelstein for [...] "all the sterling qualities for which he has become famous: erudition, originality, spark, meticulous attention to detail, intellectual integrity, courage, and formidable forensic skills." ...|$|E
500|$|The 1960s and 1970s saw {{a further}} {{reassessment}} of Chamberlain as a Cabinet minister. Historians such as A. J. P. Taylor {{pointed out that}} while the 1930s were a decade of misery for some, for most Britons, {{it was a time}} of rising living-standards, with unemployment concentrated in only a few regions of the country. As economists and historians came to question the assumption that the National Government could have spent its way out of unemployment, Chamberlain's tenure as Chancellor was to an extent rehabilitated. American social historian Bentley Gilbert stated that Chamberlain was [...] "the most successful social reformer in the seventeen years between 1922 and 1939... after 1922 no <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> really of any significance." [...] According to Taylor, writing in 1965, Chamberlain did more to improve local government while serving as Health Minister than did anyone else in the 20th century.|$|E
500|$|The {{people in}} the {{wardrobe}} are uncomfortable, not least because of John's odour. Geraldine passes around mints as Andrew tells Mark {{that he no longer}} has contact with Dicky Lawrence, a potential business contact of Mark's. Andrew sings the [...] "sardine song", but Carl angrily stops him. Andrew and Geraldine reminisce about a scout jamboree held in the house many years ago, but Geraldine remembers that a boy named Phillip Harrison, nicknamed [...] "Little Pip", said Andrew did [...] "terrible things", and that the police were involved. Carl says how Andrew paid Pip's family to move away, and Andrew counters by claiming he did nothing to Pip and was only teaching him how to wash himself. Carl implies that he and John were not as lucky as Pip, and John says he can smell carbolic soap. There is silence, and Stuart points out no <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> looking for them, but they realise Ian has not yet returned from the bathroom. Jeremy says Ian is the person he was going to pick up from the station, but when Mark claims Ian is already at the party, Jeremy reveals the person Mark is referring to is not Ian. Outside, [...] "Ian" [...] locks the wardrobe and sprays it with lighter fluid while singing the sardine song. Carl realises Ian is actually Phillip, and the episode ends with Phillip leaning against the wardrobe, a lighter in his hand.|$|E

2500|$|Emma (Em) is a {{woman who}} Isherwood meets in his hometown. The author may have been taking a chance with this character, who is, at least partially, African-American, while Isherwood is white; when the book was written, interracial marriages were heavily {{discouraged}} in American society. Isherwood does marry her, and race isn't important to the couple's relationship. Em becomes the community's mother, letting it grow as it will, but stepping in to help when no <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> filling the leadership role. She was the adult while others panicked, and Ish thought of her as the [...] "Mother of Nations".|$|E

[...] Before they officially started to date in 1997, they hung out together at a bar and Larry kept putting quarters in the jukebox, playing romantic songs by Roy Orbison and Patsy Cline. [...] This was when he was still drinking, and Bambi wrote that at one point he started crying, and said to her, “No <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> ever really going to know my soul". And Bambi thought to herself, “I will. I could do that.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Christian {{denominations}} {{differ in}} their understanding of whether they may receive the Eucharist with those with whom {{they are not in}} full communion. The famed apologist St. Justin Martyr (c. 150) wrote: [...] "No <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> permitted to partake of it, except one who believes our teaching to be true...." [...] For the first several hundred years, non-members were forbidden even to be present at the sacramental ritual; visitors and catechumens (those still undergoing instruction) were dismissed halfway through the Liturgy, after the Bible readings and sermon but before the Eucharistic rite. This ancient custom is still evident in the extraordinary form of the Roman Rite, where the Mass is divided into two parts; the Mass of the Catechumens, and the Mass of the Faithful. The Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom, used in the Byzantine Rite, still has a formula of dismissal of catechumens (not usually followed by any action) at this point.|$|E

He finds he is trapped in a time loop that no <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> seemingly aware of. Phil realizes there are no consequences for his actions, and spends the first several loops in rambunctious behavior, such as binge drinking, one-night stands, and reckless driving. However, Phil soon becomes depressed being stuck in the loop, leading to him {{to find ways to}} commit suicide to end the loop, including electrocuting himself with a toaster in a bathtub, and stealing Punxsutawney Phil and driving off a cliff. Even with his apparent deaths, he still wakes up to [...] "I Got You Babe" [...] on February 2.|$|E
