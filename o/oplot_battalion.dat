5000|$|Government forces {{attempted}} to enter Ilovaisk {{during the day}} on 18 August, but failed. Led by the Donbas Battalion, government forces launched another attempt to storm {{the city on the}} night of 18-19 August. This attempt was successful, and they raised the Ukrainian flag over the city administration building without any casualties. Ukrainian media viewed this victory {{as an example of the}} strength and effectiveness of the government [...] "Anti-Terrorist Operation" [...] (ATO) against the insurgents. As government forces entered the city, Donbas Battalion commander Semen Semenchenko was wounded after being struck by mortar fire and was evacuated for medical treatment. Following the flag-raising, the Internal Affairs ministry said that Ukrainian military, including the Donbas, Dnipro and Azov, were clearing the city of [...] "terrorists", specifically mentioning that they killed [...] "a great number" [...] of insurgents from the <b>Oplot</b> <b>Battalion</b> of the Donbass People's Militia. They also said that reinforcements from the National Guard of Ukraine were forthcoming. After a day of fighting, roughly fifty percent of Ilovaisk was under government control. Governments forces also captured six insurgents, including one Serbian volunteer. Azov and Shakhtarsk battalions left the battle of Ilovaisk that day, heading to reinforce garrisons of Mariupol and Komsomolske cities accordingly.|$|E
50|$|The {{assassination}} of Arsen Pavlov follows {{a string of}} high-profile deaths within the ranks of Ukraine's separatists, starting with the {{assassination of}} Alexander Bednov, {{the leader of the}} Batman Battalion and Aleksey Mozgovoy, the leader of the Prizrak Brigade in May 2015. Indeed, the death of Arsen Pavlov comes within a month of the death of Yevgeny Zhilin, the founder of <b>Oplot</b> <b>Battalion,</b> which would later form into the Oplot Brigade. Ukrainian officials have stated that Arsen Pavlov was assassinated by Russia's special forces as part of a drive to purge early separatist leaders that took part in the original insurgency of 2014, who may be charismatic but are often unpredictable. Moreover, most of the separatist leaders assassinated headed their own units, which would often engage in infighting over territory or control of the black market, suspecting that the assassinations are part of a drive to form a more uniform chain of command. Another theory behind the assassination has been that there is a drive {{to get rid of the}} first generation of rebels who were implicated in war crimes, therefore giving the separatist forces a more acceptable public face. Indeed, Amnesty International has called for an investigation into Arsen Pavlov executing 15 unarmed Ukrainian prisoners. Moreover, Arsen Pavlov's alleged war crimes have been one of the sticking points of the implementations of the Minsk II agreement, with Ukrainian authorities stating that he would not be granted amnesty. Furthermore, Arsen Pavlov was not a Ukrainian citizen, being born and raised in Russia, and serving in the Russian military during the Chechen conflict. Thus, his involvement as the leader of a Ukrainian separatist movement was pointed to as an example of Russian interference in the conflict, the assassination may have been a ploy to replace Russian born separatist leaders with Ukrainian born ones, making the War in Donbass look more like an internal affair. Ukrainian military spokesman Andriy Lysenko suggested the assassination could be used as cover for Russian separatists to carry out terrorist attacks within Ukraine. Russia's involvement in his death has not been proven.|$|E
