Inhibition of PD-L1 by atezolizumab can remove this inhibitor effect and thereby engender an anti-tumor response.

They asked him to attack United States President Bill Clinton, who was due to arrive in the Philippines on November 12, 1994 {{as part of a}} five-day tour of Asia. Yousef thought <b>of</b> <b>several</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> kill the president, {{including}} placing nuclear bombs on Clinton's motorcade route, firing a Stinger missile at Air Force One or the presidential limousine, launching theater ballistic missiles at Manila and or killing him with phosgene, a chemical weapon.

He writes that one <b>of</b> <b>several</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> look at right-libertarianism is its exclusive interest in economic freedoms, preference for a conservative lifestyle, view that big business is [...] "a great victim of the state," [...] favoring a strong national defense, and sharing the Old Right's [...] "opposition to empire." [...] However, he holds that the important distinction for libertarians is not left or right, but whether they are [...] "government apologists who use libertarian rhetoric to defend state aggression." ...|$|E
50|$|Data is {{distributed}} across the drives in one <b>of</b> <b>several</b> <b>ways,</b> referred <b>to</b> as RAID levels, {{depending on the}} required level of redundancy and performance. The different schemes, or data distribution layouts, are named by the word RAID followed by a number, for example RAID 0 or RAID 1. Each schema, or RAID level, provides a different balance among the key goals: reliability, availability, performance, and capacity. RAID levels greater than RAID 0 provide protection against unrecoverable sector read errors, as well as against failures of whole physical drives.|$|R

They use two shortcuts—emotions and beliefs to understand problems and “rational” ways of establishing {{the best evidence}} on solutions—to act quickly in complex, multilevel policy-making environments. Many studies only address one part of this problem. Improving the supply of evidence helps reduce scientific and policy maker uncertainty. However, policy makers also combine their beliefs with limited evidence to reduce ambiguity by choosing one <b>of</b> <b>several</b> possible <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> understand and solve a problem. We use this insight to consider solutions designed to “close the evidence–policy gap. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{survival}} function is one <b>of</b> <b>several</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> describe and display survival data. Another useful way to display data is a graph showing {{the distribution of}} survival times of subjects. Olkin, page 426, gives the following example of survival data. The number of hours between successive failures of an air-conditioning system were recorded. The time between successive failures are 1, 3, 5, 7, 11, 11, 11, 12, 14, 14, 14, 16, 16, 20, 21, 23, 42, 47, 52, 62, 71, 71, 87, 90, 95, 120, 120, 225, 246, and 261 hours. The {{mean time between failures}} is 59.6. This mean value will be used shortly to fit a theoretical curve to the data. The figure below shows the distribution of the time between failures. The blue tick marks beneath the graph are the actual hours between successive failures.|$|E
50|$|Single-tension is one <b>of</b> <b>several</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> {{apply the}} {{necessary}} tension to drum heads. Single-tension systems largely replaced the ancient rope-tension methods {{in the late}} 19th Century and are still used today in lower-priced drums for student use.In this system, one long tension rod with a threaded end extends through the hoop holding the top drum head and then down outside the drum shell to a threaded hole in the bottom hoop. There usually is a small guide halfway down on single-tension drum shells to keep the tension rods straight.In older drums, the hoops are often held tight by separate clamps through which the threaded tension rod fits.Tension is applied by turning a special key that fits into a hexagonal drive, but many bass drums (especially those models designed for concert use) have permanent wing-nuts permanently affixed to each tension rod, even on double-tension drums.|$|E
50|$|Top {{talent is}} usually quite rare, so {{companies}} often negotiate deals {{in order to}} hold on to key employees. Golden handcuffs constitute one <b>of</b> <b>several</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> stop companies' key employees leaving, making it essentially financially unprofitable for them to walk away from their employers. Such deals are usually done with stock options, phantom stock or deferred payments. Phantom stock usually gives the best results, as it gives an employee of a company using the technique a motive for staying with the company and making it grow, since the stock increases in value alongside the company. To create a contract that benefits both the employee and the company, a legal team should be contacted in order to discuss available options, and key employees should be distinguished from others. A funding mechanism should be put in place by the company (if privately held), where obligations are present. Tax repercussions should be minimised for the money set aside, usually using insurance as main funding mechanism. If designed perfectly, the corporation can manage to receive all its money back after paying the employee.|$|E

We argue for one <b>of</b> <b>several</b> alternative <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> model this situation. We then apply that modeling choice to recent models of the foundations of incomplete contracts and show that a buyer option contract is sufficient to induce first-best outcomes...|$|R

During the course of the game the player relocates to a larger, tropical island, the extinct volcano at the centre of which is used as the foundation for a rocket silo. The lair comprises various rooms, each of which contains objects for use by minions, either for the replenishment of certain [...] "stats" [...] (e.g. objects in the Mess Hall restore endurance) or to provide a function (e.g. the Power Plant room contains objects that generate power and allow the lair to function). Corridors connect the rooms within the lair and can also contain traps, which serve as one <b>of</b> <b>several</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> deter agents of justice and their attempts to enter the base and gather evidence, steal money, or sabotage equipment. Trap results vary from simple confusion and movement impairment to stat reduction and death, and catching agents within a combination of traps will reward the player with money. New objects can eventually be unlocked through the Laboratory via combining already-existing items with pieces of equipment.|$|E
