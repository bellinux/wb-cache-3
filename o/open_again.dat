5|$|This {{left the}} Australian {{captaincy}} <b>open</b> <b>again.</b> Harvey started the season strongly and scored 326 runs {{in his first}} three innings. This included 160 against Queensland and 149 for his new state against the touring England team of Peter May. In this match, Benaud had captained New South Wales and the hosts had the better of the play. They took a 214-run first innings lead and May's men when 6/356 when time ran out.|$|E
5|$|On August 11, 1658 Charles X and {{his forces}} reached Valby hill (current day Frederiksberg) {{from where they}} could {{overlook}} the Danish capital. His arrival was expected and the Danish king Frederick III had already ordered every building outside the city walls burnt, {{even though it had}} housed a third {{of the population of the}} city. That same day the city gates were closed and would not <b>open</b> <b>again</b> for another 22 months. A Swedish fleet of 28 ships blocked the harbor, preventing resupply by sea. The siege had begun.|$|E
5|$|The {{case against}} Martin falters as {{evidence}} disappears and witnesses fail to identify {{him in a}} line-up. Black is approached by Pepper, Martin's self-appointed lawyer, who extends Black an invitation to join his legal practice. Martin later claims in court to have killed Bletcher. Elsewhere, another Millennium Group member, Mike Atkins (Robin Gammell), receives {{a telephone call from}} someone pretending to be Black. Meanwhile, Black suspects that the occult-oriented murder may have been committed to draw the Group, and Black, into the <b>open</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 2014, {{district}} court judge Ricardo Rodriguez campaigned to unseat Guerra as district attorney, and the Garza case arose as a campaign issue. Rodriguez said that he wanted justice for the Garza family. He {{said that he would}} take a new look at Garza's case if he were elected. Rodriguez won the election. In the days after the vote was announced, Guerra sought to appoint Rodriguez as a special prosecutor in the Garza case. Rodriguez declined, saying that he preferred to take a new look at the evidence once he took control of the district attorney's office in January 2015. In April, he announced that the Garza case was <b>open</b> <b>again.</b> Without mentioning any suspects or elaborating on new evidence, he said that several employees in his office were working on the case.|$|E
5|$|Outside {{the lecture}} room before the {{students}} arrived, according to testimony Starling and others gave in court, Starling cut the dog <b>open</b> <b>again</b> {{to inspect the}} results of the previous surgery, which took about 45 minutes, after which he clamped the wound with forceps and handed the dog over to Bayliss. Bayliss cut a new opening in the dog's neck to expose the lingual nerves of the salivary glands, to which he attached electrodes. The aim was to stimulate the nerves with electricity to demonstrate that salivary pressure was independent of blood pressure. The dog was then carried to the lecture theatre, stretched on his back on an operating board, with his legs tied to the board, his head clamped and his mouth muzzled.|$|E
5|$|The {{manner in}} which the puffball splits open (dehisces) has been {{described}} by 19th-century American mycologist William Henry Long. The thick and leathery peridium of the mature puffball remains unopened for several months without splitting. After several alternating cycles of wetting and drying, fissures develop across the top. These fissures usually radiate from a common center {{near the top of the}} fruit body and finally produce very irregular star-like teeth. In time, the entire upper half of the puffball is open and exposed during dry weather. In this condition, the spores are blown out by the wind and widely distributed. During every rainy spell the puffball promptly closes only to <b>open</b> <b>again</b> when dry weather returns. At each alternate opening and closing the peridium is split more and more, until finally it is expanded into a flat shape, or even curls backward. In the puffball, the outer layer of the peridium comprises cells arranged so that when wet they adsorb water and expand, thus closing the top of the puffball. Upon drying, these outer cells lose water and gradually shrink, thus producing an unequal tension between the outer and inner cells of the peridium. This tension causes the irregular star-like pieces of the peridium to gradually separate and curve outward, thus opening the top of the puffball during dry weather.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of anti-Chinese violence in previous riots also involved only Indonesians looting Chinese shops and property without killing the Chinese themselves. Most Indonesians {{did not want}} to drive out Chinese or murder them, but they falsely believed that Chinese have an infinite supply of products so when they looted and stole from Chinese shops, they thought that the shops would be <b>open</b> <b>again</b> in the future.|$|E
25|$|Stomata {{are obvious}} {{holes in the}} leaf by which, as was presumed for a while, {{pathogens}} can enter unchallenged. However, it has been recently shown that stomata do in fact sense the presence of some, if not all, pathogens. However, with the virulent bacteria applied to Arabidopsis plant leaves in the experiment, the bacteria released the chemical coronatine, which forced the stomata <b>open</b> <b>again</b> within a few hours.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1860s, the {{finances}} of the Catholic University School and University were intertwined, and the rent for the Harcourt Street premises {{was a high}} £2600 per annum. Neither the school nor the University were {{able to cope with}} this burden. Archbishop of Dublin, Paul Cullen was adamant that it was not possible for C.U.S to close down even for a year – because it would be possible that the school would never <b>open</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
25|$|Botanically, {{the fruit}} {{produced}} is a berry. The berries develop {{later in the}} season; berry development time varies from species to species from {{a few weeks to}} a year, although most philodendrons take a few months. The spathe will enlarge to hold the maturing berries. Once the fruit are mature, the spathe will begin to <b>open</b> <b>again,</b> but this time it will break off at the base and fall to the forest floor. Additionally, the berries are edible, although they contain calcium oxalate crystals, and have a taste akin to bananas.|$|E
25|$|Coombe Farm {{is a large}} {{farmhouse}} off Oaks Road, reached via Oaks Lane. Oaks Lane was {{the former}} main road, closed by John Maberly of Shirley House in 1803 to increase his privacy. Oaks Road was its replacement and Oaks Lane is now <b>open</b> <b>again</b> to walkers. The building probably dates from the 16th century, with 19th-century additions. In 1893, another brother of Frank Lloyd, Herbert, built a much larger new building with mock-Tudor features beside the original building. The farm is now the centre of Dr. Anwar Ansari's housing services and property development company AA Homes & Housing Limited. There are also old farmhouses and lodges along Oaks Lane.|$|E

25|$|In 1657 Pepys {{decided to}} undergo surgery, {{not an easy}} option, as the {{operation}} {{was known to be}} especially painful and hazardous. Nevertheless, Pepys consulted surgeon Thomas Hollier and, on 26 March 1658, the operation took place in a bedroom in the house of Pepys' cousin Jane Turner. Pepys' stone was successfully removed and he resolved to hold a celebration on every anniversary of the operation, which he did for several years. However, there were long-term effects from the operation. The incision on his bladder broke <b>open</b> <b>again</b> late in his life. The procedure may have left him sterile, though there is no direct evidence for this, as he was childless before the operation.|$|E
25|$|Annie Wheaton has {{discovered}} a dollhouse {{that is a}} miniature replica of Rose Red. While standing on a chair {{in an attempt to}} reach the dollhouse, she falls and is knocked unconscious. Rachel Wheaton and Steve Rimbauer see her fall and attempt to render first aid. Meanwhile, {{on the other side of}} the house, Rose Red's windows and doors mysteriously <b>open</b> <b>again.</b> Emery Waterman, realizing that his mother's screams were not an illusion, rushes outside to look for his mother. He runs into Dr. Miller, who warns him to stay away and then flees. Emery chases Miller but cannot catch him, so he returns to Rose Red. Miller, continuing to frantically run around the grounds of the house, is found and attacked by the ghost of Kevin Bollinger.|$|E
25|$|Raised in Wohlen, Aargau, Hug was a keen footballer in {{his youth}} but gave up the sport to pursue Kyokushin karate which he began {{practicing}} at ten years old. Beginning his full contact karate career in the 80 kg/176 lb middleweight division, he rose to prominence in the late 1970s and early 1980s by winning numerous regional tournaments around Europe and made the transition to heavyweight in 1984. That same year, he competed in the Kyokushin World Open, knockdown karate's most prestigious competition, {{for the first time}} and made it to the fourth round where he was eliminated by Shokei Matsui. Returning to Europe, he won his first major title in the form of the 3rd European Championships in 1985 before entering World <b>Open</b> <b>again</b> in 1987. He became the first non-Japanese fighter to make it to the final of the competition but again lost to Shokei Matsui. Another European Championships win would follow in 1989 and he fought in his third and final World Open in 1991, losing a controversial bout to Francisco Filho in the third round.|$|E
