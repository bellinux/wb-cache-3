Richard was granted free agency by the Astros on November 7, 1983, but the Astros still had faith in him, so he was re-signed on February 17 of the following year. Just {{a little over two}} months later, he was released by the Astros, thus ending his baseball career. Despite an almost complete recovery, the risk of future complications was so great that he never pitched again. His final major league record was 107–71, with 1,493strikeouts and a 3.15ERA in 238games and 1,606innings. Nolan Ryan broke his Astros record for career strikeouts in 1987.|$|E

5|$|Low {{back pain}} results in large {{economic}} costs. In the United States, {{it is the}} most common type <b>of</b> <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> adults, responsible for a large number of missed work days, and is the most common musculoskeletal complaint seen in the emergency department. In 1998, it was estimated to be responsible for $90 billion in annual health care costs, with 5% of individuals incurring most (75%) of the costs. Between 1990 and 2001 there was a more than twofold increase in spinal fusion surgeries in the US, despite {{the fact that there were}} no changes to the indications for surgery or new evidence of greater usefulness. Further costs occur in the form of lost income and productivity, with low back pain responsible for 40% of all missed work days in the United States. Low back pain causes disability in a larger percentage of the workforce in Canada, Great Britain, the Netherlands and Sweden than in the US or Germany.|$|E

5|$|Pain: {{acute pain}} is mainly due to optic {{neuritis}} (with corticosteroids {{being the best}} treatment available), as well as trigeminal neuralgia, Lhermitte's sign, or dysesthesias. Subacute pain is usually secondary to the disease and can be a consequence of spending too long in the same position, urinary retention, and infected skin ulcers, amongst others. Treatment will depend on cause. Chronic pain is very common and harder to treat as its most common cause is dysesthesias. Acute pain due to trigeminal neuralgia is usually successfully treated with anticonvulsants such as carbamazepine or phenytoin. Both Lhermitte's sign and painful dysesthesias usually respond to treatment with carbamazepine, clonazepam, or amitriptyline. Sativex is approved for treatment <b>of</b> <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> MS in different countries, but due to its derivation from cannabis, it is currently not available in others, such as the USA. This medication is also being investigated {{for the management of}} other MS symptoms, such as spasticity, and has shown long-term safety and efficacy.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Pregnancy-related {{pelvic pain}} {{is a common}} condition, and use of {{hormonal}} contraceptives before pregnancy has been proposed as a risk factor. We used data from a sub-sample of women participating in the "Norwegian Women and Cancer study" (NOWAC) to assess the association between hormonal contraceptive use and pelvic <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> pregnancy. Methods From a sub-group of 2078 parous women participating in the NOWAC study, information was collected from a self-instructive four-page questionnaire containing questions about lifestyle and medical conditions. We calculated odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI), using unconditional logistic regression. Results In this study, the prevalence <b>of</b> pelvic <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> women was 26. 5 % during the first pregnancy and increased with parity. Use of hormonal contraceptives before a woman's first pregnancy was {{associated with an increased}} risk <b>of</b> pelvic <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> her first pregnancy (OR = 1. 6; 95 % confidence interval 1. 2 – 2. 2). There was no association between use of hormonal contraceptives and pelvic <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> the second or third pregnancy. Occurrence <b>of</b> pelvic <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> a previous pregnancy was the only factor associated with pelvic <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> subsequent pregnancies (OR = 51. 1; 95 % CI 32. 9 – 79. 5 in the second pregnancy and OR = 28. 3; 95 % CI 15. 4 – 53. 1 in the third pregnancy). Conclusion Use of hormonal contraceptives was associated with an increased risk <b>of</b> pelvic <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> a woman's first pregnancy. The most important determinant <b>of</b> pelvic <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> the second or third pregnancy was the history <b>of</b> pelvic <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> the preceding pregnancy. </p...|$|R
