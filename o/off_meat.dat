The shape of the teeth would have made Lythronax an efficient hunter; {{it would have been}} able to carve out huge chunks of flesh and bone and swallow whole.|$|E

60|$|And, {{notwithstanding}} the {{keen sense of}} her own bruises, she was capable of some compunction when her uncle and aunt received her with a more affectionate kindness than they had ever shown before. She could not but be struck by the dignified cheerfulness with which they talked of the necessary economies in their way of living, and {{in the education of}} the boys. Mr. Gascoigne's worth of character, a little obscured by worldly opportunities--as the poetic beauty of women is obscured by the demands of fashionable dressing--showed itself to great advantage under this sudden reduction of fortune. Prompt and methodical, he had set himself not only to put down his carriage, but to reconsider his worn suits of clothes, to leave <b>off</b> <b>meat</b> for breakfast, to do without periodicals, to get Edwy from school and arrange hours of study for all the boys under himself, and to order the whole establishment on the sparest footing possible. For all healthy people economy has its pleasures; and the rector's spirit had spread through the household. Mrs. Gascoigne and Anna, who always made papa their model, really did not miss anything they cared about for themselves, and in all sincerity felt that the saddest part of the family losses was the change for Mrs. Davilow and her children.|$|E

50|$|Some meat on {{the bone}} is most {{commonly}} eaten by picking it up, notably ribs and chicken (wings, drumstick, sometimes thigh). Others are primarily eaten by cutting <b>off</b> the <b>meat,</b> such as steaks, but possibly picking up and gnawing the bone when otherwise finished.|$|R

5000|$|Joy {{received}} her M.Ed. from the Harvard Graduate School of Education, and her Ph.D. in psychology from the Saybrook Graduate School. At age 23, while {{a student at}} Harvard, she contracted a food-borne disease from a tainted hamburger and was hospitalized, which led her to become a vegetarian. In a speech related by Indian cabinet minister Maneka Gandhi, Joy recalled how her dietary choice, made for non-moral reasons, transformed her perspective on the treatment of animals:That experience led me to swear <b>off</b> <b>meat,</b> which led me to become more open to information about animal agriculture—information that had been all around me but that I had been unwilling to see, so long as I was still invested in maintaining my current way of life. And as I learned the truth about meat, egg and dairy production, I became increasingly distraught. ... I wound up confused and despairing. I felt like a rudderless boat, lost on a sea of collective insanity. Nothing had changed, but everything was different.Afterwards, Joy made a gradual transition to veganism.|$|E

He described meeting Mountain while doing milk sanitation in Puerto Rico as well as difficulties in controlling psittacosis, cleaning salmonella <b>off</b> <b>meat</b> carcasses, cutting into a bat brain while tracing wild rabies, and reporting on foot-and-mouth in Mexico. He told fun stories of how the Pan American sanitary bureau survey in the Dominican Republic lead him to trouble with Trujillo's racehorses, where, after he gave advice, he was expected to stay and heal the horse.

40|$|Introduction and Methods: Trimming fat <b>off</b> <b>meat</b> is {{recommended}} for reducing intake of saturated fat. This paper reviews trends over the past 20 years that have influenced the red meat supply in response to consumer and health professional demands for lean meat, drawing on published survey data, marketing information, analyses of meat content and qualitative research commissioned by Meat and Livestock Australia. Results and Discussion: Separable fat is the greatest determinant of the saturated fat in Australian red meat, {{and changes in the}} processing and butchering practices have combined to produce red meat today with significantly lower separable fat. Nutrient analyses in 2002 showed the separable fat on raw retail samples was up to 38 % less than in comparable cuts in 1983. Further trimming by consumers prior to consumption is also increasing and in 2007 89 % of consumers reported buying meat trimmed or removing some or all fat prior to consumption. The 1995 national nutrition survey showed red meat contributed less than 10 % of dietary saturated fat intake in Australia, and continues to make an important contribution to intake of iron, zinc, omega 3 and vitamin B 12 intakes, as well as encouraging consumption of vegetables. Conclusions: Dietary messages and strategies for reducing saturated fat intake have increased fat trimming practices by retailers as well as consumers. Consequently, trimmed red meat is not a major source of saturated fat in the Australian diet. Dietary advice and analyses should ensure data reflects red meat as consumed rather than as purchased to avoid overestimating total and saturated fat intake...|$|E
