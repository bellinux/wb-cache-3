25|$|Some archaeologists {{believe that}} ancients made shrouds of asbestos, wherein they burned {{the bodies of}} their kings, in order to {{preserve}} only their ashes, and prevent them being mixed with those of wood or other combustible materials commonly used in funeral pyres. Others assert that the ancients used asbestos to make perpetual wicks for sepulchral or <b>other</b> <b>lamps.</b> A famous example is the golden lamp asbestos lychnis, which the sculptor Callimachus made for the Erechtheion. In more recent centuries, asbestos was indeed used for this purpose. Although asbestos causes skin to itch upon contact, ancient literature indicates that it was prescribed for diseases of the skin, and particularly for the itch. It is possible that they used the term asbestos for soapstone, because the two terms have often been confused throughout history.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the morning}} of March 31, 1901, while off Cavite in Manila Bay, a fire started aboard the Petrel {{originating}} in the sail room. The sail room was a small compartment {{in the bottom of}} the ship, adjacent to the magazine and was accessible only by a hatchway from the berth deck above. Several members of the ship's crew, led by the ship's captain, Lieutenant Commander Jesse M. Roper took turns entering the compartment and fighting the blaze. The fire produced no visible flames but thick, acrid smoke and fumes filled the area. The sail room was also pitch black; the ship's electric generator had been turned off at dawn, and no <b>other</b> <b>lamps</b> would work in the harsh atmosphere of the compartment. A number of men, including Roper, were overcome by the bad air and were pulled out of the sail room semi-conscious. As the fumes grew thicker and more noxious, Roper ordered everyone out of the compartment, but one sailor, Seaman Patrick Toner, did not emerge from the room. When a sound was heard from below, believed to be Toner fighting for breath, four men descended to rescue him, including Roper (not fully recovered from his first trip below). When the four men did not return, Seaman Alphonse Girandy tied a rope around his waist and climbed down the ladder, finding Kessler and Flaherty, both semi-conscious, and passing them up to be hauled through the hatchway. He found Toner at the bottom of the ladder and, although losing consciousness himself, held on to him as the sailors above pulled both men out of the compartment. Lieutenant J.S. McKean, with a rope around his waist, was next into the sail room, followed by Private Louis F. Thies (Pfiefer) and Seaman Thomas Cahey. As McKean searched in the darkness for the two men still missing, Lieutenant Commander Roper and Cadet Lewis, the ship's generator finally came back online. With the help of a lamp lowered through the hatchway, McKean could see Roper and Lewis slumped against the walls of the compartment. McKean dragged Roper to the ladder to be hauled out and then, with the help of Theis and Cahey, rescued Lewis, just before losing consciousness himself. The fire was extinguished later that day; Roper was killed by the fumes, but the other men all eventually recovered. For their actions during the incident, Cahey, Girandy, and Thies were each awarded the Medal of Honor. Pfeifer received his medal on March 22, 1902, while still going by the name of Louis Fred Theis.

Here and there a flight of broad stone cellar-steps appears, and a painted lamp directs you to the Bowling Saloon, or Ten-Pin alley; Ten-Pins being a game of mingled chance and skill, invented when the legislature passed an act forbidding Nine-Pins. At other downward flights of steps, are <b>other</b> <b>lamps,</b> marking the whereabouts of oyster-cellars - pleasant retreats, say I: not only by reason of their wonderful cookery of oysters, pretty nigh as large as cheese-plates (or for thy dear sake, heartiest of Greek Professors!), but because {{of all kinds of}} caters of fish, or flesh, or fowl, in these latitudes, the swallowers of oysters alone are not gregarious; but subduing themselves, as it were, to the nature of what they work in, and copying the coyness of the thing they eat, do sit apart in curtained boxes, and consort by twos, not by two hundreds.|$|E
50|$|Like {{fluorescent}} lamps, HID lamps {{require a}} ballast {{to start and}} maintain their arcs.

5000|$|HID-lamps finally can be {{used for}} {{lighting}} operations where regular LED-lighting or <b>other</b> <b>lamps</b> will not suffice. Examples are car headlights.

60|$|All {{this set}} him thinking, and it {{occurred}} to him that he had not investigated the lair of the rat or looked at the pictures, as he had intended. He lit the <b>other</b> <b>lamp</b> without the shade, and, holding it up went and stood opposite the third picture from the fireplace on the right-hand side where he had seen the rat disappear on the previous night.|$|R
50|$|CDM lamps use one {{fifth of}} the power of {{comparable}} tungsten incandescent light bulbs for the same light output (80-117 lm/W) and retain color stability better than most <b>other</b> gas discharge <b>lamps.</b> Like <b>other</b> high-intensity discharge <b>lamps,</b> they require a correctly rated electrical ballast in order to operate.|$|R
25|$|A {{disadvantage}} of the inductor is that current is shifted {{out of phase}} with the voltage, producing a poor power factor. In more expensive ballasts, a capacitor is often paired with the inductor to correct the power factor. In ballasts that control two or more lamps, line-frequency ballasts commonly use different phase relationships between the multiple lamps. This not only mitigates the flicker of the individual lamps, it also helps maintain a high power factor. These ballasts are often called lead-lag ballasts because the current in one lamp leads the mains phase and the current in the <b>other</b> <b>lamp</b> lags the mains phase.|$|R
50|$|A {{hand-held}} {{oil lamp}} or incense sticks (lit from the lamp) {{are also used}} during the Hindu puja ceremony. In the North of India, a five-wick lamp is used, usually fueled with ghee.

50|$|The Argand lamp, {{a kind of}} oil lamp, {{was invented}} and {{patented}} in 1780 by Aimé Argand. Its output is 6 to 10 candela, brighter than that of earlier lamps.

50|$|MR lamps offer several {{advantages}} over <b>other</b> <b>lamps</b> with equivalent power ratings. They are typically smaller (transformers excepted), provide better beam control {{and offer a}} whiter light than ordinary incandescent lamps. The small size of the lamp allows designers more flexibility in placing the lamps and with the option of various beam widths, the light beam can be very specifically placed.|$|E
50|$|Several {{innovations}} {{during this}} time, {{such as the}} development of tungsten filaments, allowed brighter and longer-lasting bulbs, with production steadily increasing throughout the ensuing years.

50|$|Security {{lighting}} may {{be subject}} to vandalism, possibly to reduce its effectiveness for a subsequent intrusion attempt. Thus security lights should either be mounted very high, or else protected by wire mesh or tough polycarbonate shields. <b>Other</b> <b>lamps</b> may be completely recessed from view and access, with the light directed out through a light pipe or reflected from a polished aluminium or stainless steel mirror. For similar reasons high security installations may provide a stand-by power supply for their security lighting.|$|E
