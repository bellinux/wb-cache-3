5|$|This {{is a list}} of {{the sixteen}} {{counties}} in the U.S. state of Maine. Before statehood, Maine was officially part of the state of Massachusetts and was called the District of Maine. Maine was granted statehood on March 15, 1820 as part of the Missouri Compromise. Nine of the sixteen counties had their borders defined while Maine was still part of Massachusetts, and hence are older than the state itself. Even after 1820, the exact location of the northern border of Maine was disputed with Britain, until the question was settled and the northern counties signed their final <b>official</b> <b>form,</b> the Webster-Ashburton Treaty, signed in 1842. Almost all of Aroostook County was disputed land until the treaty was signed.|$|E

His armies also destroyed several important Sunni sites, including the tombs of Abū Ḥanīfa and Abdul-Qadir Gilani. The Safavids even expelled the family of Gilani from Mesopotamia.

These draconian actions by the conquering Safavids caused the Mesopotamian Sunnis to seethe with resentment.|$|E

These responsa of the later geonim were often essays on Talmudic themes, and since a single letter often answered many questions, it frequently became book-length in size.

25|$|However, {{the belief}} that John was taught at both the Carmelite College of San Andrès and at the University of Salamanca has been criticised. He argues, firstly, that {{it is unclear whether}} there were in fact lectures in arts and {{theology}} at the College of San Andrès before 1571, that a reconstruction of the typical timetable of teaching at the University of Salamanca shows that there would have been little time for extra teaching at the College of the San Andrès, and that what therefore happened at San Andrès (if indeed it happened at all) is therefore likely to have taken the form of rehearsals, preparation of classes, and not in an <b>official</b> <b>form</b> — making the idea that John received systematic exposure to Baconthorpe less likely. More controversially, Bezares calls into question whether John even studied theology at the University of Salamanca. The philosophy courses John probably took in logic, natural and moral philosophy, can be reconstructed, but Bezares argues that John in fact abandoned his studies at Salamanca in 1568 to join Teresa, rather than having graduated, meaning that he did not study theology in Salamanca.|$|E
500|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) is {{assigned}} {{six hours of}} counseling with Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) after he physically reprimanded his nephew Luke (Evan Peters) in [...] "Nepotism", but Michael refuses to speak to Toby. One hour into their session, Toby tells Michael {{that he will not}} fill in the official assessment form unless Michael talks to him, so Michael begins telling ridiculous stories. Toby then tries the common counseling method of playing games with the client to get them to open up more. The method works, and Michael opens up to Toby about his personal history and relationships with people (he mentions seeing a baseball game with his stepfather where he was told that the team's manager deserved respect and how he never forgot that), and Toby makes an important discovery that Michael needs to be liked. Michael realizes what is happening, gets angry at Toby, and denigrates his counseling ability. Toby gives up and gives Michael the <b>official</b> <b>form,</b> allowing him to fill it out however he wants. In his haste, Michael accidentally checks off on the form that he is severely depressed and homicidal. Gabe contacts Toby, confused by his extreme assessment of Michael. Although Michael initially blames Toby for the mishap, he turns his ire to Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods), even making Toby laugh. Michael openly offers to return to the break room with Toby and [...] "bang this out". At the end of the episode, they are both talking and drawing pictures.|$|E
