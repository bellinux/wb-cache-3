5|$|In the home, {{accidents}} {{occur when}} hypochlorite bleach solutions {{come into contact}} with certain acidic drain-cleaners to produce chlorine gas.

5|$|Marine {{molluscs}} such as sea hares, cuttlefish, squid and octopuses {{give themselves}} a {{last chance to}} escape by distracting their attackers. To do this, they eject a mixture <b>of</b> <b>chemicals,</b> which may mimic food or otherwise confuse predators. In response to a predator, animals in these groups release ink, creating a cloud, and opaline, affecting the predator's feeding senses, causing it to attack the cloud.|$|E

5|$|A few species, the Caribbean fire sponge Tedania ignis, cause {{a severe}} rash in humans who handle them. Turtles and some fish feed mainly on sponges.

Predation by fish may even help to spread sponges by detaching fragments.|$|E
5|$|An {{analysis}} <b>of</b> <b>chemicals</b> {{present in}} the island's soil, together with resolutions passed by Guam's legislature, suggest that Agent Orange was among the herbicides routinely used on and around military bases Anderson Air Force Base, Naval Air Station Agana, Guam. Despite the evidence, the Department of Defense continues to deny that Agent Orange was ever stored or used on Guam. Several Guam veterans have collected {{an enormous amount of}} evidence to assist in their disability claims for direct exposure to dioxin containing herbicides such as 2,4,5-T which are similar to the illness associations and disability coverage that has become standard for those who were harmed by the same chemical contaminant of Agent Orange used in Vietnam.|$|E

However, {{when he went to}} photograph the Panataran Hindu temple complex in East Java in 1867, he ran out <b>of</b> <b>chemicals.</b> In his enthusiasm for photographing the many reliefs of the temple complex, he used up so many glass slides that he could not go to Borobudur as he had intended to. The Society was nervous about van Kinsbergen's delay, so they did not grant his request to supply new slides.|$|E

5|$|Friedrich Christian Accum or Frederick Accum (March 29, 1769 – June 28, 1838) was a German chemist, {{whose most}} {{important}} achievements included {{advances in the}} field of gas lighting, efforts to keep processed foods free from dangerous additives, and the promotion of interest in the science of chemistry to the general populace. From 1793 to 1821 Accum lived in London. Following an apprenticeship as an apothecary, he opened his own commercial laboratory enterprise. His business manufactured and sold a variety <b>of</b> <b>chemicals</b> and laboratory equipment. Accum, himself, gave fee-based public lectures in practical chemistry and collaborated with research efforts at numerous other institutes of science.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the general similarity in structure and function of the electron transport chains in eukaryotes, bacteria and archaea possess a large variety of electron-transfer enzymes. These use an equally wide set <b>of</b> <b>chemicals</b> as substrates. In common with eukaryotes, prokaryotic electron transport uses the energy released from the oxidation of a substrate to pump ions across a membrane and generate an electrochemical gradient. In the bacteria, oxidative phosphorylation in Escherichia coli is understood in most detail, while archaeal systems are at present poorly understood.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius repraesentaneus was {{reported}} to have antibiotic activity against Staphylococcus aureus in 1947. The substance responsible for the antibacterial activity, determined to be heat-sensitive, was not identified. A number <b>of</b> <b>chemicals</b> have been isolated and identified from L.repraesentaneus that can regulate the growth of plants. The chemicals, in a class called sesquiterpenoids are named repraesentin A, and two related sesquiterpenes, namely repraesentins B and C. These compounds were shown to promote the radicle elongation of lettuce seedlings by 136%, 118% and 184% at 67 ppm, respectively. Other compounds reported in 2006 are repraesentins D, E, and F. Repraesentin E showed the strongest growth promotion activity, 164% at 3.6µm, of the three compounds toward the radicle elongation of lettuce seedlings.|$|E

Batman arrives and, in a struggle, Napier is knocked into a vat <b>of</b> <b>chemicals.</b> Batman escapes and Napier is presumed dead.|$|E
5|$|Most millipedes are slow-moving detritivores, eating {{decaying}} {{leaves and}} other dead plant matter. Some eat fungi or suck plant fluids, {{and a small}} minority are predatory. Millipedes are generally harmless to humans, although some can become household or garden pests, especially in greenhouses where they can cause severe damage to emergent seedlings. Most millipedes defend themselves with a variety <b>of</b> <b>chemicals</b> secreted from pores along the body, although the tiny bristle millipedes are covered with tufts of detachable bristles. Reproduction in most species is carried out by modified male legs called gonopods, which transfer packets of sperm to females.|$|E
5|$|Physiologically, the {{function}} of the brain is to exert centralized control over the other organs of the body. The brain acts {{on the rest of the}} body both by generating patterns of muscle activity and by driving the secretion <b>of</b> <b>chemicals</b> called hormones. This centralized control allows rapid and coordinated responses to changes in the environment. Some basic types of responsiveness such as reflexes can be mediated by the spinal cord or peripheral ganglia, but sophisticated purposeful control of behavior based on complex sensory input requires the information integrating capabilities of a centralized brain.|$|E
50|$|In 2015, Bretislav Friedrich co-organized an {{international}} symposium {{to mark the}} centenary of the infamous chlorine cloud attack at Ypres in 1915.

The focus was on scientific, ethical, legal, and political issues <b>of</b> <b>chemical</b> weapons research and deployment — including the issue of dual use — {{as well as the}} ongoing effort to control the possession <b>of</b> <b>chemical</b> weapons and to ultimately achieve their elimination. A proceedings volume consisting of papers presented at the symposium and supplemented by additional articles covers key aspects <b>of</b> <b>chemical</b> warfare from 1915 until this day.|$|R
