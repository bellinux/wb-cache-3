5|$|In 2006, it was {{hypothesized}} that an isomer of 271Hs might have a half-life of around (2.5±0.5)×108y, which would explain the observation of alpha particles with energies of around 4.4MeV in some samples of molybdenite and <b>osmiridium.</b> This isomer of 271Hs could be produced from the beta decay of 271Bh and 271Sg, which, being homologous to rhenium and molybdenum respectively, should occur in molybdenite along with rhenium and molybdenum if they occurred in nature. Since hassium is homologous to osmium, it should also occur along with osmium in <b>osmiridium</b> if it occurred in nature. The decay chains of 271Bh and 271Sg are very hypothetical and the predicted half-life of this hypothetical hassium isomer is not long enough for any sufficient quantity to remain on Earth. It is possible that more 271Hs may be deposited on the Earth as the Solar System travels through the spiral arms of the Milky Way, which would also explain excesses of plutonium-239 found on the floors of the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of Finland, but minerals enriched with 271Hs are predicted to also have excesses of uranium-235 and lead-207, and would have different proportions of elements that are formed during spontaneous fission, such as krypton, zirconium, and xenon. Thus, the occurrence of hassium in nature in minerals such as molybdenite and osmiride is theoretically possible, but highly unlikely.|$|E

40|$|A {{variety of}} {{seemingly}} unrelated processes, such as core-mantle interaction, desulfurization, and direct precipitation from a silicate melt {{have been proposed}} to explain the formation of Ru-Os-Ir alloys (here referred to as <b>osmiridiums)</b> found in terrestrial mantle rocks. However, no consensus has yet been reached on how these important micrometer-sized phases form. In this paper we report {{the results of an}} experimental study on the solubilities of Ru, Os and Ir in sulfide melts (or mattes) as a function of alloy composition at 1300 °C. Considering the low solubilities of Ru, Os, and Ir in silicate melts, coupled with their high matte/silicate-melt partition coefficients, our results indicate that these elements concentrate initially at the ppm level in a matte phase in the mantle source region. During partial melting, the extraction of sulfur into silicate melt leads to a decrease in fS 2 that triggers the exsolution of <b>osmiridiums</b> from the refractory matte in the residue. The newly formed <b>osmiridiums</b> may persist in the terrestrial mantle for periods exceeding billions of years...|$|R
500|$|Because of the {{volatility}} and extreme toxicity of its oxide, osmium is rarely used in its pure state, but is instead often alloyed with other metals. Those alloys are utilized in high-wear applications.

50|$|The {{nomenclature}} of Os-Ir-Ru alloys were revised {{again by}} Harris and Cabri in 1991.

The gold group consists of gold, copper, lead, aluminium, mercury, and silver. The platinum group consists of platinum, iridium, osmium, palladium, rhodium, and ruthenium.

5000|$|Next an oceanic arc {{collided}} with eastern Australia. This resulted in deep oceanic crust being thrust in a sheet {{over the top}} of the Precambrian rocks.

The minerals include osmium, iridosmium, rutheniridosmium, <b>osmiridium,</b> ruthenosmiridium, iridium, rhodiridium, ferroplatinum, rhodoferroplatinum, sperrylite, laurite, one arsenide of osmium and iridium, one complex sulpharsenide of osmium, iridium and ruthenium, and a rhodium sulphide mineral.

40|$|In situ {{analysis}} of major elements, platinum-group elements and Os isotope composition data for 170 grains of Ru–Os–Ir alloys from podiform chromitites in the Luobusa and Dongqiao ophiolites, Tibet, provide new {{constraints on the}} sources of the alloy grains, the Os-isotope composition of the Neo-Tethyan oceanic upper mantle, and the timing of melt–rock reactions in the ultramafic peridotites of the host ophiolites. Most alloy grains are <b>osmiridium</b> and iridosmine. Based on elemental and isotopic compositions, two populations can be identified. Group I, found in both ophiolite bodies, has fractionated PGE patterns typical of alloys and homogeneous 187 Os/ 188 Os 0. 12645 ± 4 (2 s; n = 145). Group II alloys from the Dongqiao ophiolites show smooth PGE patterns and 187 Os/ 188 Os ranges from 0. 12003 to 0. 12194 (yielding Re-depletion ages ≥ 1. 1 Ga). Both the PGE patterns and the Os isotopic compositions of Group II resemble those of sulfides residual after melting. Group I alloys represent an early cumulate phase during the crystallization of magmas and are interpreted as derived from an asthenospheric melt. In contrast, Group II alloys are inferred to derive from the breakdown of residual sulfides from the mantle section of the ophiolite, which may represent relics of a sub-continental lithospheric mantle. The coexistence of the two groups of alloys in Dongqiao samples reflects interaction between asthenosphere-derived melts and old depleted lithospheric mantle and suggests that the chromitites originated through melt–rock reactions. The data on the Group I alloys support the hypothesis that the Re–Os evolution of the convective oceanic mantle resembles that of enstatite chondrites...|$|E
