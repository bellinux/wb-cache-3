50|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the IMP—and the {{supporting}} detailed schedules of the IMS—is their use by the U.S. Government and Contractor acquisition team as the day-to-day tools for the planning, executing, and tracking program technical, schedule, and cost status, including risk mitigation efforts. The IMP provides a better structure than either the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) or <b>Organizational</b> <b>Breakdown</b> <b>Structure</b> (OBS) for measuring actual integrated master schedule (IMS) progress.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to managing technical and schedule performance, large and complex projects require that cost performance be monitored and reviewed at regular intervals. To measure cost performance, planned value (or BCWS - Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled) and earned value (or BCWP - Budgeted Cost of Work Performed) {{must be in}} units of currency (the same units that actual costs are measured.) In large implementations, the planned value curve is commonly called a Performance Measurement Baseline (PMB) and may be arranged in control accounts, summary-level planning packages, planning packages and work packages. In large projects, establishing control accounts is the primary method of delegating responsibility and authority to {{various parts of the}} performing organization. Control accounts are cells of a responsibility assignment (RACI) matrix, which is the intersection of the project WBS and the <b>organizational</b> <b>breakdown</b> <b>structure</b> (OBS). Control accounts are assigned to Control Account Managers (CAMs). Large projects require more elaborate processes for controlling baseline revisions, more thorough integration with subcontractor EVM systems, and more elaborate management of procured materials.|$|E
40|$|The {{interest}} in Business process Management (BPM) has {{flourished in the}} last decade as the adverse business conditions forced corporations to improve efficiency and effectiveness in daily operations. Though BPM can deliver significant business value, in practice it revealed challenges that prevented businesses from successful adoption. The modelling process has four distinct phases which leads to a lengthy implementation and often renders the processes too constrained for real life situations. This paper proposes a bottom-up approach based on actual daily activities logged by underlying monitoring infrastructure. If a number of activities form a repeatable sequence, they can be declared as a business process. A process may be identified by a single activity of the same type and source and destination in the <b>Organizational</b> <b>Breakdown</b> <b>structure.</b> Different repetitions of the same process can be compared and variations recorded. If the same variation is detected multiple times, the process definition can easily self-modify to become the new standard...|$|E
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} the chronology, results, and {{lessons learned from}} the development of the SSFF-MIS. This system has been nearly two years in development and has yielded some valuable insights into specialized MIS development. General: In December of 1994, the Camber Corporation and Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) were contracted to design, develop, and implement a MIS for Marshall Space Flight Center's Space Station Furnace Facility Project. The system was to be accessible from both EBM-Compatible PC and Macintosh platforms. The system was required to contain data manually entered into the MIS as well as data imported from other MSFC sources. Electronic interfaces were established for each data source and retrieval was to be performed at prescribed time intervals. The SOW requirement that predominantly drove the development software selection was the dual-platform (IBM-PC and Macintosh) requirement. The requirement that the system would be maintained by Government personnel influenced the selection of Commercial Off-the-shelf software because of its inherent stability and readily available documentation and support. Microsoft FoxPro Professional 2. 6 for Windows and Macintosh was selected as the development tool. This is a software development tool that has been in use for many years. It is stable and powerful. Microsoft has since released the replacement for this product, Microsoft Visual FoxPro, but {{at the time of this}} development, it was only available on the Windows platform. The initial contract included included the requirement for capabilities relating to the Work- and <b>Organizational</b> <b>Breakdown</b> <b>Structures,</b> cost (plan and actuals), workforce (plan and actuals), critical path scheduling, trend analysis, procurements and contracts, interface to manufacturing, Safety and Mission Assurance, risk analysis, and technical performance indicators. It also required full documentation of the system and training of users. During the course of the contract, the requirements for Safety and Mission Assurance interface, risk analysis, and technical performance indicators were deleted. Additional capabilities were added as reflected in the Contract Chronology below. Modification 4 added the requirement for Support Contractor manpower data, the ability to manually input data not imported from non-nal sources, a general 'health' indicator screen, and remote usage. Mod 6 included the ability to change the level of planning of Civil Service Manpower at any time and the ability to manually enter Op Codes in the manufacturing data where such codes were not provided by the EMPACS database. Modification 9 included a number of changes to report contents and formats. Modification 11 required the preparation of a detailed System Design Document...|$|R

40|$|Earned Value Management (EVM), like project management, {{is as much}} art as it {{is science}} to develop an {{implementation}} plan for a project. This presentation will cover issues that were overcome and the implementation strategy to deploy Earned Value Management (EVM) within the Constellation Program (CxP), EVA Systems Project Office (ESPO), as well as discuss additional hurdles that currently prevent the organization from optimizing EVM. Each organization and each project within an organization needs to mold an EVM implementation plan around existing processes and tools, {{while at the same}} time revising those existing processes and tools as necessary to make them compatible with EVM. The ESPO EVM implementation covers work breakdown structure, <b>organizational</b> <b>breakdown</b> <b>structure,</b> control account, work/planning package development; integrated master schedule development using an integrated master plan; incorporating reporting requirements for existing funding process such as Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) and JSC Internal Task Agreements (ITA); and interfacing with other software tools such as the Systems Applications and Products (SAP) accounting system and the CxP wInsight EVM analysis tool. However, there are always areas for improvement and EVM is no exception. As EVM continues to mature within the NASA CxP, these areas will continue to be worked to resolution to provide the Program Managers, Project Managers, and Control Account Managers the best EVM data possible to make informed decisions...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the importance of}} the actions to be taken before the project planning phases begin. The approach taken stems from the production planning paradigm, with emphasis on the product, rather than on the process. It is argued that a complete part list or product breakdown structure (PBS) is the absolute prerequisite for the design of a successful work breakdown structure (WBS) for a project. This process requires the definition of the design and configuration disciplines during the engineering phase. These critical issues of concurrent engineering and product development are also emphasized in the paper. The WBS is, in turn, needed to establish a suitable <b>organizational</b> <b>breakdown</b> <b>structure</b> (OBS or organigram) for the project. Finally, the assembly sequence and the related assembly breakdown structure (ABS) of the end product is required before commencing the project planning phase, which provides the schedules, resource allocation, progress control, and the like for the project management. Detailed definition of the product enables the definition of the work packages within the WBS, which combined with the installation information provide the means to structure the layout for the project organization. The result of the entire process, that begins with the product definition phase and ends with the completion of the planning phase, is called the project management plan. The procedure described in the paper will be used to design the project management plan for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a ten-year "ordeal" commencing {{at the beginning of the}} 1995, at CER...|$|E

In practice these ontologies take on the form of <b>breakdown</b> <b>structures</b> such as the Work <b>breakdown</b> <b>structure.</b> Usually these <b>breakdown</b> <b>structures</b> form Metadata to represent a construction activity.

This technique (sometimes called a system <b>breakdown</b> <b>structure)</b> is used to define and organize the total scope of a project.|$|R
40|$|Developing a work <b>breakdown</b> <b>structure</b> is an {{important}} step during the initial phase of the project that once the basic scope have been identified, initial work <b>breakdown</b> <b>structure</b> can be created with a limited scope of information. A work <b>breakdown</b> <b>structure</b> is the basis for planning and managing the key areas within a project. If work <b>breakdown</b> <b>structure</b> is not designed properly, it can {{have an impact on the}} whole project as work <b>breakdown</b> <b>structure</b> serves as the basis of planning. The impact for not proper of the work <b>breakdown</b> <b>structure</b> is not clear work assignments and goals difficult to achieve. Experienced project managers know that there are many things wrong or not right in the project no matter how he managed the planning and execution of their work. Unfortunately for inexperienced planners, they can not anticipate what will happen if they do not prepare properly planning. Proper planning should be done to avoid problems that cannot be expected in the future. If not, many problems will arise, especially during construction. Thus, planner must understand and know how to develop a work <b>breakdown</b> <b>structure</b> correctly. For inexperienced planners, there may be some problems in the planning process. In general, an inexperienced planner has problems in the initial stage. He could not identify which one should be done first. Therefore, this study was come out to study the process flow of work <b>breakdown</b> <b>structure</b> during the planning stage. The objectives of this study are to define the process flow of work <b>breakdown</b> <b>structure</b> based on case study, to identify the similarity on process flow of work <b>breakdown</b> <b>structure</b> among case study and to suggest the suitable process flow of work <b>breakdown</b> <b>structure</b> that can be use for inexperienced planner. In this study, data collection is carried out by interviews. Three of the contractors involved in the planning process will be selected, for this case study. Then, an interview with three project managers will be conducted. As a result, three case studies has similar process flow but different in the sequence only. Difference sequence based on their experience factor. This research hopes to contribute to the planning of inexperience, especially in developing work <b>breakdown</b> <b>structure</b> in the right way...|$|R
40|$|The Product <b>Breakdown</b> <b>Structure</b> is {{traditionally}} {{a method of}} identification of the products of a project in a tree structure. It is a tool used to assess, plan, document, and display the equipment requirements for a project. It {{is part of a}} product based planning technique, and attempts to break down all components of a project in as much detail as possible, so that nothing is overlooked. The PBS for ground systems at the Kennedy Space Center is being developed to encompass the traditional requirements including the alignment of facility, systems, and components to the organizational hierarchy. The Ground Operations Product <b>Breakdown</b> <b>Structure</b> is a hybrid in nature in that some aspects of a work <b>breakdown</b> <b>structure</b> will be incorporated and merged with the Architecture Concept of Operations, Master Subsystem List, customer interface, and assigned management responsibility. The Ground Operations Product <b>Breakdown</b> <b>Structure</b> {{needs to be able to}} identify the flexibility of support differing customers (internal and external) usage of ground support equipment within the Kennedy Space Center launch and processing complex. The development of the Product <b>Breakdown</b> <b>Structure</b> is an iterative activity Initially documenting the organization hierarchy structure and relationships. The Product <b>Breakdown</b> <b>Structure</b> identifies the linkage between the customer program requirements, allocation of system resources, development of design goals, and identification logistics products. As the Product <b>Breakdown</b> <b>Structure</b> progresses the incorporation of the results of requirement planning for the customer occurs identifying facility needs and systems. The mature Product <b>Breakdown</b> <b>Structure</b> is baselined with a hierarchical drawing, the Product <b>Breakdown</b> <b>Structure</b> database, and an associated document identifying the verification of the data through the life cycle of the program/product line. This paper will document, demonstrate, and identify key aspects of the life cycle of a Hybrid Product <b>Breakdown</b> <b>Structure.</b> The purpose is to show how a project management and system engineering approach can be utilized for providing flexible customer service in an evolving manned space flight launch processing environment...|$|R
