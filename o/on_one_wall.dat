The northbound platform's side wall includes tile depicting a big passageway; the first room, {{as seen from the}} platform, has doors to a second room which appears to be a mechanical room. There is a correctly oriented compass rose inlaid {{on the floor of the}} mezzanine.|$|E
25|$|A Casa de Jantar da Rainha (Queen's Dining Room), {{a private}} {{dining room was}} never planned in the 1802 design of the Palace, but by 1880 {{there was a need}} for a {{communal}} space. The final room was decorated in red silk and rich wood grain trim from floor to ceiling, with a wood fireplace/stove <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>wall</b> (surmounted by a large mirror), while the opposite wall provides an entrance to adjacent Billiard Room. The floor is cover in inlaid parquet floor with a bronze lustre.|$|E

25|$|The script {{called for}} an entirely new {{location}} on the Enterprise, stellar cartography. According to Zimmerman, the script characterized the location as a small room with maps <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>wall.</b> Finding the concept uninteresting, Zimmerman designed a circular set with three stories {{to give the impression}} the actors are inside a star map. Zimmerman's previous work designing a crisis management center influenced the design, dominated by video screens. Before the rise of large-format inkjet printers and computer graphics software in the few years before the film was made, the backlit starmaps that covered three-quarters of the wall would have been infeasible to create. The set's size made it one of the largest sets ever constructed on a Paramount lot.|$|E

2500|$|In December 1941, the Nazis {{continued}} issuing {{directions to}} Jews in Germany {{that they were}} to report to be deported to the East. [...] For most of these people, because of Himmler's change of plan (as shown in his [...] "keine Liquiderung" [...] telephone call) [...] they would get a year or two of life in a ghetto before their turn came to be murdered. One of the first trains to arrive in Riga was called the [...] "Bielefeld Transport." [...] Once the German Jews arrived on the Riga transports in December, 1941, they were sent to the ghetto, where they found that the houses had obviously been left in a hurry. [...] The furnishings in the residences were in great disarray and some were stained with blood. [...] Frozen but cooked food was on the tables, and baby carriages with bottles of frozen milk were outside in the snow. [...] <b>On</b> <b>one</b> <b>wall</b> a German family found the words written [...] "Mama, farewell." [...] Years later, a German survivor, then a child, remembers being told [...] "Latvians lived here", with no mention they were Jews.

2500|$|In contrast, let us {{examine a}} {{situation}} which would exhibit memorylessness. Imagine a long hallway, lined <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>wall</b> {{with thousands of}} safes. Each safe has a dial with 500 positions, and each has been assigned an opening position at random. Imagine that an eccentric man walks down the hallway, stopping once at each safe to make a single random attempt to open it. In this case, we might define random variable X as the lifetime of his search, {{expressed in terms of}} [...] "number of attempts the man must make until he successfully opens a safe". In this case, E will always be equal to the value of 500, regardless of how many attempts have already been made. Each new attempt has a (1/500) chance of succeeding, so the man is likely to open exactly one safe sometime in the next 500 attempts -- but with each new failure he makes no [...] "progress" [...] toward ultimately succeeding. Even if the man has just failed 499 consecutive times (or 4,999 times), we expect to wait 500 more attempts until we observe the next success. If, instead, this man focused his attempts on a single safe, and [...] "remembered" [...] his previous attempts to open it, he would be guaranteed to open the safe after, at most, 500 attempts (and, in fact, at onset would only expect to need 250 attempts, not 500).|$|E

50|$|The Hopi had a {{relatively}} limited star lore, but determined {{the passage of}} time for nighttime rituals in the winter by observing the Pleiades (Tsöösöqam) and Orion through a kiva entrance hatch as they passed overhead.

6000|$|<b>On</b> <b>one</b> <b>wall</b> of {{the library}} (which is a simple oblong room, in nowise remarkable) was a copy of verses in a frame, by Cesarotti, and on the wall {{opposite}} a tribute from Alfieri, both manu propriâ.

And from that spot, and from that hour, the intellect and the art of Italy date their degradation.|$|E
60|$|Magdalen {{followed}} {{in the direction of}} the quavering voice, and found herself in a little room looking out on the back yard. There sat old Mazey, with his spectacles low on his nose, and his knotty old hands blundering over the rigging of his model ship. There were Brutus and Cassius digesting before the fire again, and snoring as if they thoroughly enjoyed it. There was Lord Nelson <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>wall,</b> in flaming watercolors; and there, on the other, was a portrait of Admiral Bartram's last flagship, in full sail on a sea of slate, with a salmon-colored sky to complete the illusion.|$|E

There would be two of us <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>wall</b> and two on the other. There would be four shots to fire from one side and four from the other. Then the end would come.

60|$|Several small silver cups on the bookcases {{and half}} a dozen medals pinned to a little square of black velvet <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>wall</b> attested to well-won {{victories}} in various lines of sport. The books on the shelves were what one might expect in such surroundings, well selected stories of adventure and exploration, treatises on hunting, fishing and outdoor sports, a very complete nature library, handbooks on woodcraft, camping, first aid, forestry and surveying, a well-thumbed Scout manual and other books which attested to the owner's love of the great outdoor world. But these were not all. A whole shelf was devoted to history, and another to selections from standard American and English authors, including several of our best loved poets.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very simply yet very tastefully {{arranged}} did the captain's fighting [...] cabin {{seem to me}} as I {{lay down}} on its narrow but comfortable bed, the [...] first night of my visit, and looked around me.

6000|$|At {{the top of}} {{the flight}} of steps ran another passage at a higher level, which the water had never reached, and to right and left were the {{beginnings}} of unfinished chambers. It was clear to him that this queen had died young. Her tomb, as she or the king had designed it, was never finished. A few more paces, and the passage enlarged itself into a hall about thirty feet square. The ceiling was decorated with vultures, their wings outspread, the looped Cross of Life hanging from their talons. <b>On</b> <b>one</b> <b>wall</b> her Majesty Ma-Mee stood expectant while Anubis weighed her heart against the feather of truth, and Thoth, the Recorder, wrote down the verdict upon his tablets.

6000|$|After {{waiting for}} a minute or two, and hearing no signal from the floor above, I {{advanced}} into the broader and brighter part of the hall, to look by daylight at the pictures which I had only imperfectly discovered {{in the darkness of the}} night. A painted inscription in many colors, just under the cornice of the ceiling, informed me that the works on the walls were the production of the all-accomplished Dexter himself. Not satisfied with being poet and composer, he was painter as well. <b>On</b> <b>one</b> <b>wall</b> the subjects were described as [...] "Illustrations of the Passions;" [...] on the other, as [...] "Episodes in the Life of the Wandering Jew." [...] Chance speculators like myself were gravely warned, by means of the inscription, to view the pictures as efforts of pure imagination. [...] "Persons who look for mere Nature in works of Art" [...] (the inscription announced) [...] "are persons to whom Mr. Dexter does not address himself with the brush. He relies entirely on his imagination. Nature puts him out." ...|$|E
60|$|It took Philip's breath away. Mildred {{had left}} no letter, nothing but this ruin to mark her anger, {{and he could}} imagine the set face with which she had gone about her work. He {{went back into the}} sitting-room and looked about him. He was so {{astonished}} that he no longer felt angry. He looked curiously at the kitchen-knife and the coal-hammer, which were lying on the table where she had left them. Then his eye caught a large carving-knife in the fireplace which had been broken. It must have taken her a long time to do so much damage. Lawson's portrait of him had been cut cross-ways and gaped hideously. His own drawings had been ripped in pieces; and the photographs, Manet's Olympia and the Odalisque of Ingres, the portrait of Philip IV, had been smashed with great blows of the coal-hammer. There were gashes in the table-cloth and in the curtains and in the two arm-chairs. They were quite ruined. <b>On</b> <b>one</b> <b>wall</b> over the table which Philip used as his desk was the little bit of Persian rug which Cronshaw had given him. Mildred had always hated it.|$|E
