In 1995, she was associate producer on The Perfect Match, a one-off comedy drama written by former BBC radio producer Mike Bullen. The Perfect Match was broadcast in September 1995, and shortly afterwards, Harries asked Langan to develop more ideas from Bullen.|$|E

After {{a week of}} rehearsing, Welles left to secure further funding and Edwards {{directed}} the play, working on blocking and lighting. Welles returned {{two days before the}} premiere and the cast had their first dress rehearsal, which lasted until 3 a.m. After premiering at the Grand Opera House in Belfast on February 13, 1960, and receiving a good review from a Variety correspondent, the play closed after five performances because of low attendances. It moved to the Gaiety Theatre in Dublin, where it fared no better. By {{the end of the second}} week, Welles had resorted to reading portions of the works of Irish author J. M. Synge, and from Riders to the Sea, to attract an audience. Eventually the play simply became a version <b>of</b> <b>An</b> <b>Evening</b> with Orson Welles, which would often include a question and answer section with the audience and Welles's solo performance of Moby Dick—Rehearsed or the works of Isak Dinesen.|$|E

The additional daily service consisted <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>evening</b> inbound and early morning outbound flight, which included a night stop for both aircraft and crew in Berlin. To improve capacity utilisation on its Berlin services and cut down on aircraft parking as well as crew accommodation costs, from 1 April 1974, Air France routed both of its daily Orly–Tegel services via Cologne, with aircraft and crew returning to their base at Paris Orly the same day. From 1 November that year, Air France's Berlin flights switched to the French capital's then new Charles de Gaulle (CDG) Airport.|$|E

500|$|Zeta-Jones {{returned}} to stage in 2009 with {{a revival of}} the musical A Little Night Music, which marked her Broadway debut. Set in Sweden during the early twentieth century, the musical follows the relationship between three people (Zeta-Jones, Angela Lansbury and Alexander Hanson) during the course <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>evening.</b> She played Desirée Armfeldt, an ageing actress, and was particularly drawn to the complexities of the play, saying, [...] "There's no jazzy hands, no high kicks, no fishnet stockings,... It's not one of those shows where you can dig about three inches and come out the other end. You can keep digging and digging and digging". She did not listen to past recordings of the songs in the play so she could bring her own interpretation to them. The critic Claire Prentice of The Daily Telegraph wrote that Zeta-Jones brought in a [...] "quiet, reflective poignancy" [...] in her rendition of the song [...] "Send in the Clowns", but Emma Brocks of The Guardian was more critical, remarking that [...] "with her pretty voice, head wresting this way and that, [...] seems to be auditioning for stage school". For her performance, Zeta-Jones won the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actress in a Musical and the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical.|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1865, Whitman's friend, John Burroughs (1837–1921), an {{aspiring}} nature writer, had returned to Washington to his position at the Treasury department after a long vacation in the woods. Burroughs recalled that Whitman had been [...] "deeply interested in what I tell him of the hermit thrush, {{and he says he}} largely used the information I have given him in one of his principal poems". Burroughs described the song as [...] "the finest sound in nature...perhaps more <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>evening</b> than a morning hymn...a voice of that calm, sweet solemnity one attains to in his best moments." [...] Whitman took copious notes of his conversations with Burroughs on the subject, writing of the hermit thrush that it [...] "sings oftener after sundown...is very secluded...likes shaded, dark places...His song is a hymn...in swamps—is very shy...never sings near the farm houses—never in the settlement—is the bird of the solemn primal woods & of Nature pure & holy." [...] Burroughs published an essay in May 1865 in which he described the hermit thrush as [...] "quite a rare bird, of very shy and secluded habits" [...] found [...] "only in the deepest and most remote forests, usually in damp and swampy localities". Loving notes that the hermit thrush was [...] "a common bird on Whitman's native Long Island" [...] Biographer Justin Kaplan draws a connection between Whitman's notes and the lines in the poem: ...|$|E

2500|$|To illustrate: {{one might}} be tempted to give as {{examples}} of qualia [...] "the pain of a headache, the taste of wine, or the redness <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>evening</b> sky". But this list of examples already prejudges a central issue in the current debate on qualia. An analogy might make this clearer. Suppose someone wants to know the nature of the liquid crystal pixels on a television screen, those tiny elements that provide all the distributions of color that go to make up the picture. It would not suffice as an answer to say that they are the [...] "redness <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>evening</b> sky" [...] as it appears on the screen. We would protest that their real character was being ignored. One can see that relying on the list above assumes that we must tie sensations not only to the notion of given objects in the world (the [...] "head", [...] "wine", [...] "an evening sky"), but also to the properties with which we characterize the experiences themselves ("redness", for example).|$|E

2500|$|In {{philosophy}} and certain models of psychology, qualia ( [...] or singular form: quale) are {{claimed to be}} individual instances of subjective, conscious experience. The term qualia derives from the Latin neuter plural form (qualia) of the Latin adjective [...] (...) meaning [...] "of what sort" [...] or [...] "of what kind" [...] in a specific instance like [...] "what {{is it like to}} taste a specific orange, this particular orange now". Examples of qualia include the perceived sensation of pain of a headache, the taste of wine, as well as the redness <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>evening</b> sky. As qualitative characters of sensation, qualia stand in contrast to [...] "propositional attitudes", where the focus is on beliefs about experience rather than what is it directly like to be experiencing.|$|E
