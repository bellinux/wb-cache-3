40|$|The {{effective}} yield from a planetary regolith composed of approximately spherical grains is characterized {{in light of}} expressions for laboratory sputtering data. In {{the case of a}} fully-exposed regolith, the {{effective yield}} is of the order of 0. 4 - 1 times the measured yield at normal incidence; the range of variation for this value depends {{on the nature of the}} sputtering process employed.

5|$|The {{results of}} the <b>Outer</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> Survey (OSSOS) {{suggests}} that the observed clustering {{is the result of}} a combination of observing bias and small number statistics. OSSOS, a well-characterized survey of the <b>outer</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> with known biases, observed eight trans-Neptunian objects with semi-major axis > 150 AU with orbits oriented on a wide range of directions. After accounting for the known observational biases of the survey, no evidence for the arguments of perihelion (ω) clustering identified by Trujillo and Sheppard was seen and the orientation of the orbits of the objects with the largest semi-major axis was statistically consistent with random. A previously released paper by Mike Brown analyzed the discovery locations of eccentric trans-Neptunian objects. While identifying some biases he found that even with these biases the clustering of longitudes of perihelion of the known objects would be observed only 1.2% of the time if their actual distribution was uniform.|$|E

Its surface is dotted with more than 100 mountains, {{some of which are}} taller than Earth's Mount Everest.

5|$|In the <b>outer</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System,</b> comets remain {{frozen and}} {{inactive}} and are extremely {{difficult or impossible}} to detect from Earth due to their small size. Statistical detections of inactive comet nuclei in the Kuiper belt have been reported from observations by the Hubble Space Telescope but these detections have been questioned. As a comet approaches the inner Solar System, solar radiation causes the volatile materials within the comet to vaporize and stream out of the nucleus, carrying dust away with them.|$|E

5|$|New {{concepts}} for {{missions to}} the Neptune {{system to be}} conducted in the 2010s have been brought forward by NASA scientists on numerous occasions over the last decades. All of them identified Triton as being a prime target and a separate Triton lander comparable to the Huygens probe for Titan was frequently included in those plans. No efforts aimed at Neptune and Triton went beyond the proposal phase and NASA's funding on missions to the <b>outer</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> is currently focused on the Jupiter and Saturn systems.|$|E
5|$|The outer {{region of}} the Solar System {{is home to the}} giant planets and their large moons. The centaurs and many short-period comets also orbit in this region. Due to their greater {{distance}} from the Sun, the solid objects in the <b>outer</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> contain a higher proportion of volatiles, such as water, ammonia, and methane than those of the inner Solar System because the lower temperatures allow these compounds to remain solid.|$|E

An infrared survey by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) in 2009 allowed for a Neptune-sized object beyond 700 AU. A similar study in 2014 focused on possible higher-mass bodies in the <b>outer</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> and ruled out Jupiter-mass objects out to 26,000 AU.|$|E

Different groups have analyzed the Pioneer data and have got the same results, which rules out computer programming and handling errors. Attempts to explain this phenomenon arguing intrinsic causes on-board the spacecrafts failed or have lead to inconclusive results.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a set of}} requirements for the technology development of a solar sail propelled Interstellar Heliopause Probe mission. The mission {{is placed in the}} context of other <b>outer</b> <b>solar</b> <b>systems</b> missions, ranging from a Kuiper Belt mission through to an Oort cloud mission. Mission requirements are defined and a detailed parametric trajectory analysis and launch date scan performed. Through analysis of the complete mission trade space a set of critical technology development requirements are identified which include an advanced lightweight composite High-Gain Antenna, a high-efficiency Ka-band travelling-wave tube amplifier and a radioisotope thermoelectric generator with power density of approximately 12 W/kg. It is also shown that the Interstellar Heliopause Probe mission necessitates the use of a spinning sail, limiting the direct application of current hardware development activities. A Kuiper Belt mission is then considered as a pre-curser to the Interstellar Heliopause Probe, while it is also shown through study of an Oort cloud mission that the Interstellar Heliopause Probe mission is the likely end-goal of any future solar sail technology development program. As such, the technology requirements identified to enable the Interstellar Heliopause Probe must be enabled through all prior missions, with each mission acting as an enabling facilitator towards the next...|$|R
5|$|The planets were {{originally}} {{thought to have}} formed in or near their current orbits. However, this view underwent radical change during the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Currently, {{it is thought that}} the Solar System looked very different after its initial formation: several objects at least as massive as Mercury were present in the inner Solar System, the <b>outer</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> was much more compact than it is now, and the Kuiper belt was much closer to the Sun.|$|E
5|$|The study {{proposed}} a possible surface base on Callisto that would produce rocket propellant for further {{exploration of the}} Solar System. Advantages of a base on Callisto include low radiation (due to its distance from Jupiter) and geological stability. Such a base could facilitate remote exploration of Europa, or be an ideal location for a Jovian system waystation servicing spacecraft heading farther into the <b>outer</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System,</b> using a gravity assist from a close flyby of Jupiter after departing Callisto.|$|E
5|$|Neon's {{abundance}} {{in the universe}} is about 1 part in 750; in the Sun and presumably in the proto-solar system nebula, about 1 part in 600. The Galileo spacecraft atmospheric entry probe found {{that even in the}} upper atmosphere of Jupiter, the abundance of neon is reduced (depleted) by about a factor of 10, to a level of 1 part in 6,000 by mass. This may indicate that even the ice-planetesimals which brought neon into Jupiter from the <b>outer</b> <b>solar</b> <b>system,</b> formed in a region which was too warm to retain the neon atmospheric component (abundances of heavier inert gases on Jupiter are several times that found in the Sun).|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} study of debris disks whose spectra are well {{modelled}} by dust emission at two different temperatures. These disks are typically {{assumed to be a}} sign of multiple belts, which in only a few cases have been confirmed via high resolution observations. We first compile a sample of two-temperature disks to derive their properties, summarised by the ratios of the warm and cool component temperatures and fractional luminosities. The ratio of warm to cool temperatures is constant in the range 2 - 4, and the temperatures of both warm and cool components increases with stellar mass. We then explore whether this emission can arise from dust in a single narrow belt, with the range of temperatures arising from the size variation of grain temperatures. This model can produce two-temperature spectra for Sun-like stars, but is not supported where it can be tested by observed disk sizes and far-IR/mm spectral slopes. Therefore, while some two-temperature disks arise from single belts, it is probable that most have multiple spatial components. These disks are plausibly similar to the <b>outer</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System's</b> configuration of Asteroid and Edgeworth-Kuiper belts separated by giant planets. Alternatively, the inner component could arise from inward scattering of material from the outer belt, again due to intervening planets. In either case, we suggest that the ratio of warm/cool component temperatures is indicative of the scale of outer planetary systems, which typically span a factor of about ten in radius.

40|$|This article {{suggests}} a preliminary {{version of a}} Cantorian superfluid vortex hypothesis as a plausible model of nonlinear cosmology. Though {{some parts of the}} proposed theory resemble several elements of what have been proposed by Consoli (2000, 2002), Gibson (1999), Nottale (1996, 1997, 2001, 2002 a), and Winterberg (2002 b), it seems such a Cantorian superfluid vortex model instead of superfluid or vortex theory alone has never been proposed before. Implications of the proposed theory will be discussed subsequently, including prediction of some new <b>outer</b> planets in <b>solar</b> <b>system</b> beyond Pluto orbit. Therefore further observational data is recommended to falsify or verify these predictions. If the proposed hypothesis corresponds to the observed facts, then it could be used to solve certain unsolved problems, such as gravitation instability, clustering, vorticity and void formation in galaxies, and the distribution of planet orbits both in <b>solar</b> <b>system</b> and also exoplanets...|$|R
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the Solar System's evolution, comets were ejected out of the inner Solar System by the gravity of the giant planets, and sent {{thousands}} of AU outward to form the Oort cloud, a spherical outer swarm of cometary nuclei at the farthest extent of the Sun's gravitational pull. Eventually, after about 800 million years, the gravitational disruption caused by galactic tides, passing stars and giant molecular clouds began to deplete the cloud, sending comets into the inner Solar System. The evolution of the <b>outer</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> also appears to have been influenced by space weathering from the solar wind, micrometeorites, and the neutral components of the interstellar medium.|$|E
5|$|The overall {{structure}} of the charted regions of the Solar System consists of the Sun, four relatively small inner planets surrounded by a belt of mostly rocky asteroids, and four giant planets surrounded by the Kuiper belt of mostly icy objects. Astronomers sometimes informally divide this structure into separate regions. The inner Solar System includes the four terrestrial planets and the asteroid belt. The <b>outer</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> is beyond the asteroids, including the four giant planets. Since {{the discovery of the}} Kuiper belt, the outermost parts of the Solar System are considered a distinct region consisting of the objects beyond Neptune.|$|E
5|$|Comets are {{distinguished}} from asteroids {{by the presence}} of an extended, gravitationally unbound atmosphere surrounding their central nucleus. This atmosphere has parts termed the coma (the central part immediately surrounding the nucleus) and the tail (a typically linear section consisting of dust or gas blown out from the coma by the Sun's light pressure or outstreaming solar wind plasma). However, extinct comets that have passed close to the Sun many times have lost nearly all of their volatile ices and dust and may come to resemble small asteroids. Asteroids are thought to have a different origin from comets, having formed inside the orbit of Jupiter rather than in the <b>outer</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System.</b> The discovery of main-belt comets and active centaur minor planets has blurred the distinction between asteroids and comets.|$|E

50|$|The {{chemical}} composition of comets should reflect both {{the conditions in}} the <b>outer</b> <b>solar</b> nebula some 4.5 x 109 ayr, {{and the nature of}} the natal interstellar cloud from which the <b>Solar</b> <b>system</b> was formed. While comets retain a strong signature of their ultimate interstellar origins, significant processing must have occurred in the protosolar nebula. Early models of coma chemistry showed that reactions can occur rapidly in the inner coma, where the most important reactions are proton transfer reactions. Such reactions can potentially cycle deuterium between the different coma molecules, altering the initial D/H ratios released from the nuclear ice, and necessitating the construction of accurate models of cometary deuterium chemistry, so that gas-phase coma observations can be safely extrapolated to give nuclear D/H ratios.|$|R
5|$|Harrington died in January 1993, {{without having}} found Planet X. Six months before, E. Myles Standish had used data from Voyager 2s 1989 flyby of Neptune, which had revised the planet's total mass {{downward}} by 0.5%—an amount {{comparable to the}} mass of Mars—to recalculate its gravitational effect on Uranus. When Neptune's newly determined mass {{was used in the}} Jet Propulsion Laboratory Developmental Ephemeris (JPL DE), the supposed discrepancies in the Uranian orbit, and with them the need for a PlanetX, vanished. There are no discrepancies in the trajectories of any space probes such as Pioneer 10, Pioneer 11, Voyager 1, and Voyager 2 that {{can be attributed to the}} gravitational pull of a large undiscovered object in the <b>outer</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System.</b> Today, most astronomers agree that PlanetX, as Lowell defined it, does not exist.|$|E
5|$|The {{exploration}} of Jupiter {{has been conducted}} via close observations by automated spacecraft. It began {{with the arrival of}} Pioneer 10 into the Jovian system in 1973, and, , has continued with eight further spacecraft missions. All of these missions were undertaken by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and all but two have been flybys that take detailed observations without the probe landing or entering orbit. These probes make Jupiter the most visited of the Solar System's outer planets as all missions to the <b>outer</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> have used Jupiter flybys to reduce fuel requirements and travel time. On 5 July 2016, spacecraft Juno arrived and entered the planet's orbit—the second craft ever to do so. Sending a craft to Jupiter entails many technical difficulties, especially due to the probes' large fuel requirements and the effects of the planet's harsh radiation environment.|$|E
5|$|Halley is {{the most}} active of all the {{periodic}} comets, with others, such as Comet Encke and Comet Holmes, being one or two orders of magnitude less active. Its day side (the side facing the Sun) is far more active than the night side. Spacecraft observations showed that the gases ejected from the nucleus were 80% water vapor, 17% carbon monoxide and 3–4% carbon dioxide, with traces of hydrocarbons although more-recent sources give a value of 10% for carbon monoxide and also include traces of methane and ammonia. The dust particles {{were found to be}} primarily a mixture of carbon–hydrogen–oxygen–nitrogen (CHON) compounds common in the <b>outer</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System,</b> and silicates, such as are found in terrestrial rocks. The dust particles decreased in size down to the limits of detection (~0.001µm). The ratio of deuterium to hydrogen in the water released by Halley was initially thought to be similar to that found in Earth's ocean water, suggesting that Halley-type comets may have delivered water to Earth in the distant past. Subsequent observations showed Halley's deuterium ratio to be far higher than that found in Earth's oceans, making such comets unlikely sources for Earth's water.|$|E
40|$|In {{the closing}} {{years of the}} 20 th Century {{humankind}} began its exploration of the planetary <b>systems</b> in the <b>solar</b> neighborhood. Precision radial velocity measurements have now yielded the discovery of over 160 planets. Direct imaging of these planets, as opposed to detection {{of the effects of}} orbital motion on their parent star, is now feasible, and the first young planet in a wide orbit may have been detected using adaptive optics systems. Gemini and the VLT are building the first generation of high contrast adaptive optics systems, which deliver planet-imaging performance within few Airy rings of the host star. These systems will make the first surveys of the <b>outer</b> regions of <b>solar</b> <b>systems</b> by detecting the self-luminous radiation of young planets. These instruments will establish whether Jovian planets form predominantly through 'top-down' (global gravitational instability) or 'bottom-up' (core accretion) processes. The 8 -m 'extreme' AO systems cannot see close enough to the host stars to image Doppler planets, and they cannot reach the relatively distant, young clusters and associations where planets are forming. The Planet Formation Instrument will use the nearly four-fold improved angular resolution of TMT to peer into the inner <b>solar</b> <b>systems</b> of Doppler-planet bearing stars to yield a unified sample of planets with known Keplerian orbital elements and atmospheric properties. In star formation regions, where T Tauri stars (young solar type stars) are found in abundance, PFI can see into the snow line, where the icy cores of planets like Jupiter must have formed. Thus, TMT will be the first facility to witness the formation of new planets...|$|R

25|$|The {{existence}} of deuterium on Earth, {{elsewhere in the}} <b>solar</b> <b>system</b> (as confirmed by planetary probes), and in the spectra of stars, {{is also an important}} datum in cosmology. Gamma radiation from ordinary nuclear fusion dissociates deuterium into protons and neutrons, and there are no known natural processes other than the Big Bang nucleosynthesis, which might have produced deuterium at anything close to the observed natural abundance of deuterium (deuterium is produced by the rare cluster decay, and occasional absorption of naturally occurring neutrons by light hydrogen, but these are trivial sources). There is thought to be little deuterium in the interior of the Sun and other stars, as at temperatures there nuclear fusion reactions that consume deuterium happen much faster than the proton-proton reaction that creates deuterium. However, deuterium persists in the <b>outer</b> <b>solar</b> atmosphere at roughly the same concentration as in Jupiter, and this has probably been unchanged since the origin of the <b>Solar</b> <b>System.</b> The natural abundance of deuterium seems to be a very similar fraction of hydrogen, wherever hydrogen is found, unless there are obvious processes at work that concentrate it.|$|R
