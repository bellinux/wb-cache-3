The first scheduled service flew on 24 January 2005, carrying eight passengers. This first month, 972 passengers took the plane, and Vildanden announced that they would try to also start a route to Stavanger Airport, Sola, as well as potentially to Oslo Airport, Gardermoen.|$|E

Widerøe also operates flights eastwards to other communities in Finnmark on public service obligations with the Ministry of Transport and Communications. Two helicopter operators have bases at the airport: Bristow Norway, which operates two Eurocopter EC225 Super Pumas, and CHC Helikopter Service, which operates a Sikorsky S-92. Both companies operate flights to <b>offshore</b> <b>installations.</b> One of the Super Pumas is used for search and rescue operations for the petroleum industry and when the Royal Norwegian Air Force's Westland Sea Kings based at Station Group Banak are not available, for instance if they are on another mission or the aircraft are being maintained.|$|E

40|$|The {{floating}} sheerlegs of SMIT {{are used}} for a large variety of tasks in sheltered, near shore as well as offshore environments. Generally the tasks vary from recovering operations (salvage) to inshore installation work. Originally, the usage of floating sheerlegs was driven by their robustness, needed for recovering work and shallow draft, needed for working near shore. In the past years the sheerlegs of SMIT became increasingly utilized for <b>installation</b> work <b>offshore.</b> As a result, {{the need for more}} detailed analysis showing the feasibility, related safety and reliability of operations emerged. In the engineering phase of such <b>offshore</b> <b>installation</b> projects these aspects are analyzed for each operational phase from load-out, towage to <b>offshore</b> lifting and <b>installation.</b> This paper addresses the crucial elements {{that need to be addressed}} when a floating sheerlegs is utilized for <b>offshore</b> <b>installation</b> work.

25|$|Incidents {{are handled}} {{at one of}} three levels: on-scene coordination, at a rescue sub-center or at a JRCC. Most {{land-based}} SAR missions are coordinated at the second level by the local police district. However, the JRCC is kept informed and may offer advise and allocate resources without coordinating the mission. The JRCCs take over control in situation at sea, by aircraft and at <b>offshore</b> <b>installations,</b> {{as well as for}} instances which require international cooperation and prolonged operations. The JRCC may appoint an on-scene coordinator for a search, typically a navy or coast guard vessel. For major accidents, hotlines for next of kin are set up, and crisis psychology and clergy is available to these and search participants. Professional public relations experts are used to handle the media.|$|E
25|$|Seaborne piracy against {{transport}} vessels {{remains a}} significant issue (with estimated worldwide losses of US$16billion per year), {{particularly in the}} waters between the Red Sea and Indian Ocean, off the Somali coast, {{and also in the}} Strait of Malacca and Singapore, which are used by over 50,000 commercial ships a year. In the Gulf of Guinea, maritime piracy has also led to pressure on offshore oil and gas production, providing security for <b>offshore</b> <b>installations</b> and supply vessels is often paid for by oil companies rather than the respective governments. In the late 2000s, the emergence of piracy off the coast of Somalia spurred a multi-national effort led by the United States to patrol the waters near the Horn of Africa. In 2011, Brazil also created an anti-piracy unit on the Amazon River. Sir Peter Blake, a New Zealand world champion yachtsman, had been killed by pirates on the Amazon river in 2001.|$|E
50|$|As {{a result}} of a public inquiry into the accident, several changes were made in order to improve the safety of oil rigs, amongst them the use of a {{stand-by}} boat, which would be able to help rescue crews in the event of future accidents, and the recognition of an <b>Offshore</b> <b>Installation</b> Manager.|$|R

On 11 November 2009, the German pilots on a flight from Skien to Bergen announced that only 28 of the passengers, without baggage, could take the ride. The reason was bad weather, which was described as [...] "normal Norwegian rain" [...] by the airline afterwards. This caused several commuters to miss their connecting flights on helicopters to <b>offshore</b> <b>installations.</b> The airline later stated that it {{was caused by the}} pilots not being aware of the safety equipment installed at Geiteryggen.|$|E
500|$|The airline was not founded until 1 September 1989, after Ludvig G.

The OIM's information environment is one that is complex and relies heavily on both formal and informal sources of information. Two modes of OIM information behaviour are identified: everyday information need, in which the OIM seeks, uses and shares information to maintain safe operations; and emergency information need, in which there is both reliance on information that must be known in order to react to an emergency situation and a need for accessible information about the status of a rapidly changing environment. The OIM is both the user of information and a source of information for others and as such must be trusted, reliable and automotive. OPITO- Offshore Petroleum Industry Training Organisation...|$|R

Two optimization models are developed to analyse cost-effective port and vessel strategies for <b>offshore</b> <b>installation</b> operations. By applying principals of mixed integer linear programming (MILP), the two models seek to minimize total costs through port- and vessel related decisions. The models cover <b>offshore</b> transportation and <b>installation</b> {{of a given}} amount of wind turbines. Different vessel strategies, ports, time horizon and weather restrictions are considered in the models. Several deterministic test cases with fixed cost parameters and historic weather data are implemented in AMPL and run with the CPLEX solver. The test cases show promising results in aiding strategic decisions, and the models provide valuable insight into economic impact of such decisions. The results indicate that decision aid could be more reliable if smaller sub-problems are considered, potentially in a stochastic framework...|$|R
