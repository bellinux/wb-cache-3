25|$|Xu & Chun (2009) {{propose the}} neural-object file theory, which posits {{that the human}} visual system {{initially}} selects a fixed number of roughly four objects from a crowded scene based on their spatial information (object individuation) before encoding their details (<b>object</b> <b>identification).</b> Under this framework, object individuation is generally controlled by the inferior intra-parietal sulcus (IPS), while <b>object</b> <b>identification</b> involves the superior IPS and higher-level visual areas. At the object individuation stage, object representations are coarse and contain minimal feature information. However, once these object representations (or object-files, to use the theory's language) have been 'set up' during the object individuation stage they can be elaborated on over time during the <b>object</b> <b>identification</b> stage, during which additional featural and identity information is received.|$|E

40|$|Real-time {{processing}} the information coming form video, infra-red or electro-optical sources is a challenging task due the uncertainties such as noise and clutter, but also {{due to the}} large dimensionalities {{of the problem and}} the demand for fast and efficient algorithms. This paper details an approach for automatic detection, single and multiple <b>objects</b> <b>identification</b> and tracking in video streams with applications to surveillance, security and autonomous systems. It is based on a method that provides recursive density estimation (RDE) using a Cauchy type of kernel. The main advantage of the RDE approach as compared to other traditional methods (e. g. KDE) is the low computational and memory storage cost since it works on a frame-by-frame basis; the lack of thresholds, and applicability to multiple <b>objects</b> <b>identification</b> and tracking. A robust to noise and clutter technique based on spatial density is also proposed to autonomously identify the targets location in the frame...|$|R
5000|$|An {{extension}} of Marr and Nishihara's model, the recognition-by-components theory, proposed by Biederman (1987), proposes that the visual information gained from an object {{is divided into}} simple geometric components, such as blocks and cylinders, also known as [...] "geons" [...] (geometric ions), and are then matched with the most similar object representation that is stored in memory to provide the <b>object's</b> <b>identification</b> (see Figure 1).|$|R
2500|$|One major {{improvement}} in operations {{was the creation}} of a new career field, Space <b>Object</b> <b>Identification</b> Analyst (DSOIA)(AFSC 2025B). [...] This was made possible by some {{improvement in}} radar imaging, still primitive, but enabling better assessment of which objects were satellite payloads, which carrier rockets, and which debris. [...] The DSOIAs exchanged information with the NORAD Space Intelligence Division. Intelligence information about the mission of foreign satellites was also primitive. Public announcements by launching agencies and comparison with past launches were both useful. [...] At one point in time, DSOIA duties were also performed by officers at remote sites, including Diyarbakır, Turkey. [...] By the early 1970s, the work was consolidated at Colorado Springs, so that DSOIAs did not have to have remote duty tours. In later years, special telescopes were deployed to assist in identification.|$|E
2500|$|Transsaccadic {{memory is}} {{characterized}} by the integration of information gathered prior to the execution of a saccade (pre-saccadic) and information gathered after the saccade (post-saccadic stimuli. This involves attention, [...] locating the targets necessary to perform a saccade and continuous updates of the environmental information. Attention occurs prior to the movement of the eyes, therefore it has a strong influence on the location of the saccade, what information is being encoded, remembered across saccades and stored into transsaccadic memory. In order to perform a successful and accurate saccade an individual is required to make an attentional shift to the saccadic target. This attentional shift causes the encoding of information to occur near the saccade target location. Attention to the target of the saccade results in better <b>object</b> <b>identification</b> and an increase in accuracy of identification. As well as, improvement in coding of locational information. Attention is restricted to one saccade target per area. It is impossible to keep attention on a target in one area, while performing another saccade simultaneously in another. This will cause prolonged saccadic latency periods (the time it takes to make a saccade from one area to another), and increased reaction times. However, attention can be distributed around the saccade target, rather than the precise location that will fall on the fovea, allowing for the detection of one or two objects situated around the saccadic target. Kowler (1995) proposed two models to explain the relationship between attention, saccades and transsaccadic memory. The spatial model, states that attention is distributed among the perceptual site (visual field) and the saccadic target during the latency period, which allows for the identification of the saccadic target and object surrounding that area. The temporal model states that attention determines [...] where the saccade will occur and releases a “go” signal to initiate a saccade within that area.|$|E
