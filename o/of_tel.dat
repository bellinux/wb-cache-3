40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} effects of tax and expenditure limitations (TELs) stringency and its interaction with revenue diversity and the council-manager form of government on municipal general fund expenditure. TELs are explicit rules that states impose to reduce local government spending. TELs stringency varies from state to state, leading to difficulties in assessing their impact across the nation. This dissertation proposes a new means for measuring the stringency <b>of</b> <b>TELs</b> imposed on local governments. Factor analysis is utilized, and then factor scores are calculated to identify degrees <b>of</b> <b>TELs</b> stringency. This study contends that higher levels <b>of</b> <b>TELs</b> stringency are associated with lower local government spending. However, the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>TELs</b> is dependent on revenue diversity and the form of government. This study suggests that both revenue diversity and the council-manager form of government mitigate the impacts <b>of</b> <b>TELs</b> stringency on local government spending. Panel data from 2007 to 2011 from 1, 508 municipalities are utilized. This study finds that higher levels <b>of</b> <b>TELs</b> stringency are associated {{with lower levels of}} municipal general fund expenditures per capita. However, TELs stringency is effective only when revenue diversity is low and when cities have a form of government other than council-manager. These results are generally consistent with the theory presented in this dissertation...|$|R

5|$|During this fighting, the 3rd Light Horse Brigade {{had been}} sent to {{reinforce}} the Anzac Mounted Division, while the 5th Mounted Brigade remained in corps reserve armed with swords. With all brigades of both mounted divisions already committed to the battle, the only brigade available was the 4th Light Horse Brigade, which was ordered to capture Beersheba. These swordless mounted infantrymen galloped over the plain, riding towards the town and a redoubt supported by entrenchments on a mound <b>of</b> <b>Tel</b> es Saba south-east of Beersheba. The 4th Light Horse Regiment on the right jumped trenches before turning to make a dismounted attack on the Ottoman infantry in the trenches, gun pits, and redoubts. Most of the 12th Light Horse Regiment on the left rode on across the face of the main redoubt to find a gap in the Ottoman defenses, crossing the railway line into Beersheba to complete the first step of an offensive which culminated in the EEF capturing Jerusalem six weeks later.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1948 war the Arab {{orchards}} to {{the east}} <b>of</b> <b>Tel</b> Aviv were opened for development, and the military started using the Sde Dov airport on a regular basis. The airport regained its commercial operations, initially serving domestic flights, mostly to single customers, on Piper Cub aircraft. It later expanded operations to scheduled service on larger aircraft to various parts of Israel. As {{a result of the}} land availability, an additional, northsouth, runway was built with no opposition. By 1960, land in Tel Aviv became scarce, and the municipality demanded that the airport be relocated northward, so as to allow residential development in its place. However, a committee that investigated in 1961 the options for such a relocation found no feasible site in proximity to Tel Aviv and suggested that flights be moved to Lod airport (now known as Ben Gurion Airport), and that road access from Tel Aviv to Lod be improved. This option, however, was blocked by the Israel Defense Forces.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, {{the mayor}} <b>of</b> <b>Tel</b> Aviv Israel Rokach asked the British mandate {{authorities}} {{for permission to}} create an airport in Palestine, promising to solve the transportation problem of Jews during the Arab revolt of 193639 when travelling from Tel Aviv through Arab territory to the main airport at Lydda, to catch Palestine Airways flights to Haifa, was difficult and dangerous. Works began on a plot of land north of the Yarkon River, Tel Aviv and when completed in October 1938, the airport served regular flights to Haifa, with the option of flights to Beirut. In 1940, the airport's name was changed to Sde Dov, in memory of Dov Hoz, {{one of the pioneers}} of Jewish aviation. Sde Dov was abandoned after Palestine Airways ceased operations in August 1940 and the site was used as a British Army base until December 1947 when with British permission the runway was reopened by Haganah.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, it {{was mainly}} food that the {{inhabitants}} of Jerusalem needed. Starting 5 June, the Israeli engineers started to fix the road so that it let civil transport trucks pass to supply the city. 150 workers, working in four teams, installed a pipeline to supply the city with water, because the other pipeline, crossing Latrun, had been cut by the Jordanians. In O Jerusalem, Dominique Lapierre and Larry Collins talked about heroic action, when during the night of 6–7 June, in fear of the critical situation of Jerusalem and to improve {{the morale of the}} population, 300 inhabitants <b>of</b> <b>Tel</b> Aviv were requisitioned to carry on their backs, for the few kilometers not yet ready for the trucks, what would be needed to feed {{the inhabitants of}} Jerusalem one more day.|$|E
5|$|The Third Battle of Gaza {{was fought}} {{on the night}} of 1/2 November 1917 between British and Ottoman forces during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of World War I, and came after the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) victory at the Battle of Beersheba had ended the Stalemate in Southern Palestine. The {{fighting}} occurred {{at the beginning of the}} Southern Palestine Offensive, and together with attacks on Hareira and Sheria on 6–7 November and the continuing Battle <b>of</b> <b>Tel</b> el Khuweilfe which had been launched by General Edmund Allenby on 1 November, it eventually broke the Gaza to Beersheba line defended by the Yildirim Army Group. Despite having held this line since March 1917, the Ottoman Army was forced to evacuate Gaza and Tel el Khuweilfe during the night of 6/7 November. Only Sheria held out for most of the 7 November before it too was captured.|$|E

5|$|The {{success at}} Beersheba {{significantly}} reduced Ottoman resistance, but heavy fighting continued around Gaza and elsewhere, including the Battle <b>of</b> <b>Tel</b> el Khuweilfe, and the regiment remained at Beersheba {{for four days}} to receive remounts. Gaza fell in early November and, as Ottoman forces fell back, the British Empire troops followed them in pursuit. The 12th advanced further into Palestine {{as part of the}} plan to capture Jerusalem. On 7 November, during the Battle of Hareira and Sheria, the regiment joined the 11th Light Horse Regiment in an attack in support of the 60th Division around Khurbet Buteihah, but was forced to halt their charge and dismount amidst artillery and machine-gun fire as their horses needed water. The following day, the 12th was sent to Beit Hanun to contact the Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade, before searching for water around Sin Sin and Faluje, where they captured a number of Ottoman troops before rejoining the Australian Mounted Division at Huj. On 10 November, the 12th provided support to the 11th Light Horse Regiment when they came under attack at Hill 248 by a strong Ottoman counterattack, which was turned back. After moving on to Summeil the next day, one of the regiment's squadrons received heavy fire while providing flank protection to the 54th Division as it attacked to the south of Et Tine.|$|E

40|$|User {{charges have}} {{emerged as one of}} the major revenue sources for {{municipal}} governments in the United States since the late 1970 s. Meanwhile, a majority of states have adopted tax and expenditure limitations (TELs) in an attempt to constrain the revenue and spending levels of local governments including municipalities. In the era <b>of</b> <b>TELs,</b> how user charges perform their multiple roles in promoting local autonomy, political accountability, allocative efficiency, horizontal equity, and responsive government deserves considerable attention in the field of public finance. This dissertation explores the causes and consequences of the increased use of user charges by American municipalities. First, I provide an overview of fiscal trends in American municipalities. Chapter 1 discusses the context in which municipal revenue policy is made, the definitions of user charges, the salience of the issue, and the aims and organization of the dissertation. Chapter 2 investigates the effect <b>of</b> <b>TELs</b> on municipal reliance on user charges. The analysis is based on a sample of 724 cities for the period of 1970 to 2004. I employ fixed effects regression techniques to help control for the unobserved city-level characteristics that vary across cities but are time invariant. Results indicate that the implementation <b>of</b> <b>TELs</b> leads to a substantial increase in per capita user charges. The effect becomes even more pronounced when the endogoneity <b>of</b> <b>TELs</b> is taken into account using a two-stage least squares model. This finding implies that TELs may have unintended consequences and lead to a bigger government. Results also suggest that the restrictiveness and the number <b>of</b> <b>TELs</b> make a difference and different types <b>of</b> <b>TELs</b> generate varying effects on user charge reliance. Chapter 3 examines the impact of user charge financing on municipal expenditure levels. Using a panel of 686 cities for the sewer service and 715 cities for the parks and recreation service between 1972 and 2004, I find strong evidence that a greater reliance on user charges to finance government services leads to a reduction in municipal expenditures. Finally, I conclude with a discussion of policy implications in Chapter 4...|$|R

40|$|Since {{the early}} 1970 s, {{litigation}} in many U. S. states {{has led to}} education finance reform. Over the same period, many states have imposed new tax and expenditure limitations (TELs) on local governments. The imposition <b>of</b> a <b>TEL</b> may alter how local and state education expenditures change subsequent to court-mandated decreases in spending inequality. Similarly, the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>TELs</b> in limiting local education expenditures {{may be influenced by}} reform. To better evaluate the effects <b>of</b> reform and <b>TELs</b> on education spending, this article considers them jointly and finds that reform has a negative effect on local own-source education expenditures only in the presence <b>of</b> <b>TELs.</b> In the absence <b>of</b> court-ordered reform, <b>TELs</b> decrease own-source expenditure, but the effect is less pronounced than when TELs are present with reform. When both are present, state government spending on education is higher. Also TELs and court-ordered reform independently increase state government spending on education.
