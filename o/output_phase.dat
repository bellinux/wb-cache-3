25|$|A phase {{detector}} compares two input signals and produces an error signal which {{is proportional to}} their phase difference. The error signal is then low-pass filtered and used to drive a VCO which creates an <b>output</b> <b>phase.</b> The output is fed through an optional divider back to the input of the system, producing a negative feedback loop.

50|$|GPSDOs {{typically}} phase-align {{the internal}} flywheel oscillator to the GPS signal by using dividers {{to generate a}} 1PPS signal from the reference oscillator, then phase comparing this 1PPS signal to the GPS-generated 1PPS signal and using the phase differences to control the local oscillator frequency in small adjustments via the tracking loop. This differentiates GPSDOs from their cousins NCOs (numerically controlled oscillator).

40|$|An interpolative-phase-tuning (IPT) {{technique}} is proposed to tune {{the frequency of}} millimeter-wave (MMW) LC-based ring oscillators without using varactor. As a key feature, the tradeoff between tank and tuning range of the proposed IPT oscillators is independent of the operation frequency, which makes the IPT technique suitable for applications at MMW frequencies. Moreover, the IPT oscillators can achieve larger frequency tuning range and much better phase accuracy over the tuning range {{as compared to the}} conventional gm-coupled LC oscillators for multi-phase generation.

50|$|With recent device advances, newer {{forms of}} cyclo{{converters}} are being developed, such as matrix converters.

50|$|A popular {{method used}} in the CLI {{environment}} is capture/playback. Capture playback is a system where the system screen is “captured” as a bitmapped graphic at various times during system testing. This capturing allowed the tester to “play back” the testing process and compare the screens at the <b>output</b> <b>phase</b> of the test with expected screens. This validation could be automated since the screens would be identical if the case passed and different if the case failed.|$|E
50|$|It {{should be}} {{expected}} that the outputs of even the simplest operational amplifiers will {{have at least two}} poles. An unfortunate consequence of this is that at some critical frequency, the phase of the amplifiers output = −180° compared to the phase of its input signal. The amplifier will oscillate if it has a gain of one or more at this critical frequency. This is because (a) the feedback is implemented through the use of an inverting input that adds an additional −180° to the <b>output</b> <b>phase</b> making the total phase shift −360° and (b) the gain is sufficient to induce oscillation.|$|E
50|$|In particular, {{the ability}} to compare the phase of signals led to phase-comparison RDF, which {{is perhaps the most}} widely used {{technique}} today. In this system the loop antenna is replaced with a single square-shaped ferrite core, with loops wound around two perpendicular sides. Signals from the loops are sent into a phase comparison circuit, whose <b>output</b> <b>phase</b> directly indicates the direction of the signal. By sending this to any manner of display, and locking the signal using PLL, the direction to the broadcaster can be continuously displayed. Operation consists solely of tuning in the station, and is so automatic that these systems are normally referred to as automatic direction finder.|$|E

40|$|A {{technique}} for negatively coupling the outputs of polyphase choppers is disclosed, wherein the output inductance of each phase {{is divided into}} two windings, and each winding is negatively coupled to a corresponding winding of a neighboring phase.

5000|$|The method most {{commonly}} used is called dominant-pole compensation, which {{is a form of}} lag compensation. A pole placed at an appropriate low frequency in the open-loop response reduces the gain of the amplifier to one (0 dB) for a frequency at or just below the location of the next highest frequency pole. The lowest frequency pole is called the dominant pole because it dominates the effect of all of the higher frequency poles. The result is that the difference between the open loop <b>output</b> <b>phase</b> and the phase response of a feedback network having no reactive elements never falls below −180° while the amplifier has a gain of one or more, ensuring stability.|$|E
5000|$|The {{superior}} close-in {{phase noise}} {{performance of a}} DDS {{stems from the fact}} that it is a feed-forward system. In a traditional phase locked loop (PLL), the frequency divider in the feedback path acts to multiply the phase noise of the reference oscillator and, within the PLL loop bandwidth, impresses this excess noise onto the VCO output. A DDS on the other hand, reduces the reference clock phase noise by the ratio [...] because its output is derived by fractional division of the clock. Reference clock jitter translates directly to the output, but this jitter is a smaller percentage of the output period (by the ratio above). Since the maximum output frequency is limited to , the <b>output</b> <b>phase</b> noise at close-in offsets is always at least 6dB below the reference clock phase-noise.|$|E
5000|$|The output {{signals of}} all {{amplifiers}} exhibit a time delay {{when compared to}} their input signals. This delay causes a phase difference between the amplifier's input and output signals. If there are enough stages in the amplifier, at some frequency, the output signal will lag behind the input signal by one cycle period at that frequency. In this situation, the amplifier's output signal will be in phase with its input signal though lagging behind it by 360°, i.e., the output will have a phase angle of &minus;360°. This lag is of great consequence in amplifiers that use feedback. The reason: the amplifier will oscillate if the fed-back output signal is in phase with the input signal at the frequency at which its open-loop voltage gain equals its closed-loop voltage gain and the open-loop voltage gain is one or greater. The oscillation will occur because the fed-back output signal will then reinforce the input signal at that frequency. [...] In conventional operational amplifiers, the critical <b>output</b> <b>phase</b> angle is &minus;180° because the output is fed back to the input through an inverting input which adds an additional &minus;180°.|$|E
