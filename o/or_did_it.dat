500|$|This episode {{received}} positive reviews. Christine Orlando from TV Fanatic {{praised the}} episode saying, [...] "Body of Proof threw just enough curves {{to keep me}} guessing this week and provided enough personal interaction between our characters to {{make me want to}} tune in for more". She praised the interaction between Megan and Lacey calling their conversation [...] "cute", adding [...] "It's nice to watch Megan make extra time to spend with her daughter". She called the Alan's actions [...] "pathetic" [...] for trying to apologize to Martin for killing his wife saying, [...] "You've got to be kidding!". Orlando added that she did not [...] "see coming" [...] Martin's reaction to the apology; he shot Alan, stating [...] "I could understand the sentiment". She praised the interaction between Megan and Peter, highlighting their conversation over Peter's girlfriend. Orlando said that she could not understand Megan's facial expressions to Peter's girlfriend, whether it was one of jealousy or tease. She said, [...] "Megan was certainly giving Peter a lot of ribbing about his new girlfriend. Was Megan just having fun with him <b>or</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> bother her a little? I couldn't quite tell". She finished in saying, [...] "A [...] "Hunting Party" [...] led to a tragic death and a merry go round of suspects on Body of Proof this week".|$|E

2500|$|At the trial, Mr Justice Starke had {{directed}} the jury: [...] "In certain circumstances, {{the crime of}} murder may be established even though the accused {{had no intention of}} killing.

If a killing occurs by an act of violence {{in the course of a}} commission of a felony involving violence, or in the furtherance of the purpose of such felony, the accused is guilty of murder, even though there is no actual intention of killing."

2500|$|... "It {{is fairly}} clear that most Anglo-Saxon cemeteries are unrepresentative {{of the whole}} population, and {{particularly}} the whole age range. This was, therefore, a community which made decisions about the {{disposal of the dead}} based upon various factors, but at those we can barely guess. Was the inclusion of some but not all individuals subject to political control, or cultural screening? Was this a mark of ethnicity <b>or</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> represent a particular kinship, real or constructed, or the adherents of a particular cult? Was it status specific, with the rural proletariat – who would have been {{the vast majority of the}} population – perhaps excluded? So are many of these cemeteries associated with specific, high-status households and weighted particularly towards adult members? We do not know, but the commitment of particular parts of the community to an imported and in some senses 'Germanic', cremation ritual does seem to have been considerable, and is something which requires explanation." ...|$|E
2500|$|For centuries, {{scientists}} had debated between two possible theories of light: {{was it a}} wave <b>or</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> instead comprise a stream of tiny particles? [...] By the 19th century, the debate was generally considered to have been settled {{in favor of the}} wave theory, as it was able to explain observed effects such as refraction, diffraction, interference and polarization. James Clerk Maxwell had shown that electricity, magnetism and light are all manifestations of the same phenomenon: the electromagnetic field. Maxwell's equations, which are the complete set of laws of classical electromagnetism, describe light as waves: a combination of oscillating electric and magnetic fields. Because of the preponderance of evidence in favor of the wave theory, Einstein's ideas were met initially with great skepticism. Eventually, however, the photon model became favored. One of the most significant pieces of evidence in its favor was its ability to explain several puzzling properties of the photoelectric effect, described in the following section. Nonetheless, the wave analogy remained indispensable for helping to understand other characteristics of light: diffraction, refraction and interference.|$|E

6000|$|... 'I've always observed,' said Harry Oswald, 'that Providence is {{supposed}} to have ordained the existing order for the time being, whatever it may be, but not the order that is at that exact moment endeavouring to supplant it. If I were to visit Central Africa, I should confidently expect to be told by the rain-doctors that Providence had ordained the absolute power of the chief, and the custom of massacring his wives and slaves at his open grave side. I believe in Russia it's usually allowed that Providence has placed the orthodox Czar {{at the head of the}} nation, and that any attempt to obtain a constitution from him is simply flat rebellion and flying in the face of Providence. In England we had a King John once, and we extracted a constitution out of him and sundry other kings by main force; and here, it's acquiescence in the present limited aristocratic government that makes up obedience to the Providential arrangement of things apparently. But how about America? eh, Mrs. Martindale? Did Providence ordain that George Washington was to rebel against his most sacred majesty King George III., <b>or</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> not? And did it ordain that George Washington was to knock his most sacred majesty's troops into a cocked hat, <b>or</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> not? And did it ordain that Abraham Lincoln was to free the slaves, <b>or</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> not? What I want to know is this: can it be said that Providence has ordained every class distinction in the whole world, from Dahomey to San Francisco? And has it ordained every Government, past and present, from the Chinese Empire to the French Convention? Did it ordain, for example, the revolution of '89? That's the question I should like to have answered.' ...|$|E
