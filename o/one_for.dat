5|$|Before 1707, the Kingdom of Scotland was a {{sovereign}} independent state {{which had its}} own legislature—the Parliament of Scotland—which met, latterly, at Parliament House on the Royal Mile in Edinburgh. The Treaty of Union, signed in 1707, created an incorporating political union between the Kingdom of Scots and the Kingdom of England. The two previous Acts of Union (<b>one</b> <b>for</b> the British Parliament and <b>one</b> <b>for</b> the Parliament of Scotland) had dissolved the previous parliaments. The Treaty of Union created the Parliament of Great Britain which was housed in the Palace of Westminster in London. As a consequence, Scotland was directly governed from London for the next 292 years without a legislature or a Parliament building of its own.|$|E

However, due to the high cost of maintaining three households, <b>one</b> <b>for</b> each parent and <b>one</b> <b>for</b> the children, it's rarely a viable option in a custody case.|$|E

The Pittston Coal Company had worked with the Bituminous Coal Operators (BCOA), which regulated health and retirement benefits offered to Pittston workers. The Pittston mines continued to lose money, though, and in 1987 the Pittston Coal Company terminated its contract with the BCOA to establish its own health and retirement benefit contract with the UMWA. Through collective bargaining, the UMWA and the Pittston Coal Company established two different retirement plans for the miners: <b>one</b> <b>for</b> those who retired before 1974 and <b>one</b> <b>for</b> those who retired after 1974, {{in the hopes that}} this would help the company gain a profit.|$|E
