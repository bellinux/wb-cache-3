EnergyPATHWAYS offers detailed energy, cost, and emissions accounting for the energy flows from primary supply to final demand. The energy system representation is flexible, allowing for differing levels of detail and the nesting of cities, states, and countries. The model uses hourly least-cost electricity dispatch and supports power-to-gas, short-duration energy storage, long-duration energy storage, and demand response. Scenarios typically run to 2050.|$|E

40|$|Generation {{expansion}} planning models optimize {{investment and}} operational decisions over a time horizon of multiple decades, thereby typically assuming perfect foresight (PF). Recently, myopic <b>optimization</b> <b>models,</b> {{in which the}} foresight is restricted to a certain period, have been suggested to more realistically simulate the short-sightedness of investment decision makers. The literature {{has shown that the}} modeled level of foresight can {{have a significant impact on}} the results obtained. However, the literature does not contain an in-depth analysis of the investment decision making process in myopic <b>optimization</b> <b>models.</b> As a result, the implications of using myopic <b>optimization</b> <b>models</b> to simulate the decision making of private agents in liberalized electricity markets are unclear. This paper provides fundamental methodological insights into the decision making in both PF and myopic <b>optimization</b> <b>models.</b> The projections, at the time the investment decision is made, of the short-run profits that can be obtained by investing in a generation asset are analyzed in this regard. This analysis reveals a major limitation of the decision making process in myopic <b>optimization</b> <b>models,</b> i. e., the approach does not extrapolate trends, in terms of changes in the projected SR profits, expected within the window of foresight to later periods. This leads to decision making which cannot be considered to reflect reality. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|In {{discrete}} optimization, {{a special}} ordered set (SOS) is an ordered set of variables, {{used as an}} additional way to specify integrality conditions in an <b>optimization</b> <b>model.</b> Special order sets are basically a device or tool used in branch and bound methods for branching on sets of variables, rather than individual variables, as in ordinary mixed integer programming. Knowing that a variable {{is part of a}} set and that it is ordered gives the branch and bound algorithm a more intelligent way to face the optimization problem, helping to speed up the search procedure. The members of a special ordered set individually may be continuous or discrete variables in any combination. However, even when all the members are themselves continuous, a model containing one or more special ordered sets becomes a discrete optimization problem requiring a mixed integer optimizer for its solution.|$|E
50|$|In IWFM, {{the land}} surface, surface water and {{groundwater}} flow domains are simulated as separate processes, compiled into individual dynamic link libraries. The processes are linked by water flow terms, maintain conservation of mass and momentum between processes, and are solved simultaneously. This allows each IWFM process {{to be run}} independently as a stand-alone model, or {{to be linked to}} other programs. This functionality has been used to create a Microsoft Excel Add-in to create workbooks from IWFM output files. The IWFM land surface process has been compiled into a stand-alone program called the IWFM Demand Calculator IDC. The groundwater process is linked to the WRIMS modeling system and used in the water resources <b>optimization</b> <b>model</b> CalSim. This feature allows other models to be easily linked with IWFM, to either enhance the capabilities of the target model (for example, by adding groundwater flow to a land surface-surface water model) or to enhance the capabilities of IWFM (for example, linking an economic model to IWFM to dynamically change the crop mix based on the depth to groundwater, as the cost of pumping increases with depth to water).|$|E
