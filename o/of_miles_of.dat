5|$|Colder weather, {{bringing}} with it rain and snow on September 11 calmed the fires down substantially throughout the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Though the fires continued to burn {{well into the}} middle of November, they never again posed an immediate risk to life or property. Many fire crews were sent home, but additional manpower continued to arrive at Yellowstone to rehabilitate areas that had been affected by the firefighting efforts. Hundreds <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>of</b> firelines, helicopter landing zones and fire camps needed to be restored to a more natural state, and thousands of hazardous dead trees needed to be cut down to protect roads and buildings. Finally, on November 18, all fires in Yellowstone were officially declared out.|$|E

5|$|Pain's heirs {{were his}} two daughters, Cecily and Agnes. His heir male was his brother, Eustace fitzJohn. The two daughters were married {{five times in}} total; Cecily married three times but failed to produce any direct heirs. Her first husband was Roger, the son <b>of</b> <b>Miles</b> <b>of</b> Gloucester. Pain {{arranged}} Cecily and Roger's marriage. The marriage contract specified that Roger would inherit all of Pain's lands, but as result of the latter's death the marriage was not contracted until December 1137, when King Stephen confirmed {{the terms of the}} settlement. The king also settled the bulk of the inheritance on Cecily, which led to disturbances and a minor war among disappointed claimants. Agnes married Warin de Munchensy and after his death Haldenald de Bidun. She died after 1185, by which time she was described as a widow.|$|E
5|$|Talbot died {{in about}} 1140, and his lands passed to Sybil, and her second husband, Josce de Dinan. He {{was buried in}} Gloucester Abbey. The lands at Swanscombe were divided between Talbot's two nieces, Cecily and Agnes, the daughters of Sybil and Pain fitzJohn. Cecily married first Roger of Hereford, son <b>of</b> <b>Miles</b> <b>of</b> Gloucester, and second William of Poitou and third Walter de Mayenne, {{but she had no}} {{children}} by any of her marriages and on her death in 1207, her lands passed to the heirs of her sister Agnes. Cecily's death without heirs also meant that the feudal barony of Swanscombe passed to her sister's heirs. Agnes married first Warin de Mountchesney and second Haldenald de Bidun, and her descendants held the barony of Swanscombe until 1324, when the line died out.|$|E

Bates and his friend Alfred Russel Wallace set out to obtain new species and new evidence for evolution by natural selection, as well as exotic specimens to sell. He explored thousands <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>of</b> the Amazon and its tributaries, and collected over 14,000 species, of which 8,000 were new to science.
