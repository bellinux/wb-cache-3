5|$|A {{follow-up}} study conducted 14 {{months after the}} original psilocybin session confirmed that participants continued to attribute deep personal meaning to the experience. Almost one-third of the subjects reported that the experience was the single most meaningful or spiritually significant event of their lives, and over two-thirds reported it among their five most spiritually significant events. About two-thirds indicated that the experience increased their sense <b>of</b> <b>well-being</b> or life satisfaction. Even after 14 months, those who reported mystical experiences scored on average 4 percentage points higher on the personality trait of Openness/Intellect; personality traits are normally stable across the lifespan for adults. Likewise, in a recent (2010) web-based questionnaire study designed to investigate user perceptions of the {{benefits and harms of}} hallucinogenic drug use, 60% of the 503 psilocybin users reported that their use of psilocybin had a long-term positive impact on their sense <b>of</b> <b>well-being.</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{research}} {{of personal and}} cultural factors <b>of</b> subjective <b>well-being</b> <b>of</b> a personality, held in different countries with implementation of various methods, showed identities and differences of some dimensions.

5|$|The Gender-related Development Index (GDI) was {{introduced}} in 1995 in the Human Development Report written by the United Nations Development Program in order to add a gender-sensitive dimension to the Human Development Index. The GDI takes into account not only the average or general level <b>of</b> <b>well-being</b> and wealth within a given country, but also how this wealth and well-being is distributed between different groups within society, especially between genders. However, feminist economists do not universally agree {{on the use of}} the GDI and some offer improvements to it.|$|E

It has been shown that they are beneficial to humans in creating a sense <b>of</b> <b>well-being</b> and reducing stress. Many towns have initiated tree-planting programmes.

5|$|Feminist economists Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum {{created the}} human {{capabilities}} approach {{as an alternative}} way to assess economic success rooted in the ideas of welfare economics {{and focused on the}} individual's potential to do and be what he or she may choose to value.

This approach emphasizes processes as well as outcomes, and draws attention to cultural, social and material dynamics <b>of</b> <b>well-being.</b> Martha Nussbaum, expanded on the model with a more complete list of central capabilities including life, health, bodily integrity, thought, and more. In recent years, the capabilities approach has influenced the creation of new models including the UN's Human Development Index (HDI).|$|E

The {{purpose of this}} study was to design an assessment instrument <b>of</b> work-related <b>well-being</b> for music therapy professionals. An interview method was applied to construct a conceptual theory based on the data collected from seven music therapy professionals with diverse backgrounds. An on-line survey <b>of</b> work-related <b>well-being,</b> which contained 54 five points Likert-type items, was derived through analyzing the contents of the interviews. Four hundred ninety-three music therapy professionals in the US were randomly selected to participate in the survey, and 157 responded (respond rate 32 %). Among them, 117 samples were determined to be valid for use in the factor analysis. Factor analysis revealed five factors <b>of</b> work-related <b>well-being</b> for music therapy professionals, including work satisfaction, stressors, self-awareness, work demands, and self-care skills. Statistical techniques, namely Pearson correlation, independent t-test and one-way ANOVA, were used to determine the impact of work years, education levels, and salaries on perception <b>of</b> work-related <b>well-being.</b> The results showed that music therapy professionals reported satisfaction both in their overall feeling <b>of</b> work-related <b>well-being</b> and combined factor scores. Also, the combined factor scores positively correlated to overall scale <b>of</b> work-related <b>well-being.</b> The experienced music therapy professionals have significantly higher combined factor scores <b>of</b> work-related <b>well-being</b> than do novice music therapy professionals. In addition, education levels do not show statistically significant differences on the combined factor scores <b>of</b> work-related <b>well-being.</b> Finally, salary levels do not exhibit statistically significant impact on factor scores <b>of</b> work-related <b>well-being,</b> though the p-value is much smaller (p =. 105). Analysis of seven interviews and psychometric methods were applied to verify the validity and reliability of the resultant assessment instrument.

25|$|Puntland has {{the lowest}} rate of poverty in Somalia, with 27%, {{compared}} to 50% in Somaliland and 57% in Mogadishu. Experts believe {{this is because of}} higher consumption and higher labour force participation. Households in Puntland consume a higher quantity per capita per item and more items per household. The lower rate of poverty {{does not appear to be}} driven by household size, as the average in Puntland is 5.2, compared to 5.7 in Somaliland and 4.5 in Mogadishu. Puntland is doing better in various important indicators <b>of</b> <b>well-being.</b> For instance, the literacy rate in Puntland is 64% compared to the national average of 55%. Additionally, households in Puntland also outperform the average in other educational outcomes such as enrolment and educational attainment. 70% of households in Puntland have access to improved water sources compared to the national average of 58%. Therefore, Puntland’s higher performance on non-monetary indicators <b>of</b> <b>well-being</b> are inline with its lower rate of poverty.|$|E
